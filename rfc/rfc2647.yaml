  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines terms used in measuring the performance\
    \ of\n   firewalls. It extends the terminology already used for benchmarking\n\
    \   routers and switches with definitions specific to firewalls.\n   Forwarding\
    \ rate and connection-oriented measurements are the primary\n   metrics used in\
    \ this document.\n   Why do we need firewall performance measurements? First,\
    \ despite the\n   rapid rise in firewall deployment, there is no standard method\
    \ of\n   performance measurement. Second, implementations vary widely, making\n\
    \   it difficult to do direct performance comparisons. Finally, more and\n   more\
    \ organizations are deploying firewalls on internal networks\n   operating at\
    \ relatively high speeds, while most firewall\n   implementations remain optimized\
    \ for use over relatively low-speed\n   wide-area connections. As a result, users\
    \ are often unsure whether\n   the products they buy will stand up to relatively\
    \ heavy loads.\n"
- title: 2. Existing definitions
  contents:
  - "2. Existing definitions\n   This document uses the conceptual framework established\
    \ in RFCs 1242\n   and 2544 (for routers) and RFC 2285 (for switches). The router\
    \ and\n   switch documents contain discussions of several terms relevant to\n\
    \   benchmarking the performance of firewalls. Readers should consult the\n  \
    \ router and switch documents before making use of this document.\n   This document\
    \ uses the definition format described in RFC 1242,\n   Section 2. The sections\
    \ in each definition are: definition,\n   discussion, measurement units (optional),\
    \ issues (optional), and\n   cross-references.\n"

- title: 3.1 Allowed traffic
  contents:
  - "3.1 Allowed traffic\n   Definition:\n     Packets forwarded as a result of the\
    \ rule set of the device under\n     test/system under test (DUT/SUT).\n   Discussion:\n\
    \     Firewalls typically are configured to forward only those packets\n     explicitly\
    \ permitted in the rule set. Forwarded packets must be\n     included in calculating\
    \ the bit forwarding rate or maximum bit\n     forwarding rate of the DUT/SUT.\
    \ All other packets must not be\n     included in bit forwarding rate calculations.\n\
    \     This document assumes 1:1 correspondence of allowed traffic offered\n  \
    \   to the DUT/SUT and forwarded by the DUT/SUT. There are cases where\n     the\
    \ DUT/SUT may forward more traffic than it is offered; for\n     example, the\
    \ DUT/SUT may act as a mail exploder or a multicast\n     server. Any attempt\
    \ to benchmark forwarding rates of such traffic\n     must include a description\

    \ basis.\n   Discussion:\n     Circuit proxies always forward packets containing\
    \ a given port\n     number if that port number is permitted by the rule set.\n\
    \     Application proxies, in contrast, forward packets only once a\n     connection\
    \ has been established using some known protocol. When the\n     connection closes,\

- title: 3.3 Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.3 Authentication\n   Definition:\n     The process of verifying that a user\
    \ requesting a network resource\n     is who he, she, or it claims to be, and\
    \ vice versa.\n   Discussion:\n     Trust is a critical concept in network security.\
    \ Any network\n     resource (such as a file server or printer) typically requires\n\
    \     authentication before granting access.\n     Authentication takes many forms,\
    \ including but not limited to IP\n     addresses; TCP or UDP port numbers; passwords;\
    \ external token\n     authentication cards; and biometric identification such\
    \ as\n     signature, speech, or retina recognition systems.\n     The entity\
    \ being authenticated might be the client machine (for\n     example, by proving\
    \ that a given IP source address really is that\n     address, and not a rogue\
    \ machine spoofing that address) or a user\n     (by proving that the user really\
    \ is who he, she, or it claims to\n     be).  Servers might also authenticate\
    \ themselves to clients.\n     Testers should be aware that in an increasingly\
    \ mobile society,\n     authentication based on machine-specific criteria such\
    \ as an IP\n     address or port number is not equivalent to verifying that a\
    \ given\n     individual is making an access request. At this writing systems\n\
    \     that verify the identity of users are typically external to the\n     firewall,\
    \ and may introduce additional latency to the overall SUT.\n   Unit of measurement:\n\

- title: 3.4 Bit forwarding rate
  contents:
  - "3.4 Bit forwarding rate\n   Definition:\n     The number of bits per second of\
    \ allowed traffic a DUT/SUT can be\n     observed to transmit to the correct destination\
    \ interface(s) in\n     response to a specified offered load.\n   Discussion:\n\
    \     This definition differs substantially from section 3.17 of RFC 1242\n  \
    \   and section 3.6.1 of RFC 2285.\n     Unlike both RFCs 1242 and 2285, this\
    \ definition introduces the\n     notion of different classes of traffic: allowed,\
    \ illegal, and\n     rejected (see definitions for each term). For benchmarking\n\
    \     purposes, it is assumed that bit forwarding rate measurements\n     include\
    \ only allowed traffic.\n     Unlike RFC 1242, there is no reference to lost or\
    \ retransmitted\n     data.  Forwarding rate is assumed to be a goodput measurement,\
    \ in\n     that only data successfully forwarded to the destination interface\n\
    \     is measured.  Bit forwarding rate must be measured in relation to\n    \
    \ the offered load.  Bit forwarding rate may be measured with\n     differed load\
    \ levels, traffic orientation, and traffic\n     distribution.\n     Unlike RFC\
    \ 2285, this measurement counts bits per second rather\n     than frames per second.\
    \ Testers interested in frame (or frame-like)\n     measurements should use units\
    \ of transfer.\n   Unit of measurement:\n     bits per second\n   Issues:\n  \

  contents:
  - "3.5 Circuit proxy\n   Definition:\n     A proxy service that statically defines\
    \ which traffic will be\n     forwarded.\n   Discussion:\n     The key difference\
    \ between application and circuit proxies is that\n     the latter are static\
    \ and thus will always set up a connection if\n     the DUT/SUT's rule set allows\
    \ it. For example, if a firewall's rule\n     set permits ftp connections, a circuit\
    \ proxy will always forward\n     traffic on TCP port 20 (ftp-data) even if no\
    \ control connection was\n     first established on TCP port 21 (ftp-control).\n\

- title: 3.6 Concurrent connections

  - "3.6 Concurrent connections\n   Definition:\n     The aggregate number of simultaneous\
    \ connections between hosts\n     across the DUT/SUT, or between hosts and the\
    \ DUT/SUT.\n   Discussion:\n     The number of concurrent connections a firewall\
    \ can support is just\n     as important a metric for some users as maximum bit\
    \ forwarding\n     rate.\n     While \"connection\" describes only a state and\
    \ not necessarily the\n     transfer of data, concurrency assumes that all existing\
    \ connections\n     are in fact capable of transferring data. If a data cannot\
    \ be sent\n     over a connection, that connection should not be counted toward\
    \ the\n     number of concurrent connections.\n     Further, this definition assumes\
    \ that the ability (or lack thereof)\n     to transfer data on a given connection\
    \ is solely the responsibility\n     of the DUT/SUT. For example, a TCP connection\
    \ that a DUT/SUT has\n     left in a FIN_WAIT_2 state clearly should not be counted.\
    \ But\n     another connection that has temporarily stopped transferring data\n\
    \     because some external device has restricted the flow of data is not\n  \
    \   necessarily defunct. The tester should take measures to isolate\n     changes\
    \ in connection state to those effected by the DUT/SUT.\n   Unit of measurement:\n\

- title: 3.7 Connection
  contents:
  - "3.7 Connection\n   Definition:\n     A state in which two hosts, or a host and\
    \ the DUT/SUT, agree to\n     exchange data using a known protocol.\n   Discussion:\n\
    \     A connection is an abstraction describing an agreement between two\n   \
    \  nodes: One agrees to send data and the other agrees to receive it.\n     Connections\
    \ might use TCP, but they don't have to. Other protocols\n     such as ATM also\
    \ might be used, either instead of or in addition to\n     TCP connections.\n\
    \     What constitutes a connection depends on the application. For a\n     native\
    \ ATM application, connections and virtual circuits may be\n     synonymous. For\
    \ TCP/IP applications on ATM networks (where multiple\n     TCP connections may\
    \ ride over a single ATM virtual circuit), the\n     number of TCP connections\
    \ may be the most important consideration.\n     Additionally, in some cases firewalls\
    \ may handle a mixture of\n     native TCP and native ATM connections. In this\
    \ situation, the\n     wrappers around user data will differ. The most meaningful\
    \ metric\n     describes what an end-user will see.\n     Data connections describe\
    \ state, not data transfer. The existence\n     of a connection does not imply\
    \ that data travels on that connection\n     at any given time, although if data\
    \ cannot be forwarded on a\n     previously established connection that connection\
    \ should not be\n     considered in any aggregrate connection count (see concurrent\n\
    \     connections).\n     A firewall's architecture dictates where a connection\
    \ terminates.\n     In the case of application or circuit proxy firewalls, a connection\n\
    \     terminates at the DUT/SUT. But firewalls using packet filtering or\n   \
    \  stateful packet filtering designs act only as passthrough devices,\n     in\
    \ that they reside between two connection endpoints. Regardless of\n     firewall\
    \ architecture, the number of data connections is still\n     relevant, since\
    \ all firewalls perform some form of connection\n     maintenance; at the  very\
    \ least, all check connection requests\n     against their rule sets.\n     Further,\
    \ note that connection is not an atomic unit of measurement\n     in that it does\
    \ not describe the various steps involved in\n     connection setup, maintenance,\
    \ and teardown. Testers may wish to\n     take separate measurements of each of\
    \ these components.\n     When benchmarking firewall performance, it's important\
    \ to identify\n     the connection establishment and teardown procedures, as these\
    \ must\n     not be included when measuring steady-state forwarding rates.\n \
    \    Further, forwarding rates must be measured only after any security\n    \
    \ associations have been established.\n     Though it seems paradoxical, connectionless\
    \ protocols such as UDP\n     may also involve connections, at least for the purposes\
    \ of firewall\n     performance measurement. For example, one host may send UDP\
    \ packets\n     to another across a firewall. If the destination host is listening\n\
    \     on the correct UDP port, it receives the UDP packets. For the\n     purposes\
    \ of firewall performance measurement, this is considered a\n     connection.\n\

  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The primary goal of this memo is to describe terms\
    \ used in\n   benchmarking firewall performance. However, readers should be aware\n\
    \   that there is some overlap between performance and security issues.\n   Specifically,\
    \ the optimal configuration for firewall performance may\n   not be the most secure,\
    \ and vice-versa.\n   Further, certain forms of attack may degrade performance.\
    \ One common\n   form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack bombards a firewall with\
    \ so\n   much rejected traffic that it cannot forward allowed traffic. DoS\n \
    \  attacks do not always involve heavy loads; by definition, DoS\n   describes\
    \ any state in which a firewall is offered rejected traffic\n   that prohibits\
    \ it from forwarding some or all allowed traffic. Even a\n   small amount of traffic\
    \ may significantly degrade firewall\n   performance, or stop the firewall altogether.\
    \ Further, the safeguards\n   in firewalls to guard against such attacks may have\
    \ a significant\n   negative impact on performance.\n   Since the library of attacks\
    \ is constantly expanding, no attempt is\n   made here to define specific attacks\
    \ that may affect performance.\n   Nonetheless, any reasonable performance benchmark\
    \ should take into\n   consideration safeguards against such attacks. Specifically,\
    \ the same\n   safeguards should be in place when comparing performance of different\n\
