  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n\
    \   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet\n  \
    \ and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture.  This\n   long-term\
    \ planning function of the IAB is complementary to the\n   ongoing engineering\
    \ efforts performed by working groups of the\n   Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF), under the leadership of the\n   Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG) and area directorates.\n   Today's Internet is experienced by users as\
    \ a set of applications,\n   such as email, instant messaging, and services on\
    \ the Web.  While\n   these applications do not require users to be present at\
    \ the time of\n   service execution, in many cases they are.  There are also\n\
    \   substantial differences in performance among the various end devices,\n  \
    \ but in general end devices participating in the Internet are\n   considered\
    \ to have high performance.\n   There are, however, a large number of deployed\
    \ embedded devices, and\n   there is substantial value in interconnecting them\
    \ with the Internet.\n   The term \"Internet of Things\" denotes a trend where\
    \ a large number of\n   devices employ communication services offered by the Internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Many of these devices are not directly operated by\n   humans,\
    \ but exist as components in buildings or vehicles, or are\n   spread out in the\
    \ environment.  There is a large variation in the\n   computing power, available\
    \ memory, (electrical) power, and\n   communications bandwidth between different\
    \ types of devices.\n   Many of these devices offer a range of new possibilities\
    \ or provide\n   additional value for previously unconnected devices.  Some devices\n\
    \   have been connected using proprietary communication networks in the\n   past\
    \ but are now migrating to the use of the Internet Protocol suite\n   in order\
    \ to share the same communication network between all\n   applications and to\
    \ enable rich communications services.\n   Much of this development can simply\
    \ run on existing Internet\n   protocols.  For instance, home entertainment and\
    \ monitoring systems\n   often offer a Web interface to the end user.  In many\
    \ cases the new,\n   constrained environments can benefit from additional protocols\
    \ and\n   protocol extensions that help optimize the communications and lower\n\
    \   the computational requirements.  Examples of currently ongoing\n   standardization\
    \ efforts targeted for these environments include the\n   Constrained RESTful\
    \ Environments (CoRE), IPv6 over Low power WPAN\n   (6LoWPAN), Routing Over Low\
    \ power and Lossy networks (ROLL), and the\n   Light-Weight Implementation Guidance\
    \ (LWIG) working groups of the\n   IETF.\n   This workshop explored the experiences\
    \ of researchers and developers\n   when considering the characteristics of constrained\
    \ devices.\n   Engineers know that many design considerations need to be taken\
    \ into\n   account when developing protocols and architecture.  Balancing\n  \
    \ between the conflicting goals of code size, economic incentives,\n   power consumption,\
    \ usability, and security is often difficult, as\n   illustrated by Clark et al.\
    \ in \"Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining\n   Tomorrow's Internet\" [Tussle].\n  \
    \ Participants at the workshop discussed the experience and approaches\n   taken\
    \ when designing protocols and architectures for interconnecting\n   smart objects\
    \ to the Internet.  The scope of the investigations\n   included constrained nodes\
    \ as well as constrained networks.\n   The call for position papers suggested\
    \ investigating the area of\n   integration with the Internet in the following\
    \ categories:\n   o  Scalability\n   o  Power efficiency\n   o  Interworking between\
    \ different technologies and network domains\n   o  Usability and manageability\n\
    \   o  Security and privacy\n   The goals of the workshop can be summarized as\
    \ follows:\n      As many deployed smart objects demonstrate, running protocols\
    \ like\n      the Internet Protocol Version 4 [RFC0791] and Version 6 [RFC2460],\n\
    \      the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768], the Transmission\n      Control\
    \ Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793], the Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n      (HTTP) [RFC2616],\
    \ etc., on constrained devices is clearly\n      possible.  Still, protocol designers,\
    \ system architects, and\n      developers have to keep various limitations in\
    \ mind.  The\n      organizers were interested to discuss the experience with\n\
    \      deploying IETF protocols in different constrained environments.\n     \
    \ Furthermore, the organizers were seeking to identify issues either\n      where\
    \ current implementers do not yet have solutions or where\n      researchers predict\
    \ potential issues.\n      The workshop served as a venue to identify problems\
    \ and to\n      discover common interests that may turn into new work or into\n\
    \      changes in direction of already ongoing work at the IETF and or\n     \
    \ the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).\n"
- title: 2.  Constrained Nodes and Networks
  contents:
  - "2.  Constrained Nodes and Networks\n   The workshop was spurred by the increasing\
    \ presence of constrained\n   devices on the network.  It is quite natural to\
    \ ask how these\n   limitations impact the design of the affected nodes.  Note\
    \ that not\n   all nodes suffer from the same set of limitations.\n   Energy constraints:\n\
    \      Since wireless communication can be a large portion of the power\n    \
    \  budget for wireless devices, reducing unnecessary communication\n      can\
    \ significantly increase the battery life of a low-end device.\n      The choice\
    \ of low-power radio can also significantly impact the\n      overall energy consumption,\
    \ as can sleeping periodically, when the\n      device is not in use.  In some\
    \ cases, these nodes will only wake\n      periodically to handle needed communications.\
    \  This constraint is\n      quite in contrast to the \"always on\" paradigm found\
    \ in regular\n      Internet hosts.  Even in the case of non-battery operated\
    \ devices,\n      power is a constraint with respect to energy efficiency goals.\n\
    \   Bandwidth constraints:\n      Various low-power radio networks offer only\
    \ limited bandwidth, and\n      show high packet loss as well as high link quality\
    \ variability.\n      The data transmission rates vary from 20 to 900 kilobits\
    \ per\n      second (e.g., in the case of IEEE 802.15.4).  Nodes may be used in\n\
    \      usually highly unstable radio environments.  The physical-layer\n     \
    \ packet size may be limited (~100 bytes).\n   Memory constraints:\n      The\
    \ amount of volatile and persistent storage impacts the program\n      execution\
    \ and has important implications for the functionality of\n      the protocol\
    \ stack.  The Arduino UNO board, for example, provides\n      a developer with\
    \ 2 KB RAM and 32 KB flash memory (without any\n      extensions, such as microSD\
    \ cards).\n   A system designer also needs to consider CPU constraints, which\
    \ often\n   relate to energy constraints: a processor with lower performance\n\
    \   consumes less energy.  As described later in this document, the\n   design\
    \ of the mainboard may allow certain components to be put to\n   sleep to further\
    \ lower energy consumption.  In general, embedded\n   systems are often purpose\
    \ built with only the hardware components\n   needed for the given task, while\
    \ general-purpose personal computers\n   are less constrained with regard to their\
    \ mainboard layout and\n   typically offer a huge number of optional plug-in peripherals\
    \ to be\n   connected.  A factor that also has to be taken into consideration\
    \ is\n   the intended usage environment.  For example, a humidity sensor\n   deployed\
    \ outside a building may need to deal with temperatures from\n   -50 degrees C\
    \ to +85 degrees C.  There are often physical size\n   limitations for smart objects.\
    \  While traditional mainboards are\n   rather large, such as the Advanced Technology\
    \ eXtended (ATX) design\n   with a board size of 305 x 244 mm available in many\
    \ PCs or the mini-\n   ITX design typically found in home theater PCs with 170\
    \ x 170 mm,\n   mainboard layouts for embedded systems are typically much smaller,\n\
    \   such as the CoreExpress layout with 58 x 65 mm, or even smaller.  In\n   addition\
    \ to the plain mainboard, additional sensors, peripherals, a\n   power adapter/battery,\
    \ and a case have to be taken into\n   consideration.  Finally, there are cost\
    \ restrictions as well.\n   The situation becomes more challenging when not only\
    \ the hosts are\n   constrained but also the network nodes themselves.\n   While\
    \ there are constantly improvements being made, Moore's law tends\n   to be less\
    \ effective in the embedded system space than in personal\n   computing devices:\
    \ gains made available by increases in transistor\n   count and density are more\
    \ likely to be invested in reductions of\n   cost and power requirements than\
    \ into continual increases in\n   computing power.\n"

    \ to the Internet,\n   there are many challenges the workshop participants raised\
    \ in more\n   than 70 accepted position papers.  With a single workshop day,\n\
    \   discussions had to be focused, and priority was given to those topics\n  \
    \ that had been raised by many authors.  A summary of the identified\n   issues\
    \ are captured in the subsections below.\n"

    \ regarding the separation of traffic, the need for profiling\n   for application-specific\
    \ domains, the demand for data-model-specific\n   standardization, as well as\
    \ the design choices regarding the layer at\n   which functionality should be\
    \ put were discussed and are briefly\n   summarized below.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  One Internet vs. Islands
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  One Internet vs. Islands\n   Devices that used to be in proprietary or\
    \ application-specific\n   networks are today migrating to IP networks.  There\
    \ is, however, the\n   question of whether these smart objects are now on the\
    \ same IP\n   network as any other application.  Controlled applications, like\
    \ the\n   fountains in front of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas that are\n   operated\
    \ as a distributed control system [Dolin], probably are not\n   exchanging their\
    \ control messages over the same network that is also\n   used by hotel guests\
    \ for their Internet traffic.  The same had been\n   argued for smart grids, which\
    \ are described as follows in\n   [SmartGrid]:\n      A smart grid is a digitally\
    \ enabled electrical grid that gathers,\n      distributes, and acts on information\
    \ about the behavior of all\n      participants (suppliers and consumers) in order\
    \ to improve the\n      efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability\
    \ of\n      electricity services.\n   The question that was raised during the\
    \ workshop is, therefore, in\n   what sense are we talking about one Internet\
    \ or about using IP\n   technology for a separate, \"walled garden\" network that\
    \ is\n   independent of the Internet?\n   Cullen Jennings compared the current\
    \ state of smart object deployment\n   with the evolution of Voice over IP (VoIP):\
    \ \"Initially, many vendors\n   recommended to run VoIP over a separate VLAN or\
    \ a separate\n   infrastructure.  Nobody could imagine how to make the type of\
    \ real-\n   time guarantees, how to debug it, and how to get it to work because\n\
    \   the Internet is not ideally suited for making any types of guarantees\n  \
    \ for real-time systems.  As time went on, people got better at making\n   voice\
    \ work across that type of IP network.  They suddenly noticed\n   that having\
    \ voice running on a separate virtual network than their\n   other applications\
    \ was a disaster.  They couldn't decide if a PC was\n   running a softphone and\
    \ whether it went on a voice or a data network.\n   At that point, people realized\
    \ that they needed a converged network\n   and all moved to one.  I wouldn't be\
    \ surprised to see the same happen\n   here.  Initially, we will see very separated\
    \ networks.  Then, those\n   will be running over the same hardware to take advantage\
    \ of the cost\n   benefits of not having to deploy multiple sets of wires around\n\
    \   buildings.  Over time, there will be strong needs to directly\n   communicate\
    \ with each other.  We need to be designing the system for\n   the long run. \
    \ Assume everything will end up on the same network even\n   if you initially\
    \ plan to run it in separate networks.\"\n   It is clearly possible to let sensors\
    \ in a building communicate\n   through the wireless access points and through\
    \ the same\n   infrastructure used for Internet access, if you want to.  Those\
    \ who\n   want separation at the physical layer can do so as well.  What is\n\
    \   important is to make sure that these different deployment\n   philosophies\
    \ do not force loss of interoperability.\n   The level of interoperability that\
    \ IP accomplished fostered\n   innovation at the application layer.  Ralph Droms\
    \ reinforced this\n   message by saying: \"Bright people will take a phone, build\
    \ an\n   application and connect it, with the appropriate security controls in\n\
    \   place, to the things in my house in ways we have never thought about\n   before.\
    \  Otherwise, we are just building another telephone network.\"\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Domain-Specific Stacks and Profiles
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Domain-Specific Stacks and Profiles\n   Imagine a building network scenario\
    \ where a new light bulb is\n   installed that should, out of the box without\
    \ further configuration,\n   interoperate with the already present light switch\
    \ from a different\n   vendor in the room.  For many, this is the desired level\
    \ of\n   interoperability in the area of smart object design.  To accomplish\n\
    \   this level of interoperability, it is not sufficient to provide\n   interoperability\
    \ only at the network layer.  Even running the same\n   transport protocol and\
    \ application-layer protocol (e.g., HTTP) is\n   insufficient since both devices\
    \ need to understand the semantics of\n   the payloads for \"Turn the light on\"\
    \ as well.\n   Standardizing the entire protocol stack for this specific \"light\n\
    \   switch / light bulb\" scenario is possible.  A possible stack would,\n   for\
    \ example, use IPv6 with a specific address configuration mechanism\n   (such\
    \ as stateless address autoconfiguration), a network access\n   authentication\
    \ security mechanism such as Protocol for carrying\n   Authentication for Network\
    \ Access (PANA) [RFC5191], a service\n   discovery mechanism (e.g., multicast\
    \ DNS with DNS-Based Service\n   Discovery [DNS-SD]), an application-layer protocol,\
    \ for example,\n   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [CoAP] (which uses\
    \ UDP), and\n   the syntax and semantic for the light on/off functionality.\n\
    \   As this list shows, there is already some amount of protocol\n   functionality\
    \ that has to be agreed on by various stakeholders to\n   make this scenario work\
    \ seamlessly.  As we approach more complex\n   protocol interactions, the functionality\
    \ quickly becomes more\n   complex: IPv4 and IPv6 on the network layer, various\
    \ options at the\n   transport layer (such as UDP, TCP, the Stream Control Transmission\n\
    \   Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960], and the Datagram Congestion Control\n   Protocol\
    \ (DCCP) [RFC4340]), and there are plenty of choices at the\n   application layer\
    \ with respect to communication protocols, data\n   formats and data models. \
    \ Different requirements have led to the\n   development of a variety of communication\
    \ protocols: client-server\n   protocols in the style of the original HTTP, publish-subscribe\n\
    \   protocols (like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] or\n   Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6121]), and\n   store-and-forward\
    \ messaging (borrowed from the delay tolerant\n   networking community).  Along\
    \ with the different application-layer\n   communication protocols come various\
    \ identity and security\n   mechanisms.\n   With the smart object constraints,\
    \ it feels natural to develop these\n   stacks since each application domain (e.g.,\
    \ healthcare, smart grids,\n   building networking) will have their unique requirements\
    \ and their\n   own community involved in the design process.  How likely are\
    \ these\n   profiles going to be the right match for the future, specifically\
    \ for\n   the new innovations that will come?  How many of these stacks are we\n\
    \   going to have?  Will the differences in the profiles purely be the\n   result\
    \ of different requirements coming from the individual\n   application domains\
    \ or will these mismatches reflect the spirit,\n   understanding, and preferences\
    \ of the community designing them?  How\n   many stacks will multipurpose devices\
    \ have to implement?\n   Standardizing profiles independently for each application\
    \ is not the\n   only option.  Another option is to let many different applications\n\
    \   utilize a common foundation, i.e., a protocol stack that is\n   implemented\
    \ and utilized by every device.  This, however, requires\n   various application\
    \ domains to be analyzed for their common\n   characteristics and to identify\
    \ requirements that are common across\n   all of them.  The level of difficulty\
    \ for finding an agreement of how\n   such a foundation stack should look depends\
    \ on how many layers it\n   covers and how lightweight it has to be.\n   From\
    \ the discussions at the workshop, it was clear that the available\n   options\
    \ are not ideal and further discussions are needed.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Which Layer?
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Which Layer?\n   The end-to-end principle states that functionality should\
    \ be put into\n   the end points instead of into the networks.  An additional\n\
    \   recommendation, which is equally important, is to put functionality\n   higher\
    \ up in the protocol stack.  While it is useful to make common\n   functionality\
    \ available as building blocks to higher layers, the wide\n   range of requirements\
    \ by different applications led to a model where\n   lower layers provide only\
    \ very basic functionality and more\n   sophisticated features were made available\
    \ by various applications.\n   Still, there has been the desire to put application-layer\n\
    \   functionality into the lower layers of the networking stack.  A\n   common\
    \ belief is that performance benefits can be gained if\n   functionality is placed\
    \ at the lower layers of the protocol stack.\n   This new functionality may be\
    \ offered in the form of a gateway, which\n   bridges different communication\
    \ technologies, acts on behalf of other\n   nodes, and offers more generic functionality\
    \ (such as name-based\n   routing and caching).\n   Two examples of functionality\
    \ offered at the network layer and\n   discussed during the workshops were location\
    \ and name-based routing:\n   Location:\n      The notion of location gives each\
    \ network node the understanding\n      of proximity (e.g., 'I am a light bulb\
    \ and in the same room as the\n      light switch.').  Today, a router may provide\
    \ information as to\n      whether other nodes belong to the same subnet or they\
    \ may provide\n      location information (for example, in the form of GPS-based\n\
    \      coordinates).  However, providing a sense of the specific\n      environment\
    \ (e.g., a room, building, campus, etc.) is not possible\n      without manual\
    \ configuration.  While it has been a desirable\n      feature for many ubiquitous\

  - "3.2.  Sleeping Nodes\n   One limitation of smart objects is their available energy.\
    \  To extend\n   battery life, for example, of a watch battery or single AAA battery\n\
    \   for months, these low-power devices have to sleep 99% to 99.5% of\n   their\
    \ time.  For example, a light sensor may only wake up to check\n   whether it\
    \ is nighttime to turn on light bulbs.  Most parts of the\n   system, particularly\
    \ communication components, are put into a\n   sleeping state (e.g., WLAN radio\
    \ interface) and selected components,\n   such as sensors, periodically check\
    \ for relevant events and, if\n   necessary, turn on other hardware modules. \
    \ Every bit is precious, as\n   is every round trip and every millisecond of radio\
    \ activity.\n   Many IETF protocols are implicitly designed to be always on, i.e.,\n\
    \   the protocol implementation waits for and reacts to incoming\n   messages,\
    \ and may maintain session state (at various layers of the\n   stack).  These\
    \ protocols work well when energy consumption is not a\n   concern and when receiving\
    \ and sending messages happen at a low cost.\n   It should be understood that\
    \ energy is consumed both in transmitting\n   messages (and often more importantly)\
    \ in keeping the receiver awake.\n   Allowing devices to sleep most of the time\
    \ preserves energy but\n   creates challenges for protocol designs.\n   The inherent\
    \ issue encountered by a stationary node resuming from\n   sleep is that another\
    \ node may have chosen the same address while the\n   node was asleep.  A number\
    \ of steps have to be taken before sending a\n   packet.  A new address may have\
    \ to be obtained, for example using the\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\
    \ (DHCP) or stateless address\n   autoconfiguration.  Optionally, Detecting Network\
    \ Attachment (DNA)\n   procedures (see [RFC4436] and [RFC6059]) can be used to\
    \ shorten the\n   setup time by noticing that the node is using the same default\n\
    \   gateway.\n   The issue with a mobile node that is sleeping is that the node\
    \ may\n   have been moved to another network (e.g., a sleeping laptop being\n\
    \   transported to a new environment) where on resumption it may discover\n  \
    \ that its address has become invalid.\n   The following design considerations\
    \ should be taken into account when\n   energy efficiency is a concern:\n   1.\
    \  Rethink the Always-On Assumption\n       When designing a protocol that assumes\
    \ that the nodes are always\n       on, alternatives need to be considered.  This\
    \ could involve\n       eliminating functionality (e.g., not implementing DNA\
    \ or\n       duplicate address detection) or considering the use of a sleep\n\
    \       proxy.  While sleep proxies (e.g., proxZzzy(TM) [proxZzzy])\n       enable\
    \ periodic messages to be sent on behalf of sleeping nodes,\n       this approach\
    \ assumes that energy management constraints do not\n       apply to the sleep\
    \ proxy, which may not always be the case (e.g.,\n       if the entire network\
    \ is deployed in the field without access to\n       power).  Yet another option\
    \ is for devices to explicitly\n       communicate sleep cycles so that they can\
    \ only check for messages\n       periodically (be it measured in milliseconds,\
    \ seconds, or hours).\n       This is the approach taken in IEEE 802.11, which\
    \ supports\n       multiple energy conservation mechanisms designed to enable\
    \ a\n       station to spend a large fraction of the time sleeping.\n   2.  Reduce\
    \ Network Attachment Costs\n       As noted above, the procedures for obtaining\
    \ an address and\n       assuring its uniqueness can be costly.  In a network\
    \ where nodes\n       spend a large fraction of the time sleeping, but are not\n\
    \       necessarily mobile, are all of these procedures really necessary?\n  \
    \     Can we find ways to reduce the number of protocol interactions\n       without\
    \ sacrificing correctness?  The main focus of past\n       investigations has\
    \ been on IPv6 and ND, but other protocols do\n       also deserve a deeper investigation,\
    \ such as DNS and DHCP.\n   3.  Avoid Verbose Protocols\n       Protocols involving\
    \ multiple roundtrips and/or lengthy messages\n       with verbose encodings (e.g.,\
    \ XML) are not always well-suited for\n       constrained environments.  Low-power\
    \ nodes utilizing verbose\n       protocols have to use more energy in sending\
    \ messages and have to\n       stay powered on for a longer period of time as\
    \ they wait for the\n       multi-roundtrip protocol exchanges to complete.\n\
    \       The best way to address these problems is to ensure that the\n       simplest\
    \ possible protocol exchanges are used when the protocols\n       in question\
    \ are designed.  In some cases, alternative encoding\n       formats and compression\
    \ may also help.\n   4.  Think about System-Wide Efficiency\n       While energy\
    \ efficiency is critical for low-power devices running\n       on batteries, it\
    \ is also beneficial for other devices as well,\n       including notebook computers,\
    \ desktop computers, and smartphones.\n       However, if the goal is energy efficiency\
    \ as opposed to battery\n       life extension for low-power devices, then it\
    \ is important to\n       consider the total energy consumption of all the elements\
    \ of the\n       system.\n       For example, consider energy consumption in a\
    \ home environment.\n       In these scenarios it is important to evaluate the\
    \ energy usage\n       of the entire system.  A light bulb utilizing Internet\
    \ technology\n       described in this document may use less power but there is\
    \ also\n       the device that controls the bulb that may consume a lot of\n \
    \      energy.  If the goal is to reduce overall energy usage, then it\n     \
    \  is important to consider these two devices (and potentially many\n       others)\
    \ together.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Security
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Security\n   In the development of smart object applications, as with any\
    \ other\n   protocol application solution, security has to be considered early\
    \ in\n   the design process.  As such, the recommendations currently provided\n\
    \   to IETF protocol architects, such as RFC 3552 [RFC3552] and RFC 4101\n   [RFC4101],\
    \ apply also to the smart object space.\n   While there are additional constraints,\
    \ as described in Section 2,\n   security has to be a mandatory part of the solution.\
    \  The hope is\n   that this will lead to implementations that provide security\n\
    \   features, deployments that utilize them, and finally use of better\n   security\
    \ mechanisms.  It is important to point out that the lack of\n   direct user interaction\
    \ will place hard requirements on deployment\n   models, configuration mechanisms,\
    \ and software upgrade /\n   crypto-agility mechanisms.\n   Since many of the\
    \ security mechanisms allow for customization,\n   particularly with regard to\
    \ the cryptographic primitives utilized,\n   many believe that IETF security solutions\
    \ are usable without\n   modifications in a large part of the smart object domain.\
    \  Others\n   call for new work on cryptographic primitives that make use of a\n\
    \   single primitive (such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n   [AES])\
    \ as a building block for all cryptographic functions.  The\n   benefit would\
    \ be a smaller footprint of the overall solution,\n   specifically with respect\
    \ to hardware limitations (e.g., the hardware\n   architecture of certain embedded\
    \ devices prevents pipelining from\n   being used).  In the excitement for new\
    \ work on optimizations of\n   cryptographic primitives, other factors have to\
    \ be taken into\n   consideration that influence successful deployment, such as\n\
    \   widespread support in libraries, as well as intellectual property\n   rights\
    \ (IPR).  As an example of the latter aspect, the struggle of\n   Elliptic Curve\
    \ Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic algorithms\n   [ECC] to find deployment\
    \ can partially be attributed to its IPR\n   situation.  The reuse of libraries\
    \ providing cryptographic functions\n   is clearly an important way to use available\
    \ memory resources in a\n   more efficient way.  To deal with the performance\
    \ and footprint\n   concerns, investigations into offloading certain resource-hungry\n\
    \   functions to parties that possess more cryptographic power have been\n   considered.\
    \  For example, the ability to delegate certificate\n   validation to servers\
    \ has been standardized in the IETF before, for\n   the support of the Online\
    \ Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in the\n   Internet Key Exchange protocol\
    \ version 2 (IKEv2) and in Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS); see [RFC4806] and\
    \ [RFC5246], respectively.\n   Focusing only on the cryptographic primitives would\
    \ be shortsighted;\n   many would argue that this is the easy part of a smart\
    \ object\n   security solution.  Key management and credential enrollment,\n \
    \  however, are considered a big challenge by many, particularly when\n   usability\
    \ requirements have to be taken into account.  Another group\n   of challenges\
    \ concern privacy; with smart grids, for example, some\n   have voiced concerns\
    \ regarding the ability of third parties to keep\n   track of an individual's\
    \ energy consumption (and draw associated\n   conclusions).  As another example,\
    \ it is easy to see how a scale that\n   is connected to the Internet for uploading\
    \ weight information to a\n   social network could lead to privacy concerns. \
    \ While security\n   mechanisms that are used to offer protection of the communication\n\
    \   between different parties also provide a certain degree of privacy\n   protection,\
    \ they are clearly not enough to address all concerns.\n   Even with the best\
    \ communication security and access control\n   mechanisms in place, one still\
    \ needs additional safeguards against\n   the concerns mentioned in the examples.\n\
    \   While better deployment of security protocols on the entire Internet\n   would\
    \ be very desirable, practical considerations regarding usability\n   and the\
    \ incentives of the stakeholders involved have often lead to\n   slower adoption.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Routing
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Routing\n   A smart object network environment may also employ routers\
    \ under\n   similar constraints as the end devices.  Currently two approaches\
    \ to\n   routing in these low-power and lossy networks are under consideration\n\
    \   -- namely, mesh-under and route-over.  The so-called \"mesh-under\"\n   approach\
    \ places routing functions at the link layer, and consequently\n   all devices\
    \ appear as immediate neighbors at the network layer.  With\n   the \"route-over\"\
    \ approach, routing is done in the IP layer and not at\n   all in the link layer.\
    \  Each physical hop appears as a single IP hop\n   (ignoring devices that just\
    \ extend the physical range of signaling,\n   such as repeaters).  Routing in\
    \ this context means running a routing\n   protocol.  The IPv6 Routing Protocol\
    \ for Low-power and Lossy Networks\n   (RPL) [RPL], for example, belongs to the\
    \ route-over category.\n   From an architectural point of view there are several\
    \ questions that\n   arise from where routing is provided, for example:\n   o\
    \  Protocols often assume that link characteristics are predictable\n      when\
    \ communicating with any device attached to the same link.\n      Latency, throughput,\
    \ and reliability may vary considerably between\n      different devices that\
    \ are multiple link-layer hops away.  What\n      timeout should be used?  What\
    \ happens if a device is unreachable?\n      In case of default router selection,\
    \ two advertised routers may be\n      a different number of hops away.  Should\
    \ a device have visibility\n      into the path to make a decision, and what path\
    \ characteristics\n      would be useful to have?\n   o  Scoped message delivery\
    \ to a neighboring IP hop (via link-local\n      addressing) allows certain types\
    \ of IP protocols to communicate\n      with their immediate neighbors and to\
    \ therefore scope their\n      recipients.  A link-local multicast message will\
    \ be received by\n      all nodes in the same IP link-local realm unless some\
    \ special\n      optimizations are provided by the link layer.\n   o  When path\
    \ computations are done at the link layer as well as on\n      the network layer,\
    \ then what coordination needs to take place?\n   When multiple different link-layer\
    \ technologies are involved in a\n   network design, routing at layer 3 has to\
    \ be provided in any case.\n   [IoT-ARCH] talks about these tradeoffs between\
    \ route-over and mesh-\n   under in detail.  Furthermore, those who decide about\
    \ the deployment\n   have to determine how to connect smart objects to the Internet\n\
    \   infrastructure, and a number of wired and wireless technologies may\n   be\
    \ suitable for a specific deployment.  Depending on the chosen\n   technologies\
    \ the above-mentioned mesh-under vs. route-over approach\n   will have to be decided,\
    \ and further decisions will have to be made\n   about the choice of a specific\
    \ routing protocol.\n   In 2008, the IETF formed the Routing Over Low power and\
    \ Lossy\n   networks (ROLL) working group to specify a routing solution for smart\n\
    \   object environments.  During its first year of existence, the working\n  \
    \ group studied routing requirements in detail (see [RFC5867],\n   [RFC5826],\
    \ [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]), and it worked on a protocol\n   survey comparing\
    \ a number of existing routing protocols, including Ad\n   hoc On-Demand Distance\
    \ Vector (AODV)-style protocols [RFC3561],\n   against the identified requirements.\
    \  The protocol survey\n   [PROT-SURVEY] was inconclusive and abandoned without\
    \ giving rise to\n   publication of an RFC.\n   The ROLL WG concluded that a new\
    \ routing protocol satisfying the\n   documented requirements has to be developed\
    \ and the work on RPL was\n   started as the IETF routing protocol for smart object\
    \ networks.\n   Nevertheless, controversial discussions at the workshop about\
    \ which\n   routing protocols is best in a given environment are still ongoing.\n\
    \   Thomas Clausen, for example, argued for using an AODV-like routing\n   protocol\
    \ in [Clausen].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Conclusions and Next Steps\n   The workshop allowed the participants to be\
    \ exposed to interesting\n   applications and their requirements (buildings, fountains,\
    \ theater,\n   etc.), to have discussions about radically different architectures\n\
    \   and their issues (e.g., information centric networking), to look at\n   existing\
    \ technology from a new angle (sleeping nodes, energy\n   consumption), to focus\
    \ on some details of the protocol stack\n   (neighbor discovery, security, routing)\
    \ and to learn about\n   implementation experience.\n   One goal of the workshop\
    \ was to identify areas that require further\n   investigation.  The list below\
    \ reflects the thoughts of the workshop\n   participants as expressed on the day\
    \ of the workshop.  Note that the\n   suggested items concern potential work by\
    \ the IETF and the IRTF, and\n   the order does not imply a particular preference.\n\
    \   Security:\n      A discussion of security is provided in Section 3.3.  In\
    \ general,\n      security-related protocol exchanges and the required amount\
    \ of\n      computational resource requirements can contribute significantly\n\
    \      to the overall processing.  Therefore, it remains a challenge to\n    \
    \  accomplish performance improvements without sacrificing the\n      overall\
    \ security level, taking the usability of the entire system\n      into consideration.\n\
    \      Another challenge is how to balance the security and performance\n    \
    \  needs of smart objects with the interoperability requirements of\n      hosts\
    \ on the Internet since different suites of algorithms tend to\n      be chosen\
    \ for these different environments.  This involves trade-\n      offs between\
    \ performance on the smart objects versus end-to-end\n      security.  Solutions\
    \ that mandate a \"trusted\" middlebox whose only\n      role is to terminate\
    \ security associations tend to be frowned upon\n      from the security perspective,\
    \ especially since end users of\n      challenged devices (where those exist)\
    \ are unlikely to understand\n      the security consequences of such middleboxes.\n\
    \      The discussion concluded with the following recommendations:\n      * \
    \ Investigate usability in cryptographic protocol design with\n         regard\
    \ to credential management.  As an example, the Bluetooth\n         pairing mechanism\
    \ was mentioned as a simple and yet reasonably\n         secure method of introducing\
    \ devices into a new environment.\n         In fact, the IETF working group Credential\
    \ and Provisioning\n         (ENROLL) was established years ago to deal with residential\n\
    \         networks but was terminated prematurely due to lack of\n         progress.\
    \  The email archive still exists and is available\n         [ENROLL] and may\
    \ provide useful historical information.\n      *  Standardized authentication\
    \ and key exchange mechanisms should\n         be surveyed for suitability in\
    \ smart object environments with\n         respect to message size, computational\
    \ performance, number of\n         messages, code size, and main memory requirements.\
    \  A starting\n         point of such an investigation (in the case of IKEv2)\
    \ was\n         provided by Tero Kivinen with [MINIMAL-IKEv2], and a suitable\n\
    \         venue for discussion could be the recently established Light-\n    \
    \     Weight Implementation Guidance (LWIG) working group [LWIG].\n      *  Research\
    \ has to be done in the area of lightweight\n         cryptographic primitives\
    \ -- namely, block ciphers, stream\n         ciphers, and cryptographic hash functions.\
    \  It's worthwhile to\n         mention the early work with the National Institute\
    \ of Standards\n         and Technology (NIST) new cryptographic hash algorithm\
    \ 'SHA-3'\n         competition [SHA3].  A suitable forum for discussion is the\n\
    \         IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) [CFRG].\n      The difficulty\
    \ and impact of choosing specialized algorithms for\n      smart objects should\
    \ not be underestimated.  Issues that arise\n      include the additional specification\
    \ complexity (e.g., TLS already\n      has hundreds of ciphersuites defined, most\
    \ of which are unused in\n      practice), the long latency in terms of roll out\
    \ (many hosts are\n      still using deprecated algorithms 5-10 years after those\n\
    \      algorithms were deprecated), and the barriers that IPR-encumbered\n   \
    \   schemes present to widespread deployment.  While research on this\n      topic\
    \ within CFRG and the cryptographic research community is a\n      very worthwhile\
    \ goal, any such algorithms will likely have to\n      offer very significant\
    \ benefits before they will be broadly\n      adopted. 20% less CPU usage is unlikely\
    \ to be a winning argument\n      no matter what an algorithm inventor believes.\n\
    \   Energy Design Considerations:\n      One part of the workshop was focused\
    \ on the discussion of energy\n      implications for IETF protocol design with\
    \ proposals being made\n      about how to extend protocols to better support\
    \ nodes that are\n      mostly sleeping.  Discussions are encouraged to take place\
    \ on the\n      RECIPE mailing list [RECIPE].  The workshop position paper\n \
    \     [Wasserman] by Margaret Wasserman provides a good starting point\n     \
    \ for further investigations.\n   Information-/Content-Centric Networking:\n \
    \     Information/Content Centric Networking is about accessing named\n      content,\
    \ and a number of research projects have emerged around\n      this theme.  At\
    \ this point in time, the work is not yet ready for\n      standardization in\
    \ the IETF.  Instead, the formation of an IRTF\n      research group has been\
    \ proposed, and more details are available\n      on the IRTF DISCUSS mailing\
    \ list [irtf-discuss].\n   Architectural Guidelines:\n      Participants suggested\
    \ developing an architectural write-up about\n      what can be done with the\
    \ IETF protocols we have today and how\n      these different elements may be\
    \ combined to offer an explanation\n      for the broader community.  This would\
    \ be a task for the IAB.  An\n      example of prior work that serves as input\
    \ is [RFC6272].\n   Network Management:\n      While this topic did not make it\
    \ onto the workshop agenda, it was\n      considered useful to start a discussion\
    \ about how to implement\n      network management protocols, such as Network\
    \ Configuration\n      Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241], on smart objects.  The following\n\
    \      position papers may be useful as a starting point for further\n      discussions:\
    \ [Ersue] and [Schoenwaelder].  An IETF draft document\n      is also available:\
    \ [SNMP-OPT].\n   Congestion Control:\n      When smart objects transmit sensor\
    \ readings to some server on the\n      Internet, these protocol interactions\
    \ often carry a small amount\n      of data and happen infrequently, although\
    \ regularly.  With the\n      work on new application protocols, like CoAP [CoAP],\
    \ the question\n      of whether a congestion control mechanism should be used\
    \ at the\n      underlying transport protocol or by the application protocol\n\
    \      itself arises.  [CoAP-CC] is a starting point for CoAP, but\n      further\
    \ work is needed.\n   Data Models:\n      Standardization of application-layer\
    \ protocols is important but\n      does not ensure that, for example, a light\
    \ switch and a light bulb\n      are able to interact with each other.  One area\
    \ where participants\n      saw the need for further work was in the area of data\
    \ models.\n      While prior IETF standardization work on, for example, location\n\
    \      [GEOPRIV] can be reused, the question was raised where the IETF\n     \
    \ should focus its standardization efforts since domain expertise in\n      each\
    \ area will be needed.  As a potential example, energy pricing\n      was discussed,\
    \ with an example provided by [ENERGY-PRICING].\n   Building Networking:\n   \
    \   Network architectures in residential as well as commercial\n      buildings\
    \ should take the presence of smart objects and dedicated\n      subnetworks focusing\
    \ on smart objects into account.  A new working\n      group, Home Networking\
    \ (HOMENET) [HOMENET], was created after the\n      workshop to look at this topic.\n\
    \   Discovery:\n      Additional extensions to developed discovery protocols,\
    \ such as\n      multicast DNS (mDNS), may be needed for the smart object\n  \
    \    environment.  For instance, the HOMENET working group wants to\n      extend\
    \ current discovery protocols to work across multiple\n      subnets.  Smart object\
    \ networks are often organized in separate\n      subnets, so these extensions\
    \ may be useful in that environment as\n      well.\n   Routing:\n      Changing\
    \ radio conditions and link fluctuation may lead to the\n      need for renumbering.\
    \  Workshop participants argued that work\n      should be started on the multi-link\
    \ subnetworks to mitigate this\n      problem, i.e., to extend the notion of a\
    \ subnet to be able to span\n      multiple links.  With the publication of RFC\
    \ 4903 [RFC4903], the\n      Internet Architecture Board had looked into this\
    \ topic already and\n      provided pros and cons.\n      The applicability of\
    \ specific routing protocols designed for smart\n      object networks needs further\
    \ investigation.  The ROLL working\n      group is chartered with the task of\
    \ constructing an applicability\n      document for RPL, for instance.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The workshop discussions covered a range of potential\
    \ engineering\n   activities, each with its own security considerations.  As the\
    \ IETF\n   community begins to pursue specific avenues arising out of this\n \
    \  workshop, addressing relevant security requirements will be crucial.\n   As\
    \ described in this report, part of the agenda was focused on the\n   discussion\
    \ of security; see Section 3.3.\n"
