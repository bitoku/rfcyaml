  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community are\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update\
    \ message used by an\n   ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any changes\
    \ to its set\n   of valid Locators.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than\
    \ one engineering\n   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\
    \n   engineering design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents,\
    \ we describe two specific engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\"\
    \ refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and backwards\
    \ compatible with, IPv6.  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n   refers precisely to an instance\
    \ of ILNP that is based upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many\
    \ engineering aspects common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].\
    \  A full engineering specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents\
    \ for details not\n   described here:\n   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural\
    \ description of ILNP, including\n      the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741]\
    \ describes engineering and implementation considerations\n      that are common\
    \ to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6742] defines additional DNS resource\
    \ records that support\n      ILNP.\n   d) [RFC6744] defines a new IPv6 Nonce\
    \ Destination Option used by\n      ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate to ILNP correspondent\
    \ nodes (by\n      inclusion within the initial packets of an ILNP session) that\
    \ the\n      node is operating in the ILNP mode and (2) to prevent off-path\n\
    \      attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.  This Nonce is used, for\n      example,\
    \ with all ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update messages that are\n      exchanged among\
    \ ILNP correspondent nodes.\n   e) [RFC6745] defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update\
    \ message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any\
    \ changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n   f) [RFC6746] defines a new\
    \ IPv4 Nonce Option used by ILNPv4 nodes to\n      carry a security nonce to prevent\
    \ off-path attacks against ILNP\n      ICMP messages and also defines a new IPv4\
    \ Identifier Option used\n      by ILNPv4 nodes.\n   g) [RFC6747] describes extensions\
    \ to the Address Resolution Protocol\n      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n   h)\
    \ [RFC6748] describes optional engineering and deployment functions\n      for\
    \ ILNP.  These are not required for the operation or use of ILNP\n      and are\
    \ provided as additional options.\n"
- title: 1.2.  ICMPv6 Locator Update
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ICMPv6 Locator Update\n   As described in [RFC6740] and [RFC6741], an ILNP\
    \ for IPv6 (ILNPv6)\n   node might need to inform correspondent ILNPv6 nodes of\
    \ changes to\n   the set of valid Locator values.  The new ICMPv6 Locator Update\n\
    \   message described in this document enables an ILNP-capable node to\n   update\
    \ its correspondents about the currently valid set of Locators\n   valid to use\
    \ in reaching the node sending this message [RFC2460]\n   [RFC4443].\n   This\
    \ new ICMPv6 message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv6 sessions.\n   Authentication\
    \ is always required, as described in the Security\n   Considerations section\
    \ later in this note.\n   Some might consider any and all use of ICMP to be undesirable.\
    \  In\n   that context, please note that while this specification uses ICMP, on\n\
    \   grounds that this is a control message, there is no architectural\n   difference\
    \ between using ICMP and using some other framing (for\n   example, UDP).\n"

    \ ESP is able to protect an IPv6\n   option that appears prior to the ESP header.\n\
    \   Note that even when IP Security for ILNP is in use, the ILNP Nonce\n   Option\
    \ still MUST be present.  This simplifies protocol processing,\n   and it also\
    \ means that a receiver can perform the inexpensive check\n   of the Nonce value\

  contents:
  - "3.  Transport Protocol Effects\n   This message has no impact on any transport\
    \ protocol.\n   The message may affect where packets for a given transport-layer\n\
    \   session are sent, but an ILNP design objective is to decouple\n   transport-layer\
    \ protocols and transport-layer session information\n   from network-layer changes.\n"
- title: 4.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementation Considerations\n   Implementers may use any internal implementation\
    \ they wish, provided\n   that the external appearance is the same as this implementation\n\
    \   approach.\n   To support ILNPv6, and to retain the incremental deployability\
    \ and\n   backwards compatibility needed, the network layer needs a mode bit in\n\
    \   the Transport Control Block (or its equivalent) to track which IP\n   sessions\
    \ are using the classic IPv6 mode and which IP sessions are\n   using the Identifier/Locator\
    \ Split mode.\n   Further, when supporting ILNPv4, nodes will need to support\
    \ an\n   Identifier Locator Communication Cache (ILCC) in the network layer as\n\
    \   described in [RFC6741].\n   A node sending an ICMP Locator Update message\
    \ MUST include all\n   currently valid Locator values in that message.  A node\
    \ receiving a\n   valid ICMP Locator Update message MUST replace the previously\
    \ current\n   set of Locator values for that correspondent node in its own ILCC\n\
    \   with the newly received set of Locator values.\n   Every implementation needs\
    \ to support a large number of Locator\n   values being sent or received in a\
    \ single ICMP Locator Update\n   message, because a multihomed node or multihomed\
    \ site might have a\n   large number of upstream links to different service providers,\
    \ each\n   with its own Locator value.\n"
- title: 5.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backwards Compatibility\n   This ICMPv6 message uses the same checksum calculations\
    \ as any other\n   ICMPv6 message.\n   When ILNPv6 is not in use, the receiving\
    \ IPv6 mode MUST discard the\n   ICMP Locator Update packet without processing\
    \ the packet.  This is\n   standard behaviour for a non-ILNPv6 node when receiving\
    \ an ICMPv6\n   message with an unknown header field value.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the overall ILNP\
    \ architecture are\n   described in [RFC6740].  Additional common security considerations\n\
    \   are described in [RFC6741].  This section describes security\n   considerations\
    \ specific to ILNPv6 topics discussed in this document.\n   The ICMPv6 Locator\
    \ Update message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv6\n   sessions.\n   The ILNP Nonce\
    \ Destination Option [RFC6744] MUST be present in\n   packets containing an ICMPv6\
    \ Locator Update message.  Further, the\n   received Nonce Destination Option\
    \ MUST contain the correct nonce\n   value for the packet to be accepted by the\
    \ recipient and then passed\n   to the ICMPv6 protocol for processing.  If either\
    \ of these\n   requirements are not met, the received packet MUST be discarded\
    \ as a\n   forgery, and a security event SHOULD be logged by the system\n   receiving\
    \ the non-authentic packet.\n   ILNP sessions operating in higher risk environments\
    \ SHOULD use IP\n   Security for ILNP [RFC6741] [RFC4301] *in addition* to the\
    \ ILNPv6\n   Nonce Destination Option.  Use of IP Security for ILNP to protect\
    \ a\n   packet does NOT permit the packet to be sent without the Nonce\n   Destination\
    \ Option.\n   Implementations need to support the case where a single ICMP Locator\n\
    \   Update message contains a large number of Locator and Preference\n   values\
    \ and ought not develop a security fault (e.g., stack overflow)\n   due to a received\
    \ message containing more Locator values than\n   expected.\n   If the ILNP Nonce\
    \ value is predictable, then an off-path attacker\n   might be able to forge data\
    \ or control packets.  This risk also is\n   mitigated by the existing common\
    \ practice of IP Source Address\n   filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].\n"
