  - "1. Abstract\n   This document describes an LDAPv3 control extension for simple\
    \ paging\n   of search results. This control extension allows a client to control\n\
    \   the rate at which an LDAP server returns the results of an LDAP\n   search\
    \ operation. This control may be useful when the LDAP client has\n   limited resources\
    \ and may not be able to process the entire result\n   set from a given LDAP query,\
    \ or when the LDAP client is connected\n   over a low-bandwidth connection. Other\
    \ operations on the result set\n   are not defined in this extension. This extension\
    \ is not designed to\n   provide more sophisticated result set management.\n \
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" used in this document are\n\
    \   to be interpreted as described in [bradner97].\n"

- title: 3. Client-Server Interaction
  contents:
  - "3. Client-Server Interaction\n   An LDAP client application that needs to control\
    \ the rate at which\n   results are returned MAY specify on the searchRequest\
    \ a\n   pagedResultsControl with size set to the desired page size and cookie\n\
    \   set to the zero-length string. The page size specified MAY be greater\n  \
    \ than zero and less than the sizeLimit value specified in the\n   searchRequest.\n\
    \   If the page size is greater than or equal to the sizeLimit value, the\n  \
    \ server should ignore the control as the request can be satisfied in a\n   single\
    \ page. If the server does not support this control, the server\n   MUST return\
    \ an error of unsupportedCriticalExtension if the client\n   requested it as critical,\
    \ otherwise the server SHOULD ignore the\n   control. The remainder of this section\
    \ assumes the server does not\n   ignore the client's pagedResultsControl.\n \
    \  Each time the server returns a set of results to the client when\n   processing\
    \ a search request containing the pagedResultsControl, the\n   server includes\
    \ the pagedResultsControl control in the\n   searchResultDone message. In the\
    \ control returned to the client, the\n   size MAY be set to the server's estimate\
    \ of the total number of\n   entries in the entire result set. Servers that cannot\
    \ provide such an\n   estimate MAY set this size to zero (0).  The cookie MUST\
    \ be set to an\n   empty value if there are no more entries to return (i.e., the\
    \ page of\n   search results returned was the last), or, if there are more entries\n\
    \   to return, to an octet string of the server's choosing,used to resume\n  \
    \ the search.\n   The client MUST consider the cookie to be an opaque structure\
    \ and\n   make no assumptions about its internal organization or value. When\n\
    \   the client wants to retrieve more entries for the result set, it MUST\n  \
    \ send to the server a searchRequest with all values identical to the\n   initial\
    \ request with the exception of the messageID, the cookie, and\n   optionally\
    \ a modified pageSize. The cookie MUST be the octet string\n   on the last searchResultDone\
    \ response returned by the server.\n   Returning cookies from previous searchResultDone\
    \ responses besides\n   the last one is undefined, as the server implementation\
    \ may restrict\n   cookies from being reused.\n   The server will then return\
    \ the next set of results from the whole\n   result set. This interaction will\
    \ continue until the client has\n   retrieved all the results, in which case the\
    \ cookie in the\n   searchResultDone field will be empty, or until the client\
    \ abandons\n   the search sequence as described below. Once the paged search\n\
    \   sequence has been completed, the cookie is no longer valid and MUST\n   NOT\
    \ be used.\n   A sequence of paged search requests is abandoned by the client\n\
    \   sending a search request containing a pagedResultsControl with the\n   size\
    \ set to zero (0) and the cookie set to the last cookie returned\n   by the server.\
    \  A client MAY use the LDAP Abandon operation to\n   abandon one paged search\
    \ request in progress, but this is discouraged\n   as it MAY invalidate the client's\
    \ cookie.\n   If, for any reason, the server cannot resume a paged search operation\n\
    \   for a client, then it SHOULD return the appropriate error in a\n   searchResultDone\
    \ entry. If this occurs, both client and server should\n   assume the paged result\
    \ set is closed and no longer resumable.\n   A client may have any number of outstanding\
    \ search requests pending,\n   any of which may have used the pagedResultsControl.\
    \  A server\n   implementation which requires a limit on the number of outstanding\n\
    \   paged search requests from a given client MAY either return\n   unwillingToPerform\
    \ when the client attempts to create a new paged\n   search request, or age out\
    \ an older result set.  If the server\n   implementation ages out an older paged\
    \ search request, it SHOULD\n   return \"unwilling to perform\" if the client\
    \ attempts to resume the\n   paged search that was aged out.\n   A client may\
    \ safely assume that all entries that satisfy a given\n   search query are returned\
    \ once and only once during the set of paged\n   search requests/responses necessary\
    \ to enumerate the entire result\n   set, unless the result set for that query\
    \ has changed since the\n   searchRequest starting the request/response sequence\
    \ was processed.\n   In that case, the client may receive a given entry multiple\
    \ times\n   and/or may not receive all entries matching the given search\n   criteria.\n"

  - "4. Example\n   The following example illustrates the client-server interaction\n\
    \   between a client doing a search requesting a page size limit of 3.\n   The\
    \ entire result set returned by the server contains 5 entries.\n   Lines beginning\
    \ with \"C:\" indicate requests sent from client to\n   server. Lines beginning\
    \ with \"S:\" indicate responses sent from server\n   to client. Lines beginning\
    \ with \"--\" are comments to help explain the\n   example.\n   -- Client sends\
    \ a search request asking for paged results\n   -- with a page size of 3.\n  \
    \ C: SearchRequest + pagedResultsControl(3,\"\")\n   -- Server responds with three\
    \ entries plus an indication\n   -- of 5 total entries in the search result and\
    \ an opaque\n   -- cooking to be used by the client when retrieving subsequent\n\
    \   -- pages.\n   S: SearchResultEntry\n   S: SearchResultEntry\n   S: SearchResultEntry\n\
    \   S: SearchResultDone + pagedResultsControl(5, \"opaque\")\n   -- Client sends\
    \ an identical search request (except for\n   -- message id), returning the opaque\
    \ cooking, asking for\n   -- the next page.\n   C: SearchRequest + PagedResultsControl(3,\
    \ \"opaque\")\n   -- Server responds with two entries plus an indication\n   --\
    \ that there are no more entries (null cookie).\n   S: SearchResultEntry\n   S:\
    \ SearchResultEntry\n   S: SearchResultDone + pagedResultsControl(5,\"\")\n"
- title: 5. Relationship to X.500
  contents:
  - "5. Relationship to X.500\n   For LDAP servers providing a front end to X.500\
    \ (93) directories, the\n   paged results control defined in this document may\
    \ be mapped directly\n   onto the X.500 (93) PagedResultsRequest defined in X.511\
    \ [x500]. The\n   size parameter may be mapped onto pageSize.  The cookie parameter\
    \ may\n   be mapped onto queryReference.  The sortKeys and reverse fields in\n\
    \   the X.500 PagedResultsRequest are excluded.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Server implementors should consider the resources\
    \ used when clients\n   send searches with the simple paged control, to ensure\
    \ that a\n   client's misuse of this control does not lock out other legitimate\n\
    \   operations.\n   Servers implementations may enforce an overriding sizelimit,\
    \ to\n   prevent the retrieval of large portions of a publically-accessible\n\
    \   directory.\n   Clients can, using this control, determine how many entries\
    \ match a\n   particular filter, before the entries are returned to the client.\n\
    \   This may require special processing in servers which perform access\n   control\
    \ checks on entries to determine whether the existence of the\n   entry can be\
    \ disclosed to the client.\n"
