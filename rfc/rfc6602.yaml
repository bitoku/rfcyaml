  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile\n\
    \   IPv6 specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy\n  \
    \ Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session\n   basis.\
    \  In the absence of signaling semantics for performing\n   operations with group-specific\
    \ scope, this results in a significant\n   amount of signaling traffic on a periodic\
    \ basis between a given\n   mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor.\
    \  This document\n   defines optimizations to the binding update and revocation\
    \ operations\n   in Proxy Mobile IPv6 for performing operations with group-specific\n\
    \   scope with the use of a group identifier.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC5213] requires\
    \ the\n   Mobile Node Identifier option to be present in the mobility signaling\n\
    \   messages, such as in the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding\n  \
    \ Acknowledgement (PBA) messages.  It essentially limits the\n   operational scope\
    \ of the binding update operation to a single\n   mobility session.  These signaling\
    \ messages lack the capability to\n   identify a group of mobility sessions, so\
    \ the operations related to\n   binding update and revocation can be performed\
    \ on all the mobility\n   sessions that are part of that group.\n   There is a\
    \ need to have semantics for associating a group identity to\n   a mobility session,\
    \ so the scope of the operations related to binding\n   update and revocation\
    \ can be extended to all the mobility sessions\n   identified by the group identifier.\
    \  The group identifier therefore\n   provides a considerably improved mechanism\
    \ for protocol operations\n   that would otherwise require multiple atomic transactions\
    \ on a per-\n   mobility-session basis.  Following are some of the use cases where\n\
    \   the group identifier can be used.\n   o  For extending the lifetime of a mobility\
    \ session, the mobile\n      access gateway (MAG) periodically sends a Proxy Binding\
    \ Update\n      message to the local mobility anchor (LMA) on a per-session basis.\n\
    \      This process can be optimized by allowing the mobile access\n      gateway\
    \ to send a single Proxy Binding Update [RFC5213] message\n      for a group of\
    \ mobility sessions identified by a group identifier.\n      Upon accepting the\
    \ request, the local mobility anchor can update\n      the lifetime of all the\
    \ mobility sessions that are part of that\n      group.\n   o  On detecting the\
    \ failure of a specific service card, a local\n      mobility anchor, or a mobile\
    \ access gateway service hosted on\n      blade architecture system, can potentially\
    \ request the peer to\n      revoke all the sessions identified by a common group\
    \ identifier\n      that are hosted on that service card.  Potentially, a single\n\
    \      Binding Revocation Indication [RFC5846] message carrying the group\n  \
    \    identifier can be used to revoke all the sessions hosted on that\n      service\
    \ card, which otherwise needs to be handled on a per-session\n      basis.\n \
    \  This document defines a new mobility option, the Mobile Node Group\n   Identifier\
    \ option, and the extensions to procedures related to\n   binding update and binding\
    \ revocation for performing binding\n   operations with group-specific scope.\n"

    \   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the\n   following\
    \ terms:\n   Bulk Binding Update\n      A binding update operation that has group-specific\
    \ scope.  A\n      binding operation is associated with a specific mobility session.\n\
    \      However, a bulk binding update operation is associated with\n      multiple\
    \ mobility sessions.  This operation is not relevant for\n      new mobility session\
    \ creation.\n   Bulk Binding Update Group\n      A group of mobility sessions\
    \ that are part of the same logical\n      group and therefore share a common\
    \ group identifier.  This group\n      is the bulk binding update group.  This\
    \ bulk binding update group\n      is maintained by both the mobile access gateway\
    \ and the local\n      mobility anchor, and the grouping logic is local to that\
    \ node.  A\n      mobility session can therefore be identified by two bulk binding\n\
    \      update group identifiers, one specific group created by the mobile\n  \
    \    access gateway and the other specific group created by the local\n      mobility\
    \ anchor.  The bulk binding update group identifiers are\n      exchanged as part\
    \ of the initial mobility session creation.  The\n      mobility entities thereafter\
    \ can perform operations related to\n      binding update such as lifetime extension\
    \ and revocation\n      operations on an entire bulk binding update group identified\
    \ by\n      the group identifier.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Motivation\n   In a typical Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, a local mobility\
    \ anchor serves\n   multiple mobile access gateways, and the capacity of that\
    \ node with\n   respect to the number of mobility sessions that it can host is\
    \ quite\n   high, typically in the order of a few millions.  As the number of\n\
    \   mobility sessions hosted by a local mobility anchor goes up, so does\n   the\
    \ amount of signaling traffic related to periodic binding update\n   traffic.\n\
    \   The currently specified approach of the binding update procedure for\n   extending\
    \ the lifetimes of multiple mobility sessions (where the\n   mobile access gateway\
    \ is required to send a unique binding update\n   message for each mobility session\
    \ even when there is no change to the\n   session state) is inefficient or sub-optimal.\
    \  These periodic binding\n   update messages consume a significant amount of\
    \ network resources at\n   both the peers, in terms of processing power and network\
    \ bandwidth.\n   There is an opportunity to optimize the signaling procedures\
    \ by\n   allowing the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to\n\
    \   perform bulk binding update operations.  This document specifies\n   extensions\
    \ to Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling for performing binding\n   update and revocation\
    \ operations on a group of mobility sessions.\n   These extensions do not take\
    \ away the existing functionality of\n   performing binding operations on a single\
    \ mobility session.\n"
- title: 3.2.  General Operation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  General Operation\n   The bulk binding update mechanism specified in this\
    \ document allows\n   the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor\
    \ to perform\n   binding update and revocation operations on a group of mobility\n\
    \   sessions.  As part of the initial signaling during mobility session\n   establishment,\
    \ the local mobility anchor and the mobile access\n   gateway exchange the respective\
    \ bulk binding update group identifiers\n   for that mobility session.  Subsequently,\
    \ both the peers can perform\n   bulk operations on those groups by presenting\
    \ the bulk binding update\n   group identifier in the signaling messages.\n  \
    \ When sending a Proxy Binding Update message after detecting a new\n   mobile\
    \ node on its access link, a mobile access gateway can request\n   the local mobility\
    \ anchor to assign a bulk binding update group\n   identifier for the mobile node's\
    \ mobility session.  This is indicated\n   by setting the (B) flag in the Proxy\
    \ Binding Update to a value of\n   (1).  The mobile access gateway will also assign\
    \ a bulk binding\n   update group identifier (or it may assign a default bulk\
    \ binding\n   update group - ALL-SESSIONS) and include that in the Mobile Node\n\
    \   Group Identifier option.\n   Upon accepting the request, the local mobility\
    \ anchor will group the\n   mobility session to a specific bulk binding update\
    \ group (or it may\n   assign it to the default bulk binding update group - ALL-SESSIONS)\n\
    \   and return this bulk binding update group identifier in a Proxy\n   Binding\
    \ Acknowledgement message.  It will also set the (B) flag in\n   the Proxy Binding\
    \ Acknowledgement message to a value of (1).  The\n   bulk binding update group\
    \ identifier is carried in the Mobile Node\n   Group Identifier option, described\
    \ in Section 4.3.\n   Once the bulk binding update group identifiers are exchanged,\
    \ the\n   local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway can perform\n  \
    \ binding operations on those entire groups, by including the bulk\n   binding\
    \ update group identifier in the signaling messages.  For\n   example, the mobile\
    \ access gateway can extend the lifetime of all the\n   mobility sessions that\
    \ are part of a group by sending a single Proxy\n   Binding Update message with\
    \ that bulk binding update group\n   identifier.  Similarly, the local mobility\
    \ anchor can revoke all the\n   mobility sessions that are part of a group by\
    \ including that group\n   identifier in the Proxy Binding Revocation message.\
    \  When initiating\n   bulk binding update operations on a group of mobility sessions,\
    \ the\n   group identifier that is carried in the Mobile Node Group Identifier\n\
    \   option is always the identifier of the local group, and not the\n   identifier\
    \ of the group on the peer.\n   Figure 1 explains the operational sequence of\
    \ the bulk binding update\n   and revocation operations on a group of mobile nodes\
    \ (MN1, MN2, and\n   MN3).\n              MAG                         LMA\n  \

    \ identifier to a mobility\n      session is outside the scope of this document.\
    \  This group\n      identifier can be unique to the service card on which the\
    \ mobility\n      session is hosted or based on other grouping considerations.\
    \  When\n      no such group assignment is done, the mobile access gateway SHOULD\n\

  - "5.2.3.  Supporting Bulk Binding Updates\n   The following section identifies\
    \ the considerations for a local\n   mobility anchor for performing bulk binding\
    \ update and revocation\n   operations with group-specific scope.\n   o  Any time\
    \ the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update\n      message with\
    \ the (B) flag in the request set to a value of (0) and\n      a Mobile Node Group\
    \ Identifier option present in the request with\n      sub-type value of (1) (Bulk\
    \ Binding Update Group), the local\n      mobility anchor MUST consider the request\
    \ a bulk binding update\n      request, with the request scope including all the\
    \ mobility\n      sessions that are part of that bulk binding update group, specific\n\
    \      to that mobile access gateway, and identified by the group\n      identifier\
    \ in Mobile Node Group Identifier option.  However, if\n      the received request\
    \ also includes any individual session\n      identifiers such as the Mobile Node\
    \ Identifier option [RFC4283],\n      the Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213],\
    \ the IPv4 Home Address\n      Request option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key option\
    \ [RFC5845], the\n      local mobility anchor MUST consider this as an invalid\
    \ message; it\n      MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy\n\
    \      Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to\n      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER\
    \ (Invalid group identifier\n      value in the request).\n   o  The local mobility\
    \ anchor MUST consider the message as a request\n      for extending the lifetime\
    \ of all the mobility sessions that are\n      associated with the group identifier\
    \ in the Mobile Node Group\n      Identifier option.  However, if the Mobile Node\
    \ Group Identifier\n      option with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk Binding\
    \ Update Group)\n      has an unknown group identifier, then the local mobility\
    \ anchor\n      MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message and send a Proxy\n\
    \      Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to\n      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER\
    \ (Invalid group identifier\n      value in the request).\n   o  Upon accepting\
    \ the bulk binding update request, the local mobility\n      anchor SHOULD extend\
    \ the lifetime for all the mobility sessions\n      that are part of the bulk\
    \ binding update group identified by the\n      group identifier in the Mobile\
    \ Node Group Identifier in the\n      message.  Considerations from [RFC5213]\
    \ MUST be applied for\n      extending the lifetime of a mobile node's session.\
    \  It MUST also\n      send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status\
    \ field\n      value set to 0 (Proxy Binding Update accepted).  The lifetime\n\
    \      field in the message MUST be set to the allocated lifetime for all\n  \
    \    the mobility sessions.  The message MUST also include the Mobile\n      Node\
    \ Group Identifier option, with the sub-type value of (1) (Bulk\n      Binding\
    \ Update Group) and with the identifier value copied from\n      the Mobile Node\
    \ Group Identifier option present in the received\n      Proxy Binding Update\
    \ message.\n   o  If the local mobility anchor rejects the bulk binding update\n\
    \      request for any administrative reason, then it MUST NOT update the\n  \
    \    lifetime in the Binding Cache entries of any of the mobile nodes\n      identified\
    \ by the group identifier.  The local mobility anchor\n      SHOULD send a Proxy\
    \ Binding Acknowledgement indicating the reason\n      for the rejection in the\
    \ status code.\n   o  Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation\n\
    \      Indication Message [RFC5846] with a Mobile Node Group Identifier\n    \
    \  option present in the request and with the sub-type value of (1)\n      (Bulk\
    \ Binding Update Group), the local mobility anchor MUST\n      consider the request\
    \ as a bulk revocation request, with the\n      request scope including all the\
    \ mobility sessions that are part of\n      the bulk binding update group specific\
    \ to that mobile access\n      gateway and identified by the group identifier\
    \ in Mobile Node\n      Group Identifier option.  However, if the received request\
    \ also\n      includes the Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC4283], the Home\n\
    \      Network Prefix option [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request\n      option\
    \ [RFC5844], or the GRE Key option [RFC5845], the local\n      mobility anchor\
    \ MUST consider this as an invalid message; it MUST\n      reject the Binding\
    \ Revocation Indication message and send a BRA\n      message with the Status\
    \ field set to a value of 128 (Binding Does\n      NOT Exist).  All the considerations\
    \ from [RFC5846] apply when\n      processing a binding revocation request, except\
    \ making the scope\n      of the operation apply to a set of mobility sessions\
    \ identified by\n      the group identifier present in the request.\n   o  Upon\
    \ accepting the Binding Revocation Indication request and\n      completing the\
    \ operation, the local mobility anchor MUST send a\n      Binding Revocation Acknowledgement\
    \ message with the Status field\n      set to a value of 0 (success).  The message\
    \ MUST include the\n      Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the identifier\
    \ value\n      copied from the Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in\
    \ the\n      received Binding Revocation Indication message.\n"

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   Per this document, IANA has done the following:\n\
    \   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy\n    \
    \  Binding Update message, specified in [RFC5213].  This flag is\n      described\
    \ in Section 4.1.  The value of the flag (B) has been\n      allocated from the\
    \ \"Binding Update Flags\" registry.\n   o  Action-2: This specification defines\
    \ a new flag (B) to the Proxy\n      Binding Acknowledgement message, specified\
    \ in [RFC5213].  This\n      flag is described in Section 4.2.  The value of the\
    \ flag (B) has\n      been allocated from the \"Binding Acknowledgement Flags\"\
    \ registry.\n   o  Action-3: This specification defines a new Mobility Header\
    \ option,\n      the Mobile Node Group Identifier option.  This option is described\n\
    \      in Section 4.3.  The Type value for this option has been assigned\n   \
    \   in the same number space as allocated for the other mobility\n      options\
    \ [RFC6275].\n   o  Action-4: The Sub-type field of the Mobile Node Group Identifier\n\
    \      option introduces a new number space.  This number space is now\n     \
    \ managed by IANA, under the Registry, \"Mobile Node Group Identifier\n      Type\
    \ Registry\".  This specification reserves the sub-type value of\n      (1) (Bulk\
    \ Binding Update Group).  Approval of new sub-type values\n      are to be made\
    \ through IANA Expert Review.  The value range of\n      this field is 0 through\
    \ 255, but the values 0 and 255 are marked\n      as reserved.  The remaining\
    \ values 2-254 are available for\n      allocation.\n   o  Action-5: This document\
    \ also defines a new status value\n      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER\
    \ (Invalid group identifier\n      value in the request: 175) for use in the Proxy\
    \ Binding\n      Acknowledgement message, as described in Section 4.4.  This value\n\
