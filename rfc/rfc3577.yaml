  - "1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of RMON
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of RMON\n   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors\
    \ or probes,\n   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing and/or\n\
    \   monitoring a network.  Often these remote probes are stand-alone\n   devices\
    \ and devote significant internal resources for the sole\n   purpose of managing\
    \ a network.  An organization may employ many of\n   these devices, up to one\
    \ per network segment, to manage its internet.\n   In addition, these devices\
    \ may be used to manage a geographically\n   remote network such as for a network\
    \ management support center of a\n   service provider to manage a client network,\
    \ or for the central\n   support organization of an enterprise to manage a remote\
    \ site.\n   When the work on the RMON documents was started, this device-oriented\n\
    \   definition of RMON was taken quite literally, as RMON devices were\n   purpose-built\
    \ probes and dedicated to implementing the RMON MIB\n   modules.  Soon, cards\
    \ were introduced that added RMON capability into\n   a network hub, switch or\
    \ router.  RMON also began to appear as a\n   software capability that was added\
    \ to the software of certain network\n   equipment, as well as software applications\
    \ that could run on servers\n   or clients.  Despite the variety of these approaches,\
    \ the RMON\n   capability in each serves as a dedicated network management resource\n\
    \   available for activities ranging from long-term data collection and\n   analysis\
    \ or for ad-hoc firefighting.\n   In the beginning, most, but not all, of RMON's\
    \ capabilities were\n   based on the promiscuous capture of packets on a network\
    \ segment or\n   segments.  Over time, that mixture included more and more\n \
    \  capabilities that did not depend on promiscuous packet capture.\n   Today,\
    \ some of the newest documents added to the RMON framework allow\n   multiple\
    \ techniques of data gathering, where promiscuous packet\n   capture is just one\
    \ of several implementation options.\n"
- title: 3.  Goals of RMON
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals of RMON\n      o  Offline Operation\n         There are sometimes conditions\
    \ when a management station will\n         not be in constant contact with its\
    \ remote monitoring devices.\n         This is sometimes by design in an attempt\
    \ to lower\n         communications costs (especially when communicating over\
    \ a WAN\n         or dialup link), or by accident as network failures affect the\n\
    \         communications between the management station and the probe.\n     \
    \    For this reason, RMON allows a probe to be configured to\n         perform\
    \ diagnostics and to collect statistics continuously,\n         even when communication\
    \ with the management station may not be\n         possible or efficient.  The\
    \ probe may then attempt to notify\n         the management station when an exceptional\
    \ condition occurs.\n         Thus, even in circumstances where communication\
    \ between\n         management station and probe is not continuous, fault,\n \
    \        performance, and configuration information may be continuously\n    \
    \     accumulated and communicated to the management station\n         conveniently\
    \ and efficiently.\n      o  Proactive Monitoring\n         Given the resources\
    \ available on the monitor, it is potentially\n         helpful for it to continuously\
    \ run diagnostics and to log\n         network performance.  The monitor is always\
    \ available at the\n         onset of any failure.  It can notify the management\
    \ station of\n         the failure and can store historical statistical information\n\
    \         about the failure.  This historical information can be played\n    \
    \     back by the management station in an attempt to perform further\n      \
    \   diagnosis into the cause of the problem.\n      o  Problem Detection and Reporting\n\
    \         The monitor can be configured to recognize conditions, most\n      \
    \   notably error conditions, and to continuously check for them.\n         When\
    \ one of these conditions occurs, the event may be logged,\n         and management\
    \ stations may be notified in a number of ways.\n      o  Value Added Data\n \
    \        Because a remote monitoring device represents a network\n         resource\
    \ dedicated exclusively to network management functions,\n         and because\
    \ it is located directly on the monitored portion of\n         the network, the\
    \ remote network monitoring device has the\n         opportunity to add significant\
    \ value to the data it collects.\n         For instance, by highlighting those\
    \ hosts on the network that\n         generate the most traffic or errors, the\
    \ probe can give the\n         management station precisely the information it\
    \ needs to solve\n         a class of problems.\n      o  Multiple Managers\n\
    \         An organization may have multiple management stations for\n        \
    \ different units of the organization, for different functions\n         (e.g.,\
    \ engineering and operations), and in an attempt to\n         provide disaster\
    \ recovery.  Because environments with multiple\n         management stations\
    \ are common, the remote network monitoring\n         device has to deal with\
    \ more than one management station,\n         potentially using its resources\
    \ concurrently.\n"
- title: 4.  RMON Documents
  contents:
  - "4.  RMON Documents\n   The RMON Framework includes a number of documents.  Each\
    \ document\n   that makes up the RMON framework defines some new useful behavior\n\
    \   (i.e., an application) and managed objects that configure, control\n   and\
    \ monitor that behavior.  This section lists those documents and\n   describes\
    \ the role of each.\n   One of the key ways to differentiate the various RMON\
    \ MIB modules is\n   by noting at which layer they operate.  Because the RMON\
    \ MIB modules\n   take measurements and present aggregates of those measurements,\
    \ there\n   are 2 criteria to quantify for each MIB:\n      1. At which layers\
    \ does the MIB take measurements?\n         For example, the RMON MIB measures\
    \ data-link layer attributes\n         (e.g., packets, bytes, errors), while the\
    \ APM MIB measures\n         application layer attributes (e.g., response time).\
    \  Supporting\n         measurement at higher layers requires analysis deeper\
    \ into the\n         packet and many application layer measurements require stateful\n\
    \         flow analysis.\n      2. At which layers does the MIB aggregate measurements?\n\
    \         This criteria notes the granularity of aggregation.  For\n         example,\
    \ the RMON MIB aggregates its measurements to the link,\n         hardware address,\
    \ or hardware address pair - all data-link\n         concepts.  In contrast, the\
    \ RMON-2 MIB takes the same data-link\n         metrics (packets, bytes, errors)\
    \ and aggregates them based on\n         network address, transport protocol,\
    \ or application protocol.\n   Note that a MIB may take measurements at one level\
    \ while aggregating\n   at different levels.  Also note that a MIB may function\
    \ at multiple\n   levels.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the measurement layers and\n\

  - "4.1.  RMON-1\n   The RMON-1 standard [RFC2819] is focused at layer 2 and provides\n\
    \   link-layer statistics aggregated in a variety of ways.  In addition,\n   it\
    \ provides the generation of alarms when thresholds are crossed, as\n   well as\
    \ the ability to filter and capture packet contents.  The\n   components of RMON-1\

    \         The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples\n  \
    \       from an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.\n      The\
    \ Alarm Group\n         The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples\
    \ from\n         variables in the probe and compares them to previously\n    \
    \     configured thresholds.  If the monitored variable crosses a\n         threshold,\
    \ an event is generated.  A hysteresis mechanism is\n         implemented to limit\
    \ the generation of alarms.\n      The Host Group\n         The host group contains\
    \ statistics associated with each host\n         discovered on the network.  This\

    \ of switched networks.\n   Switches today differ from standard shared media protocols\
    \ because:\n      1) Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by\
    \ the\n         switch architecture or by the connection-oriented nature of the\n\
    \         data.  This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast\n      \
    \   traffic needs to be considered.\n      2) Monitoring the multiple entry and\
    \ exit points from a Switching\n         device requires a vast amount of resources\
    \ - memory and CPU,\n         and aggregation of the data in logical packets of\
    \ information,\n         determined by the application needs.\n      3) Switching\

    \ only concerned with the monitoring of\n         packets.\n   Differences such\
    \ as these make monitoring difficult.  The SMON MIB\n   provides the following\

    \ Port attributes of each data source.\n      portCopyConfig\n         Many network\
    \ switches provide the capability to make a copy of\n         traffic seen on\
    \ one port and sending it out to another port for\n         management purposes.\
    \  This occurs in addition to any copying\n         performed during the normal\

    \ SNMP over UDP over IP over Ethernet.\n   The set of defined protocol layers\
    \ currently described is found in\n   RFC 2896 [RFC2896].  RFC 2895 [RFC2895]\
    \ defines a process for\n   submitting new protocols to add to the currently defined\
    \ set.\n   Periodic updates to RFC 2896 will be published to incorporate new\n\
    \   protocol definitions that have been submitted.  In fact, RFC 2896 is\n   the\
    \ second version of the defined protocol macros, obsoleting RFC\n   2074 [RFC2074].\
    \  RFC 2895 also defines how to handle protocols that\n   do not map into this\
    \ well-defined tree hierarchy built up from\n   encapsulation protocol identifiers.\
    \  An example of such a protocol\n   encapsulation is RTP, which is mapped to\
    \ specific UDP ports through a\n   separate signaling mechanism.  These are handled\
    \ by the ianaAssigned\n   protocols, as described in RFC 2895.\n   The protocolDirTable\
    \ is defined (and used) in the RMON-2 MIB\n   [RFC2021], and is being used in\
    \ other RMON WG MIBs, as well as other\n   IETF defined MIBs.  Examples include\
    \ the APM MIB [APM], the TPM MIB\n   [TPM] and the SSPM MIB [SSPM].\n   As mentioned\
    \ in previous sections, the protocolDirID is being\n   extended in two ways. \
    \ First, work is underway on a new set of\n   protocol descriptor macros to extend\
    \ the protocol encapsulation model\n   to identify application layer verbs [RFC3395].\
    \  This extension was\n   motivated by the work on the APM MIB and the TPM MIB.\
    \  Second, the\n   APM MIB defines the apmAppDirectoryTable that provides a directory\
    \ of\n   applications that the agent can process.  This is discussed further\n\
    \   in the following section.  Combined, these extensions allow:\n      +  The\
    \ APM MIB to define and monitor the end-user's view of\n         application performance.\n\
    \      +  The TPM MIB to clearly specify the sub-transactions that\n         comprise\
    \ the application it monitors through the\n         tpmTransMetricDirTable.\n\
    \      +  The SSPM MIB to generate synthetic application transactions by\n   \
    \      importing the appLocalIndex from the APM MIB.\n"

    \ collect certain types of statistics\n   for each application or application\

    \ in the protocol\n   directory and thus get their own protocolID and a corresponding\n\
    \   protocolDirLocalIndex.  Other application verbs are defined more\n   dynamically\
    \ by entries in the apmHttpFilterTable or\n   apmUserDefinedAppTable.  These dynamically\
    \ defined applications do\n   not have protocolDirID's assigned to them.\n   The\
    \ APM MIB [APM] defines an important index called the\n   appLocalIndex.  For\

    \ by integer values of the\n   appLocalIndex.  However, there is no single registry\
    \ of applications\n   (as there is for protocols) because there are a few different\n\

    \ number space is the union of\n   these number spaces, where these tables must\
    \ work together to avoid\n   assigning overlapping (duplicate) appLocalIndexes.\n\

- title: 5.6.  Control Tables
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Control Tables\n   Due to the complex nature of the available functions\
    \ in the RMON MIB\n   modules, these functions often need user configuration.\
    \  In many\n   cases, the function requires parameters to be set up for a data\n\
    \   collection operation.  The operation can proceed only after these\n   parameters\
    \ are fully set up.\n   Many functional groups in the RMON MIBs have one or more\
    \ tables in\n   which to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables\
    \ in\n   which to place the results of the operation.  The control tables are\n\
    \   typically read-write in nature, while the data tables are typically\n   read-only.\
    \  Because the parameters in the control table often\n   describe resulting data\
    \ in the data table, many of the parameters can\n   be modified only when the\
    \ control entry is invalid.  Thus, the method\n   for modifying these parameters\
    \ is to invalidate the control entry,\n   causing its deletion and the deletion\
    \ of any associated data entries,\n   and then create a new control entry with\
    \ the proper parameters.\n   Deleting the control entry also gives a convenient\
    \ method for\n   reclaiming the resources used by the associated data.\n   To\
    \ facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be\n   shared among\
    \ the managers.  These resources are typically the memory\n   and computation\
    \ resources that a function requires.\n   Two facilities are used to ease cooperation\
    \ between multiple managers\n   as they create and use control tables.  The first\
    \ is the use of\n   EntryStatus or RowStatus objects that guarantee that two managers\
    \ can\n   avoid creating the same control entry.  The second is the use of\n \
    \  OwnerString objects in control tables that provides the following\n   benefits:\n\
    \      1. Provides information to facilitate sharing of already existing\n   \
    \      control entries instead of creating a new but identical entry.\n      2.\
    \ Provides information to allow the ultimate human owners of\n         control\
    \ entries to identify each other so they can cooperate in\n         cases of conflict\
    \ over resources.\n      3. Provides information to allow software to identify\
    \ control\n         entries that it owns but has forgotten about (e.g., due to\
    \ a\n         crash or other error) so that it can re-use or free them.\n    \
    \  4. Provides information to allow an administrator to make an\n         informed\
    \ decision to override someone else's control entry when\n         circumstances\
    \ make it necessary.\n      5. Provides information to identify control entries\
    \ that are set\n         up automatically when the device starts up.\n   See the\
    \ RMON MIB [RFC2819] for further information on the use of\n   control tables,\
    \ EntryStatus/RowStatus, and OwnerStrings.\n"

    \ Control\" is essentially hard-coded in the APM\n   MIB.  Within the TPM MIB,\
    \ a metrics table is used to identify the\n   metrics monitored within a specific\
    \ implementation of the TPM MIB.\n   The \"Data Reduction Control\" is essentially\
    \ hard-coded within the MIB\n   structure of the APM MIB and the TPM MIB.  These\
    \ MIBs strictly\n   specify the statistics to be reported within a set of report\
    \ tables.\n   Both the TPM MIB and the SSPM MIB rely upon the APM MIB's\n   appLocalIndex\
    \ to specify the application being monitored or\n   generated.  The APM MIB provides\
    \ the end-user view of the application\n   performance, e.g., the Whois transaction\
    \ time.  The TPM MIB, through\n   its tpmTransMetricDirTable, identifies a set\
    \ of sub-application level\n   transactions and their metrics, which are associated\
    \ with the\n   application.  E.g., an implementation of the TPM MIB could report\
    \ the\n   DNS lookup time, the TCP connect time (to the Whois Server), the\n \
    \  Whois Req/Resp download time.  The SSPM MIB could be configured to\n   generate\
    \ synthetically, these Whois transactions.\n   The testing model then is to first\
    \ configure the traffic generation\n   instrumentation through the SSPM MIB control\
    \ function.  This defines\n   aspects of the synthetic traffic such as application\
    \ type, targets,\n   etc.  Once the traffic generation is configured, the network\n\
    \   management application can setup the monitoring instrumentation\n   through\
    \ the APM MIB and TPM MIB.  These control the reporting\n   periods, the type\
    \ of data aggregation, etc.  Once the tests are\n   complete, the network management\
    \ application retrieves the reports\n   from the monitoring metrics control MIBs,\
    \ e.g., APM MIB and TPM MIB.\n"
