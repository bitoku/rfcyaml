  - "1.  Introduction\n   When operators make the access network transition to an\
    \ IPv6-only\n   access network, they must continue to provide IPv4 services to\
    \ their\n   users to access IPv4 contents.  IPv4 connectivity is required when\n\
    \   communicating with the IPv4-only Internet.  This document describes a\n  \
    \ mechanism called Public 4over6 for providing IPv4 connectivity over a\n   native\
    \ IPv6-only access network.  This memo focuses on interactions\n   between Public\
    \ 4over6 elements as well as the deployment\n   architecture.\n   Public 4over6\
    \ is in active deployment in some environments,\n   particularly in China Next\
    \ Generation Internet (CNGI) and China\n   Education and Research Network 2 (CERNET2),\
    \ but it is not recommended\n   for new deployments.  Documenting this approach\
    \ is intended to\n   benefit users and operators of existing deployments as well\
    \ as\n   readers of other IPv4-over-IPv6 documents.\n   In addition to Public\
    \ 4over6 and its deployment architecture as\n   described in this memo, the IETF\
    \ is currently working on a more\n   generic solution called Lightweight 4over6\
    \ [SOFTWIRE-LW46], which is\n   classified as a binding approach in the Unified\
    \ IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire\n   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) [SOFTWIRE-CPE].\
    \  Lightweight 4over6\n   covers both sharing and non-sharing global IPv4 addresses\
    \ in the Hub\n   and Spoke model.  Future deployments should use [SOFTWIRE-LW46].\n\
    \   Public 4over6 utilizes the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel technique defined in\n   [RFC2473],\
    \ which enables IPv4 datagrams to traverse through native\n   IPv6 networks. \
    \ IPv4 nodes connect to the Tunnel Entry-Point Node and\n   Tunnel Exit-Point\
    \ Node to communicate over the IPv6-only network.\n   Therefore, the Internet\
    \ Service Providers (ISPs) can run an IPv6-only\n   infrastructure instead of\
    \ a fully dual-stack network as well as avoid\n   the need to deploy scarce IPv4\
    \ address resources throughout the\n   network.\n   This mechanism focuses on\
    \ providing full end-to-end transparency to\n   the user side.  Therefore, global\
    \ IPv4 addresses are expected to be\n   provisioned to end users, and carrier-side\
    \ address translation can be\n   avoided.  Furthermore, global non-shared IPv4\
    \ addresses are\n   preferable to shared IPv4 addresses, so that user-side address\n\
    \   translation is not necessary either.  It is important, in particular,\n  \
    \ to users that are required to run their applications on an IP\n   protocol different\
    \ from TCP and UDP (e.g., IPsec, L2TP) or on certain\n   well-known TCP/UDP ports\
    \ (e.g., HTTP, SMTP).  For many ISPs that are\n   actually capable of provisioning\
    \ non-shared unique IPv4 addresses,\n   the mechanism provides a pure, suitable\
    \ solution.\n   Another focus of this mechanism is deployment and operational\n\
    \   flexibility.  Public 4over6 allows IPv4 and IPv6 address\n   architectures\
    \ to be totally independent of each other; the end user's\n   IPv4 address is\
    \ not embedded in its IPv6 address.  Therefore, IPv4\n   address planning has\
    \ no implication for IPv6 address planning.\n   Operators can manage the IPv4\
    \ address resources in a flat,\n   centralized manner.  This requires that the\
    \ tunnel concentrator\n   [RFC4925] maintain the binding between an IPv4 address\
    \ and an IPv6\n   address, i.e., maintaining per-subscriber binding state.\n \
    \  The mechanism follows the Hub and Spoke softwire model [RFC4925] and\n   uses\
    \ IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling as the basic data-plane method.  Global\n   non-shared\
    \ IPv4 addresses are allocated from the ISP to end hosts or\n   CPEs over an IPv6\
    \ network.  Simultaneously, the binding between the\n   allocated IPv4 address\
    \ and the end user's IPv6 address is maintained\n   on the tunnel concentrator\
    \ for encapsulation usage.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Public 4over6:  A per-subscriber, stateful IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel\n\
    \      mechanism.  Public 4over6 supports bidirectional communication\n      between\
    \ the global IPv4 Internet and IPv4 hosts or customer\n      networks via an IPv6\
    \ access network by leveraging IPv4-in-IPv6\n      tunneling [RFC2473] and global\
    \ IPv4 address allocation over IPv6.\n      The term 'Public' means the allocated\
    \ IPv4 address is globally\n      routable.\n   Full IPv4 address:  An IPv4 address\
    \ that is not shared by multiple\n      users.  The user with this IPv4 address\
    \ has full access to all the\n      available TCP/UDP ports, including the well-known\
    \ TCP/UDP ports.\n   4over6 Customer Edge (CE):  A device functioning as the Customer\
    \ Edge\n      equipment in a Public 4over6 environment.  A 4over6 CE can be\n\
    \      either a dual-stack capable host or a dual-stack CPE device, both\n   \
    \   of which have a tunnel interface to support IPv4-in-IPv6\n      encapsulation.\
    \  In the former case, the host supports both IPv4\n      and IPv6 stacks but\
    \ its uplink is IPv6 only.  In the latter case,\n      the CPE has an IPv6 interface\
    \ connecting to the ISP network and an\n      IPv4 or dual-stack interface connecting\
    \ to the customer network;\n      hosts in the customer network can be IPv4 only\
    \ or dual stack.\n   4over6 Border Relay (BR):  A router deployed in the edge\
    \ of the\n      operator's IPv6 access network that supports IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel\n\
    \      termination.  A 4over6 BR is a dual-stack router that connects to\n   \
    \   both the IPv6 access network and the IPv4 Internet.  The 4over6 BR\n     \
    \ can also work as a DHCPv4-over-IPv6 [DHCPv4-IPv6] server/relay for\n      assigning\
    \ and distributing global IPv4 addresses to 4over6 CEs.\n"
- title: 3.  Scenario and Use Cases
  contents:
  - "3.  Scenario and Use Cases\n   The general Public 4over6 scenario is shown in\
    \ Figure 1.  Users in an\n   IPv6 network take IPv6 as their native service. \
    \ Some users are end\n   hosts that face the ISP network directly, while others\
    \ are in private\n   networks behind CPEs, such as a home Local Area Network (LAN),\
    \ an\n   enterprise network, etc.  The ISP network is IPv6 only rather than\n\
    \   dual stack, which means the ISP cannot provide native IPv4 service to\n  \
    \ users.  In order to support legacy IPv4 transport, some routers on\n   the carrier\
    \ side are dual stack and are connected to the IPv4\n   Internet.  These routers\
    \ act as 4over6 BRs.  Network users that\n   require IPv4 connectivity obtain\
    \ it through these routers.\n                        +-------------------------+\n\

    \                     Figure 1: Public 4over6 Scenario\n   Public 4over6 can be\
    \ applicable in several use cases.  If an ISP that\n   switches to IPv6 still\
    \ has plenty of global IPv4 address resources,\n   it can deploy Public 4over6\
    \ to provide transparent IPv4 service for\n   all its customers.  If the ISP does\
    \ not have enough IPv4 addresses,\n   it can deploy Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333]\
    \ as the basic IPv4-over-IPv6\n   service.  Along with Dual-Stack Lite, Public\
    \ 4over6 can be deployed\n   as a value-added service, overcoming the service\
    \ degradation caused\n   by the Carrier Grade NAT (CGN).  An IPv4 application\
    \ server is a\n   typical high-end user of Public 4over6.  Using a full, global\
    \ IPv4\n   address brings significant advantages in this case and is important\n\
    \   for Internet Content Providers (ICPs) making the transition to IPv6:\n   o\
    \  The DNS registration can be direct, using a dedicated address;\n   o  Accessing\
    \ the application service can be straightforward, with no\n      translation involved;\n\
    \   o  There will be no need to provide NAT traversal mechanisms for\n      incoming\
    \ traffic, and no special handling is required for the\n      well-known TCP/UDP\
    \ ports.\n"

- title: 4.2.  Public IPv4 Address Allocation
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Public IPv4 Address Allocation\n   Usually, each CE is provisioned with\
    \ one global IPv4 address.\n   However, it is possible that a CE would require\
    \ an IPv4 prefix.  The\n   key problem here is the mechanism for IPv4 address\
    \ provisioning over\n   IPv6 networks.\n   There are two possibilities: DHCPv4\
    \ over IPv6, and static\n   configuration.  Public 4over6 supports both these\
    \ methods.  DHCPv4\n   over IPv6 allows DHCPv4 messages to be transported in IPv6\
    \ rather\n   than IPv4; therefore, the DHCPv4 process can be performed over an\n\
    \   IPv6 network between the BR and the relevant CE. [DHCPv4-IPv6]\n   describes\
    \ the DHCP protocol extensions needed to support this\n   operation.  For static\
    \ configuration, Public 4over6 users and ISP\n   operators negotiate beforehand\
    \ to authorize the IPv4 address(es).\n   Then the tunnel interface and the address\
    \ binding are configured by\n   the user and the ISP, respectively.\n   While\
    \ regular users would probably opt for DHCPv4 over IPv6, the\n   static configuration\
    \ is particularly applicable in two cases: for\n   application servers, which\
    \ require a stable IPv4 address; and for\n   enterprise networks, which usually\
    \ require an IPv4 prefix rather than\n   one single address.  (Note that DHCPv4\
    \ does not support prefix\n   allocation.)\n"
- title: 5.  4over6 CE Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  4over6 CE Behavior\n   A CE is provisioned with IPv6 before the Public 4over6\
    \ process.  It\n   also learns the BR's IPv6 address beforehand.  This IPv6 address\
    \ can\n   be configured using a variety of methods, ranging from an out-of-band\n\
    \   mechanism, manual configuration, or via a DHCPv6 option.  In order to\n  \
    \ guarantee interoperability, the CE element implements the AFTR-Name\n   DHCPv6\
    \ option defined in [RFC6334].\n   A CE supports DHCPv4 over IPv6 [DHCPv4-IPv6]\
    \ to dynamically acquire\n   an IPv4 address over IPv6 and assign it to the IPv4-in-IPv6\
    \ tunnel\n   interface.  The CE regards the BR as its DHCPv4-over-IPv6\n   server/relay,\
    \ which is used to obtain its global IPv4 address\n   allocation; its IPv6 address\
    \ is learned by the CE as described above.\n   A CE also supports static configuration\
    \ of the tunnel interface.  In\n   the case of prefix provisioning, the tunnel\
    \ interface is assigned\n   with the well-known IPv4 address defined in Section\
    \ 5.7 of [RFC6333],\n   rather than using an address from the prefix.  If the\
    \ CE has multiple\n   IPv6 addresses on its WAN interface, it uses one of the\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses for DHCPv4 over IPv6 or negotiation of static\n   configuration.\
    \  The CE then uses the same IPv6 address for data-plane\n   encapsulation.\n\
    \   A CE performs IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation and decapsulation on the\n   tunnel\
    \ interface.  When sending out an IPv4 packet, it performs the\n   encapsulation\
    \ using the IPv6 address of the 4over6 BR as the IPv6\n   destination address\
    \ and its own IPv6 address as the IPv6 source\n   address.  The decapsulation\
    \ on the 4over6 CE is simple.  When\n   receiving an IPv4-in-IPv6 packet, the\
    \ CE just removes the IPv6 header\n   and either hands it to a local upper layer\
    \ or forwards it to the\n   customer network according to the IPv4 destination\
    \ address.\n   A CE runs a regular IPv4 Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT)\n\
    \   for its customer network when it is provisioned with one single IPv4\n   address.\
    \  In that case, the assigned IPv4 address of the tunnel\n   interface would be\
    \ the external IPv4 address of the NAPT.  Then the\n   CE performs IPv4 private-to-public\
    \ translation before encapsulation\n   of IPv4 packets from the customer network\
    \ and IPv4 public-to-private\n   translation after decapsulation of IPv4-in-IPv6\
    \ packets.\n   IPv4 NAPT is not necessary when the CE is provisioned with an IPv4\n\
    \   prefix.  In this case, detailed customer network planning is out of\n   scope\
    \ for this document.\n   The 4over6 CE supports backward compatibility with DS-Lite.\
    \  A CE can\n   employ the well-known IPv4 address for the Basic Bridging BroadBand\n\
    \   (B4) element [RFC6333] and switch to Dual-Stack Lite for IPv4\n   communications\
    \ if it can't get a global IPv4 address from the DHCPv4\n   server (for instance,\
    \ if the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 process fails or the\n   DHCPv4 server refuses to allocate\
    \ a global IPv4 address to it, etc.).\n"
- title: 6.  4over6 BR Behavior
  contents:
  - "6.  4over6 BR Behavior\n   The 4over6 BR maintains the bindings between the CE\
    \ IPv6 address and\n   CE IPv4 address (prefixes).  The bindings are used to provide\
    \ the\n   correct encapsulation destination address for inbound IPv4 packets\n\
    \   and also to validate the IPv6-IPv4 source of the outbound IPv4-in-\n   IPv6\
    \ packets.\n   The BR acquires the binding information through the IPv4 address\n\

    \ which are deployment-specific:\n   o  The BR can be co-located with the DHCPv4-over-IPv6\
    \ server.  Then\n      the synchronization happens within the BR.  It installs\
    \ a binding\n      when sending out an ACK for a DHCP lease and deletes it when\
    \ the\n      lease expires or a DHCP RELEASE message is received.\n   o  The BR\
    \ can play the role of IPv6-Transport Relay Agent (TRA) as\n      described in\
    \ [DHCPv4-IPv6] and snoop for the DHCPv4 ACK and\n      RELEASE messages as well\
    \ as keep a timer for each binding\n      according to the DHCP lease time.\n\
    \   On the IPv6 side, the BR decapsulates IPv4-in-IPv6 packets coming\n   from\
    \ 4over6 CEs.  It removes the IPv6 header of every IPv4-in-IPv6\n   packet and\
    \ forwards it to the IPv4 Internet.  Before the\n   decapsulation, the BR checks\
    \ the inner IPv4 source address against\n   the outer IPv6 source address by matching\
    \ such a binding entry in the\n   binding table.  If no binding is found, the\
    \ BR silently drops the\n   packet.  On the IPv4 side, the BR encapsulates the\
    \ IPv4 packets\n   destined to 4over6 CEs.  When performing the IPv4-in-IPv6\n\
    \   encapsulation, the BR uses its own IPv6 address as the IPv6 source\n   address\
    \ and uses the IPv4 destination address in the packet to look\n   up the IPv6\
    \ destination address in the address-binding table.  After\n   the encapsulation,\
    \ the BR sends the IPv6 packet on its IPv6 interface\n   to reach a CE.\n   The\
    \ BR supports the hairpinning of traffic between two CEs by\n   performing decapsulation\
    \ and re-encapsulation of packets.\n   In cases where the BR manages the global\
    \ IPv4 address pool, the BR\n   advertises the routing information of IPv4 addresses\
    \ to the IPv4\n   Internet.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The 4over6 BR implements methods to limit service\
    \ only to registered\n   customers.  On the control plane, the BR allocates IPv4\
    \ addresses\n   only to registered customers.  The BR can filter on the IPv6 source\n\
    \   addresses of incoming DHCP requests and only respond to the ones that\n  \
    \ are conveyed by registered IPv6 source addresses.  But this doesn't\n   work\
    \ in situations where multi-homing is present.  In the networks\n   where Public\
    \ 4over6 is deployed, multi-homing is disallowed to avoid\n   this issue.\n  \
    \ Alternatively, the BR can filter out the unregistered CE's requests\n   during\
    \ the DHCP process.  For data packets, the BR does ingress\n   filtering by looking\
    \ up addresses in the IPv4-IPv6 address-binding\n   table for the related matches\
    \ as described in Section 6.\n   In the case of fallback to DS-Lite, security\
    \ considerations in\n   Section 11 of [RFC6333] are followed.\n"
