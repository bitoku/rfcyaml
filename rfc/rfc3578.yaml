  - "1.  Introduction\n   A mapping between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ [1] and the\n   ISDN User Part (ISUP) [2] of SS7 is described in RFC 3398 [3].\n\
    \   However, RFC 3398 only takes into consideration ISUP en-bloc\n   signalling.\
    \  En-bloc signalling consists of sending the complete\n   telephone number of\
    \ the callee in the first signalling message.\n   Although modern switches always\
    \ use en-bloc signalling, some parts of\n   the PSTN still use overlap signalling.\n\
    \   Overlap signalling consists of sending only some digits of the\n   callee's\
    \ number in the first signalling message.  Further digits are\n   sent in subsequent\
    \ signalling messages.  Although overlap signalling\n   in the PSTN is the source\
    \ of much additional complexity, it is still\n   in use in some countries.\n \
    \  Like modern switches, SIP uses en-bloc signalling.  The Request-URI\n   of\
    \ an INVITE request always contains the whole address of the callee.\n   Native\
    \ SIP end-points never generate overlap signalling.\n   Therefore, the preferred\
    \ solution for a gateway handling PSTN overlap\n   signalling and SIP is to convert\
    \ the PSTN overlap signalling into SIP\n   en-bloc signalling using number analysis\
    \ and timers.  The gateway\n   waits until all the signalling messages carrying\
    \ parts of the\n   callee's number arrive, and only then, it generates a SIP INVITE\n\
    \   request.  Section 2 describes how to convert ISUP overlap signalling\n   into\
    \ en-bloc SIP this way.\n   However, although it is the preferred solution, conversion\
    \ of overlap\n   to en-bloc signalling sometimes results in unacceptable (multiple\n\
    \   second) call setup delays to human users.  In these situations, some\n   form\
    \ of overlap signalling has to be used in the SIP network to\n   minimize the\
    \ call setup delay.  However, introducing overlap\n   signalling in SIP introduces\
    \ complexity and brings some issues.\n   Section 3 analyzes the issues related\
    \ to the use of overlap\n   signalling in a SIP network and describe ways to deal\
    \ with them in\n   some particular network scenarios.  Section 3 also describes\
    \ in which\n   particular network scenarios those issues make the use of overlap\n\
    \   signalling in the SIP network unacceptable.\n"

  - "2.  Conversion of ISUP Overlap Signalling into SIP en-bloc Signalling\n   In\
    \ this scenario, the gateway receives an IAM (Initial Address\n   Message) that\
    \ contains only a portion of the called number.  The rest\n   of the digits dialed\
    \ arrive later in one or more SAMs (Subsequent\n   Address Message).\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Waiting for the Minimum Amount of Digits\n   If the IAM contains less than\
    \ the minimum amount of digits to route a\n   call, the gateway starts T35 and\
    \ waits until the minimum amount of\n   digits that can represent a telephone\
    \ number is received (or a stop\n   digit is received).  If T35 expires before\
    \ the minimum amount of\n   digits (or a stop digit) has been received, a REL\
    \ with cause value 28\n   is sent to the ISUP side.  T35 is defined in Q.764 [4]\
    \ as 15-20\n   seconds.\n   If a stop digit is received, the gateway can already\
    \ generate an\n   INVITE request with the complete called number.  Therefore,\
    \ the call\n   proceeds as usual.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  The Minimum Amount of Digits has been Received\n   Once the minimum amount\
    \ of digits that can represent a telephone\n   number has been received, the gateway\
    \ should use number analysis to\n   decide if the number that has been received\
    \ so far is a complete\n   number.  If it is, the gateway can generate an INVITE\
    \ request with\n   the complete called number.  Therefore, the call proceeds as\
    \ usual.\n   However, there are cases when the gateway cannot know whether the\n\
    \   number received is a complete number or not.  In this case, the\n   gateway\
    \ should collect digits until a timer (T10) expires or a stop\n   digit (such\
    \ as, #) is entered by the user (note that T10 is refreshed\n   every time a new\
    \ digit is received).\n   When T10 expires, an INVITE with the digits collected\
    \ so far is sent\n   to the SIP side.  After this, any SAM received is ignored.\n\

- title: 3.1.  One vs. Several Transactions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  One vs. Several Transactions\n   An ingress gateway receiving ISUP overlap\
    \ signalling (i.e., one IAM\n   and one or more SAMs) needs to map it into SIP\
    \ signalling.  One\n   possible approach would consists of sending an INVITE with\
    \ the digits\n   received in the IAM, and once an early dialog is established,\
    \ sending\n   the digits received in SAMs in a SIP request (e.g., INFO) within\
    \ that\n   early dialog.\n   This approach has several problems.  It requires\
    \ that the remote SIP\n   user agent (which might be a gateway) sends a non-100\
    \ provisional\n   response as soon as it receives the initial INVITE to establish\
    \ the\n   early dialog.  Current gateways, following the procedures in RFC 3398\n\
    \   [3], do not generate such a provisional response.  Having gateways\n   generate\
    \ such a response (e.g., 183 Session Progress) would cause\n   ingress gateways\
    \ to generate early ACMs, confusing the PSTN state\n   machine even in calls that\
    \ do not use overlap signalling.\n   In this approach, once the initial INVITE\
    \ request is routed, all the\n   subsequent requests sent within the early dialog\
    \ follow the same\n   path.  That is, they cannot be re-routed to take advantage\
    \ of SIP-\n   based services.  Therefore, we do not recommend using this approach.\n\
    \   An alternative approach consists of sending a new INVITE that\n   contains\
    \ all the digits received so far every time a new SAM is\n   received.  Since\
    \ every new INVITE sent represents a new transaction,\n   they can be routed in\
    \ different ways.  This way, every new INVITE can\n   take advantage of any SIP\
    \ service that the network may provide.\n   However, having subsequent INVITEs\
    \ routed in different ways brings\n   some problems as well.  The first INVITE,\
    \ for instance, might be\n   routed to a particular gateway, and a subsequent\
    \ INVITE, to another.\n   The result is that both gateways generate an IAM.  Since\
    \ one of the\n   IAMs (or both) has an incomplete number, it would fail, having\n\
    \   already consumed PSTN resources.  It could even happen that both IAMs\n  \
    \ contained complete, but different numbers (i.e., one number is the\n   prefix\
    \ of the other one).\n   Routing in SIP can be controlled by the administrator\
    \ of the network.\n   Therefore, a gateway can be configured to generate SIP overlap\n\
    \   signalling in the way described below only if the SIP routing\n   infrastructure\
    \ ensures that INVITEs will only reach one gateway.\n   When the routing infrastructure\
    \ is not under the control of the\n   administrator of the gateway, the procedures\
    \ of Section 2 have to be\n   used instead.\n   Within some dialing plans in the\
    \ PSTN, a phone number might be a\n   prefix of another one.  This situation is\
    \ not common, but it can\n   occur.  Where en-bloc signalling is used, this ambiguity\
    \ is resolved\n   before the digits are placed in the en-bloc signalling.  If\
    \ overlap\n   signaling was used in this situation, a different user than the\
    \ one\n   the caller intended to call might be contacted.  That is why in the\n\
    \   parts of the PSTN where overlap is used, a prefix of a telephone\n   number\
    \ never identifies another valid number.  Therefore, SIP overlap\n   signalling\
    \ should not be used when attempting to reach parts of the\n   PSTN where it is\
    \ possible for a number and some shorter prefix of the\n   same number to both\
    \ be valid addresses of different terminals.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Generating Multiple INVITEs
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Generating Multiple INVITEs\n   In this scenario, the gateway receives\
    \ an IAM (Initial Address\n   Message) and possibly one or more SAMs (Subsequent\
    \ Address Message)\n   that provide more than the minimum amount of digits that\
    \ can\n   represent a phone number.\n   As soon as the minimum amount of digits\
    \ is received, the gateway\n   sends an INVITE and starts T10.  This INVITE is\
    \ built following the\n   procedures described in RFC 3398 [3].\n   If a SAM arrives\
    \ to the gateway, T10 is refreshed and a new INVITE\n   with the new digits received\
    \ is sent.  The new INVITE has the same\n   Call-ID and the same From header field\
    \ including the tag as the first\n   INVITE sent, but has an updated Request-URI.\
    \  The new Request-URI\n   contains all the digits received so far.  The To header\
    \ field of the\n   new INVITE contains all the digits as well, but has no tag.\n\
    \      Note that it is possible to receive a response to the first INVITE\n  \
    \    before having sent the second INVITE.  In this case, the response\n     \
    \ received would contain a To tag and information (Record-Route and\n      Contact)\
    \ to build a Route header field.  The new INVITE to be sent\n      (containing\
    \ new digits) should not use any of these headers.  That\n      is, the new INVITE\
    \ does not contain neither To tag nor Route\n      header field.  This way, this\
    \ new INVITE can be routed dynamically\n      by the network providing services.\n\
    \   The new INVITE should, of course, contain a Cseq field.  It is\n   recommended\
    \ that the Cseq of the new INVITE is higher than any of the\n   previous Cseq\
    \ that the gateway has generated for this Call-ID (no\n   matter for which dialog\
    \ the Cseq was generated).\n      When an INVITE forks, responses from different\
    \ locations might\n      arrive establishing one or more early dialogs.  New requests\
    \ such\n      as, PRACK or UPDATE can be sent within every particular early\n\
    \      dialog.  This implies that the Cseq number spaces of different\n      early\
    \ dialogs are different.  Sending a new INVITE with a Cseq\n      that is still\
    \ unused by any of the remote destinations avoids\n      confusion at the destination.\n\
    \   If the gateway is encapsulating ISUP messages as SIP bodies, it\n   should\
    \ place the IAM and all the SAMs received so far in this INVITE.\n      PSTN \

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Receiving Multiple Responses\n   When overlap signalling in SIP is used,\

    \ multiple responses.\n   The responses to all the INVITEs sent, except for one\
    \ (normally, but\n   not necessarily the last one), are typically 400 class responses\n\
    \   (e.g., 484 Address Incomplete) that terminate the INVITE transaction.\n  \
    \ However, a 183 Session Progress response with a media description can\n   also\
    \ be received.  The media stream will typically contain a message\n   such as,\
    \ \"The number you have just dialed does not exist\".\n   The issue of receiving\
    \ different 183 Session Progress responses with\n   media descriptions does not\
    \ only apply to overlap signalling.  When\n   vanilla SIP is used, several responses\

    \ gateway to decide which\n   media stream should be played to the user.\n   However,\
    \ overlap signalling adds a requirement to this process.  As a\n   general rule,\
    \ a media stream corresponding to the response to an\n   INVITE with a greater\

    \ received previously is answered with\n   484 Address Incomplete.\n   If the\

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   When overlap signaling is employed, it is possible\
    \ that an attacker\n   could send multiple INVITEs containing an incomplete address\
    \ to the\n   same gateway in an attempt to occupy all available ports and thereby\n\
    \   deny service to legitimate callers.  Since none of these partially\n   addressed\
    \ calls would ever complete, in a traditional billing scheme,\n   the sender of\
    \ the INVITEs might never be charged.  To address this\n   threat, the authors\
    \ recommend that gateway operators authenticate the\n   senders of INVITE requests,\
    \ first, in order to have some\n   accountability for the source of calls (it\
    \ is very imprudent to give\n   gateway access to unknown users on the Internet),\
    \ but second, so that\n   the gateway can determine when multiple calls are originating\
    \ from\n   the same source in a short period of time.  Some sort of threshold\
    \ of\n   hanging overlap calls should be tracked by the gateway, and after the\n\
    \   limit is exceeded, the further similar calls should be rejected to\n   prevent\
    \ the saturation of gateway trunking resources.\n"
