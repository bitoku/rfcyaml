    \ services of authentication and,\n   optionally, impersonation (the IIS server\
    \ assumes the windows\n   identity of the principal that has been authenticated)\
    \ are performed.\n   This document explains how HTTP authentication utilizes the\
    \ Simple\n   and Protected GSS-API Negotiation mechanism.  Details of Simple And\n\
    \   Protected Negotiate (SPNEGO) implementation are not provided in this\n   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Reliance on the HTTP/1.1 Specification\n   This specification is a companion\
    \ to the HTTP/1.1 specification\n   [RFC2616], and it builds on the authentication\
    \ mechanisms defined in\n   [RFC2617].  It uses the augmented BNF section of that\
    \ document (2.1),\n   and it relies on both the non-terminals defined in that\
    \ document and\n   other aspects of the HTTP/1.1 specification.\n"
- title: 4.  HTTP Negotiate Authentication Scheme
  contents:
  - "4.  HTTP Negotiate Authentication Scheme\n   Use of Kerberos is wrapped in an\
    \ HTTP auth-scheme of \"Negotiate\".\n   The auth-params exchanged use data formats\
    \ defined for use with the\n   GSS-API [RFC2743].  In particular, they follow\
    \ the formats set for\n   the SPNEGO [RFC4178] and Kerberos [RFC4121] mechanisms\
    \ for GSSAPI.\n   The \"Negotiate\" auth-scheme calls for the use of SPNEGO GSSAPI\
    \ tokens\n   that the specific mechanism type specifies.\n   The current implementation\
    \ of this protocol is limited to the use of\n   SPNEGO with the Kerberos and Microsoft(NT\
    \ Lan Manager) NTLM\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The WWW-Authenticate Response Header
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The WWW-Authenticate Response Header\n   If the server receives a request\
    \ for an access-protected object, and\n   if an acceptable Authorization header\
    \ has not been sent, the server\n   responds with a \"401 Unauthorized\" status\
    \ code, and a \"WWW-\n   Authenticate:\" header as per the framework described\
    \ in [RFC2616].\n   The initial WWW-Authenticate header will not carry any gssapi-data.\n\
    \   The negotiate scheme will operate as follows:\n           challenge      \
    \ = \"Negotiate\" auth-data\n           auth-data       = 1#( [gssapi-data] )\n\
    \   The meanings of the values of the directives used above are as\n   follows:\n\
    \   gssapi-data\n   If the gss_accept_security_context returns a token for the\
    \ client,\n   this directive contains the base64 encoding of an\n   initialContextToken,\
    \ as defined in [RFC2743].  This is not present in\n   the initial response from\
    \ the server.\n   A status code 200 status response can also carry a \"WWW-Authenticate\"\
    \n   response header containing the final leg of an authentication.  In\n   this\
    \ case, the gssapi-data will be present.  Before using the\n   contents of the\
    \ response, the gssapi-data should be processed by\n   gss_init_security_context\
    \ to determine the state of the security\n   context.  If this function indicates\
    \ success, the response can be\n   used by the application.  Otherwise, an appropriate\
    \ action, based on\n   the authentication status, should be taken.\n   For example,\
    \ the authentication could have failed on the final leg if\n   mutual authentication\
    \ was requested and the server was not able to\n   prove its identity.  In this\
    \ case, the returned results are suspect.\n   It is not always possible to mutually\
    \ authenticate the server before\n   the HTTP operation.  POST methods are in\
    \ this category.\n   When the Kerberos Version 5 GSSAPI mechanism [RFC4121] is\
    \ being used,\n   the HTTP server will be using a principal name of the form of\n\
    \   \"HTTP/hostname\".\n"
- title: 4.2.  The Authorization Request Header
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The Authorization Request Header\n   Upon receipt of the response containing\
    \ a \"WWW-Authenticate\" header\n   from the server, the client is expected to\
    \ retry the HTTP request,\n   passing a HTTP \"Authorization\" header line.  This\
    \ is defined\n   according to the framework described in [RFC2616] and is utilized\
    \ as\n   follows:\n           credentials             = \"Negotiate\" auth-data2\n\
    \           auth-data2              = 1#( gssapi-data )\n   gssapi-data\n   This\
    \ directive contains the base64 encoding of an\n   InitialContextToken, as defined\
    \ in [RFC2743].\n   Any returned code other than a success 2xx code represents\
    \ an\n   authentication error.  If a 401 containing a \"WWW-Authenticate\"\n \
    \  header with \"Negotiate\" and gssapi-data is returned from the server,\n  \
    \ it is a continuation of the authentication request.\n   A client may initiate\
    \ a connection to the server with an\n   \"Authorization\" header containing the\
    \ initial token for the server.\n   This form will bypass the initial 401 error\
    \ from the server when the\n   client knows that the server will accept the Negotiate\
    \ HTTP\n   authentication type.\n"
- title: 5.  Negotiate Operation Example
  contents:
  - "5.  Negotiate Operation Example\n   The client requests an access-protected document\
    \ from server via a\n   GET method request.  The URI of the document is\n   \"\
    http://www.nowhere.org/dir/index.html\".\n           C: GET dir/index.html\n \
    \  The first time the client requests the document, no Authorization\n   header\
    \ is sent, so the server responds with\n           S: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n\
    \           S: WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate\n   The client will obtain the user\
    \ credentials using the SPNEGO GSSAPI\n   mechanism type to identify generate\
    \ a GSSAPI message to be sent to\n   the server with a new request, including\
    \ the following Authorization\n   header:\n           C: GET dir/index.html\n\
    \           C: Authorization: Negotiate a87421000492aa874209af8bc028\n   The server\
    \ will decode the gssapi-data and pass this to the SPNEGO\n   GSSAPI mechanism\
    \ in the gss_accept_security_context function.  If the\n   context is not complete,\
    \ the server will respond with a 401 status\n   code with a WWW-Authenticate header\
    \ containing the gssapi-data.\n           S: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n     \
    \      S: WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate 749efa7b23409c20b92356\n   The client will\
    \ decode the gssapi-data, pass this into\n   Gss_Init_security_context, and return\
    \ the new gssapi-data to the\n   server.\n           C: GET dir/index.html\n \
    \          C: Authorization: Negotiate 89a8742aa8729a8b028\n   This cycle can\
    \ continue until the security context is complete.  When\n   the return value\
    \ from the gss_accept_security_context function\n   indicates that the security\
    \ context is complete, it may supply final\n   authentication data to be returned\
    \ to the client.  If the server has\n   more gssapi data to send to the client\
    \ to complete the context, it is\n   to be carried in a WWW-Authenticate header\
    \ with the final response\n   containing the HTTP body.\n           S: HTTP/1.1\
    \ 200 Success\n           S: WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate ade0234568a4209af8bc0280289eca\n\
    \   The client will decode the gssapi-data and supply it to\n   gss_init_security_context\
    \ using the context for this server.  If the\n   status is successful from the\
    \ final gss_init_security_context, the\n   response can be used by the application.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The SPNEGO HTTP authentication facility is only\
    \ used to provide\n   authentication of a user to a server.  It provides no facilities\
    \ for\n   protecting the HTTP headers or data including the Authorization and\n\
    \   WWW-Authenticate headers that are used to implement this mechanism.\n   Alternate\
    \ mechanisms such as TLS can be used to provide\n   confidentiality.  Hashes of\
    \ the TLS certificates can be used as\n   channel bindings to secure the channel.\
    \  In this case clients would\n   need to enforce that the channel binding information\
    \ is valid.  Note\n   that Kerb-TLS [RFC2712] could be used to provide both authentication\n\
    \   and confidentiality, but this requires a change to the TLS provider.\n   This\
    \ mechanism is not used for HTTP authentication to HTTP proxies.\n   If an HTTP\
    \ proxy is used between the client and server, it must take\n   care to not share\
    \ authenticated connections between different\n   authenticated clients to the\
    \ same server.  If this is not honored,\n   then the server can easily lose track\
    \ of security context\n   associations.  A proxy that correctly honors client\
    \ to server\n   authentication integrity will supply the \"Proxy-support:  Session-\n\
    \   Based-Authentication\" HTTP header to the client in HTTP responses\n   from\
    \ the proxy.  The client MUST NOT utilize the SPNEGO HTTP\n   authentication mechanism\
    \ through a proxy unless the proxy supplies\n   this header with the \"401 Unauthorized\"\
    \ response from the server.\n   When using the SPNEGO HTTP authentication facility\
    \ with client-\n   supplied data such as PUT and POST, the authentication should\
    \ be\n   complete between the client and server before sending the user data.\n\
    \   The return status from the gss_init_security_context will indicate\n   that\
    \ the security context is complete.  At this point, the data can\n   be sent to\
    \ the server.\n"
