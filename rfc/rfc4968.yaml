  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE 802.16 [4] [5] is a point-to-multipoint, connection-oriented\n\
    \   access technology for the last mile without bi-directional native\n   multicast\
    \ support.  IEEE 802.16 has defined only downlink multicast\n   support.  This\
    \ leads to two methods for running IP protocols that\n   traditionally assume\
    \ the availability of multicast at the link layer.\n   One method is to use bridging,\
    \ e.g., IEEE 802.1D [6], to support bi-\n   directional multicast.  Another method\
    \ is to treat the IEEE 802.16\n   MAC (Message Authentication Code) transport\
    \ connections between an MS\n   (Mobile Station) and BS (Base Station) as point-to-point\
    \ IP links so\n   that the IP protocols (e.g., ARP (Address Resolution Protocol),\
    \ IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery) can be run without any problems.\n   This is further\
    \ complicated by the definition of commercial network\n   models like WiMAX, which\
    \ defines the WiMAX transport connection that\n   extends the IEEE 802.16 MAC\
    \ transport connection all the way to an\n   access router by using a tunnel between\
    \ the base station and the\n   access router [14].  This leads to multiple ways\
    \ of deploying IP over\n   IEEE 802.16 based networks.\n   This document looks\
    \ at various considerations in selecting a link\n   model for IEEE 802.16 based\
    \ networks and provides an analysis of the\n   various possible link models. \
    \ And finally, this document provides a\n   recommendation for choosing one link\
    \ model that is best suitable for\n   the deployment.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions\
    \ in [6],\n   in addition to the ones specified in this section.\n   Access Router\
    \ (AR): An entity that performs an IP routing function to\n   provide IP connectivity\
    \ for Mobile Stations.  In WiMAX Networks, the\n   AR is an Access Service Network\
    \ Gateway.\n   Access Service Network (ASN) - The ASN is defined as a complete\
    \ set\n   of network functions needed to provide radio access to a WiMAX\n   subscriber.\
    \  The ASN is the access network to which the MS attaches.\n   The IPv6 access\
    \ router is an entity within the ASN.  The term ASN is\n   specific to the WiMAX\
    \ network architecture.\n   Dormant Mode: A state in which a mobile station restricts\
    \ its ability\n   to receive normal IP traffic by reducing monitoring of radio\n\
    \   channels.  This allows the mobile station to save power and reduces\n   signaling\
    \ load on the network.  In the dormant mode, the MS is only\n   listening at scheduled\
    \ intervals to the paging channel.  The network\n   (e.g., the AR) maintains state\
    \ about an MS that has transitioned to\n   dormant mode and can page it when needed.\n"

    \ however this model does\n   not provide any multicast capability.  The following\
    \ figures\n   illustrates a high-level view of this link model wherein one or\

    \ this link model, the link between the MS and the AR at the IPv6\n   layer is\

    \ to the IPv6 layer, whereas the Shared IPv6 Prefix Link\n   Model defined here\

- title: 3.1.1.  Prefix Assignment
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Prefix Assignment\n   One or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link\
    \ and hence shared\n   by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  The prefixes\
    \ are\n   advertised with the autonomous flag (A-Flag) set and the On-link flag\n\
    \   (L-flag) reset for address autoconfiguration so that the nodes may\n   not\
    \ make an on-link assumption for the addresses in those prefixes.\n"

    \ mechanisms, which are\n   specified in [2] [3], are used.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Duplicate Address Detection
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Duplicate Address Detection\n   The DAD procedure, as specified in [2],\
    \ does not adapt well to the\n   IEEE 802.16 air interface as there is no native\
    \ multicast support.\n   The DAD can be performed with MLD (Multicast Listener\
    \ Discovery)\n   snooping [7] and the AR relaying the DAD probe to the address\
    \ owners\n   in case the address is a duplicate, called Relay DAD.  In this\n\
    \   method, the MS behavior is the same as specified in [2] and the\n   optimization\
    \ is achieved with the support of AR, which maintains the\n   MLD table for a\
    \ list of multicast addresses and the nodes that joined\n   the multicast address.\
    \  The relay DAD works as below:\n   1.  An MS constructs a Link Local Address\
    \ as specified in [2].\n   2.  The MS constructs a solicited node multicast address\
    \ for the\n       corresponding Link Local Address and sends an MLD Join request\n\
    \       for the solicited node multicast address.\n   3.  The MS starts verifying\
    \ address uniqueness by sending a DAD NS on\n       the initial MAC transport\
    \ connection.\n   4.  The AR consults the MLD table for who joined the multicast\n\
    \       address.  If the AR does not find any entry in the MLD table, the\n  \
    \     AR silently discards the DAD NS.  If the AR finds a match, the AR\n    \
    \   relays the DAD NS to the address owner.\n   5.  The address owner defends\
    \ the address by sending DAD NA, which is\n       relayed to the DAD originating\
    \ MS via the AR.\n   6.  If the DAD originating MS does not receive any response\
    \ (DAD NA)\n       to its DAD NS, the MS assigns the address to its interface.\
    \  If\n       the MS receives the DAD NA, the MS discards the tentative address\n\
    \       and behaves as specified in [2].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.4.2.  On-link Multicast Support\n   No native on-link multicast is possible\

    \ the multicast\n   packets to the MSs belonging to a particular multicast group\
    \ in a\n   unicast manner.  MLD snooping [7] should be used for maintaining the\n\

    \ this is to run PPP on the link [8].\n       Running PPP requires that the IEEE\
    \ 802.16 link use the Ethernet\n       CS and PPP over Ethernet [9].  Since the\
    \ IPv6 CS does not support\n       PPP, whether PPP can be run depends on the\
    \ network architecture.\n   2.  If the actual physical medium is shared, like\
    \ Ethernet, but PPP\n       is not run, the link can be made point to point between\
    \ the MS\n       and AR by having each MS on a separate VLAN [11].\n   3.  If\

    \ AR, there is\n   only a possibility of an address conflict with the AR, so collisions\n\
    \   are statistically very unlikely, and easy to fix if they should\n   occur.\n\
    \   If DHCP is used for address configuration ('M=1' in the Router\n   Advertisement),\
    \ the DHCP server must provide addresses with a\n   separate prefix per MS.  The\

    \ of doing the following:\n   1.  Each MS is assigned a separate VLAN when IEEE\

  - "3.2.4.  Applicability\n   In enterprise networks, shared services including printers,\
    \ fax\n   machines, and other such online services are often available on the\n\
    \   local link.  These services are typically discovered using some kind\n   of\
    \ link local service discovery protocol.  The unique prefix per MS\n   model is\
    \ not appropriate for these kinds of deployments, since it is\n   not possible\
    \ to have shared link services in the ASN.\n   The p2p link model is applicable\
    \ to deployments where there are no\n   shared services in the ASN.  Such deployments\
    \ are typical of service\n   provider networks like cellular networks, which provide\
    \ public access\n   to wireless networks.\n"

  - "4.  Renumbering\n   If the downstream prefixes managed by the AR are involved\
    \ in\n   renumbering, it may be necessary to renumber each link under the AR.\n\
    \   [10] discusses recommended procedures for renumbering.\n   If the prefixes\
    \ are advertised in RAs, the AR must withdraw the\n   existing prefixes and advertise\
    \ the new ones.  Since each MS,\n   irrespective of the link model, is on a separate\
    \ point-to-point link\n   at the MAC level because of the IEEE 802.16 connection\
    \ oriented\n   architecture, the AR must send an RA withdrawing the old prefix\
    \ and\n   advertising the new one to each link.  In a point-to-point link\n  \
    \ model, the number of RAs sent is equal to the number of nodes the AR\n   serves,\
    \ whereas in the other two models, the AR sends a single RA to\n   BS that is\
    \ sent to all the MSs as separate RAs.\n   If DHCP is used to assign addresses,\
    \ either the DHCP address lease\n   lifetime may be reduced prior to the renumbering\
    \ event to encourage\n   MSs to renew their addresses quickly, or a DHCP Reconfigure\
    \ message\n   may be sent to each of the MSs by the server to cause them to renew\n\
    \   their addresses.\n   In conclusion, the amount of traffic on the air-interface\
    \ is the same\n   for all link models.  However, the number of RAs sent by the\
    \ AR to BS\n   can be better compared to the other two models.\n"
- title: 5.  Effect on Dormant Mode
  contents:
  - "5.  Effect on Dormant Mode\n   If the network needs to deliver packets to an\
    \ MS, which is in dormant\n   mode, the AR pages the MS.  The MS that is monitoring\
    \ the paging\n   channel receives the page and transitions out of the dormant\
    \ mode to\n   active mode.  It establishes connectivity with the network by\n\
    \   requesting and obtaining the radio resources.  The network is then\n   able\
    \ to deliver the packets to the MS.  In many networks, packets\n   destined to\
    \ an MS in dormant mode are buffered at the AR in the\n   network until connectivity\
    \ is established.\n   Support for dormant MSs is critical in mobile networks,\
    \ hence it is a\n   necessary feature.  Paging capability and optimizations possible\
    \ for\n   paging an MS are neither enhanced nor handicapped by the link model\n\
    \   itself.  However, the multicast capability within a link may cause\n   for\
    \ an MS to wake up for an unwanted packet.  This can be avoided by\n   filtering\
    \ the multicast packets and delivering the packets to only\n   for MSs that are\
    \ listening for particular multicast packets.  As the\n   Shared IPv6 Prefix model\
    \ does not have the multicast capability and\n   the point-to-point link model\
    \ has only one node on the link, neither\n   has any effect on the dormant mode.\
    \  The Ethernet-like link model may\n   have the multicast capability, which requires\
    \ filtering at the BS to\n   support the dormant mode for the MSs.\n"

    \ significant\n   impact on how routing protocols are run over such a network.\
    \  The\n   deployment model presented in this document discusses the least\n \
    \  impacting model on routing as connectivity on the provider edge is\n   intentionally\
    \ limited to point-to-point connectivity from one BS to\n   any one of multiple\
    \ MSs.  Any other deployment model may cause a\n   significant impact on routing\
    \ protocols, however, they are outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 7.  Conclusions and Relevant Link Models
  contents:
  - "7.  Conclusions and Relevant Link Models\n   Ethernet-Like Link models would\
    \ be used when the deployment requires\n   the use of Ethernet CS, as this is\
    \ the only model being proposed for\n   the Ethernet CS and running IPv6 over\
    \ Ethernet is well understood.\n   For IP CS with IPv6 classifiers, a point-to-point\
    \ link model appears\n   to be the choice because of its simplicity for performing\
    \ the DAD and\n   because it does not break any existing applications nor requires\n\
    \   defining any new protocol.  However, the IPv6 shared prefix model\n   would\
    \ be defined if there is any interest from the service provider\n   community.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides the analysis of various\
    \ IPv6 link models for\n   IEEE 802.16 based networks, and as such does not introduce\
    \ any new\n   security threats.  No matter what the link model is, the networks\n\
    \   employ the same link-layer security mechanisms defined in [5].\n   However,\
    \ the chosen link model affects the scope of link local\n   communication, and\
    \ this may have security implications for protocols\n   that are designed to work\
    \ within the link scope.  This is the concern\n   for a shared link model compared\
    \ with other models wherein private\n   resources e.g., personal printer, cannot\
    \ be put onto a public WiMAX\n   network.  This may restrict the usage of a shared\
    \ prefix model to\n   enterprise environments.  The Neighbor Discovery related\
    \ security\n   issues are document in [1] [2] and these are applicable for all\
    \ the\n   models described in this document.  The model specific security\n  \
    \ considerations are documented in their respective protocol\n   specifications.\n"
