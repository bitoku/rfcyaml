Abstract Since the publication of the RFCs specifying Version 1.0 of the Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP), some errors have been noted.
This informational document lists these errors and provides corrections for them.
The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP), Version 1.0, is specified in [RFC 2801, 2802, 2803].
It provides a payment system independent framework for Internet commerce oriented to consumer to business transactions.
It provides mechanism for different portions of the business function, such as fulfillment or payment handling, to be distributed or outsourced.
It does not require a prior relationship between the consumer and business.
Several errors have been noted in the IOTP v1.0 specification, particularly RFC 2801, which was the largest RFC ever issued.
These are listed, with their fix, in this document.
DTD Errata 2.1 PackagedContent Element Attribute types are swapped.
The Element called Attribute Incorrect element content specification syntax.
ELEMENT Attribute ( ANY )
Other Errata 3.1 Re: Combining Authentication Transactions with other Transactions Section 9.1.13.
OLD/INCORRECT: if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the original IOTP Transaction is restarted NEW/CORRECT:
if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the original IOTP Transaction is continued 3.2 Type attribute of Element called Attribute Section 7.19.1, Page 150, insufficient list of signature types: OLD/INCORRECT: There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains a Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse, DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse, PingReq or PingResponse; depending on the type of the signature.
NEW/CORRECT: There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains a Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse, DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse, PingReq, PingResponse, AuthenticationStatus, InquiryRequest, or InquiryResponse; depending on the type of the signature.
AND a similar change extending the list of values in Section 12.1, Page 262.
The errata listed herein are not particularly security related.
Never the less, incorrect implementations due to uncorrected errors in the specification may compromise security.
