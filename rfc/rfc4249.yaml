  - "Abstract\n   Implementation of generators and parsers of header fields requires\n\
    \   certain information about those fields.  Interoperability is most\n   likely\
    \ when all such information is explicitly provided by the\n   technical specification\
    \ of the fields.  Lacking such explicit\n   information, implementers may guess,\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Internet messages consist of a message header and a body\
    \ [N1.STD11],\n   [N2.RFC2822].  MIME content begins with a MIME-part header\n\
    \   [N3.RFC2045], [N4.RFC2046].  Message headers and MIME-part headers\n   consist\
    \ of fields.  While the Message Format and MIME specifications\n   define their\
    \ respective overall formats and some specific fields,\n   they also have provision\
    \ for extension fields.  A number of extension\n   fields have been specified,\
    \ some more or less completely than others.\n   Incomplete or imprecise specification\
    \ has led to interoperability\n   problems as implementers make assumptions in\
    \ the absence of\n   specifications.  This memo identifies items of potential\
    \ interest to\n   implementers, and section 3 of this memo may serve as an\n \
    \  informational guide for authors of specifications of extension fields\n   and\
    \ field components.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   This memo is intended as a non-binding informational supplement\
    \ to\n   various specifications, guidelines, and procedures for specification\n\
    \   of header fields [N1.STD11], [N2.RFC2822], [N3.RFC2045],\n   [N4.RFC2046],\
    \ [N5.BCP9], [N6.BCP90].  It does not absolve authors of\n   header field specifications\
    \ from compliance with any provisions of\n   those or other specifications, guidelines,\
    \ and procedures.  It offers\n   clarification and supplementary suggestions that\
    \ will promote\n   interoperability and may spare specification authors many questions\n\
    \   regarding incomplete header field specifications.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Established Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Established Conventions\n   A number of conventions exist for naming and\
    \ specifying header\n   fields.  It would be unwise and confusing to specify a\
    \ field that\n   conflicts with those conventions.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Standard Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Standard Terminology\n   Terms related to the Internet Message Format\
    \ are defined in\n   [N2.RFC2822].  Authors specifying extension header fields\
    \ should use\n   the same terms in the same manner in order to provide clarity\
    \ and\n   avoid confusion.  For example, a \"header\" [I1.FYI18], [N2.RFC2822]\
    \ is\n   comprised of \"header fields\", each of which has a \"field name\" and\n\
    \   usually has a \"field body\".  Each message may have multiple\n   \"headers\"\
    , viz. a message header and MIME-part [N4.RFC2046] headers.\n   A message header\
    \ has a Date header field (i.e., a field with field\n   name \"Date\").  However,\
    \ there is no \"Date header\"; use of such non-\n   standard terms is likely to\
    \ lead to confusion, possibly resulting in\n   interoperability failures of implementations.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  ABNF
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  ABNF\n   [N1.STD11] is vague about where whitespace is permitted or required\n\
    \   in header field syntax.  [N2.RFC2822] addresses that issue by\n   defining\
    \ grammar productions such as FWS and CFWS, in conjunction\n   with formal ABNF\
    \ [N7.RFC4234] and in accordance with the necessity\n   for specificity of such\
    \ issues as noted in section 3.1 of\n   [N7.RFC4234].  Extension field ABNF should\
    \ clearly specify where\n   comments, line folding, and whitespace are prohibited\
    \ and permitted,\n   and should use the [N2.RFC2822] grammar productions in ABNF\
    \ for that\n   purpose.\n   All ABNF must be carefully checked for ambiguities\
    \ and to ensure that\n   all productions resolve to some combination of terminal\
    \ productions\n   provided by a normative reference [N8.CKLIST] (\"All ABNF must\
    \ be\n   checked\").  [N7.RFC4234] provides several productions that may be\n\
    \   useful.  While use of suitable productions defined and in use is\n   encouraged,\
    \ specification authors are cautioned that some such\n   productions have been\
    \ amended by subsequently issued RFCs and/or by\n   formal errata [I12.Errata].\n\
    \   Authors and designers should be careful not to mix syntax with\n   disparate\
    \ semantics within a single field.  Examples of disparate\n   semantics are [N2.RFC2822]\
    \ comments (which use parentheses as\n   delimiters), [I13.RFC2533] feature sets\
    \ (which also use parentheses\n   as delimiters, but not for comments), and [I14.RFC3986]\
    \ Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers (URIs), which permit parentheses in URI text.\n\
    \   It is sometimes necessary or desirable to define keywords as protocol\n  \
    \ elements in structured fields.  Protocol elements should be case\n   insensitive\
    \ per the Internet Architecture [I15.RFC1958] (section\n   4.3).  Keywords are\
    \ typically registered by IANA; a specification\n   using registered keywords\
    \ must include an IANA Considerations section\n   [N9.BCP26], [I16.RFC3692], and\
    \ should indicate to readers of the\n   specification precisely where IANA has\
    \ set up the registry (authors\n   will need to coordinate this with IANA prior\
    \ to publication as an\n   RFC).  In many cases, it will be desirable to make\
    \ provision for\n   extending the set of keywords; that may be done by specifying\
    \ that\n   the set may be extended by publication of an RFC, or a formal review\n\
    \   and registration procedure may be specified (typically as a BCP RFC).\n  \
    \ If keywords are defined, and if there is any chance that the set of\n   keywords\
    \ might be expanded, a registry should be established via\n   IANA.  If a registry\
    \ is not established initially, there is a good\n   chance that initially-defined\
    \ keywords will not be registered or will\n   subsequently be registered with\
    \ different semantics (this has\n   happened!).\n   Provision may be made for\
    \ experimental or private-use keywords.\n   These typically begin with a case-insensitive\
    \ \"x-\" prefix.  Note that\n   [N10.BCP82] has specific considerations for use\
    \ of experimental\n   keywords.\n   If some field content is to be considered\
    \ human-readable text, there\n   must be provision for specifying language in\
    \ accordance with\n   [N11.BCP18] (section 4.2).  Header fields typically use\
    \ the mechanism\n   specified in [I17.RFC2047] as amended by [I18.RFC2231] and\n\
    \   [I12.Errata] for that purpose.  Note, however, that that mechanism\n   applies\
    \ only to three specific cases: unstructured fields, an RFC 822\n   \"word\" in\
    \ an RFC 822 \"phrase\", and comments in structured fields.\n   Any internationalization\
    \ considerations should be detailed in an\n   Internationalization Considerations\
    \ section of the specification as\n   specified in [N11.BCP18] (section 6).\n\
    \   Some field bodies may include ABNF representing numerical values.\n   Such\
    \ ABNF, its comments, and supporting normative text should clearly\n   indicate\
    \ whether such a numerical value is decimal, octal,\n   hexadecimal, etc.; whether\
    \ or not leading and/or trailing zeroes are\n   significant and/or permitted;\
    \ and how any combinations of numeric\n   fields are intended to be interpreted.\
    \  For example, two numeric\n   fields separated by a dot, exemplified by \"001.100\"\
    , \"1.1\", \"1.075\",\n   and \"1.75\", might be interpreted in several ways,\
    \ depending on\n   factors such as those enumerated above.\n   While ABNF [N7.RFC4234]\
    \ is used by [N2.RFC2822] and is mentioned\n   above, alternate formal syntax\
    \ formats may be used in specifications\n   [I19.Syntax].\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Minimum and Maximum Instances of Fields per Header
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Minimum and Maximum Instances of Fields per Header\n   Some fields are\
    \ mandatory, others are optional.  It may make sense to\n   permit multiple instances\
    \ of a field in a given header; in other\n   cases, at most a single instance\
    \ is sensible.  [N2.RFC2822] specifies\n   a minimum and maximum count per header\
    \ for each standard field in a\n   message; specification authors should likewise\
    \ specify minimum and\n   maximum counts for extension fields.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Categorization
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Categorization\n   [N2.RFC2822] defines categories of header fields (e.g.,\

    \ chain [I20.Arch].\n   Other fields comprise trace information that is added\
    \ during\n   transport.  Authors should clearly specify who may generate a field,\n\

- title: 3.4.2.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.  Backward Compatibility\n   There is a large deployed base of applications\
    \ that use header\n   fields.  Implementations that comprise that deployed base\
    \ may change\n   very slowly.  It is therefore critically important to consider\
    \ and\n   specify the impact of a new or revised field or field component on\n\
    \   that deployed base.  A new field, or extensions to the syntax of an\n   existing\
    \ field or field component, might not be recognizable to\n   deployed implementations.\
    \  Depending on the care with which the\n   authors of an extension have considered\
    \ such backward compatibility,\n   such an extension might, for example:\n   a.\
    \ Cause a deployed implementation to simply ignore the field in its\n      entirety.\
    \  That is not a problem provided that it is a new field\n      and that there\
    \ is no assumption that such deployed implementations\n      will do otherwise.\n\
    \   b. Cause a deployed implementation to behave differently from how it\n   \
    \   would behave in the absence of the proposed change, in ways that\n      are\
    \ not intended by the proposal.  That is a failure of the\n      proposal to remain\
    \ backward compatible with the deployed base of\n      implementations.\n   There\
    \ are many subtleties and variations that may come into play.\n   Authors should\
    \ very carefully consider backward compatibility when\n   devising extensions,\
    \ and should clearly describe all known\n   compatibility issues.\n"
- title: 3.4.3.  Compatibility With Legacy Content
  contents:
  - "3.4.3.  Compatibility With Legacy Content\n   Content is sometimes archived for\
    \ various reasons.  It is sometimes\n   necessary or desirable to access archived\
    \ content, with the semantics\n   of that archived content unchanged.  It is therefore\
    \ important that\n   lack of presence of an extension field or field component\
    \ should not\n   be construed (by an extension specification) as conferring new\n\
    \   semantics on a message or piece of MIME content that lacks that field\n  \
    \ or field component.  Any such semantics should be explicitly\n   specified.\n"
- title: 3.4.4.  Interaction With Established Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.4.4.  Interaction With Established Mechanisms\n   Header fields are handled\
