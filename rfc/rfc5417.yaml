    \  (CAPWAP) [RFC5415] allows a Wireless Termination Point (WTP) to use\n   DHCP
    to discover the Access Controllers (AC) to which it is to\n   connect.\n   Prior
    to the CAPWAP Discovery process, the WTP may use one of many\n   methods to identify
    the proper AC with which to establish a CAPWAP\n   connection.  One of these methods
    is through the DHCP protocol.  This\n   is done through the CAPWAP AC DHCPv4 or
    CAPWAP AC DHCPv6 Option.\n"

    Request List Option, as\n   described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].\n   A DHCPv4
    server returns the CAPWAP AC Option to the client if the\n   server policy is

- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132],
    and [RFC3315]\n   apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from
    a DHCP\n   server or insert its own response, a WTP could be led to contact a\n
    \  rogue CAPWAP AC, possibly one that then intercepts call requests or\n   denies
    service.  CAPWAP's use of Datagram Transport Layer Security\n   (DTLS) MUST be
    used to authenticate the CAPWAP peers in the\n   establishment of the session.\n
    \  In most of the networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options\n   prior
    to network access authentication is neither integrity protected\n   nor origin
    authenticated.  Therefore, in security sensitive\n   environments, the options
    defined in this document SHOULD NOT be the\n   only methods used to determine
    to which AC a WTP should connect.  The\n   CAPWAP protocol [RFC5415] defines other
    AC discovery procedures a WTP\n   MAY utilize.\n"
