  - "1. Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that\
    \ uses DNS\n   (Domain Name Service, RFC 1034 [8]) to translate telephone numbers,\n\
    \   such as +12025332600, into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers, RFC\n   2396\
    \ [9]), such as pres:user@host.com.  ENUM exists primarily to\n   facilitate the\
    \ interconnection of systems that rely on telephone\n   numbers with those that\
    \ use URIs to identify resources.\n   Presence is a service defined in RFC 2778\
    \ [2] that allows users of a\n   communications service to monitor one another's\
    \ availability and\n   disposition in order to make decisions about communicating.\
    \  Presence\n   information is highly dynamic and generally characterizes whether\
    \ a\n   user is online or offline, busy or idle, away from communications\n  \
    \ devices or nearby, and the like.\n   The IETF has defined a generic URI used\
    \ to identify a presence\n   service for a particular resource: the 'pres' URI\
    \ scheme (defined in\n   CPP [4]).  This document describes an enumservice for\
    \ advertising\n   presence information associated with an E.164 number.\n"
- title: 2.  ENUM Service Registration
  contents:
  - "2.  ENUM Service Registration\n   As defined in [1], the following is a template\
    \ covering information\n   needed for the registration of the enumservice specified\
    \ in this\n   document:\n      Service name: \"E2U+pres\"\n      URI scheme(s):\
    \ \"pres:\"\n      Functional Specification: See section 4.\n      Security considerations:\

- title: 3.  Presence for E.164 Numbers
  contents:
  - "3.  Presence for E.164 Numbers\n   This document specifies an enumservice field\
    \ that allows presence\n   information to be provided for an E.164 number.  This\
    \ may include\n   presence states associated with telephones, or presence of non-\n\
    \   telephony communications services advertised by ENUM.\n   Endpoints that participate\
    \ in a presence architecture are known\n   (following the framework in RFC 2778\
    \ [2]) as watchers and\n   presentities.  Watchers subscribe to the presence of\
    \ presentities and\n   are notified when the presence of a presentity changes.\
    \  Watchers\n   generally monitor the presence of a group of presentities with\
    \ whom\n   they have an ongoing association.  As an example, consider how this\n\
    \   might apply to a telephony service.  Most cellular telephones today\n   have\
    \ an address book-like feature, a small database of names and\n   telephone numbers.\
    \  Such a telephone might act as a watcher,\n   subscribing to the presence of\
    \ some or all of the telephone numbers\n   in its address book.  The display of\
    \ the telephone might then show\n   its user, when a presence-enabled telephone\
    \ number is selected, the\n   availability of the destination.  With this information,\
    \ the user\n   might change their calling habits to correspond better to the\n\
    \   availability of his or her associates.\n   The presence information that is\
    \ shared varies by communications\n   service.  The IETF has defined a Presence\
    \ Information Data Format (or\n   PIDF [6]) for describing the presence data associated\
    \ with a\n   presentity.  The baseline PIDF specification declares only two\n\
    \   presence states: OPEN and CLOSED (these terms are defined in RFC 2778\n  \
    \ [2]); the former suggests that the destination resource is able to\n   accept\
    \ communication requests, the latter that it is not.  These two\n   states provide\
    \ useful but rudimentary insight into the communications\n   status of a presentity.\
    \  For that reason, PIDF is an extensible\n   format, and new sorts of statuses\
    \ can be defined for specific\n   communications services.  For example, a telephony-based\
    \ presence\n   service might define a status corresponding to 'busy'.  Extending\n\
    \   PIDF for telephony services is, however, outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 4.  The 'E2U+pres' Enumservice
  contents:
  - "4.  The 'E2U+pres' Enumservice\n   Traditionally, the services field of an NAPTR\
    \ record (as defined in\n   [10]) contains a string composed of two subfields:\
    \ a 'protocol'\n   subfield and a 'resolution service' subfield.  ENUM in particular\n\
    \   defines an 'E2U' (E.164 to URI) resolution service.  This document\n   defines\
    \ an 'E2U+pres' enumservice for presence.\n   The scheme of the URI that will\
    \ appear in the regexp field of an\n   NAPTR record using the 'E2U+pres' enumservice\
    \ SHOULD be the 'pres'\n   URI scheme.  Other URI schemes appropriate to presence\
    \ services MAY\n   be used; however, the use of the 'pres' URI scheme ensures\
    \ a greater\n   level of compatibility than would the use of any URI specific\
    \ to a\n   particular presence protocol.  The purpose of a pres URI is to\n  \
    \ provide a generic way to locate a presence service.  Techniques for\n   dereferencing\
    \ the pres URI to locate a presence service are given in\n   [5].\n   The 'pres'\
    \ URI scheme does not identify any particular protocol that\n   will be used to\
    \ handle presence operations (such as subscriptions and\n   notifications).  Rather,\
    \ the mechanism in [5] details a way to\n   discover whether the presence protocol(s)\
    \ supported by the watcher\n   is/are also supported by the presentity.  SIP [7]\
    \ is one protocol\n   that can be used to convey presence information and manage\n\
    \   subscriptions/notifications.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   DNS does not make policy decisions about the\
    \ records it shares with\n   an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed to\
    \ be available to all\n   inquirers at all times.  The information provided within\
    \ an ENUM\n   record set must therefore be considered open to the public -- which\n\
    \   is a cause for some privacy considerations.\n   Revealing a pres URI in and\
    \ of itself is unlikely to introduce many\n   privacy concerns, although, depending\
    \ on the structure of the URI, it\n   might reveal the full name or employer of\
    \ the target.  The use of\n   anonymous URIs mitigates this risk.  More serious\
    \ privacy concerns\n   are associated with the unauthorized distribution of presence\n\
    \   information.  For this reason, presence protocols have a number of\n   security\
    \ requirements (detailed in RFC 2779 [3]) that call for\n   authentication of\
    \ watchers, integrity and confidentiality properties,\n   and similar measures\
    \ to prevent abuse of presence information.  Any\n   presence protocol used in\
    \ conjunction with the 'pres' URI scheme is\n   required to meet these requirements.\n\
    \   Unlike a traditional telephone number, the resource identified by a\n   pres\
    \ URI may require that callers provide cryptographic credentials\n   for authentication\
    \ and authorization before presence information is\n   returned.  In concert with\
    \ presence protocols, ENUM can actually\n   provide far greater protection from\
    \ unwanted callers than does the\n   existing PSTN, despite the public availability\
    \ of ENUM records.\n"
