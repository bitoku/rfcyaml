    \   -- for use in exchanging mathematical models represented in a CellML\n   Umbrella\
    \ 1.0 compliant markup language.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The CellML Umbrella format is a standardised markup meta-language\
    \ for\n   the interchange of mathematical models.  The CellML Umbrella format\n\
    \   provides a common base that is supported by a number of specific\n   formats\
    \ used in the interchange of mathematical models.  The CellML\n   Umbrella format\
    \ provides enough information to determine which\n   specific language is used\
    \ to express the model.  The syntax and\n   semantics of the CellML Umbrella format\
    \ are defined by\n   [CELLML-UMBRELLA].\n   The CellML Umbrella format is an actual\
    \ media format.  Although\n   CellML Umbrella documents contain elements in namespaces\
    \ defined by\n   other specifications such as [RDF] and [MATHML], the elements\
    \ in\n   these namespaces do not contain sufficient information to define a\n\
    \   mathematical model, and so CellML provides the information required\n   to\
    \ interconnect the different CellML components, as well as the\n   information\
    \ required to link CellML components to their metadata.  As\n   such, CellML Umbrella\
    \ documents are more than just a collection of\n   entities defined elsewhere,\
    \ and so a new media type is required to\n   identify CellML.\n   As all well-formed\
    \ CellML Umbrella documents are also well-formed XML\n   documents, the convention\
    \ described in Section 7 of [RFC3023] has\n   been observed by use of the +xml\
    \ suffix.\n   The information in CellML Umbrella documents cannot be interpreted\n\
    \   without understanding the semantics of the XML elements used to mark\n   up\
    \ the model structure.  Therefore, the application top-level type is\n   used\
    \ instead of the text top-level type.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   The terms \"element\" and \"document element\" in this document\
    \ are to be\n   interpreted as in [XML].\n   The term \"XML namespace\" is to\
    \ be interpreted as in [NAMESPACES].\n"
- title: 3.  Media Type Registration for CellML Umbrella
  contents:
  - "3.  Media Type Registration for CellML Umbrella\n   MIME media type name: application\n\
    \   MIME subtype name: cellml+xml\n   Mandatory parameters: none\n   Optional\
    \ parameters: charset\n      The charset parameter of application/cellml+xml is\
    \ handled in the\n      same fashion as for application/xml, as specified in Section\
    \ 3.2\n      of [RFC3023].  However, per conformance rule 4 of\n      [CELLML-UMBRELLA],\
    \ valid CellML Umbrella documents MUST be in the\n      UTF-8 character set. \
    \ If the charset parameter is present, it MUST\n      take the value \"utf-8\"\
    .  CellML processing software SHOULD check\n      the charset field, and if it\
    \ is present but not equal to \"utf-8\",\n      MAY attempt to recover from the\
    \ error by processing the document\n      in the specified character set.\n  \
    \ Encoding considerations: As per Section 3.2 of [RFC3023].\n   Security considerations:\
    \ As per Section 5 of this document.\n   Interoperability considerations: As per\
    \ Section 4.1 of this document.\n   Published specification:\n      CellML Umbrella\
    \ Specification [CELLML-UMBRELLA].\n   Applications that use this media type:\
    \ As per Section 4.2 of this\n      document.\n   Additional information:\n  \
    \    Magic number(s): None.\n         XML processing software can identify CellML\
    \ Umbrella documents\n         as XML documents that contain a document element\
    \ with the local\n         name \"model\".\n      File extension(s):\n       \
    \  The RECOMMENDED file extension for CellML Umbrella documents is\n         .cellml\n\
    \         Some older software uses the file extension .xml.  Software\n      \
    \   vendors have also used the non-standard extension .cml.  In\n         contexts\
    \ where the MIME type is available, or where the type\n         has already been\
    \ determined as CellML, implementations SHOULD\n         allow files to be opened\
    \ regardless of the extension.\n         Implementations transferring models to\
    \ an environment that uses\n         file extensions SHOULD use the .cellml extension.\n\

    \ The CellML Umbrella 1.0 specification\n         was authored by Andrew Miller.\n\
    \         The CellML Umbrella 1.0 specification itself will not change.\n    \
    \     However, the umbrella specification defines the process for new\n      \
    \   specific formats to be registered.  The Bioengineering\n         Institute\
    \ at The University of Auckland, with input from the\n         CellML Community\
    \ via the cellml-discussion@cellml.org mailing\n         list, has control over\
    \ the CellML Umbrella Format Registry.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Interoperability Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Interoperability Considerations\n   The interoperability considerations\
    \ in Section 3.1 of [RFC3023] also\n   apply to CellML Umbrella documents.  CellML\
    \ Umbrella documents\n   contain XML elements defined by each specific format,\
    \ all of which\n   are published specifications.  In addition to the ability to\
    \ parse\n   XML, user agents require software support for the semantics of [RDF]\n\
    \   and/or part or all of a specific format.  As efforts are made to keep\n  \
    \ the number of specific formats small, user agents SHOULD implement\n   all specific\
    \ formats listed in the CellML Umbrella Format Registry at\n   the time they were\
    \ developed.\n"

    \ platform-, and vendor-neutral and is\n   supported by a wide range of CellML\
    \ processing tools, including those\n   designed to validate, edit, and/or visualise\
    \ CellML models, extract\n   MathML or RDF, translate to or from other related\
    \ specifications,\n   evaluate mathematics and ordinary differential equations,\
    \ fit\n   parameters to models, and serve, archive, and annotate models.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As CellML Umbrella is an XML-based markup language,\
    \ all the security\n   considerations presented in Section 10 of [RFC3023] also\
    \ apply to\n   CellML Umbrella.\n   Some types of CellML Umbrella documents can\
    \ refer to other Uniform\n   Resource Locators (URLs) in a number of places:\n\
    \      i)   References to XML document type definitions or schemas.\n      ii)\
    \  References to other models using the import features of some\n           specific\
    \ formats.\n      iii) References to other documents embedded in user-defined\
    \ data.\n   Some types of CellML processing software may then automatically\n\
    \   attempt to access the URL and retrieve the document.  This retrieval\n   could\
    \ have several consequences, specifically,\n      i)   if a CellML document is\
    \ transferred via e-mail, the fact that\n           the recipient has opened the\
    \ CellML document could be\n           disclosed to the sender without the recipient's\
    \ knowledge or\n           consent.\n      ii)  where the recipient of a document\
    \ transfers the document to\n           another location using the MIME type defined\
    \ in this\n           document, the original author of the document may be notified\n\
    \           of the second address by the attempted retrieval of further\n    \
    \       documents.\n      iii) by performing requests on the recipient's behalf,\
    \ the CellML\n           processing software may cause actions to be performed\
    \ with\n           privileges granted to the recipient, without the recipient's\n\
    \           knowledge or consent.\n   CellML processing software can mitigate\
    \ this threat when running in\n   an environment where it is a concern by requiring\
    \ explicit\n   confirmation from the user before attempting to load any external\n\
    \   documents.\n"
