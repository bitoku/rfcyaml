Abstract This document defines the Device Owner attribute.
It indicates the entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that owns the device.
This attribute may be included in public key certificates and attribute certificates.
This document specifies the Device Owner attribute.
It indicates the entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that owns the device.
This attribute is intended to be used in public key certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC5755].
This attribute may be used in automated authorization decisions.
For example, when two peers are deciding whether to communicate, each could check that the device owner present in the other device's certificate
is on an "approved" list.
This check is performed in addition to certification path validation [RFC5280].
The mechanism for managing the "approved" list is beyond the scope of this document.
This document does not provide an equivalent Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) schema specification as this attribute is targeted at public key certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC5755].
Definition of an equivalent LDAP schema is left to a future specification.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The attribute is defined using ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and [X.683].
The Device Owner attribute indicates the entity (e.g., company, organization, department, agency) that owns the device with which this attribute is associated.
Device Owner is an object identifier.
The following object identifier identifies the Device Owner attribute:
id deviceOwner } There MUST only be one value of Device Owner associated with a device.
Distinct owners MUST be represented in separate certificates.
If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure that the correct value is applied.
Including this attribute in a public key certificate or attribute certificate ensures the value for the device owner is integrity protected.
This appendix provides the normative ASN.1 [X.680] definitions for the structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and [X.683].
