  - "1. Introduction\n   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [3] provides a mechanism\
    \ for\n   a service to be discovered in a single exchange of messages.  The UA\n\
    \   sends a Service Request message and the DA or SA (as appropriate)\n   sends\
    \ a Service Reply message.\n   It is clearly advantageous to be able to obtain\
    \ all service\n   information at once.  The Service Location Protocol separates\n\
    \   messages which obtain different classes of information.  This\n   extension\
    \ enables an optimization to the basic exchange of messages,\n   which currently\
    \ does not include service attributes in Service Reply\n   messages.\n   This\
    \ document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows a UA to\n   request that a\
    \ service's attributes be included in Service Reply\n   messages.  This will eliminate\
    \ the need for multiple round trip\n   messages for a UA to acquire all service\
    \ information.\n   If the DA or SA does not support the Attrlist extension, it\
    \ will\n   simply return a Service Reply (without the extension).  Support of\n\
    \   this extension is OPTIONAL.  Existing implementations will ignore the\n  \
    \ Attrlist extension since it has been assigned a identifying number\n   from\
    \ the range which indicates that the receiver MUST ignore the\n   extension if\
    \ it is not recognized.  See RFC 2608 [3].\n   If the UA receives a Service Reply\
    \ message without an Attrlist\n   Extension it must assume the SA or DA does not\
    \ support the extension.\n   In this case, the UA must send an Attribute Request\
    \ for each URL it\n   obtains in the Service Reply message in order to obtain\
    \ the\n   attributes for these services.\n"

  - "2. Attribute List Extension\n   The format of the Attribute List Extension is\
    \ as follows:\n       0                   1                   2              \

    \      |      Extension ID = 0x0002    |     Next Extension Offset     |\n   \
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n      |\
    \ Offset, contd.|      Service URL Length       |  Service URL  /\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \ of AttrAuths |(if present) Attribute Authentication Blocks.../\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   The Extension ID is 0x0002.\n   The Next Extension Offset value indicates\
    \ the position of the next\n   extension as offset from the beginning of the SLP\
    \ message.  If the\n   next extension offset value is 0, there are no more extensions\
    \ in the\n   message.\n   A UA sends an Attribute List Extension with a Service\
    \ Request.  The\n   Service URL Length and Attribute List Length are set to 0\
    \ and the\n   Service URL and Attribute List fields omitted in this case.  The\
    \ UA\n   thereby requests that the SA or DA include an Attribute List\n   Extension\
    \ in its Service Reply by including such an 'empty' Attribute\n   List Extension\
    \ in the Service Request.\n   A SA or DA which supports the Attribute List Extension\
    \ returns one\n   Attribute List extension for every URL Entry in the Service\
    \ Reply\n   message.  The order of the Attribute List Extensions SHOULD be the\n\
    \   same as the URL Entries in the Service Reply.\n   The Service URL [4] identifies\
    \ the corresponding URL Entry.\n   The Attribute List field is the entire attribute\
    \ list of the service.\n   These attributes must be in the same language as that\
    \ indicated in\n   the Service Request message.\n   If the Service Request message\
    \ includes a SLP SPI string, then the\n   attribute list extension MUST include\
    \ an authentication block.  If\n   the SA or DA does not support or is unable\
    \ to return an\n   authentication block for the SLP SPI included in the Service\
    \ Request,\n   then the SA or DA MUST NOT return an Attribute List Extension.\
    \  The\n   format of the authentication block(s) is exactly the same as would\
    \ be\n   included in an Attribute Reply or Service Registration message.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The Service Location Protocol, version 2 has mechanisms\
    \ for allowing\n   authenticators to be returned with attribute lists so that\
    \ UAs are\n   able to verify a digital signature over the attributes they obtain.\n\
    \   This same mechanism is used for this protocol extension.  The\n   Attribute\
    \ List Extension used in conjunction with SLPv2 is no less\n   secure than SLPv2\
    \ without the extension.\n"
