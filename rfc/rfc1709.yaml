  - "I.  Introduction\n   Many organizations concerned with K-12 educational issues\
    \ and the\n   planning for the use of technology recognize the value of data\n\
    \   communications throughout the educational system.  State sponsored\n   documents\
    \ such as the California Department of Education's \"Strategic\n   Plan for Information\
    \ Technology\" recommend the planning of voice,\n   video and data networks to\
    \ support learning and educational\n   administration, but they do not provide\
    \ specific technical direction.\n   The institutions that built the Internet and\
    \ connected early in its\n   development are early adopters of technology, with\
    \ technical staff\n   dedicated to the planning for and implementation of leading\
    \ edge\n   technology.  The K-12 community traditionally has not had this level\n\
    \   of staffing available for telecommunications planning.  This document\n  \
    \ is intended to bridge that gap and provides a recommended technical\n   direction,\

  - "II.  Rationale for the Use of Internet Protocols\n   In 1993, the Bank Street\
    \ College of Education conducted a survey of\n   550 educators who are actively\
    \ involved in using telecommunications.\n   (Honey, Margaret, Henriquez, Andres,\
    \ \"Telecommunications and K-12\n   Educators: Findings from a National Survey,\"\
    \ Bank Street College of\n   Education, New York, NY, 1993.)  The survey looked\
    \ at a wide variety\n   of ways telecommunications technology is used in K-12\
    \ education.\n   Their findings on Internet usage are summarized below.\n    \
    \    \"Slightly less than half of these educators have access\n        to the\
    \ Internet, which is supplied most frequently by a\n        university computer\
    \ or educational service.\"\n        \"Internet services are used almost twice\
    \ as often for\n        professional activities as for student learning\n    \
    \    activities.\"\n        \"Sending e-mail is the most common use of the Internet,\n\
    \        followed by accessing news and bulletin boards and gaining\n        access\

    \        19\n   The value of the Internet and its explosive growth are a direct\n\
    \   result of the computer communications technology used on the network.\n  \
    \ The same network design principals and computer communications\n   protocols\
    \ (TCP/IP) used on the Internet can be used within a school\n   district to build\
    \ campuswide networks.  This is standard practice\n   within higher education,\
    \ and increasingly in K-12 schools as well.\n   The benefits of the TCP/IP protocols\
    \ are listed below.\n   Ubiquity        TCP/IP is available on most, if not all,\
    \ of the\n                   computing platforms likely to be important for\n\
    \                   instructional or administrative purposes.  TCP/IP\n      \
    \             is available for the IBM compatible personal\n                 \
    \  computers (PCs) running DOS or Windows and all\n                   versions\
    \ of the Apple Macintosh.  TCP/IP is\n                   standard on all UNIX-based\
    \ systems and\n                   workstations and most mainframe computers.\n\
    \   Applications    TCP/IP supports many applications including, but\n       \
    \            not limited to, electronic mail, file transfer,\n               \
    \    interactive remote host access, database access, file\n                 \
    \  sharing and access to networked information\n                   resources.\
    \  Programming and development expertise\n                   is available from\
    \ a wide variety of sources.\n   Flexibility     TCP/IP is flexible, and new data\
    \ transport\n                   requirements can be incorporated easily.  It can\n\
    \                   accommodate educational and administrative\n             \
    \      applications equally well so that one set of network\n                \
    \   cabling and one communications system may be\n                   used in both\
    \ the classroom and the office.\n   Simplicity      TCP/IP is simple enough to\
    \ run on low-end\n                   computing platforms such as the Apple MacIntosh\n\
    \                   and PCs while still providing efficient support for\n    \
    \               large minicomputer and mainframe computing\n                 \
    \  platforms.  TCP/IP benefits from over twenty years\n                   of refinement\
    \ that has resulted in a large and\n                   technically sophisticated\
    \ environment.\n   Capacity        TCP/IP supports local area network and wide\
    \ area\n                   network services within the entire range of network\n\
    \                   data rates available today, from dial-up modem\n         \
    \          speeds to gigabit speed experimental networks.\n                  \
    \ Communications can occur reliably among machines\n                   across\
    \ this entire range of speeds.\n   Coexistence     TCP/IP can coexist successfully\
    \ with other\n                   networking architectures.  It is likely that\
    \ offices\n                   and classrooms that already have networks may be\n\
    \                   using something other than TCP/IP.  Networks of\n        \
    \           Apple Macintosh computers will probably be using\n               \
    \    Appletalk; networks of PCs may be using any of the\n                   common\
    \ network operating systems such as Novell\n                   Netware or LANManager.\
    \  Mainframe computers\n                   may be using IBM's System Network Architecture\n\
    \                   (SNA).  None of these proprietary protocols provides\n   \
    \                broad connectivity on a global scale.  Recognizing\n        \
    \           this, network technology vendors now provide many\n              \
    \     means for building networks in which all of these\n                   protocols\
    \ can co-exist.\n   Multimedia      TCP/IP networks can support voice, graphics\
    \ and\n                   video as part of teleconferencing and multimedia\n \
    \                  applications.\n   Compatibility   All of the major Universities,\
    \ as well as\n                   thousands of commercial and governmental\n  \
    \                 organizations use TCP/IP for their primary\n               \
    \    communications services.  Commercial networks\n                   such as\
    \ Compuserve and America Online are also\n                   connected to the\

    \ statewide initiatives to\n                   connect schools to the Internet\
    \ and many K-12\n                   school districts have connected based upon\

  - "III.  A Technical Model for School Networks\n   The vision of a modern communications\
    \ network serving all primary and\n   secondary schools has been articulated and\
    \ discussed in many forums.\n   Many schools and a few school districts have implemented\
    \ ad hoc\n   network systems in response to their own perception of the importance\n\
    \   of this resource.  This section of the Internet School Networking\n   (ISN)\
    \ Working Group RFC presents a standard network implementation\n   model to assist\
    \ county offices of education and school districts in\n   their planning so that\
    \ all such implementations will be compatible\n   with each other and with national\
    \ networking plans intended to enrich\n   K-12 education.\n   The future goal\
    \ of \"an integrated voice, data, and video network\n   extending to every classroom\"\
    \ is exciting, but so far from what\n   exists today that the investment in time\
    \ and dollars required to\n   realize such a goal will be greater than most districts\
    \ can muster in\n   the near term.  We suggest that a great deal can be done immediately,\n\
    \   with relatively few dollars, to provide modern communications systems\n  \
    \ in and between all schools around the nation.\n   Our present goal is to define\
    \ a highly functional, homogeneous, and\n   well supported network system that\
    \ could interconnect all K-12\n   schools and district, county, and statewide\
    \ offices and that will\n   enable teachers and administrators to begin to use\
    \ new communications\n   tools and network-based information resources.  It takes\
    \ considerable\n   time to adapt curricula and other programs to take full advantage\
    \ of\n   new technology.  Through the use of standard models for\n   implementation\
    \ of current network technologies, schools can begin\n   this process now.\n \
    \  Many states have already developed communications services for their\n   schools.\
    \  A notable example is Texas which provides terminal access\n   to central information\
    \ resources from every classroom over a\n   statewide network.  Modem-accessible\
    \ systems are available in many\n   states that serve to encourage teachers to\
    \ become familiar with\n   network resources and capabilities.  Although modem-access\
    \ may be the\n   only practical option today in some areas, it always will be\
    \ limited\n   in functionality and/or capacity.  In anticipation of emerging and\n\
    \   future bandwidth intensive information resource applications and the\n   functionality\
    \ that they will require, we believe it is essential to\n   provide direct network\
    \ access to the National Research and Education\n   Network (NREN) Internet (The\
    \ Internet is a \"network of networks\" that\n   interconnects institutions of\
    \ higher education, research labs,\n   government agencies, and a rapidly growing\
    \ number of technology and\n   information vendors.) from computers in every classroom.\n\
    \   The Internet communication protocols, commonly known as \"TCP/IP,\" are\n\
    \   the \"glue\" that will allow all computers to communicate.  As noted\n   above,\
    \ software that implements Internet protocols is available for\n   all modern\
    \ computers.  These protocols support a very wide variety of\n   applications,\
    \ from electronic messaging to client/server data access.\n   The use of Internet\
    \ protocols will ensure that all networked\n   computers will have direct access\
    \ to the vast range of existing\n   information and education resources on the\
    \ Internet, as well as to\n   the emerging National Information Infrastructure.\n"
- title: Approach
  contents:
  - "Approach\n   The implementation we suggest would use current proven and cost\n\
    \   effective technology and would be expandable and upgradable to newer\n   technology\
    \ with minimum additional investment.  This approach\n   requires careful, modular\
    \ design to meet the following criteria:\n   1) Any physical infrastructure development\
    \ should be general and\n      flexible enough to be reused as technology improves.\
    \  For\n      example, a school office might have a simple terminal today\n  \
    \    which could be wired to a network adapter serving the school\n      building.\
    \  Later a Macintosh, DOS, or Windows-based PC might\n      replace the terminal,\
    \ and the type of connection to the network\n      would change accordingly. \
    \ However, the wiring between the\n      office and the network \"hub\" site could\
    \ remain the same if it\n      is designed properly to begin with.  This is an\
    \ important\n      consideration since wiring typically represents 20 to 40% of\n\
    \      the cost of individual network hookups;\n   2) Existing computers and terminals\
    \ in schools and district\n      offices should be integrated as much as possible\
    \ into the\n      communication system.  This installed base represents a large\n\
    \      investment, albeit in many cases a somewhat dated set of\n      equipment.\
    \  Wholesale replacement of that base would be a\n      large additional burden\
    \ on funding resources.\n      A consequence of the above is that the user interface\
    \ and the\n      services available will vary depending on the type of equipment\n\
    \      used to access the network.  For example, DOS PCs, Macintosh\n      computers,\
    \ or Unix workstations would be connected directly to\n      Local Area Networks\
    \ (LANs) and would be provided with\n      communications software to support\
    \ a broad set of functions,\n      many of which will have graphical user interfaces\
    \ and will make\n      use of client/server technology.  Apple-II computers, \"\
    dumb\"\n      terminals, or other such devices could be connected to\n      intelligent\
    \ network hubs that would allow access to network\n      server computers or information\
    \ resources, but almost certainly\n      will not support the full range of functionality\
    \ provided by a\n      direct network connection.  In the short term, this is\
    \ a\n      limitation that we must accept;\n   3) Network servers will be located\
    \ where they can be managed and\n      supported, and also provide access paths\
    \ with adequate\n      bandwidth.  A system of hierarchical servers should be\
    \ created\n      in larger school districts, with automatic transfer of common\n\
    \      information from a central system to the secondary systems each\n     \
    \ night, or at appropriate intervals.  Local servers will allow\n      each school\
    \ to provide on-line information particular to its\n      programs and community.\
    \  This model optimizes use of network\n      bandwidth as well;\n   4) School\
    \ interconnect topologies (links) must be both cost\n      effective and manageable.\
    \  Communication between schools,\n      district offices, county offices of education,\
    \ and the State\n      Department of Education must be reliable and of sufficient\n\
    \      capacity to support the primary applications as well as allow\n      development\
    \ of new applications.\n      Capacity is measured both by total data traffic\
    \ volume and by\n      response time when information is requested over the network.\n\
    \      Reliability is measured by the percentage of time that the\n      network\
    \ is able to transport data.  Reliability should be well\n      over 99.7%.  Capacity\
    \ should be such that no more than 10% of\n      the communications bandwidth\
    \ is used during a typical work day.\n      This is intended to leave adequate\
    \ capacity for good response\n      time to short term communication demands.\n\
    \      Many schools already have some form of communications\n      infrastructure\
    \ in place.  In some cases this infrastructure can\n      be adapted to newer\
    \ technologies; in other cases it may have to\n      be replaced over time.  These\
    \ issues are explored further\n      following presentation of the basic model\
    \ that serves as a\n      guideline for future communications system development.\n"
- title: Implementation Model
  contents:
  - "Implementation Model\n   There is no one \"blueprint\" for a network that will\
    \ drop into every\n   school.  Each school will have particular physical constraints,\n\
    \   functional needs, an existing technology base, funding constraints,\n   and\
    \ opportunities for collaboration with vendors and support groups\n   in its area.\
    \  What is presented here is a set of general guidelines\n   that can be followed\
    \ in the planning of a school network\n   implementation.\n   The strategic decision\
    \ to use Internet protocols in developing school\n   networks provides the opportunity\
    \ to avoid the major expense of\n   building new statewide backbone infrastructures\
    \ in the near term.\n   Interconnection of schools, districts, county offices\
    \ of education\n   and the State Department of Education can be accomplished by\n\
    \   acquiring Internet connection service from any of the existing\n   Internet\
    \ service providers in the state.  (\"Connecting to the\n   Internet\", Susan\
    \ Estrada, O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. (ISBN 1-56592-\n   061-9) lists Internet\
    \ service providers in California and the\n   nation.)  It is critical that Internet\
    \ connection service meet\n   criteria for reliability and capacity but connection\
    \ to any Internet\n   service provider will provide communication capability to\
    \ all other\n   Internet subscribers within the state, the nation, and the world.\n\
    \   Internet technology is designed to allow very flexible intersite\n   topologies,\
    \ but a hierarchical topology is the simplest to engineer.\n   Generally this\
    \ will mean hierarchical connection of school facilities\n   to district offices,\
    \ in many cases further aggregated at county\n   offices, and finally a link to\
    \ an Internet service provider.\n   Coordination of circuit services and a single\
    \ point of connection to\n   an Internet service provider serves both to minimize\
    \ overall costs\n   and increase opportunities to make use of newer technologies.\n\
    \   The basic school network implementation model is quite simple: create\n  \
    \ a local area network (LAN) within each school building or cluster of\n   buildings,\
    \ provide at least one network server for that LAN,\n   interconnect that LAN\
    \ with the local school district offices where a\n   similar LAN should be installed\
    \ and where centrally managed\n   information resources should exist, and connect\
    \ the district offices\n   to the nearest Internet service provider, possibly\
    \ through the county\n   office of education.\n   Primary technical support for\
    \ network monitoring and problem\n   resolution, and for managing network resource\
    \ servers should come\n   from the district or county offices initially to avoid\
    \ unnecessary\n   duplication at the local level.  As expertise is developed at\
    \ the\n   local level, more of the responsibility for daily operation and\n  \
    \ problem resolution can be assumed by individual schools.\n   It is impossible\
    \ to cover all conceivable scenarios for\n   implementation of this model in specific\
    \ schools.  However, it is\n   possible to state general principles that should\
    \ be followed in\n   designing school network implementations.  The discussion\
    \ below is\n   organized into sections corresponding to the basic model summarized\n\
    \   in the previous paragraph.  It includes a description of the general\n   principles\
    \ that are important to each level of the implementation.\n"

  contents:
  - "Step 1: School Local Area Network Implementation\n   A \"school\" is used here\
    \ to mean a building or cluster of buildings\n   that are managed as a unit and\
    \ typically are on contiguous, district\n   owned property.  Implementation of\
    \ a LAN in this setting will involve\n   installation of a cabling system to distribute\
    \ the network throughout\n   the structure(s), installation of premise wiring\
    \ to support\n   connections of computers and terminals to the network distribution\n\
    \   system, installation of one or more network server machines in a\n   central\
    \ location (Other protocols, such as AppleTalk or Novells IPX,\n   may be supported\
    \ on a school's local area network (LAN) as needed for\n   local function such\
    \ as printer sharing or local resource servers.),\n   and provision of a network\
    \ router and telecommunications circuit or\n   radio link to connect that school\
    \ to the district offices.\n   The most common LAN technologies in use today are\
    \ ethernet and\n   LocalTalk.  (IEEE 802.5 Token Ring is not recommended for new\n\
    \   installations.  It is more expensive and it is not available for as\n   wide\
    \ a range of computers.)  Both are quite inexpensive and easy to\n   install and\
    \ maintain.  Ethernet is adaptable to most modern computers\n   and is built-in\
    \ to high performance workstations such as Sun,\n   Hewlett-Packard, SGI, or Digital\
    \ Equipment Corporation computers.\n   LocalTalk is built-in to all Macintosh\
    \ computers and is adaptable to\n   DOS PC computers as well.  Ethernet is roughly\
    \ 20 to 40 times faster\n   than LocalTalk.  Therefore ethernet is recommended\
    \ for all computer\n   connections, when possible, and for the school LAN \"backbone\"\

  contents:
  - "1.2  Premise wiring\n   A major component of the implementation will be installation\
    \ of\n   cabling to connect individual computers or clusters of computers to\n\
    \   the LAN.  The recommended topology is a \"star\" where each computer is\n\
    \   wired directly to a \"hub site\" within the building as shown in\n   Figures\
    \ 1 & 2.  A cluster of computers, typically found in a teaching\n   lab or library,\
    \ may be interconnected within the room where they are\n   installed, and the\
    \ cluster connected to the hub site with a single\n   cable as shown in Figures\
    \ 3 & 4.\n   The recommended premise wiring is \"unshielded twisted pair\" (UTP)\n\
    \   wire that meets the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) category\n   5\
    \ standards for high speed data communication service.  (See\n   EIA/TIA-568 \"\
    Commercial Building Telecommunications Wiring\n   Standard.\")  While 2 pair cable\
    \ may be adequate for most purposes,\n   industry standards recommend installation\
    \ of 4 pair cable.  The\n   difference in cost is minimal so we recommend installation\
    \ of the\n   latter.  One end of each cable terminates in a category 5 RJ-45 jack\n\
    \   (A standard RJ45 jack can be used for ethernet or lower speeds if\n   initial\
    \ cost is amajor factor.  Such jacks can be replaced with\n   category 5 versions\
    \ later as needed.) located near the computer.  The\n   other end terminates on\
    \ a standard \"110 distribution block\" (In older\n   sites, M66 distribution\
    \ blocks may already be installed.  These can\n   be used for the time being but\
    \ will not support newer higher speed\n   technologies.) at the hub site utility\
    \ closet.  A labeling scheme\n   must be chosen and strictly adhered to so that\
    \ cables can be\n   identified at both ends later, as needed.\n        [Figure\
    \ 1:  Individual ethernet connection to the network]\n             [Figure 2:\
    \  LocalTalk connection to the network]\n   In most cases, the hub site utility\
    \ closet will be shared with\n   telephone services.  It is essential that a separate\
    \ wall area be set\n   aside within the closet for data service interconnections.\
    \ Typically\n   there will be a \"field\" of interconnect blocks for termination\
    \ of all\n   premise wires, another field for termination of trunk cables (used\n\
    \   for low speed data terminals), and a third field for hub equipment\n   ports.\
    \  Interconnections between premise wiring blocks and hub or\n   trunk blocks\
    \ are installed as needed in order to provide the\n   appropriate service to each\
    \ location where communication service is\n   required.\n       [Figure 3:  A\
    \ cluster of computers connected to the network]\n        [Figure 4:  A Macintosh\
    \ cluster connection to the network]\n   Installation of wiring in a building\
    \ typically is performed by a\n   qualified data wiring contractor.  This is a\
    \ critical aspect of the\n   program and must be planned and installed professionally\
    \ with both\n   current and future requirements in mind.  (See \"Virtual Schoolhouse\
    \ -\n   A Report to the Legislature on Distribution Infrastructures for\n   Advanced\
    \ Technologies in the Construction of New Schools, K through\n   12\" (Department\
    \ of General Services, State of California, February,\n   1993) for example conduit\
    \ and utility closet plans.)  To be prepared\n   for future distribution of video\
    \ signals, school network planners\n   should consider installation of RG-59 coaxial\
    \ cable to those\n   locations where video may be required at the same time that\
    \ the UTP\n   premise wiring is being installed.  The coaxial cable would terminate\n\
    \   on a wall plate mounted \"F\" connector in the classroom, and would be\n \
    \  left unterminated in the utility closet.  Future technologies may\n   support\
    \ video signals over other media so the installation of RG-59\n   cable should\
    \ be limited to near term potential requirements.\n   It will be cost effective\
    \ to install premise wiring to as many\n   locations as might ever serve a computer.\
    \  This will include\n   administrative offices as well as classrooms, laboratories\
    \ as well as\n   libraries.  In high density locations such as offices, consideration\n\
    \   should be given to installation of two UTP cables to each outlet\n   location\
    \ in order to provide the potential for several computers or\n   workstations.\
    \  Terminating both cables on the same wall plate will\n   add little to the overall\
    \ wiring project costs and will add greatly\n   to the flexibility of the system.\
    \  Premise wiring that is not to be\n   used initially will not be connected to\
    \ any electronics in the hub\n   site.\n   Hub sites should be utility closets\
    \ or other protected, non-occupied\n   areas.  Hub sites can be created by construction\
    \ of small closets or\n   cabinets in low use areas.  A hub site must be located\
    \ within 300\n   feet of any connection.  Typically, multiple hub sites are required\n\
    \   in large or multi-story buildings.\n"
- title: 1.3  Network Distribution System
  contents:
  - "1.3  Network Distribution System\n   All hub sites within a school must be interconnected\
    \ to complete the\n   school LAN.  The design of this network distribution system\
    \ will\n   depend greatly on the physical layout of the school buildings.  We\n\
    \   assume that ethernet technology will be used since higher speed\n   technology\
    \ is still quite expensive.\n                 [Figure 5:  A complete small school\
    \ LAN]\n   If all hub sites are within 300 cable feet of a central location,\n\
    \   then 10-base-T wiring can be used from a central hub to connect each\n   hub\
    \ site, as shown in Figure 5.  If longer distances are required,\n   either thin-net\
    \ or standard thick ethernet can be used.  Fiber optic\n   cable can be used if\
    \ distance requires it and funding permits.  (If\n   fiber optic cable is installed,\
    \ consideration should be given to\n   including both multimode fiber for current\
    \ and future data\n   requirements and single mode fiber for video and future\
    \ very high\n   speed data systems.) Specific design of the \"backbone\" network\n\
    \   distribution system will depend on the layout of the buildings to be\n   served.\n\
    \   With proper design as many as 250 computers can be connected to a\n   single\
    \ ethernet segment.  Most often the practical maximum number\n   will be much\
    \ lower than this due to the amount of data sent onto the\n   network by each\
    \ computer.  For planning purposes, one can assume\n   100-125 computers per segment.\
    \  Beyond that size the network must be\n   subdivided using \"subnetworks\".\
    \  Design of a such a system is not\n   difficult, but is beyond the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   The network distribution system cabling should include unshielded\n\
    \   multi-pair trunk cabling as well as ethernet trunk cabling.  The\n   multi-pair\
    \ trunk cable will be needed to connect terminals or older\n   computers emulating\
    \ terminals to a central \"network access server\"\n   (NAS).  A typical NAS can\
    \ serve from 8 to 128 such connections.  It\n   is most cost effective to provide\
    \ one per LAN, if needed.  The NAS\n   connects directly to the ethernet LAN.\n"
- title: 1.4  Local Network Server
  contents:
  - "1.4  Local Network Server\n   It is highly recommended that each school install\
    \ a \"network server\"\n   to support local storage of commonly used information,\
    \ software,\n   electronic mail, and other functions that may require high speed\n\
    \   communication to the users computer.  Since the connection to the\n   outside\
    \ network will be much slower than the school LAN, it will be\n   most efficient\
    \ to access information locally.  In particular,\n   software that is to be shared\
    \ among the schools computers must be\n   stored locally since it would be very\
    \ tedious to transfer it across\n   the slower external link.  The network server\
    \ will be connected\n   directly to the ethernet network.\n   The location of\
    \ the server should be chosen carefully to ensure its\n   protection from abuse\
    \ and environmental damage.  Traditionally the\n   school library is the focus\
    \ of information gathering and storage\n   activities and many school libraries\
    \ have clusters of computers or\n   terminals already installed.  The library\
    \ would be a very logical\n   place to locate the network server computer.  The\
    \ Network Router (see\n   below) might also be located there if a suitable utility\
    \ space is not\n   available.\n   The network server will be a small but powerful\
    \ computer with a large\n   amount of disk storage capacity, typically 1-4 gigabytes.\
    \  It will\n   run software capable of supporting access by a large number of\
    \ users\n   simultaneously.  It could also support dial-in access from teachers\n\
    \   or students homes using standard inexpensive modems.  (Access control\n  \
    \ with user authentication is essential if dial-in service is to be\n   provided.)\
    \  If more than a few modems are to be installed, a NAS\n   might prove more cost\
    \ effective.  If dial-in access is to be provided\n   to more than a few school\
    \ sites within a district, a single central\n   modem pool maintainted at the\
    \ district offices will be the most cost\n   effective.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.5  External Connection\n   A single communication circuit will connect the\
    \ school LAN to the\n   local school district offices.  In the school, there will\
    \ be a\n   Network Router attached between the LAN and this circuit.  On the LAN\n\
    \   side, the connection will be a typical ethernet cable.  On the\n   external\
    \ side, the connection will depend on the type of\n   communication circuit used,\
    \ as discussed in step 2 below.\n"
- title: 'Step 2: Interconnection of Schools with District Offices'
  contents:
  - "Step 2: Interconnection of Schools with District Offices\n   All schools within\
    \ a district should be connected individually to the\n   network router at the\
    \ school district offices.  This \"star topology\"\n   will be much easier to\
    \ manage and the capacity of each schools\n   connection can be increased appropriately\
    \ as needs change.\n   Several standard communication circuit services may be\
    \ used to effect\n   this connection.  The least expensive for situations where\
    \ only\n   limited use is needed will be dial-up using high speed modems.\n  \
    \ However, this type of connection is not recommended for serious usage\n   due\
    \ to its very limited capacity.  Also, since most schools receive\n   telephone\
    \ service under business tariffs, usage will be measured and\n   the cost will\
    \ be dependent on how long the connection is maintained.\n   This will be true\
    \ in general for other \"switched services\" as well\n   such as \"switched-56\"\
    \ and ISDN.  Dedicated (permanently installed)\n   communications circuits are\
    \ strongly recommended since they will\n   allow unattended access to and from\
    \ the school network at all hours.\n   This will be particularly important if\
    \ information files are to be\n   down-loaded during the night to local network\
    \ servers or teachers and\n   students are to access the schools information resources\
    \ from home.\n   Table 2 shows the most common options for dedicated circuit services.\n\
    \   Costs are indicated in relative terms since they vary greatly by\n   location\
    \ and as tariffs are modified.  The exact costs must be\n   determined by contacting\
    \ local communications service providers.\n   Total cost must take into account\
    \ the equipment needed at each\n   location as well.\n"

    \          Table 2: External Connection Communications Options\n   Frame Relay\
    \ communication services are becoming available in many\n   areas.  Frame Relay\
    \ is a shared, packet based data transport service.\n   A school site would contract\
    \ for Frame Relay service as part of a\n   larger service group that includes\
    \ the school district office and may\n   include the Internet service provider.\
    \  All members of that group\n   would share the communications capacity.  The\
    \ advantage of this\n   service is that only one end of the circuit needs to be\
    \ ordered (each\n   member orders a connection to the common service) and the\
    \ capacity\n   offered to each member can be upgraded independently.  Also, in\
    \ many\n   areas the cost of Frame Relay service is not dependent on distance\
    \ to\n   the service provider which will make service to rural schools much\n\
    \   less expensive than equivalent services.  Overall system costs will\n   be\
    \ minimized since the central router at the district office will\n   need fewer\
    \ connections.\n   If Frame Relay is chosen, the overall service group must be\
    \ carefully\n   engineered.  For example, since all schools would share the\n\
    \   connection to the district office (and possibly to the Internet\n   service\
    \ provider), that must be a high capacity connection.  For the\n   initial design,\
    \ the aggregate capacity of all school links should not\n   exceed the capacity\
    \ into the district office (or the Internet service\n   provider) by more than\
    \ a factor of 3 or there may be noticeable\n   congestion and variability in response\
    \ times across the system.\n   There are many other factors that must be considered\
    \ as well, such as\n   the virtual connection topology and how best to connect\
    \ to an\n   Internet service provider.  Therefore, it is recommended that an\n\
    \   experienced network engineer be utilized to develop an operational\n   plan\
    \ for Frame Relay if it is chosen as the school interconnection\n   service.\n\
    \   Future options for interconnecting schools and district offices will\n   include:\n\
    \   o       Community Access Television (CATV) cable systems offering\n      \
    \     either shared or dedicated bi-directional data communication\n         \
    \  services,\n   o       metropolitan area fiber optic communications service\n\
    \           providers,\n   o       Switched Multi-megabit Digital Service (SMDS)\
    \ providing data\n           transport service at speeds up to 34 megabits per\
    \ second.\n   o       Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connection services\n \
    \          supporting voice, data, and video communications at speeds\n      \
    \     into the gigabit per second range.\n   (Many more options will become available\
    \ as new technologies come to\n   market.)\n   The costs for the last three options\
    \ are unknown at this time, but\n   may be generally higher than those indicated\
    \ in Table 2.  The cost\n   for the CATV option may be negotiable as part of the\
    \ local CATV\n   contract with the community.\n   As demands for network speed\
    \ develop due to heavy use of multimedia\n   or other bandwidth intensive application,\
    \ higher speed communications\n   circuits can replace the initial circuits with\
    \ minimal change in the\n   equipment or LAN.  This gives great flexibility in\
    \ tailoring service\n   to funding levels and application needs.\n"

    \ network level identity of each computer, workstation, server,\n   and active\
    \ network component.  This function is described more fully\n   below under Network\
    \ Management and Operational Monitoring.\n   The district offices should be wired\
    \ in a manner similar to a typical\n   school, as shown above.  This will allow\

    \ of the entire school district to the Internet will take\n   place through the\
    \ district office interconnect site, as shown in\n   Figure 6.  This hierarchical\
    \ model can be extended another level to\n   interconnection of the school district\
    \ offices through the county\n   office of education facilities.  Many administrative\
    \ information\n   resources could be located at the county level, and there might\
    \ be\n   cost savings if the entire county connects to an Internet service\n \
    \  provider through a single point.  The bandwidth required for this\n   single\
    \ connection, however, will be much greater than that required\n   for each school\
    \ district since traffic will be aggregated.\n   This hierarchical topology also\
    \ provides a logical model for network\n   support and information resource management.\
    \  The school district or\n   county offices can provide continuous monitoring\
    \ of the network and\n   provide high level technical expertise for problem resolution,\n\
    \   relieving the individual schools of this burden.  Interactions with\n   communications\
    \ circuit providers and Internet service providers will\n   be more effective\
    \ if handled through a central \"trouble desk\".\n   Similarly, it is highly desirable\
    \ that network users have a single,\n   well known point of contact in case of\
    \ problems or questions.\n   Internet service should be acquired from the most\
    \ cost effective,\n   reliable Internet service provider.  Circuit services can\
    \ be similar\n   to those shown in Table 2 above.  The higher speed services should\
    \ be\n   considered if traffic demands increase and funding permits.  Circuit\n\
    \   costs usually will be lowest when connecting to the provider with the\n  \
    \ nearest \"point of presence\" (POP), but newer technologies such as\n   Frame\
    \ Relay and SMDS (At this time, SMDS services are not widely\n   available.) make\
    \ circuit costs less dependent on distance.  The\n   Internet connection will\

- title: Integration of Existing School Networks
  contents:
  - "Integration of Existing School Networks\n   Many schools have developed LAN systems\
    \ in support of particular\n   classroom activities or administrative functions.\
    \  In some cases the\n   technologies used are not those recommended for new installations.\
    \ If\n   these older LAN systems are capable of transporting Internet\n   protocols\
    \ they may be integrated into a new LAN system and replaced\n   later as funding\
    \ permits.\n   For example, IEEE 802.5 Token Ring is often used to interconnect\
    \ DOS\n   PC-type computers and IBM minicomputer servers.  Token Ring networks\n\
    \   can transport Internet protocols and software is available for DOS\n   computers\
    \ to support basic Internet functions.  Many Internet routers\n   support optional\
    \ Token Ring adapters.  This is the recommended way\n   that existing Token Ring\
    \ LANs can be integrated into a wider school\n   LAN system in order to extend\
    \ Internet information resources to those\n   PC users.\n   Another example is\
    \ a Novell Network system using ethernet as a LAN.\n   The ethernet LAN, if implemented\
    \ well, is perfectly capable of\n   transporting Internet protocols as well as\
    \ Novell protocols,\n   simultaneously.  Each PC or Macintosh can be given software\
    \ that will\n   allow both Novell and Internet services to be used as needed.\
    \ This\n   coexistence is important so that, for example, a person using a PC\n\
    \   that depends on the Novell server for disk file space can transfer a\n   large\
    \ file from a remote Internet server to the PCs pseudo-disk.  It\n   also permits\
    \ each user to run client software such as Eudora\n   (electronic mail), Gopher\
    \ (information services), and Mosaic (World\n   Wide Web information services)\
    \ which require direct Internet access.\n   To integrate the Novell ethernet LAN\
    \ into the wider school LAN system\n   a simple ethernet repeater can be used\
    \ in a manner similar to Figure\n   3 above.\n   An alternative to supporting\
    \ both protocols that is sometimes\n   suggested in cases such as the one cited\
    \ above in which a network\n   server already exists is to use the server as a\
    \ \"network application\n   gateway\".  This approach is strongly discouraged.\
    \  It is essential\n   that each computer and workstation support Internet protocol\
    \ data\n   communication directly so that modern client/server applications can\n\
    \   be supported where the server or servers may be located anywhere on\n   the\
    \ Internet.  The \"gateway\" approach severely restricts the\n   workstations\
    \ potential ability to access multimedia and other\n   important information resources.\n\
    \   Some technologies, such as \"arcnet,\" may not be capable of supporting\n\
    \   Internet protocols but may offer \"terminal emulation\" shared access\n  \
    \ to something like a \"modem pool\".  The modem adapter might be rewired\n  \
    \ to connect to ports on a network access server instead.  This would\n   provide\
    \ simple access to information resources for the arcnet users.\n   In any case,\
    \ older LAN technologies should not be expanded and should\n   be phased out as\
    \ funding permits.  It is critical that there be a\n   relatively homogeneous\
    \ installed base of technology in order that new\n   applications of information\
    \ resources can be provided to the entire\n   school community.\n"

  - "Network Management and Operational Monitoring\n   All networks require some level\
    \ of network management in order to\n   ensure reliable service.  Monitoring of\
    \ the health of the network can\n   help identify problems before they become\
    \ detrimental to network\n   users.  It also can help predict trends in traffic\
    \ patterns and\n   volume.\n   Internet technology network management consists\
    \ primarily of\n   determining the proper routing parameters for optimal and reliable\n\
    \   network operation, assignment of network Internet Protocol (IP)\n   addresses\
    \ and maintenance of a network-accessible database of node\n   names corresponding\
    \ to each address (See RFC 1480 for a discussion of\n   Internet naming conventions\

    \  These functions typically are\n   performed by the staff of a Network Operations\
    \ Center (NOC).\n"
- title: Domain Name System
  contents:
  - "Domain Name System\n   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is the mechanism\
    \ for\n   documenting and distributing information about the name and address\n\
    \   of each computer attached to the network (network nodes).  The DNS\n   service\
    \ is provided by software that runs on the main network server.\n   It uses a\
    \ database that is created and maintained by the NOC staff.\n   An Internet address\
    \ is the numerical identifier for a node and it\n   must be unique among all nodes\
    \ associated with the network.\n   Furthermore, if the network is to be part of\
    \ the global Internet, all\n   addresses must be legitimate within the worldwide\
    \ Internet system.\n   Associated with each numerical address can be one or more\
    \ \"node\n   names\".  Although computers have no difficulty using numerical\n\
    \   addresses, it is often easier for computer users to remember and use\n   the\
    \ node names rather than the numerical addresses.  In particular,\n   electronic\
    \ mail addresses use node names.  DNS node names are\n   hierarchical and by appropriately\
    \ using this hierarchy \"subdomains\"\n   can be assigned to each school site\
    \ or district office.  In this way,\n   naming can be structured to be flexible\
    \ as well as meaningful in the\n   context of the whole organization.\n   A plan\
    \ for the assignment of IP network addresses and node names\n   should be developed\
    \ early in the planning for the network\n   installation.  Initially, the database\
    \ serving the DNS should reside\n   on the \"district server\" so that there is\
    \ one site at which all\n   assignments are officially registered.  As the network\
    \ grows and\n   expertise is developed, secondary DNS service can be run on the\n\
    \   servers at larger school sites.\n   The main DNS server for the district should\
    \ be located as close to\n   the Internet connection (topologically) as possible.\
    \  This proximity\n   is to help ensure that network problems within the district\
    \ network\n   will have minimal impact on access to the server.  This design is\n\
    \   illustrated in Figure 1 where the district server is on an ethernet\n   connected\
    \ directly to the main distribution router.\n   Associated with the assignment\
    \ of node names and addresses should be\n   a database of specific information\
    \ about the computers connected to\n   the network.  When trying to resolve problems\
    \ or answer user\n   questions, it is very important to know where the computers\
    \ and other\n   nodes are located, what type of computer and software are in use,\
    \ and\n   what type of network connection is installed.  With proper software\n\
    \   this database can be used to extract the DNS database discussed\n   above.\n"

  - "Network Monitoring\n   Internet network monitoring serves three primary purposes:\n\

    \ Protocol (SNMP) support is built-in to most\n      active components today.\

    \ network and\n      patterns of traffic in order to identify needed enhancements\
    \ or\n      re-engineering.  Using the same SNMP capabilities mentioned\n    \
    \  above, data on packet forwarding and total traffic volume can\n      be collected\
    \ and used to generate periodic reports on network\n      utilization;\n   3)\
    \ More rapid problem resolution.  When problems do occur, SNMP\n      tools can\
    \ help to pinpoint the source of the problem(s).  Such\n      problems include\
    \ transient routing anomalies, DNS query\n      failures, or even attempts at\
    \ breaking into network accessible\n      host computers.\n      Since network\
    \ management and monitoring is a technically\n      demanding task and requires\
    \ special equipment and software, it\n      should be a centralized function in\
    \ the initial design of school\n      network systems, as discussed above.\n"

  - "Summary\n   The model for school network implementation described above is based\n\
    \   on broad experience with this technology in higher education and\n   administrative\
    \ environments.  Many schools have already installed\n   networks very similar\
    \ to this model.  We believe that it is a\n   practical first step towards bringing\
    \ a powerful resource to bear for\n   enriching all of the nations school programs.\n\
    \   None of the suggestions above preclude or postpone in any way future\n   development\
    \ of an integrated voice, data, and video network for the\n   nations schools.\
    \  Use of existing Internet carriers does not in any\n   way preclude future development\
    \ of a separate \"backbone\" for the K-12\n   community if such a \"backbone\"\
    \ is determined to be cost effective or\n   required for enhanced functionality.\
    \  Rather, the infrastructure\n   recommended above can be the foundation at the\
    \ local level in\n   preparation for future high capacity networks.\n   The installation\
    \ of a campuswide network or Internet connectivity\n   will also require a commitment\
    \ to ongoing network support and its\n   related resource requirements.  There\
    \ are two major areas of network\n   support, network operations and user services.\
    \  These support\n   functions are usually performed through the establishment\
    \ of a\n   Network Operations Center (NOC) and Network Information Center (NIC),\n\
    \   however both functions can be performed by the same individual or\n   groups\
    \ of individuals.\n"

    \ provide\n   configurations for computers attached to an organization-wide\n\
    \   network.  Real-time monitoring of the network can be performed using\n   the\
    \ Simple Network Management Protocol and many vendors produce\n   monitoring systems\
    \ that graphically display network performance, log\n   events and usage, and\
    \ produce trouble tickets.  The use of this type\n   of network monitoring allows\
    \ NOC staff to quickly detect problems and\n   greatly reduces the personnel required\
    \ to perform this function.\n   Routine monitoring of the network can help to\
    \ anticipate problems\n   before they develop and lead to reconfigurations and\
    \ upgrades as\n   indicated.  If problems do arise, NOC personnel may go on-site\
    \ to\n   troubleshoot a problem and repair it.  If the problem is not local,\n\
    \   NOC personnel will work with school district, County or regional\n   network\
    \ technical staff to resolve the problem.\n   NOC personnel also assign addresses\
    \ to network computers and devices\n   and maintain the Domain Nameservice (DNS)\
    \ for their organization.\n   Domain Nameservice is a machine registry service\

    \ Operation Center serve\n   an entire organization or region.  In order to ensure\
    \ timely service\n   all the way out to the most remote LAN, it is recommended\
    \ that an\n   organization assign local area network administration duties to\
    \ on-\n   site personnel to interact with NOC staff and assist with the\n   maintenance\

    \ staff, teachers, librarians or school based\n   technical staff can each take\
    \ responsibility for a LAN or group of\n   LANs.  If a problem arises, it can\
    \ be reported to the LAN\n   administrator.  The LAN administrator can determine\
    \ if the problem is\n   local or remote and if NOC staff need to be notified.\
    \  If so, the LAN\n   administrator acts as the single point of contact for the\
    \ NOC to\n   provide a good communications channel for information and ensure\n\
    \   efficient coordination of problem resolution.  This method of\n   delegating\
