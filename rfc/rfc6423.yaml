- title: 3.  GAL Usage for MPLS-TP PW
  contents:
  - "3.  GAL Usage for MPLS-TP PW\n   According to the MPLS-TP requirements document\
    \ [RFC5654], it is\n   necessary that MPLS-TP mechanisms and capabilities be able\
    \ to\n   interoperate with the existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF PWE3\n  \
    \ [RFC3985] architectures as appropriate.  [RFC5586] differentiates\n   between\
    \ the usage of the GAL with PWs in MPLS and MPLS-TP\n   environments in Section\
    \ 4.2 as follows:\n      In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh\
    \ on LSPs,\n      Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MUST NOT\
    \ be\n      used with PWs.\n   This indicates that the GAL can be used for MPLS-TP\
    \ LSPs and\n   Sections, but not for PWs in an MPLS-TP network.\n   However, there\
    \ is no restriction imposed on the usage of the GAL in\n   MPLS PWs, which is\
    \ described immediately afterwards in the same\n   section (Section 4.2) of [RFC5586]:\n\
    \      However, in other MPLS environments, this document places no\n      restrictions\
    \ on where the GAL may appear within the label stack or\n      its use with PWs.\n\
    \   The inconsistency between the usage of the GAL with MPLS PWs and\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ PWs may cause unnecessary implementation differences and is\n   in disagreement\
    \ with the MPLS-TP requirements.\n   Therefore, this document specifies that the\
    \ GAL can be used with\n   packets on a G-ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of\
    \ LSPs, Sections,\n   and PWs in both MPLS and MPLS-TP environments without discrimination.\n\
    \   [RFC5586] is updated by removing the restrictions on using GAL for PW\n  \
    \ as follows:\n   -  Section 1 (Introduction) in [RFC5586], the original text:\n\
    \         The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for\n   \
    \      LSPs and MPLS Sections.\n      is replaced by:\n         The GAL mechanism\
    \ is defined to work together with the ACH for\n         LSPs and MPLS Sections,\
    \ and for PWs.\n   -  Section 4.2.  (GAL Applicability and Usage) in [RFC5586],\
    \ the\n      original text:\n         In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets\
    \ on a G-ACh on\n         LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections,\
    \ and\n         MUST NOT be used with PWs.  It MUST always be at the bottom of\n\
    \         the label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1).  However, in other MPLS\n  \
    \       environments, this document places no restrictions on where the\n    \
    \     GAL may appear within the label stack or its use with PWs.\n      is replaced\
    \ by:\n         In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on\n\
    \         LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MAY\n  \
    \       be used with PWs.  The presence of a GAL indicates that an ACH\n     \
    \    immediately follows the MPLS label stack.\n"
