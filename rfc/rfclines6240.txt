Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) circuits over a Packet Switch Network (PSN).
This document describes a model for managing encapsulated SONET/SDH Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).
This document is closely related to [RFC4842], which describes the technology to encapsulate TDM signals and provides the Circuit Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).
The model for Circuit Emulation over Packet (CEP) management is a MIB module.
The PW CEP STD MIB module described in this document works closely with the MIB modules described in [RFC5601] and the textual conventions defined in [RFC5542].
In the spirit of [RFC2863], a CEP connection will be a pseudowire (PW) and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.
CEP is currently specified to carry "structured" SONET/SDH paths, meaning that each SONET/SDH path or Virtual Tributary (VT) within the section/line/path can be processed separately.
The SONET/SDH section/line/path interface stack is modeled within [RFC3592].
This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms described in [RFC3985].
Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of [RFC3985] apply and will not be redescribed here.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Terminology CEP terminology comes from [RFC4842], which describes a mechanism for transporting SONET/SDH Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals over a packet oriented network.
The mechanism for structured emulation (as outlined in [RFC4842]) terminates the SONET/SDH section and line overhead and then breaks the SONET/SDH path's Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) into fragments for transmission over a PSN.
Mechanisms for terminating the SONET/SDH path overhead and extracting SONET VTs are also described in [RFC4842].
Mechanisms for fractional SONET/SDH SPE emulation are described in [RFC4842].
A CEP header that contains a sequence number and pointer adjustment information is appended at the beginning of each fragment to provide information regarding where the SPE begins within the packet stream (see [RFC4842]).
"Outbound" references the traffic direction in which a SONET/SDH path's payload (SPE) is received, adapted to packet, assigned a PW label, and sent into the PSN.
Conversely, "inbound" is the direction in which packets are received from the PSN and packet payloads are reassembled back into an SPE and inserted as a SONET/SDH path into the SONET/SDH section and line.
Since a SONET/SDH path is bidirectional and symmetrical, CEP uses the same SONET/SDH timeslot, SONET/SDH width, and packet size.
Inbound and outbound PW labels may differ.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The PW CEP STD MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:
The MIB module is designed to work with the PW STD MIB [RFC5601] module.
The MIB module is independent of the PSN type.
The MIB module supports all the signal types as defined in [RFC4842]: SPE, fractional SPE, VT, both SONET and SDH mapping.
The MIB module also supports all the optional features as defined in [RFC4842].
The MIB module reports all the statistics as defined by [RFC4842].
MIB Module Description and Usage
For clarity of the description below, in most cases, we refer to the SONET path signal configuration only, but the same examples are applicable for SDH signals and VT level processing as well, as described in [RFC3985].
PW CEP STD MIB Summary
The CEP PW Table (pwCepTable) contains the SONET/SDH path/VT ifIndex, SONET/SDH path timeslot, the pwCepCfgTable index, config error indications, and various status indications.
The CEP PW Configuration Parameter Table (pwCepCfgTable) has objects for CEP PW configuration.
In situations where sets of config objects are common amongst more than one CEP PW, a single entry here may be referenced by many pwCepTable entries.
The CEP PW Performance Current Interval Table (pwCepPerfCurrentTable) contains CEP stats for the current 15 minute period.
The CEP Performance 15 Minute Interval Table (pwCepPerfIntervalTable) is similar to the pwCepPerfCurrentTable.
It contains historical intervals (usually 96 15 minute entries to cover a 24 hour period).
Note: the performance interval statistics are supported by CEP due to the very function of CEP,
The CEP Performance 1 Day Table (pwCepPerf1DayIntervalTable) contains statistics accumulated during the current day and contains previous days' historical statistics.
The CEP Fractional Table (pwCepFracTable) adds configuration and monitoring parameters for fractional SPE PWs.

PW STD MIB Module Usage
The MIB module structure for defining a PW service is composed of three layers of MIB modules functioning together.
This general model is defined in the Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3) architecture [RFC3985].
The layering model is intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN layer that carries the emulated service.
This is done at the same time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported services to any supported PSNs.
The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service  specific modules such as the one defined in this document.
These modules define service specific management objects that interface or collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the service.
The service specific module "glues" the standard modules to the PWE3 MIB modules.
The PW CEP STD MIB module defined in this memo serves as one of the PW type specific MIB modules.
The next layer of the PWE3 MIB framework is the PW STD MIB module [RFC5601].
This module is used to configure general parameters of PWs that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.
This layer is connected to the service specific layer above and the PSN layer below.
The PSN layer provides PSN specific modules for each type of PSN.
These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
These modules are defined in other documents.
This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the underlying PSN specific MIB modules.
PW CEP STD MIB Module Usage Configuring a CEP PW involves the following steps.
First, create an entry in the pwTable:  Follow steps as defined in [RFC5601].
the PSN tunnel in the respective PSN specific PWE3 PSN glue MIB modules and the respective PSN specific MIB modules.
Configure the SONET path parameters:
Set the SONET path width in the sonetPathCurrentTable [RFC3592].
Set the SONET path index and the SONET path starting timeslot in the pwCepTable.
The agent creates an entry in the pwCepTable based on the entry created in the pwTable.
(3)  Configure the CEP PW:
If necessary, create an entry in the pwCepCfgTable (a suitable entry may already exist).
Set the index of this pwCepCfgTable entry in the pwCepTable.
(4)  Observe the CEP PW:
Once a CEP PW is operational, the pwCepPerfCurrentTable, pwCepPerfIntervalTable, and pwCepPerf1DayIntervalTable can be used to monitor the various counts, indicators, and conditions of the PW.
Example of PW CEP STD MIB Usage
In this section, we provide an example of using the MIB objects described in Section 7 to set up a CEP PW.
While this example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.
It is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself.
See [RFC5601] for an example of setting up PSN tunnels.
First, configure the SONET path width, starting timeslot, and associated CEP PW.
In this case, an Synchronous Transport Signal 3c (STS 3c) starts at SONET timeslot 1 (and is distributed normally within the SONET frame).
In the following example, the ifIndex for the sonetPathCurrentEntry is 23, while the pwCepCfgTable index is 9.

At least one packet arrived outside the range of the jitter buffer.
This may be because the jitter buffer is full or the sequence number addresses a buffer outside the current jitter buffer range or an already occupied buffer within range.

"This object contains an appropriate value to be used for pwCepCfgIndex when creating entries in the pwCepCfgTable.
The value 0 indicates that no unassigned entries are available.
To obtain the value of pwCepCfgIndex for a new entry in the pwCepCfgTable, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of pwCepCfgIndex.
After each retrieval operation, the agent should modify the value to reflect the next unassigned index.
After a manager retrieves a value, the agent will determine through its local policy when this index value will be made available for reuse."
This table contains a set of parameters that may be referenced by one or more CEP PWs by pwCepTable."
"These parameters define the characteristics of a CEP PW.
They are grouped here to ease Network Management System (NMS) burden.
Once an entry is created here, it may be reused by many PWs.
By default, all the read create objects MUST NOT be changed after row activation unless specifically indicated in the individual object description.
If the operator wishes to change value of a read create object, the pwCepCfgRowStatus MUST be set to notInService(2).
The agent MUST NOT allow the change of the pwCepCfgRowStatus from the active(1) state for pwCepCfgEntry, which is in use by at least one active PW.
Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a reboot, the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those entries.
If the set of entries of a specific row are found to be inconsistent after reboot, the affected PWs' pwOperStatus MUST be declared as notPresent(5).
"The number of SONET bytes of the Path or VT carried as payload within one packet.
For example, for STS 1/VC 3 SPE circuits, a value of 783 bytes indicates that each packet carries the payload equivalent to one frame.
VT1.5/VC11 circuits, a payload length of 104 bytes indicates that each packet carries payload equivalent to one VT1.5 super frame.
The actual payload size may be different due to bandwidth reduction modes, e.g., Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) mode or dynamically assigned fractional SPE.
This length applies to inbound and outbound packets carrying user payload.
Although there is no control over inbound packets, those of illegal length are discarded and accounted for (see pwCepPerf...Malformed.)
The default values are determined by the pwCepType: 783 for pwCepType equal to spe(2) or fracSpe(3).
For vt(3) modes, the applicable super frame payload size is the default value."

Minimum packet length is necessary in some systems or networks.
Setting zero here indicates that there is no minimum packet restriction.
"This object defines if reordering is applied for incoming packets.
If set 'true', as inbound packets are queued in the jitter buffer, out of order packets are reordered.
The maximum sequence number differential (i.e., the range in which resequencing can occur) is dependant on the depth of the jitter buffer.
If the local agent supports packet reordering, the default value SHOULD be set to 'true'; otherwise, this value SHOULD be set to 'false'."
"This object defines when DBA is applied for packets sent toward the PSN.
Setting 'ais' MUST cause CEP packet payload suppression when AIS is detected on the associated SONET path.
Similarly, 'unequipped' MUST cause payload suppression when an unequipped condition is detected on the SONET/SDH PATH/VT.
During DBA condition, CEP packets will continue to be sent, but with indicators set in the CEP header instructing the remote to play all ones (for AIS) or all zeros (for unequipped) onto its SONET/SDH path.
Some implementations may not support this feature.
In these cases, this object should be read only.

When first entering the UAS state, the number of SesToUas is added to this object; then, as each additional UAS occurs, this object increments by one.
Similar to [RFC3592], if the agent chooses to update the various performance statistics in real time, it must be prepared to retroactively reduce the ES and SES counts (by the value of pwCepCfgSesToUas) and increase the UAS count (by that same value) when it determines that UAS state has been entered."

current DESCRIPTION "Collection of fractional VC4 objects.
These objects are optional and should be supported only if fractional VC4 is supported within the network element."
It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring CEP PWs.
This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.
There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The pwCepTable, pwCepCfgTable, and pwCepFracTable contain objects to CEP PW parameters on a Provider Edge (PE) device.
Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible.
Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.
Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The pwCepTable, pwCepPerfCurrentTable, pwCepPerfIntervalTable, and pwCepPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively show the CEP pseudowire connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.
If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
