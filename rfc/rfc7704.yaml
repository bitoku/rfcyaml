  - "Abstract\n   The process of producing today's Internet technologies through a\n\
    \   culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved\n   strikingly\
    \ efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among\n   standards organizations.\
    \  During the early years of the IETF and its\n   antecedent, participation was\
    \ almost entirely composed of a small\n   group of well-funded, American, white,\
    \ male technicians,\n   demonstrating a distinctive and challenging group dynamic,\
    \ both in\n   management and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF,\n\
    \   interaction style can often contain singularly aggressive behavior,\n   often\
    \ including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups with\n   greater diversity\
    \ make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful\n   diversity requires more than\
    \ generic good will and statements of\n   principle.  Many different behaviors\
    \ can serve to reduce participant\n   diversity or participation diversity.  This\
    \ document discusses IETF\n   participation in terms of the nature of diversity\
    \ and practical\n   issues that can increase or decrease it.  The document represents\
    \ the\n   authors' assessments and recommendations, following general\n   discussions\
    \ of the issues in the IETF.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document discusses IETF participation, in terms of\
    \ the nature of\n   diversity and practical issues that can increase or decrease\
    \ it.  The\n   topic has received recent discussion in the IETF, and the document\n\
    \   represents the authors' assessments and recommendations about it, in\n   the\
    \ belief that it is constructive for the IETF and that it is\n   consonant with\
    \ at least some of the IETF community's participants.\n   The Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force [IETF] grew out of a research\n   effort that was started in the\
    \ late 1960s, with central funding by\n   the US Department of Defense Advanced\
    \ Research Projects Agency (ARPA,\n   later DARPA) employing a collection of research\
    \ sites around the\n   United States, and including some participation by groups\
    \ of the US\n   military.  The community was originally restricted to participation\n\
    \   by members of the funded research groups.  In the 1980s,\n   participation\
    \ expanded to include projects funded by other agencies,\n   most notably the\
    \ US National Science Foundation for its NSFNet\n   effort.  At around the time\
    \ the IETF was created in its current form,\n   in the late 1980s, participation\
    \ in the group became fully open,\n   permitting attendance by anyone, independent\
    \ of funding, affiliation,\n   country of origin, or the like.\n   Beyond the\
    \ obvious effects of the resulting technology that we now\n   enjoy, the process\
    \ of producing today's Internet technologies through\n   a culture of open participation\
    \ and diverse collaboration has proved\n   strikingly efficient and effective,\
    \ and it is distinctive among\n   standards organizations.  This culture has been\
    \ sustained across many\n   changes in participant origins, organizational structures,\
    \ economic\n   cycles, and formal processes.  However, maintenance of the IETF's\n\
    \   effectiveness requires constant vigilance.  As new participants join\n   the\
    \ IETF mix, it is increasingly easy for the IETF's operation to\n   gradually\
    \ invoke models from other environments, which are more\n   established and more\
    \ familiar, but often are less effective.\n   Historically, participation in the\
    \ IETF and its antecedent was almost\n   entirely composed of a small group of\
    \ well-funded, American, white,\n   male technicians.  No matter the intentions\
    \ of the participants, such\n   a narrow demographic demonstrated a distinctive\
    \ group dynamic, both\n   in management and in personal interactions, that persists\
    \ into the\n   current IETF.  Aggressive and even hostile discussion behavior\
    \ is\n   quite common.  In terms of management, the IETF can be significantly\n\
    \   in-bred, favoring selection of those who are already well-known.  Of\n   course,\
    \ the pool of candidates from which selections are made suffer\n   classic limitations\
    \ of diversity found in many engineering\n   environments.  Still, there is evidence\
    \ and perception of selection\n   bias, beyond this.\n   In the case of the IETF,\
    \ the style of interaction can often\n   demonstrate singularly aggressive behavior,\
    \ including singularly\n   hostile tone and content.  In most professional venues,\
    \ such behavior\n   is deemed highly unprofessional, or worse.  Within the IETF,\
    \ such\n   behavior has had long-standing tolerance.  Criticizing someone's\n\
    \   hostility is dismissed by saying that's just the way they are, or\n   that\
    \ someone else provoked it, or that the person is generally well-\n   intentioned.\
    \  Further, anyone expressing concern about the behavior\n   is typically admonished\
    \ to be less sensitive; that is, a recipient of\n   an attack who then complains\
    \ is often criticized or dismissed.\n   As the IETF opened its doors to participation\
    \ by anyone, its\n   demographics have predictably moved towards much greater\
    \ variety.\n   However, the group culture has not adapted to accommodate these\n\
    \   changes.  The aggressive debating style and the tolerance for\n   personal\
    \ attacks can be extremely off-putting for participants from\n   more polite cultures.\
    \  And, the management selection processes can\n   tend to exclude some constituencies\
    \ inappropriately.\n   Recently, members of an informal IETF women's interest\
    \ group, called\n   \"systers\", organized a quiet experiment, putting forward\
    \ a large\n   number of women candidates for management positions, through the\n\
    \   IETF's \"NomCom\" process.  NomCom is itself a potentially diverse\n   group\
    \ of IETF participants, chosen at random from a pool of recent\n   meeting attendees\
    \ who offer their services.  Hence, its problematic\n   choices -- or rather,\
    \ omissions -- could be seen as reflecting IETF\n   culture generally.\n   Over\
    \ the years, some women have been chosen for IETF positions as\n   authors, working\
    \ group chairs, area directors, Internet Architecture\n   Board [IAB] members,\
    \ and IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\n   [IAOC] members.  However, the\
    \ results of the systers experiment were\n   not encouraging.  In spite of their\
    \ recruiting a disproportionately\n   high number of female candidates, not a\
    \ single one was selected.\n   Although any one candidate might be rejected for\
    \ entirely legitimate\n   reasons, a pattern of rejection this consistent suggested\
    \ an\n   organizational bias.  The results were presented at an IETF plenary,\n\
    \   and they engendered significant IETF soul-searching, as well as\n   creation\
    \ of a group to consider diversity issues for the IETF\n   [Div-DT] [Div-Discuss].\n\
    \   Other activities around that same time also engendered IETF\n   consideration\
    \ of unacceptable behaviors, generally classed as\n   harassment.  This resulted\
    \ in the IESG's issuing a formal IETF anti-\n   harassment policy [Anti-Harass].\n\
    \   Changing an organization's culture is difficult and requires not only\n  \
    \ commitment to the underlying principles, but also vigilant and\n   sustained\
    \ effort.  The IESG has taken essential first steps.  What is\n   needed is going\
    \ beyond the position papers and expression of ideals,\n   into continuing education\
    \ of the entire community, and immediate and\n   substantive response to unacceptable\
    \ behaviors.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Diversity
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Diversity\n   Diversity concerns the variability of a group's composition.\
    \  It can\n   reasonably touch every conceivable participant attribute.  It\n\
    \   includes task-related attributes, such as knowledge and experience,\n   as\
    \ well as the usual range of \"identified class\" attributes,\n   including race,\
    \ creed, color, religion, gender and sexual\n   orientation, but also extends\
    \ to all manner of beliefs, behaviors,\n   experiences, preferences, and economic\
    \ status.\n   The factors affecting the quality of group decision-making are\n\
    \   complex and subtle, and are not subject to precise specification.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ in broad terms, groups with greater diversity make\n   better decisions [Kellogg].\
    \  They perform better at diverse tasks\n   both in terms of quantity and quality,\
    \ and a great deal of research\n   has found that heterogeneity often acts as\
    \ a conduit for ideas and\n   innovation [WiseCrowd] [Horowitz] [Stahl] [Joshi].\
    \  The implicit\n   assumptions of one participant might not be considerations\
    \ for\n   another and might even be unknown by still others.  And, different\n\
    \   participants can bring different bases of knowledge and different\n   styles\
    \ of analysis.  People with the same background and experience\n   will all too\
    \ readily bring the same ideas forward and subject them to\n   the same analysis,\
    \ thus diminishing the likelihood for new ideas and\n   methods to emerge, or\
    \ underlying problems to be noted.\n   However, a desire to diligently attend\
    \ to group diversity often leads\n   to mechanical, statistical efforts to ensure\
    \ representation by every\n   identified constituency.  For smaller populations,\
    \ like the IETF and\n   especially for its small management teams, this approach\
    \ is\n   counterproductive.  First, it is not possible to identify every\n   single\
    \ constituency that might be relevant.  Second, the group size\n   does not permit\
    \ representation by every group.  Consequently, in\n   practical terms, legitimate\
    \ representation of diversity only requires\n   meaningful variety, not slavish\
    \ bookkeeping.  In addition, without\n   care, it can lead to the negative effects\
    \ of diversity where\n   decision-making is slowed, interaction decreased, and\
    \ conflict\n   increased [Horowitz].\n   Pragmatically, then, concern for diversity\
    \ merely requires serious\n   attention to satisfying two requirements:\n    \
    \  Participant Diversity:   Decisions about who is allowed into the\n        \
    \ group require ensuring that the selection process encourages\n         varying\
    \ attributes among members.  That is, this concerns\n         variety in group\
    \ demographics.\n      Participation Diversity:   Achieving effective generation\
    \ of ideas\n         and reviews within a group requires ensuring that its\n \
    \        discussions encourage constructive participation by all members\n   \
    \      and that the views of each member are considered seriously.\n         This,\
    \ then, concerns group dynamics.\n   In other words, look for real variety in\
    \ group composition and real\n   variety in participant discussion.  This will\
    \ identify a greater\n   variety of possible and practical solutions.\n   Obtaining\
    \ meaningful diversity requires more than generic good will\n   and statements\
    \ of principle.  The challenges, here, are to actively:\n   o  Encourage constructive\
    \ diversity\n   o  Work to avoid group dynamics that serve to reduce diversity\n\
    \   o  Work to avoid group dynamics that serve to diminish the benefits\n    \
    \  of diversity\n   o  Remove those dynamics when they still occur\n   It also\
    \ requires education about the practicalities of diversity in\n   an open engineering\
    \ environment, and it requires organizational\n   processes that regularly consider\
    \ what effect each decision might\n   have on diversity.\n   Examples abound:\n\
    \   o  Formally, an IETF working group makes its decisions on its mailing\n  \
    \    list.  Since anyone can join the list, anyone with access to the\n      Internet\
    \ can participate.  However, working groups also have\n      sessions at the thrice-annual\
    \ IETF face-to-face meetings and might\n      also hold interim meetings, which\
    \ are face to face, by telephone,\n      or by video conference.  Attendance at\
    \ these can be challenging.\n      Getting to a face-to-face meeting costs a great\
    \ deal of money and\n      time; remote participation often incurs time-shifting\
    \ that\n      includes very early or very late hours.  So, increased working\n\
    \      group reliance on meetings tends to exclude those with less\n      funding\
    \ or less travel time or more structured work schedules.\n   o  Vigorous advocacy\
    \ for a strongly held technical preference is\n      common in engineering communities.\
    \  Of course it can be healthy,\n      since strong support is necessary to promote\
    \ success of the work.\n      However, in the IETF this can be manifest in two\
    \ ways that are\n      problematic.  One is a personal style that is overly aggressive\n\
    \      and serves to intimidate, and hence unreasonably gag, those with\n    \
    \  other views.  The other is a group style that prematurely embraces\n      a\
    \ choice and does not permit a fair hearing for alternatives.\n   o  Predictably,\
    \ engineers value engineering skills.  When the task is\n      engineering, this\
    \ is entirely appropriate.  However, many of the\n      IETF's activities, in\
    \ support of its engineering efforts, are less\n      about engineering and more\
    \ about human and organizational\n      processes.  These require very different\
    \ skills.  To the extent\n      that participants in those processes are primarily\
    \ considered in\n      terms of their engineering prowess, those who are instead\
    \ stronger\n      in other, relevant skills will be undervalued, and the diversity\n\
    \      of expertise that the IETF needs will be lost.\n   o  IETF standards are\
    \ meant to be read, understood, and implemented\n      by people who were not\
    \ part of the working group process.  The\n      gist of the standards also often\
    \ needs to be read by managers and\n      operators who are not engineers.  IETF\
    \ specifications enjoy quite\n      a bit of stylistic freedom to contain pedagogy,\
    \ in the service of\n      these audience goals.  However, the additional effort\
    \ to be\n      instructional is significant, and active participants who already\n\
    \      understand and embrace the technical details often decline from\n     \
    \ making that effort.  Worse, that effort is also needed during the\n      specification\
    \ development effort, since many participants might\n      lack the background\
    \ or superior insight needed to appreciate what\n      is being specified.  Yet\
    \ the IETF's mantra for \"rough consensus\"\n      is exactly about the need to\
    \ recruit support.  In fact, the\n      process of \"educating\" others often\
    \ uncovers issues that have been\n      missed.\n"

  - "2.2.  Harassment and Bullying\n   Many different behaviors can serve to reduce\
    \ participant diversity or\n   participation diversity.  One class of efforts\
    \ is based on overt\n   actions to marginalize certain participants by intimidating\
    \ them into\n   silence or departure.  Intimidation efforts divide into two styles\n\
    \   warranting distinction.  One is harassment, which pertains to biased\n   treatment\
    \ of demographic classes.  A number of identified classes are\n   usually protected\
    \ by law, and community understanding that such\n   biased behavior cannot be\
    \ tolerated has progressively improved.\n   Other intimidation efforts are tailored\
    \ to targeted individuals and\n   are generally labeled bullying [Har-Bul] [Workplace]\
    \ [Signs]\n   [Escalated] [Prevention].  The nature and extent of bullying in\
    \ the\n   workplace is widely underestimated, misunderstood, and mishandled.\n\
    \   It is described as follows in a WikiHow article [wikiHow]:\n      ...[B]ehavior\
    \ directed at an employee that is intended to degrade,\n      humiliate, embarrass,\
    \ or otherwise undermine their performance...\n      [T]he sure signs of a bully\
    \ that signify more than a simple\n      misunderstanding or personal disagreement...\
    \ might include:\n      *  Shouting, whether in private, in front of colleagues,\
    \ or in\n         front of customers\n      *  Name-calling\n      *  Belittling\
    \ or disrespectful comments\n      *  Excessive monitoring, criticizing, or nitpicking\
    \ someone's work\n      *  Deliberately overloading someone with work\n      *\
    \  Undermining someone's work by setting them up to fail\n      *  Purposefully\
    \ withholding information needed to perform a job\n         efficiently\n    \
    \  *  Actively excluding someone from normal workplace/staff room\n         conversations\
    \ and making someone feel unwelcome\n   In addition, the Tim Field Foundation\
    \ [Bully-Ser] lists the traits of\n   a \"serial bully\", paraphrased below:\n\
    \   o  Jekyll and Hyde nature -- Dr Jekyll is 'charming' and\n      'charismatic';\
    \ 'Hyde' is 'evil'\n   o  Exploits the trust and needs of organizations and individuals,\
    \ for\n      personal gain\n   o  Convincing liar -- Makes up anything to fit\
    \ their needs at that\n      moment\n   o  Damages the health and reputations\
    \ of organizations and\n      individuals\n   o  Reacts to criticism with Denial,\
    \ Retaliation, Feigned Victimhood\n      [Defensive], [MB-Misuse]\n   o  Blames\
    \ victims\n   o  Apparently immune from disciplinary action\n   o  Moves to a\
    \ new target when the present one burns out\n   Whether directed at classes or\
    \ individuals, intimidation methods used\n   can:\n   o  Seem relatively passive,\
    \ such as consistently ignoring a member\n   o  Seem mild, such as with a quiet\
    \ tone or language of condescension\n   o  Be quite active, such as aggressively\
    \ attacking what is said by\n      the participant\n   o  Be disingenuous, masking\
    \ attacks in a passive-aggressive style\n   If tolerated by others, and especially\
    \ by those managing the group,\n   these methods create a hostile work environment\
    \ [Dealing].\n      When public harassment or bullying is tolerated, the hostile\n\
    \      environment is not only for the person directly subject to the\n      attacks.\n\
    \      The harassment also serves to intimidate others who observe that\n    \
    \  it is tolerated.  It teaches them that misbehaviors will not be\n      held\
    \ accountable.\n   The IETF's Anti-Harassment Policy [Anti-Harass] uses a single\
    \ term to\n   cover the classic harassment of identified constituencies, as well\
    \ as\n   the targeted behavior of bullying.  The policy's text is therefore\n\
    \   comprehensive, defining unacceptable behavior as \"unwelcome hostile\n   or\
    \ intimidating behavior.\"  Further, it declares: \"Harassment of this\n   sort\
    \ will not be tolerated in the IETF.\"  An avenue for seeking\n   remedy when\
    \ harassment occurs is specified as a designated\n   Ombudsperson.\n   Unified\
    \ handling of bullying and harassment is exemplified in the\n   policies of many\
    \ different organizations, notably including those\n   with widely varying membership,\
    \ even to the point of open,\n   international participation, similar to that\
    \ of the IETF.  Examples\n   include:\n      Scouts Canada:\n         Bullying/Harassment\
    \ Policy [SC-Cybul]\n      IEEE:\n         Code of Conduct [IEEE-Cybul]\n    \
    \  Facebook:\n         Community Standards [F-H-Cybul]\n      LinkedIn:\n    \
    \     \"Be Nice\" in LinkedIn Professional Community Guidelines\n         [L-H-Cybul]\n\
    \      YouTube:\n         Harassment and cyberbullying [Y-H-Cybul]\n      NetHui:\n\
    \         Kaupapa and code of conduct [NetHui]\n      GeekFeminism:\n        \
    \ Conference anti-harassment: Adopting a policy [GeekFeminism]\n   In fact, there\
    \ is a view that harassment is merely a form of\n   bullying, given the same goal\
    \ of undermining participation by the\n   target:\n      Sexual harassment is\
    \ bullying or coercion of a sexual nature...\n      [Wiki-SexHarass]\n   The IETF\
    \ has a long history of tolerating aggressive and even hostile\n   behavior by\
    \ participants.  So, this policy signals a formal and\n   welcome change.  The\
    \ obvious challenge is to make the change real,\n   moving the IETF from a culture\
    \ that tolerates -- or even encourages\n   -- interpersonal misbehaviors to one\
    \ that provides a safe,\n   professional, and productive haven for its increasingly\
    \ diverse\n   community.\n   Here again, examples abound, to the present:\n  \
    \ o  Amongst long-time colleagues, acceptable interpersonal style can\n      be\
    \ whatever the colleagues want, even though it might look quite\n      off-putting\
    \ to an observer.  The problem occurs when an IETF\n      participant engages\
    \ in such behaviors with, or in the presence of,\n      others who have not agreed\
    \ to the social contract of that\n      relationship style and might not even\
    \ understand it.  For these\n      others, the behavior can be extremely alienating,\
    \ creating a\n      disincentive against participation.  Yet, in the IETF, it\
    \ is\n      common for participants to feel entitled to behave in overly\n   \
    \   familiar or aggressive or even hostile fashion that might be\n      acceptable\
    \ amongst colleagues, but is destructive with strangers.\n   o  The instant a\
    \ comment is made that concerns any attribute of a\n      speaker, such as their\
    \ motives, the nature of their employer, or\n      the quality of their participation\
    \ style, the interaction has\n      moved away from technical evaluation.  In\
    \ many cultures, all such\n      utterances are intimidating or offensive.  In\
    \ an open,\n      professional participation environment, they therefore cannot\
    \ be\n      permitted.\n   o  As a matter of personal style or momentary enthusiasm,\
    \ it is easy\n      to indulge in condescending or dismissive commentary about\n\
    \      someone's statements.  As a discussion technique, its function is\n   \
    \   to attempt to reduce the target's influence on the group.  Whether\n     \
    \ nonverbal (such as rolling one's eyes), paternalistic (such as\n      noting\
    \ the target's naivete), or overtly hostile (such as\n      impugning the target's\
    \ motives), it is an attempt to marginalize\n      the person rather than focus\
    \ on the merits of what they are\n      saying.  It constitutes harassment or\
    \ bullying.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Access
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Access\n   Aiding participants with access to IETF materials and discussions\n\
    \   means that it is easy for them to:\n   o  Know what exists\n   o  Find what\
    \ is of interest\n   o  Retrieve documents or gain access to discussions\n   o\
    \  Be able to understand the content\n   After materials and discussions are located,\
    \ the primary means of\n   making it easy to access the substance of the work\
    \ is for statements\n   to be made in language that is clear and explanatory.\
    \  Writers and\n   speakers need to carefully consider the likely audience and\
    \ package\n   statements accordingly.  This often means taking a more tutorial\n\
    \   approach than one might naturally choose.  In speech, it means\n   speaking\
    \ more deliberately, a bit more clearly and a bit more slowly\n   than needed\
    \ with close collaborators.  When language is cryptic or\n   filled with linguistic\
    \ idiosyncrasies and when speech is too fast, it\n   is dramatically less accessible\
    \ to a diverse audience.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Engagement
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Engagement\n   Once content is accessible, the challenge is to garner diverse\n\
    \   contribution for further development.  Engagement means that it is\n   easy\
    \ for constructive participants to be heard and taken seriously\n   through constructive\
    \ interaction.\n   Within the IETF, the most common challenge is choosing how\
    \ to respond\n   to comments.  The essence of the IETF is making proposals and\n\
    \   offering comments on proposals; disagreement is common and often\n   healthy,\
    \ depending upon the manner in which disagreement is pursued.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Facilitation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Facilitation\n   In order to obtain the best technology, the best ideas\
    \ need first to\n   be harvested.  Processes that promote free-ranging discussion,\
    \ tease\n   out new ideas, and tackle concerns should be promoted.  This will\n\
    \   also run to:\n   o  Encouraging contributions from timid speakers\n   o  Showing\
    \ warmth for new contributors\n   o  Preventing dominance by, or blind deference\
    \ to, those perceived as\n      the more senior and authoritative contributors\n\
    \   o  Actively shutting down derogatory styles\n   It is important that participants\
    \ be facilitated in tendering their\n   own ideas readily so that innovation thrives.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Balance
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Balance\n   There is the larger challenge of finding balance between efforts\
    \ to\n   facilitate diversity versus efforts to achieve work goals.  Efforts\n\
    \   to be inclusive include a degree of tutorial assistance for new\n   participants.\
    \  They also include some tolerance for participants who\n   are less efficient\
    \ at doing the work.  Further, not everyone is\n   capable of being constructive,\
    \ and the burdens of accommodating such\n   folk can easily become onerous.\n\
    \   As an example, there can be tradeoffs with meeting agendas.  There is\n  \
    \ common pushback on having working group meetings be a succession of\n   presentations.\
    \  For good efficiency, participants want to have just\n   enough presentation\
    \ to frame a question, and then spend face-to-face\n   time in discussion.  However,\
    \ \"just enough presentation\" does not\n   leave much room for tutorial commentary\
    \ to aid those new to the\n   effort.  Meeting time is always too short, and the\
    \ primary\n   requirement is to achieve forward progress.\n"
- title: 3.5.  IETF Track Record
  contents:
  - "3.5.  IETF Track Record\n   The IETF's track record for making its technical\
    \ documents openly\n   available is notably superb, as is its official policy\
    \ of open\n   participation in mailing lists and meetings.  Its track record with\n\
    \   management and process documentation is more varied, partly because\n   these\
    \ cover overhead functions, rather than being in the main line of\n   IETF work\
    \ and, therefore, expertise.  So, they do not always get\n   diligent attention.\
    \  Factors include the inherent challenges in doing\n   management by engineers,\
    \ as well as challenges in making management\n   and process documents usable\
    \ for non-experts and non-native English\n   speakers.\n   On the surface, the\
    \ IETF's track record for open access and\n   engagement therefore looks astonishingly\
    \ good, since there is no\n   \"membership\", and anyone is permitted to join\
    \ IETF mailing lists and\n   attend IETF meetings.  Indeed, for those with good\
    \ funding, time for\n   travel, and skills at figuring out the IETF culture, the\
    \ record\n   really does qualify as excellent.\n   However, very real challenges\
    \ exist for those who have funding,\n   logistics, or language limitations.  In\
    \ particular, these impede\n   attendance at meetings.  Another challenge is for\
    \ those from more\n   polite cultures who are alienated by the style of aggressive\
    \ debate\n   that is popular in the IETF.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Avoiding Distraction
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Avoiding Distraction\n   For any one participant, some other participant's\
    \ contributions might\n   be considered problematic, possibly having little or\
    \ no value.\n   Worse, some contributions are in a style that excites a personal,\n\
    \   negative reaction.\n   The manner chosen for responding to such contributions\
    \ dramatically\n   affects group productivity.  Attacking the speaker's style\
    \ or motives\n   or credentials is not useful, and primarily serves to distract\n\
    \   discussion from matters of substance.  In the face of such challenges\n  \
    \ and among the many possible ways to pursue constructive exchange,\n   guidance\
    \ includes:\n   o  Ignore such contributions; perhaps someone else can produce\
    \ a\n      productive exchange, but there is no requirement that anyone\n    \
    \  respond.\n   o  Respond to the content, not the author; in the extreme, literally\n\
    \      ignore the author and merely address the group about the content.\n   o\
    \  Offer better content, including an explanation of the reasons it\n      is\
    \ better.\n   The essential point here is that the way to have a constructive\n\
    \   exchange about substance is to focus on the substance.  The way to\n   avoid\
    \ getting distracted is to ignore whatever is personal and\n   irrelevant to the\
    \ substance.\n"
- title: 4.  Responses to Unconstructive Participation
  contents:
  - "4.  Responses to Unconstructive Participation\n   Sometimes problematic participants\
    \ cannot reasonably be ignored.\n   Their behavior is too disruptive, too offensive,\
    \ or too damaging to\n   group exchange.  Any of us might have a moment of excess,\
    \ but when\n   the behavior is too extreme or represents a pattern, it warrants\n\
    \   intervention.\n   A common view is that this should be pursued personally,\
    \ but for such\n   cases, it rarely has much effect.  This is where IETF management\n\
    \   intervention is required.  The IETF now has a reasonably rich set of\n   policies\
    \ concerning problematic behavior.  So, the requirement is\n   merely to exercise\
    \ the policies diligently.  Depending on the\n   details, the working group chair,\
    \ mailing list moderator,\n   Ombudsperson, or perhaps IETF Chair is the appropriate\
    \ person to\n   contact [MlLists] [Anti-Harass].\n   The challenge, here, is for\
    \ both management and the rest of the\n   community to collaborate in communicating\
    \ that harassment and\n   bullying will not be tolerated.  The formal policies\
    \ make that\n   declaration, but they have no meaning unless they are enforced.\n\
    \   Abusive behavior is easily extinguished.  All it takes is community\n   resolve.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security of the IETF's role in the Internet\
    \ community depends\n   upon its credibility as an open and productive venue for\n\
    \   collaborative development of technical documents.  More diverse\n   scrutiny\
    \ leads to increased rigor, so the quality of technical\n   documents will potentially\
    \ improve.  The potential for future legal\n   liability in the various jurisdictions\
    \ within which the IETF operates\n   also indicates a need to act to reinforce\
    \ behavioral policies with\n   specific attention to workplace safety.\n"
