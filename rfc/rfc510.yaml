  - "                 Request for Network Mailbox Addresses\n   To Liaisons:\n   Within\
    \ the next few weeks, the NIC will begin providing Network\n   Journal delivery\
    \ to those users in the Net who desire it.\n      Submission of Journal articles\
    \ will also be possible through FTP.\n   Each user will then have his choice of\
    \ three Journal delivery modes:\n   ONLINE delivery to the AUTHOR branch of his\
    \ initial file at the NIC,\n   HARDCOPY delivery to his place of business via\
    \ the Postal Service,\n   and NETWORK delivery to his on-line mailbox at his home\
    \ host.  Each\n   user may select any or all forms of delivery.\n   Initially,\
    \ Network Journal delivery will consist of the following:\n      Each piece of\
    \ mail addressed to the user will be delivered to a\n      host and mailbox of\
    \ his choosing, using the mail command(s)\n      defined by the File Transfer\
    \ Protocol.  The mail will contain in\n      its text, a header containing the\
    \ author's NIC Ident, the date of\n      submission, a title, etc., and either\
    \ the text of the message or,\n      if it's long, a pointer to it (according\
    \ to the 'Submit Message'\n      and 'Submit File' distinction in NLS Journal\
    \ submission).  More\n      than one piece of Journal mail may, in general, be\
    \ delivered as a\n      single piece of FTP mail.\n      The user's delivery host\
    \ and mailbox will be stored in the NIC's\n      Ident file, and the user can\
    \ change or view them (along with his\n      delivery mode(s)) from the Identification\
    \ System in NLS.\n      The pointer sent to the user for bulk mail will be a pathname\
    \ by\n      which an FTP user process, acting on the user's behalf, can\n    \
    \  retrieve the text of the mail from SRI-ARC.  The pathname will\n      contain\
    \ the necessary parameters to cause SRI-ARC's FTP server\n      process to convert\
    \ the file from NLS (tree-structured) to\n      sequential form before transmission.\n\
    \   The purpose of this memo is not to document the service (we'll do\n   that\
    \ as soon as it's available), but to solicit help from Liaisons,\n   each of whom\
    \ is asked to provide the NIC with the following\n   information for EACH user\
    \ affiliated with his host organization who\n   desires Network Journal delivery:\n\
    \      (1) His NIC Ident.\n      (2) The type(s) of delivery he desires, if any,\
    \ IN ADDITION TO\n          Network delivery.\n          It's fair, for example,\
    \ to retain one's current delivery mode\n          initially until convinced that\
    \ Network delivery really works.\n      (3) The standard host name or decimal\
    \ host address of the host at\n          which he desires delivery.\n        \
    \  TIP users, for example, may choose to receive delivery at\n          their\
    \ favorite TENEX host.\n      (4) The 'user name' his host's FTP server process\
    \ requires to\n          identify him in the context of an FTP mail command.\n\
    \            For a TENEX user, for example, that's his directory.\n   Please communicate\
    \ answers to these questions in writing to Jim White\n   -- to JEW through the\
    \ Journal, to WHITE@SRI-ARC via FTP mail, or to\n   Jim White at the NIC via the\
    \ Postal Service.  All information\n   obtained in response to this memo will\
    \ be made accessible form NLS\n   (as already mentioned) and from a yet-to-be-written\
    \ Ident server\n   process, and will be maintained by the NIC as a functional\
    \ document\n   in on-line and hardcopy forms.\n   We ask Liaisons to assume responsibility\
    \ for providing delivery\n   parameters for all interested users at their host,\
    \ although\n   information will be gladly accepted from anyone who chooses to\n\
    \   provide it.\n   Thanks.\n   Jim White\n         [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n            [ into the online RFC archives by Tim\
    \ Mains 12/97 ]\n"
