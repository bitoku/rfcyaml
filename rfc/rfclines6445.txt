Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used to support two fast reroute (FRR) methods for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) based traffic engineering (TE).
The two methods are the one to one backup method and the facility backup method.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) containing objects used to manage Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) based fast rerouting features on MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) as defined in [RFC4090].
The MIB modules defined in this document should be used in conjunction with [RFC3811], [RFC3812], and [RFC3813].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document uses terminology from "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture" [RFC3031] and from "Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP TE for LSP Tunnels" [RFC4090].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB module objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Overview of the MIB Modules [RFC4090] stipulates two different approaches to implementing MPLS
TE fast reroute: one to one backup and facility backup.
We define three MIB modules to represent the respective components: general, one to one backup, and facility backup.
Contains objects that apply to any MPLS LSR implementing MPLS TE fast reroute functionality.
: Contains objects that apply to the one to one backup method.
: Contains objects that apply to the facility backup method.
Although [RFC4090] specifies that a node is able to support both fast reroute methods simultaneously, common practice has shown that operators choose to configure either the one to one backup method or the facility backup method at any given time.
So, by dividing the MIB modules into three, we allow the developers to choose the MIB modules they want to implement, depending on the method supported on that node.
This MIB module MUST be implemented if either of the fast reroute methods is implemented.
This table contains objects that apply to all LSRs implementing MPLS TE fast reroute functions.
In particular, this table defines fast  reroute constraints, such as bandwidth, for a tunnel instance to be protected by using backup Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
(detour LSPs or bypass tunnels).
This table MUST be implemented at the ingress node of the protected TE tunnel instance to configure backup LSP setup constraints.
This table extends mplsTunnelARHopTable (defined in the MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812]) with fast reroute objects that specify the local protection type or types of availability, as well as what type or types are actually in use for each tunnel hop traversed by a protected TE tunnel.
Example of Relationship between Various Tables of MPLS
FRR GENERAL STD MIB (R1) (R2)
Protected LSP:  [R1 R2 R3 R4 R5]
[R1 R6 R7 R8 R3]
In the above topology, the various tables on R1 will be populated as indicated below.
localProtectionDesired mplsFrrGeneralTunnelARHopRROSubObjectFlags   2   localProtectionInUse }; 4.2.
This MIB module MUST be implemented if the one to one backup fast  reroute method is implemented.
The mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTable contains information about Points of Local Repair (PLRs) that initiated detour LSPs to protect tunnel instances.
This table MUST be supported for LSRs implementing the one to one backup method.
In these cases, the detour LSPs are reflected in the mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable.
The mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable shows the detour LSPs in each node (ingress, transit, and egress nodes).
An entry in this table represents a detour LSP.
Each detour is identified by the following indexes: mplsTunnelIndex [RFC3812]
: set to the Tunnel ID of an LSP protected by a detour.
: consists of two parts: 1)
uniquely identifies a protected LSP within a tunnel.
2) the lower 16 bits:
detour instance uniquely identifies a detour LSP of a protected TE tunnel instance.
Multiple detours of the same protected LSP may go through the same node.
In this case, the higher 16 bits of the tunnel instance object is used as a detour instance.
ingress node's LSR ID (mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelIngressLSRId): set to the ingress node of an LSP protected by a detour.
egress node's LSR ID (mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelEgressLSRId):
set to the egress node of an LSP protected by a detour.
A detour LSP is also considered as an instance of a protected TE tunnel.
Therefore, each detour LSP SHOULD have an entry in the mplsTunnelTable (defined in the MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812]).
The mplsTunnelTable entries are indexed using mplsTunnelIndex, mplsTunnelInstance, mplsTunnelIngressLSRId, and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId.
Entries where the higher 16 bits of mplsTunnelInstance are set to zero represent detour TE tunnel instances.
All other values of the higher 16 bits represent protected tunnel instances.
This table MUST be supported if the one to one backup method is used.
Example of Relationship between mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTable, mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable, and mplsTunnelTable
This section contains an example depicting the interrelationship between mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTable, mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable, and mplsTunnelTable.
Protected LSP:  [R1 R2 R3 R4 R5]
[R1 R6 R7 R8 R3]
In the above topology, the various tables will be populated as indicated below.
1 is mplsTunnelInstance for the detour LSP   from mplsTunnelTable.
Need to OR the index value into low order bits)
To get all detour LSPs of a protected tunnel (of instance 100)
we could do an snmpwalk of the mplsFrrOne2OneDetourEntry
where mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelIndex   1   mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelDetourInstance   6553600
, mplsTunnelSessionAttributes    0, mplsTunnelLocalProtectInUse    true(1),
This MIB module MUST be implemented if the facility backup fast reroute method is implemented.
mplsFrrFacilityDBTable The mplsFrrFacilityDBTable provides information about the fast  reroute database for facility based fast reroute.
An entry is created in this table for each tunnel being protected by a backup tunnel.
Backup tunnels are defined to protect the tunnels traversing an interface.
The protecting tunnel will exist on the PLR as per [RFC4090].
Protected tunnels are the LSPs that traverse the protected link.
Example of Relationship between Various Tables of MPLS
FRR FACILITY STD MIB [R1] [R2] [R3] [R4] [R5]
, mplsTunnelSessionAttributes    0, mplsTunnelLocalProtectInUse    true(1),
As described in [RFC4990], in order to support IPv6 MPLS tunnels in the mplsTunnelTable [RFC3812], all LSRs in the network MUST have a 32 bit LSR ID that can be used to identify the LSR with the existing mplsTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsTunnelEgressLSRId objects, which are 32 bits long.
In this MIB, the following objects, which refer to ingress/egress LSRs, will therefore have the 32 bit LSR ID to support IPv6 tunnels:  mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelEgressLSRId objects of the mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTable  mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTunnelEgressLSRId objects of the mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable  mplsFrrFacilityBackupTunnelIngressLSRId and mplsFrrFacilityBackupTunnelEgressLSRId objects of the mplsFrrFacilityDBTable 6.

Fast Reroute Constraints table mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsTable OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"This table shows detour LSP or bypass tunnel setup constraints."
"An entry in this table represents detour LSP or bypass tunnel setup constraints for an interface or link to be protected by detour LSPs or a bypass tunnel.
Once the LSP or tunnel instance to be protected is identified in the mplsTunnelTable, the corresponding mplsTunnelIfIndex value of that tunnel can be used to get the ifIndex of the underlying physical interface using the ifStackTable.
That ifIndex of the underlying physical interface will be used as mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsIfIndexOrZero in this table to protect the LSPs or tunnel instances determined earlier.
It is recommended that ifIndex persistence be enabled across re initializations.
If persistence is not implemented, then the value of mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsIfIndexOrZero in this table cannot be guaranteed across restarts and all entries in this table MUST NOT be persistent, or the values of mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsIfIndexOrZero MUST be reconstructed on restart.
SNMP engines must only allow entries in this table to be created for tunnel instances that require fast reroute as indicated by the presence of the FAST REROUTE object in the signaling for the LSP in question.
An entry in this table can be created only if a corresponding entry in mplsTunnelTable exists with the same mplsTunnelIndex as mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsTunnelIndex.
Entries in this table are deleted when the corresponding entries in mplsTunnelTable are deleted.
It is recommended that entries in this table be persistent across reboots.
Entries indexed with mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsIfIndexOrZero and set to 0 apply to all interfaces on this device for which the FRR feature can operate.
If the mplsTunnelInstance object is set to a value of 0, it indicates that the mplsTunnelEntry contains a tunnel ingress.
This is typically how configuration of this feature is performed on devices where the actual protection LSP used is left up to the protecting tunnel.
However, in cases where static configuration is possible, any valid tunnel instance is possible; however, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the instance index SHOULD use the following convention to identify backup LSPs: lower 16 bits :
protected tunnel instance higher 16 bits: must be all zeros" REFERENCE "Section 4.1 of RFC 4090 and Section 6.1 of RFC 3812.
Uniquely identifies an interface that a fast reroute protection tunnel is configured to potentially protect in the event of a fault.
Entries with this index set to 0 indicate that the configured protection tunnel protects all interfaces on this device (i.e., node protection)."
Uniquely identifies a tunnel in the mplsTunnelTable that is configured to possibly protect the interface(s) specified by mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsIfIndexOrZero in the event of a fault.
Uniquely identifies an existing instance of this tunnel for which fast reroute is requested.
Note that a value of 0 indicates that the configuration points at a tunnel head (as specified in RFC 3812).
This is typically how configuration of this feature is performed on devices where the actual protection LSP used is left up to the protecting tunnel.
However, in cases where static configuration is possible, any valid tunnel instance is permissible.

FRR FACILITY STD MIB 7.
It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for the monitoring of MPLS LSRs supporting fast reroute.
These MIB modules can also be used for configuration of certain objects; note that anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.
There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB modules with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsTable (mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsProtectionType, mplsFrrGeneralConstraintsSetupPrio, etc.), and some objects in the mplsFrrScalarGroup (mplsFrrGeneralProtectionMethod, mplsFrrFacilityNotificationsEnabled, etc.)
contain objects that may be used to provision MPLS fast reroute features.
Unauthorized access to these objects could result in disruption of traffic on the network.
Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The mplsFrrOne2OnePlrTable (mplsFrrOne2OnePlrSenderAddr, mplsFrrOne2OnePlrAvoidNodeAddr, etc.), mplsFrrOne2OneDetourTable
(mplsFrrOne2OneDetourActive, mplsFrrOne2OneDetourMergedDetourInst, etc.), and mplsFrrGeneralTunnelARHopTable (mplsFrrGeneralTunnelARHopSessionAttributeFlags, mplsFrrGeneralTunnelARHopRROSubObjectFlags, etc.), and some objects contained in the mplsFrrScalarGroup (mplsFrrGeneralProtectionMethod, mplsFrrActiveInterfaces, etc.), collectively show the MPLS fast reroute interfaces, tunnels, and other associated fast reroute feature configurations as well as their linkages to other MPLS related configuration and/or performance statistics.
Administrators not wishing to reveal this information should consider these objects sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not revealed.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in these MIB modules.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB modules in this document use the IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry.
FRR GENERAL STD MIB IANA has assigned { mib 2 202 } to the MPLS
FRR GENERAL STD MIB module specified in this document.
ONE2ONE STD MIB IANA has assigned { mib 2 203 } to the MPLS
ONE2ONE STD MIB module specified in this document.
FACILITY STD MIB IANA has assigned { mib 2 204 } to the MPLS
FACILITY STD MIB module specified in this document.
