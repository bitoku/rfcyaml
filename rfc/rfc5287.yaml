    \   [RFC4447] and PWE3 IANA allocations [RFC4446] required for the setup\n   of\
    \ TDM pseudowires in MPLS networks.\n   Structure-agnostic TDM pseudowires have\
    \ been specified in [RFC4553],\n   and structure-aware ones have been specified\
    \ in [RFC5086] and\n   [RFC5087].\n   [RFC4447] defines extensions to the Label\
    \ Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n   [RFC5036] that are required to exchange PW labels\
    \ for PWs emulating\n   various Layer 2 services (Ethernet, Frame Relay (FR),\
    \ Asynchronous\n   Transfer Mode (ATM), High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), etc.).\
    \  The\n   setup of TDM PWs requires both interpretation of the existing\n   information\
    \ elements of these extensions and exchange of additional\n   information.\n \
    \  The setup of TDM PWs using L2TPv3 will be defined in a separate\n   document.\n\
    \   The status of attachment circuits of TDM PWs can be exchanged between\n  \
    \ the terminating Provider Edges (PEs) using the PW Status mechanism\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC4447] without any changes.  However, usage of this\n   mechanism is NOT\
    \ RECOMMENDED for TDM PWs since the indication of the\n   status of the TDM attachment\
    \ circuits is carried in-band in the data\n   plane.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

    \   If not explicitly indicated otherwise in the appropriate description,\n  \
    \ the value of the interface parameter is interpreted as an unsigned\n   integer\
    \ of the appropriate size (16 or 32 bits).\n   Note: The length of basic TDMoIP\
    \ AAL2 Options interface parameter is\n   8 bytes, and when the optional Channel\
    \ ID (CID) mapping bases field\n   is used, there is one additional byte for each\
    \ trunk transported.\n   Thus, if 1 trunk is being supported, this message occupies\
    \ 9 bytes.\n   Since there can be no more than 248 CIDs in a given PW, this can\n\
    \   never exceed 256 (this when each channel comes from a different\n   trunk).\
    \  248 channels translates to less than 9 E1s, and so, for this\n   case, the\
    \ length is\n   no more than 17 bytes.  A single PE is not required to support\
    \ more\n   than 10 AAL2 PWs (i.e., up to 2480 individual channels, which is more\n\
    \   than carried by a fully populated STM1).  Thus, the memory required\n   to\

  contents:
  - "4.  Extending CESoPSN Basic NxDS0 Services with CE Application Signaling\n  \
    \ [RFC5086] states that basic NxDS0 services can be extended to carry\n   CE application\
    \ signaling (e.g., CAS) in special signaling packets\n   carried in a separate\
    \ PW.\n   The following rules define the setup of matching pairs of CESoPSN PWs\n\
    \   using the PW ID FEC and the extensions defined above:\n   1. The two PWs MUST:\n\
    \      a) Have the same PW type.\n      b) Use the same setup method (i.e., either\
    \ both use the PWId FEC,\n         or both use the Generalized PW FEC).\n    \
    \  c) Have the same values of all the Interface Parameters listed in\n       \
    \  Section 3.1 above with the exception of the code point in the\n         SP\
    \ field of the TDM Options parameter:\n         i) For the PW carrying TDM data\
    \ packets, the SP bits MUST be\n            set to '01'.\n        ii) For the\
    \ PW carrying the signaling packets, the SP bits MUST\n            set to '10'.\n\
    \   2. If the PWId FEC has been used:\n      a) The value of PW ID for the CESoPSN\
    \ PW carrying TDM data packets\n         MUST be even.\n      b) The value of\
    \ PW ID for the CESoPSN PW carrying CE application\n         signaling MUST be\
    \ the next (odd) value after the (even) PW ID\n         of the CESoPSN PW carrying\
    \ TDM data packets.\n   When using the Generalized PW FEC for the setup of the\
    \ two PWs, no\n   specific rules for matching the two FECs are defined.\n   Implementation-specific\
    \ mechanisms MAY be employed to verify the\n   proper matching of the TDM data\
    \ PW with its associated CE signaling\n   PW.\n   If one of the two associated\
    \ PWs has been established and the other\n   failed to be established, or for\
    \ any reason fails after having been\n   established, the established PW MUST\
    \ be torn down.\n"

    \ 5.1 and 7.2 of\n   [RFC4447], the following status codes defined in [RFC4446]\
    \ MUST be\n   used to indicate the reason of failure to establish a TDM PW:\n\

    \ modes (basic vs.\n         octet-aligned).\n      b) In the case of a mismatch\

    \ NxDS0 services with CAS.\n   2. CEP/TDM misconfiguration:\n      a) In the case\
    \ of a mismatch in the desired usage of RTP header.\n      b) In the case of a\
    \ mismatch of the desired Timestamping Clock\n         Frequency.\n      c) In\

    \ basic CESoPSN NxDS0 services extended to carry CE\n         application signaling\
    \ in separate signaling packets.\n      d) In the case of trunk-specific NxDS0\

    \      e) In the case of TDMoIP AAL1 PWs with different AAL1 modes\n         specified\
    \ by the endpoints.\n   3. The generic misconfiguration error MAY be used to indicate\
    \ any\n      setup failure not covered above.\n   In cases 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2e\
    \ above, the user MAY reconfigure the\n   endpoints and attempt to set up the\
    \ PW once again.\n   In the case of 2d, the failure is fatal.\n   Note that setting\
    \ of the Control bit (see Section 2 above) to zero\n   MUST result in an LDP status\

  contents:
  - "6.  Using the PW Status TLV\n   The TDM PW control word carries status indications\
    \ for both\n   attachment circuits (L and M fields) and the PSN (R field) indication\n\
    \   (see [RFC4553], [RFC5086], and [RFC5087]).  Similar functionality is\n   available\
    \ via use of the PW Status TLV (see Section 5.4.2 of\n   [RFC4447]).  If the latter\
    \ mechanism is employed, the signaling PE\n   sends its peer a PW Status TLV for\
    \ this PW, setting the appropriate\n   bits (see Section 3.5 of [RFC4446]):\n\
    \      o  Pseudowire Not Forwarding\n      o  Local Attachment Circuit (ingress)\
    \ Receive Fault\n      o  Local Attachment Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault\n \

    \ PW (egress) Transmit Fault\n   As long as the TDM PW interworking function is\
    \ operational, usage of\n   the Status TLV is NOT RECOMMENDED in order to avoid\
    \ contention\n   between status indications reported by the data and control plane.\n\
    \   However, if the TDM PW interworking function (IWF) itself fails while\n  \
    \ the PWE3 control plane remains operational, a Status TLV with all of\n   the\
    \ above bits set SHOULD be sent.\n"
