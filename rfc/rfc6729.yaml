  - "1.  Introduction\n   [SMTP] defines the content of email message trace fields,
    commonly\n   the \"Received\" header field.  These are typically used to record
    an\n   audit trail of the path a message follows from origin to destination,\n
    \  with one such field added each time a message moves from one host to\n   the
    next.\n   Section 3.7.2 of that document mentions that \"the most important use\n
    \  of Received: lines is for debugging mail faults [...]\".\n   There are some
    cases where there may be large time gaps between trace\n   fields.  Though this
    might be caused by transient communication\n   issues, they might also be caused
    by policy decisions or special\n   processing regarding the content of the message,
    authorization of\n   some identity on the message, or transitions between major
    software\n   components.  Common examples include message quarantines (filters\n
    \  that cause a message to be held pending further evaluation or\n   delivery
    of a message pending manual operator action), pending\n   content analysis, or
    mailing list servers that impose moderation\n   rules (mailing list owner action
    required regarding mail from authors\n   not subscribed to those lists).\n   This
    document registers a new optional clause that can be used in\n   trace fields
    to indicate that a message entered such a special\n   processing queue or state
    for some period.  This allows inspection of\n   the trace information to reveal
    that the cause for a time gap in\n   trace fields was imposed by additional processing
    rather than one\n   caused by transient technical difficulties.\n"

  title: 2.  Key Words
- contents:
  - "3.  Trace Clause\n   This specification defines a clause, called \"state\", which
    MAY be\n   used when creating a Received header field (see Section 4.4 of\n   [SMTP])
    to indicate the nature of additional handling imposed on the\n   relaying of a
    message toward its recipient(s).  It is followed by a\n   single keyword that
    provides that detail.  A Mail Transfer Agent\n   (MTA) or other handling agent
    that determines a message has entered a\n   state other than normal queuing of
    messages for relaying or delivery\n   MAY generate a trace field including one
    of these clauses.  That is,\n   the presence of this clause on a trace field is
    an indication of the\n   entry of the message into that state; a later trace field
    added would\n   indicate its departure from that state.\n   An MTA implementing
    this specification SHOULD add a Received field as\n   described whenever:\n   a.
    \ It determines that a special handling condition will occur and\n       places
    it into that condition; or\n   b.  It determines that no special handling is required
    and prepares\n       it for relay to the next handling agent.\n   An MTA need
    not add a Received field indicating preparation for\n   normal handoff to the
    next handling agent if it has already added a\n   Received field for some other
    reason.  Trace data added by the next\n   handling agent will imply the message's
    exit from the special\n   handling condition.\n   If a single MTA processes a
    message through multiple special handling\n   conditions, it MAY add a Received
    field for each distinct condition.\n   For example, presume a message will be
    injected into MTA-1, then\n   travel to MTA-3 via MTA-2, and then MTA-3 will enact
    final delivery.\n   At MTA-2, it is determined that some action will be taken
    that will\n   cause the message to undergo some handling change that is outside
    of\n   typical message flow.  In this case:\n   1.  MTA-1 adds a typical Received
    field and relays it to MTA-2.\n   2.  MTA-2 determines that the atypical handling
    will occur and adds a\n       Received field using the extension specified here.\n
    \  3.  On completion of the atypical handling, MTA-2 relays the message\n       to
    MTA-3.\n   4.  MTA-3 adds a typical Received field and enacts final delivery of\n
    \      the message.\n   Appropriate use of this mechanism does not include associating
    meta-\n   data with the message, such as categorizing the message (e.g., the\n
    \  notions of \"is spam\" or \"was 8-bit, converted to 7-bit\").  Processing\n
    \  agents also cannot reliably use this mechanism to determine anything\n   about
    the message content, since there is no guarantee that all\n   agents in the chain
    of handling made such annotations to allow\n   correct conclusions.  The sole
    purpose here is to allow one to\n   determine the point(s) in the chain of custody
    of a message at which\n   the message was subjected to handling outside of normal
    message\n   routing and queuing.\n   The following state keywords are defined
    in this document; extensions\n   may define other registered keywords (see Section
    6.2):\n   auth:  The message entered a queue pending authentication of some\n
    \     identifier in the message.\n   content:  The message entered a queue pending
    content analysis, such\n      as scanning for spam or viruses.\n   convert:  The
    message entered a queue pending content conversion.\n   moderation:  The message
    entered a hold pending mailing list\n      moderator action.\n   normal:  The
    message is not in an administrative hold and is queued\n      for or is being
    handed off to the next handling agent (which may\n      be local delivery).  This
    is the default interpretation when no\n      \"state\" clause is present.\n   other:
    \ The message entered a hold or queue for reasons not covered\n      by other
    keywords in this list and not for transient technology\n      issues.\n   outbound:
    \ The message entered a queue for outbound relaying.  This\n      is typically
    the last case added for a single host, and the next\n      Received header field
    is expected to be added by some other host.\n   quarantine:  The message entered
    a hold in an isolation queue pending\n      operator action for local policy reasons.\n
    \  timed:  The message entered a hold in order to meet a requested\n      delivery
    window, such as is defined in [FUTURERELEASE].\n   In Section 6, the \"state\"
    clause is added to the Additional-\n   Registered-Clauses IANA sub-registry.  The
    ABNF for this clause is:\n      State = CFWS \"state\" FWS queue-state-keyword
    [ \"/\" value ]\n      queue-state-keyword = ( reg-state-keyword / unreg-state-keyword
    )\n      reg-state-keyword = ( \"auth\" / \"content\" / \"convert\" /\n                            \"moderation\"
    / \"normal\" / \"other\" /\n                            \"outbound\" / \"quarantine\"
    / \"timed\" /\n                            additional-state-keyword )\n      additional-state-keyword
    = token\n                               ; MUST be registered; see\n                               ;
    \"IANA Considerations\" below\n      value = token\n      unreg-state-keyword
    = token\n   \"FWS\" and \"CFWS\" are defined in [MAIL]. \"token\" is defined in
    [MIME].\n   A transfer agent making use of this extension MAY also include header\n
    \  field comments to provide additional information.\n   The \"value\" is available
    for providing additional labels as\n   explanation for the state transition.  Examples
    could include:\n   o  convert/unicode2ascii\n   o  moderation/not-subscribed\n
    \  o  quarantine/spam\n"

  - "4.  Discussion\n   Handling agents are not expected to implement or support all
    of\n   these.  Indeed, recording trace information for all of the states\n   described
    above could make the header of a message inordinately\n   large.  Rather, an agent
    is encouraged to apply state annotations\n   when a message enters a handling
    queue where a significant condition\n   occurs or where significant additional
    processing or delay is\n   possible, and especially when a handoff has occurred
    between two\n   different, independent agents.\n   For example, an MTA receiving
    a message, doing message\n   authentication, scanning for viruses and spam, and
    then putting it in\n   an outbound queue could add four Received header fields
    denoting each\n   of these states.  However, where they are all done as part of
    a\n   single system process, in a single pass, doing so would be considered\n
    \  unusual (and extremely verbose).  This method SHOULD NOT be applied\n   except
    when doing detailed analysis of a single component to identify\n   performance
    issues with those steps.\n   Rather, an agent that wishes to make a state annotation
    SHOULD add\n   only a single Received header field including such annotation,
    thus\n   indicating (a) the time of completion of its handling of the message\n
    \  via the date portion of the field and (b) the final disposition of\n   that
    message relative to that agent.  For example, an MTA receiving a\n   message that
    performs various checks on the message before\n   immediately handing it off to
    a Mailing List Manager (MLM) would only\n   record a \"normal\" state, assuming
    it passes those checks.  The MLM\n   would then evaluate the message and record
    its own state once it\n   decides what the next step will be for the handling
    of that message.\n"
  title: 4.  Discussion
- contents:
  - "5.  Granularity\n   The degree of granularity -- and therefore the degree of
    verbosity --\n   recorded through the use of this additional trace clause is likely
    to\n   vary depending on circumstances.  It will typically be the case that\n
    \  use of this clause will be limited to \"unusual\" transitions, such as\n   when
    a message requires additional scrutiny or other processing or\n   needs to be
    quarantined.\n   Somewhat greater granularity might also include transitions of\n
    \  administrative responsibility, such as between a Mail Transfer Agent\n   (MTA)
    operator and a Mailing List Manager (MLM) operator.  This could\n   be further
    enhanced to note some transitions that are interesting\n   only when other transitions
    have occurred, such as noting entry to\n   the outbound queue only when the message
    is originating from an\n   \"interesting\" source, like an MLM, since an MLM can
    introduce\n   significant changes to the message or delivery delay and it could
    be\n   useful to know when it completed its processing, as distinct from the\n
    \  subsequent processing by the originating MTA.  In circumstances\n   needing
    very fine-grained trace information, fields might be created\n   to note all of
    these \"significant\" network architecture transitions.\n   One should note, however,
    when choosing higher levels of granularity,\n   that the Received header fields
    present on a message could be counted\n   by MTAs when trying to decide whether
    or not a message routing loop\n   is in effect.  A message with an abundance of
    these might cause an\n   incorrect determination that the message is in a delivery
    loop,\n   causing it to be removed from the mail stream.  See Section 6.3 of\n
    \  [SMTP] for further discussion.\n"
