  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a mechanism to run Bidirectional Forwarding\n\
    \   Detection (BFD) on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does\n   so\
    \ by running an independent Asynchronous mode BFD session on every\n   LAG member\
    \ link.\n   This mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,\n\
    \   either in combination with, or in absence of, Link Aggregation\n   Control\
    \ Protocol (LACP).  It provides a shorter detection time than\n   what LACP offers.\
    \  The continuity check can also cover elements of\n   Layer 3 (L3) bidirectional\
    \ forwarding.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880]\n\
    \   provides a mechanism to detect faults in the bidirectional path\n   between\
    \ two forwarding engines, including interfaces, data links, and\n   to the extent\
    \ possible the forwarding engines themselves, with\n   potentially very low latency.\
    \  The BFD protocol also provides a fast\n   mechanism for detecting communication\
    \ failures on any data links and\n   the protocol can run over any media and at\
    \ any protocol layer.\n   LAG, as defined in [IEEE802.1AX], provides mechanisms\
    \ to combine\n   multiple physical links into a single logical link.  This logical\n\
    \   link provides higher bandwidth and better resiliency, because if one\n   of\
    \ the physical member links fails, the aggregate logical link can\n   continue\
    \ to forward traffic over the remaining operational physical\n   member links.\n\
    \   Currently, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is used to\n   detect\
    \ failures on a per-physical-member link.  However, the use of\n   BFD for failure\
    \ detection would (1) provide a faster detection, (2)\n   provide detection in\
    \ the absence of LACP, and (3) would be able to\n   verify the ability for each\
    \ member link to be able to forward L3\n   packets.\n   Running a single BFD session\
    \ over the aggregation without internal\n   knowledge of the member links would\
    \ make it impossible for BFD to\n   guarantee detection of the physical member\
    \ link failures.\n   The goal is to verify link Continuity for every member link.\
    \  This\n   corresponds to [RFC5882], Section 7.3.\n   The approach taken in this\
    \ document is to run an Asynchronous mode\n   BFD session over each LAG member\
    \ link and make BFD control whether\n   the LAG member link should be part of\
    \ the L2 load-balancing table of\n   the LAG interface in the presence or the\
    \ absence of LACP.\n   This document describes how to establish an Asynchronous\
    \ mode BFD\n   session per physical LAG member link of the LAG interface.\n  \
    \ While there are native Ethernet mechanisms to detect failures\n   (802.1ax,\
    \ .3ah) that could be used for LAG, the solution defined in\n   this document\
    \ enables operators who have already deployed BFD over\n   different technologies\
    \ (e.g., IP, MPLS) to use a common failure\n   detection mechanism.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  BFD on LAG Member Links\n   The mechanism defined for a fast detection of\
    \ LAG member link failure\n   is to run Asynchronous mode BFD sessions on every\
    \ LAG member link.\n   We call these per-LAG-member-link BFD sessions \"micro-BFD\
    \ sessions\"\n   in the remainder of this document.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Micro-BFD Session Address Family
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Micro-BFD Session Address Family\n   Member link micro-BFD sessions, when\
    \ using IP/UDP encapsulation, can\n   use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Two micro-BFD\
    \ sessions MAY exist per\n   member link: one IPv4 another IPv6.  When an address\
    \ family is used\n   on one member link, then it MUST be used on all member links\
    \ of the\n   particular LAG.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Micro-BFD Session Negotiation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Micro-BFD Session Negotiation\n   A single micro-BFD session for every\
    \ enabled address family runs on\n   each member link of the LAG.  The micro-BFD\
    \ session's negotiation\n   MUST follow the same procedures defined in [RFC5880]\
    \ and [RFC5881].\n   Only Asynchronous mode BFD is considered in this document;\
    \ the use of\n   the BFD echo function is outside the scope of this document.\
    \  At\n   least one system MUST take the Active role (possibly both).  The\n \
    \  micro-BFD sessions on the member links are independent BFD sessions.\n   They\
    \ use their own unique local discriminator values, maintain their\n   own set\
    \ of state variables, and have their own independent state\n   machines.  Timer\
    \ values MAY be different, even among the micro-BFD\n   sessions belonging to\
    \ the same aggregation, although it is expected\n   that micro-BFD sessions belonging\
    \ to the same aggregation will use\n   the same timer values.\n   The demultiplexing\
    \ of a received BFD packet is solely based on the\n   Your Discriminator field,\
    \ if this field is nonzero.  For the initial\n   Down BFD packets of a BFD session,\
    \ this value MAY be zero.  In this\n   case, demultiplexing MUST be based on some\
    \ combination of other\n   fields that MUST include the interface information\
    \ of the member link\n   and the destination UDP port of the received BFD packet.\n\
    \   The procedure for the reception of BFD control packets in\n   Section 6.8.6\
    \ of [RFC5880] is amended as follows for per-LAG-member-\n   link micro-BFD sessions:\n\
    \      If the Your Discriminator field is nonzero and a micro-BFD over a\n   \
    \   LAG session is found, the interface on which the micro-BFD control\n     \
    \ packet arrived MUST correspond to the interface associated with\n      that\
    \ session.\n   This document defines the BFD control packets for each micro BFD\n\
    \   session to be IP/UDP encapsulated as defined in [RFC5881], but with a\n  \
    \ new UDP destination port 6784.\n   The new UDP port removes the ambiguity of\
    \ BFD over LAG packets from\n   BFD over single-hop IP.  An example is (mis-)configuring\
    \ a LAG with\n   micro-BFD sessions on one side but using a [RFC5881] BFD session\
    \ for\n   the LAG (treated as a single interface) on the opposite side.\n   The\
    \ procedures in this document MUST be used for BFD messages\n   addressed to port\
    \ 6784 and MUST NOT be used for others ports assigned\n   in RFCs describing other\
    \ BFD modes.\n   Control packets use a destination IP address that is configured\
    \ on\n   the peer system and can be reached via the LAG interface.\n   Implementations\
    \ may range from explicitly configuring IP addresses\n   for the BFD sessions\
    \ to out-of-band methods for learning the\n   destination IP address.  The details\
    \ are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Micro-BFD Session Ethernet Details
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Micro-BFD Session Ethernet Details\n   On Ethernet-based LAG member links,\
    \ the destination Media Access\n   Control (MAC) is the dedicated multicast MAC\
    \ address\n   01-00-5E-90-00-01 to be the immediate next hop.  This dedicated\
    \ MAC\n   address MUST be used for the initial BFD packets of a micro-BFD\n  \
    \ session when in the Down/AdminDown and Init states.  When a micro-BFD\n   session\
    \ is changing into the Up state, the first bfd.DetectMult\n   packets in the Up\
    \ state MUST be sent with the dedicated MAC.  For BFD\n   packets in the Up state\
    \ following the first bfd.DetectMult packets,\n   the source MAC address from\
    \ the received BFD packets for the session\n   MAY be used instead of the dedicated\
    \ MAC.\n   All implementations MUST be able to send and receive BFD packets in\n\
    \   Up state using the dedicated MAC address.  Implementations supporting\n  \
    \ both, sending BFD Up packets with the dedicated and the received MAC,\n   need\
    \ to offer means to control the behaviour.\n   On Ethernet-based LAG member links,\
    \ the source MAC SHOULD be the MAC\n   address of the member link transmitting\
    \ the packet.\n   This mechanism helps to reduce the use of additional MAC addresses,\n\
    \   which reduces the required resources on the Ethernet hardware on the\n   receiving\
    \ member link.\n   Micro-BFD packets SHOULD always be sent untagged.  However,\
    \ when the\n   LAG is operating in the context of IEEE 802.1q or IEEE 802.qinq,\
    \ the\n   micro-BFD packets may either be untagged or be sent with a vlan tag\n\
    \   of Zero (802.1p priority tagged).  Implementations compliant with\n   this\
    \ standard MUST be able to receive both untagged and 802.1p\n   priority tagged\
    \ micro-BFD packets.\n"
- title: 3.  Interaction between LAG and BFD
  contents:
  - "3.  Interaction between LAG and BFD\n   The micro-BFD sessions for a particular\
    \ LAG member link MUST be\n   requested when a member link state is either Distributing\
    \ or Standby.\n   The sessions MUST be deleted when the member link is in neither\n\
    \   Distributing nor Standby state anymore.\n   BFD is used to control if the\
    \ load-balancing algorithm is able to\n   select a particular LAG member link.\
    \  In other words, even when Link\n   Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is used\
    \ and considers the member\n   link to be ready to forward traffic, the member\
    \ link MUST NOT be used\n   by the load balancer until all the micro-BFD sessions\
    \ of the\n   particular member link are in Up state.\n   In case an implementation\
    \ has separate load-balancing tables for IPv4\n   and IPv6 and if both an IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 micro-BFD session exist for a\n   member link, then an implementation\
    \ MAY enable the member link in the\n   load-balancing algorithm based on the\
    \ BFD session with a matching\n   address family alone.\n   An exception is the\
    \ BFD packet itself.  Implementations MAY receive\n   and transmit BFD packets\
    \ via the Aggregator's MAC service interface,\n   independent of the session state.\n"
- title: 4.  BFD on LAG Member Links and L3 Applications
  contents:
  - "4.  BFD on LAG Member Links and L3 Applications\n   The mechanism described in\
    \ this document is likely to be used by\n   modules managing Interfaces or LAGs\
    \ and, thus, managing the member\n   links of a LAG.  Typical L3 protocols like\
    \ OSPF do not have an\n   insight into the LAG and treat it as one bigger interface.\
    \  The\n   signaling from micro sessions to L3 protocols is effectively done by\n\
    \   the impact of micro-BFD sessions on the load-balancing table and the\n   Interface/LAG\
    \ managing module's potential decision to shut down the\n   LAG.  An active method\
    \ to test the impact of micro-BFD sessions is\n   for L3 protocols to request\
    \ a single BFD session per LAG.\n"
- title: 5.  Detecting a Member Link Failure
  contents:
  - "5.  Detecting a Member Link Failure\n   When a micro-BFD session goes down, this\
    \ member link MUST be taken\n   out of the LAG load-balancing table(s).\n   In\
    \ case an implementation has separate load-balancing tables for IPv4\n   and IPv6,\
    \ then if both an IPv4 and IPv6 micro-BFD session exist for a\n   member link,\
    \ an implementation MAY remove the member link only from\n   the load-balancing\
    \ table that matches the address family of the\n   failing BFD session.  For example,\
    \ the IPv4 micro-BFD session fails\n   but the IPv6 micro-BFD session stays Up,\
    \ then the member link MAY be\n   removed from only the IPv4 load balance table;\
    \ the link MAY remain in\n   the IPv6 load-balancing table.  Alternatively, the\
    \ member link may be\n   removed from both the IPv4 and IPv6 load-balancing tables.\
    \  This\n   decision is an implementation detail.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Considerations When Using BFD on Member Links
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Considerations When Using BFD on Member Links\n   If the BFD-over-LAG\
    \ feature were provisioned on an aggregated link\n   member after the link was\
    \ already active within a LAG, BFD session\n   state should not influence the\
    \ load-balancing algorithm until the BFD\n   session state transitions to Up.\
    \  If the BFD session never\n   transitions to Up but the LAG becomes inactive,\
    \ the previously\n   documented procedures would then normally apply.\n   This\
    \ procedure ensures that the sequence of events -- enabling the\n   LAG and enabling\
    \ BFD on the LAG -- has no impact on the forwarding\n   service.\n   If the BFD-over-LAG\
    \ feature were deprovisioned on an aggregate link\n   member while the associated\
    \ micro-BFD session was in Up state, BFD\n   should transition its state to AdminDown\
    \ and should attempt to\n   communicate this state change to the peer.\n   If\
    \ the local or the remote state of a micro-BFD session is AdminDown,\n   the system\
    \ should not indicate a connectivity failure to any client\n   and should not\
    \ remove the particular LAG member link from forwarding.\n   This behaviour is\
    \ independent from the use of Link Aggregation\n   Control Protocol (LACP) for\
    \ the LAG.\n   When traffic is forwarded across a link while the corresponding\n\
    \   micro-BFD session is not in Up state, an implementation may use a\n   configurable\
    \ timeout value after which the BFD session must have\n   reached Up state otherwise\
    \ the link is taken out of forwarding.\n   When such timeout values exist, the\
    \ configuration must allow the\n   ability to turn off the timeout function.\n\
    \   The configurable timeout value shall ensure that a LAG is not\n   remaining\
    \ forever in an \"inconsistent\" state where forwarding occurs\n   on a link with\
    \ no confirmation from the micro-BFD session that the\n   link is healthy.\n \
    \  Note that if one device is not operating a micro-BFD session on a\n   link,\
    \ while the other device is and perceives the session to be Down,\n   this will\
    \ result in the two devices having a different view of the\n   status of the link.\
    \  This would likely lead to traffic loss across\n   the LAG.  The use of another\
    \ protocol to bootstrap BFD can detect\n   such mismatched config, since the side\
    \ that's not configured can send\n   a rejection error.  Such bootstrapping mechanisms\
    \ are outside the\n   scope of this document.\n"
