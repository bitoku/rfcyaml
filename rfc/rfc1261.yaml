  - "Discussion\n   The transition of the Network Information Center from SRI\n  \
    \ International in Menlo Park, CA, to Government Systems Inc. in\n   Chantilly,\
    \ VA, is officially scheduled for 1 October 1991.  This\n   includes the transition\
    \ of services currently offered to DDN and\n   Internet users by SRI.  These services\
    \ include network/user\n   registration (i.e., network number and top level domain\
    \ name\n   assignment), on-line information services, and Help Desk operations.\n\
    \   GSI will also continue RFC and Internet-Draft archive and\n   distribution\
    \ services.\n   SRI will continue to provide all NIC services and respond to all\
    \ user\n   calls and requests until 30 September 1991.\n   Defense Information\
    \ System Agency (DISA) and GSI will make every\n   effort to ensure a smooth and\
    \ timely transition of NIC services from\n   SRI.  Network users should be minimally\
    \ impacted.  With a few minor\n   exceptions, all on-line services currently offered\
    \ by SRI will appear\n   the same to the user when a connection is established\
    \ to the new\n   (GSI) NIC host.  These exceptions are due to the change from\
    \ the\n   TOPS20 operating system to the SunOS operating system.  The new NIC\n\
    \   host is a Sun 470 SPARCserver running SunOS 4.1.  All users on the\n   DDN\
    \ and the Internet should carefully note the following changes:\n   U.S. Postal\
    \ Address:      Government Systems, Inc.\n                             Attn: Network\
    \ Information Center\n                             14200 Park Meadow Drive\n \
    \                            Suite 200\n                             Chantilly,\
    \ VA  22021\n   Help Desk Telephone Numbers:\n                             1-800-365-3642\
    \ (1-800-365-DNIC)\n                             1-703-802-4535\n   Help Desk\
    \ Hours of Operation:\n                             7:00 am to 7:00 pm Eastern\
    \ Time\n   Fax Number:               1-703-802-8376\n   Network Address:     \
    \     192.112.36.5 (NIC.DDN.MIL)\n   Root Domain Server:       192.112.36.4 (NS.NIC.DDN.MIL)\n\
    \   During the period of 26 to 30 September 1991 the ID (WHOIS) database\n   will\
    \ not be changed.  All registration actions for this five day\n   period will\
    \ be suspended.  This action is necessary in order to\n   transfer the master\
    \ database to GSI.  Starting 26 September 1991, all\n   U.S. mail and fax requests\
    \ should be directed to the GSI address and\n   fax number shown above.  All electronic\
    \ mail requests should continue\n   to be directed to the \"HOSTMASTER\" and \"\
    REGISTRAR\" mailboxes at\n   NIC.DDN.MIL.  As appropriate, SRI will redirect electronic\
    \ mail to\n   GSI.  On 1 October 1991 all registration activities will resume.\n\
    \   We hope that the transition and its accompanying changes will not\n   greatly\
    \ inconvenience network users, and we thank you in advance for\n   your patience\
    \ and understanding.  For general questions regarding the\n   transition, users\
    \ may call the new NIC Help Desk after September 1,\n   1991 at 1-800-365-3642/703-802-4535\
    \ or send an e-mail message to\n   nic@diis.ddn.mil.\n"
