- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   On February 29, 1988, an Ad Hoc Network Management Review Group\
    \ was\n   convened to consider the state of network management technology for\n\
    \   the Internet and to make recommendations to the Internet Activities\n   Board\
    \ as to network management policy.  The outcome of that meeting\n   was summarized\
    \ in RFC 1052 and essentially established a framework in\n   which two network\
    \ management protocols now known respectively as\n   Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) and Common Management\n   Information Protocol on TCP (CMOT)\
    \ were selected for further work.\n   Subsequently, both SNMP [6] and CMOT [5]\
    \ were advanced to Draft-\n   Standard/Recommended status for use in the Internet\
    \ [SNMP: RFC 1098,\n   CMOT: RFC 1095].\n   Simultaneously, it was agreed to establish\
    \ a working group to\n   coordinate the definition and specification of managed\
    \ objects to be\n   used in common with either protocol.  In addition, it was\
    \ agreed to\n   use the then current ISO Structure of Management Information (SMI)\n\
    \   specification as a reference standard to guide the naming and\n   abstraction\
    \ conventions that would be followed in constructing the\n   common Internet Management\
    \ Information Base (MIB).  The Internet\n   versions of SMI and MIB were specified\
    \ in RFC 1065 [2] and RFC 1066\n   [3] respectively.\n   In the intervening fifteen\
    \ months, considerable progress has been\n   made in the specification of a common\
    \ Management Information Base and\n   in the implementation, deployment and use\
    \ of network management tools\n   in the Internet.\n   The current public subtree\
    \ of the Internet MIB contains roughly 100\n   variables (i.e., managed objects)\
    \ agreed by the SNMP and CMOT working\n   groups as mandatory for Internet network\
    \ management.  The June 12,\n   1989 meeting which this document reports was convened\
    \ to review the\n   progress to date, to determine whether actions were needed\
    \ to foster\n   further evolution of network management tools and to recommend\n\
    \   specific actions in this area to the IAB.\n"
- title: SNMP STATUS
  contents:
  - "SNMP STATUS\n   Immediately after the meeting reported in RFC 1052, a group was\n\
    \   convened to make extensions and changes to the predecessor to SNMP:\n   Simple\
    \ Gateway Monitoring Protocol.  A \"connectathon\" was held at\n   NYSERNet, an\
    \ RFC published, and demonstrations of network management\n   tools using SNMP\
    \ were offered in the Fall at Interop 88 [a conference\n   and show presented\
    \ by Advanced Computing Environments (ACE)].  The\n   protocol is in use in a\
    \ number of networks within the Internet as\n   well as in private packet networks\
    \ internationally.  A number of\n   vendor implementations are in the field (e.g.,\
    \ cisco Systems,\n   Proteon, The Wollongong Group), vendor independent reference\n\
    \   implementations (e.g., NYSERNet, Case and Key in Tennessee) along\n   with\
    \ some freely available versions (e.g., MIT, CMU).\n   It is important to note\
    \ that while the common Internet Management\n   Information Base has roughly 100\
    \ variables, a typical SNMP monitoring\n   system may support anywhere from 100\
    \ to 200 ADDITIONAL objects which\n   have been defined in private or experimental\
    \ MIB space.  Many of\n   these are device or protocol dependent variables.\n\
    \   Scaling to include larger numbers of monitored objects and subsystems\n  \
    \ remains a challenge.  It was observed that fault monitoring was\n   easier to\
    \ scale than performance and configuration monitoring, since\n   the former may\
    \ operate on an exception basis while the latter is more\n   likely to require\
    \ periodic reporting.\n"
- title: CMOT STATUS
  contents:
  - "CMOT STATUS\n   RFC 1095 (CMOT) was recently published and built upon experience\n\
    \   gained earlier with prototype implementations demonstrated at Interop\n  \
    \ 88 in the Fall of that year.  The present specification for CMOT is\n   based\
    \ on the ISO Draft International Standard version of Common\n   Management Information\
    \ Protocol (CMIP).  The CMIP is being moved to\n   International Standard status,\
    \ though the precise timing is not\n   perfectly clear.  It will happen late in\
    \ 1989 or perhaps in the first\n   quarter of 1990.  Some changes will be made\
    \ to correct known errors\n   and the CMIP document itself will probably be restructured.\n\
    \   During this discussion, it was pointed out that there is much to\n   network\
    \ management which is not addressed by either the CMOT or the\n   SNMP specifications:\
    \ for example, down loading of software,\n   configuration management and user\
    \ access control.  Authentication of\n   the source of network management commands\
    \ and responses is another\n   area important to providers and users of network\
    \ management tools.\n   The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\
    \ is\n   sponsoring the development of implementors' agreements on the\n   functional\
    \ behavior of network management tools including, inter\n   alia, logging, event\
    \ reporting, error reporting, structured object\n   management, and alarm reporting.\n\
    \   Although at the time of the meeting, there were no publicly available\n  \
    \ implementations of CMOT reported, developments were reportedly\n   planned by\
    \ a number of vendors both in the form of agents and network\n   management tools.\
    \  The University of Wisconsin plans to demonstrate\n   CMOT using the ISODE software\
    \ at Interop 89 [(tm) ACE] in September\n   1989.\n"
- title: MIB AND SMI STATUS
  contents:
  - "MIB AND SMI STATUS\n   In the Fall of 1988, two RFCs were published (1065 and\
    \ 1066) to\n   specify the Structure of Management Information (SMI) and the initial\n\
    \   Internet Management Information Base (MIB) respectively.  There were\n   some\
    \ challenges in crafting this set of commonly agreed variables; in\n   the end,\
    \ roughly 100 were agreed and defined as mandatory for\n   Internet management.\n\
    \   It was recognized in this process that the definition of the layer\n   BELOW\
    \ IP was a difficult task.  IP is sufficiently simple and general\n   that it\
    \ has been moved in encapsulated form over many media including\n   the MAC level\
    \ of various local nets, X.25 packet level, serial line\n   protocols, multiplexors,\
    \ tunnels and, it is rumored, tin cans and\n   string.\n   At the Transport level,\
    \ specifically for TCP, it was observed that\n   information about the transient\
    \ status of connections was potentially\n   inaccessible to the network management\
    \ tools since the loss of a TCP\n   connection typically meant loss of its Transmission\
    \ Control Block\n   (status block) just when you wanted to look back into the\
    \ history of\n   its state.  Countervailing this observation was evidence that\
    \ looking\n   at TCBs with network management tools yielded far more insight into\n\
    \   the transient behavior of TCP than looking at aggregated network\n   statistics.\n\
    \   It was clear from the discussion that there is strong interest in\n   extending\
    \ the variables accessible via network management tools.\n   Adding new devices,\
    \ new higher level protocols and the ability to\n   manipulate configuration information\
    \ were high on the list of\n   desirable extensions, although several participants\
    \ felt that this\n   desire needed some moderation.\n   A vital, but unsettled\
    \ research area has to do with relationships\n   among groups of monitored variables.\
    \  A particular implementation may\n   have IP operating atop X.25.  The problem\
    \ is to be able to make\n   queries about the condition of monitored variables\
    \ so that those for\n   the IP level can be correlated with those for a lower\
    \ layer, for\n   instance.  This notion of relationship is especially important\
    \ as\n   network devices (including hosts) begin to sport multiple network\n \
    \  connections and multiple protocol suites operating in parallel.  Just\n   how\
    \ the dynamics of such relationships are to be specified, defined\n   and instantiated\
    \ is the research question.  What sort of SMI is\n   appropriate? What generic\
    \ structure is needed for the management\n   objects?\n   Another difficult topic\
    \ has to do with version numbers for SMI.  The\n   issue is \"which version of\
    \ MIB is instantiated in this monitored\n   system?\"  As consideration of extensions\
    \ to the currently agreed SMI\n   were contemplated during the last fifteen months,\
    \ it became apparent\n   that the question of versions was central.\n   Not far\
    \ behind was the question of functionality of the underlying\n   support protocols\
    \ (SNMP and CMOT).  The RFC 1052 recommendation was\n   to tightly link the MIB/SMI,\
    \ keeping only one such definition for\n   both protocols.  In theory, this plan\
    \ would make it easier to move\n   from one protocol base to another.  In practice,\
    \ it appears to have\n   stifled exploration of new variable and function definitions\
    \ in\n   operating network environments.  This point needs to be underscored:\n\
    \   it is essential for the Internet community to have the freedom to\n   explore\
    \ the utility of the OSI offerings while, at the same time,\n   having the freedom\
    \ to respond to operational needs through the\n   definition and use of new MIB\
    \ variables and SMI features.\n   Yet another area still needing development has\
    \ to do with the\n   archiving of operational data collected by means of a network\n\
    \   management tool.  The ISO Common Management Information Service\n   (CMIS)\
    \ specifications do not treat this matter.\n   Finally, it was pointed out that\
    \ registration of managed objects and\n   their definitions was still an open\
    \ area although the NIST has\n   apparently made progress through its Network\
    \ Management Special\n   Interest Group (NMSIG) in planning for cataloging of\
    \ defined\n   management information objects.\n"
- title: APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)
  contents:
  - "APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API)\n   It was generally agreed that the\
    \ actual network management tools\n   available to operators, rather than the\
    \ specifics of the protocols\n   supporting the tools, would be the determining\
    \ factor in the\n   effectiveness of any Internet network management system. \
    \ A brief\n   report was offered and discussion ensued on the possibility of\n\
    \   creating a common application programming interface that could be\n   used\
    \ independent of the specific protocol (CMOT, SNMP, CMIP or\n   proprietary) used\
    \ to transport queries and commands.\n   It was acknowledged that the present\
    \ service interfaces of both SNMP\n   and CMIS have limitations (e.g., neither\
    \ has any sense of time other\n   than \"now\"; this makes it impossible to express\
    \ queries for\n   historical information, or to issue command requests of the\
    \ form: Do\n   X at device Y, beginning in 30 minutes).  These limitations hinder\n\
    \   both SNMP and CMOT from directly offering a comprehensive API for\n   network\
    \ management applications.\n   Although some positive sentiment was expressed\
    \ for defining a kind of\n   \"super SMI\" metalanguage to aid in the the definition\
    \ of a general\n   API, it was not clear whether the current crop of supporting\n\
    \   protocols had sufficient semantic commonality to be used in this way.\n  \
    \ The matter remains open for investigation.\n"
- title: NIST ACTIVITIES
  contents:
  - "NIST ACTIVITIES\n   The Ad Hoc Review had the benefit of representatives from\
    \ NIST who\n   are active in the network management area.  It was reported that\
    \ the\n   major focus at present is at layers 3 and 4 where objects are being\n\
    \   defined in accordance with \"templates\" provided by ISO's SC21.  IEEE\n \
    \  802 is also pursuing the definition of MIB objects, though not with\n   the\
    \ benefit of the same templates now in use by the NIST NMSIG.  The\n   layers\
    \ above transport are just beginning to receive attention.\n   It was observed\
    \ that the Internet SMI is not quite a subset of the\n   ISO CMIS SMI.  The Internet\
    \ variable naming conventions are a little\n   different and some functionality\
    \ may vary.  There was some\n   uncertainty about the treatment of gauges in the\
    \ Internet SMI and the\n   corresponding OSI SMI.  [L. Steinberg reported, subsequent\
    \ to the\n   meeting, that gauges latch and counters roll over in the OSI SMI,\
    \ as\n   they appear to do in the Internet SMI - VGC].\n   The general sense of\
    \ this portion of the discussion was that a\n   considerable amount of activity\
    \ is underway with the sponsorship of\n   NIST and that this work is relevant\
    \ to the Internet community,\n   particularly as the time approaches in which\
    \ coexistence of the OSI\n   protocol suite with the existing Internet protocols\
    \ is the norm.\n"
- title: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
  contents:
  - "CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n   The assembled attendees came to the conclusions\
    \ enumerated below and\n   recommends to the IAB that actions be taken which are\
    \ consistent with\n   these conclusions:\n      1. The Internet will exist in\
    \ a pluralistic protocol stack\n         environment and the need to coexist will\
    \ persist.\n      2. Expansion of the common MIB has been impeded by an inability\
    \ to\n         agree on a common, extended SMI.\n      3. The Internet community\
    \ must not ignore the work of other groups\n         in the network management\
    \ area, while at the same time, coping\n         with the current operational\
    \ needs of the Internet (and\n         internet) communities.\n      4. Until\
    \ we can gain operational experience with OSI network\n         management tools\
    \ (e.g., with CMIP on TCP or on OSI), we cannot\n         specify a plan for coexistence\
    \ with and transition to use of\n         the OSI-based protocols in the Internet.\n\
    \   Therefore:\n      (a) We want to foster an environment for real CMOT/CMIP\
    \ use.\n      (b) We should take action as needed to extend SNMP for operational\n\
    \          reasons.\n      (c) We must preserve the utility of the first agreed\
    \ common MIB\n          (RFC 1066).\n      (d) We should develop, separately,\
    \ experimental and enterprise MIB\n          variables and seek opportunity for\
    \ placing these in the common\n          MIB.\n      (e) In a coexisting environment,\
    \ we will need to access the same\n          set of variables (e.g., in a given\
    \ gateway or router) by means\n          of more than one protocol (e.g., SNMP,\
    \ CMIP/TCP, CMIP/CLNP,\n          etc.).\n   It is recommended to the IAB that\
    \ the network management efforts\n   using SNMP and CMOT be allowed independently\
    \ to explore new variables\n   and potentially non-overlapping SMI definitions\
    \ for the next 12\n   months so as to foster operational deployment and experience\
    \ with\n   these network management tools.  In essence, it is recommended that\n\
    \   the binding of SNMP and CMOT to a common MIB/SMI be relaxed for this\n   period\
    \ of exploration.  Variables which are NOT supportable in common\n   by both protocols\
    \ should be defined in the experimental or private\n   parts of the MIB definition\
    \ space.  Obviously, care should be taken\n   to achieve agreement within each\
    \ respective working group on any\n   variables added to the distinct SNMP and\
    \ CMOT experimental spaces.\n   Specifically, the CMOT working group should extend\
    \ its MIB and SMI\n   definitions in the direction of the OSI/NIST specifications\
    \ so as to\n   bring CMOT into closer alignment with the OSI CMIS design.\n  \
    \ During this period of experimentation, it is strongly recommended\n   that the\
    \ IAB seek opportunities to encourage the introduction of\n   Internet elements\
    \ which use the OSI protocols into the Internet\n   environment.  Such OSI-based\
    \ elements offer an opportunity to obtain\n   operational experience with monitoring\
    \ and management support by way\n   of the CMIP and CMOT protocols.  It is anticipated\
    \ that network\n   management systems based on the OSI Common Management Information\n\
    \   Service (CMIS) will be developed which use CMIP or CMOT, as\n   appropriate,\
    \ to manage various elements in the Internet.\n   It is also recommended that\
    \ the IAB engage in an active liaison\n   effort with the NIST, focusing especially\
    \ on the question of\n   coexistence of the Internet protocols with OSI protocols.\
    \  If at all\n   possible, joint experimental or test-bed efforts should be initiated\n\
    \   to identify means for supporting this coexistence.\n   As necessary, the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force should be directed\n   to restructure its network management\
    \ efforts both to support the\n   need for MIB/SMI exploration by the SNMP and\
    \ CMOT groups and to\n   strengthen links between the IETF efforts and those of\
    \ NIST.\n   Finally, it is recommended that the Ad Hoc Review Group be reconvened\n\
    \   at 6 month intervals to review status and to determine whether\n   opportunities\
    \ for expanding the common MIB/SMI are available.\n"
