  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new attribute for the Telephony Routing\
    \ over\n   IP (TRIP) protocol.  The attribute associates protocols/services in\n\
    \   the PSTN offering authorized prioritization during call setup that\n   are\
    \ reachable through a TRIP gateway.  Current examples of\n   preferential service\
    \ in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)\n   are Government Emergency\
    \ Telecommunications Service (GETS) in the\n   U.S. and Government Telephone Preference\
    \ Scheme (GTPS) in the U.K.\n   The proposed attribute for TRIP is based on the\
    \ NameSpace.Value tuple\n   defined for the SIP Resource-Priority field.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An IP telephony gateway allows nodes on an IP-based network\
    \ to\n   communicate with other entities on the circuit switched telephone\n \
    \  network.  The Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol [rfc3219]\n   provides\
    \ a way for nodes on the IP network to locate a suitable\n   gateway through the\
    \ use of Location Servers.  TRIP is a policy-\n   driven, inter-administrative\
    \ domain protocol for advertising the\n   reachability, negotiating the capabilities,\
    \ and specifying the\n   attributes of these gateways.\n   The TRIP protocol is\
    \ modeled after BGP-4 [rfc4271] and uses path-\n   vector advertisements distributed\
    \ in a hop-by-hop manner (resembling\n   a Bellman-Ford routing algorithm) via\
    \ Location Servers.  These\n   Location Servers are grouped in administrative\
    \ clusters known as\n   Internet Telephony Administrative Domains (ITADs).  A\
    \ more extensive\n   framework discussion on TRIP can be found in [rfc2871].\n\
    \   This document defines a new attribute that has been registered with\n   IANA.\
    \  The purpose of this new attribute, and the rationale behind\n   its specification,\
    \ is explained in the following sections.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [rfc2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Emergency Telecommunications Service
  contents:
  - "2.  Emergency Telecommunications Service\n   Emergency Telecommunications Service\
    \ is a broad term that refers to\n   the services provided by systems used to\
    \ support emergency\n   communications.  One example of these systems is the U.S.\
    \ Government\n   Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS).  This system currently\n\
    \   operates over the U.S. Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) as a\n   pay-per-use\
    \ system by authorized personnel.  It uses the T1.631-1993\n   ANSI standard [ANSI]\
    \ to signal the presence of the National Security\n   / Emergency Preparedness\
    \ (NS/EP) codepoint in an ISDN User Part\n   (ISUP) Initial Address Message (IAM)\
    \ for Signaling System No. 7\n   (SS7).  A key aspect of GETS is that a signaling\
    \ standard in the U.S.\n   PSTN is used to convey the activation/request of the\
    \ GETS service.\n   From a protocol perspective, other examples of priority (and\
    \ which\n   can be argued as emergency/disaster related) standards are the\n \
    \  H.460.4 ITU [itu460] standard on Call Priority designation for H.323\n   calls,\
    \ and the I.255.3 [itu255] ITU standard on Multi-Level\n   Precedence and Preemption\
    \ Service.  The latter has been integrated\n   into private telephony systems\
    \ like AUTOVON.  In both cases,\n   signaling codepoints exist to distinguish\
    \ telephony calls by\n   authenticated and prioritized end-user from the normal\
    \ end-user.  The\n   form of this distinction varies and is outside the scope\
    \ of this\n   document.  [rfc3689] and [rfc3690] provide additional information\
    \ on\n   ETS and its requirements.\n"
- title: 3.  SIP Resource-Priority Effort
  contents:
  - "3.  SIP Resource-Priority Effort\n   The initial discussions in the IEPREP working\
    \ group list, along with\n   the presentation at the Adelaide IETF [ADEL00], led\
    \ to strawman\n   requirements to augment SIP to have the ability to prioritize\
    \ call\n   signaling.  This effort was then advanced formally in the SIPPING\n\
    \   working group so that SIP would be able to prioritize access to\n   circuit-switched\
    \ networks, end systems, and proxy resources for\n   emergency preparedness communication\
    \ [rfc3487].\n   The requirements in [rfc3487] produced the corresponding document\n\
    \   [rfc4412] in the SIP working group, which defines a new header for\n   SIP\
    \ called Resource-Priority.  This new header, which is optional, is\n   divided\
    \ into two parts: a NameSpace and a Value.  The NameSpace part\n   uniquely identifies\
    \ a group of one or more priorities.  The Value\n   part identifies one of a set\
    \ of priorities used for a SIP message.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Benefits
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Benefits\n   There are three basic benefits derived from the addition of\
    \ the\n   Resource Priority header in SIP.  The first is an ability to signal\n\
    \   the priority within a SIP message to other entities in an IP network.\n  \
    \ The caveat is that some entities may not recognize/support the\n   priority\
    \ or namespace, but at least the ability to signal the\n   priority with respect\
    \ to resources has been specified in the SIP\n   protocol.\n   The second benefit\
    \ is that telephony-related protocol/codepoints from\n   other standards can have\
    \ a corresponding mapping to SIP NameSpace and\n   Value tokens in the Resource-Priority\
    \ header.  Hence, the current\n   NS/EP codepoint in ANSI standard T1.631-1993\
    \ could have a\n   corresponding NameSpace.Value token set for the IETF standards\
    \ body.\n   And as a result, this mapping would facilitate the transparent\n \
    \  bridging of signals (i.e., codepoints) between standards defined by\n   various\
    \ organizations -- be they private or public.\n   The third benefit of the Resource-Priority\
    \ header, and its definition\n   of alphanumeric tokens, is that it is highly\
    \ versatile.  The\n   NameSpace allows for a wide set of priorities to be defined\
    \ and\n   updated, if the need arises, by simply defining a new NameSpace\n  \
    \ token.  Hence, there is no reliance on a single set of priorities\n   applied\
    \ for all cases.\n"
- title: 3.2  Issue
  contents:
  - "3.2  Issue\n   Having defined a means of signaling priority through gateways,\
    \ the\n   follow-on question arises of how does one determine which gateways\n\
    \   support a given NameSpace.  The dissemination of this type of\n   information\
    \ is within the scope of TRIP.  However, the current\n   specification of TRIP\
    \ does not include a component that advertises\n   associations of gateways with\
    \ specific NameSpaces.  To address this\n   omission, the following section defines\
    \ a new TRIP attribute that\n   associates one or more NameSpaces with a gateway.\n"
- title: '4.  New Attribute: ResourcePriority'
  contents:
  - "4.  New Attribute: ResourcePriority\n   This section provides details on the\
    \ syntax and semantics of the\n   ResourcePriority TRIP attribute.  Its presentation\
    \ reflects the form\n   of existing attributes presented in Section 5 of [rfc3219].\n\
    \   Attribute Flags are set to the following:\n      Conditional Mandatory: False\n\
    \      Required Flags: Not Well-Known, Independent Transitive\n      Potential\
    \ Flags: None\n      TRIP Type Code: 12\n   There are no dependencies on other\
    \ attributes, thus Conditional\n   Mandatory is set to \"False\".\n   Since the\
    \ Resource-Priority field in SIP, with its corresponding\n   NameSpace token,\
    \ is optional, the ResourcePriority attribute in TRIP\n   is also optional.  Hence,\
    \ it is set to \"Not Well-Known\".\n   The Independent Transitive condition indicates\
    \ that the attribute is\n   to be forwarded amongst all ITADs.  The Location Server\
    \ that does not\n   recognize the attribute sets the Partial flag as well.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Syntax of ResourcePriority
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Syntax of ResourcePriority\n   The ResourcePriority attribute contains\
    \ one or more NameSpace token\n   identifiers.  An initial set of identifiers\
    \ is defined in [rfc4412],\n   with subsequent identifiers to be found in the\
    \ IANA registry.  The\n   syntax of the ResourcePriority attribute is copied from\
    \ the\n   \"namespace\" token syntax from [rfc4412], which in turn imported\n\
    \   \"alphanum\" from [rfc3261], and is an alphanumeric value as shown\n   below:\n\
    \   namespace = 1*( alphanum / \"-\" / \"!\" / \"%\" / \"*\" / \"_\" / \"+\"\n\
    \                   / \"`\" / \"'\" / \"~\" )\n   Note that an augmented version\
    \ of Backus-Naur Form is found in\n   [rfc4234].\n   Since NameSpaces are arbitrary\
    \ in length, each tuple consists of a\n   Length value with a NameSpace value\
    \ as shown in the figure below.\n   There is no padding between tuples.\n    0\
    \                   1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5\
    \ 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +---------------+---------------+--------------+----------------+\n\
    \   |        NameSpace Length       |   NameSpace Value (variable)  |\n   +---------------+---------------+--------------+----------------+\n\
    \   It is important to note that the priority (i.e., \"r-priority\" token\n  \
    \ syntax) from [rfc4412] is NOT used in the ResourcePriority attribute.\n   This\
    \ is because the objective of the attribute is to advertise the\n   NameSpace\
    \ associated with a gateway and not the individual priorities\n   within that\
    \ NameSpace.\n"
- title: 4.2  Additional TRIP Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2  Additional TRIP Considerations\n   Section 5.12 of TRIP lists a number of\
    \ considerations that should be\n   addressed when defining new attributes.  The\
    \ first three\n   considerations (use of the attribute, its flags, and syntax)\
    \ have\n   been discussed above in this section.  The final three considerations\n\
    \   are the following.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Route Origination
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Route Origination\n   The ResourcePriority attribute is not well-known.\
    \  If a route has a\n   ResourcePriority attribute associated with it, the Location\
    \ Server\n   (LS) MUST include that attribute in the advertisement it originates.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Route Aggregation
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Route Aggregation\n   Routes with differing ResourcePriority token values\
    \ MUST NOT be\n   aggregated.  Routes with the same token values in the\n   ResourcePriority\
    \ attribute MAY be aggregated and the same\n   ResourcePriority attribute attached\
    \ to the aggregated object.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Route Dissemination and Attribute Scope
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Route Dissemination and Attribute Scope\n   An LS MUST include the ResourcePriority\
    \ attribute when communicating\n   with peer LSs within its own domain.\n   If\
    \ received from a peer LS in another domain, an LS MUST propagate\n   the ResourcePriority\
    \ attribute to other LSs within its domain.\n   An LS MAY add the ResourcePriority\
    \ attribute when propagating routing\n   objects to an LS in another domain. \
    \ The inclusion of the\n   ResourcePriority attribute is a matter of local administrative\n\
    \   policy.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The document defines a new attribute for the\
    \ TRIP protocol and has no\n   direct security considerations applied to it. \
    \ However, the security\n   considerations for TRIP and its messages remain the\
    \ same and are\n   articulated in Section 14 of [rfc3219].\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
