  - "1.1  BACKGROUND\n   A public-key certificate (hereinafter \"certificate\") binds\
    \ a public-\n   key value to a set of information that identifies the entity (such\
    \ as\n   person, organization, account, or site) associated with use of the\n\
    \   corresponding private key (this entity is known as the \"subject\" of\n  \
    \ the certificate).  A certificate is used by a \"certificate user\" or\n   \"\
    relying party\" that needs to use, and rely upon the accuracy of, the\n   public\
    \ key distributed via that certificate (a certificate user is\n   typically an\
    \ entity that is verifying a digital signature from the\n   certificate's subject\
    \ or an entity sending encrypted data to the\n   subject).  The degree to which\
    \ a certificate user can trust the\n   binding embodied in a certificate depends\
    \ on several factors. These\n   factors include the practices followed by the\
    \ certification authority\n   (CA) in authenticating the subject; the CA's operating\
    \ policy,\n   procedures, and security controls; the subject's obligations (for\n\
    \   example, in protecting the private key); and the stated undertakings\n   and\
    \ legal obligations of the CA (for example, warranties and\n   limitations on\
    \ liability).\n   A Version 3 X.509 certificate may contain a field declaring\
    \ that one\n   or more specific certificate policies applies to that certificate\n\
    \   [ISO1].  According to X.509, a certificate policy is \"a named set of\n  \
    \ rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a\n   particular\
    \ community and/or class of application with common security\n   requirements.\"\
    \ A certificate policy may be used by a certificate user\n   to help in deciding\
    \ whether a certificate, and the binding therein,\n   is sufficiently trustworthy\
    \ for a particular application.  The\n   certificate policy concept is an outgrowth\
    \ of the policy statement\n   concept developed for Internet Privacy Enhanced\
    \ Mail [PEM1] and\n   expanded upon in [BAU1].\n   A more detailed description\
    \ of the practices followed by a CA in\n   issuing and otherwise managing certificates\
    \ may be contained in a\n   certification practice statement (CPS) published by\
    \ or referenced by\n   the CA.  According to the American Bar Association Digital\
    \ Signature\n   Guidelines (hereinafter \"ABA Guidelines\"), \"a CPS is a statement\
    \ of\n   the practices which a certification authority employs in issuing\n  \
    \ certificates.\" [ABA1]\n"
- title: 1.2  PURPOSE
  contents:
  - "1.2  PURPOSE\n   The purpose of this document is to establish a clear relationship\n\
    \   between certificate policies and CPSs, and to present a framework to\n   assist\
    \ the writers of certificate policies or CPSs with their tasks.\n   In particular,\
    \ the framework identifies the elements that may need to\n   be considered in\
    \ formulating a certificate policy or a CPS.  The\n   purpose is not to define\
    \ particular certificate policies or CPSs, per\n   se.\n"
- title: 1.3  SCOPE
  contents:
  - "1.3  SCOPE\n   The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the contents\n\
    \   of a certificate policy (as defined in X.509) or CPS (as defined in\n   the\
    \ ABA Guidelines).  In particular, this document describes the\n   types of information\
    \ that should be considered for inclusion in a\n   certificate policy definition\
    \ or a CPS.  While the framework as\n   presented generally assumes use of the\
    \ X.509 version 3 certificate\n   format, it is not intended that the material\
    \ be restricted to use of\n   that certificate format.  Rather, it is intended\
    \ that this framework\n   be adaptable to other certificate formats that may come\
    \ into use.\n   The scope does not extend to defining security policies generally\n\
    \   (such as organization security policy, system security policy, or\n   data\
    \ labeling policy) beyond the policy elements that are considered\n   of particular\
    \ relevance to certificate policies or CPSs.\n   This document does not define\
    \ a specific certificate policy or CPS.\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar\
    \ with the general concepts\n   of digital signatures, certificates, and public-key\
    \ infrastructure,\n   as used in X.509 and the ABA Guidelines.\n"

  - "2.  DEFINITIONS\n   This document makes use of the following defined terms:\n\
    \      Activation data - Data values, other than keys, that are required\n   \
    \   to operate cryptographic modules and that need to be protected\n      (e.g.,\

    \ policy - A named set of rules that indicates the\n      applicability of a certificate\
    \ to a particular community and/or\n      class of application with common security\
    \ requirements.  For\n      example, a particular certificate policy might indicate\n\

    \      can be processed to obtain that of the final object in the path.\n    \
    \  Certification Practice Statement (CPS) - A statement of the\n      practices\
    \ which a certification authority employs in issuing\n      certificates.\n  \
    \    Issuing certification authority (issuing CA) - In the context of a\n    \
    \  particular certificate, the issuing CA is the CA that issued the\n      certificate\
    \ (see also Subject certification authority).\n      Policy qualifier - Policy-dependent\
    \ information that accompanies a\n      certificate policy identifier in an X.509\

    \      that does not sign or issue certificates (i.e., an RA is delegated\n  \
    \    certain tasks on behalf of a CA).  [Note: The term Local\n      Registration\
    \ Authority (LRA) is used elsewhere for the same\n      concept.]\n      Relying\
    \ party - A recipient of a certificate who acts in reliance\n      on that certificate\
    \ and/or digital signatures verified using that\n      certificate.  In this document,\
    \ the terms \"certificate user\" and\n      \"relying party\" are used interchangeably.\n\
    \      Set of provisions - A collection of practice and/or policy\n      statements,\

    \ policy definition or CPS employing the\n      approach described in this framework.\n\
    \      Subject certification authority (subject CA) - In the context of a\n  \
    \    particular CA-certificate, the subject CA is the CA whose public\n      key\
    \ is certified in the certificate (see also Issuing\n      certification authority).\n"

    \ adaptable to other certificate formats that may\n   come into use.\n"
- title: 3.1  CERTIFICATE POLICY
  contents:
  - "3.1  CERTIFICATE POLICY\n   When a certification authority issues a certificate,\
    \ it is providing\n   a statement to a certificate user (i.e., a relying party)\
    \ that a\n   particular public key is bound to a particular entity (the\n   certificate\
    \ subject).  However, the extent to which the certificate\n   user should rely\
    \ on that statement by the CA needs to be assessed by\n   the certificate user.\
    \  Different certificates are issued following\n   different practices and procedures,\
    \ and may be suitable for different\n   applications and/or purposes.\n   The\
    \ X.509 standard defines a certificate policy as \"a named set of\n   rules that\
    \ indicates the applicability of a certificate to a\n   particular community and/or\
    \ class of application with common security\n   requirements\"[ISO1].  An X.509\
    \ Version 3 certificate may contain an\n   indication of certificate policy, which\
    \ may be used by a certificate\n   user to decide whether or not to trust a certificate\
    \ for a particular\n   purpose.\n   A certificate policy, which needs to be recognized\
    \ by both the issuer\n   and user of a certificate, is represented in a certificate\
    \ by a\n   unique, registered Object Identifier.  The registration process\n \
    \  follows the procedures specified in ISO/IEC and ITU standards.  The\n   party\
    \ that registers the Object Identifier also publishes a textual\n   specification\
    \ of the certificate policy, for examination by\n   certificate users.  Any one\
    \ certificate will typically declare a\n   single certificate policy or, possibly,\
    \ be issued consistent with a\n   small number of different policies.\n   Certificate\
    \ policies also constitute a basis for accreditation of\n   CAs.  Each CA is accredited\
    \ against one or more certificate policies\n   which it is recognized as implementing.\
    \  When one CA issues a CA-\n   certificate for another CA, the issuing CA must\
    \ assess the set of\n   certificate policies for which it trusts the subject CA\
    \ (such\n   assessment may be based upon accreditation with respect to the\n \
    \  certificate policies involved).  The assessed set of certificate\n   policies\
    \ is then indicated by the issuing CA in the CA-certificate.\n   The X.509 certification\
    \ path processing logic employs these\n   certificate policy indications in its\
    \ well-defined trust model.\n"
- title: 3.2  CERTIFICATE POLICY EXAMPLES
  contents:
  - "3.2  CERTIFICATE POLICY EXAMPLES\n   For example purposes, suppose that IATA\
    \ undertakes to define some\n   certificate policies for use throughout the airline\
    \ industry, in a\n   public-key infrastructure operated by IATA in combination\
    \ with\n   public-key infrastructures operated by individual airlines.  Two\n\
    \   certificate policies are defined - the IATA General-Purpose policy,\n   and\
    \ the IATA Commercial-Grade policy.\n   The IATA General-Purpose policy is intended\
    \ for use by industry\n   personnel for protecting routine information (e.g.,\
    \ casual electronic\n   mail) and for authenticating connections from World Wide\
    \ Web browsers\n   to servers for general information retrieval purposes.  The\
    \ key pairs\n   may be generated, stored, and managed using low-cost, software-based\n\
    \   systems, such as commercial browsers.  Under this policy, a\n   certificate\
    \ may be automatically issued to anybody listed as an\n   employee in the corporate\
    \ directory of IATA or any member airline who\n   submits a signed certificate\
    \ request form to a network administrator\n   in his or her organization.\n  \
    \ The IATA Commercial-Grade policy is used to protect financial\n   transactions\
    \ or binding contractual exchanges between airlines.\n   Under this policy, IATA\
    \ requires that certified key pairs be\n   generated and stored in approved cryptographic\
    \ hardware tokens.\n   Certificates and tokens are provided to airline employees\
    \ with\n   disbursement authority. These authorized individuals are required to\n\
    \   present themselves to the corporate security office, show a valid\n   identification\
    \ badge, and sign an undertaking to protect the token\n   and use it only for\
    \ authorized purposes, before a token and a\n   certificate are issued.\n"
- title: 3.3 X.509 CERTIFICATE FIELDS
  contents:
  - "3.3 X.509 CERTIFICATE FIELDS\n   The following extension fields in an X.509 certificate\
    \ are used to\n   support certificate policies:\n      * Certificate Policies\
    \ extension;\n      * Policy Mappings extension; and\n      * Policy Constraints\
    \ extension.\n"
- title: 3.3.1 Certificate Policies Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.1 Certificate Policies Extension\n   The Certificate Policies extension has\
    \ two variants - one with the\n   field flagged non-critical and one with the\
    \ field flagged critical.\n   The purpose of the field is different in the two\
    \ cases.\n   A non-critical Certificate Policies field lists certificate policies\n\
    \   that the certification authority declares are applicable.  However,\n   use\
    \ of the certificate is not restricted to the purposes indicated by\n   the applicable\
    \ policies.  Using the example of the IATA General-\n   Purpose and Commercial-Grade\
    \ policies defined in Section 3.2, the\n   certificates issued to regular airline\
    \ employees will contain the\n   object identifier for certificate policy for\
    \ the General-Purpose\n   policy.  The certificates issued to the employees with\
    \ disbursement\n   authority will contain the object identifiers for both the\
    \ General-\n   Purpose policy and the Commercial-Grade policy.  The Certificate\n\
    \   Policies field may also optionally convey qualifier values for each\n   identified\
    \ policy; use of qualifiers is discussed in Section 3.4.\n   The non-critical\
    \ Certificate Policies field is designed to be used by\n   applications as follows.\
    \  Each application is pre-configured to know\n   what policy it requires.  Using\
    \ the example in Section 3.2,\n   electronic mail applications and Web servers\
    \ will be configured to\n   require the General-Purpose policy.  However, an airline's\
    \ financial\n   applications will be configured to require the Commercial-Grade\n\
    \   policy for validating financial transactions over a certain dollar\n   value.\n\
    \   When processing a certification path, a certificate policy that is\n   acceptable\
    \ to the certificate-using application must be present in\n   every certificate\
    \ in the path, i.e., in CA-certificates as well as\n   end entity certificates.\n\
    \   If the Certificate Policies field is flagged critical, it serves the\n   same\
    \ purpose as described above but also has an additional role.  It\n   indicates\
    \ that the use of the certificate is restricted to one of the\n   identified policies,\
    \ i.e., the certification authority is declaring\n   that the certificate must\
    \ only be used in accordance with the\n   provisions of one of the listed certificate\
    \ policies. This field is\n   intended to protect the certification authority\
    \ against damage claims\n   by a relying party who has used the certificate for\
    \ an inappropriate\n   purpose or in an inappropriate manner, as stipulated in\
    \ the\n   applicable certificate policy definition.\n   For example, the Internal\
    \ Revenue Service might issue certificates to\n   taxpayers for the purpose of\
    \ protecting tax filings.  The Internal\n   Revenue Service understands and can\
    \ accommodate the risks of\n   accidentally issuing a bad certificate, e.g., to\
    \ a wrongly-\n   authenticated person.  However, suppose someone used an Internal\n\
    \   Revenue Service tax-filing certificate as the basis for encrypting\n   multi-million-dollar-value\
    \ proprietary secrets which subsequently\n   fell into the wrong hands because\
    \ of an error in issuing the Internal\n   Revenue Service certificate.  The Internal\
    \ Revenue Service may want\n   to protect itself against claims for damages in\
    \ such circumstances.\n   The critical-flagged Certificate Policies extension\
    \ is intended to\n   mitigate the risk to the certificate issuer in such situations.\n"
- title: 3.3.2  Policy Mappings Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.2  Policy Mappings Extension\n   The Policy Mappings extension may only be\
    \ used in CA-certificates.\n   This field allows a certification authority to\
    \ indicate that certain\n   policies in its own domain can be considered equivalent\
    \ to certain\n   other policies in the subject certification authority's domain.\n\
    \   For example, suppose the ACE Corporation establishes an agreement\n   with\
    \ the ABC Corporation to cross-certify each others' public-key\n   infrastructures\
    \ for the purposes of mutually protecting electronic\n   data interchange (EDI).\
    \ Further, suppose that both companies have\n   pre-existing financial transaction\
    \ protection policies called ace-e-\n   commerce and abc-e-commerce, respectively.\
    \  One can see that simply\n   generating cross certificates between the two domains\
    \ will not\n   provide the necessary interoperability, as the two companies'\n\
    \   applications are configured with and employee certificates are\n   populated\
    \ with their respective certificate policies.  One possible\n   solution is to\
    \ reconfigure all of the financial applications to\n   require either policy and\
    \ to reissue all the certificates with both\n   policies.  Another solution, which\
    \ may be easier to administer, uses\n   the Policy Mapping field.  If this field\
    \ is included in a cross-\n   certificate for the ABC Corporation certification\
    \ authority issued by\n   the ACE Corporation certification authority, it can\
    \ provide a\n   statement that the ABC's financial transaction protection policy\n\
    \   (i.e., abc-e-commerce) can be considered equivalent to that of the\n   ACE\
    \ Corporation (i.e., ace-e-commerce).\n"
- title: 3.3.3  Policy Constraints Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.3  Policy Constraints Extension\n   The Policy Constraints extension supports\
    \ two optional features.  The\n   first is the ability for a certification authority\
    \ to require that\n   explicit certificate policy indications be present in all\
    \ subsequent\n   certificates in a certification path.  Certificates at the start\
    \ of a\n   certification path may be considered by a certificate user to be part\n\
    \   of a trusted domain, i.e., certification authorities are trusted for\n   all\
    \ purposes so no particular certificate policy is needed in the\n   Certificate\
    \ Policies extension.  Such certificates need not contain\n   explicit indications\
    \ of certificate policy.  However, when a\n   certification authority in the trusted\
    \ domain certifies outside the\n   domain, it can activate the requirement for\
    \ explicit certificate\n   policy in subsequent certificates in the certification\
    \ path.\n   The other optional feature in the Policy Constraints field is the\n\
    \   ability for a certification authority to disable policy mapping by\n   subsequent\
    \ certification authorities in a certification path.  It may\n   be prudent to\
    \ disable policy mapping when certifying outside the\n   domain.  This can assist\
    \ in controlling risks due to transitive\n   trust, e.g., a domain A trusts domain\
    \ B, domain B trusts domain C,\n   but domain A does not want to be forced to\
    \ trust domain C.\n"
- title: 3.4  POLICY QUALIFIERS
  contents:
  - "3.4  POLICY QUALIFIERS\n   The Certificate Policies extension field has a provision\
    \ for\n   conveying, along with each certificate policy identifier, additional\n\
    \   policy-dependent information in a qualifier field.  The X.509\n   standard\
    \ does not mandate the purpose for which this field is to be\n   used, nor does\
    \ it prescribe the syntax for this field.  Policy\n   qualifier types can be registered\
    \ by any organization.\n   The following policy qualifier types are defined in\
    \ PKIX Part I\n   [PKI1]:\n      (a) The CPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer\
    \ to a\n          Certification Practice Statement (CPS) published by the CA.\n\
    \          The pointer is in the form of a uniform resource identifier\n     \
    \     (URI).\n      (b) The User Notice qualifier contains a text string that\
    \ is to be\n          displayed to a certificate user (including subscribers and\n\
    \          relying parties) prior to the use of the certificate.  The\n      \
    \    text string may be an IA5String or a BMPString - a subset of\n          the\
    \ ISO 100646-1 multiple octet coded character set.  A CA may\n          invoke\
    \ a procedure that requires that the certficate user\n          acknowledge that\
    \ the applicable terms and conditions have been\n          disclosed or accepted.\n\
    \   Policy qualifiers can be used to support the definition of generic,\n   or\
    \ parameterized, certificate policy definitions.  Provided the base\n   certificate\
    \ policy definition so provides, policy qualifier types can\n   be defined to\
    \ convey, on a per-certificate basis, additional specific\n   policy details that\
    \ fill in the generic definition.\n"
- title: 3.5  CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT
  contents:
  - "3.5  CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT\n   The term certification practice statement\
    \ (CPS) is defined by the ABA\n   Guidelines as: \"A statement of the practices\
    \ which a certification\n   authority employs in issuing certificates.\" [ABA1]\
    \ In the 1995 draft\n   of the ABA guidelines, the ABA expands this definition\
    \ with the\n   following comments:\n      A certification practice statement may\
    \ take the form of a\n      declaration by the certification authority of the\
    \ details of its\n      trustworthy system and the practices it employs in its\
    \ operations\n      and in support of issuance of a certificate, or it may be\
    \ a\n      statute or regulation applicable to the certification authority\n \
    \     and covering similar subject matter. It may also be part of the\n      contract\
    \ between the certification authority and the subscriber. A\n      certification\
    \ practice statement may also be comprised of multiple\n      documents, a combination\
    \ of public law, private contract, and/or\n      declaration.\n      Certain forms\
    \ for legally implementing certification practice\n      statements lend themselves\
    \ to particular relationships. For\n      example, when the legal relationship\
    \ between a certification\n      authority and subscriber is consensual, a contract\
    \ would\n      ordinarily be the means of giving effect to a certification\n \
    \     practice statement.  The certification authority's duties to a\n      relying\
    \ person are generally based on the certification\n      authority's representations,\
    \ which may include a certification\n      practice statement.\n      Whether\
    \ a certification practice statement is binding on a relying\n      person depends\
    \ on whether the relying person has knowledge or\n      notice of the certification\
    \ practice statement.  A relying person\n      has knowledge or at least notice\
    \ of the contents of the\n      certificate used by the relying person to verify\
    \ a digital\n      signature, including documents incorporated into the certificate\n\
    \      by reference.  It is therefore advisable to incorporate a\n      certification\
    \ practice statement into a certificate by reference.\n      As much as possible,\
    \ a certification practice statement should\n      indicate any of the widely\
    \ recognized standards to which the\n      certification authority's practices\
    \ conform.  Reference to widely\n      recognized standards may indicate concisely\
    \ the suitability of the\n      certification authority's practices for another\
    \ person's purposes,\n      as well as the potential technological compatibility\
    \ of the\n      certificates issued by the certification authority with\n    \
    \  repositories and other systems.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CERTIFICATE POLICY AND CERTIFICATION PRACTICE\n    STATEMENT\n\
    \   The concepts of certificate policy and CPS come from different\n   sources\
    \ and were developed for different reasons.  However, their\n   interrelationship\
    \ is important.\n   A certification practice statement is a detailed statement\
    \ by a\n   certification authority as to its practices, that potentially needs\n\
    \   to be understood and consulted by subscribers and certificate users\n   (relying\
    \ parties).  Although the level of detail may vary among CPSs,\n   they will generally\
    \ be more detailed than certificate policy\n   definitions.  Indeed, CPSs may\
    \ be quite comprehensive, robust\n   documents providing a description of the\
    \ precise service offerings,\n   detailed procedures of the life-cycle management\
    \ of certificates, and\n   more - a level of detail which weds the CPS to a particular\n\
    \   (proprietary) implementation of a service offering.\n   Although such detail\
    \ may be indispensable to adequately disclose, and\n   to make a full assessment\
    \ of trustworthiness in the absence of\n   accreditation or other recognized quality\
    \ metrics, a detailed CPS\n   does not form a suitable basis for interoperability\
    \ between CAs\n   operated by different organizations.  Rather, certificate policies\n\
    \   best serve as the vehicle on which to base common interoperability\n   standards\
    \ and common assurance criteria on an industry-wide (or\n   possibly more global)\
    \ basis.  A CA with a single CPS may support\n   multiple certificate policies\
    \ (used for different application\n   purposes and/or by different certificate\
    \ user communities).  Also,\n   multiple different CAs, with non-identical certification\
    \ practice\n   statements, may support the same certificate policy.\n   For example,\
    \ the Federal Government might define a government-wide\n   certificate policy\
    \ for handling confidential human resources\n   information.  The certificate\
    \ policy definition will be a broad\n   statement of the general characteristics\
    \ of that certificate policy,\n   and an indication of the types of applications\
    \ for which it is\n   suitable for use.  Different departments or agencies that\
    \ operate\n   certification authorities with different certification practice\n\
    \   statements might support this certificate policy.  At the same time,\n   such\
    \ certification authorities may support other certificate\n   policies.\n   The\
    \ main difference between certificate policy and CPS can therefore\n   be summarized\
    \ as follows:\n      (a) Most organizations that operate public or inter-\n  \
    \        organizational certification authorities will document their\n      \
    \    own practices in CPSs or similar statements.  The CPS is one\n          of\
    \ the organization's means of protecting itself and\n          positioning its\
    \ business relationships with subscribers and\n          other entities.\n   \
    \   (b) There is strong incentive, on the other hand, for a\n          certificate\
    \ policy to apply more broadly than to just a single\n          organization.\
    \  If a particular certificate policy is widely\n          recognized and imitated,\
    \ it has great potential as the basis\n          of automated certificate acceptance\
    \ in many systems, including\n          unmanned systems and systems that are\
    \ manned by people not\n          independently empowered to determine the acceptability\
    \ of\n          different presented certificates.\n   In addition to populating\
    \ the certificate policies field with the\n   certificate policy identifier, a\
    \ certification authority may include,\n   in certificates it issues, a reference\
    \ to its certification practice\n   statement.  A standard way to do this, using\
    \ a certificate policy\n   qualifier, is described in Section 3.4.\n"
- title: 3.7  SET OF PROVISIONS

  - "3.7  SET OF PROVISIONS\n   A set of provisions is a collection of practice and/or\
    \ policy\n   statements, spanning a range of standard topics, for use in\n   expressing\
    \ a certificate policy definition or CPS employing the\n   approach described\
    \ in this framework.\n   A certificate policy can be expressed as a single set\
    \ of provisions.\n   A CPS can be expressed as a single set of provisions with\
    \ each\n   component addressing the requirements of one or more certificate\n\
    \   policies, or, alternatively, as an organized collection of sets of\n   provisions.\
    \  For example, a CPS could be expressed as a combination\n   of the following:\n\
    \      (a) a list of certificate policies supported by the CPS;\n      (b) for\
    \ each certificate policy in (a), a set of provisions which\n          contains\
    \ statements that refine that certificate policy by\n          filling in details\
    \ not stipulated in that policy or expressly\n          left to the discretion\
    \ of the CPS by that certificate policy;\n          such statements serve to state\
    \ how this particular CPS\n          implements the requirements of the particular\
    \ certificate\n          policy;\n      (c) a set of provisions that contains\
    \ statements regarding the\n          certification practices on the CA, regardless\
    \ of certificate\n          policy.\n   The statements provided in (b) and (c)\
    \ may augment or refine the\n   stipulations of the applicable certificate policy\
    \ definition, but\n   must not conflict with any of the stipulations of such certificate\n\
    \   policy definition.\n   This framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions,\
    \ in terms\n   of eight primary components, as follows:\n      * Introduction;\n\
    \      * General Provisions;\n      * Identification and Authentication;\n   \
    \   * Operational Requirements;\n      * Physical, Procedural, and Personnel Security\
    \ Controls;\n      * Technical Security Controls;\n      * Certificate and CRL\
    \ Profile; and\n      * Specification Administration.\n   Components can be further\
    \ divided into subcomponents, and a\n   subcomponent may comprise multiple elements.\
    \  Section 4 provides a\n   more detailed description of the contents of the above\
    \ components,\n   and their subcomponents.\n"

  - "4.  CONTENTS OF A SET OF PROVISIONS\n   This section expands upon the contents\
    \ of a set of provisions, as\n   introduced in Section 3.7.  The topics identified\
    \ in this section\n   are, consequently, candidate topics for inclusion in a certificate\n\
    \   policy definition or CPS.\n   While many topics are identified, it is not\
    \ necessary for a\n   certificate policy or a CPS to include a concrete statement\
    \ for every\n   such topic.  Rather, a particular certificate policy or CPS may\
    \ state\n   \"no stipulation\" for a component, subcomponent, or element on which\n\
    \   the particular certificate policy or CPS imposes no requirements.  In\n  \
    \ this sense, the list of topics can be considered a checklist of\n   topics for\
    \ consideration by the certificate policy or CPS writer.  It\n   is recommended\
    \ that each and every component and subcomponent be\n   included in a certificate\
    \ policy or CPS, even if there is \"no\n   stipulation\"; this will indicate to\
    \ the reader that a conscious\n   decision was made to include or exclude that\
    \ topic.  This protects\n   against inadvertent omission of a topic, while facilitating\n\
    \   comparison of different certificate policies or CPSs, e.g., when\n   making\
    \ policy mapping decisions.\n   In a certificate policy definition, it is possible\
    \ to leave certain\n   components, subcomponents, and/or elements unspecified,\
    \ and to\n   stipulate that the required information will be indicated in a policy\n\
    \   qualifier.  Such certificate policy definitions can be considered\n   parameterized\
    \ definitions.  The set of provisions should reference or\n   define the required\
    \ policy qualifier types and should specify any\n   applicable default values.\n"

  - "NOTES\n   1 The ABA Digital Signature Guidelines can be purchased from the ABA.\n\
    \     See http://www.abanet.com for ordering details.\n   2 Examples of types\
    \ of entity for subject CAs are a subordinate\n     organization (e.g., branch\
    \ or division), a federal government\n     agency, or a state or provincial government\
    \ department.\n   3 This statement can have significant implications.  For example,\n\
    \     suppose a bank claims that it issues CA certificates to its\n     branches\
    \ only.  Now, the user of a CA certificate issued by the\n     bank can assume\
    \ that the subject CA in the certificate is a branch\n     of the bank\n   4 Examples\
    \ of the types of subject RA entities are branch and\n     division of an organization.\n\
    \   5 Examples of types of subject end entities are bank customers,\n     telephone\
    \ company subscribers, and employees of a government\n     department\n   6 This\
    \ statement can have significant implications.  For example,\n     suppose Government\
    \ CA claims that it issues certificates to\n     Government employees only.  Now,\
    \ the user of a certificate issued\n     by the Government CA can assume that\
    \ the subject of the certificate\n     is a Government employee.\n   7 Examples\
    \ include X.500 distinguished name, Internet e-mail address,\n     and URL.\n\
    \   8 The term \"meaningful\" means that the name form has commonly\n     understood\
    \ semantics to determine identity of the person and/or\n     organization.  Directory\
    \ names and RFC 822 names may be more or\n     less meaningful.\n   9 Examples\
    \ of proof include the issuing CA generating the key, or\n     requiring the subject\
    \ to send an electronically signed request or\n     to sign a challenge.\n   10\
    \ Examples of organization identity authentication are: articles of\n      incorporation,\
    \ duly signed corporate resolutions, company seal,\n      and notarized documents.\n\
    \   11 Examples of individual identity authentication are: biometrics\n      (thumb\
    \ print, ten finger print, face, palm, and retina scan),\n      driver's license,\
    \ passport, credit card, company badge, and\n      government badge.\n   12 Examples\
    \ include duly signed authorization papers or corporate ID\n      badge.\n   13\
    \ The identification policy for routine rekey should be the same as\n      the\
    \ one for initial registration since the same subject needs\n      rekeying. \
    \ The rekey authentication may be accomplished using the\n      techniques for\
    \ initial I&A or using digitally signed requests.\n   14 This identification and\
    \ authentication policy could be the same as\n      that for initial registration.\n\
    \   15 This policy could be the same as the one for initial registration.\n  \
    \ 16 The identification policy for Revocation request could be the same\n    \
    \  as that for initial registration since the same subject\n      certificate\
    \ needs to be revoked.  The authentication policy could\n      accept a Revocation\
    \ request digitally signed by subject.  The\n      authentication information\
    \ used during initial registration could\n      be acceptable for Revocation request.\
    \ Other less stringent\n      authentication policy could be defined.\n   17 The\
    \ identification policy for key compromise notification could be\n      the same\
    \ as the one for initial registration since the same\n      subject certificate\
    \ needs to be revoked.  The authentication\n      policy could accept a Revocation\
    \ request digitally signed by\n      subject.  The authentication information\
    \ used during initial\n      registration could be acceptable for key compromise\
    \ notification.\n      Other less stringent authentication policy could be defined.\n\
    \   18 The n out of m rule allows a key to be split in m parts.  The m\n     \
    \ parts may be given to m different individuals.  Any n parts out of\n      the\
    \ m parts may be used to fully reconstitute the key, but having\n      any n-\
    \ 1 parts provides one with no information about the key.\n   19 A key may be\
    \ escrowed, backed up or archived.  Each of these\n      functions have different\
    \ purpose.  Thus, a key may go through any\n      subset of these functions depending\
    \ on the requirements.  The\n      purpose of escrow is to allow a third party\
    \ (such as an\n      organization or government) to legally obtain the key without\
    \ the\n      cooperation of the subject.  The purpose of back up is to allow\n\
    \      the subject to reconstitute the key in case of the destruction of\n   \
    \   the key.  The purpose of archive is to provide for reuse of the\n      key\
    \ in future, e.g., use the private key to decrypt a document.\n   20 An example\
    \ of activation data is a PIN or passphrase.\n   21 Examples of physical access\
    \ controls are: monitored facility ,\n      guarded facility, locked facility,\
    \ access controlled using tokens,\n      access controlled using biometrics, and\
    \ access controlled through\n      an access list.\n   22 Examples of the roles\
    \ include system administrator, system\n      security officer, and system auditor.\
    \  The duties of the system\n      administrator are to configure, generate, boot,\
    \ and operate the\n      system.  The duties of the system security officer are\
    \ to assign\n      accounts and privileges.  The duties of the system auditor\
    \ are to\n      set up system audit profile, perform audit file management, and\n\
    \      audit review.\n   23 The background checks may include clearance level\
    \ (e.g., none,\n      sensitive, confidential, secret, top secret, etc.) and the\n\
    \      clearance granting authority name.  In lieu of or in addition to a\n  \
    \    defined clearance, the background checks may include types of\n      background\
    \ information (e.g., name, place of birth, date of birth,\n      home address,\
    \ previous residences, previous employment, and any\n      other information that\
    \ may help determine trustworthiness).  The\n      description should also include\
    \ which information was verified and\n      how.\n   24 For example, the certificate\
    \ policy may impose personnel security\n      requirements on the network system\
    \ administrator responsible for a\n      CA's network access.\n   25 Regardless\
    \ of whether authorized persons are employees, practices\n      should be implemented\
    \ to ensure that each authorized person is\n      held accountable for his/her\
    \ actions.\n   26 A cryptographic module is hardware, software, or firmware or\
    \ any\n      combination of them.\n   27 The compliance description should be\
    \ specific and detailed.  For\n      example, for each FIPS 140-1 requirement,\
    \ describe the level and\n      whether the level has been certified by an accredited\
    \ laboratory.\n   28 Example of audit events are: request to create a certificate,\n\
    \      request to revoke a certificate, key compromise notification,\n      creation\
    \ of a certificate, revocation of a certificate, issuance\n      of a certificate,\
    \ issuance of a CRL, issuance of key compromise\n      CRL, establishment of trusted\
    \ roles on the CA, actions of truste\n      personnel, changes to CA keys, etc.\n\
    \   29 Example of archive events are: request to create a certificate,\n     \
    \ request to revoke a certificate, key compromise notification,\n      creation\
    \ of a certificate, revocation of a certificate, issuance\n      of a certificate,\
    \ issuance of a CRL, issuance of key compromise\n      CRL, and changes to CA\
    \ keys.\n   30 A parent CA is an example of audit relationship.\n   31 Example\
    \ of compliance audit topics: sample check on the various\n      I&A policies,\
    \ comprehensive checks on key management policies,\n      comprehensive checks\
    \ on system security controls, comprehensive\n      checks on operations policy,\
    \ and comprehensive checks on\n      certificate profiles.\n   32 The examples\
    \ include, temporary suspension of operations until\n      deficiencies are corrected,\
    \ revocation of entity certificate,\n      change in personnel, invocation of\
    \ liability policy, more frequent\n      compliance audit, etc.\n   33 An organization\
    \ may choose not to make public some of its security\n      controls, clearance\
    \ procedures, or some others elements due to\n      their sensitivity.\n   34\
    \ All or some of the following items may be different for the\n      various types\
    \ of entities, i.e., CA, RA, and end entities.\n"
