  - "                     Introduction to the STD Notes\nStatus of this Memo\n   This\
    \ RFC describes a new sub-series of RFCs, called STDs (Standards).\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n1.  Introduction\n   The STDs are a subseries of\
    \ notes within the RFC series that are the\n   Internet standards.  The intent\
    \ is to identify clearly for the\n   Internet community those RFCs which document\
    \ Internet standards.\n2.  The Assignment of STD Numbers\n   There is a need to\
    \ be very clear about which specifications have\n   completed the full process\
    \ of standardization in the Internet.  To do\n   this an STD number will be assigned\
    \ to a specification when it\n   reaches the Standard maturity level.  Note that\
    \ specifications may be\n   either Technical Specifications (TS) or Applicability\
    \ Statements\n   (AS).\n   When a specification reaches the final stage of the\
    \ standardization\n   process and the IAB has designated it a standard for the\
    \ Internet, an\n   STD number will be assigned to that specification.\n   The\
    \ existing standards have been assigned STD numbers (see Appendix).\n   The standard\
    \ for a particular protocol will always have the same STD\n   number.\n      If\
    \ at some future time a protocol is reworked and a new document\n      is produced\
    \ as the specification of that standard and the new\n      specification is designated\
    \ by the IAB as a standard for the\n      Internet, then the new document will\
    \ be labeled with the same STD\n      number (of course, that new document will\
    \ have a new RFC number).\n   Multiple Documents for One Standard:\n      A STD\
    \ number identifies a standard not a document.  A document is\n      identified\
    \ by its RFC number.  If the specification of a standard\n      is spread over\
    \ several documents they will each carry the same STD\n      number.\n       \
    \  For example, the Domain Name System (DNS) is currently\n         specified\
    \ by the combination of RFCs 1034 and 1035.  Both of\n         these documents\
    \ are now labeled STD-13.\n            To be completely clear the DNS \"Concepts\
    \ and Facilities\"\n            document can be referenced as \"STD-13/RFC-1034\"\
    .\n      In such cases, whenever possible, the set of documents defining a\n \
    \     particular standard will cross reference each other.\n   One Standard or\
    \ Multiple Standards:\n      One difficult decision is deciding whether a set\
    \ of documents\n      describe one standard or multiple standards.  In the Appendix,\
    \ one\n      can see that there are several cases in which one STD applies to\n\
    \      multiple RFCs (see STDs 5, 13, and 20).  There is one case in\n      which\
    \ a family of specifications has multiple STD numbers; that is\n      the Telnet\
    \ Options.\n      The general rule is that a separate STD number is used when\
    \ the\n      specification is logically separable.  That is, logically\n     \
    \ separable options are assigned distinct STD numbers while\n      amendments\
    \ and non-optional extensions use the same STD number as\n      the base specification.\n\
    \   Multiple Versions or Editions of a Standard:\n      It may occur that the\
    \ documentation of a standard is updated or\n      replaced with a new document.\
    \  In such cases, the same STD number\n      will be used to label the standard.\
    \  No version numbers will be\n      attached to STD numbers.  There need be no\
    \ confusion about having\n      the up-to-date document about STD-9 since each\
    \ version of the\n      document will have a distinct RFC number (and of course\
    \ a\n      different date).\n   The complete identification of a specification\
    \ and its document is\n   the combination of the STD and the RFC.  For example,\
    \ \"STD-13/RFC-\n   1035\" completely identifies the current version of the second\
    \ part of\n   the Domain Name System specification.\n      To completely identify\
    \ all of the DNS standard the citation would\n      be \"STD-13/RFC-1034/RFC-1035\"\
    .\n   One way to think of this is that an acronym (like TCP) refers to a\n   concept,\
    \ which is called a protocol.  An RFC number (like RFC-793)\n   indicates the\
    \ specific version of the protocol specification.  An STD\n   number (like STD-7)\
    \ designates the status of the protocol.\n2.  Why an RFC Subseries ?\n   There\
    \ are several reasons why the STDs are part of the larger RFC\n   series of notes.\n\
    \   The foremost reason is that the distribution mechanisms for RFCs are\n   tried\
    \ and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC, can automatically get a\n   STD.  More\
    \ important, anyone who knows of the RFC series can easily\n   find the STDs.\n\
    \   Another reason for making STDs part of the RFC series is that the\n   maintenance\
    \ mechanisms for RFCs are already in place.  It makes sense\n   to maintain similar\
    \ documents is a similar way.\n3.  Format Rules\n   Since the STDs are a part\
    \ of the RFC series, they must conform to\n   \"Request for Comments on Request\
    \ for Comments: Instructions to RFC\n   Authors\" (RFC-1111) with respect to format.\n\
    3.1  Status Statement\n   Each STD RFC must include on its first page the \"Status\
    \ of this Memo\"\n   section which contains a paragraph describing the intention\
    \ of the\n   RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status approved by the\n\
    \   Internet Activities Board (IAB).\n3.2.  Distribution Statement\n   Each STD\
    \ RFC will also include a \"distribution statement\".  As the\n   purpose of the\
    \ STD series is to disseminate information, there is no\n   reason for the distribution\
    \ to be anything other than \"unlimited\".\n   Typically, the distribution statement\
    \ will simply be the sentence\n   \"Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\"\
    \ appended to the \"Status of\n   this Memo\" section.\n3.3. Security Considerations\n\
    \   All STD RFCs must contain a section that discusses the security\n   considerations\
    \ of the procedures that are the main topic of the RFC.\n3.4.  Author's Address\n\
    \   Each STD RFC must have at the very end a section giving the author's\n   address,\
    \ including the name and postal address, the telephone number,\n   and the Internet\
    \ email address.\n   In the case of multiple authors, each of the authors will\
    \ be listed.\n   In the case of a document produced by a group, the editor of\
    \ the\n   document will be listed and optionally the chair of the group may be\n\
    \   listed.\n4. The STD Publication\n   New documents can only become STD RFCs\
    \ through an action of the IAB.\n   The publication of STDs will be performed\
    \ by the RFC Editor.\n5.  STD Announcements\n   New STD RFCs are announced to\
    \ the RFC distribution list maintained by\n   the Network Information Center (NIC).\
    \  Contact the NIC to be added or\n   deleted from this mailing list by sending\
    \ an email message to RFC-\n   REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n6.  Obtaining STDs\n   STD\
    \ RFCs may be obtained in the same way as any RFC.\n   Details on obtaining RFCs\
    \ via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending\n   an EMAIL message to \"rfc-info@ISI.EDU\"\
    \ with the message body \"help:\n   ways_to_get_rfcs\".  For example:\n      \
    \     To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU\n           Subject: getting rfcs\n           help:\
    \ ways_to_get_rfcs\n   The current standards are listed in the \"IAB Official\
    \ Protocol\n   Standards\" (which is STD-1), whose current edition is RFC-1280.\n\
    Security Considerations\n   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.\n\
