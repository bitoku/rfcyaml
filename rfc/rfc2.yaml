  - "   1a Control Links\n      1a1 Logical link 0 will be a control link between\
    \ any two HOSTs on\n      the network\n         1a1a Only one control link may\
    \ exist between any two HOSTs on\n         the network. Thus, if there are n HOSTs\
    \ on the network, there\n         are n-1 control links from each HOST.\n    \
    \  1a2 It will be primarily used for communication between HOSTs for\n      the\
    \ purposes of:\n         1a2a Establishing user links\n         1a2b Breaking\
    \ user links\n         1a2c Passing interrupts regarding the status of links and/or\n\
    \         programs using the links\n         1a2d Monitor communication\n    \
    \  1a3 Imps in the network may automatically trace all messages sent\n      on\
    \ link 0.\n   1b Primary Links\n      1b1 A user at a given HOST may have exactly\
    \ 1 primary link to each\n      of the other HOSTs on the network.\n         1b1a\
    \ The primary link must be the first link established\n         between a HOST\
    \ user and another HOST.\n         1b1b Primary links are global to a user, i.e.\
    \ a user program\n         may open a primary link, and that link remains open\
    \ until it is\n         specifically closed.\n         1b1c The primary link is\
    \ treated like a teletype connected over\n         a normal data-phone or direct\
    \ line by the remote HOST, i.e. the\n         remote HOST considers a primary\
    \ link to be a normal teletype\n         user.\n         1b1d The primary link\
    \ is used for passing (user) control\n         information to the remote HOST,\
    \ e.g. it will be used for\n         logging in to the remote host (using the\
    \ remote hosts standard\n         login procedure).\n   1c Auxilliary Links\n\
    \      1c1 A user program may establish any number of auxilliary links\n     \
    \ between itself and a user program in a connected HOST.\n         1c1a These\
    \ links may be used for either binary or character\n         transmission.\n \
    \        1c1b Auxilliary links are local to the sub-system which\n         establishes\
    \ them, and therefore are closed when that subsystem\n         is left.\n"

  - "   2a Control links\n      2a1 The control link is established at system load\
    \ time.\n      2a2 The status of a control link may be active or inactive\n  \
    \       2a2a The status of the control link should reflect the\n         relationship\
    \ between the HOSTs.\n   2b Primary Links\n      2b1 Primary links are established\
    \ by a user or executive call to\n      the monitor\n         2b1a The network\
    \ identification number of the HOST to be linked\n         to must be included\
    \ in the call\n         2b1b An attempt to establish more than one primary link\
    \ to a\n         particular HOST will be regarded as an error, and the request\n\
    \         will be defaulted\n         2b1c Standard Transmission Character Set\n\
    \            2b1c1 There will be a standard character set for\n            transmission\
    \ of data over the primary links and control\n            links.\n           \
    \    2b1c1a This will be full (8 bit) ASCII.\n         2b1d (get link) The protocol\
    \ for establishing a link to HOST B\n         from HOST A is as follows\n    \
    \        2b1d1 A selects a currently unused link to HOST B from its\n        \
    \    allocation tables\n            2b1d2 A transmits a link-connect message to\
    \ B over link 0.\n            2b1d3 A then waits for:\n               2b1d3a A\
    \ communication regarding that link from B\n               2b1d3b A certain amount\
    \ of time to elaspse\n            2b1d4 If a communication regarding the link\
    \ is received from\n            B, it is examined to see if it is:\n         \
    \      2b1d4a A verification of the link from B.\n                  2b1d4a1 This\
    \ results in a successful return from the\n                  monitor to the requestor.\
    \ The link number is returned\n                  to the requestor, and the link\
    \ is established.\n               2b1d4b A request from B to establish the link.\
    \ This\n               means: that B is trying to establish the same link as A\n\
    \               independently of A.\n                  2b1d4b1 If the network\
    \ ID number of A(Na) is greater\n                  than that of B(Nb), then A\
    \ ignores the request, and\n                  continues to await confirmation\
    \ of the link from B.\n                  2b1d4b2 If, on the other hand, Na<Nb,\
    \ A:\n                     2b1d4b2a Honors the request from B to establish the\n\
    \                     link,\n                     2b1d4b2b Sends verification\
    \ as required,\n                     2b1d4b2c Aborts its own request, and repeats\
    \ the\n                     allocation process.\n               2b1d4c Some other\
    \ communication from B regarding the\n               link.\n                 \
    \ 2b1d4c1 This is an error condition, meaning that\n                  either:\n\
    \                     2b1d4c1a A has faulted by selecting a previously\n     \
    \                allocated link for allocation,\n                     2b1d4c1b\

    \                     2b1d4c1c Or a message regarding allocation from B\n    \
    \                 to A has been garbled in transmission.\n                  2b1d4c2\
    \ In this case, A's action is to:\n                     2b1d4c2a Send a link disconnect\
    \ message to B\n                     concerning the attempted connection\n   \
    \                  2b1d4c2b Consider the state of HOST B to be in\n          \
    \           error and initiate entry to a panic routine(error).\n            \
    \   2b1d5 If no communication regarding the link is received\n               from\
    \ B in the prescribed amount of time, HOST B is\n               considered to\
    \ be in an error state.\n                  2b1d5a A link disconnect message is\
    \ sent to B from A.\n                  2b1d5b A panic routine is called(error).\n\
    \   2c Auxilliary Links\n      2c1 Auxilliary links are established by a call\
    \ to the monitor from\n      a user program.\n         2c1a The request must specify\
    \ pertinent data about the desired\n         link to the monitor\n           \

    \ (A and B).\n         2c1c If Na > Nb, then HOST A proceeds to establish a link\
    \ to\n         HOST B in the manner outlined above (getlink).\n         2c1d If\
    \ Na<Nb, then A waits:\n            2c1d1 For HOST B to establish the link (after\
    \ looking to see\n            if B has already established the corresponding link).\n\
    \            2c1d2 For a specified amount of time to elapse.\n               2c1d2a\

    \ A.\n               2c1d2b The program in HOST A and B should be able to\n  \
