  - "2.0 The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Network Management Framework\
    \ presently consists of six major\n   components.  They are:\n   o   the overall\
    \ architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7].\n   o   the SMI, described in RFC 1902\
    \ [3], - the mechanisms used for\n       describing and naming objects for the\
    \ purpose of management.\n   o   the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], - the core\
    \ set of managed\n       objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n   o  \
    \ the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [1] and/or RFC 1905 [6] and/or RFC\n       2272\
    \ [8] -- the protocol for accessing managed information.\n   o   the user-based\
    \ security model defined in RFC 2274 [10].\n   o   the view-based access control\
    \ model defined in RFC 2275 [11].\n   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903\
    \ [4], and conformance\n   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].  Common applications\
    \ are\n   defined in RFC 2273 [9].\n   The Framework permits new objects to be\
    \ defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n   This memo\
    \ specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming\
    \ to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n   translation.\n"
- title: 3.0 Overview
  contents:
  - "3.0 Overview\n   This document identifies the proposed set of objects for monitoring\n\
    \   the configuration and active characteristics of devices with EBN\n   capabilities.\
    \  The Extended Border Node function is an APPN\n   enhancement for an APPN network\
    \ node (NN).  It supports topology\n   isolation, subnet interconnection, and\
    \ session establishment between\n   subnets.\n   In a single APPN network, all\
    \ network topology information is\n   propagated to all network nodes.  Directory\
    \ searches can also be\n   forwarded to all network nodes.  As the network grows,\
    \ this network\n   traffic could become prohibitive.  Also, in networks where\
    \ different\n   enterprises are connected via APPN, it may be desirable to shield\
    \ an\n   enterprise from the network traffic of another enterprise.  EBNs\n  \
    \ allow customers to partition a network into subnets to reduce or\n   shield\
    \ such network traffic.\n   An EBN provides this function by blocking topology\
    \ information\n   exchange between subnets, and controlling where directory searches\n\
    \   are forwarded.  A subnetwork is a cluster of APPN NNs which share the\n  \
    \ same network topology.  Subnetwork boundaries, or partitions, occur\n   where\
    \ an EBN and an NN adjacent to it have different network\n   identifiers (NETIDs).\
    \  They may also occur where an EBN and adjacent\n   NN have the same NETID but\
    \ are configured to have a subnetwork\n   boundary.\n   The connection between\
    \ two APPN nodes is an APPN transmission group\n   (TG).  A TG at a subnet boundary\
    \ is called an Intersubnetwork\n   Transmission Group (ISTG).\n   The subnet in\
    \ which an EBN resides is called its native subnetwork.\n   The subnet across\
    \ the subnet boundary is called the non-native\n   subnetwork, with respect to\
    \ the EBN.\n   A cost of the EBN function is that customers may have difficulty\n\
    \   determining the end-to-end route of sessions that cross subnet\n   boundaries,\
    \ and understanding how the EBN will control directory\n   searches between subnets.\
    \  This MIB addresses these issues.\n   Another challenge facing customers is\
    \ to identify subnet boundaries\n   formed by EBNs.  The SNANAU APPN MIB [14]\
    \ identifies subnet\n   boundaries in the appnNnTopology group.  The SNANAU APPN\
    \ MIB provides\n   management of APPN objects, and contains some tables that are\n\
    \   extended by this MIB.\n   In this document, we describe EBN managed objects.\n\
    \   The EBN terms and overall architecture are available from the\n   networking.raleigh.ibm.com\
    \ ftp site [15].\n   Highlights of the management functions supported by the EBN\
    \ MIB\n   module include the following:\n   o   Identifying the subnet affiliation\
    \ of LUs (logical units)\n   o   Identifying session routes in non-native subnets,\
    \ with\n       correlation to the route in the native subnet provided in the\n\
    \       SNANAU APPN MIB.\n   o   Identifying the COS (Class of Service) mappings\
    \ between subnets.\n   o   Identifying the subnet routing lists\n   This MIB module\
    \ does not support:\n   o   Configuration of EBN nodes.\n   o   Historical information\
    \ about session initiation failures.\n   o   Peripheral Border Node (PBN) support.\
    \  PBN is an APPN function\n       that only supports communication to adjacent\
    \ subnetworks, and is\n       not expected to be widely implemented.\n   o   Traps.\
    \  The APPN MIB contains a trap for Alert conditions that\n       may affect EBN\
    \ resources.  Although no APPN/EBN Alerts are\n       defined today in the APPN\
    \ MIB [14], they could exist in the\n       future.  The value for the affectedObject\
    \ object contained in the\n       alertTrap is determined by the implementation.\
    \  It may contain a\n       VariablePointer from the EBN MIB.\n"
- title: 3.1 EBN MIB Structure
  contents:
  - "3.1 EBN MIB Structure\n   The EBN MIB module contains the following groups of\
    \ objects:\n   o   ebnDir - subnet information about LUs.\n   o   ebnIsRscv -\
    \ provides the RSCV (Route Selection Control\n       Vector) and COS for the subnetwork\
    \ on the BIND destination side\n       of the EBN.\n   o   ebnDirConfig - objects\
    \ related to the EBN directory.\n   o   ebnCos - COS mapping between subnetworks,\n\
    \   o   ebnSubnetRoutingList - the customer-supplied list of where to\n      \
    \ forward search requests.\n   o   hbn - HPR (High Performance Routing) EBN intermediate\
    \ session\n       information.\n   These groups are described below in more detail.\n"
- title: 3.1.1 enbDir group
  contents:
  - "3.1.1 enbDir group\n   The ebnDir group contains the ebnDirTable, which is an\
    \ extension to\n   the appnDirTable.  It specifies the subnet affiliation of LUs\
    \ in the\n   EBN's directory.\n"
- title: 3.1.2 ebnIsRscv group
  contents:
  - "3.1.2 ebnIsRscv group\n   The ebnIsRscv group contains the ebnIsRscvTable, which\
    \ is an\n   extension to the appnIsInTable.  The appnIsInTable only allows for\n\
    \   the RSCV and COS name for one subnetwork traversed by a session.\n   This\
    \ extension contains the RSCV and COS name for the other\n   subnetwork.\n   When\
    \ an EBN changes RSCVs before forwarding a BIND, appnIsInRouteInfo\n   contains\
    \ the incoming RSCV, and ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute contains\n   the outgoing RSCV.\n\
    \   The following three cases illustrate the contents of\n   appnIsInRouteInfo\
