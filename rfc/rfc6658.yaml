  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet\
    \ service over\n   an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two\n\
    \   networks.  The server MPLS network may be an MPLS network or a\n   network\
    \ conforming to the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5317].\n   The client\
    \ may also be either an MPLS network or a network conforming\n   to the MPLS-TP.\
    \  Considerations regarding the use of an MPLS network\n   as a server for an\
    \ MPLS-TP network are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   Where the client\
    \ equipment is connected to the server equipment via a\n   physical interface,\
    \ the same data-link type must be used to attach\n   the clients to the Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) equipments, and a pseudowire\n   (PW) of the same type as the data-link\
    \ must be used [RFC3985].  The\n   reason that interworking between different\
    \ physical and data-link\n   attachment types is specifically disallowed in the\
    \ pseudowire\n   architecture is because this is a complex task and not a simple\
    \ bit-\n   mapping exercise.  The interworking is not limited to the physical\n\
    \   and data-link interfaces and the state-machines.  It also requires a\n   compatible\
    \ approach to the formation of the adjacencies between\n   attached client network\
    \ equipment.  As an example, the reader should\n   consider the differences between\
    \ router adjacency formation on a\n   point-to-point link compared to a multipoint-to-multipoint\
    \ interface\n   (e.g., Ethernet).\n   A further consideration is that two adjacent\
    \ MPLS Label Switching\n   Routers (LSRs) do not simply exchange MPLS packets.\
    \  They exchange IP\n   packets for adjacency formation, control, routing, label\
    \ exchange,\n   management, and monitoring purposes.  In addition, they may exchange\n\
    \   data-link packets as part of routing (e.g., IS-IS Hellos and IS-IS\n   Link\
    \ State Packets) and for Operations, Administration, and\n   Maintenance (OAM)\
    \ purposes such as the Link-Layer Discovery Protocol\n   [IEEE.802.1AB.2009].\
    \  Thus, the two clients require an attachment\n   mechanism that can be used\
    \ to multiplex a number of protocols.  In\n   addition, it is essential to the\
    \ correct operation of the network\n   layer that all of these protocols fate\
    \ share.\n   Where the client LSR and server PE are co-located in the same\n \
    \  equipment, the data-link layer can be simplified to a point-to-point\n   Ethernet\
    \ used to multiplex the various data-link types onto a\n   pseudowire.  This is\
    \ the method described in this document.\n   Appendix A provides information on\
    \ alternative approaches to\n   providing a packet PW that were considered by\
    \ the PWE3 Working Group\n   and the reasons for using the method defined in this\
    \ specification.\n"

- title: 3.  Client Network-Layer Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Client Network-Layer Model\n   The packet PW appears as a single point-to-point\
    \ link to the client\n   layer.  Network-layer adjacency formation and maintenance\
    \ between the\n   client equipments will follow the normal practice needed to\
    \ support\n   the required relationship in the client layer.  The assignment of\n\
    \   metrics for this point-to-point link is a matter for the client\n   layer.\
    \  In a hop-by-hop routing network, the metrics would normally\n   be assigned\
    \ by appropriate configuration of the embedded client\n   network-layer equipment\
    \ (e.g., the embedded client LSR).  Where the\n   client was using the packet\
    \ PW as part of a traffic-engineered path,\n   it is up to the operator of the\
    \ client network to ensure that the\n   server-layer operator provides the necessary\
    \ service-level agreement.\n"

    \ an encapsulation is applied, and then a second forwarding\n   decision is taken\

    \                   Figure 2: Packet PW Forwarding Model\n   A packet PW PE comprises\
    \ three components: the client LSR, a PW\n   processor, and a server LSR.  Note\
    \ that [RFC3985] does not formally\n   indicate the presence of the server LSR\
    \ because it does not concern\n   itself with the server layer.  However it is\
    \ useful in this document\n   to recognize that the server LSR exists.\n   It\
    \ may be useful to first recall the operation of a layer 2 PW such\n   as an Ethernet\
    \ PW [RFC4448] within this model.  The client LSR is not\n   present, and packets\
    \ arrive directly on the attachment circuit (AC)\n   that is part of the client\
    \ network.  The PW function undertakes any\n   header processing, if configured\
    \ to do so; it then optionally pushes\n   the PW control word (CW) and finally\
    \ pushes the PW label.  The PW\n   function then passes the packet to the LSR\
    \ function, which pushes the\n   label needed to reach the egress PE and forwards\
    \ the packet to the\n   next hop in the server network.  At the egress PE, the\
    \ packet\n   typically arrives with the PW label at the top of the stack; the\n\
    \   packet is thus directed to the correct PW instance.  The PW instance\n   performs\
    \ any required reconstruction using, if necessary, the CW, and\n   the packet\
    \ is sent directly to the attachment circuit.\n   Now let us consider the case\
    \ of client-layer MPLS traffic being\n   carried over a packet PW.  An LSR belonging\
    \ to the client layer is\n   embedded within the PE equipment.  This is a type\
    \ of native service\n   processing element [RFC3985].  The client LSR determines\
    \ the next hop\n   in the client layer, and pushes the label needed by the next\
    \ hop in\n   the client layer.  It then encapsulates the packet in an Ethernet\n\
    \   header setting the Ethertype to MPLS, and the client LSR passes the\n   packet\
    \ to the correct PW instance.  The PW instance then proceeds as\n   defined for\
    \ an Ethernet PW [RFC4448] by optionally pushing the\n   control word, then pushing\
    \ the PW label, and finally handing the\n   packet to the server-layer LSR for\
    \ delivery to the egress PE in the\n   server layer.\n   At the egress PE in the\
    \ server layer, the packet is first processed\n   by the server LSR, which uses\
    \ the PW label to pass the packet to the\n   correct PW instance.  This PW instance\
    \ processes the packet as\n   described in [RFC4448].  The resultant Ethernet\
    \ encapsulated client\n   packet is then passed to the egress client LSR, which\
    \ then processes\n   the packet in the normal manner.\n   Note that although the\
    \ description above is written in terms of the\n   behavior of an MPLS LSR, the\
    \ processing model would be similar for an\n   IP packet or any other protocol\
    \ type.\n   Note that the semantics of the PW between the client LSRs is a point-\n\
    \   to-point link.\n"

    \ except to note that the stack does not\n   retain 32-bit alignment between the\
    \ virtual Ethernet header and the\n   PW optional control word (or the PW label\
    \ when the optional\n   components are not present in the PW header).  This loss\

    \ MUST be used for the packet PW.\n   The PEs MAY use a local Ethernet address\

    \ or MAY use the special\n   Ethernet addresses \"PacketPWEthA\" or \"PacketPWEthB\"\

    \   value IP address will use PacketPWEthA, whilst the LDP peer with the\n   lower-value\
    \ IP address uses PacketPWEthB.\n   Where no signaling PW protocol is used, suitable\
    \ Ethernet addresses\n   MUST be configured at each PE.\n   Although this PW represents\
    \ a point-to-point connection, the use of a\n   multicast destination address\
    \ in the Ethernet encapsulation is\n   REQUIRED by some client-layer protocols.\
    \  Peers MUST be prepared to\n   handle a multicast destination address in the\
    \ Ethernet encapsulation.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Encapsulation Approaches Considered
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Encapsulation Approaches Considered\n   A number of approaches to\
    \ the design of a packet pseudowire (PW) were\n   investigated by the PWE3 Working\
    \ Group and were discussed in IETF\n   meetings and on the PWE3 list.  This section\
    \ describes the approaches\n   that were analyzed and the technical issues that\
    \ the authors took\n   into consideration in arriving at the approach described\
    \ in the main\n   body of this document.  This appendix is provided so that engineers\n\
    \   considering alternative optimizations can have access to the\n   rationale\
    \ for the selection of the approach described in this\n   document.\n   In a typical\
    \ network, there are usually no more that four network-\n   layer protocols that\
    \ need to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, and\n   Connectionless Network Service\
    \ (CLNS).  However, any solution needs\n   to be scalable to a larger number of\
    \ protocols.  The approaches\n   considered in this appendix all satisfy this\
    \ minimum requirement but\n   vary in their ability to support larger numbers\
    \ of network-layer\n   protocols.\n   Additionally, it is beneficial if the complete\
    \ set of protocols\n   carried over the network in support of a set of CE peers\
    \ fate share.\n   It is additionally beneficial if a single OAM session can be\
    \ used to\n   monitor the behavior of this complete set.  During the investigation,\n\
    \   various views were expressed as to where these benefits lay on the\n   scale\
    \ from absolutely required to \"nice to have\", but in the end,\n   they were\
    \ not a factor in reaching our conclusion.\n   Four candidate approaches were\
    \ analyzed:\n   1.  A protocol identifier (PID) in the PW control word (CW)\n\
    \   2.  A PID label\n   3.  Parallel PWs - one per protocol\n   4.  Virtual Ethernet\n"
- title: A.1.  A Protocol Identifier in the Control Word
  contents:
  - "A.1.  A Protocol Identifier in the Control Word\n   In this approach, a Protocol\
    \ Identifier (PID) is included in the PW\n   control word (CW) by appending it\
    \ to the generic control word\n   [RFC4385] to make a 6-byte CW (it was thought\
    \ that this approach\n   would include 2 reserved bytes to provide 32-bit alignment,\
    \ but then\n   this was optimized out).  A variant of this is just to use a 2-byte\n\
    \   PID without a control word.\n   This is a simple approach and is basically\
    \ a virtual PPP interface\n   without the PPP control protocol.  This has a smaller\
    \ MTU than, for\n   example, a virtual Ethernet would need; however, in forwarding\
    \ terms,\n   it is not as simple as the PID label or multiple PW approaches\n\
    \   described next and may not be deployable on a number of existing\n   hardware\
    \ platforms.\n"
- title: A.2.  PID Label

    \   In the PID label approach, a new Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n   Forwarding\
    \ Equivalence Class (FEC) element is used to signal the\n   mapping between protocol\
    \ type and the PID label.  This approach\n   complies with [RFC3031].\n   A similar\
    \ approach to PID label is described in Section 3.4.5 of\n   [RFC5921].  In this\
    \ case, when the client is a network-layer packet\n   service such as IP or MPLS,\
    \ a service label and demultiplexer label\n   (which may be combined) are used\
    \ to provide the necessary\n   identifications needed to carry this traffic over\
    \ an LSP.\n   The authors surveyed the hardware designs produced by a number of\n\
    \   companies across the industry and concluded that whilst the approach\n   complies\
    \ with the MPLS architecture, it may conflict with a number of\n   designers'\
    \ interpretations of the existing MPLS architecture.  This\n   led to concerns\
    \ that the approach may result in unexpected\n   difficulties in the future. \
    \ Specifically, there was an assumption in\n   many designs that a forwarding\
    \ decision should be made on the basis\n   of a single label.  Whilst the approach\
    \ is attractive, it cannot be\n   supported by many commodity chip sets, and this\
    \ would require new\n   hardware, which would increase the cost of deployment\
    \ and delay the\n   introduction of a packet PW service.\n"
- title: A.3.  Parallel PWs
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Parallel PWs\n   In this approach, one PW is constructed for each protocol\
    \ type that\n   must be carried between the PEs.  Thus, a complete packet PW would\n\
    \   consist of a bundle of PWs.  This model would be very simple and\n   efficient\
    \ from a forwarding point of view.  The number of parallel\n   PWs required would\
    \ normally be relatively small.  In a typical\n   network, there are usually no\
    \ more that four network-layer protocols\n   that need to be supported: IPv4,\
    \ IPv6, MPLS, and CLNS.  However, any\n   solution needs to be scalable to a larger\
    \ number of protocols.\n   There are a number of serious downsides with this approach:\n\
    \   1.  From an operational point of view, the lack of fate sharing\n       between\
    \ the protocol types can lead to complex faults that are\n       difficult to\
    \ diagnose.\n   2.  There is an undesirable trade-off in the OAM related to the\
    \ first\n       point.  We would have to run an OAM on each PW and bind them\n\
    \       together, which leads to significant protocol and software\n       complexity\
    \ and does not scale well.  Alternatively, we would need\n       to run a single\
    \ OAM session on one of the PWs as a proxy for the\n       others and then diagnose\
    \ any more complex failures on a case-by-\n       case basis.  To some extent,\
    \ the issue of fate sharing between\n       protocols in the bundle (for example,\
    \ the assumed fate sharing\n       between CLNS and IP in IS-IS) can be mitigated\
    \ through the use of\n       Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).\n   3.\
    \  The need to configure, manage, and synchronize the behavior of a\n       group\
    \ of PWs as if they were a single PW leads to an increase in\n       control-plane\
    \ complexity.\n   The Parallel PW mechanism is therefore an approach that simplifies\n\
    \   the forwarding plane, but only at a cost of a considerable increase\n   in\
    \ other aspects of the design, in particular, operation of the PW.\n"
- title: A.4.  Virtual Ethernet
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Virtual Ethernet\n   Using a virtual Ethernet to provide a packet PW would\
    \ require PEs to\n   include a virtual (internal) Ethernet interface and then\
    \ to use an\n   Ethernet PW [RFC4448] to carry the user traffic.  This is\n  \
    \ conceptually simple and can be implemented today without any further\n   standards\
    \ action, although there are a number of applicability\n   considerations that\
    \ it are useful to bring to the attention of the\n   community.\n   Conceptually,\
    \ this is a simple approach, and some deployed equipments\n   can already do this.\
    \  However, the requirement to run a complete\n   Ethernet adjacency led us to\
    \ conclude that there was a need to\n   identify a simpler approach.  The packets\
    \ encapsulated in an Ethernet\n   header have a larger MTU than the other approaches,\
    \ although this is\n   not considered to be an issue on the networks needing to\
    \ carry packet\n   PWs.\n   The virtual Ethernet mechanism was the first approach\
    \ that the\n   authors considered, before the merits of the other approaches\n\
    \   appeared to make them more attractive.  As we shall see below,\n   however,\
    \ the other approaches were not without issues, and it appears\n   that the virtual\
    \ Ethernet is the preferred approach to providing a\n   packet PW.\n"
- title: A.5.  Recommended Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "A.5.  Recommended Encapsulation\n   The operational complexity and the breaking\
    \ of fate-sharing\n   assumptions associated with the parallel PW approach would\
    \ suggest\n   that this is not an approach that should be further pursued.\n \
    \  The PID label approach gives rise to the concerns that it will break\n   implicit\
    \ behavioral and label-stack size assumptions in many\n   implementations.  Whilst\
    \ those assumptions may be addressed with new\n   hardware, this would delay the\
    \ introduction of the technology to the\n   point where it is unlikely to gain\
    \ acceptance in competition with an\n   approach that needs no new protocol design\
    \ and is already supportable\n   on many existing hardware platforms.\n   The\
    \ PID in the CW leads to the most compact protocol stack, is\n   simple, and requires\
    \ minimal protocol work.  However, it is a new\n   forwarding design and, apart\
    \ from the issue of the larger packet\n   header and the simpler adjacency formation,\
    \ offers no advantage over\n   the virtual Ethernet.\n   The above considerations\
    \ bring us back to the virtual Ethernet, which\n   is a well-known protocol stack\
    \ with a well-known (internal) client\n   interface.  It is already implemented\
    \ in many hardware platforms and\n   is therefore readily deployable.  After considering\
    \ a number of\n   initially promising alternatives, the authors conclude that\
    \ the\n   simplicity and existing hardware make the virtual Ethernet approach\n\
    \   to the packet PW the most attractive solution.\n"
