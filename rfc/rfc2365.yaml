- title: 3. Introduction
  contents:
  - "3. Introduction\n   Most current IP multicast implementations achieve some level\
    \ of\n   scoping by using the TTL field in the IP header. Typical MBONE\n   (Multicast\
    \ Backbone) usage has been to engineer TTL thresholds that\n   confine traffic\
    \ to some administratively defined topological region.\n   The basic forwarding\
    \ rule for interfaces with configured TTL\n   thresholds is that a packet is not\
    \ forwarded across the interface\n   unless its remaining TTL is greater than\
    \ the threshold.\n   TTL scoping has been used to control the distribution of\
    \ multicast\n   traffic with the objective of easing stress on scarce resources\n\
    \   (e.g., bandwidth), or to achieve some kind of improved privacy or\n   scaling\
    \ properties. In addition, the TTL is also used in its\n   traditional role to\
    \ limit datagram lifetime. Given these often\n   conflicting roles, TTL scoping\
    \ has proven difficult to implement\n   reliably, and the resulting schemes have\
    \ often been complex and\n   difficult to understand.\n   A more serious architectural\
    \ problem concerns the interaction of TTL\n   scoping with broadcast and prune\
    \ protocols (e.g., DVMRP [DVMRP]). The\n   particular problem is that in many\
    \ common cases, TTL scoping can\n   prevent pruning from being effective. Consider\
    \ the case in which a\n   packet has either had its TTL expire or failed a TTL\
    \ threshold. The\n   router which discards the packet will not be capable of pruning\
    \ any\n   upstream sources, and thus will sink all multicast traffic (whether\n\
    \   or not there are downstream receivers). Note that while it might seem\n  \
    \ possible to send prunes upstream from the point at which a packet is\n   discarded,\
    \ this strategy can result in legitimate traffic being\n   discarded, since subsequent\
    \ packets could take a different path and\n   arrive at the same point with a\
    \ larger TTL.\n   On the other hand, administratively scoped IP multicast can\
    \ provide\n   clear and simple semantics for scoped IP multicast. The key\n  \
    \ properties of administratively scoped IP multicast are that (i).\n   packets\
    \ addressed to administratively scoped multicast addresses do\n   not cross configured\
    \ administrative boundaries, and (ii).\n   administratively scoped multicast addresses\
    \ are locally assigned, and\n   hence are not required to be unique across administrative\
    \ boundaries.\n"

- title: 5. Discussion
  contents:
  - "5. Discussion\n   In order to support administratively scoped IP multicast, a\
    \ router\n   should support the configuration of per-interface scoped IP multicast\n\
    \   boundaries. Such a router, called a boundary router, does not forward\n  \
    \ packets matching an interface's boundary definition in either\n   direction\
    \ (the bi-directional check prevents problems with multi-\n   access networks).\
    \ In addition, a boundary router always prunes the\n   boundary for dense-mode\
    \ groups [PIMDM], and doesn't accept joins for\n   sparse-mode groups [PIMSM]\
    \ in the administratively scoped range.\n"
- title: 6. The Structure of the Administratively Scoped Multicast Space
  contents:
  - "6. The Structure of the Administratively Scoped Multicast Space\n   The structure\
    \ of the IP version 4 administratively scoped multicast\n   space is loosely based\
    \ on the IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture\n   described in RFC 1884 [RFC1884].\
    \ This document defines two important\n   scopes: the IPv4 Local Scope and IPv4\
    \ Organization Local Scope. These\n   scopes are described below.\n"
- title: 6.1. The IPv4 Local Scope -- 239.255.0.0/16
  contents:
  - "6.1. The IPv4 Local Scope -- 239.255.0.0/16\n   239.255.0.0/16 is defined to\
    \ be the IPv4 Local Scope.  The Local\n   Scope is the minimal enclosing scope,\
    \ and hence is not further\n   divisible. Although the exact extent of a Local\
    \ Scope is site\n   dependent, locally scoped regions must obey certain topological\n\
    \   constraints. In particular, a Local Scope must not span any other\n   scope\
    \ boundary. Further, a Local Scope must be completely contained\n   within or\
    \ equal to any larger scope. In the event that scope regions\n   overlap in area,\
    \ the area of overlap must be in its own local scope.\n   This implies that any\
    \ scope boundary is also a boundary for the Local\n   Scope. The more general\
    \ topological requirements for administratively\n   scoped regions are discussed\
    \ below.\n   6.1.1. Expansion of the IPv4 Local Scope\n   The IPv4 Local Scope\
    \ space grows \"downward\". As such, the IPv4 Local\n   Scope may grow downward\
    \ from 239.255.0.0/16 into the reserved ranges\n   239.254.0.0/16 and 239.253.0.0/16.\
    \ However, these ranges should not\n   be utilized until the 239.255.0.0/16 space\
    \ is no longer sufficient.\n"

    \ defined to be the IPv4 Organization Local Scope,\n   and is the space from which\
    \ an organization should allocate sub-\n   ranges when defining scopes for private\

    \ of this space.  These ranges\n   should be left unassigned until the 239.192.0.0/14\
    \ space is no longer\n   sufficient. This is to allow for the possibility that\

- title: 7. Topological Requirements for Administrative Boundaries
  contents:
  - "7. Topological Requirements for Administrative Boundaries\n   An administratively\
    \ scoped IP multicast region is defined to be a\n   topological region in which\
    \ there are one or more boundary routers\n   with common boundary definitions.\
    \ Such a router is said to be a\n   boundary for scoped addresses in the range\
    \ defined in its\n   configuration.\n   Network administrators may configure a\
    \ scope region whenever\n   constrained multicast scope is required. In addition,\
    \ an\n   administrator may configure overlapping scope regions (networks can\n\
    \   be in multiple scope regions) where convenient, with the only\n   limitations\
    \ being that a scope region must be connected (there must\n   be a path between\
    \ any two nodes within a scope region that doesn't\n   leave that region), and\
    \ convex (i.e., no path between any two points\n   in the region can cross a region\
    \ boundary). However, it is important\n   to note that if administratively scoped\
    \ areas intersect\n   topologically, then the outer scope must consist of its\
    \ address space\n   minus the address spaces of any intersecting scopes. This\
    \ requirement\n   prevents the problem that would arise when a path between two\
    \ points\n   in a convex region crosses the boundary of an intersecting region.\n\
    \   For this reason, it is recommended that administrative scopes that\n   intersect\
    \ topologically should not intersect in address range.\n   Finally, note that\
    \ any scope boundary is a boundary for the Local\n   Scope. This implies that\
    \ packets sent to groups covered by\n   239.255.0.0/16 must not be forwarded across\
    \ any link for which a\n   scoped boundary is defined.\n"

- title: 9. Structure and Use of a Scoped Region
  contents:
  - "9. Structure and Use of a Scoped Region\n   The high order /24 in every scoped\
    \ region is reserved for relative\n   assignments. A relative assignment is an\
    \ integer offset from highest\n   address in the scope and represents a 32-bit\
    \ address (for IPv4). For\n   example, in the Local Scope defined above, 239.255.255.0/24\
    \ is\n   reserved for relative allocations. The de-facto relative assignment\n\
    \   \"0\", (i.e., 239.255.255.255 in the Local Scope) currently exists for\n \
    \  SAP [SAP]. The next relative assignment, \"1\", corresponds to the\n   address\
    \ 239.255.255.254 in the Local Scope. The rest of a scoped\n   region below the\
    \ reserved /24 is available for dynamic assignment\n   (presumably by an address\
    \ allocation protocol).\n   In is important to note that a scope discovery protocol\
    \ [MZAP] will\n   have to be developed to make practical use of scopes other than\
    \ the\n   Local Scope. In addition, since any use of any administratively\n  \
    \ scoped region, including the Local Scope, requires dynamically\n   assigned\
    \ addressing, an Address Allocation Protocol (AAP) will need\n   to be developed\
    \ to make administrative scoping generally useful.\n"
- title: 9.1. Relative Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "9.1. Relative Assignment Guidelines\n   Requests for relative assignments should\
    \ be directed to the IANA. The\n   IANA will be advised by an area expert when\
    \ making relative address\n   assignments. The area expert will be appointed by\
    \ the relevant Area\n   Director.\n   In general, relative addresses will be used\
    \ only for bootstrapping to\n   dynamic address assignments from within the scope.\
    \  As such, relative\n   assignments should only be made to those services that\
    \ cannot use a\n   dynamic address assignment protocol to find the address used\
    \ by that\n   service within the desired scope, such as a dynamic address\n  \
    \ assignment service itself.\n   10. Security Considerations\n   It is recommended\
    \ that organizations using the administratively\n   scoped IP Multicast addresses\
    \ not rely on them to prevent sensitive\n   data from being transmitted outside\
    \ the organization.  Should a\n   multicast router on an administrative boundary\
    \ be mis-configured,\n   have a bug in the administrative scoping code, or have\
    \ other problems\n   that would cause that router to forward an administratively\
    \ scoped IP\n   multicast packet outside of the proper scope, the organizations\
    \ data\n   would leave its intended transmission region.\n   Organizations using\
    \ administratively scoped IP Multicasting to\n   transmit sensitive data should\
    \ use some confidentiality mechanism\n   (e.g. encryption) to protect that data.\
    \  In the case of many existing\n   video-conferencing applications (e.g. vat),\
    \ encryption is available\n   as an application feature and merely needs to be\
    \ enabled (and\n   appropriate cryptographic keys securely distributed). For many\
    \ other\n   applications, the use of the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)\n\
    \   [RFC-1825, RFC-1827] can provide IP-layer confidentiality though\n   encryption.\n\
    \   Within the context of an administratively scoped IP multicast group,\n   the\
    \ use of manual key distribution might well be feasible.  While\n   dynamic key\
    \ management for IP Security is a research area at the time\n   this note is written,\
    \ it is expected that the IETF will be extending\n   the ISAKMP key management\
    \ protocol to support scalable multicast key\n   distribution in the future.\n\
    \   It is important to note that the \"boundary router\" described in this\n \
    \  note is not necessarily providing any kind of firewall capability.\n"
