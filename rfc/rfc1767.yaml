  - "1.  Introduction\n   Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) provides a means of conducting\n\
    \   structured transactions between trading partners.  The delivery\n   mechanism\
    \ for these types of transactions in a paper world has been\n   the postal system,\
    \ so it is to be expected that electronic mail would\n   serve as a natural delivery\
    \ mechanism for electronic transactions.\n   This specification permits formatted\
    \ electronic business interchanges\n   to be encapsulated within MIME messages\
    \ [Bore92].  For the\n   specification effort, the basic building block from EDI\
    \ is an\n   interchange.\n   This specification pertains only to the encapsulation\
    \ of EDI objects\n   within the MIME environment.  It intends no changes in those\
    \ objects\n   from the primary specifications that define the syntax and semantics\n\
    \   of them.  EDI transactions take place through a variety of carriage\n   and\
    \ exchange mechanisms.  This specification adds to that repertoire,\n   by permitting\
    \ convenient carriage through Internet email.\n   Since there are many different\
    \ EDI specifications, the current\n   document defines three distinct categories\
    \ as three different MIME\n   content-types.  One is Application/EDI-X12, indicating\
    \ that the\n   contents conform to the range of specifications developed through\
    \ the\n   X12 standards organization [X125, X126, X12V].  Another is\n   Application/EDIFACT,\
    \ indicating that the contents conform to the\n   range of specifications developed\
    \ by the United Nations Working Party\n   4 Group of Experts 1 EDIFACT boards\
    \ [FACT, FACV].  The last category\n   covers all other specifications; it is\
    \ Application/EDI-consent.\n"

- title: 10.    APPENDIX - MIME FOR EDI USERS
  contents:
  - "10.    APPENDIX - MIME FOR EDI USERS\n   To assist those familiar with EDI but\
    \ not with Internet electronic\n   mail, this Appendix is provided as a very brief\
    \ introduction,\n   primarily to give pointers to the relevant specifications.\
    \  This\n   section is in no way intended to be a thorough introduction.  An\n\
    \   excellent introductory text is [Rose93].\n   Internet electronic mail follows\
    \ the classic user agent/mail transfer\n   agent model.  In this model, user software\
    \ produces a standardized\n   object which is transferred via standard exchange\
    \ protocols.\n   An Internet electronic mail object comprises a collection of\
    \ headers,\n   followed by a (possibly structured) body.  The headers specify\
    \ such\n   information as author and recipient addresses, subject summary,\n \
    \  creation date, handling node names, and so on, and are defined by\n   RFC822\
    \ and RFC1123 [Croc82, Brad89].  If the body is structured, it\n   conforms to\
    \ the rules of the Multipurpose Internet Message Exchange\n   (MIME) [Bore92].\
    \  A structured body may have parts encoded in\n   different text character sets,\
    \ or even of entirely different types of\n   data, such as voice or graphics.\n\
    \   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [Post82, Brad89] performs\n   the\
    \ primary task of message transmission.  User posting and delivery\n   interactions,\
    \ between the user agent and the message transfer agent,\n   on the same machine,\
    \ are not standardized and are platform-specific.\n   An EDI-related use of Internet\
    \ Mime email will have (at least) the\n   following components:\n       Business\
    \ Program/Data base -> EDI Translator ->\n       -> MIME encapsulation -> RFC822\
    \ packaging -> mail\n       submission ->\n       -> SMTP relaying ->\n      \
    \ -> mail delivery -> RFC822 & Mime stripping ->\n       -> EDI Translator ->\
    \ Business processing\n   The first and last lines show components normal to all\
    \ EDI activities,\n   so that it is only the EDI \"transmission\" components that\
    \ are replaced\n   with Internet modules.\n"
