  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326]\n
    \  specifies an encapsulation for links that employ the MPEG-2 Transport\n   Stream,
    with support over a wide variety of physical-layer bearers\n   [RFC4259].  The
    encapsulation header includes a Type field that\n   identifies payload types and
    Extension Headers (e.g., [RFC5163]).\n   The ULE specification requested IANA
    to maintain the ULE Next-Header\n   registry to record the allocation of the values
    used to derive this\n   Type field.\n   The Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) Project
    has published an\n   encapsulation for second-generation DVB physical layers.
    \ This\n   specifies the Generic Stream Encapsulation [GSE].  This encapsulation\n
    \  shares many of the network properties of ULE and uses a common format\n   for
    the Type field [RFC5163].  The ULE Next-Header registry is\n   therefore also
    applicable to this encapsulation.\n   This document updates the IANA rules and
    guidance defined in\n   Section 11.1 of [RFC4326] in the following way:\n   o
    \ The document clarifies use of the ULE Next-Header registry by GSE\n      as
    well as by ULE.\n   o  Section 3 specifies that new allocations in the ULE Next-Header\n
    \     registry are to be assigned by IANA using the \"Specification\n      Required\"
    policy and provides guidance to the expert reviewer.\n   o  Section 3.3 reserves
    a range of allocated values.\n   o  Section 4 adds an explanatory note to clarify
    the encoding used in\n      the ULE Next-Header registry.\n"

    - "2.1.  The ULE Next-Header Registry\n   The Mandatory Extension Headers are
      allocated in the ULE Next-Header\n   registry with integer values in the decimal
      range 0-255.  The\n   registered value corresponds to a 16-bit Type value (converted
      by\n   setting the most significant 8 bits of the 16-bit value to zero).\n   This
      Type value may identify a Mandatory Extension Header or a\n   specific protocol.\n
      \  The Optional Extension Headers are allocated in the ULE Next-Header\n   registry
      with integer values in the decimal range 256-511.  The\n   registered value
      corresponds to the 16-bit Type value that would be\n   used for an Optional
      Extension Header with a length (H-LEN) of 1.\n"
    title: 2.1.  The ULE Next-Header Registry
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Informative Example of Using a Value from the Optional Range\n   This
      section provides an informative example of how a registry entry\n   is constructed
      to identify an Optional ULE Extension Header.\n   Values registered by IANA
      in the Optional ULE Extension Header range\n   correspond to a 16-bit Type value
      with the H-LEN field (in bits 5 to\n   7) set to a decimal value of 1.  This
      registration format is used\n   irrespective of the H-LEN value to be used.
      \ Bits 8 to 15 of the\n   value in the registry are combined with the actual
      required H-LEN\n   value (bits 5 to 7) to form the 16-bit Type field.\n   For
      example, the decimal value 256 has been allocated to denote the\n   padding
      Extension Header.\n   o  Type value 256: When a 2-byte padding Extension Header
      is used,\n      the H-LEN is 1, resulting in a Type value with a decimal value
      of\n      256 (as allocated), corresponding to a hexadecimal value of 0x100.\n
      \  o  Type value 768: When a 6-byte padding Extension Header is used,\n      the
      H-LEN is 3, resulting in a Type value with a decimal value of\n      768, corresponding
      to a hexadecimal value of 0x300.\n"

  - "3.  Updated IANA Guidance on Allocation in the ULE Next-Header Registry\n   The
    rules for allocation were defined in Section 11 of [RFC4326].\n   This document
    updates these rules by replacing them with the rules in\n   this section:\n   Allocations
    in the ULE Next-Header registry are to be assigned by\n   IANA using the \"Specification
    Required\" policy defined in [RFC5226].\n   Applications must include a reference
    to a specification of the Next-\n   Header extension in a \"permanent and readily
    available public\n   specification\" [RFC5226].  An IETF Standards Track RFC can
    provide\n   such a reference.  Other specifications are also permitted.  The\n
    \  Designated Expert shall advise IANA on whether a particular\n   specification
    constitutes a \"permanent and readily available public\n   specification\".\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  ULE Next-Header Registry\n   The ULE Next-Header registry allocates 0-511
      decimal (0x0000-0x01FF\n   hexadecimal).  IANA must not allocate values greater
      than 511\n   (decimal).  For each allocated value, it also specifies the set
      of\n   allowed H-LEN values (see [RFC4326], Section 5).  The combination of\n
      \  the IANA-registered value and the H-LEN are used by ULE and GSE to\n   derive
      a set of allowed 16-bit integer values in the range 0-1535\n   (decimal).  This
      forms the first part of the ULE Type space (see\n   [RFC4326], Section 4.4.1).\n
      \  The registry is divided into two ranges:\n   1.  0-255 (decimal) IANA-assigned
      values, indicating Mandatory\n       Extension Headers (or link-dependent Type
      fields).  [RFC4326]\n       made initial assignments to this range of values
      in the registry,\n       updated by later requests.\n   2.  256-511 (decimal)
      IANA-assigned values, indicating Optional\n       Extension Headers.  The entry
      MUST define the need for the\n       Optional Extension and the intended use.
      \ [RFC4326] made initial\n       assignments to this range of values in the
      registry, updated by\n       later requests.\n"

      use of a Designated\n   Expert [RFC5226].  The Designated Expert shall review
      a proposed\n   registration for the following REQUIRED information:\n   For
      requests in the range 0-255 (decimal) - Mandatory Extension\n   Headers:\n   o
      \ The value and the name associated with the Extension Header;\n   o  The procedure
      for processing the Extension Header;\n   o  A definition of the Extension Header
      and the intended use; and\n   o  The size of the Extension Header (by default,
      the entire remaining\n      payload).\n   For requests in the range 256-511
      (decimal) - Optional Extension\n   Headers:\n   o  The value and the name associated
      with the Optional Extension\n      Header;\n   o  The procedure for processing
      the Extension Header;\n   o  A definition of the Extension Header and the intended
      use\n      (including any extension ordering requirements); and\n   o  The range
      of allowable H-LEN values that are permitted (in the\n      range 1-5).\n   If
      the registration information does not have any of the above\n   required information,
      the Designated Expert shall not approve the\n   registration to IANA.\n"

      the range 144-159 decimal (0x80-0x8F\n   hexadecimal) for Private Use [RFC5226].\n
      \  These values are not available for allocation by IANA.  Appropriate\n   use
      includes development of experimental options for which either no\n   general-purpose
      solution was planned, insufficient operational\n   experience was available
      to understand if a general solution is\n   needed, or a more general solution
      is not yet mature.  This use is\n   not coordinated between users of these values,
      so the uniqueness of a\n   particular value can not be guaranteed.\n   Authors
      of specifications MUST contact IANA to request a new value to\n   be allocated
      in the ULE Next-Header registry.  An IANA-allocated\n   value uniquely identifies
      the method.  Such an allocation is REQUIRED\n   for any method that is to be
      standardised.\n"
