Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based management of the Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces for systems compliant with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS).
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
[RFC2579] STD 58, RFC 2580
The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification process.
Baseline Privacy Security interface specification, designed for DOCSIS compliant cable data systems, that ensures device authentication data confidentiality in the CATV plant.
CATV Originally "Community Antenna Television", it now refers to any cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals to a community.
Channel A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency.
Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally allocated from the 5 42MHz range while downstream channels are generally allocated from the 50 750MHz range, depending on the capabilities of the given system.
The typical broadcast channel width in the US is 6MHz.
Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary.
For European cable systems, upstream channels vary by country.
The upper edge of upstream channel allocations varies between 25 MHz to 65 MHz, and the lower edge of downstream channel allocations varies between 47 MHz and 87.5 MHz.
The typical broadcast channel width in Europe is 8MHz.
The actual parameters are of concern to systems deploying Euro DOCSIS technology.
The downstream channels conform to the requirements of ITU T Recommendation J.83 [ITU T J.83] 2.4.
A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
2.5.  CMTS or Cable Modem Termination System
A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head end.
A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.
Codeword A characteristic of the Forward Error Correction scheme, used above the RF media layer.
See "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications: Radio Frequency Interface Specification SP RFIv2.0 I10 051209".

This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS)
The specification is derived in part from the parameters and protocols described in [ITU T J.122].
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
This MIB module defines new textual conventions for CM and CMTS indications of DOCSIS 2.0 RFI capabilities, configuration, usage, and backward compatible modes of operation, as defined in [RFI2.0].
With the same purpose, there are some textual conventions that represent capabilities and modes of operation of
[RFI1.1] that are not covered by RFC 2670, and are managed proprietarily in the DOCSIS OSSI 1.1 specification [OSSI1.1].
Textual Conventions in RFC 2670 RFC 2670 defined two textual conventions, TenthdBmV and TenthdB, which are power measurement representations.
Textual Conventions in RFC 4546
This MIB module defines the textual convention DocsisUpstreamType to represent the DOCSIS 1.0 [RFI1.0] and DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0] upstream burst modulation profiles types.
This MIB module defines the textual conventions DocsisVersion and DocsisQosVersion to represent the DOCSIS 1.0 [RFI1.0] and DOCSIS 1.1 [RFI1.1] COS/QOS capabilities and modes of operation.
This MIB module is structured as three groups:  Management information pertinent to both Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects).
Management information pertinent to Cable Modem only (docsIfCmObjects).
Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination System only (docsIfCmtsObjects).
Tables within each of these groups cover different functions; e.g., upstream queue services, channel characteristics, MAC layer management, etc.
Rows created automatically (e.g., by the device according to the hardware configuration)
may and generally will have a mixture of configuration and status objects within them.
Rows that are meant to be created by the management station are generally restricted to configuration (read create) objects.
This table describes the existing downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel for a CM.
This table describes the existing upstream channels for a CMTS and the current upstream transmission channel for a CM.
This table describes the valid Quality of Service profiles for the cable data system.
This table is used to monitor RF signal quality characteristics of received signals.
This object is used to indicate the highest level of DOCSIS version a cable device can support.
This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry.
This table maintains a number of status objects and counters for cable modems.
There is a comparable table at the CMTS, docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, which maintains similar counters from the CMTS point of view.
This table describes the upstream service queues available at this CM.
There is a comparable table at the CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from the point of view of the CMTS.
docsIfCmtsObjects docsIfCmtsMacTable Describes the attributes of each CMTS MAC interface.
This table provides a set of aggregated counters that roll up values and events that occur on the underlying sub interfaces.
docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable This table is used to hold information about known (i.e., ranging, registered,
and/or previously online) cable modems on the system serviced by this CMTS.
This table provides access to the information related to upstream service queues.
This table allows control over the modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS.
This table allows fast access into the docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface.
This table provides statistical load usage data for attached upstream and downstream physical channels.
This table provides statistical data for attached downstream channels, appropriate as input for load usage calculations.
docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable This table provides statistical data for attached upstream channels, appropriate as input for load usage calculations.
Relationship to the Interfaces MIB Module
This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].
Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following subsections.
The implementer is referred to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF downstream interface, for each RF upstream interface, for each upstream logical Channel, and for each RF MAC layer.
[RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the relationships among sub interfaces.
The following example illustrates a CMTS MAC interface with one downstream and two upstream interfaces.
As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the RF upstream interface is layered on top of an upstream logical channel.
In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:
CATV MAC Layer 3    docsCableDownstream(128)
CATV Downstream interface 4    docsCableUpstream(129)
CATV Upstream interface 5    docsCableUpstream(129)
CATV Upstream Channel 7    docsCableUpstreamChannel(205)
CATV Upstream Channel 8    docsCableUpstreamChannel(205)
CATV Upstream Channel 9    docsCableUpstreamChannel(205)
CATV Upstream Channel Figure 2
The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:
The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco Return systems.
A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem, as well as Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream cable channels, only downstream cable channels.
Systems supporting both Telco Return and cable upstream channels can use the above model without modification.
Telco Return upstream channel(s) management is outside the scope of this document.
This medium does not support virtual circuits, and this area is not applicable to this MIB module.
ifTestTable The ifTestTable is optional for DOCSIS CM/CMTS implementations, but is not specifically influenced by the RF MIB.
The ifRcvAddressTable is optional for DOCSIS CM/CMTS implementations, but is not specifically influenced by the RF MIB.
This section documents only the differences from the requirements specified in the Interfaces MIB module.

Offline Upstream Parameters Handling 3.2.5.1.
This section describes the offline configuration of the DOCSIS 2.0 upstream logical interface parameters.
The purpose of this feature is to guarantee that upstream logical interface parameters (such as modulation profile, channel type, mini slot size, and SCDMA attributes) are consistent prior to committing changes to an active upstream logical interface.
This mechanism can reduce possible downtime of the upstream interface by minimizing SNMP SET operations to in service upstream interfaces.
This mechanism is supported by CMTSs and is not applicable to CMs.
This mechanism uses three upstream channel MIB objects defined for DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS implementations: docsIfUpChannelStatus
The RowStatus object for the creation of temporary interfaces in the upstream interface table.
A temporary entry is used to modify, validate, and commit upstream parameters of a physical interface.
In the CMTS, a physical upstream interface refers to an upstream logical channel interface.
docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom This MIB object associates a physical interface with a temporary interface for the purpose of updating the upstream parameters of the physical interface.
This MIB object is the commit object that transfers the validated upstream parameters from the temporary interface to the physical interface.
The offline upstream parameters handling operation is as follows:
A temporary interface is created in which docsIfUpChannelStatus is set to 'createAndWait', which turns the new create entry status to 'notReady'.
the original upstream parameters from the physical interface to the temporary interface, which turns its status to 'notInService'.
The operator modifies the temporary interface parameters to the desired values.
At this point, a SET to 'active' to the RowStatus of the temporary interface is successful if all parameters in the temporary interface are valid for the associated physical interface; otherwise, the temporary entry remains with status 'notInservice', and the SET returns the error 'commitFailed'.
When the temporary interface status is 'active', a SET to docsIfUpChannelUpdate to 'true' transfers
the temporary interface parameters values to the physical interface.
After completion of the update operations, the temporary interface is destroyed, setting the docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'destroy'.
Relation of docsIfUpChannelStatus and ifMib
The main purpose of docsIfUpChannelStatus is the creation of temporary interfaces for offline handling of the configuration of physical interfaces; it does not manage the creation or control of physical interfaces.
To maintain a consistent operation and status report of interfaces, this object does not manage the administrative and operational status of physical interfaces.

For DOCSIS 2.0 CMTSs, an entry in this table exists for each ifEntry with an ifType of docsCableUpstreamChannel (205).
For DOCSIS 1.x CM/CMTSs and DOCSIS 2.0 CMs, an entry in this table exists for each ifEntry with an ifType of docsCableUpstream (129).
For DOCSIS 2.0 CMTSs, two classes of interfaces can be defined for this table:
The traditional DOCSIS 1.x CMTS upstream interface ifType 129 and the DOCSIS 2.0 ifType 205 that are functional.
In other words, interfaces that represent upstream receivers within an RF MAC interface.
Entries of physical interfaces are exposed to the management interface with their corresponding ifStack hierarchy and are not administratively created by this table.
A fictitious interface created for the purpose of manipulating physical interface parameters offline, then validating prior to updating the target physical interface.
In case of a reinitialization of the managed system, physical interfaces values persist while the temporary interfaces are not recreated.
This mechanism helps to minimize service disruptions originating in situations where a group of interface parameter values need to be consistent with each other in SET operations.
A temporary buffer (temporary interface) is provided to allow the CMTS to validate the parameters offline.

The transfer is initiated through an SNMP SET to 'true' of this object.

ifOperStatus 'down' while ifAdminStatus 'up' is reflected in this object as 'notInservice'.
Temporary created rows MUST be set to 'active' with the purpose of validating upstream parameter consistency prior to transferring the parameters to the physical interface.
Below is a mandatory procedure for adjusting the values of a physical interface: 1.
Create a temporary interface entry through an SNMP SET using 'createAndWait'.
At this point, the RowStatus reports 'notReady'.
The Manager entity uses an ifIndex value outside the operational range of the physical interfaces for the creation of a temporary interface.
Set the docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom object to the ifIndex value of the physical row to update.
Change the upstream parameters to the desired values in the temporary row.
Validate that all parameters are consistent by setting docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'active'.
A failure to set the RowStatus to 'active' returns the error 'commitFailed', which means the parameters are not compatible with the target physical interface.
With docsIfUpChannelStatus 'active', transfer the parameters to the target physical interface by setting the object docsIfUpChannelUpdate to 'true'.
Delete the temporary row by setting docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'destroy'."

The tertiary index into this table.
Indicates the CMTS identifier for this physical channel."
The calculated and truncated utilization index for this physical upstream or downstream channel, accurate as of the most recent docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationInterval.
The upstream channel utilization index is expressed as a percentage of mini slots utilized on the physical channel, regardless of burst type.
For an Initial Maintenance region, the mini slots for the complete region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream burst within the region from any CM on the physical channel.
For contention REQ and REQ/DATA regions, the mini slots for a transmission opportunity within the region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream burst within the opportunity from any CM on the physical channel.
For all other regions, utilized mini slots are those in which the CMTS granted bandwidth to any unicast SID on the physical channel.
For an upstream interface that has multiple logical upstream channels enabled, the utilization index is a weighted sum of utilization indices for the logical channels.
The weight for each utilization index is the percentage of upstream mini slots allocated for the corresponding logical channel.
This figure applies to the most recent utilization interval.
The downstream channel utilization index is a percentage expressing the ratio between bytes used to transmit data versus the total number of bytes transmitted in the raw bandwidth of the MPEG channel.
As with the upstream utilization index, the calculated value represents the most recent utilization interval.

current DESCRIPTION "Group of objects implemented in Cable Modem Termination Systems."
The MIB module in this document has been developed to accommodate DOCSIS 2.0 devices and their system capabilities.
The MIB module is an update to RFC 2670 [RFC2670] with the additional incorporation of DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0] and Euro DOCSIS specification requirements [EN 300 429].
Extension We have maintained the MIB objects as defined in RFC 2670 [RFC2670].
In some cases new MIB objects have been created with identical functionality but greater capacity (i.e., 32 to 64 bits).
In these situations, both the original 32 bit objects and the new 64 bit objects must be implemented.
This MIB module relates to a system that will provide metropolitan public internet access.
As such, improper manipulation of the MIB objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS RFI Interface.
Therefore, write access to the CMTS MIB objects may compromise the end user's services.
In the CM case, the only read write object of this MIB module is docsIfCmRangingTimeout, which if SET maliciously, may not constitute a critical factor of service degradation.
The rest of the CM required MIB objects in this MIB module are read  only, either by definition, or by compliance statements.
The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS RFI Interface.
Objects in the docsIfBasicGroupv2, if SET maliciously, could result in a denial of service.
Particularly, SETs to objects in docsIfDownstreamChannelTable, docsIfUpstreamChannelTable, docsIfCmtsModulationTable, and
docsIfQosProfileTable (the last one in conjunction with the MIB object docsIfCmtsQosProfilePermissions) can alter negatively the physical and link layer parameters of upstream and downstream channels.
The Object docsIfCmtsServiceAdminStatus of the docsIfCmtsGroupv2 group, when SET maliciously by an attacker to 'disabled' or 'destroyed', will interrupt the service of the corresponding cable modem.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Below are some sensitivity considerations:  Read access to the MIB objects in tables docsIfCmStatusTable (CM), docsIfSignalQualityTable (CM/CMTS) and in CMTS tables docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable, docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable, and docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable, could reveal information about the cable modems' distribution among the upstream and downstream channels and their performance, which could be used to gain access to a different tiered service offer.
The table docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable also contains the MAC and IP addresses of the cable modems, which can be used for theft of service.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
Management Interoperability of DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 The MIB module contained in this document updates
RFC 2670 [RFC2670], primarily to handle the management requirements of the DOCSIS RF Interface of DOCSIS 2.0
RFC 2670 contains the DOCSIS RF Interface management requirements for DOCSIS 1.0 and DOCSIS 1.1.
The management requirements of Class of Service (DOCSIS 1.0) pertaining to RFC 2670 are the same as this document update and are contained in the tables docsIfQosProfileTable, docsIfCmServiceTable, and docsIfCmtsServiceTable.
DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0
Quality of Service management requirements are defined in the DOCSIS management specifications [OSSI1.1] and [OSSI2.0], respectively.
