  - "1.  Introduction\n   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] utilizes X.509v3\n
    \  certificates that include the [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses\n   to
    certify a router's authorization to advertise the IPv6 prefix for\n   the Neighbor
    Discovery (ND) protocol.  The SEND specification defines\n   a basic certificate
    profile for SEND.  The certificate profile\n   defined in this document supersedes
    the profile for Router\n   Authorization Certificates specified in [RFC3971].
    \ That is,\n   certificates used in SEND (by routers, proxies, or address owners)\n
    \  MUST conform to this certificate profile and MAY conform to the\n   original
    profile in [RFC3971].\n   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is the
    global PKI that\n   attests to the allocation of IP address space.  The RPKI represents\n
    \  the centralized model discussed in Section 6.2 of [RFC3971].\n   Consequently,
    SEND will use the RPKI Certificate Profile and\n   certificate validation detailed
    in [RFC6487].  Consequently, the\n   certificate validation method described in
    [RFC3971] is updated with\n   the certificate validation method in [RFC6487].\n
    \  Since the [RFC3779] IPv6 address extension does not mention what\n   functions
    the node can perform for the certified IPv6 space, it\n   becomes impossible to
    know the reason for which the certificate was\n   issued.  In order to facilitate
    issuance of certificates for specific\n   functions, it is necessary to utilize
    the ExtKeyUsageSyntax field\n   (optional in RPKI certificates) of the X.509 certificate
    to mention\n   why the certificate was issued.  This document specifies four\n
    \  extended key usage values -- one for routers, two for proxies, and\n   one
    for address owners -- for use with SEND.\n   In RFC 3971, two deployment models
    were described: centralized and\n   decentralized.  This document describes the
    different deployment\n   models that can be used with the SEND certificates defined
    here.\n"

    example\n   is included in Appendix A.\n   In Sections 2, 4.9.10, and 4.9.11 of
    [RFC6487], it is stated that\n   RFC 3779 resource extensions MUST be marked as
    critical and MUST be\n   present in all resource certificates.  SEND certificates
    MUST include\n   the IP Address Delegation extension [RFC3779].  This extension
    MUST\n   include at least one address block for the IPv6 Address Family\n   (AFI=0002),
    as described in Section 4.9.10 of [RFC6487].  SEND\n   certificates MUST NOT have

    - "4.1.  Unconstrained Certified Subnet Prefixes\n   Section 7.3 of [RFC3971]
      defines the Unconstrained Certified subnet\n   prefixes category by using certificates
      containing either the null\n   prefix or no prefix extension at all.\n   When
      using the RPKI Certificate Profile, prefix extensions are\n   mandatory and
      the null prefix MUST be validated.  However, a\n   certificate may inherit its
      parent's prefix or range by using the\n   \"inherit\" element for the IPv6 Address
      Family Identifier (AFI) as\n   defined in [RFC3779].  The use of the \"inherit\"
      element is permitted\n   in [RFC6487].\n   Consequently, this document updates
      Section 7.3 of [RFC3971], adding\n   the following text under Unconstrained:\n
      \  Network operators that do not want to constrain routers to route\n   particular
      subnet prefixes, but rather inherit those prefixes from\n   the routers' parent
      certificates, should configure routers with\n   certificates containing the

  - "5.  Deployment Models\n   RFC 3971 describes two deployment models: centralized
    and\n   decentralized.  These models were differentiated by having one trust\n
    \  anchor or many trust anchors.  In this document, we introduce two new\n   deployment
    models not based on the number of trust anchors but on the\n   localization of
    the SEND deployment.\n   The local SEND deployment model represents those cases
    where SEND\n   deployment is confined to an administrative domain.  In this\n
    \  scenario, the deployment of SEND MAY be done independently of the\n   existence
    of deployment in the upper RPKI hierarchy (i.e., an end\n   user could perform
    local SEND deployment without the need for RPKI\n   deployment in its ISP).  This
    model requires the use of local trust\n   anchors and configuring islands of trust.
    \ This model MAY include\n   Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193].\n   The
    public SEND deployment models represent those cases where SEND\n   deployment
    is linked to RPKI deployment as described in [RFC6480].\n   Trust anchor material
    MAY be part of a different administrative\n   domain (i.e., RIRs, NIRs, or ISPs).
    \ It is a global model suitable\n   for mobile users.\n   These two models are
    not mutually exclusive.  It is entirely possible\n   to have a hybrid model that
    incorporates features from both of these\n   models.  In one such hybrid deployment
    model, most IP address\n   resources (e.g., global unicast addresses) would be
    certified under\n   the global RPKI, while some others (e.g., ULAs) are certified
    under\n   local trust anchors.\n"
  title: 5.  Deployment Models
- contents:
  - "6.  Trust Anchor Material\n   Relying parties (e.g., end hosts that implement
    SEND and process\n   these router certificates) MUST be configured with one or
    more trust\n   anchors to enable validation of the routers' certificates.  [RFC6495]\n
    \  and Section 6.5 of [RFC3971] list the trust anchor configuration\n   options
    for end hosts using SEND.\n   In the local SEND deployment model, it is possible
    to use as a trust\n   anchor a certificate that includes in its RFC 3779 address
    extension\n   the prefix ::/0.  In this case, no new trust anchor material would
    be\n   needed when renumbering.  However, if trying to move from the local\n   deployment
    model to the public deployment model, new trust anchor\n   material will have
    to be distributed to relying parties.\n"

  - "7.  Extended Key Usage Values\n   The Internet PKI document [RFC5280] specifies
    the extended key usage\n   X.509 certificate extension.  The extension indicates
    one or more\n   purposes for which the certified public key may be used.  The\n
    \  extended key usage extension can be used in conjunction with the key\n   usage
    extension, which indicates the intended purpose of the\n   certified public key.
    \ The EKU extension is defined as optional in\n   [RFC6487] for end-entity certificates
    but MUST be present when\n   issuing end-entity certificates for SEND.\n   The
    extended key usage extension syntax is repeated here for\n   convenience:\n      ExtKeyUsageSyntax
    ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId\n      KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n
    \  This specification defines four KeyPurposeId values: one for\n   authorizing
    routers (Router Authorization Certificates), two for\n   authorizing proxies (Secure
    Proxy ND Certificates), and one for\n   address owners (Owner Authorization Certificates).
    \ Additional\n   KeyPurposeId values may be specified in Standards Track documents.\n
    \  The inclusion of the router authorization value (id-kp-sendRouter)\n   indicates
    that the certificate has been issued for allowing the\n   router to generate Router
    Advertisement (RA) and Redirect messages\n   for any prefix(es) encompassed (as
    defined in Section 7.1 of\n   [RFC6487]) by the IP address space included in the
    X.509 extensions\n   for IP addresses.\n   The inclusion of the proxied routing
    authorization value\n   (id-kp-sendProxiedRouter) indicates that the certificate
    has been\n   issued for allowing the proxy to perform proxying of RA and Redirect\n
    \  messages for any prefix(es) encompassed by the IP address space\n   included
    in the X.509 extensions for IP addresses.\n   The inclusion of the owner authorization
    value (id-kp-sendOwner)\n   indicates that the certificate has been issued for
    allowing the node\n   to use any address(es) that is/are encompassed by the IP
    address\n   space included in the X.509 extensions for IP addresses.  For an\n
    \  address in such a certificate, the node can assign the address to an\n   interface;
    send/receive traffic from/to this address; and send/\n   respond to NS, NA, and
    RS messages related to that address.\n   The inclusion of the proxied owner authorization
    value\n   (id-kp-sendProxiedOwner) indicates that the certificate has been\n   issued
    for allowing the proxy to perform proxying of Neighbor\n   Solicitation (NS),
    Neighbor Advertisement (NA), and Router\n   Solicitation (RS) messages for any
    address encompassed by the IP\n   address space included in the X.509 extensions

    ::= { id-kp 24 }\n      id-kp-sendOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 25 }\n      id-kp-sendProxiedOwner
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp 26 }\n   As described in [RFC6487], the extended
    key usage extension, if\n   present, MUST be non-critical.\n   Relying parties
    MUST require the extended key usage extension to be\n   present in a certificate,
    and they MAY require a particular\n   KeyPurposeId value to be present (such as
    id-kp-sendRouter or\n   id-kp-sendProxiedRouter) within the extended key usage
    extension.  If\n   multiple KeyPurposeId values are included, the relying parties
    need\n   not recognize all of them, as long as the required KeyPurposeId value\n
    \  is present.  Relying parties MUST reject certificates that do not\n   contain
    at least one SEND KeyPurposeId, even if they include the\n   anyExtendedKeyUsage
    OID defined in [RFC5280].\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   The certification authority needs to ensure
    that the correct values\n   for the extended key usage are inserted in each certificate
    that is\n   issued.  Relying parties may accept or reject a particular\n   certificate
    for an intended use based on the information provided in\n   these extensions.
    \ Incorrect representation of the information in the\n   extended key usage field
    can cause the relying party to reject an\n   otherwise appropriate certificate
    or accept a certificate that ought\n   to be rejected.  In particular, since a
    SEND certificate attests that\n   its subject is authorized to play a given role
    in the SEND protocol,\n   certificates that contain incorrect EKU values can enable
    some of the\n   same attacks that SEND was meant to prevent.  For example, if
    a\n   malicious host can obtain a certificate that authorizes it to act as\n   a
    router for a given prefix, then it can masquerade as a router for\n   that prefix,
    e.g., in order to attract traffic from local nodes.\n"
