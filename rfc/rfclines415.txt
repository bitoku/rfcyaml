OUR TTY'S AND LPT HAVE ULTIMATE CPU BANDWIDTHS NEAR 15 20 KB.
2400 BAUD, A TTY TAKES 15% OF THE CPU.
WHEN JUST TYPING THINGS OUT ON A 2400 BAUD TERMINAL.
AS A ROUGH CALCULATION, THE BANDWIDTH OF THE TIP TAPE TRANSMISSION FEATURE
NETMAG PROGRAM IS ABOUT 7 KILOBITS/SEC.
ONE TAPE OF ABOUT 6,000 TENEX PAGES TOOK ABOUT 4 HOURS TO TRANSMIT.
THIS WAS A FULL TAPE FROM ETAC TO CCA
WITH NOTHING ELSE RUNNING ON OUR SYSTEM.
ABOUT 30% OF THE CPU IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THIS BANDWIDTH.
THIS IS ONLY ABOUT 20KB PER CPU SEC.
