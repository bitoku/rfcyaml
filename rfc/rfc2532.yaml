- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document notes a number of enhancements to the \"Simple\
    \ Mode of\n   Facsimile Using Internet Mail\" [RFC2305] that may be combined to\n\
    \   create an extended mode of facsimile using Internet mail.\n   The new features\
    \ are designed to be interoperable with the existing\n   base of mail transfer\
    \ agents (MTAs) and mail user agents (MUAs), and\n   take advantage of existing\
    \ standards for advanced functionality such\n   as positive delivery confirmation\
    \ and disposition notification.  The\n   enhancements described in this document\
    \ utilize the messaging\n   infrastructure, where possible, instead of creating\
    \ fax-specific\n   features which are unlikely to be implemented in non-fax messaging\n\
    \   software.\n   This document standardizes the following two features.\n   \
    \   *  Delivery confirmation (Section 2) (required)\n      *  Additional document\
    \ features (Section 3) (optional)\n   These features are fully described in another\
    \ document titled\n   \"Terminology and Goals for Internet Fax\" [RFC2542].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Definition of Terms\n   The term \"processing\" indicates the action of\
    \ rendering or\n   transmitting the contents of the message to a printer, display\n\
    \   device, or fax machine.\n   The term \"processing confirmation\" is an indication\
    \ by the recipient\n   of a message that it is able to process the contents of\
    \ that message.\n   The term \"recipient\" indicates the device which performs\
    \ the\n   processing function.  For example, a recipient could be implemented\n\
    \   as a traditional Mail User Agent on a PC, a standalone device which\n   retrieves\
    \ mail using POP3 or IMAP, an SMTP server which prints\n   incoming messages (similar\
    \ to an LPR server).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  GSTN Fax Gateways ("onramp"/"offramp")
  contents:
  - "1.2.  GSTN Fax Gateways (\"onramp\"/\"offramp\")\n   The behavior of gateways\
    \ from GSTN fax to SMTP (\"onramps\") and from\n   SMTP to GSTN fax (\"offramps\"\
    ) are not described in this document.\n   However, such gateways SHOULD have the\
    \ behavior characteristics of\n   senders and recipients as described in this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 2.  Delivery and Processing Confirmation
  contents:
  - "2.  Delivery and Processing Confirmation\n   In traditional GSTN-based realtime\
    \ facsimile, the receiving terminal\n   acknowledges successful receipt and processing\
    \ of every page [T.30].\n   In Internet Mail, the operations of Delivery (to the\
    \ mailbox) and\n   Disposition (to paper or a screen) may be separated in time\
    \ (due to\n   store and forwarding of messages) and location (due to separation\
    \ of\n   delivery agent (MTA) and user agent (MUA)).  The confirmation of\n  \
    \ these two operations are supplied by two different standards-track\n   mechanisms:\
    \ Delivery Status Notifications (DSN) [RFC1891, RFC1894]\n   and Message Disposition\
    \ Notifications (MDN) [RFC2298], respectively.\n   This section defines requirements\
    \ for devices or services that are to\n   be considered compliant with this document.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Sender Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Sender Requirements\n   Because delivery failure may occur (over disk quota,\
    \ user no longer\n   exists, malconfigured mailer), a delivery failure message\
    \ (in the\n   format described by [RFC1894] or otherwise) may be sent to the\n\
    \   envelope-from address specified by the sender.  Thus, the envelope-\n   from\
    \ address supplied by the sender MUST be able to properly handle\n   such delivery\
    \ failure messages.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Delivery Confirmation
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Delivery Confirmation\n   If the sender desires delivery confirmation,\
    \ the sender MUST request\n   Delivery Status Notification by including the the\
    \ esmtp-keyword\n   NOTIFY with the esmtp-value SUCCESS (section 5.1 of [RFC1891]).\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Processing Confirmation
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Processing Confirmation\n   If the sender desires processing confirmation,\
    \ the sender MUST\n   request Message Disposition Notification ([RFC2298] section\
    \ 2) when\n   sending the message itself.\n   Because a recipient may silently\
    \ ignore a request for an MDN (section\n   2.1 of [RFC2298]) at any time:\n  \
    \    *  MDNs MUST NOT be used for delivery confirmation, but are only\n      \
    \   useful for disposition (\"processing\") notification.\n      *  the sender\
    \ MUST NOT assume the recipient will respond to an MDN\n         request in a\
    \ subsequent message, even if the recipient has done\n         so in the past.\n\
    \   The address provided by the sender on the Disposition-Notification-To\n  \
    \ field MUST be able to receive Message Disposition Notifications\n   messages\
    \ [RFC2298] and SHOULD be able to receive messages that are\n   not in the Message\
    \ Disposition Notification format (due to the\n   existence of legacy systems\
    \ that generate non-RFC2298-compliant\n   responses to the Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ field).  The\n   Disposition-Notification-To address and the envelope-from address\n\
    \   SHOULD match to allow automated responses to MDN requests (section\n   2.1\
    \ of [RFC2298]).\n"
- title: 2.2.   Recipient Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.2.   Recipient Requirements\n   Recipients SHOULD implement Message Disposition\
    \ Notifications\n   [RFC2298] and SHOULD indicate supported media features in\
    \ DSN and MDN\n   messages per [RFC2530].\n   If the recipient is an SMTP server,\
    \ it behaves as part of the\n   receiver infrastructure and is therefore subject\
    \ to the \"Receiver\n   Infrastructure\" requirements of this document.\n   See\
    \ also \"Recipient Recommendations\" in section 5.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  MDN Recipient Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  MDN Recipient Requirements\n   Recipients MUST be configurable to silently\
    \ ignore a request for an\n   MDN (section 2.1 of [RFC2298]).\n   If the recipient\
    \ is an automated message processing system which is\n   not associated with a\
    \ person, the device MAY be configurable to\n   always respond to MDN requests,\
    \ but in all cases MUST be configurable\n   to never generate MDNs.\n   A recipient\
    \ MUST NOT generate an unsolicited MDN to indicate\n   successful processing.\
    \  A recipient MAY generate an unsolicited MDN\n   (sent to the envelope-from\
    \ (Return-Path:) address) to indicate\n   processing failure, but subject to the\
    \ [RFC2298] requirement that it\n   MUST always be possible for an operator to\
    \ disable unsolicited MDN\n   generation.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Recipients Using Mailbox Access Protocols
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Recipients Using Mailbox Access Protocols\n   A recipient using POP3\
    \ [RFC1939] or IMAP4 [RFC2060] to retrieve its\n   mail MUST NOT generate a Delivery\
    \ Status Notification message\n   [RFC1894] because such a notification, if it\
    \ was requested, would\n   have already been issued by the MTA on delivery to\
    \ the POP3 or IMAP4\n   message store.\n   The recipient MUST NOT use the RFC822\
    \ \"To:\" fields, \"Cc:\" fields,\n   \"Bcc:\" fields, or any other fields containing\
    \ header recipient\n   information to determine the ultimate destination mailbox\
    \ or\n   addressee, and SHOULD NOT use other RFC822 or MIME fields for making\n\
    \   such determinations.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Messaging Infrastructure Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Messaging Infrastructure Requirements\n   This section explains the requirements\
    \ of the SMTP messaging\n   infrastructure used by the sender and receiver.  This\
    \ infrastructure\n   is commonly provided by the ISP or a company's internal mailers\
    \ but\n   can actually be provided by another organization with appropriate\n\
    \   service contracts.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Sender Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Sender Infrastructure\n   Support for DSN [RFC1891] MUST be provided\
    \ by the mail submission\n   server [RFC2476] used by the sender and MUST be provided\
    \ up to the\n   mailer responsible for communicating with external (Internet)\n\
    \   mailers.\n   Also see section 5.1 of this document.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Receiver Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Receiver Infrastructure\n   Support for DSN [RFC1891] MUST be provided\
    \ by the external\n   (Internet-accessible) mailer, and MUST be provided by each\
    \ mailer\n   between the external mailer and the recipient.  If the recipient\
    \ is\n   implemented as an SMTP server it MUST also support DSN [RFC1891].\n"
- title: 3.  Additional Document Capabilities
  contents:
  - "3.  Additional Document Capabilities\n   Section 4 of \"A Simple Mode of Facsimile\
    \ Using Internet Mail\"\n   [RFC2305] allows sending only the minimum subset of\
    \ TIFF for\n   Facsimile \"unless the sender has prior knowledge of other TIFF\
    \ fields\n   or values supported by the recipient.\"\n   A recipient MAY support\
    \ any or all (or any combination) of the TIFF\n   profiles defined in RFC 2301,\
    \ in addition to profile S.  A recipient\n   which supports additional profiles\
    \ SHOULD indicate this support as\n   per section 3.2 or 3.3 of this document.\
    \  As a consequence, a sender\n   MAY use those additional TIFF profiles when\
    \ sending to a recipient\n   with the corresponding capabilities.\n   A sender\
    \ SHOULD be able to recognize and process the feature tags as\n   defined in [RFC2531]\
    \ when reviewing the capabilities presented by a\n   potential recipient.  The\
    \ capability matching rules indicated there\n   (by reference to [RFC2533]) allow\
    \ for the introduction of new\n   features that may be unrecognized by older implementations.\n\
    \   A sender MAY send a message containing both the minimum subset of\n   TIFF\
    \ for Facsimile (as specified in [RFC2305]) and a higher quality\n   TIFF using\
    \ multipart/alternative.\n   Three methods for the sender to acquire such knowledge\
    \ are described:\n      1.  Sender manual configuration\n      2.  Capabilities\
    \ in Directory\n      3.  Capabilities returned in MDN or DSN\n   Method (3) SHOULD\
    \ be used.\n   An implementation may cache capabilities locally and lose\n   synchronization\
    \ with the recipient's actual capabilities.  A\n   mechanism SHOULD be provided\
    \ to allow the sender to override the\n   locally-stored cache of capabilities.\
    \  Also note section 4.1 of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Sender Manual Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Sender Manual Configuration\n   One way a sender can send a document which\
    \ exceeds the minimum subset\n   allowed by [RFC2305] is for the user controlling\
    \ the sender to\n   manually override the default settings, usually on a per-recipient\n\
    \   basis.  For example, during transmission a user could indicate the\n   recipient\
    \ is capable of receiving high resolution images or color\n   images.\n   While\
    \ awkward and not automatic, this mechanism reflects the current\n   state of\
    \ deployment of configuration for extended capabilities to\n   ordinary Internet\
    \ email users.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Capabilities in Directory
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Capabilities in Directory\n   A future direction for enhanced document\
    \ features is to create a\n   directory structure of recipient capabilities, deployed,\
    \ for example,\n   through LDAP or DNS. The directory would provide a mechanism\
    \ by which\n   a sender could determine a recipient's capabilities before message\n\
    \   construction or transmission, using a directory lookup. Such\n   mechanisms\
    \ are not defined in this document.\n   There is active investigation within the\
    \ IETF to develop a solution\n   to this problem, which would resolve a wide range\
    \ of issues with\n   store-and-forward messaging.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Capabilities Returned in MDN or DSN
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Capabilities Returned in MDN or DSN\n   As outlined in section 2 of this\
    \ document, a sender may request a\n   positive DSN or an MDN.\n   If the recipient\
    \ implements [RFC2530], the DSN or MDN that is\n   returned can contain information\
    \ describing the recipient's\n   capabilities.  The sender can use this information\
    \ for subsequent\n   communications with that recipient.\n   The advantage of\
    \ this approach is that additional infrastructure is\n   not required (unlike\
    \ section 3.2), and the information is acquired\n   automatically (unlike section\
    \ 3.1).\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Restrictions and Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Restrictions and Recommendations\n   A sender MUST NOT send a message\
    \ with no processable content to\n   attempt to elicit an MDN/DSN capability response.\
    \  Doing so with a\n   message with no processable content (such as a message\
    \ containing\n   only a request for capabilities or a blank message) will confuse\
    \ a\n   recipient not already designed to understand the semantics of such a\n\
    \   message.\n   A recipient SHOULD indicate the profiles and features supported,\
    \ even\n   if the recipient supports only Tiff Profile S (the minimum set for\n\
    \   fax as defined by [RFC2305]) [RFC2531].  This allows a sender to\n   determine\
    \ that the recipient is compliant with this Extended\n   Facsimile Using Internet\
    \ Mail specification.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   As this document is an extension of [RFC2305],\
    \ the Security\n   Considerations section of [RFC2305] applies to this document.\n\
    \   The following additional security considerations are introduced by\n   the\
    \ new features described in this document.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Inaccurate Capabilities Information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Inaccurate Capabilities Information\n   Inaccurate capability information\
    \ (section 3) could cause a denial of\n   service.  The capability information\
    \ could be inaccurate due to many\n   reasons, including compromised or improperly\
    \ configured directory\n   server, improper manual configuration of sender, compromised\
    \ DNS, or\n   spoofed MDN.  If a sender is using cached capability information,\n\
    \   there SHOULD be a mechanism to allow the cached information to be\n   ignored\
    \ or overridden if necessary.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Submit Mailer Does Not Support DSN
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Submit Mailer Does Not Support DSN\n   In some installations the generally\
    \ available submit server may not\n   support DSNs.  In such circumstances, it\
    \ may be useful for the sender\n   to implement [RFC974] mail routing as well\
    \ as additional submission\n   server functions [RFC2476] so that the installation\
    \ is not\n   constrained by limitations of the incumbent submission server.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Recipient Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Recipient Recommendations\n   To provide a high degree of reliability,\
    \ it is desirable for the\n   sender to know that a recipient could not process\
    \ a message.  The\n   inability to successfully process a message may be detectable\
    \ by the\n   recipient's MTA or MUA.\n   If the recipient's MTA determines the\
    \ message cannot be processed,\n   the recipient's MTA is strongly encouraged\
    \ to reject the message with\n   a [RFC1893] status code of 5.6.1.  This status\
    \ code may be returned\n   in response to the end-of-mail-data indicator if the\
    \ MTA supports\n   reporting of enhanced error codes [RFC2034], or after message\n\
    \   reception by generating a delivery failure DSN (\"bounce\").\n   Note:  Providing\
    \ this functionality in the MTA, via either of the\n          two mechanisms described\
    \ above, is superior to providing the\n          function using MDNs because MDNs\
    \ must generally be requested\n          by the sender (and the request may, at\
    \ any time, be ignored by\n          the receiver).  Message rejection performed\
    \ by the MTA can\n          always occur without the sender requesting such behavior\
    \ and\n          without the receiver circumventing the behavior.\n   If the message\
    \ contains an MDN request and the recipient's MUA\n   determines the message cannot\
    \ be processed, the recipient's MUA is\n   strongly encouraged to repond to an\
    \ MDN request and indicate that\n   processing failed with the disposition-type\
    \ \"processed\" or\n   \"displayed\" and disposition-modifier \"error\" or \"\
    warning\" [RFC2298].\n"
