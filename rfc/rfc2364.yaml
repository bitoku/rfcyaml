  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
    for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n   This
    document describes the use of ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) for\n   framing PPP
    encapsulated packets.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Applicability\n   This specification is intended for those implementations which
    desire\n   to use the facilities which are defined for PPP, such as the Link\n
    \  Control Protocol, Network-layer Control Protocols, authentication,\n   and
    compression.  These capabilities require a point-to-point\n   relationship between
    the peers, and are not designed for the multi-\n   point relationships which are
    available in ATM and other multi-access\n   environments.\n"
  title: Applicability
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   ATM AAL5 protocol is designed to provide virtual connections
    between\n   end stations attached to the same network.  These connections offer
    a\n   packet delivery service that includes error detection, but does not\n   do
    error correction.\n   Most existing implementations of PPP use ISO 3309 HDLC as
    a basis for\n   their framing [3].\n   When an ATM network is configured with
    point-to-point connections,\n   PPP can use AAL5 as a framing mechanism.\n"

  title: 2. Conventions
- contents:
  - "3. AAL5 Layer Service Interface\n   The PPP layer treats the underlying ATM AAL5
    layer service as a bit-\n   synchronous point-to-point link.  In this context,
    the PPP link\n   corresponds to an ATM AAL5 virtual connection.  The virtual\n
    \  connection MUST be full-duplex, point to point, and it MAY be either\n   dedicated
    (i.e. permanent, set up by provisioning) or switched (set\n   up on demand).  In
    addition, the PPP/AAL5 service interface boundary\n   MUST meet the following
    requirements:\n        Interface Format - The PPP/AAL5 layer boundary presents
    an octet\n        service interface to the AAL5 layer.  There is no provision
    for\n        sub-octets to be supplied or accepted.\n        Transmission Rate
    - The PPP layer does not impose any\n        restrictions regarding transmission
    rate or the underlying ATM\n        layer traffic descriptor parameters.\n        Control
    Signals - The AAL5 layer MUST provide control signals to\n        the PPP layer
    which indicate when the virtual connection link\n        has become connected
    or disconnected.  These provide the \"Up\"\n        and\n        \"Down\" events
    to the LCP state machine [1] within the PPP layer.\n"

  - "4. Multi-Protocol Encapsulation\n   This specification uses the principles, terminology,
    and frame\n   structure described in \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM\n
    \  Adaptation Layer 5\" [4].\n   The purpose of this specification is not to document
    what is already\n   standardized in [4], but to specify how the mechanisms described
    in\n   [4] are to be used to map PPP onto an AAL5-based  ATM network.\n   Section
    1 within [4] defines the two mechanisms for identifying the\n   Protocol Data
    Unit (PDU) payload field's protocol type: virtual\n   circuit based multiplexing,
    and Logical Link Control (LLC)\n   encapsulation.  In the former technique, the
    payload's protocol type\n   is implicitly agreed to by the end points for each
    virtual circuit\n   using provisioning or control plane procedures.  When using
    the LLC\n   encapsulation technique, the payload's protocol type is explicitly\n
    \  identified on a per PDU basis by an in-band LLC header, followed by\n   the
    payload data.\n   When transporting a PPP payload over AAL5, an implementation:\n
    \       1. MUST support virtual circuit multiplexed PPP payloads as\n        described
    in section 5 below by mutual configuration or\n        negotiation of both end
    points.  This technique is referred to\n        as \"VC-multiplexed PPP\".\n        2.
    MUST support LLC encapsulated PPP payloads on PVCs as\n        described in section
    6 below by mutual configuration or\n        negotiation of both end points.  This
    technique is referred to\n        as \"LLC encapsulated PPP\".\n        3. For
    SVC set up, an implementation MUST negotiate using the\n        Q.2931 [9] Annex
    C procedure, encoding the Broadband Lower Layer\n        Interface (B-LLI) information
    element to signal either VC-\n        multiplexed PPP or LLC encapsulated PPP.
    \ The details of this\n        control plane procedure are described in section
    7.\n   If an implementation is connecting through a Frame Relay/ATM FRF.8\n   [7]
    service inter-working unit to an RFC 1973 [6] end point, then it\n   MUST use
    LLC encapsulated PPP payloads.  Frame Relay/ATM FRF.8\n   inter-working units
    are exempted from the requirement to support VC-\n   multiplexed PPP.  This exemption
    allows the FR/ATM IWU to remain\n   compliant with FRF.8 when the PPP over AAL5
    end point is inter-\n   operating with an RFC 1973 end point.\n"

- contents:
  - "7. Out-Of-Band Control Plane Signaling\n   When originating a switched virtual
    circuit AAL5 connection, the\n   caller MUST request in the SETUP message either
    VC-multiplexed PPP,\n   LLC-encapsulated PPP, or else both VC-multiplexed and
    LLC-\n   encapsulated PPP.  When a caller is offering both techniques, the two\n
    \  B-LLI IEs are encoded within a Broadband Repeat Indicator IE in the\n   order
    of their preference.  The called implementation MUST be able to\n   accept an
    incoming call that offers LLC-encapsulated PPP in the\n   caller's request.  The
    called implementation MUST reject a call set\n   up request that only offers an
    encapsulation that it does not\n   support.  Implementations originating a call
    offering both protocol\n   encapsulation techniques MUST be able to negotiate
    the use of LLC-\n   encapsulated PPP.\n   When originating a virtual circuit multiplexed
    call that is to carry\n   a PPP payload, the ITU Q.2931 [9] B-LLI element user
    information\n   layer 3 protocol field is encoded to select ISO/IEC TR 9577 [5]
    in\n   octet 7.  The extension octets specify an IPI value of PPP (0xCF).\n   By
    definition, the first bytes of the AAL5 frame's payload field will\n   always
    contain a PPP header followed by a packet.\n   When originating an LLC encapsulated
    call that is to carry a PPP\n   payload, the ITU Q.2931 B-LLI element user information
    layer 2\n   protocol field is encoded to select LAN Logical Link Control\n   (ISO/IEC8802-2)
    in octet 6.  See RFC 1755 [8] appendix A for an\n   example.  By definition, the
    first bytes of the AAL5 frame's payload\n   field will contain an LLC header,
    followed by a NLPID and the PPP\n   payload.\n"

  - "8. Detection And Recovery From Unsolicited PPP Encapsulation Transitions\n   When
    the virtual connection loses state, the PPP encapsulation\n   technique may uni-laterally
    and unexpectedly change across such\n   transitions.  Detection and recovery procedures
    are defined for the\n   following state transitions:\n        VC-multiplexed PPP
    changing to LLC encapsulated PPP\n        LLC encapsulated PPP changing to VC-multiplexed
    PPP\n   When LLC-encapsulated PPP is being used, the inital 6 octets of the\n
    \  LCP packets contain the sequence: fe-fe-03-cf-c0-21.  This sequence\n   constitutes
    the first 6 octets of the AAL5 frame.  In the case of\n   VC-multiplexed PPP,
    initial LCP packets contain the sequence c0-21.\n   This sequence constitutes
    the first 2 octets of an AAL5 frame.  When\n   a LCP Configure-Request packet
    is received and recognized, the PPP\n   link enters Link Establishment phase.\n
    \  Once PPP has entered the Network-layer Protocol phase, and\n   successfully
    negotiated a particular NCP for a PPP Protocol, if a\n   frame arrives using an
    alternate but equivalent data encapsulation as\n   defined in [4], then the PPP
    Link MUST:\n        For a SVC, immediately clear the call with the cause value
    111,\n        \"protocol error, unspecified\".\n        For a PVC: tear down the
    active NCPs, SHOULD generate an error\n        message, enter the Termination
    state, and silently drop all\n        received packets.\n   These policies prevent
    \"black-holes\" that occur when the peer loses\n   state.  An implementation which
    requires PPP link configuration, and\n   other PPP negotiated features (such as
    authentication), MAY enter\n   Termination state when configuration fails.\n"

  - "9. LCP Configuration Options\n   The Magic Number LCP configuration option is
    RECOMMENDED, and the\n   Protocol Field Compression (PFC) option is NOT RECOMMENDED.
    \ An\n   implementation MUST NOT request any of the following options, and\n   MUST
    reject a request for such an option:\n        Field Check Sequence (FCS) Alternatives,\n
    \       Address-and-Control-Field-Compression (ACFC),\n        Asynchronous-Control-Character-Map
    (ACCM)\n   The Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU) option MUST NOT be negotiated to a\n
    \  larger size than the maximum CPCS-SDU size specified in the\n   associated
    direction for the virtual connection's traffic contract.\n   When viewed peer
    to peer, a PPP link may be bridged over multiple\n   physical layer sections.
    \ For each such AAL5 section, the LCP framing\n   options MUST be actively negotiated
    by the bridging convertors\n   independently of the LCP framing options in use
    by other physical\n   layer sections.\n   Implementation Note:\n        When an
    ATM AAL5 PVC is in the \"Stopped\" state, it is\n        RECOMMENDED that the
    implementation wait for Configure-Requests.\n        See the implementation option
    in reference [1] section 4.2, the\n        \"Stopped State\" sub-section.\n"

  - "10. Security Considerations\n   Generally, ATM networks are virtual circuit based,
    and security is\n   implicit in the public data networking service provider's\n
    \  administration of Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) between the\n   network
    boundaries.  The probability of a security breach caused by\n   mis-routed ATM
    cells is considered to be negligible.\n   When a public ATM network supports Switched
    Virtual Circuits, the\n   protocol model becomes analogous to traditional voice
    band modem dial\n   up over the Public Telephone Switched Network (PTSN).  The
    same\n   PAP/CHAP authentication protocols that are already widely in use for\n
    \  Internet dial up access are leveraged.  As a consequence, PPP over\n   AAL5
    security is at parity with those practices already established\n   by the existing
    Internet infrastructure.\n   Those applications that require stronger security
    are encouraged to\n   use authentication headers, or encrypted payloads, and/or
    ATM-layer\n   security services.\n   When using LLC-encapsulated PPP over a virtual
    connection, an end\n   point can not assume that the PPP session authentication
    and related\n   security mechanisms also secure the other LLC encapsulated flows
    on\n   that same virtual connection.\n"
