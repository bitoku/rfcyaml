Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
This document defines an extension to the GBOND MIB module with a set of objects for managing Ethernet based multi pair bonded Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL) interfaces, as defined in ITU T Recommendation G.998.2.
Multi Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/Ethernet, is specified in ITU T Recommendation G.998.2 [G.998.2], which defines a method for bonding (or aggregating)
multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical link carrying Ethernet traffic.
The MIB module defined in this document provides G.Bond/ Ethernet specific objects for the management of G.998.2 bonded interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in the GBOND
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding
This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR 159], defining a management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces Group MIB (IF MIB), G.Bond MIB (GBOND MIB), and Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM)
Copper MIB (EFM CU MIB).
Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module
A G.Bond/Ethernet port is a private case of a bonded multi pair xDSL interface and as such is managed using generic interface management objects defined in the IF MIB
In particular, an interface index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/Ethernet ports, as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.
Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module
The GBOND MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for all bonded multi pair xDSL interfaces.
In particular, it describes the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration, handshake based discovery, initialization sequence, etc.
Both the GBOND MIB [RFC6765] and G9982 MIB (this document)
modules are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/Ethernet port.
All G.998 protocols share a remote Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) discovery, using the [G.994.1] handshake (G.hs).
The GBOND MIB module provides an example of an automatic BCE connection to the corresponding Generic Bonding Sub layer (GBS) ports of a generic G.998 multi port Central Office (CO) device, using G.hs based BCE discovery.
Amendment 2 to the ITU T G.998.2 specification [G.998.2 Amd2] provides an alternative optional Bonding Aggregation Control Protocol (BACP) for in service discovery, aggregation, and pair management.
The following pseudocode gives the same example of the discovery and automatic BCE assignment for a multi GBS G.Bond/Eth CO device, using BACP objects defined in this MIB module, as well as the IF CAP STACK MIB [RFC5066] and IF MIB modules.
Note that automatic BCE assignment is only shown here for the purposes of the example.
Fixed BCE pre assignment, manual assignment, or auto assignment using an alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a particular implementation: //
Perform discovery and auto assignment on GBS ports //
with room for more channels.
Get Eligible Group ID and Remote Group ID // from a connected BCE (during BACP // initialization, each BCE is connected to its own GBS)
Go over all disconnected channels, which can // potentially be connected to the GBS FOREACH bce[j] IN ifCapStackTable[gbs[i]]
Read the Remote Group ID for the selected BCE // and compare it with the Remote Group ID of the connected // BCE.
The Remote Terminal device (RT) connected via BCE[j] is
and there is room for another BCE in //
the GBS[i] aggregation group (max.
Connect this BCE to the GBS (via the ifStackTable;
the // ifInvStackTable, which is the inverse of the // ifStackTable, is updated automatically; i.e., gbs[i] is //
At this point, we have discovered all local BCEs that // are physically connected to the same RT // and have connected them to GBS[i].
Go to the next GBS.
When BACP is used, the g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID object identifying bonding eligibility MUST be automatically updated whenever the ifCapStackTable/ifInvCapStackTable are changed.
The EFM CU MIB module [RFC5066] defines objects for managing Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces 10PASS TS and 2BASE TL, as defined in IEEE Std
These interfaces are based on Single pair High speed DSL (SHDSL) [G.991.2] and Very high speed DSL (VDSL)
[G.993.1] technology, respectively, and can be optionally aggregated (bonded).
The ITU T G.998.2 specification extends the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61 bonding to work over any xDSL technology, providing the ability to bond individual channels as well as physical lines.
It also allows the use of alternative High level Data Link Control (HDLC) encapsulation instead of the default 64/65 octet encapsulation and adds a new optional Bonding Aggregation Control Protocol (BACP) for in service discovery, aggregation, and pair management instead of the default G.hs based bonding protocol, which cannot be used in service, while the link is 'up'.
EFM CU MIB can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu physical interfaces (PHYs), including complete (within the scope of the 802.3 standard) management of the SHDSL/VDSL lines.
The GBOND MIB and G9982 MIB modules, on the other hand, provide management objects only for the bonding part, leaving the management of the individual xDSL interfaces (lines/channels) to the respective xDSL LINE MIB modules.
Therefore, an IEEE 802.3 2BASE TL/10PASS TS interface can be managed by either combination of the following MIB modules: IF MIB
MAU MIB   EFM CU MIB IF MIB   IF CAP STACK MIB   GBOND MIB
HDSL2 SHDSL LINE MIB/VDSL LINE MIB
(The EtherLike MIB, HDSL2 SHDSL LINE MIB, and VDSL LINE MIB modules are found in [RFC3635], [RFC4319], and [RFC3728], respectively.)
Note also that while EFM CU MIB relies on the ifMauMediaAvailable object from MAU MIB [RFC4836] for the additional bonded xDSL specific operational states, GBOND MIB provides these indications via the gBondPortStatFltStatus object, complementing the ifOperStatus object from the IF MIB.
Finally, the EFM CU MIB does not include historical Performance Monitoring (PM), while the GBOND MIB/G9982 MIB/
LINE MIB combination provides full PM functionality for a bonded link and individual xDSL lines.
The IEEE 802.3 working group chartered a task force [IEEE802.3.1], which continues the development of standard Ethernet related MIB modules based on the initial work done in the IETF.
Future projects resulting from the work of this task force may include and possibly extend the work done in the IETF.
The main management objects defined in the G9982 MIB module are split into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
g9982Port containing objects for configuration, capabilities, status, and PM of G.Bond/Eth ports.
Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonding Sub layer (GBS) port configuration, capabilities, status, notifications, and PM are located in the GBOND MIB module.
g9982Bce containing objects representing OPTIONAL status information and BACP configuration for each Bonding Channel Entity (BCE).
Note that the rest of the objects for the BCE configuration, capabilities, status, and notifications are located in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as well as in the GBOND MIB module.
Performance Monitoring The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history buckets (interval counters), similar to those defined in [TR 159],
are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3705].
PerfHist TC MIB defines 64 bit versions of the textual conventions found in PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3593].
The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen  minute boundary of a wall clock.
Likewise, the beginning of each one day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when a GBS is re initialized, but rather only when the agent is reset or re initialized.
Mapping of Broadband Forum TR 159 Managed Objects
This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects (attributes) defined in [TR 159] and the managed objects defined in this document.
Mapping of TR 159 Managed Objects Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR 159 and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one to one; for example, while TR 159 PM attributes aGroupPerf  map to the corresponding gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, there are no dedicated PM attributes for the g9982PortPm  objects introduced in this MIB module.
However, since their definition is identical to the definition of gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, we can map g9982PortPm  to the relevant aGroupPerf  attributes of TR 159 and use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping is not one to one.

SEQUENCE OF G9982BceConfEntry MAX ACCESS
current DESCRIPTION "Table for configuration of G.Bond/Eth specific aspects for the Bonding Channel Entity (BCE) ports (modems/channels).
Entries in this table MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
An entry in the G.Bond/Eth BCE Configuration table.
Each entry represents G.998.2 specific aspects of a BCE port indexed by the ifIndex.
Note that a G.Bond/Eth BCE port can be stacked below a single GBS port, also indexed by the ifIndex.
A universally unique 6 octet long identifier, used by the OPTIONAL BACP, to determine bonding eligibility.
When two BCEs have the same g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID on a system, they are eligible to be aggregated on that system.
Typically, all BCEs on a BTU R device would be assigned the same g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID, to assert that all of the BCEs should be in the same bonded group.
BCEs with different g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID values MUST NOT be connected to the same GBS.
BCEs with the same g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID MAY be connected to different GBS ports.
This object MUST be instantiated during BACP initialization, when every BCE belongs to its own GBS.
Attempts to change this object MUST be rejected (with the error inconsistentValue), if the BCE is aggregated with other BCEs, i.e., more than one BCE is connected to the same GBS, or if the BCE in question is not eligible to be bonded with other BCEs having the same value (e.g., the bonding is limited to a single line card and BCEs are located on different line cards, or BCEs are the channels of the same line).
Note that bonding eligibility is reflected in the ifCapStackTable and its inverse, the ifInvCapStackTable; as such, any modification of g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID MUST be reflected in these tables.
A zero length octet string SHALL be returned on an attempt to read this object on systems not supporting BACP (the value of g9982PortCapBacpSupported for the connected GBS is false).
This object maps to the TR 159 attribute aChannelEligibleGroupID.
A universally unique 6 octet long identifier, used by the OPTIONAL BACP, to determine bonding eligibility.
BCEs with different g9982BceConfPeerEligibleGroupID values MUST NOT be connected to the same GBS.
BCEs with the same g9982BceConfPeerEligibleGroupID MAY be connected to different GBS ports.
A zero length octet string SHALL be returned on an attempt to read this object on systems not supporting BACP (the value of g9982PortCapBacpSupported for the connected GBS is false) or when no BACPDUs have been received from the peer BCE.
This object maps to the G.998.2 Amd2 attribute Remote Group ID.
"This table provides common status information of G.Bond/Eth BCE ports.
This table contains live data from the equipment.
As such, it is NOT persistent."
{ g9982Bce 2 } g9982BceStatEntry OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
An entry in the G.Bond/Eth BCE Status table.
Each entry represents common aspects of a G.Bond/Eth BCE port indexed by the ifIndex.
Note that a BCE port can be stacked below a single GBS port, also indexed by the ifIndex, possibly together with other BCE ports.

g9982PortConfTcAdminType MIN ACCESS  read only DESCRIPTION
"Write access is not required (needed only for GBS supporting more than a single TC encapsulation type, i.e., tc6465 and tcHDLC)."
MIN ACCESS  read only DESCRIPTION
"Write access is not required (needed only for GBS supporting BACP in addition to mandatory G.hs based bonding discovery and aggregation protocol)."
There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  Changing of g9982PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g., g9982PortConfTcAdminType)
may lead to a complete service interruption in cases where the specified PTM TC encapsulation type is not supported by the remote end.
Changing of g9982BceConfTable configuration parameters (e.g., g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID) may lead to preventing a non bonded BCE from being bonded in any bonding group, or false advertisement of bonding eligibility (e.g., between BCEs residing on different line cards in an application that does not support cross card bonding).
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they provide information about the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of their configuration.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
g9982PortStatTable objects in this table (e.g., g9982PortStatTcOperType) provide status information for the G.Bond port, which may aid in deciphering of the G.Bond/ETH transmissions.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
