- title: 3. Questions About the Internet
  contents:
  - "3. Questions About the Internet\n   3.1  What is the Internet?\n      The Internet\
    \ is a collection of thousands of networks linked by a\n      common set of technical\
    \ protocols which make it possible for users\n      of any one of the networks\
    \ to communicate with or use the services\n      located on any of the other networks.\
    \  These protocols are\n      referred to as TCP/IP or the TCP/IP protocol suite.\
    \  The Internet\n      started with the ARPANET, but now includes such networks\
    \ as the\n      National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), the Australian\n\
    \      Academic and Research Network (AARNet), the NASA Science Internet\n   \
    \   (NSI), the Swiss Academic and Research Network (SWITCH), and about\n     \
    \ 10,000 other large and small, commercial and research, networks.\n      There\
    \ are other major wide area networks that are not based on the\n      TCP/IP protocols\
    \ and are thus often not considered part of the\n      Internet.  However, it\
    \ is possible to communicate between them and\n      the Internet via electronic\
    \ mail because of mail gateways that act\n      as \"translators\" between the\
    \ different network protocols involved.\n      Note: You will often see \"internet\"\
    \ with a small \"i\".  This could\n      refer to any network built based on TCP/IP,\
    \ or might refer to\n      networks using other protocol families that are composites\
    \ built\n      of smaller networks.\n      See FYI 20 (RFC 1462), \"FYI on 'What\
    \ is the Internet?'\" for a\n      lengthier description of the Internet [13].\n\
    \   3.2  I just got on the Internet.  What can I do now?\n      You now have access\
    \ to all the resources you are authorized to use\n      on your own Internet host,\
    \ on any other Internet host on which you\n      have an account, and on any other\
    \ Internet host that offers\n      publicly accessible information.  The Internet\
    \ gives you the\n      ability to move information between these hosts via file\n\
    \      transfers.  Once you are logged into one host, you can use the\n      Internet\
    \ to open a connection to another, login, and use its\n      services interactively\
    \ (this is known as remote login or\n      \"TELNETing\").  In addition, you can\
    \ send electronic mail to users\n      at any Internet site and to users on many\
    \ non-Internet sites that\n      are accessible via electronic mail.\n      There\
    \ are various other services you can use.  For example, some\n      hosts provide\
    \ access to specialized databases or to archives of\n      information.  The Internet\
    \ Resource Guide provides information\n      regarding some of these sites.  The\
    \ Internet Resource Guide lists\n      facilities on the Internet that are available\
    \ to users.  Such\n      facilities include supercomputer centers, library catalogs\
    \ and\n      specialized data collections.  The guide is maintained by the\n \
    \     Directory Services portion of the InterNIC and is available online\n   \
    \   in a number of ways.  It is available for anonymous FTP from the\n      host\
    \ ds.internic.net in the resource-guide directory.  It is also\n      readable\
    \ via the InterNIC gopher (gopher internic.net).  For more\n      information,\
    \ contact admin@ds.internic.net or call the InterNIC at\n      (800) 444-4345\
    \ or (908) 668-6587.\n      Today the trend for Internet information services\
    \ is to strive to\n      present the users with a friendly interface to a variety\
    \ of\n      services.  The goal is to reduce the traditional needs for a user\n\
    \      to know the source host of a service and the different command\n      interfaces\
    \ for different types of services.  The Internet Gopher\n      (discussed more\
    \ in the \"Questions about Internet Services\"\n      section) is one such service\
    \ to which you have access when you\n      join the Internet.\n   3.3  How do\
    \ I find out if a site has a computer on the Internet?\n      Frankly, it's almost\
    \ impossible to find out if a site has a\n      computer on the Internet by querying\
    \ some Internet service itself.\n      The most reliable way is to ask someone\
    \ at the site you are\n      interested in contacting.\n      It is sometimes\
    \ possible to find whether or not a site has been\n      assigned an IP network\
    \ number, which is a prerequisite for\n      connecting an IP network to the Internet\
    \ (which is only one type\n      of Internet access).  To do so, query the WHOIS\
    \ database,\n      maintained by the Registration Services portion of the InterNIC.\n\
    \      You have several options about how to do such a query.  The most\n    \
    \  common currently are to TELNET to the host rs.internic.net and\n      invoke\
    \ one of the search interfaces provided, or to run a WHOIS\n      client locally\
    \ on your machine and use it to make a query across\n      the network.\n    \
    \  The RIPE Network Coordination Center (RIPE NCC) also maintains a\n      large\
    \ database of sites to whom they have assigned IP network\n      numbers.  You\
    \ can query it by TELNETing to info.ripe.net and\n      stepping through the interactive\
    \ interface they provide.\n   3.4  How do I get a list of all the hosts on the\
    \ Internet?\n      You really don't want that.  The list includes more than 1.5\n\
    \      million hosts.  Almost all of them require that you have access\n     \
    \ permission to actually use them.  You may really want to know\n      which of\
    \ these hosts provide services to the Internet community.\n      Investigate using\
    \ some of the network resource discovery tools,\n      such as gopher, to gain\
    \ easier access to Internet information.\n"
- title: 4. Questions About TCP/IP
  contents:
  - "4. Questions About TCP/IP\n   4.1  What is TCP/IP?\n      TCP/IP (Transmission\
    \ Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) [4,5,6]\n      is the common name for a\
    \ family of over 100 data-communications\n      protocols used to organize computers\
    \ and data-communications\n      equipment into computer networks.  TCP/IP was\
    \ developed to\n      interconnect hosts on ARPANET, PRNET (packet radio), and\
    \ SATNET\n      (packet satellite).  All three of these networks have since been\n\
    \      retired; but TCP/IP lives on.  It is currently used on a large\n      international\
    \ network of networks called the Internet, whose\n      members include universities,\
    \ other research institutions,\n      government facilities, and many corporations.\
    \  TCP/IP is also\n      sometimes used for other networks, particularly local\
    \ area\n      networks that tie together numerous different kinds of computers\n\
    \      or tie together engineering workstations.\n   4.2  What are the other well-known\
    \ standard protocols in the TCP/IP\n        family?\n      Other than TCP and\
    \ IP, the three main protocols in the TCP/IP\n      suite are the Simple Mail\
    \ Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [8], the File\n      Transfer Protocol (FTP) [3], and\
    \ the TELNET Protocol [9].  There\n      are many other protocols in use on the\
    \ Internet.  The Internet\n      Architecture Board (IAB) regularly publishes\
    \ an RFC [2] that\n      describes the state of standardization of the various\
    \ Internet\n      protocols.  This document is the best guide to the current status\n\
    \      of Internet protocols and their recommended usage.\n"
- title: 5.  Questions About the Domain Name System
  contents:
  - "5.  Questions About the Domain Name System\n   5.1  What is the Domain Name System?\n\
    \      The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed method\n  \
    \    of organizing the name space of the Internet.  The DNS\n      administratively\
    \ groups hosts into a hierarchy of authority that\n      allows addressing and\
    \ other information to be widely distributed\n      and maintained.  A big advantage\
    \ to the DNS is that using it\n      eliminates dependence on a centrally-maintained\
    \ file that maps\n      host names to addresses.\n   5.2  What is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name?\n      A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is a domain name that\n\
    \      includes all higher level domains relevant to the entity named.\n     \
    \ If you think of the DNS as a tree-structure with each node having\n      its\
    \ own label, a Fully Qualified Domain Name for a specific node\n      would be\
    \ its label followed by the labels of all the other nodes\n      between it and\
    \ the root of the tree.  For example, for a host, a\n      FQDN would include\
    \ the string that identifies the particular host,\n      plus all domains of which\
    \ the host is a part up to and including\n      the top-level domain (the root\
    \ domain is always null).  For\n      example, atlas.arc.nasa.gov is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name for\n      the host at 128.102.128.50.  In addition, arc.nasa.gov\
    \ is the FQDN\n      for the Ames Research Center (ARC) domain under nasa.gov.\n"
- title: 6. Questions About Internet Documentation
  contents:
  - "6. Questions About Internet Documentation\n   6.1  What is an RFC?\n      The\
    \ Request for Comments documents (RFCs) are working notes of the\n      Internet\
    \ research and development community.  A document in this\n      series may be\
    \ on essentially any topic related to computer\n      communication, and may be\
    \ anything from a meeting report to the\n      specification of a standard.  Submissions\
    \ for Requests for\n      Comments may be sent to the RFC Editor (RFC-EDITOR@ISI.EDU).\
    \  The\n      RFC Editor is Jon Postel.\n      Most RFCs are the descriptions\
    \ of network protocols or services,\n      often giving detailed procedures and\
    \ formats for their\n      implementation.  Other RFCs report on the results of\
    \ policy\n      studies or summarize the work of technical committees or\n   \
    \   workshops.  All RFCs are considered public domain unless\n      explicitly\
    \ marked otherwise.\n      While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\n\
    \      technical review from either the task forces, individual technical\n  \
    \    experts, or the RFC Editor, as appropriate.  Currently, most\n      standards\
    \ are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n      Anyone\
    \ can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\n      Submissions must be\
    \ made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.\n      Please consult RFC 1543,\
    \ \"Instructions to RFC Authors\" [10], for\n      further information.  RFCs\
    \ are accessible online in public access\n      files, and a short message is\
    \ sent to a notification distribution\n      list indicating the availability\
    \ of the memo.  Requests to be\n      added to this distribution list should be\
    \ sent to RFC-\n      REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n      The online files are copied\
    \ by interested people and printed or\n      displayed at their sites on their\
    \ equipment.  (An RFC may also be\n      returned via electronic mail in response\
    \ to an electronic mail\n      query.) This means that the format of the online\
    \ files must meet\n      the constraints of a wide variety of printing and display\n\
    \      equipment.\n      Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published,\
    \ that RFC\n      is never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is\n\
    \      never a question of having the most recent version of a particular\n  \
    \    RFC.  However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP))\n      may\
    \ be improved and re-documented many times in several different\n      RFCs. \
    \ It is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC\n      on a particular\
    \ protocol.  The \"Internet Official Protocol\n      Standards\" [2] memo is the\
    \ reference for determining the correct\n      RFC to refer to for the current\
    \ specification of each protocol.\n   6.2  How do I obtain RFCs?\n      RFCs are\
    \ available online at several repositories around the\n      world.  For a list\
    \ of repositories and instructions about how to\n      obtain RFCs from each of\
    \ the major U.S. ones, send a message to\n      rfc-info@isi.edu.  As the text\
    \ of the message, type\n      \"help: ways_to_get_rfcs\" (without the quotes).\n\
    \      An example of obtaining RFCs online follows.\n      RFCs can be obtained\
    \ via FTP from ds.internic.net with the\n      pathname rfc/rfcNNNN.txt (where\
    \ \"NNNN\" refers to the number of the\n      RFC).  Login using FTP, username\
    \ \"anonymous\" and your email\n      address as password.  The Directory Services\
    \ portion of the\n      InterNIC also makes RFCs available via electronic mail,\
    \ WAIS, and\n      gopher.\n      To obtain RFCs via electronic mail, send a mail\
    \ message to\n      mailserv@ds.internic.net and include any of the following\
    \ commands\n      in the message body:\n         document-by-name rfcnnnn    \
    \  where 'nnnn' is the RFC number\n                                       The\
    \ text version is sent.\n         file /ftp/rfc/rfcnnnn.yyy     where 'nnnn' is\
    \ the RFC number.\n                                       and 'yyy' is 'txt' or\
    \ 'ps'.\n         help                          to get information on how to use\n\
    \                                       the mailserver.\n   6.3  How do I obtain\
    \ a list of RFCs?\n      Several sites make an index of RFCs available.  These\
    \ sites are\n      indicated in the ways_to_get_rfcs file mentioned above and\
    \ in the\n      next question.\n   6.4  What is the RFC-INFO service?\n      The\
    \ Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern\n      California (ISI)\
    \ has a service called RFC-INFO.  Even though this\n      is a service, rather\
    \ than a document, we'll discuss it in this\n      section because it is so closely\
    \ tied to RFC information.\n      RFC-INFO is an email based service to help in\
    \ locating and\n      retrieval of RFCs, FYIs, STDs, and IMRs.  Users can ask\
    \ for\n      \"lists\" of all RFCs and FYIs having certain attributes (\"filters\"\
    )\n      such as their ID, keywords, title, author, issuing organization,\n  \
    \    and date.  Once an RFC is uniquely identified (e.g., by its RFC\n      number)\
    \ it may also be retrieved.\n      To use the service, send email to: RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU\
    \ with your\n      requests as the text of the message.  Feel free to put anything\
    \ in\n      the SUBJECT, the system ignores it.  All input is case\n      independent.\
    \  Report problems to: RFC-MANAGER@ISI.EDU.\n      To get started, you may send\
    \ a message to RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU with\n      requests such as in the following\
    \ examples (without the\n      explanations between brackets):\n      Help: Help\

    \ types.  It\n      is updated periodically; make sure you are referring to the\
    \ most\n      recent version.  In addition, the RFC Index maintained at the\n\
    \      ds.internic.net repository notes the status of each RFC listed.\n   6.6\
    \  What is an FYI?\n      FYI stands for For Your Information.  FYIs are a subset\
    \ of the RFC\n      series of online documents.\n      FYI 1 states, \"The FYI\
    \ series of notes is designed to provide\n      Internet users with a central\
    \ repository of information about any\n      topics which relate to the Internet.\
    \  FYI topics may range from\n      historical memos on 'Why it was was done this\
    \ way' to answers to\n      commonly asked operational questions.  The FYIs are\
    \ intended for a\n      wide audience.  Some FYIs will cater to beginners, while\
    \ others\n      will discuss more advanced topics.\"\n      In general, then,\
    \ FYI documents tend to be more information\n      oriented, while RFCs are usually\
    \ (but not always) more technically\n      oriented.\n      FYI documents are\
    \ assigned both an FYI number and an RFC number.\n      As RFCs, if an FYI is\
    \ ever updated, it is issued again with a new\n      RFC number; however, its\
    \ FYI number remains unchanged.  This can\n      be a little confusing at first,\
    \ but the aim is to help users\n      identify which FYIs are about which topics.\
    \  For example, FYI 4\n      will always be FYI 4, even though it may be updated\
    \ several times\n      and during that process receive different RFC numbers.\
    \  Thus, you\n      need only to remember the FYI number to find the proper document.\n\
    \      Of course, remembering titles often works as well.\n      FYIs can be obtained\
    \ in the same way RFCs can and from the same\n      repositories.  In general,\
    \ their pathnames are fyi/fyiNN.txt or\n      fyi/fyiNN.ps, where NN is the number\
    \ of the FYI without leading\n      zeroes.\n   6.7  What is an STD?\n      The\
    \ newest subseries of RFCs are the STDs (Standards).  RFC 1311\n      [12], which\
    \ introduces this subseries, states that the intent of\n      STDs is to identify\
    \ clearly those RFCs that document Internet\n      standards.  An STD number will\
    \ be assigned only to those\n      specifications that have completed the full\
    \ process of\n      standardization in the Internet.  Existing Internet standards\
    \ have\n      been assigned STD numbers; a list of them can be found both in RFC\n\
    \      1311 and in the, \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\" RFC.\n      Like\
    \ FYIs, once a standard has been assigned an STD number, that\n      number will\
    \ not change, even if the standard is reworked and re-\n      specified and later\
    \ issued with a new RFC number.\n      It is important to differentiate between\
    \ a \"standard\" and\n      \"document\".  Different RFC documents will always\
    \ have different\n      RFC numbers.  However, sometimes the complete specification\
    \ for a\n      standard will be contained in more than one RFC document.  When\n\
    \      this happens, each of the RFC documents that is part of the\n      specification\
    \ for that standard will carry the same STD number.\n      For example, the Domain\
    \ Name System (DNS) is specified by the\n      combination of RFC 1034 and RFC\
    \ 1035; therefore, both of those\n      RFCs are labeled STD 13.\n   6.8  What\
    \ is the Internet Monthly Report?\n      The Internet Monthly Report (IMR) communicates\
    \ online to the\n      Internet community the accomplishments, milestones reached,\
    \ or\n      problems discovered by the participating organizations.  Many\n  \
    \    organizations involved in the Internet provide monthly updates of\n     \
    \ their activities for inclusion in this report.  The IMR is for\n      Internet\
    \ information purposes only.\n      You can receive the report online by joining\
    \ the mailing list that\n      distributes the report.  Requests to be added or\
    \ deleted from the\n      Internet Monthly Report list should be sent to \"imr-\n\
    \      request@isi.edu\".\n      In addition, back issues of the Report are available\
    \ for anonymous\n      FTP from the host ftp.isi.edu in the in-notes/imr directory,\
    \ with\n      the file names in the form imryymm.txt, where yy is the last two\n\
    \      digits of the year and mm two digits for the month.  For example,\n   \
    \   the July 1992 Report is in the file imr9207.txt.\n   6.9  What is an Internet\
    \ Draft?  Are there any guidelines available\n        for writing one?\n     \
    \ Internet Drafts (I-Ds) are the current working documents of the\n      IETF.\
    \  Internet Drafts are generally in the format of an RFC with\n      some key\
    \ differences:\n         -  The Internet Drafts are not RFCs and are not a numbered\n\
    \            document series.\n         -  The words INTERNET-DRAFT appear in\
    \ place of RFC XXXX\n            in the upper left-hand corner.\n         -  The\
    \ document does not refer to itself as an RFC or as a\n            Draft RFC.\n\
    \         -  An Internet Draft does not state nor imply that it is a\n       \
    \     proposed standard.  To do so conflicts with the role of\n            the\
    \ IAB, the RFC Editor, and the Internet Engineering\n            Steering Group\
    \ (IESG).\n      An Internet Drafts directory has been installed to make draft\n\
    \      documents available for review and comment by the IETF members.\n     \
    \ These draft documents that will ultimately be submitted to the IAB\n      and\
    \ the RFC Editor to be considered for publishing as RFCs.  The\n      Internet\
    \ Drafts Directories are maintained on several Internet\n      sites.  There are\
    \ several \"shadow\" machines which contain the IETF\n      and Internet Drafts\
    \ Directories.  They are:\n         West Coast (US) Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)\n\
    \         East Coast (US) Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)\n         Europe\

    \ (128.250.1.21)\n      To access these directories, use anonymous FTP.  Login\
    \ with\n      username \"anonymous\" and your email address as password (or\n\
    \      \"guest\" if that fails).  Once logged in, change to the desired\n    \
    \  directory with \"cd internet-drafts\".  Internet Draft files can\n      then\
    \ be retrieved.  Once logged in, if you change to the directory\n      \"ietf\"\
    , you can retrieve a file called \"1id-guidelines.txt\", which\n      explains\
    \ how to write and submit an Internet Draft.\n   6.10  How do I obtain OSI Standards\
    \ documents?\n      OSI Standards documents are NOT available from the Internet\
    \ via\n      anonymous FTP due to copyright restrictions.  These are available\n\
    \      from:\n         Omnicom Information Service\n         501 Church Street\

  - "7.  Questions about Internet Organizations and Contacts\n   7.1  What is the\
    \ IAB?\n      The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is concerned with technical\n\
    \      and policy issues involving the evolution of the Internet\n      architecture\
    \ [7].  IAB members are deeply committed to making the\n      Internet function\
    \ effectively and evolve to meet a large scale,\n      high speed future.  The\
    \ chairman serves a term of two years and is\n      elected by the members of\
    \ the IAB.  The IAB focuses on the TCP/IP\n      protocol suite, and extensions\
    \ to the Internet system to support\n      multiple protocol suites.\n      The\
    \ IAB performs the following functions:\n         1)   Reviews Internet Standards,\n\
    \         2)   Manages the RFC publication process,\n         3)   Reviews the\
    \ operation of the IETF and IRTF,\n         4)   Performs strategic planning for\
    \ the Internet, identifying\n              long-range problems and opportunities,\n\
    \         5)   Acts as an international technical policy liaison and\n       \
    \       representative for the Internet community, and\n         6)   Resolves\
    \ technical issues which cannot be treated within\n              the IETF or IRTF\
    \ frameworks.\n      The IAB has two principal subsidiary task forces:\n     \
    \    1)  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n         2)  Internet Research\
    \ Task Force (IRTF)\n      Each of these Task Forces is led by a chairman and\
    \ guided by a\n      Steering Group which reports to the IAB through its chairman.\
    \  For\n      the most part, a collection of Research or Working Groups carries\n\
    \      out the work program of each Task Force.\n      All decisions of the IAB\
    \ are made public.  The principal vehicle\n      by which IAB decisions are propagated\
    \ to the parties interested in\n      the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol suite\
    \ is the Request for\n      Comments (RFC) note series and the Internet Monthly\
    \ Report.\n   7.2  What is the IETF?\n      The Internet has grown to encompass\
    \ a large number of widely\n      geographically dispersed networks in academic\
    \ and research\n      communities.  It now provides an infrastructure for a broad\n\
    \      community with various interests.  Moreover, the family of\n      Internet\
    \ protocols and system components has moved from\n      experimental to commercial\
    \ development.  To help coordinate the\n      operation, management and evolution\
    \ of the Internet, the IAB\n      established the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF).\n      The IETF is a large open community of network designers,\n  \
    \    operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the Internet\n      and\
    \ the Internet protocol suite.  The activity is performed in a\n      number of\
    \ working groups organized around a set of several\n      technical areas, each\
    \ working group has a chair, and each area is\n      managed by a technical area\
    \ director.  The IETF overall is managed\n      by its chair and the Internet\
    \ Engineering Steering Group (IESG),\n      which is made up of the area directors.\n\
    \      The IAB has delegated to the IESG the general responsibility for\n    \
    \  the resolution of short- and mid-range protocol and architectural\n      issues\
    \ required to make the Internet function effectively, and the\n      development\
    \ of Internet standards.\n   7.3  What is the IRTF?\n      To promote research\
    \ in networking and the development of new\n      technology, the IAB established\
    \ the Internet Research Task Force\n      (IRTF).  The IRTF is a set of research\
    \ groups, generally with an\n      Internet focus.  The work of the IRTF is governed\
    \ by its Internet\n      Research Steering Group (IRSG).\n      In the area of\
    \ network protocols, the distinction between research\n      and engineering is\
    \ not always clear, so there will sometimes be\n      overlap between activities\
    \ of the IETF and the IRTF.  There is, in\n      fact, considerable overlap in\
    \ membership between the two groups.\n      This overlap is regarded as vital\
    \ for cross-fertilization and\n      technology transfer.\n   7.4  What is the\
    \ Internet Society?\n      The Internet Society is a relatively new, professional,\
    \ non-profit\n      organization with the general goal of fostering the well-being\
    \ and\n      continued interest in, and evolution and use of the Internet.  The\n\
    \      Society (often abbreviated ISOC) is integrating the IAB, IETF, and\n  \
    \    IRTF functions into its operation.\n      The following goals of the Society\
    \ are taken from its charter:\n         A.  To facilitate and support the technical\
    \ evolution of\n             the Internet as a research and education infrastructure,\n\
    \             and to stimulate the involvement of the scientific\n           \
    \  community, industry, government and others in the\n             evolution of\
    \ the Internet;\n         B.  To educate the scientific community, industry and\
    \ the\n             public at large concerning the technology, use and\n     \
    \        application of the Internet;\n         C.  To promote educational applications\
    \ of Internet\n             technology for the benefit of government, colleges\
    \ and\n             universities, industry, and the public at large;\n       \
    \  D.  To provide a forum for exploration of new Internet\n             applications,\
    \ and to stimulate collaboration among\n             organizations in their operational\
    \ use of the global\n             Internet.\n      More information about the\
    \ Internet Society is available for\n      anonymous FTP from the host: isoc.org\
    \ in the directory: isoc.\n      Information is also available via the ISOC gopher,\
    \ accessible via\n      \"gopher isoc.org\" if you are running a gopher client.\n\
    \   7.5  What is the IANA?\n      The task of coordinating the assignment of values\
    \ to the\n      parameters of protocols is delegated by the Internet Architecture\n\
    \      Board (IAB) to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n      These\
    \ protocol parameters include op-codes, type fields, terminal\n      types, system\
    \ names, object identifiers, and so on.  The \"Assigned\n      Numbers\" Request\
    \ for Comments (RFC) [1] documents the currently\n      assigned values from several\
    \ series of numbers used in network\n      protocol implementations.  Internet\
    \ addresses and Autonomous\n      System numbers are assigned by the Registration\
    \ Services portion\n      of the InterNIC.  The IANA is located at USC/Information\
    \ Sciences\n      Institute.\n      Current types of assignments listed in Assigned\
    \ Numbers and\n      maintained by the IANA are:\n         Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol Parameters\n         BOOTP Parameters and BOOTP Extension Codes\n \
    \        Character Sets\n         Domain System Parameters\n         Encoding\

    \      X.25 Type Numbers\n         XNS Protocol Types\n      For more information\
    \ on number assignments, contact: IANA@ISI.EDU.\n   7.6  What is a NIC?  What\
    \ is a NOC?\n      \"NIC\" stands for Network Information Center.  It is an\n\
    \      organization which provides network users with information about\n    \
    \  services provided by the network.\n      \"NOC\" stands for Network Operations\
    \ Center.  It is an organization\n      that is responsible for maintaining a\
    \ network.\n      For many networks, especially smaller, local networks, the\n\
    \      functions of the NIC and NOC are combined.  For larger networks,\n    \
    \  such as mid-level and backbone networks, the NIC and NOC\n      organizations\
    \ are separate, yet they do need to interact to fully\n      perform their functions.\n\
    \   7.7  What is the InterNIC?\n      The InterNIC is a five year project partially\
    \ supported by the\n      National Science Foundation to provide network information\n\
    \      services to the networking community.  The InterNIC began\n      operations\
    \ in April of 1993 and is a collaborative project of\n      three organizations:\
    \ General Atomics provides Information Services\n      from their location in\
    \ San Diego, CA; AT&T provides Directory and\n      Database Services from South\
    \ Plainsfield, NJ; and Network\n      Solutions, Inc. provides Registration Services\
    \ from their\n      headquarters in Herndon, VA.  Services are provided via the\n\
    \      network electronically, and by telephone, FAX, and hardcopy\n      documentation.\n\
    \      General Atomics offers Information Services acting as the \"NIC of\n  \
    \    first and last resort\" by providing a Reference Desk for new and\n     \
    \ experienced users, and midlevel and campus NICs.  The InterNIC\n      Reference\
    \ Desk offers introductory materials and pointers to\n      network resources\
    \ and tools.\n      AT&T services include the Directory of Directories, Directory\n\
    \      Services, and Database Services to store data available to all\n      Internet\
    \ users.\n      Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) provides Internet registration\n\
    \      services including IP address allocation, domain registration, and\n  \
    \    Autonomous System Number assignment.  NSI also tracks points of\n      contact\
    \ for networks and domain servers and provides online and\n      telephone support\
    \ for questions related to IP address or domain\n      name registration.\n  \
    \    All three portions of the InterNIC can be reached by calling (800)\n    \
    \  444-4345 or by sending a message to info@internic.net.  Callers\n      from\
    \ outside the U.S. can telephone +1 (619) 445-4600.  Extensive\n      online information\
    \ is available at host is.internic.net,\n      accessible via gopher or TELNET.\n\
    \   7.8  What is the DDN NIC (nic.ddn.mil)?\n      The DDN NIC is the Defense\
    \ Data Network NIC.  Until the formation\n      of the InterNIC, the DDN NIC had\
    \ been responsible for many\n      services to the whole Internet, especially\
    \ for registration\n      services.  Now the DDN NIC focuses on serving its primary\n\
    \      constituency of MILNET users.  Its host is nic.ddn.mil; the\n      address\
    \ hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil may still be in older Internet\n      registration documentation.\
    \  The DDN NIC maintains close ties to\n      the newer InterNIC.\n   7.9  What\
    \ is the IR?\n      The Internet Registry (IR) is the organization that is responsible\n\
    \      for assigning identifiers, such as IP network numbers and\n      autonomous\
    \ system numbers, to networks.  The IR also gathers and\n      registers such\
    \ assigned information.  The IR delegates some number\n      assignment authority\
    \ to regional registries (such as NCC@RIPE.NET\n      and APNIC-STAFF@APNIC.NET).\
    \  However, it will continue to gather\n      data regarding such assignments.\
    \  At present, the Registration\n      Services portion of the InterNIC at Network\
    \ Solutions, Inc.,\n      serves as the IR.\n"

  - "8. Questions About Services\n   8.1  How do I find someone's electronic mail\
    \ address?\n      There are a number of directories on the Internet; however,\
    \ all of\n      them are far from complete.  Many people can be found, however,\n\
    \      via the InterNIC WHOIS services, or KNOWBOT.  Generally, it is\n      still\
    \ necessary to ask the person for his or her email address.\n   8.2  How do I\
    \ use the WHOIS program at the InterNIC Registration\n        Services?\n    \
    \  There are several ways to search the WHOIS database.  You can\n      TELNET\
    \ to the InterNIC registration host, rs.internic.net.  There\n      is no need\
    \ to login.  Type \"whois\" to call up the information\n      retrieval program,\
    \ or choose one of the other options presented to\n      you.  Help is available\
    \ for each option.  You can also run a\n      client of the WHOIS server and point\
    \ it at any whois database\n      you'd like to search.  Pointing a client at\
    \ the whois server\n      ds.internic.net will enable you to query the databases\
    \ at three\n      hosts: ds.internic.net, rs.internic.net, and nic.ddn.mil.\n\
    \      For more information, contact the InterNIC at (800) 444-4345 or\n     \
    \ the registration services group at (703) 742-4777.\n   8.3  How do I use the\
    \ Knowbot Information Service?\n      The Knowbot Information Service is a white\
    \ pages \"meta-service\"\n      that provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous\
    \ white pages\n      services in the Internet.  Using the Knowbot Information\
    \ Service,\n      you can form a single query that can search for white pages\n\
    \      information from the NIC WHOIS service, the PSI White Pages Pilot\n   \
    \   Project, and MCI Mail, among others, and have the responses\n      displayed\
    \ in a single, uniform format.\n      Currently, the Knowbot Information Service\
    \ can be accessed through\n      TELNET to port 185 on hosts cnri.reston.va.us\
    \ and\n      sol.bucknell.edu.  From a UNIX host, use \"telnet cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \      185\".  There is also an electronic mail interface available by\n     \
    \ sending mail to netaddress at either cnri.reston.va.us or\n      sol.bucknell.edu.\n\
    \      The commands \"help\" and \"man\" summarize the command interface.\n  \
    \    Simply entering a user name at the prompt searches a default list\n     \
    \ of Internet directory services for the requested information.\n      Organization\
    \ and country information can be included through the\n      syntax: \"userid@organization.country\"\
    .  For example, the queries\n      \"droms@bucknell\" and \"kille@ucl.gb\" are\
    \ both valid.  Note that\n      these are not Domain Names, but rather a syntax\
    \ to specify an\n      organization and a country for the search.\n   8.4  What\
    \ is the White Pages at PSI?\n      Performance Systems International, Inc. (PSI),\
    \ sponsors a White\n      Pages Project that collects personnel information from\
    \ member\n      organizations into a database and provides online access to that\n\
    \      data.  This effort is based on the OSI X.500 Directory standard.\n    \
    \  To access the data, TELNET to WP.PSI.COM and login as \"fred\" (no\n      password\
    \ is necessary).  You may now look up information on\n      participating organizations.\
    \  The program provides help on usage.\n      For example, typing \"help\" will\
    \ show you a list of commands,\n      \"manual\" will give detailed documentation,\
    \ and \"whois\" will\n      provide information regarding how to find references\
    \ to people.\n      For a list of the organizations that are participating in\
    \ the\n      pilot project by providing information regarding their members,\n\
    \      type \"whois -org *\".\n      Access to the White Pages data is also possible\
    \ via programs that\n      act as X.500 Directory User Agent (DUA) clients.\n\
    \      For more information, send a message to WP-INFO@PSI.COM.\n   8.5  What\
    \ is USENET?  What is Netnews?\n      USENET is the formal name, and Netnews a\
    \ common informal name, for\n      a distributed computer information service\
    \ that some hosts on the\n      Internet use.  USENET handles only news and not\
    \ mail.  USENET uses\n      a variety of underlying networks for transport, including\
    \ parts of\n      the Internet, BITNET, and others.  Netnews can be a valuable\
    \ tool\n      to economically transport traffic that would otherwise be sent via\n\
    \      mail.  USENET has no central administration.\n   8.6  How do I get a Netnews\
    \ feed?\n      To get a Netnews feed, you must acquire the server software, which\n\
    \      is available for some computers at no cost from some anonymous FTP\n  \
    \    sites across the Internet, and you must find an existing USENET\n      site\
    \ that is willing to support a connection to your computer.  In\n      many cases,\
    \ this \"connection\" merely represents additional traffic\n      over existing\
    \ Internet access channels.\n      One well-known anonymous FTP archive site for\
    \ software and\n      information regarding USENET is ftp.uu.net.  There is a\
    \ \"news\"\n      directory which contains many software distribution and\n  \
    \    information sub-directories.\n      It is recommended that new users subscribe\
    \ to and read\n      news.announce.newusers since it will help to become oriented\
    \ to\n      USENET and the Internet.\n   8.7  What is a newsgroup?\n      A newsgroup\
    \ is a bulletin board which readers interested in that\n      newsgroup's particular\
    \ topic can read and respond to messages\n      posted by other readers.  Generally,\
    \ there will be a few \"threads\"\n      of discussion going on at the same time,\
    \ but they all share some\n      common theme.  There are approximately 900 newsgroups,\
    \ and there\n      are more being added all the time.\n      There are two types\
    \ of newsgroups: moderated and unmoderated.  A\n      moderated newsgroup does\
    \ not allow individuals to post directly to\n      the newsgroup.  Rather, the\
    \ postings go to the newsgroup's\n      moderator who determines whether or not\
    \ to pass the posting to the\n      entire group.  An unmoderated newsgroup allows\
    \ a reader to post\n      directly to the other readers.\n   8.8  How do I subscribe\
    \ to a newsgroup?\n      You don't subscribe to a newsgroup.  Either you get it\
    \ on your\n      machine or you don't.  If there's one you want, all you can do\
    \ is\n      ask the systems administrator to try to get it for you.\n   8.9  What\
    \ is anonymous FTP?\n      Anonymous FTP is a conventional way of allowing you\
    \ to sign on to\n      a computer on the Internet and copy specified public files\
    \ from it\n      [3].  Some sites offer anonymous FTP to distribute software and\n\
    \      various kinds of information.  You use it like any FTP, but the\n     \
    \ username is \"anonymous\".  Many systems will request that the\n      password\
    \ you choose is your email address.  If this fails, the\n      generic password\
    \ is usually \"guest\".\n   8.10  What is \"archie\"?\n      The archie system\
    \ was created to automatically track anonymous FTP\n      archive sites, and this\
    \ is still its primary function.  The system\n      currently makes available\
    \ the names and locations of some\n      2,100,000 files at some 1,000 archive\
    \ sites.\n      Archie's User Access component allows you to search the \"files\"\
    \n      database for these filenames.  When matches are found, you are\n     \
    \ presented with the appropriate archive site name, IP address, the\n      location\
    \ within the archive, and other useful information.\n      You can also use archie\
    \ to \"browse\" through a site's complete\n      listing in search of information\
    \ of interest, or obtain a complete\n      list of the archive sites known to\
    \ that server.\n      The archie server also offers a \"package descriptions\"\
    \ (or\n      \"whatis\") database.  This is a collection of names and\n      descriptions\
    \ gathered from a variety of sources and can be used to\n      identify files\
    \ located throughout the Internet, as well as other\n      useful information.\
    \  Files identified in the whatis database can\n      then be found by searching\
    \ the files database as described above.\n   8.11  How do I connect to archie?\n\
    \      You can connect to archie in a variety of ways. There is a\n      conventional\
    \ TELNET interface, an electronic mail interface, and a\n      variety of client\
    \ programs available.  The use of a client is\n      strongly encouraged.  There\
    \ are currently 22 archie servers\n      located throughout the world.\n     \
    \ To try the TELNET interface to archie you can TELNET to one of the\n      22\
    \ archie servers (preferably the one nearest you, and during\n      non-peak hours).\
    \  Log in as \"archie\" (no password is required).\n      Type \"help\" to get\
    \ you started.\n      Here is a list of archie servers as of the date this was\

    \      Questions, comments, and suggestions can be sent to the archie\n      development\
    \ group by sending mail to info@bunyip.com.\n   8.12  What is \"gopher\"?\n  \
    \    The Internet Gopher presents an extremely wide variety of diverse\n     \
    \ types of information in an easy to use menu-driven interface.\n      Gopher\
    \ servers link information from all around the Internet in a\n      manner that\
    \ can be transparent to the user. (Users can easily\n      discover the source\
    \ of any piece of information, however, if they\n      wish.)  For example, gopher\
    \ links databases of every type,\n      applications, white pages directories,\
    \ sounds, and pictures.\n      Some gophers are available via TELNET.  Since most\
    \ gophers are\n      linked to other gophers, if you can get to one, you can get\
    \ to\n      many.  You can, for example, telnet to naic.nasa.gov and use their\n\
    \      public gopher.\n      The best way to use the gopher service, as with all\
    \ client/server\n      type services, is by running your own gopher client.  The\
    \ Internet\n      Gopher was developed at the University of Minnesota.  More\n\
    \      information is available for anonymous FTP on the host\n      boombox.micro.umn.edu.\n\
    \   8.13  What is the World Wide Web?  What is Mosaic?\n      The World Wide Web\
    \ is a distributed, hypermedia-based Internet\n      information browser.  It\
    \ presents users with a friendly point and\n      click interface to a wide variety\
    \ of types of information (text,\n      graphics, sounds, movies, etc.) and Internet\
    \ services.  It is\n      possible to use the Web to access FTP archives, databases,\
    \ and\n      even gopher servers.\n      The most familiar implementations of\
    \ the World Wide Web are the\n      Mosaic clients developed by the National Center\
    \ for Supercomputing\n      Applications (NCSA).  Mosaic software is available\
    \ online at\n      ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.\n   8.14  How do I find out about other\
    \ Internet resource discovery\n         tools?\n      The field of Internet resource\
    \ discovery tools is one of the most\n      dynamic on the Internet today.  There\
    \ are several tools in\n      addition to those discussed here that are useful\
    \ for discovering\n      or searching Internet resources.   The EARN (European\
    \ Academic and\n      Research Network) Association has compiled an excellent\
    \ document\n      that introduces many of these services and provides information\n\
    \      about how to find out more about them.  To obtain the document,\n     \
    \ send a message to listserv@earncc.bitnet or\n      listserve%earncc.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu.\
    \  As the text of your\n      message, type \"GET filename\" where the filename\
    \ is either\n      \"nettools ps\" or \"nettols memo\".  The former is in PostScript\n\
    \      format.  This document is also available for anonymous FTP on some\n  \
    \    hosts, including naic.nasa.gov, where it is available in the\n      files/general_info\
    \ directory as\n      earn-resource-tool-guide.ps and earn-resource-tool-guide.txt.\n\
    \   8.15  What is \"TELNET\"?\n      The term \"TELNET\" refers to the remote\
    \ login that's possible on\n      the Internet because of the TELNET Protocol\
    \ [9].  The use of this\n      term as a verb, as in \"telnet to a host\" means\
    \ to establish a\n      connection across the Internet from one host to another.\
    \  Usually,\n      you must have an account on the remote host to be able to login\
    \ to\n      it once you've made a connection.  However, some hosts, such as\n\
    \      those offering white pages directories, provide public services\n     \
    \ that do not require a personal account.\n      If your host supports TELNET,\
    \ your command to connect to a remote\n      host would probably be \"telnet <hostname>\"\
    \ or \"telnet <host IP\n      address>\".  For example, \"telnet rs.internic.net\"\
    \ or \"telnet\n      198.41.0.5\".\n"
- title: 9. Mailing Lists and Sending Mail
  contents:
  - "9. Mailing Lists and Sending Mail\n   9.1  What is a mailing list?\n      A mailing\
    \ list is an email address that stands for a group of\n      people rather than\
    \ for an individual.  Mailing lists are usually\n      created to discuss specific\
    \ topics.  Anybody interested in that\n      topic, may (usually) join that list.\
    \  Some mailing lists have\n      membership restrictions, others have message\
    \ content restrictions,\n      and still others are moderated.  Most \"public\"\
    \ mailing lists have\n      a second email address to handle administrative matters,\
    \ such as\n      requests to be added to or deleted from the list.  All\n    \
    \  subscription requests should be sent to the administrative address\n      rather\
    \ than to the list itself!\n   9.2  How do I contact the administrator of a mailing\
    \ list rather\n        than posting to the entire list?\n      Today there are\
    \ two main methods used by mailing list\n      adminstrators to handle requests\
    \ to subscribe or unsubscribe from\n      their lists.  The administrative address\
    \ for many lists has the\n      same name as the list itself, but with \"-request\"\
    \ appended to the\n      list name.  So, to join the ietf-announce@cnri.reston.va.us\
    \ list,\n      you would send a message to ietf-announce-\n      request@cnri.reston.va.us.\
    \  Most often, requests to a \"-request\"\n      mailbox are handled by a human\
    \ and you can phrase your request as\n      a normal message.\n      More often\
    \ today, especially for lists with many readers,\n      administrators prefer\
    \ to have a program handle routine list\n      administration.  Many lists are\
    \ accessible via LISTSERVE programs\n      or other mailing list manager programs.\
    \  If this is the case, the\n      administrative address will usually be something\
    \ like\n      \"listserv@host.domain\", where the address for the mailing list\n\
    \      itself will be \"list@host.domain\".  The same listserve address can\n\
    \      handle requests for all mailing lists at that host.  When talking\n   \
    \   with a program, your subscription request will often be in the\n      form,\
    \ \"subscribe ListName YourFirstName YourLastName\" where you\n      substitute\
    \ the name of the list for ListName and add your real\n      name at the end.\n\
    \      The  important thing to  remember is that  all administrative\n      messages\
    \ regarding using, joining, or  quitting a list should   be\n      sent to  the\
    \ administrative mailbox  instead  of to  the  whole\n      list  so  that  the\
    \ readers of the list don't have to read them.\n   9.3  How do I send mail to\
    \ other networks?\n      Mail to the Internet is addressed in the form user@host.domain.\n\
    \      Remember that a domain name can have several components and the\n     \
    \ name of each host is a node on the domain tree.  So, an example of\n      an\
    \ Internet mail address is june@nisc.sri.com.\n      There are several networks\
    \ accessible via email from the Internet,\n      but many of these networks do\
    \ not use the same addressing\n      conventions the Internet does.  Often you\
    \ must route mail to these\n      networks through specific gateways as well,\
    \ thus further\n      complicating the address.\n      Here are a few conventions\
    \ you can use for sending mail from the\n      Internet to three networks with\
    \ which Internet users often\n      correspond.\n        Internet user to Internet\
    \ user:\n          username@hostname.subdomain.toplevel domain\n          e.g.\
    \ gsmith@nisc.sri.COM\n        Internet user to BITNET user:\n          user%site.BITNET@BITNET-GATEWAY\n\
    \          e.g. gsmith%emoryu1.BITNET@cunyvm.cuny.edu.\n               gsmith%emoryu1@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU\n\
    \        Internet user to UUCP user:\n          user%host.UUCP@uunet.uu.net\n\
    \          user%domain@uunet.uu.net\n        Internet user to SprintMail user:\n\
    \          /G=Mary/S=Anderson/O=co.abc/ADMD=SprintMail/C=US/@SPRINT.COM\n    \
    \      -or-\n          /PN=Mary.Anderson/O=co.abc/ADMD=SprintMail/C=US/@SPRINT.COM\n\
    \          (Case is significant.)\n        Internet user to CompuServe user:\n\
    \          Replace the comma in the CompuServe userid (represented here\n    \
    \      with x's) with a period, and add the compuserve.com domain\n          name.\n\
    \          xxxx.xxxx@compuserve.com\n        CompuServe user to Internet user:\n\
    \          >Internet:user@host\n          Insert >internet: before an Internet\
    \ address.\n        Internet user to MCIMail user:\n          accountname@mcimail.com\n\
    \          mci_id@mcimail.com\n          full_user_name@mcimail.com.\n"

  - "10.  Miscellaneous \"Internet lore\" questions\n   10.1  What does :-) mean?\n\
    \      In many electronic mail messages, it is sometimes useful to\n      indicate\
    \ that part of a message is meant in jest.  It is also\n      sometimes useful\
    \ to communicate emotion which simple words do not\n      readily convey.  To\
    \ provide these nuances, a collection of \"smiley\n      faces\" has evolved.\
    \  If you turn your head sideways to the left,\n      :-) appears as a smiling\
    \ face.  Some of the more common faces are:\n         :-)  smile             \
    \       :-(  frown\n         :)   also a smile             ;-)  wink\n       \
    \  :-D  laughing                 8-)  wide-eyed\n         :-}  grin          \
    \           :-X  close mouthed\n         :-]  smirk                    :-o  oh,\
    \ no!\n   10.2  What do \"btw\", \"fyi\", \"imho\", \"wrt\", and \"rtfm\" mean?\n\
    \      Often common expressions are abbreviated in informal network\n      postings.\
    \  These abbreviations stand for \"by the way\", \"for your\n      information\"\
    , \"in my humble [or honest] opinion\", \"with respect\n      to\", and \"read\
    \ the f*ing manual\" (with the \"f\" word varying\n      according to the vehemence\
    \ of the reader :-).\n   10.3  What is the \"FAQ\" list?\n      This list provides\
    \ answers to \"Frequently Asked Questions\" that\n      often appear on various\
    \ USENET newsgroups.  The list is posted\n      every four to six weeks to the\
    \ news.announce.newusers group.  It\n      is intended to provide a background\
    \ for new users learning how to\n      use the news.  As the FAQ list provide\
    \ new users with the answers\n      to such questions, it helps keep the newsgroups\
    \ themselves\n      comparatively free of repetition.  Often specific newsgroups\
    \ will\n      have and frequently post versions of a FAQ list that are specific\n\
    \      to their topics.  The term FAQ has become generalized so that any\n   \
    \   topic may have its FAQ even if it is not a newsgroup.\n      Here is information\
    \ about obtaining the USENET FAQs, courtesy of\n      Gene Spafford:\n      Many\
    \ questions can be answered by consulting the most recent\n      postings in the\
    \ news.announce.newusers and news.lists groups.  If\n      those postings have\
    \ expired from your site, or you do not get\n      news, you can get archived\
    \ postings from the FTP server on the\n      host rtfm.mit.edu.\n      These archived\
    \ postings include all the Frequently Asked Questions\n      posted to the news.answers\
    \ newsgroups, as well as the most recent\n      lists of Usenet newsgroups, Usenet-accessible\
    \ mailing lists, group\n      moderators, and other Usenet-related information\
    \ posted to the\n      news.announce.newusers and news.lists groups.\n      To\
    \ get the material by FTP, log in using anonymous FTP (userid of\n      anonymous\
    \ and your email address as password).\n      The archived files, and FAQ files\
    \ from other newsgroups, are all\n      in the directory:\n                  \
    \           /pub/usenet/news.answers\n      Archived files from news.announce.newusers\
    \ and news.lists are in:\n                             /pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers\n\
    \                             /pub/usenet/news.lists\n      respectively.\n  \
    \    To get the information by mail, send an email message to: mail-\n      server@pit-manager.mit.edu\
    \ containing:\n                  send usenet/news.answers/TITLE/PART\n      where\
    \ TITLE is the archive title, and PART is the portion of the\n      posting you\
    \ want.\n      Send a message containing \"help\" to get general information about\n\
    \      the mail server, including information on how to get a list of\n      archive\
    \ titles to use in further send commands.\n"
