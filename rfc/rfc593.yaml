- title: Telnet and FTP Implementation Schedule Change

  - "Telnet and FTP Implementation Schedule Change\n   We have been contacted by several\
    \ Telnet implementers and concerned\n   users regarding the scheduled changeover\
    \ from old to new Telnet.\n   There is a good deal of concern about accomplishing\
    \ a coordinated\n   changeover especially in light of the potential incompatibilities\n\
    \   (RFC 559, NIC18482).  Therefore the changeover is reformulated as\n   follows.\n\
    \   New Telnet implementations are to be ready 1 Jan 74 (as before), but\n   are\
    \ to use ICP socket 23 (decimal).  That is the server Telnet will\n   listen on\
    \ socket 23, and user Telnet programs will connect to socket\n   23.  It will\
    \ also be useful for the user program to let the user\n   optionally select the\
    \ server socket, as many user Telnet programs\n   currently do.  It will also\
    \ be useful for implementers to consider a\n   server Telnet program capable of\
    \ dealing with both protocols as MIT-\n   DMCG has done (RFC 559).  This will\
    \ provide an opportunity for\n   testing and debugging the new programs in a way\
    \ that does not\n   interfere with normal use.\n   During January we will survey\
    \ the technical liaisons to determine the\n   status of the Telnet implementations.\
    \  As soon as we determine that\n   the Telnet implementations have reached a\
    \ point where the changeover\n   can be made without disruption of user services\
    \ the technical\n   liaisons will be notified.\n   In light of this change in\
    \ the Telnet implementation schedule, the\n   FTP schedule is also modified. \
    \ New FTP implementations are to be\n   ready by 1 Feb 74 (as before), but will\
    \ continue to use ICP socket 21\n   (decimal) until we can determine that a changeover\
    \ is appropriate.\n"
