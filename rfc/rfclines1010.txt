This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.

Phone: (213) 822 1511 Electronic mail: JKREYNOLDS@ISI.EDU Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official Internet Protocols" [91].
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "DDN Protocol Handbook, Volume Two, DARPA Internet Protocols" [36] prepared by the NIC.
Other collections of older or obsolete protocols are contained in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [57], or in the "ARPANET Protocol Transition Handbook" [38].
For further information on ordering the complete 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook, write:
SRI International (SRI NIC), DDN Network Information Center, Room EJ291, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Meno Park, CA., 94025; or call: 1 800 235 3155.
In the entries below, the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
The bracketed entry, e.g., [nn,iii], at the RFC 1010
right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number ("nn") cites the document and the letters ("iii") cites the person.
Whenever possible, the letters are a NIC Ident as used in the WhoIs (NICNAME) service.
The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [14].
That is, fields are described left to right, with the most significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level.
Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English.
For example, in the following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered. 0
Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0    Significance of Bits Similarly, whenever a multi octet field represents a numeric quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.
When a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
In the Internet Protocol (IP) [36,80] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
In the Internet Protocol (IP) [36,80] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
Port Numbers PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP
[36,81] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [37,79].
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the ISO TP4 [52].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.

May 1987 Domain System Parameters DOMAIN SYSTEM
The Internet Domain Naming System (DOMAIN) includes several parameters.
These are documented in RFC 883 [61].
The CLASS parameter is listed here.
The per CLASS parameters are defined in separate RFCs as indicated.
ARPANET Logical Addresses ARPANET LOGICAL ADDRESSES
The ARPANET facility for "logical addressing" is described in RFC 878 [57] and RFC 1005 [109].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by Joyce Reynolds.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
[JBP] RFC 1010 Assigned Numbers
ARPANET Link Numbers ARPANET LINK NUMBERS
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [2].
The low order 4 bits of the message id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
SAP Numbers IEEE 802 NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
Further, there is an extension of the LSAP header called the Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary in bit transmission order, which is the opposite of the big endian order used throughout the Internet protocol documentation.
These numbers (and others) are assigned by the IEEE Standards Office.
The address is: IEEE Standards Office, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017,
At an ad hoc special session on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP", held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach to a consistent way to send DoD IP datagrams and other IP related protocols on 802 networks was developed.
Due to some evolution of the IEEE 802.2 standards and the need to provide for a standard way to do additional DoD IP related protocols (such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) on IEEE 802 network, the following new policy is established, which will replace the old policy (see RFC 960 and RFC 948 [108]).
The new policy is for the Internet community to use the IEEE 802.2 encapsulation on 802.3, 802.4, and 802.5 networks by using the SNAP with an organization code indicating that the following 16 bits specify the EtherType code (where IP   2048 (0800 hex), see Ethernet Numbers of Interest).
Dsap K1  Ssap K1  control
The total length of the SAP Header and the SNAP header is 8 octets, making the 802.2 protocol overhead come out on a nice boundary.
The IEEE likes to talk about things in little endian bit transmission order and specifies this value as 01010101.
In big endian order, as used in Internet specifications, this becomes 10101010 binary, or AA hex, or 170 decimal.
The use of the IP LSAP (K1   6) is to be phased out as quickly as possible.
Ethernet Numbers ETHERNET NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).
These systems use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
If you need an Ethernet type, contact the XEROX Corporation, 2300 Geng Road, Palo Alto, California 94303, ATTN:
Stanford V Kernel experimental [XEROX]
Stanford V Kernel production [XEROX]
The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [50] and RFC 895 [66] respectively.
Ethernet 48 bit address blocks are now assigned by the IEEE.
IEEE Standards Office, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017,
Address Resolution Protocol ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL PARAMETERS
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) specified in RFC 826 [64] has several parameters.
The assigned values for these parameters are listed here.
[JBP] Protocol Type (pro) Use the same codes as listed in the section called "Ethernet Numbers of Interest" (all hardware types use this code set for the protocol type).
May 1987 Public Data Network Numbers PUBLIC DATA NETWORK NUMBERS
One of the Internet Class A Networks is the international system of Public Data Networks.
This section lists the mapping between the Internet Addresses and the Public Data Network Addresses (X.121).
The numbers below are assigned for networks that are connected to the Internet, and for independent networks.
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceding the number.

[JBP] The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over the Public Data Network is specified in RFC 877 [55].
