    \ measurement purposes those hosts which\nare willing implement a \"Discard\"\
    \ process.\nThis discard process would listen for a request for connection and\n\
    execute the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) as specified in NIC 7104\nthe \"\
    Current Network Protocols\" notebook.  Upon completion of the ICP\nthe discard\
    \ process would wait for data from the network.  When data is\nreceived from the\
    \ network it is discarded at once, (and the buffer space\nis re-allocated).  The\
    \ discard process is terminated by closing the\nnetwork connections.\n       [\
