  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document updates the media type registrations initially\n\
    \   specified in RFC 3555 for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\n   payload\
    \ formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video\n   Conferences, RFC\
    \ 3551 [1], as subtypes under the \"audio\" and \"video\"\n   media types.  This\
    \ document does not include media type registrations\n   for the RTP payload formats\
    \ that are referenced in RFC 3551 but\n   defined in other RFCs.  The media type\
    \ registrations for those\n   payload formats are intended to be updated by including\
    \ them in\n   revisions of the individual RFCs defining the payload formats.\n\
    \   The media type registrations specified here conform to the updated\n   template\
    \ format and procedures in RFC 4288 [2] and RFC 4855 [3].\n   This update makes\
    \ no technical changes in the registrations.\n   Together with RFC 4855, this\
    \ document obsoletes RFC 3555.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  IANA Considerations\n   As a consequence of the generalized applicability\
    \ of the media types\n   registry as specified in RFC 4288, some changes in nomenclature\
    \ are\n   needed in the RTP Payload Format section of the registry.  In the\n\
    \   registry title \"RTP Payload Format MIME types\" and the introductory\n  \
    \ text, \"MIME\" should be changed to \"media\". \"MIME\" should be deleted\n\
    \   from the table headings, leaving just \"media type\" and \"subtype\".\n  \
    \ This document updates the media type registrations listed below to\n   conform\
    \ to the revised registration format specified in RFC 4288 and\n   RFC 4855, so\
    \ the reference for these media types should be changed\n   from RFC 3555 to this\
    \ document.  Some media type registrations\n   contained in RFC 3555 are omitted\
    \ from this document; the existing\n   registrations for those types continue\
    \ to be valid until updated by\n   other RFCs.  There are no new registrations\

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Audio Type Registrations\n   For most audio payload formats, the RTP timestamp\
    \ clock rate is equal\n   to the sampling rate.  Some payload formats operate\
    \ only at one fixed\n   sampling rate, while others are adjustable.\n   These\
    \ audio formats also include the optional parameters \"ptime\" to\n   specify\
    \ the recommended length of time in milliseconds represented by\n   the media\
    \ in a packet, and \"maxptime\" to specify the maximum amount\n   of media that\
    \ can be encapsulated in each packet, expressed as time\n   in milliseconds. \
    \ The \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" parameters are defined\n   in the Session Description\

    \ is incorporated here\n   and augmented with additional information for RTP transport.\n\
    \   Type name: audio\n   Subtype name: L16\n   Required parameters:\n        rate:\

    \ parameter is also\n        present.\n        emphasis: analog preemphasis applied\
    \ to the signal before\n        quantization.  The only emphasis value defined\
    \ here is\n        emphasis=50-15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis\n\
    \        used with Compact Discs.  This parameter MUST be omitted if no\n    \
    \    analog preemphasis was applied.  Note that this is a stream\n        property\

    \ of each packet in\n        milliseconds.\n        For RTP, maxptime: maximum\

    \ and\n   requirements from RFC 3555, while the media type registrations from\n\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This memo specifies media type registrations\
    \ for the transfer of\n   several compressed audio and video data encodings via\
    \ RTP, so\n   implementations using these media types are subject to the security\n\
    \   considerations discussed in the RTP specification [8].\n   None of these media\
    \ types carry \"active content\" that could impose\n   malicious side-effects\
    \ upon the receiver.  The content consists\n   solely of compressed audio or video\
    \ data to be decoded and presented\n   as sound or images.  However, several audio\
    \ and video encodings are\n   perfect for hiding data using steganography.\n \
    \  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using\n   compression\
    \ techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end\n   computational load.  The attacker\
    \ can inject pathological datagrams\n   into the stream, which are complex to\
    \ decode and cause the receiver\n   to be overloaded.  However, none of the encodings\
    \ registered here has\n   an expansion factor greater than about 20, and all are\
    \ considered\n   relatively simple by modern standards (some are implemented on\n\
    \   handheld devices and most were implemented on general-purpose\n   computers\
    \ ten years ago).\n   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver\
    \ may\n   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either\n  \
    \ desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication MAY be used to\n   discard\
    \ packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of\n   the authentication\
    \ itself may be too high.\n   RTP may be sent via IP multicast, which provides\
    \ no direct means for\n   a sender to know all the receivers of the data sent\
    \ and therefore no\n   measure of privacy.  Rightly or not, users may be more\
    \ sensitive to\n   privacy concerns with audio and video communication than they\
    \ have\n   been with more traditional forms of network communication.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the use of security mechanisms with RTP to provide\n   confidentiality and integrity\
    \ of the data is important.  Because the\n   data compression used with these\
