- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses terminology from [MVPN] and, in particular,\
    \ uses\n   the prefixes \"C-\" and \"P-\", as specified in Section 3.1 of [MVPN],\
    \ to\n   distinguish addresses in the \"customer address space\" from addresses\n\
    \   in the \"provider address space\".  The following terminology and\n   acronyms\
    \ are particularly important in this document:\n      - MVPN\n        Multicast\
    \ Virtual Private Network -- a VPN [L3VPN] in which\n        multicast service\
    \ is offered.\n      - VRF\n        VPN Routing and Forwarding table [L3VPN].\n\
    \      - SP\n        Service Provider.\n      - P-tunnel\n        A tunnel through\
    \ the network of one or more SPs.\n      - C-S\n        Multicast Source.  A multicast\
    \ source address, in the address\n        space of a customer network.\n     \
    \ - C-G\n        Multicast Group.  A multicast group address (destination\n  \
    \      address) in the address space of a customer network.\n      - C-multicast\
    \ flow or C-flow\n        A customer multicast flow.  Each C-flow is identified\
    \ by the\n        ordered pair (source address, group address), where each address\n\
    \        is in the customer's address space.  The identifier of a\n        particular\
    \ C-flow is usually written as (C-S,C-G).\n      - RP\n        A \"Rendezvous\
    \ Point\", as defined in [PIM].\n      - C-RP\n        A Rendezvous Point whose\
    \ address is in the customer's address\n        space.\n      - Selective P-tunnel\n\
    \        A P-tunnel that is joined only by Provider Edge (PE) routers\n      \
    \  that need to receive one or more of the C-flows that are\n        traveling\
    \ through that P-tunnel.\n      - Inclusive P-tunnel\n        A P-tunnel that\
    \ is joined by all PE routers that attach to sites\n        of a given MVPN.\n\
    \      - S-PMSI A-D route\n        Selective Provider Multicast Service Interface\
    \ Auto-Discovery\n        route.  Carried in BGP Update messages, these routes\
    \ are used to\n        advertise the fact that particular C-flows are bound to\
    \ (i.e.,\n        are traveling through) particular P-tunnels.\n   Familiarity\
    \ with multicast concepts and terminology [PIM] is also\n   presupposed.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Wildcards in S-PMSI A-D Routes
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Wildcards in S-PMSI A-D Routes\n   As specified in [MVPN] and [MVPN-BGP],\
    \ an S-PMSI A-D route advertises\n   that a particular C-flow is bound to a particular\
    \ selective P-tunnel.\n   The identifier of the specified C-flow, e.g., (C-S,C-G),\
    \ is encoded\n   into the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of the\
    \ S-PMSI\n   A-D route.  The identifier of the specified P-tunnel is encoded into\n\
    \   an attribute (the \"PMSI Tunnel Attribute\") of the S-PMSI A-D route.\n  \
    \ Each S-PMSI A-D route thus specifies a single C-flow.  To bind\n   multiple\
    \ C-flows to a single P-tunnel, it is necessary to advertise\n   one S-PMSI A-D\
    \ route for each C-flow, specifying the same P-tunnel in\n   each such route.\n\
    \   This document defines OPTIONAL extensions to the procedures and\n   encodings\
    \ specified in [MVPN] and [MVPN-BGP].  These extensions\n   enable a single S-PMSI\
    \ A-D route to advertise that multiple\n   C-multicast flows are bound to a single\
    \ P-tunnel.\n   The extensions specified in this document are based on the notion\
    \ of\n   allowing the NLRI of an S-PMSI A-D route to contain a \"wildcard\". \
    \ In\n   the NLRI encoding, a wildcard can replace the C-S, the C-G, or both.\n\
    \   We use the notation \"C-*\" to denote a wildcard.  The extensions allow\n\
    \   the NLRI to encode three kinds of wildcards: (C-*,C-*), (C-S,C-*),\n   and\
    \ (C-*,C-G).\n   By using wildcards, a PE may be able to reduce the number of\
    \ S-PMSI\n   A-D routes it originates, thereby improving the scalability of the\n\
    \   control plane.  There is, however, no impact on data plane\n   scalability,\
    \ as the number of P-tunnels is not reduced.\n   Encoding and detailed procedures\
    \ are specified in subsequent sections\n   of this document.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Use Cases\n   There are a number of situations in which it can be useful\
    \ to use\n   wildcards in the NLRI of an S-PMSI A-D route.\n      - Using a selective\
    \ P-tunnel as the default tunnel.\n        There are procedures in [MVPN] and\
    \ [MVPN-BGP] that allow a PE to\n        advertise that it is going to use an\
    \ inclusive P-tunnel as the\n        P-tunnel on which it will transmit all C-flows\
    \ by \"default\".\n        However, those documents do not provide any way for\
    \ a PE to\n        advertise that it is going to use a selective P-tunnel as the\n\
    \        P-tunnel on which it will transmit all C-flows by \"default\".\n    \
    \    Using the extensions defined in this document, a PE can\n        advertise\
    \ that it is going to use a selective P-tunnel as its\n        default P-tunnel.\
    \  It does so by advertising an S-PMSI A-D route\n        whose NLRI contains\
    \ (C-*,C-*).\n      - Binding multiple C-flows traveling along a customer's Protocol\n\
    \        Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) shared tree to a\n     \
    \   single P-tunnel.\n        A PE router may be connected to an MVPN site that\
    \ contains a\n        customer RP (C-RP).  The C-RP may be the root of one or\
    \ more\n        shared trees.  In multicast terminology, these are known as\n\
    \        (*,G) trees.  By advertising a single S-PMSI A-D route whose\n      \
    \  NLRI contains the (C-*,C-G) wildcard, the PE can bind all the\n        C-flows\
    \ traveling along a customer's (*,G) tree to a single\n        P-tunnel.  This\
    \ use case applies only when C-G is a\n        non-bidirectional ASM (Any Source\
    \ Multicast) group.\n      - Binding multiple C-flows with the same C-group address\
    \ to a\n        single P-tunnel, even if each such C-flow is traveling along a\n\
    \        customer's PIM source tree.\n        A PE router may be connected to\
    \ an MVPN site containing several\n        multicast sources that are all sending\
    \ to a common multicast\n        group, along a customer's PIM source trees. \
    \ Alternatively, the\n        PE may be connected to several sites, each containing\
    \ at least\n        one source sending to the common multicast group.  By\n  \
    \      advertising a single S-PMSI A-D route whose NLRI contains\n        (C-*,C-G),\
    \ the PE can bind these C-flows to a single P-tunnel.\n        This use case applies\
    \ only when the C-group is a\n        non-bidirectional ASM group.\n      - Binding\
    \ multiple C-flows with the same C-group address to a\n        single P-tunnel,\
    \ when those C-flows are traveling along a\n        customer's BIDIR-PIM shared\
    \ tree.\n        This use case applies only when the C-group is a BIDIR-PIM\n\
    \        group.\n      - Binding multiple C-flows from a given C-source to a given\n\
    \        P-tunnel, irrespective of whether those C-flows all have the\n      \
    \  same C-group address.\n        This can be useful when the C-group addresses\
    \ are SSM (Single\n        Source Multicast) addresses.  Suppose, for example,\
    \ that a given\n        source transmits multiple \"channels\" of information,\
    \ each with\n        its own C-group address.  It may be desirable to bind all\
    \ these\n        channels to a single P-tunnel, without having to advertise an\n\
    \        S-PMSI A-D route for each one.\n   Of course, a specific C-flow, (C-S,C-G),\
    \ can always be assigned\n   individually to a particular P-tunnel by advertising\
    \ an S-PMSI A-D\n   route whose NLRI contains (C-S,C-G).\n   In Section 4, we\
    \ will sometimes speak of an S-PMSI A-D route being\n   ignored.  When we say\
    \ the route is \"ignored\", we do not mean that its\n   normal BGP processing\
    \ is not done, but that the route is not\n   considered when determining which\
    \ P-tunnel to use when receiving\n   multicast data, and that the MPLS label values\
    \ it conveys are not\n   used.  We will use \"ignore\" in quotes to indicate this\
    \ meaning.\n   This document provides procedures only for the case where the\n\
    \   P-tunnels are \"unidirectional\", i.e., point-to-multipoint.  The use\n  \
    \ of \"bidirectional\" (multipoint-to-multipoint) P-tunnels is outside\n   the\
    \ scope of this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Encoding of Wildcards
  contents:
  - "2.  Encoding of Wildcards\n   Per [MVPN-BGP] Section 4.3, the MCAST-VPN NLRI\
    \ in an S-PMSI A-D route\n   is encoded as follows:\n                +-----------------------------------+\n\
    \                |      RD   (8 octets)              |\n                +-----------------------------------+\n\

    \   where the \"source length\" and \"group length\" fields always have a\n  \
    \ non-zero value.  This document specifies that a \"zero-length\" source\n   or\
    \ group represents the corresponding wildcard.  Specifically,\n      - A source\
    \ wildcard is encoded as a zero-length source field.\n        That is, the \"\
    multicast source length\" field contains the value\n        0x00, and the \"multicast\
    \ source\" field is omitted.\n      - A group wildcard is encoded as a zero-length\
    \ group field.  That\n        is, the \"multicast group length\" field contains\
    \ the value 0x00,\n        and the \"multicast group\" field is omitted.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Finding the Matching S-PMSI A-D Route\n   This section gives the precise\
    \ rules for determining the S-PMSI A-D\n   route that is \"matched\" by a given\
    \ (C-S,C-G) or (C-*,C-G).  The\n   procedures in Section 4 will make use of the\
    \ matching rules defined\n   in this section.\n   All matching rules assume the\
    \ context of a given VRF at a given PE.\n   The rules that a PE applies to find\
    \ the S-PMSI A-D route that matches\n   a (C-S,C-G) C-flow that it needs to transmit\
    \ are slightly different\n   than the rules it applies to find the S-PMSI A-D\
    \ route that matches a\n   (C-S,C-G) C-flow that it needs to receive.  These rules\
    \ are specified\n   in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.\n   The S-PMSI A-D\

  - "4.1.  Procedures for All Kinds of Wildcards\n   This document defines procedures\
    \ for the following uses of the\n   wildcard in the NLRI of an S-PMSI A-D route:\n\
    \      - (C-*,C-G): Source wildcard, group specified.\n      - (C-S,C-*): Source\
    \ specified, group wildcard.\n      - (C-*,C-*): Source wildcard, group wildcard.\n\
    \   All other wildcard functionality is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n\
    \   The ability to originate S-PMSI A-D routes with a particular kind of\n   wildcard\
    \ is OPTIONAL.  However, if a PE has the ability to originate\n   S-PMSI A-D routes\
    \ with a particular kind of wildcard, it MUST have\n   the ability to interpret\
    \ and correctly process S-PMSI A-D routes with\n   that kind of wildcard, and\
    \ it SHOULD have the ability to interpret\n   and correctly process all three\
    \ kinds of wildcards.\n   For a given MVPN, A PE MUST NOT originate S-PMSI A-D\
    \ routes with a\n   particular kind of wildcard unless it is known a priori that\
    \ all PEs\n   attached to that MVPN have the ability to interpret and correctly\n\
    \   process that kind of wildcard.\n   The criteria for originating and withdrawing\
    \ S-PMSI A-D routes with\n   wildcards are local to the originating PE.\n   As\
    \ specified in [MVPN-BGP], an S-PMSI A-D route is carried in the\n   NLRI field\
    \ of an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute (see [BGP-MP]).  Every\n   S-PMSI A-D route has\
    \ a particular address family (IPv4 or IPv6), as\n   specified in the Address\
    \ Family Identifier (AFI) field of the\n   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute.  A wildcard\
    \ in a particular S-PMSI A-D route\n   always refers only to multicast flows of\
    \ that same address family.\n   The procedures specified in this document apply\
    \ only when the PMSI\n   Tunnel Attribute of an S-PMSI A-D route specifies a \"\
    unidirectional\"\n   P-tunnel.  The use of \"bidirectional\" P-tunnels (e.g.,\
    \ Multipoint-to-\n   Multipoint Label Switched Paths, BIDIR-PIM trees) is outside\
    \ the\n   scope of this document.\n   In the following sections, an S-PMSI A-D\
    \ route whose NLRI contains\n   (C-*,C-G), (C-S,C-*), or (C-*,C-*) will be referred\
    \ to as a\n   \"(C-*,C-G) route\", a \"(C-S,C-*) route\", or a \"(C-*,C-*)\" route,\n\
    \   respectively.\n"

    \ for carrying multicast data traffic\n   originated in the MVPN's site(s) connected\
    \ to that PE.  When the\n   (C-*,C-*) wildcard is used together with BGP C-multicast\
    \ routing,\n   this results in the \"S-PMSI only\" model, where no I-PMSIs are\
    \ used at\n   all for the given MVPN.\n   A (C-*,C-*) S-PMSI A-D route is originated\
    \ for a given MVPN by a\n   given PE only if that PE has been provisioned with\
