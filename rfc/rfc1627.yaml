  - "SUMMARY\n   Re-use of Internet addresses for private IP networks is the topic\
    \ of\n   the recent RFC 1597 [1].  It reserves a set of IP network numbers,\n\
    \   for (re-)use by any number of organizations, so long as those\n   networks\
    \ are not routed outside any single, private IP network.  RFC\n   1597 departs\
    \ from the basic architectural rule that IP addresses must\n   be globally unique,\
    \ and it does so without having had the benefit of\n   the usual, public review\
    \ and approval by the IETF or IAB.  This\n   document restates the arguments for\
    \ maintaining a unique address\n   space.  Concerns for Internet architecture\
    \ and operations, as well as\n   IETF procedure, are explored.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   Growth in use of Internet technology and in attachments to the\n\
    \   Internet have taken us to the point that we now are in danger of\n   running\
    \ out of unassigned IP network numbers.  Initially, numbers\n   were formally\
    \ assigned only when a network was about to be attached\n   to the Internet. \
    \ This caused difficulties when initial use of IP\n   substantially preceded the\
    \ decision and permission to attach to the\n   Internet.  In particular, re-numbering\
    \ was painful.  The lesson that\n   we learned was that every IP address ought\
    \ to be globally unique,\n   independent of its attachment to the Internet.  This\
    \ makes it\n   possible for any two network entities to communicate, no matter\
    \ where\n   either might be located.  This model is the result of a decades-long\n\
    \   evolution, through which the community realized how painful it can be\n  \
    \ to convert a network of computers to use an assigned number after\n   using\
    \ random or default addresses found on computers just out of the\n   box.  RFC\
    \ 1597 abrogates this model without benefit of general IETF\n   community discussion\
    \ and consensus, leaving policy and operational\n   questions unasked and unanswered.\n"

  contents:
  - "KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE:  AN ARCHITECTURAL GOAL AND VIOLATION\n   A common\
    \ -- if not universal -- ideal for the future of IP is for\n   every system to\
    \ be globally accessible, given the proper security\n   mechanisms.  Whether such\
    \ systems comprise toasters, light switches,\n   utility power poles, field medical\
    \ equipment, or the classic examples\n   of \"computers\", our current model of\
    \ assignment is to ensure that\n   they can interoperate.\n   In order for such\
    \ a model to work there must exist a globally unique\n   addressing system.  A\
    \ common complaint throughout the community is\n   that the existing security\
    \ in host software does not allow for every\n   (or even many) hosts in a corporate\
    \ environment to have direct IP\n   access.  When this problem is addressed through\
    \ proper privacy and\n   authentication standards, non-unique IP addresses will\
    \ become a\n   bottleneck to easy deployment if the recommendations in RFC 1597\
    \ are\n   followed.\n   The IP version 4 (IPv4) address space will be exhausted.\
    \  The\n   question is simply:  when?\n   If we assert that all IP addresses must\
    \ be unique globally, connected\n   or not, then we will run out of IP address\
    \ space soon.\n   If we assert that only IP addresses used on the world-wide Internet\n\
    \   need to be globally unique, then we will run out of IP address space\n   later.\n\
    \   It is absolutely key to keep the Internet community's attention\n   focused\
    \ on the efforts toward IP next generation (IPng), so that we\n   may transcend\
    \ the limitations of IPv4.  RFC 1597 produces apparent\n   relief from IPv4 address\
    \ space exhaustion by masking those networks\n   that are not connecting to the\
    \ Internet, today.  However, this\n   apparent relief will likely produce two\
    \ results: complacency on the\n   large part of the community that does not take\
    \ the long term view,\n   and a very sudden IP address space exhaustion at some\
    \ later date.\n   Prior to IPng deployment, it is important to preserve all the\n\
    \   semantics that make both the Internet and Internet technology so very\n  \
    \ valuable for interoperability.  Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola\n   could\
    \ not collaborate as easily as they have to produce the PowerPC\n   without uniquely\
    \ assigned IP addresses. The same can be said of the\n   Silicon Graphics merger\
    \ with MIPS. There are many, many more examples\n   that can be cited.\n   It\
    \ should be noted that a scheme similar to RFC 1597 can be\n   implemented at\
    \ the time that we actually run out of assignable IPv4\n   address space; it simply\
    \ requires that those organizations which have\n   been assigned addresses but\
    \ are not yet connected to the Internet\n   return their addresses to IANA. It\
    \ is important that the IAB (and\n   IANA as its agent) reassert their ownership\
    \ of the IP address space\n   now, to preclude challenges to this type of reassignment.\n"

- title: RFC 1597 Implementations
  contents:
  - "RFC 1597 Implementations\n   Methods are needed to ensure that the remaining\
    \ addresses are\n   allocated and used frugally.  Due to the current problems,\
    \ Internet\n   service providers have made it increasingly difficult for\n   organizations\
    \ to acquire public IP network numbers.  Private networks\n   have always had\
    \ the option of using addresses not assigned to them by\n   appropriate authorities.\
    \  We do not know how many such networks\n   exist, because by their nature they\
    \ do not interact with the global\n   Internet.  By using a random address, a\
    \ company must take some care\n   to ensure it is able to route to the properly\
    \ registered owner of\n   that network.\n   RFC 1597 proposes to solve the routing\
    \ problem by assigning numbers\n   that will never be used outside of private\
    \ environments.  Using such\n   standard numbers introduces a potential for clashes\
    \ in another way.\n   If two private networks follow RFC 1597 and then later wish\
    \ to\n   communicate with each other, one will have to renumber.  The same\n \
    \  problem occurs if a private network wishes to become public.  The\n   likely\
    \ cost of renumbering is linear to the number of hosts on a\n   network.  Thus,\
    \ a large company with 10,000 hosts on a network could\n   incur considerable\
    \ expense if it either merged with another company\n   or joined the Internet\
    \ in such a way as to allow all hosts to\n   directly access the outside network.\n\
    \   The probability of address clashes occurring over time approach 100%\n   with\
    \ RFC 1597.  Picking a random network number reduces the chances\n   of having\
    \ to renumber hosts, but introduces the routing problems\n   described above.\
    \  Best of all, retrieving assigned numbers from the\n   appropriate authority\
    \ in the first place eliminates both existing and\n   potential address conflicts\
    \ at the cost of using a part of the\n   address space.\n   Apple Computer once\
    \ believed that none of its internal systems would\n   ever speak IP directly\
    \ to the outside world, and as such, network\n   operations picked IP class A\
    \ network 90 out of thin air to use.\n   Apple is only now recovering from this\
    \ error, having renumbered some\n   5,000 hosts to provide them with \"desktop\"\
    \ Internet access.  Unless\n   the Internet community reaffirms its commitment\
    \ to a globally unique\n   address space, we condemn many thousands of organizations\
    \ to similar\n   pain when they too attempt to answer the call of the global Internet.\n\
    \   Another timely example of problems caused by RFC 1597 is Sun's use of\n  \
    \ Internet multicasting.  Sun selectively relays specific multicast\n   conferences.\
    \  This has the effect of making many hosts at Sun visible\n   to the Internet,\
    \ even though they are not addressable via IP unicast\n   routing.  If they had\
    \ non-global addresses this would not work at\n   all.  It is not possible to\
    \ predict which machines need global\n   addresses in advance.  Silicon Graphics\
    \ has a similar configuration,\n   as is likely for others, as well.\n   Some\
    \ might argue that assigning numbers to use for private networks\n   will prevent\
    \ accidental leaks from occurring through some sort of\n   convention a'la Martian\
    \ packets.  While the proposal attempts to\n   create a standard for \"private\"\
    \ address use, there is absolutely no\n   way to ensure that other addresses are\
    \ not also used.\n   Hence, the \"standard\" becomes nothing but a misleading\
    \ heuristic.  In\n   fact, it is essential that routers to the global Internet\
    \ advertise\n   networks based only on explicit permission, rather than refusing\
    \ to\n   advertise others based on implicit prohibition, as supported by the\n\
    \   policy formally created in RFC 1597.\n"
- title: Security Issues
  contents:
  - "Security Issues\n   Administrators will have a hard time spotting unauthorized\
    \ networks,\n   when their network has been breached (either intentionally or\n\
    \   unintentionally) because the other networks might have the same\n   numbers\
    \ as those normally in the routing tables.  More over, an\n   inadvertent connection\
    \ could possibly have a double whammy effect of\n   partitioning two operational\
    \ networks.\n   It is worth emphasizing that IP providers should filter out all\
    \ but\n   authorized networks.  Such a practice would not only prevent\n   accidents\
    \ but also enhance the security of the Internet by reducing\n   the potential\
    \ number of points of attack.\n   Internet multicasting adds a new dimension to\
    \ security.  In some\n   cases it may possible to allow multicasting through firewalls\
    \ that\n   completely restrict unicast routing.  Otherwise unconnected networks\n\
    \   might well need unique addresses, as illustrated in the example\n   above.\n"
- title: Problems with Examples
  contents:
  - "Problems with Examples\n   RFC 1597 gives several examples of IP networks that\
    \ need not have\n   globally unique address spaces.  Each of those cases is plausible,\n\
    \   but that does not make it legitimate to ENCOURAGE non-uniqueness of\n   the\
    \ addresses.  In fact, it is equally plausible that globally unique\n   IP addresses\
    \ will be required, for every one of the scenarios\n   described in RFC 1597:\n\
    \   - Airport displays are public information and multicasting beyond the\n  \
    \   airport might be useful.\n   - An organization's machines which, today, do\
    \ not need global\n     connectivity might need it tomorrow.  Further, merging\n\
    \     organizations creates havoc when the addresses collide.\n   - Current use\
    \ of firewalls is an artifact of limitations in the\n     technology.  Let's fix\
    \ the problem, not the symptom.\n   - Inter-organization private links do not\
    \ generate benefit from being\n     any more correct in guessing which machines\
    \ want to interact than\n     is true for general Internet access.\n   This is\
    \ another point that warrants repetition: the belief that\n   administrators can\
    \ predict which machines will need Internet access\n   is quite simply wrong.\
    \  We need to reduce or eliminate the penalties\n   associated with that error,\
    \ in order to encourage as much Internet\n   connectivity as operational policies\
    \ and technical security permit.\n   RFC 1597 works very much against this goal.\n"
- title: Problems With "Advantages" And More Disadvantages
  contents:
  - "Problems With \"Advantages\" And More Disadvantages\n   RFC 1597 claims that\
    \ Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) will\n   require enterprises to renumber\
    \ their networks.  In the general case,\n   this will only involve those networks\
    \ that are routed outside of\n   enterprises.  Since RFC 1597 addresses private\
    \ enterprise networks,\n   this argument does not apply.\n   The authors mention\
    \ that DCHP-based tools [2] might help network\n   number transition.  However,\
    \ it is observed that by and large such\n   tools are currently only \"potential\"\
    \ in nature.\n   Additionally, with the onslaught of ISDN, slip, and PPP in host\n\
    \   implementations, the potential for a workstation to become a router\n   inadvertently\
    \ has never been greater.  Use of a common set of\n   addresses for private networks\
    \ virtually assures administrators of\n   having their networks partitioned, if\
    \ they do not take care to\n   carefully control modem connections.\n   Finally,\
    \ RFC 1597 implies that it may be simple to change a host's IP\n   address.  For\
    \ a variety of reasons this may not be the case, and it\n   is not the norm today.\
    \  For example, a host may be well known within\n   a network.  It may have long\
    \ standing services such as NFS, which\n   would cause problems for clients were\
    \ its address changed.  A host\n   may have software licenses locked by IP address.\
    \  Thus, migrating a\n   host from private to global addressing may prove difficult.\
    \  At the\n   very least, one should be careful about addressing well known hosts.\n"

- title: IANA Has Overstepped Their Mandate
  contents:
  - "IANA Has Overstepped Their Mandate\n   For many years, IANA has followed an assignment\
    \ policy based on the\n   expectation of Internet connectivity for ALL assignees.\
    \  As such it\n   serves to encourage interconnectivity.  IANA assignment of the\n\
    \   network numbers listed in RFC 1597 serves to formally authorize\n   behavior\
    \ contrary to this accepted practice.  Further, this change\n   was effected without\
    \ benefit of community review and approval.\n   RFC 1597 specifies a new operational\
    \ requirement explicitly: network\n   service providers must filter the IANA assigned\
    \ network numbers\n   listed in RFC 1597 from their routing tables.  This address\
    \ space\n   allocation is permanently removed from being used on the Internet.\n\
    \   As we read RFC 1601 [3], this action is not within the purview of\n   IANA,\
    \ which should only be assigning numbers within the current\n   standards and\
    \ axioms that underlie the Internet.  IP network numbers\n   are assigned uniquely\
    \ under the assumption that they will be used on\n   the Internet at some future\
    \ date.  Such assignments violate that\n   axiom, and constitute an architectural\
    \ change to the Internet.  RFC\n   1602 [4] and RFC 1310 [5] also contain identical\
    \ wording to this\n   effect in the section that describes IANA.\n   While RFC\
    \ 1597 contains a view worthy of public debate, it is not\n   ready for formal\
    \ authorization.  Hence, we strongly encourage IANA to\n   withdraw its IP address\
    \ assignments documented by RFC 1597 forthwith.\n   The IAB should review the\
    \ address assignment policies and procedures\n   that compose IANA's mandate,\
    \ and reaffirm the commitment to a\n   globally unique IP address space.\n"

  - "COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n   The Internet technology and service is predicated\
    \ on a global address\n   space.  Members of the Internet community have already\
    \ experienced\n   and understood the problems and pains associated with uncoordinated\n\
    \   private network number assignments.  In effect the proposal attempts\n   to\

    \ model.  Hence, it needs to be considered much more\n   thoroughly.\n   RFC 1597\
    \ gives the illusion of remedying a problem, by creating\n   formal structure\
    \ to a long-standing informal practice.  In fact, the\n   structure distracts\
    \ us from the need to solve these very real\n   problems and does not even provide\
    \ substantive aid in the near-term.\n   In the past we have all dreaded the idea\

    \   path, we as a community should revisit the reasoning behind the\n   preaching\
    \ of unique addressing.  While RFC 1597 attempts to change\n   this model, its\
    \ costs and limitations for enterprises can be\n   enormous, both in the short\
    \ and long term.\n"
