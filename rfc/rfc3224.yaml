  - "1.0 Introduction\n   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [1] defines a number\
    \ of\n   features which are extensible.  This document clarifies exactly which\n\
    \   mechanisms can be used to that end (Sections 3-5) and which cannot\n   (Section\
    \ 6).  This document updates [1], specifying conventions that\n   ensure the protocol\
    \ extension mechanisms in the SLPv2 specification\n   will not possibly have ambiguous\
    \ interpretations.\n   This specification introduces only one new protocol element,\
    \ the\n   Vendor Opaque Extension.  This Extension makes it possible for a\n \
    \  vendor to extend SLP independently, once the vendor has registered\n   itself\
    \ with IANA and obtained an Enterprise Number.  This is useful\n   for vendor-specific\
    \ applications.\n   Vendor extensions to standard protocols come at a cost.\n\
    \      -  Vendor extensions occur without review from the community.\n       \
    \  They may not make good engineering sense in the context of the\n         protocol\
    \ they extend, and the engineers responsible may\n         discover this too late.\n\
    \      -  Vendor extensions preclude interoperation with compliant but\n     \
    \    non-extended implementations.  There is a real danger of\n         incompatibility\
    \ if different implementations support different\n         feature sets.\n   \
    \   -  By extending SLPv2 privately, ubiquitous automatic\n         configuration\
    \ is impossible, which is the primary benefit of a\n         standard service\
    \ discovery framework.\n   For these reasons, registration of service templates\
    \ with IANA is\n   strongly encouraged!  This process is easy and has proved to\
    \ be rapid\n   (taking less than 2 weeks in most cases).\n"
- title: 1.1 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1 Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\",\n   \"optional\", \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\", are\
    \ to be\n   interpreted as described in [2].\n   Service Location Protocol terminology\
    \ is defined in [1].  IANA\n   registration terminology is defined in [5].\n"
- title: 2.0 Enterprise Number
  contents:
  - "2.0 Enterprise Number\n   Enterprise Numbers are used to distinguish different\
    \ vendors in IETF\n   protocols.  Vendor Extensions to SLPv2 SHOULD use these\
    \ values to\n   avoid any possibility of a name space collision.  Each vendor\
    \ is\n   responsible for ensuring that vendor extensions under their own\n   authority\
    \ are non-conflicting.\n   IANA maintains a repository of all 'SMI Network Management\
    \ Private\n   Enterprise Codes,' whose prefix is\n   iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise\
    \ (1.3.6.1.4.1).  The number\n   which follows is unique and may be registered\
    \ by an on-line form [3].\n   The complete up-to-date list of Enterprise Numbers\
    \ is maintained by\n   IANA [3].\n"
- title: 3.0 Naming Authorities
  contents:
  - "3.0 Naming Authorities\n   Naming Authorities are defined by SLPv2 [1] as an\
    \ agency or group\n   which catalogues Service Types and attributes.\n   A Service\
    \ Type is a string representing a service which can be\n   discovered by SLPv2.\
    \  Attributes may be associated with a particular\n   Service Type which is advertised\
    \ by SLPv2.\n   Service Type strings and service attributes may be registered\
    \ with\n   IANA by creating a Service Template [4].  The template is included\
    \ in\n   an internet draft and an email message is sent to srvloc-\n   list@iana.org\
    \ requesting that the template be included in the Service\n   Template registry.\
    \  In this case, the naming authority for the\n   service type is IANA.\n   It\
    \ is also possible for a Vendor to create their own naming\n   authority.  In\
    \ this case, any service type or attribute may be used.\n   SLPv2 allows arbitrary\
    \ naming authorities to coexist.  To use an\n   explicit naming authority, a vendor\
    \ simply employs their Enterprise\n   Number as a naming authority.  For example,\
    \ for the following\n   (fictitious) Enterprise Number\n      9999  Acme, Inc.\
    \              Erik Guttman  femur@example.com\n   the Naming Authority string\
    \ to use would be \"9999\".  A service: URL\n   which used this Naming Authority\
    \ to advertise a Roadrunner Detector\n   service could look like\n      service:roadrunner-detector.9999://example.com:9341\n\
    \   Service types which are defined under a naming authority based on an\n   Enterprise\
    \ Number are guaranteed not to conflict with other service\n   type strings which\
    \ mean something entirely different.  That is also\n   true of attributes defined\
    \ for service types defined under a naming\n   authority.\n   To create a safe\
    \ naming authority with no possibility of name\n   collisions, a vendor SHOULD\
    \ use their Enterprise Number as a naming\n   authority.\n"
- title: 4.0 Vendor Defined Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.0 Vendor Defined Attributes\n   SLPv2 [1] suggests that\n      Non-standard\
    \ attribute names SHOULD begin with \"x-\", because no\n      standard attribute\
    \ name will ever have those initial characters.\n   It is possible that two non-standard\
    \ attributes will conflict that\n   both use the \"x-\" prefix notation.  For\
    \ that reason, vendors SHOULD\n   use \"x-\" followed by their Enterprise Number\
    \ followed by a \"-\" to\n   guarantee that the non-standard attribute name's\
    \ interpretation is\n   not ambiguous.\n   For example, Acme, Inc.'s Enterprise\
    \ Number is 9999.  Say the Service\n   Template for NetHive (a fictitious game)\
    \ was:\n     ------------------------------------------------------------\n  \
    \   template-type=NetHive\n     template-version=1.0\n     template-description=\n\
    \       The popular NetHive game.\n     template-url-syntax=\n       url-path\
    \ = ; There is no path for a NetHive service URL.\n     features= string M O\n\
    \     # The list of optional features the NetHive server supports.\n     secure\
    \ session, fast mode\n     current-users= string M\n     # The list of users currently\
    \ playing\n     ------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Acme's server advertises a feature which is not on the list of\n   standard\
    \ features, \"x-9999-cheat-mode\".  Only an Acme client would\n   request this\
    \ attribute to discover servers, since it is not standard.\n"

    \ description of different mechanisms available for\n   registration of values\
    \ with IANA.\n   SLPv2 may be extended in any of three ways.\n   (1)   Anyone\
    \ may request the designated expert for SLP to register a\n         new extension\
    \ ID with IANA.  Send requests to the\n         svrloc-list@iana.org.\n      \
    \   It is recommended that an internet draft specifying this\n         extension\
    \ be published, with the intention of publishing the\n         document as an\
    \ Informational RFC.  This way others can use the\n         extension as well.\
    \  This is not a 'vendor extension' - rather\n         this is the preferred way\
    \ of extending the protocol in a vendor\n         neutral manner.\n         If\
    \ no specification is published and the extension is intended\n         for vendor\
    \ specific use only - the 'Vendor Extension' option\n         below probably makes\
    \ more sense than assigning an extension ID.\n   (2)   An experimental extension\
    \ may be done using the range 0x8000 to\n         0x8FFF.  There is always the\
    \ risk, however, that another vendor\n         will use the same ID, since these\
    \ IDs are not registered.\n   (3)   A Vendor Extension may be used.  This extension\
    \ allows a Vendor\n         to define their own extensions which are guaranteed\
    \ to have a\n         unique interpretation.  It is OPTIONAL to implement.\n"
