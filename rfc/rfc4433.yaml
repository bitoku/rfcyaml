  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document adds to the Mobile IP protocol [1], by proposing
    a\n   messaging mechanism for dynamic home agent assignment and home agent\n   redirection
    during initial registration.  The goal is to assign an\n   optimal HA for a Mobile
    IP session.  The mobile node MUST use the\n   Network Access Identifier (NAI)
    extension [2] when requesting a\n   dynamically assigned HA.\n   The MN requests
    a dynamically assigned HA by setting the HA field in\n   the initial Registration
    Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR (defined in\n   Section 2).  If the request is accepted,
    the HA sends a successful\n   Registration Reply containing the HA's own address.
    \ The requested HA\n   can suggest an alternate HA and if so, the Registration
    Reply is\n   rejected with a new error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and the alternate
    HA\n   address is specified in a new extension (Redirected HA Extension).\n   This
    document also defines a new Requested HA Extension for use in\n   Registration
    Requests when the HA field is set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.\n   The Requested HA address
    is a hint to the network about the MN's\n   preferred HA.\n   The messaging mechanism
    is defined in this document so that the MN\n   can request and receive a dynamic
    HA address in Mobile IP messages.\n   However, the mechanism by which the network
    selects an HA for\n   assignment to the MN is outside the scope of this document.
    \ For\n   example, the selection may be made by any network node that receives\n
    \  the Registration Request (or information about the Registration\n   Request),
    such as a Foreign Agent, AAA server, or home agent.  The\n   node that selects
    the HA may select one based on a number of\n   criteria, including but not limited
    to HA load-balancing,\n   geographical proximity, administrative policy, etc.\n"

  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   The Mobile IPv4 NAI Extension for IPv4 [2] introduced
    the concept of\n   identifying an MN by the NAI and enabling dynamic home address\n
    \  assignment.  When the home address is dynamically assigned, it is\n   desirable
    to discover the home agent dynamically or inform the MN\n   about an optimal HA
    to use for a multitude of reasons, such as:\n   - If the distance between the
    visited network and the home network of\n     the mobile node is large, the signaling
    delay for these\n     registrations may be long.  In such a case, the MN will
    be anchored\n     to its distant home agent, resulting in tunneled traffic traveling\n
    \    a long distance between home agent and the mobile node.  When a\n     Mobile
    IP session initiates, if the mobile node can be assigned a\n     home agent that
    is close to the mobile node it can drastically\n     reduce the latency between
    the home agent and mobile node.\n   - In a large-scale Mobile IP deployment, it
    is cumbersome to\n     provision MNs with multiple HA addresses.\n   - It is desirable
    to achieve some form of load balancing between\n     multiple HAs in the network.
    \ Dynamic HA assignment and/or HA\n     redirection lets the network select the
    optimal HA from among a set\n     of HAs and thus achieve load balancing among
    a group of HAs.\n   - Local administrative policies.\n"

    - "3.1.  Scope\n   This specification does not address the problem of distributing
      a\n   security association between the MN and HA, and it can either be\n   statically
      preconfigured or dynamically distributed using other\n   mechanisms [7].\n   The
      document introduces the terms Requested/Assigned/Redirected HA\n   (Section
      6).  The discovery of candidate HA addresses for insertion\n   into the Redirected
      HA Extension can be accomplished through various\n   means that are network
      and/or deployment specific and hence are\n   outside the scope of this specification.\n
      \  The MN MAY request dynamic HA assignment when it is not aware of any\n   HA
      address and even when it is aware of at least one HA address.\n"

    - "3.2.  Dynamic Home Agent Discovery in Mobile IPv4\n   Mobile IPv4 [1] specifies
      the mechanism for discovering the mobile\n   node's home agent using subnet-directed
      broadcast IP address in the\n   home agent field of the Registration Request.
      \ This mechanism was\n   designed for mobile nodes with a static home address
      and subnet\n   prefix, anchored on fixed home network.  However, using subnet-\n
      \  directed broadcast as the destination IP address of the Registration\n   Request,
      it is unlikely that the Registration Request will reach the\n   home subnet
      because routers will drop these packets by default.  See\n   CERT Advisory CA-1998-01

      using dynamic HA\n   assignment, MN MUST use the NAI and obtain a home address.
      \ MN can\n   still suggest a static home address in the Registration Request,
      but\n   must take the address in the Registration Reply as the home address\n

- contents:
  - "4.  Messaging Mechanism for Dynamic HA Assignment/Redirection\n   This specification
    presents two alternatives for home agent\n   assignment:\n   (a) Dynamic HA assignment
    (described in Section 4.1) and\n   (b) HA redirection (described in Section 4.2).\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Messaging for Dynamic HA Assignment\n   The following sequence of events
      occurs when the MN requests dynamic\n   home agent assignment:\n   1.  The MN
      sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration\n       Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.
      \ If the MN is aware of a desired HA\n       address, it can add that address
      in the Requested HA Extension in\n       the Registration Request.  If the HA
      does not support the\n       Requested HA Extension, see step 2 below.\n   2.
      \ This step is applicable, in lieu of step 1, for an MN that is\n       aware
      of the HA address and desires dynamic HA assignment.  Also,\n       the MN follows
      this (when aware of a HA address) when it\n       discovers a legacy FA in the
      path or if the known HA does not\n       support the Requested HA Extension
      (see Section 10).\n       The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration\n
      \      Request to the HA address (instead of setting it to ALL-ZERO-\n       ONE-ADDR).
      \ The MN also adds the same HA address in the Requested\n       HA Extension
      in the Registration Request.\n   3.  The MN (if using co-located CoA and registering
      directly with the\n       HA) or the FA (if the MN is registering via the FA)
      sends the\n       Registration Request to the \"Requested HA\".  If the Requested
      HA\n       Extension is present, Requested HA is specified in the \"HA\n       Address\"
      of this extension.\n       Per Section 10, in case of a legacy FA, legacy FA
      forwards the\n       Registration Request to the address in the HA field of
      the\n       request (thus, MN uses step 2 above in case of legacy FA instead\n
      \      of step 1).\n   4.  The \"Requested HA\" is the home agent that processes
      the\n       Registration Request in accordance with Mobile IPv4 [1] and as\n
      \      per the specification in this document.  It creates mobility\n       binding
      for a successful Registration Request.  It also sends a\n       Registration
      Reply to the MN.\n   5.  The MN obtains an \"Assigned HA\" address from the
      HA field in the\n       successful Registration Reply and uses it for the remainder
      of\n       the session.  (Note that the \"Assigned HA\" will be the same as\n
      \      the \"Requested HA\".)\n   6.  Subsequent Registration Request messages
      for renewal are sent to\n       the Assigned HA.\n   Section 5.3.1 describes
      the Assigned HA in detail.  Some ideas on how\n   to select the Requested HA
      are briefly covered in Section 6.\n"

        Flow for Dynamic HA Assignment\n   1.  The MN sets the Home Agent address
        field in the Registration\n       Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  Since the
        MN is using FA CoA in\n       this example, it sends the Registration Request
        to the FA.  The\n       Registration Request is formatted as follows:\n       +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n

        \ MN    |    FA      |         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |\n       +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n
        \      If the MN is aware of a desired HA address, it can add that\n       address
        in the Requested HA Extension in Registration Request as\n       a hint.  That
        extension is not shown above.\n   2.  The FA sends the Registration Request
        to the Requested HA.  If\n       the Requested HA Extension is present, Requested
        HA is the HA\n       address in this extension.  If the Requested HA Extension
        is not\n       present, the FA determines the Requested HA through means outside\n
        \      the scope of this specification.  The Registration Request is\n       formatted
        as follows:\n       +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n
        \      | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |\n       |

        \      (If MN includes the Requested HA Extension, the FA copies that\n       extension.

        mobility binding for successful request and becomes\n       the Assigned HA.

      and redirects the\n       mobile node to another HA (aka Redirected HA) instead.
      \ This\n       behavior is not exhibited by a legacy HA and so is not referred\n
      \      in the description below.  In presence of a legacy FA, please\n       refer
      to Section 4.1 for the specific field in the Registration\n       Request.\n

      directly with the\n       HA) or FA (if the MN is registering via the FA) sends
      the\n       Registration Request to the \"Requested HA\".  If the MN is aware\n
      \      of an HA address, it can add that address in the Requested HA\n       Extension
      in the Registration Request.\n   3.  When the HA receives the Registration Request,
      if the HA field is\n       set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, the HA may reject the request
      with\n       Reply code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and suggest an alternate HA.\n       The
      HA may reject the request for a number of reasons, which are\n       outside
      the scope of this specification.  If the HA rejects the\n       Request, the
      HA field in the Reply is set to this HA's address.\n       The IP address of
      the HA that is the target of the redirection is\n       specified in Redirected
      HA Extension.  The presence of this\n       extension is mandatory when the

        Message Flow for HA Redirection\n   1.  The MN sets the Home Agent address
        field in the Registration\n       Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  Since the
        MN is using FA CoA in\n       this example, it sends the Registration Request
        to the FA.  The\n       Registration Request is formatted as follows:\n       +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n

        Requested HA Extension in the Registration Request as a hint.\n       That
        extension is not shown above.\n   2.  The FA sends the Registration Request
        to the Requested HA.  If\n       Requested HA Extension is present, Requested
        HA is the HA address\n       in this extension.  If the Requested HA Extension
        is not present,\n       the FA determines the Requested HA through means outside

        \  3.  The HA processes the Registration Request in accordance with\n       Mobile
        IPv4 [1] and the messaging defined in this specification.\n       If the registration
        is successful, but local\n       configuration/administrative policy, etc.,
        directs the HA to\n       refer the MN to another HA, the HA rejects the request

        \  5.  If the MN can authenticate the Reply, the MN extracts the HA\n       address
        from the Redirected HA Extension.  The MN then sends a\n       Registration

        use in the new\n                              Redirected HA Extension.\n     Table
        1: Registration Request Handling at Assigned HA\n   As per the messaging proposed
        here, the mobile node (or the foreign\n   agent) sends the Registration Request
        to the Requested HA address,\n   which is a unicast address.  Therefore, this
        document does not\n   specify any new behavior for the case where the HA receives
        a subnet\n   directed broadcast Registration Request as specified in Section\n
        \  3.8.2.1 of the Mobile IPv4 specification [1].  Although the Home\n   Agent
        field in the Registration Request is not a unicast address, the\n   destination
        IP address is a unicast address.  This avoids the problem\n   associated with
        subnet-directed broadcast destination IP address that\n   may result in multiple
        HAs responding.  Thus, there is no need to\n   deny the registration as stated
        in Mobile IPv4 [1] Section 3.8.3.2.\n   When the destination IP address is
        a unicast address and the Home\n   Agent field is ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, the HA
        accepts/denies registration\n   and sets the HA field to its own IP address
        in the reply (i.e., the\n   registration is not rejected with error code 136).\n
        \  The HA can reject the request with the error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and\n
        \  suggest an alternate HA.  This redirection can be used for load\n   balancing,
        geographical proximity based on Care-of Address, or other\n   reasons.  The
        HA puts its own address in the HA field of the\n   Registration Reply message
        and puts the address of the redirected HA\n   in the Redirected HA Extension.
        \ If the HA accepts the Request, it\n   sets the HA field in the Registration
        Reply to its own address.\n   The Requested HA always performs standard validity
        checks on the\n   Registration Request.  If there is any error, the Registration\n
        \  Request is rejected with error codes specified in Mobile IPv4 [1].\n"

  - "6.  Requested Home Agent Selection\n   When dynamic HA assignment is requested,
    the MN (or FA in the case of\n   registration via FA) sends the Registration Request
    to the Requested\n   HA.  This address MUST be a unicast IP address.  If the MN
    has\n   included a Requested HA Extension in the Registration Request, the HA\n
    \  address in this extension is the Requested HA.\n   Some examples of methods
    by which the MN or the FA may select the\n   Requested HA are briefly described
    below:\n   DHCP:\n      The MN performs DHCP to obtain an IP address on the visited\n
    \     network.  The Requested HA is learned from the DHCP Mobile IP Home\n      Agent
    Option 68 [4].  The MN sends the Registration Request\n      directly to this
    HA and receives the Assigned HA to be used for\n      the remainder of the Mobile
    IP session.\n   AAA:\n      MN performs challenge/response [5] with the FA.  The
    FA retrieves\n      the Requested HA from the AAA server and forwards the Registration\n
    \     Request directly to this HA.  The Assigned HA sends a Registration\n      Reply
    to the FA, which relays it to the MN.  MN uses the Assigned\n      HA for the
    remainder of the Mobile IP session.\n   DNS:\n      In this case, the hostname
    of the HA is configured on the MN or\n      obtained by some other means, e.g.,
    using a service location\n      protocol.  The MN performs DNS lookup on the HA
    hostname.  The DNS\n      infrastructure provides a resource record with information
    to\n      identify the optimal HA to the MN.  The MN sends a Registration\n      Request
    directly to the HA and receives the Assigned HA to be used\n      for the remainder
    of the Mobile IP session.\n   Static configuration:\n      The HA address is statically
    configured on the MN.  The MN sends\n      the Registration Request to the configured
    address.  The Requested\n      HA may then redirect the MN to a Redirected HA.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This specification assumes that a security configuration
    has been\n   preconfigured between the MN and the HA or is configured along with\n
    \  the initial Registration Request/Registration Reply as per [7].\n   There is
    a possibility of more than one HA creating a mobility\n   binding entry for a
    given MN, if a man in the middle captures the\n   Registration Request with the
    HA field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR and\n   forwards it to other HAs.  This scenario
    assumes that the rogue node\n   can find out the addresses of the HAs that are
    able to authenticate\n   the Registration Request.  It also assumes that the rogue
    node has\n   the capability to store, duplicate, and send packets to the other
    HAs\n   within the limited time of the replay window.  Otherwise, these HAs\n
    \  will reject the Registration Requests anyway.  In addition, this type\n   of
    attack is only possible when the Requested HA Extension is not\n   included in
    the registration message.  The mobile node can minimize\n   the duration of this
    condition by using a short lifetime (e.g., 5\n   seconds) in the Registration
    Request.\n   This specification does not change the security model established
    in\n   Mobile IPv4 [1].  Mobile nodes are often connected to the network via\n
    \  wireless links, which may be more prone to passive eavesdropping or\n   replay
    attacks.  Such an attack might lead to bogus registrations or\n   redirection
    of traffic or denial of service.\n   As per the messaging in this document, the
    Assigned Home Agent will\n   process the incoming Registration Request as per
    Mobile IPv4 [1].\n   Hence the Assigned Home Agent will have the same security
    concerns as\n   those of the home agent in Mobile IPv4 [1].  They are addressed
    in\n   Section 5, \"Security Considerations\", of Mobile IPv4 [1].\n   The Registration
    Request and Registration Reply messages are\n   protected by a valid authenticator
    as specified in Mobile IPv4 [1].\n   Configuring security associations is a deployment-specific
    issue and\n   is covered by other Mobile IP specifications.  There can be many
    ways\n   of configuring security associations, but this specification does not\n
    \  require any specific way.\n   An example is where the security association
    between an MN and an\n   individual HA (Requested or Assigned) is dynamically
    derived during\n   the registration process based on a shared secret between MN
    and AAA\n   infrastructure, as defined in [7].  The Registration Request is\n
    \  protected with MN-AAA Authentication Extension, and Registration\n   Reply
    is protected with MN-HA Authentication Extension.  Because the\n   security association
    is shared between MN and AAA, any dynamically\n   assigned HA in the local domain
    can proxy authenticate the MN using\n   AAA as per [7].\n   The Assigned Home
    Agent authenticates each Registration Request from\n   the mobile node as specified
    in Mobile IPv4 [1] and/or RFC 3012.  The\n   MN also authenticates the Registration
    Reply from the Assigned HA;\n   thus, the existing trust model in Mobile IPv4
    [1] is maintained.\n"

  - "10.  Backward-Compatibility Considerations\n   In this section, we examine concerns
    that may arise when using this\n   specification in a mixed environment where
    some nodes implement the\n   specification and others do not.  In each of the
    examples below, we\n   consider the case where one node is a \"legacy\" node,
    which does not\n   implement the specification in the context of other nodes that
    do.\n   Legacy Home Agent:\n   Legacy home agents may reject the Registration
    Request with error\n   code 136 because the Home Agent field is not a unicast
    address.\n   However, some legacy HA implementations may coincidentally process\n
    \  the Registration Request in accordance with this document, when the\n   HA
    field in Registration Request is set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.\n   Legacy Foreign
    Agent:\n   Legacy foreign agents may forward a Registration Request with home\n
    \  agent field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR by setting the destination IP\n   address
    to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  This will result in the packet being\n   dropped or incidentally
    handled by a next-hop HA, adjacent to the FA.\n   The MN may not be aware of the
    dropped Registration Request and may\n   probably retry registration, thereby
    increasing the delay in\n   registration.\n   To reduce the delay in registration,
    the MN should take the following\n   steps:\n   1.  The MN should send the Registration
    Request as specified in this\n       specification.  In other words, the MN should
    set the Home Agent\n       field in the Registration Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR
    and also\n       add the Requested HA Extension.\n   2.  If the MN does not receive
    a Registration Reply within some time\n       and/or after sending a few Registration
    Requests, it can assume\n       that the Registration Request(s) has been dropped,
    either by a\n       legacy FA or an incorrect HA.  In addition, if the registration\n
    \      is denied with error code 70 (poorly formed Request), the MN can\n       assume
    that the legacy FA cannot process this message.  In either\n       case, the MN
    should fall back to a recovery mechanism.  The MN\n       should quickly send
    a new Registration Request as mentioned in\n       Section 4.1 step 2.  This step
    will ensure that a legacy FA will\n       forward the Registration Request to
    the home agent thereby making\n       dynamic HA assignment possible.\n   Legacy
    Mobile Node:\n   An MN that sends a Registration Request to an FA that can do
    dynamic\n   HA assignment, but does not set the HA field to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR\n
    \  will continue to be registered with its statically configured HA,\n   exactly
    according to RFC 3344.\n"
