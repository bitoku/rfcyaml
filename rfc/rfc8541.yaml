- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Link state IGP protocols are based on a topology database\
    \ on which\n   the SPF algorithm is run to find a consistent set of non-looping\n\
    \   routing paths.\n   Specifications like IS-IS [RFC1195] propose some optimizations\
    \ of the\n   route computation (see Appendix C.1 of [RFC1195]), but not all\n\
    \   implementations follow those non-mandatory optimizations.\n   In this document,\
    \ we refer to the events that lead to a new SPF\n   computation based on the topology\
    \ as \"SPF triggers\".\n   Link state IGP protocols, like OSPF [RFC2328] and IS-IS\
    \ [RFC1195],\n   use multiple timers to control the router behavior in case of\
    \ churn:\n   SPF delay, Partial Route Computation (PRC) delay, Link State Packet\n\
    \   (LSP) generation delay, LSP flooding delay, and LSP retransmission\n   interval.\n\
    \   Some of the values and behaviors of these timers are standardized in\n   protocol\
    \ specifications, and some are not.  The SPF computation-\n   related timers have\
    \ generally remained unspecified.\n   Implementations are free to implement non-standardized\
    \ timers in any\n   way.  For some standardized timers, implementations may offer\n\
    \   dynamically adjusted timers to help control the churn rather than use\n  \
    \ static configurable values.\n   \"SPF delay\" refers to the timer in most implementations\
    \ that\n   specifies the required delay before running an SPF computation after\n\
    \   an SPF trigger is received.\n   A micro-loop is a packet-forwarding loop that\
    \ may occur transiently\n   among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet-forwarding\
    \ paradigm.\n   These micro-loops are formed when two routers do not update their\n\
    \   Forwarding Information Bases (FIBs) for a certain prefix at the same\n   time.\
    \  The micro-loop phenomenon is described in [MICROLOOP-LSRP].\n   Two micro-loop\
    \ mitigation techniques have been defined by IETF.  The\n   mechanism in [RFC6976]\
    \ has not been widely implemented, presumably\n   due to the complexity of the\
    \ technique.  The mechanism in [RFC8333]\n   has been implemented.  However, it\
    \ does not prevent all micro-loops\n   that can occur for a given topology and\
    \ failure scenario.\n   In multi-vendor networks, using different implementations\
    \ of a link\n   state protocol may favor micro-loop creation during the convergence\n\
    \   process due to discrepancies in timers.  Service providers already\n   know\
    \ to use timers with similar values and behaviors for all of the\n   network as\
    \ a best practice, but this is sometimes not possible due to\n   the limitations\
    \ of implementations.\n   This document presents reasons for service providers\
    \ to have\n   consistent implementation of link state protocols across vendors.\
    \  In\n   particular, this document analyzes the impact of using different link\n\
    \   state IGP implementations in a single network with regard to micro-\n   loops.\
    \  The analysis focuses on the SPF delay algorithm.\n   [RFC8405] defines a solution\
    \ that partially addresses this problem\n   statement, and this document captures\
    \ the reasoning of the provided\n   solution.\n"

    \    Figure 1: Network Topology Experiencing Micro-loops\n   Figure 1 represents\
    \ a small network composed of four routers (S, D,\n   E, and A).  Router S primarily\
    \ uses the SD link to reach the prefixes\n   behind router D (named Px).  When\
    \ the SD link fails, the IGP\n   convergence occurs.  If S converges before E,\
    \ S will forward the\n   traffic to Px through E; however, because E has not converged\
    \ yet, E\n   will loop the traffic back to S, leading to a micro-loop.\n   The\
    \ micro-loop appears due to the asynchronous convergence of nodes\n   in a network\
    \ when an event occurs.\n   Multiple factors (or a combination of factors) may\
    \ increase the\n   probability of a micro-loop appearing:\n   o  Delay of failure\
    \ notification: The greater the time gap between E\n      and S being advised\
    \ of the failure, the greater the chance that a\n      micro-loop may appear.\n\
    \   o  SPF delay: Most implementations support a delay for the SPF\n      computation\
    \ to catch as many events as possible.  If S uses an SPF\n      delay timer of\
    \ x ms, E uses an SPF delay timer of y ms, and x < y,\n      E would start converging\
    \ after S, leading to a potential micro-\n      loop.\n   o  SPF computation time:\
    \ This is mostly a matter of CPU power and\n      optimizations like incremental\
    \ SPF.  If S computes its SPF faster\n      than E, there is a chance for a micro-loop\
    \ to appear.  Today, CPUs\n      are fast enough to consider the SPF computation\
    \ time as negligible\n      (on the order of milliseconds in a large network).\n\
    \   o  SPF computation ordering: An SPF trigger can be common to multiple\n  \
    \    IGP areas or levels (e.g., IS-IS Level 1 and Level 2) or to\n      multiple\
    \ address families with multi-topologies.  There is no\n      specified order\
    \ for SPF computation today, and it is\n      implementation dependent.  In such\
    \ scenarios, if the order of SPF\n      computation done in S and E for each area,\
    \ level, topology, or SPF\n      algorithm is different, there is a possibility\
    \ for a micro-loop to\n      appear.\n   o  RIB and FIB prefix insertion speed\
    \ or ordering: This is highly\n      dependent on the implementation.\n   Even\
    \ if all of these factors increase the probability of a micro-loop\n   appearing,\
    \ the SPF delay plays a significant role, especially in case\n   of churn.  As\
    \ the number of IGP events increases, the delta between\n   the SPF delay values\
    \ used by routers becomes significant; in fact, it\n   becomes the dominating\
    \ factor (especially when one router increases\n   its timer exponentially while\
    \ another one increases it in a smoother\n   way).  Another important factor is\
    \ the time to update the FIB.  As of\n   today, the total FIB update time is the\
    \ major factor for IGP\n   convergence.  However, for micro-loops, what matters\
    \ is not the total\n   time but the difference in installing the same prefix between\
    \ nodes.\n   The time to update the FIB may be the main part for the first\n \
    \  iteration but not for subsequent IGP events.  In addition, the time\n   to\
    \ update the FIB is very implementation specific and difficult or\n   impossible\
    \ to standardize, while the SPF delay algorithm may be\n   standardized.\n   As\
    \ a consequence, this document will focus on an analysis of SPF\n   delay behavior\
    \ and associated triggers.\n"

  - "3.  SPF Trigger Strategies\n   Depending on the change advertised in the LSP\
    \ or LSA (Link State\n   Advertisement), the topology may or may not be affected.\
    \  An\n   implementation may avoid running the SPF computation (and may only\n\
    \   run an IP reachability computation instead) if the advertised change\n   does\
    \ not affect the topology.\n   Different strategies can trigger the SPF computation:\n\
    \   1.  An implementation may always run a full SPF for any type of\n       change.\n\
    \   2.  An implementation may run a full SPF only when required.  For\n      \
    \ example, if a link fails, a local node will run an SPF for its\n       local\
    \ LSP update.  If the LSP from the neighbor (describing the\n       same failure)\
    \ is received after SPF has started, the local node\n       can decide that a\
    \ new full SPF is not required as the topology\n       has not changed.\n   3.\
    \  If the topology does not change, an implementation may only\n       recompute\
    \ the IP reachability.\n   As noted in Section 1, SPF optimizations are not mandatory\
    \ in\n   specifications.  This has led to the implementation of different\n  \
    \ strategies.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Exponential Back-Off Delay\n   The algorithm has two modes: fast mode and\
    \ back-off mode.  In fast\n   mode, the SPF delay is usually delayed by a very\
    \ small amount of time\n   (fast reaction).  When an SPF computation is run in\
    \ fast mode, the\n   algorithm automatically moves to back-off mode (a single\
    \ SPF run is\n   authorized in fast mode).  In back-off mode, the SPF delay increases\n\
    \   exponentially in each run.  When the network becomes stable, the\n   algorithm\
    \ moves back to fast mode.  The SPF delay is managed by four\n   parameters:\n\
    \   o  first delay: amount of time to wait before running SPF.  This\n      delay\

    \              Multiple Events Appear\n   In Table 1, due to discrepancies in\

    \ of the SPF delay are\n   completely misaligned between node S and node E, leading\

    \     Table 3: Route Computation When S and E Use the Same Standardized\n    \
    \                             Behavior\n   As displayed above, there can be other\
    \ parameters, like router\n   computation power and flooding timers, that may\
    \ also influence micro-\n   loops.  In all the examples in this document comparing\
    \ the SPF timer\n   behavior of router S and router E, we have made router E a\
    \ bit slower\n   than router S.  This can lead to micro-loops even when both S\
    \ and E\n   use a common standardized SPF behavior.  However, by aligning\n  \
    \ implementations of the SPF delay, we expect that service providers\n   may reduce\
    \ the number and duration of micro-loops.\n"
