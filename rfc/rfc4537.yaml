  - "1.  Introduction\n   Under the current mechanism [RFC4120], the Kerberos Distribution\n
    \  Center (KDC) must limit the ticket session key encryption type\n   (enctype)
    chosen for a given server to one it believes is supported\n   by both the client
    and the server.  If both the client and server\n   understand a stronger enctype
    than the one selected by the KDC, they\n   cannot negotiate it.  As the result,
    the protection of application\n   traffic is often weaker than necessary when
    the server can support\n   different sets of enctypes depending on the server
    application\n   software being used.\n   This document specifies an extension
    to the Kerberos protocol to\n   allow clients and servers to negotiate use of
    a different and\n   possibly stronger cryptosystem in subsequent communication.\n
    \  This extension utilizes an authorization data element in the\n   authenticator
    of the AP-REQ message [RFC4120].  The client sends the\n   list of enctypes that
    it supports to the server; the server then\n   informs the client of its choice.
    \ The negotiated subkey is sent in\n   the AP-REP message [RFC4120].\n"

  - "3.  Negotiation Extension\n   If the client prefers an enctype over that of the
    service ticket\n   session key, then it SHOULD send a list of enctypes in decreasing\n
    \  preference order to the server.  Based on local policy, the client\n   selects
    enctypes out of all the enctypes available locally to be\n   included in this
    list, and it SHOULD NOT include enctypes that are\n   less preferable than that
    of the ticket session key in the service\n   ticket.  In addition, the client
    SHOULD NOT include negative (local-\n   use) enctype numbers unless it knows a
    priori that the server has\n   been configured to use the same negative enctype
    numbers for the same\n   enctypes.\n   The client sends the enctype list via the
    authorization-data of the\n   authenticator in the AP-REQ [RFC4120].  A new authorization
    data\n   element type AD-ETYPE-NEGOTIATION is defined.\n           AD-ETYPE-NEGOTIATION
    \             129\n   This authorization data element itself is enclosed in the
    AD-IF-\n   RELEVANT container; thus, a correctly implemented server that does\n
    \  not understand this element should ignore it [RFC4120].  The value of\n   this
    authorization element contains the DER [X680] [X690] encoding of\n   the following
    ASN.1 type:\n           EtypeList ::= SEQUENCE OF Int32\n              -- Specifies
    the enctypes supported by the client.\n              -- This enctype list is in
    decreasing preference order\n              -- (favorite choice first).\n              --
    Int32 is defined in [RFC4120].\n   If the EtypeList is present and the server
    prefers an enctype from\n   the client's enctype list over that of the AP-REQ
    authenticator\n   subkey (if that is present) or the service ticket session key,
    the\n   server MUST create a subkey using that enctype.  This negotiated\n   subkey
    is sent in the subkey field of AP-REP message, and it is then\n   used as the
    protocol key or base key [RFC3961] for subsequent\n   communication.\n   If the
    enctype of the ticket session key is included in the enctype\n   list sent by
    the client, it SHOULD be the last on the list;\n   otherwise, this enctype MUST
    NOT be negotiated if it was not included\n   in the list.\n   This negotiation
    extension SHOULD NOT be used when the client does\n   not expect the subkey in
    the AP-REP message from the server.\n   A note on key generation: The KDC has
    a strong Pseudo-Random Number\n   Generator (PRNG); as such, the client can take
    advantage of the\n   randomness provided by the KDC by reusing the KDC key data
    when\n   generating keys.  Implementations SHOULD use the service ticket\n   session
    key value as a source of additional entropy when generating\n   the negotiated
    subkey.  If the AP-REQ authenticator subkey is\n   present, it MAY also be used
    as a source of entropy.\n   The server MAY ignore the preference order indicated
    by the client.\n   The policy by which the client or the server chooses an enctype\n
    \  (i.e., how the preference order for the supported enctypes is\n   selected)
    is a local matter.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The client's enctype list and the server's reply
    enctype are part of\n   encrypted data; thus, the security considerations are
    the same as\n   those of the Kerberos encrypted data.\n   Both the EtypeList and
    the server's sub-session key are protected by\n   the session key or sub-session
    key used for the AP-REQ, and as a\n   result, if a key for a stronger enctype
    is negotiated underneath a\n   key for a weaker enctype, an attacker capable of
    breaking the weaker\n   enctype can also discover the key for the stronger enctype.
    \ The\n   advantage of this extension is to minimize the amount of cipher text\n
    \  encrypted under a weak enctype to which an attacker has access.\n"
