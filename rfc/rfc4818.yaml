  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User\n\
    \   Service) attribute that carries an IPv6 prefix that is to be\n   delegated\
    \ to the user.  This attribute is usable within either RADIUS\n   or Diameter.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute\
    \ as a RADIUS\n   [1] attribute that carries an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to\
    \ the\n   user, for use in the user's network.  For example, the prefix in a\n\
    \   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute can be delegated to another node\n   through\
    \ DHCP Prefix Delegation [2].\n   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute can be used\
    \ in DHCP Prefix\n   Delegation between the delegating router and a RADIUS server,\
    \ as\n   illustrated in the following message sequence.\n   Requesting Router\

    \ Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute [4] is not designed to support\n   delegation of\
    \ IPv6 prefixes to be used in the user's network, and\n   therefore Framed-IPv6-Prefix\
    \ and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attributes may\n   be included in the same RADIUS\
    \ packet.\n"

- title: 5.  Diameter Considerations

  - "5.  Diameter Considerations\n   When used in Diameter, the attribute defined\
    \ in this specification\n   can be used as a Diameter AVP from the Code space\
    \ 1-255, i.e., RADIUS\n   attribute compatibility space.  No additional Diameter\
    \ Code values\n   are therefore allocated.  The data types of the attributes are\
    \ as\n   follows:\n        Delegated-IPv6-Prefix             OctetString\n   The\
    \ attribute in this specification has no special translation\n   requirements\
    \ for Diameter to RADIUS or RADIUS to Diameter gateways,\n   i.e., the attribute\
    \ is copied as is, except for changes relating to\n   headers, alignment, and\
    \ padding.  See also RFC 3588 [5], Section 4.1,\n   and RFC 4005 [6], Section\
    \ 9.\n   The text in this specification describing the applicability of the\n\
    \   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Access-Request applies in\n   Diameter\
    \ to AA-Request [6] or Diameter-EAP-Request [7].\n   The text in this specification\
    \ describing the applicability of the\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for\
    \ RADIUS Access-Accept applies in\n   Diameter to AA-Answer or Diameter-EAP-Answer\
    \ that indicates success.\n   The text in this specification describing the applicability\
    \ of the\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute for RADIUS Accounting-Request applies\n\
    \   to Diameter Accounting-Request [6] as well.\n   The AVP flag rules [5] for\
