  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3775 [RFC3775] contains no provision to allow a home
    agent to\n   inform a mobile node that it needs to stop acting as the home agent\n
    \  for the mobile node.  For example, a home agent may wish to handoff\n   some
    of its mobile nodes to another home agent because it has become\n   overloaded
    or it is going offline.\n   This protocol describes a signaling message, called
    the Home Agent\n   Switch message, that can be used to send a handoff notification\n
    \  between a home agent and mobile node.\n   The Home Agent Switch message does
    not attempt to solve all general\n   problems related to changing the home agent
    of a mobile node.  In\n   particular, this protocol does not attempt to solve:\n
    \     o  The case where the Home Address of a mobile node must change in\n         order
    to switch to a new home agent.  This operation should be\n         avoided using
    this message.\n      o  Determining when a home agent should actively move mobile
    nodes\n         to another home agent.  This decision should be made by a\n         backend
    protocol, for example, as described in [hareliability].\n"

    message\n   would be useful.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Overloaded\n   There are a number of reasons a home agent might be considered\n
      \  overloaded.  One might be that it is at, or near, its limit on the\n   number
      of home bindings it is willing to accept.  Another is that it\n   has reached
      a pre-determined level of system resource usage --\n   memory, cpu cycles, etc.
      \ In either case, it would be desirable for a\n   home agent to reduce the number
      of home bindings before a failure\n   occurs.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Load Balancing\n   A home agent might know of other home agents that
      are not as heavily\n   loaded as itself, learned through some other mechanism
      outside the\n   scope of this document.  An operator may wish to try and balance
      this\n   load so that a failure would disrupt a smaller percentage of mobile\n
      \  nodes.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Load Balancing
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Maintenance\n   Most operators do periodic maintenance in order to maintain\n
      \  reliability.  If a home agent is being shutdown for maintenance, it\n   would
      be desirable to inform mobile nodes so they do not lose\n   mobility service.\n"
    title: 3.3.  Maintenance
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Functional Load Balancing\n   A Mobile IPv6 home agent provides mobile
      nodes with two basic\n   services.  It acts as a rendezvous server where correspondent
      nodes\n   can find the current care-of address for the mobile node, and as an\n
      \  overlay router to tunnel traffic to/from the mobile node at its\n   current
      care-of address.\n   A mobility service provider could have two sets of home
      agents to\n   handle the two functions.  The rendezvous function could be handled\n
      \  by a machine specialized for high-speed transaction processing, while\n   the
      overlay router function could be handled by a machine with high\n   data throughput.\n
      \  A mobile node would start on the rendezvous server home agent and\n   stay
      there if it does route optimization.  However, if the original\n   home agent
      detects that the mobile node is not doing route\n   optimization, but instead
      reverse-tunneling traffic, it could\n   redirect the mobile node to a home agent
      with better data throughput.\n"

    - "3.5.  Home Agent Renumbering\n   Periodically, a mobility service provider
      may want to shut-down home\n   agent services at a set of IPv6 addresses and
      bring service back up\n   at a new set of addresses.  Note that this may not
      involve anything\n   as complex as IPv6 network renumbering [RFC4192]; it may
      just involve\n   changing the addresses of the home agents.  With a signaling
      message,\n   the service provider could inform mobile nodes to look for a new
      home\n   agent.\n"

    - "5.1.  Sending Home Agent Switch Messages\n   When sending a Home Agent Switch
      message, the sending node constructs\n   the packet as it would any other Mobility
      Header, except:\n      o  The MH Type field MUST be set to (12).\n      o  If
      alternative home agent addresses are known, the sending home\n         agent
      SHOULD include them in the list of suggested alternate\n         home agents.
      \ The home agent addresses field should be\n         constructed as described
      in Section 10.5.1 of [RFC3775], which\n         will randomize addresses of
      the same preference in the list.\n      o  The \"# of Addresses\" field MUST
      be filled-in corresponding to\n         the number of home agent addresses included
      in the message.  If\n         no addresses are present, the field MUST be set
      to zero,\n         forcing the mobile node to perform home agent discovery by
      some\n         other means.\n      o  If the home agent is able to continue
      offering services to the\n         mobile node for some period of time, it MAY
      include a Binding\n         Refresh Advice mobility option indicating the time
      (in units of\n         4 seconds) until the binding will be deleted.\n   The
      Home Agent Switch message MUST use the home agent to mobile node\n   IPsec ESP
      (Encapsulating Security Payload) authentication SA\n   (Security Association)
      for integrity protection.\n   A home agent SHOULD send a Home Agent Switch message
      when a known\n   period of unavailability is pending so the mobile node has
      sufficient\n   time to find another suitable home agent.\n   The sending node
      does not need to be the current home agent for the\n   mobile node, for example
      as described in [hareliability], but it MUST\n   have a security association
      with the mobile node so the message is\n   not rejected.  In this case, the
      Home Agent Switch message SHOULD\n   only contain the address of the home agent
      sending the message in the\n   Home Agent Addresses field, which implies that
      the mobile node should\n   switch to using the sender as its new home agent.\n"

      the mobile node --\n   either a Binding Update message to delete its home binding
      if it is\n   the current home agent, or a Binding Update message to create a
      home\n   binding if it is not the current home agent -- then it SHOULD\n   retransmit
      the message until a response is received.  The initial\n   value for the retransmission
      timer is INITIAL-HA-SWITCH-TIMEOUT.\n   The retransmissions by the home agent
      MUST use an exponential back-\n   off mechanism, in which the timeout period
      is doubled upon each\n   retransmission, until either the home agent gets a
      response from the\n   mobile node to delete its binding, or the timeout period
      reaches the\n   value MAX-HA-SWITCH-TIMEOUT.  The home agent MAY continue to
      send\n   these messages at this slower rate indefinitely.\n   If the home agent
      included a Binding Refresh Advice mobility option,\n   then it SHOULD delay
      any retransmissions until at least one half of\n   the time period has expired,

      still has a home\n   binding with the home agent after reaching the timeout
      period of MAX-\n   HA-SWITCH-TIMEOUT, the home agent SHOULD NOT make any conclusions\n
      \  about its status.\n   In either case, the home agent SHOULD attempt to continue
      providing\n   services until the lifetime of the binding expires.\n   Attempts
      by the mobile node to extend the binding lifetime with a\n   Binding Update
      message SHOULD be rejected, and a Binding\n   Acknowledgement SHOULD be returned

      fields\n         MUST meet the requirements of Section 9.2 of [RFC3775].\n      o
      \ The packet MUST be covered by the home agent to mobile node\n         IPsec
      ESP authentication SA for integrity protection.\n   If the packet is dropped
      due to the above tests, the receiving node\n   MUST follow the processing rules
      as Section 9.2 of [RFC3775] defines.\n   For example, it MUST send a Binding
      Error message with the Status\n   field set to 2 (unrecognized MH Type value)
      if it does not support\n   the message type.\n   Upon receipt of a Home Agent
      Switch message, the mobile node MUST\n   stop using its current home agent for
      services and MUST delete its\n   home binding by sending a Binding Update message
      as described in\n   Section 11.7.1 of [RFC3775].  This acts as an acknowledgement
      of the\n   Home Agent Switch message.  Alternately, if the sender of the message\n
      \  is not the current home agent, sending a Binding Update message to\n   create
      a home binding will act as an acknowledgement of the Home\n   Agent Switch message.
      \ Retransmissions of Binding Update messages\n   MUST use the procedures described
      in Section 11.8 of [RFC3775].\n   If a Binding Refresh Advice mobility option
      is present, the mobile\n   node MAY delay the deletion of its home binding and
      continue to use\n   its current home agent until the calculated time period

      with the new home agent by whatever means required as\n   part of the mobile
      node/home agent bootstrapping protocol for the\n   home agent's mobility service

    might use the Home\n   Agent Switch message in its network.  However, the following\n
    \  requirements are placed on its usage:\n      o  The use of this message needs
    to take into account possible\n         signaling overhead, congestion, load from
    the mechanism itself,\n         and the resulting registration to another home
    agent.  A home\n         agent may provide service for thousands, if not millions,
    of\n         mobile nodes.  Careless application of the Home Agent Switch\n         message
    may cause the new home agent, or some other parts of\n         the network, to
    suffer.  As a result, it is REQUIRED that\n         applications of this message
    either employ a feedback loop\n         between resources of the new home agent
    and the sending of\n         additional Home Agent Switch messages, or apply a
    maximum rate\n         at which mobile nodes can be informed of the switch that
    is far\n         below the designated capacity of new registrations that the set\n
    \        of home agents can process.  If no other information is\n         available,
    this maximum rate should default to MAX-HA-SWITCH-\n         TRANSMIT-RATE.\n
    \     o  In general, switching the home agent of a mobile node should\n         only
    be done when absolutely necessary, since it might cause a\n         service disruption
    if the switch to a new home agent fails, the\n         new home agent is itself
    under an overload condition, or the\n         network connection of the new home
    agent is congested.\n         Similarly, the path characteristics via the new
    home agent may\n         be different, which may cause temporary difficulties
    for end-\n         to-end transport layer operation.\n      o  If this message
    is being used for load-balancing between a set\n         of home agents, they
    should all be configured with the same set\n         of prefixes so a home agent
    switch does not require a change of\n         the home address for a mobile node.
    \ That operation is NOT\n         RECOMMENDED and should be avoided.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   As with other messages in [RFC3775], the Home
    Agent Switch message\n   MUST use the home agent to mobile node ESP encryption
    SA for\n   confidentiality protection, and MUST use the home agent to mobile\n
    \  node ESP authentication SA for integrity protection.\n   The Home Agent Switch
    message MAY use the IPsec ESP SA in place for\n   Binding Updates and Acknowledgements,
    as specified in Section 5.1 of\n   [RFC3775], in order to reduce the number of
    configured security\n   associations.  This also gives the message authenticity
    protection.\n   Some operators may not want to reveal the list of home agents
    to on-\n   path listeners.  In such a case, the Home Agent Switch message should\n
    \  use the home agent to mobile node IPsec ESP encryption SA for\n   confidentiality
    protection.\n"
