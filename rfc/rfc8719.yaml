- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The work of the IETF is primarily conducted on working group\
    \ (WG)\n   mailing lists, while face-to-face WG meetings mainly provide a high-\n\
    \   bandwidth mechanism for working out unresolved issues.  The IETF\n   currently\
    \ strives to have a 1-1-1 meeting policy where the goal is to\n   distribute the\
    \ meetings equally between North America, Europe, and\n   Asia (see \"Meeting\
    \ Location Distribution\" (slides 14 and 15) of\n   [IETFMEET] for details). \
    \ These are the locations from which most of\n   the IETF participants have come\
    \ in the recent past.  This meeting\n   rotation is mainly aimed at distributing\
    \ the travel effort for the\n   existing IETF participants who physically attend\
    \ meetings and for\n   distributing the timezone difficulty for those who participate\n\
    \   remotely.  This policy has been neither defined precisely nor\n   documented\
    \ in an IETF consensus document until now.  This BCP RFC is\n   meant to serve\
    \ as a consensus-backed statement of this policy.\n"
- title: 2.  The 1-1-1-* Meeting Policy
  contents:
  - "2.  The 1-1-1-* Meeting Policy\n   Given that the majority of the current meeting\
    \ participants come from\n   North America, Europe, and Asia [CONT-DIST], the\
    \ IETF policy is that\n   the meetings should primarily be held in those regions.\
    \  That is, the\n   meeting policy (let's call this the \"1-1-1\" policy) is that\
    \ meetings\n   should rotate between North America, Europe, and Asia.  Note that\
    \ the\n   boundaries between those regions have been purposefully left\n   undefined.\
    \  It is important to note that such rotation and any\n   effects to distributing\
    \ travel pain should be considered from a long-\n   term perspective.  While a\
    \ potential cycle in an IETF year may be a\n   meeting in North America in March,\
    \ a meeting in Europe in July, and a\n   meeting in Asia on November, the 1-1-1\
    \ policy does not imply such a\n   cycle, as long as the distribution to these\
    \ regions over multiple\n   years is roughly equal.  There are many reasons why\
    \ meetings might be\n   distributed differently in a given year.  Meeting locations\
    \ in\n   subsequent years should seek to rebalance the distribution, if\n   possible.\n\
    \   While this meeting rotation caters to the current set of IETF\n   participants,\
    \ it is important to recognize that due to the dynamic\n   and evolving nature\
    \ of participation, there may be significant\n   changes to the regions that provide\
    \ a major share of participants in\n   the future.  Therefore, the 1-1-1-* meeting\
    \ policy is a slightly\n   modified version of the aforementioned 1-1-1 meeting\
    \ policy that\n   allows for additional flexibility in the form of an exploratory\n\
    \   meeting (denoted with an \"*\").  Exploratory meetings can be used to\n  \
    \ experiment with exceptional meetings without extensively impacting\n   the regular\
    \ meetings.  For example, these exploratory meetings can\n   include meetings\
    \ in other geographical regions, virtual meetings, and\n   additional meetings\
    \ beyond the three regular meetings in a calendar\n   year.\n   The timing and\
    \ frequency of future exploratory meetings will be based\n   on IETF consensus\
    \ as determined by the IETF chair.  Once a meeting\n   proposal is initiated,\
    \ the IESG will make a decision in consultation\n   with the IETF Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA) [RFC8711] to\n   ensure that the proposal can be realistically\
    \ implemented.  The final\n   decision will be communicated back to the community\
    \ to ensure that\n   there is adequate opportunity to comment.\n      |  NOTE:\
    \ There have not been a large number of meetings that would\n      |  qualify\
    \ as exploratory meetings under the 1-1-1 policy (with\n      |  IETF 95 in Buenos\
    \ Aires and IETF 47 in Adelaide being the\n      |  exceptional instances).  IETF\
    \ 27 (Amsterdam) and IETF 54\n      |  (Yokohama) were earlier examples of exploratory\
    \ meetings that\n      |  pioneered Europe and Asia as regular IETF destinations.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation of the Policy
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation of the Policy\n   IASA should understand the policy written\
    \ in this document to be the\n   aspiration of the IETF community.  Similarly,\
    \ any exploratory meeting\n   decisions will also be communicated to the IASA\
    \ to be implemented.\n   The actual selection of the venue would be performed\
    \ by the IASA\n   following the process described in [RFC8718].\n   As mentioned\
    \ in [RFC8718], the IASA will also be responsible for the\n   following:\n   *\
    \  assisting the community in the development of detailed meeting\n      criteria\
    \ that are feasible and implementable, and\n   *  providing sufficient transparency\
    \ in a timely manner concerning\n      planned meetings so that community feedback\
    \ can be collected and\n      acted upon.\n   Given that the geographical location\
    \ of the venue has a significant\n   influence on the venue selection process,\
    \ it needs to be considered\n   at the same level as the other Important Criteria\
    \ specified in\n   Section 3.2 of [RFC8718] (including potentially trading-off\
    \ the\n   geographical region to meet other criteria and notifying the\n   community\
    \ if the geographical region requirement cannot be met).\n"
- title: 4.  Procedure for Initiating Proposals for Exploratory Meetings
  contents:
  - "4.  Procedure for Initiating Proposals for Exploratory Meetings\n   Someone who\
    \ is interested in pursuing an exploratory venue proposes\n   it on the IETF discussion\
    \ list or on a future discussion list\n   expressly set up and announced for this\
    \ purpose.  The community gets\n   to comment on the venue and offer their opinions.\
    \  If the IETF chair\n   determines that there is community consensus to pursue\
    \ the venue\n   further, the venue will be put up for discussion on the venue-\n\
    \   selection mailing list <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/venue-\n   selection>.\
    \  This would allow the interested party(ies) to refine\n   their proposal based\
    \ on insightful feedback regarding the logistics\n   of the venue from those tasked\
    \ with evaluating it.  Once the venue\n   selection process takes place, the final\
    \ decision will be\n   communicated back to the community to ensure that there\
    \ is adequate\n   opportunity to comment.\n"
- title: 5.  Re-evaluation and Changes to This Policy
  contents:
  - "5.  Re-evaluation and Changes to This Policy\n   Given the dynamic nature of\
    \ participant distribution in the IETF, it\n   is expected that this policy will\
    \ need to be periodically evaluated\n   and revised to ensure that the stated\
    \ goals continue to be met.  The\n   criteria that are to be met need to be agreed\
    \ upon by the community\n   prior to initiating a revision of this document (e.g.,\
    \ try to mirror\n   draft author distribution over the preceding five years).\n"
