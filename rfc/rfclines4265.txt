Abstract This document describes Textual Conventions used for managing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and IETF VPN related MIBs.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
VPN TC STD MIB 3.1.
The VPN TC STD MIB defines a Textual Convention for the Global VPN Identifier, or VPN ID, as specified in [RFC2685].
The purpose of a VPN ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.
It MUST be 7 octets in length, and SHOULD be comprised of a 3 octet Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) that uniquely identifies the VPN Authority, followed by a 4 octet value assigned by the VPN Authority that uniquely identifies the VPN within the context of the OUI.

This TC MIB is a product of the PPVPN http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ppvpn charter.html and subsequently the L3VPN http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/l3vpn charter.html working groups.
Comments and discussion should be directed to l3vpn@ietf.org" DESCRIPTION "
This MIB contains TCs for VPNs.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4265;  see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
TEXTUAL CONVENTION STATUS current DESCRIPTION
"The purpose of a VPN ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.
The Global VPN Identifier format is: 3 octet VPN Authority, Organizationally Unique Identifier followed by 4 octet VPN index identifying VPN according to OUI" REFERENCE "Fox, B. and Gleeson, B., 'Virtual Private Networks Identifier', RFC 2685, September 1999."
SYNTAX    OCTET STRING (SIZE (7))
"This textual convention is an extension of the VPNId textual convention that defines a non zero length OCTET STRING to identify a physical entity.
This extension permits the additional value of a zero length OCTET STRING.
The semantics of the value zero length OCTET STRING are object specific and must therefore be defined as part of the description of any object that uses this syntax.
Examples of usage of this extension are situations where none or all VPN IDs need to be referenced."
OCTET STRING (SIZE (0   7))
This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions that may be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
Therefore, this document has no impact on the security of the Internet.
IANA Considerations for VPN TC STD MIB
The IANA has assigned { mib 2 129 } to the VPN TC STD MIB module specified in this document.
