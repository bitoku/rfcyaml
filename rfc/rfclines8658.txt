Abstract IPv4 over IPv6 transition mechanisms provide IPv4 connectivity services over IPv6 native networks during the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence period.
DHCPv6 options have been defined to configure clients for Lightweight 4over6, Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP E), Mapping of Address and Port
using Translation (MAP T) unicast softwire mechanisms, and multicast softwires.
However, in many networks, configuration information is stored in an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, which utilizes the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol to provide centralized management for users.
When a new transition mechanism is developed, new RADIUS attributes need to be defined correspondingly.
This document defines new RADIUS attributes to carry softwire configuration parameters based on Address plus Port from a AAA server to a Broadband Network Gateway.
Both unicast and multicast attributes are covered.
Introduction Providers have started deploying and transitioning to IPv6.
Several IPv4 service continuity mechanisms based on Address plus Port (A P)
[RFC6346] have been proposed for providing unicast IPv4 over  IPv6 only infrastructure, such as Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP E)
[RFC7597], Mapping of Address and Port
using Translation (MAP T) [RFC7599], and Lightweight 4over6
Also, [RFC8114] specifies a generic solution for the delivery of IPv4 multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.
For each of these mechanisms, DHCPv6 options have been specified for client configuration.
In many networks, user configuration information is stored in an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server.
AAA servers generally communicate using the Remote Authentication Dial
In a fixed broadband network, a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) acts as the access gateway for users.
That is, the BNG acts as both a AAA client to the AAA server and a DHCPv6 server for DHCPv6 messages sent by clients.
Throughout this document, the term "BNG" describes a device implementing both the AAA client and DHCPv6 server functions.
Since IPv4 in IPv6 softwire configuration information is stored in a AAA server and user configuration information is mainly transmitted through DHCPv6 between the BNGs and Customer Premises Equipment (CEs, a.k.a., CPE), new RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the information from the AAA servers to BNGs so that they can be provided to CEs using the existing DHCPv6 options.

The contents of the attributes defined in this document have a 1:1 mapping into the fields of the various DHCPv6 options in [RFC7598], [RFC8026], and [RFC8115].
Table 1 shows how the DHCPv6 options map to the corresponding RADIUS attribute.
Mapping between DHCPv6 Options and RADIUS Attributes A RADIUS attribute for Dual Stack Lite [RFC6333] is defined in [RFC6519].
This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in place between the RADIUS client and server.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The reader should be familiar with the concepts and terms defined in [RFC7596], [RFC7597], [RFC7599], and [RFC8026].
The terms "multicast Basic Bridging BroadBand" element (mB4) and "multicast Address Family Transition Router" element (mAFTR) are defined in [RFC8114].
(S46) is used throughout to denote any of the IPv4 in IPv6 softwire mechanisms listed above.
Additionally, the following abbreviations are used within the document:
Lightweight Address Family Transition Router MAP E:
Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation MAP T:
Mapping of Address and Port
This section defines the following attributes: 1.
This attribute carries the configuration information for MAP E, MAP T, and Lightweight 4over6.
The configuration information for each Softwire46 mechanism is carried in the corresponding Softwire46 attributes.
Different attributes are required for each Softwire46 mechanism.
Depending on the deployment scenario, a client may support several different Softwire46 mechanisms.
Therefore, a client may request configuration for more than one Softwire46 mechanism at a time.
The Softwire46 Priority Attribute contains information allowing the client to prioritize which mechanism to use, corresponding to OPTION S46 PRIORITY defined in [RFC8026].
This attribute conveys the IPv6 prefixes to be used in [RFC8114] to synthesize IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.
The BNG uses the IPv6 prefixes returned in the RADIUS Softwire46 Multicast Attribute to populate the DHCPv6 PREFIX64 Option [RFC8115].
All of these attributes are allocated from the RADIUS "Extended Type" code space per [RFC6929].
All of these attribute designs follow [RFC6158] and [RFC6929].
This document adheres to the guidance in [RFC8044] for defining new RADIUS attributes.

A Sample Configuration Process with RADIUS Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS and DHCPv6 protocols interwork to provide CE with softwire configuration information.
Interaction between DHCPv6 and AAA Server with RADIUS Authentication 1.
The CE creates a DHCPv6 Solicit message.
For unicast softwire configuration, the message includes an OPTION REQUEST OPTION (6) with the Softwire46 Container option code(s) as defined in [RFC7598].
S46 CONT MAPE (94) should be included for MAP  E, OPTION S46 CONT MAPT (95) for MAP T, and OPTION S46 CONT LW (96) for Lightweight 4over6.
For multicast configuration, the option number for OPTION V6 PREFIX64 (113) is included in the client's Option Request Option (ORO).
The message is sent to the BNG.
On receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message, the BNG constructs a RADIUS Access Request message containing a User Name Attribute (1) (containing either a CE Media Access Control (MAC) address, interface id, or both) and a User Password Attribute (2) (with a preconfigured shared password between the CE and AAA server as defined in [RFC2865]).
The Softwire46 Configuration Attribute and/or Softwire46
Multicast Attribute are also included (as requested by the client).
The resulting message is sent to the AAA server.
The AAA server authenticates the request.
If this is successful, and a suitable configuration is available, an Access Accept message is sent to the BNG containing the requested Softwire46 Configuration Attribute or Softwire46
It is the responsibility of the AAA server to ensure the consistency of the provided configuration.
The BNG maps the received softwire configuration into the corresponding fields in the DHCPv6 softwire configuration option(s).
These are included in the DHCPv6 Advertise message, which is sent to the CE.
The CE sends a DHCPv6 Request message.
In the ORO, the option codes of any of the required softwire options that were received in the DHCPv6 Advertise message are included.
The BNG sends a DHCPv6 Reply message to the client containing the softwire container option(s) enumerated in the ORO.
The authorization operation could be done independently after the authentication process.
In this case, steps 1 5 are completed as above, then the following steps are performed: 6a.
When the BNG receives the DHCPv6 Request, it constructs a RADIUS Access Request message, which contains a Service Type Attribute (6) with the value "Authorize Only" (17), the corresponding Softwire46 Configuration Attribute, and a State Attribute obtained from the previous authentication process according to [RFC5080].
The resulting message is sent to the AAA server.
The AAA server checks the authorization request.
If it is approved, an Access Accept message is returned to the BNG with the corresponding Softwire46 Configuration Attribute.
The BNG sends a Reply message to the client containing the softwire container options enumerated in the ORO.
In addition to the above, the following points need to be considered:
In the configuration message flows described above, the Message  Authenticator (type 80) [RFC2869] should be used to protect both Access Request and Access Accept messages.
If the BNG does not receive the corresponding Softwire46
Configuration Attribute in the Access Accept message
, it may fall back to creating the DHCPv6 softwire configuration options using the preconfigured Softwire46 configuration if this is present.
If the BNG receives an Access Reject from the AAA server, then the Softwire46 configuration must not be supplied to the client.
As specified in Section 18.2.5 of [RFC8415] ("Creation and Transmission of Rebind Messages") if the DHCPv6 server to which the DHCPv6 Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded by time T2, the CE (DHCPv6 client) should enter the Rebind state and attempt to contact any available server.
In this situation, a secondary BNG receiving the DHCPv6 message must initiate a new Access Request message towards the AAA server.
The secondary BNG includes the Softwire46 Configuration Attribute in this Access  Request message.
For Lightweight 4over6, the CE's binding state needs to be synchronized between the clients and the Lightweight AFTR (
This can be achieved in two ways: static preconfiguration of the bindings on both the AAA server and lwAFTR or on demand, whereby the AAA server updates the lwAFTR with the CE's binding state as it is created or deleted.
In some deployments, the DHCP server may use the Accounting Request to report the softwire configuration returned to a requesting host to a AAA server.
It is the responsibility of the DHCP server to ensure the consistency of the configuration provided to the requesting hosts.
Reported data to a AAA server may be required for various operational purposes (e.g., regulatory).
A configuration change (e.g., BR address) may result in an exchange of CoA Requests between the BNG and the AAA server, as shown in Figure 3.
Concretely, when the BNG receives a CoA Request message containing Softwire46 attributes, it sends a DHCPv6 Reconfigure message to the appropriate CE to inform that CE that an updated configuration is available.
Upon receipt of such a message, the CE sends a DHCPv6 Renew or Information Request in order to receive the updated Softwire46 configuration.
In deployments where the BNG embeds a DHCPv6 relay, CoA Requests can be used following the procedure specified in [RFC6977].

Security Considerations Section 9 of [RFC7596] discusses security issues related to Lightweight 4over6; Section 10 of [RFC7597] discusses security issues related to MAP E; Section 13 of [RFC7599] discusses security issues related to MAP T; and Section 9 of [RFC8114] discusses security issues related to the delivery of IPv4 multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.
This document does not introduce any security issues inherently different from those already identified in Section 8 of [RFC2865] and Section 6 of [RFC5176] for CoA messages.
Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol discussed in Section 7 of [RFC2607] and Section 7 of [RFC2869] apply to this specification.
These well established properties of the RADIUS protocol place some limitations on how it can safely be used, since there is some inherent requirement to trust the counterparty to not misbehave.
Accordingly, this document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in place between the RADIUS client and server, with communication optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC6614].
The use of IPsec [RFC4301] for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in [RFC3162].
Security considerations for interactions between a Softwire46 CE and the BNG are discussed in Section 9 of [RFC7598] (DHCPv6 options for the configuration of Softwire46 address and port mapped clients), Section 3 of [RFC8026] (a DHCPv6 based Softwire46 prioritization mechanism), and Section 5 of [RFC8115]
(DHCPv6 options for configuration of IPv4 embedded IPv6 prefixes).
IANA Considerations IANA has made new code point assignments for RADIUS attributes as described in the following subsections.
The assignments should use the RADIUS registry available at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
New RADIUS Attributes IANA has assigned the attribute types defined in this document from the RADIUS namespace as described in Section 2 (IANA Considerations) of [RFC3575], in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC8126].
IANA has registered three new RADIUS attributes from the "Short Extended Space" section of [RFC6929].
The attributes are the Softwire46 Configuration Attribute, Softwire46 Priority Attribute, and Softwire46
Configuration and Multicast Attributes IANA has created a new registry called "RADIUS Softwire46 Configuration and Multicast Attributes".
All attributes in this registry have one or more parent RADIUS attributes in nesting (refer to [RFC6929]).
The registration procedure for this registry is Standards Action as defined in [RFC8126].
Softwire46 Mechanisms and Their Identifying Option Codes
The Softwire46 Priority Attribute conveys an ordered list of option codes assigned to Softwire46 mechanisms, for which IANA has created and will maintain a new registry titled "Option Codes Permitted in the Softwire46 Priority Attribute".
Table 6 shows the initial version of allowed option codes and the Softwire46 mechanisms that they represent.
The option code for DS  Lite is derived from the IANA allocated RADIUS Attribute Type value for DS Lite [RFC6519].
The option codes for MAP E, MAP T, and Lightweight 4over6 are the TLV Type values for the MAP E, MAP T, and Lightweight 4over6 attributes defined in Section 3.1.1.
Table 6: Option Codes to S46 Mechanisms Additional option codes may be added to this list in the future using the IETF Review process described in Section 4.8 of [RFC8126].
