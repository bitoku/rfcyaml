  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo defines how the 6bone uses the 3FFE::/16 IPv6 address\n\
    \   prefix, allocated in RFC 2471 [6BONE-TLA], to create pseudo Top-Level\n  \
    \ Aggregation Identifiers (pTLA) and pseudo Next-Level Aggregation\n   Identifiers\
    \ (pNLA).\n   The guiding specifications for IPv6 addressing relating to the 6bone\n\
    \   prefix, and the pTLA and pNLA formats, are \"IP Version 6 Addressing\n   Architecture\"\
    \  [ADDRARCH], and \"An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast\n   Address Format\"\
    \ [AGGR].\n   The purpose of creating pseudo TLA and NLA formats for the 6bone\
    \ is\n   to provide a prototype of the actual TLA and NLA formats as they\n  \
    \ might be used in production IPv6 networks. To do this economically,\n   using\
    \ only a minimum of real production IPv6 address space, a single\n   TLA, 3FFE::/16,\
    \ was reserved by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority) for testing\
    \ on the 6bone. Thus it was necessary to define\n   a pretend-to-be, or pseudo,\
    \ TLA and NLA structure to use under the\n   3FFE::/16 prefix.\n   Given the 48-bit\
    \ length of the IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast\n   Address external routing\
    \ prefix (that contains the TLA and NLA\n   identifiers), there is enough room\
    \ to extend the TLA ID to contain a\n   pTLA and shorten the NLA ID to become\
    \ a pNLA. This document specifies\n   this.\n   In early 1999, it was decided\
    \ to change the 6bone's pTLA format to\n   allow greater expansion of the testbed\
    \ network, thus accommodating\n   more than the original 256 pTLA-s. Thus there\
    \ are now two 6bone pTLA\n   and pNLA formats. This document specifies this.\n"

    \ format was intended to accommodate 256\n   pTLA-s, i.e., backbone networks carrying\
    \ IPv6 transit traffic.\n   The original TLA and NLA ID-s as specified in [AGGR]\

- title: 2.2 New 12-bit pTLA and 20-bit pNLA Format
  contents:
  - "2.2 New 12-bit pTLA and 20-bit pNLA Format\n   After it became clear that the\
    \ 6bone would become a useful testbed\n   for transition, in addition to its early\
    \ role as a testbed for\n   specifications and implementations, the 6bone community\
    \ decided to\n   expand the size of the pTLA ID.\n   Several important decisions\
    \ regarding this expansion of the pTLA\n   field are:\n   1. to leave the currently\
    \ allocated 8-bit pTLA-s in use until the\n      space was needed, thus relying\
    \ on a range value check to indicate\n      the new pTLA format,\n   2. to use\
    \ a modulo 4-bit sized pTLA ID to make reverse path entry\n      into the DNS\
    \ easier,\n   3. given 2. above, to keep the pTLA ID size as small as possible\n\
    \      to not restrict pNLA ID size.\n   Therefore, the first 12-bits of the NLA\
    \ ID space are assigned as the\n   pTLA that defines the top level of aggegation\
    \ (backbone) for the\n   6bone. This would eventually provide for 4096 6bone backbone\n\
    \   networks, or pTLA-s, and leaves a 20-bit pNLA ID for each pTLA to\n   assign\
    \ as needed.\n      |     16    |   12  |   20      |   16   |    64 bits    \
    \  |\n      +-+---------+-------+-----------+--------+-----------------+\n   \
    \   |  0x3FFE   | pTLA  |   pNLA    | SLA ID | Interface ID    |\n      +-+---------+-------+-----------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \   In prefix notation form the pTLA is 3FFE:nnn0::/28, where nnn is the\n   pTLA\
    \ assignment. However, as the existing 8-bit pTLA's are being left\n   in use\
    \ for the present, the nnn value starts at 0x800 for now, thus\n   yielding only\
    \ 2048 pTLA's in this new format.\n   The remaining NLA ID space can be used by\
    \ each pTLA for their\n   downward aggregated delegation:\n      |  n  |     \
    \ 20-n bits     |   16   |    64 bits      |\n      +-----+--------------------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \      |pNLA1|       Site         | SLA ID | Interface ID    |\n      +-----+--------------------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \            |  m  |    20-n-m    |   16   |    64 bits      |\n            +-----+--------------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \            |pNLA2|    Site      | SLA ID | Interface ID    |\n            +-----+--------------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \                  |  o  |20-n-m-o|   16   |    64 bits      |\n             \

    \ Site  | SLA ID | Interface ID    |\n                  +-----+--------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \   As with the original pTLA format, the pNLA delegation works in the\n   same\
    \ manner as specified in [AGGR]. pTLA's are required to assume\n   registry duties\
    \ for the pNLA's below them, pNLA1's for those below\n   them, etc.\n"
- title: 2.3 Example Format For pNLA's
  contents:
  - "2.3 Example Format For pNLA's\n   An example usage of the pNLA space is given\
    \ to demonstrate what is\n   reasonable and possible. It should not be assumed\
    \ that this implies\n   the pNLA space must be used this way. As the new pTLA\
    \ and pNLA format\n   is now the default, the example here assumes the 20-bit\
    \ pNLA format.\n   The following example provides for up to 255 intermediate transit\n\
    \   ISP's (called pNLA1 below). The pNLA1 value of zero is meant to\n   indicate\
    \ that there is no intermediate transit ISP between the\n   backbone pTLA network\
    \ and the end user site.\n      |<-----20-bit pNLA ID----->|\n      |        \
    \                  |\n      |  8  |       12 bits      |   16   |    64 bits \
    \     |\n      +-----+--------------------+--------+-----------------+\n     \
    \ |pNLA1|      Site  ID      | SLA ID | Interface ID    |\n      +-----+--------------------+--------+-----------------+\n\
    \   Intermediate transit networks (pNLA1's) would assign uniques Site\n   ID's\
    \ for eachend user site served.\n   As an example of this, assuming a backbone\
    \ pTLA of 0x800, no\n   intermediate transit ISP (thus a pNLA1 of 0x00) and a\
    \ sequential site\n   ID (with start at the right edge numbering) of 0x0001, the\
    \ routing\n   prefix for the first site would look like:\n            3FFE:8000:0001/48\n\
    \     6bone _|||| |||| ||||___site\n                 |||| |\n     b/b site____||||\
    \ |\n                    | |\n     transit________|_|\n   Another example of this\
    \ usage, assuming the same backbone pTLA1 of\n   0x800 and an intermediate transit\
    \ ISP under it (numbering from the\n   left edge) with an NLA1 of 0x80, and a\
    \ sequential site ID of 0x0001,\n   the routing prefix for the first site connected\
    \ would look like:\n            3FFE:0180:0001/48\n     6bone _|||| |||| ||||___site\n\
    \                 ||||\n     b/b site____||||\n                   ||\n     transit_______||\n\
    \   Note 1: the two sites numbered 0x001 in the above examples are really\n  \
    \ two different sites as their pNLA1 authority above them is different\n   (i.e.,\
    \ in the first case no transit exists thus the site is directly\n   connected\
    \ to the pTLA backbone ISP, and in the second case the site\n   is directly connected\
    \ to intermediate transit ISP 0x80).\n   Note 2: there would be nothing to prevent\
    \ an pNLA1 transit site from\n   further allocating pNLA's below, but that becomes\
    \ the policy of the\n   pTLA and pNLA's above them to work out.\n   Note 3: The\
    \ 6bone registry, which is a RIPE-style database for\n   documenting IPv6 sites\
    \ connected to the 6bone, has an \"inet6num\"\n   object to allow documentation\
    \ of all IPv6 addresses allocated.\n"
