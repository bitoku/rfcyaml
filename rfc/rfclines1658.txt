This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for the management of character stream devices.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
The Character MIB applies to ports that carry a character stream, whether physical or virtual, serial or parallel, synchronous or asynchronous.
The most common example of a character stream device is a hardware terminal port with an RS 232 interface.
Another common hardware example is a parallel printer port, say with a Centronics interface.
The concept also includes virtual terminal ports, such as a software connection point for a remote console.
The Character MIB is mandatory for all systems that offer character stream ports.
This includes, for example, terminal servers, general purpose time sharing hosts, and even such systems as a bridge with a (virtual) console port.
It may or may not include character ports that do not support network sessions, depending on the system's needs.
The Character MIB's central abstraction is a port.
Physical ports have a one to one correspondence with hardware ports.
Virtual ports are software entities analogous to physical ports, but with no hardware connector.
Each port supports one or more sessions.
A session represents a virtual connection that carries characters between the port and some partner.
Sessions typically operate over a stack of network protocols.
A typical session, for example, uses Telnet over TCP.
The MIB comprises one base object and two tables, detailed in the following sections.
The tables contain objects for ports and sessions.
The MIB intentionally contains no distinction between what is often called permanent and operational or volatile data bases.
For the purposes of this MIB, handling of such distinctions is implementation specific.
The Character MIB does not relate directly to the Interface MIB [1], since it is not intrinsically a network interface.
On the other hand, in most implementations where it is present, it will be above a physical sublayer interface, such as the RS 232 like [2] or Parallel printer like [3] MIBs.
Such physical interfaces typically are represented by a row in the interface table (ifTable), identified by a value of ifIndex.

"A unique value, greater than zero, for each character port in the managed system.
It is recommended that values are assigned contiguously starting from 1.
The value for each interface sub  layer must remain constant at least from one re  initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re initialization.
In a system where the character ports are attached to hardware represented by an ifIndex, it is conventional, but not required, to make the character port index equal to the corresponding ifIndex."

"A control to force the port into a clean, initial state, both hardware and software, disconnecting all the port's existing sessions.
In response to a get request or get next request, the agent always returns 'ready' as the value.
Setting the value to 'execute' causes a reset."

'off' indicates that the port is not allowed to pass characters or have any sessions. '
maintenance' indicates a maintenance mode, exclusive of normal operation, such as running a test. '
enabled' corresponds to ifAdminStatus 'up'. 'disabled' and 'off' correspond to ifAdminStatus 'down'.
'maintenance' corresponds to ifAdminStatus 'test'."
'up' indicates able to function normally.
'down' indicates inability to function for administrative or operational reasons. '
