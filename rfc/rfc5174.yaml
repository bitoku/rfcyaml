  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is the largest non-for\
    \ profit\n   professional association of broadcasters worldwide and was\n   established\
    \ in 1950.  The Union has more than 70 active members in 55\n   countries in Europe,\
    \ North Africa, and the Middle East, and more than\n   40 associate members in\
    \ 25 countries further afield.  The EBU\n   negotiates broadcasting rights for\
    \ major sport events, operates the\n   Eurovision and Euroradio networks, organizes\
    \ program exchanges and\n   co-productions, and provides other operational and\
    \ legal support.  It\n   provides technical advice to its members and favors the\
    \ adoption of\n   standardized solutions in broadcast systems from content ingest\
    \ to\n   end-user delivery.  EBU activities cover traditional broadcast and\n\
    \   new delivery medias, such as the Internet, for which a growing number\n  \
    \ of resources are being developed.\n   The EBU would like to assign unique, permanent,\
    \ location-independent\n   names based on URNs for some resources it produces\
    \ or manages.\n   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \    Email:          evain@ebu.ch\n   Declaration of structure:\n      URNs assigned\
    \ by the EBU will have the following hierarchical\n      structure based on the\
    \ organizational structure of the EBU\n      resources:\n                    \
    \     urn:ebu:{category}:{string}\n      where \"{category}\" is a US-ASCII string\
    \ that conforms to the\n      syntax of the <NID>, and \"{string}\" is a US-ASCII\
    \ string that\n      conforms to the syntax of the <NSS> [RFC2141].\n      The\
    \ individual URNs will be assigned by the EBU through the\n      development process\
    \ of EBU resources.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      More information\
    \ on the EBU and relevant technical activities can\n      be found at http://www.ebu.ch/metadata.\n\
    \   Identifier and namespace uniqueness considerations:\n      The EBU understands\
    \ the vital necessity for uniqueness and will\n      establish unique identifiers\
    \ and namespaces under the authority of\n      its metadata expert group under\
    \ the auspices of the EBU Production\n      Management Committee to prevent re-assignation\
    \ of existing\n      identifiers and namespaces.\n   Identifier and namespace\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) shall\
    \ ensure the\n      accessibility and persistence of all resources that are officially\n\
    \      assigned URNs by the organization, in particular upon suitable\n      delegation\
    \ at the level of \"{category}\"s, and persistence of\n      category assignment.\n\
    \   Process of identifier and namespace assignment:\n      The assignment of identifiers\
    \ and namespaces is fully controlled\n      and managed by the European Broadcasting\
    \ Union (EBU).\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      The owner will develop\
    \ and maintain \"URN catalogues\" that map all\n      assigned URNs to Uniform\
    \ Resource Locators (URLs) specifically to\n      enable Web-based resolution\
    \ of named resources.  In the future, an\n      interactive online resolution\
    \ system may be developed to automate\n      this process.\n      The owner will\
    \ authorize additional resolution services as\n      appropriate.\n   Rules for\
    \ Lexical Equivalence:\n      The \"{category}\" is case-insensitive.  Thus, the\
    \ portion of the\n      URN:\n                   urn:ebu:{category}:\n      is\
    \ case-insensitive for matches up to {category}.  The remainder\n      of the\
    \ identifier shall be considered case-sensitive; hence, URNs\n      are only lexically\
    \ equivalent if they are also lexically identical\n      in the remaining \"{string}\"\
    \ field.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      The owner will develop and maintain URN catalogues.\
    \  The presence\n      of a URN in a catalogue indicates that it is valid.  Validation\n\
    \      shall more particularly be done by a syntax grammar corresponding\n   \
    \   to each \"{category}\".\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The EBU develops and maintains metadata schemas\
    \ and classification\n   schemes, which are made publicly available from\n   http://www.ebu.ch/metadata\
    \ for integration or cross reference in\n   third party implementations, technical\
    \ specifications and standards.\n   Reference to the urn:ebu namespace shall be\
    \ a guarantee of open\n   access and quality.\n   Furthermore, the value of well-defined\
    \ namespaces is fully recognized\n   including for versioning purposes, which\
    \ will be facilitated through\n   the EBU maintenance of its own namespace dictated\
    \ by the following\n   rules.\n   URN assignment procedures:\n      The individual\
    \ URNs shall be assigned through the process of\n      development of EBU resources\
    \ by the European Broadcasting Union\n      (EBU).\n   URN resolution/delegation:\n\
    \      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the\n      process\
    \ of development of EBU resources by the European\n      Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\
    \   Type of resources to be identified:\n      Types of resources to be identified\
    \ include XML schema definition\n      files, classification schemes, and identification\
    \ systems.\n   Type of services to be supported:\n      Types of services supported\
    \ include controlled term lookup in\n      classification schemes and resolution\
    \ of IDs in identification\n      systems.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The EBU traditionally addresses the broadcasting\
    \ community, but its\n   resources are made available to all interested parties.\n\
    \   Communities involved in offering content over new IP-based delivery\n   medias\
    \ such as via the Internet and mobile communication networks, or\n   using IP\
    \ infrastructures and Service-Oriented Architectures are\n   welcome to use EBU\
    \ resources.  Metadata and content identifiers, for\n   which the EBU mainly needs\
    \ the urn:ebu namespace, play a key role in\n   content search and retrieval,\
    \ end-to-end from content commissioning\n   to user delivery.\n   Web services,\
    \ search engines, and the semantic web are among the core\n   technologies that\
    \ the EBU is now exploiting to access users in a\n   multimedia multi-platform\
    \ connected world.\n   Potential beneficiary developing communities include:\n\
    \      a) Implementers and users of EBU resources.\n         Resources that comply\
    \ with EBU specifications (including\n         schemas, instance documents that\
    \ comply with EBU schemas, and\n         the EBU default Classification Schemes)\
    \ may, by means of the\n         registered namespace, become exposed to the general\
    \ Internet\n         and gain from the interoperability benefits of the Internet\
    \ at\n         large.\n      b) Implementers of other specifications that incorporate\
    \ part or\n         all of available EBU resources.\n         URNs used to identify\
    \ EBU resources may be used to enable their\n         inclusion in, and enhancement\
    \ of, other specifications while\n         maintaining, to a certain degree, interoperability\
    \ with the EBU\n         (see a) above).\n      c) Implementers of other semantically\
    \ related specifications that\n         do not directly incorporate part or all\
    \ of EBU resources.\n         URNs used to identify EBU resources, such as identifiers\
    \ of\n         terms within default Classification Schemes, may enable\n     \
    \    interoperation with other semantically determined\n         specifications\
    \ (including present and future metadata/resource\n         description and ontology\
    \ specifications) of relevance to EBU\n         implementation communities (see\
    \ a) and b) above).\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The portion of the URN, urn:ebu:{category}:,\
    \ is case-insensitive for\n   matches up to {category}.\n   Otherwise, there are\
    \ no additional security considerations other than\n   those normally associated\
    \ with the use and resolution of URNs in\n   general.\n"
