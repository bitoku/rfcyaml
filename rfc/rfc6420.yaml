  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some unicast protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, allow a
    single\n   network to be viewed as multiple topologies [RFC4915] [RFC5120].\n
    \  Deploying multi-topology (MT) routing allows different paths through\n   the
    network to be selected to support different traffic or to offer\n   protection
    paths in the event of failures.\n   PIM [RFC4601] employs a technique known as
    Reverse Path Forwarding\n   (RPF) to construct forwarding trees between multicast
    sources and\n   receivers.  The procedure of RPF uses topology information provided\n
    \  by routing protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS.  Using the PIM MT-ID\n   Join
    Attribute specified in this document enables PIM to access the\n   multiple topologies
    created by the routing protocols and construct\n   multicast forwarding trees
    using separate network paths even when the\n   roots of the trees are the same.\n
    \  This capability would allow for an improvement to the resilience of\n   multicast
    applications.  For instance, a multicast stream can be\n   duplicated and transported
    using two source trees, (S1, G1) and (S1,\n   G2), simultaneously.  By using MT-capable
    unicast routing protocols\n   and procedures described in this document, it is
    possible to\n   construct two source trees for (S1, G1) and (S1, G2) in such a
    way\n   that they do not share any transit network segment.  As a result, a\n
    \  single network failure will not cause any loss to the stream.\n   This document
    introduces a new type of PIM Join Attribute [RFC5384],\n   named \"MT-ID Join
    Attribute\".  It is used to encode the numerical\n   identity of the topology
    PIM uses when performing RPF for the\n   forwarding tree that is being joined.
    \ This document also specifies\n   procedures and rules to process the attribute
    and resolve conflicts\n   arising from mismatches in capabilities to support the
    attribute or\n   the value of the attribute.\n   This document does not introduce
    any change to the RPF check\n   procedure used to verify the incoming interface
    when a packet is\n   forwarded as defined in [RFC4601].  For example, to use the\n
    \  capability described by this document, an application can choose to\n   use
    group addresses, and/or source addresses, to identify a unique\n   multicast stream.
    \ It might further need to perform the functions of\n   splitting and merging.
    \ However, the detailed processing is beyond\n   the scope of the document.\n
    \  In the rest of the document, the MT-ID Join Attribute will be\n   referred
    to as \"MT-ID\".\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The following acronyms are frequently used in the document.\n
    \  -  RPF: RPF stands for \"Reverse Path Forwarding\".  A PIM router\n      performs
    RPF for two purposes.  When building a forwarding tree, a\n      PIM router identifies
    an interface (the RPF interface) and an\n      upstream PIM neighbor (the RPF
    neighbor) to which to send PIM\n      Joins.  Upon receiving a data packet, a
    PIM router verifies if the\n      packet arrives from the expected incoming interface
    (aka RPF\n      check) before deciding whether or not to replicate the packets.\n
    \  -  RPF Topology: An RPF topology is a collection of routes that a PIM\n      router
    uses for RPF.  One or more RPF topologies may be created on\n      a PIM router.\n
    \  -  MT: MT stands for \"Multi-Topology\" in this document.  Sometimes it\n      is
    also referred to as \"multi-topology routing\".  In the context\n      of PIM,
    MT refers to the capability of building and maintaining\n      multiple RPF topologies.\n
    \  -  PIM MT-ID: An MT-ID is a numerical identifier associated with an\n      RPF
    topology.\n   -  PIM MT-ID Join Attribute: This is a new type of Join Attribute\n
    \     that is introduced by this document in order to specify RPF\n      topology
    in the PIM Join messages.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Functional Overview\n   PIM relies on routes learned from routing protocols
    for the purpose\n   of RPF.  These routes form one or more topologies.  This section\n
    \  describes the function of multi-topology routing for PIM and its\n   applicability.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  PIM RPF Topology\n   PIM RPF topology is a collection of routes used
      by PIM to perform the\n   RPF operation when building shared or source trees.
      \ The routes in\n   the topology may be contributed by different protocols.
      \ In the rest\n   of the document, PIM RPF topology may be simply referred to
      as\n   \"topology\" when there is no ambiguity.\n   In a multi-topology environment,
      multiple RPF topologies can be\n   created in the same network.  A particular
      source may be reachable in\n   only one of the topologies or in several of them
      via different paths.\n   To help explain the relationship between an MT-capable
      unicast\n   routing protocol and MT-capable RPF topologies, consider the\n   following
      example described by Figure 1.\n                              +++ A +++ B +++\n
      \                            +               +\n                      S -- R1
      \                R2 -- receivers\n                             *               *\n
      \                             *** C *** D ***\n                 Figure 1. A
      simple topology for multicast\n   -  The traffic source is S.  S is announced
      by R1 using Multiprotocol\n      BGP (MBGP) to every router.  This route is
      installed in every\n      topology.\n   -  Two topologies are created in the
      unicast IGP, let us call them\n      OSPF 1000 and OSPF 2000.  OSPF 1000 includes
      A, B, and interfaces\n      in R1 and R2 that are configured to be part of OSPF
      1000.  OSPF\n      2000 includes C, D, and interfaces on R1 and R2 that are\n
      \     configured to be part of OSPF 2000.\n   -  Two PIM RPF topologies are
      created, let us call them PIM 500 and\n      PIM 600.\n   PIM 500 comprises
      the following routes: S announced by MBGP and those\n   learned via OSPF 1000.\n
      \  PIM 600 comprises the following routes: S announced by MBGP and those\n   learned
      via OSPF 2000\n   The above example illustrates that the naming spaces of MT-ID
      are not\n   required to be the same between PIM and IGPs.  Furthermore, a unicast\n
      \  IGP topology and the PIM RPF topology to which the IGP topology\n   contributes
      routes are not required to have the same set of routes.\n   In the above example,
      the prefix covering S does not exist in either\n   OSPF 1000 or OSPF 2000, but
      since it exists in PIM 500 and PIM 600,\n   R2 is able to join to it via either
      path.\n   There are two methods to select the RPF topology for a particular\n
      \  multicast distribution tree, via configuration or via PIM.\n   When it is
      done via configuration, a network administrator configures\n   a policy that
      maps a group range to a topology and/or maps a source\n   prefix range to a
      topology.  Using the same example, the policy can\n   say that to build a forwarding
      tree for G1 only routes in PIM 500 are\n   to be used, and to build a forward
      tree for G2 only routes in PIM 600\n   are used.  The result is that packets
      for (S, G1) will follow the\n   path of S-R1-A-B-R2 and packets for (S, G2)
      will follow the path of\n   S-R1-C-D-R2.\n   An alternative to static configuration
      is to include the RPF topology\n   information as a new PIM Join Attribute in
      the PIM Join packets sent\n   by downstream routers.\n   Both methods can be
      used at the same time.  The details of the first\n   method are implementation
      specific and are not discussed in this\n   document.  The specification to support
      the second method is included\n   in this document.\n"
    title: 3.1.  PIM RPF Topology
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  PIM MT-ID\n   For each PIM RPF topology created, a unique numerical ID
      is assigned\n   per PIM domain.  This ID is called the PIM MT-ID.  The PIM MT-ID
      has\n   the following properties.\n   -  It is the path identifier that is used
      by the PIM control plane,\n      but it does not function in the forwarding
      state for a specific\n      topology.  The differentiation for topologies on
      the forwarding\n      plane is made by different group addresses and/or source
      addresses\n      instead.\n   -  As shown earlier, this value is not required
      to be the same as the\n      MT-ID used by the unicast routing protocols that
      contribute routes\n      to the topology.  In practice, when only one unicast
      routing\n      protocol (such as OSPF or IS-IS) is used, the PIM MT-ID is\n
      \     RECOMMENDED to be assigned using the same value as the IGP\n      topology
      identifier.  Using the same example presented earlier, if\n      every route
      in PIM 500 is contributed by OSPF 1000, it is\n      RECOMMENDED to name this
      RPF topology as PIM 1000 instead of PIM\n      500.  This is for the purpose
      of reducing management overhead and\n      simplifying troubleshooting.\n   -
      \ This value MUST be unique and consistent within the network for\n      the
      same topology.  For example, PIM 500 MUST refer to the same\n      topology
      on routers R1, C, D, and R2.  For actual deployment, one\n      should have
      a means to detect inconsistency of the PIM MT-ID\n      configuration, but the
      detail of such mechanism is beyond the\n      scope of this document.\n   -
      \ 0 is reserved as the default, and it MUST NOT be included in the\n      Join
      Attribute encoding.\n   -  How to assign a PIM MT-ID to a topology is decided
      by the network\n      administrator and is outside the scope of this document.\n"

      \  Specific Mode/Bidirectional).  It is not used in any other PIM\n   packets.
      \ As such, it can only be used to build shared or source\n   trees for PIM SM/SSM
      and PIM-Bidir downstream.\n   When this attribute is used in combination with

          \     Join packets altogether if it sees a conflict in PIM MT-ID\n      attributes.
          \ This action may also be taken by an upstream router\n      that has locally
          configured topology selection policy, as an\n      exception to the rules
          described above.\n   -  If an upstream router receives a different PIM MT-ID
          attribute in\n      an Assert packet, it MUST use the tiebreaker rules as
          specified in\n      [RFC4601] to determine an Assert winner.  PIM MT-ID
          is not\n      considered in deciding a winner from Assert process.\n"

          downstream router sees different PIM MT-ID attributes from\n      PIM Join
          packets, it MUST follow the specification of [RFC4601] as\n      if the
          attribute did not exist.  For example, the router\n      suppresses its
          own Join packet if a Join for the same (S,G) is\n      seen.\n      The
          router MUST NOT use the rules specified in [RFC5384] to select\n      a
          PIM MT-ID from Join packets sent by other downstream routers.\n   -  If
          a downstream router sees its preferred upstream router loses in\n      the
          Assert process, and the Assert winner uses a different PIM\n      MT-ID,
          the downstream router SHOULD still choose the Assert winner\n      as the
          RPF neighbour, but it MUST NOT encode PIM MT-ID when\n      sending Join
          packets to it.\n"
