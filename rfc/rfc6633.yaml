  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defined the ICMP Source
    Quench\n   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant as a mechanism for\n   congestion
    control.  ICMP Source Quench has been known to be an\n   ineffective (and unfair)
    antidote for congestion, and generation of\n   ICMP Source Quench messages by
    routers has been formally deprecated\n   by [RFC1812] since 1995.  However, reaction
    to ICMP Source Quench\n   messages in transport protocols has never been formally
    deprecated.\n   This document formally deprecates reaction to ICMP Source Quench\n
    \  messages by transport protocols such as TCP [RFC0793], formally\n   updating
    [RFC0792], [RFC1122], and [RFC1812].  Additionally, it\n   provides a recommendation
    against the implementation of [RFC1016].\n   The rationale for these specification
    updates is as follows:\n   o  Processing of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers
    has been\n      deprecated for nearly 17 years [RFC1812].\n   o  Virtually all
    popular host implementations have removed support\n      for ICMP Source Quench
    messages since (at least) 2005 [RFC5927].\n   o  Widespread deployment of ICMP
    filtering makes it impossible to\n      rely on ICMP Source Quench messages for
    congestion control.\n   o  The IETF has moved away from ICMP Source Quench messages
    for\n      congestion control (e.g., note the development of Explicit\n      Congestion
    Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] and the fact that ICMPv6\n      [RFC4443] does not
    even specify a Source Quench message).\n         ICMP Source Quench messages are
    not normally seen in the\n         deployed Internet and were considered rare
    at least as far back\n         as 1994 [Floyd1994].\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to
    be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  ICMP Source Quench Messages\n   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defined
    the ICMP Source Quench\n   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant to provide
    a mechanism for\n   congestion control.  The Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122] stated
    in\n   Section 4.2.3.9 that hosts MUST react to ICMP Source Quench messages\n
    \  by slowing transmission on the connection, and further added that the\n   RECOMMENDED
    procedure was to put the corresponding connection in the\n   slow-start phase
    of TCP's congestion control algorithm [RFC5681].\n   [RFC1812] noted that research
    suggested that ICMP Source Quench was\n   an ineffective (and unfair) antidote
    for congestion, and formally\n   deprecated the generation of ICMP Source Quench
    messages by routers,\n   stating that routers SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench
    messages in\n   response to congestion.\n   [RFC5927] discussed the use of ICMP
    Source Quench messages for\n   performing \"blind throughput-reduction\" attacks,
    and noted that most\n   TCP implementations silently ignore ICMP Source Quench
    messages.\n   We note that TCP implements its own congestion control mechanisms\n
    \  [RFC5681] [RFC3168], which do not depend on ICMP Source Quench\n   messages.\n
    \     It is interesting to note that ICMPv6 [RFC4443] does not specify a\n      Source
    Quench message.\n"

  - "3.  Updating RFC 1122\n   This document hereby updates Section 3.2.2.3 of [RFC1122]
    as follows:\n      A host MUST NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages.\n      If
    a Source Quench message is received, the IP layer MAY silently\n      discard
    it.\n   Section 4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122] is updated as follows:\n      TCP MUST silently
    discard any received ICMP Source Quench\n      messages.\n   The consensus of
    the TSV WG was that there are no valid reasons for a\n   host to generate or react
    to an ICMP Source Quench message in the\n   current Internet.  The recommendation
    that a sender \"MUST NOT\" send\n   an ICMP Source Quench message is because there
    is no known valid\n   reason for a host to generate this message.  The only known
    impact of\n   a sender ignoring this requirement is that it may necessarily consume\n
    \  network and endpoint resources.  Discarding ICMP Source Quench\n   messages
    at the Internet layer (rather than at the transport layer)\n   is a performance
    optimization that is permitted by this update.\n"

  - "4.  Updating RFC 1812\n   This document hereby updates Section 4.3.3.3 of [RFC1812]
    as follows:\n      A router MUST ignore any ICMP Source Quench messages it receives.\n
    \  The consensus of the TSV WG was that there are no valid reasons for a\n   router
    to react to ICMP Source Quench messages in the current\n   Internet.\n"
  title: 4.  Updating RFC 1812
- contents:
  - "5.  Clarification for UDP, SCTP, and DCCP\n   UDP [RFC0768] did not explicitly
    specify support for ICMP Source\n   Quench messages.  Hereby, we clarify that
    UDP endpoints MUST silently\n   discard received ICMP Source Quench messages.\n
    \  It is understood that SCTP [RFC4960] and DCCP [RFC4340] did not\n   specify
    support for processing received ICMP Source Quench messages.\n   Hereby, we clarify
    that DCCP and SCTP endpoints MUST silently discard\n   received ICMP Source Quench
    messages.\n"
  title: 5.  Clarification for UDP, SCTP, and DCCP
- contents:
  - "6.  General Advice to Transport Protocols\n   If a Source Quench message is received
    by any other transport-\n   protocol instance, it MUST be silently ignored.\n
    \  The TSV WG is not aware of any mechanism that requires processing of\n   these
    messages and therefore expects other transports to follow the\n   recommendations
    in Section 3.  Note that since generation of ICMP\n   Source Quench messages has
    been deprecated for many years, and since\n   this document additionally deprecates
    reaction to ICMP Source Quench\n   messages by IETF-specified transports, future
    applications cannot\n   expect to receive these messages.\n"
  title: 6.  General Advice to Transport Protocols
- contents:
  - "7.  Recommendation Regarding RFC 1016\n   [RFC1016] describes an experimental
    approach to the handling of ICMP\n   Source Quench messages in hosts that was
    considered in 1987.  Even\n   though RFC 1016 has never been on the IETF Standards
    Track, for\n   clarity and avoidance of doubt we note that the approach described
    in\n   [RFC1016] MUST NOT be implemented.\n"
  title: 7.  Recommendation Regarding RFC 1016
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   ICMP Source Quench messages could be leveraged
    for performing blind\n   throughput-reduction attacks against TCP and similar
    protocols.  This\n   attack vector, along with possible countermeasures, has been\n
    \  discussed in great detail in [RFC5927] and [CPNI-TCP].  Silently\n   ignoring
    ICMP Source Quench messages, as specified in this document,\n   eliminates the
    aforementioned attack vector.\n   For current TCP implementations, receipt of
    an ICMP Source Quench\n   message should not result in security issues because,
    as noted in\n   [RFC5927] and [CPNI-TCP], virtually all current versions of popular\n
    \  TCP implementations already silently ignore ICMP Source Quench\n   messages.
    \ This is also the case for SCTP and DCCP implementations.\n   Hosts, security
    gateways, and firewalls MUST silently discard\n   received ICMP Source Quench
    packets and SHOULD log such drops as a\n   security fault with at least minimal
    details (IP Source Address, IP\n   Destination Address, ICMP message type, and
    date/time the packet was\n   seen).\n      We note that security devices such
    as the Snort Network Intrusion\n      Detection System (NIDS) have logged ICMP
    Source Quench messages as\n      such for more than ten years [Anderson2002].\n"
