  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4646] provides for a Language Subtag Registry and describes\
    \ its\n   format.  This memo defines the initial contents of the IANA Language\n\
    \   Subtag Registry, using the criteria described in Section 2.\n   The Language\
    \ Subtag Registry is formatted in a modified record-jar\n   text format, as described\
    \ in [record-jar].  The specific format of\n   the registry, and the definition\
    \ and intended purpose of each of the\n   fields, are described in [RFC4646].\n\
    \   The registry is expected to change over time, as new subtags are\n   registered\
    \ and existing subtags are modified or deprecated.  The\n   process of updating\
    \ the registry is described in Section 3 of\n   [RFC4646].  This memo does not\
    \ define the permanent contents of the\n   registry and should not be represented\
    \ as doing so.\n   Many of the subtags defined in this registry are based on code\n\
    \   elements defined in [ISO639-1], [ISO639-2], [ISO15924], [ISO3166-1],\n   and\
    \ [UN_M.49].  This registry is not a mirror of the code lists\n   defined by these\
    \ standards and should not be used as one.\n"
- title: 2.  Initialization of the Registry
  contents:
  - "2.  Initialization of the Registry\n   Section 3.7 of [RFC4646] requires that\
    \ the LTRU working group create\n   an initial version of the Language Subtag\
    \ Registry and populate it\n   with the initial set of subtags.  This involves\
    \ converting the\n   entries from the existing IANA language tag registry defined\
    \ by\n   [RFC3066] to the new format, as well as defining valid subtags from\n\
    \   various source standards.  This section describes the process that\n   was\
    \ used to create the initial registry entries.\n   The initial set of records\
    \ was based on the following standards:\n   [ISO639-1], [ISO639-2], [ISO15924],\
    \ and [ISO3166-1].  The following\n   criteria were used to select and format\
    \ the records of the subtags\n   included in the initial Language Subtag Registry\
    \ (hereafter \"ILSR\"):\n      1.  For each source standard, the date of the standard\
    \ referenced\n          in [RFC1766] was selected as the starting date.  Code\
    \ elements\n          that were valid on that date in the selected standard were\n\
    \          added to the ILSR.  Code elements that were previously\n          assigned,\
    \ but that were vacated or withdrawn before that date,\n          were not added\
    \ to the ILSR.\n      2.  For each successive change to the standard, any additional\n\
    \          assignments up to the date of the adoption of [RFC4646] were\n    \
    \      added to the ILSR.  Values that have been withdrawn are marked\n      \
    \    as deprecated, but not removed.  Changes in meaning or\n          assignment\
    \ of a subtag were permitted during this process (for\n          example, the\
    \ [ISO3166-1] code element 'CS' was originally\n          assigned to Czechoslovakia\
    \ and is now assigned to Serbia and\n          Montenegro).\n   Code elements\
    \ from [UN_M.49] were also included in the ILSR using the\n   criteria above,\
    \ with the following additional rules:\n      3.  UN numeric code elements assigned\
    \ to \"macro-geographical\n          (continental)\" regions as of the date of\
    \ adoption of [RFC4646]\n          were added to the ILSR and thereby made valid\
    \ for use in\n          language tags.\n      4.  The UN numeric code elements\
    \ for \"economic groupings\" or\n          \"other groupings,\" and the alphanumeric\
    \ code elements in\n          Appendix X of the UN document, were not added to\
    \ the ILSR.\n      5.  The UN numeric code elements for countries or areas not\n\
    \          associated with an assigned [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code element\n    \
    \      were not added to the ILSR.  These values are listed in\n          Section\
    \ 4 and may be requested for registration by individuals\n          using the\
    \ process defined in [RFC4646] and according to the\n          rules described\
    \ therein.  Listing of these code elements in\n          this section is not a\
    \ guarantee of future registration.\n      6.  Code elements that were withdrawn,\
    \ vacated, or deprecated from\n          [UN_M.49] as of the date of adoption\
    \ of [RFC4646] were not\n          added to the ILSR.\n   Using the initial set\
    \ of subtags described above, the tags in the\n   [RFC3066] registry were evaluated\
    \ as follows:\n      7.  Tags in the [RFC3066] registry that were not deprecated,\n\
    \          consisted entirely of subtags already in this document, and\n     \
    \     have the correct form and format for tags defined by [RFC4646]\n       \
    \   were converted to records of type \"redundant\" in the ILSR.\n          For\
    \ example, \"zh-Hant\" is now defined by [RFC4646] because\n          'zh' is\
    \ an [ISO639-1] code element and 'Hant' is an [ISO15924]\n          code element,\
    \ and both are defined as subtags in the ILSR.\n      8.  Tags in the [RFC3066]\
    \ registry that contained one or more\n          subtags that either did not match\
    \ the valid registration\n          pattern or were not otherwise defined by [RFC4646]\
    \ were\n          converted to corresponding records of type \"grandfathered\"\
    \ in\n          the ILSR.  These records cannot become type \"redundant\" except\n\
    \          by revision of [RFC4646], but may have a \"Deprecated\" and\n     \
    \     \"Preferred-Value\" field added to them if a subsequent subtag\n       \
    \   assignment or combination of assignments renders the tag\n          obsolete.\n\
    \      9.  Tags in the [RFC3066] registry that had a notation that they\n    \
    \      were deprecated were converted to records of type\n          \"grandfathered\"\
    \ in the ILSR.  The record for the grandfathered\n          entry contains a \"\
    Deprecated\" field with the most appropriate\n          date that can be determined\
    \ for when the [RFC3066] record was\n          deprecated.  The \"Comments\" field\
    \ may optionally contain a\n          reason for the deprecation.  The \"Preferred-Value\"\
    \ field\n          contains a tag that replaces the value.  For example, the\n\
    \          [RFC3066] tag \"art-lojban\" is deprecated and thus appears as a\n\
    \          grandfathered tag in the ILSR.  Its \"Deprecated\" field\n        \
    \  contains the deprecation date (in this case \"2003-09-02\") and\n         \
    \ the \"Preferred-Value\" field the value \"jbo\".\n      10. The remaining tags\
    \ in the [RFC3066] registry are not\n          deprecated and have a format consistent\
    \ with language tags as\n          defined by [RFC4646] but contain subtags that\
    \ are not defined\n          in the ILSR.  These subtags are eligible for registration\
    \ as\n          variants.  The ILSR contains appropriate variant records for\n\
    \          the following list of subtags, and the registered [RFC3066]\n     \
    \     tags containing these subtags were entered into the ILSR as\n          type\
    \ \"redundant\":\n          1901 (use with Prefix: de)\n          1996 (use with\
    \ Prefix: de)\n          nedis (use with Prefix: sl)\n          rozaj (use with\
    \ Prefix: sl)\n      11. All remaining [RFC3066] registered tags were converted\
    \ to\n          records of type \"grandfathered\" in the ILSR.  Interested\n \
    \         parties may use the registration process in [RFC4646] to\n         \
    \ attempt to register the variant subtags not already present in\n          the\
    \ Language Subtag Registry.  If all of the subtags in the\n          original\
    \ tag become fully defined by the resulting\n          registrations, then the\
    \ original tag is superseded.  Such tags\n          will have their record changed\
    \ from type \"grandfathered\" to\n          type \"redundant\" in the registry.\
    \  Note that previous approval\n          of a tag under [RFC3066] is not a guarantee\
    \ of approval of a\n          variant subtag under [RFC4646].  The existing [RFC3066]\
    \ tag\n          maintains its validity, but the original reason for its\n   \
    \       registration might have become obsolete.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Omitted Code Elements\n   The following code elements from [UN_M.49] were\
    \ not associated with\n   [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code elements.  Consequently, they\
    \ were not\n   assigned as subtags in the initial Language Subtag Registry, but\
    \ were\n   valid candidates for registration as region subtags, using the\n  \
    \ process in [RFC4646]:\n      830   Channel Islands\n      831   Guernsey\n \
    \     832   Jersey\n      833   Isle of Man\n   The last three became ineligible\
    \ for registration in April, 2006,\n   when the [ISO3166-1] code elements GG,\
    \ JE, and IM were assigned as\n   region subtags.\n"
