  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4655] defines the PCE-based architecture and explains\
    \ how a Path\n   Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\
    \ in\n   networks controlled by Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic\n   Engineering\
    \ (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) at the request of\n   Path Computation\
    \ Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network\n   component that makes such\
    \ a request and may be, for instance, an\n   optical switching element within\
    \ a Wavelength Division Multiplexing\n   (WDM) network.  The PCE itself can be\
    \ located anywhere within the\n   network; it may be within an optical switching\
    \ element, a Network\n   Management System (NMS), or an Operational Support System\
    \ (OSS), or\n   it may be an independent network server.\n   The Path Computation\
    \ Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is the\n   communication protocol used\
    \ between a PCC and PCE; it may also be\n   used between cooperating PCEs.  [RFC4657]\
    \ sets out the common\n   protocol requirements for PCEP.  Additional application-specific\n\
    \   requirements for PCEP are deferred to separate documents.\n   This document\
    \ provides a set of application-specific PCEP\n   requirements for support of\
    \ path computation in Wavelength Switched\n   Optical Networks (WSONs).  WSON\
    \ refers to WDM-based optical networks\n   in which switching is performed selectively\
    \ based on the wavelength\n   of an optical signal.\n   The path in WSON is referred\
    \ to as a lightpath.  A lightpath may span\n   multiple fiber links, and the path\
    \ should be assigned a wavelength\n   for each link.\n   A transparent optical\
    \ network is made up of optical devices that can\n   switch but not convert from\
    \ one wavelength to another.  In a\n   transparent optical network, a lightpath\
    \ operates on the same\n   wavelength across all fiber links that it traverses.\
    \  In such cases,\n   the lightpath is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity\n\
    \   constraint.  Two lightpaths that share a common fiber link cannot be\n   assigned\
    \ the same wavelength.  To do otherwise would result in both\n   signals interfering\
    \ with each other.  Note that advanced additional\n   multiplexing techniques\
    \ such as polarization-based multiplexing are\n   not addressed in this document\
    \ since the physical-layer aspects are\n   not currently standardized.  Therefore,\
    \ assigning the proper\n   wavelength on a lightpath is an essential requirement\
    \ in the optical\n   path computation process.\n   When a switching node has the\
    \ ability to perform wavelength\n   conversion, the wavelength-continuity constraint\
    \ can be relaxed, and\n   a lightpath may use different wavelengths on different\
    \ links along\n   its path from origin to destination.  It is, however, to be\
    \ noted\n   that wavelength converters may be limited for cost reasons, while\
    \ the\n   number of WDM channels that can be supported in a fiber is also\n  \
    \ limited.  As a WSON can be composed of network nodes that cannot\n   perform\
    \ wavelength conversion, nodes with limited wavelength\n   conversion, and nodes\
    \ with full wavelength conversion abilities,\n   wavelength assignment is an additional\
    \ routing constraint to be\n   considered in all lightpath computations.\n   In\
    \ this document, we first review the processes for Routing and\n   Wavelength\
    \ Assignment (RWA) used when wavelength continuity\n   constraints are present\
    \ and then specify requirements for PCEP to\n   support RWA.  Requirements for\
    \ optical impairments will be addressed\n   in a separate document.\n   The remainder\
    \ of this document uses terminology from [RFC4655].\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  WSON RWA Processes and Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.  WSON RWA Processes and Architecture\n   In [RFC6163], three alternative process\
    \ architectures were given for\n   performing routing and wavelength assignment.\
    \  These are shown\n   schematically in Figure 1, where R stands for Routing,\
    \ WA for\n   Wavelength Assignment, and DWA for Distributed Wavelength Assignment.\n\

    \ Alternatives\n   These alternatives have the following properties and impact\
    \ on PCEP\n   requirements in this document.\n   (a)  Combined Process (R&WA)\n\
    \        Path selection and wavelength assignment are performed as a\n       \
    \ single process.  The requirements for PCC-PCE interaction with a\n        PCE\
    \ implementing such a combined RWA process are addressed in\n        this document.\n\
    \   (b)  Routing Separate from Wavelength Assignment (R+WA)\n        The routing\
    \ process furnishes one or more potential paths to the\n        wavelength assignment\
    \ process that then performs final path\n        selection and wavelength assignment.\
    \  The requirements for PCE-\n        PCE interaction with one PCE implementing\
    \ the routing process\n        and another implementing the wavelength assignment\
    \ process are\n        not addressed in this document.\n   (b') Routing and Distributed\
    \ Wavelength Assignment (R+DWA)\n        A standard path computation (unaware\
    \ of detailed wavelength\n        availability) takes place, and then wavelength\
    \ assignment is\n        performed along this path in a distributed manner via\
    \ signaling\n        (RSVP-TE).  This alternative is a particular case of R+WA\
    \ and\n        should be covered by GMPLS PCEP extensions; it does not present\n\
    \        new WSON-specific requirements.\n   The various process architectures\
    \ for implementing RWA have been\n   reviewed above.  Figure 2 shows one typical\
    \ PCE-based implementation,\n   which is referred to as the Combined Process (R&WA).\
    \  With this\n   architecture, the two processes of routing and wavelength assignment\n\
    \   are accessed via a single PCE.  This architecture is the base\n   architecture\
    \ from which the requirements are specified in this\n   document.\n          \

    \  (a)  An RWA computation type request MAY include the requester\n        preference\
