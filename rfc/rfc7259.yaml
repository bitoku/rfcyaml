  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), documented\
    \ in\n   [RFC6120], is a streaming XML technology that enables any two\n   entities\
    \ on a network to exchange well-defined but extensible XML\n   elements (called\
    \ \"XML stanzas\") in close to real time.  Given XMPP's\n   heritage in the Jabber\
    \ open-source community, one of the primary uses\n   for XMPP is instant messaging\
    \ and presence as documented in\n   [RFC6121], and XMPP addresses are still referred\
    \ to as Jabber IDs.\n   Because almost all human users of Jabber/XMPP instant\
    \ messaging and\n   presence systems also use email systems [RFC5322] and because\
    \ many\n   also use netnews systems [RFC5536], it can be helpful for them to\n\
    \   associate their Jabber IDs with the messages they author.  The\n   Jabber-ID\
    \ header field provides a standard location for that\n   information.\n   Members\
    \ of the XMPP instant messaging and presence community have\n   been experimenting\
    \ with the Jabber-ID header field for many years.\n   This document defines the\
    \ syntax and usage of the Jabber-ID header\n   field, including the information\
    \ necessary to register the field in\n   the Provisional Message Header Field\
    \ Names registry maintained by the\n   IANA.\n"
- title: 2.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.  Syntax\n   The syntax of the Jabber-ID header field is defined below using\n\
    \   Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234], where the \"pathxmpp\" rule is\n   defined\
    \ in the XMPP URI specification [RFC5122] and the remaining\n   rules are defined\
    \ in the Internet Message Format specification\n   [RFC5322]:\n      Jabber-ID\
    \ = SP *WSP pathxmpp *WSP CRLF\n   Although a native XMPP address can contain\
    \ virtually any Unicode\n   character [UNICODE], the header of an email or netnews\
    \ message is\n   allowed to contain only printable ASCII characters (see Section\
    \ 2 of\n   [RFC5322]).  Therefore, any characters outside the ASCII range\n  \
    \ [RFC20] in an XMPP address need to be converted to ASCII before\n   inclusion\
    \ in a Jabber-ID header field, in accordance with the rules\n   defined in the\
    \ XMPP URI specification [RFC5122].  In addition,\n   characters allowed in XMPP\
    \ localparts and XMPP resourceparts but\n   disallowed by the relevant URI rules\
    \ need to be percent-encoded in\n   accordance with the rules defined in the URI\
    \ specification [RFC3986].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Inclusion
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Inclusion\n   The Jabber-ID header field is associated with the author\
    \ of the\n   message; see [RFC5322].  If the \"From:\" header field of an email\n\
    \   message contains more than one mailbox, it is best not to add the\n   Jabber-ID\
    \ header field to the message.  To reduce the possibility of\n   confusion, it\
    \ is best to include only one instance of the Jabber-ID\n   header field in a\
    \ given message.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Generation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Generation\n   For a user whose XMPP address is \"juliet@example.com\"\
    , the\n   corresponding Jabber-ID header field would be:\n      Jabber-ID: juliet@example.com\n\
    \   As noted, non-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses need to be converted\n  \
    \ into ASCII before inclusion in a Jabber-ID header field.  Consider\n   the following\
    \ XMPP address:\n      ji&#x159;i@&#x10D;echy.example\n   In the foregoing example,\
    \ the string \"&#x159;\" stands for the Unicode\n   character LATIN SMALL LETTER\
    \ R WITH CARON and the string \"&#x10D;\"\n   stands for the Unicode character\
    \ LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CARON,\n   following the \"XML Notation\" used in\
    \ [RFC3987] to represent\n   characters that cannot be rendered in ASCII-only\
    \ documents.  For\n   those who do not read Czech, this example could be anglicized\
    \ as\n   \"george@czech-lands.example\".\n   Following the rules in [RFC5122]\
    \ and the Jabber-ID header field\n   syntax, the resulting header field might\
    \ be as shown below (note that\n   this representation includes folding white\
    \ space, which is allowed in\n   accordance with the ABNF):\n      Jabber-ID:\n\
    \             ji%C5%99i@%C4%8Dechy.example\n"
- title: 3.3.  Processing
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Processing\n   Upon receiving an email message or netnews message containing\
    \ a\n   Jabber-ID header field, a user agent that supports the field ought to\n\
    \   process the field by converting any escaped characters to characters\n   outside\
    \ the ASCII range in accordance with the rules defined in\n   [RFC5122], thus\
    \ yielding a Jabber ID that can be used for native\n   communication on the XMPP\
    \ network.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Disposition
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Disposition\n   A user agent that has processed a Jabber-ID header field\
    \ can provide\n   appropriate interface elements if it has independent information\n\
    \   linking the author of the email or netnews message with the specified\n  \
    \ Jabber ID (e.g., via a user-controlled address book or automated\n   directory\
    \ lookup).  Such interface elements might include an\n   indicator of \"presence\"\
    \ (i.e., that the author is online and\n   available for communication via XMPP)\
    \ if the user is subscribed to\n   the presence of the author, and an element\
    \ that enables the user to\n   send an instant message or initiate a text chat\
    \ session with the\n   author.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has added \"Jabber-ID\" to the Provisional\
    \ Message Header\n   Field Names registry.  The completed registration template\
    \ follows.\n   Header field name:  Jabber-ID\n   Applicable protocol:  mail, netnews\n\

- title: 5.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   Message headers are an existing standard\
    \ and are designed to easily\n   accommodate new types.  Although the Jabber-ID\
    \ header field could be\n   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email\
    \ and netnews.\n   However, because a forged Jabber-ID header field might break\n\
    \   automated processing, applications are discouraged from depending on\n   the\
    \ Jabber-ID header field to indicate the authenticity of an email\n   or netnews\
    \ message, or the identity of its author or sender.\n   Including the Jabber-ID\
    \ header field among the signer header fields\n   in DomainKeys Identified Mail\
    \ (DKIM) can help to mitigate against\n   forging of the header (see [RFC6376]).\n\
    \   Advertising XMPP addresses in email or netnews headers might make it\n   easier\
    \ for malicious users to harvest XMPP addresses and therefore to\n   send unsolicited\
    \ bulk communications to the users or applications\n   represented by those addresses.\
    \  Providing such a binding between an\n   email address and a Jabber ID can also\
    \ increase the possibility of\n   drawing a connection between different kinds\
    \ of communications\n   traffic for purposes of surveillance and other breaches\
    \ of privacy.\n   Care ought to be taken in balancing the benefits of open information\n\
    \   exchange against the potential costs of security and privacy\n   weaknesses.\
    \  An email or netnews user agent that is capable of\n   including the Jabber-ID\
    \ header field in outgoing email or netnews\n   messages needs to provide an option\
    \ for its user to disable inclusion\n   of the Jabber-ID header field generally,\
    \ on a per-recipient basis,\n   and on a per-message basis.\n   The security and\
    \ privacy considerations discussed in [RFC3986],\n   [RFC3987], [RFC5122], [RFC6120],\
    \ and [RFC6121] also apply to the\n   Jabber-ID message header.\n"
