- title: 3.1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Introduction\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point\n\
    \   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel\n   provides\
    \ a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols, such\n   as Small Computer\
    \ System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n   Performance Parallel Interface\
    \ (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.\n\
    \   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple\n   communication\
    \ points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a\n   switching network, called\
    \ a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n   Fibre Channel \"node\" consists\
    \ of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements,\
    \ some of which are\n   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port\
    \ on a switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a\
    \ single\n   port on a switch via an \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch\
    \ port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n\
    \   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n  \
    \ term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch\
    \ port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch\
    \ Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with\
    \ an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n\
    \   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and\n   most\
    \ ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names\n   are typically\
    \ formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found\
    \ in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n\
    \   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n  \
    \ the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address\
    \ identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the FC\n   address identifiers\
    \ are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.  Each\n   octet of a 24-bit address\
    \ represents a level in an address hierarchy,\n   a Domain_ID being the highest\
    \ level of the hierarchy.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Routing Protocols
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Routing Protocols\n   The routing of frames within the Fabric is normally\
    \ based on the\n   standard routing protocol, called the Fabric Shortest Path\
    \ First\n   (FSPF) protocol.  The operation of FSPF (or of any other routing\n\
    \   protocol) allows a switch to generate and maintain its own routing\n   table\
    \ of how to forward frames it receives; i.e., a table in which to\n   look up\
    \ the destination address of a received frame in order to\n   determine the best\
    \ link by which to forward that frame towards its\n   destination.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Virtual Fabrics
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Virtual Fabrics\n   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing\
    \ multiple\n   Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-4] (which replaces the previous\n\
    \   revision, [FC-SW-3]).  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the existing\n   specification\
    \ for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical\n   infrastructure, augmenting\
    \ it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics\n   and with the specification of\
    \ how multiple Virtual Fabrics can\n   operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.\
    \  The use of\n   Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its\
    \ header to\n   indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being\n\
    \   transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular \"Core Switch\"\n   [FC-SW-4]\
    \ (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are\n   processed by the\
    \ same \"Virtual Switch\" within that Core switch.\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel\
    \ [RFC2837] was focussed\n   on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced\
    \ by the more generic\n   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT], which defines\
    \ basic\n   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including\n   extensions\
    \ to the standard IF-MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel\n   interfaces.\n   This\
    \ MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the routing of traffic\n   within a Fabric\
    \ of a Fibre Channel network.  The standard routing\n   protocol for Fibre Channel\
    \ is FSPF [FC-SW-4].  Another MIB [RFC4626]\n   specifies management information\
    \ specific to FSPF.  This MIB contains\n   routing information that is independent\
    \ of FSPF (i.e., it would still\n   apply even if a routing protocol other than\
    \ FSPF were in use in the\n   network).\n   This MIB imports some common Textual\
    \ Conventions from T11-TC-MIB,\n   defined in [RFC4439].\n"
- title: 5.  MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation\
    \ of,\n   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF\n\
    \   protocol.  (Note that there are no definitions in this MIB module of\n   \"\
    managed actions\" that can be invoked via SNMP.)\n"
- title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance\
    \ is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel\
    \ functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel\
    \ management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).\
    \  For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent with multiple\
    \ AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, each\n   sub-agent implementing a different Fibre\
    \ Channel management instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from\
    \ the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [FC-MGMT] as the index value that uniquely identifies each\
    \ Fibre\n   Channel management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411],\n\
    \   Section 3.3.1).\n"
- title: 5.2.  Switch Index
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Switch Index\n   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as\
    \ a table of\n   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by\
    \ Fibre\n   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance\n\
    \   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,\n   fcmSwitchIndex,\
    \ is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value\n   that uniquely identifies\
    \ a Fibre Channel switch among those (one or\n   more) managed by the same Fibre\
    \ Channel management instance.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Fabric Index
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without\
    \ Virtual\n   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of FSPF within\
    \ a\n   Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all Fabric-related\n\
    \   information in tables that are INDEX-ed by an arbitrary integer,\n   named\
    \ a \"Fabric Index\", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from the\n   T11-TC-MIB.\
    \  When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric,\n   without use of\
    \ any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index\n   will always be 1.  In\
    \ an environment of multiple virtual and/or\n   physical Fabrics, this index provides\
    \ a means to distinguish one\n   Fabric from another.\n   It is quite possible,\
    \ and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel\n   switch will have ports connected\
    \ to multiple virtual and/or physical\n   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify\
    \ a management protocol query\n   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single\
    \ switch is connected,\n   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcRouteFabricIndex\
    \ when they\n   both appear in the same INDEX clause.\n"
- title: 5.4.  The t11FcRouteGroup Group
  contents:
  - "5.4.  The t11FcRouteGroup Group\n   This MIB contains one object group, the t11FcRouteGroup,\
    \ which\n   contains objects to allow the displaying and the configuring of\n\
    \   routes in the Fibre Channel Routing tables for the locally managed\n   switches.\n"
- title: 5.5.  The t11FcRouteTable's INDEX
  contents:
  - "5.5.  The t11FcRouteTable's INDEX\n   It is normally valuable for a MIB table\
    \ that contains routes to be\n   ordered such that a management application is\
    \ able to query the table\n   based on some attribute, without having to read\
    \ every row in the MIB\n   table.  This requires that the rows in the table be\
    \ ordered according\n   to such attributes, and thus that those attributes be\
    \ represented by\n   objects included in the table's INDEX clause.  Examples of\
    \ this can\n   be seen in the ipCidrRouteTable [RFC2096] and, more recently, the\n\
    \   inetCidrRouteTable in [RFC4292].\n   While this useful feature results in\
    \ an unusually large number (ten)\n   of objects in the t11FcRouteTable's INDEX\
    \ clause, all ten are either\n   integers or strings of 3 (or zero) octet length,\
    \ so the resulting\n   OIDs are not unusually large.  (Specifically, the aggregate\
    \ number of\n   sub-identifiers to be appended to an OBJECT-TYPE's OID, when naming\n\
    \   an instance of an object in the t11FcRouteTable, is at most 22 sub-\n   identifiers;\
    \ i.e., less than the *minimum* number to be appended for\n   the inetCidrRouteTable\
    \ table.)\n"

    \ Such routes are used by a switch to forward frames (of user\n           data)\

  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are several management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module with\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such objects\n   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability are:\n        t11FcRouteDomainId,\
    \ t11FcRouteMetric, t11FcRouteType,\n        t11FcRouteIfDown, t11FcRouteRowStatus\n\
    \           -- configure new routes and/or modify existing routes.\n   Such objects\
    \ may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some\n   network environments.\
    \  For example, the ability to change network\n   topology or network speed may\
    \ afford an attacker the ability to\n   obtain better performance at the expense\
    \ of other network users.  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure\
    \ environment without proper\n   protection can have a negative effect on network\
    \ operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects\
    \ with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  The objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability are: the write-able\
    \ objects listed above\n   plus one other:\n        t11FcRouteLastChangeTime\n\
    \           -- the time of the last routing table change.\n   SNMP versions prior\
    \ to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
