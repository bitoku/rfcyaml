  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a way for an Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate\
    \ System (IS-IS) router to advertise multiple types of\n   supported Maximum SID\
    \ Depths (MSDs) at node and/or link granularity.\n   Such advertisements allow\
    \ entities (e.g., centralized controllers) to\n   determine whether a particular\
    \ Segment ID (SID) stack can be\n   supported in a given network.  This document\
    \ only defines one type of\n   MSD: Base MPLS Imposition.  However, it defines\
    \ an encoding that can\n   support other MSD types.  This document focuses on\
    \ MSD use in a\n   network that is Segment Routing (SR) enabled, but MSD may also\
    \ be\n   useful when SR is not enabled.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   When Segment Routing (SR) paths are computed by a centralized\n\
    \   controller, it is critical that the controller learn the Maximum SID\n   Depth\
    \ (MSD) that can be imposed at each node/link of a given SR path.\n   This ensures\
    \ that the Segment Identifier (SID) stack depth of a\n   computed path does not\
    \ exceed the number of SIDs the node is capable\n   of imposing.\n   [PCEP-EXT]\
    \ defines how to signal MSD in the Path Computation Element\n   Communication\
    \ Protocol (PCEP).  However, if PCEP is not supported/\n   configured on the head-end\
    \ of an SR tunnel or a Binding-SID anchor\n   node, and the controller does not\
    \ participate in IGP routing, it has\n   no way of learning the MSD of nodes and\
    \ links.  BGP-LS (Distribution\n   of Link-State and TE Information Using Border\
    \ Gateway Protocol)\n   [RFC7752] defines a way to expose topology and associated\
    \ attributes\n   and capabilities of the nodes in that topology to a centralized\n\
    \   controller.  MSD signaling by BGP-LS has been defined in [MSD-BGP].\n   Typically,\
    \ BGP-LS is configured on a small number of nodes that do\n   not necessarily\
    \ act as head-ends.  In order for BGP-LS to signal MSD\n   for all the nodes and\
    \ links in the network for which MSD is relevant,\n   MSD capabilities SHOULD\
    \ be advertised by every Intermediate System to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS)\
    \ router in the network.\n   Other types of MSDs are known to be useful.  For\
    \ example, [ELC-ISIS]\n   defines Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD), which is\
    \ used by a head-\n   end to insert an Entropy Label (EL) at a depth where it\
    \ can be read\n   by transit nodes.\n   This document defines an extension to\
    \ IS-IS used to advertise one or\n   more types of MSDs at node and/or link granularity.\
    \  It also creates\n   an IANA registry for assigning MSD-Type identifiers and\
    \ defines the\n   Base MPLS Imposition MSD-Type.  In the future, it is expected\
    \ that\n   new MSD-Types will be defined to signal additional capabilities,\n\
    \   e.g., entropy labels, SIDs that can be imposed through recirculation,\n  \
    \ or SIDs associated with another data plane such as IPv6.\n   MSD advertisements\
    \ MAY be useful even if Segment Routing itself is\n   not enabled.  For example,\
    \ in a non-SR MPLS network, MSD defines the\n   maximum label depth.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   BMI:  Base MPLS Imposition is the number of MPLS labels\
    \ that can be\n         imposed inclusive of all service/transport/special labels.\n\
    \   MSD:  Maximum SID Depth is the number of SIDs supported by a node or\n   \
    \      a link on a node.\n   SID:  Segment Identifier is defined in [RFC8402].\n\
    \   Label Imposition:  Imposition is the act of modifying and/or adding\n    \
    \     labels to the outgoing label stack associated with a packet.\n         This\
    \ includes:\n         *  replacing the label at the top of the label stack with\
    \ a new\n            label\n         *  pushing one or more new labels onto the\
    \ label stack\n   The number of labels imposed is then the sum of the number of\
    \ labels\n   that are replaced and the number of labels that are pushed.  See\n\

  - "4.  Procedures for Defining and Using Node and Link MSD Advertisements\n   When\
    \ Link MSD is present for a given MSD-Type, the value of the Link\n   MSD MUST\
    \ take precedence over the Node MSD.  If a Link MSD-Type is\n   not signaled,\
    \ but the Node MSD-Type is, then the Node MSD-Type value\n   MUST be considered\
    \ to be the MSD value for that link.\n   In order to increase flooding efficiency,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED that\n   routers with homogenous Link MSD values advertise\
    \ just the Node MSD\n   value.\n   The meaning of the absence of both Node and\
    \ Link MSD advertisements\n   for a given MSD-Type is specific to the MSD-Type.\
    \  Generally, it can\n   only be inferred that the advertising node does not support\n\
    \   advertisement of that MSD-Type.  In some cases, however, the lack of\n   advertisement\
    \ might imply that the functionality associated with the\n   MSD-Type is not supported.\
