  - "1. Introduction\n   As part of the validation process for the development of\
    \ URNs the\n   IETF working group agreed that it is important to demonstrate that\n\
    \   the current URN syntax proposal can accommodate existing identifiers\n   from\
    \ well established namespaces.  One such infrastructure for\n   assigning and\
    \ managing names comes from the bibliographic community.\n   Bibliographic identifiers\
    \ function as names for objects that exist\n   both in print and, increasingly,\
    \ in electronic formats.  RFC 2288\n   [Lynch] investigated the feasibility of\
    \ using three identifiers\n   (ISBN, ISSN and SICI) as URNs.\n   This document\
    \ will analyse the usage of national bibliography numbers\n   (NBNs) as URNs.\
    \  The need to extend analysis to new identifier\n   systems was briefly discussed\
    \ in RFC 2288 as well, with the following\n   summary: \"The issues involved in\
    \ supporting those additional\n   identifiers are anticipated to be broadly similar\
    \ to those involved\n   in supporting ISBNs, ISSNs, and SICIs\".\n   A registration\
    \ request for acquiring a Namespace Identifier (NID)\n   \"NBN\" for national\
    \ bibliography numbers has been written by the\n   National Library of Finland\
    \ on the request of the Conference of\n   Directors of National Libraries (CDNL)\
    \ and the Conference of the\n   European National Librarians (CENL).  Chapter\
    \ 5 contains a URN\n   namespace registration request modeled according to the\
    \ template in\n   RFC 2611.\n   The document at hand is part of a global co-operation\
    \ of the national\n   libraries to foster identification of electronic documents\
    \ in general\n   and utilisation of URNs in particular.  Some national libraries,\n\
    \   including the national libraries of Finland, Norway and Sweden, are\n   already\
    \ assigning NBN-based URNs for electronic resources.\n   We have used the URN\
    \ Namespace Identifier \"NBN\" for the national\n   bibliographic numbers in examples\
    \ below.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Identification vs. Resolution\n   As a rule the national bibliography numbers\
    \ identify finite,\n   manageably-sized objects, but these objects may still be\
    \ large enough\n   that resolution to a hierarchical system is appropriate.\n\
    \   The materials identified by a national bibliography number may exist\n   only\
    \ in printed or other physical form, not electronically.  The best\n   that a\
    \ resolver will be able to offer in this case is bibliographic\n   data from a\
    \ national bibliography database, including information\n   about where the physical\
    \ resource is stored in a national library's\n   holdings.\n   The URN Framework\
    \ provides resolution services that may be used to\n   describe any differences\
    \ between the resource identified by a URN and\n   the resource that would be\
    \ returned as a result of resolving that\n   URN.  However, NBNs will be used\
    \ for instance to identify resources\n   in digital Web archives created by harvester\
    \ robot applications.  In\n   this case, NBN will identify exactly the resource\
    \ the user expects to\n   see.\n"

  - "3.1 Overview\n   National Bibliography Number (NBN) is a generic name referring\
    \ to a\n   group of identifier systems utilised by the national libraries and\n\
    \   only by them for identification of deposited publications which lack\n   an\
    \ identifier, or to descriptive metadata (cataloging) that describes\n   the resources.\
    \  In many countries legal (or voluntary) deposit is\n   being extended to electronic\
    \ publications.\n   Each national library uses its own NBN strings independently\
    \ of other\n   national libraries; there is no global authority which controls\
    \ them.\n   For this reason NBNs are unique only on national level.  When used\
    \ as\n   URNs, NBN strings must be augmented with a controlled prefix such as\n\
    \   country code.  These prefixes guarantee uniqueness of the NBN-based\n   URNs\
    \ on the global scale.\n   NBNs have traditionally been given to documents that\
    \ do not have a\n   publisher-assigned identifier, but are cataloged to the national\n\
    \   bibliography.  NBNs can be seen as a fall-back mechanism: if no\n   other,\
    \ better established identifier such as ISBN can be given, an\n   NBN is assigned.\
    \  In principle, NBN usage enables identification of\n   any Internet document.\
    \  Local policies may limit the NBN usage to a\n   much smaller subset of documents.\n\
    \   Some national libraries (e.g., Finland, Norway, Sweden) have\n   established\
    \ Web-based URN generators, which enable authors and\n   publishers to fetch NBN-based\
    \ URNs for their network documents.  At\n   least national libraries of Sweden\
    \ and Finland are harvesting and\n   archiving domestic Web documents (and a number\
    \ of other libraries\n   plan to start this activity), and long-time preservation\
    \ of these\n   materials requires persistent and unique identification.  NBNs\
    \ can be\n   and are in fact already used as internal identifiers in these Web\n\
    \   archives.\n   Both syntax and scope of NBNs can be decided by each national\
    \ library\n   independently.  Typically, an NBN consist of one or more letters\n\
    \   and/or digits.  This simple syntax makes NBNs infinitely extensible\n   and\
    \ very suitable for e.g., naming of the Web documents.  For\n   instance the application\
    \ used by the national library of Finland for\n   Web harvesting creates NBNs\
    \ which are based on the MD5 checksum of\n   the archived resource.\n"
- title: 3.2 F-code
  contents:
  - "3.2 F-code\n   F-code is the NBN used by the National Library of Finland.\n \
    \  F-codes have been used since early 20th century to identify catalogue\n   cards\
    \ and later MARC records in the national bibliography.  In 1998\n   the national\
    \ library decided to enable the Finnish authors and\n   publishers to assign F-codes\
    \ to their Internet documents, if these\n   documents do not qualify for other\
    \ identifiers such as ISBN.  F-\n   codes, embedded into URNs, can be fetched\
    \ from the URN generator\n   (http://www.lib.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/urn.pl) developed\
    \ in co-operation\n   between the national library of Finland and the Lund University\n\
    \   library, NETLAB unit.  Attached to the generator there is a user\n   guide\
    \ (http://www.lib.helsinki.fi/meta/URN-opas.html; only in\n   Finnish), which\
    \ tells the users how to use URNs.\n   F-codes are also used within the Web harvesting\
    \ and archiving\n   software (http://www.csc.fi/sovellus/nedlib/), which has been\
    \ built\n   for the Networked European Deposit Library (NEDLIB) project (see\n\
    \   http://www.kb.nl/nedlib).  NEDLIB harvester calculates MD5 checksum\n   for\
    \ each archived resource, and then builds an NBN-based URN from the\n   checksum.\
    \  The URN serves then as a unique identifier to the archived\n   resource.  Traditional\
    \ identifiers can not be used for this purpose,\n   since there may for instance\
    \ be several variants of a book which\n   (quite rightly so) all have the same\
    \ ISBN.  Moreover, identifiers\n   embedded into a document do not necessarily\
    \ belong to the document\n   itself; thus the Web archiving application can not\
    \ trust the\n   identifiers embedded into the body of the document.\n   The F-code\
    \ built by the URN generator consist of:\n   Prefix (for example fe)\n   Year\
    \ (YYYY; for example 1999)\n   Number (for example 1055)\n   The generator also\
    \ adds namespace identifier \"NBN\" and ISO 3166\n   country code.  Thus a URN\
    \ based on F-code would in this case be for\n   instance urn:nbn:fi-fe19991055.\n\
    \   URNs created by the Web archiving application have similar overall\n   structure,\
    \ except that prefix (which may be defined by the operator)\n   is fea and year\
    \ is not used.  An example:  urn:nbn:fi-fea-\n   5c5875e6e49ae649cad63e5ee4f6c346.\n\
    \   F-codes never need any special encoding when used as URNs, since they\n  \
    \ consist of alphanumeric codes only (0-9, a-z).  This is often the\n   case for\
    \ other national libraries' NBN systems as well.\n"
- title: 3.3 Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence
  contents:
  - "3.3 Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence\n   Embedding NBNs within\
    \ the URN framework usually presents no\n   particular encoding problems, since\
    \ all of the characters that can\n   appear in commonly used NBN systems can be\
    \ expressed in special\n   encoding, as described in RFC 2141 [MOATS].\n   When\
    \ an NBN is used as a URN, the namespace specific string will\n   consist of three\
    \ parts: prefix, consisting of either a two-letter ISO\n   3166 country code or\
    \ other registered string, delimiting character\n   which is either hyphen (-)\
    \ or colon (:), and NBN string assigned by\n   the national library.  Delimiting\
    \ characters are not lexically\n   equivalent.\n   Hyphen is always used for separating\
    \ the prefix and the NBN string.\n   Colon is used as the delimiting character\
    \ if and only if a country\n   code-based NBN namespace is split further in smaller\
    \ sub-namespaces.\n   If there are several national libraries in one country,\
    \ these\n   libraries can split their national namespace into smaller parts using\n\
    \   this method.\n   A national library may also assign a trusted organisation(s)\
    \ its own\n   sub-namespace.  For instance, the national library of Finland has\n\
    \   given Statistics Finland (http://www.stat.fi/index_en.html) a sub-\n   namespace\
    \ \"st\" (e.g., urn:nbn:fi:st:).  The Finnish Council of State\n   (http://www.vn.fi/vn/english/index.htm)\
    \ will use sub-namespace \"vn\"\n   (e.g., urn:nbn:fi:vn).\n   Non-ISO 3166-prefixes,\
    \ if used, must be registered on the global\n   level. The Library of Congress\
    \ will maintain the central register of\n   reserved codes.  This register will\
    \ be available to the national\n   libraries and other users in the Web.\n   Sub-namespace\
    \ codes beneath a country-code-based namespace need to be\n   registered on the\
    \ national level by the national library which\n   assigned the code.  The national\
    \ register must be available in the\n   Web and should also be linked to the global\
    \ register maintained by\n   the Library of Congress.\n   Two-letter codes may\
    \ not be used as non-ISO prefixes, since all such\n   codes are reserved for existing\
    \ and possible future ISO country\n   codes. If there are several national libraries\
    \ in one country who use\n   the same prefix - for instance, a country code -,\
    \ they need to agree\n   on how to split the namespace between them.\n   Models:\n\
    \   URN:NBN:<ISO 3166 country code>-<assigned NBN string>\n   URN:NBN:<ISO 3166\
    \ country code>:<sub-namespace code>-<assigned NBN\n   string>\n   URN:NBN:<non-ISO\

    \ manually.  If\n   identifiers are allocated programmatically, the only criteria\
    \ that\n   can be used is that two documents which are identical on the bit\n\
    \   level (have the same MD5 checksum) are deemed identical and should\n   receive\
    \ the same NBN.  The likelihood of this happening to dissimilar\n   documents\
    \ is about 2^64, according to the RFC 1321.\n   The rules governing the usage\
    \ of NBNs are less strict than those\n   specifying the usage of ISBN or other,\
    \ better established\n   identifiers. Since the NBNs have up to now been given\
    \ only by the\n   personnel (cataloguers) working in the national libraries, the\n\
    \   identifier assignment has in practice been well co-ordinated.\n   A NBN-based\
    \ URN will resolve to single instance of the work if\n   identifier assignment\
    \ has been automatic.  Given the nature of NBNs\n   it is also likely that different\
    \ versions of the same work will\n   receive different NBNs even if the identifier\
    \ is given manually.\n"

    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n   National Bibliography Number (NBN) is\
    \ a generic name referring to a\n   group of identifier systems used by the national\
    \ libraries for\n   identification of deposited publications which lack an identifier,\
    \ or\n   to descriptive metadata (cataloguing) that describes the resources.\n\
    \   Each national library uses its own NBN system independently of other\n   national\
    \ libraries; there is no global authority which controls\n   syntax of these identifier\
    \ systems.\n   Each national library can decide freely which resources will receive\n\
    \   NBNs.  These identifiers have traditionally been assigned to\n   documents\
    \ that do not have a publisher-assigned identifier, but are\n   nevertheless catalogued\
    \ to the national bibliography.  Typically\n   identification of grey publications\
    \ have largely been dependent on\n   NBNs.\n   Some national libraries (Finland,\
    \ Norway, Sweden) have established\n   Web-based URN generators, which enable\
    \ authors and publishers to\n   fetch NBN-based URNs for their network documents.\n\
    \   Both syntax and scope of NBNs is decided by each national library\n   independently.\
    \  Typically, a NBN consist of one or more letters and a\n   number.\n   Identifier\
    \ uniqueness considerations:\n   NBN strings assigned by two national libraries\
    \ may be identical.  For\n   this reason usage of a controlled prefix in the namespace\
    \ specific\n   string is obligatory in order to guarantee global uniqueness of\
    \ NBN-\n   based URNs.\n   In the national level, libraries utilise different\
    \ policies for\n   guaranteeing uniqueness.  A national library may automate the\n\
    \   delivery of NBN-based URNs.  In this case, the NBNs are assigned\n   sequentially\
    \ by a program (URN generator).\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n \
    \  Persistence of the NBNs as identifiers is guaranteed by the\n   persistence\
    \ of national libraries and information systems, such as\n   national bibliographies,\
    \ maintained by them.  NBNs have been used for\n   several centuries for printed\
    \ materials.  NBN-based identification of\n   electronic documents is a recent\
    \ practice, but it is likely to\n   continue for a very long time.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier assignment:\n   Assignment of NBN-based URNs is always controlled\
    \ on national level\n   by the national library / national libraries.  The Conference\
    \ of\n   Directors of National Librarians (CDNL) has established in 1999 a\n \
    \  task force, which will co-ordinate the URN usage in all national\n   libraries.\n\
    \   National libraries may choose different strategies in assigning NBN-\n   based\
    \ URNs.  One option is assignment by the library personnel only.\n   This is done\
    \ when the document is catalogued into the national\n   bibliography.  Thus in\
    \ this case the national bibliography database\n   will serve as the URN resolution\
    \ service.\n   A national library may also set up a URN generator (generators),\
    \ and\n   allow publishers and authors to retrieve NBN-based URNs from there.\n\
    \   In this case there is no guarantee that the identified resource will\n   ever\
    \ be catalogued into the national bibliography, and URN resolution\n   is dependent\
    \ on Web index/archive.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n   URNs based\
    \ on NBNs will be primarily resolved via the national\n   bibliography databases.\
    \  In one model these databases contain\n   detailed resource descriptions including\
    \ URLs, which will point both\n   to the copy of the document in the Internet\
    \ and to the copy in the\n   national library's (legal) deposit collection.  Due\
    \ to the\n   limitations in the usage of legal deposit documents it is possible\n\
    \   that the deposited materials can not be delivered outside the\n   premises\
    \ of the national library.\n   For those documents not catalogued into the national\
    \ bibliography\n   database URN resolution may take place via national or international\n\
    \   Web indexes and/or archives.  Nordic national libraries have\n   established\
    \ in autumn 2000 a joint initiative called Nordic Web\n   Archive (NWA), which\
    \ aims at creating a national Web archive into all\n   Nordic countries. Indexes\
    \ to these archive systems will be able to\n   act as URN resolution services\
    \ of any document which a) is or has\n   been available via the Web, and b) had\
    \ an URN embedded into it.\n   Country code and additional sub-namespace information\
    \ will provide a\n   guide to where to find appropriate resolution services. \
    \ For\n   instance, if the country code is \"fi\", the primary resolution service\n\
    \   is the national bibliography database.  Secondary resolution service\n   is\
    \ the Web archive.\n   Generally, there will be one or more resolution services\
    \ specified\n   for each country, depending on the assignment policy and services\
    \ of\n   the national library.  If NBN assignment is limited to the national\n\
    \   bibliography database, then all NBN-based URNs for that country will\n   be\
    \ resolved there.  If the authors and publishers have been allowed\n   to retrieve\
    \ NBNs to their Web resources, URN resolution services\n   require a national\
    \ Web archive.  If other organisations have been\n   allowed to assign NBNs, they\
    \ may also set up their own URN resolution\n   services.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n   None in the global level.  Any national library may provide\
    \ its own\n   rules, on the basis of its NBN syntax.\n   Conformance with URN\
    \ Syntax:\n   All NBNs we know of are ASCII strings consisting of letters (a-z)\
    \ and\n   numbers (0-9).  If NBN contains characters that are reserved in the\n\
    \   URN syntax, this data must be presented in hex encoded form as\n   defined\
    \ in RFC 2141.  A national library may limit the full scope of\n   its NBN strings\
    \ in URN usage in such a way that there are no reserved\n   characters in the\
    \ URN namespace specific strings.\n   Validation mechanism:\n   None specified\
    \ on the global level.  A national library may use NBNs,\n   which contain a checksum\
    \ and can therefore be validated, but this is\n   for the time being not a common\
    \ practice.\n   Scope:\n   Global.\n"
