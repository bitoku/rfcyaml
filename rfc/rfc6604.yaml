  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) has long provided means, such
    as the\n   CNAME (Canonical Name [RFC1035]) and DNAME [RFC2672] RRs (Resource\n
    \  Records), whereby a DNS query can be redirected to a different name.\n   In
    particular, CNAME normally causes a query to its owner name to be\n   redirected,
    while DNAME normally causes a query to any lower-level\n   name to be redirected.
    \ There has been a proposal for another\n   redirection RR.  In addition, as specified
    in [RFC2672], redirection\n   through a DNAME also results in the synthesis of
    a CNAME RR in the\n   response.  In this document, we will refer to all RRs causing
    such\n   redirection as xNAME RRs.\n   xNAME RRs can be explicitly retrieved by
    querying for the xNAME type.\n   When a different type is queried and an xNAME
    RR is encountered, the\n   xNAME RR (and possibly a synthesized CNAME) is added
    to the answer in\n   the response, DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4035]
    RRs\n   applicable to the xNAME RR may be added to the response, and the\n   query
    is restarted with the name to which it was redirected.\n   An xNAME may redirect
    a query to a name at which there is another\n   xNAME and so on.  In this document,
    we use \"xNAME chain\" to refer to\n   a series of one or more xNAMEs each of
    which refers to another xNAME\n   except the last, which refers to a non-xNAME
    or results in an error.\n   A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code)
    field, used for\n   indicating errors, and status bits that indicate whether an
    answer is\n   authoritative and/or authentic.  This document clarifies, in the
    case\n   of such redirected queries, how the RCODE and status bits correspond\n
    \  to the initial query cycle (where the (first) xNAME was detected) and\n   subsequent
    or final query cycles.\n"

    title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Restatement of Status Bits and What They Mean\n   There are two status bits
    returned in query responses for which a\n   question could arise as to how, in
    the case of an xNAME chain, they\n   relate to the first, possible intermediate,
    and/or last queries, as\n   below.  Note that the following is unchanged from
    [RFC1035] and\n   [RFC4035].  The meaning of these bits is simply restated here
    for\n   clarity, because of observations of released implementations that did\n
    \  not follow these meanings.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  The Authoritative Answer Bit\n   The AA, or Authoritative Answer bit,
      in the DNS response header\n   indicates that the answer returned is from a
      DNS server authoritative\n   for the zone containing that answer.  For an xNAME
      chain, this\n   \"authoritative\" status could be different for each answer
      in that\n   chain.\n   [RFC1035] states that the AA bit is to be set based on
      whether the\n   server providing the answer with the first owner name in the
      answer\n   section is authoritative.  This specification of the AA bit has not\n
      \  been changed.\n"
    title: 2.1.  The Authoritative Answer Bit
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  The Authentic Data Bit\n   The AD, or Authentic Data bit, indicates that
      the response returned\n   is authentic according to the dictates of DNSSEC [RFC4035].\n
      \  [RFC4035] unambiguously states that the AD bit is to be set in a DNS\n   response
      header only if the DNSSEC-enabled server believes all RRs in\n   the answer
      and authority sections of that response to be authentic.\n   This specification
      of the AD bit has not been changed.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  RCODE Clarification\n   The RCODE field in a DNS query response header is
    non-zero to\n   indicate an error.  Section 4.3.2 of [RFC1034] has a resolution\n
    \  algorithm that includes CNAME processing but has been found to be\n   unclear
    concerning the ultimate setting of RCODE in the case of such\n   redirection.
    \ Section 2.1 of [RFC2308] implies that the RCODE should\n   be set based on the
    last query cycle in the case of an xNAME chain,\n   but Section 2.2.1 of [RFC2308]
    says that some servers don't do that!\n   When there is an xNAME chain, the RCODE
    field is set as follows:\n      When an xNAME chain is followed, all but the last
    query cycle\n      necessarily had no error.  The RCODE in the ultimate DNS response\n
    \     MUST BE set based on the final query cycle leading to that\n      response.
    \ If the xNAME chain was terminated by an error, it will\n      be that error
    code.  If the xNAME chain terminated without error,\n      it will be zero.\n"
  title: 3.  RCODE Clarification
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The AA header flag bit is not protected by DNSSEC
    [RFC4033].  To\n   secure it, secure communications are needed between the querying\n
    \  resolver and the DNS server.  Such security can be provided by DNS\n   transaction
    security, either TSIG [RFC2845] or SIG(0) [RFC2931].\n   An AD header flag bit
    and the RCODE in a response are not, in\n   general, protected by DNSSEC, so the
    same conditions as stated in the\n   previous paragraph generally apply to them;
    however, this is not\n   always true.  In particular, if the following apply,
    then the AD bit\n   and an NXDOMAIN RCODE are protected by DNSSEC in the sense
    that the\n   querier can calculate whether they are correct:\n   1. The zone where
    an NXDOMAIN RCODE occurs or all the zones where the\n      data whose authenticity
    would be indicated by the AD flag bit are\n      signed zones.\n   2. The query
    or queries involved indicate that DNSSEC RRs are OK in\n      responses.\n   3.
    The responses providing these indications are from servers that\n      include
    the additional DNSSEC RRs required by DNSSEC.\n   4. The querier has appropriate
    trust anchor(s) and appropriately\n      validates and processes the DNSSEC RRs
    in the response.\n"
