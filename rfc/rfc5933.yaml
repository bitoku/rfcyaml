  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical
    distributed\n   database for Internet Naming.  The DNS has been extended to use\n
    \  cryptographic keys and digital signatures for the verification of the\n   authenticity
    and integrity of its data.  RFC 4033 [RFC4033], RFC 4034\n   [RFC4034], and RFC
    4035 [RFC4035] describe these DNS Security\n   Extensions, called DNSSEC.\n   RFC
    4034 describes how to store DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records,\n   and specifies
    a list of cryptographic algorithms to use.  This\n   document extends that list
    with the signature and hash algorithms\n   GOST R 34.10-2001 ([GOST3410], [RFC5832])
    and GOST R 34.11-94\n   ([GOST3411], [RFC5831]), and specifies how to store DNSKEY
    data and\n   how to produce RRSIG resource records with these algorithms.\n   Familiarity
    with DNSSEC and with GOST signature and hash algorithms\n   is assumed in this
    document.\n   The term \"GOST\" is not officially defined, but is usually used
    to\n   refer to the collection of the Russian cryptographic algorithms\n   GOST
    R 34.10-2001 [RFC5832], GOST R 34.11-94 [RFC5831], and\n   GOST 28147-89 [RFC5830].
    \ Since GOST 28147-89 is not used in DNSSEC,\n   \"GOST\" will only refer to GOST
    R 34.10-2001 and GOST R 34.11-94 in\n   this document.\n"
