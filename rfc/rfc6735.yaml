  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a number of Attribute-Value Pairs
    (AVP) that\n   can be used within the Diameter protocol [RFC6733] to convey a\n
    \  specific set of priority parameters.  These parameters are specified\n   in
    other documents, but are briefly described below.  The\n   corresponding AVPs
    defined in Section 3 are extensions to those\n   defined in [RFC5866].  We note
    that all the priority fields\n   associated with the AVPs defined in this document
    are extensible and\n   allow for additional values beyond what may have already
    been defined\n   or registered with IANA.\n   Priority influences the distribution
    of resources and, in turn, the\n   QoS associated with that resource.  This influence
    may be\n   probabilistic, ranging between (but not including) 0% and 100%, or
    it\n   may be in the form of a guarantee to either receive or not receive\n   the
    resource.\n   Another example of how prioritization can be realized is articulated\n
    \  in Appendix A.3 (the Priority Bypass Model) of [RFC6401].  In this\n   case,
    prioritized flows may gain access to resources that are never\n   shared with
    non-prioritized flows.\n"

    - "1.1.  Other Priority-Related AVPs\n   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project
      (3GPP) has defined several\n   Diameter AVPs that support prioritization of
      sessions.  The following\n   AVPs are intended to be used for priority services
      (e.g., Multimedia\n   Priority Service):\n      -  Reservation-Priority AVP
      as defined in [ETSI]\n      -  MPS-Identifier AVP as defined in [3GPPa]\n      -
      \ Priority-Level AVP (as part of the Allocation Retention\n         Priority
      AVP) as defined in [3GPPb]\n      -  Session-Priority AVP as defined in [3GPPc]
      and [3GPPd]\n   Both the Reservation-Priority AVP and the Priority-Level AVP
      can\n   carry priority levels associated with a session initiated by a user.\n
      \  We note that these AVPs are defined from the allotment set aside for\n   3GPP
      for Diameter-based interfaces, and they are particularly aimed\n   at IP Multimedia
      Subsystem (IMS) deployment environments.  The above\n   AVPs defined by 3GPP
      are to be viewed as private implementations\n   operating within a walled garden.
      \ In contrast, the priority-related\n   AVPs defined below in Section 3 are
      not constrained to IMS\n   environments.  The potential applicability or use-case
      scenarios that\n   involve coexistence between the above 3GPP-defined priority-related\n
      \  AVPs and those defined below in Section 3 is for further study.\n"

    a\n   continuation of the list of AVPs defined in [RFC5624].  The syntax\n   notation

    AVPs, nor the Diameter\n   protocol, perform or realize the QoS for a session

  - "4.  Examples of Usage\n   Usage of the Dual-Priority, Admission-Priority, and
    Application-\n   Level-Resource-Priority AVPs can all be illustrated by the same\n
    \  simple network scenario, although they would not all typically be\n   used
    in the same network.  The scenario is as follows:\n   A user with special authorization
    is authenticated by a Network\n   Access Server (NAS), which acts as a client
    to a Diameter Server\n   supporting the user's desired application.  Once the
    user has\n   authenticated, the Diameter Server provides the NAS with information\n
    \  on the user's authorized QoS, including instances of the Dual-\n   Priority,
    Admission-Priority, and/or Application-Level-Resource-\n   Priority AVPs.\n   Local
    policy governs the usage of the values conveyed by these AVPs\n   at the NAS to
    decide whether the flow associated with the user's\n   application can be admitted.
    \ If the decision is positive, the NAS\n   forwards the authorized QoS values
    as objects in RSVP signaling.  In\n   particular, the values in the Dual-Priority
    AVP would be carried in\n   the \"Signaled Preemption Priority Policy Element\"
    defined in\n   [RFC3181], and the values contained in the Admission-Priority and\n
    \  Application-Level-Resource-Priority AVPs would be carried in the\n   corresponding
    policy objects defined in [RFC6401].  Each subsequent\n   node would make its
    own decision taking account of the authorized QoS\n   objects including the priority-related
    objects, again governed by\n   local policy.  The example assumes that the user
    session terminates\n   on a host or server in the same administrative domain as
    the NAS to\n   avoid complications due to the restricted applicability of [RFC3181]\n
    \  and [RFC6401].\n   Local policy might for example indicate:\n      -  which
    value to take if both Admission-Priority and Application-\n         Level-Resource-Priority
    are present;\n      -  which namespace or namespaces are recognized for use in\n
    \        Application-Level-Resource-Priority;\n      -  which resources are subject
    to preemption if the values in\n         Dual-Priority are high enough to allow
    it.\n   A scenario for the use of the SIP-Resource-Priority AVP will differ\n
    \  slightly from the previous one, in that the initial decision point\n   would
    typically be a SIP proxy receiving a session initiation request\n   containing
    a Resource-Priority header field and deciding whether to\n   admit the session
    to the domain.  Like the NAS, the SIP proxy would\n   serve as client to a Diameter
    Server during the process of user\n   authentication, and upon successful authentication
    would receive back\n   from the Diameter Server AVPs indicating authorized QoS.
    \ Among these\n   might be the SIP-Resource-Priority AVP, the contents of which
    would\n   be compared with the contents of the Resource-Priority header field.\n
    \  Again, local policy would determine which namespaces to accept and\n   the
    effect of a given priority level on the admission decision.\n   For the sake of
    our example, suppose now that the SIP proxy signals\n   using RSVP to the border
    router that will be admitting the media\n   flows associated with the session.
    \ (This, of course, makes a few\n   assumptions on routing and knowledge of that
    routing at the proxy.)\n   The SIP proxy can indicate authorized QoS using various
    objects.  In\n   particular, it can map the values from the Resource-Priority
    header\n   field to the corresponding numeric values as defined by [RFC6401] and\n
    \  send it using the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element.\n"

    application.  We recommend the use of mechanisms to\n   ensure integrity when
    exchanging information from one protocol to an\n   associated DIAMETER AVP.  Examples
    of these integrity mechanisms\n   would be use of S/MIME with the SIP Resource
    Priority Header (RPH),\n   or an INTEGRITY object within a POLICY_DATA object
    within the context\n   of RSVP.  The consequences of changing values in the Priority
    AVPs\n   may result in an allocation of additional or less resources.\n   Changes
    in integrity-protected values SHOULD NOT be ignored, and\n   appropriate protocol-specific
    error messages SHOULD be sent back\n   upstream.  Note that we do not use the
    term \"MUST NOT be ignored\"\n   because the local policy of an administrative
    domain associated with\n   other protocols acts as the final arbiter.  In addition,
    some\n   protocols associated with the AVPs defined in this document may be\n
    \  deployed within a single administrative domain or \"walled garden\";\n   thus,

    authors also recommend that readers familiarize themselves with\n   the security
    considerations of the various protocols listed in the\n   Normative References.
