- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the\
    \ decision was\n   made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format\
    \ for\n   RFCs to XML as the canonical format [XML-ANNOUNCE].  The high-level\n\
    \   requirements that informed this change were defined in [RFC6949],\n   \"RFC\
    \ Series Format Requirements and Future Development\".  Plain text\n   remains\
    \ an important format for many in the IETF community, and it\n   will be one of\
    \ the publication formats rendered from the XML.  This\n   document outlines the\
    \ rendering requirements for the plain-text RFC\n   publication format.  These\
    \ requirements do not apply to plain-text\n   RFCs published before the format\
    \ transition.\n   The Unicode Consortium defines \"plain text\" as \"Computer-encoded\
    \ text\n   that consists only of a sequence of code points from a given\n   standard,\
    \ with no other formatting or structural information.\n   Plain-text interchange\
    \ is commonly used between computer systems that\n   do not share higher-level\
    \ protocols.\" [UNICODE-GLOSSARY].  In other\n   words, plain-text files cannot\
    \ include embedded character formatting\n   or style information.  The actual\
    \ character encoding, however, is not\n   limited to any particular sequence of\
    \ code points.\n   A plain-text output for RFCs will continue to be required for\
    \ the\n   foreseeable future.  The process of converting xml2rfc version 2\n \
    \  (xml2rfc v2) into text documents is well understood [RFC7749].  We\n   plan\
    \ to rely on the practice to date to inform the requirements for\n   converting\
    \ xml2rfc version 3 (xml2rfc v3) to text [RFC7991].  This\n   document calls out\
    \ those requirements that are changed from v2 or\n   otherwise deserve special\
    \ attention, such as the requirements around\n   the character encoding that may\
    \ be used; changes in the page layout;\n   and changes in how figures, artwork,\
    \ and pagination may be handled.\n   For more details on general style, see \"\
    RFC Style Guide\" [RFC7322].\n   The following assumptions drive the changes in\
    \ the plain-text output\n   for RFCs:\n   o  The existing tools used by the RFC\
    \ Editor and many members of the\n      author community to create the text file\
    \ are complicated to change\n      and support; manual manipulation is often required\
    \ for the final\n      output.  In particular, handling page breaks and associated\
    \ widows\n      and orphans for paginated output is tricky [WIDOWS].\n   o  Additional\
    \ publication formats -- for example, PDF, HTML -- will\n      be available that\
    \ will offer features such as markup and pretty\n      printing.\n   o  There\
    \ is an extensive tool chain in existence among the community\n      to work with\
    \ plain-text documents.  Similar functionality may be\n      possible with other\
    \ publication formats, but the workflow that\n      uses the existing tool chain\
    \ should be supported as much as is\n      considered practical.\n   Where practical,\
    \ the original guidance for the structure of a\n   plain-text RFC has been kept\
    \ (e.g., with line lengths, with lines\n   per page [INS2AUTH]).  Other publication\
    \ formats, such as HTML and\n   PDF, will include additional features that will\
    \ not be present in the\n   plain text (e.g., paragraph numbering, typographical\
    \ emphasis).\n   The details described in this document are expected to change\
    \ based\n   on experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets.\n\
    \   Revised documents will be published capturing those changes as the\n   toolsets\
    \ are completed.  Other implementers must not expect those\n   changes to remain\
    \ backwards-compatible with the details described in\n   this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Character Encoding
  contents:
  - "2.  Character Encoding\n   Plain-text files for RFCs will use the UTF-8 [RFC3629]\
    \ character\n   encoding.  That said, the use of non-ASCII characters will be\
    \ only\n   allowed in a limited and controlled fashion.\n   Many elements within\
    \ the xml2rfc v3 vocabulary have an attribute for\n   the ASCII equivalent to\
    \ a non-ASCII character string.  The ASCII\n   equivalent will be rendered within\
    \ the plain text as per the guidance\n   in \"The Use of Non-ASCII Characters\
    \ in RFCs\" [RFC7997]; please view\n   the PDF version of that document.\n   The\
    \ plain-text file will include a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to provide\n   text reader\
    \ software with in-band information about the character\n   encoding scheme used.\n"
- title: 3.  Figures and Artwork
  contents:
  - "3.  Figures and Artwork\n   Artwork, such as network diagrams or performance\
    \ graphs, must be\n   tagged by the XML <artwork> element (see Section 2.5 of\
    \ \"The\n   'xml2rfc' Version 3 Vocabulary\" [RFC7991].  Where this artwork is\n\
    \   comprised of an ASCII art diagram, it must be tagged as\n   \"type='ascii-art'\"\
    .  The plain-text format will only include\n   ASCII art.  If the canonical format\
    \ includes figures or artwork other\n   than ASCII art, then the plain-text output\
    \ must include a pointer to\n   the relevant figure in the HTML version of the\
    \ RFC to allow readers\n   to see the relevant artwork.\n   Authors who wish to\
    \ include ASCII art for the plain-text file and\n   SVG art for the other outputs\
    \ may do so, but they should be aware of\n   the potential for confusion to individuals\
    \ reading the RFC with two\n   unique diagrams describing the same content.  If\
    \ there is conflicting\n   information between the publication formats, please\
    \ review the XML\n   and PDF files to resolve the conflict.\n"
- title: 4.  General Page Format Layout
  contents:
  - "4.  General Page Format Layout\n   One plain-text output will be created during\
    \ the publication process\n   with basic pagination that includes a form feed\
    \ instruction every\n   58 lines at most, including blank lines.  Instructions\
    \ or a script\n   will be made available by and for the community to strip out\n\
    \   pagination as per individual preference.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Headers and Footers
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Headers and Footers\n   The front matter on the front page (such as the\
    \ RFC number and\n   category) and the back matter on the last page (the authors'\
    \ full\n   names and contact information) will continue with the structure\n \
    \  described in RFC 7841 [RFC7841], \"RFC Streams, Headers, and\n   Boilerplates\"\
    .  Running headers and footers will no longer be added.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Table of Contents
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Table of Contents\n   In order to retain similar content wherever possible\
    \ between the\n   various publication formats, the table of contents will list\
    \ section\n   and subsection numbers and titles but will not include page numbers.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Line Width
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Line Width\n   Each line must be limited to 72 characters followed by the\
    \ character\n   sequence that denotes an end-of-line (EOL).  The EOL sequence\
    \ used by\n   the RFC Editor will be the two-character sequence CR LF (Carriage\n\
    \   Return followed by Line Feed).  This limit includes any left-side\n   indentation.\n\
    \   Note that the EOL used by the RFC Editor may change with different\n   transports\
    \ and as displayed in different display software.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Line Spacing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Line Spacing\n   Use single-spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank\
    \ line between\n   paragraphs.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Hyphenation
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Hyphenation\n   Hyphenated words (e.g., \"Internet-Draft\") should not\
    \ be split across\n   successive lines.\n"
- title: 5.  Elements from the xml2rfc v3 Vocabulary
  contents:
  - "5.  Elements from the xml2rfc v3 Vocabulary\n   The plain-text formatter uses\
    \ the relevant tags from the xml2rfc v3\n   source file to build a document conforming\
    \ to the layout and\n   structure described by the full RFC Style Guide [RFC7322]\
    \ (including\n   the updates in the web portion of the Style Guide) [STYLEWEB].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The requirements of the plain-text format involve\
    \ no significant\n   security considerations.  As part of the larger format project,\n\
    \   however, unintended changes to the text as a result of the\n   transformation\
    \ from the base XML file could in turn corrupt a\n   standard, practice, or critical\
    \ piece of information about a\n   protocol.\n"
