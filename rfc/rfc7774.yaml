  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
    (MPL)\n   [RFC7731] defines a protocol to make a multicast network among\n   low-power
    and lossy networks, e.g., wireless mesh networks.  MPL has\n   a set of parameters
    to control an MPL Domain.  The parameters control\n   the trade-off between end-to-end
    delay and network utilization.  In\n   most environments, the default parameters
    are acceptable.  However,\n   in some environments, the parameter set must be
    configured carefully\n   in order to meet the requirements of each environment.
    \ According to\n   Section 5.4 of [RFC7731], each parameter in the set should
    be the\n   same for all nodes within an MPL Domain, but [RFC7731] does not\n   define
    a method to configure the MPL parameter set.\n   Some managed wireless mesh networks
    may have a DHCP server to\n   configure network parameters.  MPL parameter sets
    shall be considered\n   as a part of network parameters (nodes in an MPL Domain
    should use an\n   identical parameter set).  A parameter set is required to configure\n
    \  an MPL Domain.\n   This document defines a way to distribute parameter sets
    for MPL\n   Forwarders via a new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option.  This document is\n
    \  intended to follow the guidelines provided in [RFC7227].\n   The key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

      Configuration\n   Options.  For example, if TUNIT is 20 and the minimum Data
      Message\n   interval (DATA_MESSAGE_IMIN) is 1000 ms, then DM_IMIN shall be set\n
      \  to 50.\n   For the maximum interval size (*_IMAX), [RFC6206] defines them
      as\n   follows:\n      The maximum interval size, Imax, is described as a number
      of\n      doublings of the minimum interval size (the base-2 log(max/min)).\n
      \     For example, a protocol might define Imax as 16.  If the minimum\n      interval
      is 100 ms, then the amount of time specified by Imax is\n      100 ms * 65,536,
      i.e., 6,553.6 seconds or approximately\n      109 minutes.\n   Because the minimum
      interval size in MPL Parameter Configuration\n   Options is described in TUNIT-millisecond
      precision, the\n   corresponding maximum interval size is also in TUNIT-millisecond\n
      \  precision.  For example, if TUNIT is 10 and C_IMIN is 50, the minimum\n   interval
      size of the Trickle timer for Control Messages is 500 ms.\n   In this case,
      the maximum interval size of the Trickle timer is\n   32 seconds (500 ms * 2^6)
      if C_IMAX is 6.\n"

      and\n   22.7 of [RFC3315].  As a convenience to the reader, we mention here\n

      \  from a server within T2 [RFC3315] of the last valid DHCPv6 message\n   sent
      from the server (if stateful) or twice the information refresh\n   time [RFC4242]
      (if stateless), it MUST suspend the MPL Forwarders of\n   the MPL Domains configured
      by the option.  MPL Forwarders configured\n   by other methods (e.g., via a
      static configuration file) MUST NOT be\n   suspended.\n   Clients MUST ignore

      contain any invalid values (e.g.,\n   reserved all-0 or all-1 values are used
      in parameters).  In this\n   case, in the context of MPL the message is considered
      not received,\n   and the condition described in the previous paragraph applies.\n"
    title: 2.2.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  MPL Forwarder Behavior\n   If a DHCPv6 client requests and receives the
      MPL Parameter\n   Configuration Option, the node SHOULD join the MPL Domain
      given by\n   the option and act as an MPL Forwarder.  Note that there may be
      cases\n   in which a node may fail to join a domain (or domains) due to local\n
      \  resource constraints.  Each joining node SHOULD configure its MPL\n   Forwarder
      with the given parameter set for the MPL Domain.  Each MPL\n   Domain is defined
      by an MPL Domain Address given by an MPL Parameter\n   Configuration Option.
      \ As defined in Section 2 of [RFC7731], an MPL\n   Domain Address is an IPv6
      multicast address associated to a set of\n   MPL network interfaces in an MPL
      Domain.\n   The priority of MPL parameter configurations applied to an MPL Domain\n
      \  is as follows (high to low):\n   o  Specific MPL parameter configuration
      for the MPL Domain\n      (option_len = 32 bits).\n   o  Wildcard MPL parameter
      configuration (option_len = 16 bits).\n   o  Default configuration as described
      in [RFC7731].\n   Priorities of other configurations, such as manual configuration
      of a\n   node, are not defined in this document.\n   There MUST be no more than
      one MPL Parameter Configuration Option for\n   an MPL Domain or the wildcard.
      \ Thus, the order of DHCPv6 options in\n   the packet has no effect on precedence.\n
      \  A node MUST leave an MPL Domain if it receives updated and all-valid\n   MPL
      Parameter Configuration Options without a configuration for the\n   MPL Domain,
      unless it has an overriding manual configuration for the\n   MPL Domain.  In
      other words, if a node is configured to work as an\n   MPL Forwarder for an
      MPL Domain regardless of DHCPv6 options, the\n   node MAY stay in the MPL Domain
      even if it receives an MPL Parameter\n   Configuration Option without a configuration
      for the MPL Domain.\n   MPL parameters may be updated occasionally.  With stateful
      DHCPv6,\n   updates can be done when the renewal timer expires.  The information\n
      \  refresh time option [RFC4242] shall be used to keep each forwarder\n   updated.\n
      \  To reduce periodic update traffic, a node may try to use a very long\n   interval
      between updates.  In this case, Reconfigure messages may be\n   used to keep
      forwarder parameter sets synchronized.\n"

    - "2.6.  Operational Considerations\n   This document introduces the dynamic updating
      of MPL parameters.\n   Because the update process is not synchronized, nodes
      may have\n   inconsistent parameter sets.\n   [RFC6206], Section 6 describes
      various problems that occur if the\n   Trickle timers do not match between communicating
      nodes.  To keep the\n   timers synchronized, it is RECOMMENDED to not update
      the parameters\n   of an MPL Domain too often.  A reasonable update rate would
      be once\n   per expected information refresh time interval, such as T1 [RFC3315]\n
      \  or information refresh time as defined in [RFC4242].\n   Inconsistent parameter
      sets may reduce performance.  On the other\n   hand, this situation will work
      as long as both new and old parameter\n   sets are reasonable parameter sets
      for a given communication load.\n   Because motivations for parameter updates
      include updates of the\n   environment, node density, or communication load,
      operators of MPL\n   networks need to be aware of nodes that are not updated
      and make sure\n   that old and new parameter sets are reasonable for the expected\n

    and Section 12 of\n   [RFC7731] provide detailed discussions regarding security
    threats for\n   DHCPv6.\n   Note also that a forged MPL parameter configuration
    may cause\n   excessive Layer 2 broadcasting.  Implementations should set\n   reasonable
    bounds for each parameter -- for example, not setting\n   DM/C_K too high, not
    setting DM/C_IMIN too low.  These bounds may be\n   implementation dependent or
    may be derived from MAC/PHY\n   specifications.  DHCPv6 server and client implementations
    need to\n   take care in setting reasonable bounds for each parameter in order
    to\n   avoid overloading the network.\n   The DHCP server or the network itself
    should be trusted by some\n   means, such as DHCPv6 authentication as described
    in Section 21 of\n   [RFC3315].  However, Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL)
    network\n   environments often have fewer computing resources, and DHCPv6\n   authentication
    may not be available in these environments.  In such\n   cases, other methods
    to protect integrity between DHCPv6 servers and\n   clients should be applied
    to a ROLL network.  Some specifications\n   related to ROLL implementations, such
    as ZigBee IP [ZigBeeIP] and\n   [RFC5191], assume that joining nodes will be authenticated
    so that\n   all nodes in the network can be trusted.  To protect against attacks\n
    \  from outside of the network, DHCPv6 packets SHOULD be filtered on the\n   border
    router between the ROLL network and the Internet, except for\n   packets between
    the ROLL network and a remote DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6\n   relays configured to
    manage the network.\n"
