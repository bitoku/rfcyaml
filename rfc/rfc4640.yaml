  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] specifies mobility support based on\
    \ the\n   assumption that a mobile node (MN) has a trust relationship with an\n\
    \   entity called the home agent.  Once the home agent address has been\n   learned\
    \ (for example, via manual configuration, anycast discovery\n   mechanisms, or\
    \ DNS lookup), Mobile IPv6 signaling messages between\n   the mobile node and\
    \ the home agent are secured with IPsec or with the\n   authentication protocol,\
    \ as defined in [RFC4285].  The requirements\n   for this security architecture\
    \ are created with [RFC3775], and the\n   details of this procedure are described\
    \ in [RFC3776].\n   In [RFC3775], there is an implicit requirement that the MN\
    \ be\n   provisioned with enough information that will permit it to register\n\
    \   successfully with its home agent.  However, having this information\n   statically\
    \ provisioned creates practical deployment issues.\n   This document serves to\
    \ define the problem of bootstrapping.\n   Bootstrapping is defined as the process\
    \ of obtaining enough\n   information at the mobile node that it can successfully\
    \ register with\n   an appropriate home agent.\n   The requirements for bootstrapping\
    \ could consider various\n   scenarios/network deployment issues.  It is the basic\
    \ assumption of\n   this document that certain minimal parameters (seed information)\
    \ are\n   available to the mobile node to aid in bootstrapping.  The exact seed\n\
    \   information available differs depending on the deployment scenario.\n   This\
    \ document describes various deployment scenarios and provides a\n   set of minimal\
    \ parameters that are available in each deployment\n   scenario.\n   This document\
    \ stops short of suggesting the preferred solutions for\n   how the mobile node\
    \ should obtain information.  Such details will be\n   available from separate\
    \ documents.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview of the Problem
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview of the Problem\n   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] expects the mobile node\
    \ to have a static home\n   address, a home agent address (which can be derived\
    \ from an anycast\n   address), and a security association with a home agent (or\
    \ multiple\n   home agents).\n   This static provisioning of information has various\
    \ problems, as\n   discussed in Section 5.\n   The aim of this document is:\n\
    \   o  To define bootstrapping;\n   o  To identify sample deployment scenarios\
    \ where Mobile Internet\n      Protocol version 6 (MIPv6) will be deployed, taking\
    \ into account\n      the relationship between the subscriber and the service\
    \ provider;\n      and\n   o  To identify the minimal set of information required\
    \ on the Mobile\n      Node and in the network in order for the mobile node to\
    \ obtain\n      address and security credentials, to register with the home agent.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Bootstrapping
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Bootstrapping\n   Bootstrapping is defined as obtaining enough information\
    \ at the\n   mobile node that the mobile node can successfully register with an\n\
    \   appropriate home agent.  Specifically, this means obtaining the home\n   agent\
    \ address and home address, and for the mobile node and home\n   agent to authenticate\
    \ and mutually construct security credentials for\n   Mobile IPv6.\n   Typically,\
    \ bootstrapping happens when a mobile node does not have all\n   the information\
    \ it needs to set up the Mobile IPv6 service.  This\n   includes, but is not limited\
    \ to, situations in which the mobile node\n   does not having any information\
    \ when it boots up for the first time\n   (out of the box), or does not retain\
    \ any information during reboots.\n   Also, in certain scenarios, after the MN\
    \ bootstraps for the first\n   time (out of the box), the need for subsequent\
    \ bootstrapping is\n   implementation dependent.  For instance, the MN may bootstrap\
    \ every\n   time it boots, bootstrap every time on prefix change, or bootstrap\n\
    \   periodically to anchor to an optimal HA (based on distance, load,\n   etc.).\n"
- title: 1.3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Terminology\n   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].\
    \  The\n   following additional terms are used here:\n   Trust relationship\n\
    \      In the context of this document, trust relationship means that the\n  \
    \    two parties in question, typically the user of the mobile host and\n    \
    \  the mobility or access service authorizer, have some sort of prior\n      contact\
    \ in which the mobile node was provisioned with credentials.\n      These credentials\
    \ allow the mobile node to authenticate itself to\n      the mobility or access\
    \ service provider and to prove its\n      authorization to obtain service.\n\
    \   Infrastructureless relationship\n      In the context of this document, an\
    \ infrastructureless\n      relationship is one in which the user of the mobile\
    \ node and the\n      mobility or access service provider have no previous contact\
    \ and\n      the mobile node is not required to supply credentials to\n      authenticate\
    \ and prove authorization for service.  Mobility and/or\n      network access\
    \ service is provided without any authentication or\n      authorization.  Infrastructureless\
    \ in this context does not mean\n      that there is no network infrastructure,\

    \    Data used by a mobile node to authenticate itself to a mobility or\n    \

    \ key pairs with certificates, and biometric\n      information are some examples.\n\
    \   ASA\n      Access Service Authorizer.  A network operator that authenticates\n\

- title: 2.  Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2.  Assumptions\n   o  A basic assumption in Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] is that there\
    \ is a\n      trust relationship between the mobile node and its home agent(s).\n\
    \      This trust relationship can be direct, or indirect through, for\n     \
    \ instance, an ASP that has a contract with the MSP.  This trust\n      relationship\
    \ can be used to bootstrap the MN.\n      One typical way of verifying the trust\
    \ relationship is using\n      authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)\n\
    \      infrastructure.  In this document, two distinct uses of AAA are\n     \
    \ considered:\n      AAA for Network Access\n         This functionality provides\
    \ authentication and authorization to\n         access the network (obtain address\
    \ and send/receive packets).\n      AAA for Mobility Service\n         This functionality\
    \ provides authentication and authorization\n         for mobility services.\n\
    \      These functionalities may be implemented in a single entity or in\n   \
    \   different entities, depending on the service models described in\n      Section\
    \ 6 or deployment scenarios as described in Section 7.\n   o  Some identifier,\
    \ such as an Network Access Identifier (NAI), as\n      defined in [RFC4283] or\
    \ [RFC2794], is provisioned on the MN that\n      permits the MN to identify itself\
    \ to the ASP and MSP.\n"
- title: 3.  Design Goals
  contents:
  - "3.  Design Goals\n   A solution to the bootstrapping problem has the following\
    \ design\n   goals:\n   o  The following information must be available at the\
    \ end of\n      bootstrapping, to enable the MN to register with the HA.\n   \
    \   *  MN's home agent address\n      *  MN's home address\n      *  IPsec Security\
    \ Association (SA) between MN and HA, Intenet Key\n         Exchange Protocol\
    \ (IKE) pre-shared secret between MN and HA\n   o  The bootstrapping procedure\
    \ can be triggered at any time, either\n      by the MN or by the network.  Bootstrapping\
    \ can occur, for\n      instance, due to administrative action, information going\
    \ stale,\n      or HA indicating the MN.  Bootstrapping may be initiated even\
    \ when\n      the MN is registered with the HA and has all the required\n    \
    \  credentials.  This may typically happen to refresh/renew the\n      credentials.\n\
    \   o  Subsequent protocol interaction (for example, updating the IPsec\n    \
    \  SA) can be executed between the MN and the HA itself without\n      involving\
    \ the infrastructure that was used during bootstrapping.\n   o  Solutions to the\
    \ bootstrapping problem should enable storage of\n      user-specific information\
    \ on entities other than the home agent.\n   o  Solutions to the bootstrapping\
    \ problem should not exclude storage\n      of user-specific information on entities\
    \ other than the home\n      agent.\n   o  Configuration information which is\
    \ exchanged between the mobile\n      node and the home agent must be secured\
    \ using integrity and replay\n      protection.  Confidentiality protection should\
    \ be provided if\n      necessary.\n   o  The solution should be applicable to\
    \ all feasible deployment\n      scenarios that can be envisaged, along with the\
    \ relevant\n      authentication/authorization models.\n"
- title: 4.  Non-goals
  contents:
  - "4.  Non-goals\n   This following issues are clearly outside the scope of bootstrapping:\n\
    \   o  Home prefix renumbering is not explicitly supported as part of\n      bootstrapping.\
    \  If the MN executes the bootstrap procedures every\n      time it powers on\
    \ (as opposed to caching state information from\n      previous bootstrap process),\
    \ then home network renumbering is\n      taken care of automatically.\n   o \
    \ Bootstrapping in the absence of a trust relationship between MN\n      and any\
    \ provider is not considered.\n"

- title: 5.1.1.  Dynamic Home Address Assignment
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Dynamic Home Address Assignment\n   Currently, the home agent uses the\
    \ mobile node's home address for\n   authorization.  When manual keying is used,\
    \ this happens through the\n   security policy database, which specifies that\
    \ a certain security\n   association may only be used for a specific home address.\
    \  When\n   dynamic keying is used, the home agent ensures that the IKE Phase\
    \ 1\n   identity is authorized to request security associations for the given\n\
    \   home address.  Mobile IPv6 uses IKEv1, which is unable to update the\n   security\
    \ policy database according to a dynamically assigned home\n   address.  As a\
    \ result, static home address assignment is really the\n   only home address configuration\
    \ technique compatible with the base\n   specification.\n   However, support for\
    \ dynamic home address assignment would be\n   desirable for the following reasons:\n\
    \   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)-based address assignment.\n   Some\
    \ providers may want to use DHCPv6 or other dynamic address\n   assignment (e.g.,\
    \ IKEv2) from the home network to configure home\n   addresses.\n   Recovery from\
    \ a duplicate address collision.  It may be necessary to\n   recover from a collision\
    \ of addresses on the home network by one of\n   the mobile nodes changing its\
    \ home address.\n   Addressing privacy.  It may be desirable to establish randomly\n\
    \   generated addresses as in [RFC3041] and use them for a short period\n   of\
    \ time.  Unfortunately, current protocols make it possible to use\n   such addresses\
    \ only from the visited network.  As a result, these\n   addresses cannot be used\
    \ for communications lasting longer than the\n   attachment to a particular visited\
    \ network.\n   Ease of deployment.  In order to simplify the deployment of Mobile\n\
    \   IPv6, it is desirable to free users and administrators from the task\n   of\
    \ allocating home addresses and specifying them in the security\n   policy database.\
    \  This is consistent with the general IPv6 design\n   goal of using autoconfiguration\
    \ wherever possible.\n   Prefix changes in the home network.  The Mobile IPv6\
    \ specification\n   contains support for a mobile node to autoconfigure a home\
    \ address as\n   based on its discovery of prefix information on the home subnet\n\
    \   [RFC3775].  Autoconfiguration in case of network renumbering is done\n   by\
    \ replacing the existing network prefix with the new network prefix.\n   Subsequently,\
    \ the MN needs to update the mobility binding in the HA\n   to register the newly\
    \ configured Home Address.  However, the MN may\n   not be able to register the\
    \ newly configured address with the HA if a\n   security association related to\

    \ have it statically\n   configured.  A more typical pattern for inter-domain\

    \   Certificates are not easily supported by traditional AAA\n   infrastructures.\
    \  Where a traditional AAA infrastructure is used, the\n   home agent is not able\

    \ the mobile node, the foreign AAA\n   server, and the home AAA server.  This\

    \   any propagation of prefix information.  As a practical matter, if\n   this\

- title: 6.  Network Access and Mobility Services
  contents:
  - "6.  Network Access and Mobility Services\n   This section defines some terms\
    \ as they pertain to authentication and\n   practical network deployment/roaming\
    \ scenarios.  This description\n   lays the groundwork for Section 7.  The focus\
    \ is on the 'service'\n   model since, ultimately, it is the provider providing\
    \ the service\n   that wants to authenticate the mobile (and vice versa for mutual\n\
    \   authentication between provider and the user of the service).\n   Network\
    \ access service enables a host to send and receive IP packets\n   on the Internet\
    \ or an intranet.  IP address configuration and IP\n   packet forwarding capabilities\
    \ are required to deliver this service.\n   A network operator providing this\
    \ service is called an access service\n   provider (ASP).  An ASP can, for example,\
    \ be a commercial ASP, the IT\n   department of an enterprise network, or the\
    \ maintainer of a home\n   (residential) network.\n   If the mobile node is not\
    \ directly usable for communication at the\n   current location of the MN in which\
    \ network access service is\n   provided by its home ASP, the mobile node is roaming.\
    \  In this case,\n   the home ASP acts as the access service authorizer, but the\
    \ actual\n   network access is provided by the serving network access provider.\n\
    \   During the authentication and authorization prior to the mobile nodes\n  \
    \ having Internet access, the serving network access provider may\n   simply act\
    \ as a routing agent for authentication and authorization\n   back to the access\
    \ service authorizer, or it may require an\n   additional authentication and authorization\
    \ step itself.  An example\n   of a roaming situation is when a business person\
    \ is using a hotspot\n   service in an airport and the hotspot service provider\
    \ has a roaming\n   agreement with the business person's cellular provider.  In\
    \ that\n   case, the hotspot network is acting as the serving network access\n\
    \   provider, and the cellular network is acting as the access service\n   authorizer.\
    \  When the business person moves from the hotspot network\n   to the cellular\
    \ network, the cellular network is both the home access\n   service provider and\
    \ the access service authorizer.\n   Mobility service using Mobile IPv6 is conceptually\
    \ and possibly also\n   in practice separate from network access service, though\
    \ of course\n   network access is required prior to providing mobility.  Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   service enables an IPv6 host to maintain its reachability despite\n\
    \   changing its network attachment point (subnets).  A network operator\n   providing\
    \ Mobile IPv6 service is called a mobility service provider\n   (MSP).  Granting\
    \ Mobile IPv6 service requires that a host\n   authenticate and prove authorization\
    \ for the service.  A network\n   operator that authenticates a mobile node and\
    \ authorizes mobility\n   service is called a mobility service authorizer (MSA).\
    \  If both types\n   of operation are performed by the same operator, that operator\
    \ is\n   called a home mobility service provider.  If authentication and\n   authorization\
    \ is provided by one operator and the actual service is\n   provided by another,\
    \ the operator providing the service is called the\n   serving mobility service\
    \ provider.  The serving MSP must contact the\n   mobile node's mobility service\
    \ authorizer to check the mobile node's\n   authorization prior to granting mobility\
    \ service.\n   The service model defined here clearly separates the entity providing\n\
    \   the service from the entity that authenticates and authorizes the\n   service.\
    \  In the case of basic network access, this supports the\n   traditional and\
    \ well-known roaming model, in which inter-operator\n   roaming agreements allow\
    \ a host to obtain network access in areas\n   where their home network access\
    \ provider does not have coverage.  In\n   the case of mobility service, this\
    \ allows a roaming mobile node to\n   obtain mobility service in the local operator's\
    \ network while having\n   that service authorized by the home operator.  The\
    \ service model also\n   allows mobility service and network access service to\
    \ be provided by\n   different entities.  This allows a network operator with\
    \ no wireless\n   access, such as, for example, an enterprise network operator,\
    \ to\n   deploy a Mobile IPv6 home agent for mobility service while the actual\n\
    \   wireless network access is provided by the serving network access\n   providers\
    \ with which the enterprise operator has a contract.  Here\n   are some other\
    \ possible combinations of ASPs and MSPs:\n   o  The serving ASP might be the\
    \ home ASP.  Similarly, the serving MSP\n      might be the home MSP.\n   o  The\
    \ home ASP and the home MSP may be the same operator, or not.\n      When they\
    \ are the same, the same set of credentials may be used\n      for both services.\n\
    \   o  The serving ASP and the serving MSP may be the same operator, or\n    \
    \  not.\n   o  It is possible that serving ASP and home MSP are the same\n   \
    \   operator.\n   Similarly the home ASP and serving MSP may be the same.  Also,\
    \ the\n   ASA and MSA may be the same.\n   These entities and all combinations\
    \ that are reasonable from a\n   deployment perspective must be taken into consideration\
    \ to solve the\n   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem.  They impact home agent\
    \ discovery,\n   home address configuration, and mobile node-to-home agent\n \
    \  authentication aspects.\n"

    \ scenarios.  The\n   various combinations of service providers described in Section\
    \ 6 are\n   considered.\n   For each scenario, the underlying assumptions are\
    \ described.  The\n   basic assumption is that there is a trust relationship between\
    \ mobile\n   user and the MSA.  Typically, this trust relationship is between\
    \ the\n   mobile user and AAA in the MSA's network.  Seed information needed to\n\
    \   bootstrap the mobile node is considered in two cases:\n   o  AAA authentication\
    \ is mandatory for network access.\n   o  AAA authentication is not part of network\
    \ access.\n   The seed information is described further in Section 8.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Mobility Service Subscription Scenario
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Mobility Service Subscription Scenario\n   Many commercial deployments\
    \ are based on the assumption that mobile\n   nodes have a subscription with a\
    \ service provider.  In this scenario\n   the MN has a subscription with an MSA,\
    \ also called the home MSP, for\n   Mobile IPv6 service.  As stated in Section\
    \ 6, the MSP is responsible\n   for setting up a home agent on a subnet that acts\
    \ as a Mobile IPv6\n   home link.  As a consequence, the home MSP should explicitly\n\
    \   authorize and control the whole bootstrapping procedure.\n   Since the MN\
    \ is assumed to have a pre-established trust relationship\n   with its home provider,\
    \ it must be configured with an identity and\n   credentials; for instance, an\
    \ NAI and a shared secret by some out-\n   of-band means (i.e., manual configuration)\
    \ before bootstrapping.\n   In order to guarantee ubiquitous service, the MN should\
    \ be able to\n   bootstrap MIPv6 operations with its home MSP from any possible\
    \ access\n   location, such as an open network or a network managed by an ASP,\n\

  - "8.  Parameters for Authentication\n   The following is a list of parameters that\
    \ are used as the seed for\n   the bootstrapping procedure.  The parameters vary\
    \ depending on\n   whether authentication for network access is independent of\n\
    \   authentication for mobility services.  If different client identities\n  \
    \ are used for network access and mobility services, authentication for\n   network\
    \ access is independent of authentication for mobility\n   services.\n   o  Parameter\
    \ Set 1\n      In this case, authentication for network access is independent\
    \ of\n      authentication for mobility services.\n      If the home agent address\
    \ is not known to the mobile node, the\n      following parameter is needed for\
    \ discovering the home agent\n      address:\n      *  The domain name or Fully\
    \ Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the\n         home agent\n      This parameter\
    \ may be derived in various ways, such as (but not\n      limited to) static configuration,\
    \ use of the domain name from the\n      network access NAI (even if AAA for network\
    \ access is not\n      otherwise used), or use of the domain name of the serving\
    \ ASP,\n      where the domain name may be obtained via DHCP in the serving ASP.\n\
    \      If the home agent address is not known but the home subnet prefix\n   \
    \   is known, Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery of Mobile IPv6 may\n      be\
    \ used for discovering the home agent address, and the above\n      parameter\
    \ may not be used.\n      When the home agent address is known to the mobile node,\
    \ the\n      following parameter is needed for performing mutual authentication\n\
    \      between the mobile node and the home agent by using IKE:\n      *  IKE\
    \ credentials (*)\n      In the case where the home agent does not have the entire\
    \ set of\n      IKE credentials, the home agent may communicate with another\n\
    \      entity (for example, an AAA server) to perform mutual\n      authentication\
    \ in IKE.  In such a case, the IKE credentials\n      include the credentials\
    \ used between the mobile node and the other\n      entity.  In the case where\
    \ an AAA protocol is used for the\n      communication between the home agent\
    \ and the other entity during\n      the IKE procedure, AAA for Mobile IPv6 service\
    \ may be involved in\n      IKE.  If the authentication protocol [RFC4285] is\
    \ used, the shared\n      key-based security association with the home agent is\
    \ needed.\n   o  Parameter Set 2\n      In this case, some dependency exists between\
    \ authentication for\n      network access and authentication for mobility services\
    \ in that a\n      security association that is established as a result of\n \
    \     authentication for network access is re-used for authentication\n      for\
    \ mobility services.\n      All required information, including IKE credentials,\
    \ is\n      bootstrapped from the following parameter:\n      *  Network access\
    \ credentials(*)\n   (*) A pair of an NAI and a pre-shared secret is an example\
    \ of a set\n   of credentials.  A pair of an NAI and a public key, which may be\n\
    \   provided as a digital certificate, is another example of a set of\n   credentials.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are two aspects of security for the Mobile\

    \ if the bootstrapping process is\n   compromised, the level of security required\
    \ by RFC 3775 may not be\n   achieved.\n   The following two sections discuss\
    \ these issues.\n"
- title: 9.1.  Security Requirements of Mobile IPv6
  contents:
  - "9.1.  Security Requirements of Mobile IPv6\n   The Mobile IPv6 specification\
    \ in RFC 3775 requires the establishment\n   of a collection of IPsec SAs between\
    \ the home agent and mobile node\n   to secure the signaling traffic for Mobile\
    \ IP, and, optionally, also\n   to secure data traffic.  The security of an IPsec\
    \ SA required by the\n   relevant IPsec RFCs must be quite strong.  Provisioning\
    \ of keys and\n   other cryptographic material during the establishment of the\
    \ SA\n   through bootstrapping must be done in a manner such that authenticity\n\
    \   is proved and confidentiality is ensured.  In addition, the\n   generation\
    \ of any keying material or other cryptographic material for\n   the SA must be\
    \ done in a way such that the probability of compromise\n   after the SA is in\
    \ place is minimized.  The best way to minimize the\n   probability of such a\
    \ compromise is to have the cryptographic\n   material only known or calculable\
    \ by the two end nodes that share the\n   SA -- in this case, the home agent and\
    \ mobile node.  If other parties\n   are involved in establishing the SA (through\
    \ key distribution, for\n   example) the process should follow the constraints\
    \ designed to\n   provide equivalent security.\n   RFC 3775 also requires a trust\
    \ relationship, as defined in Section\n   1.3, between the mobile node and its\
    \ home agent(s).  This is\n   necessary, for instance, to ensure that fraudulent\
    \ mobile nodes that\n   attempt to flood other mobile nodes with traffic be not\
    \ only shut off\n   but tracked down.  An infrastructureless relationship as defined\
    \ in\n   Section 1.3 does not satisfy this requirement.  Any bootstrapping\n \
    \  solution must include a trust relationship between mobile node and\n   mobility\
    \ service provider.  Solutions that depend on an\n   infrastructureless relationship\
    \ are out of scope for bootstrapping.\n   Another requirement is that a home address\
    \ be authorized to one\n   specific host at a time.  RFC 3775 requires this so\
    \ that misbehaving\n   mobile nodes can be shut down.  This implies that, in addition\
    \ to the\n   IPsec SA, the home agent must somehow authorize the mobile node for\
    \ a\n   home address.  The authorization can be either implicit (for example,\n\
    \   as a side effect of the authentication for mobility service) or\n   explicit.\
    \  The authorization can either be done at the time the SA is\n   created or be\
    \ dynamically managed through a first come, first served\n   allocation policy.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Threats to the Bootstrapping Process
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Threats to the Bootstrapping Process\n   Various attacks are possible on\
    \ the bootstrapping process itself.\n   These attacks can compromise the process\
    \ such that the RFC 3775\n   requirements for Mobile IP security are not met,\
    \ or they can serve\n   simply to disrupt the process such that bootstrapping\
    \ cannot be\n   completed.  Here are some possible attacks:\n   o  An attacking\
    \ network entity purporting to offer the mobile node a\n      legitimate home\
    \ agent address or bootstrapping for the IPsec SAs\n      may instead offer a\
    \ bogus home agent address or configure bogus\n      SAs that allow the home agent\
    \ to steal the mobile node's traffic\n      or otherwise disrupt the mobile node's\
    \ mobility service.\n   o  An attacking mobile node may attempt to steal mobility\
    \ service by\n      offering up fake credentials to a bootstrapping network entity\
    \ or\n      otherwise disrupting the home agent's ability to offer mobility\n\
    \      service.\n   o  A man in the middle on the link between the mobile node\
    \ and the\n      bootstrapping network entity could steal credentials or other\n\
    \      sensitive information and use that to steal mobility service or\n     \
    \ deny it to the legitimate owner of the credentials.  Refer to\n      Section\
    \ 7.15 in [RFC3748] and [AAA-EAP-LLA] for further\n      information.\n   o  An\
    \ attacker could arrange for a distributed denial-of-service\n      attack on\
    \ the bootstrapping entity, to disrupt legitimate users\n      from bootstrapping.\n\
    \   In addition to these attacks, there are other considerations that are\n  \
    \ important in achieving a good security design.  As mobility and\n   network\
    \ access authentication are separate services, keys generated\n   for these services\
    \ need to be cryptographically separate, to be\n   separately named, and to have\
    \ separate lifetimes.  This needs to be\n   achieved even though the keys are\
    \ generated from the same\n   authentication credentials.  This is necessary because\
    \ a mobile node\n   must be able to move from one serving (or roaming) network\
    \ access\n   provider to another without needing to change its mobility access\n\
    \   provider.  Finally, basic cryptographic processes must provide for\n   multiple\
    \ algorithms in order to accommodate the widely varying\n   deployment needs;\
    \ the need for replacement of algorithms when attacks\n   become possible must\
    \ also be considered in the design.\n"
