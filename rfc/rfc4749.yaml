- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   G.729.1 is an 8-32 kbps scalable wideband (50-7000 Hz) speech\
    \ and\n   audio coding algorithm interoperable with G.729, G.729 Annex A, and\n\
    \   G.729 Annex B.  It provides a standardized solution for packetized\n   voice\
    \ applications that allows a smooth transition from narrowband to\n   wideband\
    \ telephony.\n   The most important services addressed are IP telephony and\n\
    \   videoconferencing, either for enterprise corporate networks or for\n   mass\
    \ market (like Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) emulation\n   over DSL\
    \ or wireless access).  Target devices can be IP phones or\n   other VoIP handsets,\
    \ home gateways, media gateways, IP Private Branch\n   Exchange (IPBX), trunking\
    \ equipment, voice messaging servers, etc.\n   For all those applications, the\
    \ scalability feature allows tuning the\n   bit rate versus quality trade-off,\
    \ possibly in a dynamic way during a\n   session, taking into account service\
    \ requirements and network\n   transport constraints.\n   The G.729.1 coder produces\
    \ an embedded bitstream structured in 12\n   layers corresponding to 12 available\
    \ bit rates between 8 and 32 kbps.\n   The first layer, at 8 kbps, is called the\
    \ core layer and is bitstream\n   compatible with the ITU-T G.729/G.729A coder.\
    \  At 12 kbps, a second\n   layer improves the narrowband quality.  Upper layers\
    \ provide wideband\n   audio (50-7000 Hz) between 14 and 32 kbps, with a 2 kbps\
    \ granularity\n   allowing graceful quality improvements.  Only the core layer\
    \ is\n   mandatory to decode understandable speech; upper layers provide\n   quality\
    \ enhancement and wideband enlargement.\n   The codec operates on 20-ms frames,\
    \ and the default sampling rate is\n   16 kHz.  Input and output at 8 kHz are\
    \ also supported, at all bit\n   rates.\n"
- title: 3.  Embedded Bit Rates Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Embedded Bit Rates Considerations\n   The embedded property of G.729.1 streams\
    \ provides a mechanism to\n   adjust the bandwidth demand.  At any time, a sender\
    \ can change its\n   sending bit rate without external signalling, and the receiver\
    \ will\n   be able to properly decode the frames.  It may help to control\n  \
    \ congestion, since the bandwidth can be adjusted by selecting another\n   bit\
    \ rate.\n   The ability to adjust the bandwidth may also help when having a fixed\n\
    \   bandwidth link dedicated to voice calls, for example in a residential\n  \
    \ or trunking gateway.  In that case, the system can change the bit\n   rates\
    \ depending on the number of simultaneous calls.  This will only\n   impact the\
    \ sending bandwidth.  In order to adjust the receiving\n   bandwidth as well,\
    \ we introduce an in-band signalling to request the\n   other party to change\
    \ its own sending bit rate.  This in-band request\n   is called MBS, for Maximum\
    \ Bit rate Supported.  It is described in\n   Section 5.2.  Note that it is only\
    \ useful for two-way unicast G.729.1\n   traffic, because when A sends an in-band\
    \ MBS to B in order to request\n   that B modify its sending bit rate, it concerns\
    \ the stream from B to\n   A.  If there is no G.729.1 stream in the reverse direction,\
    \ the MBS\n   will have no effect.\n"
- title: 4.  RTP Header Usage
  contents:
  - "4.  RTP Header Usage\n   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550\
    \ [3].  This\n   payload format uses the fields of the header in a manner consistent\n\
    \   with that specification.\n   The RTP timestamp clock frequency is the same\
    \ as the default sampling\n   frequency: 16 kHz.\n   G.729.1 has also the capability\
    \ to operate with 8 kHz sampled input/\n   output signals at all bit rates.  It\
    \ does not affect the bitstream,\n   and the decoder does not require a priori\
    \ knowledge about the\n   sampling rate of the original signal at the input of\
    \ the encoder.\n   Therefore, depending on the implementation and the audio acoustic\n\
    \   capabilities of the devices, the input of the encoder and/or the\n   output\
    \ of the decoder can be configured at 8 kHz; however, a 16 kHz\n   RTP clock rate\
    \ MUST always be used.\n   The duration of one frame is 20 ms, corresponding to\
    \ 320 samples at\n   16 kHz.  Thus the timestamp is increased by 320 for each\
    \ consecutive\n   frame.\n   The M bit MUST be set to zero in all packets.\n \
    \  The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is\n   outside\
    \ the scope of the document, and will not be specified here.\n   It is expected\
    \ that the RTP profile under which this payload format\n   is being used will\
    \ assign a payload type for this codec or specify\n   that the payload type is\
    \ to be bound dynamically (see Section 6.2).\n"

    \ parties.\n      Below is an example of such an offer:\n         m=audio 55954\
    \ RTP/AVP 98 18\n         a=rtpmap:98 G7291/16000\n         a=rtpmap:18 G729/8000\n\
    \      If the answerer supports G.729.1, it will keep the payload type 98\n  \
    \    in its answer, and the conversation will be done using G.729.1.\n      Else,\
    \ if the answerer supports only G.729, it will leave only the\n      payload type\
    \ 18 in its answer, and the conversation will be done\n      using G.729 (the\
    \ payload format for G.729 is defined in Section\n      4.5.6 of RFC 3551 [4]).\n\
    \      Note that when used at 8 kbps in G.729-compatible mode, the\n      G.729.1\
    \ decoder supports G.729 Annex B.  Therefore, Annex B can be\n      advertised\
    \ (by default, annexb=yes for G729 media type; see\n      Section 4.1.9 of RFC\
    \ 3555 [7]).\n   o  The \"maxbitrate\" parameter is bi-directional.  If the offerer\
    \ sets\n      a maxbitrate value, the answerer MUST reply with a smaller or\n\
    \      equal value.  The actual maximum bit rate for the session will be\n   \
    \   the minimum.\n   o  If the received value for \"maxbitrate\" is between 8000\
    \ and 32000\n      but not in the permissible values set, it SHOULD be read as\
    \ the\n      closest lower valid value.  If the received value is lower than\n\
    \      8000 or greater than 32000, the session MUST be rejected.\n   o  The \"\
    mbs\" parameter is not symmetric.  Values in the offer and the\n      answer are\
    \ independent and take into account local constraints.\n      One party MUST NOT\
    \ start sending frames at a bit rate higher than\n      the \"mbs\" of the other\
    \ party.  The parameter allows announcing\n      this value, prior to the sending\
    \ of any packet, to prevent the\n      remote sender from exceeding the MBS at\
    \ the beginning of the\n      session.\n   o  If the received value for \"mbs\"\
    \ is greater or equal to 8000 but\n      not in the permissible values set, it\
    \ SHOULD be read as the\n      closest lower valid value.  If the received value\
    \ is lower than\n      8000, the session MUST be rejected.\n   o  The parameters\
    \ \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" will in most cases not\n      affect interoperability.\
    \  The SDP offer-answer handling of the\n      \"ptime\" parameter is described\
    \ in RFC 3264 [8].  The \"maxptime\"\n      parameter MUST be handled in the same\
    \ way.\n   o  Any unknown parameter in an offer MUST be ignored by the receiver\n\
    \      and MUST NOT be included in the answer.\n   Some special rules apply for\
    \ mono-directional traffic:\n   o  For sendonly streams, the \"mbs\" parameter\
    \ is useless and SHOULD\n      NOT be used.\n   o  For recvonly streams, the \"\
    mbs\" parameter is the only way to\n      communicate the MBS to the sender, since\
    \ there is no RTP stream\n      towards it.  So to request a bit rate change,\
    \ the receiver will\n      need to use an out-of-band mechanism, like a SIP RE-INVITE.\n\
    \   Some special rules apply for multicast:\n   o  The \"mbs\" parameter MUST\
    \ NOT be used.\n   o  The \"maxbitrate\" parameter becomes declarative and MUST\
    \ NOT be\n      negotiated.  This parameter is fixed, and a participant MUST use\n\
    \      the configuration that is provided for the session.\n"

  - "7.  Congestion Control\n   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance\
    \ with RFC 3550\n   [3] and any appropriate profile (for example, RFC 3551 [4]).\
    \  The\n   embedded and variable bit rates capability of G.729.1 provides a\n\
    \   mechanism that may help to control congestion; see Section 3 for more\n  \
    \ details.\n   The number of frames encapsulated in each RTP payload influences\
    \ the\n   overall bandwidth of the RTP stream, due to the header overhead.\n \
    \  Packing more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the number of\n   packets\
    \ sent and hence the header overhead, at the expense of\n   increased delay and\
    \ reduced error robustness.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined\
    \ in this specification\n   are subject to the general security considerations\
    \ discussed in the\n   RTP specification [3] and any appropriate profile (for\
    \ example, RFC\n   3551 [4]).\n   As this format transports encoded speech/audio,\
    \ the main security\n   issues include confidentiality, integrity protection,\
    \ and\n   authentication of the speech/audio itself.  The payload format itself\n\
    \   does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  Any suitable\n   external\
    \ mechanisms, such as SRTP [12], MAY be used.\n   This payload format and the\
    \ G.729.1 encoding do not exhibit any\n   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-end\
    \ computational load and\n   thus are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat\
    \ due to the\n   receipt of pathological datagrams.\n"
