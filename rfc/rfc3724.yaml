  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the key architectural guidelines of the Internet\
    \ is the end-\n   to-end principle in the papers by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark [1][2].\n\
    \   The end-to-end principle was originally articulated as a question of\n   where\
    \ best not to put functions in a communication system.  Yet, in\n   the ensuing\
    \ years, it has evolved to address concerns of maintaining\n   openness, increasing\
    \ reliability and robustness, and preserving the\n   properties of user choice\
    \ and ease of new service development as\n   discussed by Blumenthal and Clark\
    \ in [3]; concerns that were not part\n   of the original articulation of the\
    \ end-to-end principle.\n   In this document, we examine how the interpretation\
    \ of the end-to-end\n   principle has evolved over the years, and where it stands\
    \ currently.\n   We examine trends in the development of the Internet that have\
    \ led to\n   pressure to define services in the network, a topic that has already\n\
    \   received some amount of attention from the IAB in RFC 3238 [5].  We\n   describe\

  - "2.1.  In the Beginning...\n   The end-to-end principle was originally articulated\
    \ as a question of\n   where best to put functions in a communication system:\n\
    \      The function in question can completely and correctly be\n      implemented\
    \ only with the knowledge and help of the application\n      standing at the end\
    \ points of the communication system.\n      Therefore, providing that questioned\
    \ function as a feature of the\n      communication system itself is not possible.\
    \  (Sometimes an\n      incomplete version of the function provided by the communication\n\
    \      system may be useful as a performance enhancement.) [1].\n   A specific\
    \ example of such a function is delivery guarantees [1].\n   The original ARPANET\
    \ returned a message \"Request for Next Message\"\n   whenever it delivered a\
    \ packet.  Although this message was found to\n   be useful within the network\
    \ as a form of congestion control, since\n   the ARPANET refused to accept another\
    \ message to the same destination\n   until the previous acknowledgment was returned,\
    \ it was never\n   particularly useful as an indication of guaranteed delivery.\
    \  The\n   problem was that the host stack on the sending host typically doesn't\n\
    \   want to know just that the network delivered a packet, but rather the\n  \
    \ stack layer on the sending host wants to know that the stack layer on\n   the\
    \ receiving host properly processed the packet.  In terms of modern\n   IP stack\
    \ structure, a reliable transport layer requires an indication\n   that transport\
    \ processing has successfully completed, such as given\n   by TCP's ACK message\
    \ [4], and not simply an indication from the IP\n   layer that the packet arrived.\
    \  Similarly, an application layer\n   protocol may require an application-specific\
    \ acknowledgement that\n   contains, among other things, a status code indicating\
    \ the\n   disposition of the request.\n   The specific examples given in [1] and\
    \ other references at the time\n   [2] primarily involve transmission of data\
    \ packets: data integrity,\n   delivery guarantees, duplicate message suppression,\
    \ per packet\n   encryption, and transaction management.  From the viewpoint of\n\
    \   today's Internet architecture, we would view most of these as\n   transport\
    \ layer functions (data integrity, delivery guarantees,\n   duplicate message\
    \ suppression, and perhaps transaction management),\n   others as network layer\
    \ functions with support at other layers where\n   necessary (for example, packet\
    \ encryption), and not application layer\n   functions.\n"
- title: 2.2.  ...In the Middle...
  contents:
  - "2.2.  ...In the Middle...\n   As the Internet developed, the end-to-end principle\
    \ gradually widened\n   to concerns about where best to put the state associated\
    \ with\n   applications in the Internet: in the network or at end nodes.  The\n\
    \   best example is the description in RFC 1958 [6]:\n      This principle has\
    \ important consequences if we require\n      applications to survive partial\
    \ network failures.  An end-to-end\n      protocol design should not rely on the\
    \ maintenance of state (i.e.,\n      information about the state of the end-to-end\
    \ communication)\n      inside the network.  Such state should be maintained only\
    \ in the\n      endpoints, in such a way that the state can only be destroyed\
    \ when\n      the endpoint itself breaks (known as fate-sharing).  An immediate\n\
    \      consequence of this is that datagrams are better than classical\n     \
    \ virtual circuits.  The network's job is to transmit datagrams as\n      efficiently\
    \ and flexibly as possible.  Everything else should be\n      done at the fringes.\n\
    \   The original articulation of the end-to-end principle - that\n   knowledge\
    \ and assistance of the end point is essential and that\n   omitting such knowledge\
    \ and implementing a function in the network\n   without such knowledge and assistance\
    \ is not possible - took a while\n   to percolate through the engineering community,\
    \ and had evolved by\n   this point to a broad architectural statement about what\
    \ belongs in\n   the network and what doesn't.  RFC 1958 uses the term \"application\"\
    \n   to mean the entire network stack on the end node, including network,\n  \
    \ transport, and application layers, in contrast to the earlier\n   articulation\
    \ of the end-to-end principle as being about the\n   communication system itself.\
    \  \"Fate-sharing\" describes this quite\n   clearly: the fate of a conversation\
    \ between two applications is only\n   shared between the two applications; the\
    \ fate does not depend on\n   anything in the network, except for the network's\
    \ ability to get\n   packets from one application to the other.\n   The end-to-end\
    \ principle in this formulation is specifically about\n   what kind of state is\
    \ maintained where:\n      To perform its services, the network maintains some\
    \ state\n      information: routes, QoS guarantees that it makes, session\n  \
    \    information where that is used in header compression, compression\n     \
    \ histories for data compression, and the like.  This state must be\n      self-healing;\
    \ adaptive procedures or protocols must exist to\n      derive and maintain that\
    \ state, and change it when the topology or\n      activity of the network changes.\
    \  The volume of this state must be\n      minimized, and the loss of the state\
    \ must not result in more than\n      a temporary denial of service given that\
    \ connectivity exists.\n      Manually configured state must be kept to an absolute\
    \ minimum.[6]\n   In this formulation of the end-to-end principle, state involved\
    \ in\n   getting packets from one end of the network to the other is\n   maintained\
    \ in the network.  The state is \"soft state,\" in the sense\n   that it can be\
    \ quickly dropped and reconstructed (or even required to\n   be periodically renewed)\
    \ as the network topology changes due to\n   routers and switches going on and\
    \ off line.  \"Hard state\", state upon\n   which the proper functioning of the\
    \ application depends, is only\n   maintained in the end nodes.  This formulation\
    \ of the principle is a\n   definite change from the original formulation of the\
    \ principle, about\n   end node participation being required for proper implementation\
    \ of\n   most functions.\n   In summary, the general awareness both of the principle\
    \ itself and of\n   its implications for how unavoidable state should be handled\
    \ grew\n   over time to become a (if not the) foundation principle of the\n  \
    \ Internet architecture.\n"
- title: 2.3.  ...And Now.
  contents:
  - "2.3.  ...And Now.\n   An interesting example of how the end-to-end principle\
    \ continues to\n   influence the technical debate in the Internet community is\
    \ IP\n   mobility.  The existing Internet routing architecture severely\n   constrains\
    \ how closely IP mobility can match the end-to-end principle\n   without making\
    \ fundamental changes.  Mobile IPv6, described in the\n   Mobile IPv6 specification\
    \ by Johnson, Perkins, and Arkko [7],\n   requires a routing proxy in the mobile\
    \ node's home network (the Home\n   Agent) for maintaining the mapping between\
    \ the mobile node's routing\n   locator, the care of address, and the mobile node's\
    \ node identifier,\n   the home address.  But the local subnet routing proxy (the\
    \ Foreign\n   Agent), which was a feature of the older Mobile IPv4 design [8]\
    \ that\n   compromised end-to-end routing, has been eliminated.  The end node\n\
    \   now handles its own care of address.  In addition, Mobile IPv6\n   includes\
    \ secure mechanisms for optimizing routing to allow end-to-end\n   routing between\
    \ the mobile end node and the correspondent node,\n   removing the need to route\
    \ through the global routing proxy at the\n   home agent.  These features are\
    \ all based on end to end\n   considerations.  However, the need for the global\
    \ routing proxy in\n   the Home Agent in Mobile IPv6 is determined by the aliasing\
    \ of the\n   global node identifier with the routing identifier in the Internet\n\
    \   routing architecture, a topic that was discussed in an IAB workshop\n   and\
    \ reported in RFC 2956 [9], and that hasn't changed in IPv6.\n   Despite this\
    \ constraint, the vision emerging out of the IETF working\n   groups developing\
    \ standards for mobile networking is of a largely\n   autonomous mobile node with\
    \ multiple wireless link options, among\n   which the mobile node picks and chooses.\
    \  The end node is therefore\n   responsible for maintaining the integrity of\
    \ the communication, as\n   the end-to-end principle implies.  This kind of innovative\n\
    \   application of the end-to-end principle derives from the same basic\n   considerations\
    \ of reliability and robustness (wireless link\n   integrity, changes in connectivity\
    \ and service availability with\n   movement, etc.) that motivated the original\
    \ development of the end-\n   to-end principle.  While the basic reliability of\
    \ wired links,\n   routing, and switching equipment has improved considerably\
    \ since the\n   end-to-end principle was formalized 15 years ago, the reliability\
    \ or\n   unreliability of wireless links is governed more strongly by the\n  \
    \ basic physics of the medium and the instantaneous radio propagation\n   conditions.\n"

  - "3.  Trends Opposed to the End-to-End Principle\n   While the end-to-end principle\
    \ continues to provide a solid\n   foundation for much IETF design work, the specific\
    \ application of the\n   end-to-end principle described in RFC 1958 has increasingly\
    \ come into\n   question from various directions.  The IAB has been concerned\
    \ about\n   trends opposing the end-to-end principle for some time, for example\n\
    \   RFC 2956 [9] and RFC 2775 [12].  The primary focus of concern in\n   these\
    \ documents is the reduction in transparency due to the\n   introduction of NATs\
    \ and other address translation mechanisms in the\n   Internet, and the consequences\
    \ to the end-to-end principle of various\n   scenarios involving full, partial,\
    \ or no deployment of IPv6.  More\n   recently, the topic of concern has shifted\
    \ to the consequences of\n   service deployment in the network.  The IAB opinion\
    \ on Open Pluggable\n   Edge Services (OPES) in RFC 3238 [5] is intended to assess\
    \ the\n   architectural desirability of defining services in the network and to\n\
    \   raise questions about how such services might result in compromises\n   of\
    \ privacy, security, and end-to-end data integrity.  Clark, et al.\n   in [10]\
    \ and Carpenter in RFC 3234 [11] also take up the topic of\n   service definition\
    \ in the network.\n   Perhaps the best review of the forces militating against\
    \ the end-to-\n   end principle is by Blumenthal and Clark in [3].  The authors\
    \ make\n   the point that the Internet originally developed among a community\
    \ of\n   like-minded technical professionals who trusted each other, and was\n\
    \   administered by academic and government institutions who enforced a\n   policy\
    \ of no commercial use.  The major stakeholders in the Internet\n   are quite\
    \ different today.  As a consequence, new requirements have\n   evolved over the\
    \ last decade.  Examples of these requirements are\n   discussed in the following\
    \ subsections.  Other discussions about\n   pressures on the end-to-end principle\
    \ in today's Internet can be\n   found in the discussion by Reed [13] and Moors'\
    \ paper in the 2002\n   IEEE International Communications Conference [14].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Need for Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Need for Authentication\n   Perhaps the single most important change from\
    \ the Internet of 15\n   years ago is the lack of trust between users.  Because\
    \ the end users\n   in the Internet of 15 years ago were few, and were largely\
    \ dedicated\n   to using the Internet as a tool for academic research and\n  \
    \ communicating research results (explicit commercial use of the\n   Internet\
    \ was forbidden when it was run by the US government), trust\n   between end users\
    \ (and thus authentication of end nodes that they\n   use) and between network\
    \ operators and their users was simply not an\n   issue in general.  Today, the\
    \ motivations of some individuals using\n   the Internet are not always entirely\
    \ ethical, and, even if they are,\n   the assumption that end nodes will always\
    \ co-operate to achieve some\n   mutually beneficial action, as implied by the\
    \ end-to-end principle,\n   is not always accurate.  In addition, the growth in\
    \ users who are\n   either not technologically sophisticated enough or simply\n\
    \   uninterested in maintaining their own security has required network\n   operators\
    \ to become more proactive in deploying measures to prevent\n   naive or uninterested\
    \ users from inadvertently or intentionally\n   generating security problems.\n\
    \   While the end-to-end principle does not require that users implicitly\n  \
    \ trust each other, the lack of trust in the Internet today requires\n   that\
    \ application and system designers make a choice about how to\n   handle authentication,\
    \ whereas that choice was rarely apparent 15\n   years ago.  One of the most common\
    \ examples of network elements\n   interposing between end hosts are those dedicated\
    \ to security:\n   firewalls, VPN tunnel endpoints, certificate servers, etc.\
    \  These\n   intermediaries are designed to protect the network from unimpeded\n\
    \   attack or to allow two end nodes whose users may have no inherent\n   reason\
    \ to trust each other to achieve some level of authentication.\n   At the same\
    \ time, these measures act as impediments for end-to-end\n   communications. \
    \ Third party trust intermediaries are not a\n   requirement for security, as\
    \ end-to-end security mechanisms, such as\n   S/MIME [15], can be used instead,\
    \ and where third party measures such\n   as PKI infrastructure or keys in DNS\
    \ are utilized to exchange keying\n   material, they don't necessarily impinge\
    \ on end-to-end traffic after\n   authentication has been achieved.  Even if third\
    \ parties are\n   involved, ultimately it is up to the endpoints and their users\
    \ in\n   particular, to determine which third parties they trust.\n"
- title: 3.2.  New Service Models
  contents:
  - "3.2.  New Service Models\n   New service models inspired by new applications\
    \ require achieving the\n   proper performance level as a fundamental part of\
    \ the delivered\n   service.  These service models are a significant change from\
    \ the\n   original best effort service model.  Email, file transfer, and even\n\
    \   Web access aren't perceived as failing if performance degrades,\n   though\
    \ the user may become frustrated at the time required to\n   complete the transaction.\
    \  However, for streaming audio and video, to\n   say nothing of real time bidirectional\
    \ voice and video, achieving the\n   proper performance level, whatever that might\
    \ mean for an acceptable\n   user experience of the service, is part of delivering\
    \ the service,\n   and a customer contracting for the service has a right to expect\
    \ the\n   level of performance for which they have contracted.  For example,\n\
    \   content distributors sometimes release content via content\n   distribution\
    \ servers that are spread around the Internet at various\n   locations to avoid\
    \ delays in delivery if the server is topologically\n   far away from the client.\

- title: 3.3.  Rise of the Third Party
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Rise of the Third Party\n   Academic and government institutions ran the\
    \ Internet of 15 years\n   ago.  These institutions did not expect to make a profit\
    \ from their\n   investment in networking technology.  In contrast, the network\n\
    \   operator with which most Internet users deal today is the commercial\n   ISP.\
    \  Commercial ISPs run their networks as a business, and their\n   investors rightly\
    \ expect the business to turn a profit.  This change\n   in business model has\
    \ led to a certain amount of pressure on ISPs to\n   increase business prospects\
    \ by deploying new services.\n   In particular, the standard retail dialup bit\
    \ pipe account with email\n   and shell access has become a commodity service,\
    \ resulting in low\n   profit margins.  While many ISPs are happy with this business\
    \ model\n   and are able to survive on it, others would like to deploy different\n\
    \   service models that have a higher profit potential and provide the\n   customer\
    \ with more or different services.  An example is retail\n   broadband bit pipe\
    \ access via cable or DSL coupled with streaming\n   multimedia.  Some ISPs that\
    \ offer broadband access also deploy\n   content distribution networks to increase\
    \ the performance of\n   streaming media.  These services are typically deployed\
    \ so that they\n   are only accessible within the ISP's network, and as a result,\
    \ they\n   do not contribute to open, end-to-end service.  From an ISP's\n   standpoint,\
    \ however, offering such service is an incentive for\n   customers to buy the\
    \ ISP's service.\n   ISPs are not the only third party intermediary that has appeared\n\
    \   within the last 10 years.  Unlike the previous involvement of\n   corporations\
    \ and governments in running the Internet, corporate\n   network administrators\
    \ and governmental officials have become\n   increasingly demanding of opportunities\
    \ to interpose between two\n   parties in an end-to-end conversation.  A benign\
    \ motivation for this\n   involvement is to mitigate the lack of trust, so the\
    \ third party acts\n   as a trust anchor or enforcer of good behavior between\
    \ the two ends.\n   A less benign motivation is for the third parties to insert\
    \ policy\n   for their own reasons, perhaps taxation or even censorship.  The\n\
    \   requirements of third parties often have little or nothing to do with\n  \
    \ technical concerns, but rather derive from particular social and\n   legal considerations.\n"

    \   end nodes.  The counterargument - that many end nodes are now\n   essentially\
    \ closed boxes which are not updatable and that most users\n   don't want to update\
    \ them anyway - does not apply to all nodes and\n   all users.  Many end nodes\

    \   attacks of the subtlety and variety that the Internet experiences\n   today\
    \ were not a problem during the original development of the\n   Internet.  By\
    \ and large, the end-to-end principle was not addressed\n   to the decrease in\
    \ reliability resulting from attacks deliberately\n   engineered to take advantage\
    \ of subtle flaws in software.  These\n   attacks are part of the larger issue\
    \ of the trust breakdown discussed\n   in Section 3.1.  Thus, the issue of the\
    \ trust breakdown can be\n   considered another forcing function on the Internet\
    \ architecture.\n   The immediate reaction to this trust breakdown has been to\
    \ try to\n   back fit security into existing protocols.  While this effort is\n\
    \   necessary, it is not sufficient.  The issue of trust must become as\n   firm\
    \ an architectural principle in protocol design for the future as\n   the end-to-end\
    \ principle is today.  Trust isn't simply a matter of\n   adding some cryptographic\
    \ protection to a protocol after it is\n   designed.  Rather, prior to designing\
    \ the protocol, the trust\n   relationships between the network elements involved\
    \ in the protocol\n   must be defined, and boundaries must be drawn between those\
    \ network\n   elements that share a trust relationship.  The trust boundaries\n\
    \   should be used to determine what type of communication occurs between\n  \
    \ the network elements involved in the protocol and which network\n   elements\
    \ signal each other.  When communication occurs across a trust\n   boundary, cryptographic\
    \ or other security protection of some sort may\n   be necessary.  Additional\
    \ measures may be necessary to secure the\n   protocol when communicating network\
    \ elements do not share a trust\n   relationship.  For example, a protocol might\
    \ need to minimize state\n   in the recipient prior to establishing the validity\
    \ of the\n   credentials from the sender in order to avoid a memory depletion\
    \ DoS\n   attack.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The End-to-End Principle in Applications Design
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The End-to-End Principle in Applications Design\n   The concern expressed\
    \ by the end-to-end principle is applicable to\n   applications design too.  Two\
    \ key points in designing application\n   protocols are to ensure they don't have\
    \ any dependencies that would\n   break the end-to-end principle and to ensure\
    \ that they can identify\n   end points in a consistent fashion.  An example of\
    \ the former is\n   layer violations - creating dependencies that would make it\n\
    \   impossible for the transport layer, for example, to do its work\n   appropriately.\
    \  Another issue is the desire to insert more\n   applications infrastructure\
    \ into the network.  Architectural\n   considerations around this issue are discussed\
    \ in RFC 3238 [5].  This\n   desire need not result in a violation of the end-to-end\
    \ principle if\n   the partitioning of functioning is done so that services provided\
    \ in\n   the network operate with the explicit knowledge and involvement of\n\
    \   endpoints, when such knowledge and involvement is necessary for the\n   proper\
    \ functioning of the service.  The result becomes a distributed\n   application,\
    \ in which the end-to-end principle applies to each\n   connection involved in\
    \ implementing the application.\n"
- title: 5.  Internet Standards as an Arena for Conflict
  contents:
  - "5.  Internet Standards as an Arena for Conflict\n   Internet standards have increasingly\
    \ become an arena for conflict\n   [10].  ISPs have certain concerns, businesses\
    \ and government have\n   others, and vendors of networking hardware and software\
    \ still others.\n   Often, these concerns conflict, and sometimes they conflict\
    \ with the\n   concerns of the end users.  For example, ISPs are reluctant to\
    \ deploy\n   interdomain QoS services because, among other reasons, every known\n\
    \   instance creates a significant and easily exploited DoS/DDoS\n   vulnerability.\
    \  However, some end users would like to have end-to-\n   end, Diffserv or Intserv-style\
    \ QoS available to improve support for\n   voice and video multimedia applications\
    \ between end nodes in\n   different domains, as discussed by Huston in RFC 2990\
    \ [16].  In this\n   case, the security, robustness, and reliability concerns\
    \ of the ISP\n   conflict with the desire of users for a different type of service.\n\
    \   These conflicts will inevitably be reflected in the Internet\n   architecture\
    \ going forward.  Some of these conflicts are impossible\n   to resolve on a technical\
    \ level, and would not even be desirable,\n   because they involve social and\
    \ legal choices that the IETF is not\n   empowered to make (for a counter argument\
    \ in the area of privacy, see\n   Goldberg, et al. [17]).  But for those conflicts\
    \ that do involve\n   technical choices, the important properties of user choice\
    \ and\n   empowerment, reliability and integrity of end-to-end service,\n   supporting\
    \ trust and \"good network citizen behavior,\" and fostering\n   innovation in\
    \ services should be the basis upon which resolution is\n   made.  The conflict\
    \ will then play out on the field of the resulting\n   architecture.\n"
- title: 6.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusions\n   The end-to-end principle continues to guide technical development\
    \ of\n   Internet standards, and remains as important today for the Internet\n\
    \   architecture as in the past.  In many cases, unbundling of the end-\n   to-end\
    \ principle into its consequences leads to a distributed\n   approach in which\
    \ the end-to-end principle applies to interactions\n   between the individual\
    \ pieces of the application, while the unbundled\n   consequences, protection\
    \ of innovation, reliability, and robustness,\n   apply to the entire application.\
    \  While the end-to-end principle\n   originated as a focused argument about the\
    \ need for the knowledge and\n   assistance of end nodes to properly implement\
    \ functions in a\n   communication system, particular second order properties\
    \ developed by\n   the Internet as a result of the end-to-end principle have come\
    \ to be\n   recognized as being as important, if not more so, than the principle\n\
    \   itself.  End user choice and empowerment, integrity of service,\n   support\
    \ for trust, and \"good network citizen behavior\" are all\n   properties that\
    \ have developed as a consequence of the end-to-end\n   principle.  Recognizing\
    \ these properties in a particular proposal for\n   modifications to the Internet\
    \ has become more important than before\n   as the pressures to incorporate services\
    \ into the network have\n   increased.  Any proposal to incorporate services in\
    \ the network\n   should be weighed against these properties before proceeding.\n"
