This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from October 12 to October 22.
(Monday, October 11 was Columbus Day.)
During these two weeks, the general status of these Hosts remained as it had been previously.
The table on the following page summarizes the daily information on Host status for this period.
(Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
(Destination Host did not respond in any way to the initial RFC, although not dead.)
H   1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
O   Opened (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to user.)
The UCLA IMB 360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.
The BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS however, we are assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
# These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at these times.
