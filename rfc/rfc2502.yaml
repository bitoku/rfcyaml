  - "1. The Large Multicast Environment\n   The Large-Scale Multicast Applications\
    \ working group (LSMA) was\n   formed to create a consensus based requirement\
    \ for Internet Protocols\n   to support Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)\
    \ [DIS94], its\n   successor the High Level Architecture for simulation (HLA)\
    \ [DMSO96],\n   and related applications. The applications are characterized by\
    \ the\n   need to distribute a real-time applications over a shared wide area\n\
    \   network in a scalable manner such that numbers of hosts from a few to\n  \
    \ tens of thousands are able to interchange state data with sufficient\n   reliability\
    \ and timeliness to sustain a three dimensional virtual,\n   visual environment\
    \ containing large numbers of moving objects.  The\n   network supporting such\
    \ an system necessarily will be capable of\n   multicast [IEEE95a,IEEE95b].\n\
    \   Distributed Interactive Simulation is the name of a family of\n   protocols\
    \ used to exchange information about a virtual environment\n   among hosts in\
    \ a distributed system that are simulating the behavior\n   of objects in that\
    \ environment.  The objects are capable of physical\n   interactions and can sense\
    \ each other by visual and other means\n   (infrared, etc.).  DIS was developed\
    \ by the U.S. Department of\n   Defense (DoD) to implement systems for military\
    \ training, rehearsal,\n   and other purposes. More information on DIS can be\
    \ found in [SSM96].\n   The feature of distributed simulation that drives network\n\
    \   requirements is that it is intended to work with output to and input\n   from\
    \ humans across distributed simulators in real time. This places\n   tight limits\
    \ on latency between hosts.  It also means that any\n   practical network will\
    \ require multicasting to implement the required\n   distribution of all data\
    \ to all participating simulators.  Large\n   distributed simulation configurations\
    \ are expected to group hosts on\n   multicast groups based on sharing the same\
    \ sensor inputs in the\n   virtual environment.  This can mean a need for thousands\
    \ of multicast\n   groups where objects may move between groups in large numbers\
    \ at high\n   rates.  Because the number of simulators is known in advance and\n\
    \   their maximum output rate in packets per second and bits per second\n   is\
    \ specified, the overall total data rate (the sum of all multicast\n   groups)\
    \ is bounded. However the required data rate in any particular\n   group cannot\
    \ be predicted, and may change quite rapidly during the\n   simulation.\n   DIS\
    \ real time flow consists of packets of length around 2000 bits at\n   rates from\
    \ .2 packets per second per simulator to 15 packets per\n   second per simulator.\
    \ This information is intentionally redundant and\n   is normally transmitted\
    \ with a best effort transport protocol (UDP).\n   In some cases it also is compressed.\
    \  Required accuracy both of\n   latency and of physical simulation varies with\
    \ the intended purpose\n   but generally must be at least sufficient to satisfy\
    \ human\n   perception.  For example, in tightly coupled simulations such as high\n\
    \   performance aircraft maximum acceptable latency is 100 milliseconds\n   between\
    \ any two hosts.  At relatively rare intervals events (e.g.\n   collisions) may\
    \ occur which require reliable transmission of some\n   data, on a unicast basis,\
    \ to any other host in the system.\n   The U.S. DoD has a goal to build distributed\
    \ simulation systems with\n   up to 100,000 simulated objects, many of them computer\
    \ generated\n   forces that run with minimal human intervention, acting as opposing\n\
    \   force or simulating friendly forces that are not available to\n   participate.\
    \  DoD would like to carry out such simulations using a\n   shared WAN.  Beyond\
    \ DoD many people see a likelihood that distributed\n   simulation capabilities\
    \ may be commercialized as entertainment.  The\n   scope of such an entertainment\
    \ system is hard to predict but\n   conceivably could be larger than the DoD goal\
    \ of 100,000.\n   The High Level Architecture (HLA) is a DoD development beyond\
    \ DIS\n   that aims at bringing DIS and other forms of distributed simulation\n\
    \   into a unifying system paradigm. From a distributed systems\n   standpoint\
    \ HLA is considerably more sophisticated than DIS. For\n   example attributes\
    \ of distributed objects may be controlled by\n   different simulators.  From\
    \ the standpoint of the supporting network\n   the primary difference between\
    \ HLA and DIS is that HLA does not call\n   for redundant transmission of object\
    \ attributes; instead it specifies\n   a \"Run Time Infrastructure\" (RTI) that\
    \ is responsible to transmit\n   data reliably, and may choose to do so by various\
    \ means including\n   redundant transmission using best effort protocols. It is\
    \ reasonable\n   to say that any network that can meet the needs of DIS can support\n\
    \   HLA by DIS-like redundant transmission, however this approach ignores\n  \
    \ the possibility that under HLA some mixture of redundant and reliable\n   transmission\
    \ can make significantly better use of network resources\n   than is possible\
    \ using DIS.  While HLA, like DIS, does not specify\n   use of a multicasting\
    \ network, it has similar requirements for many-\n   to-many transmission of object\
    \ attributes at rates in excess of one\n   update per object per second that cannot\
    \ be met without multicasting.\n   Further, HLA calls for transmission of semantically\
    \ organized data\n   (for example, groups of objects with similar capabilities\
    \ such as\n   tanks or aircraft) in this many-to-many context.\n   One solution\
    \ that has been employed to deal with these challenges is\n   to aggregate the\
    \ contents of many multicast groups into a single\n   multicast transmission [PuWh95,\
    \ CSTH95].  Termed \"dual-mode\" or \"bi-\n   level\" multicast, this approach\
    \ takes advantage of the fact that\n   although the amount of traffic in any particular\
    \ multicast group can\n   vary greatly, the aggregate of all transmissions is\
    \ bounded. If the\n   traffic is all aggregated into one large flow, an underlying\
    \ ATM\n   network can create multicast SVCs with acceptable QoS to support the\n\
    \   requirement. It also bounds the network control problem of group\n   joins,\
    \ in that the joins take place among dedicated collections of\n   routers and\
    \ across the dedicated SVCs, rather than contending with\n   other LSMAs that\
    \ may be sharing the same network. But it does this at\n   the cost of adding\
    \ to the network a new, nonstandard aggregation\n   element that is a hybrid of\
    \ the Internet and ATM protocols. We\n   address below the requirement to achieve\
    \ such a result using a purely\n   IP network with aggregated reservation via\
    \ RSVP.\n   The defense distributed simulation community has created a number\
    \ of\n   multicast-capable networks for various simulated exercises, ranging\n\
    \   from tens to hundreds of simulated objects distributed across numbers\n  \
    \ of sites ranging from two to twenty. As the number of objects has\n   increased\
    \ they have found that building multicasting networks\n   potentially supporting\
    \ thousands of simultaneous multicast groups\n   with large group change rates\
    \ is a hard problem. This defense problem\n   is the precursor of similar problems\
    \ that can be expected in\n   commercial networks.  Therefore the following sections\
    \ describe the\n   services required and the shortcomings that have been found\
    \ in using\n   today's Internet protocols in providing these services, with the\n\
    \   intention of informing the IETF to enable it to produce protocols\n   that\
    \ meet the needs in these areas.\n"

  - "3.1 Large-scale resource reservation in shared networks\n   The Resource reSerVation\
    \ Protocol (RSVP) is aimed at providing setup\n   and flow-based information for\
    \ managing information flows at pre-\n   committed performance levels.  This capability\
    \ is generally seen as\n   needed in real-time systems such as the HLA RTI. Concerns\
    \ have been\n   raised about the scalability of RSVP, and also about its ability\
    \ to\n   support highly dynamic flow control changes.  In terms of existing\n\
    \   RTI capabilities, the requirement in LSMA is for rapid change of\n   group\
    \ membership, not for rapid change of group reservations.  This\n   is because\
    \ in existing RTIs the aggregate requirement for all groups\n   in a large scale\
    \ distributed simulation is static. However the\n   current RSVP draft standard\
    \ for LSMA does not support aggregation of\n   reservation resources for groups\
    \ of flows and therefore does not meet\n   the needs of existing RTIs.  Moreover,\
    \ there is at least one RTI\n   development underway that intends to use individual,\
    \ dynamic\n   reservations for large numbers of groups, and therefore will require\n\
    \   a dynamic resource reservation capability that scales to thousands of\n  \
    \ multicast groups.\n   Further, RSVP provides support only for communicating\
    \ specifications\n   of the required information flows between simulators and\
    \ the network,\n   and within the network.  Distributing routing information among\
    \ the\n   routers within the network is a different function altogether,\n   performed\
    \ by routing protocols such as Multicast Open Shortest Path\n   First (MOSPF).\
    \ In order to provide effective resource reservation in\n   a large shared network\
    \ function, it may be necessary to have a\n   routing protocol that determines\
    \ paths through the network within the\n   context of a quality of service requirement.\
    \  An example is the\n   proposed Quality Of Service Path First (QOSPF) routing\
    \ protocol\n   [ZSSC97]. Unfortunately the requirement for resource-sensitive\n\
    \   routing will be difficult to define before LSMA networks are deployed\n  \
    \ with RSVP.\n"

    \ obtained when the\n    network can recognize and replicate information packets\

- title: 3.3 Hybrid transmission of best-effort and reliable multicast
  contents:
  - "3.3 Hybrid transmission of best-effort and reliable multicast\n    In general\
    \ the Internet protocol suite uses the Transmission Control\n    Protocol (TCP)\
    \ for reliable end-to-end transport, and the User\n    Datagram Protocol (UDP)\
    \ for best-effort end-to-end transport,\n    including all multicast transport\
    \ services.  The design of TCP is\n    only capable of unicast transmission.\n\
    \    Recently the IETF has seen proposals for several reliable multicast\n   \
    \ transport protocols (see [Mont97] for a summary). A general issue\n    with\
    \ reliable transport for multicast is the congestion problem\n    associated with\
    \ delivery acknowledgments, which has made real-time\n    reliable multicast transport\
    \ infeasible to date.  Of the roughly 15\n    attempts to develop a reliable multicast\
    \ transport, all have shown\n    to have some problem relating to positive receipt\
    \ acknowledgments\n    (ACK) or negative acknowledgments (NAK). In any event,\
    \ its seems\n    clear that there is not likely to be a single solution for reliable\n\
    \    multicast, but rather a number of solutions tailored to different\n    application\
    \ domains. Approaches involving distributed logging seem\n    to hold particular\
    \ promise for the distributed simulation\n    application.\n    In the DIS/HLA\
    \ environment, five different transmission needs can be\n    identified:\n   (1)\
    \ best-effort low-latency multicast of object attributes that often\n       change\
    \ continuously, for example position of mobile objects;\n   (2) low-latency reliable\
    \ multicast of object attributes that do not\n       change continuously but may\
    \ change at arbitrary times during the\n       simulation, for example object\
    \ appearance (An important\n       characteristic of this category is that only\
    \ the latest value of\n       any attribute is needed by the receiver.);\n   (3)\
    \ low-latency, reliable unicast of occasional data among arbitrary\n       members\
    \ of the multicast group (This form of transmission was\n       specified for\
    \ DIS \"collisions\"; it is not in the current HLA\n       specification but might\
    \ profitably be included there. The\n       requirement is for occasional transaction-like\
    \ exchange of data\n       between two arbitrary hosts in the multicast group,\
    \ with a low\n       latency that makes TCP connection impractical.);\n   (4)\
    \ reliable but not necessarily real-time multicast distribution of\n       supporting\
    \ bulk data such as terrain databases and object\n       enumerations; and\n \
    \  (5) reliable unicast of control information between individual RTI\n      \
    \ components (this requirement is met by TCP).\n   All of these transmissions\
    \ take place within the same large-scale\n   multicasting environment. The value\
    \ of integrating categories (1) and\n   (2) into a single selectively reliable\
    \ protocol was proposed by Cohen\n   [Cohe94].  Pullen and Laviano implemented\
    \ this concept [PuLa95] and\n   demonstrated it within the HLA framework [PLM97]\
    \ as the Selectively\n   Reliable Transmission Protocol (SRTP) for categories\
    \ (1) through (3).\n   Category (4) could be supported by a reliable multicast\
    \ protocol such\n   as the commercial multicast FTP offering from Starburst [MRTW97],\n\
    \   however adequate congestion control has not been demonstrated in any\n   such\
    \ protocol. There has been some discussion of using the Real-Time\n   Streaming\
    \ Protocol, RTSP, for this purpose, however as the databases\n   must be transmitted\
    \ reliably and RTSP uses a best-effort model, it\n   does not appear to be applicable.\n\
    \   In summary, it is clear that a hybrid of best-effort and reliable\n   multicast\
    \ (not necessarily all in the same protocol) is needed to\n   support DIS and\
    \ HLA, and that the low-latency, reliable part of this\n   hybrid is not available\
    \ in the Internet protocol suite.\n"
