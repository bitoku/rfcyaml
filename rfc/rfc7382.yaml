  - "Preface\n   This RFC contains text intended for use as a template as designated\n\
    \   below by the markers <BEGIN TEMPLATE TEXT> and <END TEMPLATE TEXT>.\n   Such\
    \ Template Text is subject to the provisions of Section 9(b) of\n   the Trust\
    \ Legal Provisions.\n   This document contains a template to be used for creating\
    \ a\n   Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for an organization that is\n \
    \  part of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  (Throughout\n   this\
    \ document, the term \"organization\" is used broadly, e.g., the\n   entity in\
    \ question might be a business unit of a larger\n   organization.)\n   There is\
    \ no expectation that a CPS will be published as an RFC.  An\n   organization\
    \ will publish the CPS in a manner appropriate for access\n   by the users of\
    \ the RPKI, e.g., on the organization's web site.  As a\n   best current practice,\
    \ organizations are expected to use this\n   template instead of creating one\

    \  Like RFC 6484, it is based on the\n   template specified in RFC 3647 [RFC3647].\
    \  A number of sections\n   contained in the template were omitted from this CPS\

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS)\
    \ of <name\n   of organization>.  It describes the practices employed by the <name\n\
    \   of organization> Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public\n   Key\
    \ Infrastructure (RPKI).  These practices are defined in accordance\n   with the\
    \ requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484] for\n   the RPKI.\n  \
    \ The RPKI is designed to support validation of claims by current\n   holders\
    \ of Internet Number Resources (INRs) (Section 1.6) in\n   accordance with the\
    \ records of the organizations that act as CAs in\n   this PKI.  The ability to\
    \ verify such claims is essential to ensuring\n   the unique, unambiguous distribution\
    \ of these resources.\n   This PKI parallels the existing INR distribution hierarchy.\
    \  These\n   resources are distributed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n\
    \   (IANA) to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).  In some regions,\n   National\
    \ Internet Registries (NIRs) form a tier of the hierarchy\n   below the RIRs for\
    \ INR distribution.  Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs) and network subscribers\
    \ form additional tiers below\n   registries.\n   Conventions Used in This Document:\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This CPS describes:\n   o  Participants\n   o  Publication\
    \ of the certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists\n      (CRLs)\n   o  How\
    \ certificates are issued, managed, re-keyed, renewed, and\n      revoked\n  \
    \ o  Facility management (physical security, personnel, audit, etc.)\n   o  Key\
    \ management\n   o  Audit procedures\n   o  Business and legal issues\n   This\
    \ PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see [RFC6480] for\n   more details):\n\
    \   o  CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for\n     \
    \ each subscriber INR holder.\n   o  End-entity (EE) certificates for organizations\
    \ to use to validate\n      digital signatures on RPKI-signed objects (see definition\
    \ in\n      Section 1.6).\n   o  In the future, the PKI also may include end-entity\
    \ certificates in\n      support of access control for the repository system as\

- title: 1.3.  PKI Participants
  contents:
  - "1.3.  PKI Participants\n   Note that in a PKI the term \"subscriber\" refers\
    \ to an individual or\n   organization that is a subject of a certificate issued\
    \ by a CA.  The\n   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without\n\
    \   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of\n   the\
    \ term to refer to an individual or organization that receives\n   service from\
    \ an ISP.  In such cases, the term \"network subscriber\"\n   will be used.  Also\
    \ note that, for brevity, this document always\n   refers to PKI participants\
    \ as organizations or entities, even though\n   some of them are individuals.\n"
- title: 1.3.1.  Certification Authorities
  contents:
  - "1.3.1.  Certification Authorities\n   <Describe the CAs that you will operate\
    \ for the RPKI.  One approach\n   is to operate two CAs: one designated \"offline\"\
    \ and the other\n   designated \"production\".  The offline CA is the top-level\
    \ CA for the\n   <name of organization> portion of the RPKI.  It provides a secure\n\
    \   revocation and recovery capability in case the production CA is\n   compromised\
    \ or becomes unavailable.  Thus, the offline CA issues\n   certificates only to\
    \ instances of the production CA, and the CRLs it\n   issues are used to revoke\
    \ only certificates issued to the production\n   CA.  The production CA is used\
    \ to issue RPKI certificates to <name of\n   organization> members, to whom INRs\
    \ have been distributed.>\n"

  - "1.3.2.  Registration Authorities\n   <Describe how the Registration Authority\
    \ (RA) function is handled for\n   the CA(s) that you operate.  The RPKI does\
    \ not require establishment\n   or use of a separate Registration Authority in\
    \ addition to the CA\n   function.  The RA function MUST be provided by the same\
    \ entity\n   operating as a CA, e.g., entities listed in Section 1.3.1.  An entity\n\
    \   acting as a CA in this PKI already has a formal relationship with\n   each\
    \ organization to which it distributes INRs.  These organizations\n   already\
    \ perform the RA function implicitly, since they already assume\n   responsibility\
    \ for distributing INRs.>\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The degree to which a relying party can trust\
    \ the binding embodied in\n   a certificate depends on several factors.  These\
    \ factors can include\n   o  the practices followed by the Certification Authority\
    \ (CA) in\n      authenticating the subject\n   o  the CA's operating policy,\
    \ procedures, and technical security\n      controls, including the scope of the\
    \ subscriber's responsibilities\n      (for example, in protecting the private\
    \ key)\n   o  the stated responsibilities and liability terms and conditions of\n\
    \      the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of warranties, and\n     \
    \ limitations of liability)\n   This document provides a framework to address\
    \ the technical,\n   procedural, personnel, and physical security aspects of Certification\n\
    \   Authorities, Registration Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and\n  \
    \ relying party cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the\n   certificate\
    \ generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and\n   revocation are done\
    \ in a secure manner.  Specifically, the following\n   sections are oriented towards\
    \ ensuring the secure operation of the\n   PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository,\
    \ subscriber systems, and\n   relying party systems:\n      Section 3 (\"Identification\
    \ and Authentication\" (I&A))\n      Section 4 (\"Certificate Life Cycle Operational\
    \ Requirements\")\n      Section 5 (\"Facility, Management, and Operational Controls\"\
    )\n      Section 6 (\"Technical Security Controls\")\n      Section 7 (\"Certificate\
    \ and CRL Profiles\")\n      Section 8 (\"Compliance Audit and Other Assessments\"\
    )\n"
