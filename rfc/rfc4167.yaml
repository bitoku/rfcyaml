- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Graceful OSPF Restart, as specified in RFC 3623, provides a mechanism\n\
    \   whereby an OSPF router can stay on the forwarding path even as its\n   OSPF\
    \ software is restarted.  This document provides an implementation\n   report\
    \ for this extension to the base OSPF protocol.\n"

- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   Today, many Internet routers implement a separation of control\
    \ and\n   forwarding functions.  Certain processors are dedicated to control\n\
    \   and management tasks such as OSPF routing, while other processors\n   perform\
    \ the data forwarding tasks.  This separation creates the\n   possibility of maintaining\
    \ a router's data forwarding capability\n   while the router's control software\
    \ is restarted/reloaded.  For the\n   OSPF protocol [OSPF], the protocol mechanisms\
    \ necessary to accomplish\n   this are described in Graceful OSPF Restart [GRACE].\n\
    \   This document satisfies the RFC 1264 [CRITERIA] requirement for a\n   report\
    \ on implementation experience for Graceful OSPF Restart.\n   Section 2 of this\
    \ document contains the results of an implementation\n   survey.  It also documents\
    \ implementation differences between the\n   vendors responding to the survey.\
    \  Section 3 contains a MIB\n   reference.  Section 4 provide an authentication\
    \ reference.  Section 5\n   simply refers to the implementations listed in section\
    \ 2.  Section 6\n   includes a minimal set of test scenarios.  Finally, section\
    \ 7\n   includes a disclaimer with respect to operational experience.\n"
- title: 2.  Implementation Experience
  contents:
  - "2.  Implementation Experience\n   Eleven vendors have implemented graceful OSPF\
    \ and have completed the\n   implementation survey.  These include Redback, Juniper,\
    \ Motorola\n   Computer Group (formerly Netplane Systems), Mahi Networks, Nexthop\n\
    \   technologies, Force10 Networks, Procket, Alcatel, Laurel Networks,\n   DCL\
    \ (Data Connection Limited), and Ericsson.  All have implemented\n   restart from\
    \ the perspective of both a restarting and helper router.\n   All but one vendor\
    \ implemented both planned and unplanned restart.\n   All implementations are\
    \ original.  Seven successfully tested\n   interoperability with Juniper.  Juniper\
    \ successfully tested\n   interoperability with Force10 Networks.  One vendor\
    \ tested with John\n   Moy's GNU Public License implementation [OSPFD].  Two vendors\
    \ had not\n   tested interoperability at the time of the survey.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Implementation Differences
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Implementation Differences\n   The first difference was whether strict\
    \ LSA checking was implemented\n   and, if so, whether it was configurable.  In\
    \ the context of graceful\n   OSPF restart, strict LSA checking indicates whether\
    \ a changed LSA\n   will result in the termination of graceful restart by a helping\n\
    \   router.  Four vendors made it configurable (three defaulted it to\n   enabled\
    \ and one to disabled), another made it a compile option\n   (shipping with strict\
    \ LSA checking disabled), another didn't\n   implement it at all, and five implemented\
    \ strict LSA checking with no\n   configuration option to disable it.\n   The\
    \ second was whether a received grace LSA would be taken to apply\n   only to\
    \ the adjacency on which it was received or to all adjacencies\n   with the restarting\
    \ router.  This is a rather subtle difference since\n   it only applies to helping\
    \ and restarting routers with more than one\n   full adjacency at the time of\
    \ restart.  Eight vendors implemented the\n   option of the received grace LSA\
    \ only applying to the adjacency on\n   which it was received.  Three vendors\
    \ applied the grace LSA to all\n   adjacencies with the grace LSA originator (i.e.,\
    \ the restarting\n   router).\n   The final difference was in whether additional\
    \ extensions were\n   implemented to accommodate other features such as protocol\n\
    \   redistribution or interaction with MPLS VPNs [VPN].  Five vendors\n   implemented\
    \ extensions and six did not.  It should be noted that such\n   extensions are\
    \ beyond the scope of Graceful OSPF Restart [GRACE].\n"
- title: 3.  MIB Reference
  contents:
  - "3.  MIB Reference\n   MIB objects for the Graceful OSPF Restart have been added\
    \ to the OSPF\n   Version 2 Management Information Base [OSPFMIB].  Additions\
    \ include:\n   -  Objects ospfRestartSupport, ospfRestartInterval, ospfRestartAge,\n\
    \      ospfRestartExitReason, and ospfRestartStrictLsaChecking to\n      ospfGeneralGroup.\n\
    \   -  Objects ospfNbrRestartHelperStatus, ospfNbrRestartHelperAge, and\n    \
    \  ospfNbrRestartHelperExitReason to ospfNbrEntry.\n   -  Objects ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperStatus,\n\
    \      ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperAge, and\n      ospfVirtNbrRestartHelperExitReason\
    \ to ospfVirtNbrEntry.\n"
- title: 4.  Authentication Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "4.  Authentication Mechanisms\n   The authentication mechanisms are the same\
    \ as those implemented by\n   the base OSPF protocol [OSPF].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  List of Implementations\n   Refer to section 2.\n"
- title: 6.  Test Scenarios
  contents:
  - "6.  Test Scenarios\n   A router implementing graceful restart should test, at\
    \ a minimum, the\n   following scenarios as both a restarting and helping router.\
    \  For all\n   scenarios, monitoring data plane traffic may be used to ensure\
    \ that\n   the restart is non-disruptive:\n   1. Operation over a broadcast network.\n\
    \   2. Operation over a P2P network.\n   3. Operation over a virtual link.\n \
    \  4. Operation using OSPF MD5 authentication.\n   5. Early graceful restart termination\
    \ when an LSA inconsistency is\n      detected.\n   6. Early graceful restart\
    \ termination when a flooded LSA changes (if\n      implemented).\n"
- title: 7.  Operational Experience
  contents:
  - "7.  Operational Experience\n   Since OSPF graceful restart is configurable, it\
    \ is difficult to gage\n   operational experience at this juncture.  However,\
    \ multiple service\n   providers have tested and evaluated it.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not discuss implementation\
    \ and interoperability\n   aspects of the security mechanisms in great detail,\
    \ as no new\n   security mechanisms are introduced with Graceful OSPF Restart.\n\
    \   Security considerations for the OSPF protocol are included in RFC\n   2328\
    \ [OSPF].  Security considerations for Graceful OSPF Restart are\n   included\
    \ in [GRACE].\n"
