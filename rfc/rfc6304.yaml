  - "Abstract\n   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses\
    \ that\n   are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n\
    \   RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.\n   Devices in such environments\
    \ may occasionally originate Domain Name\n   System (DNS) queries (so-called \"\
    reverse lookups\") corresponding to\n   those private-use addresses.  Since the\
    \ addresses concerned have only\n   local significance, it is good practice for\
    \ site administrators to\n   ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However,\
    \ it is not\n   uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path\
    \ in the\n   public DNS instead of being answered within the site.\n   It is not\
    \ possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to\n   such queries.\
    \  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use\n   addresses and the\
    \ continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of\n   such queries is large and\
    \ growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\n   a distributed sink for such\
    \ queries in order to reduce the load on\n   the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.\
    \  The AS112 project is named\n   after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that\
    \ was assigned to it.\n   This document describes the steps required to install\
    \ a new AS112\n   node and offers advice relating to such a node's operation.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Useful Background Knowledge\n   Installation of an AS112 node is relatively\
    \ straightforward.\n   However, experience in the following general areas may\
    \ prove useful:\n   o  inter-domain routing with BGP [RFC4271];\n   o  DNS authoritative\
    \ server operations; and\n   o  anycast [RFC4786] distribution of DNS services.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Topological Location
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Topological Location\n   AS112 nodes may be located anywhere on the Internet.\
    \  For nodes that\n   are intended to provide a public service to the Internet\
    \ community\n   (as opposed to private use), it may well be advantageous to choose\
    \ a\n   location that is easily (and cheaply) reachable by multiple\n   providers,\
    \ such as an Internet Exchange Point.\n   AS112 nodes may advertise their service\
    \ prefix to BGP peers for local\n   use (analogous to a conventional peering relationship\
    \ between two\n   providers) or for global use (analogous to a customer relationship\n\
    \   with one or more providers).\n   It is good operational practice to notify\
    \ the community of users that\n   may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node\
    \ before it is installed.\n   At an Internet Exchange, local mailing lists usually\
    \ exist to\n   facilitate such announcements.  For nodes that are intended to\
    \ be\n   globally reachable, coordination with other AS112 operators is highly\n\
    \   recommended.  See also Section 5.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operating System and Host Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operating System and Host Considerations\n   Examples in this document\
    \ are based on UNIX and UNIX-like operating\n   systems, but other operating systems\
    \ exist that are suitable for use\n   in construction of an AS112 node.\n   The\
    \ chosen platform should include either support for cloned loopback\n   interfaces\
    \ or the capability to bind multiple addresses to a single\n   loopback interface.\
    \  The addresses of the nameservers listed in\n   Section 2.2 will be configured\
    \ on these interfaces in order that the\n   DNS software can respond to queries\
    \ properly.\n   A host that is configured to act as an AS112 anycast node should\
    \ be\n   dedicated to that purpose and should not be used to simultaneously\n\
    \   provide other services.  This guidance is provided due to the\n   unpredictable\
    \ (and occasionally high) traffic levels that AS112 nodes\n   have been seen to\
    \ attract.\n   System startup scripts should be arranged such that the various\n\
    \   AS112-related components start automatically following a system\n   reboot.\
    \  The order in which interfaces are configured and software\n   components started\
    \ should be arranged such that routing software\n   startup follows DNS software\
    \ startup, and DNS software startup\n   follows loopback interface configuration.\n\
    \   Wrapper scripts or other arrangements should be employed to ensure\n   that\
    \ the anycast service prefix for AS112 is not advertised while\n   either the\
    \ anycast addresses are not configured or the DNS software\n   is not running.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Routing Software
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Routing Software\n   AS112 nodes signal the availability of AS112 nameservers\
    \ to the\n   Internet using BGP [RFC4271]: each AS112 node is a BGP speaker and\n\
    \   announces the prefix 192.175.48.0/24 to the Internet with origin AS\n   112\
    \ (see also Section 2.2).\n   The examples in this document are based on the Quagga\
    \ Routing Suite\n   [QUAGGA] running on Linux, but other software packages exist\
    \ that\n   also provide suitable BGP support for AS112 nodes.\n   The \"bgpd.conf\"\
    \ file is used by Quagga's bgpd daemon, which provides\n   BGP support.  The router\
    \ ID in this example is 203.0.113.1; the AS112\n   node peers with external peers\
    \ 192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.2.  Note the\n   local AS number is 112, and the service\

  - "3.5.  DNS Software\n   Although the queries received by AS112 nodes are definitively\n\

- title: 6.  On the Future of AS112 Nodes
  contents:
  - "6.  On the Future of AS112 Nodes\n   It is recommended practice for the operators\
    \ of recursive nameservers\n   to answer queries for zones served by AS112 nodes\
    \ locally, such that\n   queries never have an opportunity to reach AS112 servers\
    \ [RFC6303].\n   Operational experience with AS112 nodes does not currently indicate\n\
    \   an observable trend towards compliance with those recommendations,\n   however.\n\
    \   It is expected that some DNS software vendors will include default\n   configuration\
    \ that will implement measures such as those described in\n   [RFC6303].  If such\
    \ software is widely deployed, it is reasonable to\n   assume that the query load\
    \ received by AS112 nodes will decrease;\n   however, it is safe to assume that\
    \ the query load will not decrease\n   to zero, and consequently that AS112 nodes\
    \ will continue to provide a\n   useful service for the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   There may be a requirement in the future for AS112 nodes to answer\n   for\
    \ their current set of zones over IPv6 transport.  Such a\n   requirement would\
    \ necessitate the assignment of a corresponding IPv6\n   netblock for use as an\
    \ anycast service prefix.\n   There may be a requirement in the future for AS112\
    \ nodes to serve\n   additional zones or to stop serving particular zones that\
    \ are\n   currently served.  Such changes would be widely announced in\n   operational\
    \ forums and published at <http://www.as112.net/>.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   The AS112 nameservers are all named under the domain\
    \ IANA.ORG (see\n   Section 2.2).  However, the anycast infrastructure itself\
    \ is operated\n   by a loosely coordinated, diverse mix of organisations across\
    \ the\n   Internet, and is not an IANA function.\n   The Autonomous System Number\
    \ 112 and the IPv4 prefix 192.175.48.0/24\n   were assigned by ARIN.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Hosts should never normally send queries to AS112\
    \ servers; queries\n   relating to private-use addresses should be answered locally\
    \ within a\n   site.  Hosts that send queries to AS112 servers may well leak\n\
    \   information relating to private infrastructure to the public network,\n  \
    \ and this could present a security risk.  This risk is orthogonal to\n   the\
    \ presence or absence of authoritative servers for these zones in\n   the public\
    \ DNS infrastructure, however.\n   Queries that are answered by AS112 servers\
    \ are usually unintentional;\n   it follows that the responses from AS112 servers\
    \ are usually\n   unexpected.  Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger intrusion\n\
    \   detection systems or alerts by firewalls.  Operators of AS112 servers\n  \
    \ should be prepared to be contacted by operators of remote\n   infrastructure\
    \ who believe their security has been violated.  Advice\n   to those who mistakenly\
    \ believe that responses from AS112 nodes\n   constitute an attack on their infrastructure\
    \ can be found in\n   [RFC6305].\n   The deployment of AS112 nodes is very loosely\
    \ coordinated compared to\n   other services distributed using anycast.  The malicious\
    \ compromise\n   of an AS112 node and subversion of the data served by the node\
    \ are\n   hence more difficult to detect due to the lack of central management.\n\
    \   Since it is conceivable that changing the responses to queries\n   received\
    \ by AS112 nodes might influence the behaviour of the hosts\n   sending the queries,\
    \ such a compromise might be used as an attack\n   vector against private infrastructure.\n\
    \   Operators of AS112 should take appropriate measures to ensure that\n   AS112\
    \ nodes are appropriately protected from compromise, such as\n   would normally\
    \ be employed for production nameserver or network\n   infrastructure.  The guidance\
    \ provided for root nameservers in\n   [RFC2870] may be instructive.\n   The zones\
    \ hosted by AS112 servers are not signed with DNSSEC\n   [RFC4033].  Given the\
    \ distributed and loosely coordinated structure\n   of the AS112 service, the\
    \ zones concerned could only be signed if the\n   private key material used was\
    \ effectively public, obviating any\n   security benefit resulting from the use\
    \ of those keys.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  History\n   Widespread use of the private address blocks listed\
    \ in [RFC1918]\n   followed that document's publication in 1996.  At that time\
    \ the\n   IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was served by root servers.\n   The idea of off-loading\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA queries relating to [RFC1918]\n   addresses from the root nameservers\
    \ was first proposed by Bill\n   Manning and John Brown.\n   The use of anycast\
    \ for distributing authoritative DNS service for\n   [RFC1918] IN-ADDR.ARPA zones\
    \ was subsequently proposed at a private\n   meeting of root server operators.\n\
    \   ARIN provided an IPv4 prefix for the anycast service and also the\n   autonomous\
    \ system number 112 for use in originating that prefix.\n   This assignment gave\
    \ the project its name.\n   In 2002, the first AS112 anycast nodes were deployed.\n\
    \   In 2011, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was redelegated from the root servers\n   to\
    \ a new set of servers operated independently by AfriNIC, APNIC,\n   ARIN, ICANN,\
    \ LACNIC, and the RIPE NCC and named according to\n   [RFC5855].\n   The use of\
    \ anycast nameservers in the AS112 project contributed to\n   the operational\
    \ experience of anycast DNS services, and it can be\n   seen as a precursor to\
    \ the anycast distribution of other\n   authoritative DNS servers in subsequent\
    \ years (e.g., various root\n   servers).\n"
