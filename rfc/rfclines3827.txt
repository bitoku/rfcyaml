Abstract The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange datalink layer packet traces.
This document describes extensions to this file format to support new media.
Introduction [RFC1761] defines the snoop file format used to store captured network packets for tools that capture, display, and interpret network traffic.
The file format specifies a header containing the Datalink Type field that identifies the network's datalink type.
This document defines new values for this field, as well as an IANA registry for future datalink types.
In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [RFC1761], this document defines the following type codes for the corresponding media:
The IP over Infiniband packet format is described in [IPoIB].
This document created a new IANA registry named "Snoop Datalink Types" to hold the various possible 32 bit (4 octet) snoop datalink types.
This new registry holds the values previously defined in [RFC1761] and tabulated below:
Token Bus    1 IEEE 802.5 Token Ring   2 IEEE 802.6 Metro Net
6 IBM Channel to Channel  7 FDDI
Additionally, the new registry also holds the values defined above in section 2 of this document.
All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting from code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy outlined in [BCP0026].
Type codes up to 26 not defined by this section of the document (10 15 and 19 25) are considered reserved.
The addition of new datalink type codes to the existing file format poses no known security risks.
