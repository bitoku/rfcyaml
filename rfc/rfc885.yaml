  - "2.  Command Meanings\n   IAC WILL END-OF-RECORD\n      The sender of this command
    requests permission to begin\n      transmission of the Telnet END-OF-RECORD (EOR)
    code when\n      transmitting data characters, or the sender of this command\n
    \     confirms it will now begin transmission of EORs with transmitted\n      data
    characters.\n   IAC WON'T END-OF-RECORD\n      The sender of this command demands
    to stop transmitting, or to\n      refuses to begin transmitting, the EOR code
    when transmitting data\n      characters.\n   IAC DO END-OF-RECORD\n      The
    sender of this command requests that the sender of data start\n      transmitting
    the EOR code when transmitting data, or the sender of\n      this command confirms
    that the sender of data is expected to\n      transmit EORs.\n   IAC DON'T END-OF-RECORD\n
    \     The sender of this command demands that the receiver of the\n      command
    stop or not start transmitting EORs when transmitting\n      data.\n"

  title: 3.  Default

  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   Many interactive systems use one (or more) of
    the normal data\n   characters to indicate the end of an effective unit of data
    (i.e., a\n   record), for example, carriage-return (or line-feed, or escape).\n
    \  Some systems, however, have some special means of indicating the end\n   of
    an effective data unit, for example, a special key.  This Telnet\n   option provides
    a means of communicating the end of data unit in a\n   standard way.\n"
  title: 4. Motivation for the Option
- contents:
  - "5.  Description of the Option\n   When the END-OF-RECORD option is in effect
    on the connection between\n   a sender of data and the receiver of the data, the
    sender transmits\n   EORs.\n   It seems probable that the parties to the Telnet
    connection will\n   transmit EORs in both directions of the Telnet connection
    if EORs are\n   used at all;  however, the use of EORs must be negotiated\n   independently
    for each direction.\n   When the END-OF-RECORD option is not in effect, the IAC
    EOR command\n   should be treated as a NOP if received, although IAC EOR should
    not\n   normally be sent in this mode.\n"
  title: 5.  Description of the Option
- contents:
  - "6.  Implementation Considerations\n   As the EOR code indicates the end of an
    effective data unit, Telnet\n   should attempt to send the data up to and including
    the EOR code\n   together to promote communication efficiency.\n   The end of
    record is indicated by the IAC EOR 2-octet sequence.  The\n   code for EOR is
    239 (decimal).\n"
