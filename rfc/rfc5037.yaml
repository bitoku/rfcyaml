  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to document how some of the\
    \ requirements\n   specified in [RFC1264] for advancing protocols developed by\
    \ working\n   groups within the IETF Routing Area to Draft Standard have been\n\
    \   satisfied by LDP.  Specifically, this report documents operational\n   experience\
    \ with LDP, requirement 5 of section 5.0 in RFC 1264.\n   LDP was originally published\
    \ as [RFC3036] in January 2001.  It was\n   produced by the MPLS Working Group\
    \ of the IETF and was jointly\n   authored by Loa Andersson, Paul Doolan, Nancy\
    \ Feldman, Andre\n   Fredette, and Bob Thomas.  It has since been obsoleted by\
    \ [RFC5036].\n"
- title: 2.  Operational Experience
  contents:
  - "2.  Operational Experience\n   This section discusses operational experience\
    \ with the protocol.  The\n   information is based on a survey sent to the MPLS\
    \ Working Group in\n   October 2004.  The questionnaire can be found in the MPLS\
    \ Working\n   Group mail archives for October 2004.\n   11 responses were received,\
    \ all but 2 requesting confidentiality.\n   The survey results are summarized\
    \ to maintain confidentiality.  The\n   networks surveyed span different geographic\
    \ locations: US, Europe,\n   and Asia.  Both academic and commercial networks\
    \ responded to the\n   survey.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Environment and Duration
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Environment and Duration\n   The size of the deployments ranges from less\
    \ than 20 Label Switching\n   Routers (LSRs) to over 1000 LSRs.  Eight out of\
    \ the 11 deployments\n   use LDP in the edge and the core, two on the edge only,\
    \ and one in\n   the core only.\n   Sessions exist to peers discovered via both\
    \ the basic and the\n   extended discovery mechanisms.  In half the cases, more\
    \ than one\n   adjacency (and as many as four adjacencies) are maintained per\n\
    \   session.  The average number of LDP sessions on an LSR ranges from\n   under\
    \ 10 to just over 80.  The responses are spread out as follows:\n   under 10:\
    \ 4 responses, 20-50: 4 responses, and over 80: 1 response.\n   In the surveyed\
    \ networks, the time LDP has been deployed ranges from\n   under 1 year to over\
    \ 4 years.  The responses are spread out as\n   follows: under 1 year: 3 responses,\
    \ 2 years: 2 responses, 3 years: 3\n   responses, and over 4 years: 3 responses.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Applications and Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Applications and Motivation\n   Nine of the 11 responses list Layer 3 Virtual\
    \ Private Networks\n   (L3VPNs) as the application driving the LDP deployment\
    \ in the\n   network.\n   The list of applications is as follows: L3VPNs: 9, pseudowires:\
    \ 4\n   current (and one planned deployment), L2VPNs: 4, forwarding based on\n\
    \   labels: 2, and BGP-free core: 1.\n   There are two major options for label\
    \ distribution protocols, LDP and\n   Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering\
    \ (RSVP-TE).  One of\n   the key differences between the two is that RSVP-TE has\
    \ support for\n   traffic engineering, while LDP does not.  The reasons cited\
    \ for\n   picking LDP as the label distribution protocol are:\n      o  The deployment\
    \ does not require traffic engineering - 6\n      o  Inter-operability concerns\
    \ if a different protocol is used - 5\n      o  Equipment vendor only supports\
    \ LDP - 5\n      o  Ease of configuration - 4\n      o  Ease of management - 3\n\
    \      o  Scalability concerns with other protocols - 3\n      o  Required for\
    \ a service offering of the service provider - 1\n"
- title: 2.3.  Protocol Features
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Protocol Features\n   All deployments surveyed use the Downstream Unsolicited\
    \ Label\n   Distribution mode.  All but one deployment use Liberal Label\n   retention\
    \ (one uses conservative).\n   LSP setup is established with both independent\
    \ and Ordered Control.\n   Five of the deployments use both control modes in the\
    \ same network.\n   The number of LDP Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) advertised\n\
    \   and LDP routes installed falls in one of two categories: 1) roughly\n   the\
    \ same as the number of LSRs in the network and 2) roughly the same\n   as the\
    \ number of IGP routes in the network.  Of the 8 responses that\n   were received,\
    \ 6 were in the first category and 2 in the second.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Security Concerns
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Security Concerns\n   A security concern was raised by one of the operators\
    \ with respect to\n   the lack of a mechanism for securing LDP Hellos.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Implementations and Inter-Operability
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Implementations and Inter-Operability\n   Eight of the 11 responses state\
    \ that more than one implementation\n   (and as many as four different ones) are\
    \ deployed in the same\n   network.\n   The consensus is that although implementations\
    \ differ, no inter-\n   operability issues exist.  The challenges listed by providers\
    \ running\n   multiple implementations are:\n      o  Different flexibility in\
    \ picking for which FECs to advertise\n         labels.\n      o  Different flexibility\
    \ in setting transport and LDP router-id\n         addresses.\n      o  Different\
    \ default utilization of LDP labels for traffic\n         resolution.  Some vendors\
    \ use LDP for both VPN and IPv4 traffic\n         forwarding, while other vendors\
    \ allow only VPN traffic to\n         resolve via LDP.  The challenge is to restrict\
    \ the utilization\n         of LDP labels to VPN traffic in a mixed-vendor environment.\n\
    \      o  Understanding the differences in the implementations.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Operational Experience
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Operational Experience\n   In general, operators reported stable implementations\
    \ and steady\n   improvement in resiliency to failure and convergence times over\
    \ the\n   years.  Some operators reported that no issues were found with the\n\
    \   protocol since deploying.\n   The operational issues reported fall in three\
    \ categories:\n      1. Configuration issues.  Both the session and adjacency\
    \ endpoints\n         must be allowed by the firewall filters.  Misconfiguration\
    \ of\n         the filters causes sessions to drop (if already established) or\n\
    \         not to establish.\n      2. Vendor bugs.  These include traffic blackholing,\
    \ unnecessary\n         label withdrawals and changes, session resets, and problems\n\
    \         migrating from older versions of the technology.  Most reports\n   \
    \      stated that the problems reported occurred in early versions of\n     \
    \    the implementations.\n      3. Protocol issues.\n         -  The synchronization\
    \ required between LDP and the IGP was\n            listed as the main protocol\
    \ issue.  Two issues were\n            reported: 1) slow convergence, due to the\
    \ fact that LDP\n            convergence time is tied to the IGP convergence time,\
    \ and 2)\n            traffic blackholing on a link-up event.  When an interface\n\
    \            comes up, the LDP session may come up slower than the IGP\n     \
    \       session.  This results in dropping MPLS traffic for a link-\n        \
    \    up event (not a failure but a restoration).  This issue is\n            described\
    \ in more detail in [LDP-SYNC].\n         -  Silent failures.  Failure not being\
    \ propagated to the head\n            end of the LSP when setting up LSPs using\
    \ independent\n            control.\n"
