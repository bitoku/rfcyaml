- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)\n\
    \   to enable direct client access to file data on storage devices and\n   bypass\
    \ the NFSv4 server.  This can increase both performance and\n   parallelism, but\
    \ it requires additional client functionality, some of\n   which depends upon\
    \ the type of storage used.  The pNFS specification\n   for block storage (RFC\
    \ 5663) describes how clients can identify the\n   volumes used for pNFS, but\
    \ this mechanism requires communication with\n   the NFSv4 server.  This document\
    \ updates RFC 5663 to add a mechanism\n   that enables identification of block\
    \ storage devices used by pNFS\n   file systems without communicating with the\
    \ server.  This enables\n   clients to control access to pNFS block devices when\
    \ the client\n   initially boots, as opposed to waiting until the client can\n\
    \   communicate with the NFSv4 server.\n"

    \ 1.  pNFS Architecture\n   In this document, \"storage device\" is used as a\
    \ general term for a\n   data server and/or storage server for any pNFS layout\
    \ type.  The\n   MetaData Server (MDS) is the NFSv4 server that provides pNFS\
    \ layouts\n   to clients and handles operations on file metadata (e.g., names\
    \ and\n   attributes).\n   For the pNFS block protocol as specified in [RFC5663],\
    \ client\n   identification of pNFS storage devices requires contacting the MDS\
    \ to\n   obtain device signature information.  It is not possible for a pNFS\n\
    \   client to reliably identify pNFS block storage devices without\n   contacting\
    \ the MDS, because the device signature location and\n   contents may vary among\
    \ devices and servers; both device signature\n   location and contents are determined\
    \ by the MDS, not the client.\n   Typical operating system (OS) boot functionality\
    \ scans and activates\n   block devices (e.g., Small Computer System Interface\
    \ (SCSI)) before\n   activating the NFS client (including pNFS functionality).\
    \  This\n   sequence of operations creates a window of time during which the\n\
    \   client OS may modify a pNFS block device without contacting the\n   server\
    \ (e.g., by attempting to mount or initialize a local physical\n   filesystem).\
    \  This document specifies an identification mechanism for\n   pNFS block storage\
    \ devices that can be used by an OS implementation\n   to remove this window of\
    \ vulnerability.\n   Many storage area network (SAN) storage systems provide quasi-static\n\
    \   access control mechanisms (e.g., Logical Unit Number (LUN) mapping\n   and/or\
    \ masking) that operate at the granularity of individual hosts.\n   While it is\
    \ feasible to use such mechanisms to remove this window\n   (e.g., by only enabling\
    \ a client to access pNFS block storage devices\n   after the client has contacted\
    \ the responsible MDS), such usage is\n   undesirable and potentially problematic.\
    \  This is because the storage\n   access control mechanisms are quasi-static;\
    \ they are typically\n   configured once to allow client access to the block pNFS\
    \ storage\n   devices and not reconfigured dynamically (e.g., based on crashes\
    \ and\n   reboots).  Block storage access controls can be changed to respond to\n\
    \   unusual circumstances (e.g., to fence [remove access from] an\n   uncooperative\
    \ pNFS client), but should not be used as part of routine\n   client operations\
    \ (e.g., reboot).  A different mechanism is needed.\n   This document specifies\
    \ an entry in the GUID (Globally Unique\n   Identifier) partition table (GPT)\
    \ that can be used by a pNFS server\n   to label pNFS storage devices.  This GPT\
    \ entry is intended for shared\n   pNFS storage devices that are accessible to\
    \ pNFS clients and servers,\n   and that may be accessible to other hosts or systems.\
    \  This entry\n   enables pNFS clients, as well as other hosts and systems, to\
    \ avoid\n   accessing pNFS storage devices via means other than pNFS.\n"

- title: 3.  GPT Partition Table Entry
  contents:
  - "3.  GPT Partition Table Entry\n   The following mechanism enables pNFS clients\
    \ to identify pNFS block\n   storage devices without contacting the server:\n\
    \      -  Each block storage device dedicated to pNFS includes a GUID\n      \
    \   partition table (GPT) [GPT].\n      -  The pNFS block storage partitions are\
    \ identified in the GPT\n         with GUID e5b72a69-23e5-4b4d-b176-16532674fc34,\
    \ which has been\n         generated for this purpose.  GPT GUID usage is well\
    \ understood\n         and implemented.  This document provides a definition for\
    \ this\n         GUID and its usage.  A central registration mechanism does not\n\
    \         exist for GPT GUIDs, or GUIDs in general, by design; see\n         [RFC4122].\n\
    \   This mechanism enables an operating system to prevent non-pNFS access\n  \
    \ to pNFS block storage immediately upon boot.  Servers that support\n   pNFS\
    \ block layouts SHOULD use the GPT and this GUID for all pNFS\n   block storage\
    \ devices.\n   A pNFS client operating system that supports block layouts SHOULD\n\
    \   recognize this GUID and SHOULD use its presence to prevent data\n   access\
    \ to pNFS block devices until a layout that includes the device\n   is received\
    \ from the MDS.\n   Data stored on pNFS block layout storage devices can be better\n\
    \   protected by incorporating checks for this GUID into other hosts and\n   systems\
    \ that do not support pNFS block layouts.  If pNFS block\n   storage devices are\
    \ presented to such hosts or systems by mistake,\n   the check for presence of\
    \ this GUID can be used to prevent writes\n   that could otherwise corrupt stored\
    \ pNFS data.\n   Many current operating system versions support the GPT [GPT-W].\n"
