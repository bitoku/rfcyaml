  - "                     BBN's Comments on NWG/RFC #33\nBBN has given us the attached\
    \ comments on NWG/RFC 33, but wouldn't\npublish them being relectant to embarrass\
    \ us.  Embarrassment notwith-\nstanding, we found the comments particularly useful\
    \ and decided to share\nthem with our friends.  Bill Crowther is the author.\n\
    I found two substantial errors in the Host Protocol Paper, which was\notherwise\
    \ an excellent paper.  Both concern a misunderstanding of the\nnature of the IMP\
    \ as a communications device, and in particular the\nnature of buffering an IMP\
    \ must do.  The authors consider the network as\na device into which one pushes\
    \ a message which travels around some,\nwaits in buffers for substantial lengths\
    \ of times, and then emerges at\nthe destination.  In fact a better model would\
    \ be that the message pops\nout again an instant after it is inserted.  While\
    \ it is true there is a\ndelay, it is imposed by phone line hardware for the most\
    \ part.  The IMP\nbuffering is minimal, and devoted to error control and momentary\
    \ traffic\nsurges.\nSince we cannot force a Host to take a message, we have built\
    \ an elab-\norate RFNM mechanism to suspend new input until he does.  This mech-\n\
    anism is an imperfect attempt to solve a very hard communications\nproblem.  The\
    \ desire is to regulate traffic in such a way that as the\nHost takes its message\
    \ from the IMP the next message is arriving on the\nphone line, and no buffering\
    \ occurs at all.\nIn fact we cannot achieve this, and therefore have included\
    \ buffering to\nhandle traffic surges.  These buffers are useless for their intended\n\
    purpose unless they are empty.  Only empty buffers are available to soak\nup a\
    \ traffic surge.\nThe two specific errors occur on pages 5 and 23.  On page 5\
    \ the authors\nsay \"Implicit in this purpose is the assumption that a user does\
    \ not use\nmultiple links to achieve a wide band.\"  In fact one of the primary\n\
    purposes of links is to achieve a wider band.\nWe wish to allow as much band width\
    \ as possible.  Our troubles occur not\nwith wide band but with an imbalance of\
    \ input and output.  The authors\nhave rightly noticed that multiple links subvert\
    \ the RFNM mechanism,\nmaking our job harder, but have wrongly labeled the nature\
    \ of the\nproblem.\nAgain on page 5 \"An even more basic assumption, of course,\
    \ is that the\nnetwork's load comes from some users transmitting sequences of\
    \ messages\nrather than many users transmitting single messages coincidentally.\"\
    \  We\nare in great shape against single message users when their messages are\n\
    randomly related.  The statistics are all in our favor and we have\nspecial procedures\
    \ for the (rare) coincedences.  Our problems come with\nthe non-random coincidences,\
    \ and we have taken special precautions\nagainst users transmitting bursts (sequences)\
    \ of messages.  We assume\nall kinds of users, and protect ourselves accordingly.\n\
    On pages 23 and 24 there are 4 critical sentences which imply that the\nsystem\
    \ design could have been improved by allowing the Host to specify\nwhich of several\
    \ waiting inputs he might wish to accept.  We grant that\nthe Host needs to buffer\
    \ these messages for its users, but violently\ndisagree that the IMP has the capability\
    \ to do this buffering.\nIf we are operating in ideal mode, we would have at most\
    \ one message for\nthe Host at any time.  If we have more than one we urgently\
    \ need the\nHost to accept these messages, because our ability to handle traffic\n\
    surges is now below standard.  At present we allow three full\nlength messages\
    \ in an IMP for its Host before we start backing traffic\nup in the network. \
    \ \"Three\" is not enough to help the Host in addition\nto keeping a reserve for\
    \ the traffic surges.\nBut if buffering is needed why not get more memory and\
    \ do it in the IMP?\nBecause buffering is a Host function, is different in each\
    \ time share\nsystem, is hard to control over a busy serial channel, might not\
    \ be\nneeded at all in some places, and is better done where the extra memory\n\
    can be efficiently shared by the Host operating system.\nI repeat:  the IMP's\
    \ buffers must be empty or they are not serving their\ncommunication purpose.\n\
    The offending sentences are:\n     Paragraph 2 sentence 3\n           \"   3 all\n\
    \           \"   4 sentences 1 and 2 (80ms is hardware screw adjustable)\n   \
    \        \"   4 sentence last\n          [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n      [ into the online RFC archives by Jeff & Christy McClellan\
    \ 2/98]\n"
