  - "Public Key Standards and Licenses\n   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology\
    \ and the Board of Trustees\n   of the Leland Stanford Junior University have\
    \ recently granted Public\n   Key Partners exclusive sublicensing rights to the\
    \ following patents\n   registered in the United States, and all of their corresponding\n\
    \   foreign patents:\n      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method\n      (\"Diffie-Hellman\"\
    )............................... No. 4,200,770\n      Public Key Cryptographic\
    \ Apparatus\n      and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582\n\
    \      Cryptographic Communications System and\n      Method (\"RSA\")...................................\
    \ No. 4,405,829\n      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus\n      and Method (\"\
    Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414\n   These patents cover all\
    \ known methods of practicing the art of Public\n   Key, including the variations\
    \ collectively known as El Gamal.\n   Due to the broad acceptance of RSA digital\
    \ signatures throughout the\n   international community, Public Key Partners strongly\
    \ endorses its\n   incorporations in a digital signature standard.  We assure\
    \ the\n   interested parties that Public Key Partners will comply with all of\n\
    \   the policies of ANSI and the IEEE concerning the availability of\n   licenses\
    \ to practice this art.  Specifically, in support of any RSA\n   signature standard\
    \ which may be adopted, Public Key Partners hereby\n   gives its assurance that\
    \ licenses to practice RSA signatures will be\n   available under reasonable terms\
    \ and conditions on a non-\n   discriminatory basis.\n   We take this opportunity\
    \ to thank all of those concerned for their\n   collective efforts in making this\
    \ technology readily available for\n   commercial implementation.\n          \
