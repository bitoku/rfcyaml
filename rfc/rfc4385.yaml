- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The standard MPLS encapsulations have no explicit protocol\n\
    \   identifier.  In order for a pseudowire (PW) [RFC3985] to operate\n   correctly\
    \ over an MPLS packet switched network (PSN) that performs\n   MPLS payload inspection,\
    \ a PW packet must not appear to a label\n   switching router (LSR) as if it were\
    \ an IP packet [BCP].  An example\n   of an LSR that performs MPLS payload inspection\
    \ is one that is\n   performing equal-cost multiple-path load-balancing (ECMP)\
    \ [RFC2992].\n   If ECMP were performed on PW packets, the packets in the PW may\
    \ not\n   all follow the same path through the PSN.  This may result in\n   misordered\
    \ packet delivery to the egress PE.  The inability to ensure\n   that all packets\
    \ belonging to a PW follow the same path may also\n   prevent the PW Operations\
    \ and Management (OAM) [VCCV] mechanism from\n   correctly monitoring the PW.\n\
    \   This document specifies how the PW control word is used to\n   distinguish\
    \ a PW payload from an IP payload carried over an MPLS PSN.\n   It then describes\
    \ the preferred design of a PW Control Word to be use\n   over an MPLS PSN, and\
    \ the Pseudowire Associated Channel Header.\n"

- title: 2.  Avoiding ECMP
  contents:
  - "2.  Avoiding ECMP\n   A PW that is carried over an MPLS PSN that uses the contents\
    \ of the\n   MPLS payload to select the ECMP path may be subjected to packet\n\
    \   misordering [BCP].  In cases where the application using the PW is\n   sensitive\
    \ to packet misordering, or where packet misordering will\n   disrupt the operation\
    \ of the PW, it is necessary to prevent the PW\n   being subjected to ECMP.\n\
    \   All IP packets [RFC791] [RFC2460] start with a version number that is\n  \
    \ checked by LSRs performing MPLS payload inspection.  To prevent the\n   incorrect\
    \ processing of packets carried within a PW, PW packets\n   carried over an MPLS\
    \ PSN MUST NOT start with the value 4 (IPv4) or\n   the value 6 (IPv6) in the\
    \ first nibble [BCP], as those are assumed to\n   carry normal IP payloads.\n\
    \   This document defines a PW header and two general formats of that\n   header.\
    \  These two formats are the PW MPLS Control Word (PWMCW),\n   which is used for\
    \ data passing across the PW, and a PW Associated\n   Channel Header (PWACH),\
    \ which can be used for functions such as OAM.\n   If the first nibble of a PW\
    \ packet carried over an MPLS PSN has a\n   value of 0, this indicates that the\
    \ packet starts with a PWMCW.  If\n   the first nibble of a packet carried over\
    \ an MPLS PSN has a value of\n   1, it starts with a PWACH.  The use of any other\
    \ first nibble value\n   for a PW packet carried over an MPLS PSN is deprecated.\n\
    \   If a PW is sensitive to packet misordering and is being carried over\n   an\
    \ MPLS PSN that uses the contents of the MPLS payload to select the\n   ECMP path,\
    \ it MUST employ a mechanism that prevents packet\n   misordering.  A suitable\
    \ mechanism is the PWMCW described in Section\n   3 for data, and the PWACH described\
    \ in Section 5 for channel-\n   associated traffic.\n   The PWMCW or the PWACH\
    \ MUST immediately follow the bottom of the MPLS\n   label stack.\n"

    \        Figure 2: Preferred PW MPLS Control Word\n   The meaning of the fields\

    \ (bits 4 to 7):\n          These bits MAY be used by for per-payload signaling.\
    \  Their\n          semantics MUST be defined in the PW specification.\n   FRG\
    \ (bits 8 and 9):\n          These bits are used when fragmenting a PW payload.\
    \  Their use\n          is described in [FRAG], which is currently a work in progress.\n\
    \          When the PW is of a type that will never need payload\n          fragmentation,\
    \ these bits may be used as general purpose\n          flags.\n   Length (bits\
    \ 10 to 15):\n          When the PSN path between the PEs includes an Ethernet\n\
    \          segment, the PW packet arriving at the CE-bound PE from the\n     \
    \     PSN may include padding appended by the Ethernet Data Link\n          Layer.\
    \  The CE-bound PE uses the length field to determine\n          the size of the\
    \ padding added by the PSN, and hence extract\n          the PW payload from the\
    \ PW packet.\n          If the MPLS payload is less than 64 bytes, the length\
    \ field\n          MUST be set to the length of the PW payload plus the length\n\
    \          of the PWMCW.  Otherwise it MUST be set to zero.\n   Sequence number\

    \ a packet is received on that PW, the sequence number SHOULD be\n   processed\
    \ as follows:\n     o If the sequence number on the packet is zero, the sequence\n\
    \       integrity of the packets cannot be determined.  In this case, the\n  \
    \     received packet is considered to be in order.\n     o Otherwise if the packet\

    \  the expected sequence number is less than 32768, the packet is\n       within\

    \  The\n       implementation MAY treat the packet as in order.\n     o Otherwise\
    \ the packet is out of order.\n   If the packet is found to be in order, it MAY\
    \ be delivered\n   immediately.\n   If the packet sequence number was not zero,\
    \ then the expected\n   sequence number is set to the packet sequence number plus\
    \ one.  The\n   expected sequence number that follows 65535 (maximum unsigned\
    \ 16-bit\n   number) is one.\n   Packets that are received out of order MAY either\
    \ be dropped or\n   reordered.  The choice between dropping or reordering an out-of-\n\
    \   sequence packet is at the discretion of the receiver.\n   If a PE negotiated\
    \ not to use receive sequence number processing, and\n   it received a non-zero\
    \ sequence number, then it SHOULD send a PW\n   status message indicating a receive\
    \ fault, and disable the PW.\n"
- title: 5.  PW Associated Channel

    \   security issues, and provide mechanisms to prevent an attacker from\n   using\
    \ this as a mechanism to disrupt the operation of the PW or the\n   PE, and to\
    \ stop this channel from being used as a conduit to deliver\n   packets elsewhere.\
    \  The selection of a suitable security mechanism\n   for an application using\
    \ a PW Associated Channel is outside the scope\n   of this document.\n   If a\
    \ PW has been configured to operate without a CW, the PW\n   Associated Channel\
    \ Type mechanism described in the document MUST NOT\n   be used.  This is to prevent\
