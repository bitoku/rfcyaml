  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document identifies requirements and an architecture\
    \ for the\n   transport of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams\n  \
    \ [ISO-MPEG].  The prime focus is the efficient and flexible delivery\n   of IP\
    \ services over those subnetworks that use the MPEG-2 Transport\n   Stream (TS).\n\
    \   The architecture is designed to be compatible with services based on\n   MPEG-2,\
    \ for example the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) architecture,\n   the Advanced\
    \ Television Systems Committee (ATSC) system [ATSC,\n   ATSC-G], and other similar\
    \ MPEG-2-based transmission systems.  Such\n   systems typically provide unidirectional\
    \ (simplex) physical and link\n   layer standards, and have been defined for a\
    \ wide range of physical\n   media (e.g., Terrestrial TV [ETSI-DVBT, ATSC-PSIP-TC],\
    \ Satellite TV\n   [ETSI-DVBS, ETSI-DVBS2, ATSC-S], Cable Transmission [ETSI-DVBC,\n\
    \   ATSC-PSIP-TC, OPEN-CABLE], and data transmission over MPEG-2\n   [ETSI-MHP].\n\

    \       Figure 1: Overview of the MPEG-2 protocol stack\n   Although many MPEG-2\
    \ systems carry a mixture of data types, MPEG-2\n   components may be, and are,\
    \ also used to build IP-only networks.\n   Standard system components offer advantages\
    \ of improved\n   interoperability and larger deployment.  However, some MPEG-2\n\
    \   networks do not implement all parts of a DVB / ATSC system, and may,\n   for\
    \ instance, support minimal, or no, signalling of Service\n   Information (SI)\

- title: 1.1.  Salient Features of the Architecture
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Salient Features of the Architecture\n   The architecture defined in this\
    \ document describes a set of\n   protocols that support transmission of IP packets\
    \ over the MPEG-2 TS.\n   Key characteristics of these networks are that they\
    \ may provide\n   link-level broadcast capability, and that many supported applications\n\
    \   require access to a very large number of subnetwork nodes.\n   Some, or all,\
    \ of these protocols may also be applicable to other\n   subnetworks, e.g., other\
    \ MPEG-2 transmission networks, regenerative\n   satellite links [ETSI-BSM], and\
    \ some types of broadcast wireless\n   links.  The key goals of the architecture\
    \ are to reduce complexity\n   when using the system, while improving performance,\
    \ increasing\n   flexibility for IP services, and providing opportunities for\
    \ better\n   integration with IP services.\n   Since a majority of MPEG-2 transmission\
    \ networks are bandwidth-\n   limited, encapsulation protocols must therefore\
    \ add minimal overhead\n   to ensure good link efficiency while providing adequate\
    \ network\n   services.  They also need to be simple to minimize processing, robust\n\
    \   to errors and security threats, and extensible to a wide range of\n   services.\n\
    \   In MPEG-2 systems, TS Logical Channels, are identified by their PID\n   and\
    \ provide multiplexing, addressing, and error reporting.  The TS\n   Logical Channel\
    \ may also be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS).\n   Mapping functions\
    \ are required to relate TS Logical Channels to IP\n   addresses, to map TS Logical\
    \ Channels to IP-level QoS, and to\n   associate IP flows with specific subnetwork\
    \ capabilities.  An\n   important feature of the architecture is that these functions\
    \ may be\n   provided in a dynamic way, allowing transparent integration with\n\
    \   other IP-layer protocols.  Collectively, these will form an MPEG-2 TS\n  \
    \ Address Resolution (AR) protocol suite [IPDVB-AR].\n"

    \ of TS\n   Packets.\n   Forward Direction: The dominant direction of data transfer\
    \ over a\n   network path.  Data transfer in the forward direction is called\n\

    \ used for video or audio information.\n   PID: Packet Identifier [ISO-MPEG].\
    \  A 13 bit field carried in the\n   header of TS Packets.  This is used to identify\
    \ the TS Logical\n   Channel to which a TS Packet belongs [ISO-MPEG].  The TS\
    \ Packets\n   forming the parts of a Table Section, PES, or other Payload Unit\
    \ must\n   all carry the same PID value.  The all 1s PID value indicates a Null\n\
    \   TS Packet introduced to maintain a constant bit rate of a TS\n   Multiplex.\
    \  There is no required relationship between the PID values\n   used for TS Logical\
    \ Channels transmitted using different TS\n   Multiplexes.\n   PMT: Program Map\
    \ Table.  An MPEG-2 PSI control table that associates\n   the PID values used\
    \ by the set of TS Logical Channels/Streams that\n   comprise a program [ISO-MPEG].\
    \  The PID value which is used to send\n   the PMT for a specific program is defined\
    \ by an entry in the PAT.\n   PP: Payload Pointer [ISO-MPEG].  An optional one\
    \ byte pointer that\n   directly follows the TS Packet header.  It contains the\
    \ number of\n   bytes between the end of the TS Packet header and the start of\
    \ a\n   Payload Unit.  The presence of the Payload Pointer is indicated by\n \
    \  the value of the PUSI bit in the TS Packet header.  The Payload\n   Pointer\
    \ is present in DSM-CC and Table Sections; it is not present in\n   TS Logical\
    \ Channels that use the PES-format.\n   Private Section: A syntactic structure\
    \ constructed in accordance with\n   Table 2-30 of [ISO-MPEG].  The structure\

    \ relating to one\n   or more elementary streams, or a specific MPEG-2 program,\
    \ or the\n   entire TS.  Other Standards bodies (e.g., ETSI, ATSC) have defined\n\
    \   sets of table structures using the private_section structure.  A\n   Private\
    \ Section is transmitted as a sequence of TS Packets using a TS\n   Logical Channel.\
    \  A TS Logical Channel may carry sections from more\n   than one set of tables.\n\
    \   PSI: Program Specific Information [ISO-MPEG].  PSI is used to convey\n   information\

    \ Payload_Unit_Start_Indicator [ISO-MPEG].  A single bit flag\n   carried in the\
    \ TS Packet header.  A PUSI value of zero indicates that\n   the TS Packet does\
    \ not carry the start of a new Payload Unit.  A PUSI\n   value of one indicates\
    \ that the TS Packet does carry the start of a\n   new Payload Unit.  In ULE,\
    \ a PUSI bit set to 1 also indicates the\n   presence of a one byte Payload Pointer\
    \ (PP).\n   Receiver: A piece of equipment that processes the signal from a TS\n\
    \   Multiplex and performs filtering and forwarding of encapsulated PDUs\n   to\
    \ the network-layer service (or bridging module when operating at\n   the link\

  - "3.  Architecture\n   The following sections introduce the components of the MPEG-2\n\
    \   Transmission Network and relate these to a networking framework.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MPEG-2 Transmission Networks
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MPEG-2 Transmission Networks\n   There are many possible topologies for\
    \ MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.\n   A number of example scenarios are briefly\
    \ described below, and the\n   following text relates specific functions to this\
    \ set of scenarios.\n   A) Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery\n   The principal service\
    \ in the Broadcast TV and Radio Delivery scenario\n   is Digital TV and/or Radio\
    \ and their associated data [MMUSIC-IMG,\n   ETSI-IPDC].  Such networks typically\
    \ contain two components: the\n   contribution feed and the broadcast part.  Contribution\
    \ feeds provide\n   communication from a typically small number of individual\
    \ sites\n   (usually at high quality) to the Hub of a broadcast network.  The\n\
    \   traffic carried on contribution feeds is typically encrypted, and is\n   usually\
    \ processed prior to being resent on the Broadcast part of the\n   network.  The\
    \ Broadcast part uses a star topology centered on the Hub\n   to reach a typically\
    \ large number of down-stream Receivers.  Although\n   such networks may provide\
    \ IP transmission, they do not necessarily\n   provide access to the public Internet.\n\
    \   B) Broadcast Networks used as an ISP\n   Another scenario resembles that above,\
    \ but includes the provision of\n   IP services providing access to the public\
    \ Internet.  The IP traffic\n   in this scenario is typically not related to the\
    \ digital TV/Radio\n   content, and the service may be operated by an independent\
    \ operator\n   such as unidirectional file delivery or bidirectional ISP access.\n\
    \   The IP service must adhere to the full system specification used for\n   the\
    \ broadcast transmission, including allocation of PIDs and\n   generation of appropriate\
    \ MPEG-2 control information (e.g., DVB and\n   ATSC SI tables).\n   C) Unidirectional\
    \ Star IP Scenario\n   The Unidirectional Star IP Scenario utilizes a Hub station\
    \ to provide\n   a data network delivering a common bit stream to typically medium-\n\
    \   sized groups of Receivers.  MPEG-2 transmission technology provides\n   the\
    \ forward direction physical and link layers for this transmission;\n   the return\
    \ link (if required) is provided by other means.  IP\n   services typically form\
    \ the main proportion of the transmission\n   traffic.  Such networks do not necessarily\
    \ implement the MPEG-2\n   control plane, i.e., PSI/SI tables.\n   D) Datacast\
    \ Overlay\n   The Datacast Overlay scenario employs MPEG-2 physical and link layers\n\
    \   to provide additional connectivity such as unidirectional multicast\n   to\
    \ supplement an existing IP-based Internet service.  Examples of\n   such a network\
    \ includes IP Datacast to mobile wireless receivers\n   [MMUSIC-IMG].\n   E) Point-to-Point\
    \ Links\n   Point-to-Point connectivity may be provided using a pair of transmit\n\
    \   and receive interfaces supporting the MPEG-2 physical and link\n   layers.\
    \  Typically, the transmission from a sender is received by\n   only one or a\
    \ small number of Receivers.  Examples include the use of\n   transmit/receive\
    \ DVB-S terminals to provide satellite links between\n   ISPs utilising BGP routing.\n\
    \   F) Two-Way IP Networks\n   Two-Way IP networks are typically satellite-based\
    \ and star-based\n   utilising a Hub station to deliver a common bit stream to\
    \ medium-\n   sized groups of receivers.  A bidirectional service is provided\
    \ over\n   a common air-interface.  The transmission technology in the forward\n\
    \   direction at the physical and link layers is MPEG-2, which may also\n   be\
    \ used in the return direction.  Such systems also usually include a\n   control\
    \ plane element to manage the (shared) return link capacity.  A\n   concrete example\
    \ is the DVB-RCS system [ETSI-DVBRCS].  IP services\n   typically form the main\
    \ proportion of the transmission traffic.\n   Scenarios A-D employ unidirectional\
    \ MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.\n   For satellite-based networks, these typically\
    \ have a star topology,\n   with a central Hub providing service to large numbers\
    \ of down-stream\n   Receivers.  Terrestrial networks may employ several transmission\n\
    \   Hubs, each serving a particular coverage cell with a community of\n   Receivers.\n\
    \   From an IP viewpoint, the service is typically either unidirectional\n   multicast,\
    \ or a bidirectional service in which some complementary\n   link technology (e.g.,\
    \ modem, Local Multipoint Distribution Service\n   (LMDS), General Packet Radio\
    \ Service (GPRS)) is used to provide the\n   return path from Receivers to the\

    \ TS Multiplex.  The TS Multiplex\n   is forwarded over a physical bearer towards\
    \ one or more Receivers\n   (Figure 3).\n   In a more complex example, the same\
    \ TS may be fed to multiple MPEG-2\n   multiplexors and these may, in turn, feed\
    \ other MPEG-2 multiplexors\n   (remultiplexing).  Remultiplexing may occur in\
    \ several places (and is\n   common in Scenarios A and B of Section 3.1).  One\

    \ physical bearers (TS Multiplex) to one (or more in the case of\n   broadcast/multicast)\

- title: 3.4.  IP Datagram Transmission
  contents:
  - "3.4.  IP Datagram Transmission\n   Packet data for transmission over an MPEG-2\
    \ Transport Multiplex is\n   passed to an Encapsulator, sometimes known as a Gateway.\
    \  This\n   receives Protocol Data Units, PDUs, such as Ethernet frames or IP\n\
    \   packets, and formats each into a Sub-Network Data Unit, SNDU, by\n   adding\
    \ an encapsulation header and trailer (see Section 4).  The\n   SNDUs are subsequently\
    \ fragmented into a series of TS Packets.\n   To receive IP packets over an MPEG-2\
    \ TS Multiplex, a Receiver needs\n   to identify the specific TS Multiplex (physical\
    \ link) and also the TS\n   Logical Channel (the PID value of a logical link).\
    \  It is common for\n   a number of MPEG-2 TS Logical Channels to carry SNDUs;\
    \ therefore, a\n   Receiver must filter (accept) IP packets sent with a number\
    \ of PID\n   values, and must independently reassemble each SNDU.\n   A Receiver\
    \ that simultaneously receives from several TS Logical\n   Channels must filter\
    \ other unwanted TS Logical Channels by employing,\n   for example, specific hardware\
    \ support.  Packets for one IP flow\n   (i.e., a specific combination of IP source\
    \ and destination addresses)\n   must be sent using the same PID.  It should not\
    \ be assumed that all\n   IP packets are carried on a single PID, as in some cable\
    \ modem\n   implementations, and multiple PIDs must be allowed in the\n   architecture.\
    \  Many current hardware filters limit the maximum number\n   of active PIDs (e.g.,\
    \ 32), although if needed, future systems may\n   reasonably be expected to support\
    \ more.\n   In some cases, Receivers may need to select TS Logical Channels from\n\
    \   a number of simultaneously active TS Multiplexes.  To do this, they\n   need\
    \ multiple physical receive interfaces (e.g., radio frequency (RF)\n   front-ends\
    \ and demodulators).  Some applications also envisage the\n   concurrent reception\
    \ of IP Packets over other media that may not\n   necessarily use MPEG-2 transmission.\n\
    \   Bidirectional (duplex) transmission can be provided using an MPEG-2\n   Transmission\
    \ Network by using one of a number of alternate return\n   channel schemes [ETSI-RC].\
    \  Duplex IP paths may also be supported\n   using non-MPEG-2 return links (e.g.,\
    \ in Scenarios B-D of section\n   3.1).  One example of such an application is\
    \ that of UniDirectional\n   Link Routing, UDLR [RFC3077].\n"

    \ an IP packet, or Ethernet frame using the Multi-Protocol\n   Encapsulation (MPE)\
    \ [ETSI-DAT].  An equivalent scheme is also\n   supported in ATSC [ATSC-DAT, ATSC-DATG].\
    \  It allows transmission of\n   IP packets or (by using LLC) Ethernet frames\
    \ by encapsulation within\n   a Table Section (with the format used by the control\
    \ plane associated\n   with the MPEG-2 transmission).  The MPE specification includes\
    \ a set\n   of optional header components and requires decoding of the control\n\
    \   headers.  This processing is suboptimal for Internet traffic, since\n   it\
    \ incurs significant receiver processing overhead and some extra\n   link overhead\
    \ [CLC99].\n   The existing standards carry heritage from legacy implementations.\n\
    \   These have reflected the limitations of technology at the time of\n   their\
    \ deployment (e.g., design decisions driven by audio/video\n   considerations\
    \ rather than IP networking requirements).  IPv6, MPLS,\n   and other network-layer\
    \ protocols are not natively supported.\n   Together, these justify the development\
    \ of a new encapsulation that\n   will be truly IP-centric.  Carrying IP packets\

    \ (PU) in a new TS Packet\n   with a \"payload_unit_start_indicator\" (PUSI) [ISO-MPEG]\
    \ carried in\n   the 4B TS Packet header.  The PUSI is a 1 bit flag that has normative\n\
    \   meaning [ISO-MPEG] for TS Packets that carry PES Packets or PSI/SI\n   data.\n\
    \   When the payload of a TS Packet contains PES data, a PUSI value of\n   '1'\
    \ indicates the TS Packet payload starts with the first byte of a\n   PES Packet.\
    \  A value of '0' indicates that no PES Packet starts in\n   the TS Packet.  If\
    \ the PUSI is set to '1', then one, and only one,\n   PES Packet starts in the\
    \ TS Packet.\n   When the payload of the TS Packet contains PSI data, a PUSI value\
    \ of\n   '1' indicates the first byte of the TS Packet payload carries a\n   Payload\
    \ Pointer (PP) that indicates the position of the first byte of\n   the Payload\
    \ Unit (Table Section) being carried; if the TS Packet does\n   not carry the\
    \ first byte of a Table Section, the PUSI is set to '0',\n   indicating that no\
    \ Payload Pointer is present.\n   Using this PUSI bit, the start of the first\
    \ Payload Unit in a TS\n   Packet is exactly known by the Receiver, unless that\
    \ TS Packet has\n   been corrupted or lost in the transmission.  In which case,\
    \ the\n   payload is discarded until the next TS Packet is received with a PUSI\n\
    \   value of '1'.\n   The encapsulation should allow packing of more than one\
    \ SNDU into the\n   same TS Packet and should not limit the number of SNDUs that\
    \ can be\n   sent in a TS Packet.  In addition, it should allow an IP Encapsulator\n\
    \   to insert padding when there is an incomplete TS Packet payload.  A\n   mechanism\
    \ needs to be identified to differentiate this padding from\n   the case where\
    \ another encapsulated SNDU follows.\n   A combination of the PUSI and a Length\
    \ Indicator (see below) allows\n   an efficient MPEG-2 convergence protocol to\
    \ receive accurate\n   delineation of packed SNDUs.  The MPEG-2 standard [ISO-MPEG]\
    \ does not\n   specify how private data should use the PUSI bit.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Length Indicator
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Length Indicator\n   Most services using MPEG-2 include a length field\
    \ in the Payload Unit\n   header to allow the Receiver to identify the end of\
    \ a Payload Unit\n   (e.g., PES Packet, Section, or an SNDU).\n   When parts of\
    \ more than two Payload Units are carried in the same TS\n   Packet, only the\
    \ start of the first is indicated by the Payload\n   Pointer.  Placement of a\
    \ Length Indicator in the encapsulation header\n   allows a Receiver to determine\

    \ placement also provides the\n   opportunity for the Receiver to pre-allocate\
    \ an appropriate-sized\n   memory buffer to receive the reassembled SNDU.\n  \
    \ A Length Indicator is required, and should be carried in the\n   encapsulation\

    \ rate of routers,\n   there has been a tendency for Internet core routers to\
    \ support MTU\n   values larger than 1500 bytes.  A value of 16 KB is not uncommon\

  - "4.3.  Next Level Protocol Type\n   Any IETF-defined encapsulation protocol should\
    \ identify the payload\n   type being transported (e.g., to differentiate IPv4,\
    \ IPv6, etc).\n   Most protocols use a type field to identify a specific process\
    \ at the\n   next higher layer that is the originator or the recipient of the\n\
    \   payload (SNDU).  This method is used by IPv4, IPv6, and also by the\n   original\
    \ Ethernet protocol (DIX).  OSI uses the concept of a\n   'Selector' for this,\
    \ (e.g., in the IEEE 802/ISO 8802 standards for\n   CSMA/CD [LLC]; although in\
    \ this case, a SNAP (subnetwork access\n   protocol) header is also required for\
    \ IP packets.\n   A Next Level Protocol Type field is also required if compression\n\
    \   (e.g., Robust Header Compression [RFC3095]) is supported.  No\n   compression\
    \ method has currently been defined that is directly\n   applicable to this architecture,\
    \ however the ROHC framework defines a\n   number of header compression techniques\

    \ a limited capacity.\n   Since many MPEG-2 Transmission Networks are wireless,\
    \ the ROHC\n   framework will be directly applicable for many applications.  The\n\
    \   benefit of ROHC is greatest for smaller SNDUs but does imply the need\n  \
    \ for additional processing at the Receiver to expand the received\n   compressed\
    \ packets.  The selected type field should contain\n   sufficient code points\
    \ to support this technique.\n   It is thus a requirement to include a Next Level\
    \ Protocol Type field\n   in the encapsulation header.  Such a field should specify\
    \ values for\n   at least IPv4, IPv6, and must allow for other values (e.g., MAC-level\n\
    \   bridging).\n"
- title: 4.4.  L2 Subnet Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  L2 Subnet Addressing\n   In MPEG-2, the PID carried in the TS Packet header\
    \ is used to\n   identify individual services with the help of SI tables.  This\
    \ was\n   primarily intended as a unidirectional (simplex) broadcast system. \
    \ A\n   TS Packet stream carries either tables or one PES Packet stream\n   (i.e.,\
    \ compressed video or audio).  Individual Receivers are not\n   addressable at\
    \ this level.\n   IPv4 and IPv6 allocate addresses to end hosts and intermediate\n\
    \   systems (routers).  Each system (or interface) is identified by a\n   globally\
    \ assigned address.  ISO uses the concept of a hierarchically\n   structured Network\
    \ Service Access Point (NSAP) address to identify an\n   end host user process\
    \ in an Internet environment.\n   Within a local network, a completely different\
    \ set of addresses for\n   the Network Point of Attachment (NPA) is used; frequently\
    \ these NPA\n   addresses are referred to as Medium Access Control, MAC-level\n\
    \   addresses.  In the Internet they are also called hardware addresses.\n   Whereas\
    \ network layer addresses are used for routing, NPA addresses\n   are primarily\
    \ used for Receiver identification.\n   Receivers may use the NPA of a received\
    \ SNDU to reject unwanted\n   unicast packets within the (software) interface\
    \ driver at the\n   Receiver, but must also perform forwarding checks based on\
    \ the IP\n   address.  IP multicast and broadcast may also filter using the NPA,\n\
    \   but Receivers must also filter unwanted packets at the network layer\n   based\
    \ on source and destination IP addresses.  This does not imply\n   that each IP\
    \ address must map to a unique NPA (more than one IP\n   address may map to the\
    \ same NPA).  If a separate NPA address is not\n   required, the IP address is\
    \ sufficient for both functions.\n   If it is required to address an individual\
    \ Receiver in an MPEG-2\n   transport system, this can be achieved either at the\
    \ network level\n   (IP address) or via a hardware-level NPA address (MAC-address).\
    \  If\n   both addresses are used, they must be mapped in either a static or a\n\
    \   dynamic way (e.g., by an address resolution process).  A similar\n   requirement\
    \ may also exist to identify the PID and TS multiplex on\n   which services are\
    \ carried.\n   Using an NPA address in an MPEG-2 TS may enhance security, in that\
    \ a\n   particular PDU may be targeted for a particular Receiver by\n   specifying\
    \ the corresponding Receiver NPA address.  However, this is\n   only a weak form\
    \ of security, since the NPA filtering is often\n   reconfigurable (frequently\
    \ performed in software), and may be\n   modified by a user to allow reception\
    \ of specified (or all) packets,\n   similar to promiscuous mode operation in\
    \ Ethernet.  If security is\n   required, it should be applied at another place\
    \ (e.g., link\n   encryption, authentication of address resolution, IPsec, transport\n\
    \   level security and/or application level security).\n   There are also cases\
    \ where the use of an NPA is required (e.g., where\n   a system operates as a\
    \ router) and, if present, this should be\n   carried in an encapsulation header\
    \ where it may be used by Receivers\n   as a pre-filter to discard unwanted SNDUs.\
    \  The addresses allocated\n   do not need to conform to the IEEE MAC address\
    \ format.  There are\n   many cases where an NPA is not required, and network\
    \ layer filtering\n   may be used.  Therefore, a new encapsulation protocol should\
    \ support\n   an optional NPA.\n"

    \ to\n   verify correctness of a received PDU [RFC3819].  Such checks should\n\

  contents:
  - "5.  Address Resolution Functions\n   Address Resolution (AR) provides a mechanism\
    \ that associates layer 2\n   (L2) information with the IP address of a system\
    \ [IPDVB-AR].  Many L2\n   technologies employ unicast AR at the sender: an IP\
    \ system wishing to\n   send an IP packet encapsulates it and places it into an\
    \ L2 frame.  It\n   then identifies the appropriate L3 adjacency (e.g., next hop\
    \ router,\n   end host) and determines the appropriate L2 adjacency (e.g., MAC\n\
    \   address in Ethernet) to which the frame should be sent so that the\n   packet\
    \ gets across the L2 link.\n   The L2 addresses discovered using AR are normally\
    \ recorded in a data\n   structure known as the arp/neighbor cache.  The results\
    \ of previous\n   AR requests are usually cached.  Further AR protocol exchanges\
    \ may be\n   required as communication proceeds to update or re-initialize the\n\
    \   client cache state contents (i.e., purge/refresh the contents).  For\n   stability,\
    \ and to allow network topology changes and client faults,\n   the cache contents\
    \ are normally \"soft state\"; that is, they are aged\n   with respect to time\
    \ and old entries are removed.\n   In some cases (e.g., ATM, X.25, MPEG-2 and\
    \ many more), AR involves\n   finding other information than the MAC address.\
    \  This includes\n   identifying other parameters required for L2 transmission,\
    \ such as\n   channel IDs (VCs in X.25, VCIs in ATM, or PIDs in MPEG-2 TS).\n\
    \   Address resolution has different purposes for unicast and multicast.\n   Multicast\
    \ address resolution is not required for many L2 networks,\n   but is required\
    \ where MPEG-2 transmission networks carry IP multicast\n   packets using more\
    \ than one TS Logical Channel.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Address Resolution for MPEG-2
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Address Resolution for MPEG-2\n   There are three elements to the L2 information\
    \ required to perform AR\n   before an IP packet is sent over an MPEG-2 TS.  These\
    \ are:\n      (i)   A Receiver ID (e.g., a 6B MAC/NPA address).\n      (ii)  A\
    \ PID or index to find a PID.\n      (iii) Tuner information (e.g., Transmit Frequency\
    \ of the\n            physical layer of a satellite/broadcast link\n   Elements\
    \ (ii) and (iii) need to be de-referenced when the MPEG-2\n   Transmission Network\
    \ includes (re)multiplexors that renumber the PID\n   values of the TS Logical\
    \ Channels that they process.  In MPEG-2\n   [ISO-MPEG], this dereferencing is\
    \ via indexes to the information\n   (i.e., the Program Map Table, PMT, which\
    \ is itself indexed via the\n   Program Association Table, PAT).  (Note that PIDs\
    \ are not intended to\n   be end-to-end identifiers.)  However, although remultiplexing\
    \ is\n   common in broadcast TV networks (scenarios A and B), many private\n \
    \  networks do not need to employ multiplexors that renumber PIDs (see\n   Section\
    \ 3.3).\n   The third element (iii) allows an AR client to resolve to a different\n\
    \   MPEG TS Multiplex.  This is used when there are several channels that\n  \
    \ may be used for communication (i.e., multiple outbound/inbound\n   links). \
    \ In a mesh system, this could be used to determine\n   connectivity.  This AR\
    \ information is used in two ways at a Receiver:\n   (i)  AR resolves an IP unicast\
    \ or IPv4 broadcast address to the (MPEG\n        TS Multiplex, PID, MAC/NPA address).\
    \  This allows the Receiver\n        to set L2 filters to let traffic pass to\
    \ the IP layer.  This is\n        used for unicast, and IPv4 subnet broadcast.\n\
    \   (ii) AR resolves an IP multicast address to the (MPEG TS Multiplex,\n    \
    \    PID, MAC/NPA address), and allows the Receiver to set L2 filters\n      \
    \  enabling traffic to pass to the IP layer.  A Receiver in an\n        MPEG-2\
    \ TS Transmission Network needs to resolve the PID value\n        and the tuning\

- title: 5.3.  Unicast Address Scoping
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Unicast Address Scoping\n   In some cases, an MPEG-2 Transmission Network\
    \ may support multiple IP\n   networks.  When this is the case, it is important\
    \ to recognize the\n   context (scope) within which an address is resolved, to\
    \ prevent\n   packets from one addressed scope from leaking into other scopes.\n\
    \   An example of overlapping IP address assignments is the use of\n   private\
    \ unicast addresses (e.g., in IPv4, 10/8 prefix; 172.16/12\n   prefix; 192.168/16\
    \ prefix).  These should be confined to the area to\n   which they are addressed.\n\
    \   There is also a requirement for multicast address scoping (Section\n   6.2).\n\
    \   IP packets with these addresses must not be allowed to travel outside\n  \
    \ their intended scope, and may cause unexpected behaviour if allowed\n   to do\
    \ so.  In addition, overlapping address assignments can arise\n   when using level\
    \ 2 NPA addresses:\n   (i)    The NPA address must be unique within the TS Logical\
    \ Channel.\n          Universal IEEE MAC addresses used in Ethernet LANs are\n\
    \          globally unique.  If the NPA addresses are not globally\n         \
    \ unique, the same NPA address may be re-used by Receivers in\n          different\
    \ addressed areas.\n   (ii)   The NPA broadcast address (all 1s MAC address).\
    \  Traffic with\n          this address should be confined to one addressed area.\n\
    \   Reception of unicast packets destined for another addressed area may\n   lead\
    \ to an increase in the rate of received packets by systems\n   connected via\
    \ the network.  IP end hosts normally filter received\n   unicast IP packets based\
    \ on their assigned IP address.  Reception of\n   the additional network traffic\
    \ may contribute to processing load but\n   should not lead to unexpected protocol\
    \ behaviour.  However, it does\n   introduce a potential Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ opportunity.\n   When the Receiver acts as an IP router, the receipt of such\
    \ an IP\n   packet may lead to unexpected protocol behaviour.  This also provides\n\
    \   a security vulnerability since arbitrary packets may be passed to the\n  \
    \ IP layer.\n"
- title: 5.4.  AR Authentication
  contents:
  - "5.4.  AR Authentication\n   In many AR designs, authentication has been overlooked\
    \ because of the\n   wired nature of most existing IP networks, which makes it\
    \ easy to\n   control hosts that are physically connected [RFC3819].  With wireless\n\
    \   connections, this is changing: unauthorized hosts actually can claim\n   L2\
    \ resources.  The address resolution client (i.e., Receiver) may\n   also need\
    \ to verify the integrity and authenticity of the AR\n   information that it receives.\
    \  There are trust relationships both\n   ways: clients need to know they have\
    \ a valid server and that the\n   resolution is valid.  Servers should perform\
    \ authorisation before\n   they allow an L2 address to be used.\n   The MPEG-2\
    \ Transmission Network may also require access control to\n   prevent unauthorized\

- title: 6.  Multicast Support
  contents:
  - "6.  Multicast Support\n   This section addresses specific issues concerning IPv4\
    \ and IPv6\n   multicast [RFC1112] over MPEG-2 Transmission Networks.  The primary\n\
    \   goal of multicast support will be efficient filtering of IP multicast\n  \
    \ packets by the Receiver, and the mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 multicast\n   addresses\
    \ [RFC3171] to the associated PID value and TS Multiplex.\n   The design should\
    \ permit a large number of active multicast groups,\n   and should minimize the\
    \ processing load at the Receiver when\n   filtering and forwarding IP multicast\
    \ packets.  For example, schemes\n   that may be easily implemented in hardware\
    \ would be beneficial, since\n   these may relieve drivers and operating systems\
    \ from discarding\n   unwanted multicast traffic [RFC3819].\n   Multicast mechanisms\
    \ are used at more than one protocol level.  The\n   upstream router feeding the\
    \ MPEG-2 Encapsulator may forward multicast\n   traffic on the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex\
    \ using a static or dynamic set of\n   groups.  When static forwarding is used,\
    \ the set of IP multicast\n   groups may also be configured or set using SNMP,\
    \ Telnet, etc.  A\n   Receiver normally uses either an IP group management protocol\
    \ (IGMP\n   [RFC3376] for IPv4 or MLD [RFC2710][RFC3810] for IPv6) or a multicast\n\
    \   routing protocol to establish tables that it uses to dynamically\n   enable\
    \ local forwarding of received groups.  In a dynamic case, this\n   group membership\
    \ information is fed back to the sender to enable it\n   to start sending new\
    \ groups and (if required) to update the tables\n   that it produces for multicast\
    \ AR.\n   Appropriate procedures need to identify the correct action when the\n\
    \   same multicast group is available on more than one TS Logical\n   Channel.\
    \  This could arise when different end hosts act as senders to\n   contribute\
    \ IP packets with the same IP group destination address.\n   The correct behaviour\
    \ for SSM [RFC3569] addresses must also be\n   considered.  It may also arise\
    \ when a sender duplicates the same IP\n   group over several TS Logical Channels\
    \ (or even different TS\n   Multiplexes), and in this case a Receiver may potentially\
    \ receive\n   more than one copy of the same packet.  At the IP level, the\n \
    \  host/router may be unaware of this duplication.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Multicast AR Functions
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Multicast AR Functions\n   The functions required for multicast AR may\
    \ be summarized as:\n   (i)  The Sender needs to know the L2 mapping of a multicast\
    \ group.\n   (ii) The Receiver needs to know the L2 mapping of a multicast group.\n\
    \   In the Internet, multicast AR is normally a mapping function rather\n   than\
    \ a one-to-one association using a protocol.  In Ethernet, the\n   sender maps\
    \ an IP address to an L2 MAC address, and the Receiver uses\n   the same mapping\
    \ to determine the L2 address to set an L2\n   hardware/software filter entry.\n\
    \   A typical sequence of actions for the dynamic case is:\n      L3) Populate\
    \ the IP L3 membership tables at the Receiver.\n      L3) Receivers send/forward\
    \ IP L3 membership tables to the Hub\n      L3) Dynamic/static forwarding at hub/upstream\

    \ L2 multicast filters for IP groups in the\n          membership table.\n   To\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   When the MPEG-2 transmission network is not using\
    \ a wireline network,\n   the normal security issues relating to the use of wireless\
    \ links for\n   transport of Internet traffic should be considered [RFC3819].\n\
    \   End-to-end security (including confidentiality, authentication,\n   integrity\
    \ and access control) is closely associated with the end user\n   assets that\
    \ are protected.  This close association cannot be ensured\n   when providing\
    \ security mechanisms only within a subnetwork (e.g., an\n   MPEG-2 Transmission\
    \ Network).  Several security mechanisms that can\n   be used end-to-end have\
    \ already been deployed in the general Internet\n   and are enjoying increasing\
    \ use.  Important examples include:\n   -  Transport Layer Security (TLS), which\
    \ is primarily used to\n      protect web commerce;\n   -  Pretty Good Privacy\
    \ (PGP) and S/MIME, primarily used to protect\n      and authenticate email and\
    \ software distributions;\n   -  Secure Shell (SSH), used to secure remote access\
    \ and file\n      transfer;\n   -  IPsec, a general purpose encryption and authentication\
    \ mechanism\n      above IP that can be used by any IP application.\n   However,\
    \ subnetwork security is also important [RFC3819] and should\n   be encouraged,\
    \ on the principle that it is better than the default\n   situation, which all\
    \ too often is no security at all.  Users of\n   especially vulnerable subnets\
    \ (such as radio/broadcast networks\n   and/or shared media Internet access) often\
    \ have control over, at\n   most, one endpoint - usually a client - and therefore\
    \ cannot enforce\n   the use of end-to-end mechanisms.\n   A related role for\
    \ subnetwork security is to protect users against\n   traffic analysis, i.e.,\
    \ identifying the communicating parties (by IP\n   or MAC address) and determining\
    \ their communication patterns, even\n   when their actual contents are protected\
    \ by strong end-to-end\n   security mechanisms.  (This is important for networks\
    \ such as\n   broadcast/radio, where eavesdropping is easy.)\n   Encryption performed\
    \ at the Transport Stream (encrypting the payload\n   of all TS-Packets with the\
    \ same PID) encrypts/scrambles all parts of\n   the SNDU, including the layer\
    \ 2 MAC/NPA address.  Encryption at the\n   section level in MPE may also optionally\
    \ encrypt the layer 2 MAC/NPA\n   address in addition to the PDU data [ETSI-DAT].\
    \  In both cases,\n   encryption of the MAC/NPA address requires a Receiver to\
    \ decrypt all\n   encrypted data, before it can then filter the PDUs with the\
    \ set of\n   MAC/NPA addresses that it wishes to receive.  This method also has\n\
    \   the drawback that all Receivers must share a common encryption key.\n   Encryption\
    \ of the MPE MAC address is therefore not permitted in some\n   systems (e.g.,\
    \ [ETSI-DVBRCS]).\n   Where it is possible for an attacker to inject traffic into\
    \ the\n   subnetwork control plane, subnetwork security can additionally\n   protect\
    \ the subnetwork assets.  This threat must specifically be\n   considered for\
    \ the protocols used for subnetwork control functions\n   (e.g., address resolution,\
    \ management, configuration).  Possible\n   threats include theft of service and\
    \ denial of service; shared media\n   subnets tend to be especially vulnerable\
    \ to such attacks [RFC3819].\n   Appropriate security functions must therefore\
    \ be provided for IPDVB\n   control protocols [RFC3819], particularly when the\
    \ control functions\n   are provided above the IP-layer using IP-based protocols.\
    \  Internet\n   level security mechanisms (e.g., IPsec) can mitigate such threats.\n\
    \   In general, End-to-End security is recommended for users of any\n   communication\
    \ path, especially when it includes a wireless/radio or\n   broadcast link, where\
    \ a range of security techniques already exist.\n   Specification of security\
    \ mechanisms at the application layer, or\n   within the MPEG-2 transmission network,\
    \ are the concerns of\n   organisations beyond the IETF.  The complexity of any\
    \ such security\n   mechanisms should be considered carefully so that it will\
    \ not unduly\n   impact IP operations.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Link Encryption
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Link Encryption\n   Link level encryption of IP traffic is commonly used\
    \ in\n   broadcast/radio links to supplement End-to-End security (e.g.,\n   provided\
    \ by TLS, SSH, Open PGP, S/MIME, IPsec).  The encryption and\n   key exchange\
    \ methods vary significantly, depending on the intended\n   application.  For\
    \ example, DVB-S/DVB-RCS operated by Access Network\n   Operators may wish to\
    \ provide their customers (Internet Service\n   Providers, ISP) with security\
    \ services.  Common security services\n   are: terminal authentication and data\
    \ confidentiality (for unicast\n   and multicast) between an encapsulation gateway\
    \ and Receivers.  A\n   common objective is to provide the same level of privacy\
    \ as\n   terrestrial links.  An ISP may also wish to provide end-to-end\n   security\
    \ services to the end-users (based on well-known mechanisms\n   such as IPsec).\n\
    \   Therefore, it is important to understand that both security solutions\n  \
    \ (Access Network Operators to ISP and ISP to end-users) may coexist.\n   MPE\
    \ supports optional link encryption [ETSI-DAT].  A pair of bits\n   within the\
    \ MPE protocol header indicate whether encryption\n   (scrambling) is used.  For\
    \ encrypted PDUs, the header bits indicate\n   which of a pair of previously selected\
    \ encryption keys is to be used.\n   It is recommended that any new encapsulation\
    \ defined by the IETF\n   allows Transport Stream encryption and also supports\
    \ optional link\n   level encryption/authentication of the SNDU payload.  In ULE\n\
    \   [IPDVB-ULE], this may be provided in a flexible way using Extension\n   Headers.\
    \  This requires definition of a mandatory header extension,\n   but has the advantage\
    \ that it decouples specification of the security\n   functions from the encapsulation\
    \ functions.  This method also\n   supports encryption of the NPA/MAC addresses.\n"

- title: 'Appendix A: MPEG-2 Encapsulation Mechanisms'
  contents:
  - "Appendix A: MPEG-2 Encapsulation Mechanisms\n   Transmitting packet data over\
    \ an MPEG-2 transmission network requires\n   that individual PDUs (e.g., IPv4,\
    \ IPv6 packets, or bridged Ethernet\n   Frames) are encapsulated using a convergence\
    \ protocol.  The following\n   encapsulations are currently standardized for MPEG-2\
    \ transmission\n   networks:\n     (i)  Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE).\n\
    \            The MPE specification of DVB [ETSI-DAT] uses private\n          \
    \  Sections for the transport of IP packets and uses\n            encapsulation\
    \ that is similar to the IEEE LAN/MAN standards\n            [LLC].  Data packets\
    \ are encapsulated in datagram sections\n            that are compliant with the\
    \ DSMCC section format for private\n            data.  Some Receivers may exploit\
    \ section processing\n            hardware to perform a first-level filtering\
    \ of the packets\n            that arrive at the Receiver.\n            This encapsulation\
    \ makes use of a MAC-level Network Point of\n            Attachment address. \
    \ The address format conforms to the\n            ISO/IEEE standards for LAN/MAN\
    \ [LLC].  The 48-bit MAC\n            address field contains the MAC address of\
    \ the destination;\n            it is distributed over six 8-bit fields, labelled\n\
    \            MAC_address_1 to MAC_address_6.  The MAC_address_1 field\n      \
    \      contains the most significant byte of the MAC address, while\n        \
    \    MAC_address_6 contains the least significant byte.  How many\n          \
    \  of these bytes are significant is optional and defined by\n            the\
    \ value of the broadcast descriptor table [ETSI-DAT] sent\n            separately\
    \ over another MPEG-2 TS within the TS multiplex.\n            MPE is currently\
    \ a widely deployed scheme.  Due to\n            Investments in existing systems,\
    \ usage is likely to continue\n            in current and future MPEG-2 Transmission\
    \ Networks.  ATSC\n            provides a scheme similar to MPE [ATSC-DAT] with\
    \ some small\n            differences.\n     (ii) Data Piping.\n            The\
    \ Data Piping profile [ETSI-DAT] is a minimum overhead,\n            simple and\
    \ flexible profile that makes no assumptions\n            concerning the format\
    \ of the data being sent.  In this\n            profile, the Receiver is intended\
    \ to provide PID filtering,\n            packet reassembly according to [ETSI-SI],\
    \ error detection,\n            and optional Conditional Access (link encryption).\n\
    \            The specification allows the user data stream to be\n           \
    \ unstructured or organized into packets.  The specific\n            structure\
    \ is transparent to the Receiver.  It may conform to\n            any protocol,\
    \ e.g., IP, Ethernet, NFS, FDDI, MPEG-2 PES,\n            etc.\n     (iii)  Data\
    \ Streaming.\n            The data broadcast specification profile [ETSI-DAT]\
    \ for PES\n            tunnels (Data Streaming) supports unicast and multicast\
    \ data\n            services that require a stream-oriented delivery of data\n\
    \            packets.  This encapsulation maps an IP packet into a single\n  \
    \          PES Packet payload.\n            Two different types of PES headers\
    \ can be selected via the\n            stream_id values [ISO-MPEG].  The private_stream_2\
    \ value\n            permits the use of the short PES header with limited\n  \
    \          overhead, while the private_stream_1 value makes available\n      \
    \      the scrambling control and the timing and clock reference\n           \
    \ features of the PES layer.\n"
