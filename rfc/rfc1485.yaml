- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to\n\
    \   entries in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1.\n   When\
    \ a distinguished name is communicated between to users not using a\n   directory\
    \ protocol (e.g., in a mail message), there is a need to have\n   a user-oriented\
    \ string representation of distinguished name.  This\n   specification defines\
    \ a string format for representing names, which is\n   designed to give a clean\
    \ representation of commonly used names, whilst\n   being able to represent any\
    \ distinguished name.  Please send comments\n   to the author or to the discussion\
    \ group <osi-ds@CS.UCL.AC.UK>.\n"

- title: 1.  Why a notation is needed
  contents:
  - "1.  Why a notation is needed\n   Many OSI Applications make use of Distinguished\
    \ Names (DN) as defined\n   in the OSI Directory, commonly known as X.500 [CCI88].\
    \  This\n   specification assumes familiarity with X.500, and the concept of\n\
    \   Distinguished Name.  It is important to have a common format to be\n   able\
    \ to unambiguously represent a distinguished name.  This might be\n   done to\
    \ represent a directory name on a business card or in an email\n   message.  There\
    \ is a need for a format to support human to human\n   communication, which must\
    \ be string based (not ASN.1) and user\n   oriented.  This notation is targeted\
    \ towards a general user oriented\n   system, and in particular to represent the\
    \ names of humans.  Other\n   syntaxes may be more appropriate for other uses\
    \ of the directory.\n   For example, the OSF Syntax may be more appropriate for\
    \ some system\n   oriented uses.  (The OSF Syntax uses \"/\" as a separator, and\
    \ forms\n   names in a manner intended to resemble UNIX filenames).\n"

- title: 2.1 Goals
  contents:
  - "2.1 Goals\n   The following goals are laid out:\n      o  To provide an unambiguous\
    \ representation of a distinguished\n         name\n      o  To be an intuitive\
    \ format for the majority of names\n      o  To be fully general, and able to\
    \ represent any distinguished\n         name\n      o  To be amenable to a number\
    \ of different layouts to achieve an\n          attractive representation.\n \
    \     o  To give a clear representation of the contents of the\n          distinguished\
    \ name\n"
- title: 2.2 Informal definition
  contents:
  - "2.2 Informal definition\n   This notation is designed to be convenient for common\
    \ forms of name.\n   Some examples are given.  The author's directory distinguished\
    \ name\n   would be written:\n      CN=Steve Hardcastle-Kille, OU=Computer Science,\
    \ O=University\n      College London, C=GB\n   This may be folded, perhaps to\
    \ display in multi-column format.  For\n   example:\n      CN=Steve Hardcastle-Kille,\n\
    \      OU=Computer Science,\n      O=University College London,\n      C=GB\n\
    \   Another name might be:\n      CN=Christian Huitema, O=INRIA, C=FR\n   Semicolon\
    \ (\";\") may be used as an alternate separator.\n      CN=Christian Huitema;\
    \ O=INRIA; C=FR\n   In running text, this would be written as <CN=Christian Huitema;\n\
    \   O=INRIA; C=FR>.  Another example, shows how different attribute types\n  \
    \ are handled:\n      CN=James Hacker,\n      L=Basingstoke,\n      O=Widget Inc,\n\
    \      CN=GB\n   Here is an example of a multi-valued Relative Distinguished Name,\n\
    \   where the namespace is flat within an organisation, and department is\n  \
    \ used to disambiguate certain names:\n      OU=Sales + CN=J. Smith, O=Widget\
    \ Inc., C=US\n   The final example shows quoting of a comma in an Organisation\
    \ name:\n      CN=L. Eagle, O=\"Sue, Grabbit and Runn\", C=GB\n"
- title: 2.3 Formal definition
  contents:
  - "2.3 Formal definition\n   A formal definition can now be given.  The structure\
    \ is specified in\n   a BNF grammar in Figure 1.  This BNF uses the grammar defined\
    \ in RFC\n   822, with the terminals enclosed in <> [Cro82].  This definition\
    \ is\n   in an abstract character set, and so may be written in any character\n\
    \   set supporting the explicitly defined special characters.  The\n   quoting\
    \ mechanism is used for the following cases:\n      o  Strings containing \",\"\
    , \"+\", \"=\"or \"\"\", <CR>, \"<\",\n         \">\", \"#\", or \";\".\n    \
    \  o  Strings with leading or trailing spaces\n      o  Strings containing consecutive\
    \ spaces\n   There is an escape mechanism from the normal user oriented form,\
    \ so\n   that this syntax may be used to print any valid distinguished name.\n\
    \   This is ugly.  It is expected to be used only in pathological cases.\n   There\
    \ are two parts to this mechanism:\n      1.  Attributes types are represented\
    \ in a (big-endian) dotted\n          notation.  (e.g., OID.2.6.53).\n      2.\
    \  Attribute values are represented in hexadecimal\n          (e.g.,  #0A56CF).\n\
    \   The keyword specification is optional in the BNF, but mandatory for\n   this\
    \ specification.  This is so that the same BNF may be used for the\n   related\
    \ specification on User Friendly Naming [HK93].  When this\n   specification is\
    \ followed, the attribute type keywords must always be\n   present.  A list of\
    \ valid keywords for well known attribute types\n   used in naming is given in\
    \ Table 1.  This is a list of keywords which\n   must be supported.  These are\
    \ chosen because they appear in common\n   forms of name, and can do so in a place\
    \ which does not correspond to\n   the default schema used.  A register of valid\
    \ keyworkds is maintained\n   by the IANA.\n   Only string type attributes are\
    \ considered, but other attribute\n   syntaxes could be supported locally.  It\
    \ is assumed that the\n   interface will translate from the supplied string into\n\
    \   PrintableString or T.61.\n   The \"+\" notation is used to specify multi-component\
    \ RDNs.  In this\n   case, the types for attributes in the RDN must be explicit.\
    \  The name\n   is presented/input in a little-endian order (most significant\n\
    \   component last).\n   When an address is written in a context where there is\
    \ a need to\n   delimit the entire address (e.g., in free text), it is recommended\n\
    \   that the delimiters <> are used.  The terminator > is a special in\n   the\
    \ notation to facilitate this delimitation.\n   <name> ::= <name-component> (\
