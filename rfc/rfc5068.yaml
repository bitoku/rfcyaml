  - "1.  Introduction\n   The very characteristics that make email such a convenient\n\
    \   communications medium -- its near ubiquity, rapid delivery, low cost,\n  \
    \ and support for exchanges without prior arrangement -- have made it a\n   fertile\
    \ ground for the distribution of unwanted or malicious content.\n   Spam, fraud,\
    \ and worms have become a serious problem, threatening the\n   viability of email\
    \ and costing end users and providers millions of\n   dollars in damages and lost\
    \ productivity.  In recent years,\n   independent operators including enterprises\
    \ and ISPs have turned to a\n   number of different technologies and procedures,\
    \ in an attempt to\n   combat these problems.  The results have been mixed, at\
    \ best.\n   En route to its final destination, email will often travel between\n\
    \   multiple independent providers of email transmission services.  These\n  \
    \ services will generally have no prior arrangement with one another\n   and may\
    \ employ different rules on the transmission.  It is therefore\n   difficult both\
    \ to debug problems that occur in mail transmission and\n   to assign accountability\
    \ if undesired or malicious mail is injected\n   into the Internet mail infrastructure.\n\
    \   Many email authentication technologies exist.  They provide some\n   accountability\
    \ and traceability between disparate networks.  This\n   document aims to build\
    \ upon the availability of these technologies by\n   exploring best practices\
    \ for authenticating and authorizing the first\n   step of an email's delivery,\
    \ from a Mail User Agent (MUA) to a Mail\n   Submission Agent (MSA), known as\
    \ submission.  Without strong\n   practices on email submission, the use of authentication\
    \ technologies\n   elsewhere in the service provides limited benefit.\n   This\
    \ document specifies operational policies to be used for the first\n   step of\
    \ email sending, the submission -- or posting from an MUA to an\n   MSA as defined\
    \ below -- of email into the transmission service.\n   These policies will permit\
    \ continued, smooth operation of Internet\n   email, with controls added to improve\
    \ accountability.  Relaying and\n   delivering employ policies that occur after\
    \ submission and are\n   outside the scope of this document.  The policies listed\
    \ here are\n   appropriate for operators of all sizes of networks and may be\n\
    \   implemented by operators independently, without regard for whether\n   the\
    \ other side of an email exchange has implemented them.\n   It is important to\
    \ note that the adoption of these policies alone\n   will not solve the problems\
    \ of spam and other undesirable email.\n   However, these policies provide a useful\
    \ step in clarifying lines of\n   accountability and interoperability between\
    \ operators.  This helps\n   raise the bar against abusers and provides a foundation\
    \ for\n   additional tools to preserve the utility of the Internet email\n   infrastructure.\n\
    \   NOTE:   This document does not delve into other anti-spam operational\n  \
    \    issues such as standards for rejection of email.  The authors note\n    \
    \  that this could be a valuable effort to undertake and encourage\n      its\
    \ pursuit.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The Internet email architecture distinguishes four message-handling\n\
    \   components:\n   o  Mail User Agents (MUAs)\n   o  Mail Submission Agents (MSAs)\n\
    \   o  Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)\n   o  Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs)\n   At the\
    \ origination end, an MUA works on behalf of end users to create\n   a message\
    \ and perform initial \"submission\" into the transmission\n   infrastructure,\
    \ via an MSA.  An MSA accepts the message submission,\n   performs any necessary\
    \ preprocessing on the message, and relays the\n   message to an MTA for transmission.\
    \  MTAs 'relay' messages to other\n   MTAs, in a sequence reaching a destination\
    \ MDA that, in turn,\n   'delivers' the email to the recipient's inbox.  The inbox\
    \ is part of\n   the recipient-side MUA that works on behalf of the end user to\n\
    \   process received mail.\n   These architectural components are often compressed,\
    \ such as having\n   the same software do MSA, MTA and MDA functions.  However\
    \ the\n   requirements for each of these components of the architecture are\n\
    \   becoming more extensive, so that their software and even physical\n   platform\
    \ separation is increasingly common.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Submission, Relaying, Delivery
  contents:
  - "3.  Submission, Relaying, Delivery\n   Originally the MSA, MTA, and MDA architectural\
    \ components were\n   considered to be a single unit.  This was reflected in the\
    \ practice\n   of having MSA, MTA, and MDA transfers all be performed with SMTP\n\
    \   [RFC2821] [RFC0821], over TCP port 25.  Internet mail permits email\n   to\
    \ be exchanged without prior arrangement and without sender\n   authentication.\
    \  That is, the confirmed identity of the originator of\n   the message is not\
    \ necessarily known by the relaying MTAs or the MDA.\n   It is important to distinguish\
    \ MUA-to-MSA email submission, versus\n   MTA relaying, versus the final MTA-to-MDA\
    \ transition.  Submission\n   typically does entail a pre-established relationship\
    \ between the user\n   of the client and operator of the server; equally, the\
    \ MDA is\n   performing final delivery and can determine that it has an existing\n\
    \   relationship with the recipient.  That is, MSAs and MDAs can take\n   advantage\
    \ of having prior relationships with users in order to\n   constrain their transfer\
    \ activities.\n   Specifically, an MSA can choose to reject all postings from\
    \ MUAs for\n   which it has no existing relationship.  Similarly, an MDA can choose\n\
    \   to reject all mail to recipients for which it has no arrangement to\n   perform\
    \ delivery.  Indeed, both of these policies are already in\n   common practice.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Best Practices for Submission Operation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Best Practices for Submission Operation\n   Submission Port Availability:\n\
    \      If external submissions are supported -- that is, from outside a\n    \
    \  site's administrative domain -- then the domain's MSAs MUST\n      support\
    \ the SUBMISSION port 587 [RFC4409].  Operators MAY\n      standardize on the\
    \ SUBMISSION port for both external AND LOCAL\n      users; this can significantly\
    \ simplify submission operations.\n   Submission Port Use:\n      MUAs SHOULD\
    \ use the SUBMISSION port for message submission.\n   Submission Authentication:\n\
    \      MSAs MUST perform authentication on the identity asserted during\n    \
    \  all mail transactions on the SUBMISSION port, even for a message\n      having\
    \ a RCPT TO address that would not cause the message to be\n      relayed outside\
    \ of the local administrative domain.\n   Submission Authorization:\n      An\
    \ operator of an MSA MUST ensure that the authenticated identity\n      is authorized\
    \ to submit email, based on an existing relationship\n      between the submitting\
    \ entity and the operator.  This requirement\n      applies to all mail submission\
    \ mechanisms (MUA to MSA).\n   Submission Accountability after Submission:\n \
    \     For a reasonable period of time after submission, the message\n      SHOULD\
    \ be traceable by the MSA operator to the authenticated\n      identity of the\
    \ user who sent the message.  Such tracing MAY be\n      based on transactional\
    \ identifiers stored in the headers (received\n      lines, etc.) or other fields\
    \ in the message, on audit data stored\n      elsewhere, or on any other mechanism\
    \ that supports sufficient\n      post-submission accountability.  The specific\
    \ length of time,\n      after message submission, that traceability is supported\
    \ is not\n      specified here.  However, issues regarding transit often occur\
    \ as\n      much as one week after submission.\n      Note that [RFC3848] defines\
    \ a means of recording submission-time\n      information in Received header fields.\
    \  This information can help\n      receive-side analysis software establish a\
    \ sending MSA's\n      accountability and then make decisions about processing\
    \ the\n      message.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Transitioning to Submission Port
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Transitioning to Submission Port\n   In order to promote transition of\
    \ initial message submission from\n   port 25 to port 587, MSAs MUST listen on\
    \ port 587 by default and\n   SHOULD have the ability to listen on other ports.\
    \  MSAs MUST require\n   authentication on port 587 and SHOULD require authentication\
    \ on any\n   other port used for submission.  MSAs MAY also listen on other ports.\n\
    \   Regardless of the ports on which messages are accepted, MSAs MUST NOT\n  \
    \ permit relaying of unauthenticated messages to other domains.  That\n   is,\
    \ they must not be open relays.\n   As a default, MUAs SHOULD attempt to find\
    \ the best possible\n   submission port from a list of alternatives.  The SUBMISSION\
    \ port 587\n   SHOULD be placed first in the list.  Since most MUAs available\
    \ today\n   do not permit falling back to alternate ports, sites SHOULD pre-\n\
    \   configure or encourage their users to connect on the SUBMISSION port\n   587,\
    \ assuming that site supports that port.\n"
- title: 4.  External Submission
  contents:
  - "4.  External Submission\n   An MUA might need to submit mail across the Internet,\
    \ rather than to\n   a local MSA, in order to obtain particular services from\
    \ its home\n   site.  Examples include active privacy protection against third-party\n\
    \   content monitoring, timely processing, and being subject to the most\n   appropriate\
    \ authentication and accountability protocols.  Further,\n   the privacy requirement\
    \ might reasonably include protection against\n   monitoring by the operator of\
    \ the MUA's access network.  This\n   requirement creates a challenge for the\
    \ provider operating the IP\n   network through which the MUA gains access.  It\
    \ makes that provider\n   an involuntary recruit to the task of solving mass-effect\
    \ email\n   problems: When the MUA participates in a problem that affects large\n\
    \   numbers of Internet users, the provider is expected to effect\n   remedies\
    \ and is often expected to prevent such occurrences.\n   A proactive technique\
    \ used by some providers is to block all use of\n   port 25 SMTP for mail that\
    \ is being sent outbound, or to\n   automatically redirect this traffic through\
    \ a local SMTP proxy,\n   except for hosts that are explicitly authorized.  This\
    \ can be\n   problematic for some users, notably legitimate mobile users\n   attempting\
    \ to use their \"home\" MSA, even though those users might\n   already employ\
    \ legitimate, port 25-based authentication.\n   This document offers no recommendation\
    \ concerning the blocking of\n   SMTP port 25 or similar practices for controlling\
    \ abuse of the\n   standard anonymous mail transfer port.  Rather, it pursues\
    \ the\n   mutually constructive benefit of using the official SUBMISSION port\n\
    \   587 [RFC4409].\n   NOTE:   Many established practices for controlling abuse\
    \ of port 25,\n      for mail that is being sent outbound, currently do exist.\
    \  These\n      include the proxy of SMTP traffic to local hosts for screening,\n\
    \      combined with various forms of rate limits.  The authors suggest\n    \
    \  that a separate document on this topic would benefit the email\n      operations\
    \ community.\n"

  - "4.1.  Best Practices for Support of External Submissions\n   Open Submission\
    \ Port:\n      Access Providers MUST NOT block users from accessing the external\n\
    \      Internet using the SUBMISSION port 587 [RFC4409].\n   Traffic Identification\
    \ -- External Posting (MSA) Versus Relaying\n   (MX):\n      When receiving email\
    \ from outside their local operational\n      environment, email service providers\
    \ MUST distinguish between\n      unauthenticated email addressed to local domains\
    \ (MX traffic)\n      versus submission-related authenticated email that can be\n\
    \      addressed anywhere (MSA traffic).  This allows the MTA to restrict\n  \
    \    relaying operations, and thereby prevent \"open\" relays.  Note that\n  \
    \    there are situations where this may not apply, such as secondary\n      MXs\
    \ and related implementations internal to an operator's network\n      and within\
    \ their control.\n   Figure 1 depicts a local user (MUA.l) submitting a message\
