- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP\n\
    \   networks.  Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via the\n   Hello\
    \ subprotocol.  Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-\n   way connectivity\
    \ within time.  When a router restarts its OSPF\n   software, it may not know\
    \ its neighbors.  If such a router sends a\n   Hello packet on an interface, its\
    \ neighbors are going to reset the\n   adjacency, which may not be desirable in\
    \ certain conditions.\n   This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism that\
    \ allows OSPF\n   routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process.\
    \  Note\n   that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.  The\n\
    \   mechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful\n   OSPF\
    \ Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence.  It is\n   implemented/supported\
    \ by at least one major vendor and is currently\n   deployed in the field.  The\
    \ purpose of this document is to capture\n   the details of this mechanism for\
    \ public use.  This mechanism is not\n   an IETF standard.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   While performing a graceful restart of OSPF software [RFC3623],\n\
    \   routers need to prevent their neighbors from resetting their\n   adjacencies.\
    \  However, after a reload, routers may not be aware of\n   the neighbors they\
    \ had adjacencies with in their previous\n   incarnations.  If such a router sends\
    \ a Hello packet on an interface\n   and this packet does not list some neighbors,\
    \ those neighbors will\n   reset the adjacency with the restarting router.\n \
    \  This document describes a technique that allows restarting routers to\n   inform\
    \ their neighbors that they may not know about some neighbors\n   yet and the\
    \ absence of some router IDs in the Hello packets should be\n   ignored.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Proposed Solution\n   With this Restart Signaling Solution, a new bit, called\
    \ RS (restart\n   signal), is introduced into the Extended Options (EO) TLV in\
    \ the\n   Link-Local Signaling (LLS) block (see [RFC4813]).  The value of this\n\
    \   bit is 0x00000002; see Figure 1 below.\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-\

- title: 2.1.  Sending Hello Packets with the RS-bit Set
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Sending Hello Packets with the RS-bit Set\n   OSPF routers should set the\
    \ RS-bit in the EO-TLV attached to a Hello\n   packet when it is not known that\
    \ all neighbors are listed in this\n   packet, but the restarting router wants\
    \ them to preserve their\n   adjacencies.  The RS-bit must not be set in Hello\
    \ packets longer than\n   RouterDeadInterval seconds.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Receiving Hello Packets with the RS-Bit Set
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Receiving Hello Packets with the RS-Bit Set\n   When an OSPF router receives\
    \ a Hello packet containing the LLS block\n   with the EO-TLV that has the RS-bit\
    \ set, the router should skip the\n   two-way connectivity check with the announcing\
    \ neighbor (i.e., the\n   router should not generate a 1-WayReceived event for\
    \ the neighbor if\n   it does not find its own router ID in the list of neighbors\
    \ as\n   described in Section 10.5 of [RFC2328]), provided that the neighbor\n\
    \   Finite State Machine (FSM) for this neighbor is in the Full state.\n   The\
    \ router should also send a unicast Hello back to the sender in\n   reply to a\
    \ Hello packet with RS-bit set.  This is to speed up\n   learning of previously\
    \ known neighbors.  When sending such a reply\n   packet, care must be taken to\
    \ ensure that the RS-bit is clear in it.\n   Two additional fields are introduced\
    \ in the neighbor data structure:\n   RestartState flag and ResyncTimeout timer.\
    \  RestartState flag\n   indicates that a Hello packet with the RS-bit set has\
    \ been received\n   and the local router expects its neighbor to go through the\
    \ Link\n   State Database (LSDB) resynchronization procedure using [RFC4811].\n\
    \   ResyncTimeout is a single-shot timer limiting the delay between the\n   first\
    \ seen Hello packet with the RS-bit set and initialization of the\n   LSDB resynchronization\
    \ procedure.  The length of ResyncTimeout timer\n   is RouterDeadInterval seconds.\n\
    \   When a Hello packet with the RS-bit set is received and RestartState\n   flag\
    \ is not set for the neighbor, the router sets RestartState flag\n   and starts\
    \ ResyncTimeout timer.  If ResyncTimeout expires,\n   RestartState flag is cleared\
    \ and a 1-WayReceived event is generated\n   for the neighbor.  If, while ResyncTimeout\
    \ timer is running, the\n   neighbor starts LSDB resynchronization procedure using\
    \ [RFC4811],\n   ResyncTimeout timer is canceled.  The router also clears RestartState\n\
    \   flag on completion of the LSDB resynchronization process.\n   Two or more\
    \ routers on the same segment cannot have Hello packets\n   with the RS-bit set\
    \ at the same time, as can be the case when two or\n   more routers restart at\
    \ about the same time.  In such a scenario, the\n   routers should clear the RestartState\
    \ flag, cancel the ResyncTimeout\n   timer, and generate a 1-WayReceived event.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Ensuring Topology Stability
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Ensuring Topology Stability\n   Under certain circumstances, it might be\
    \ desirable to stop announcing\n   the restarting router as fully adjacent if\
    \ this may lead to possible\n   routing loops.  In order to provide this functionality,\
    \ a\n   configurable option is provided on the neighboring routers that\n   instructs\
    \ the OSPF process to follow the logics described below.\n   When an OSPF router\
    \ schedules a routing table calculation due to a\n   change in the contents of\
    \ its LSDB, it should also reset all\n   adjacencies with restarting routers (those\
    \ with RestartState set to\n   TRUE) by clearing the RestartState neighbor flags,\
    \ canceling\n   ResyncTimeout timers (if running), and generating the 1-WayReceived\n\
    \   events for the neighbor FSMs.\n"
- title: 3.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.  Backward Compatibility\n   The described technique requires cooperation from\
    \ neighboring\n   routers.  However, if neighbors do not support this technique,\
    \ they\n   will just reset the adjacency.\n"
