  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2369] defines a number of header fields that can be\
    \ added to\n   Internet messages such as those sent by email distribution lists\
    \ or\n   in netnews [RFC1036].  One of them is the List-Archive header field\n\
    \   that describes how to access archives for the list.  This allows\n   access\
    \ to the archives as a whole, but not an individual message.\n   There is often\
    \ a need or desire to refer to the archived form of a\n   single message.  For\
    \ more detailed usage scenarios, please see\n   Section 3.3.  This memo defines\
    \ a new header, Archived-At, to refer\n   to a single message at an archived location.\
    \  This provides quick\n   access to the location of a mailing list message in\
    \ the list archive.\n   It can also be used independently of mailing lists, for\
    \ example in\n   connection with legal requirements to archive certain messages.\n\
    \   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n  \
    \ \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    ,\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Syntax\n   For the Archived-At header field, the field name is \"Archived-At\"\
    .\n   The field body consist of a URI [STD66] enclosed in angle brackets\n   ('<',\
    \ '>').  The URI MAY contain folding whitespace (FWS, [RFC2822]),\n   which is\
    \ ignored.  Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) MUST NOT insert\n   whitespace within\
    \ the angle brackets, but client applications SHOULD\n   ignore any whitespace,\
    \ which might have been inserted by poorly\n   behaved MTAs.  The URI points to\
    \ an archived version of the message.\n   See Section 3.1 for more details.\n\
    \   This header field is subject to the encoding and character\n   restrictions\
    \ for mail headers as described in [RFC2822].\n   More formally, the header field\
    \ is defined as follows in Augmented\n   BNF (ABNF) according to [RFC4234]:\n\
    \      archived-at = \"Archived-At:\" [FWS] \"<\" folded-URI \">\" CRLF\n    \
    \  folded-URI  = <URI, but free insertion of FWS permitted>\n   where URI is defined\
    \ in [STD66], and CRLF and FWS are defined in\n   [RFC2822].\n   To convert a\
    \ folded-URI to a URI, first apply standard [RFC2822]\n   unfolding rules (replacing\
    \ FWS with a single SP), and then delete any\n   remaining un-encoded SP characters.\n\
    \   This syntax is kept simple in that only one URI per header field is\n   allowed.\
    \  In this respect, the syntax is different from [RFC2369].\n   Also, comments\
    \ are not allowed.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Multiple Archived-At Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Multiple Archived-At Header Fields\n   Each Archived-At header field only\
    \ contains a single URI.  If it is\n   desired to list multiple URIs where an\
    \ archived copy of the message\n   can be found, a separate Archived-At field\
    \ per URI is required.\n   Multiple Archived-At header fields with the same URI\
    \ SHOULD be\n   avoided.  An Archived-At header field SHOULD only be created if\
    \ the\n   message is actually being made available at the URI given in the\n \
    \  header field.\n   If a message is forwarded from a list to a sublist and both\
    \ lists\n   support adding the Archived-At header field, then the sublist SHOULD\n\
    \   add a new Archived-At header field without removing the already\n   existing\
    \ one(s), unless the header field is exactly the same as an\n   already existing\
    \ one, in which case the new header field SHOULD NOT\n   be added.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Interaction with Message Fragmentation and Reassembly
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Interaction with Message Fragmentation and Reassembly\n   [RFC2046] allows\
    \ for the fragmentation and reassembly of messages.\n   Archived-At header fields\
    \ are to be treated in the same way as\n   Comments header fields, i.e., copied\
    \ to the first fragment message\n   header on fragmentation and back from there\
    \ to the header of the\n   reassembled message.\n   This treatment has been chosen\
    \ for compatibility with existing\n   infrastructure.  It means that Archived-At\
    \ header fields in the first\n   fragment message MAY refer to an archived version\
    \ of the whole,\n   unfragmented message.  To avoid confusion, Archived-At headers\
    \ SHOULD\n   NOT be added to fragment messages.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Syntax Extension for Internationalized Message Headers
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Syntax Extension for Internationalized Message Headers\n   There are some\
    \ efforts to allow non-ASCII text directly in message\n   header field bodies.\
    \  In such contexts, the URI non-terminal in the\n   syntax defined in Section\
    \ 2.1 is to be replaced by an\n   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)\
    \ as defined in [RFC3987].\n   The specifics of the actual octet encoding of the\
    \ IRI will follow the\n   rules for general direct encoding of non-ASCII text.\
    \  For conversion\n   between IRIs and URIs, the procedures defined in [RFC3987]\
    \ are to be\n   applied.\n"
- title: 2.5.  The X-Archived-At Header Field
  contents:
  - "2.5.  The X-Archived-At Header Field\n   For backwards compatibility, this document\
    \ also describes the\n   X-Archived-At header field, a precursor of the Archived-At\
    \ header\n   field.  The X-Archived-At header field MAY also be parsed, but SHOULD\n\
    \   not be generated.\n   The following is the syntax of the X-Archived-At header\
    \ field in ABNF\n   according to [RFC4234] (which also defines SP):\n      obs-archived-at\
    \ = \"X-Archived-At:\"  SP URI CRLF\n   The X-Archived-At header field does not\
    \ allow whitespace inside URI.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Formats of Archived Message
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Formats of Archived Message\n   There is no restriction on the format used\
    \ to serve the archived\n   message from the URI in an Archived-At header field.\
    \  It is expected\n   that in many cases, the archived message will be served\
    \ as (X)HTML,\n   as plain text, or in its original form as message/rfc822 [RFC2046].\n\
    \   Some forms of URIs may imply the format in which the archived message\n  \
    \ is served, although this should not be relied upon.\n   If the protocol used\
    \ to retrieve the message allows for content\n   negotiation, then it is also\
    \ possible to serve the archived message\n   in several different formats.  As\
    \ an example, an HTTP URI in an\n   Archived-At header may make it possible to\
    \ serve the archived message\n   both as text/html for human consumption in a\
    \ browser and as\n   message/rfc822 for use by a mail user agent (MUA) without\
    \ loss of\n   information.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Implementation Considerations\n   Mailing list expanders and email archives\
    \ are often separate pieces\n   of software.  It may therefore be difficult to\
    \ create an Archived-At\n   header field in the mailing list expander software.\n\
    \   One way to address this difficulty is to have the mailing list\n   expander\
    \ software generate an unambiguous URI, e.g., a URI based on\n   the message identifier\
    \ of the incoming email, and to set up the\n   archiving system so that it redirects\
    \ requests for such URIs to the\n   actual messages.  If the email does not contain\
    \ a message identifier,\n   a unique identifier can be generated.\n   Such a system\
    \ has been implemented and is in productive use at W3C.\n   As an example, the\
    \ URI\n   \"http://www.w3.org/mid/0I5U00G08DFGCR@mailsj-v1.corp.adobe.com\",\n\
    \   containing the significant part of the message identifier\n   \"<0I5U00G08DFGCR@mailsj-v1.corp.adobe.com>\"\
    , is redirected to the URI\n   of this message in the W3C mailing-list archive\
    \ at\n   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2004Oct/0017.html.\n   Source\
    \ code for this implementation is available at\n   http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/search/,\
    \ in particular\n   http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/search/cgi/mid.pl and\n   http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/search/bin/msgid-db.pl.\
    \  These locations may\n   be subject to change.\n   When using the message identifier\
    \ to create an address for the\n   archived mail, care has to be taken to escape\
    \ characters in the\n   message identifier that are not allowed in the URI, or\
    \ to remove\n   them, as done above for the \"<\" and \">\" delimiters.\n   Implementations\
    \ such as that described above can introduce a security\n   issue.  Somebody might\
    \ deliberately reuse a message identifier to\n   break the link to a message.\
    \  This can be addressed by checking\n   incoming message identifiers against\
    \ those of the messages already in\n   the archive and discarding incoming duplicates,\
    \ by checking the\n   content of incoming duplicates and discarding them if they\
    \ are\n   significantly different from the first message, by offering multiple\n\
    \   choices in the response to the URI, or by using some authentication\n   mechanism\
    \ on incoming messages.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Usage Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Usage Considerations\n   It may at first seem strange to have a pointer\
    \ to an archived form of\n   a message in a header field of that same message.\
    \  After all, if one\n   has the message, why would one need a pointer to it?\
    \  It turns out\n   that such pointers can be extremely useful.  This section\
    \ describes\n   some of the scenarios for their use.\n   A user may want to refer\
    \ to messages in a non-message context, such\n   as on a Web page, in an instant\
    \ message, or in a phone conversation.\n   In such a case, the user can extract\
    \ the URI from the Archived-At\n   header field, avoiding the search for the correct\
    \ message in the\n   archive.\n   A user may want to refer to other messages in\
    \ a message context.\n   Referring to a single message is often done by replying\
    \ to that\n   message.  However, when referring to more than one message, providing\n\
    \   pointers to archived messages is a widespread practice.  The\n   Archived-At\
    \ header field makes it easier to provide these pointers.\n   A user may want\
    \ to find messages related to a message at hand.  The\n   user may not have received\
    \ the related messages, and therefore needs\n   to use an archive.  The user may\
    \ also prefer finding related messages\n   in the archive rather than in her MUA,\
    \ because messages in archives\n   may be linked in ways not provided by the MUA.\
    \  The Archived-At\n   header field provides a link to the starting point in the\
    \ archive\n   from which to find related messages.\n   Please note that in the\
    \ above usage scenarios, it is mostly the human\n   reader, rather than the email\
    \ client software, that makes use of the\n   URI in the Archived-At header.  However,\
    \ this does not rule out the\n   use of the URI in the Archived-At header by the\
    \ email client or other\n   software if such use is found helpful.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are many potential security issues when\
    \ activating and\n   dereferencing a URI.  For more details, including some\n\
    \   countermeasures, please see [STD66].  In the context of this\n   proposal,\
    \ the following are particularly relevant: An intruder may\n   get access to the\
    \ message transmission and be able to insert a URI\n   pointing to some malicious\
    \ content.  This can be addressed by using a\n   secured way of message transmission.\
    \  Also, somebody may be able to\n   construct a message that is harmless when\
    \ received directly, but that\n   produces problems when accessed via the URI.\
    \  One reason for this may\n   be the format used in the archive, where some content\
    \ was not\n   adequately escaped.  This can be addressed by using adequate\n \
    \  escaping.\n   The Archived-At header field points to some archived form of\
    \ the\n   message itself.  This in turn may contain the Archived-At field.\n \
    \  This creates a potential for a denial-of-service attack on the server\n   pointed\
    \ to by the URI in the Archived-At header field.  The\n   conditions are that\
    \ the archived form of the message is downloaded\n   automatically, and that further\
    \ URIs in that message are followed and\n   downloaded recursively without checking\
    \ for already downloaded\n   resources.  However, this kind of scenario can easily\
    \ be avoided by\n   implementations.  First, the URI in the Archived-At header\
    \ field\n   should not be dereferenced automatically.  Second, appropriate\n \
    \  measures for loop detection should be used.\n   In Section 3.2, an attack is\
    \ described that may break a URI to a\n   message by introducing a new message\
    \ with the same message\n   identifier.  Possible countermeasures are also discussed.\n"
