    \   PINT services are an emerging set of new Internet based applications\n   where\
    \ voice (and fax) requests to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone\n   Network)\
    \ are carried over the Internet.  RFC 2458 [1] gives a good\n   introduction to\
    \ the (pre-standard) PINT architecture and services.\n   It also has examples\
    \ of some of the early implementations of pre-\n   PINT.\n   This document defines\
    \ a MIB which contains the elements for\n   monitoring the performance of a PINT\
    \ based service.  The MIB consists\n   of details of the four basic PINT services\
    \ and their performance\n   statistics measured under various criteria.\n   It\
    \ is not the purpose of this MIB to enable management of the PINT\n   networking\
    \ elements.  We are concerned only with the PINT specific\n   performance parameters.\
    \  While it is understood that PINT service\n   performance is closely related\
    \ to host and network performance, they\n   are not addressed here.\n2. The SNMP\
    \ Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of\
    \ five major\n   components:\n    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC\
    \ 2571 [2].\n    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for\
    \ the\n        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n     \
    \   STD 16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].\n        The\
    \ second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,\n        RFC 2578 [6],\
    \ RFC 2579 [7] and RFC 2580 [8].\n    o   Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information.  The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of\
    \ the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and\n    \
    \    RFC 1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and\n        RFC 2574 [13].\n\
    \    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n    \
    \    first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol\n        operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [14].\n    o   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and\n        the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n        [16].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable\n\
    \   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n   readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n3. The\
    \ need for PINT services monitoring MIB\n   Traditionally voice (and fax) requests\
    \ originate and terminate inside\n   a PSTN network.  This network is well known\
    \ for robust handling of\n   the requests, in terms of availability and security.\
    \  However when\n   the requests originate from the Internet there is a concern\
    \ both on\n   the part of the user as well as the provider about issues like\n\
    \   reliable forwarding of the call requests to the PINT gateway under\n   various\
    \ network conditions, user/host authentication, secure handling\n   of the user\
    \ information etc.  Performance and security management\n   becomes all the more\
    \ important where PINT services cross multiple\n   administrative domains (or\
    \ providers).\n   This MIB is an attempt to list the parameters that need to be\n\
    \   monitored on an user, PINT client, PINT server and PINT gateway\n   basis.\n\
    \   (PINT services, their invocation methods/protocols and security\n   issues\
    \ associated with the PINT architecture are discussed in detail\n   in [18]).\n\
    4. PINT MIB - Overview\n   Following is a list of some explanations on the MIB\
    \ definitions that\n   we have chosen to construct.\n    o   The basic purpose\
    \ of this MIB is to monitor the access to PINT\n        services both from the\
    \ performance and security point of view.\n        Information may pertain to\
    \ a certain user or his/her system\n        (PINT client) or the system providing\
    \ the PINT services (PINT\n        server) or the PINT gateway that forwards the\
    \ call to the PSTN\n        network.\n    o   We chose to build the configuration\
    \ table as an extension of the\n        Application MIB - RFC 2287 [19] using\
    \ the augments construct.\n        Server location and contact might be retrieved\
    \ from the standard\n        MIB-II sysLocation and sysContact objects.  There\
    \ is no need to\n        replicate this information in the PINT MIB.  However,\
    \ the PINT\n        administrator may be a different person than the sysadmin\
    \ with\n        global responsibilities, thus a pintSysContact object is\n   \
    \     defined.\n    o   We chose to monitor the gateway connections from the PINT\n\
    \        server.  While the agent runs in the PINT servers, the\n        connections\
    \ to the gateways might need to be monitored in order\n        to understand what\
    \ goes on.  We placed them in a separate MIB\n        group, and by using MODULE-COMPLIANCE\
    \ clauses, agents that\n        cannot implement this stuff will not be mandated\
    \ to do it.\n    o   There is no traps definition in this MIB module.  Note that\n\
    \        thresholding on counters is always possible by using a standard\n   \
    \     mechanism defined by the Remote Monitoring MIB, that can be\n        referenced\
    \ here.  Some events that may be defined by using this\n        mechanisms:\n\
    \            *  continuous login/authentication failure or refusal from a\n  \
    \             particular client or user\n            *  nuisance call - repeated\
    \ calls (within a specified\n               period) to a number originating from\
    \ the same user\n    o   The client performance and user performance tables may\
    \ be rather\n        resource demanding for an agent implementation.  In some\
    \ MIBs,\n        like the Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIBs, control mechanisms were\n\
    \        built in order to activate those statistics on demand.  If\n        needed,\
    \ a sorting ('topN') mechanism can be designed, so that a\n        sorted view\
    \ of clients or users is presented for the high level\n        debugging.\n  \
    \  o   We built a time-distribution trying to cover both short-lived,\n      \
    \  as well as longer sessions (1-10 secs, 10 secs - 1 min., 1-15\n        min.,\
    \ 15 mins-24 hours, longer).\n    o   PintServerClientAddress is defined as a\
    \ SnmpAdminString.  It may\n        include an IpAddress and/or name, but we preferred\
    \ to minimize\n        the number of indices at this stage, and keep a human-readable\n\
    \        format at the same time.\n    o   We define pintServerUserIdName as the\
    \ UserId.  This UserId needs\n        to be unique across multiple PINT servers\
    \ and gateways\n        (depending on the architecture) and is mapped to the SessionId.\n\
    \        One way to achieve this uniqueness is by appending clientId to\n    \
    \    the UserId string before sending to the PINT server.  The\n        SessionId\
    \ could then be a combination of this new UserId and a\n        timestamp.\n5.\

    \ thank Igor Faynberg for his encouragement\n   to produce this work.\n7.  Security\
    \ Considerations\n   There is only one management object defined in this MIB that\
    \ has a\n   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write (pintSysContact).  There are no\n\
    \   read-create objects.  This read-write object may be considered\n   sensitive\
    \ or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support\n   for SET operations\
    \ in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection can have a negative\
    \ effect on network operations.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this\
    \ MIB that may contain\n   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective.\
    \  One\n   could be the customer identification (UserIdName).  Also information\n\
    \   on PINT services performance might itself be need to be guarded.  It\n   is\
    \ thus important to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly\
    \ to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network\
    \ via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [13] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [16] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to\
    \ those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n\
    \   (change/create/delete) them.\n8. IANA Considerations\n   All extensions to\
    \ the values listed in this MIB must be done through\n   Standards Action processes\
    \ as defined in RFC 2434 [20].\n9. Intellectual Property\n   The IETF takes no\
    \ position regarding the validity or scope of any\n   intellectual property or\
    \ other rights that might be claimed to\n   pertain to the implementation or use\
    \ of the technology described in\n   this document or the extent to which any\
    \ license under such rights\n   might or might not be available; neither does\
    \ it represent that it\n   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information\
    \ on the\n   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and\n\
    \   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of\n   claims\
    \ of rights made available for publication and any assurances of\n   licenses\
    \ to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to\n   obtain a general\
    \ license or permission for the use of such\n   proprietary rights by implementors\
    \ or users of this specification can\n   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.\n\
    \   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any\n   copyrights,\
    \ patents or patent applications, or other proprietary\n   rights which may cover\
    \ technology that may be required to practice\n   this standard.  Please address\
    \ the information to the IETF Executive\n   Director.\n10. References\n   [1]\
