- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Draft Standard level, and requirements for standards\
    \ to meet it,\n   are described in [RFC2026].  For Draft Standard, not only must\
    \ two\n   implementations interoperate, but also documentation (the report)\n\
    \   must be provided to the IETF.  The entire paragraph covering this\n   documentation\
    \ reads:\n      The Working Group chair is responsible for documenting the\n \
    \     specific implementations which qualify the specification for Draft\n   \
    \   or Internet Standard status along with documentation about testing\n     \
    \ of the interoperation of these implementations.  The documentation\n      must\
    \ include information about the support of each of the\n      individual options\
    \ and features.  This documentation should be\n      submitted to the Area Director\
    \ with the protocol action request.\n      (see Section 6)\n   Moving documents\
    \ along the standards track can be an important signal\n   to the user and implementor\
    \ communities, and the process of\n   submitting a standard for advancement can\
    \ help improve that standard\n   or the quality of implementations that participate.\
    \  However, the\n   barriers seem to be high for advancement to Draft Standard,\
    \ or at the\n   very least confusing.  This memo may help in guiding people through\n\
    \   one part of advancing specifications to Draft Standard.  It also\n   changes\
    \ some of the requirements made in RFC 2026 in ways that are\n   intended to maintain\
    \ or improve the quality of reports while reducing\n   the burden of creating\
    \ them.\n   Having and demonstrating sufficient interoperability is a gating\n\
    \   requirement for advancing a protocol to Draft Standard.  Thus, the\n   primary\
    \ goal of an implementation report is to convince the IETF and\n   the IESG that\
    \ the protocol is ready for Draft Standard.  This goal\n   can be met by summarizing\
    \ the interoperability characteristics and by\n   providing just enough detail\
    \ to support that conclusion.  Side\n   benefits may accrue to the community creating\
    \ the report in the form\n   of bugs found or fixed in tested implementations,\
    \ documentation that\n   can help future implementors, or ideas for other documents\
    \ or future\n   revisions of the protocol being tested.\n   Different kinds of\
    \ documentation are appropriate for widely deployed\n   standards than for standards\
    \ that are not yet deployed.  Different\n   test approaches are appropriate for\
    \ standards that are not typical\n   protocols: languages, formats, schemas, etc.\
    \  This memo discusses how\n   reports for these standards may vary in Section\
    \ 5.\n   Implementation should naturally focus on the final version of the\n \
    \  RFC.  If there's any evidence that implementations are interoperating\n   based\
    \ on Internet-Drafts or earlier versions of the specification, or\n   if interoperability\
    \ was greatly aided by mailing list clarifications,\n   this should be noted in\
    \ the report.\n   The level of detail in reports accepted in the past has varied\n\
    \   widely.  An example of a submitted report that is not sufficient for\n   demonstrating\
    \ interoperability is (in its entirety): \"A partial list\n   of implementations\
    \ include: Cray SGI Netstar IBM HP Network Systems\n   Convex\".  This report\
    \ does not state how it is known that these\n   implementations interoperate (was\
    \ it through public lab testing?\n   internal lab testing? deployment?).  Nor\
    \ does it capture whether\n   implementors are aware of, or were asked about,\
    \ any features that\n   proved to be problematic.  At a different extreme, reports\
    \ have been\n   submitted that contain a great amount of detail about the test\n\
    \   methodology, but relatively little information about what worked and\n   what\
    \ failed to work.\n   This memo is intended to clarify what an implementation\
    \ report should\n   contain and to suggest a reasonable form for most implementation\n\
    \   reports.  It is not intended to rule out good ideas.  For example,\n   this\
    \ memo can't take into account all process variations such as\n   documents going\
    \ to Draft Standard twice, nor can it consider all\n   types of standards.  Whenever\
    \ the situation varies significantly from\n   what's described here, the IESG\
    \ uses judgement in determining whether\n   an implementation report meets the\
    \ goals above.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Content Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Content Requirements\n   The implementation report MUST identify the author\
    \ of the report, who\n   is responsible for characterizing the interoperability\
    \ quality of the\n   protocol.  The report MAY identify other contributors (testers,\
    \ those\n   who answered surveys, or those who contributed information) to share\n\
    \   credit or blame.  The report MAY provide a list of report reviewers\n   who\
    \ corroborate the characterization of interoperability quality, or\n   name an\
    \ active working group (WG) that reviewed the report.\n   Some of the requirements\
    \ of RFC 2026 are relaxed with this update:\n   o  The report MAY name exactly\
    \ which implementations were tested.  A\n      requirement to name implementations\
    \ was implied by the description\n      of the responsibility for \"documenting\
    \ the specific\n      implementations\" in RFC 2026.  However, note that usually\n\
    \      identifying implementations will help meet the goals of\n      implementation\
    \ reports.  If a subset of implementations was tested\n      or surveyed, it would\
    \ also help to explain how that subset was\n      chosen or self-selected.  See\
    \ also the note on implementation\n      independence below.\n   o  The report\
    \ author MAY choose an appropriate level of detail to\n      document feature\
    \ interoperability, rather than document each\n      individual feature.  See\
    \ note on granularity of features below.\n   o  A contributor other than a WG\
    \ chair MAY submit an implementation\n      report to an Area Director (AD).\n\
    \   o  Optional features that are not implemented, but are important and\n   \
    \   do not harm interoperability, MAY, exceptionally and with approval\n     \
    \ of the IESG, be left in a protocol at Draft Standard.  See\n      Section 5.6\
    \ for documentation requirements and an example of where\n      this is needed.\n\
    \   Note: Independence of implementations is mentioned in the RFC 2026\n     \
    \    requirements for Draft Standard status.  Independent\n         implementations\
    \ should be written by different people at\n         different organizations using\
    \ different code and protocol\n         libraries.  If it's necessary to relax\
    \ this definition, it can\n         be relaxed as long as there is evidence to\
    \ show that success is\n         due more to the quality of the protocol than\
    \ to out-of-band\n         understandings or common code.  If there are only two\n\
    \         implementations of an undeployed protocol, the report SHOULD\n     \
    \    identify the implementations and their \"genealogy\" (which\n         libraries\
    \ were used or where the codebase came from).  If there\n         are many more\
    \ implementations, or the protocol is in broad\n         deployment, it is not\
    \ necessary to call out which two of the\n         implementations demonstrated\
    \ interoperability of each given\n         feature -- a reader may conclude that\
    \ at least some of the\n         implementations of that feature are independent.\n\
    \   Note: The granularity of features described in a specification is\n      \
    \   necessarily very detailed.  In contrast, the granularity of an\n         implementation\
    \ report need not be as detailed.  A report need\n         not list every \"MAY\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", and \"MUST\" in a complete matrix\n         across implementations.\
    \  A more effective approach might be to\n         characterize the interoperability\
    \ quality and testing approach,\n         then call out any known problems in\
    \ either testing or\n         interoperability.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Format\n   The format of implementation and interoperability reports MUST\
    \ be\n   ASCII text with line breaks for readability.  As with Internet-\n   Drafts,\
    \ no 8-bit characters are currently allowed.  It is acceptable,\n   but not necessary,\
    \ for a report to be formatted as an Internet-Draft.\n   Here is a simple outline\
    \ that an implementation report MAY follow in\n   part or in full:\n   Title:\
    \  Titles of implementation reports are strongly RECOMMENDED to\n      contain\
    \ one or more RFC number for consistent lookup in a simple\n      archive.  In\
    \ addition, the name or a common mnemonic of the\n      standard should be in\
    \ the title.  An example might look like\n      \"Implementation Report for the\
    \ Example Name of Some Protocol\n      (ENSP) RFC XXXX\".\n   Author:  Identify\
    \ the author of the report.\n   Summary:  Attest that the standard meets the requirements\

    \    deployment level and where the standard can be found in\n      deployment.\
    \  Call out, and if possible, briefly describe any\n      notably difficult or\
    \ poorly interoperable features and explain why\n      these still meet the requirement.\
    \  Assert any derivative\n      conclusions: if a high-level system is tested\
    \ and shown to work,\n      then we may conclude that the normative requirements\
    \ of that\n      system (all sub-system or lower-layer protocols, to the extent\n\
    \      that a range of features is used) have also been shown to work.\n   Methodology:\
    \  Describe how the information in the report was\n      obtained.  This should\

    \ feature was implemented,\n      tested, and widely interoperable without exception\
    \ and without\n      question\".  If that statement is not true, then this section\n\
    \      should cover whether any features were thought to be problematic.\n   \
    \   Problematic features need not disqualify a protocol from Draft\n      Standard,\
    \ but this section should explain why they do not (e.g.,\n      optional, untestable,\

    \ sections:  Any other justifying or background information can\n      be included\
    \ here.  In particular, any information that would have\n      made the summary\
    \ or methodology sections more than a few\n      paragraphs long may be created\
    \ as a detail section and referenced.\n      In this section, it would be good\
    \ to discuss how the various\n      considerations sections played out.  Were\
    \ the security\n      considerations accurate and dealt with appropriately in\n\
    \      implementations?  Was real internationalization experience found\n    \
    \  among the tested implementations?  Did the implementations have\n      any\
    \ common monitoring or management functionality (although note\n      that documenting\
    \ the interoperability of a management standard\n      might be separate from\
    \ documenting the interoperability of the\n      protocol itself)?  Did the IANA\
    \ registries or registrations, if\n      any, work as intended?\n   Appendix sections:\
    \  It's not necessary to archive test material such\n      as test suites, test\
    \ documents, questionnaire text, or\n      questionnaire responses.  However,\
    \ if it's easy to preserve this\n      information, appendix sections allow readers\
    \ to skip over it if\n      they are not interested.  Preserving detailed test\
    \ information can\n      help people doing similar or follow-on implementation\
    \ reports, and\n      can also help new implementors.\n"
- title: 4.  Feature Coverage
  contents:
  - "4.  Feature Coverage\n   What constitutes a \"feature\" for the purposes of an\
    \ interoperability\n   report has been frequently debated.  Good judgement is\
    \ required in\n   finding a level of detail that adequately demonstrates coverage\
    \ of\n   the requirements.  Statements made at too high a level will result in\n\
    \   a document that can't be verified and hasn't adequately challenged\n   that\
    \ the testing accidentally missed an important failure to\n   interoperate.  On\
    \ the other hand, statements at too fine a level\n   result in an exponentially\
    \ exploding matrix of requirement\n   interaction that overburdens the testers\
    \ and report writers.  The\n   important information in the resulting report would\
    \ likely be hard to\n   find in the sea of detail, making it difficult to evaluate\
    \ whether\n   the important points of interoperability have been addressed.\n\
    \   The best interoperability reports will organize statements of\n   interoperability\
    \ at a level of detail just sufficient to convince the\n   reader that testing\
    \ has covered the full set of requirements and in\n   particular that the testing\
    \ was sufficient to uncover any places\n   where interoperability does not exist.\
    \  Reports similar to that for\n   RTP/RTCP (an excerpt appears below) are more\
    \ useful than an\n   exhaustive checklist of every normative statement in the\n\

    \   Consensus can be a good tool to help determine the appropriate level\n   for\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Deployed Protocols\n   When a protocol is deployed, results obtained from\
    \ laboratory testing\n   are not as useful to the IETF as learning what is actually\
    \ working in\n   deployment.  To this end, it may be more informative to survey\n\
    \   implementors or operators.  A questionnaire or interview can elicit\n   information\
    \ from a wider number of sources.  As long as it is known\n   that independent\
    \ implementations can work in deployment, it is more\n   useful to discover what\
    \ problems exist, rather than gather long and\n   detailed checklists of features\
    \ and options.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Undeployed Protocols
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Undeployed Protocols\n   It is appropriate to provide finer-grained detail\
    \ in reports for\n   protocols that do not yet have a wealth of experience gained\
    \ through\n   deployment.  In particular, some complicated, flexible or powerful\n\
    \   features might show interoperability problems when testers start to\n   probe\
    \ outside the core use cases.  RFC 2026 requires \"sufficient\n   successful operational\
    \ experience\" before progressing a standard to\n   Draft, and notes that:\n \
    \     Draft Standard may still require additional or more widespread\n      field\
    \ experience, since it is possible for implementations based\n      on Draft Standard\
    \ specifications to demonstrate unforeseen\n      behavior when subjected to large-scale\
    \ use in production\n      environments.\n   When possible, reports for protocols\
    \ without much deployment\n   experience should anticipate common operational\

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Schemas, Languages, and Formats\n   Standards that are not on-the-wire\

    \ use judgement in what kind\n   of implementation information is acceptable for\
    \ these kinds of\n   standards.  ABNF (RFC 4234) is an example of a language for\
    \ which an\n   implementation report was filed: it is interoperable in that\n\
    \   protocols are specified using ABNF and these protocols can be\n   successfully\
    \ implemented and syntax verified.  Implementations of\n   ABNF include the RFCs\
    \ that use it as well as ABNF checking software.\n   Management Information Base\
    \ (MIB, [RFC3410]) modules are sometimes\n   documented in implementation reports,\
    \ and examples of that can be\n   found in the archive of implementation reports.\n\

- title: 5.5.  Test Suites
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Test Suites\n   Some automated tests, such as automated test clients, do\
    \ not test\n   interoperability directly.  When specialized test implementations\
    \ are\n   necessary, tests can at least be constructed from real-world protocol\n\
    \   or document examples.  For example:\n   -  ABNF [RFC4234] itself was tested\
    \ by combining real-world examples\n      -- uses of ABNF found in well-known\
    \ RFCs -- and feeding those\n      real-world examples into ABNF checkers.  As\
    \ the well-known RFCs\n      were themselves interoperable and in broad deployment,\
    \ this served\n      as both a deployment proof and an interoperability proof.\n\
    \      [RFC4234] progressed from Proposed Standard through Draft Standard\n  \
    \    to Standard and is obsoleted by [RFC5234].\n   -  Atom [RFC4287] clients\
    \ might be tested by finding that they\n      consistently display the information\
    \ in a test Atom feed,\n      constructed from real-world examples that cover\
    \ all the required\n      and optional features.\n   -  MIB modules can be tested\
    \ with generic MIB browsers, to confirm\n      that different implementations\
    \ return the same values for objects\n      under similar conditions.\n   As a\
    \ counter-example, the automated WWW Distributed Authoring and\n   Versioning\
    \ (WebDAV) test client Litmus\n   (http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/) is of limited\
    \ use in\n   demonstrating interoperability for WebDAV because it tests\n   completeness\
    \ of server implementations and simple test cases.  It\n   does not test real-world\
    \ use or whether any real WebDAV clients\n   implement a feature properly or at\

  contents:
  - "5.6.  Optional Features, Extensibility Features\n   Optional features need not\
    \ be shown to be implemented everywhere.\n   However, they do need to be implemented\
    \ somewhere, and more than one\n   independent implementation is required.  If\

- title: 6.1.  Minimal Implementation Report
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Minimal Implementation Report\n      A large number of SMTP implementations\
    \ support SMTP pipelining,\n      including: (1) Innosoft's PMDF and Sun's SIMS.\
    \ (2) ISODE/\n      MessagingDirect's PP. (3) ISOCOR's nPlex. (4) software.com's\n\
    \      post.office. (5) Zmailer. (6) Smail. (7) The SMTP server in\n      Windows\
    \ 2000.  SMTP pipelining has been widely deployed in these\n      and other implementations\
    \ for some time, and there have been no\n      reported interoperability problems.\n\
    \   This implementation report can also be found at\n   http://www.ietf.org//iesg/implementation/report-smtp-pipelining.txt\n\
    \   but the entire report is already reproduced above.  Since SMTP\n   pipelining\
    \ had no interoperability problems, the implementation\n   report was able to\
    \ provide all the key information in a very terse\n   format.  The reader can\
    \ infer from the different vendors and\n   platforms that the codebases must,\
    \ by and in large, be independent.\n   This implementation report would only be\
    \ slightly improved by a\n   positive affirmation that there have been probes\
    \ or investigations\n   asking about interoperability problems rather than merely\
    \ a lack of\n   problem reports, and by stating who provided this summary report.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Covering Exceptions
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Covering Exceptions\n   The RFC2821bis (SMTP) implementation survey asked\
    \ implementors what\n   features were not implemented.  The VRFY and EXPN commands\
    \ showed up\n   frequently in the responses as not implemented or disabled.  That\n\
    \   implementation report might have followed the advice in this\n   document,\
    \ had it already existed, by justifying the interoperability\n   of those features\
    \ up front or in an \"exceptions\" section if the\n   outline defined in this\
    \ memo were used:\n      VRFY and EXPN commands are often not implemented or are\
    \ disabled.\n      This does not pose an interoperability problem for SMTP because\n\
    \      EXPN is an optional features and its support is never relied on.\n    \
    \  VRFY is required, but in practice it is not relied on because\n      servers\
    \ can legitimately reply with a non-response.  These\n      commands should remain\
    \ in the standard because they are sometimes\n      used by administrators within\
    \ a domain under controlled\n      circumstances (e.g. authenticated query from\
    \ within the domain).\n      Thus, the occasional utility argues for keeping these\
    \ features,\n      while the lack of problems for end-users means that the\n \
    \     interoperability of SMTP in real use is not in the least degraded.\n"
