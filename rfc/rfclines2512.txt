This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
A separate memo [16] defines managed objects, in a manner independent of the type of network, for controlling the selection, collection and storage of accounting information into files for later retrieval via a file transfer protocol.
This memo defines a set of ATM specific accounting information which can be collected for connections on ATM networks.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
In [16], the items of accounting data to be collected are specified as a set of objects.
Which objects are contained in such a set is selectable by an administrator through the specification of one or more (subtree, list) tuples, where the set of objects to be collected is the union of the subsets specified by each tuple: 'subtree' specifies a OBJECT IDENTIFIER value such that every object in the subset is named by the subtree's value appended with a single additional sub identifier. '
list' specifies an OCTET STRING value, such that if the N th bit of the string's value is set then the the subset contains the object named by appending N as a single additional sub  identifier to the subtree.
This memo specifies such a subtree containing a set of objects defining items of accounting information which are applicable to ATM connections.
Note that all of the objects defined here have a MAX ACCESS clause of not accessible, since their purpose is not to be read/written by SNMP, but rather, to be the syntax and semantics of the set of information which can be represented within a single (subtree, list) tuple.

Definitions of objects for use in specifying ATM accounting   data to be collected
"This identifier defines a subtree under which various objects are defined such that a set of objects to be collected as ATM accounting data can be specified as a (subtree, list) tuple using this identifier as the subtree."
In each case the semantics of the object are interpreted with   respect to the creation/storage of an accounting record for a   particular connection on a particular interface.
current DESCRIPTION "The type of connection."
An indication of whether the connection is point to point or point to multipoint."
current DESCRIPTION "A textual name for the interface on which the data for the connection was collected.
If the local SNMP agent supports the object ifName, the value of this object must be identical to that of ifName in the conceptual row of the ifTable corresponding to this interface."
current DESCRIPTION "The 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, e.g., via a management set operation to modify the relevant instance of the ifAlias object.
Note that in contrast to ifIndex, ifAlias provides a non volatile 'handle' for the interface, the value of which is retained across agent reboots."
"The VPI used for the connection."
"The VCI used for the connection."
If unknown (e.g., for a PVC), then the value of this object is the zero length string."
If unknown (e.g., for a PVC), then the value of this object is the zero length string."
"The connection's call reference value (e.g., from Q.2931).
If unknown (e.g., for a PVC), then the value of this object is the zero length string."
The time when the connection was established."
The time at which the data in this record was collected."
"The reason why this connection data was collected."
"If the connection data was collected because of the release of an SVC, then this is the cause code in the Release message for the connection; otherwise, this object has the value zero."

} atmAcctngRecordCrc16 OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The value of the CRC 16 checksum (as defined by ISO 3309 (HDLC) and/or ITU X.25) calculated over the accounting record containing this object.
While the mechanism for calculating/encoding the checksum value is specific to the method of encoding the accounting record, an accounting record containing this object is typically generated by initializing the value of this object to the all zeros string ('0000'H), with the location of these zeros being saved.
This MIB module defines data items for potential use as accounting information.
Each of these data items is only accessible through a collected accounting file.
After being collected, the accounting data should be protected against modification or unauthorized deletion.
IANA Considerations Prior to publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to make a suitable OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignment.
