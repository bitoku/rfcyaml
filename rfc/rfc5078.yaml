  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3777 ([RFC3777]) is a complete specification of the\
    \ process by\n   which members of the IAB and IESG are selected, confirmed, and\n\
    \   recalled as of the date of its approval.  [RFC3777] includes\n   normative\
    \ requirements for timing allowed for the various steps, and\n   also includes\
    \ an informative appendix, Appendix B, that contains a\n   timeline based on the\
    \ normative text.\n   The normative time requirements in [RFC3777] are end-of-task,\
    \ so\n   adjusting the informative timeline to get an earlier start does not\n\
    \   require changes to the normative text in [RFC3777].\n   In IETF 68, IETF 65,\
    \ and IETF 62 plenary reports, NomCom chairs\n   suggested starting the NomCom\
    \ cycle earlier.  This document describes\n   a timeline that meets this need,\
    \ replacing RFC 3777, Appendix B, and\n   makes no other changes to [RFC3777].\n"
- title: 2.  The Problem
  contents:
  - "2.  The Problem\n   There are several reasons that have been cited for the schedule\n\
    \   pressures reported by recent NomComs.\n   o  A few common practices are not\
    \ accounted for in the Appendix B\n      timeline [RFC3777].  For example, it\
    \ is common to allow a week for\n      notifying unsuccessful nominees before\
    \ the formal announcement is\n      made.  This is not included in the timeline.\n\
    \   o  Some tasks just seem to take longer than the minimum interval.\n      For\
    \ example, a public \"call for volunteers\" must be open for 30\n      days, but\
    \ the list of voting NomCom participants probably isn't\n      announced at midnight\
    \ on the 30th day.  Anecdotal evidence is that\n      allowing about 6 weeks is\
    \ more consistent with recent experience.\n   o  The NomCom, and the community\
    \ it serves, tends to celebrate a\n      variety of holidays between the third\
    \ IETF and the first IETF of\n      the next year, so people may be out of the\
    \ office, may wait to\n      respond, etc.\n   o  The Appendix B timeline does\
    \ not provide flexibility in case of\n      problems.  For example, the NomCom\
    \ chair \"reset\" the random\n      selection of volunteers for the 2006-2007\
    \ NomCom, requiring\n      another seven-day delay for the announcement of the\
    \ date of random\n      selection.\n   All of these reasons can be accommodated\
    \ by simply starting earlier\n   than is absolutely required.\n"
- title: 3.  Interaction with IETF Face-to-Face Meeting Schedule
  contents:
  - "3.  Interaction with IETF Face-to-Face Meeting Schedule\n   In addition to these\
    \ reasons for schedule pressure, it's worth noting\n   that the NomCom schedule\
    \ and the IETF face-to-face meeting cycle\n   don't complement each other.\n \
    \  o  When the NomCom volunteers are selected after the second IETF,\n      they\
    \ don't have an opportunity to meet face-to-face and \"get\n      organized\"\
    \ until the third IETF, when they should be winding up\n      their deliberations.\
    \  This missed opportunity forces them to use\n      teleconferences and other\
    \ less efficient means of communications\n      to get organized.\n   o  The NomCom\
    \ volunteers don't have a chance to conduct interviews\n      with the community,\
    \ or with nominees, until the third IETF, during\n      the height of the NomCom\
    \ effort.  If the NomCom effort took place\n      before the third IETF, the NomCom\
    \ could work on difficult\n      nominations, and meet face-to-face with nominees\
    \ under\n      consideration.\n   o  If the NomCom is able to start interviews\
    \ during the second IETF\n      meeting, starting earlier than is absolutely required\
    \ may also\n      help NomCom be more effective.\n"
- title: 4.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Proposed Solution\n   The high-level description of the proposal is, of course,\
    \ \"start\n   earlier\", but more precision would be helpful.\n   A sample, hypothetical\
    \ timeline that meets these guidelines is shown\n   in Section 5.  Please note\
    \ that, like Appendix B in [RFC3777], this\n   timeline is not normative, but\
    \ it meets the normative requirements\n   stated in [RFC3777].\n   Other timelines\
    \ are certainly possible, including timelines that\n   allow the NomCom to report\
    \ its results more than one month before the\n   first IETF, where the slate of\
    \ nominees is announced.  Finishing\n   early may be a good thing.\n   It's worth\
    \ noting that the first step in the timeline is \"ISOC\n   president appoints\
    \ NomCom chair\".  This doesn't happen as an IETF\n   responsibility, but the\
    \ reality is that the ISOC president needs to\n   identify NomCom chair candidates\
    \ around the time of the first IETF;\n   she needs to have a shortlist 3 or 4\
    \ weeks after the first IETF.\n   This document suggests (but does not add a normative\
    \ requirement to\n   [RFC3777]) that the outgoing NomCom Chair should verify that\
    \ this\n   process is triggered during the first IETF.\n   1.  One week is allowed\
    \ for the NomCom chair to publish milestones.\n   2.  Six weeks are allowed for\
    \ solicitation of NomCom participants.\n   3.  One week is allowed for confirmation\
    \ of the selection of voting\n       members -- to allow at least some time for\
    \ resolution if there is\n       a problem.\n   4.  The recommended time for NomCom\
    \ self-organization is increased to\n       six weeks.\n   5.  One week is allowed\
    \ for NomCom establishing milestones.\n   6.  In the sample timeline (Table 1),\
    \ an additional five weeks is\n       allowed for the nominating bodies to select\
    \ candidates.\n   7.  The timeline is adjusted to allow one week at the end of\
    \ the\n       process for notification of unsuccessful candidates.\n   This significantly\
    \ increases the amount of time available for NomCom\n   to select candidates while\
    \ still meeting the normative requirements\n   of [RFC3777].\n"

  - "6.  Some Observations from the 2007-2008 NomCom Experience\n   Since the timeline\
    \ described in this specification makes no normative\n   changes to [RFC3777],\
    \ the 2007-2008 NomCom process started using the\n   new timeline to gain experience\
    \ and shake out unexpected\n   consequences.  We discovered the following things:\n\
    \   1.  It is worth pointing out that the [RFC3777] requirement for\n       eligibility,\
    \ \"Members of the IETF community must have attended at\n       least 3 of the\
    \ last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\", is\n       affected when the\
    \ NomCom chair issues an earlier call for\n       volunteers.  For example, using\
    \ the 2008-2009 NomCom example in\n       the doc: under the old schedule, a prospective\
    \ member would need\n       to have attended three of IETF meetings 68-72.  Under\
    \ the new\n       schedule, that becomes three of IETF meetings 67-71.\n   2.\
    \  It's worth noting that when NomCom uses the earlier timeline,\n       incumbents\
    \ under review who were appointed to one-year terms have\n       only one IETF\
    \ meeting cycle to establish a track record before\n       NomCom begins considering\
    \ whether they should be retained.  This\n       situation is rare but not unknown.\
    \  The recent split of the RAI\n       area out of TSV created two one-year terms\
    \ (one in RAI, and one\n       in TSV), and this can also happens if an IESG or\
    \ IAB member\n       resigns with more than one year remaining in the member's\
    \ term.\n"
- title: 7.  Out-of-Scope Suggestions Requiring Normative Text Changes
  contents:
  - "7.  Out-of-Scope Suggestions Requiring Normative Text Changes\n   While there\
    \ are very few avoidable serialized delays in [RFC3777], we\n   note that the\
    \ minimum 30-day delay for volunteers is serialized after\n   the NomCom chair\
    \ is named.  This delay accounts for more than half\n   the elapsed time between\
    \ the NomCom chair being named and the NomCom\n   itself forming.  If a future\
    \ normative revision to [RFC3777] changed\n   the mechanics for this call for\
    \ volunteers, this call could be issued\n   while the NomCom chair is still being\
    \ selected.  This would allow the\n   new NomCom chair to begin work by announcing\
    \ the date of random\n   selection, instead of just waiting for the volunteers\
    \ to volunteer.\n   One possible trigger would be to have the outgoing NomCom\
    \ chair issue\n   the call for volunteers on behalf of the successor NomCom chair,\
    \ who\n   may not yet be identified, at the first IETF meeting each year.\n"

    \ (\"NomCom chairs don't appear\n   magically\"), and provided a suggestion for\
    \ ensuring that this happens\n   in a timeframe that allows NomCom to begin self\
    \ organizing at the\n   Second IETF meeting each year.\n   Thanks to Sam Weiler,\
    \ who pointed out the shift in meeting attendance\n   requirements described in\
    \ Section 6.\n   We should also thank the editors of previous NomCom procedures\
    \ for\n   developing a specification that we could \"speed up\" without changing\n\
    \   normative text.\n"
