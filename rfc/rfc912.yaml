  contents:
  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet\n\
    \   community, and  requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n  \
    \ Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The Authentication Server provides a means to determine the\
    \ identity\n   of a user of a particular TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number\n\
    \   pair, it returns a character string which identifies the owner of\n   that\
    \ connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include\n   automatic identification\
    \ and verification of a user during an FTP\n   session, additional verification\
    \ of a TAC dial up user, and access\n   verification for a generalized network\
    \ file server.\n"
- title: OVERVIEW
  contents:
  - "OVERVIEW\n   This is a connection based application on TCP.  A server listens\
    \ for\n   TCP connections on TCP port 113 (decimal).  Once a connection is\n \
    \  established, the server reads one line of data which specifies the\n   connection\
    \ of interest.  If it exists, the system dependent user\n   identifier of the\
    \ connection of interest is sent out the connection.\n   The service closes the\
    \ connection after sending the user identifier.\n"
- title: RESTRICTIONS
  contents:
  - "RESTRICTIONS\n   Queries are permitted only for fully specified connections.\
    \  The\n   local/foreign host pair used to fully specify the connection are\n\
    \   taken from the query connection.  This means a user on Host A may\n   only\
    \ query the server on Host B about connections between A and B.\n"
- title: QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT
  contents:
  - "QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT\n   The server accepts simple text query requests of the\
    \ form\n      <local-port>, <foreign-port>\n   where <local-port>, is the TCP\
    \ port (decimal) on the target (server)\n   system, and <foreign-port> is the\
    \ TCP port (decimal) on the source\n   (user) system.\n      For example:\n"

    \     <local-port>, <foreign-port> : <response-type> : <additional-info>\n   where\
    \ <local-port>, <foreign-port> are the same pair as the query,\n   <response-type>\

- title: RESPONSE TYPES
  contents:
  - "RESPONSE TYPES\n   A response can be one of two types:\n   USERID\n      In this\
    \ case, <additional-info> is the printable representation of\n      the user identifier\
    \ of the owner of the connection.  The format of\n      the returned user identifier\
    \ is completely system dependent.\n   ERROR\n      For some reason the owner of\
    \ the TCP port could not be determined,\n      <additional-info> tells why.  The\
    \ following are suggested values\n      of <additional-info> and their meanings.\n\
    \         INVALID PORT\n            Either the local or foreign port was improperly\
    \ specified.\n         NO USER\n            The connection specified by the port\
    \ pair is not currently\n            in use.\n         UNKNOWN ERROR\n       \

- title: CAVEATS
  contents:
  - "CAVEATS\n   Unfortunately, the trustworthiness of the various host systems that\n\
    \   might implement an authentication server will vary quite a bit.  It\n   is\
    \ up to the various applications that will use the server to\n   determine the\
    \ amount of trust they will place in the returned\n   information.  It may be\
    \ appropriate in some cases restrict the use of\n   the server to within a locally\
    \ controlled subnet.\n"
- title: APPLICATIONS
  contents:
  - "APPLICATIONS\n   1) Automatic user authentication for FTP.\n   2) Verification\
    \ for privileged network operations.  For example,\n   having the server start\
    \ or stop special purpose servers.\n"
- title: DISCLAIMER
  contents:
  - "DISCLAIMER\n   I designed this protocol to allow me to eliminate the bother of\n\
    \   having to identify myself before continuing an FTP session.\n   Since I started\
    \ work on it, other applications appeared.  I have\n   tried to consider all of\
    \ our applications while still making this as\n   general as possible.\n"
