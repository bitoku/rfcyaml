This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for the management of Parallel printer like devices.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
The Parallel printer like Hardware Device MIB applies to interface ports that would most probably support the Character MIB.
The most common example is Centronics like printer port.
The Parallel printer like Hardware Device MIB is mandatory for all systems that have such a hardware port supporting services managed through some other MIB.
The Parallel printer like Hardware Port MIB includes Centronics like and Data Products like parallel physical links with a similar set of control signals.
The MIB contains objects that relate to physical layer connections.
The MIB comprises one base object and three tables, detailed in the following sections.
The tables contain objects for ports and input and output control signals.
The Parallel printer like MIB is one of many MIBs designed for layered use as described in the Interface MIB [5].
In most implementations where it is present, it will be in the lowest interface sublayer, that is, the Parallel printer like MIB represents the physical layer, providing service to higher layers such as the Character MIB [6].
Although it is unlikely that a parallel printer port will actually be used as a network interface, which is the intent of the Interface MIB, the Parallel printer like MIB is closely connected to the Character MIB, which can share hardware interfaces with network operation, and relate to the RS 232 MIB [7].
The Interface MIB's ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not relevant to the Parallel printer like MIB.
The Parallel printer like MIB is relevant for ifType values para(34) and perhaps others.
The Parallel printer like MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup, and ifFixedLengthGroup.
Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
