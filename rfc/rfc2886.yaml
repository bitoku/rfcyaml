    \ Section: 2 \"References\"\n   ----------\n   Editorial: Add missing references\
    \ to I.363.5 (AAL5) and RFC 1661\n   (PPP).\n   Editorial: delete unused reference\
    \ to Q.724.\n   Editorial: Leave Recommendations referred to in Annex C undated,\n\
    \   implying latest issue.\n   Editorial: add reference to RFC 2805, the Megaco\
    \ requirements\n   document.\n   Section: 4 \"Abbreviations\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Editorial: delete unused abbreviation BRI.\n   Editorial: add explanations\
    \ for GSM and IVR.\n   Section: 6.2.2 \"TerminationIDs\"\n   ----------\n   Issue:\
    \ Not clear what wildcard union responses look like.\n   Resolution: Add the following\
    \ text:\n    \"ie. Given termination Ta with properties p1=a, p2=b, and\n   termination\
    \ Tb with properties p2=c, p3=d a UNION\n   response would be T* p1=a, p2=b,c,\
    \ p3=d.\"\n   Section: 6.2.4 \"Termination Properties and descriptors\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: Says that property values set in Null context are remembered\n   and\
    \ reinstated when termination returns to Null.  Contradicts latest\n   text in\
    \ 7.2.3.\n   Resolution: Rewrite the first paragraph from the third sentence\n\
    \   onward, to read:  \"Most properties have default values, which are\n   explicitly\
    \ defined in this standard  or in a package (see Section 12)\n   or set by provisioning.\
    \  If not provisioned otherwise, all\n   descriptors except for TerminationState\
    \ and LocalControl default to\n   empty/\"no value\" when a termination is first\
    \ created or is returned\n   to the null context.  The default contents of the\
    \ two exceptions are\n   described in sections 7.1.5 and 7.1.7.\"\n   Issue: DigitMap\
    \ entry in table makes explicit reference to DTMF\n   tones, but is also intended\
    \ to apply to other in-band signalling\n   systems.\n   Resolution: Change existing\
    \ text to new one as follows: \"Defines\n   patterns against which sequences of\
    \ a specified set of events are to\n   be matched so they can be reported as a\
    \ group rather than singly.\"\n   Section: 6.2.5 \"Root Termination\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: Root can have statistics as well as properties and events.\n   Resolution:\
    \ add \"statistics\" to the fourth sentence of the first\n   paragraph, listing\
    \ what is valid for Root.  Add \"statistics\" to what\n   AuditValue can return\
    \ for Root.\n   Section: 7.1 \"Descriptors\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: it is unclear\
    \ how to express empty descriptors in responses to\n   the MGC.\n   Proposed resolution:\
    \ In section 7.1, add the following text after the\n   sentence: \"Descriptors\
    \ may be returned as output from a command.\":\n   \"In any such return of descriptor\
    \ contents, an empty descriptor is\n   represented by its name unaccompanied by\
    \ any list.\"\n   In the ASN.1, add the following choice to the AuditReturnParameter\n\
    \   production:\n     \"emptyDescriptors               AuditDescriptor,\"\n  \
    \ In the ABNF, add the choice auditItem to the production\n   auditReturnParameter.\n\
    \   Section: 7.1.1 \"Specifying Parameters\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Third paragraph\
    \ (discussing unspecified parameters): not clear\n   which parameters are mandatory.\n\
    \   Resolution: Replace the first two sentences (each beginning with the\n   word\
    \ \"unspecified\") with the following text:  \"If a required\n   descriptor other\
    \ than the Audit descriptor is unspecified (i.e.\n   entirely absent) from a command,\
    \ the previous values set in that\n   descriptor for that termination, if any,\
    \ are retained.  A missing\n   Audit descriptor is equivalent to an empty Audit\
    \ descriptor.  The\n   behaviour of the MG with respect to unspecified parameters\
    \ within a\n   descriptor varies with the descriptor concerned, as indicated in\n\
    \   succeeding sections.\"\n   Section: 7.1.6 \"Stream Descriptor\", ABNF (Annex\
    \ B.2)\n   ----------\n   Issue: Text indicates use of \"true\" and \"false\"\
    \ values while ABNF\n   uses \"on\" and \"off\"\n   Resolution: Add comment in\
    \ B.2 that \"true\" in text corresponds to\n   \"on\" in ABNF, and \"false\" corresponds\
    \ to \"off\".\n   Section: 7.1.8 \"Local and Remote Descriptors\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: case where reserveGroup or reserveValue is true, last bulleted\n  \
    \ item beginning: \"If the Mode property of the LocalControl descriptor\n   is\
    \ RecvOnly or SendRecv,...\", could also have DSP involvement in the\n   case\
    \ of loopback mode.\n   Resolution: Add \"loopback\".\n   Section: 7.1.9 \"Events\
    \ Descriptor\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: EventDM is part of syntax but not mentioned\
    \ in section.\n   Resolution: Add text: \"If a digit map completion event is present\
    \ or\n   implied in the EventsDescriptor, EventDM is used to carry either the\n\
    \   name or the value of the associated digit map. See section 7.1.14.\"\n   Issue:\
    \ Not clear whether events trigger side effects (e.g. signal\n   termination)\
    \ at time of detection, at time of processing (whether or\n   not in active Events\
    \ Descriptor) or at time of notification.  Also,\n   the third paragraph of the\
    \ section fails to mention these side\n   effects and limits MG action to notification.\n\
    \   Resolution: Modify the third paragraph of the section, so that it\n   reads:\
    \  \"When an event (either newly detected or buffered) is\n   processed against\
    \ the contents of an active Events descriptor and\n   found to be present in that\
    \ descriptor (\"recognized\"), the default\n   action of the MG is to send a Notify\
    \ command to the MG.  Notification\n   may be deferred if the event is absorbed\
    \ into the current dial string\n   of an active digit map (see section 7.1.14).\
    \  Any other action is for\n   further study.  Moreover, event recognition may\
    \ cause currently\n   active signals to stop, or may cause the current Events\
    \ and/or\n   Signals descriptor to be replaced, as described at the end of this\n\
    \   section.\"\n   Replace \"detection\" with \"recognition\" in the fourth paragraph\
    \ from\n   the end, so that it reads:  \"Normally, recognition of an event shall\n\
    \   cause any active signals to stop.  When KeepActive is specified in\n   the\
    \ event, the MG shall not interrupt any signals active on the\n   Termination\
    \ on which the event is detected.\"\n   In the third-last paragraph, replace all\
    \ three instances of\n   \"detected\" with \"recognized\".\n   Leave the word\
    \ \"detected\" as is in the final paragraph.\n   Issue: Case 1, step 2(a) is incorrectly\
    \ formulated.  Existing logic\n   may result in an infinite loop.  Also, the step\
    \ excludes side effect\n   actions such as signal termination.\n   Resolution:\
    \ Modify step 2(a) to read:  \"If the event in the queue is\n   in the events\
    \ listed in the new EventsDescriptor, the MG acts on the\n   event and removes\
    \ it from the EventBuffer.  The time stamp of the\n   Notify shall be the time\
    \ the event was actually detected.  The MG\n   then waits for a new EventsDescriptor.\
    \  While waiting for a new\n   EventsDescriptor, any events detected which appear\
    \ in the current\n   EventsBufferDescriptor will be placed in the EventBuffer.\
    \  When a new\n   EventDescriptor is received, event processing repeats from step\
    \ 1.\"\n   Section: 7.1.11 \"Signals Descriptor\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: There\
    \ is a need for the MGC to be aware of signalling\n   failures.  It is not possible\
    \ to use the signal completion event to\n   monitor for signalling failures only,\
    \ without also having to process\n   successes.\n   Proposed Resolution: In section\
    \ 7.1.11, replace the current text on\n   completion notification, beginning:\
    \ \"Finally, the optional parameter\n   \"notifyCompletion\" ...\" and continuing\
    \ to the end of the paragraph\n   with the following text:\n   \"Finally, the\
    \ optional parameter \"notifyCompletion\" allows a MGC to\n   indicate the circumstances\
    \ under which it wishes to be notified when\n   the signal finishes playout. \
    \ The possible cases are that the signal\n   timed out, that it was interrupted\
    \ by an event, that it was halted\n   when a Signals descriptor was replaced,\
    \ or that it stopped or never\n   started for other reasons.  If \"notifyCompletion\"\
    \ is absent,\n   notification is generated in the \"other reasons\" case only.\
    \  For\n   reporting to occur the signal completion event (see section E.1.2)\n\
    \   must be enabled in the currently active Events descriptor.\"\n   In Annex\
    \ A.2, make notifyCompletion a BIT STRING with the four cases.\n   In B.2, make\
    \ it a parameter consisting of a name and a list of values\n   representing the\
    \ possible completion methods.\n   Section: 7.1.13 \"ServiceChange Descriptor\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: Missing \"extension\" component in the API.\n   Resolution:\
    \ Add missing component.\n   Section: 7.1.14 \"DigitMap Descriptor\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Editorial: add the following subsections.\n   7.1.14.1 DigitMap definition,\
    \ creation, modification and termination\n   (before first paragraph)\n   7.1.14.2\
    \ DigitMap Timers (after the first bullet list)\n   7.1.14.3 DigitMap syntax (before\
    \ the long paragraph starting \"The\n   formal syntax of the digit map [...]\"\
    )\n   7.1.14.4 DigitMap completion event (before the paragraph starting \"A\n\
    \   digit map is active while the events descriptor [...]\")\n   7.1.14.5 DigitMap\
    \ procedures (before the sentence \"Pending\n   completion, successive events\
    \ shall be processed [...]\", preceding\n   the numbered list)\n   7.1.14.6 DigitMap\
    \ activation (after the numbered list)\n   7.1.14.7 Interaction of DigitMap and\
    \ event processing (before the\n   next paragraph, starting \"While the digit\
    \ map is activated, [...]\")\n   7.1.14.8 Wildcards (before the the next paragraph,\
    \ starting \"Note\n   that if a package contains [...]\")\n   7.1.14.9 Example\
    \ (before the example)\n   Issue: incorrect statements regarding the interaction\
    \ of the dot\n   symbol with default timing rules.\n   Resolution: last sentence\
    \ of the paragraph beginning \"The letter \"x\"\n   is used as a wildcard, ...\"\
    \ should be modified to read:  \"As a\n   consequence of the third timing rule\
    \ above, inter-event timing while\n   matching a terminal dot symbol uses the\
    \ short timer by default.\"  In\n   the next paragraph, the third sentence, which\
    \ begins:  \"A timer\n   specifier following a dot ...\", should be deleted.\n\
    \   Issue: Step 5 in second numbered list  understates conditions for\n   digit\
    \ map completion when single candidate remains.\n   Resolution: Add the words\
    \ \"and it has been fully matched\" to the\n   existing sentence.  Also remove\
    \ the parenthetical remark:  \"...\n   (because the candidate set still contains\
    \ more than one alternative\n   event sequence)\" from step 6.\n   Issue: Not\
    \ clear when unmatched events are recognized and trigger\n   side effects (e.g.\
    \ signal termination).\n   Resolution:  Modify the final sentence of the paragraph\
    \ following\n   procedural step 6 to read as follows:  \"Normal event behaviour\
    \ (e.g.\n   stopping of signals unless the digit completion event has the\n  \
    \ KeepActive flag enabled) continues to apply for each such event\n   detected,\
    \ except that\n     . the events in the package containing the specified digit\
    \ map\n       completion event other than the completion event itself are not\n\
    \       individually notified, and\n     . an event which triggers a \"partial\
    \ match\" completion is not\n       recognized and therefore has no side effects\
    \ until reprocessed\n       following the recognition of the digit map completion\
    \ event.\"\n   Issue: the last paragraph before the example is misleading if the\n\
    \   package containing the digit map completion event is different from\n   the\
    \ package containing the actual digits.\n   Resolution: qualify the second sentence\
    \ of the paragraph as follows:\n   \"Regardless of whether a digit map is activated,\
    \ if the package also\n   contains the digit events themselves, this form of event\n\
    \   specification ...\".\n   Section: 7.1.18 \"Topology Descriptor\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: Third bullet attached to third para: says loopback achieved by\n  \
    \ manipulating TerminationMode, which no longer has that name.\n   Resolution:\
    \ Delete the clause \"; loopbacks are created by setting the\n   TerminationMode\"\
    \n   Section: 7.2\n   ----------\n   Issue: The order in which descriptors are\
    \ processed within a command\n   matters, but is not clear.  Moreover, it is fixed\
    \ in the ASN.1 but\n   variable in the ABNF.\n   Resolution: Add text stating\
    \ that descriptors are processed in the\n   order in which they are provided.\
    \  Change ASN.1 in Annex A.2 to allow\n   the MGC to specify ordering:\n   AmmRequest\
    \ ::= SEQUENCE\n   {\n           terminationID           TerminationIDList,\n\
    \           descriptors             SEQUENCE OF AmmDescriptor,\n           --\
    \ At most one descriptor of each type (see AmmDescriptor)\n           -- allowed\
    \ in the sequence\n           ...\n   }\n   AmmDescriptor ::= CHOICE\n   {\n \
    \          mediaDescriptor         MediaDescriptor,\n           modemDescriptor\
    \         ModemDescriptor,\n           muxDescriptor           MuxDescriptor,\n\
    \           eventsDescriptor        EventsDescriptor,\n           eventBufferDescriptor\
    \   EventBufferDescriptor,\n           signalsDescriptor       SignalsDescriptor,\n\
    \           digitMapDescriptor      DigitMapDescriptor,\n           auditDescriptor\
    \         AuditDescriptor,\n           ...\n   }\n   Section: 7.2.3 \"Subtract\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: cannot use the CHOOSE wildcard for terminationId of\
    \ a Subtract\n   command.\n   Resolution: add this qualification to the second\
    \ sentence, which\n   indicates that terminationId may be wildcarded.\n   Section:\
    \ 7.2.4 \"Move\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: cannot use the CHOOSE wildcard for\
    \ terminationId of a Move\n   command.\n   Resolution: add this qualification\
    \ to the second sentence, which\n   indicates that terminationId may be wildcarded.\n\
    \   Section: 7.2.5 \"AuditValue\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Not clear whether\
    \ AuditValue of ObservedEventsDescriptor\n   reports events captured in current\
    \ dial string of active digit map.\n   Resolution: Add text to indicate that if\
    \ a digit map is active and\n   ObservedEventsDescriptor is specified the response\
    \ to an AuditValue\n   includes a digit map completion event which shows the current\
    \ dial\n   string but does not show a termination method.\n   Issue: Fails to\
    \ indicate what AuditValue for EventBufferDescriptor\n   returns\n   Resolution:\
    \ Add the following text: \"EventBuffer returns the set of\n   events and associated\
    \ parameter values currently enabled in the\n   EventBufferDescriptor.\"\n   Issue:\
    \ not clear whether wildcarded context includes the null\n   context.\n   Resolution:\
    \ add statement that ALL as a contextID does not include\n   the null context.\n\
    \   Issue: the text of 7.2.5 allows retrieval of multiple digit maps with\n  \
    \ one AuditValue command if the terminationId is ALL.  Moreover,\n   earlier text\
    \ in the Annex anticipates that multiple instances of a\n   descriptor may be\
    \ returned.  The comment in front of production\n   auditReturnParameter in Annex\
    \ B.2 contradicts this text.  Note that\n   Annex A has no restriction on the\
    \ number of instances of any\n   descriptor in either a command or a response.\n\
    \   Proposed Resolution: delete the\"at-most-once\" comment preceding ABNF\n \
    \  production auditReturnParameter.\n   Issue: Does not indicate how an audit\
    \ of digit maps returns unnamed\n   digit maps.\n   Resolution: Change syntax\
    \ of DigitMapDescriptor to allow return of\n   unnamed digit maps as follows:\n\
    \   digitMapDescriptor = DigitMapToken EQUAL\n                        ( (LBRKT\
    \ digitMapValue RBRKT)\n                        / (digitMapname [ LBRKT digitMapValue\
    \ RBRKT ])\n                        ) and\n   DigitMapDescriptor ::= SEQUENCE\
    \ {\n           digitMapName    DigitMapName OPTIONAL,\n           digitMapValue\
    \   DigitMapValue OPTIONAL }\n   Issue: the text in section 7.2.5 mentions that\
    \ using an empty Audit\n   descriptor with a wildcarded terminationId is a way\
    \ to get a list of\n   the terminations in the context.  Annex A provides the\
    \ possibility\n   that the auditReply may be a contextAuditResult of type\n  \
    \ terminationIdList, and Annex B allows for an auditReply containing a\n   contextTerminationAudit\
    \ which in turn presents a terminationIdList.\n   The connection between the text\
    \ in 7.2.5 and these special forms of\n   audit result is not clear.  Moreover,\
    \ a note at the beginning of\n   Annex A section A.2 limits terminationIdList\
    \ to one terminationId.\n   Proposed Resolution: add the following text in section\
    \ 7.2.5 after\n   the sentence \"This may be useful to get a list of TerminationIDs\
    \ when\n   used with wildcard.\":  \"Annexes A and B provide a special syntax\
    \ for\n   presenting such a list in condensed form, such that the AuditValue\n\
    \   command tag does not have to be repeated for each terminationId.\"\n   Also,\
    \ in the Note at the beginning of section A.2 of Annex A, provide\n   an exception\
    \ on the length of type TerminationIdList when used in\n   contextAuditResult.\n\
    \   Section: 7.2.6 \"AuditCapabilities\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Fails to indicate\
    \ what AuditCapabilities for\n   EventBufferDescriptor returns\n   Resolution:\
    \ Add the following text: \"EventBuffer returns the same\n   information as Events.\"\
    \n   Issue: Inconsistency regarding permissibility of DigitMap or Packages\n \
    \  as capability audit items.\n   Resolution: Add comment to B.2 \"auditItem\"\
    \ production indicating that\n   DigitMap and Packages are not allowed in the\
    \ AuditCapabilities\n   command.\n   Section: 7.2.8 \"ServiceChange\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: In point 1) describing the Graceful ServiceChange method, the\n   scope\
    \ of the recommendation against new connections is unclear.\n   Resolution: at\
    \ the end of the first sentence, add the phrase \"on the\n   termination(s) affected\
    \ by the ServiceChange command\".\n   Issue: the explanatory string associated\
    \ with ServiceChangeReason is\n   optional in the syntax, but not in the text.\n\
    \   Resolution: add \"optional\" before \"explanatory string\" in the\n   explanation\
    \ of the ServiceChangeReason\" parameter.\n   Issue: Paragraph beginning \"A ServiceChange\
    \ Command specifying the\n   Root...\" immediately following the description of\
    \ ServiceChange\n   Descriptor parameters erroneously states that the response\
    \ to the\n   ServiceChange command terminates the registration process.  This\
    \ is\n   so only if the response does not specify an alternate MGC.\n   Resolution:\
    \ Add text to the offending sentence, so that it reads:\n   \"Acknowledgement\
    \ of the ServiceChange Command completes the\n   registration process, except\
    \ when the MGC has returned an alternative\n   ServiceChangeMgcId as described\
    \ in the next paragraph.\"\n   Section: 7.3 \"Command Error Codes\"\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: Text for error code 403 should be consistent with that for 404\n  \
    \ and 405.\n   Resolution: Change text to \"Syntax error in TransactionRequest\"\
    \n   Issue: There should be no error responses to TransactionReply or\n   TransactionPending,\
    \ lest they create response loops.\n   Resolution: Delete codes 404, 405, 461-467\n\
    \   Section: 8 \"Transactions\", A.2\n   ----------\n   Issue: state is unclear\
    \ if a command fails.\n   Resolution: add the following text:  \"If a command\
    \ fails, the MG\n   shall as far as possible restore the state which prevailed\
    \ prior to\n   the attempted execution of the command before continuing with\n\
    \   transaction processing.\"\n   Section: 8.1.1 \"Transaction Identifiers\"\n\
    \   ----------\n   Issue: need a transaction identifier to use when reporting\
    \ a syntax\n   error such that the identifier is unavailable.\n   Resolution:\
    \ add text reserving transionId = 0 for this purpose.\n   Section: 8.1.2 \"Context\
    \ Identifiers\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: ALL as a context identifier does not\
    \ include the null context.\n   Resolution: add text to indicate that exclusion\
    \ in the final sentence\n   of the section.\n   Section: 8.2.2 \"TransactionReply\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: Final para has wrong text for error code 442.\n   Resolution:\
    \ Change to \"Syntax Error in Command\"\n   Section: 10.2 \"Interim AH Scheme\"\
    , B.2\n   ----------\n   Issue: The interim AH header can actually be as short\
    \ as 24 hex\n   digits (per RFCs 2403, 2404 which are indirectly referenced).\
    \  It is\n   also unclear whether it is the source or destination UDP port which\n\
    \   is prepended in the calculation.\n   Resolution: Change 10.2 second para,\
    \ second-last sentence to specify\n   the destination port, in consistency with\
    \ IPSEC.  In Annex B.2,\n   change lower count for production AuthData to 24 from\
    \ 32.\n   Section: 11.2 \"Cold Start\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: First paragraph\
    \ last sentence inadvertently modified --\n   duplicates material in 11.3.\n \
    \  Resolution: Restore original sentence: \"If the MG is unable to\n   establish\
    \ a control relationship with any MGC, it shall wait a random\n   amount of time\
    \ as described in Section 9.2 and then start contacting\n   its primary, and if\
    \ necessary, its secondary MGCs again.\"\n   Section: 11.4 \"Failure Of an MG\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: Second para: wrong MG is specified as the one to be\
    \ used after\n   failover.\n   Resolution: Change fourth sentence to refer to\
    \ \"secondary MG\" rather\n   than \"primary MG\".\n   Section: 12.1.2 \"Properties\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: As indicated in 6.2.4, Properties occur in other descriptors\n\
    \   besides LocalControl and TerminationState.\n   Resolution: after the sentence\
    \ mentioning TerminationState, add\n   another sentence:  \"Although these are\
    \ the most common cases, it is\n   also possible for a property to be defined\
    \ for other descriptors.\"\n   Section: 12.1.4 \"Signals\"\n   ----------\n  \
    \ Issue: Note says that default duration should be specified for BR\n   signals.\
    \  This also applies to TO signals.\n   Resolution: Add TO signals to note.\n\
    \   Section: 12.2 \"Guidelines to defining  Properties, Statistics and\n   Parameters\
    \ to Events and Signals\", B.2\n   ----------\n   Issue: Text indicates that statistics\
    \ can have the sub-list data\n   type, but ABNF does not support that.\n   Resolution:\
    \ qualify the sublist type by adding the note:  \"(not\n   supported for statistics)\"\
    .\n   Section: Annex A.1, ASN.1 Syntax\n   ----------\n   Issue: the ASN.1 uses\
    \ the values 0x0, 0xFFFFFFFE, and 0xFFFFFFFF for\n   the NULL context, a wildcard\
    \ CHOOSE of context, and a wildcard ALL of\n   context respectively.  Because\
    \ of the possibility of a switch between\n   binary and text encoding for messages\
    \ relating to the same context,\n   these values should be reserved in the text\
    \ encoded syntax.\n   Resolution: Add a comment preceding the ContextID production\
    \ in Annex\n   B.2 indicating that these values are reserved.\n   Section: Annex\
    \ A.2, ASN.1 Syntax\n   ----------\n   Issue: sloppy ASN.1 -- in production EventBufferControl\
    \ the values\n   \"off\" and \"lockstep\" should not be capitalized, and IA5STRING\
    \ in\n   production NonStandardIdentifier should be IA5String.  Both\n   TransactionID\
    \ and TransactionId are used.  A number of productions\n   need ellipses to express\
    \ extensibility.\n   Resolution: fix them.\n   Issue: syntax for PropertyParm\
    \ does not support sub-lists (i.e.\n   parameters supporting multiple values simultaneously)\n\
    \   Resolution: add a third choice to extrainfo in PropertyParm as\n   follows:\n\
    \            extraInfo   CHOICE\n        {\n                relation        Relation,\n\
    \                range           BOOLEAN,\n                sublist         BOOLEAN\n\
    \        } OPTIONAL\n   and add an appropriate note to the preceding comments.\n\
    \   Issue: LocalControlDescriptor still contains reserve rather than\n   reserveValue\
    \ and reserveGroup.\n   Resolution: Replace reserve with separate reserveValue\
    \ and\n   reserveGroup Booleans.\n   Issue: EventBufferDescriptor is incorrectly\
    \ portrayed as a SEQUENCE\n   OF ObservedEvent.\n   Resolution: replace with the\
    \ following productions:\n   EventBufferDescriptor ::= SEQUENCE OF EventSpec\n\
    \   EventSpec ::= SEQUENCE {\n        pkgdName                PkgdName,\n    \
    \    streamID                StreamID OPTIONAL,\n        evParList           \
    \    SEQUENCE OF EventParameter }\n   Issue: Assigned object identifier missing.\
    \  It is usually present as\n   a matter of convention.\n   Resolution: Add object\
    \ identifier line in the message header with\n   content:\n       \"itu-t recommendation\
    \ h 248 media-gateway-control(0)\" Delete the\n   version field, which this makes\
    \ redundant.\n   Issue: the T.35 country code in the H221NonStandard production\
    \ does\n   not have the right structure.\n   Resolution: fix it.\n   Section:\
    \ Annex B.2, ABNF Syntax\n   ----------\n   Issue: Syntax for parmValue and VALUE\
    \ together make parsing of range\n   ambiguous.  Furthermore, sub-lists and sets\
    \ of alternative values\n   have the same syntax, introducing possible ambiguity\n\
    \   Resolution: Replace production alternativeValue by the following:\n     \"\
    alternativeValue = ( VALUE\n          / LSBRKT VALUE *(COMMA VALUE) RSBRKT   \
    \  ; sub-list\n          / LBRKT VALUE *(COMMA VALUE) RBRKT       ; alternatives\n\
    \          / LSBRKT VALUE COLON VALUE RSBRKT )      ; range\"\n   Issue: EventBufferDescriptor\
    \ content mistakenly shown as a sequence\n   of observedEvent.\n   Resolution:\
    \ replace the production for eventBufferDescriptor with the\n   following productions:\n\
    \   eventBufferDescriptor = EventBufferToken LBRKT [ eventSpec\n      *( COMMA\
    \ eventSpec ) ] RBRKT\n   eventSpec = pkgdName [ LBRKT  eventSpecParameter\n \
    \                         *( COMMA eventSpecParameter ) RBRKT ]\n   eventSpecParameter\
    \ = ( eventStream / eventOther )\n   Issue: Error in syntax for  digitMapDescriptor:\
    \ value meant to be\n   optional.\n   Resolution: Change production:\n   digitMapDescriptor\
    \ = DigitMapToken EQUAL digitMapName\n                [ LBRKT digitMapValue RBRKT\
    \ ]\n   Issue: VersionToken not defined.\n   Resolution: Add ABNF:       VersionToken\
    \ =  (\"Version\" / \"V\")\n   Issue: DiscardToken not used.\n   Resolution: Delete\
    \ production.\n   Section: Annex C\n   ----------\n   Issue: alignment of sub-octet\
    \ fields within the octet is not\n   indicated.\n   Resolution: add note that\
    \ fields of sub-octet length are placed in\n   the low-order bits of the octet.\n\
    \   Section: Annex C, ATM-related sections C.4, C.7, C.8, C.10\n   ----------\n\
    \   Issue: direction of flow is segregated by outgoing (Remote\n   descriptor)\
    \ and incoming (Local descriptor).  Since forward and\n   backward properties\
    \ will not both reside in the same descriptor, need\n   only the one set of properties\
    \ applicable to both directions.\n   Resolution: replace with a single set of\
    \ properties.\n   Issue: miscellaneous problems of parameter specifications\n\
    \   inconsistent with the relevant standards, unused parameters,\n   distinction\
    \ between ATM Forum and ITU-T usages, missing references.\n   Resolution: fix\
    \ them.\n   Section: Annex C.8 \"ATM AAL1\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Length of\
    \ GIT is wrong.\n   Resolution: ITU-T procedural problem, to be resolved by SG\
    \ 16.\n   Probable solution is to allow 29 octets, event though the relevant\n\
    \   form requires only four octets.\n   Section: Annex C.9 \"Bearer Capabilities\"\
    \n   ----------\n   Issue: ITC has reference to missing note 2\n   Resolution:\
    \ Delete reference.\n   Issue: Not clear that Q.931 Bearer Capability IE rather\
    \ than Low\n   Layer Compatibility IE is being used.\n   Resolution: Specify that\
    \ values are those valid for Bearer Capability\n   IE\n   Section: Annex D.1 \"\
    Transport over IP/UDP using Application Level\n   Framing\"\n   ----------\n \
    \  Issue: Even in the case of handoff or failover, the originating MGC\n   needs\
    \ confirmation that its command was received.\n   Resolution: In the last sentence\
    \ of the first paragraph, delete the\n   excepting clause, so that the sentence\
    \ reads: \"Responses must be sent\n   to the address and port from which the corresponding\
    \ commands were\n   sent.\"\n   Section: Annex D.1.1 \"Providing At-Most-Once\
    \ Functionality\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Second para last sentence provides\
    \ a procedural reference to\n   8.2.3.  Should refer to UDP-specific procedures.\n\
    \   Resolution: Add reference to D.1.4.\n   Section: Annex D.1.3 \"Repeating Requests,\
    \ Responses and\n   Acknowledgements\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Make exponential\
    \ backoff in the face of congestion mandatory.\n   Resolution: To the paragraph\
    \ just before the note, which begins \"The\n   specification purposely avoids\
    \ specifying any value for the\n   retransmission timers...\", add the following\
    \ sentence:\n   \"Implementations SHALL ensure that the algorithm used to calculate\n\
    \   retransmission timing performs an exponentially increasing backoff of\n  \
    \ the retransmission timeout for each retransmission or repetition\n   after the\
    \ first one.\"\n   In the paragraph in the middle of the note beginning \"After\
    \ any\n   retransmission ...\", capitalize the word SHOULD to emphasize the\n\
    \   importance of the steps which follow.\n   Issue: Last paragraph is equivocal\
    \ about what ServiceChangeReason to\n   use when recovering from loss of contact;\
    \ it must always be\n   \"Disconnected\".\n   Resolution: Change the two sentences\
    \ following the phrase \"_ and it\n   begins its recovery process\" to read as\
    \ follows: \"The MG shall use a\n   ServiceChange with ServiceChangeMethod set\
    \ to disconnected so that\n   the new MGC will be aware that the MG lost one or\
    \ more transactions.\"\n   Section: Annex D.1.4 \"Provisional responses\"\n  \
    \ ----------\n   Issue: First paragraph, last sentence talks about when to send\
    \ the\n   Transaction Pending response.  When UDP/ALF is in use, the originator\n\
    \   of a transaction may repeat it because it has not received an\n   acknowledgement\
    \ that the transaction was received.  An appropriate\n   response to a duplicate\
    \ transaction which is still being processed is\n   to return Transaction Pending.\n\
    \   Resolution: Add the sentence: \"They SHOULD send this response if they\n \
    \  receive a repetition of a transaction that is still being executed.\"\n   Issue:\
    \ Second para: transaction originator may not have received\n   TransactionPending\
    \ response(s) because they were lost, and may\n   therefore not know that responder\
    \ is expecting immediate\n   acknowledgement of the TransactionReply.\n   Resolution:\
    \ add an optional field to TransactionReply allowing the\n   responder to indicate\
    \ if an immediate ACK is required.  Add text in\n   the section indicating that\
    \ when the responder has sent a provisional\n   response, it shall also set the\
    \ indicator in the final transaction\n   reply to indicate that an immediate acknowledgement\
    \ is required.\n   Section: Annex E \"Basic Packages\"\n   ----------\n   Issue:\
    \ package numbering does not follow order of presentation.\n   Resolution: renumber\
    \ packages to follow order of numbering.\n   Section: Annex E.2.1 \"Base Root\
    \ Package -- Properties\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: the descriptor in which these\
    \ properties occur is not\n   specified.\n   Resolution: in each case, indicate\
    \ that the property is defined in\n   the TerminationState descriptor.\n   Section:\
    \ Annex E.6.2 \"DTMF detection Package -- Events\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: \"\
    Long duration event modifier\" is shown as \"L\" in parameter\n   DigitString\
    \ -- should be \"Z\".\n   Resolution: Replace with \"Z\".\n   Section: Annex E.9.2\
    \ \"Analog Line Supervision Package -- Events\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Stated\
    \ hook state reporting behaviour has race condition where\n   same transition\
    \ could be reported twice.\n   Resolution: add an optional EventsDescriptor parameter\
    \ and an\n   optional ObservedEvents parameter to each of the on-hook and off-hook\n\
    \   events.  Delete the second sentence of the existing event description\n  \
    \ (which indicates that the event is always reported if the hook state\n   has\
    \ already been achieved).\n   The EventsDescriptor parameter is described as follows:\n\
    \   Strict Transition\n         ParameterID: strict (0x0001)\n         Type: enumeration\n\
    \         Possible values:\n             \"exact\" means that only an actual hook\
    \ state transition\n             to on-hook (off-hook) is to be recognized\n \
    \            \"state\" means that the event is to be recognized\n            \
    \ either if the hook state transition is detected or if the\n             hook\
    \ state is already on-hook (off-hook).  This is the\n             default value\
    \ if \"strict\" is unspecified.\n             \"failWrong\" means that if the\
    \ hook state is already what\n             the transition would imply, the command\
    \ fails and an error\n             is reported [error code to be defined in the\
    \ package].\n   The ObservedEvents parameter is described as follows:\n   Initial\
    \ State\n         ParameterID: init (0x0002)\n         Type: Boolean\n       \
    \  Possible values:\n             true/\"ON\" means that the event was reported\
    \ because the\n             line was already on-hook (off-hook) when the events\n\
    \             descriptor containing this event was activated\n             false/\"\
    OFF\" means that the event represents an actual\n             state transition\
    \ to on-hook (off-hook)\n   Section: Annex E.10.3 \"Basic Continuity Package --\
    \ Signals\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: The rsp signal should continue until the\
    \ MGC tells the MG to\n   stop applying it.\n   Resolution: change the type of\
    \ signal from Timeout to ON/OFF.\n   Section: Annex E.10.5 \"Basic Continuity\
    \ Package -- Procedures\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Wording of condition for generating\
    \ cmp event with \"success\"\n   does not cover case where test also requires\
    \ successful removal of\n   tone.\n   Resolution: In the second paragraph of E.10.5\
    \ (dealing with test\n   initiation), add the words \"and any other required conditions\
    \ are\n   satisfied\" in the second sentence, as part of the condition upon\n\
    \   which success is reported.  Replace the third paragraph (dealing with\n  \
    \ test response) with the following text:\n   \"When a MGC wants the MG to respond\
    \ to a continuity test, it sends a\n   command to the MG containing a signals\
    \ descriptor with the rsp\n   signal. Upon reception of a command with the rsp\
    \ signal, the MG\n   either applies a loop-back or (for 2-wire circuits) awaits\
    \ reception\n   of a continuity test tone.  In the loop-back case, any incoming\n\
    \   information shall be reflected back as outgoing information.  In the\n   2-wire\
    \ case, any time the appropriate test tone is received, the\n   appropriate response\
    \ tone should be sent.  The MGC will determine\n   when to remove the rsp signal.\"\
    \n   Section: Appendix A.1.2 \"Example -- Collecting Originator Digits and\n \
    \  Initiating Termination\"\n   ----------\n   Issue: Step 3 uses a now-obsolete\
    \ package DS0 for echo cancellation.\n   Resolution: replace with echo cancellation\
    \ via package TDM.\n   Issue: Step 20 fails to show a returned TerminationStateDescriptor.\n\
    \   It also contains the erroneous statement that an RTP termination does\n  \
    \ not support events and signals and fails to show a number of other\n   descriptors.\n\
    \   Resolution:\n   Delete the sentence containing the erroneous statement.\n\
    \   Add the following to the Media Descriptor preceding the line \"Stream\n  \
    \ = 1_\":\n   \"TerminationState { ServiceStates = InService, EventBufferControl\
    \ =\n   OFF },\"\n   Add lines showing Events, Signals, and DigitMap descriptors\n\
