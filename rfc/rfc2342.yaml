  contents:
  - "1. Abstract\n   IMAP4 [RFC-2060] does not define a default server namespace.\
    \ As a\n   result, two common namespace models have evolved:\n   The \"Personal\
    \ Mailbox\" model, in which the default namespace that is\n   presented consists\
    \ of only the user's personal mailboxes. To access\n   shared mailboxes, the user\
    \ must use an escape mechanism to reach\n   another namespace.\n   The \"Complete\
    \ Hierarchy\" model, in which the default namespace that\n   is presented includes\
    \ the user's personal mailboxes along with any\n   other mailboxes they have access\
    \ to.\n   These two models, create difficulties for certain client operations.\n\
    \   This document defines a NAMESPACE command that allows a client to\n   discover\
    \ the prefixes of namespaces used by a server for personal\n   mailboxes, other\
    \ users' mailboxes, and shared mailboxes.  This allows\n   a client to avoid much\
    \ of the manual user configuration that is now\n   necessary when mixing and matching\
    \ IMAP4 clients and servers.\n"

  - "2. Conventions used in this document\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate\
    \ lines sent by the client and\n   server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped\
    \ without a new \"C:\" or\n   \"S:\" label, then the wrapping is for editorial\
    \ clarity and is not\n   part of the command.\n   Personal Namespace: A namespace\
    \ that the server considers within the\n   personal scope of the authenticated\
    \ user on a particular connection.\n   Typically, only the authenticated user\
    \ has access to mailboxes in\n   their Personal Namespace. It is the part of the\
    \ namespace that\n   belongs to the user that is allocated for mailboxes. If an\
    \ INBOX\n   exists for a user, it MUST appear within the user's personal\n   namespace.\
    \  In the typical case, there SHOULD be only one Personal\n   Namespace on a server.\n\
    \   Other Users' Namespace: A namespace that consists of mailboxes from\n   the\
    \ Personal Namespaces of other users.  To access mailboxes in the\n   Other Users'\
    \ Namespace, the currently authenticated user MUST be\n   explicitly granted access\
    \ rights.  For example, it is common for a\n   manager to grant to their secretary\
    \ access rights to their mailbox.\n   In the typical case, there SHOULD be only\
    \ one Other Users' Namespace\n   on a server.\n   Shared Namespace: A namespace\
    \ that consists of mailboxes that are\n   intended to be shared amongst users\
    \ and do not exist within a user's\n   Personal Namespace.\n   The namespaces\
    \ a server uses MAY differ on a per-user basis.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in [RFC-2119].\n"
- title: 3. Introduction and Overview
  contents:
  - "3. Introduction and Overview\n   Clients often attempt to create mailboxes for\
    \ such purposes as\n   maintaining a record of sent messages (e.g. \"Sent Mail\"\
    ) or\n   temporarily saving messages being composed (e.g. \"Drafts\").  For\n\
    \   these clients to inter-operate correctly with the variety of IMAP4\n   servers\
    \ available, the user must enter the prefix of the Personal\n   Namespace used\
    \ by the server.  Using the NAMESPACE command, a client\n   is able to automatically\
    \ discover this prefix without manual user\n   configuration.\n   In addition,\
    \ users are often required to manually enter the prefixes\n   of various namespaces\
    \ in order to view the mailboxes located there.\n   For example, they might be\
    \ required to enter the prefix of #shared to\n   view the shared mailboxes namespace.\
    \ The NAMESPACE command allows a\n   client to automatically discover the namespaces\
    \ that are available on\n   a server. This allows a client to present the available\
    \ namespaces to\n   the user in what ever manner it deems appropriate.  For example,\
    \ a\n   client could choose to initially display only personal mailboxes, or\n\
    \   it may choose to display the complete list of mailboxes available,\n   and\
    \ initially position the user at the root of their Personal\n   Namespace.\n \
    \  A server MAY choose to make available to the NAMESPACE command only a\n   subset\
    \ of the complete set of namespaces the server supports. To\n   provide the ability\
    \ to access these namespaces, a client SHOULD allow\n   the user the ability to\
    \ manually enter a namespace prefix.\n"
- title: 4. Requirements
  contents:
  - "4. Requirements\n   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword\n\
    \   NAMESPACE in their CAPABILITY response.\n   The NAMESPACE command is valid\
    \ in the Authenticated and Selected\n   state.\n"

    \ and Shared\n                 Namespace(s) that the server wishes to expose.\
    \ The\n                 response will contain a NIL for any namespace class\n\
    \                 that is not available. Namespace_Response_Extensions\n     \

    \ command completed\n   The prefix string allows a client to do things such as\
    \ automatically\n   creating personal mailboxes or LISTing all available mailboxes\
    \ within\n   a namespace.\n   Example 5.5:\n   ===========\n      < A server that\

    \ command completed\n   Although typically a server will support only a single\
    \ Personal\n   Namespace, and a single Other User's Namespace, circumstances exist\n\
    \   where there MAY be multiples of these, and a client MUST be prepared\n   for\
    \ them.   If a client is configured such that it is required to\n   create a certain\
    \ mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is\n   unclear which Personal Namespaces\
    \ it should create the mailbox in.\n   In these situations a client SHOULD let\
    \ the user select which\n   namespaces to create the mailbox in.\n   Example 5.6:\n\
    \   ===========\n      < In this example, a server supports 2 Personal Namespaces.\

    \      move that message to a mailbox called 'Deleted Items'.>\n      < Note that\
    \ this example demonstrates how some extension flags can\n      be passed to further\

    \ prompted to select a namespace and\n      only one 'Sent Mail' mailbox is created.\
    \ >\n      C: A002 CREATE \"Sent Mail\"\n      S: A002 OK CREATE command completed\n\

    \ the Other Users' Namespace\n   prefix SHOULD consist of <username>, where <username>\
    \ is a user name\n   as per the IMAP4 LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE command.\n   A client\
    \ can construct a LIST command by appending a \"%\" to the Other\n   Users' Namespace\
    \ prefix to discover the Personal Namespaces of other\n   users that are available\
    \ to the currently authenticated user.\n   In response to such a LIST command,\
    \ a server SHOULD NOT return user\n   names that have not granted access to their\
    \ personal mailboxes to the\n   user in question.\n   A server MAY return a LIST\
    \ response containing only the names of\n   users that have explicitly granted\
    \ access to the user in question.\n   Alternatively, a server MAY return NO to\
    \ such a LIST command,\n   requiring that a user name be included with the Other\
    \ Users'\n   Namespace prefix before listing any other user's mailboxes.\n   Example\
    \ 5.7:\n   ===========\n      < A server that supports providing a list of other\

    \   Historical convention has been to start all namespaces with the \"#\"\n  \
    \ character.  Namespaces that include the \"#\" character are not IMAP\n   URL\
    \ [IMAP-URL] friendly requiring the \"#\" character to be represented\n   as %23\
    \ when within URLs.  As such, server implementers MAY instead\n   consider using\
    \ namespace prefixes that do not contain the \"#\"\n   character.\n"
