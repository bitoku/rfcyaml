- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides a baseline for using IPv6 to communicate\
    \ among\n   nodes in range of one another over a single IEEE 802.11-OCB link\n\
    \   [IEEE-802.11-2016] (a.k.a., 802.11p; see Appendices A, B, and C) with\n  \
    \ minimal changes to existing stacks.  Moreover, the document\n   identifies the\
    \ limitations of such usage.  Concretely, the document\n   describes the layering\
    \ of IPv6 networking on top of the IEEE Std\n   802.11 MAC layer or an IEEE Std\
    \ 802.3 MAC layer with a frame\n   translation underneath.  The resulting stack\
    \ is derived from IPv6\n   over Ethernet [RFC2464] but operates over 802.11-OCB\
    \ to provide at\n   least P2P (point-to-point) connectivity using IPv6 Neighbor\
    \ Discovery\n   (ND) and link-local addresses.\n   The IPv6 network layer operates\
    \ on 802.11-OCB in the same manner as\n   operating on the Ethernet with the following\
    \ exceptions:\n   *  Exceptions due to the different operation of the IPv6 network\n\
    \      layer on 802.11 compared to the Ethernet.  The operation of IP on\n   \
    \   Ethernet is described in [RFC1042] and [RFC2464].\n   *  Exceptions due to\
    \ the OCB nature of 802.11-OCB compared to 802.11.\n      This has impacts on\
    \ security, privacy, subnet structure, and\n      movement detection.  Security\
    \ and privacy recommendations are\n      discussed in Sections 4.4 and 5.  The\
    \ subnet structure is\n      described in Section 4.6.  The movement detection\
    \ on OCB links is\n      not described in this document.  Likewise, ND extensions\
    \ and IP\n      Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE) optimizations\n\
    \      for vehicular communications are not in scope of this document.\n     \
    \ The expectation is that further specifications will be edited to\n      cover\
    \ more complex vehicular networking scenarios.\n   The reader may refer to [IPWAVE]\
    \ for an overview of problems related\n   to running IPv6 over 802.11-OCB.  It\
    \ is out of scope of this document\n   to reiterate those problems.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n   The document makes uses of the following terms:\n\
    \   IP-OBU (Internet Protocol On-Board Unit):\n      An IP-OBU denotes a computer\
    \ situated in a vehicle such as a car,\n      bicycle, or similar.  It has at\
    \ least one IP interface that runs\n      in mode OCB of 802.11 and has an \"\
    OBU\" transceiver.  See the\n      definition of the term \"OBU\" in Appendix\
    \ H.\n   IP-RSU (IP Roadside Unit):\n      An IP-RSU is situated along the road.\
    \  It has at least two\n      distinct IP-enabled interfaces.  The wireless PHY/MAC\
    \ layer of at\n      least one of its IP-enabled interfaces is configured to operate\
    \ in\n      802.11-OCB mode.  An IP-RSU communicates with the IP-OBU over an\n\
    \      802.11 wireless link operating in OCB mode.  An IP-RSU is similar\n   \
    \   to an Access Network Router (ANR), defined in [RFC3753], and a\n      Wireless\
    \ Termination Point (WTP), defined in [RFC5415].\n   OCB (outside the context\
    \ of a Basic Service Set - BSS):\n      This is a mode of operation in which a\
    \ station (STA) is not a\n      member of a BSS and does not utilize IEEE Std\
    \ 802.11\n      authentication, association, or data confidentiality.\n   802.11-OCB:\n\
    \      This refers to the mode specified in IEEE Std 802.11-2016 when the\n  \
    \    MIB attribute dot11OCBActivited is 'true'.\n"

  - "3.  Communication Scenarios Where IEEE 802.11-OCB Links Are Used\n   IEEE 802.11-OCB\

    \   vehicular networks, STAs can be IP-RSUs and/or IP-OBUs.  All links\n   are\
    \ assumed to be P2P, and multiple links can be on one radio\n   interface.  While\

    \ QoS data\n   frames whose format is specified in an IEEE 802.11 spec\n   [IEEE-802.11-2016].\n\
    \   The IPv6 packet transmitted on 802.11-OCB is immediately preceded by\n   a\
    \ Logical Link Control (LLC) header and an 802.11 header.  In the LLC\n   header\

    \ and time-\n   sensitive traffic, including the ones listed in [ETSI-sec-archi].\n\
    \   To simplify the Application Programming Interface (API) between the\n   operating\

    \ types of\n   addresses, only the IPv6 link-local addresses can be formed using\
    \ an\n   EUI-64 identifier, particularly during transition time (the period of\n\
    \   time before an interface starts using an address different from the\n   LL\
    \ one).\n   If the IPv6 link-local address is formed using an EUI-64 identifier,\n\
    \   then the mechanism for forming that address is the same mechanism as\n   that\
    \ used to form an IPv6 link-local address on Ethernet links.\n   Moreover, regardless\
    \ of whether the interface identifier is derived\n   from the EUI-64 identifier,\
    \ its length is 64 bits, as is the case for\n   the Ethernet [RFC2464].\n"
- title: 4.4.  Stateless Autoconfiguration
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Stateless Autoconfiguration\n   The steps a host takes in deciding how\
    \ to autoconfigure its\n   interfaces in IPv6 are described in [RFC4862].  This\
    \ section\n   describes the formation of Interface Identifiers for 'Global' or\n\
    \   'Unique Local' IPv6 addresses.  Interface Identifiers for 'link-\n   local'\
    \ IPv6 addresses are discussed in Section 4.3.\n   The RECOMMENDED method for\
    \ forming stable Interface Identifiers\n   (IIDs) is described in [RFC8064]. \
    \ The method of forming IIDs\n   described in Section 4 of [RFC2464] MAY be used\
    \ during transition\n   time, particularly for IPv6 link-local addresses.  Regardless\
    \ of the\n   method used to form the IID, its length is 64 bits, similarly to\
    \ IPv6\n   over Ethernet [RFC2464].\n   The bits in the IID have no specific meaning,\
    \ and the identifier\n   should be treated as an opaque value.  The bits 'Universal'\
    \ and\n   'Group' in the identifier of an 802.11-OCB interface, which is an\n\
    \   IEEE link-layer address, are significant.  The details of this\n   significance\
    \ are described in [RFC7136].\n   Semantically opaque IIDs, instead of meaningful\
    \ IIDs derived from a\n   valid and meaningful MAC address ([RFC2464], Section\
    \ 4), help avoid\n   certain privacy risks (see the risks mentioned in Section\
    \ 5.1.1).  If\n   semantically opaque IIDs are needed, they may be generated using\
    \ the\n   method for generating semantically opaque IIDs with IPv6 Stateless\n\
    \   Address Autoconfiguration given in [RFC7217].  Typically, an opaque\n   IID\
    \ is formed starting from identifiers different from the MAC\n   addresses and\
    \ from cryptographically strong material.  Thus, privacy-\n   sensitive information\
    \ is absent from Interface IDs because it is\n   impossible to calculate back\
    \ the initial value from which the\n   Interface ID was first generated.\n   Some\
    \ applications that use IPv6 packets on 802.11-OCB links (among\n   other link\
    \ types) may benefit from IPv6 addresses whose IIDs don't\n   change too often.\
    \  It is RECOMMENDED to use the mechanisms described\n   in [RFC7217] to permit\
    \ the use of stable IIDs that do not change\n   within one subnet prefix.  A possible\
    \ source for the Net_Iface\n   parameter is a virtual interface name or logical\
    \ interface name that\n   is decided by a local administrator.\n"

- title: 4.6.  Subnet Structure
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Subnet Structure\n   When vehicles are in close range, a subnet may be\
    \ formed over\n   802.11-OCB interfaces (not by their in-vehicle interfaces).\
    \  A Prefix\n   List conceptual data structure ([RFC4861], Section 5.1) is maintained\n\
    \   for each 802.11-OCB interface.\n   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND)\
    \ requires reflexive\n   properties (bidirectional connectivity), which is generally,\
    \ though\n   not always, the case for P2P OCB links.  IPv6 ND also requires\n\
    \   transitive properties for DAD and AR, so an IPv6 subnet can be mapped\n  \
    \ on an OCB network only if all nodes in the network share a single\n   physical\
    \ broadcast domain.  The extension to IPv6 ND operating on a\n   subnet that covers\
    \ multiple OCB links and does not fully overlap\n   (i.e., non-broadcast multi-access\
    \ (NBMA)) is not in scope of this\n   document.  Finally, IPv6 ND requires permanent\
    \ connectivity of all\n   nodes in the subnet to defend their addresses -- in\
    \ other words, very\n   stable network conditions.\n   The structure of this subnet\
    \ is ephemeral in that it is strongly\n   influenced by the mobility of vehicles:\
    \ the hidden terminal effects\n   appear, and the 802.11 networks in OCB mode\
    \ may be considered ad hoc\n   networks with an addressing model, as described\
    \ in [RFC5889].  On the\n   other hand, the structure of the internal subnets\
    \ in each vehicle is\n   relatively stable.\n   As recommended in [RFC5889], when\
    \ the timing requirements are very\n   strict (e.g., fast-drive-through IP-RSU\
    \ coverage), no on-link subnet\n   prefix should be configured on an 802.11-OCB\
    \ interface.  In such\n   cases, the exclusive use of IPv6 link-local addresses\
    \ is RECOMMENDED.\n   Additionally, even if the timing requirements are not very\
    \ strict\n   (e.g., the moving subnet formed by two following vehicles is stable,\n\
    \   a fixed IP-RSU is absent), the subnet is disconnected from the\n   Internet\
    \ (i.e., a default route is absent), and the addressing peers\n   are equally\
    \ qualified (that is, it is impossible to determine whether\n   some vehicle owns\
    \ and distributes addresses to others), the use of\n   link-local addresses is\
    \ RECOMMENDED.\n   The baseline ND protocol [RFC4861] MUST be supported over 802.11-OCB\n\
    \   links.  Transmitting ND packets may prove to have some performance\n   issues,\
    \ as mentioned in Section 4.5.2 and Appendix I.  These issues\n   may be exacerbated\
    \ in OCB mode.  Solutions for these problems should\n   consider the OCB mode\
    \ of operation.  Future solutions to OCB should\n   consider solutions for avoiding\
    \ broadcast.  The best of current\n   knowledge indicates the kinds of issues\
    \ that may arise with ND in OCB\n   mode; they are described in Appendix I.\n\
    \   Protocols like Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] [RFC3963] and DNAv6 [RFC6059],\n   which\
    \ depend on timely movement detection, might need additional\n   tuning work to\
    \ handle the lack of link-layer notifications during\n   handover.  This topic\
    \ is left for further study.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Any security mechanism at the IP layer or above\
    \ that may be\n   implemented for the general case of IPv6 may also be implemented\
    \ for\n   IPv6 operating over 802.11-OCB.\n   The OCB operation does not use existing\
    \ 802.11 link-layer security\n   mechanisms.  There is no encryption applied below\
    \ the network layer\n   running on 802.11-OCB.  At the application layer, the\
    \ IEEE 1609.2\n   document [IEEE-1609.2] provides security services for certain\n\
    \   applications to use; application-layer mechanisms are out of scope of\n  \
    \ this document.  On the other hand, a security mechanism provided at\n   the\
    \ networking layer, such as IPsec [RFC4301], may provide data\n   security protection\
    \ to a wider range of applications.\n   802.11-OCB does not provide any cryptographic\
    \ protection because it\n   operates outside the context of a BSS (no Association\
    \ Request/\n   Response or Challenge messages).  Therefore, an attacker can sniff\
    \ or\n   inject traffic while within range of a vehicle or IP-RSU (by setting\n\
    \   an interface card's frequency to the proper range).  Also, an\n   attacker\
    \ may not adhere to the legal limits for radio power and can\n   use a very sensitive\
    \ directional antenna; if attackers wish to attack\n   a given exchange, they\
    \ do not necessarily need to be in close\n   physical proximity.  Hence, such\
    \ a link is less protected than\n   commonly used links (a wired link or the aforementioned\
    \ 802.11 links\n   with link-layer security).\n   Therefore, any node can join\
    \ a subnet and directly communicate with\n   any nodes on the subset, including\
    \ potentially impersonating another\n   node.  This design allows for a number\
    \ of threats outlined in\n   Section 3 of [RFC6959].  While not widely deployed,\
    \ SEND [RFC3971]\n   [RFC3972] is a solution that can address spoof-based attack\
    \ vectors.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Privacy Considerations\n   As with all Ethernet and 802.11 interface identifiers\
    \ [RFC7721], the\n   identifier of an 802.11-OCB interface may involve privacy,\
    \ MAC\n   address spoofing, and IP hijacking risks.  A vehicle embarking an IP-\n\
    \   OBU whose egress interface is 802.11-OCB may expose itself to\n   eavesdropping\
    \ and subsequent correlation of data.  This may reveal\n   data considered private\
    \ by the vehicle owner; there is a risk of\n   being tracked.  In outdoor public\
    \ environments, where vehicles\n   typically circulate, the privacy risks are\
    \ greater than in indoor\n   settings.  It is highly likely that attacker sniffers\
    \ are deployed\n   along routes that listen for IEEE frames, including IP packets,\
    \ of\n   vehicles passing by.  For this reason, in 802.11-OCB deployments,\n \
    \  there is a strong necessity to use protection tools such as\n   dynamically\
    \ changing MAC addresses (Section 5.2), semantically opaque\n   Interface Identifiers,\
    \ and stable Interface Identifiers\n   (Section 4.4).  An example of a change\
    \ policy is to change the MAC\n   address of the OCB interface each time the system\
    \ boots up.  This may\n   help mitigate privacy risks to a certain level.  Furthermore,\
    \ for\n   privacy concerns, [RFC8065] recommends using an address-generation\n\
    \   scheme rather than generating addresses from a fixed link-layer\n   address.\
    \  However, there are some specificities related to vehicles.\n   Since roaming\
    \ is an important characteristic of moving vehicles, the\n   use of the same Link-Local\
    \ Address over time can indicate the\n   presence of the same vehicle in different\
    \ places and thus lead to\n   location tracking.  Hence, a vehicle should get\

    \ ID information\n   present in the MAC addresses of a large number of cars (e.g.,\n\
    \   listening for Router Advertisements or other IPv6 application data\n   packets,\
    \ and recording the value of the source address in these\n   packets).  Further\
    \ correlation of this information with other data\n   captured by other means\
    \ or other visual information (e.g., car color)\n   may constitute privacy risks.\n"

  - "5.2.  MAC Address and Interface ID Generation\n   In 802.11-OCB networks, the\
    \ MAC addresses may change during well-\n   defined renumbering events.  At the\
    \ moment the MAC address is changed\n   on an 802.11-OCB interface, all the Interface\
    \ Identifiers of IPv6\n   addresses assigned to that interface MUST change.\n\
    \   Implementations should use a policy dictating when the MAC address is\n  \
    \ changed on the 802.11-OCB interface.  For more information on the\n   motivation\
    \ of this policy, please refer to the privacy discussion in\n   Appendix B.\n\
    \   A 'randomized' MAC address has the following characteristics:\n   *  The \"\
    Local/Global\" bit is set to \"locally administered\".\n   *  The \"Unicast/Multicast\"\
    \ bit is set to \"Unicast\".\n   *  The 46 remaining bits are set to a random\
    \ value using a random\n      number generator that meets the requirements of\
    \ [RFC4086].\n   To meet the randomization requirements for the 46 remaining bits,\
    \ a\n   hash function may be used.  For example, the hash function defined in\n\
    \   [SHA256] may be used with the input of a 256-bit local secret, the\n   'nominal'\
    \ MAC address of the interface, and a representation of the\n   date and time\
    \ of the renumbering event.\n   A randomized Interface ID has the same characteristics\
    \ of a\n   randomized MAC address except for the length in bits.\n"

  - "5.3.  Pseudonymization Impact on Confidentiality and Trust\n   Vehicle and drivers\
    \ privacy relies on pseudonymization mechanisms\n   such as the ones described\
    \ in Section 5.2.  This pseudonymization\n   means that upper-layer protocols\
    \ and applications SHOULD NOT rely on\n   layer-2 or layer-3 addresses to assume\
    \ that the other participant can\n   be trusted.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Aspects Introduced by OCB Mode to 802.11\n   In IEEE 802.11-OCB\
    \ mode, all nodes in the wireless range can directly\n   communicate with each\
    \ other without involving authentication or\n   association procedures.  In OCB\
    \ mode, the manner in which channels\n   are selected and used is simplified compared\
    \ to when in BSS mode.\n   Contrary to BSS mode, at the link layer, it is necessary\
    \ to\n   statically set the same channel number (or frequency) on two stations\n\
    \   that need to communicate with each other (in BSS mode, this channel\n   set\
    \ operation is performed automatically during 'scanning').  The\n   manner in\
    \ which stations set their channel number in OCB mode is not\n   specified in\
    \ this document.  Stations STA1 and STA2 can exchange IP\n   packets only if they\
    \ are set to the same channel.  At the IP layer,\n   they then discover each other\
    \ by using the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   protocol.  The allocation of a particular\
    \ channel for a particular\n   use is defined statically in standards authored\
    \ by ETSI in Europe,\n   the FCC in the United States of America, and similar\
    \ organizations in\n   South Korea, Japan, and other parts of the world.\n   Briefly,\
    \ the IEEE 802.11-OCB mode has the following properties:\n   *  The use by each\
    \ node of a 'wildcard' BSS identifier (BSSID) (i.e.,\n      each bit of the BSSID\
    \ is set to 1).\n   *  No IEEE 802.11 beacon frames are transmitted.\n   *  No\
    \ authentication is required in order to be able to communicate.\n   *  No association\
    \ is needed in order to be able to communicate.\n   *  No encryption is provided\
    \ in order to be able to communicate.\n   *  Flag dot11OCBActivated is set to\
    \ \"true\".\n   All the nodes in the radio communication range (IP-OBU and IP-RSU)\n\
    \   receive all the messages transmitted (IP-OBU and IP-RSU) within the\n   radio\
    \ communication range.  The MAC CDMA function resolves any\n   eventual conflict(s).\n\
    \   The message exchange diagram in Figure 1 illustrates a comparison\n   between\
    \ traditional 802.11 and 802.11 in OCB mode.  The 'Data'\n   messages can be IP\
    \ packets such as HTTP or others.  Other 802.11\n   management and control frames\
    \ (non-IP) may be transmitted, as\n   specified in the 802.11 standard.  The names\
    \ of these messages as\n   currently specified by the 802.11 standard are listed\

    \ on 802.11 (Left)\n                           and 802.11-OCB (Right)\n   The\
    \ 802.11-OCB interface was specified in [IEEE-802.11p-2010],\n   Amendment 6:\
    \ Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments, as an\n   amendment to [IEEE-802.11-2007].\
    \  Since then, this amendment has been\n   integrated into [IEEE-802.11-2012]\
    \ and [IEEE-802.11-2016].\n   In [IEEE-802.11p-2010], anything qualified specifically\
    \ as\n   \"OCBActivated\" or \"outside the context of a basic service\" that is\n\
    \   set to be \"true\" actually refers to OCB aspects introduced to 802.11.\n\
    \   In order to delineate the aspects introduced by 802.11-OCB to 802.11,\n  \
    \ we refer to the earlier [IEEE-802.11p-2010].  The amendment is\n   concerned\
    \ with vehicular communications, where the wireless link is\n   similar to that\
    \ of Wireless LAN (using a PHY layer specified by\n   802.11a/b/g/n) but needs\
    \ to cope with the high mobility factor\n   inherent in scenarios of communications\
    \ between moving vehicles and\n   between vehicles and fixed infrastructure deployed\
    \ along roads.\n   While 'p' is a letter identifying the Amendment, just like\
    \ 'a', 'b',\n   'g', and 'n' are, 'p' is concerned more with MAC modifications\
    \ and is\n   slightly concerned with PHY modifications; the others are mainly\n\
    \   about PHY modifications.  It is possible in practice to combine a 'p'\n  \
    \ MAC with an 'a' PHY by operating outside the context of a BSS with\n   Orthogonal\
    \ Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) at 5.4 GHz and 5.9\n   GHz.\n   The 802.11-OCB\
    \ links are specified to be as compatible as possible\n   with the behavior of\
    \ 802.11a/b/g/n and future generation IEEE WLAN\n   links.  From the IP perspective,\
    \ an 802.11-OCB MAC layer offers\n   practically the same interface to IP as 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ and 802.3.  A\n   packet sent by an IP-OBU may be received by one or multiple\
    \ IP-RSUs.\n   The link-layer resolution is performed by using the IPv6 Neighbor\n\
    \   Discovery protocol.\n   To support this similarity statement (IPv6 is layered\
    \ on top of LLC\n   on top of 802.11-OCB in the same way that IPv6 is layered\
    \ on top of\n   LLC on top of 802.11a/b/g/n (for WLAN) or on top of LLC on top\
    \ of\n   802.3 (for Ethernet)), it is useful to analyze the differences\n   between\
    \ the 802.11-OCB and 802.11 specifications.  During this\n   analysis, we note\
    \ that whereas 802.11-OCB lists relatively complex\n   and numerous changes to\
    \ the MAC layer (and very few to the PHY\n   layer), there are only a few characteristics\
    \ that may be important\n   for an implementation transmitting IPv6 packets on\
    \ 802.11-OCB links.\n   The most important 802.11-OCB aspect that influences the\
    \ IPv6\n   functioning is the OCB characteristic; an additional, less direct\n\
    \   influence is the maximum bandwidth afforded by the PHY modulation/\n   demodulation\
    \ methods and channel access specified by 802.11-OCB.  The\n   maximum bandwidth\
    \ theoretically possible in 802.11-OCB is 54 Mbit/s\n   (when using, for example,\
    \ the following parameters: a 20 MHz channel;\n   modulation of 64-QAM; a coding\
    \ rate R of 3/4).  With regard to IP\n   over 802.11-OCB, in practice, a commonly\
    \ observed figure is 12 Mbit/\n   s; this bandwidth allows the operation of a\
    \ wide range of protocols\n   relying on IPv6.\n   *  Operation outside the context\
    \ of a BSS (OCB): The 802.11-OCB links\n      (previously 802.11p) are operated\
    \ without a BSS.  This means that\n      IEEE 802.11 beacon, Association Request/Response,\
    \ Authentication\n      Request/Response, and similar frames are not used.  The\
    \ used\n      identifier of BSS (BSSID) always has a hexadecimal value of\n  \
    \    0xffffffffffff (48 '1' bits, represented as MAC address\n      ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff;\
    \ otherwise, the 'wildcard' BSSID), as opposed to\n      an arbitrary BSSID value\
    \ set by an administrator (e.g., 'My-Home-\n      AccessPoint').  The OCB operation\
    \ -- namely, the lack of beacon-\n      based scanning and lack of authentication\
    \ -- should be taken into\n      account when the Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC6275]\
    \ and the protocols\n      for IP layer security [RFC4301] are used.  The way\
    \ these protocols\n      adapt to OCB is not described in this document.\n   *\
    \  Timing Advertisement: This is a new message defined in 802.11-OCB\n      that\
    \ does not exist in 802.11a/b/g/n.  This message is used by\n      stations to\
    \ inform other stations about the value of time.  It is\n      similar to the\
    \ time delivered by a Global Navigation Satellite\n      System (GNSS) (e.g.,\
    \ Galileo, GPS, etc.) or by a cellular system.\n      This message is optional\
    \ for implementation.\n   *  Frequency range: This is a characteristic of the\
    \ PHY layer; it has\n      almost no impact on the interface between MAC and IP.\
    \  However, it\n      is worth considering that the frequency range is regulated\
    \ by a\n      regional authority (ARCEP, ECC/CEPT based on ENs from ETSI, FCC,\n\
    \      etc.); as part of the regulation process, specific applications\n     \
    \ are associated with specific frequency ranges.  In the case of\n      802.11-OCB,\
    \ the regulator associates a set of frequency ranges or\n      slots within a\
    \ band to the use of applications of vehicular\n      communications in a band\
    \ known as \"5.9 GHz\".  The 5.9 GHz band is\n      different from the 2.4 GHz\
    \ and 5 GHz bands used by Wireless LAN.\n      However, as with Wireless LAN,\
    \ the operation of 802.11-OCB in 5.9\n      GHz bands does not require a license\
    \ in the EU (in the US, the 5.9\n      GHz is a licensed band of spectrum; for\
    \ the fixed infrastructure,\n      explicit FCC authorization is required; for\
    \ an on-board device, a\n      'licensed-by-rule' concept applies, where rule\
    \ certification\n      conformity is required).  Technical conditions are different\
    \ from\n      those of the \"2.4 GHz\" or \"5 GHz\" bands.  The allowed power\
    \ levels\n      and, implicitly, the maximum allowed distance between vehicles\
    \ is\n      33 dBm for 802.11-OCB (in Europe) compared to 20 dBm for Wireless\n\
    \      LAN 802.11a/b/g/n; this leads to a maximum distance of\n      approximately\
    \ 1 km compared to approximately 50 m.  Additionally,\n      specific conditions\
    \ related to congestion avoidance, jamming\n      avoidance, and radar detection\
    \ are imposed on the use of DSRC (in\n      the US) and on the use of frequencies\
    \ for Intelligent\n      Transportation Systems (in the EU) compared to Wireless\
    \ LAN\n      (802.11a/b/g/n).\n   *  'Half-rate' encoding: As the frequency range,\
    \ this parameter is\n      related to PHY and thus does not have much impact on\
    \ the interface\n      between the IP layer and the MAC layer.\n   *  In vehicular\
    \ communications using 802.11-OCB links, there are\n      strong privacy requirements\
    \ with respect to addressing.  While the\n      802.11-OCB standard does not specify\
    \ anything in particular with\n      respect to MAC addresses, in these settings,\
    \ there is a strong\n      need for a dynamic change of these addresses (as opposed\
    \ to the\n      non-vehicular settings -- real wall protection -- where fixed\
    \ MAC\n      addresses do not currently pose privacy risks).  This is further\n\
    \      described in Section 5.  A relevant function is described in\n      [IEEE-1609.3]\
    \ and [IEEE-1609.4].\n"

    \ stack's physical and\n   MAC layers, but all the induced modifications can be\
    \ quite easily\n   obtained by modifying an existing 802.11a ad hoc stack.\n \
    \  The conditions for 802.11a hardware to be compliant with 802.11-OCB\n   are\

    \   *  The chip should be able to transmit up to 44.8 dBm when used in\n     \
    \ the United States and up to 33 dBm in Europe; other regional\n      conditions\
    \ apply.\n   Changes needed on the network stack in OCB mode are as follows:\n\
    \   *  Physical layer:\n      -  Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access\
    \ The chip must use\n         the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access\
    \ (OFDMA)\n         encoding mode.\n      -  The chip must be set to half-mode\
    \ rate mode (the internal clock\n         frequency is divided by two).\n    \
    \  -  The chip must use dedicated channels and should allow the use\n        \
    \ of higher emission powers.  This may require modifications to\n         the\
    \ local computer file that describes regulatory domains rules\n         if used\

    \ of\n         subtype Action and Timing Advertisement (defined below).\n    \
    \  -  No encryption key or method must be used.\n      -  Packet emission and\

- title: Appendix I.  Neighbor Discovery (ND) Potential Issues in Wireless Links
  contents:
  - "Appendix I.  Neighbor Discovery (ND) Potential Issues in Wireless Links\n   IPv6\
    \ Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) [RFC4861] [RFC4862] was designed\n   for point-to-point\
    \ and transit links, such as Ethernet, with the\n   expectation of cheap and reliable\
    \ support for multicast from the\n   lower layer.  Section 3.2 of [RFC4861] indicates\
    \ that the operation\n   on shared media and on NBMA networks require additional\
    \ support,\n   e.g., for AR and DAD, which depend on multicast.  An\n   infrastructureless\
    \ radio network such as OCB shares properties with\n   both shared media and NBMA\
    \ networks and then adds its own complexity,\n   e.g., from movement and interference\
    \ that allow only transient and\n   non-transitive reachability between any set\
    \ of peers.\n   The uniqueness of an address within a scoped domain is a key pillar\n\
    \   of IPv6 and is the basis for unicast IP communication.  [RFC4861]\n   details\
    \ the DAD method to prevent an address from being duplicated.\n   For a link-local\
    \ address, the scope is the link, whereas for a\n   globally reachable address,\
    \ the scope is much larger.  The underlying\n   assumption for DAD to operate\
    \ correctly is that the node that owns an\n   IPv6 address can reach any other\
    \ node within the scope at the time it\n   claims its address, which is done by\
    \ sending a Neighbor Solicitation\n   (NS) multicast message, and can hear any\
    \ future claim for that\n   address by another party within the scope for the\
    \ duration of the\n   address ownership.\n   In the case of OCB, there is a potentially\
    \ a need to define a scope\n   that is compatible with DAD.  The scope cannot\
    \ be the set of nodes\n   that a transmitter can reach at a particular time because\
    \ that set\n   varies all the time and does not meet the DAD requirements for\
    \ a\n   link-local address that can be used anytime and anywhere.  The\n   generic\
    \ expectation of a reliable multicast is not ensured, and the\n   operation of\
    \ DAD and AR as specified by [RFC4861] cannot be\n   guaranteed.  Moreover, multicast\
    \ transmissions that rely on broadcast\n   are not only unreliable but are also\
    \ often detrimental to unicast\n   traffic (see [IEEE802-MCAST]).\n   Early experience\
    \ indicates that it should be possible to exchange\n   IPv6 packets over OCB while\
    \ relying on IPv6 ND alone for DAD and AR\n   (Address Resolution) in good conditions.\
    \  In the absence of a correct\n   DAD operation, a node that relies only on IPv6\
    \ ND for AR and DAD over\n   OCB should ensure that the addresses that it uses\
    \ are unique by means\n   other than DAD.  It must be noted that deriving an IPv6\
    \ address from\n   a globally unique MAC address has this property but may yield\
    \ privacy\n   issues.\n   [RFC8505] provides a more recent approach to IPv6 ND,\
    \ in particular\n   DAD.  [RFC8505] is designed to fit wireless and otherwise\
    \ constrained\n   networks whereby multicast and/or continuous access to the medium\
    \ may\n   not be guaranteed.  [RFC8505], Section 5.6 (\"Link-Local Addresses and\n\
    \   Registration\") indicates that the scope of uniqueness for a link-\n   local\
    \ address is restricted to a pair of nodes that uses it to\n   communicate and\
    \ provides a method to assert the uniqueness and\n   resolve the link-layer address\
    \ using a unicast exchange.\n   [RFC8505] also enables a router (acting as a 6LR)\
    \ to own a prefix and\n   act as a registrar (acting as a 6LBR) for addresses\
    \ within the\n   associated subnet.  A peer host (acting as a 6LN) registers an\n\
    \   address derived from that prefix and can use it for the lifetime of\n   the\
    \ registration.  The prefix is advertised as not on-link, which\n   means that\
    \ the 6LN uses the 6LR to relay its packets within the\n   subnet, and participation\
    \ to the subnet is constrained to the time of\n   reachability to the 6LR.  Note\
    \ that an RSU that provides internet\n   connectivity MAY announce a default router\
    \ preference [RFC4191],\n   whereas a car that does not provide that connectivity\
    \ MUST NOT do so.\n   This operation presents similarities to that of an access\
    \ point, but\n   at Layer 3.  This is why [RFC8505] is well suited for wireless\
    \ in\n   general.\n   Support of [RFC8505] may be implemented on OCB.  OCB nodes\
    \ that\n   support [RFC8505] SHOULD support the 6LN operation in order to act\
    \ as\n   a host and may support the 6LR and 6LBR operations in order to act as\n\
    \   a router and in particular to own a prefix that can be used by hosts\n   that\
    \ are compliant with [RFC8505] for address autoconfiguration and\n   registration.\n"
