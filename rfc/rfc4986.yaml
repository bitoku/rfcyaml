  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Every DNS security-aware resolver must have at least one Trust Anchor\n\
    \   to use as the basis for validating responses from DNS signed zones.\n   For\
    \ various reasons, most DNS security-aware resolvers are expected\n   to have\
    \ several Trust Anchors.  For some operations, manual\n   monitoring and updating\
    \ of Trust Anchors may be feasible, but many\n   operations will require automated\
    \ methods for updating Trust Anchors\n   in their security-aware resolvers.  This\
    \ document identifies the\n   requirements that must be met by an automated DNS\
    \ Trust Anchor\n   rollover solution for security-aware DNS resolvers.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), as\
    \ described in\n   [2], [3], and [4], define new records and protocol modifications\
    \ to\n   DNS that permit security-aware resolvers to validate DNS Resource\n \
    \  Records (RRs) from one or more Trust Anchors held by such security-\n   aware\
    \ resolvers.\n   Security-aware resolvers will have to initially obtain their\
    \ Trust\n   Anchors in a trustworthy manner to ensure the Trust Anchors are\n\
    \   correct and valid.  There are a number of ways that this initial step\n  \
    \ can be accomplished; however, details of this step are beyond the\n   scope\
    \ of this document.  Once an operator has obtained Trust Anchors,\n   initially\
    \ entering the Trust Anchors into their security-aware\n   resolvers will in many\
    \ instances be a manual operation.\n   For some operational environments, manual\
    \ management of Trust Anchors\n   might be a viable approach.  However, many operational\
    \ environments\n   will require a more automated, specification-based method for\n\
    \   updating and managing Trust Anchors.  This document provides a list\n   of\
    \ requirements that can be used to measure the effectiveness of any\n   proposed\
    \ automated Trust Anchor rollover mechanism in a consistent\n   manner.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [1].\n   The use of RFC 2119 words in the requirements is intended to\n\
    \   unambiguously describe a requirement.  If a tradeoff is to be made\n   between\
    \ conflicting requirements when choosing a solution, the\n   requirement with\
    \ MUST language will have higher preference than\n   requirements with SHOULD,\
    \ MAY, or RECOMMENDED language.  It is\n   understood that a tradeoff may need\
    \ to be made between requirements\n   that both contain RFC 2119 language.\n"
- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   DNS resolvers need to have one or more starting points to\
    \ use in\n   obtaining DNS answers.  The starting points for stub resolvers are\n\
    \   normally the IP addresses for one or more recursive name servers.\n   The\
    \ starting points for recursive name servers are normally IP\n   addresses for\
    \ DNS Root name servers.  Similarly, security-aware\n   resolvers must have one\
    \ or more starting points to use for building\n   the authenticated chain to validate\
    \ a signed DNS response.  Instead\n   of IP addresses, DNSSEC requires that each\
    \ resolver trust one or more\n   DNSKEY RRs or DS RRs as their starting point.\
    \  Each of these starting\n   points is called a Trust Anchor.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that DNSKEY RRs and DS RRs are not Trust Anchors\n   when they are created\
    \ by the signed zone operator nor are they Trust\n   Anchors because the records\
    \ are published in the signed zone.  A\n   DNSKEY RR or DS RR becomes a Trust\
    \ Anchor when an operator of a\n   security-aware resolver determines that the\
    \ public key or hash will\n   be used as a Trust Anchor.  Thus, the signed zone\
    \ operator that\n   created and/or published these RRs may not know if any of\
    \ the DNSKEY\n   RRs or DS RRs associated with their zone are being used as Trust\n\
    \   Anchors by security-aware resolvers.  The obvious exceptions are the\n   DNSKEY\
    \ RRs for the Root Zone, which will be used as Trust Anchors by\n   many security-aware\
    \ resolvers.  For various reasons, DNSKEY RRs or DS\n   RRs from zones other than\
    \ Root can be used by operators of security-\n   aware resolvers as Trust Anchors.\
    \  It follows that responsibility\n   lies with the operator of the security-aware\
    \ resolver to ensure that\n   the DNSKEY and/or DS RRs they have chosen to use\
    \ as Trust Anchors are\n   valid at the time they are used by the security-aware\
    \ resolver as the\n   starting point for building the authentication chain to\
    \ validate a\n   signed DNS response.\n   When operators of security-aware resolvers\
    \ choose one or more Trust\n   Anchors, they must also determine the method(s)\
    \ they will use to\n   ensure that they are using valid RRs and that they are\
    \ able to\n   determine when RRs being used as Trust Anchors should be replaced\
    \ or\n   removed.  Early adopters of DNS signed zones have published\n   information\
    \ about the processes and methods they will use when their\n   DNSKEY and/or DS\
    \ RRs change so that operators of security-aware\n   resolvers can manually change\
    \ the Trust Anchors at the appropriate\n   time.  This manual approach will not\
    \ scale and, therefore, drives the\n   need for an automated specification-based\
    \ approach for rollover of\n   Trust Anchors for security-aware resolvers.\n"
- title: 4.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.  Definitions\n   This document uses the definitions contained in RFC 4033,\
    \ section 2,\n   plus the following additional definitions:\n   Trust Anchor:\
    \  From RFC 4033, \"A configured DNSKEY RR or DS RR hash\n      of a DNSKEY RR.\
    \  A validating security-aware resolver uses this\n      public key or hash as\
    \ a starting point for building the\n      authentication chain to a signed DNS\
    \ response.\"  Additionally, a\n      DNSKEY RR or DS RR is associated with precisely\
    \ one point in the\n      DNS hierarchy, i.e., one DNS zone.  Multiple Trust Anchors\
    \ MAY be\n      associated with each DNS zone and MAY be held by any number of\n\
    \      security-aware resolvers.  Security-aware resolvers MAY have Trust\n  \
    \    Anchors from multiple DNS zones.  Those responsible for the\n      operation\
    \ of security-aware resolvers are responsible for\n      determining the set of\
    \ RRs that will be used as Trust Anchors by\n      that resolver.\n   Initial\
    \ Trust Relationship:  Operators of security-aware resolvers\n      must ensure\
    \ that they initially obtain any Trust Anchors in a\n      trustworthy manner.\
    \  For example, the correctness of the Root Zone\n      DNSKEY RR(s) could be\
    \ verified by comparing what the operator\n      believes to be the Root Trust\
    \ Anchor(s) with several 'well-known'\n      sources such as the IANA web site,\
    \ the DNS published Root Zone and\n      the publication of the public key in\
    \ well-known hard-copy forms.\n      For other Trust Anchors, the operator must\
    \ ensure the accuracy and\n      validity of the DNSKEY and/or DS RRs before designating\
    \ them Trust\n      Anchors.  This might be accomplished through a combination\
    \ of\n      technical, procedural, and contractual relationships, or use other\n\
    \      existing trust relationships outside the current DNS protocol.\n   Trust\
    \ Anchor Distribution:  The method or methods used to convey the\n      DNSKEY\
    \ and/or DS RR(s) between the signed zone operator and the\n      security-aware\
    \ resolver operator.  The method or methods MUST be\n      deemed sufficiently\
    \ trustworthy by the operator of the security-\n      aware resolver to ensure\
    \ source authenticity and integrity of the\n      new RRs to maintain the Initial\
    \ Trust Relationship required to\n      designate those RRs as Trust Anchors.\n\
    \   Trust Anchor Maintenance:  Any change in a validating security-aware\n   \
    \   resolver to add a new Trust Anchor, delete an existing Trust\n      Anchor,\
    \ or replace an existing Trust Anchor with another.  This\n      change might\
    \ be accomplished manually or in some automated manner.\n      Those responsible\
    \ for the operation of the security-aware resolver\n      are responsible for\
    \ establishing policies and procedures to ensure\n      that a sufficient Initial\
    \ Trust Relationship is in place before\n      adding Trust Anchors for a particular\
    \ DNS zone to their security-\n      aware resolver configuration.\n   Trust Anchor\
    \ Revocation and Removal:  The invalidation of a\n      particular Trust Anchor\
    \ that results when the operator of the\n      signed zone revokes or removes\
    \ a DNSKEY RR or DS RR that is being\n      used as a Trust Anchor by any security-aware\
    \ resolver.  It is\n      possible that a zone administrator may invalidate more\
    \ than one RR\n      at one point in time; therefore, it MUST be clear to both\
    \ the zone\n      administrator and the security-aware resolver the exact RR(s)\
    \ that\n      have been revoked or removed so the proper Trust Anchor or Trust\n\
    \      Anchors are removed.\n   Trust Anchor Rollover:  The method or methods\
    \ necessary for the\n      secure replacement of one or multiple Trust Anchors\
    \ held by\n      security-aware resolvers.  Trust Anchor Rollover should be\n\
    \      considered a subset of Trust Anchor Maintenance.\n   Normal or Pre-Scheduled\
    \ Trust Anchor Rollover:  The operator of a\n      DNSSEC signed zone has issued\
    \ a new DNSKEY and/or DS RR(s) as a\n      part of an operational routine.\n \
    \  Emergency or Non-Scheduled Trust Anchor Rollover:  The operator of a\n    \
    \  signed zone has issued a new DNSKEY and/or DS RR(s) as part of an\n      exceptional\
    \ event.\n   Emergency Trust Anchor Revocation:  The operator of a signed zone\n\
    \      wishes to indicate that the current DNSKEY and/or DS RR(s) are no\n   \
    \   longer valid as part of an exceptional event.\n"
- title: 5.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Requirements\n   Following are the requirements for DNSSEC automated specification-\n\
    \   based Trust Anchor Rollover:\n"
- title: 5.1.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Scalability\n   The automated Trust Anchor Rollover solution MUST be capable\
    \ of\n   scaling to Internet-wide usage.  The probable largest number of\n   instances\
    \ of security-aware resolvers needing to rollover a Trust\n   Anchor will be those\
    \ that use the public key(s) for the Root Zone as\n   Trust Anchor(s).  This number\
    \ could be extremely large if a number of\n   applications have embedded security-aware\
    \ resolvers.\n   The automated Trust Anchor Rollover solution MUST be able to\
    \ support\n   Trust Anchors for multiple zones and multiple Trust Anchors for\
    \ each\n   DNS zone.  The number of Trust Anchors that might be configured into\n\
    \   any one validating security-aware resolver is not known with\n   certainty\
    \ at this time; in most cases it will be less than 20 but it\n   may even be as\
    \ high as one thousand.\n"
- title: 5.2.  No Known Intellectual Property Encumbrance
  contents:
  - "5.2.  No Known Intellectual Property Encumbrance\n   Because trust anchor rollover\
    \ is likely to be \"mandatory-to-\n   implement\", section 8 of [5] requires that\
    \ the technical solution\n   chosen must not be known to be encumbered or must\
    \ be available under\n   royalty-free terms.\n   For this purpose, \"royalty-free\"\
    \ is defined as follows: worldwide,\n   irrevocable, perpetual right to use, without\
    \ fee, in commerce or\n   otherwise, where \"use\" includes descriptions of algorithms,\n\
    \   distribution and/or use of hardware implementations, distribution\n   and/or\
    \ use of software systems in source and/or binary form, in all\n   DNS or DNSSEC\
    \ applications including registry, registrar, domain name\n   service including\
    \ authority, recursion, caching, forwarding, stub\n   resolver, or similar.\n\
    \   In summary, no implementor, distributor, or operator of the\n   technology\
    \ chosen for trust anchor management shall be expected or\n   required to pay\
    \ any fee to any IPR holder for the right to implement,\n   distribute, or operate\
    \ a system which includes the chosen mandatory-\n   to-implement solution.\n"
- title: 5.3.  General Applicability
  contents:
  - "5.3.  General Applicability\n   The solution MUST provide the capability to maintain\
    \ Trust Anchors in\n   security-aware resolvers for any and all DNS zones.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Support Private Networks
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Support Private Networks\n   The solution MUST support private networks\
    \ with their own DNS\n   hierarchy.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Detection of Stale Trust Anchors
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Detection of Stale Trust Anchors\n   The Trust Anchor Rollover solution\
    \ MUST allow a validating security-\n   aware resolver to be able to detect if\
    \ the DNSKEY and/or DS RR(s) can\n   no longer be updated given the current set\
    \ of actual trust-anchors.\n   In these cases, the resolver should inform the\
    \ operator of the need\n   to reestablish initial trust.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Manual Operations Permitted
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Manual Operations Permitted\n   The operator of a security-aware resolver\
    \ may choose manual or\n   automated rollover, but the rollover protocol must\
    \ allow the\n   implementation to support both automated and manual Trust Anchor\n\
    \   Maintenance operations.  Implementation of the rollover protocol is\n   likely\
    \ to be mandatory, but that's out of scope for this requirements\n   document.\n"
- title: 5.7.  Planned and Unplanned Rollovers
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Planned and Unplanned Rollovers\n   The solution MUST permit both planned\
    \ (pre-scheduled) and unplanned\n   (non-scheduled) rollover of Trust Anchors.\
    \  Support for providing an\n   Initial Trust Relationship is OPTIONAL.\n"
- title: 5.8.  Timeliness
  contents:
  - "5.8.  Timeliness\n   Resource Records used as Trust Anchors SHOULD be able to\
    \ be\n   distributed to security-aware resolvers in a timely manner.\n   Security-aware\
    \ resolvers need to acquire new and remove revoked\n   DNSKEY and/or DS RRs that\
    \ are being used as Trust Anchors for a zone\n   such that no old RR is used as\
    \ a Trust Anchor for long after the zone\n   issues new or revokes existing RRs.\n"
- title: 5.9.  High Availability
  contents:
  - "5.9.  High Availability\n   Information about the zone administrator's view of\
    \ the state of\n   Resource Records used as Trust Anchors SHOULD be available\
    \ in a\n   trustworthy manner at all times to security-aware resolvers.\n   Information\
    \ about Resource Records that a zone administrator has\n   invalidated and that\
    \ are known to be used as Trust Anchors should be\n   available in a trustworthy\
    \ manner for a reasonable length of time.\n"
- title: 5.10.  New RR Types
  contents:
  - "5.10.  New RR Types\n   If a Trust Anchor Rollover solution requires new RR types\
    \ or protocol\n   modifications, this should be considered in the evaluation of\n\
    \   solutions.  The working group needs to determine whether such changes\n  \
    \ are a good thing or a bad thing or something else.\n"
- title: 5.11.  Support for Trust Anchor Maintenance Operations
  contents:
  - "5.11.  Support for Trust Anchor Maintenance Operations\n   The Trust Anchor Rollover\
    \ solution MUST support operations that allow\n   a validating security-aware\
    \ resolver to add a new Trust Anchor,\n   delete an existing Trust Anchor, or\
    \ replace an existing Trust Anchor\n   with another.\n"
- title: 5.12.  Recovery from Compromise
  contents:
  - "5.12.  Recovery from Compromise\n   The Trust Anchor Rollover solution MUST allow\
    \ a security-aware\n   resolver to be able to recover from the compromise of any\
    \ of its\n   configured Trust Anchors for a zone so long as at least one other\n\
    \   key, which is known to have not been compromised, is configured as a\n   Trust\
    \ Anchor for that same zone at that resolver.\n"
- title: 5.13.  Non-Degrading Trust
  contents:
  - "5.13.  Non-Degrading Trust\n   The Trust Anchor Rollover solution MUST provide\
