  - "Abstract\n   Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping\n\
    \   forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable\n   service,\
    \ MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of\n   the traffic carried\
    \ on different paths.  This requires that the label\n   switching routers (LSRs)\
    \ support fault detection, fault notification,\n   and fault recovery mechanisms,\
    \ and that MPLS signaling support the\n   configuration of recovery.  With these\

- title: 1.1. Background
  contents:
  - "1.1. Background\n   Network routing deployed today is focused primarily on connectivity,\n\
    \   and typically supports only one class of service, the best effort\n   class.\
    \  Multi-protocol label switching [RFC3031], on the other hand,\n   by integrating\
    \ forwarding based on label-swapping of a link local\n   label with network layer\
    \ routing allows flexibility in the delivery\n   of new routing services.  MPLS\
    \ allows for using such media-specific\n   forwarding mechanisms as label swapping.\
    \  This enables some\n   sophisticated features such as quality-of-service (QoS)\
    \ and traffic\n   engineering [RFC2702] to be implemented more effectively.  An\n\
    \   important component of providing QoS, however, is the ability to\n   transport\
    \ data reliably and efficiently.  Although the current\n   routing algorithms\
    \ are robust and survivable, the amount of time they\n   take to recover from\
    \ a fault can be significant, in the order of\n   several seconds (for interior\
    \ gateway protocols (IGPs)) or minutes\n   (for exterior gateway protocols, such\
    \ as the Border Gateway Protocol\n   (BGP)), causing disruption of service for\
    \ some applications in the\n   interim.  This is unacceptable in situations where\
    \ the aim is to\n   provide a highly reliable service, with recovery times that\
    \ are in\n   the order of seconds down to 10's of milliseconds.  IP routing may\n\
    \   also not be able to provide bandwidth recovery, where the objective\n   is\
    \ to provide not only an alternative path, but also bandwidth\n   equivalent to\
    \ that available on the original path.  (For some recent\n   work on bandwidth\
    \ recovery schemes, the reader is referred to [MPLS-\n   BACKUP].)  Examples of\
    \ such applications are Virtual Leased Line\n   services, Stock Exchange data\
    \ services, voice traffic, video services\n   etc, i.e., every application that\
    \ gets a disruption in service long\n   enough to not fulfill service agreements\
    \ or the required level of\n   quality.\n   MPLS recovery may be motivated by\
    \ the notion that there are\n   limitations to improving the recovery times of\
    \ current routing\n   algorithms.  Additional improvement can be obtained by augmenting\n\
    \   these algorithms with MPLS recovery mechanisms [MPLS-PATH].  Since\n   MPLS\
    \ is a possible technology of choice in future IP-based transport\n   networks,\
    \ it is useful that MPLS be able to provide protection and\n   restoration of\
    \ traffic.  MPLS may facilitate the convergence of\n   network functionality on\
    \ a common control and management plane.\n   Further, a protection priority could\
    \ be used as a differentiating\n   mechanism for premium services that require\
    \ high reliability, such as\n   Virtual Leased Line services, and high priority\
    \ voice and video\n   traffic.  The remainder of this document provides a framework\
    \ for\n   MPLS based recovery.  It is focused at a conceptual level and is\n \
    \  meant to address motivation, objectives and requirements.  Issues of\n   mechanism,\
    \ policy, routing plans and characteristics of traffic\n   carried by recovery\
    \ paths are beyond the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.2. Motivation for MPLS-Based Recovery
  contents:
  - "1.2. Motivation for MPLS-Based Recovery\n   MPLS based protection of traffic\
    \ (called MPLS-based Recovery) is\n   useful for a number of reasons.  The most\
    \ important is its ability to\n   increase network reliability by enabling a faster\
    \ response to faults\n   than is possible with traditional Layer 3 (or IP layer)\
    \ approaches\n   alone while still providing the visibility of the network afforded\
    \ by\n   Layer 3.  Furthermore, a protection mechanism using MPLS could enable\n\
    \   IP traffic to be put directly over WDM optical channels and provide a\n  \
    \ recovery option without an intervening SONET layer or optical\n   protection.\
    \  This would facilitate the construction of IP-over-WDM\n   networks that request\
    \ a fast recovery ability (Note that what is\n   meant here is the transport of\
    \ IP traffic over WDM links, not the\n   Generalized MPLS, or GMPLS, control of\
    \ a WDM link).\n   The need for MPLS-based recovery arises because of the following:\n\
    \   I.   Layer 3 or IP rerouting may be too slow for a core MPLS network\n   \
    \     that needs to support recovery times that are smaller than the\n       \
    \ convergence times of IP routing protocols.\n   II.  Layer 3 or IP rerouting\
    \ does not provide the ability to provide\n        bandwidth protection to specific\
    \ flows (e.g., voice over IP,\n        virtual leased line services).\n   III.\
    \ Layer 0 (for example, optical layer) or Layer 1 (for example,\n        SONET)\
    \ mechanisms may be wasteful use of resources.\n   IV.  The granularity at which\
    \ the lower layers may be able to protect\n        traffic may be too coarse for\
    \ traffic that is switched using\n        MPLS-based mechanisms.\n   V.   Layer\
    \ 0 or Layer 1 mechanisms may have no visibility into higher\n        layer operations.\
    \  Thus, while they may provide, for example,\n        link protection, they cannot\
    \ easily provide node protection or\n        protection of traffic transported\
    \ at layer 3.  Further, this may\n        prevent the lower layers from providing\
    \ restoration based on the\n        traffic's needs.  For example, fast restoration\
    \ for traffic that\n        needs it, and slower restoration (with possibly more\
    \ optimal use\n        of resources) for traffic that does not require fast\n\
    \        restoration.  In networks where the latter class of traffic is\n    \
    \    dominant, providing fast restoration to all classes of traffic\n        may\
    \ not be cost effective from a service provider's perspective.\n   VI.  MPLS has\
    \ desirable attributes when applied to the purpose of\n        recovery for connectionless\
    \ networks.  Specifically that an LSP\n        is source routed and a forwarding\
    \ path for recovery can be\n        \"pinned\" and is not affected by transient\
    \ instability in SPF\n        routing brought on by failure scenarios.\n   VII.\
    \ Establishing interoperability of protection mechanisms between\n        routers/LSRs\
    \ from different vendors in IP or MPLS networks is\n        desired to enable\
    \ recovery mechanisms to work in a multivendor\n        environment, and to enable\
    \ the transition of certain protected\n        services to an MPLS core.\n"
- title: 1.3. Objectives/Goals
  contents:
  - "1.3. Objectives/Goals\n   The following are some important goals for MPLS-based\
    \ recovery.\n   I.    MPLS-based recovery mechanisms may be subject to the traffic\n\
    \         engineering goal of optimal use of resources.\n   II.   MPLS based recovery\
    \ mechanisms should aim to facilitate\n         restoration times that are sufficiently\
    \ fast for the end user\n         application.  That is, that better match the\
    \ end-user's\n         application requirements.  In some cases, this may be as\
    \ short\n         as 10s of milliseconds.\n   We observe that I and II may be\
    \ conflicting objectives, and a trade\n   off may exist between them.  The optimal\
    \ choice depends on the end-\n   user application's sensitivity to restoration\
    \ time and the cost\n   impact of introducing restoration in the network, as well\
    \ as the\n   end-user application's sensitivity to cost.\n   III.  MPLS-based\
    \ recovery should aim to maximize network reliability\n         and availability.\
    \  MPLS-based recovery of traffic should aim to\n         minimize the number\
    \ of single points of failure in the MPLS\n         protected domain.\n   IV.\
    \   MPLS-based recovery should aim to enhance the reliability of\n         the\
    \ protected traffic while minimally or predictably degrading\n         the traffic\
    \ carried by the diverted resources.\n   V.    MPLS-based recovery techniques\
    \ should aim to be applicable for\n         protection of traffic at various granularities.\
    \  For example,\n         it should be possible to specify MPLS-based recovery\
    \ for a\n         portion of the traffic on an individual path, for all traffic\n\
    \         on an individual path, or for all traffic on a group of paths.\n   \
    \      Note that a path is used as a general term and includes the\n         notion\
    \ of a link, IP route or LSP.\n   VI.   MPLS-based recovery techniques may be\
    \ applicable for an entire\n         end-to-end path or for segments of an end-to-end\
    \ path.\n   VII.  MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to take into\n   \
    \      consideration the recovery actions of lower layers.  MPLS-based\n     \
    \    mechanisms should not trigger lower layer protection switching\n        \
    \ nor should MPLS-based mechanisms be triggered when lower layer\n         switching\
    \ has or may imminently occur.\n   VIII. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should\
    \ aim to minimize the loss\n         of data and packet reordering during recovery\
    \ operations.  (The\n         current MPLS specification itself has no explicit\
    \ requirement\n         on reordering.)\n   IX.   MPLS-based recovery mechanisms\
    \ should aim to minimize the state\n         overhead incurred for each recovery\
    \ path maintained.\n   X.    MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to minimize\
    \ the\n         signaling overhead to setup and maintain recovery paths and to\n\
    \         notify failures.\n   XI.   MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim\
    \ to preserve the\n         constraints on traffic after switchover, if desired.\
    \  That is,\n         if desired, the recovery path should meet the resource\n\
    \         requirements of, and achieve the same performance\n         characteristics\
    \ as, the working path.\n   We observe that some of the above are conflicting\
    \ goals, and real\n   deployment will often involve engineering compromises based\
    \ on a\n   variety of factors such as cost, end-user application requirements,\n\
    \   network efficiency, complexity involved, and revenue considerations.\n   Thus,\
    \ these goals are subject to tradeoffs based on the above\n   considerations.\n"
- title: 2.   Overview
  contents:
  - "2.   Overview\n   There are several options for providing protection of traffic.\
    \  The\n   most generic requirement is the specification of whether recovery\n\
    \   should be via Layer 3 (or IP) rerouting or via MPLS protection\n   switching\
    \ or rerouting actions.\n   Generally network operators aim to provide the fastest,\
    \ most stable,\n   and the best protection mechanism that can be provided at a\n\
    \   reasonable cost.  The higher the levels of protection, the more the\n   resources\
    \ consumed.  Therefore it is expected that network operators\n   will offer a\
    \ spectrum of service levels.  MPLS-based recovery should\n   give the flexibility\
    \ to select the recovery mechanism, choose the\n   granularity at which traffic\
    \ is protected, and to also choose the\n   specific types of traffic that are\
    \ protected in order to give\n   operators more control over that tradeoff.  With\
    \ MPLS-based recovery,\n   it can be possible to provide different levels of protection\
    \ for\n   different classes of service, based on their service requirements.\n\
    \   For example, using approaches outlined below, a Virtual Leased Line\n   (VLL)\
    \ service or real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) may\n   be supported\
    \ using link/node protection together with pre-\n   established, pre-reserved\
    \ path protection.  Best effort traffic, on\n   the other hand, may use path protection\
    \ that is established on demand\n   or may simply rely on IP re-route or higher\
    \ layer recovery\n   mechanisms.  As another example of their range of application,\
    \ MPLS-\n   based recovery strategies may be used to protect traffic not\n   originally\
    \ flowing on label switched paths, such as IP traffic that\n   is normally routed\
    \ hop-by-hop, as well as traffic forwarded on label\n   switched paths.\n"
- title: 2.1.   Recovery Models
  contents:
  - "2.1.   Recovery Models\n   There are two basic models for path recovery: rerouting\
    \ and\n   protection switching.\n   Protection switching and rerouting, as defined\
    \ below, may be used\n   together.  For example, protection switching to a recovery\
    \ path may\n   be used for rapid restoration of connectivity while rerouting\n\
    \   determines a new optimal network configuration, rearranging paths, as\n  \
    \ needed, at a later time.\n"
- title: 2.1.1  Rerouting
  contents:
  - "2.1.1  Rerouting\n   Recovery by rerouting is defined as establishing new paths\
    \ or path\n   segments on demand for restoring traffic after the occurrence of\
    \ a\n   fault.  The new paths may be based upon fault information, network\n \
    \  routing policies, pre-defined configurations and network topology\n   information.\
    \  Thus, upon detecting a fault, paths or path segments to\n   bypass the fault\
    \ are established using signaling.\n   Once the network routing algorithms have\
    \ converged after a fault, it\n   may be preferable, in some cases, to reoptimize\
    \ the network by\n   performing a reroute based on the current state of the network\
    \ and\n   network policies.  This is discussed further in Section 3.8.\n   In\
    \ terms of the principles defined in section 3, reroute recovery\n   employs paths\
    \ established-on-demand with resources reserved-on-\n   demand.\n"
- title: 2.1.2  Protection Switching
  contents:
  - "2.1.2  Protection Switching\n   Protection switching recovery mechanisms pre-establish\
    \ a recovery\n   path or path segment, based upon network routing policies, the\n\
    \   restoration requirements of the traffic on the working path, and\n   administrative\
    \ considerations.  The recovery path may or may not be\n   link and node disjoint\
    \ with the working path.  However if the\n   recovery path shares sources of failure\
    \ with the working path, the\n   overall reliability of the construct is degraded.\
    \  When a fault is\n   detected, the protected traffic is switched over to the\
    \ recovery\n   path(s) and restored.\n   In terms of the principles in section\
    \ 3, protection switching employs\n   pre-established recovery paths, and, if\
    \ resource reservation is\n   required on the recovery path, pre-reserved resources.\
    \  The various\n   sub-types of protection switching are detailed in Section 4.4\
    \ of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.2.   The Recovery Cycles
  contents:
  - "2.2.   The Recovery Cycles\n   There are three defined recovery cycles: the MPLS\
    \ Recovery Cycle, the\n   MPLS Reversion Cycle and the Dynamic Re-routing Cycle.\
    \  The first\n   cycle detects a fault and restores traffic onto MPLS-based recovery\n\
    \   paths.  If the recovery path is non-optimal the cycle may be followed\n  \
    \ by any of the two latter cycles to achieve an optimized network\n   again. \
    \ The reversion cycle applies for explicitly routed traffic\n   that does not\
    \ rely on any dynamic routing protocols to converge.  The\n   dynamic re-routing\
    \ cycle applies for traffic that is forwarded based\n   on hop-by-hop routing.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.     MPLS-based Recovery Principles\n   MPLS-based recovery refers to the ability\
    \ to effect quick and\n   complete restoration of traffic affected by a fault\
    \ in an MPLS-\n   enabled network.  The fault may be detected on the IP layer\
    \ or in\n   lower layers over which IP traffic is transported.  Fastest MPLS\n\
    \   recovery is assumed to be achieved with protection switching and may\n   be\
    \ viewed as the MPLS LSR switch completion time that is comparable\n   to, or\
    \ equivalent to, the 50 ms switch-over completion time of the\n   SONET layer.\
    \  Further, MPLS-based recovery may provide bandwidth\n   protection for paths\
    \ that require it.  This section provides a\n   discussion of the concepts and\
    \ principles of MPLS-based recovery.\n   The concepts are presented in terms of\
    \ atomic or primitive terms that\n   may be combined to specify recovery approaches.\
    \  We do not make any\n   assumptions about the underlying layer 1 or layer 2\
    \ transport\n   mechanisms or their recovery mechanisms.\n"
- title: 3.1.   Configuration of Recovery
  contents:
  - "3.1.   Configuration of Recovery\n   An LSR may support any or all of the following\
    \ recovery options on a\n   per-path basis:\n   Default-recovery (No MPLS-based\
    \ recovery enabled): Traffic on the\n   working path is recovered only via Layer\
    \ 3 or IP rerouting or by some\n   lower layer mechanism such as SONET APS.  This\
    \ is equivalent to\n   having no MPLS-based recovery.  This option may be used\
    \ for low\n   priority traffic or for traffic that is recovered in another way\
    \ (for\n   example load shared traffic on parallel working paths may be\n   automatically\
    \ recovered upon a fault along one of the working paths\n   by distributing it\
    \ among the remaining working paths).\n   Recoverable (MPLS-based recovery enabled):\
    \ This working path is\n   recovered using one or more recovery paths, either\
    \ via rerouting or\n   via protection switching.\n"
- title: 3.2.   Initiation of Path Setup
  contents:
  - "3.2.   Initiation of Path Setup\n   There are three options for the initiation\
    \ of the recovery path\n   setup.  The active and recovery paths may be established\
    \ by using\n   either RSVP-TE [RFC2205][RFC3209] or CR-LDP [RFC3212], or by any\n\
    \   other means including SNMP.\n   Pre-established:\n      This is the same as\
    \ the protection switching option.  Here a\n      recovery path(s) is established\
    \ prior to any failure on the\n      working path.  The path selection can either\
    \ be determined by an\n      administrative centralized tool, or chosen based\
    \ on some algorithm\n      implemented at the PSL and possibly intermediate nodes.\
    \  To guard\n      against the situation when the pre-established recovery path\
    \ fails\n      before or at the same time as the working path, the recovery path\n\
    \      should have secondary configuration options as explained in\n      Section\
    \ 3.3 below.\n   Pre-Qualified:\n      A pre-established path need not be created,\
    \ it may be pre-\n      qualified. A pre-qualified recovery path is not created\
    \ expressly\n      for protecting the working path, but instead is a path created\
    \ for\n      other purposes that is designated as a recovery path after\n    \
    \  determining that it is an acceptable alternative for carrying the\n      working\
    \ path traffic. Variants include the case where an optical\n      path or trail\
    \ is configured, but no switches are set.\n   Established-on-Demand:\n      This\
    \ is the same as the rerouting option.  Here, a recovery path\n      is established\
    \ after a failure on its working path has been\n      detected and notified to\

- title: 3.3. Initiation of Resource Allocation

  - "3.3. Initiation of Resource Allocation\n   A recovery path may support the same\

    \ these two situations by\n   using different additive terms.  If the recovery\
    \ path is capable of\n   replacing the working path without degrading service,\
    \ it will be\n   called an equivalent recovery path.  If the recovery path lacks\
    \ the\n   resources (or resource reservations) to replace the working path\n \

    \   Pre-reserved:\n      This option applies only to protection switching.  Here\
    \ a pre-\n      established recovery path reserves required resources on all hops\n\
    \      along its route during its establishment.  Although the reserved\n    \
    \  resources (e.g., bandwidth and/or buffers) at each node cannot be\n      used\
    \ to admit more working paths, they are available to be used by\n      all traffic\
    \ that is present at the node before a failure occurs.\n      The resources held\
    \ by a set of recovery paths may be shared if\n      they protect resources that\
    \ are not simultaneously subject to\n      failure.\n   Reserved-on-Demand:\n\
    \      This option may apply either to rerouting or to protection\n      switching.\
    \ Here a recovery path reserves the required resources\n      after a failure\
    \ on the working path has been detected and notified\n      to the PSL and before\
    \ the traffic on the working path is switched\n      over to the recovery path.\n\
    \      Note that under both the options above, depending on the amount of\n  \
    \    resources reserved on the recovery path, it could either be an\n      equivalent\
    \ recovery path or a limited recovery path.\n"

    \ switch occurs. This\n   leads to two subtypes of protection switching.\n   In\
    \ 1+1 (\"one plus one\") protection, the resources (bandwidth,\n   buffers, processing\
    \ capacity) on the recovery path are fully\n   reserved, and carry the same traffic\
    \ as the working path.  Selection\n   between the traffic on the working and recovery\

    \ the working path has a fault.  Once the\n   protection switch is initiated,\
    \ the low priority traffic being\n   carried on the recovery path may be displaced\
    \ by the protected\n   traffic.  This method affords a way to make efficient use\

    \ the\n   node immediately upstream of the fault is the one to initiate\n   recovery\
    \ (either rerouting or protection switching).  Local repair\n   can be of two\
    \ types:\n   Link Recovery/Restoration\n      In this case, the recovery path\
    \ may be configured to route around\n      a certain link deemed to be unreliable.\
    \  If protection switching\n      is used, several recovery paths may be configured\
    \ for one working\n      path, depending on the specific faulty link that each\
    \ protects\n      against.\n      Alternatively, if rerouting is used, upon the\
    \ occurrence of a\n      fault on the specified link, each path is rebuilt such\
    \ that it\n      detours around the faulty link.\n      In this case, the recovery\
    \ path need only be disjoint from its\n      working path at a particular link\
    \ on the working path, and may\n      have overlapping segments with the working\
    \ path.  Traffic on the\n      working path is switched over to an alternate path\
    \ at the upstream\n      LSR that connects to the failed link.  Link recovery\
    \ is\n      potentially the fastest to perform the switchover, and can be\n  \
    \    effective in situations where certain path components are much\n      more\
    \ unreliable than others.\n   Node Recovery/Restoration\n      In this case, the\
    \ recovery path may be configured to route around\n      a neighbor node deemed\
    \ to be unreliable.  Thus the recovery path\n      is disjoint from the working\
    \ path only at a particular node and at\n      links associated with the working\
    \ path at that node.  Once again,\n      the traffic on the primary path is switched\
    \ over to the recovery\n      path at the upstream LSR that directly connects\

  contents:
  - "3.5. Fault Detection\n   MPLS recovery is initiated after the detection of either\
    \ a lower\n   layer fault or a fault at the IP layer or in the operation of MPLS-\n\
    \   based mechanisms.  We consider four classes of impairments: Path\n   Failure,\
    \ Path Degraded, Link Failure, and Link Degraded.\n   Path Failure (PF) is a fault\
    \ that indicates to an MPLS-based recovery\n   scheme that the connectivity of\
    \ the path is lost.  This may be\n   detected by a path continuity test between\
    \ the PSL and PML.  Some,\n   and perhaps the most common, path failures may be\
    \ detected using a\n   link probing mechanism between neighbor LSRs.  An example\
    \ of a\n   probing mechanism is a liveness message that is exchanged\n   periodically\
    \ along the working path between peer LSRs [MPLS-PATH].\n   For either a link\
    \ probing mechanism or path continuity test to be\n   effective, the test message\
    \ must be guaranteed to follow the same\n   route as the working or recovery path,\
    \ over the segment being tested.\n   In addition, the path continuity test must\
    \ take the path merge points\n   into consideration.  In the case of a bi-directional\
    \ link implemented\n   as two unidirectional links, path failure could mean that\
    \ either one\n   or both unidirectional links are damaged.\n   Path Degraded (PD)\
    \ is a fault that indicates to MPLS-based recovery\n   schemes/mechanisms that\
    \ the path has connectivity, but that the\n   quality of the connection is unacceptable.\
    \  This may be detected by a\n   path performance monitoring mechanism, or some\
    \ other mechanism for\n   determining the error rate on the path or some portion\
    \ of the path.\n   This is local to the LSR and consists of excessive discarding\
    \ of\n   packets at an interface, either due to label mismatch or due to TTL\n\
    \   errors, for example.\n   Link Failure (LF) is an indication from a lower layer\
    \ that the link\n   over which the path is carried has failed.  If the lower layer\n\
    \   supports detection and reporting of this fault (that is, any fault\n   that\
    \ indicates link failure e.g., SONET LOS (Loss of Signal)), this\n   may be used\
    \ by the MPLS recovery mechanism.  In some cases, using LF\n   indications may\
    \ provide faster fault detection than using only MPLS-\n   based fault detection\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Link Degraded (LD) is an indication from a lower layer that\
    \ the link\n   over which the path is carried is performing below an acceptable\n\
    \   level.  If the lower layer supports detection and reporting of this\n   fault,\
    \ it may be used by the MPLS recovery mechanism.  In some cases,\n   using LD\

- title: 3.6.   Fault Notification

    \ the fault\n   must determine if the fault is severe enough to require path\n\
    \   recovery.  If the node is not capable of initiating direct action\n   (e.g.,\
    \ as a point of repair, POR) the node should send out a\n   notification of the\
    \ fault by transmitting a FIS to the POR.  This can\n   take several forms:\n\
    \   (i)  control plane messaging: relayed hop-by-hop along the path\n        upstream\
    \ of the failed LSP until a POR is reached.\n   (ii) user plane messaging: sent\
    \ downstream to the PML, which may take\n        corrective action (as a POR for\
    \ 1+1) or communicate with a POR\n        upstream (for 1:n) by any of several\
    \ means:\n      -  control plane messaging\n      -  user plane return path (either\
    \ through a bi-directional LSP or\n         via other means)\n   Since the FIS\
    \ is a control message, it should be transmitted with\n   high priority to ensure\
    \ that it propagates rapidly towards the\n   affected POR(s).  Depending on how\
    \ fault notification is configured\n   in the LSRs of an MPLS domain, the FIS\
    \ could be sent either as a\n   Layer 2 or Layer 3 packet [MPLS-PATH].  The use\
    \ of a Layer 2-based\n   notification requires a Layer 2 path direct to the POR.\
    \  An example\n   of a FIS could be the liveness message sent by a downstream\
    \ LSR to\n   its upstream neighbor, with an optional fault notification field\
    \ set\n   or it can be implicitly denoted by a teardown message.\n   Alternatively,\

  - "3.8.1.2 Non-revertive Mode\n   In the non-revertive mode of operation, there\
    \ is no preferred path or\n   it may be desirable to minimize further disruption\
    \ of the service\n   brought on by a revertive switching operation.  A switch-back\
    \ to the\n   original working path is not desired or not possible since the\n\
    \   original path may no longer exist after the occurrence of a fault on\n   that\
    \ path. If there is a fault on the working path, traffic is\n   switched to the\
    \ recovery path.  When or if the faulty path (the\n   originally working path)\
    \ is restored, it may become the recovery path\n   (either by configuration, or,\
    \ if desired, by management actions).\n   In the non-revertive mode of operation,\
    \ the working traffic may or\n   may not be restored to a new optimal working\
    \ path or to the original\n   working path anyway.  This is because it might be\
    \ useful, in some\n   cases, to either: (a) administratively perform a protection\
    \ switch\n   back to the original working path after gaining further assurances\n\
    \   about the integrity of the path, or (b) it may be acceptable to\n   continue\
    \ operation on the recovery path, or (c) it may be desirable\n   to move the traffic\
    \ to a new optimal working path that is calculated\n   based on network topology\
    \ and network policies.  Once a new working\n   path has been defined, an associated\
    \ recovery path may be setup.\n"

  - "3.8.2     Dynamic Protection Counterparts\n   For dynamic protection counterparts\
    \ when the traffic is switched over\n   to a recovery path, the association between\
    \ the original working path\n   and the recovery path may no longer exist, since\
    \ the original path\n   itself may no longer exist after the fault.  Instead,\

    \   recovery path may be switched over to a different preferred path\n   either\
    \ optimization based on the new network topology and associated\n   information\
    \ or based on pre-configured information.\n   Dynamic protection counterparts\
    \ assume that upon failure, the PSL or\n   other network entity will establish\
    \ new working paths if another\n   switch-over will be performed.\n"
- title: 3.8.3     Restoration and Notification
  contents:
  - "3.8.3     Restoration and Notification\n   MPLS restoration deals with returning\
    \ the working traffic from the\n   recovery path to the original or a new working\
    \ path.  Restoration is\n   performed by the PSL either upon receiving notification,\
    \ via FRS,\n   that the working path is repaired, or upon receiving notification\n\
    \   that a new working path is established.\n   For fixed counterparts in revertive\
    \ mode, an LSR that detected the\n   fault on the working path also detects the\
    \ restoration of the working\n   path.  If the working path had experienced a\
    \ LF defect, the LSR\n   detects a return to normal operation via the receipt\
    \ of a liveness\n   message from its peer.  If the working path had experienced\
    \ a LD\n   defect at an LSR interface, the LSR could detect a return to normal\n\
    \   operation via the resumption of error-free packet reception on that\n   interface.\
    \  Alternatively, a lower layer that no longer detects a LF\n   defect may inform\
    \ the MPLS-based recovery mechanisms at the LSR that\n   the link to its peer\
    \ LSR is operational. The LSR then transmits FRS\n   to its upstream LSR(s) that\
    \ were transmitting traffic on the working\n   path.  At the point the PSL receives\
    \ the FRS, it switches the working\n   traffic back to the original working path.\n\
    \   A similar scheme is used for dynamic counterparts where e.g., an\n   update\
    \ of topology and/or network convergence may trigger\n   installation or setup\
    \ of new working paths and may send notification\n   to the PSL to perform a switch\
    \ over.\n   We note that if there is a way to transmit fault information back\n\
    \   along a recovery path towards a PSL and if the recovery path is an\n   equivalent\
    \ working path, it is possible for the working path and its\n   recovery path\
    \ to exchange roles once the original working path is\n   repaired following a\
    \ fault.  This is because, in that case, the\n   recovery path effectively becomes\
    \ the working path, and the restored\n   working path functions as a recovery\
    \ path for the original recovery\n   path.  This is important, since it affords\
    \ the benefits of non-\n   revertive switch operation outlined in Section 4.8.1,\
    \ without leaving\n   the recovery path unprotected.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.8.4     Reverting to Preferred Path (or Controlled Rearrangement)\n   In the\
    \ revertive mode, \"make before break\" restoration switching can\n   be used,\

    \ of network impairments.  This will\n   minimize both packet loss and packet\

    \ be\n   specified in terms of the following attributes:\n   I.   Resource Class\
    \ Attribute:\n        Equivalent Recovery Class: The recovery path has the same\n\

    \  The recovery path has a priority attribute just like the working\n        path\

- title: 4.  MPLS Recovery Features
  contents:
  - "4.  MPLS Recovery Features\n   The following features are desirable from an operational\
    \ point of\n   view:\n   I.   It is desirable that MPLS recovery provides an option\
    \ to\n        identify protection groups (PPGs) and protection portions\n    \
    \    (PTPs).\n   II.  Each PSL should be capable of performing MPLS recovery upon\
    \ the\n        detection of the impairments or upon receipt of notifications of\n\
    \        impairments.\n   III. A MPLS recovery method should not preclude manual\
    \ protection\n        switching commands.  This implies that it would be possible\n\
    \        under administrative commands to transfer traffic from a working\n  \
    \      path to a recovery path, or to transfer traffic from a recovery\n     \
    \   path to a working path, once the working path becomes\n        operational\
    \ following a fault.\n   IV.  A PSL may be capable of performing either a switch\
    \ back to the\n        original working path after the fault is corrected or a\n\
    \        switchover to a new working path, upon the discovery or\n        establishment\
    \ of a more optimal working path.\n   V.   The recovery model should take into\
    \ consideration path merging\n        at intermediate LSRs.  If a fault affects\
    \ the merged segment,\n        all the paths sharing that merged segment should\
    \ be able to\n        recover. Similarly, if a fault affects a non-merged segment,\n\
    \        only the path that is affected by the fault should be recovered.\n"
- title: 5.  Comparison Criteria
  contents:
  - "5.  Comparison Criteria\n   Possible criteria to use for comparison of MPLS-based\
    \ recovery\n   schemes are as follows:\n   Recovery Time\n      We define recovery\
    \ time as the time required for a recovery path\n      to be activated (and traffic\
    \ flowing) after a fault.  Recovery\n      Time is the sum of the Fault Detection\
    \ Time, Hold-off Time,\n      Notification Time, Recovery Operation Time, and\
    \ the Traffic\n      Restoration Time.  In other words, it is the time between\
    \ a\n      failure of a node or link in the network and the time before a\n  \
    \    recovery path is installed and the traffic starts flowing on it.\n   Full\
    \ Restoration Time\n      We define full restoration time as the time required\
    \ for a\n      permanent restoration.  This is the time required for traffic to\n\
    \      be routed onto links, which are capable of or have been engineered\n  \
    \    sufficiently to handle traffic in recovery scenarios.  Note that\n      this\
    \ time may or may not be different from the \"Recovery Time\"\n      depending\
    \ on whether equivalent or limited recovery paths are\n      used.\n   Setup vulnerability\n\
    \      The amount of time that a working path or a set of working paths\n    \
    \  is left unprotected during such tasks as recovery path computation\n      and\
    \ recovery path setup may be used to compare schemes.  The\n      nature of this\
    \ vulnerability should be taken into account, e.g.,\n      End to End schemes\
    \ correlate the vulnerability with working paths,\n      Local Repair schemes\
    \ have a topological correlation that cuts\n      across working paths and Network\
    \ Plan approaches have a\n      correlation that impacts the entire network.\n\
    \   Backup Capacity\n      Recovery schemes may require differing amounts of \"\
    backup\n      capacity\" in the event of a fault.  This capacity will be\n   \
    \   dependent on the traffic characteristics of the network.  However,\n     \
    \ it may also be dependent on the particular protection plan\n      selection\
    \ algorithms as well as the signaling and re-routing\n      methods.\n   Additive\
    \ Latency\n      Recovery schemes may introduce additive latency for traffic.\
    \  For\n      example, a recovery path may take many more hops than the working\n\
    \      path.  This may be dependent on the recovery path selection\n      algorithms.\n\
    \   Quality of Protection\n      Recovery schemes can be considered to encompass\
    \ a spectrum of\n      \"packet survivability\" which may range from \"relative\"\
    \ to\n      \"absolute\". Relative survivability may mean that the packet is on\n\
    \      an equal footing with other traffic of, as an example, the same\n     \
    \ diff-serv code point (DSCP) in contending for the resources of the\n      portion\
    \ of the network that survives the failure.  Absolute\n      survivability may\
    \ mean that the survivability of the protected\n      traffic has explicit guarantees.\n\
    \   Re-ordering\n      Recovery schemes may introduce re-ordering of packets.\
    \  Also the\n      action of putting traffic back on preferred paths might cause\n\
    \      packet re-ordering.\n   State Overhead\n      As the number of recovery\
    \ paths in a protection plan grows, the\n      state required to maintain them\
    \ also grows.  Schemes may require\n      differing numbers of paths to maintain\
    \ certain levels of coverage,\n      etc.  The state required may also depend\
    \ on the particular scheme\n      used for recovery.  The state overhead may be\
    \ a function of\n      several parameters.  For example,  the number of recovery\
    \ paths\n      and the number of the protected facilities (links, nodes, or\n\
    \      shared link risk groups (SRLGs)).\n   Loss\n      Recovery schemes may\
    \ introduce a certain amount of packet loss\n      during switchover to a recovery\
    \ path.  Schemes that introduce loss\n      during recovery can measure this loss\
    \ by evaluating recovery times\n      in proportion to the link speed.\n     \
    \ In case of link or node failure a certain packet loss is\n      inevitable.\n\
    \   Coverage\n      Recovery schemes may offer various types of failover coverage.\n\
    \      The total coverage may be defined in terms of several metrics:\n   I. \
    \  Fault Types: Recovery schemes may account for only link faults\n        or\
    \ both node and link faults or also degraded service.  For\n        example, a\
    \ scheme may require more recovery paths to take node\n        faults into account.\n\
    \   II.  Number of concurrent faults: dependent on the layout of recovery\n  \
    \      paths in the protection plan, multiple fault scenarios may be\n       \
    \ able to be restored.\n   III. Number of recovery paths: for a given fault, there\
    \ may be one or\n        more recovery paths.\n   IV.  Percentage of coverage:\
    \ dependent on a scheme and its\n        implementation, a certain percentage\
    \ of faults may be covered.\n        This may be subdivided into percentage of\
    \ link faults and\n        percentage of node faults.\n   V.   The number of protected\
    \ paths may effect how fast the total set\n        of paths affected by a fault\
    \ could be recovered.  The ratio of\n        protection is n/N, where n is the\
    \ number of protected paths and\n        N is the total number of paths.\n"
