- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The need for route aggregation has long been recognized.\
    \  Route\n   aggregation is good as it reduces the size, and slows the growth,\
    \ of\n   the Internet routing table.  Thus, the amount of resources (e.g., CPU\n\
    \   and memory) required to process routing information is reduced and\n   route\
    \ calculation is sped up.  Another benefit of route aggregation\n   is that route\
    \ flaps are limited in number, frequency and scope, which\n   saves resources\
    \ and makes the global Internet routing system more\n   stable.\n   Since CIDR\
    \ (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) [2] was introduced,\n   significant progress\
    \ has been made on route aggregation, particularly\n   in the following two areas:\n\
    \      - Formulation and implementation of IP address allocation policies\n  \
    \      by the top registries that conform to the CIDR principles [1].\n      \
    \  This policy work is the cornerstone which makes efficient route\n        aggregation\
    \ technically possible.\n      - Route aggregation by large (especially \"Tier\
    \ 1\") providers.  To\n        date, the largest reductions in the size of the\
    \ routing table\n        have resulted from efficient aggregation by large providers.\n\
    \   However, the ability of various levels of the global routing system\n   to\
    \ implement efficient aggregation schemes varies widely.  As a\n   result, the\
    \ size and growth rate of the Internet routing table, as\n   well as the associated\
    \ route computation required, remain major\n   issues today.  To support Internet\
    \ growth, it is important to\n   maximize the efficiency of aggregation at all\
    \ levels in the routing\n   system.\n   Because of the current size of the routing\
    \ system and its dynamic\n   nature, the first step towards this goal is to establish\
    \ a clearly\n   defined framework in which scaleable inter-domain route aggregation\n\
    \   can be realized.  The framework described in this document is based\n   on\
    \ the predominant and current experience in the Internet. It\n   emphasizes the\
    \ philosophy of aggregation by the source, both within\n   routing domains as\
    \ well as towards upstream providers.  The framework\n   also strongly encourages\
    \ the use of the \"no-export\" BGP community to\n   balance the providersubscriber\
    \ need for more granular routing\n   information with the Internet's need for\
    \ scalable inter-domain\n   routing.  The advantages of this framework include\
    \ the following:\n      - Route aggregation is done in a distributed fashion,\
    \ with\n        emphasis on aggregation by the party or parties injecting the\n\
    \        aggregatable routing information into the global mesh.\n      - The flexibility\
    \ of a routing domain to be able to inject more\n        granular routing information\
    \ to an adjacent domain to control\n        the resulting traffic patterns, without\
    \ having an impact on the\n        global routing system.\n        In addition\
    \ to describing the philosophy, we illustrate it by\n        presenting sample\
    \ configurations.  IPv4 prefixes, BGP4 and ASs\n        are used in examples,\
    \ though the principles are applicable to\n        inter-domain route aggregation\
    \ in general.\n        Address allocation policies and technologies to renumber\
    \ entire\n        networks, while very relevant to the realization of successful\n\
    \        and sustained inter-domain routing, are not the focus of this\n     \
    \   document.  The references section contains pointers to relevant\n        documents\
    \ [8, 9, 11, 12].\n"
- title: 2. Route Aggregation Framework
  contents:
  - "2. Route Aggregation Framework\n   The framework of inter-domain route aggregation\
    \ we are proposing can\n   be summarized as follows:\n      - Aggregation from\
    \ the originating AS\n        That is, in its outbound route announcements, each\
    \ AS aggregates\n        the BGP routes originated by itself, by dedicated AS\
    \ and by\n        private-ASs [10].  (\"Routes originated by an AS\" refers to\n\
    \        routes which have that AS first in the AS path attribute.  For\n    \
    \    example, routes statically configured and injected into BGP fall\n      \
    \  into this category.)\n        This framework does not depend on \"proxy aggregation\"\
    \ which\n        refers to route aggregation done by an AS other than the\n  \
    \      originating AS.  This preserves the capability of a multi-homed\n     \
    \   site to control the granularity of routing information injected\n        into\
    \ the global routing system. Since proxy aggregation involves\n        coordination\
    \ among multiple organizations, the complexity of\n        doing proxy aggregation\
    \ increases with the number of parties\n        involved in the coordination.\
    \ The complexity, in turn, impacts\n        the practicality of proxy aggregation.\n\
    \        An AS shall always originate via a stable mechanism (e.g.,\n        static\
    \ route configuration) the BGP routes for the large\n        aggregates from which\
    \ it allocates addresses to customers.  This\n        ensures that it is safe\
    \ for its customers to use BGP \"no-\n        export\".\n      - Using BGP community\
    \ \"no-export\" toward upstream providers\n        That is, in its route announcements\
    \ toward its upstream\n        provider, an AS tags the BGP community \"no-export\"\
    \ to routes it\n        originates that do not need to be propagated beyond its\
    \ upstream\n        provider (e.g., prefixes allocated by the upstream provider).\n\
    \   This framework is illustrated in Figure 1. A \"Tier 1\" provider does\n  \
    \ not use \"no-export\" in its announcement as it does not have an\n   upstream\
    \ provider.  However, it shall aggregate the routes it\n   originates in its outbound\
    \ announcements towards both peer providers\n   and customers.  An AS with an\
    \ upstream provider shall aggregate the\n   routes it originates and use \"no-export\"\
    \ toward its upstream provider\n   for routes that do not need to be propagated\
    \ beyond its provider's\n   AS.   This recursion shall apply to all levels of\
    \ the routing\n   hierarchy.\n                         Tier 1\n              \

    \ is detailed in the following sections.\n"
- title: 3. Aggregation from the Originating AS
  contents:
  - "3. Aggregation from the Originating AS\n   It has been well recognized that address\
    \ allocation and address\n   renumbering are keys to containing the growth of\
    \ the Internet routing\n   table [1, 2, 8, 9, 11, 12].\n   Although the strategies\
    \ discussed in this document do not assume a\n   perfect address allocation, it\
    \ is strongly urged that an AS receive\n   allocation from its upstream service\
    \ providers' address block.\n"
- title: 3.1 Intra-Domain Aggregation
  contents:
  - "3.1 Intra-Domain Aggregation\n   To reduce the number of routes that need to\
    \ be injected into an AS,\n   there are a couple of principles that shall be followed:\n\
    \      - Carry in its BGP table the large route block allocated from its\n   \
    \     upstream provider or an address registry (e.g., InterNIC, RIPE,\n      \
    \  APNIC).  This can be done by either static configuration of the\n        large\
    \ block or by aggregating more specific BGP routes.  The\n        former is recommended\
    \ as it does not depend on other routes.\n      - Allocate sub-blocks to the access\
    \ routers where further\n        allocation is done.  That is, the address allocation\
    \ shall be\n        done such that only a few, less specific routes (instead of\
    \ many\n        more, specific ones) need to be known to the other routers\n \
    \       within the AS.\n        For example, a prefix of /17 can be further allocated\
    \ to\n        different access routers as /20s which can then be allocated to\n\
    \        customers connected to different interfaces on that router (as\n    \
    \    shown in Figure 2).  Then in general only the /20 needs to be\n        injected\
    \ into the whole AS. Exceptions need to be made for\n        multi-homed static\
    \ routes.\n                         access router\n                        +------------+\n\

    \   It is noted that rehoming of customers without renumbering even\n   within\
    \ the same AS may lead to injection of more specific routes.\n   However, in general\
    \ the more-specifics do not need to be advertised\n   outside of that AS. Such\
    \ routes can either be tagged with the BGP\n   community \"no-export\" or filtered\
    \ out by a prefix-based filter to\n   prevent them from being advertised out.\n"
- title: 3.2 Inter-Domain Aggregation
  contents:
  - "3.2 Inter-Domain Aggregation\n   There are at least two types of routes that\
    \ need to be advertised by\n   an AS: routes originated by the AS and routes originated\
    \ by its BGP\n   customers.  An AS may need to advertise full routes to certain\
    \ BGP\n   customers, in which case the routing announcements include routes\n\
    \   originated by non-customer ASs.  Clearly an AS can, and should,\n   safely\
    \ aggregate the routes originated by itself and by its BGP\n   customers multi-homed\
    \ only to it (using, e.g., the dedicated-AS and\n   by the private-AS mechanism\
    \ [10]) in its outbound announcement.  But\n   it is far more dangerous to aggregate\
    \ routes originated by customer\n   ASs due to multi-homing.\n   However, there\
    \ are several cases in which a route originated by a BGP\n   customer (other than\
    \ using the dedicated AS or private AS) does not\n   need to be advertised out\
    \ by its upstream providers.  For example,\n      - The route is a more-specific\
    \ of the upstream provider's block.\n        However, the customer is either singly\
    \ homed; or its connection\n        to this particular upstream provider is used\
    \ for backup only.\n      - The more-specifics of a larger block are announced\
    \ by the\n        customer in order to balance traffic over the multiple links\
    \ to\n        the upstream provider.\n   Our approach to suppress such routes\
    \ is to give control to the ASs\n   that originate the more-specifics (as seen\
    \ by its upstream providers)\n   and let them tag the BGP community \"no-export\"\
    \ to the appropriate\n   routes.\n   The BGP community \"no-export\" is a well\
    \ known BGP community [6, 7].\n   A route with this attribute is not propagated\
    \ beyond an AS boundary.\n   So, if a route is tagged with this community in its\
    \ announcement to\n   an upstream provider and is accepted by the upstream provider,\
    \ the\n   route will not be announced beyond the upstream provider's AS. This\n\
    \   achieves the goal of suppressing the more-specifics in the upstream\n   provider's\
    \ outbound announcement.\n   In this framework, the BGP community \"no-export\"\
    \ shall be tagged to\n   routes that are to be advertized to, but not propagated\
    \ by, its\n   upstream provider.  They may include routes allocated out of its\n\
    \   upstream provider's block or the more specific routes announced to\n   its\
    \ upstream provider for the purpose of load balancing. This\n   aggregation strategy\
    \ can be implemented via prefix-based filtering as\n   shown in the example of\
    \ Section 5.\n   For its own protection, a downstream AS shall announce only its\
    \ own\n   routes and its customer routes to its upstream providers.  Thus, the\n\
    \   outbound routing announcement and aggregation policy can be expressed\n  \
    \ as follows:\n      For routes originated by itself/dedicated-AS/private-AS:\n\
    \         tag with \"no-export\" when appropriate, and advertise the\n       \
    \  large block and suppress the more-specifics\n      For routes originated by\
    \ customer ASs:\n         advertise to upstream ASs\n      For any other routes:\n\
    \         do not advertise to upstream ASs\n   This approach is flexible and scales\
    \ well as it gives control to the\n   party with the special needs, distributes\
    \ the workload and avoids the\n   coordination overhead required by proxy aggregation.\n"
- title: 4. Aggregation by a Provider
  contents:
  - "4. Aggregation by a Provider\n   A provider shall aggregate all the routes it\
    \ originates, as\n   documented in Section 3.  The only difference is that the\
    \ provider\n   may be providing full routes to certain BGP customers where no\n\
    \   outbound filtering is presently in place.  Experience has shown that\n   inconsistent\
    \ route announcement (e.g., aggregate at the interconnects\n   but not toward\
    \ certain customers) can cause serious routing problems\n   for the Internet as\
    \ a whole because of longest-match routing.  In\n   certain cases announcing the\
    \ more-specifics to customers might\n   provide for more accurate IGP metrics\
    \ and could be useful for better\n   load-balancing.  However, the potential risk\
    \ seems to outweigh the\n   benefit, especially given the increasing complexity\
    \ of connectivity\n   that a customer may have.  As a result, every effort shall\
    \ be made to\n   ensure consistent route aggregation for all BGP peers.  This\
    \ means\n   deploying filters for the BGP peers which receive full routes.\n \
    \  In summary, the aggregation strategy for a provider shall be:\n   -    In announcing\
    \ customer routes:\n        For routes originated by itself/dedicated-AS/private-AS:\n\
    \           tag with \"no-export\" when appropriate, and advertise the\n     \
    \      large block and suppress the more-specifics\n        For routes originated\
    \ by other customer ASs:\n           advertise\n        For any other routes:\n\
    \           do not advertise\n   -    In announcing full routes:\n        For\
    \ routes originated by itself/dedicated-AS/private-AS:\n           tag with \"\
    no-export\" when appropriate, and advertise the\n           large block and suppress\

  - "A. Appendix A:  Example Cisco Configuration\n   This appendix lists the Cisco\
    \ configurations for AS 2000 of the\n   examples presented in Section 5.  The\
    \ configuration here uses the\n   AS-path for outbound filtering although it can\
    \ also be based on BGP\n   community.  Several route-maps are defined that can\
    \ be used for\n   peering with the upstream provider, and for peering with customers\n\
    \   (announcing full routes or customer routes).\n"
