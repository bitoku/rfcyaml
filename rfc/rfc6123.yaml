- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is produced for historic reference.\n   When\
    \ new protocols or protocol extensions are developed, it is often\n   the case\
    \ that not enough consideration is given to the manageability\n   of the protocols\
    \ or to the way in which they will be operated in the\n   network.  The result\
    \ is that manageability considerations are only\n   understood once the protocols\
    \ have been implemented and sometimes not\n   until after they have been deployed.\n\
    \   The resultant attempts to retrofit manageability mechanisms are not\n   always\
    \ easy or architecturally pleasant.  Furthermore, it is possible\n   that certain\
    \ protocol designs make manageability particularly hard to\n   achieve.\n   Recognizing\
    \ that manageability is fundamental to the utility and\n   success of protocols\
    \ designed within the IETF, and that simply\n   defining a MIB module does not\
    \ necessarily provide adequate\n   manageability, this document was developed\
    \ to define recommendations\n   for the inclusion of Manageability Considerations\
    \ sections in all\n   Internet-Drafts produced within the PCE Working Group. \
    \ It was the\n   intention that meeting these recommendations would ensure that\
    \ proper\n   consideration was given to the support of manageability at all stages\n\
    \   of the protocol development process from Requirements and\n   Architecture\
    \ through Specification and Applicability.\n   It is clear that the presence of\
    \ such a section in an Internet-Draft\n   does not guarantee that the protocol\
    \ will be well-designed or\n   manageable.  However, the inclusion of this section\
    \ will ensure that\n   the authors have the opportunity to consider the issues,\
    \ and, by\n   reading the material in this document, they will gain some guidance.\n\
    \   This document was developed within the PCE Working Group and was used\n  \
    \ to help guide the authors and editors within the working group to\n   produce\
    \ Manageability Considerations sections in the Internet-Drafts\n   and RFCs produced\
    \ by the working group.\n   [RFC5706] presents general guidance from the IETF's\
    \ Operations Area\n   for considering Operations and Management of new protocols\
    \ and\n   protocol extensions.  It has been adopted by the PCE Working Group to\n\
    \   provide guidance to editors and authors within the working group, so\n   this\
    \ document is no longer required.  However, the working group\n   considers that\
    \ it will be useful to archive this document as Historic\n   for future reference.\n"

- title: 1.2.  What Is Manageability?
  contents:
  - "1.2.  What Is Manageability?\n   In this context, \"manageability\" is used to\
    \ refer to the interactions\n   between a network operator (a human or an application)\
    \ and the\n   network components (hosts, routers, switches, applications, and\n\
    \   protocols) performed to ensure the correct operation of the network.\n   Manageability\
    \ issues are often referred to under the collective\n   acronym, FCAPS [X.700],\
    \ which stands for the following:\n   - Fault management\n   - Configuration\n\
    \   - Accounting\n   - Performance\n   - Security\n   Conventionally, Security\
    \ is already covered an Internet-Draft in its\n   own Security Considerations\
    \ section, and this document does not in\n   any way diminish the need for that\
    \ section.  Indeed, as pointed out\n   in Section 6, a full consideration of other\
    \ aspects of manageability\n   may increase the text that should be supplied in\
    \ the Security\n   Considerations section.\n   The author of a Manageability Considerations\
    \ section should certainly\n   consider all aspects of FCAPS.  The author should\
    \ reflect on how the\n   manageability of a new protocol impacts the manageability\
    \ and\n   operation of the entire network.  Specific optional subsections (see\n\
    \   Section 2.3) should be added as necessary to describe features of\n   FCAPS\
    \ that are pertinent but are not covered by the recommended\n   subsections. \
    \ More discussion of what manageability is and what may\n   be included in a Manageability\
    \ Considerations section can be found in\n   [RFC5706].\n   As part of documenting\
    \ the manageability considerations for a new\n   protocol or for protocol extensions,\
    \ authors should consider that one\n   of the objectives of specifying protocols\
    \ within the IETF is to\n   ensure interoperability of implementations.  This\
    \ interoperability\n   extends to the manageability function so that it is an\
    \ ideal that\n   there should be implementation independence between management\n\
    \   applications and managed entities.  This may be promoted by the use\n   of\
    \ standardized management protocols and by the specification of\n   standard information\
    \ models.\n   Note that, in some contexts, reference is made to the term\n   \"\
    management plane\".  This is used to describe the exchange of\n   management messages\
    \ through management protocols (often transported\n   by IP and by IP transport\
    \ protocols) between management applications\n   and the managed entities such\
    \ as network nodes.  The management plane\n   may use distinct addressing schemes,\
    \ virtual links or tunnels, or a\n   physically separate management control network.\
    \  The management plane\n   should be seen as separate from, but possibly overlapping\
    \ with, the\n   control plane, in which signaling and routing messages are exchanged,\n\
    \   and the forwarding plane (sometimes called the data plane or user\n   plane),\
    \ in which user traffic is transported.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Control of Function through Configuration and Policy
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Control of Function through Configuration and Policy\n   This subsection\
    \ describes the functional elements that may be\n   controlled through configuration\
    \ and/or policy.\n   For example, many protocol specifications include timers\
    \ that are\n   used as part of the operation of the protocol.  These timers often\n\
    \   have default values suggested in the protocol specification and do\n   not\
    \ need to be configurable.  However, it is often the case that the\n   protocol\
    \ requires that the timers can be configured by the operator\n   to ensure specific\
    \ behavior by the implementation.\n   Even if all configurable items have been\
    \ described within the body of\n   the document, they SHOULD be identified in\
    \ this subsection, but a\n   reference to another section of the document is sufficient\
    \ if there\n   is a full description elsewhere.\n   Other protocol elements are\
    \ amenable to control through the\n   application of local or network-wide policy.\
    \  It is not the intention\n   that this subsection should give details of policy\
    \ implementation\n   since that is covered by more general policy framework specifications\n\
    \   such as [RFC3060] and [RFC3460].  Additionally, specific frameworks\n   for\
    \ policy as applicable within protocol or functional architectures\n   are also\
    \ normally covered in separate documents, for example,\n   [RFC5394].\n   However,\
    \ this section SHOULD identify which protocol elements are\n   potentially subject\
    \ to policy and should give guidance on the\n   application of policy for successful\
    \ operation of the protocol.\n   Where this material is already described within\
    \ the body of the\n   document, this subsection SHOULD still identify the issues\
    \ and\n   reference the other sections of the document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Information and Data Models\n   This subsection SHOULD describe the information\

    \ This\n   includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the MIB modules\n   developed\
    \ specifically for the protocol functions specified in the\n   document.\n   Where\
    \ new or extended MIB modules are recommended, it is helpful if\n   this section\
    \ can give an overview of the items to be modeled by the\n   MIB modules.  This\
    \ does not require an object-by-object description\n   of all of the information\
    \ that needs to be modeled, but it could\n   explain the high-level \"object groupings\"\
    \ (perhaps to the level of\n   suggesting the MIB tables) and certainly should\
    \ explain the major\n   manageable entities.  For example, a protocol specification\
    \ might\n   include separate roles for \"sender\" and \"receiver\" and might be\n\
    \   broken into a \"session\" and individual \"transactions\"; if so, this\n \
    \  section could list these functionalities as separate manageable\n   entities.\n\
    \   [RFC3444] may be useful in determining what information to include in\n  \
    \ this section.\n   The description in this section can be by reference where\
    \ other\n   documents already exist.\n   It should be noted that the significance\
    \ of MIB modules may be\n   decreasing, but there is still a requirement to consider\
    \ the managed\n   objects necessary for successful operation of the protocol or\n\
    \   protocol extensions.  This means that due consideration should be\n   given\
    \ not only to what objects need to be managed but also to what\n   management\
    \ model should be used.  There are now several options,\n   including the MIB/SNMP\
    \ (Simple Network Management Protocol) model and\n   the Network Configuration\
    \ Protocol (NETCONF) model, being developed\n   by the NETCONF Data Modeling Language\
    \ (NETMOD) Working Group [YANG].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring\n   Liveness detection and monitoring\
    \ apply both to the control plane and\n   the data plane.\n   Mechanisms for detecting\
    \ faults in the control plane or for\n   monitoring its liveness are usually built\
    \ into the control plane\n   protocols or inherited from underlying data plane\
    \ or forwarding plane\n   protocols.  These mechanisms do not typically require\
    \ additional\n   management capabilities but are essential features for the protocol\n\
    \   to be usable and manageable.  Therefore, this section SHOULD\n   highlight\
    \ the mechanisms in the new protocol or protocol extensions\n   that are required\
    \ in order to ensure liveness detection and\n   monitoring within the protocol.\n\
    \   Further, when a control plane fault is detected, there is often a\n   requirement\
    \ to coordinate recovery action through management\n   applications or at least\
    \ to record the fact in an event log.  This\n   section SHOULD identify the management\
    \ actions expected when the\n   protocol detects a control plane fault.\n   Where\
    \ the protocol is responsible for establishing data or user plane\n   connectivity,\
    \ liveness detection and monitoring usually need to be\n   achieved through other\
    \ mechanisms.  In some cases, these mechanisms\n   already exist within other\
    \ protocols responsible for maintaining\n   lower layer connectivity, but it will\
    \ often be the case that new\n   procedures are required so that failures in the\
    \ data path can be\n   detected and reported rapidly, allowing remedial action\
    \ to be taken.\n   This section SHOULD refer to other mechanisms that are assumed\
    \ to\n   provide monitoring of data plane liveness and SHOULD identify\n   requirements\
    \ for new mechanisms as appropriate.\n   This section SHOULD describe the need\

- title: 3.4.  Verifying Correct Operation
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Verifying Correct Operation\n   An important function that Operations and\

    \   information and data models that report the status of the protocol\n   and\
    \ the state installed on network devices.  However, it may also be\n   valuable\
    \ to provide techniques for testing the effect that the\n   protocol has had on\
    \ the network by sending data through the network\n   and observing its behavior.\n\
    \   Thus, this section SHOULD include details of how the correct\n   operation\
    \ of the protocols described by the Internet-Draft can be\n   tested, and, in\
    \ as far as the Internet-Draft impacts on the operation\n   of the network, this\
