  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines one new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)\
    \ Source\n   Description (SDES) [RFC3550] item and one new Extended Report (XR)\n\
    \   block carrying parameters that identify and describe a measurement\n   period\
    \ to which one or more other RTCP XR blocks may refer.\n   The SDES item provides\
    \ a field for an application-specific auxiliary\n   identifier.  This identifier\
    \ may be used to correlate data in XR\n   blocks within an RTP session with data\
    \ from a non-RTP session.\n   An RTCP Measurement Identity SDES packet may be\
    \ associated with a set\n   of RTCP XR metrics blocks that share the same application-specific\n\
    \   measurement identifier.\n   The XR block does not contain any measurement\
    \ results (metrics).\n   Instead, it provides information relevant to a measurement\
    \ reported\n   in one or more other block types, including:\n   o  the sequence\
    \ number of the first packet of the RTP session,\n   o  the extended sequence\
    \ numbers of the first packet of the current\n      measurement interval, and\
    \ the last packet included in the\n      measurement,\n   o  the duration of the\
    \ most recent measurement interval, and\n   o  the duration of the interval applicable\
    \ to cumulative measurements\n      (which may be the duration of the RTP session\
    \ to date).\n   The calculation method of the extended RTP sequence number is\n\
    \   provided in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].\n   The RTCP\
    \ XR block containing the measurement information is intended\n   to provide a\
    \ single copy of the information necessary to relate\n   measurement data in the\
    \ RTCP XR blocks to the stream and measurement\n   period to which they refer.\
    \  Commonly, multiple other small metric\n   blocks contain measurement data for\
    \ the same stream and period, and\n   overhead would be large if all of these\
    \ metric blocks carried\n   duplicated data for measurement identification.\n\
    \   The RTCP XR block may be associated with a set of RTCP XR metrics\n   blocks\
    \ that share the same information relevant to a reported\n   measurement.  There\
    \ may be several such sets in an RTCP packet, in\n   which each set shares the\
    \ same information relevant to a reported\n   measurement.  There may also be\
    \ RTCP XR blocks in the packet that are\n   not associated with a Measurement\
    \ Information block, for example,\n   blocks that were defined before the Measurement\
    \ Identity and\n   information mechanism were introduced by this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  RTCP and RTCP XRs\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].\
    \  [RFC3611]\n   defines an extensible structure for reporting by using an RTCP\
    \ XR.\n   [RFC3611] also defines the use of XR blocks.  This document defines\
    \ a\n   new Extended Report block.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390]\
    \ provides guidance on the\n   definition and specification of performance metrics.\
    \  The RTP\n   Monitoring Architectures [MONARCH] provides guidelines for reporting\n\
    \   block format using RTCP XR.  The SDES item and XR block described in\n   this\
    \ document are in accordance with [RFC6390] and [MONARCH].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Applicability\n   The RTCP SDES item and the RTCP XR block defined in this\
    \ document\n   provide information relevant to the measurements for members of\
    \ a\n   family of RTCP XR metrics blocks that are designed to use it.  To use\n\
    \   the mechanism defined here, the RTCP XR block containing measurement\n   information\
    \ is not required to be in the same RTCP packet as the SDES\n   item containing\
    \ measurement identity.\n"
