  - "Introduction\n   The goal of this specification is to allow compatible and\n
    \  interoperable implementations for transmitting IP datagrams and ARP\n   requests
    and replies.\n   The characteristics of the SMDS Service and the SMDS Interface\n
    \  Protocol (SIP) are presented in [3], [6], and in [7].  Briefly, the\n   SMDS
    Service is a connectionless, public, packet-switched data\n   service.  The operation
    and features of the SMDS Service are similar\n   to those found in high-speed
    data networks such as LANs:\n      o The SMDS Service provides a datagram packet
    transfer, where each\n        data unit is handled and switched separately without
    the prior\n        establishment of a network connection.\n      o The SMDS Service
    exhibits high throughput and low delay, and\n        provides the transparent
    transport and delivery of up to 9188\n        octets of user information in a
    single transmission.\n      o No explicit flow control mechanisms are provided;
    instead, the\n        rate of information transfer on the access paths is controlled\n
    \       both in the subscriber-to-network direction and in the network-\n        to-subscriber
    direction through the use of an access class\n        enforcement mechanism.\n
    \     o Both individually and group-addressed (multicast) packets can\n        be
    transferred.\n      o In addition to these LAN-like features, a set of addressing-\n
    \       related service features (source address validation, source and\n        destination
    address screening) are provided to enable a\n        subscriber or set of subscribers
    to create a logical private\n        network, or closed user group, over the SMDS
    Service.  The\n        access control provided by the closed user group mechanism
    is\n        supplied by the SMDS provider according to the specifications\n        stated
    in [3].\n      o SMDS addresses are 60 bits plus a 4 bit Address Type.  The\n
    \       Address Type subfield occupies the 4 most significant bits of\n        the
    destination and source address fields of the SIP Level 3\n        Protocol Data
    Unit (PDU).  It contains the value 1100 to\n        indicate an individual address
    and the value 1110 for a 60-bit\n        group address.\n   The SMDS Interface
    Protocol is based on the IEEE Standard 802.6,\n   Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB)
    Connectionless MAC protocol [8].\n   The SMDS service layer corresponds to the
    IEEE 802 MAC sublayer.  The\n   remainder of the Data Link Service is provided
    by the IEEE 802.2\n   Logical Link Control (LLC) service [9].  The resulting stack
    of\n   services is illustrated in Figure 1:\n                           +--------------------+\n

  title: Introduction
- contents:
  - "Logical IP Subnetwork Configuration\n   This section describes the scenario for
    an SMDS Service that is\n   configured with multiple logical IP subnetworks, LIS
    (described\n   below).  The scenario considers only directly connected IP end-\n
    \  stations or routers; issues raised by MAC level bridging are beyond\n   the
    scope of this paper.\n   In the LIS scenario, each separate administrative entity
    configures\n   its hosts within a closed logical IP subnetwork.  Each LIS operates\n
    \  and communicates independently of other LISs over the same network\n   providing
    SMDS.  Hosts connected to SMDS communicate directly to\n   other hosts within
    the same LIS.  Communication to hosts outside of\n   an individual LIS is provided
    via an IP router.  This router would\n   simply be a station attached to the SMDS
    Service that has been\n   configured to be a member of both logical IP subnetworks.
    \ This\n   configuration results in a number of disjoint LISs operating over the\n
    \  same network supporting the SMDS Service.  It is recognized that with\n   this
    configuration, hosts of differing IP networks would communicate\n   via an intermediate
    router even though a direct path over the SMDS\n   Service may be possible.\n
    \  It is envisioned that the service will evolve to provide a more\n   public
    interconnection, allowing machines directly connected to the\n   SMDS Service
    to communicate without an intermediate router.  However,\n   the issues raised
    by such a large public interconnection, such as\n   scalability of address resolution
    or propagation of routing updates,\n   are beyond the scope of this paper.  We
    anticipate that future RFCs\n    will address these issues.\n   The following
    is a list of the requirements for a LIS configuration:\n      o All members have
    the same IP network/subnet number.\n      o All stations within a LIS are accessed
    directly over SMDS.\n      o All stations outside of the LIS are accessed via
    a router.\n      o For each LIS a single SMDS group address has been configured\n
    \       that identifies all members of the LIS.  Any packet transmitted\n        with
    this address is delivered by SMDS Service to all members\n        of the LIS.\n
    \  The following list identifies a set of SMDS Service specific\n   parameters
    that MUST be implemented in each IP station which would\n   connect to the SMDS
    Service.  The parameter values will be determined\n   at SMDS subscription time
    and will be different for each LIS.  Thus\n   these parameters MUST be user configurable.\n
    \     o SMDS Hardware Address (smds$ha).  The SMDS Individual address\n        of
    the IP station as determined at subscription time.  Each\n        host MUST be
    configured to accept datagrams destined for this\n        address.\n      o SMDS
    LIS Group Address(smds$lis-ga).  The SMDS Group address\n        that has been
    configured at subscription time to identify the\n        SMDS Subscriber Network
    Interfaces (SNI) of all members of the\n        LIS connected to the SMDS Service.
    \ All members of the LIS MUST\n        be prepared to accept datagrams addressed
    to smds$lis-ga.\n      o SMDS Arp Request Address (smds$arp-req).  The SMDS address\n
    \       (individual or group) to which arp requests are to be sent.  In\n        the
    initial LIS configuration this value is set to smds$lis-ga.\n        It is conceivable
    that in other configurations this value would\n        be set to some address
    other than that of smds$lis-ga (see\n        section on Address Resolution).\n
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that routers providing LIS functionality over the\n   SMDS
    service also support the ability to interconnect differing LISs.\n   Routers that
    wish to provide interconnection of differing LISs MUST\n   be able to support
    multiple sets of these parameters (one set for\n   each connected LIS) and be
    able to associate each set of parameters\n   with a specific IP network/subnet
    number.  In addition, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that a router be able to provide this
    multiple LIS\n   support with a single physical SMDS interface that may have one
    or\n   more individual SMDS addresses.\n   The following list identifies LIS specific
    parameters that MUST be\n   configured in the network supporting the SMDS Service.
    \ For each LIS,\n   the IP network administrator MUST request the configuration
    of these\n   parameters at subscription time.  The administrator of each LIS MUST\n
    \  update these parameters as each new station is added to the LIS.\n      o SMDS
    LIS Group Address(smds$lis-ga).  An SMDS Group address MUST\n        be configured
    at subscription time to identify the SMDS\n        Subscriber Network Interfaces
    (SNI) of all members of the LIS\n        connected to the SMDS Service.\n      o
    SMDS Address Screening Tables (Source and Destination).  The use\n        of SMDS
    screening tables is not necessary for the operation of\n        IP over SMDS Service.
    \ If the SMDS screening tables are to be\n        used, both source and destination
    tables for each SNI MUST be\n        configured to allow, at minimum, both the
    direct communication\n        between all hosts in the same LIS and the use of
    the SMDS LIS\n        Group Address.\n"
