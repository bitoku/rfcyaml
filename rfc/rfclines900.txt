790, 776, 770, 762, 758, 755, 750, 739, 604, 503, 433, 349 ASSIGNED NUMBERS Introduction
This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.
The assignment of numbers is also handled by Joyce.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.

Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [31] or in the old "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" [32] prepared by the NIC.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official Protocols" [83].
In all cases the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
In the lists that follow, a bracketed entry, e.g., [31,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number cites the document and the "iii" cites the person.
Whenever possible, this "iii" is a NIC Ident.
The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the Internet Protocol (IP)
The IP uses a 32 bit address field and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 3 forms or classes.
The first type of address, or class A, has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
The highest order bit is set to 0.
This allows 128 class A networks.
The second type of address, class B, has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
The two highest order bits are set to 1 0.
This allows 16,384 class B networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The third type of address, class C, has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
The three highest order bits are set to 1 1 0.
This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
No addresses are allowed with the three highest order bits set to 1 1 1.
These addresses (sometimes called "class D") are reserved.
RFC 900 Network Numbers One commonly used notation for internet host addresses divides the 32 bit address into four 8 bit fields and specifies the value of each field as a decimal number with the fields separated by periods.
This is called the "dotted decimal" notation.
For example, the internet address of USC ISIF.ARPA in dotted decimal is 010.002.000.052, or 10.2.0.52.
The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned network numbers.
A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address.
There are four catagories of users of Internet Addresses: Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense), and Commercial.
To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among the categories, a one character code is placed to the left of the network number: R for Research, D for Defense, G for Government, and C for Commercial (see Appendix A for further details on this division of the network identification).
Network numbers are assigned for networks that are connected to the ARPA Internet and DDN Internet, and for independent networks that use the IP family protocols (these are usually commercial).
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceeding the number.
The administrators of independent networks must apply separately for permission to interconnect their network with either the ARPA Internet of the DDN Internet.
Independent networks need not be listed in the working tables of either the ARPA Internet or DDN Internet hosts or gateways.
For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes changed.
To ease the transition the old number will be listed for a transition period as well.
These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following the number and preceeding the name, and the network name will be suffixed " TEMP".

[JBP] Other Reserved Internet Addresses
RFC 900 Version Numbers ASSIGNED VERSION NUMBERS
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[31,71] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[31,71] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
RFC 900 Port Numbers ASSIGNED
PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP
[31,72] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [31,70].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.
Who is up or NETSTAT
Any Private Dial Out Service
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [85,84] specifies that groups of gateways may form autonomous systems.
The EGP provides a 16 bit field for identifying such systems.
The values of this field are registered here.
RFC 900 ARPANET Logical Addresses ASSIGNED ARPANET LOGICAL ADDRESSES
The ARPANET facility for "logical addressing" is described in RFC 878 [49].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reseved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by Joyce Reynolds.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
RFC 900 ARPANET Link Numbers ASSIGNED ARPANET LINK
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [7].
The low order 4 bits of the message id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
Many of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems use a Service Access Point field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).
These systems use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [41] and RFC 895 [57] respectively.
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) specified in RFC 826 [55] has several parameters.
The assigned values for these parameters are listed here.
REPLY Hardware Type (hrd) 1
Protocol Type (pro) Use the same codes as listed in the section called "Ethernet Numbers of Interest".
One of the Internet Class A Networks is the international system of Public Data Networks.
This section lists the mapping between the Internet Addresses and the Public Data Network Addresses (X.121).
213 00045 00   RAND TN
The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over the Public Data Network is specified in RFC 877 [47].
RFC 900 Telnet Options ASSIGNED
The Telnet Protocol has a number of options that may be negotiated.
These options are listed here.
The "Official Protocols" document [83] provides more detailed information.

RFC 900 Appendix A APPENDIX
The network numbers in class A, B, and C network addresses are allocated among Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense) and Commercial uses.
Class A (highest order bit 0)
12286 Reserved Addresses: (0, 16383)
1572862 Reserved Addresses: (0, 2097151)
All addresses in this class are reserved for future use.
Within the Research community, network identifiers will only be granted to applicants who show evidence that they are acquiring standard Bolt Beranek and Newman gateway software or have implemented or are acquiring a gateway meeting the Exterior Gateway Protocol requirements.
Acquisition of the Berkeley BSD
4.2 UNIX software might be considered evidence of the latter.
Rather, the identifiers could be moved from Research to Defense, Government or Commercial status.
Thus, network identifiers may change state among Research, Defense, Government and Commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to each use must remain within the limits indicated above.
To make possible this fluid assignment, the network identifier spaces are not allocated by simple partition, but rather by specific assignment.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
TCP, IP and Telnet Option Identifiers
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
Joyce Reynolds is the coordinator for all number assignments.
