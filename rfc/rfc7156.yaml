  - "Abstract\n   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by\
    \ the\n   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically\n\
    \   tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term\n   \"localized\
    \ routing\" refers to a method by which packets are routed\n   directly between\
    \ an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node\n   (CN) without involving\
    \ any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,\n   it may be desirable to control\
    \ the establishment of localized routing\n   sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring\n   that the session be authorized.  This document\
    \ specifies how to\n   accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] allows the Mobile Access\
    \ Gateway\n   (MAG) to optimize media delivery by locally routing packets from\
    \ a\n   Mobile Node (MN) to a Correspondent Node (CN) that is locally\n   attached\
    \ to an access link connected to the same Mobile Access\n   Gateway, avoiding\
    \ tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility\n   Anchor (LMA).  This is\
    \ referred to as \"local routing\" in RFC 5213\n   [RFC5213].  However, this mechanism\
    \ is not applicable to the typical\n   scenarios in which the MN and CN are connected\
    \ to different MAGs and\n   are registered to the same LMA or different LMAs.\
    \  [RFC6279] takes\n   those typical scenarios into account and defines the problem\n\
    \   statement for PMIPv6 localized routing.  Based on the scenarios A11,\n   A12,\
    \ and A21 described in [RFC6279], [RFC6705] specifies the PMIPv6\n   localized\
    \ routing protocol that is used to establish a localized\n   routing path between\
    \ two Mobile Access Gateways in a PMIPv6 domain.\n   This document describes Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting\n   (AAA) support using Diameter [RFC6733]  for\
    \ the authorization\n   procedure between the PMIPv6 mobility entities (MAG or\
    \ LMA) and a AAA\n   server within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for localized routing\
    \ in the\n   scenarios A11, A12, and A21 described in [RFC6279].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   This document addresses how to provide authorization\
    \ information to\n   the Mobile Node's MAG or LMA to enable localized routing\
    \ and resolve\n   the destination MN's MAG by means of interaction between the\
    \ LMA and\n   the AAA server.  Figure 1 shows the reference architecture for\n\
    \   Localized Routing Service Authorization.  This reference architecture\n  \
    \ assumes that\n   o  If the MN and CN belong to different LMAs, the MN and CN\
    \ should\n      share the same MAG (i.e., scenario A12 described in [RFC6279]),\n\
    \      e.g., MN1 and CN2 in Figure 1 are attached to MAG1 and belong to\n    \
    \  LMA1 and LMA2, respectively.  Note that LMA1 and LMA2 in Figure 1\n      are\
    \ in the same provider domain (as described in [RFC6279]).\n   o  If the MN and\
    \ CN are attached to different MAGs, the MN and CN\n      should belong to the\
    \ same LMA (i.e., scenario A21 described in\n      [RFC6279]); for example, MN1\
    \ and CN3 in Figure 1 are attached to\n      MAG1 and MAG3, respectively, but\
    \ belong to LMA1.\n   o  The MN and CN may belong to the same LMA and may be attached\
    \ to\n      the same MAG (i.e., scenario A11 described in [RFC6279]), e.g.,\n\
    \      MN1 and CN1 in Figure 1 are both attached to the MAG1 and belong\n    \
    \  to LMA1.\n   o  The MAG and LMA support Diameter client functionality.\n  \

  - "5.  Example Signaling Flows for Localized Routing Service Authorization\n   Localized\
    \ Routing Service Authorization can happen during the network\n   access authentication\
    \ procedure [RFC5779] before localized routing is\n   initialized.  In this case,\
    \ the preauthorized pairs of LMA / prefix\n   sets can be downloaded to Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6 entities during the\n   procedure from [RFC5779].  Localized routing\
    \ can be initiated once\n   the destination of a received packet matches one or\
    \ more of the\n   prefixes received during the procedure from [RFC5779].\n   Figure\
    \ 2 shows an example scenario in which MAG1 acts as a Diameter\n   client, processing\
    \ the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and requesting\n   authorization of localized\
    \ routing (i.e., MAG-Initiated LR\n   authorization).  In this example scenario,\
    \ MN1 and MN2 are attached\n   to the same MAG and anchored to the different LMAs\
    \ (i.e., scenario\n   A12 described in [RFC6279]).  In this case, MAG1 knows that\
    \ MN2\n   belongs to a different LMA (which can be determined by looking up the\n\
    \   binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the\n   addresses\
    \ of LMA1 and LMA2).  In order to set up a localized routing\n   path with MAG2,\
    \ MAG1 acts as Diameter client and sends an AA-Request\n   message to the AAA\
    \ server.  The message contains an instance of the\n   MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV)\
    \ AVP [RFC5447] with the\n   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit ([RFC5779], Section\
    \ 5.5) set, two\n   instances of the User-Name AVP [RFC6733] containing the identifiers\n\
    \   of MN1 and MN2.  In addition, the message may contain either:\n   - an instance\
    \ of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP [RFC5779] carrying the\n     MN1's IPv4 address;\n\
    \   - an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP [RFC5779] carrying\n    \
    \ the MN1's home network prefix (MN-HNP).\n   The AAA server authorizes the localized\
    \ routing service by checking\n   if MN1 and MN2 are allowed to use localized\
    \ routing.  If so, the AAA\n   server responds with a AAA message encapsulating\
    \ an instance of the\n   MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP [RFC5447] with the\n  \
    \ LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit ([RFC5779], Section 5.5) set\n   indicating\
    \ that direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to\n   the same MAG is\
    \ authorized.  MAG1 then knows that the localized\n   routing between MN1 and\
    \ MN2 is allowed.  Then, MAG1 sends the Request\n   messages respectively to LMA1\
    \ and LMA2.  The request message is the\n   Localized Routing Initialization (LRI)\
    \ message in Figure 2 and\n   belongs to the Initial phase of the localized routing.\

    \ (LRA\n   in Figure 2) in accordance with [RFC6705].\n   In case of LRA_WAIT_TIME\
    \ expiration [RFC6705], MAG1 should ask for\n   authorization of localized routing\

    \ up the\n   binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing\
    \ the\n   addresses of the LMA corresponding to MN1 and LMA corresponding to\n\

    \ instead of MAG1 that initiates the setup of the localized\n   routing path.\n\
    \   The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the AAA\n   server.\

    \ Routing Authorization in A21\n   Figure 4 shows another example scenario, in\
    \ which LMA1 acts as a\n   Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN2\
    \ to MN1 and\n   requesting the authorization of localized routing.  In this scenario,\n\
    \   MN1 and MN2 are attached to the same MAG and anchored to the same LMA\n  \
    \ (i.e., A11 described in [RFC6279]), the LMA knows that MN1 and MN2\n   belong\
    \ to the same LMA (which can be determined by looking up the\n   binding cache\
    \ entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the\n   addresses of LMA\
    \ corresponding to MN1 and LMA corresponding to MN2).\n   The Diameter client\
    \ in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the AAA\n   server.  The message contains\
    \ an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector\n   AVP [RFC5447] with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED\
    \ bit set and two\n   instances of the User-Name AVP [RFC6733] containing the\
    \ identifiers\n   MN1 and MN2.  The AAA server authorizes the localized routing\
    \ service\n   by checking if MN1 and MN2 are allowed to use localized routing.\
    \  If\n   so, the AAA server responds with an AA-Answer message encapsulating\n\
    \   an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP [RFC5447] with the\n   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED\
    \ bit ([RFC5779], Section 5.5) set\n   indicating that direct routing of IP packets\
    \ between MNs anchored to\n   the same MAG is authorized.  LMA1 then knows the\
    \ localized routing is\n   allowed and responds to MAG1 for localized routing\
    \ in accordance with\n   [RFC6705].\n   In the case of LRA_WAIT_TIME expiration\
    \ [RFC6705], LMA1 should ask\n   for authorization of localized routing again\
    \ according to the\n   procedure described above before the LRI is retransmitted\
    \ up to a\n   maximum of LRI_RETRIES.\n   +---+  +---+    +----+  +----+     +---+\n\

    \   The service authorization solicited by the MAG or the LMA relies upon\n  \
    \ the existing trust relationship between the MAG/LMA and the AAA\n   server.\n\
    \   An authorized MAG could, in principle, track the movement of any\n   participating\
    \ mobile nodes at the level of the MAG to which they are\n   anchored.  If such\
    \ a MAG were compromised, or under the control of a\n   bad actor, then such tracking\
    \ could represent a privacy breach for\n   the set of tracked mobile nodes.  In\
    \ such a case, the traffic pattern\n   from the compromised MAG might be notable,\
    \ so monitoring for, e.g.,\n   excessive queries from MAGs, might be worthwhile.\n"
