  - "Abstract\n   DHCPv6 relay agents cannot communicate with DHCPv6 clients directly.\n\
    \   However, in some cases, the relay agent possesses some information\n   that\
    \ would be useful to the DHCPv6 client.  This document describes a\n   mechanism\
    \ whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information\n   to the DHCPv6\
    \ server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to\n   the DHCP client.\n\
    \   This document updates RFC 3315 (DHCPv6) by making explicit the\n   implicit\
    \ requirement that relay agents not modify the content of\n   encapsulation payloads\
    \ as they are relayed back toward clients.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] allows DHCP relay agents\
    \ to\n   forward DHCPv6 messages between clients and servers that are not on\n\
    \   the same IPv6 link.  In some cases, the DHCP relay agent has\n   information\
    \ not available to the DHCP server that would be useful to\n   provide to a DHCP\
    \ client.  For example, the DHCP client may need to\n   learn the EAP Re-authentication\
    \ Protocol (ERP) local domain name\n   [RFC6440] for use in EAP re-authentication\
    \ [RFC5296], which is known\n   to the relay agent but not the server.\n   The\
    \ DHCPv6 protocol specification does not provide a mechanism\n   whereby the relay\
    \ agent can provide options to the client.  This\n   document extends DHCP with\
    \ a mechanism that allows DHCP relay agents\n   to propose options for the server\
    \ to send to DHCP clients.\n   This document is not intended to provide a general\
    \ mechanism for\n   storing client configuration information in the relay agent.\
    \  Rather,\n   it is intended to address specific use cases where only the relay\n\
    \   agent has information needed by the client.  This extension is not\n   applicable\
    \ to DHCP options in general, but rather provided as a\n   mechanism for new specifications\
    \ that require this functionality.\n"

    \   order for the DHCP relay agent to provide options to the client, it\n   sends\
    \ those options to the DHCP server, encapsulated in an RSOO.  The\n   DHCP server\
    \ can then choose to place those options in the response it\n   sends to the client.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  RSOO-Enabled Options\n   The RSOO MUST NOT contain any option that is not\
    \ specifically called\n   out as an RSOO-enabled option.  Specifications that\
    \ describe RSOO-\n   enabled options MUST reference this specification, and MUST\
    \ state\n   that the option they define is RSOO-enabled.  No DHCP option\n   specified\
    \ prior to the issuance of this specification is RSOO-\n   enabled.\n   A current\

- title: 5.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior\n   Relay agents MAY include an RSOO in the option\
    \ payload of a Relay-\n   Forward message being sent toward a DHCP server.  When\
    \ relaying the\n   payload of Relay-Reply messages toward clients, relay agents\
    \ MUST NOT\n   modify the payload.\n   Relay agents MUST NOT send non-RSOO-enabled\
    \ options in the Relay-\n   Supplied Options option.\n   In order to allow network\
    \ administrators to control the flow of RSOO\n   options onto the network, relay\
    \ agents that implement the Relay-\n   Supplied Options option need to have a\
    \ configuration parameter that\n   determines whether or not they will relay Relay-Forward\
    \ messages\n   containing RSOOs.\n   Relay agents that have this configuration\
    \ parameter and that are\n   configured to disable forwarding of a Relay-Forward\
    \ message\n   containing an RSOO MUST silently discard any such message.\n   Implementations\
    \ that can be configured in this way MUST examine all\n   Relay-Forward encapsulations,\
    \ not just the outer encapsulation.\n"
- title: 6.  DHCP Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "6.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   DHCP servers that implement this protocol specification\
    \ MUST examine\n   each option contained in an RSOO to see if it is an RSOO-enabled\n\
    \   option.  DHCP servers MUST silently discard any option contained in\n   an\
    \ RSOO that is not RSOO-enabled.  DHCP server implementations SHOULD\n   have\
    \ an administrator-configurable list of RSOO-enabled options, so\n   that new\
    \ RSOO-enabled options do not require software to be updated.\n   DHCP servers\
    \ normally construct a list of options that are candidates\n   to send to the\
    \ DHCP client, and then construct the DHCP packet\n   according to Section 17.2.2\
    \ of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].\n   If the server implementing this protocol\
    \ specification receives an\n   RSOO, it SHOULD add any options that appear in\
    \ the RSOO for which it\n   has no internal candidate to the list of options that\
    \ are candidates\n   to send to the DHCP client.  The server SHOULD discard any\
    \ options\n   that appear in the RSOO for which it already has one or more\n \
    \  candidates.\n   Aside from the addition of options from the RSOO, the DHCP\
    \ server\n   should then construct a DHCP packet as it normally would, and\n \
    \  transmit it to the DHCP client as described in [RFC3315].\n   DHCP servers\
    \ may receive multiply-nested Relay-Forward messages\n   containing conflicting\
    \ values for options contained in RSOOs in these\n   messages.\n   When such a\
    \ conflict exists, the DHCP server MUST choose no more than\n   one of these options\
    \ to forward to the client.  The DHCP server MUST\n   NOT forward more than one\
    \ of these options to the client.\n   By default, the DHCP server MUST choose\
    \ the innermost value -- the\n   value supplied by the relay agent closest to\
    \ the DHCP client -- to\n   forward to the DHCP client.\n   DHCP server implementations\
    \ MAY provide other heuristics for choosing\n   which one of a set of such conflicting\
    \ options to forward to the\n   client, as long as the specified behavior is the\
    \ default behavior.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides a mechanism whereby a\
    \ relay agent can inject\n   options into the response the DHCP server sends to\
    \ the DHCP client.\n   In currently known use cases -- for example, the ERP Local\
    \ Domain\n   Option [RFC6440] -- RSOO-enabled options are options that will only\n\
    \   ever originate on a relay agent, and do not make sense when\n   originating\
    \ on a DHCP server.\n   In the event that some new RSOO-enabled option is specified\
    \ that can\n   originate from either the server or the relay agent, this should\
    \ be\n   addressed in the Security Considerations section of the document that\n\
    \   specifies the use of that option.\n   In some environments, there is an interface\
    \ on one side of which is\n   the client, and zero or more routers, and on the\
    \ other side of which\n   is a network managed by a monolithic or effectively\
    \ monolithic\n   administrative entity.  Nodes and routers on the client side\
    \ of the\n   interface are not controlled by this entity, and are considered\n\
    \   \"untrusted\".  Nodes and routers on the network side of this interface\n\
    \   are considered trusted.\n   It is possible for a malicious node acting as\
    \ a relay agent on the\n   untrusted side of this interface to supply an RSOO\
    \ containing one or\n   more RSOO-enabled options that would override the same\
    \ option or\n   options that were provided by a relay agent on the trusted side\
    \ of\n   the interface.\n   In environments where this is a possibility, network\
    \ administrators\n   are advised to use relay agents that are capable of dropping\
    \ Relay-\n   Forward messages containing the RSOO, and are advised to configure\n\
    \   those relay agents to drop such messages.\n   Note, however, that this will\
    \ only be effective if the message from\n   the DHCP server to the DHCP client\
    \ is authenticated as specified in\n   Section 21 of [RFC3315], or using some\
    \ similar mechanism.  Without\n   this authentication, the malicious node on the\
    \ untrusted portion of\n   the network can simply modify the DHCP server's response\
    \ in transit\n   back to the DHCP client, and there is no way for the client to\
    \ detect\n   that this has happened.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned one new DHCPv6 option code from\
    \ the registry of\n   DHCP Option Codes maintained at http://www.iana.org/.  The\
    \ option\n   code 66 (OPTION_RSOO) has been assigned to the Relay-Supplied Options\n\
    \   option.\n   IANA has created a new registry on the same assignments page,\
    \ titled\n   \"Options Permitted in the Relay-Supplied Options Option\".  This\n\
    \   registry will enumerate the set of all code points from the DHCP\n   Option\
    \ Codes table for options that may appear in the RSOO.  Options\n   may be added\
    \ to this list after IETF Review [RFC5226].  When adding\n   options to the list,\
    \ please ensure that the description for the code\n   added matches the description\
    \ in the DHCP Option Codes table for that\n   code.  Option codes that have not\
    \ been requested to be added\n   according to the stated procedure should not\
    \ be mentioned at all in\n   the table, and should not be listed as \"reserved\"\
    \ or \"unassigned\".\n   IETF Review should include careful consideration of the\
    \ security\n   implications of allowing a relay agent to provide a value for the\n\
    \   option being considered for addition to this registry.  In the case\n   where\
    \ an IETF working group chartered to review DHCP protocol\n   extensions exists,\
    \ it is not sufficient for some other working group\n   to review the registry\
    \ addition.\n"
