  - "1. Introduction\n   Today it is not uncommon for many network administrations\
    \ to collect\n   and archive network management metrics that indicate network\n\
    \   utilization, growth, and outages.  The primary goal is to facilitate\n   near-term\
    \ problem isolation and longer-term network planning within\n   the organization.\
    \  There is also the larger goal of cooperative\n   problem isolation and network\
    \ planning between network\n   administrations.  This larger goal is likely to\
    \ become increasingly\n   important as the Internet continues to grow.\n   There\
    \ exist a variety of network management tools for the collection\n   and presentation\
    \ of network management metrics.  However, different\n   kinds of measurement\
    \ and presentation techniques makes it difficult\n   to compare data between networks.\
    \  Plus, there is not common\n   agreement on what metrics should be regularly\
    \ collected or how they\n   should be displayed.\n   There needs to be an agreed-upon\
    \ model for\n    1) A minimal set of common network management metrics to satisfy\
    \ the\n       goals stated above.\n    2) Tools for collecting these metrics.\n\
    \    3) A common storage format to facilitate the usage of these data by\n   \
    \    common presentation tools.\n    4) Common presentation formats.\n   Under\
    \ this Operational Statistics model, collection tools will\n   collect and store\
    \ data in a given format to be retrieved later by\n   presentation tools displaying\
    \ the data in a predefined way.  (See\n   figure below.)\n                   \
    \  The Operational Statistics Model\n   (Collection of common metrics, by commonly\
    \ available tools, stored in\n   a common format, displayed in common formats\
    \ by commonly available\n   presentation tools.)\n                      !-----------------------!\n\

    \ !-------------------!\n   This memo gives an overview of this model for common\
    \ operational\n   statistics. The model defines the gathering, storing and presentation\n\
    \   of network operational statistics and classifies the types of\n   information\
    \ that should be available at each network operation center\n   conforming to\
    \ this model.\n   The model defines a minimal set of metrics, how these metrics\
    \ should\n   gathered and stored. Finally the model gives recommendations on the\n\
    \   content and the layout of statistical reports making it possible to\n   easily\
    \ compare networks statistics between NOCs.\n   The primary purpose of this model\
    \ is to define ways and methods on\n   how NOCs could most effectively share their\
    \ operational statistics.\n   One intention with this model is to specify a baseline\
    \ capability\n   that NOCs conforming to the this model may support with a minimal\n\
    \   development effort and a minimal ongoing effort.\n"
- title: 2. The Model
  contents:
  - "2. The Model\n   The model defines three areas of interest on which all underlying\n\
    \   concepts are based.\n        1. The definition of a minimal set of metrics\
    \ to be gathered\n        2. The definition of a format for storing collected\
    \ statistical\n           data.\n        3. The definition of methods and formats\
    \ for generating\n           reports.\n   The model indicates that old tools used\
    \ today could be retrofitted\n   into the new paradigm. This could be done by\
    \ providing conversion-\n   filters between the old and the new environment tools.\
    \ In this sense\n   this model intends to advocate the development of public domain\n\
    \   software for use by participating NOCs.\n   One basic idea with the model\
    \ is that statistical data stored at one\n   place could be retrieved and displayed\
    \ at some other place.\n"
- title: 2.1 Metrics and Polling Periods
  contents:
  - "2.1 Metrics and Polling Periods\n   The intention here is to define a minimal\
    \ set of metrics that easily\n   could be gathered using standard SNMP based network\
    \ management tools.\n   These metrics should hence be available as variables in\
    \ the Internet\n   Standard MIB.\n   If the Internet Standard MIB is changed also\
    \ this minimal set of\n   metrics could be reconsidered as there are many metrics\
    \ viewed as\n   important but currently not being defined in the standard MIB.\
    \  For\n   some metrics being highly desirable to collect there are currently\
    \ no\n   way to get them into the Internet Standard MIB as these metrics\n   probably\
    \ are not possible to retrieve using SNMP.  Tools and methods\n   in gathering\
    \ such metrics should be explicitly defined if such\n   metrics are to be considered.\
    \ This is, however, outside of the scope\n   of this memo.\n"
- title: 2.2 Format for Storing Collected Data
  contents:
  - "2.2 Format for Storing Collected Data\n   A format for storing data is defined.\
    \ The intention is to minimize\n   redundant information by using a single header\
    \ structure where all\n   information relevant to a certain set of statistical\
    \ data is stored.\n   This header section will give information on when and where\
    \ the\n   corresponding statistical data where collected.\n"
- title: 2.3 Reports
  contents:
  - "2.3 Reports\n   Some basic classes of reports are suggested with regards to different\n\
    \   views of network behavior. For this reason reports on totals of\n   octets\
    \ and packets over some period in time are regarded as essential\n   to give an\
    \ overall view of the traffic flows in a network.\n   Differentiation between\
    \ application and protocols to give ideas on\n   which type of traffic is dominant\
    \ is regarded as needed.  Finally\n   reports on resource utilization are recommended..\n\
    \   Depending on the intention with a report the timeperiod over which it\n  \
    \ spans may vary. For capacity planning there may be a need for longer\n   term\
    \ reports while in engineering and operation there may be\n   sufficient with\
    \ reports on weekly or daily basis.\n"
- title: 2.4 Security Issues
  contents:
  - "2.4 Security Issues\n   There are legal, ethical and political concerns of data\
    \ sharing.\n   People are concerned about showing data that may make one of the\n\
    \   networks look bad.\n   For this reason there is a need to insure integrity,\
    \ conformity and\n   confidentiality of the shared data. To be useful, the same\
    \ data must\n   be collected from all of the involved sites and it must be collected\n\
    \   at the same interval. To prevent vendors from getting an unfair\n   performance\
    \ information, certain data must not be made available.\n"

  - "5.1 Optimizing and Concentrating Data to Resources\n   To avoid redundant data\
    \ being stored in commonly available storage\n   there is a need for processing\
    \ the raw data. For example if a link is\n   down there is no need to continuous\
    \ store a counter that is not\n   changing. Using variables such as sysUpTime\
    \ and Line Status there is\n   the possibility of not continuously storing data\
    \ collected from links\n   and nodes where no traffic have been transmitted over\
    \ some period of\n   time.\n   Another aspect of processing is to decouple the\
    \ data from the raw\n   interface being polled. The intention should be to convert\
    \ such data\n   into the resource being of interest as for example the traffic\
    \ on a\n   given link. Changes of interface in a gateway for a given link should\n\
    \   not be visible in the provided data.\n"

    \   last of the previously logged entries over some aggregation period\n   and\
    \ compute a new entry.\n   Not to loose information on the peak values the aggregation\
    \ also\n   means that the peak value of the previous aggregation period is\n \

    \   It is foreseen that over a relatively short period, polled data will\n   be\

  - "6. Storing of Statistical Data\n   This section describes a format for storing\
    \ of statistical data.  The\n   goal is to facilitate for a common set of tools\
    \ for the gathering,\n   storing and analysis of statistical data. The format\
    \ is defined with\n   the intention to minimize redundant information and by this\
    \ minimize\n   required storage. If a client server based model for retrieving\n\
    \   remote statistical data is later being developed, the specified\n   storage\
    \ format should be possible to used as the transmission\n   protocol.\n   The\
    \ format is built up by three different sections within the\n   statistical storage,\
    \ a label section, a device section and a data\n   section. The label section\
    \ gives the start and end times for a given\n   data section as well as the file\
    \ where the actual data is stored.\n   The device section specifies what is being\
    \ logged in the\n   corresponding data section.\n   To facilitate for multiple\
    \ data sections within one log-file, label\n   sections, device sections and data\
    \ sections may occur more than once.\n   Each section type is delimited by a BEGIN-END\
    \ pair.  Label and device\n   sections could either be stored directly in the\
    \ data-file or as\n   separate files where the corresponding data-file is pointed\
    \ out by\n   the data-file entry in the label section.\n   A data section must\
    \ correspond to exactly one label section and one\n   device section.  If more\
    \ label sections and device sections each data\n   section will belong to the\
    \ label section and device section\n   immediately prepending the data section\

  contents:
  - "7.2.3.1 Utilization as Maximum Peak Behavior\n   The link utilization is used\
    \ to capture information on network\n   loading.  The polling interval must be\
    \ small enough to be significant\n   with respect to variations in human activity\
    \ since this is the\n   activity that drives loading in network variation. On\
    \ the other hand,\n   there is no need to make it smaller than an interval over\
    \ which\n   excessive delay would notably impact productivity. For this reason\
    \ 30\n   minutes is a good estimate the time at which people remain in one\n \
    \  activity and over which prolonged high delay will affect their\n   productivity.\
    \  To track 30 minute variations, there is a need to\n   sample twice as frequently,\
    \ i.e., every 15 minutes. Using above\n   recommended polling period of 10 minutes\
    \ this will hence be\n   sufficient to capture variations in utilizations.\n \
    \  A possible format for reporting utilizations seen as peak behaviors\n   is\
    \ to use a method of combining averages and peak measurements onto\n   the same\
    \ diagram. Compare for example peak-meters on audio-equipment.\n   If for example\
    \ a diagram contains the daily totals for some period,\n   then the peaks would\
    \ be the most busy hour during each day. If the\n   diagram was totals on hourly\
    \ basis then the peak would be the maximum\n   10 minutes period for each hour.\n\
    \   By combining the average and the maximum values for a certain\n   timeperiod\
    \ it will be possible to detect line utilization and\n   bottlenecks due to temporary\
    \ high loads.\n"

    \ out above in the categorization of metrics there\n   are metrics which certainly\
    \ could have been recommended if being\n   available in the Internet Standard\
    \ MIB. To facilitate for such\n   metrics to be part of the set of recommended\
    \ metrics it will be\n   necessary to specify a subtree in the Internet Standard\
    \ MIB\n   containing variables judged necessary in the scope of performing\n \
    \  operational statistics.\n"

  - "8.3 Detailed Resource Utilization Statistics\n   One area of interest not covered\
    \ in the above description of metrics\n   and presentation formats is to present\
    \ statistics on detailed views\n   of the traffic flows. Such views could include\
    \ statistics on a per\n   application basis and on a per protocol basis. Today\
    \ such metrics are\n   not part of the Internet Standard MIB. Tools like the NSF\
    \ NNStat are\n   being used to gather information of this kind. A possible way\
    \ to\n   achieve such data could be to define a NNStat MIB or to include such\n\
    \   variables in the above suggested operational statistics MIB subtree.\n"
