    \           JANUARY 1984\n     1  INTRODUCTION\n          The DARPA Catenet is\
    \ expected to be a continuously expanding\n     system,  with  more  and  more\
    \  hosts  on  more and more networks\n     participating in it.  Of course, this\
    \ will require more and  more\n     gateways.   In  the  past,  such  expansion\
    \  has taken place in a\n     relatively unstructured manner.  New gateways, \
    \ often  containing\n     radically different software than the existing gateways,\
    \ would be\n     added and would immediately begin  participating  in  the  common\n\
    \     routing algorithm via the GGP protocol.  However, as the internet\n    \
    \ grows larger and larger, this simple method of expansion  becomes\n     less\
    \ and less feasible.  There are a number of reasons for this:\n          - the\
    \ overhead of the routing algorithm becomes  excessively\n            large;\n\
    \          - the  proliferation   of   radically   different   gateways\n    \
    \        participating  in  a single common routing algorithm makes\n        \
    \    maintenance and fault isolation nearly  impossible,  since\n            it\
    \  becomes  impossible to regard       the internet as an\n            integrated\
    \ communications system;\n          - the  gateway  software  and  algorithms,\
    \  especially   the\n            routing  algorithm, become too rigid and inflexible,\
    \ since\n     RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n\
    \            any proposed change  must be made in  too  many  different\n    \
    \        places   and   by   too   many   different        people.\n         \
    \ In the future, the internet is expected to evolve into a set\n     of  separate\
    \  sections or  \"autonomous  systems\",  each  of which\n     consists of a set\
    \ of one or more relatively homogeneous gateways.\n     The  protocols,  and \
    \ in  particular  the routing algorithm which\n     these gateways use among themselves,\
    \ will be  a  private  matter,\n     and  need never be implemented in gateways\
    \ outside the particular\n     sections or system.\n          In the simplest\
    \ case, an autonomous system might consist  of\n     just a single gateway connecting,\
    \ for example, a local network to\n     the ARPANET.  Such a gateway might be\
    \ called  a  \"stub  gateway\",\n     since  its  only purpose is to interface\
    \ the local network to the\n     rest of the internet, and it is  not  intended\
    \  to  be  used  for\n     handling  any traffic which neither originated in nor\
    \ is destined\n     for that particular local network.  In the near-term  future,\
    \  we\n     will  begin  to  think  of  the  internet  as a set of autonomous\n\
    \     systems, one of which consists of the DARPA gateways  on  ARPANET\n    \
    \ and  SATNET,  and  the others of which are stub gateways to local\n     networks.\
    \   The former system, which we  shall  call  the  \"core\"\n     RFC 888    \
    \                                          JANUARY 1984\n     system,  will be\
    \ used as a transport or \"long-haul\" system by the\n     latter systems.\n \
    \         Ultimately, the internet may consist of a number of co-equal\n     autonomous\
    \  systems,  any  of  which  may  be used as a transport\n     medium for traffic\
    \ originating in any system and destined for any\n     system.  This more general\
    \ case is still the subject of research.\n     This paper describes only how stub\
    \ gateways connect to  the  core\n     system using the Exterior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (EGP).\n     RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n\
    \     2  DEFINITIONS AND OVERVIEW\n          For the purposes of this paper, a\
    \ \"stub gateway\" is  defined\n     as follows:\n          - it is not a core\
    \ gateway\n          - it shares a network with at least one core gateway (has\
    \ an\n            interface on the same network as some core gateway)\n      \
    \    - it has interfaces to one or more networks  which  have  no\n          \
    \  core gateways\n          - all other nets which are reachable from  the  core\
    \  system\n            via  the stub have no other path to the core system except\n\
    \            via the stub\n          The stub gateway is expected to fully execute\
    \  the  Internet\n     Control Message Protocol (ICMP), as well as the EGP protocol.\
    \  In\n     particular, it must respond to ICMP echo requests, and must  send\n\
    \     ICMP  destination  dead  messages  as  appropriate.   It  is also\n    \
    \ required to send ICMP Redirect messages as appropriate.\n          Autonomous\
    \ systems will be  assigned  16-bit  identification\n     numbers  (in  much \
    \ the same ways as network and protocol numbers\n     are now assigned), and every\
    \ EGP message header contains a  field\n     RFC 888                         \
    \                     JANUARY 1984\n     for  this  number.   Zero  will not be\
    \ assigned to any autonomous\n     system; the use  of  zero  as  an  autonomous\
    \  system  number  is\n     reserved for future use.\n          We call two gateways\
    \ \"neighbors\" if there is  a  network  to\n     which  each  has  an interface.\
    \  If two neighbors are part of the\n     same autonomous system, we  call  them\
    \  INTERIOR  NEIGHBORS;  for\n     example,  any  two core gateways on the same\
    \ network are interior\n     neighbors of each other.  If two neighbors are not\
    \  part  of  the\n     same  autonomous  system,  we  call  them EXTERIOR NEIGHBORS;\
    \ for\n     example, a stub gateway and any core gateway that share a network\n\
    \     are exterior neighbors of each other.  In order for one system to\n    \
    \ use another as a transport medium, gateways  which  are  exterior\n     neighbors\
    \  of  each other must be able to find out which networks\n     can be reached\
    \ through the other.  The Exterior Gateway  Protocol\n     enables this information\
    \ to be passed between exterior neighbors.\n     Since it is a polling protocol,\
    \ it also enables each  gateway  to\n     control   the  rate  at  which  it \
    \ sends  and  receives  network\n     reachability information, allowing each\
    \ system to control its own\n     overhead.   It  also  enables  each system to\
    \ have an independent\n     routing algorithm whose operation cannot be disrupted\
    \ by failures\n     of other systems.\n     RFC 888                          \
    \                    JANUARY 1984\n          The Exterior Gateway Protocol has\
    \ three parts: (a)  Neighbor\n     Acquisition Protocol, (b) Neighbor Reachability\
    \ Protocol, and (c)\n     Network  Reachability  determination.   Note  that \
    \ all  messages\n     defined  by EGP are intended to travel only a single \"\
    hop\".  That\n     is, they originate at one gateway and are sent to  a  neighboring\n\
    \     gateway   without  the  mediation  of  any  intervening  gateway.\n    \
    \ Therefore, the time-to-live field should be set to a  very  small\n     value.\
    \   Gateways  which  encounter EGP messages in their message\n     streams which\
    \ are not addressed to them may discard them.\n          Each EGP message contains\
    \ a sequence  number.   The  gateway\n     should maintain one sequence number\
    \ per neighbor.\n     RFC 888                                              JANUARY\
    \ 1984\n     3  NEIGHBOR ACQUISITION\n          Before it is possible to obtain\
    \ routing information from  an\n     exterior  gateway,  it  is necessary to acquire\
    \ that gateway as a\n     direct neighbor.  (The distinction between  direct \
    \ and  indirect\n     neighbors  will  be  made  in a later section.)  In order\
    \ for two\n     gateways to become direct neighbors, they must be  neighbors,\
    \  in\n     the  sense  defined  above,  and  they  must execute the NEIGHBOR\n\
    \     ACQUISITION  PROTOCOL,  which  is  simply  a   standard   two-way\n    \
    \ handshake.\n          A gateway that wishes to initiate neighbor acquisition\
    \  with\n     another  sends  it  a Neighbor Acquisition Request.  This message\n\
    \     should be repeatedly transmitted (at a reasonable  rate,  perhaps\n    \
    \ once  every  30 seconds or so) until a Neighbor Acquisition Reply\n     or a\
    \ Neighbor Acquisition Refusal is received.  The Request  will\n     contain \
    \ an  identification number which is copied into the reply\n     so that request\
    \ and reply can be matched up.\n          A gateway receiving  a  Neighbor  Acquisition\
    \  Request  must\n     determine  whether  it  wishes to become a direct neighbor\
    \ of the\n     source of the Request.  If not, it may, at  its  option,  respond\n\
    \     with   a   Neighbor   Acquisition   Refusal  message,  optionally\n    \
    \ specifying the reason for refusal.  Otherwise, it should  send  a\n     RFC\
    \ 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n     Neighbor\
    \ Acquisition Reply message.\n          The gateway  that  sent  the  Request\
    \  should  consider  the\n     Neighbor Acquisition complete when it has received\
    \ the neighbor's\n     Reply.  The gateway that  sent  the  Reply  should  consider\
    \  the\n     acquisition complete when it has sent the Reply.\n          Unmatched\
    \ Replies or Refusals should be  discarded  after  a\n     reasonable  period\
    \  of time.  However, information about any such\n     unmatched messages may\
    \ be useful for diagnostic purposes.\n          A Neighbor Acquisition  Request\
    \  from  a  gateway  which  is\n     already a direct neighbor should be responded\
    \ to with a Reply.\n          A Neighbor Acquisition Request or Reply from  gateway\
    \  G  to\n     gateway  G'  carries the minimum interval in seconds with which\
    \ G\n     is willing to answer Neighbor Reachability Hello Messages from G'\n\
    \     and the minimum interval in seconds with which G is willing to be\n    \
    \ polled for NR messages (see below).\n          If  a  gateway  wishes  to  cease\
    \  being  a  neighbor  of  a\n     particular  exterior  gateway, it sends a Neighbor\
    \ Cease message.\n     A gateway  receiving  a  Neighbor  Cease  message  should\
    \  always\n     respond with a Neighbor Cease Acknowledgment.  It should cease\
    \ to\n     treat the sender of the message as a neighbor in any way.   Since\n\
    \     RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n    \
    \ there  is  a  significant  amount  of protocol run between direct\n     neighbors\
    \ (see below), if some gateway no longer needs  to  be  a\n     direct  neighbor\
    \  of  some other, it is \"polite\" to indicate this\n     fact with a Neighbor\
    \ Cease Message.  The Neighbor  Cease  Message\n     should  be  retransmitted\
    \  (up  to some number of times) until an\n     acknowledgment for it is received.\n\
    \          Once  a  Neighbor  Cease  message  has  been  received,  the\n    \
    \ Neighbor   Reachability  Protocol  (below)  should  cease  to  be\n     executed.\n\
    \          A stub should have tables configured in with  the  addresses\n    \
    \ of  a  small  number  of  the  core gateways (no more than two or\n     three)\
    \ with which it has  a  common  network.   It  will  be  the\n     responsibility\
    \  of the stub to initiate neighbor acquisition with\n     these gateways.  If\
    \ the direct neighbors of  a  stub  should  all\n     fail,  it  will  be  the\
    \ responsibility of the stub to acquire at\n     least one new direct neighbor.\
    \  It can do so by choosing  one  of\n     the  core  gateways which it has had\
    \ as an indirect neighbor (see\n     below), and executing the neighbor acquisition\
    \ protocol with  it.\n     (It  is  possible  that  no  more than one core gateway\
    \ will ever\n     agree to become a direct neighbor with any given stub gateway\
    \  at\n     any one time.)\n     RFC 888                                     \
    \         JANUARY 1984\n     4  NEIGHBOR REACHABILITY PROTOCOL\n          It is\
    \ important for a gateway to keep real-time  information\n     as  to the reachability\
    \ of its neighbors.  If a gateway concludes\n     that a particular neighbor cannot\
    \ be  reached,  it  should  cease\n     forwarding  traffic to that gateway. \
    \ To make that determination,\n     a NEIGHBOR REACHABILITY protocol is  needed.\
    \   The  EGP  protocol\n     provides two messages types for this purpose -- a\
    \ \"Hello\" message\n     and an \"I Heard You\" message.\n          When a \"\
    Hello\" message is received from a  direct  neighbor,\n     an \"I Heard You\"\
    \ must be returned to that neighbor \"immediately\".\n     The delay between receiving\
    \ a \"Hello\" and returning an  \"I  Heard\n     You\" should never be more than\
    \ a few seconds.\n          Core  gateways  will  use  the   following   algorithm\
    \   for\n     determining reachablility of an exterior neighbor:\n          A\
    \ reachable  neighbor  shall  be  declared  unreachable  if,\n     during  the\
    \  time  in  which  the  core  gateway  sent its last n\n     \"Hello\"s, it received\
    \ fewer than k \"I Heard You\"s in return.   An\n     unreachable  neighbor  shall\
    \ be declared reachable if, during the\n     time in which the core gateway  sent\
    \  its  last  m  \"Hello\"s,  it\n     received at least j \"I Heard You\"s in\
    \ return.\n     RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n\
    \          Stub  gateways  may  also  send  \"Hello\"s  to  their  direct\n  \
    \   neighbors  and  receive  \"I Heard You\"s in return.  The algorithm\n    \
    \ for determining reachability may  be  similar  to  the  algorithm\n     described\
    \  above.  However, it is not necessary for stubs to send\n     \"Hello\"s.  The\
    \ \"Hello\" and \"I Heard You\" messages have  a  status\n     field  which  the\
    \  sending  gateway  uses  to indicate whether it\n     thinks  the  receiving\
    \  gateway  is  reachable  or   not.    This\n     information  can  be  useful\
    \  for  diagnostic  purposes.  It also\n     allows a stub gateway  to  make \
    \ its  reachability  determination\n     parasitic  on  its  core neighbor: only\
    \ the core gateway actually\n     needs to send \"Hello\" messages, and the stub\
    \ can declare it up or\n     down based on the status field in the \"Hello\".\
    \  That is, the stub\n     gateway (which sends only  \"I  Heard  You\"s)  declares\
    \  the  core\n     gateway  (which  sends  only  \"Hello\"s)  to be reachable\
    \ when the\n     \"Hello\"s from the core indicate that it has declared the stub\
    \  to\n     be reachable.\n          The frequency with which the  \"Hello\"s\
    \  are  sent,  and  the\n     values of the parameters k, n, j, and m cannot be\
    \ specified here.\n     For best results, this will depend on the characteristics\
    \ of  the\n     neighbor  and  of the network which the neighbors have in common.\n\
    \     THIS IMPLIES THAT THE PROPER PARAMETERS MAY NEED TO BE DETERMINED\n    \
    \ JOINTLY  BY THE DESIGNERS AND IMPLEMENTERS OF THE TWO NEIGHBORING\n     RFC\
    \ 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n     GATEWAYS;\
    \  choosing  algorithms  and  parameters  in   isolation,\n     without  considering\
    \  the characteristics of the neighbor and the\n     connecting network, would\
    \ not be expected to  result  in  optimum\n     reachability determinations.\n\
    \          However, the Neighbor Acquisition Request and Reply messages\n    \
    \ provide  neighbors with a way to inform each other of the minimum\n     frequency\
    \ at which they  are  willing  to  answer  Hellos.   When\n     gateway  G sends\
    \ a Neighbor Acquisition Request to gateway G', it\n     states that it does not\
    \  wish  to  answer  Hellos  from  G'  more\n     frequently  than  once  every\
    \  X  seconds.   G'  in  its Neighbor\n     Acquisition Reply states that it does\
    \ not wish to  answer  Hellos\n     from  G  more  frequently  than  once  every\
    \  Y seconds.  The two\n     frequencies do not have to be the same, but  each\
    \  neighbor  must\n     conform  to  the  interval requested by the other.  A\
    \ gateway may\n     send Hellos less frequently than requested, but not more.\n\
    \          A  direct  neighbor  gateway   should   also   be   declared\n    \
    \ unreachable  if  the  network  connecting it supplies lower level\n     protocol\
    \ information from which this can be deduced.   Thus,  for\n     example,  if\
    \  a gateway receives an 1822 Destination Dead message\n     from the ARPANET\
    \ which indicates that a direct neighbor is  dead,\n     it should declare that\
    \ neighbor unreachable.  The neighbor should\n     RFC 888                   \
    \                           JANUARY 1984\n     not be declared reachable again\
    \ until  the  requisite  number  of\n     Hello/I-Heard-You packets have been\
    \ exchanged.\n          A direct neighbor which  has  become  unreachable  does\
    \  not\n     thereby  cease  to  be  a  direct  neighbor.  The neighbor can be\n\
    \     declared reachable again without  any  need  to  go  through  the\n    \
    \ neighbor  acquisition  protocol  again.  However, if the neighbor\n     remains\
    \ unreachable for an extremely long period of time, such as\n     an  hour,  the\
    \  gateway  should  cease to treat it as a neighbor,\n     i.e., should cease\
    \ sending Hello messages to  it.   The  neighbor\n     acquisition  protocol \
    \ would  then  need to be repeated before it\n     could become a direct neighbor\
    \ again.\n          \"Hello\" messages from sources other  than  direct  neighbors\n\

    \ Let gateway G have an interface to  network  N.\n     We  say  that G is AN\
    \ APPROPRIATE FIRST HOP to network M relative\n     to network N (where M and\
    \ N are distinct networks) if and only if\n     the following condition holds:\n\
    \          Traffic which is destined for network M, and  which  arrives\n    \
    \      at gateway G over its network N interface, will be forwarded\n        \
    \  to M by G over a path  which  does  not  include  any  other\n          gateway\
    \ with an interface to network N.\n          In short, G is  an  appropriate \
    \ first  hop  for  network  M\n     relative  to network N just in case there\
    \ is no better gateway on\n     network N through which to route traffic which\
    \  is  destined  for\n     network  M.   For  optimal routing, traffic in network\
    \ N which is\n     destined for network M ought always to be forwarded to a  gateway\n\
    \     which is an appropriate first hop.\n          In  order  for  exterior \
    \ neighbors  G  and  G'  (which  are\n     neighbors  over network N) to be able\
    \ to use each other as packet\n     switches for forwarding traffic to remote\
    \ networks, each needs to\n     know  the  list of networks for which the other\
    \ is an appropriate\n     first hop.  The Exterior  Gateway  Protocol  defines\
    \  a  message,\n     RFC 888                                              JANUARY\
    \ 1984\n     called  the  Network  Reachability  Message  (or NR message), for\n\
    \     transferring this information.\n          Let G be a gateway on network\
    \ N.  Then the NR message  which\n     G sends about network N must contain the\
    \ following information:\n          A list of all the networks for which  G  is\
    \  an  appropriate\n          first hop relative to network N.\n     If G' can\
    \ obtain this information from exterior neighbor G,  then\n     it  knows  that\
    \ no traffic destined for networks which are NOT in\n     that list should be\
    \ forwarded to G.  (It cannot simply  conclude,\n     however,  that all traffic\
    \ for any networks in that list ought to\n     be forwarded via G, since G' may\
    \ also have other neighbors  which\n     are also appropriate first hops to network\
    \ N.  For example, G and\n     G'' might each be neighbors of G',  but  might\
    \  be  \"equidistant\"\n     from  some  network  M.   Then each could be an appropriate\
    \ first\n     hop.)\n          For each network in the list, the NR message also\
    \  specifies\n     the \"distance\" (according to some metric whose definition\
    \ is left\n     to the designers of the autonomous system of which gateway G is\
    \ a\n     member)  from  G  to  that  network.   Core  gateways will report\n\
    \     distances less than 128 for networks that can be reached  without\n    \
    \ RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n     leaving\
    \  the  core  system,  and  greater  than  or  equal to 128\n     otherwise. \
    \ A stub gateway should report distances less than  128\n     for all networks\
    \ listed in its NR messages.\n          The maximum value of distance (255.) shall\
    \ be taken to  mean\n     that  the network is UNREACHABLE.  ALL OTHER VALUES\
    \ WILL BE TAKEN\n     TO MEAN THAT THE NETWORK IS REACHABLE.\n          If an\
    \ NR message from some gateway G fails to  mention  some\n     network  N which\
    \ was mentioned in the previous NR message from G,\n     it is possible that N\
    \ has become unreachable from G.  If  several\n     successive  NR  messages \
    \ from  G omit mention of N, it should be\n     taken to mean that  N  is  no\
    \  longer  reachable  from  G.   This\n     procedure  is  necessary  to  ensure\
    \  that  networks which can no\n     longer be  reached,  but  which  are  never\
    \  explicitly  declared\n     unreachable, are timed out and removed from the\
    \ list of reachable\n     networks.\n          It will often be the case that\
    \ where a core gateway G and  a\n     stub  gateway  G'  are  direct neighbors\
    \ on network N, G knows of\n     many more gateway neighbors on network N,  and\
    \  knows  for  which\n     networks  those  gateway neighbors are the appropriate\
    \ first hop.\n     Since the stub G' may not know about all these  other  neighbors,\n\
    \     it  is  convenient  and often more efficient for it to be able to\n    \
    \ RFC 888                                              JANUARY 1984\n     obtain\
    \ this information from G.  Therefore, the  EGP  NR  message\n     also  contains\
    \  fields  which allow the core gateway G to specify\n     the following information:\n\
    \          a) A list of all neighbors (both interior and exterior) of G\n    \
    \         (on  network  N)  which  G  has reliably determined to be\n        \
    \     reachable.  G may also include indirect neighbors in this\n            \
    \ list (see below.)\n          b) For each of those neighbors, the  list  of \
    \ networks  for\n             which that neighbor is an appropriate first hop\
    \ (relative\n             to network N).\n          c) For each such <neighbor,\
    \ network>  pair,  the  \"distance\"\n             from that neighbor to that\
    \ network.\n          Thus the NR message provides a means of allowing  a  gateway\n\
    \     to  \"discover\" new neighbors by seeing whether a neighbor that it\n  \
    \   already knows  of  has  any  additional  neighbors  on  the  same\n     network.\
    \  This information also makes possible the implementation\n     of the INDIRECT\
    \ NEIGHBOR strategy defined below.\n          A  more  precise  description  of\
    \  the  NR  message  is  the\n     following.\n     RFC 888                  \
    \                            JANUARY 1984\n          The data portion of the \
    \ message  will  consist  largely  of\n     blocks  of data.  Each block will\
    \ be headed by a gateway address,\n     which will be the address  either  of\
    \  the  gateway  sending  the\n     message  or  of  one  of  that gateway's neighbors.\
    \  Each gateway\n     address will be followed by a list of the networks for which\

    \     distance from the gateway will be grouped together in this  list,\n    \
    \ preceded  by  the  distance  itself and the number of networks at\n     that\

    \  NR  messages  to  any  other\n     gateway,  except  as  a  response  to  an\
    \  NR  Poll from a direct\n     neighbor.  However, a gateway is required to \
    \ respond  to  an  NR\n     Poll  from  a  direct neighbor within several seconds\
    \ (subject to\n     the qualification two paragraphs  hence),  even  if  the \
    \ gateway\n     believes that neighbor to be down.\n          The EGP NR Poll\
    \ message is defined  for  this  purpose.   No\n     gateway  may  poll another\
    \ for an NR message more often than once\n     per minute.  A gateway receiving\
    \ more than one  poll  per  minute\n     may  simply  ignore  the  excess  polls,\
    \  or  may return an error\n     message.\n          The minimum interval which\
    \ gateway  G  will  accept  as  the\n     polling  interval  from gateway G' and\
    \ the minimum interval which\n     G' will accept as the polling interval from\
    \ G  are  specified  at\n     the  time  that  G  and  G'  become  direct  neighbors.\
    \  Both the\n     Neighbor Acquisition Request and the Neighbor  Acquisition \
    \ Reply\n     allow  the  sender  to  specify,  in seconds, its desired minimum\n\
    \     polling interval.  If G specifies to G' that its minimum  polling\n    \
    \ interval  is  X,  G'  should not poll G more frequently than once\n     every\
    \ X seconds.  G will not guarantee to  answer  more  frequent\n     RFC 888  \
    \                                            JANUARY 1984\n     polls.\n     \
    \     Polls must only  be  sent  to  direct  neighbors  which  are\n     declared\
    \ reachable by the neighbor reachability protocol.\n          An NR Poll message\
    \ contains a sequence number chosen by  the\n     polling  gateway.   The polled\
    \ gateway will return this number in\n     the NR message it sends in response\
    \ to the poll,  to  enable  the\n     polling gateway to match up received NR\
    \ messages with polls.\n          In general, a poll should be retransmitted \
    \ some  number  of\n     times  (with a reasonable interval between retransmissions)\
    \ until\n     an NR message is received.  IF NO NR MESSAGE  IS  RECEIVED  AFTER\n\
    \     THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RETRANSMISSIONS, THE POLLING GATEWAY SHOULD\n    \
    \ ASSUME THAT THE POLLED GATEWAY IS NOT AN  APPROPRIATE  FIRST  HOP\n     FOR\
    \  ANY  NETWORK  WHATSOEVER.   The  optimum  parameters for the\n     polling/retransmission\
    \  algorithm  will  be  dependent   on   the\n     characteristics   of   the\
    \  two  neighbors  and  of  the  network\n     connecting them.\n          Received\
    \ NR messages whose  identification  numbers  do  not\n     match  the  identification\
    \  number of the most recently sent poll\n     shall be ignored.  There is no\
    \ provision for multiple outstanding\n     polls to the same neighbor.\n     RFC\

    \ NR MESSAGES\n          In general, NR messages are to be sent only in response\
    \ to a\n     poll.   However,  between  two  successive polls from an exterior\n\
    \     neighbor, a gateway may send one  and  only  one  unsolicited  NR\n    \
    \ message  to  that  neighbor.   This  gives  it limited ability to\n     quickly\
    \ announce  network  reachability  changes  that  may  have\n     occurred in\
    \ the interval since the last poll.  Excess unsolicited\n     NR messages may\
    \ be ignored, or an error message may be returned.\n          An NR message should\
    \ be sent within  several  seconds  after\n     receipt  of  a poll.  Failure\
    \ to respond in a timely manner to an\n     NR poll may result in the polling\
    \  gateway's  deciding  that  the\n     polled gateway is not an appropriate first\
    \ hop to any network.\n          NR messages sent in response to  polls  carry\
    \  the  sequence\n     number  of  the  poll  message in their \"sequence number\"\
    \ fields.\n     Unsolicited NR messages carry the identification  number  of \
    \ the\n     last  poll  received,  and have the \"unsolicited\" bit set.  (Note\n\
    \     that this allows for only a single  unsolicited  NR  message  per\n    \
    \ polling period.)\n          Polls from  non-neighbors,  from  neighbors  which\
    \  are  not\n     declared  reachable, or with bad IP source network fields, should\n\

    \ be responded to with an EGP error message  with  the  appropriate\n     \"reason\"\

    \ G' is not a neighbor of  G  on  its  interface  to\n     network  N  (or G'\
    \ does not have an interface to network N), then\n     the source network field\
    \ is considered \"bad\".\n          A gateway is normally not required to send\
    \ more than one  NR\n     message  within the minimum interval specified at the\
    \ time of the\n     neighbor acquisition.  An exception to  this  must  be  made\
    \  for\n     duplicate polls (successive polls with the same sequence number),\n\
    \     which occur when an NR message is lost  in  transit.   A  gateway\n    \
    \ should  send an NR message containing its most recent information\n     in response\
    \ to a duplicate poll.\n     RFC 888                                         \
    \     JANUARY 1984\n     8  INDIRECT NEIGHBORS\n          Becoming a \"direct\
    \ neighbor\" of an exterior gateway requires\n     three  steps:  (a)  neighbor\
    \  acquisition, (b) running a neighbor\n     reachability protocol, and (c) polling\
    \ the neighbor  periodically\n     for NR messages.  Suppose, however, that gateway\
    \ G receives an NR\n     message from G', in which G'  indicates  the  presence\
    \  of  other\n     neighbors  G1, ..., Gn, each of which is an appropriate first\
    \ hop\n     for some set of networks to which G' itself is not an appropriate\n\
    \     first hop.  Then G should be allowed to forward traffic for those\n    \
    \ networks directly to the appropriate one of G1, ..., Gn,  without\n     having\
    \ to send it to G' first.  In this case, G may be considered\n     an INDIRECT\
    \ NEIGHBOR of G1, ..., Gn, since it is  a  neighbor  of\n     these  other  gateways\
    \ for the purpose of forwarding traffic, but\n     does not perform neighbor acquisition,\
    \ neighbor reachability,  or\n     exchange   of  NR  messages  with  them.  \
    \ Neighbor  and  network\n     reachability information is obtained indirectly\
    \ via G', hence the\n     designation  \"indirect  neighbor\".   We say that G\
    \ is an indirect\n     neighbor of G1, ..., Gn VIA G'.\n          If G is an indirect\
    \ neighbor of  G'  via  G'',  and  then  G\n     receives  an  NR  message  from\
    \  G'' which does not mention G', G\n     should treat G' as having become unreachable.\n\

    \ 9  LIMITATIONS\n          It must be clearly  understood  that  the  Exterior\
    \  Gateway\n     Protocol   does  not  in  itself  constitute  a  network  routing\n\
    \     algorithm.  In addition, it does not provide all the  information\n    \
    \ needed  to  implement  a  general area routing algorithm.  If the\n     topology\
    \ does not obey the  rules  given  for  stubs  above,  the\n     Exterior  Gateway\
    \  Protocol  does  not provide enough topological\n     information to prevent\
    \ loops.\n          If any gateway sends an NR message with  false  information,\n\
    \     claiming  to be an appropriate first hop to a network which it in\n    \
    \ fact cannot even reach, traffic  destined  to  that  network  may\n     never\
    \ be delivered.  Implementers must bear this in mind.\n     RFC 888          \
