  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This specification defines a new SIP header field, Feature-Caps.\
    \  The\n   Feature-Caps header field conveys feature-capability indicators that\n\
    \   are used to indicate support of features and capabilities for SIP\n   entities\
    \ that are not represented by the Uniform Resource Identifier\n   (URI) of the\
    \ Contact header field.\n   SIP entities that are represented by the URI of the\
    \ SIP Contact\n   header field can convey media feature tags in the Contact header\n\
    \   field to indicate support of features and capabilities.\n   This specification\
    \ also defines feature-capability indicators and\n   creates a new IANA registry,\
    \ \"Proxy-Feature Feature-Capability\n   Indicator Trees\", for registering feature-capability\
    \ indicators.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  General\n   If the URI in a Contact header field of a request or response\n\
    \   represents a SIP entity, the entity MUST NOT indicate supported\n   features\
    \ and capabilities using a Feature-Caps header field within\n   that request or\
    \ response.\n   When a SIP entity receives a SIP request, or response, that contains\n\
    \   one or more Feature-Caps header fields, the feature-capability\n   indicators\
    \ in the header field inform the entity about the features\n   and capabilities\
    \ supported by entities in the SIP message signaling\n   path.  The procedure\
    \ by which features and capabilities are invoked\n   are outside the scope of\
    \ this specification and MUST be described by\n   individual feature-capability\
    \ indicator specifications.\n   A Feature-Caps header field value cannot convey\
    \ the address of the\n   SIP entity that inserted the Feature-Caps header field.\
    \  If\n   additional data about a supported feature needs to be conveyed, such\n\
    \   as the address of the SIP entity that indicated support of the\n   feature,\
    \ then the feature definition needs to define a way to convey\n   that information\
    \ as a value of the associated feature-capability\n   indicator.\n   When a SIP\
    \ entity adds a Feature-Caps header field to a SIP message,\n   it MUST place\
    \ the header field before any existing Feature-Caps\n   header field in the message\
    \ to be forwarded, so that the added header\n   field becomes the top-most one.\
    \  Then, when another SIP entity\n   receives a SIP request or the response, the\
    \ SIP feature-capability\n   indicators in the top-most Feature-Caps header field\
    \ will represent\n   the supported features and capabilities \"closest\", from\
    \ a SIP\n   signaling point of view, to the entity.\n   Based on features and\
    \ policies, a SIP entity MAY remove a\n   Feature-Caps header field from a SIP\
    \ message.  Also, a SIP entity MAY\n   remove a feature-capability indicator from\
    \ a Feature-Caps header\n   field within a SIP message.  A SIP entity SHOULD NOT\
    \ re-order the\n   Feature-Caps header fields within a SIP message.\n   For a\
    \ given fc-value, as defined in Section 6.2.1, the order in which\n   feature-capability\
    \ indicators are listed has no significance.  For\n   example, \"foo;bar\" and\
    \ \"bar;foo\" have the same meaning (i.e., that\n   the SIP entity that inserted\
    \ the feature-capability indicator\n   supports the features and capabilities\
    \ associated with the \"foo\" and\n   \"bar\" feature-capability indicators).\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  B2BUA Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  B2BUA Behavior\n   The procedures in this section apply to User Agents\

    \ by a\n   Record-Route header field rather than by the URI of the Contact\n \
    \  header field.\n   When such a UA sends a SIP request, if the UA wants to indicate\n\
    \   support of features and capabilities towards its downstream SIP\n   entities,\
    \ it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the request,\n   containing one or\
    \ more feature-capability indicators associated with\n   the supported features\
    \ and capabilities, before it forwards the\n   request.\n   If the SIP request\
    \ is triggered by another SIP request that the B2BUA\n   has received, the UA\
    \ MAY forward received Feature-Caps header fields\n   by copying them to the outgoing\
    \ SIP request, similar to a SIP proxy,\n   before it inserts its own Feature-Caps\
    \ header field in the SIP\n   request.\n   When such a UA receives a SIP response,\
    \ if the UA wants to indicate\n   support of features and capabilities towards\
    \ its upstream SIP\n   entities, it inserts a Feature-Caps header field in the\
    \ response,\n   containing one or more feature-capability indicators associated\
    \ with\n   the supported features and capabilities, before it forwards the\n \
    \  response.\n   If the SIP response is triggered by another SIP response that\
    \ the\n   B2BUA has received, the UA MAY forward received Feature-Caps header\n\

    \ receivers of the request (or\n   response) that the feature associated with\

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The security issues for feature-capability indicators\
    \ are similar to\n   the ones defined in RFC 3840 for media feature tags.  Media\
    \ feature\n   tags can reveal information about end users and end-user equipment,\n\
    \   which can be used for industrial espionage.  The knowledge about end-\n  \
    \ user equipment capabilities can also be used to influence application\n   behavior.\
    \  As feature-capability indicators are not intended to\n   convey capability\
    \ information of end-user devices, such end-user\n   security aspects of RFC 3840\
    \ do not apply to feature-capability\n   indicators.\n   In addition, the security\
    \ issue discussed in RFC 3840 regarding an\n   attacker using the SIP caller preferences\
    \ extension [RFC3841] in\n   order to affect routing decisions does not apply,\
    \ as the mechanism is\n   not defined to be used with feature-capability indicators.\n\
    \   Feature-capability indicators can, however, provide capability and\n   characteristics\
    \ information about the SIP entity, some of which might\n   be sensitive.  Malicious\
    \ elements viewing the indicators may be able\n   to discern application deployment\
    \ details or identify elements with\n   exploitable feature implementation weaknesses.\
    \  The Feature-Caps\n   header field does not convey address information about\
    \ SIP entities.\n   However, individual feature-capability indicators might provide\n\
    \   address information as feature-capability indicator values.\n   Therefore,\
    \ if the feature-capability indicators provide information\n   that requires data\
    \ integrity or origin authentication, mechanisms for\n   providing those MUST\
    \ be provided.  If confidentiality is required,\n   then the specification MUST\
    \ call for the use of Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] at all hops.\
    \  Since there are no\n   satisfactory middle-to-end or middle-to-middle SIP confidentiality\n\
    \   mechanisms, TLS is as good as it gets, and specifications SHOULD NOT\n   define\
    \ feature-capability indicators that need confidentiality that\n   is better than\
    \ the hop-by-hop confidentiality provided by TLS.\n"
