- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The BGP-based control procedures for Multicast Virtual Private\n\
    \   Networks (MVPNs) make use of a BGP attribute known as the\n   \"P-Multicast\
    \ Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel\" attribute.  The\n   attribute contains a one-octet\
    \ \"Flags\" field.  The purpose of this\n   document is to establish an IANA registry\
    \ for the assignment of the\n   bits in this field.  Since the \"Flags\" field\
    \ contains only eight\n   bits, this document also defines a new BGP Extended\
    \ Community,\n   \"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\", that can be used\
    \ to carry\n   additional flags for the \"P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)\n\
    \   Tunnel\" attribute.  This document updates RFC 6514.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A BGP attribute, \"P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)\
    \ Tunnel\"\n   attribute is defined in [RFC6514].  This attribute, referred to\
    \ as\n   the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute in this document, contains a one-octet\n\
    \   \"Flags\" field.  Only one flag is defined in that RFC, but there is\n   now\
    \ a need to define additional flags.  However, that RFC did not\n   create an\
    \ IANA registry for the assignment of bits in the \"Flags\"\n   field.  This document\
    \ creates a registry for that purpose.  In\n   addition, there may be a need to\
    \ define more than eight flags.\n   Therefore this document defines a new BGP\
    \ Extended Community,\n   \"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\", that can\
    \ be used to carry\n   additional flags for the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute.  A\
    \ registry is also\n   created for this Extended Community, allowing IANA to assign\
    \ flag\n   bits from the Extended Community's six-octet value field.\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Extending the "PMSI Tunnel" Attribute "Flags" Field
  contents:
  - "2.  Extending the \"PMSI Tunnel\" Attribute \"Flags\" Field\n   In [RFC6514],\
    \ only a single octet in the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute is\n   defined to carry\
    \ bit flags.  This allows eight flags, which is\n   unlikely to be sufficient\
    \ for all future applications.\n   This document defines a new Transitive Opaque\
    \ Extended Community\n   ([RFC4360] [RFC7153]), \"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute\
    \ Flags\".  It\n   also defines a new bit flag in the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute\
    \ \"Flags\"\n   field, called the \"Extension\" flag.\n   The \"Additional PMSI\
    \ Tunnel Attribute Flags\" Extended Community MUST\n   NOT be carried by a given\
    \ BGP UPDATE message unless the following\n   conditions both hold:\n   o  the\
    \ given BGP UPDATE message is also carrying a \"PMSI Tunnel\"\n      attribute,\
    \ and\n   o  the \"Extension\" flag of that \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute's \"Flags\"\
    \n      field is set.\n   The six-octet value field of the \"Additional PMSI Tunnel\
    \ Attribute\n   Flags\" Extended Community is considered to be a string of 48\
    \ one-bit\n   flags.  As shown in Figure 1, the leftmost bit (the most significant\n\
    \   bit of the most significant octet) is bit 0, and the rightmost bit\n   (the\
    \ least significant bit of the least significant octet) is bit 47.\n      0  \

    \               Figure 1: Value Field of the \"Additional PMSI\n             \
    \   Tunnel Attribute Flags\" Extended Community\n   A BGP speaker MUST NOT attach\
    \ more than one \"Additional PMSI Tunnel\n   Attribute Flags\" Extended Community\
    \ to a given BGP UPDATE.  If a\n   given BGP UPDATE already contains an \"Additional\
    \ PMSI Tunnel\n   Attribute Flags\" Extended Community, a BGP speaker MUST NOT\
    \ attach\n   any additional such Extended Communities.\n   If a BGP speaker receives\
    \ a BGP UPDATE with more than one \"Additional\n   PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\"\
    \ Extended Communities attached, only the\n   flag settings in first occurrence\
    \ of the Extended Community are\n   significant.  Flag settings in subsequent\
    \ occurrences of the Extended\n   Community MUST be ignored.  When propagating\
    \ the UPDATE, all\n   instances of the Extended Community other than the first\
    \ SHOULD be\n   removed.\n   Suppose a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE message\
    \ that contains a\n   \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute, but does not contain an \"Additional\
    \ PMSI\n   Tunnel Attribute Flags\" Extended Community.  If the \"Extension\"\
    \ flag\n   of the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute is set, the UPDATE is considered to\
    \ be\n   malformed, and the \"treat-as-withdraw\" procedure of [RFC7606] MUST\
    \ be\n   applied.\n   If a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE message that contains\
    \ one or more\n   \"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\" Extended Communities,\
    \ but\n   either (a) that UPDATE message does not contain a \"PMSI Tunnel\"\n\
    \   attribute, or (b) the \"Extension\" flag of the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute\n\
    \   is not set, then the Extended Community(ies) SHOULD be removed and\n   SHOULD\
    \ NOT be redistributed.  The BGP UPDATE message MUST be\n   processed (and if\
    \ necessary, redistributed) as if the Extended\n   Community(ies) had not been\
    \ present.\n   A BGP speaker that supports the current document, but does not\n\
    \   recognize a particular flag (either in the\" PMSI Tunnel\" attribute\n   \"\
    Flags\" field or in the \"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\"\n   Extended\
    \ Community) MUST simply ignore that flag.  If the BGP speaker\n   propagates\
    \ either the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute, the \"Additional PMSI\n   Tunnel Attribute\
    \ Flags\" Extended Community, or both along with the\n   UPDATE message, it SHOULD\
    \ leave the setting of the flag unchanged.\n   It is possible that a particular\
    \ application will require all members\n   of a particular set of BGP speakers\
    \ to support a particular flag.\n   How it is determined whether all such BGP\
    \ speakers support that flag\n   is outside the scope of this document.\n   In\
    \ some situations, a BGP speaker may need to modify or replace the\n   \"PMSI\
    \ Tunnel\" attribute before propagating an UPDATE.  If the\n   \"Extension\" flag\
    \ of the \"PMSI Tunnel\" attribute was set before the\n   attribute is modified\
    \ or replaced, but that flag is no longer set\n   after the attribute is modified\
    \ or replaced, any \"Additional PMSI\n   Tunnel Attribute Flags\" Extended Communities\
    \ MUST be removed before\n   the UPDATE is propagated.  If the \"PMSI Tunnel\"\
    \ attribute is removed\n   entirely before an UPDATE is propagated, the \"Additional\
    \ PMSI Tunnel\n   Attribute Flags\" Extended Communities (if any) MUST also be\
    \ removed.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created a new registry called \"P-Multicast\
