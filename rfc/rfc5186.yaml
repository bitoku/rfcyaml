  - "Abstract\n   The definitions of the Internet Group Management Protocol Version\
    \ 3\n   (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) require\n\
    \   new behavior within the multicast routing protocols.  The additional\n   source\
    \ information contained in IGMPv3 and MLDv2 messages\n   necessitates that multicast\
    \ routing protocols manage and utilize the\n   information.  This document describes\
    \ how multicast routing protocols\n   will interact with these source-filtering\
    \ group management protocols.\n"

- title: 2.  Multicast Forwarding State
  contents:
  - "2.  Multicast Forwarding State\n   Existing multicast routing protocols utilize\
    \ the group management\n   database in determining if local members exist for\
    \ a particular\n   multicast group.  With previous group management protocols,\
    \ this\n   database had one type of record indicating the group for which there\n\
    \   was interest and the associated local interfaces.\n   In the case of IGMPv3\
    \ and MLDv2, these routing protocols may now\n   build multicast forwarding state\
    \ based on the source filter\n   information available for each multicast group\
    \ that has local\n   membership.  This requires that the group management database\
    \ have\n   four record types.  Only one record may exist for a given interface\n\
    \   and a given multicast group.\n      1. EXCLUDE <>\n         The EXCLUDE <>\
    \ record indicates interest in all sources\n         destined to this group address\
    \ for a set of local interfaces.\n         It is equivalent to the single record\
    \ type existing in previous\n         versions of the group management protocols.\n\
    \      2. INCLUDE <>\n         The INCLUDE <> record indicates that there is no\
    \ interest in\n         any sources destined to this group address for a set of\
    \ local\n         interfaces.\n      3. EXCLUDE <list>\n         The EXCLUDE <list>\
    \ record indicates that there is interest in\n         all sources other than\
    \ the specifically listed sources for a\n         set of local interfaces.\n \
    \     4. INCLUDE <list>\n         The INCLUDE <list> record indicates that there\
    \ is interest in\n         only the specifically listed sources for a set of local\n\
    \         interfaces.\n   The records in the group management database should\
    \ be utilized when\n   generating forwarding state for a multicast group.  If\
    \ the source\n   address in the multicast packet exists in the database for the\n\
    \   specified multicast group and is in an INCLUDE list or is not listed\n   in\
    \ an EXCLUDE list, the multicast routing protocol should add the\n   interface\
    \ to the list of downstream interfaces; otherwise, it should\n   not be added\
    \ based on local group membership.\n"
- title: 3.  DVMRP Interaction
  contents:
  - "3.  DVMRP Interaction\n   The Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)\
    \ [DVMRP] does\n   not incorporate any knowledge of the multicast group's senders.\n\
    \   Therefore, DVMRP will act only on the multicast group address\n   contained\
    \ in an IGMPv3 or MLDv2 report.\n   Future standardized versions of DVMRP may\
    \ incorporate pruning and\n   grafting messages similar to PIM-DM (discussed in\
    \ Section 5).  The\n   rules defined in Section 5 can be applied in this situation.\n"
- title: 4.  MOSPF Interaction
  contents:
  - "4.  MOSPF Interaction\n   In Multicast Extensions to OSPF (MOSPF) [MOSPF], the\
    \ consideration of\n   source filter information in the group management database\
    \ is limited\n   to the building of forwarding state (discussed above).  This\
    \ is due\n   to the flooding of group-membership-LSAs within MOSPF.\n"
- title: 5.  PIM-DM Interaction
  contents:
  - "5.  PIM-DM Interaction\n   The PIM-DM protocol [PIMDM] interaction with a source-filtering\
    \ group\n   management protocol is important in two areas: multicast distribution\n\
    \   tree pruning and multicast distribution tree grafting.  The following\n  \
    \ sections will describe the behavior needed in PIM-DM to interoperate\n   with\
    \ IGMPv3 and MLDv2.\n"
- title: 5.1.  PIM-DM Prunes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  PIM-DM Prunes\n   PIM-DM prune messages are initiated when a PIM-DM router\
    \ determines\n   that there are no entities interested in the data flowing on\
    \ the\n   (S,G) forwarding state.  If the multicast router is running IGMPv3 or\n\
    \   MLDv2, this is determined by the source S being in EXCLUDE state in\n   the\
    \ source filter for the destination G, or all interest in G being\n   terminated\
    \ for an existing (S,G) forwarding entry.\n"
- title: 5.2.  PIM-DM Grafts
  contents:
  - "5.2.  PIM-DM Grafts\n   PIM-DM graft messages are sent in order to override an\
    \ existing PIM-\n   DM prune.  In the case of IGMPv3 or MLDv2, this occurs when\
    \ prune\n   state exists for (S,G) and a state change occurs in which the source\n\
    \   filter state for S changes to INCLUDE for the specified G.\n"
- title: 6.  PIM-SM Interaction
  contents:
  - "6.  PIM-SM Interaction\n   A PIM-SM interaction takes place when a PM-SM [PIMSM]\
    \ router receives\n   an IGMP or MLD message regarding a group address that is\
    \ in the Any\n   Source Multicast (ASM) range.  This range is defined as the entire\n\
    \   multicast address space excluding the global SSM range [SSM] and any\n   locally\
    \ defined Source Specific space.\n"
- title: 6.1.  PIM-SM Joins (ASM Behavior)
  contents:
  - "6.1.  PIM-SM Joins (ASM Behavior)\n   PIM-SM join messages are initiated when\
    \ a PIM-SM router determines\n   that there are entities interested in a specific\
    \ group or a specific\n   source sending to the group.  If this is due to an IGMPv3\
    \ or MLDv2\n   report with a zero-length EXCLUDE list, then the join is sent as\
    \ a\n   (*,G) join towards the RP.\n   If the join is triggered by an IGMPv3 or\
    \ MLDv2 state change that\n   affects source information, the PIM-SM join is sent\
    \ as a (S,G) join\n   towards the specific source.  This behavior optimizes the\
    \ join\n   process, as well as facilitates the adoption of the SSM model.  The\n\
    \   generation of this (S,G) join can cause failures in architectures\n   where\
    \ leaf routers do not have global reachability, and thus, can be\n   overridden\
    \ by local policy.  If this is the case, then all triggered\n   joins are sent\
    \ towards the RP as (*,G) joins.  The router sending the\n   (*,G) join is responsible\
    \ for filtering the data as per the IGMPv3\n   database before forwarding.\n"
- title: 6.2.  PIM-SM Prunes (ASM Behavior)
  contents:
  - "6.2.  PIM-SM Prunes (ASM Behavior)\n   PIM-SM prune messages are initiated when\
    \ a PIM-SM router determines\n   that there are no entities interested in a specific\
    \ group, or a\n   specific source sending to the group.  If this is triggered\
    \ by either\n   receiving a report with an EXCLUDE or if a specific Source/Group\n\
    \   times out, then an (S,G) prune is sent towards the upstream router.\n   If\
    \ all of the IGMPv3 or MLDv2 derived requests for a group time out,\n   then (S,G)\
    \ and (*,G) prunes are sent upstream as needed to stop all\n   flow of traffic\
    \ for that group.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  PIM-SSM Interaction\n   A PIM-SSM interaction takes place when a PIM-SM router\
    \ receives an\n   IGMPv3 or MLDv2 message regarding a group address that is in\
