  - "2.  SONET and SDH Traffic Parameters\n   This section defines the GMPLS traffic\
    \ parameters for SONET/SDH.  The\n   protocol specific formats, for the SONET/SDH-specific\
    \ RSVP-TE objects\n   and CR-LDP TLVs are described in sections 2.2 and 2.3 respectively.\n\
    \   These traffic parameters specify indeed a base set of capabilities\n   for\
    \ SONET ANSI [T1.105] and SDH ITU-T [G.707] such as concatenation\n   and transparency.\
    \  Other documents may further enhance this set of\n   capabilities in the future.\
    \  For instance, signaling for SDH over PDH\n   ITU-T G.832 or sub-STM-0 ITU-T\
    \ G.708 interfaces could be defined.\n   The traffic parameters defined hereafter\
    \ (see Section 2.1) MUST be\n   used when the label is encoded as SUKLM as defined\
    \ in this memo (see\n   Section 3).  They MUST also be used when requesting one\
    \ of Section/RS\n   or Line/MS overhead transparent STS-1/STM-0, STS-3*N/STM-N\
    \ (N=1, 4,\n   16, 64, 256) signals.\n   The traffic parameters and label encoding\
    \ defined in [RFC3471],\n   Section 3.2, MUST be used for fully transparent STS-1/STM-0,\n\
    \   STS-3*N/STM-N (N=1, 4, 16, 64, 256) signal requests.  A fully\n   transparent\
    \ signal is one for which all overhead is left unmodified\n   by intermediate\
    \ nodes, i.e., when all defined Transparency (T) bits\n   would be set if the\
    \ traffic parameters defined in section 2.1 were\n   used.\n"

    \   Annex 1 lists examples of SONET and SDH signal coding.\n   Signal Type (ST):\
    \ 8 bits\n   This field indicates the type of Elementary Signal that comprises\
    \ the\n   requested LSP.  Several transforms can be applied successively on the\n\
    \   Elementary Signal to build the Final Signal being actually requested\n   for\
    \ the LSP.\n   Each transform application is optional and must be ignored if zero,\n\
    \   except the Multiplier (MT) that cannot be zero and is ignored if\n   equal\
    \ to one.\n   Transforms must be applied strictly in the following order:\n  \
    \ -  First, contiguous concatenation (by using the RCC and NCC fields)\n     \
    \ can be optionally applied on the Elementary Signal, resulting in a\n      contiguously\
    \ concatenated signal.\n   -  Second, virtual concatenation (by using the NVC\
    \ field) can be\n      optionally applied on the Elementary Signal resulting in\
    \ a\n      virtually concatenated signal.\n   -  Third, some transparency (by\
    \ using the Transparency field) can be\n      optionally specified when requesting\
    \ a frame as signal rather than\n      an SPE or VC based signal.\n   -  Fourth,\
    \ a multiplication (by using the Multiplier field) can be\n      optionally applied\
    \ either directly on the Elementary Signal, or on\n      the contiguously concatenated\
    \ signal obtained from the first\n      phase, or on the virtually concatenated\
    \ signal obtained from the\n      second phase, or on these signals combined with\
    \ some transparency.\n   Permitted Signal Type values for SONET/SDH are:\n   Value\
    \  Type (Elementary Signal)\n   -----  ------------------------\n    1     VT1.5\
    \  SPE / VC-11\n    2     VT2    SPE / VC-12\n    3     VT3    SPE\n    4    \

    \    7     STS-1      / STM-0   (only when requesting transparency)\n    8   \
    \  STS-3      / STM-1   (only when requesting transparency)\n    9     STS-12\
    \     / STM-4   (only when requesting transparency)\n    10    STS-48     / STM-16\
    \  (only when requesting transparency)\n    11    STS-192    / STM-64  (only when\
    \ requesting transparency)\n    12    STS-768    / STM-256 (only when requesting\
    \ transparency)\n   A dedicated signal type is assigned to a SONET STS-3c SPE\
    \ instead of\n   coding it as a contiguous concatenation of three STS-1 SPEs.\
    \  This is\n   done in order to provide easy interworking between SONET and SDH\n\
    \   signaling.\n   Appendix 1 adds one signal type (optional) to the above values.\n\
    \   Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC): 8 bits\n   This field is used to\
    \ request the optional SONET/SDH contiguous\n   concatenation of the Elementary\
    \ Signal.\n   This field is a vector of flags.  Each flag indicates the support\
    \ of\n   a particular type of contiguous concatenation.  Several flags can be\n\
    \   set at the same time to indicate a choice.\n   These flags allow an upstream\
    \ node to indicate to a downstream node\n   the different types of contiguous\
    \ concatenation that it supports.\n   However, the downstream node decides which\
    \ one to use according to\n   its own rules.\n   A downstream node receiving simultaneously\
    \ more than one flag chooses\n   a particular type of contiguous concatenation,\
    \ if any supported, and\n   based on criteria that are out of this document scope.\
    \  A downstream\n   node that doesn't support any of the concatenation types indicated\
    \ by\n   the field must refuse the LSP request.  In particular, it must refuse\n\
    \   the LSP request if it doesn't support contiguous concatenation at\n   all.\n\
    \   When several flags have been set, the upstream node retrieves the\n   (single)\
    \ type of contiguous concatenation the downstream node has\n   selected by looking\
    \ at the position indicated by the first label and\n   the number of label(s)\
    \ as returned by the downstream node (see also\n   Section 3).\n   The entire\
    \ field is set to zero to indicate that no contiguous\n   concatenation is requested\
    \ at all (default value).  A non-zero field\n   indicates that some contiguous\
    \ concatenation is requested.\n   The following flag is defined:\n      Flag 1\
    \ (bit 1): Standard contiguous concatenation.\n   Flag 1 indicates that the standard\
    \ SONET/SDH contiguous concatenation\n   as defined in [T1.105]/[G.707] is supported.\
    \  Note that bit 1 is the\n   low order bit.  Other flags are reserved for extensions,\
    \ if not used\n   they must be set to zero when sent, and should be ignored when\n\
    \   received.\n   See note 1 hereafter in the section on the NCC about the SONET\n\
    \   contiguous concatenation of STS-1 SPEs when the number of components\n   is\
    \ a multiple of three.\n      Number of Contiguous Components (NCC): 16 bits\n\
    \   This field indicates the number of identical SONET SPEs/SDH VCs\n   (i.e.,\
    \ Elementary Signal) that are requested to be concatenated, as\n   specified in\
    \ the RCC field.\n   Note 1: when requesting a SONET STS-Nc SPE with N=3*X, the\n\
    \      Elementary Signal to use must always be an STS-3c_SPE signal type\n   \
    \   and the value of NCC must always be equal to X.  This allows also\n      facilitating\
    \ the interworking between SONET and SDH.  In\n      particular, it means that\
    \ the contiguous concatenation of three\n      STS-1 SPEs can not be requested\
    \ because according to this\n      specification, this type of signal must be\
    \ coded using the STS-3c\n      SPE signal type.\n   Note 2: when requesting a\
    \ transparent STS-N/STM-N signal\n      limited to a single contiguously concatenated\
    \ STS-Nc_SPE/VC-4-Nc,\n      the signal type must be STS-N/STM-N, RCC with flag\
    \ 1 and NCC set\n      to 1.\n   The NCC value must be consistent with the type\
    \ of contiguous\n   concatenation being requested in the RCC field.  In particular,\
    \ this\n   field is irrelevant if no contiguous concatenation is requested (RCC\n\
    \   = 0), in that case it must be set to zero when sent, and should be\n   ignored\
    \ when received.  A RCC value different from 0 must imply a\n   number of contiguous\
    \ components greater than 1.\n      Number of Virtual Components (NVC): 16 bits\n\
    \   This field indicates the number of signals that are requested to be\n   virtually\
    \ concatenated.  These signals are all of the same type by\n   definition.  They\
    \ are Elementary Signal SPEs/VCs for which signal\n   types are defined in this\
    \ document, i.e., VT1.5_SPE/VC-11,\n   VT2_SPE/VC-12, VT3_SPE, VT6_SPE/VC-2, STS-1_SPE/VC-3\
    \ or\n   STS-3c_SPE/VC-4.\n   This field is set to 0 (default value) to indicate\
    \ that no virtual\n   concatenation is requested.\n      Multiplier (MT): 16 bits\n\
    \   This field indicates the number of identical signals that are\n   requested\
    \ for the LSP, i.e., that form the Final Signal.  These\n   signals can be either\
    \ identical Elementary Signals, or identical\n   contiguously concatenated signals,\
    \ or identical virtually\n   concatenated signals.  Note that all these signals\
    \ belong thus to the\n   same LSP.\n   The distinction between the components\
    \ of multiple virtually\n   concatenated signals is done via the order of the\
    \ labels that are\n   specified in the signaling.  The first set of labels must\
    \ describe\n   the first component (set of individual signals belonging to the\
    \ first\n   virtual concatenated signal), the second set must describe the second\n\
    \   component (set of individual signals belonging to the second virtual\n   concatenated\
    \ signal) and so on.\n   This field is set to one (default value) to indicate\
    \ that exactly one\n   instance of a signal is being requested.  Intermediate\
    \ and egress\n   nodes MUST verify that the node itself and the interfaces on\
    \ which\n   the LSP will be established can support the requested multiplier\n\
    \   value.  If the requested values can not be supported, the receiver\n   node\
    \ MUST generate a PathErr/NOTIFICATION message (see Section\n   2.2/2.3, respectively).\n\
    \   Zero is an invalid value.  If received, the node MUST generate a\n   PathErr/NOTIFICATION\
    \ message (see Section 2.2/2.3, respectively).\n   Note 1: when requesting a transparent\
    \ STS-N/STM-N signal limited to a\n   single contiguously concatenated STS-Nc-SPE/VC-4-Nc,\
    \ the multiplier\n   field MUST be equal to 1 (only valid value).\n      Transparency\
    \ (T): 32 bits\n   This field is a vector of flags that indicates the type of\n\
    \   transparency being requested.  Several flags can be combined to\n   provide\
    \ different types of transparency.  Not all combinations are\n   necessarily valid.\
    \  The default value for this field is zero, i.e.,\n   no transparency requested.\n\
    \   Transparency, as defined from the point of view of this signaling\n   specification,\
    \ is only applicable to the fields in the SONET/SDH\n   frame overheads.  In the\
    \ SONET case, these are the fields in the\n   Section Overhead (SOH), and the\
    \ Line Overhead (LOH).  In the SDH\n   case, these are the fields in the Regenerator\
    \ Section Overhead\n   (RSOH), the Multiplex Section overhead (MSOH), and the\
    \ pointer fields\n   between the two.  With SONET, the pointer fields are part\
    \ of the LOH.\n   Note as well that transparency is only applicable when using\
    \ the\n   following Signal Types: STS-1/STM-0, STS-3/STM-1, STS-12/STM-4,\n  \
    \ STS-48/STM-16, STS-192/STM-64 and STS-768/STM-256.  At least one\n   transparency\
    \ type must be specified when requesting such a signal\n   type.\n   Transparency\
    \ indicates precisely which fields in these overheads must\n   be delivered unmodified\
    \ at the other end of the LSP.  An ingress LSR\n   requesting transparency will\
    \ pass these overhead fields that must be\n   delivered to the egress LSR without\
    \ any change.  From the ingress and\n   egress LSRs point of views, these fields\
    \ must be seen as unmodified.\n   Transparency is not applied at the interfaces\
    \ with the initiating and\n   terminating LSRs, but is only applied between intermediate\
    \ LSRs.\n   The transparency field is used to request an LSP that supports the\n\
    \   requested transparency type; it may also be used to setup the\n   transparency\
    \ process to be applied at each intermediate LSR.\n   The different transparency\
    \ flags are the following:\n      Flag 1 (bit 1): Section/Regenerator Section\
    \ layer.\n      Flag 2 (bit 2): Line/Multiplex Section layer.\n   Where bit 1\
    \ is the low order bit.  Other flags are reserved, they\n   should be set to zero\
    \ when sent, and should be ignored when received.\n   A flag is set to one to\
    \ indicate that the corresponding transparency\n   is requested.\n   Intermediate\
    \ and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and\n   the interfaces on\
    \ which the LSP will be established can support the\n   requested transparency.\
    \  If the requested flags can not be supported,\n   the receiver node MUST generate\
    \ a PathErr/NOTIFICATION message (see\n   Section 2.2/2.3, respectively).\n  \
    \ Section/Regenerator Section layer transparency means that the entire\n   frames\
    \ must be delivered unmodified.  This implies that pointers\n   cannot be adjusted.\
    \  When using Section/Regenerator Section layer\n   transparency all other flags\
    \ MUST be ignored.\n   Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency means that the\
    \ LOH/MSOH\n   must be delivered unmodified.  This implies that pointers cannot\
    \ be\n   adjusted.\n   Profile (P): 32 bits\n   This field is intended to indicate\
    \ particular capabilities that must\n   be supported for the LSP, for example\
    \ monitoring capabilities.\n   No standard profile is currently defined and this\
    \ field SHOULD be set\n   to zero when transmitted and SHOULD be ignored when\
    \ received.\n   In the future TLV based extensions may be created.\n"

- title: 3.  SONET and SDH Labels
  contents:
  - "3.  SONET and SDH Labels\n   SONET and SDH each define a multiplexing structure.\
    \  Both structures\n   are trees whose roots are respectively an STS-N or an STM-N;\
    \ and\n   whose leaves are the signals that can be transported via the time-\n\
    \   slots and switched between time-slots within an ingress port and\n   time-slots\
    \ within an egress port, i.e., a VTx SPE, an STS-x SPE or a\n   VC-x.  A SONET/SDH\
    \ label will identify the exact position (i.e.,\n   first time-slot) of a particular\
    \ VTx SPE, STS-x SPE or VC-x signal in\n   a multiplexing structure.  SONET and\
    \ SDH labels are carried in the\n   Generalized Label per [RFC3473] and [RFC3472].\n\
    \   Note that by time-slots we mean the time-slots as they appear\n   logically\
    \ and sequentially in the multiplex, not as they appear after\n   any possible\
    \ interleaving.\n   These multiplexing structures will be used as naming trees\
    \ to create\n   unique multiplex entry names or labels.  The same format of label\
    \ is\n   used for SONET and SDH.  As explained in [RFC3471], a label does not\n\
    \   identify the \"class\" to which the label belongs.  This is implicitly\n \
    \  determined by the link on which the label is used.\n   In case of signal concatenation\
    \ or multiplication, a list of labels\n   can appear in the Label field of a Generalized\
    \ Label.\n   In case of contiguous concatenation, only one label appears in the\n\
    \   Label field.  This label identifies the lowest time-slot occupied by\n   the\
    \ contiguously concatenated signal.  By lowest time-slot we mean\n   the one having\
    \ the lowest label (value) when compared as integer\n   values, i.e., the time-slot\
    \ occupied by the first component signal of\n   the concatenated signal encountered\
    \ when descending the tree.\n   In case of virtual concatenation, the explicit\
    \ ordered list of all\n   labels in the concatenation is given.  Each label indicates\
    \ the first\n   time-slot occupied by a component of the virtually concatenated\n\
    \   signal.  The order of the labels must reflect the order of the\n   payloads\
    \ to concatenate (not the physical order of time-slots).  The\n   above representation\
    \ limits virtual concatenation to remain within a\n   single (component) link;\
    \ it imposes as such a restriction compared to\n   the ANSI [T1.105]/ITU-T [G.707]\
    \ recommendations.\n   The standard definition for virtual concatenation allows\
    \ each virtual\n   concatenation components to travel over diverse paths.  Within\
    \ GMPLS,\n   virtual concatenation components must travel over the same\n   (component)\
    \ link if they are part of the same LSP.  This is due to\n   the way that labels\
    \ are bound to a (component) link.  Note however,\n   that the routing of components\
    \ on different paths is indeed\n   equivalent to establishing different LSPs,\
    \ each one having its own\n   route.  Several LSPs can be initiated and terminated\
    \ between the same\n   nodes and their corresponding components can then be associated\n\
    \   together (i.e., virtually concatenated).\n   In case of multiplication (i.e.,\
    \ using the multiplier transform), the\n   explicit ordered list of all labels\
    \ that take part in the Final\n   Signal is given.  In case of multiplication\
    \ of virtually concatenated\n   signals, the first set of labels indicates the\
    \ time-slots occupied by\n   the first virtually concatenated signal, the second\
    \ set of labels\n   indicates the time-slots occupied by the second virtually\n\
    \   concatenated signal, and so on.  The above representation limits\n   multiplication\
    \ to remain within a single (component) link.\n   The format of the label for\
    \ SONET and/or SDH TDM-LSR link is:\n    0                   1               \

    \   This is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in [G.707]\n   sections\
    \ 7.3.7 to 7.3.13, i.e., the (K, L, M) numbering.  Note that\n   the higher order\
    \ numbering scheme defined in [G.707] sections 7.3.1\n   to 7.3.6 is not used\
    \ here.\n   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting at the parent\n\
    \   node in the multiplex structure.  Branches are considered as numbered\n  \
    \ in increasing order, starting from the top of the multiplexing\n   structure.\
    \  The numbering starts at 1, zero is used to indicate a\n   non-significant or\
    \ ignored field.\n   When a field is not significant or ignored in a particular\
    \ context it\n   MUST be set to zero when transmitted, and MUST be ignored when\n\
    \   received.\n   When a hierarchy of SONET/SDH LSPs is used, a higher order LSP\
    \ with a\n   given bandwidth can be used to carry lower order LSPs.  Remember\
    \ here\n   that a higher order LSP is established through a SONET/SDH higher\n\
    \   order path layer network and a lower order LSP, through a SONET/SDH\n   lower\
    \ order path layer network (see also ITU-T G.803, Section 3 for\n   the corresponding\
    \ definitions).  In this context, the higher order\n   SONET/SDH LSP behaves as\
    \ a \"virtual link\" with a given bandwidth\n   (e.g., VC-3), it may also be used\
    \ as a Forwarding Adjacency.  A lower\n   order SONET/SDH LSP can be established\
    \ through that higher order LSP.\n   Since a label is local to a (virtual) link,\
    \ the highest part of that\n   label (i.e., the S, U and K fields) is non-significant\
    \ and is set to\n   zero, i.e., the label is \"0,0,0,L,M\".  Similarly, if the\
    \ structure of\n   the lower order LSP is unknown or not relevant, the lowest\
    \ part of\n   that label (i.e., the L and M fields) is non-significant and is\
    \ set\n   to zero, i.e., the label is \"S,U,K,0,0\".\n   For instance, a VC-3\
    \ LSP can be used to carry lower order LSPs.  In\n   that case the labels allocated\
    \ between the two ends of the VC-3 LSP\n   for the lower order LSPs will have\
    \ S, U and K set to zero, i.e.,\n   non-significant, while L and M will be used\
    \ to indicate the signal\n   allocated in that VC-3.\n   In case of tunneling\
    \ such as VC-4 containing VC-3 containing\n   VC-12/VC-11 where the SUKLM structure\
    \ is not adequate to represent\n   the full signal structure, a hierarchical approach\
    \ must be used,\n   i.e., per layer network signaling.\n   The possible values\
    \ of S, U, K, L and M are defined as follows:\n   1. S=1->N is the index of a\
    \ particular STS-3/AUG-1 inside an\n      STS-N/STM-N multiplex.  S is only significant\
    \ for SONET STS-N\n      (N>1) and SDH STM-N (N>0).  S must be 0 and ignored for\
    \ STS-1 and\n      STM-0.\n   2. U=1->3 is the index of a particular STS-1_SPE/VC-3\
    \ within an\n      STS-3/AUG-1.  U is only significant for SONET STS-N (N>1) and\
    \ SDH\n      STM-N (N>0).  U must be 0 and ignored for STS-1 and STM-0.\n   3.\
    \ K=1->3 is the index of a particular TUG-3 within a VC-4.  K is\n      only significant\
    \ for an SDH VC-4 structured in TUG-3s.  K must be\n      0 and ignored in all\
    \ other cases.\n   4. L=1->7 is the index of a particular VT_Group/TUG-2 within\
    \ an\n      STS-1_SPE/TUG-3 or VC-3.  L must be 0 and ignored in all other\n \
    \     cases.\n   5. M is the index of a particular VT1.5_SPE/VC-11, VT2_SPE/VC-12\
    \ or\n      VT3_SPE within a VT_Group/TUG-2.  M=1->2 indicates a specific VT3\n\
    \      SPE inside the corresponding VT Group, these values MUST NOT be\n     \
    \ used for SDH since there is no equivalent of VT3 with SDH.  M=3->5\n      indicates\
    \ a specific VT2_SPE/VC-12 inside the corresponding\n      VT_Group/TUG-2.  M=6->9\
    \ indicates a specific VT1.5_SPE/VC-11\n      inside the corresponding VT_Group/TUG-2.\n\
    \   Note that a label always has to be interpreted according the\n   SONET/SDH\
    \ traffic parameters, i.e., a label by itself does not allow\n   knowing which\
    \ signal is being requested (a label is context\n   sensitive).\n   The label\
    \ format defined in this section, referred to as SUKLM, MUST\n   be used for any\
    \ SONET/SDH signal requests that are not transparent\n   i.e., when all Transparency\
    \ (T) bits defined in section 2.1 are set\n   to zero.  Any transparent STS-1/STM-0/STS-3*N/STM-N\
    \ (N=1, 4, 16, 64,\n   256) signal request MUST use a label format as defined\
    \ in [RFC3471].\n   The S encoding is summarized in the following table:\n   \

    \ a VC-3 forwarding adjacency). This LSR could then want\n   to demultiplex this\
    \ VC-3 and switch internal low order LSPs. For\n   implementation reasons, this\
    \ could be only possible if the LSR\n   receives the VC-3 in the AU-3 branch.\
    \  E.g., for an LSR not able to\n   switch internally from a TU-3 branch to an\
    \ AU-3 branch on its\n   incoming interface before demultiplexing and then switching\
    \ the\n   content with its switch fabric.\n   In that case it is useful to indicate\
    \ that the VC-3 LSP must be\n   terminated at the end in the AU-3 branch instead\
    \ of the TU-3 branch.\n   This is achieved by using the \"VC-3 via AU-3 at the\
    \ end\" signal type.\n   This information can be used, for instance, by the penultimate\
    \ LSR to\n   switch an incoming VC-3 received in any branch to the AU-3 branch\
    \ on\n   the outgoing interface to the destination LSR.\n   The \"VC-3 via AU-3\
    \ at the end\" signal type does not imply that the\n   VC-3 must be switched via\
    \ the AU-3 branch at some other places in the\n   network. The VC-3 signal type\
    \ just indicates that a VC-3 in any\n   branch is suitable.\n"

  - "Annex 1 - Examples\n   This annex defines examples of SONET and SDH signal coding.\
    \ Their\n   objective is to help the reader to understand how works the traffic\n\
    \   parameter coding and not to give examples of typical SONET or SDH\n   signals.\n\
    \   As stated above, signal types are Elementary Signals to which\n   successive\
    \ concatenation, multiplication and transparency transforms\n   can be applied\
    \ to obtain Final Signals.\n   1.   A VC-4 signal is formed by the application\
    \ of RCC with value 0,\n        NCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, MT with value\
    \ 1 and T with\n        value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary Signal.\n   2.   A VC-4-7v\
    \ signal is formed by the application of RCC with value\n        0, NCC with value\
    \ 0, NVC with value 7 (virtual concatenation of\n        7 components), MT with\
    \ value 1 and T with value 0 to a VC-4\n        Elementary Signal.\n   3.   A\
    \ VC-4-16c signal is formed by the application of RCC with flag\n        1 (standard\
    \ contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 16, NVC\n        with value 0, MT\
    \ with value 1 and T with value 0 to a VC-4\n        Elementary Signal.\n   4.\
    \   An STM-16 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is\n        formed\
    \ by the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0,\n        NVC with\
    \ value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 2 to an STM-16\n        Elementary\
    \ Signal.\n   5.   An STM-4 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is\n\
    \        formed by the application of RCC with flag 0, NCC with value 0,\n   \
    \     NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 2 applied to\n       \
    \ an STM-4 Elementary Signal.\n   6.   An STM-256 signal with Multiplex Section\
    \ layer transparency is\n        formed by the application of RCC with flag 0,\
    \ NCC with value 0,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag\
    \ 2 applied to\n        an STM-256 Elementary Signal.\n   7.   An STS-1 SPE signal\
    \ is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 0, NCC with value 0,\
    \ NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and\n        T with value 0 to an STS-1 SPE\
    \ Elementary Signal.\n   8.   An STS-3c SPE signal is formed by the application\
    \ of RCC with\n        value 1 (standard contiguous concatenation), NCC with value\
    \ 1,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to an STS-\n\
    \        3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   9.   An STS-48c SPE signal is formed by\
    \ the application of RCC with\n        flag 1 (standard contiguous concatenation),\
    \ NCC with value 16,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value\
    \ 0 to an STS-\n        3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   10.  An STS-1-3v SPE signal\
    \ is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 0, NVC with value 3\
    \ (virtual concatenation of 3\n        components), MT with value 1 and T with\
    \ value 0 to an STS-1 SPE\n        Elementary Signal.\n   11.  An STS-3c-9v SPE\
    \ signal is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 1, NCC with value\
    \ 1, NVC with value 9 (virtual\n        concatenation of 9 STS-3c), MT with value\
    \ 1 and T with value 0\n        to an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   12.  An\
    \ STS-12 signal with Section layer (full) transparency is\n        formed by the\
    \ application of RCC with value 0, NVC with value 0,\n        MT with value 1\
    \ and T with flag 1 to an STS-12 Elementary\n        Signal.\n   13.  3 x STS-768c\
    \ SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with\n        flag 1, NCC with\
    \ value 256, NVC with value 0, MT with value 3,\n        and T with value 0 to\
    \ an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   14.  5 x VC-4-13v composed signal is formed\
    \ by the application of RCC\n        with value 0, NVC with value 13, MT with\
    \ value 5 and T with\n        value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary Signal.\n   The encoding\
