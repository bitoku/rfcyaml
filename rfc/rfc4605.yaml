    \ infrastructure.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   In a simple tree topology, it is not necessary to run a\
    \ multicast\n   routing protocol.  It is sufficient to learn and proxy group\n\
    \   membership information and simply forward multicast packets based\n   upon\
    \ that information.  One typical example of such a tree topology\n   can be found\
    \ on an edge aggregation box such as a Digital Subscriber\n   Line Access Multiplexer\
    \ (DSLAM).  In most deployment scenarios, an\n   edge box has only one connection\
    \ to the core network side and has\n   many connections to the customer side.\n\
    \   Using IGMP/MLD-based forwarding to replicate multicast traffic on\n   devices\
    \ such as the edge boxes can greatly simplify the design and\n   implementation\
    \ of those devices.  By not supporting more complicated\n   multicast routing\
    \ protocols such as Protocol Independent Multicast\n   (PIM) or Distance Vector\
    \ Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP), it\n   reduces not only the cost of the\
    \ devices but also the operational\n   overhead.  Another advantage is that it\
    \ makes the proxy devices\n   independent of the multicast routing protocol used\
    \ by the core\n   network routers.  Hence, proxy devices can be easily deployed\
    \ in any\n   multicast network.\n   Robustness in an edge box is usually achieved\
    \ by using a hot spare\n   connection to the core network.  When the first connection\
    \ fails, the\n   edge box fails over to the second connection.  IGMP/MLD-based\n\
    \   forwarding can benefit from such a mechanism and use the spare\n   connection\
    \ for its redundant or backup connection to multicast\n   routers.  When an edge\
    \ box fails over to the second connection, the\n   proxy upstream connection can\
    \ also be updated to the new connection.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applicability Statement\n   The IGMP/MLD-based forwarding only works in\
    \ a simple tree topology.\n   The tree must be manually configured by designating\
    \ upstream and\n   downstream interfaces on each proxy device.  In addition, the\
    \ IP\n   addressing scheme applied to the proxying tree topology SHOULD be\n \
    \  configured to ensure that a proxy device can win the IGMP/MLD Querier\n   election\
    \ to be able to forward multicast traffic.  There are no other\n   multicast routers\
    \ except the proxy devices within the tree, and the\n   root of the tree is expected\
    \ to be connected to a wider multicast\n   infrastructure.  This protocol is limited\
    \ to a single administrative\n   domain.\n   In more complicated scenarios where\
    \ the topology is not a tree, a\n   more robust failover mechanism is desired,\
    \ or more than one\n   administrative domain is involved, a multicast routing\
    \ protocol\n   should be used.\n"

- title: 3.  Abstract Protocol Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  Abstract Protocol Definition\n   A proxy device performing IGMP/MLD-based\
    \ forwarding has a single\n   upstream interface and one or more downstream interfaces.\
    \  These\n   designations are explicitly configured; there is no protocol to\n\
    \   determine what type each interface is.  It performs the router\n   portion\
    \ of the IGMP [RFC1112, RFC2236, RFC3376] or MLD [RFC2710,\n   MLDv2] protocol\
    \ on its downstream interfaces, and the host portion of\n   IGMP/MLD on its upstream\
    \ interface.  The proxy device MUST NOT\n   perform the router portion of IGMP/MLD\
    \ on its upstream interface.\n   The proxy device maintains a database consisting\
    \ of the merger of all\n   subscriptions on any downstream interface.  Refer to\
    \ Section 4 for\n   the details about the construction and maintenance of the\
    \ membership\n   database.\n   The proxy device sends IGMP/MLD membership reports\
    \ on the upstream\n   interface when queried and sends unsolicited reports or\
    \ leaves when\n   the database changes.\n   When the proxy device receives a packet\
    \ destined for a multicast\n   group (channel in Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)),\
    \ it uses a list\n   consisting of the upstream interface and any downstream interface\n\
    \   that has a subscription pertaining to this packet and on which it is\n   the\
    \ IGMP/MLD Querier.  This list may be built dynamically or cached.\n   It removes\
    \ the interface on which this packet arrived from the list\n   and forwards the\
    \ packet to the remaining interfaces (this may include\n   the upstream interface).\n\
    \   Note that the rule that a proxy device must be the querier in order\n   to\
    \ forward packets restricts the IP addressing scheme used; in\n   particular,\
    \ the IGMP/MLD-based forwarding devices must be given the\n   lowest IP addresses\
    \ of any potential IGMP/MLD Querier on the link, in\n   order to win the IGMP/MLD\
    \ Querier election.  IGMP/MLD Querier\n   election rule defines that the Querier\
    \ that has the lowest IP address\n   wins the election.  (The IGMP/MLD Querier\
    \ election rule is defined in\n   IGMP/MLD specifications as part of the IGMP/MLD\
    \ behavior.)  So in an\n   IGMP/MLD-based forwarding-only environment, if non-proxy\
    \ device wins\n   the IGMP/MLD Querier election, no packets will flow.\n   For\
    \ example, the figure below shows an IGMP/MLD-based forwarding-only\n   environment:\n\
    \           LAN 1  --------------------------------------\n                  Upstream\
    \ |              | Upstream\n                           A(non-proxy)   B(proxy)\n\
    \                Downstream |(lowest IP)   | Downstream\n           LAN 2  --------------------------------------\n\
    \   Device A has the lowest IP address on LAN 2, but it is not a proxy\n   device.\
    \  According to IGMP/MLD Querier election rule, A will win the\n   election on\
    \ LAN 2 since it has the lowest IP address.  Device B will\n   not forward traffic\
    \ to LAN 2 since it is not the querier on LAN 2.\n   The election of a single\
    \ forwarding proxy is necessary to avoid local\n   loops and redundant traffic\
    \ for links that are considered downstream\n   links by multiple IGMP/MLD-based\
    \ forwarders.  This rule \"piggy-backs\"\n   forwarder election on IGMP/MLD Querier\
    \ election.  The use of the\n   IGMP/MLD Querier election process to choose the\
    \ forwarding proxy\n   delivers similar functionality on the local link as the\
    \ PIM Assert\n   mechanism.  On a link with only one IGMP/MLD-based forwarding\
    \ device,\n   this rule MAY be disabled (i.e., the device MAY be configured to\n\
    \   forward packets to an interface on which it is not the querier).\n   However,\
    \ the default configuration MUST include the querier rule, for\n   example, for\
    \ redundancy purposes, as shown in the figure below:\n           LAN 1  --------------------------------------\n\
    \                  Upstream |              | Upstream\n                      \
    \     A              B\n                Downstream |              | Downstream\n\
    \           LAN 2  --------------------------------------\n   LAN 2 can have two\
    \ proxy devices, A and B.  In such a configuration,\n   one proxy device must\
    \ be elected to forward the packets.  This\n   document requires that the forwarder\
    \ must be the IGMP/MLD querier.\n   So proxy device A will forward packets to\
    \ LAN 2 only if A is the\n   querier.  In the above figure, if A is the only proxy\
    \ device, A can\n   be configured to forward packets even though B is the querier.\n\
    \   Note that this does not protect against an \"upstream loop\".  For\n   example,\
    \ see the figure below:\n           LAN 1  --------------------------------------\n\
    \                  Upstream |              | Downstream\n                    \
    \       A              B\n                Downstream |              | Upstream\n\
    \           LAN 2  --------------------------------------\n   B will unconditionally\
    \ forward packets from LAN 1 to LAN 2, and A\n   will unconditionally forward\
    \ packets from LAN 2 to LAN 1.  This will\n   cause an upstream loop.  A multicast\
    \ routing protocol that employs a\n   tree building algorithm is required to resolve\
    \ loops like this.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Membership Database
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Membership Database\n   The proxy device performs the router portion of\
    \ the IGMP/MLD protocol\n   on each downstream interface.  For each interface,\
    \ the version of\n   IGMP/MLD used is explicitly configured and defaults to the\
    \ highest\n   version supported by the system.\n   The output of this protocol\
    \ is a set of subscriptions; this set is\n   maintained separately on each downstream\
    \ interface.  In addition, the\n   subscriptions on each downstream interface\
    \ are merged into the\n   membership database.\n   The membership database is\
    \ a set of membership records of the form:\n   (multicast-address, filter-mode,\
    \ source-list)\n   Each record is the result of the merge of all subscriptions\
    \ for that\n   record's multicast-address on downstream interfaces.  If some\n\
    \   subscriptions are IGMPv1 or IGMPv2/MLDv1 subscriptions, these\n   subscriptions\
    \ are converted to IGMPv3/MLDv2 subscriptions.  The\n   IGMPv3/MLDv2 and the converted\
    \ subscriptions are first preprocessed\n   to remove the timers in the subscriptions\
    \ and, if the filter mode is\n   EXCLUDE, to remove every source whose source\
    \ timer > 0.  Then the\n   preprocessed subscriptions are merged using the merging\

    \ 3.2\n   of the IGMPv3 specification [RFC3376] and in Section 4.2 of the MLDv2\n\
    \   specification [MLDv2]) to create the membership record.  For example,\n  \
    \ there are two downstream interfaces, I1 and I2, that have\n   subscriptions\
    \ for multicast address G.  I1 has an IGMPv2/MLDv1\n   subscription that is (G).\
    \  I2 has an IGMPv3/MLDv2 subscription that\n   has membership information (G,\
    \ INCLUDE, (S1, S2)).  The I1's\n   subscription is converted to an IGMPv3/MLDv2\
    \ subscription that has\n   membership information (G, EXCLUDE, NULL).  Then the\
    \ subscriptions\n   are preprocessed and merged, and the final membership record\
    \ is (G,\n   EXCLUDE, NULL).\n   The proxy device performs the host portion of\
    \ the IGMP/MLD protocol\n   on the upstream interface.  If there is an IGMPv1\
    \ or IGMPv2/MLDv1\n   querier on the upstream network, then the proxy device will\
    \ perform\n   IGMPv1 or IGMPv2/MLDv1 on the upstream interface accordingly.\n\
    \   Otherwise, it will perform IGMPv3/MLDv2.\n   If the proxy device performs\
    \ IGMPv3/MLDv2 on the upstream interface,\n   then when the composition of the\
    \ membership database changes, the\n   change in the database is reported on the\
    \ upstream interface as\n   though this proxy device were a host performing the\
    \ action.  If the\n   proxy device performs IGMPv1 or IGMPv2/MLDv1 on the upstream\n\
    \   interface, then when the membership records are created or deleted,\n   the\
    \ changes are reported on the upstream interface.  All other\n   changes are ignored.\
    \  When the proxy device reports using IGMPv1 or\n   IGMPv2/MLDv1, only the multicast\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since only the Querier forwards packets, the\
    \ IGMP/MLD Querier\n   election process may lead to black holes if a non-forwarder\
    \ is\n   elected Querier.  An attacker on a downstream LAN can cause itself to\n\
    \   be elected Querier, and as a result, no packets would be forwarded.\n   However,\
    \ there are some operational ways to avoid this problem.  It\n   is fairly common\
    \ for an operator to number the routers starting from\n   the bottom of the subnet.\
    \  So an operator SHOULD assign the subnet's\n   lowest IP address(es) to a proxy\
    \ (proxies) in order for the proxy\n   (proxies) to win the querier election.\n\
    \   IGMP/MLD-based forwarding does not provide the \"upstream loop\"\n   detection\
    \ mechanism described in Section 3.  Hence, to avoid the\n   problems caused by\
