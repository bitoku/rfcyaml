  - "1.  Abstract\n   This document defines a MIME Content-Type for holding directory\n\
    \   information.  The definition is independent of any particular\n   directory\
    \ service or protocol.  The text/directory Content-Type is\n   defined for holding\
    \ a variety of directory information, for example,\n   name, or email address,\
    \ or logo. The text/directory Content-Type can\n   also be used as the root body\
    \ part in a multipart/related Content-\n   Type for handling more complicated\
    \ situations, especially those in\n   which non-textual information that already\
    \ has a natural MIME\n   representation, for example, a photograph or sound, is\
    \ to be\n   represented.\n   The text/directory Content-Type defines a general\
    \ framework and\n   format for holding directory information in a simple \"type:value\"\
    \n   form. We refer to \"type\" in this context meaning a property or\n   attribute\
    \ with which the value is associated. Mechanisms are defined\n   to specify alternate\
    \ languages, encodings and other meta-information.\n   This document also defines\
    \ the procedure by which particular formats,\n   called profiles, for carrying\
    \ application-specific information within\n   a text/directory Content-Type can\
    \ be defined and registered, and the\n   conventions such formats must follow.\
    \ It is expected that other\n   documents will be produced that define such formats\
    \ for various\n   applications (e.g., white pages).\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\" and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].\n"

- title: 3.  Need for a MIME Directory Type
  contents:
  - "3.  Need for a MIME Directory Type\n   For purposes of this document, a directory\
    \ is a special-purpose\n   database that contains typed information. A directory\
    \ usually\n   supports both read and search of the information it contains, and\
    \ can\n   support creation and modification of the information as well.\n   Directory\
    \ information is usually accessed far more often than it is\n   updated.  Directories\
    \ can be local or global in scope. They can be\n   distributed or centralized.\
    \ The information they contain can be\n   replicated, with weak or strong consistency\
    \ requirements.\n   There are several situations in which users of Internet mail\
    \ might\n   wish to exchange directory information: the email analogy of a\n \
    \  \"business card\" exchange; the conveyance of directory information to\n  \
    \ a user having only email access to the Internet; the provision of\n   machine-parseable\
    \ address information when purchasing goods or\n   services over the Internet;\
    \ etc.  As MIME [RFC-2045, RFC-2046] is\n   used increasingly by other protocols,\
    \ most notably HTTP, it can also\n   be useful for these protocols to carry directory\
    \ information in MIME\n   format. Such a format, for example, could be used to\
    \ represent URC\n   (uniform resource characteristics) information about resources\
    \ on the\n   World Wide Web, or to provide a rudimentary directory service over\n\
    \   HTTP.\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   The scheme defined here for representing directory information\
    \ in a\n   MIME Content-Type has two parts. First, the text/directory Content-\n\
    \   Type is defined for use in holding directory information within a\n   single\
    \ body part, for example name, title, or email address. In its\n   simplest form,\
    \ the format uses a \"type:value\" approach, which should\n   be easily parseable\
    \ by existing MIME implementations and\n   understandable by users. More complicated\
    \ situations can be\n   represented also.  This document defines the general form\
    \ the\n   information in the Content-Type should have, and the procedure by\n\
    \   which specific types and values (properties) for particular\n   applications\
    \ can be defined. The framework is general enough to\n   handle information from\
    \ any number of end directory services,\n   including LDAP [RFC-1777, RFC-1778],\
    \ WHOIS++ [RFC-1835], and X.500\n   [X500].\n   Directory entries can include\
    \ far more than just textual information.\n   Some such information (e.g., an\
    \ image or sound) overlaps with\n   predefined MIME Content-Types. In these cases\
    \ it can be desirable to\n   include the information in its well-known MIME format.\
    \ This situation\n   is handled by using a multipart/related Content-Type as defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC-2112].  The root component of this type is a text/directory body\n\
    \   part specifying any in-line information, and for information\n   contained\
    \ in other Content-Types, the Content-IDs (in URI form) of\n   those parts.\n\
    \   In some applications, it can be useful to include a pointer (e.g, a\n   URI)\
    \ to some directory information rather than the information\n   itself.  This\
    \ document defines a general mechanism for accomplishing\n   this.\n"

    \ specifically calls\n   for this behavior. Unless specifically forbidden by a\
    \ particular\n   profile definition, a text/directory content type can contain\n\
    \   arbitrary attribute/value pairs.\n   The value of the \"profile\" parameter\

- title: 5.8.1.  Line delimiting and folding
  contents:
  - "5.8.1.  Line delimiting and folding\n   Individual lines within the MIME text/directory\
    \ Content Type body are\n   delimited by the [RFC-822] line break, which is a\
    \ CRLF sequence\n   (ASCII decimal 13, followed by ASCII decimal 10). Long logical\
    \ lines\n   of text can be split into a multiple-physical-line representation\n\
    \   using the following folding technique.\n   A logical line MAY be continued\
    \ on the next physical line anywhere\n   between two characters by inserting a\
    \ CRLF immediately followed by a\n   single white space character (space, ASCII\
    \ decimal 32, or horizontal\n   tab, ASCII decimal 9).  At least one character\
    \ must be present on the\n   folded line. Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately\
    \ by a single\n   white space character is ignored (removed) when processing the\n\
    \   content type.  For example the line:\n   DESCRIPTION:This is a long description\
    \ that exists on a long line.\n   Can be represented as:\n   DESCRIPTION:This\
    \ is a long description\n     that exists on a long line.\n   It could also be\
    \ represented as:\n   DESCRIPTION:This is a long descrip\n    tion that exists\
    \ o\n    n a long line.\n   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line\
    \ representation\n   of a type definition to its single line representation is\
    \ called\n   unfolding.  Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately\n\
    \   followed by a white space character (namely HTAB ASCII decimal 9 or\n   SPACE\
    \ ASCII decimal 32) as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e.,\n   the CRLF\
    \ and single white space character are removed).\n"

    \ corresponding values are\n   defined as specified in Section 11.  Specifications\
    \ MAY impose\n   ordering on the type constructs within a body part, though none\
    \ is\n   required by default.  The various x-name constructs are used for\n  \
    \ bilaterally-agreed upon type names, parameter names and parameter\n   values,\
    \ or for use in experimental settings.\n   Type names and parameter names are\
    \ case insensitive (e.g., the type\n   name \"fn\" is the same as \"FN\" and \"\
    Fn\"). Parameter values MAY be case\n   sensitive or case insensitive, depending\
    \ on their definition.\n   The group construct is used to group related attributes\
    \ together.\n   The group name is a syntactic convention used to indicate that\
    \ all\n   type names prefaced with the same group name SHOULD be grouped\n   together\
    \ when displayed by an application. It has no other\n   significance.  Implementations\
    \ that do not understand or support\n   grouping MAY simply strip off any text\
    \ before a \".\" to the left of\n   the type name and present the types and values\
    \ as normal.\n   Each attribute defined in the text/directory body MAY have multiple\n\
    \   values, if allowed in the definition of the profile in which the\n   attribute\
    \ is used. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items\n   is to simply create\
    \ a new content line for each value (including the\n   type name).  However, it\
    \ should be noted that some value types\n   support encoding multiple values in\
    \ a single content line by\n   separating the values with a comma \",\".  This\
    \ approach has been taken\n   for several of the content types defined below (date,\

    \ \"b\" encoding is supported.\n   The \"b\" encoding can also be useful for binary\
    \ values that are mixed\n   with other text information in the body part (e.g.,\
    \ a certificate).\n   Using a per-value \"b\" encoding in this case leaves the\
    \ other\n   information in a more readable form. The encoded base 64 value can\
    \ be\n   split across multiple physical lines in the content type by using the\n\
    \   line folding technique described above.\n   The Content-Transfer-Encoding\
    \ header field is used to specify the\n   encoding used for the body part as a\
    \ whole. The \"encoding\" type\n   parameter is used to specify an encoding for\
    \ a particular value\n   (e.g., a certificate).  In this case, the Content-Transfer-Encoding\n\
    \   header might specify \"8bit\", while the one certificate value might\n   specify\
    \ an encoding of \"b\" via an \"encoding=b\" type parameter.\n   The Content-Transfer-Encoding\
    \ and the encodings of individual types\n   given by the \"encoding\" type parameter\
    \ are independent of one\n   another.  When encoding a text/directory body part\
    \ for transmission,\n   individual type encodings are performed first, then the\
    \ entire body\n   part is encoded according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding.\
    \  When\n   decoding a text/directory body part, the Content-Transfer-Encoding\
    \ is\n   decoded first, and then any individual types with an \"encoding\" type\n\
    \   parameter are decoded.\n   The \"value\" parameter is optional, and is used\
    \ to identify the value\n   type (data type) and format of the value.  The use\
    \ of these\n   predefined formats is encouraged even if the value parameter is\
    \ not\n   explicity used.  By defining a standard set of value types and their\n\
    \   formats, existing parsing and processing code can be leveraged.\n   Including\
    \ the value type explicitly as part of each property provides\n   an extra hint\
    \ to keep parsing simple and support more generalized\n   applications.  For example\
    \ a search engine would not have to know the\n   particular value types for all\
    \ of the items for which it is\n   searching.  Because the value type is explicit\
    \ in the definition, the\n   search engine could look for dates in any item type\
    \ and provide\n   results that can still be interpreted.\n"

    \ types and formats:\n   \"text\": The \"text\" value type should be used to identify\
    \ values that\n   contain human-readable text. The character set and language\
    \ in which\n   the text is represented is controlled by the charset content-header\n\
    \   and the language type parameter and content-header.\n         Examples for\
    \ \"text\":\n                    this is a text value\n                    this\
    \ is one value,this is another\n                    this is a single value\\,\
    \ with a comma encoded\n   A formatted text line break in a text value type MUST\
    \ be represented\n   as the character sequence backslash (ASCII decimal 92) followed\
    \ by a\n   Latin small letter n (ASCII decimal 110) or a Latin capital letter\
    \ N\n   (ASCII decimal 78), that is \"\\n\" or \"\\N\".\n   For example a multiple\
    \ line DESCRIPTION value of:\n   Mythical Manager\n   Hyjinx Software Division\n\
    \   BabsCo, Inc.\n   could be represented as:\n   DESCRIPTION:Mythical Manager\\\
    nHyjinx Software Division\\n\n    BabsCo\\, Inc.\\n\n   demonstrating the \\n\
    \ literal formatted line break technique, the\n   CRLF-followed-by-space line\
    \ folding technique, and the backslash\n   escape technique.\n   \"uri\": The\
    \ \"uri\" value type should be used to identify values that\n   are referenced\
    \ by a URI (including a Content-ID URI), instead of\n   encoded in-line. These\
    \ value references might be used if the value is\n   too large, or otherwise undesirable\
    \ to include directly. The format\n   for the URI is as defined in RFC 1738.\n\
    \       Examples for \"uri\":\n                  http://www.foobar.com/my/picture.jpg\n\
    \                  ldap://ldap.foobar.com/cn=babs%20jensen\n   \"date\", \"time\"\
    , and \"date-time\": Each of these value types is based\n   on a subset of the\
    \ definitions in ISO 8601 standard. Profiles MAY\n   place further restrictions\
    \ on \"date\" and \"time\" values.  Multiple\n   \"date\" and \"time\" values\
    \ can be specified using the comma-separated\n   notation, unless restricted by\
    \ a profile.\n       Examples for \"date\":\n                   1985-04-12\n \
    \                  1996-08-05,1996-11-11\n                   19850412\n      \
    \ Examples for \"time\":\n                   10:22:00\n                   102200\n\

    \       1996-10-22T14:00:00Z,1996-08-11T12:34:56Z\n   \"boolean\": The \"boolean\"\
    \ value type is used to express boolen values.\n   These values are case insensitive.\n\
    \       Examples: TRUE\n                 false\n                 True\n   \"integer\"\
    : The \"integer\" value type is used to express signed\n   integers in decimal\
    \ format. If sign is not specified, the value is\n   assumed positive \"+\". Multiple\
    \ \"integer\" values can be specified\n   using the comma-separated notation,\

    \    -1234556790\n                 +1234556790,432109876\n   \"float\": The \"\
    float\" value type is used to express real numbers.  If\n   sign is not specified,\
    \ the value is assumed positive \"+\". Multiple\n   \"float\" values can be specified\
    \ using the comma-separated notation,\n   unless restricted by a profile.\n  \
