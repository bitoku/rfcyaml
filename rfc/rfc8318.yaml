- title: 2.  Background on 'IAOC Liaisons' to Nominating Committees
  contents:
  - "2.  Background on 'IAOC Liaisons' to Nominating Committees\n   When RFC 7437\
    \ [RFC7437] was approved, it explicitly charged the\n   nominating committee with\
    \ selecting and reviewing certain members of\n   the IAOC.  However, [RFC7437]\
    \ did not provide for the IAOC to send a\n   liaison to the nominating committee.\n\
    \   This was not thought to be an obstacle because [RFC7437] allowed any\n   committee\
    \ member to propose a liaison from the IAOC:\n      Any committee member may propose\
    \ the addition of a liaison from\n      other unrepresented organizations to participate\
    \ in some or all of\n      the deliberations of the committee.  The addition must\
    \ be approved\n      by the committee according to its established voting mechanism.\n\
    \      Liaisons participate as representatives of their respective\n      organizations.\n\
    \   Beginning in 2010, the IAOC provided a liaison to each nominating\n   committee.\
    \  In 2016, the IAOC did not provide a liaison because the\n   nominating committee\
    \ was not appointing an IAOC member.  The previous\n   nominating committee had\
    \ filled a mid-term vacancy (using the process\n   described in Section 3.5. of\
    \ [RFC7437]) by appointing an IAOC member\n   for a term longer than two years.\
    \  In 2017, the NomCom was selecting\n   an IAOC member, but the opportunity to\
    \ request a liaison from the\n   IAOC was overlooked, because this practice wasn't\
    \ part of the\n   documented process in [RFC7437].\n   This specification adds\
    \ the previously ad hoc role to [RFC7437] so\n   that future nominating committees\
    \ will be less likely to overlook it.\n   Although past ad hoc practice has characterized\
    \ this role as a\n   \"liaison\", this specification labels the role as an \"\
    advisor\".  The\n   rationale for this change in nomenclature is provided in\n\
    \   Appendix A.1.\n"

- title: A.1.  Why Is This Role an Advisor?
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Why Is This Role an Advisor?\n   The editor of this document briefly considered\
    \ proposing a new and\n   IAOC-specific role to [RFC7437] but considered such\
    \ a proposal to be\n   complex.  Anticipating every corner case in IETF process\
    \ BCPs is\n   challenging and prone to error, and as this specification was being\n\
    \   written, the IETF Chair was sponsoring a design team reviewing all\n   aspects\
    \ of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA).\n   Therefore, the structure\
    \ and membership of the IAOC itself could\n   change in the near future.  Instead,\
    \ the specification describes how\n   the nominating committee requests advisors\
    \ and builds on mature text\n   that has survived many nominating committee cycles.\n\
    \   After choosing to reuse existing roles defined in [RFC7437], the\n   definition\
    \ of \"advisor\" in Section 4.9 of [RFC7437] seemed\n   appropriate.\n      An\
    \ advisor is responsible for such duties as specified by the\n      invitation\
    \ that resulted in the appointment.\n      Advisors do not vote on the selection\
    \ of candidates.\n   The position described in this specification could be filled\
    \ by an\n   advisor who would be a non-voting member of the nominating committee,\n\
    \   who is knowledgeable about the operations of the IAOC, and who has\n   duties\
    \ that could evolve over time as the IAOC itself evolves.\n   The only difference\
    \ between this advisor that requires an update to\n   [RFC7437], and any other\
    \ advisor is that committee members are\n   explicitly encouraged to suggest that\
    \ this advisor be appointed as\n   described in this specification.  The text\
    \ updating [RFC7437] is\n   found in Section 3.\n"
- title: A.2.  Why Is This Role Not a Liaison?
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Why Is This Role Not a Liaison?\n   Discussions on the IETF NomCom mailing\
    \ list led to the recognition\n   that \"liaison\" was not the best description\
    \ of this role.\n   The role of liaison defined in Section 4.7 of [RFC7437] places\
    \ some\n   significant obligations on liaisons beyond what is necessary for\n\
    \   someone to answer questions from the nominating committee about the\n   IAOC.\
    \  These obligations include the following:\n   o  Liaisons are responsible for\
    \ ensuring the nominating committee in\n      general and the Chair in particular\
    \ execute their assigned duties\n      in the best interest of the IETF community.\n\
    \   o  Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of\n      Trustees\
    \ (if one is appointed) are expected to review the\n      operation and execution\
    \ process of the nominating committee and to\n      report any concerns or issues\
    \ to the Chair of the nominating\n      committee immediately.  If they cannot\
    \ resolve the issue between\n      themselves, liaisons must report it according\
    \ to the dispute\n      resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.\n\
    \   o  Liaisons may have other nominating committee responsibilities as\n    \
    \  required by their respective organizations or requested by the\n      nominating\
    \ committee; such responsibilities may not conflict with\n      any other provisions\
    \ of this document.\n   Finally, as mentioned in Section 4.6 of [RFC7437], all\
    \ of the\n   liaisons are included in the pool of people who are eligible to be\n\
    \   selected as a replacement for a Chair.\n      There are a variety of ordinary\
    \ circumstances that may arise from\n      time to time that could result in a\
    \ Chair being unavailable to\n      oversee the activities of the committee. \
    \ The Chair, in\n      consultation with the Internet Society President, may appoint\
    \ a\n      substitute from a pool comprised of the liaisons currently serving\n\
    \      on the committee and the prior year's Chair or designee.\n   Note: During\
    \ discussion of this specification, we noted that any\n   liaison would be part\
    \ of the pool of potential substitute nominating\n   committee Chairs.  It wasn't\
    \ clear to the discussion participants\n   whether there was an intentional decision\
    \ to make liaisons voted onto\n   the nominating committee eligible to be substitute\
    \ Chairs.  That\n   potential change is out of scope for this specification but\
    \ may be a\n   conversation worth having separately.\n   All of these obligations\
    \ are important, but there are always at least\n   two full liaisons from the\
    \ confirming bodies that are already\n   responsible for those responsibilities.\
    \  It is simply not necessary\n   to make the job of helping the nominating committee\
    \ understand the\n   role and operational practices of the IAOC more demanding\
    \ than it\n   must be.\n   So, requiring the IAOC to name a formal liaison to\
    \ the nominating\n   committee isn't justified.\n"
- title: A.3.  Why Is This Role Not Required to Be a Sitting IAOC Member?
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Why Is This Role Not Required to Be a Sitting IAOC Member?\n   In addition\
    \ to the reasons given in Appendix A.2, the requirement\n   that the IAB and IESG\
    \ liaisons to the nominating committee be sitting\n   members of the organizations\
    \ they represent, whose positions are not\n   being reviewed by this nominating\
    \ committee, is especially\n   challenging for the IAOC.\n   Many IAOC positions\
    \ are filled by members who are already members of\n   IETF leadership and are\
    \ subject to review by the nominating\n   committee.  This means that limiting\
    \ an IAOC liaison to one of the\n   sitting members would mean that in some years\
    \ the only individuals\n   eligible to serve as liaison for the nominating committee\
    \ would be\n   sitting members of the IAOC that a) were appointed by the previous\n\
    \   nominating committee and are not being by the current nominating\n   committee,\
    \ or b) were appointed by the IAB or IESG and are not being\n   reviewed by the\
    \ current IAB or IESG.  \"Eligible\" does not also mean\n   \"willing and able\
    \ to serve\", so it is possible that an IAOC might\n   find itself with no sitting\
    \ member to send as advisor in some years.\n   Although all IAOC liaisons to the\
    \ nominating committee have served as\n   sitting members of the IAOC, given 10\
    \ years of IAOC operation, this\n   specification assumes that other members of\
    \ the community have\n   sufficient experience to provide guidance if the IAOC\
    \ chooses to\n   suggest such a person.  If any given IAOC thought that was important,\n\
    \   they could certainly continue to suggest sitting members, but if no\n   sitting\
    \ member was willing and able to serve, the IAOC would be free\n   to do the next\
    \ best thing and would likely be the best qualified\n   group to decide who to\
    \ send.\n"
- title: A.4.  Why Does the Nominating Committee Request an IAOC Advisor?
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Why Does the Nominating Committee Request an IAOC Advisor?\n   This specification\
    \ could have described the mechanism in one of two\n   ways:\n   o  the IAOC could\
    \ simply provide the name of the advisor to the\n      nominating committee, or\n\
    \   o  the nominating committee could request the name of an advisor from\n  \
    \    the IAOC.\n   Either choice could work.  The reason that this specification\
    \ chose\n   to have the nominating committee make the first move is that this\
    \ is\n   more similar to the way other advisors to the nominating committee\n\
    \   are selected, except that the nominating committee is asking the IAOC\n  \
    \ for a suggestion before inviting the advisor to join the nominating\n   committee.\n\
    \   The suggestion is, in fact, a suggestion; the nominating committee\n   still\
    \ votes to invite this advisor as they would vote to invite any\n   advisor, as\
    \ described in Section 4.3 of [RFC7437].\n"
