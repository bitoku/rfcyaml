  - "1.  Introduction\n   A stitched Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)\
    \ Traffic\n   Engineering (TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) is built from a set of\n\
    \   different \"LSP segments\" (S-LSPs) that are connected together in the\n \
    \  data plane in such a way that a single end-to-end LSP is realized in\n   the\
    \ data plane.  In this document, we define the concept of LSP\n   stitching and\
    \ detail the control plane mechanisms and procedures\n   (routing and signaling)\
    \ to accomplish this.  Where applicable,\n   similarities and differences between\
    \ LSP hierarchy [RFC4206] and LSP\n   stitching are highlighted.  Signaling extensions\
    \ required for LSP\n   stitching are also described here.\n   It may be possible\
    \ to configure a GMPLS node to switch the traffic\n   from an LSP for which it\
    \ is the egress, to another LSP for which it\n   is the ingress, without requiring\
    \ any signaling or routing extensions\n   whatsoever and such that the operation\
    \ is completely transparent to\n   other nodes.  This results in LSP stitching\
    \ in the data plane, but\n   requires management intervention at the node where\
    \ the stitching is\n   performed.  With the mechanism described in this document,\
    \ the node\n   performing the stitching does not require configuration of the\
    \ pair\n   of S-LSPs to be stitched together.  Also, LSP stitching as defined\n\
    \   here results in an end-to-end LSP both in the control and data\n   planes.\n"

- title: 2.  Comparison with LSP Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "2.  Comparison with LSP Hierarchy\n   LSP hierarchy ([RFC4206]) provides signaling\
    \ and routing procedures\n   so that:\n   a. A Hierarchical LSP (H-LSP) can be\
    \ created.  Such an LSP created in\n      one layer can appear as a data link\
    \ to LSPs in higher layers.  As\n      such, one or more LSPs in a higher layer\
    \ can traverse this H-LSP\n      as a single hop; we call this \"nesting\".\n\
    \   b. An H-LSP may be managed and advertised (although this is not a\n      requirement)\
    \ as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link.  Advertising an\n      H-LSP as a TE link\
    \ allows other nodes in the TE domain in which it\n      is advertised to use\
    \ this H-LSP in path computation.  If the H-LSP\n      TE link is advertised in\
    \ the same instance of control plane (TE\n      domain) in which the H-LSP was\
    \ provisioned, it is then defined as\n      a forwarding adjacency LSP (FA-LSP)\
    \ and GMPLS nodes can form a\n      forwarding adjacency (FA) over this FA-LSP.\
    \  There is usually no\n      routing adjacency between end points of an FA. \
    \ An H-LSP may also\n      be advertised as a TE link in a different TE domain.\
    \  In this\n      case, the end points of the H-LSP are required to have a routing\n\
    \      adjacency between them.\n   c. RSVP signaling ([RFC3473], [RFC3209]) for\
    \ LSP setup can occur\n      between nodes that do not have a routing adjacency.\n\
    \   In case of LSP stitching, instead of an H-LSP, an LSP segment (S-LSP)\n  \
    \ is created between two GMPLS nodes.  An S-LSP for stitching is\n   considered\
    \ to be the moral equivalent of an H-LSP for nesting.  An\n   S-LSP created in\
    \ one layer, unlike an H-LSP, provides a data link to\n   other LSPs in the same\
    \ layer.  Similar to an H-LSP, an S-LSP could be\n   managed and advertised, although\
    \ it is not required, as a TE link,\n   either in the same TE domain as it was\
    \ provisioned or a different\n   one.  If so advertised, other GMPLS nodes can\
    \ use the corresponding\n   S-LSP TE link in path computation.  While there is\
    \ a forwarding\n   adjacency between end points of an H-LSP TE link, there is\
    \ no\n   forwarding adjacency between end points of an S-LSP TE link.  In this\n\
    \   aspect, an H-LSP TE link more closely resembles a 'basic' TE link as\n   compared\
    \ to an S-LSP TE link.\n   While LSP hierarchy allows more than one LSP to be\
    \ mapped to an H-\n   LSP, in case of LSP stitching, at most one LSP may be associated\
    \ with\n   an S-LSP.  Thus, if LSP-AB is an H-LSP between nodes A and B, then\n\
    \   multiple LSPs, say LSP1, LSP2, and LSP3, can potentially be 'nested\n   into'\
    \ LSP-AB.  This is achieved by exchanging a unique label for each\n   of LSP1..3\
    \ over the LSP-AB hop, thereby separating the data\n   corresponding to each of\
    \ LSP1..3 while traversing the H-LSP LSP-AB.\n   Each of LSP1..3 may reserve some\
    \ bandwidth on LSP-AB.  On the other\n   hand, if LSP-AB is an S-LSP, then at\
    \ most one LSP, say LSP1, may be\n   stitched to the S-LSP LSP-AB.  LSP-AB is\
    \ then dedicated to LSP1, and\n   no other LSPs can be associated with LSP-AB.\
    \  The entire bandwidth on\n   S-LSP LSP-AB is allocated to LSP1.  However, similar\
    \ to H-LSPs,\n   several S-LSPs may be bundled into a TE link ([RFC4201]).\n \
    \  The LSPs LSP1..3 that are either nested or stitched into another LSP\n   are\
    \ termed as e2e LSPs in the rest of this document.  Routing\n   procedures specific\
    \ to LSP stitching are detailed in Section 4.\n   Targeted (non-adjacent) RSVP\
    \ signaling defined in [RFC4206] is\n   required for LSP stitching of an e2e LSP\
    \ to an S-LSP.  Specific\n   extensions for LSP stitching are described in Section\
    \ 5.1.\n   Therefore, in the control plane, there is one RSVP session\n   corresponding\
    \ to the e2e LSP as well as one for each S-LSP.  The\n   creation and termination\
    \ of an S-LSP may be dictated by\n   administrative control (statically provisioned)\
    \ or due to another\n   incoming LSP request (dynamic).  Triggers for dynamic\
    \ creation of an\n   S-LSP may be different from that of an H-LSP and will be\
    \ described in\n   detail in Section 3.1.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Triggers for LSP Segment Setup
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Triggers for LSP Segment Setup\n   An S-LSP may be created either by administrative\
    \ control\n   (configuration trigger) or dynamically due to an incoming LSP\n\
    \   request.  LSP hierarchy ([RFC4206]) defines one possible trigger for\n   dynamic\
    \ creation of an FA-LSP by introducing the notion of LSP\n   regions based on\
    \ Interface Switching Capabilities.  As per [RFC4206],\n   dynamic FA-LSP creation\
    \ may be triggered on a node when an incoming\n   LSP request crosses region boundaries.\
    \  However, this trigger MUST\n   NOT be used for creation of an S-LSP for LSP\
    \ stitching as described\n   in this document.  In case of LSP stitching, the\
    \ switching\n   capabilities of the previous hop and the next hop TE links MUST\
    \ be\n   the same.  Therefore, local policies configured on the node SHOULD be\n\
    \   used for dynamic creation of LSP segments.\n   Other possible triggers for\
    \ dynamic creation of both H-LSPs and S-\n   LSPs include cases where an e2e LSP\
    \ may cross domain boundaries or\n   satisfy locally configured policies on the\
    \ node as described in\n   [RFC5151].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Applications
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Applications\n   LSP stitching procedures described in this document are\
    \ applicable to\n   GMPLS nodes that need to associate an e2e LSP with another\
    \ S-LSP of\n   the same switching type and LSP hierarchy procedures do not apply.\n\
    \   For example, if an e2e lambda LSP traverses an LSP segment TE link\n   that\
    \ is also lambda-switch capable, then LSP hierarchy is not\n   possible; in this\
    \ case, LSP switching may be an option.\n   LSP stitching procedures can be used\
    \ for inter-domain TE LSP\n   signaling to stitch an inter-domain e2e LSP to a\
    \ local intra-domain\n   TE S-LSP ([RFC4726] and [RFC5151]).\n   LSP stitching\
    \ may also be useful in networks to bypass legacy nodes\n   that may not have\
    \ certain new capabilities in the control plane\n   and/or data plane.  For example,\
    \ one suggested usage in the case of\n   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) RSVP LSPs\
    \ ([RFC4875]) is the use of LSP\n   stitching to stitch a P2MP RSVP LSP to an\
    \ LSP segment between P2MP-\n   capable Label Switching Routers (LSRs) in the\
    \ network.  The LSP\n   segment would traverse legacy LSRs that may be incapable\
    \ of acting as\n   P2MP branch points, thereby shielding them from the P2MP control\
    \ and\n   data path.  Note, however, that such configuration may limit the\n \
    \  attractiveness of RSVP P2MP and should carefully be examined before\n   deployment.\n"
- title: 4.  Routing Aspects
  contents:
  - "4.  Routing Aspects\n   An S-LSP is created between two GMPLS nodes, and it may\
    \ traverse zero\n   or more intermediate GMPLS nodes.  There is no forwarding\
    \ adjacency\n   between the end points of an S-LSP TE link.  So although in the\
    \ TE\n   topology, the end points of an S-LSP TE link are adjacent, in the\n \
    \  data plane, these nodes do not have an adjacency.  Hence, any data\n   plane\
    \ resource identifier between these nodes is also meaningless.\n   The traffic\
    \ that arrives at the head end of the S-LSP is switched\n   into the S-LSP contiguously\
    \ with a label swap, and no label is\n   associated directly between the end nodes\
    \ of the S-LSP itself.\n   An S-LSP MAY be treated and managed as a TE link. \
    \ This TE link MAY\n   be numbered or unnumbered.  For an unnumbered S-LSP TE\
    \ link, the\n   schemes for assignment and handling of the local and remote link\n\
    \   identifiers as specified in [RFC3477] SHOULD be used.  When\n   appropriate,\
    \ the TE information associated with an S-LSP TE link MAY\n   be flooded via ISIS-TE\
    \ [RFC4205] or OSPF-TE [RFC4203].  Mechanisms\n   similar to that for regular\
    \ (basic) TE links SHOULD be used to flood\n   S-LSP TE links.  Advertising or\
    \ flooding the S-LSP TE link is not a\n   requirement for LSP stitching.  If advertised,\
    \ this TE information\n   will exist in the TE database (TED) and can then be\
    \ used for path\n   computation by other GMPLS nodes in the TE domain in which\
    \ it is\n   advertised.  When so advertising S-LSPs, one should keep in mind that\n\
    \   these add to the size and complexity of the link-state database.\n   If an\
    \ S-LSP is advertised as a TE link in the same TE domain in which\n   it was provisioned,\
    \ there is no need for a routing adjacency between\n   end points of this S-LSP\
    \ TE link.  If an S-LSP TE link is advertised\n   in a different TE domain, the\
    \ end points of that TE link SHOULD have\n   a routing adjacency between them.\n\
    \   The TE parameters defined for an FA in [RFC4206] SHOULD be used for\n   an\
    \ S-LSP TE link as well.  The switching capability of an S-LSP TE\n   link MUST\
    \ be equal to the switching type of the underlying S-LSP;\n   i.e., an S-LSP TE\
    \ link provides a data link to other LSPs in the same\n   layer, so no hierarchy\
    \ is possible.\n   An S-LSP MUST NOT admit more than one e2e LSP into it.  If\
    \ an S-LSP\n   is allocated to an e2e LSP, the unreserved bandwidth SHOULD be\
    \ set to\n   zero to prevent further e2e LSPs from being admitted into the S-LSP.\n\
    \   Multiple S-LSPs between the same pair of nodes MAY be bundled using\n   the\
    \ concept of Link Bundling ([RFC4201]) into a single TE link.  In\n   this case,\
    \ each component S-LSP may be allocated to at most one e2e\n   LSP.  When any\
    \ component S-LSP is allocated for an e2e LSP, the\n   component's unreserved\
    \ bandwidth SHOULD be set to zero and the\n   Minimum and Maximum LSP bandwidth\
    \ of the TE link SHOULD be\n   recalculated.  This will prevent more than one\
    \ LSP from being\n   computed and admitted over an S-LSP.\n"

- title: 5.1.1.  Creating and Preparing an LSP Segment for Stitching
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Creating and Preparing an LSP Segment for Stitching\n   If a GMPLS node\
    \ desires to create an S-LSP, i.e., one to be used for\n   stitching, then it\
    \ MUST indicate this in the Path message for the S-\n   LSP.  This signaling explicitly\
    \ informs the S-LSP egress node that\n   the ingress node is planning to perform\
    \ stitching over the S-LSP.\n   Since an S-LSP is not conceptually different from\
    \ any other LSP,\n   explicitly signaling 'LSP stitching desired' helps clarify\
    \ the data\n   plane actions to be carried out when the S-LSP is used by some\
    \ other\n   e2e LSP.  Also, in the case of packet LSPs, this is what allows the\n\
    \   egress of the S-LSP to carry out label allocation as explained below.\n  \
    \ Also, so that the head-end node can ensure that correct stitching\n   actions\
    \ will be carried out at the egress node, the egress node MUST\n   signal this\
    \ information back to the head-end node in the Resv, as\n   explained below.\n\
    \   In order to request LSP stitching on the S-LSP, we define a new bit\n   in\
    \ the Attributes Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in\n   [RFC4420]:\n\
    \   LSP stitching desired bit - This bit SHOULD be set in the Attributes\n   Flags\
    \ TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in the Path message for the\n   S-LSP by the\
    \ head end of the S-LSP that desires LSP stitching.  This\n   bit MUST NOT be\
    \ modified by any other nodes in the network.  Nodes\n   other than the egress\
    \ of the S-LSP SHOULD ignore this bit.  The bit\n   number for this flag is defined\
    \ in Section 7.1.\n   An LSP segment can be used for stitching only if the egress\
    \ node of\n   the S-LSP is also ready to participate in stitching.  In order to\n\
    \   indicate this to the head-end node of the S-LSP, the following new\n   bit\
    \ is defined in the Flags field of the Record Route object (RRO)\n   Attributes\
    \ subobject: \"LSP segment stitching ready\".  The bit number\n   for this flag\
    \ is defined in Section 7.1.\n   If an egress node of the S-LSP receiving the\
    \ Path message supports\n   the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and the Attributes Flags\
    \ TLV, and also\n   recognizes the \"LSP stitching desired\" bit, but cannot support\
    \ the\n   requested stitching behavior, then it MUST send back a PathErr\n   message\
    \ with an error code of \"Routing Problem\" and an error value of\n   \"Stitching\
    \ unsupported\" to the head-end node of the S-LSP.  The new\n   error value is\
    \ defined in Section 7.2.\n   If an egress node receiving a Path message with\
    \ the \"LSP stitching\n   desired\" bit set in the Flags field of received LSP_ATTRIBUTES\
    \ object\n   recognizes the object, the TLV TLV, and the bit and also supports\
    \ the\n   desired stitching behavior, then it MUST allocate a non-NULL label\n\
    \   for that S-LSP in the corresponding Resv message.  Also, so that the\n   head-end\
    \ node can ensure that the correct label (forwarding) actions\n   will be carried\
    \ out by the egress node and that the S-LSP can be used\n   for stitching, the\
    \ egress node MUST set the \"LSP segment stitching\n   ready\" bit defined in\
    \ the Flags field of the RRO Attribute subobject.\n   Finally, if the egress node\
    \ for the S-LSP supports the LSP_ATTRIBUTES\n   object but does not recognize\
    \ the Attributes Flags TLV, or supports\n   the TLV as well but does not recognize\
    \ this particular bit, then it\n   SHOULD simply ignore the above request.\n \
    \  An ingress node requesting LSP stitching MUST examine the RRO\n   Attributes\
    \ subobject Flags corresponding to the egress node for the\n   S-LSP, to make\
    \ sure that stitching actions are carried out at the\n   egress node.  It MUST\
    \ NOT use the S-LSP for stitching if the \"LSP\n   segment stitching ready\" bit\

  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Stitching the e2e LSP to the LSP Segment\n   When a GMPLS node receives\
    \ an e2e LSP request, depending on the\n   applicable trigger, it may either dynamically\
    \ create an S-LSP based\n   on procedures described above or map an e2e LSP to\
    \ an existing S-LSP.\n   The switching type in the Generalized Label Request of\
    \ the e2e LSP\n   MUST be equal to the switching type of the S-LSP.  Other constraints\n\
    \   like the explicit path encoded in the Explicit Route object (ERO),\n   bandwidth,\
    \ and local TE policies MUST also be used for S-LSP\n   selection or signaling.\
    \  In either case, once an S-LSP has been\n   selected for an e2e LSP, the following\
    \ procedures MUST be followed in\n   order to stitch an e2e LSP to an S-LSP.\n\
    \   The GMPLS node receiving the e2e LSP setup Path message MUST use the\n   signaling\
    \ procedures described in [RFC4206] to send the Path message\n   to the end point\
    \ of the S-LSP.  In this Path message, the node MUST\n   identify the S-LSP in\
    \ the RSVP_HOP.  An egress node receiving this\n   RSVP_HOP should also be able\
    \ to identify the S-LSP TE link based on\n   the information signaled in the RSVP_HOP.\
    \  If the S-LSP TE link is\n   numbered, then the addressing scheme as proposed\
    \ in [RFC4206] SHOULD\n   be used to number the S-LSP TE link.  If the S-LSP TE\
    \ link is\n   unnumbered, then any of the schemes proposed in [RFC3477] SHOULD\
    \ be\n   used to exchange S-LSP TE link identifiers between the S-LSP end\n  \
    \ points.  If the TE link is bundled, the RSVP_HOP SHOULD identify the\n   component\
    \ link as defined in [RFC4201].\n   In case of a bidirectional e2e TE LSP, an\
    \ Upstream Label MUST be\n   signaled in the Path message for the e2e LSP over\
    \ the S-LSP hop.\n   However, since there is no forwarding adjacency between the\
    \ S-LSP end\n   points, any label exchanged between them has no significance.\
    \  So the\n   node MAY chose any label value for the Upstream Label.  The label\n\
    \   value chosen and signaled by the node in the Upstream Label is out of\n  \
    \ the scope of this document and is specific to the implementation on\n   that\
    \ node.  The egress node receiving this Path message MUST ignore\n   the Upstream\
    \ Label in the Path message over the S-LSP hop.\n   The egress node receiving\
    \ this Path message MUST signal a Label in\n   the Resv message for the e2e TE\
    \ LSP over the S-LSP hop.  Again, since\n   there is no forwarding adjacency between\
    \ the egress and ingress S-LSP\n   nodes, any label exchanged between them is\
    \ meaningless.  So the\n   egress node MAY choose any label value for the Label.\
    \  The label\n   value chosen and signaled by the egress node is out of the scope\
    \ of\n   this document and is specific to the implementation on the egress\n \
    \  node.  The egress S-LSP node SHOULD also carry out data plane\n   operations\
    \ so that traffic coming in on the S-LSP is switched over to\n   the e2e LSP downstream,\
    \ if the egress of the e2e LSP is some other\n   node downstream.  If the e2e\
    \ LSP is bidirectional, this means setting\n   up label switching in both directions.\
    \  The Resv message from the\n   egress S-LSP node is IP routed back to the previous\
    \ hop (ingress of\n   the S-LSP).  The ingress node stitching an e2e TE LSP to\
    \ an S-LSP\n   MUST ignore the Label object received in the Resv for the e2e TE\
    \ LSP\n   over the S-LSP hop.  The S-LSP ingress node SHOULD also carry out\n\
    \   data plane operations so that traffic coming in on the e2e LSP is\n   switched\
    \ into the S-LSP.  It should also carry out actions to handle\n   traffic in the\
    \ opposite direction if the e2e LSP is bidirectional.\n   Note that the label\
    \ exchange procedure for LSP stitching on the S-LSP\n   hop is similar to that\
    \ for LSP hierarchy over the H-LSP hop.  The\n   difference is the lack of the\
    \ significance of this label between the\n   S-LSP end points in case of stitching.\
    \  Therefore, in case of\n   stitching, the recipients of the Label/Upstream Label\
    \ MUST NOT\n   process these labels.  Also, at most one e2e LSP is associated\
    \ with\n   one S-LSP.  If a node at the head end of an S-LSP receives a Path\n\
    \   message for an e2e LSP that identifies the S-LSP in the ERO and the\n   S-LSP\
    \ bandwidth has already been allocated to some other LSP, then\n   regular rules\
    \ of RSVP-TE pre-emption apply to resolve contention for\n   S-LSP bandwidth.\
    \  If the LSP request over the S-LSP cannot be\n   satisfied, then the node SHOULD\
    \ send back a PathErr with the error\n   codes as described in [RFC3209].\n"

    \ we will look at the RRO\n   processing for the e2e LSP over the S-LSP hop.\n\

    \ in this\n   document model the changes introduced by [RFC4206].  That is, the\n\
    \   control interface over which RSVP messages are sent or received need\n   not\
    \ be the same as the data interface that the message identifies for\n   switching\
    \ traffic.  But the capability for this function was\n   introduced in [RFC3473]\
    \ to support the concept of out-of-fiber\n   control channels, so there is nothing\
    \ new in this concept for\n   signaling or security.\n   The application of this\
    \ facility means that the \"sending interface\"\n   or \"receiving interface\"\
    \ may change as routing changes.  So these\n   interfaces cannot be used to establish\
    \ security associations between\n   neighbors, and security associations MUST\
    \ be bound to the\n   communicating neighbors themselves.\n   [RFC2747] provides\
    \ a solution to this issue: in Section 2.1, under\n   \"Key Identifier\", an IP\
    \ address is a valid identifier for the sending\n   (and by analogy, receiving)\
    \ interface.  Since RSVP messages for a\n   given LSP are sent to an IP address\
    \ that identifies the next/previous\n   hop for the LSP, one can replace all occurrences\
    \ of 'sending\n   [receiving] interface' with 'receiver's [sender's] IP address'\n\
    \   (respectively).  For example, in Section 4, third paragraph, instead\n   of:\n\
    \      \"Each sender SHOULD have distinct security associations (and keys)\n \
    \      per secured sending interface (or LIH).  ...  At the sender,\n       security\
    \ association selection is based on the interface through\n       which the message\
    \ is sent.\"\n   it should read:\n      \"Each sender SHOULD have distinct security\
    \ associations (and keys)\n       per secured receiver's IP address. ...  At the\
    \ sender, security\n       association selection is based on the IP address to\
    \ which the\n       message is sent.\"\n   Thus, the mechanisms of [RFC2747] can\
    \ be used unchanged to establish\n   security associations between control plane\
    \ neighbors.\n   This document allows the IP destination address of Path and PathTear\n\
    \   messages to be the IP address of a next hop node (receiver's address)\n  \
    \ instead of the RSVP session destination address.  This means that the\n   use\
    \ of the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) (ruled out in [RFC2747]\n   because\
    \ RSVP messages were encapsulated in IP packets addressed to\n   the ultimate\
    \ destination of the Path or PathTear messages) is now\n   perfectly applicable,\
    \ and standard IPsec procedures can be used to\n   secure the message exchanges.\n\
