- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Broadcast (BCAST) group is\
    \ specifying\n   service and content protection mechanisms for broadcast services\
    \ over\n   wireless networks.  As part of that specification, several new SDP\n\
    \   attributes are necessary to allow the broadcast server to signal the\n   service\
    \ and content protection parameters to clients.\n   Section 8.2.4 of RFC 4566\
    \ [1] requires that new SDP attributes are\n   registered through IANA with name,\
    \ contact information, and\n   description (and other similar parameters).  A\
    \ standards track\n   specification is RECOMMENDED if the new attribute(s) will\
    \ have\n   widespread use and interoperability considerations.\n   OMA BCAST specifications\
    \ are expected to be used by broadcast\n   wireless systems that are based on\
    \ 3rd Generation Partnership Project\n   (3GPP) Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast\
    \ Service (MBMS), 3GPP2 Broadcast\n   and Multicast Services (BCMCS), and Digital\
    \ Video Broadcasting -\n   Handheld (DVB-H).  Although this would typically be\
    \ considered a\n   \"widespread\" use, in this case IETF chose to use a non-standards-\n\
    \   track RFC to register the SDP attributes because OMA maintains change\n  \
    \ control of the documents that specify the interpretation of the\n   values in\
    \ the attributes.\n   This document provides descriptions of the SDP attributes\
    \ used in the\n   OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2].\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [3].\n"
- title: 3.  New SDP Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.  New SDP Attributes\n   The following new SDP attributes have been specified:\n\
    \   o  a=bcastversion:<major>.<minor>\n   o  a=stkmstream:<id of the stkm stream>\n\
    \   o  a=SRTPAuthentication:<id for SRTP authentication algorithm value>\n   o\
    \  a=SRTPROCTxRate:<ROC transmission rate>\n   See Section 5 for details on IANA\
    \ considerations.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the notes in Section 7 of RFC\
    \ 4566 [1], the following\n   considerations may be applicable:\n   The bcastversion\
    \ parameter indicates the version of the broadcast\n   system used for distribution\
    \ of broadcast content.  In case future\n   versions indicated by this parameter\
    \ allow for enhanced or additional\n   security features, the bcastversion parameter,\
    \ if unprotected, could\n   be utilized for downgrade attacks.\n   The stkmstream\
    \ parameter provides references to relevant key\n   management streams so that\
    \ receivers can map the media streams to key\n   streams and retrieve the necessary\
    \ keys to decrypt media.  As such,\n   this parameter could be utilized, if unprotected,\
    \ for denial-of-\n   service (DoS) attacks.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   Per this document, which follows the guidelines of\
    \ [5], IANA has\n   registered a number of SDP attributes.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Registration of New SDP Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Registration of New SDP Attributes\n   IANA has registered a number of\
    \ OMA BCAST only attributes in the\n   Session Description Protocol Parameters\
    \ registry [1].  The\n   registration data, according to RFC 4566 [1] follows.\n\
    \   The registration templates below refer to the OMA-TS-\n   BCAST_SvcCntProtection\
    \ specification [2].\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  Registration of the Attribute bcastversion:<major>.<minor>
  contents:

    \ name:  bcastversion\n   Long-form attribute name:  BCAST version\n   Type of\
    \ attribute:  session level\n      This attribute is not dependent on charset.\n\
    \   Purpose:  This attribute specifies the OMA BCAST version\n      \"bcastversion\"\
    \ value in the format x.y.\n   Specification of attribute values:  This attribute\
    \ has a mandatory\n      value of the form <major>.<minor>, where <major> and\
    \ <minor> are\n      non-negative decimal numbers.  The att-value field is of\
    \ XML data\n      type decimal.  For details, see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection,\n\
    \      Section 10.1.1.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Registration of the Attribute stkmstream:<id of the stkm stream>

    \ Contact:  Anja Jerichow <anja.jerichow@nsn.com>\n   Phone:  +49 89 636-45868\n\
    \   Attribute name:  stkmstream\n   Long-form attribute name:  Short Term Key\
    \ Message stream identifier\n   Type of attribute:  session level or media level\n\
    \      The attribute can be at session level, in which case it applies to\n  \
    \    all media streams, or it can be at media level, in which case it\n      only\
    \ applies to the specified media and would overwrite possible\n      session-level\
    \ attributes.\n      This attribute is not dependent on charset.\n   Purpose:\
    \  The stkmstream attribute specifies the mapping of Short\n      Term Key Message\
    \ streams to media streams in the SDP.\n      Each session or media stream can\
    \ have multiple stkmstream\n      attributes.  By comparing the value of this\
    \ attribute with the\n      identifier of each STKM stream, the terminal can figure\
    \ out which\n      one to listen to and process.  We note that this attribute\
    \ is\n      optional and hence would not be there for unencrypted media\n    \
    \  streams.\n   Specification of attribute values:  This attribute has a mandatory\n\
    \      value of the form <id of the stkm stream>, a unique non-zero\n      integer\
    \ identifying a particular key stream.  Numbers are unique\n      within a particular\
    \ SDP session, i.e., no global numbering is\n      required.  The att-value field\
    \ is of XML data type unsignedShort.\n      For details, see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection,\
    \ Section 10.1.3.\n"

    \  Based on [4], the identifier is a\n      transform-independent parameter of\
    \ the cryptographic context for\n      SRTP in integer format.\n      One of the\

    \ of attribute values:  The attribute value MUST be a\n      decimal integer R\
    \ between 1 and 65535 inclusive, as specified in\n      [4].  If the ROC transmission\
    \ rate is not included in the\n      negotiation, the default value of 1 SHALL\
