  - "1.  Introduction\n   The AAA working group is chartered to work on authentication,\n\
    \   authorization, and accounting solutions for the Internet.  This work\n   consists\
    \ of a base protocol, applications, end-to-end security\n   application, and a\
    \ general architecture for providing these services\n   [3].  The AAA working\
    \ group has specified applicability of AAA-based\n   solutions for a number of\
    \ protocols (e.g., AAA requirements for\n   Mobile IP [4]).\n   SIP is a signalling\
    \ protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating\n   different types of sessions,\
    \ such as Internet phone calls, multimedia\n   distribution, and multimedia conferences\
    \ [1].  SIP sessions have\n   needs for session authentication, authorization,\
    \ and accounting\n   (AAA).\n   In order to authenticate and authorize users,\
    \ it is typically more\n   convenient for SIP entities to communicate with an\
    \ AAA sever than to\n   attempt to store user credentials and profiles locally.\
    \  SIP entities\n   use the SIP-AAA interface to access the AAA server.\n   This\
    \ document provides requirements for the interface between SIP\n   entities and\
    \ AAA servers.  While accounting requirements are\n   discussed, this document\
    \ does not cover SIP charging or billing\n   mechanisms.\n   One possible use\
    \ of this document would be to create an AAA\n   application for SIP.  Any protocol\
    \ meeting the requirements outlined\n   by this document could be used.  Possible\
    \ candidates, among others,\n   are Diameter [3] and XML-based protocols following\
    \ the web-services\n   model.\n"

  - "1.1.  RADIUS\n   The main purpose of this document is to provide input to designers\n\
    \   working on AAA applications using new protocols, such as Diameter and\n  \
    \ XML-based protocols.  Nevertheless, a few limited RADIUS [5]\n   extensions\
    \ may meet some of the requirements in this document (for\n   instance, some of\
    \ the authentication requirements).  We expect that\n   while RADIUS with these\
    \ limited extensions will meet particular\n   functional requirements, it will\
    \ not meet other important\n   requirements.  The following are some requirements\
    \ that are not\n   expected to be met by RADIUS:\n      1. Section 2.1.3: RADIUS\
    \ does not support a discovery feature.\n      2. Section 2.1.7: RADIUS does not\
    \ support reliable message\n         delivery.\n   The following list contains\
    \ the requirements that can be met by\n   RADIUS or RADIUS extensions.\n     \
    \ 1. Section 2.1.2: Communication between domains does not scale\n         well\
    \ in RADIUS.  As a result, inter-domain communications are\n         typically\
    \ handled using a proxy architecture [6].\n      2. Section 2.1.5: RADIUS clients\
    \ would need to support Dynamic\n         Authorization [7].\n      3. Section\
    \ 2.1.9: RADIUS clients would need to rely on a lower-\n         layer security\
    \ protocol, such as IPSec, to perform mutual\n         authentication.\n     \
    \ 4. Section 2.3.3: RADIUS clients would need to support Dynamic\n         Authorization\
    \ [7].\n      5. Section 2.3.4: RADIUS clients would need to support Dynamic\n\
    \         Authorization [7].\n"

- title: 2.1.8.  Call Setup Times
  contents:
  - "2.1.8.  Call Setup Times\n   AAA SHOULD NOT unduly burden call setup times where\
    \ appropriate.  It\n   may be reasonable to support some delay during registration,\

- title: 2.1.9.  Security
  contents:
  - "2.1.9.  Security\n   The SIP-AAA interface is a potential target of an attack.\
    \  An\n   eavesdropper may attempt to obtain confidential data by sniffing\n \
    \  messages.  Additionally, an active attacker may attempt to modify,\n   insert,\
    \ or replay messages between the SIP entity and the AAA server.\n   Attackers\
    \ may also attempt to impersonate legitimate SIP entities or\n   AAA servers.\n\
    \   To address these threats, the SIP-AAA interface MUST support\n   confidentiality,\

    \ AAA servers to authorize any SIP\n   request, except CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx\
    \ final responses.\n      CANCELs and ACKs for non-2xx final responses are hop-by-hop\n\
    \      requests that can be generated by proxies.  SIP servers receiving\n   \
    \   a CANCEL or a ACK for a non-2xx final response do not challenge\n      them,\
    \ as they would do with an end-to-end request.  Instead, they\n      check at\
    \ the transport or network layer that the entity sending\n      the CANCEL or\
    \ the ACK is the same as the one that generated the\n      request being canceled\
    \ or acked.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Information Transfer
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Information Transfer\n   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow transferring\
    \ a wide range or set of\n   information to be used to make an authorization decision.\
    \  In\n   particular, the SIP-AAA interface MUST allow an AAA server that is\n\
    \   making an authorization decision to deliver the user profile to the\n   SIP\
    \ entity.  Such a user profile may provide further information\n   about the authorization\
    \ decision to the SIP entity.\n   For instance, a SIP proxy receives an INVITE\
    \ from user A addressed to\n   user B.  The SIP proxy queries an AAA server and\
    \ gets the following\n   answer: user A is authorized to call user B, as long\
    \ as the requests\n   are routed through a particular SIP proxy server C.  In\
    \ this case,\n   the SIP proxy needs to use SIP loose routing techniques to forward\n\
    \   the INVITE so that it traverses SIP proxy C before reaching user B.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  User De-authorization
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  User De-authorization\n   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow the AAA server\
    \ to inform a SIP\n   entity when a particular user is no longer authorized to\
    \ perform a\n   particular task, even if it is an ongoing task.\n"
- title: 2.3.4.  User Re-authorization
  contents:
  - "2.3.4.  User Re-authorization\n   The SIP-AAA interface MUST allow the AAA server\
    \ to inform a SIP\n   entity that a particular authorization has been refreshed,\
    \ and\n   therefore, the user is still authorized to perform a particular task.\n"
- title: 2.3.5.  Support for Credit Control
  contents:
  - "2.3.5.  Support for Credit Control\n   The SIP-AAA interface MUST support credit\
    \ control.  That is, the AAA\n   server has to be able to check the end user's\
    \ account for coverage\n   for the requested service event charge before authorizing\
    \ execution\n   of that service event.  Note that this requirement is related\
    \ to\n   accounting as well.\n   Credit control is useful to implement prepaid\
    \ services where all\n   chargeable events related to a specific account are withheld\
    \ from the\n   end user when the credit of that account is exhausted or expired.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Accounting Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Accounting Requirements\n   This section outlines requirements on the SIP-AAA\
    \ interface related\n   to accounting.  Accounting is more than simple charging.\
    \  Accounting\n   may be a simple list of services accessed, servers accessed,\
    \ duration\n   of session, etc.  Charging for SIP sessions can be extremely complex\n\
    \   and requires some additional study.  It is not the intent of this\n   section\
    \ to focus on charging.\n      The information available to be accounted is different\
    \ at SIP\n      proxies and at SIP UAs.  When end-to-end encryption is used,\n\
    \      proxies do not have access to some parts of the SIP messages,\n      while\
    \ UAs have access to the whole messages.  In addition to this,\n      UAs typically\
    \ have information about the session itself (e.g.,\n      number of audio packets\
    \ exchanged during an audio session).\n      Therefore, even if the SIP-AAA interface\
    \ provides a means to\n      transfer a wide range of data, some SIP nodes may\
    \ not have access\n      to it.  In order to design a network, it is important\
    \ to analyze\n      which SIP nodes will be able to generate the desired account\n\
    \      records.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Separation of Accounting Information\n   AAA accounting messages MUST\
    \ be able to provide granular information\n   based on different parameters.\n\
    \   For example, it should be possible to separate \"session duration\"\n   information\
    \ from other information generated via additional services\n   (e.g., 3-way calling).\
    \  Separating accounting information makes it\n   possible to provide accounting\

    \  That is, the SIP-AAA interface MUST be able\n   to provide the AAA server with\
    \ the types (e.g., voice and video) of\n   the media streams of a given session.\n\
    \   Note, however, that some SIP entities do not have access to this\n   information,\
    \ which is typically carried in session descriptions.  An\n   example of a SIP\
    \ entity with access to this information is a SIP UA\n   (e.g., a gateway towards\

    \  So, the SIP-AAA interface\n   MUST allow the AAA server to correlate a particular\
    \ AAA session with\n   any aspect of the SIP messages.  For example, an AAA server\
    \ that\n   receives accounting information about a SIP dialog may be interested\n\
    \   in knowing the Call-ID of the SIP dialog.\n"

  - "3.  Scenarios\n   This section outlines some possible scenarios for SIP and AAA\n\
    \   interaction.  These are purely illustrative examples and do not\n   impose\
    \ any requirements.\n   Figure 1 shows the typical call flow between a SIP proxy\
    \ that\n   communicates to an AAA server that performs authentication and\n  \
    \ authorization.  All the examples are based on this flow.\n          SIP    \
    \        SIP            AAA\n          UAC           Proxy          Server\n \

    \   Figure 1: Call flow over the SIP-AAA interface\n   The SIP proxy receives\
    \ a request with certain credentials.  The SIP\n   UAC that generated the request\
    \ may have included the credentials\n   after having been challenged by the proxy\
    \ using a 407 (Proxy\n   Authentication Required) response.  The SIP proxy sends\
    \ a request to\n   the AAA server asking if it is OK to provide a particular service\
    \ for\n   this request.  The service may be simply routing forward the request\n\
    \   or may consist of a more complex service.  The AAA server checks that\n  \
    \ the credentials are correct (authentication), and checks the user\n   profile.\
    \  The user profile indicates that it is OK to provide the\n   service, and responds\
    \ to the SIP proxy.  The SIP proxy provides the\n   service requested by the SIP\
    \ UAC.\n"
