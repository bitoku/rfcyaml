  - "Abstract\n   This document mandates support for EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for\n\
    \   DNS) in DNS entities claiming to support either DNS Security\n   Extensions\
    \ or A6 records.  This requirement is necessary because\n   these new features\
    \ increase the size of DNS messages.  If EDNS0 is\n   not supported fall back\
    \ to TCP will happen, having a detrimental\n   impact on query latency and DNS\
    \ server load.  This document updates\n   RFC 2535 and RFC 2874, by adding new\
    \ requirements.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Familiarity with the DNS [RFC1034, RFC1035], DNS Security\
    \ Extensions\n   [RFC2535], EDNS0 [RFC2671] and A6 [RFC2874] is helpful.\n   STD\
    \ 13, RFC 1035 Section 2.3.4 requires that DNS messages over UDP\n   have a data\
    \ payload of 512 octets or less.  Most DNS software today\n   will not accept\
    \ larger UDP datagrams.  Any answer that requires more\n   than 512 octets, results\
    \ in a partial and sometimes useless reply\n   with the Truncation Bit set; in\
    \ most cases the requester will then\n   retry using TCP.  Furthermore, server\
    \ delivery of truncated responses\n   varies widely and resolver handling of these\
    \ responses also varies,\n   leading to additional inefficiencies in handling\
    \ truncation.\n   Compared to UDP, TCP is an expensive protocol to use for a simple\n\
    \   transaction like DNS: a TCP connection requires 5 packets for setup\n   and\
    \ tear down, excluding data packets, thus requiring at least 3\n   round trips\
    \ on top of the one for the original UDP query.  The DNS\n   server also needs\
    \ to keep a state of the connection during this\n   transaction.  Many DNS servers\
    \ answer thousands of queries per\n   second, requiring them to use TCP will cause\
    \ significant overhead and\n   delays.\n"

    '
- title: 2.1.  DNSSEC motivations
  contents:
  - "2.1.  DNSSEC motivations\n   DNSSEC [RFC2535] secures DNS by adding a Public\
    \ Key signature on each\n   RR set.  These signatures range in size from about\
    \ 80 octets to 800\n   octets, most are going to be in the range of 80 to 200\
    \ octets.  The\n   addition of signatures on each or most RR sets in an answer\n\
    \   significantly increases the size of DNS answers from secure zones.\n   For\
    \ performance reasons and to reduce load on DNS servers, it is\n   important that\
    \ security aware servers and resolvers get all the data\n   in Answer and Authority\
    \ section in one query without truncation.\n   Sending Additional Data in the\
    \ same query is helpful when the server\n   is authoritative for the data, and\
    \ this reduces round trips.\n   DNSSEC OK[OK] specifies how a client can, using\
    \ EDNS0, indicate that\n   it is interested in receiving DNSSEC records.  The\
    \ OK bit does not\n   eliminate the need for large answers for DNSSEC capable\
    \ clients.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Message authentication or TSIG motivation
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Message authentication or TSIG motivation\n   TSIG [RFC2845] allows for\
    \ the light weight authentication of DNS\n   messages, but increases the size\
    \ of the messages by at least 70\n   octets.  DNSSEC specifies for computationally\
    \ expensive message\n   authentication SIG(0) using a standard public key signature.\
    \  As only\n   one TSIG or SIG(0) can be attached to each DNS answer the size\n\
    \   increase of message authentication is not significant, but may still\n   lead\
    \ to a truncation.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IPv6 Motivations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IPv6 Motivations\n   IPv6 addresses [RFC2874] are 128 bits and can be represented\
    \ in the\n   DNS by multiple A6 records, each consisting of a domain name and\
    \ a\n   bit field.  The domain name refers to an address prefix that may\n   require\
    \ additional A6 RRs to be included in the answer.  Answers\n   where the queried\
    \ name has multiple A6 addresses may overflow a 512-\n   octet UDP packet size.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Root server and TLD server motivations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Root server and TLD server motivations\n   The current number of root servers\
    \ is limited to 13 as that is the\n   maximum number of name servers and their\
    \ address records that fit in\n   one 512-octet answer for a SOA record.  If root\
    \ servers start\n   advertising A6 or KEY records then the answer for the root\
    \ NS records\n   will not fit in a single 512-octet DNS message, resulting in\
    \ a large\n   number of TCP query connections to the root servers.  Even if all\n\
    \   client resolver query their local name server for information, there\n   are\
    \ millions of these servers.  Each name server must periodically\n   update its\
    \ information about the high level servers.\n   For redundancy, latency and load\
    \ balancing reasons, large numbers of\n   DNS servers are required for some zones.\
    \  Since the root zone is used\n   by the entire net, it is important to have\
    \ as many servers as\n   possible.  Large TLDs (and many high-visibility SLDs)\
    \ often have\n   enough servers that either A6 or KEY records would cause the\
    \ NS\n   response to overflow the 512 byte limit.  Note that these zones with\n\
    \   large numbers of servers are often exactly those zones that are\n   critical\
    \ to network operation and that already sustain fairly high\n   loads.\n"
- title: 2.4.  UDP vs TCP for DNS messages
  contents:
  - "2.4.  UDP vs TCP for DNS messages\n   Given all these factors, it is essential\
    \ that any implementation that\n   supports DNSSEC and or A6 be able to use larger\
    \ DNS messages than 512\n   octets.\n   The original 512 restriction was put in\
    \ place to reduce the\n   probability of fragmentation of DNS responses.  A fragmented\
    \ UDP\n   message that suffers a loss of one of the fragments renders the\n  \
    \ answer useless and the query must be retried.  A TCP connection\n   requires\
    \ a larger number of round trips for establishment, data\n   transfer and tear\
    \ down, but only the lost data segments are\n   retransmitted.\n   In the early\
    \ days a number of IP implementations did not handle\n   fragmentation well, but\
    \ all modern operating systems have overcome\n   that issue thus sending fragmented\
    \ messages is fine from that\n   standpoint.  The open issue is the effect of\
    \ losses on fragmented\n   messages.  If connection has high loss ratio only TCP\
    \ will allow\n   reliable transfer of DNS data, most links have low loss ratios\
    \ thus\n   sending fragmented UDP packet in one round trip is better than\n  \
    \ establishing a TCP connection to transfer a few thousand octets.\n"
- title: 2.5.  EDNS0 and large UDP messages
  contents:
  - "2.5.  EDNS0 and large UDP messages\n   EDNS0 [RFC2671] allows clients to declare\
    \ the maximum size of UDP\n   message they are willing to handle.  Thus, if the\
    \ expected answer is\n   between 512 octets and the maximum size that the client\
    \ can accept,\n   the additional overhead of a TCP connection can be avoided.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol changes:\n   This document updates RFC 2535 and RFC 2874, by adding\
    \ new\n   requirements.\n   All RFC 2535 compliant servers and resolvers MUST\
    \ support EDNS0 and\n   advertise message size of at least 1220 octets, but SHOULD\
    \ advertise\n   message size of 4000.  This value might be too low to get full\n\
    \   answers for high level servers and successor of this document may\n   require\
    \ a larger value.\n   All RFC 2874 compliant servers and resolver MUST support\
    \ EDNS0 and\n   advertise message size of at least 1024 octets, but SHOULD advertise\n\
    \   message size of 2048.  The IPv6 datagrams should be 1024 octets,\n   unless\
    \ the MTU of the path is known.  (Note that this is smaller than\n   the minimum\
    \ IPv6 MTU to allow for some extension headers and/or\n   encapsulation without\
    \ exceeding the minimum MTU.)\n   All RFC 2535 and RFC 2874 compliant entities\
    \ MUST be able to handle\n   fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 UDP packets.\n   All hosts\
    \ supporting both RFC 2535 and RFC 2874 MUST use the larger\n   required value\
    \ in EDNS0 advertisements.\n"
