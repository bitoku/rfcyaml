  - "1.1.  WG Co-Chair's Note:\n   After the AAA WG re-charter was approved, and the\
    \ Network Access\n   Requirements document passed AAA WG Last Call, a Solicitation\
    \ of\n   Protocol Submissions was issued on 4/13/2000.  The Solicitation was\n\
    \   sent to the AAA WG mailing list, as well as to other IETF WG mailing\n   lists\
    \ related to AAA, including NASREQ, Mobile IP, RAP, and SNMPv3.\n   Submissions\
    \ were solicited effective immediately.  Authors of\n   candidate protocols were\
    \ requested to notify the AAA WG chairs of\n   their intent to submit a candidate\
    \ protocol.  It was suggested that\n   this notification be sent by May 1, 2000.\n\
    \   Protocol submissions and compliance description documents were to be\n   submitted\
    \ in Internet Draft format by email to internet-\n   drafts@ietf.org.  The deadline\
    \ for submissions was June 1, 2000.  To\n   be considered as a candidate, submissions\
    \ needed to include an\n   unqualified RFC 2026 statement, as described at:\n\
    \   http://www.ietf.org/Sec10.txt\n   In order to assist the AAA WG in evaluating\
    \ the protocol submissions\n   and compliance description documents, the AAA WG\
    \ chairs then formed\n   an evaluation team, which was announced on May 20, 2000.\
    \  The job of\n   the team was be to put together an Internet Draft documenting\
    \ their\n   evaluation of the protocol submissions.  The goal is to have a first\n\
    \   draft available prior to the July 14, 2000 submission deadline for\n   IETF\
    \ 48.\n   In composing the evaluation draft, the evaluation team was asked to\n\
    \   draw from the protocol specifications, the compliance descriptions,\n   and\
    \ other relevant documents, the Network Access Requirements\n   document, RFC\
    \ 2989.\n   Mike St. Johns was asked to chair the evaluation team.  The chairs\
    \ of\n   WGs related to AAA were also invited to join the team.  These\n   included\
    \ Dave Mitton, co-chair of NASREQ WG, Basavaraj Patil, co-\n   chair of Mobile\
    \ IP WG, and Mark Stevens, co-chair of the RAP WG.\n   Additional members of the\
    \ evaluation team were chosen to represent\n   the interests of network operators\
    \ as well as developers of AAA\n   client and server software.\n   As usual, the\
    \ IESG advised the evaluation team.  IESG advisors\n   included Randy Bush and\
    \ Bert Wijnen, Directors of the Operations and\n   Management Area.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Chairman's Note:\n   This document is the result of 6 weeks of intense\
    \ work by the panel\n   listed below.  Our mission was to evaluate the various\
    \ AAA proposals\n   and provide recommendations to the AAA working group and to\
    \ the IESG\n   on the viability of each of the proposals.\n   The evaluation process\
    \ had three distinct phases.  1) Validate the\n   AAA requirements document [AAAReqts]\
    \ against the base requirements\n   documents for NASREQ, MOBILEIP and ROAMOPS.\
    \  2) Evaluate each of the\n   SNMP, Radius++, Diameter and COPS proposal claims\
    \ against the\n   validated requirements.  3) Provide final recommendations based\
    \ on\n   side by side comparison for each proposal on a requirement by\n   requirement\
    \ basis.\n   In general, the ONLY information the evaluators were allowed to use\n\
    \   throughout the process was that provided in the source documents (the\n  \
    \ requirements document and the proposal) or documents referenced by\n   the source\
    \ documents.  In other words, if it wasn't written down, it\n   generally didn't\
    \ exist.  Our cutoff for acceptance of information was\n   1 June 2000 - any submissions\
    \ after that time were not considered in\n   the panel's deliberations.\n"

    \ during the early years.  No\n   involvement in the AAA submission.  Have not\
    \ contributed to the\n   development of Diameter.\n   No involvement with SNMPv3\
    \ or the AAA submission.  David Harrington,\n   a proponent, works in a different\
    \ group within my company.  We have\n   not discussed the submission.  No involvement\
    \ with the COPS protocol.\n   Basavaraj Patil, Nokia\n   I am a contributor to\
    \ the AAA requirements document (RFC 2977)\n   submitted by the Mobile IP WG.\
    \  I was a member of the team that was\n   constituted to capture the Mobile IP\
    \ requirements for AAA services.\n   As part of the co-chairing activity of the\
    \ Mobile IP WG I have\n   realized the need for AAA services by Mobile IP and\
    \ hence closely\n   followed the work done in the AAA WG, RADIUS, RoamOps and\
    \ TR45.6.\n   My present work at Nokia does involve looking at AAA protocols (to\n\
    \   some extent at least) for use in wireless networks.  I have also done\n  \
    \ some work with AAA protocols such as Diameter in my previous job at\n   Nortel\
    \ Networks.\n   Mark Stevens, Ellacoya Networks\n   I am the co-chair of the IETF\
    \ RAP working group which is the working\n   group that has developed the COPS\
    \ protocol.  I have not contributed\n   to the documents describing how COPS can\

    \ RADIUS client, proxy and server software, under\n   contract to AT&T.  That\
    \ software is owned by AT&T and I have no\n   financial interest in it.\n   I\
    \ have been a member of the RADIUS WG for several years, and consider\n   myself\
    \ an advocate for RADIUS against what I consider unjustified\n   attacks on it.\n\
    \   I've never worked for any of the companies whose staff have produced\n   any\
    \ of the proposals, although I obviously might at some future time.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Requirements Validation Process
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Requirements Validation Process\n   For each of the base requirements documents,\
    \ the chair assigned a\n   team member to re-validate the requirement.  The process\
    \ was fairly\n   mechanical; the evaluator looked at what was said in [AAAReqts],\
    \ and\n   verified that the references and supporting text in the basis\n   document\
    \ supported the requirement in [AAAReqts] as stated.  Where\n   the reference\
    \ was wrong, too general, missing or otherwise did not\n   support the requirement,\
    \ the evaluator either deleted or downgraded\n   the requirement.  The results\
    \ of that process were sent to the AAA\n   mailing list and are also included\
    \ in this document in the\n   appendixes.  The group's used [AAAReqts] as modified\
    \ by our\n   validation findings to evaluate the AAA proposals.\n"
- title: 1.5.  Proposal Evaluation
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Proposal Evaluation\n   For each of the four proposals, the chair assigned\
    \ two panel members\n   to write evaluation briefs.  One member was assigned to\
    \ write a 'PRO'\n   brief and could take the most generous interpretation of the\n\
    \   proposal; he could grant benefit of doubt.  The other member was\n   assigned\
    \ to write a 'CON' brief and was required to use the strictest\n   criteria when\
    \ doing his evaluation.\n   Each brief looked at each individual requirement and\
    \ evaluated how\n   close the proposal came in meeting that requirement.  Each\
    \ item was\n   scored as one of an 'F' for failed to meet the requirement, 'P'\
    \ for\n   partially meeting the requirement, or 'T' for totally meeting the\n\
    \   requirement.  The proposals were scored only on the information\n   presented.\
    \  This means that a particular protocol might actually meet\n   the specifics\
    \ of a requirement, but if the proposal did not state,\n   describe or reference\
    \ how that requirement was met, in might be\n   scored lower.\n   The panel met\
    \ by teleconference to discuss each proposal and the PRO\n   and CON briefs. \
    \ Each of the briefers discussed the high points of\n   the brief and gave his\
    \ summary findings for the proposal.  We then\n   discussed each individual requirement\
    \ line-by-line as a group.  At\n   the conclusion, the members provided their\
    \ own line-by-line\n   evaluations which were used to determine the consensus\
    \ evaluation for\n   the specific requirement relative to that proposal.  The\
    \ meeting\n   notes from those teleconferences as well as the individual briefs\
    \ are\n   included in the appendixes.\n"
- title: 1.6.  Final Recommendations Process
  contents:
  - "1.6.  Final Recommendations Process\n   The panel met for one last time to compare\
    \ the results for the four\n   proposals and to ensure we'd used consistent evaluation\
    \ criteria.  We\n   did a requirement by requirement discussion, then a discussion\
    \ of\n   each of the protocols.\n   The final phase was for each member to provide\
    \ his final summary\n   evaluation for each of the protocols.  Each proposal was\
    \ scored as\n   either Not Acceptable, Acceptable Only For Accounting, Acceptable\n\
    \   with Engineering and Fully Acceptable.  Where a proposal was\n   acceptable\
    \ with engineering, the member indicated whether it would be\n   a small, medium\
    \ or large amount.\n   It should be noted that score indicated the opinion of\
    \ the team\n   member.  And they may have taken into consideration background\n\

- title: 3.1 General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1 General Requirements\n   3.1.1 Scalability - SNMP:P, RADIUS:P, Diameter:T,\
    \ COPS:T\n   SNMP was downgraded due to a lack of detail of how the current agent\n\
    \   model would be adapted to a client request based transaction.  The\n   RADIUS\
    \ proposal did not address the problem adequately.  There are\n   open issues\
    \ in all proposals with respect to webs of proxies.\n   3.1.2 Fail-over - SNMP:P,\
    \ RADIUS:P, Diameter:P, COPS:T/P\n   The group particularly noted that it didn't\
    \ think any protocol did\n   well in this requirement.  Insufficient work has\
    \ been done to specify\n   link failure detection and primary server recovery\
    \ in most\n   submissions.  COPS has some mechanisms but not all.  How these\n\
    \   mechanisms would work in a web of proxies has not been addressed.\n   3.1.3\
    \ Mutual Authentication  - SNMP:T, RADIUS:T/P, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   Many of\
    \ the submissions missed the point of the requirement.  There\n   should be a\
    \ way for the peers to authenticate each other, end-to-end,\n   or user-to-server.\
    \   However, the group questions who really needs\n   this feature, and if it\
    \ could be done at a different level.\n   Mutual authentication in RADIUS is only\
    \ between hops.\n   3.1.4 Transmission Level Security  - SNMP:T, RADIUS:P, Diameter:T,\n\
    \   COPS:T\n   All protocols have methods of securing the message data.\n   3.1.5\
    \ Data Object Confidentiality  - SNMP:P, RADIUS:P, Diameter:T,\n   COPS:T\n  \
    \ This requirement usually comes from third-party situations, such as\n   access\
    \ outsourcing.\n   Diameter and COPS both use CMS formats to secure data objects.\
    \  The\n   group is concerned if this method and it's support is perhaps too\n\
    \   heavy weight for NAS and some types of edge systems.\n   3.1.6 Data Object\
    \ Integrity  - SNMP:F, RADIUS:P, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   How to guard the data\
    \ object from changes was not adequately\n   described in the SNMP proposal. \
    \ The RADIUS solution was not very\n   strong either.\n   3.1.7 Certificate Transport\
    \  - SNMP:T, RADIUS:T, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   All protocols can figure out some\
    \ way to transport a certificate.\n   3.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport  - SNMP:P,\
    \ RADIUS:P, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   The requirement does not give a definition\
    \ of \"how reliable\" it must\n   be.\n   The SNMP and RADIUS proposals lacked\
    \ in providing solutions to\n   message retransmission and recovery.\n   3.1.9\
    \ Run over IPv4  - SNMP:T, RADIUS:T, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   3.1.10 Run over IPv6\
    \  - SNMP:P, RADIUS:T, Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   The SNMP proposal indicated that\
    \ this area is still in the\n   experimental stages.\n   3.1.11 Support Proxy\
    \ and Routing Brokers  - SNMP:F, RADIUS:P,\n   Diameter:T, COPS:P\n   The SNMP\
    \ proposal did not address this requirement.  COPS claims\n   support, but does\
    \ not work through some of the issues.  Diameter was\n   the only protocol that\
    \ attempted to address this area to a fair\n   extent.\n   3.1.12 Auditability\
    \ - SNMP:F, RADIUS:F, Diameter:T, COPS:P\n   We treated this requirement as something\
    \ like \"non-repudiation\".\n   There is a concern that digital signatures may\
    \ be too computationally\n   expensive for some equipment, and not well deployed\
    \ on those\n   platforms.\n   The SNMP and RADIUS proposals did not attempt to\
    \ work this\n   requirement.  COPS suggests that a History PIB will help solve\
    \ this\n   problem but gives no description.\n   3.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required\
    \  - SNMP:P/T, RADIUS:T, Diameter:T,\n   COPS:T\n   The requirement is interpreted\
    \ to mean that any application level\n   security can be turned off in the presence\
    \ of transport level\n   security.\n   Pretty much every protocol can use an enveloping\
    \ secure transport\n   that would allow them not to use an internal secret.\n\

    \ Diameter:P,\n   COPS:T\n   To supply this, the proposal must have asynchronous\
    \ peer-to-peer\n   capabilities, and there must defined operation for such state\n\
    \   changes.\n   We also distinguished event-driven Reauthentication from timer-driven\n\
    \   (or lifetime-driven).  Also concerned about how this would work in a\n   proxy\
    \ environment.\n   3.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication - SNMP:P, RADIUS:T/P,\n\
    \   Diameter:T, COPS:T\n   This requirement really means authorization with trivial\n\

- title: 4.1.  SNMP
  contents:
  - "4.1.  SNMP\n   SNMP is generally not acceptable as a general AAA protocol.  There\n\
    \   may be some utility in its use for accounting, but the amount of\n   engineering\
    \ to turn it into a viable A&A protocol argues against\n   further consideration.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Radius++
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Radius++\n   Radius++ is not considered acceptable as an AAA protocol.\
    \  There is a\n   fairly substantial amount of engineering required to make it\
    \ meet all\n   requirements, and that engineering would most likely result in\n\
    \   something close to the functionality of Diameter.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Diameter

  - "4.3.  Diameter\n   Diameter is considered acceptable as an AAA protocol.  There\
    \ is some\n   minor engineering required to bring it into complete compliance\
    \ with\n   the requirements but well within short term capabilities.  Diameter\n\
    \   might also benefit from the inclusion of a broader data model ala\n   COPS.\n"

    \ with the requirements.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Summary Recommendation
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Summary Recommendation\n   The panel expresses a slight preference for\
    \ Diameter based on the\n   perception that the work for Diameter is further along\
    \ than for COPS.\n   However, using SCTP as the transport mechanism for Diameter\
    \ places\n   SCTP on the critical path for Diameter.  This may ultimately result\n\
    \   in COPS being a faster approach if SCTP is delayed in any way.\n"

    \   Auditability - Clarification [j] does not appear to coincide with the\n  \
    \ NASREQ meaning of Auditability.  Given that NASREQ is the only\n   protocol\

- title: C.1 SNMP PRO Evaluation
  contents:
  - "C.1 SNMP PRO Evaluation\n   Evaluation of SNMP AAA Requirements\n   PRO Evaluation\n\
    \   Evaluator - Stuart Barkley\n   Ref [1] is \"Comparison of SNMPv3 Against AAA\
    \ Network Access\n   Requirements\", aka 'the document'\n   Ref [2] is the aaa\
    \ eval criteria as modified by us, aka 'the\n   requirements'\n   The document\
    \ uses T to indicate total compliance, P to indicate\n   partial compliance and\
    \ F to indicate no compliance.  For each section\n   I've indicated my grade for\
    \ the section.  If there is a change, I've\n   indicated that and the grade given\
    \ by the authors.\n   1 Per item discussion\n   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1\
    \ Scalability - Grade T\n   The document indicates that SNMP can adequately handle\
    \ that scale\n   from the requirements document.  Since most current uses are\
    \ ppp\n   connections and SNMP is already capable of handling the interface\n\
    \   table and other per session tables it is clear that basic capacity\n   exists.\
    \  Additions to support other tables and variables scales in a\n   simple linear\
    \ fashion with the number of additional variables and\n   protocol interactions.\
    \  Regardless of the final selected protocol\n   handling the scaling required\
    \ is not a trivial undertaking.  SNMP can\n   draw upon existing network management\
    \ practices to assist in this\n   implementation.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over - Grade\
    \ T\n   SNMP is of vital importance to the operation of most networks.\n   Existing\
    \ infrastructures can handle required failover or other\n   redundant operations.\n\
    \   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication - Grade T\n   The use of shared secrets described\
    \ in the document is a well\n   understood method of integrity control.  Although\
    \ shared secrets\n   don't necessarily provide full authentication since other\
    \ parties may\n   also have the same secrets, the level of authentication is sufficient\n\
    \   for the task at hand.  In many cases the SNMP infrastructure will\n   already\
    \ exist and shared secrets should already be properly managed\n   on an operational\
    \ network.  A failure of the SNMP shared secret\n   approach regardless of the\
    \ AAA protocol will likely leave equipment\n   and systems open to substantial\
    \ misuse bypassing any more elaborate\n   AAA authentication.\n   1.1.4 Transmission\
    \ Level Security - Grade T\n   SNMPv3 provides many additional security options\
    \ which were not\n   available or were more controversial in previous SNMP versions.\n\
    \   1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality - New Grade P (from T)\n   The document\
    \ discusses SNMPv3 which can provide data confidentially\n   for data passing\
    \ over the wire.  There is substantial implied AAA\n   architecture (brokers and\
    \ proxies) in the requirements that full\n   conformance is difficult to determine.\
    \  In particular, the evaluator\n   has difficulty with the concept of \"the target\
    \ AAA entity for whom\n   the data is ultimately destined\", but will concede\
    \ that the desired\n   requirement is only partially met (most especially with\
    \ the transfer\n   of a PAP password).\n   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity - New Grade\
    \ T (from P)\n   SNMP has full capabilities that allow the authentication of the\
    \ data.\n   Brokers, proxies or other intermediaries in the data chain can verify\n\
    \   the source of the information and determine that the data has not\n   been\
    \ tampered with.  The document downgrades the grade to P because\n   of confusion\
    \ over the integrity checking role of intermediaries.\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport\
    \ - Grade T\n   The requirements require the capability of transporting certificates\n\
    \   but do not have any specific use for the certificates.  The\n   requirements\
    \ make assumptions that the protocol selected will be\n   dependent upon certificates,\
    \ but this is not necessarily true.  SNMP\n   can transport arbitrary objects\
    \ and can transport certificates if\n   necessary.  The document indicates some\
    \ issues with size of\n   certificates and current maximum practical data sizes,\
    \ however if the\n   compact encoding requirement extends to the internal certificate\n\
    \   information this should be less of an issue.\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport\
    \ - New Grade T (from P)\n   The requirements is stated rather strongly and makes\
    \ substantial\n   assumptions of AAA protocol architecture and based upon current\n\
    \   protocols and their failings.  SNMP allows for great flexibility in\n   retransmission\
    \ schemes depending upon the importance of the data.\n   1.1.9 Run over IPv4 -\
    \ Grade T\n   SNMP has operated in this mode for many years.\n   1.1.10 Run over\
    \ IPv6 - New Grade T (from P)\n   SNMP must support IPv6 for many other systems\
    \ so support for this\n   should be possible by the time the requirement becomes\
    \ effective.\n   The document indicates that experimental versions satisfying\
    \ this\n   requirement are already in existence.\n   1.1.11 Support Proxy and\
    \ Routing Brokers - New Grade T (from P)\n   The requirements make significant\
    \ assumptions about the final\n   architecture.  It is well within the capabilities\
    \ of SNMP to provide\n   intermediaries which channel data flows between multiple\
    \ parties.\n   The document downgrades SNMPs compliance with this requirement\
    \ due to\n   issues which are covered more specifically under \"Data Object\n\
    \   Confidentially\" which the evaluator has downgraded to P.\n   1.1.12 Auditability\
    \ - New Grade T (from F)\n   Data flows inside SNMP are easily auditable by having\
    \ secondary data\n   flows established which provide copies of all information\
    \ to\n   auxiliary servers.  The document grades this as a failure, but this\n\
    \   support is only minor additions within a more fully fleshed out set\n   of\
    \ data flows.\n   1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required - Grade T\n   Shared secrets\
    \ are not required by SNMP.  They are desirable in many\n   instances where a\
    \ lower level does not provide the necessary\n   capabilities.  The document supplies\
    \ pointers to various security\n   modes available.\n   1.1.14 Ability to Carry\
    \ Service Specific Attributes - Grade T\n   SNMP has long had the ability for\
    \ other parties to create new\n   unambiguous attributes.\n   1.2 Authentication\
    \ Requirements\n   1.2.1 NAI Support - Grade T\n   SNMP easily supports this.\
    \  NAIs were defined to be easily carried in\n   existing protocols.\n   1.2.2\
    \ CHAP Support - Grade T\n   SNMP can easily provide objects to pass the necessary\
    \ information for\n   CHAP operation.\n   1.2.3 EAP Support - New Grade T (from\
    \ P)\n   SNMP can easily provide objects to pass the necessary information for\n\
    \   EAP operation.  As with CHAP or PAP MIB objects can be created to\n   control\
    \ this operation thus the upgrade from the document grade.\n   1.2.4 PAP/Clear-text\
    \ Passwords - New Grade P (from T)\n   SNMP can easily provide objects to pass\
    \ the necessary information for\n   PAP operation.  The requirement about non-disclosure\
    \ of clear text\n   passwords make assumptions about the protocol implementation.\
    \  The\n   choice to use clear text passwords is inherently insecure and forced\n\
    \   protocol architecture don't really cover this.  This requirement\n   grade\
    \ is downgraded to P (partial) because the document does not\n   really address\
    \ the confidentially of the data at application proxies.\n   1.2.5 Reauthorization\
    \ on demand - Grade T\n   SNMP can easily provide objects to control this operation.\n\
    \   1.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication - New Grade T (from T)\n   The document\
    \ makes an incorrect interpretation of this requirement.\n   However, SNMP makes\
    \ no restriction which prevents to desired\n   requirements.  No actual change\
    \ of grade is necessary, since both the\n   actual requirements and the incorrect\
    \ interpretation are satisfied by\n   SNMP.\n   1.3 Authorization Requirements\n\
    \   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic IP Addr Assignment - Grade T\n   SNMP can easily\
    \ provide objects to control this operation.\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability\
    \ - Grade T\n   As the document describes, with the addition of any necessary\n\
    \   compatibility variables SNMP can be gatewayed to RADIUS applications.\n  \
    \ 1.3.3 Reject Capability - Grade T\n   Any of the active components in the SNMP\
    \ based structure could decide\n   to reject and authentication request for any\
    \ reason.  Due to mixing\n   different levels of requirements the document doesn't\
    \ attempt to\n   directly address this, instead indicating that a higher level\n\
    \   application can cause this operation.\n   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling\
    \ - New Grade T (from ?)\n   Nothing in SNMP explicitly interacts with the selection\
    \ of any\n   tunneling mechanisms the client may select.  The document author\
    \ was\n   unclear about the needs here.\n   1.3.5 Reauth on Demand - Grade T\n\
    \   SNMP can easily provide objects to control this operation.\n   1.3.6 Support\
    \ for ACLs - Grade T\n   The document indicates that should it be desired SNMP\
    \ can provide\n   objects to control these operations.  In addition, active components\n\
    \   can apply substantial further configurable access controls.\n   1.3.7 State\
    \ Reconciliation - Grade T\n   The requirements describe an over broad set of\
    \ required capabilities.\n   The document indicates concern over incompatibilities\
    \ in the\n   requirements, however SNMP can provide methods to allow active\n\
    \   components to reacquire lost state information.  These capabilities\n   directly\
    \ interact with scalability concerns and care needs to be\n   taken when expecting\
    \ this requirement to be met at the same time as\n   the scalability requirements.\n\
    \   1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect - Grade T\n   The document indicates that SNMP\
    \ can easily provide objects to\n   control this operation.\n   1.4 Accounting\
    \ Requirements\n   1.4.1 Real Time Accounting - Grade T\n   SNMP can provide this\
    \ mode of operation.  The document outlines\n   methods both fully within SNMP\
    \ and using SNMP to interface with other\n   transfer methods.  Many providers\
    \ already use SNMP for real time\n   notification of other network events.  This\
    \ capability can directly\n   interact with scalability concerns and implementation\
    \ care needs to\n   be taken to make this properly interact is large scale environments.\n\
    \   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding - Grade T\n   The document indicates the\
    \ possibility of controlling external\n   protocols to handle data transmissions\
    \ where the BER encoding of SNMP\n   objects would be considered excessive.  SNMP\
    \ BER encoded protocol\n   elements are generally in a fairly compact encoding\
    \ form compared\n   with text based forms (as used in some existing radius log\
    \ file\n   implementations).  This interacts with the general requirement for\n\
    \   carrying service specific attributes and the accounting requirement\n   for\
    \ extensibility.  With careful MIB design and future work on SNMP\n   payload\
    \ compression the SNMP coding overhead can be comparable with\n   other less extensible\
    \ protocols.\n   1.4.3 Accounting Record Extensibility - Grade T\n   SNMP has\
    \ a strong tradition of allowing vendor specific data objects\n   to be transferred.\n\
    \   1.4.4 Batch Accounting - Grade T\n   There are many methods which a SNMP based\
    \ system could use for batch\n   accounting.  The document discusses SNMP parameters\
    \ to control the\n   batching process and indicates that certain existing MIBs\
    \ contain\n   examples of implementation strategies.  SNMP log tables can provide\n\
    \   accounting information which can be obtained in many methods not\n   directly\
    \ related to real time capabilities.  The underlying system\n   buffering requirements\
    \ are similar regardless of the protocol used to\n   transport the information.\n\
    \   1.4.5 Guaranteed Delivery - Grade T\n   SNMP is very amenable to providing\
    \ guaranteed delivery.  Particularly\n   in a pull model (versus the often assumed\
    \ push model) the data\n   gatherer can absolutely know that all data has been\
    \ transfered.  In\n   the common push model the data receiver does not know if\
    \ the\n   originator of the data is having problems delivering the data.\n   1.4.6\
    \ Accounting Timestamps - Grade T\n   Timestamps are used for many SNMP based\
    \ operations.  The document\n   points at the DateAndTime textual convention which\
    \ is available for\n   use.  As with all environments the timestamps accuracy\
    \ needs\n   evaluation before the information should be relied upon.\n   1.4.7\
    \ Dynamic Accounting - Grade T\n   As long as there is some way to relate multiple\
    \ records together\n   there are no problems resolving multiple records for the\
    \ same\n   session.  This interacts with the scalability requirement and care\n\
    \   must be taken when implementing a system with both of these\n   requirements.\n\
    \   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n   1.5.1 Encoding of MOBILE IP Registration Messages\
    \ - Grade T\n   SNMP can easily provide objects to transfer this information.\n\
    \   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly - New Grade T (from P)\n   SNMP is already deployed\
    \ in many operational networks.  SNMPv3\n   addresses most concerns people had\
    \ with the operation of previous\n   versions.  True SNMPv3 proxies (as opposed\
    \ to AAA proxies) should\n   become commonplace components in firewalls for those\
    \ organizations\n   which require firewalls.\n   1.5.3 Allocation of Local Home\
    \ Agent - New Grade T (from ?)\n   SNMP is not concerned with the LHA.  This can\
    \ be under control of the\n   Local network to meet its needs.\n   2. Summary\
    \ Discussion\n   SNMP appears to meet most stated requirements.  The areas where\
    \ the\n   SNMP proposal falls short are areas where specific AAA architectures\n\
    \   are envisioned and requirements based upon that architecture are\n   specified.\n\
    \   Scaling of the protocol family is vital to success of a AAA suite.\n   The\
    \ SNMP protocol has proved scalable in existing network management\n   and other\
    \ high volume data transfer operations.  Care needs to be\n   taken in the design\
    \ of a large scale system to ensure meeting the\n   desired level of service,\
    \ but this is true of any large scale\n   project.\n   3. General Requirements\n\
    \   SNMP is well understood and already supported in many ISP and other\n   operational\
    \ environments.  Trust models already exist in many cases\n   and can be adapted\
    \ to provide the necessary access controls needed by\n   the AAA protocols.  Important\
    \ issues with previous versions of SNMP\n   have been corrected in the current\
    \ SNMPv3 specification.\n   The SNMP proposal is silent on the specific data variables\
    \ and\n   message types to be implemented.  This is largely due to the\n   requirements\
    \ not specifying the necessary data elements and the time\n   constraints in extracting\
    \ that information from the base document\n   set.  Such a data model is necessary\
    \ regardless of the ultimate\n   protocol selected.\n   4. Summary Recommendation\n\
    \   SNMP appears to fully meet all necessary requirements for the full\n   AAA\
    \ protocol family.\n"

  - "C.2 SNMP CON Evaluation\n   Evaluation of SNMP AAA Requirements\n   CON Evaluation\n\
    \   Evaluator - Michael StJohns\n   Ref [1] is \"Comparison of SNMPv3 Against\
    \ AAA Network Access\n   Requirements\", aka 'the document'\n   Ref [2] is the\
    \ aaa eval criteria as modified by us.\n   The document uses T to indicate total\
    \ compliance, P to indicate\n   partial compliance and F to indicate no compliance.\
    \  For each section\n   I've indicated my grade for the section.  If there is\
    \ no change, I've\n   indicated that and the grade given by the authors.\n   Section\
    \ 1 - Per item discussion\n   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability -\
    \ Although the document indicates compliance with\n   the requirement, its unclear\
    \ how SNMP actually meets those\n   requirements.  The document neither discusses\
    \ how SNMP will scale,\n   nor provides applicable references.  The argument that\
    \ there is an\n   existence proof given the deployed SNMP systems appears to assume\n\
    \   that one manager contacting many agents maps to many agents (running\n   AAA)\
    \ contacting one AAA server.  A server driven system has\n   substantially different\
    \ scaling properties than a client driven\n   system and SNMP is most definitely\
    \ a server (manager) driven system.\n   Eval - F\n   1.1.2 Fail-over - The document\
    \ indicates the use of application level\n   time outs to provide this mechanism,\
    \ rather than the mechanism being\n   a characteristic of the proposed protocol.\
    \  The protocol provides\n   only partial compliance with the requirement.  Eval\
    \ - P\n   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication - There is some slight handwaving here,\n\
    \   but the protocol's USM mode should be able to support this\n   requirement.\
    \  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.1.4 Transmission Level Security - The authors should\
    \ elaborate on\n   the specific use of the SNMPv3 modes to support these requirements,\n\
    \   but the text is minimally acceptable.  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.1.5 Data\
    \ Object Confidentiality - The authors describe a mechanism\n   which does not\
    \ appear to completely meet the requirement.  VACM is a\n   mechanism for an end\
    \ system (agent) to control access to its data\n   based on manager characteristics.\
    \  This mechanism does not appear to\n   map well to this requirement.  Eval -\
    \ P\n   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity - There appears to be some handwaving\n  \
    \ going on here.  Again, SNMP does not appear to be a good match to\n   this requirement\
    \ due to at least in part a lack of a proxy\n   intermediary concept within SNMP.\
    \  Eval - F\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport - The document does indicate compliance,\n\
    \   but notes that optimization might argue for use of specialized\n   protocols.\
    \  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport - The document indicates\
    \ some confusion\n   with the exact extent of this requirement.  Given the modifications\n\
    \   suggested by the eval group to the explanatory text in [2] for the\n   related\
    \ annotation, the point by point explanatory text is not\n   required.  The document\
    \ does indicate that the use of SNMP is\n   irrespective of the underlying transport\
    \ and the support of this\n   requirement is related at least partially to the\
    \ choice of transport.\n   However, SNMP over UDP - the most common mode for SNMP\
    \ - does not\n   meet this requirement.  Eval - No Change (P)\n   1.1.9 Run over\
    \ IPv4 - While the evaluator agrees that SNMPv3 runs\n   over V4, the authors\
    \ need to point to some sort of reference.  Eval -\n   No Change (T)\n   1.1.10\
    \ Run over IPv6 - The document indicates both experimental\n   implementations\
    \ and future standardization of SNMPv3 over IPv6.  Eval\n   - No Change (P)\n\
    \   1.1.11 Support Proxy and Routing Brokers - The section of the\n   document\
    \ (5.5.3) that, by title, should have the discussion of SNMP\n   proxy is marked\
    \ as TBD.  The section notes that the inability to\n   completely comply with\
    \ the data object confidentiality and integrity\n   requirements might affect\
    \ the compliance of this section and the\n   evaluator agrees.  Eval - F\n   1.1.12\
    \ Auditability - The document indicates no compliance with this\n   requirement.\
    \  Eval - No Change (F)\n   1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required - Slight handwaving\
    \ here, but\n   SNMPv3 does not necessarily require use of its security services\
    \ if\n   other security services are available.  However, the interaction with\n\
    \   VACM in the absence of USM is not fully described and may not have\n   good\
    \ characteristics related to this requirement.  Eval - P\n   1.1.14 Ability to\
    \ Carry Service Specific Attributes - SNMP complies\n   via the use of MIBs. \
    \ Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.2 Authentication Requirements\n   1.2.1 NAI Support\
    \ - The document indicates that MIB objects can be\n   created to meet this requirement,\
    \ but gives no further information.\n   Eval - P\n   1.2.2 CHAP Support - The\
    \ document indicates that MIB objects can be\n   created to meet this requirement,\
    \ but gives no further information.\n   Given the normal CHAP model, its unclear\
    \ exactly how this would work.\n   Eval - F\n   1.2.3 EAP Support - The document\
    \ notes that EAP payloads can be\n   carried as specific MIB objects, but also\
    \ notes that further design\n   work would be needed to fully incorporate EAP.\
    \  Eval - No Change (P)\n   1.2.4 PAP/Clear-text Passwords - The document notes\
    \ the use of MIB\n   objects to carry the clear text passwords and the protection\
    \ of those\n   objects under normal SNMPv3 security mechanisms.  Eval - No Change\n\
    \   (T)\n   1.2.5 Reauthorization on demand - While there's some handwaving here,\n\
    \   its clear that the specific applications can generate the signals to\n   trigger\
    \ reauthorization under SNMP.  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o\
    \ Authentication - The author appears to be\n   confusing the AAA protocol authorization\
    \ with the AAA user\n   authorization and seems to be over generalizing the ability\
    \ of SNMP\n   to deal with general AAA user authorization.  Eval - F\n   1.3 Authorization\
    \ Requirements\n   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic IP Addr Assignment - The reference\
    \ to MIB\n   objects without more definite references or descriptions continues\
    \ to\n   be a negative.  While the evaluator agrees that MIB objects can\n   represent\
    \ addresses, the document needs to at least lead the reader\n   in the proper\
    \ direction.  Eval - F\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability - The transport and\
    \ manipulation of\n   Radius objects appears to be only a part of what is required.\
    \  Eval -\n   P\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability - Again, a clarification of how SNMP\
    \ might\n   accomplish this requirement would be helpful.  The overall document\n\
    \   lacks a theory of operation for SNMP in an AAA role that might have\n   clarified\
    \ the various approaches.  Eval - F\n   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling - Document\
    \ indicates lack of\n   understanding of this requirement.  Eval - F\n   1.3.5\
    \ Reauth on Demand - See response in 1.3.3 above.  None of the\n   text responding\
    \ to this requirement, nor any other text in the\n   document, nor any of the\
    \ references describes the appropriate\n   framework and theory.  Eval - F\n \
    \  1.3.6 Support for ACLs - The response text again references MIB\n   objects\
    \ that can be defined to do this job.  There is additional\n   engineering and\
    \ design needed before this is a done deal.  Eval - P\n   1.3.7 State Reconciliation\

    \ parts of the AAA system back in\n   sync.  Eval - F\n   1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect\
    \ - Assuming that the NAS is an SNMP agent\n   for an AAA server acting as an\
    \ SNMP manager the evaluator concurs.\n   Eval - No Change (T).\n   1.4 Accounting\
    \ Requirements\n   1.4.1 Real Time Accounting - SNMP Informs could accomplish\
    \ the\n   requirements.  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding\
    \ - This is a good and reasonable\n   response.  SNMP can vary the style and type\
    \ of reported objects to\n   meet specific needs.  Eval - No Change (T).\n   1.4.3\
    \ Accounting Record Extensibility - MIBs are extensible.  Eval -\n   No Change\

    \ wording here with\n   respect to what guaranteed means, but the description\
    \ of mechanisms\n   does appear to meet the requirements.  Eval - No Change (T)\n\
    \   1.4.6 Accounting Timestamps - Accounting records can use the\n   DateAndTime\
    \ Textual Convention to mark their times.  Eval - No Change\n   (T)\n   1.4.7\
    \ Dynamic Accounting - The author may have partially missed the\n   point on this\
    \ requirement.  While the number of records per session\n   is not of great interest,\
    \ the delivery may be.  The author should go\n   a little more into depth on this\
    \ requirement.  Eval - No Change (T)\n   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n   1.5.1\
    \ Encoding of MOBILE IP Registration Messages - Registration\n   messages can\
    \ probably be encoded as SNMP messages.  Eval - No Change\n   (T)\n   1.5.2 Firewall\
    \ Friendly - There's a chicken and egg problem with the\n   response to the requirement\
    \ in that the author hopes that SNMP as an\n   AAA protocol will encourage Firewall\
    \ vendors to make SNMP a firewall\n   friendly protocol.  Eval - F\n   1.5.3 Allocation\
    \ of Local Home Agent - The author disclaims an\n   understanding of this requirement.\
    \  Eval - F\n   2. Summary Discussion\n   The documents evaluation score was substantially\
    \ affected by a lack\n   of any document, reference or text which described a\
    \ theory of\n   operation for SNMP in AAA mode.  Of substantial concern are the\
    \ items\n   relating to the AAA server to server modes and AAA client to server\n\
    \   modes and the lack of a map to the SNMP protocol for those modes.\n   The\
    \ evaluator also notes that the scaling issues of SNMP in SNMP\n   agent/manager\
    \ mode are in no way indicative of SNMP in AAA\n   client/server mode.  This has\
    \ a possibility to substantially impair\n   SNMPs use in an AAA role.\n   However,\
    \ SNMP may have a reasonable role in the Accounting space.\n   SNMP appears to\
    \ map well with existing technology, and with the\n   requirements.\n   3. General\
    \ Requirements\n   SNMP appears to meet the general requirements of an IP capable\n\
    \   protocol, but may not have a proper field of use for all specific\n   requirements.\n\
    \   4. Summary Recommendation\n   Recommended in Part.  SNMP is NOT RECOMMENDED\
    \ for use as either an\n   authentication or authorization protocol, but IS RECOMMENDED\
    \ for use\n   as an accounting protocol.\n"

    \ of the RADIUS(v2) protocol\"\n   Ref [3] is the aaa eval criteria as modified\
    \ by us.\n   The documents uses T to indicate total compliance, P to indicate\n\
    \   partial compliance and F to indicate no compliance.\n   For each section I've\
    \ indicated my grade for the section.  I have\n   indicated whether or not my\
    \ evaluation differs from the statements\n   made with respect to RADIUS++.  The\
    \ evaluation ratings as given below\n   may differ from the evaluations codified\
    \ in the document referred to\n   as, \"Comparison of RADIUS Against AAA Network\
    \ Access Requirements\"\n   without any indication.\n   1.1 General Requirements\n\
    \   1.1.1 [a] Scalability - In as much as a protocol's scalability can be\n  \
    \ measured, the protocol seems to transmit information in a fairly\n   efficient\
    \ manner.So, in that the protocol appears not to consume an\n   inordinate amount\
    \ of bandwidth relative to the data it is\n   transmitting, this protocol could\
    \ be considered scalable.  However,\n   the protocol has a limit in the number\
    \ of concurrent sessions it can\n   support between endpoints.  Work arounds exist\
    \ and are in use.  Eval\n   - P (no change)\n   1.1.2 [b] Fail-over - The document\
    \ indicates the use of application\n   level time outs to provide this mechanism,\
    \ rather than the mechanism\n   being a characteristic of the proposed protocol.\
    \  The fail-over\n   requirement indicates that the protocol must provide the\
    \ mechanism\n   rather than the application.  The implication is that the application\n\
    \   need not be aware that the fail-over and subsequent correction when\n   it\
    \ happens.  The application using the RADIUS++ protocol will be\n   involved in\
    \ fail-over recovery activities.  The protocol layer of the\n   software does\
    \ not appear to have the capability built-in.  Given the\n   wording of the requirement:\
    \ Eval - P (changed from T)\n   1.1.3 [c] Mutual Authentication - The RADIUS++\
    \ protocol provides\n   shared-secret as a built-in facility for mutual authentication.\
    \  The\n   authors of the document suggest the use of IPSec to obtain mutual\n\
    \   authentication functions.  The RADIUS++ protocol provides no road\n   blocks\
    \ to obtaining mutual authentication between instances of AAA\n   applications,\
    \ however the protocol provides no facilities for doing\n   so.\n   1.1.4 [d]\
    \ Transmission Level Security - The RADIUS++ protocol\n   provides no transmission\
    \ level security features, nor does it\n   preclude the use of IPSec to obtain\
    \ transmission level security.\n   Eval - P (no change)\n   1.1.5 [e] Data Object\
    \ Confidentiality - The document describes a\n   RAIDUS++ message designed to\
    \ server as an envelope in which encrypted\n   RADIUS messages (attributes) may\
    \ be enclosed.  Eval - T (no change)\n   1.1.6 [f] Data Object Integrity - Using\
    \ visible signatures, the\n   RADIUS++ protocol appears to meet this requirement.\
    \  Eval - T (no\n   change)\n   1.1.7 [g] Certificate Transport - The document\
    \ indicates compliance\n   through the use of the CMS-Data Radius Attribute (message).\
    \  Eval - T\n   (no change)\n   1.1.8 [h] Reliable AAA Transport - The document\
    \ points out that\n   RADIUS++ can be considered a reliable transport when augmented\
    \ with\n   Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.  The protocol itself does not provide\n\
    \   reliability features.  Reliability remains the responsibility of the\n   application\
    \ or a augmenting protocol.  Eval - P (no change)\n   1.1.9 [i] Run over IPv4\

    \ can be made to do so.  Eval\n   - T (no change)\n   1.1.12 [l] Auditability\

    \ within current paradigm of the\n   protocol.  -  Eval -T (no change)\n   1.2.5\
    \ [e] Reauthentication on demand -   The RADIUS protocol\n   supports re-authentication.\
    \  In  case  re-authentication is initiated\n   by the user or AAA client, the\
    \ AAA client can send a new\n   authentication request.  Re-authentication can\
    \ be initiated from the\n   visited or home AAA server by sending a challenge\
    \ message to the AAA\n   client.  Eval - T (no change)\n   1.2.6 [f] Authorization\

    \  the AAA Network Access requirements.\n   However, it is  possible with a small\
    \ effort to extend present\n   procedures to meet the requirements as listed in,\
    \ while maintaining a\n   high level  of interoperability  with  the  wide  deployment\
    \  and\n   installed base of RADIUS clients and servers.\n   3. General Requirements\n\
    \   RADIUS++ the protocol and the application meet the majority of the\n   requirements\
    \ and can be extended to meet the requirements where\n   necessary.\n   4. Summary\
    \ Recommendation\n   RADIUS++ as it could be developed would provide a level of\
    \ backward\n   compatibility that other protocols cannot achieve.  By extending\n\
    \   RADIUS in the simple ways described in the documents listed above,\n   the\
    \ transition from existing RADIUS-based installations to RADIUS++\n   installations\
    \ would be easier.  Although accounting continues to be\n   weaker than other\
    \ approaches, the protocol remains a strong contender\n   for continued use in\
    \ the areas of Authorization and Authentication.\n"

    \ Certificate\n   Extensions\".\n   Ref [6] is RFC 2868\n   The document uses\
    \ T to indicate total compliance, P to indicate\n   partial compliance and F to\
    \ indicate no compliance.  Evaluator's\n   Note:  The document [1] pre-dates the\
    \ protocol [2].  It is clear from\n   reading [2], that some of the issues identified\
    \ as short comings in\n   [1] are now addressed in [2].  The evaluator has attempted\
    \ to take\n   note of these exceptions, where they occur.\n   Section 1 - Per\
    \ item discussion\n   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability - The document\
    \ [1] indicates partial compliance,\n   largely in deference to the \"tens of\
    \ thousands of simultaneous\n   requests\" language in [3], that has been deprecated.\
    \  The issue of\n   simultaneous requests from a single AAA client is addressed\
    \ in [1],\n   indicating that the apparent limitation of 256 uniquely identifiable\n\
    \   outstanding request can be worked around using well known techniques,\n  \
    \ such as the source UDP port number of the request.  The document\n   claims\
    \ \"P\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over - The document [1] indicates\
    \ the use of application\n   level time outs to provide the fail-over mechanism.\
    \  Since the AAA\n   protocol is indeed an application-layer protocol, this seems\n\
    \   appropriate.  There are significant issues of how to handle fail-\n   over\
    \ in a proxy-chain environment that have not been well addressed,\n   however.\
    \  The document claims \"T\", and the evaluator awards \"P\".\n   1.1.3 Mutual\
    \ Authentication - The document [1] indicates that mutual\n   authentication exists\
    \ in the presence of a User-Password or CHAP-\n   Password attribute in an Access-Request\
    \ packet or the Message-\n   Authenticator [4] in any packet.  Once again, this\
    \ addresses hop-by-\n   hop authentication of RADIUS \"peers\", but does not fully\
    \ address\n   proxy-chain environments, in which trust models would need to be\n\
    \   established.  The document further indicates that strong mutual\n   authentication\
    \ could be achieved using the facilities of IPsec.  This\n   claim would apply\
    \ equally to all potential AAA protocols, and cannot\n   be fairly said to be\
    \ a property of the protocol itself.  The document\n   claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ awards \"F\".\n   1.1.4 Transmission Level Security - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that\n   transmission layer security, as defined in [3], is provided in the\n\
    \   protocol, using the mechanisms described in section 1.1.3.  It should\n  \
    \ be noted that this requirement is now a SHOULD in [3].  The document\n   claims\
    \ \"P\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality - The\
    \ document [1] indicates that\n   end-to-end confidentiality is not available\
    \ in RADIUS, but goes on to\n   say that it could be added.  The protocol [2]\
    \ actually makes an\n   attempt to specify how this is to be done, in section\
    \ 4.3.2.2 of [2],\n   using a CMS-data attribute, based in large part upon RFC\
    \ 2630.  The\n   evaluator has not, at this time, investigated the applicability\
    \ of\n   RFC 2630 to the AAA work.  The document claims \"F\", but in light of\n\
    \   the specifics of the protocol [2], the evaluator awards \"P\".\n   1.1.6 Data\
    \ Object Integrity - The document [1] indicates that end-\n   to-end integrity\
    \ is not available in RADIUS, but goes on to say that\n   it could be added. \
    \ The protocol [2] actually makes an attempt to\n   specify how this is to be\
    \ done, in section 4.3.2.1 of [2], using a\n   CMS-data attribute, based in large\
    \ part upon RFC 2630.  The evaluator\n   has not, at this time, investigated the\
    \ applicability of RFC 2630 to\n   the AAA work.  The document claims \"F\", but\
    \ in light of the specifics\n   of the protocol [2], the evaluator awards \"P\"\
    .\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport - The document [1] indicates that\n   certificate\
    \ transport is not available in RADIUS, but goes on to say\n   that it could be\
    \ added.  The protocol [2] actually makes an attempt\n   to specify how this is\
    \ to be done, in section 4.3.2.3 of [2], using a\n   CMS-data attribute, based\
    \ in large part upon RFC 2630.  The evaluator\n   has not, at this time, investigated\
    \ the applicability of RFC 2630 to\n   the AAA work.  Other relevant work in the\
    \ area of certificate support\n   in RADIUS may be found in an expired work in\
    \ progress, \"RADIUS X.509\n   Certificate Extensions\" [5].  The document claims\
    \ \"F\", but in light\n   of the specifics of the protocol [2], the evaluator\
    \ awards \"P\".\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that RADIUS\n   provides partial compliance with the requirements of the original\
    \ AAA\n   requirements document.  However, in [3], the requirement has been\n\
    \   simplified to \"resilience against packet loss\".  Once again, the\n   evaluator\
    \ finds that the protocol [2] meets this criteria on a hop-\n   by-hop basis,\
    \ but fails to effectively address these issues in a\n   proxy-chain environment.\
    \  The document claims \"P\", and the evaluator\n   awards \"F\".\n   1.1.9 Run\
    \ over IPv4 - RADIUS is widely deployed over IPv4.  The\n   document claims \"\
    T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.10 Run over IPv6 - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that adoption of a\n   limited number of new RADIUS attributes to support IPv6\
    \ is\n   straightforward.  Such discussion has transpired on the RADIUS WG\n \
    \  mailing list, although that WG is in the process of shutting down.\n   The\
    \ document claims \"P\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.11 Support Proxy and\
    \ Routing Brokers - The document [1] indicates\n   that RADIUS is widely deployed\
    \ in proxy-chains of RADIUS servers.\n   This is equivalent to the Proxy Broker\
    \ case, but the Routing Broker\n   case is a different requirement.  The protocol\
    \ [2] does not describe\n   any detail of how a Routing Broker might be accommodated,\
    \ although it\n   opens the door by indicating that the RADIUS++ protocol is peer-to-\n\
    \   peer, rather than client/server.  The document claims \"P\", and the\n   evaluator\
    \ awards \"F\".\n   1.1.12 Auditability - The document [1] indicates no compliance\
    \ with\n   this requirement.  The document claims \"F\", and the evaluator\n \
    \  concurs.\n   1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that\n   RADIUS may effectively skirt the requirement of application-layer\n\
    \   security by using a value of \"zero\" for the pre-shared secret.  While\n\
    \   this is a bit creative, it does seem to meet the requirement.  The\n   document\
    \ claims \"T\" and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.14 Ability to Carry Service\
    \ Specific Attributes - RADIUS has a\n   well defined Vendor-Specific Attribute,\
    \ which, when properly used,\n   does indeed provide for the ability to transport\
    \ service-specific\n   attributes.  The document claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ concurs.\n   1.2 Authentication Requirements\n   1.2.1 NAI Support - The document\
    \ [1] indicates that RADIUS specifies\n   the NAI as one of the suggested formats\
    \ for the User-Name attribute.\n   The document claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ agrees.\n   1.2.2 CHAP Support - CHAP support is widely deployed in RADIUS.\
    \  The\n   document claims [1] \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.2.3 EAP\
    \ Support - The document [1] indicates that EAP support in\n   RADIUS is specified\
    \ in [4].  The document claims [1] \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.2.4\
    \ PAP/Clear-text Passwords - The document [1] indicates that\n   RADIUS provides\
    \ protection of clear-text passwords on a hop-by-hop\n   basis.  The protocol\
    \ [2] indicates how additional data\n   confidentiality may be obtained in section\
    \ 4.3.2.2 of [2], using a\n   CMS-data attribute, based in large part upon RFC\
    \ 2630.  The evaluator\n   has not, at this time, investigated the applicability\
    \ of RFC 2630 to\n   the AAA work.  The document claims [1] \"F\", but in light\
    \ of the\n   specifics of the protocol [2], the evaluator awards \"P\".\n   1.2.5\
    \ Reauthentication on demand - The document [1] indicates that\n   RADIUS may\
    \ accomplish re-authentication on demand by means of an\n   Access-Challenge message\
    \ sent from a server to a client.  The\n   evaluator disagrees that this is likely\
    \ to work for a given session\n   once an Access-Accept message has been received\
    \ by the client.  The\n   document claims \"T\", and the evaluator awards \"F\"\
    .\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication - This requirement, as applied\n\
    \   to the protocol specification, mandates that non- necessary\n   authentication\
    \ credentials not be required in a request for\n   authorization.  The actual\
    \ decision to provide authorization in the\n   absence of any authentication resides\
    \ in the application (e.g. AAA\n   server).  RADIUS does require some form of\
    \ credential in request\n   messages.  The document [1] claims \"F\", and the\
    \ evaluator concurs.\n   1.3 Authorization Requirements\n   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic\
    \ IP Addr Assignment - The document [1]\n   indicates that RADIUS can assign IPv4\
    \ addresses, and can easily be\n   extended to assign IPv6 addresses (see section\
    \ 1.1.10).  Of greater\n   concern, however, is the issue of static vs. dynamic\
    \ addresses.  If\n   dynamic address has the same meaning as it does for DHCP,\
    \ then there\n   are issues of resource management that RADIUS has traditionally\
    \ not\n   addressed.  The document claims \"P\", and the evaluator concurs.\n\
    \   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability - The document [1] maintains that a\n   RADIUS++\
    \ to RADIUS gateway is pretty much a tautology.  The document\n   claims \"T\"\
    , and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability - The document [1] maintains\
    \ that RADIUS\n   Proxy Servers, and potentially RADIUS++ Routing Brokers, have\
    \ the\n   ability to reject requests based on local policy.  The document\n  \
    \ claims \"T\" and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling\
    \ - The document [1] indicates that\n   [6] defines support for layer two tunneling\
    \ in RADIUS.  The document\n   claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.5\
    \ Reauth on Demand - The document [1] indicates that RADIUS\n   provides this\
    \ feature by means of the Session-Timeout and\n   Termination- Action attributes.\
    \  While this may, in fact, be\n   sufficient to provide periodic re-authorization,\
    \ it would not provide\n   re- authorization on demand.  The protocol [2] does\
    \ not address this\n   further.  The document claims \"P\", and the evaluator\
    \ awards \"F\".\n   1.3.6 Support for ACLs - The document [1] describes the attributes\
    \ in\n   RADIUS that are used to convey the access controls described in [3].\n\
    \   Certain of these (e.g. QoS) are not currently defined in RADIUS, but\n   could\
    \ easily be defined as new RADIUS attributes.  The document\n   claims \"P\",\
    \ and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.7 State Reconciliation - The document [1]\
    \ addresses each of the\n   sub- items, as listed in the original AAA requirements\
    \ document.  In\n   reviewing the document against the modified requirements of\
    \ [3],\n   there is still an issue with server-initiated state reconciliation\n\
    \   messages.  While the protocol [2] makes provision for such messages,\n   as\
    \ servers are allowed to initiate protocol dialogs, no detailed\n   message formats\
    \ are provided.  This is an area that has traditionally\n   been a short coming\
    \ of RADIUS.  The document claims \"P\", and the\n   evaluator awards \"F\".\n\
    \   1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect - Much of the discussion from the\n   previous\
    \ section applies to this section.  The document [1] claims\n   \"F\", and the\
    \ evaluator concurs.\n   1.4 Accounting Requirements\n   1.4.1 Real Time Accounting\
    \ - RADIUS Accounting is widely deployed and\n   functions within the definition\
    \ of real time contained in [3].  The\n   document [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ concurs.\n   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding - RADIUS Accounting contains TLVs\n\
    \   for relevant accounting information, each of which is fairly compact.\n  \
    \ Note that the term \"bloated\" in [3] is somewhat subjective.  The\n   document\
    \ [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.3 Accounting Record Extensibility\
    \ - RADIUS Accounting may be\n   extended by means of new attributes or by using\
    \ the Vendor-Specific\n   attribute.  While it has been argued that the existing\
    \ attribute\n   number space is too small for the required expansion capabilities,\n\
    \   the protocol [2] addresses this problem in section 3.0, and its\n   subsections,\
    \ of [2].  The document [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.4.4\
    \ Batch Accounting - RADIUS has no explicit provisions for batch\n   accounting,\
    \ nor does the protocol [2] address how this feature might\n   be accomplished.\
    \  The document [1] claims \"F\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.4.5 Guaranteed\
    \ Delivery - RADIUS Accounting is widely deployed and\n   provides guaranteed\
    \ delivery within the context of the required\n   application-level acknowledgment.\
    \  The document [1] claims \"T\", and\n   the evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.6 Accounting\
    \ Timestamps - The document [1] indicates that this\n   feature is specified in\
    \ [4] as the Event-Timestamp attribute.  The\n   document claims [1] \"T\", and\
    \ the evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that this\n   requirement is partially met using the accounting interim update\n\
    \   message as specified in [4].  In addition, there was work in the\n   RADIUS\
    \ WG regarding session accounting extensions that has not been\n   included in\
    \ [4], i.e., some expired works in progress.  The document\n   claims [1] \"P\"\
    , and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n   1.5.1 Encoding\
    \ of MOBILE IP Registration Messages - The document [1]\n   claims \"F\", and\
    \ the evaluator concurs.\n   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly - The document [1] indicates\
    \ that RADIUS\n   deployment is know to have occurred in fire-walled environments.\
    \  The\n   document claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.5.3 Allocation\
    \ of Local Home Agent - The document [1] claims \"F\",\n   and the evaluator concurs.\n\
    \   2. Summary Discussion\n   The document [1] and the protocol [2] suffer from\
    \ having been written\n   in a short time frame.  While the protocol does provide\
    \ specific\n   guidance on certain issues, citing other relevant documents, it\
    \ is\n   not a polished protocol specification, with detailed packet format\n\
    \   diagrams.  There is a pool of prior work upon which the RADIUS++\n   protocol\
    \ may draw, in that many of the concepts of Diameter were\n   first postulated\
    \ as works in progress within the RADIUS WG, in an\n   attempt to \"improve\"\
    \ the RADIUS protocol.  All of these works in\n   progress have long since expired,\
    \ however.\n   3. General Requirements\n   RADIUS++ meets many of the requirements\
    \ of an AAA protocol, as it is\n   the current de facto and de jure standard for\
    \ AAA.  There are long-\n   standing deficiencies in RADIUS, which have been well\
    \ documented in\n   the RADIUS and NASREQ WG proceedings.  It is technically possible\
    \ to\n   revamp RADIUS to solve these problems.  One question that will be\n \
    \  asked, however, is:  \"What significant differences would there be\n   between\
    \ a finished RADIUS++ protocol and the Diameter protocol?\".\n   4. Summary Recommendation\n\
    \   Recommended in part.  What may possibly be learned from this\n   submission\
    \ is that it is feasible to have a more RADIUS-compliant\n   RADIUS-compatibility\
    \ mode in Diameter.\n"

    .\n   The document uses T to indicate total compliance, P to indicate\n   partial\
    \ compliance and F to indicate no compliance.\n   Evaluator's note : The Diameter\
    \ compliance document [8] claims Total\n   \"T\" compliance with all the requirements\
    \ except :  - 1.2.5 - 1.5.2\n   Section 1 - Per item discussion\n   1.1 General\
    \ Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability\n   Diameter is an evolution of RADIUS and\
    \ has taken into consideration\n   all the lessons learned over many years that\
    \ RADIUS has been in\n   service.  The use of SCTP as the transport protocol reduces\
    \ the need\n   for multiple proxy servers (Sec 3.1.1 Proxy Support of [1]) as\
    \ well\n   as removing the need for application level acks.  The use and support\n\
    \   of forwarding and redirect brokers enhances  scalability.  Evaluator\n   concurs\
    \ with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over\n   Again\
    \ with the use of SCTP, Diameter is able to detect disconnect\n   indications\
    \ upon which it switches to an alternate server (Sec 4.0\n   [6]).  Also Requests\
    \ and Responses do not have to follow the same\n   path and this increases the\
    \ reliability.  Evaluator concurs with the\n   \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n\
    \   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication\n   The compliance document quotes the use of\
    \ symmetric transforms for\n   mutual authentication between the client and server\
    \ (Sec 7.1 of\n   [6]).  The use of IPSec as an underlying security mechanism\
    \ and\n   thereby use the characteristics of IPSec itself to satisfy this\n  \
    \ requirement is also quoted.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance\
    \ on this requirement.\n   1.1.4 Transmission Level Security\n   Although this\
    \ requirement has been deprecated by the AAA evaluation\n   team the document\
    \ complies with it based on the definition (referring\n   to hop-by-hop security).\
    \  Section 7.1 of [6] provides the details of\n   how this is accomplished in\
    \ Diameter.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance on this requirement.\n\
    \   1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality\n   This requirement seems to have come\
    \ from Diameter.  Ref [7] explains\n   in detail the use of Cryptographic Message\
    \ Syntax (CMS) to achieve\n   data object confidentiality.  A CMS-Data AVP is\
    \ defined in [7].\n   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n\
    \   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity\n   Using the same argument as above and the hop-by-hop\
    \ security feature\n   in the protocol this requirement is completely met by Diameter.\n\
    \   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.1.7\
    \ Certificate Transport\n   Again with the use of the CMS-Data AVP, objects defined\
    \ as these\n   types of attributes allow the transport of certificates.  Evaluator\n\
    \   concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.1.8 Reliable\
    \ AAA Transport\n   Diameter recommends that the protocol be run over SCTP.  SCTP\n\
    \   provides the features described for a reliable AAA transport.\n   Although\
    \ the compliance is not a perfect fit for the definition of\n   this tag item,\
    \ it is close enough and the functionality achieved by\n   using SCTP is  the\
    \ same.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance\n   on this requirement.\n\
    \   1.1.9 Run over IPv4\n   Is an application layer protocol and does not depend\
    \ on the\n   underlying version of IP.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance\n\
    \   on this requirement.\n   1.1.10 Run over IPv6\n   Is an application layer\
    \ protocol and does not depend on the\n   underlying version of IP.  Evaluator\
    \ concurs with the \"T\" compliance\n   on this requirement.\n   1.1.11 Support\
    \ Proxy and Routing Brokers\n   Section 3.1.1/2 of the framework document [1]\
    \ provides an explanation\n   of how Diameter supports proxy and routing brokers.\
    \  In fact it\n   almost appears as though the requirement for a routing broker\
    \ came\n   from Diameter.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this\n\
    \   requirement.\n   1.1.12 Auditability\n   With the use of CMS-Data AVP [7]\
    \ a trail is created when proxies are\n   involved in the transaction.  This trail\
    \ can provide auditability.\n   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on\
    \ this requirement.\n   1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required\n   With the use of\
    \ IPSec as the underlying security mechanism, Diameter\n   does not require the\
    \ use of shared secrets for message\n   authentication.  Evaluator concurs with\
    \ the \"T\" compliance on this\n   requirement.\n   1.1.14 Ability to Carry Service\
    \ Specific Attributes\n   The base protocol [6] is defined by Diameter and any\
    \ one else can\n   define specific extensions on top of it.  Other WGs in the\
    \ IETF can\n   design an extension on the base protocol with specific attributes\
    \ and\n   have them registered by IANA.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n  \
    \ compliance on this requirement.\n   1.2 Authentication Requirements\n   1.2.1\
    \ NAI Support\n   The base protocol [6] defines an AVP that can be used to support\n\
    \   NAIs.  Diameter goes one step further by doing Message forwarding\n   based\
    \ on destination NAI AVPs.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance on\
    \ this requirement.\n   1.2.2 CHAP Support\n   Reference [2] section 3.0 describes\
    \ the support for CHAP.  Evaluator\n   concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this\
    \ requirement.\n   1.2.3 EAP Support\n   Reference [2] section 4.0 describes the\
    \ support for EAP.  Evaluator\n   concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n\
    \   1.2.4 PAP/Clear-text Passwords\n   Reference [2] section 3.1.1.1 describes\
    \ the support for PAP.\n   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this\
    \ requirement.\n   1.2.5 Reauthentication on demand\n   The use of Session-Timeout\
    \ AVP as the mechanism for reauthentication\n   is claimed by the compliance document.\
    \  However no direct references\n   explaining this in the base protocol [6] document\
    \ were found.\n   Evaluator deprecates the compliance on this to a \"P\"\n   Note:\
    \ However this is a trivial issue.\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication\n\
    \   Diameter allows requests to be sent without having any authentication\n  \
    \ information included.  A Request-type AVP is defined in [2] and it\n   can specify\
    \ authorization only without containing any authentication.\n   Evaluator concurs\
    \ with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.3 Authorization Requirements\n\
    \   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic IP Addr Assignment\n   The base protocol includes\
    \ an AVP for carrying the  address.\n   References [6.2.2 of 2] and [4.5 of 5]\
    \ provide detailed  explanations\n   of how this can be done.  Evaluator concurs\
    \ with the \"T\" compliance\n   on this requirement.\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway\
    \ Capability\n   One of the basic facets of Diameter is to support backward\n\
    \   compatibility and act as a RADIUS gateway in certain environments.\n   Evaluator\
    \ concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability\n\
    \   Based on the explanation provided in the compliance document for this\n  \
    \ requirement evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this\n   requirement.\n\
    \   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling\n   Ref [2] defines AVPs supporting L2 tunnels\
    \  Evaluator concurs with\n   the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.3.5\
    \ Reauth on Demand\n   A session timer defined in [6] is used for reauthorization.\
    \  However\n   Diameter allows reauthorization at any time.  Since this is a peer-\n\
    \   to-peer type of protocol any entity can initiate a reauthorization\n   request.\
    \  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance on this\n   requirement.\n   1.3.6\
    \ Support for ACLs\n   Diameter defines two methods.  One that supports backward\n\
    \   compatibility for RADIUS and another one with the use of a standard\n   AVP\
    \ with the filters encoded in it.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance\
    \ on this requirement.\n   1.3.7 State Reconciliation\n   A long explanation on\
    \ each of the points defined for this tag item in\n   the requirements document.\
    \  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance\n   for this requirement.\n   1.3.8\
    \ Unsolicited Disconnect\n   The base protocol [6] defines a set of session termination\
    \ messages\n   which can be used for unsolicited disconnects.  Evaluator concurs\n\
    \   with the \"T\" compliance on this requirement.\n   1.4 Accounting Requirements\n\
    \   1.4.1 Real Time Accounting\n   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance\
    \ based on explanations in\n   [4].\n   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding\n   Use\
    \ of Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF)-Record-AVP for\n   compact encoding\
    \ of accounting data.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance.\n   1.4.3\
    \ Accounting Record Extensibility\n   ADIF can be extended.  Evaluator concurs\
    \ with the \"T\" compliance.\n   1.4.4 Batch Accounting\n   Sec 1.2 of [4] provides\
    \ support for batch accounting.\n   1.4.5 Guaranteed Delivery\n   Sections 2.1/2\
    \ of [4] describe messages that are used to guarantee\n   delivery of accounting\
    \ records.  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\n   compliance.\n   1.4.6 Accounting\
    \ Timestamps\n   Timestamp AVP [6] is present in all accounting messages.  Evaluator\n\
    \   concurs with the \"T\" compliance.\n   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting\n   Interim\
    \ accounting records equivalent to a call-in-progress can be\n   sent periodically.\
    \  Evaluator concurs with the \"T\" compliance.\n   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n\
    \   1.5.1 Encoding of MOBILE IP Registration Messages\n   Ref [5] provides details\
    \ of how Diameter can encode MIP messages.\n   Evaluator concurs with the \"T\"\
    \ compliance.\n   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly\n   Some handwaving here and a possible\
    \ way of solving the firewall\n   problem with a Diameter proxy server.  Document\
    \ claims \"T\", evaluator\n   deprecates it to a \"P\"\n   1.5.3 Allocation of\
    \ Local Home Agent\n   Diameter can assign a local home agent in a visited network\
    \ in\n   conjunction with the FA in that network.  Evaluator concurs with the\n\
    \   \"T\"\n   Summary Recommendation\n   Diameter is strongly recommended as the\
    \ AAA protocol.  The experience\n   gained from RADIUS deployments has been put\
    \ to good use in the design\n   of this protocol.  It has also been designed with\
    \ extensibility in\n   mind thereby allowing different WGs to develop their own\
    \ specific\n   extension to satisfy their requirements.  With the use of SCTP\
    \ as the\n   transport protocol, reliability is built in.  Security has been\n\
    \   addressed in the design of the protocol and  issues that were\n   discovered\
    \ in RADIUS have been fixed.  Diameter also  is a session\n   based protocol which\
    \ makes it more scalable.  The support for\n   forwarding and redirect brokers\
    \ is well defined and  this greatly\n   improves the scalability aspect of the\
    \ protocol.\n   Lastly the protocol has been implemented by at least a few people\
    \ and\n   interop testing done.  This in itself is a significant step and a\n\
    \   positive point for Diameter to be the AAA protocol.\n"

  - "C.6 Diameter CON Evaluation\n   Evaluation of Diameter against the AAA Requirements\n\
    \   CON Brief\n   Evaluator: Barney Wolff\n   Section 1 - Per item discussion\n\
    \   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability - P (was T)  The evaluator\
    \ is concerned with\n   scalability to the small, not to the large.  Diameter/SCTP\
    \ may prove\n   difficult to retrofit to existing NAS equipment.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over\
    \ - P (was T)  SCTP gives an indication of peer\n   failure, but nothing in any\
    \ Diameter or SCTP document the evaluator\n   was able to find even mentions how\
    \ or when to switch back to a\n   primary server to which communication was lost.\
    \  After a failure, the\n   state machines end in a CLOSED state and nothing seems\
    \ to trigger\n   exit from that state.  It was not clear whether a server, on\n\
    \   rebooting, would initiate an SCTP connection to all its configured\n   clients.\
    \  If not, and in any case when the communication failure was\n   in the network\
    \ rather than in the server, the client must itself,\n   after some interval,\
    \ attempt to re-establish communication.  But no\n   such guidance is given.\n\
    \   Of course, the requirement itself fails to mention the notion of\n   returning\
    \ to a recovered primary.  That is a defect in the\n   requirement.  The evaluator\
    \ has had unfortunate experience with a\n   vendor's RADIUS implementation that\
    \ had exactly the defect that it\n   often failed to notice recovery of the primary.\n\
    \   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication - T\n   1.1.4 Transmission Level Security - T\n\
    \   1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality - P (was T).  Yes, the CMS data\n   type\
    \ is supported.  But the work in progress, \"Diameter Strong\n   Security Extension\"\
    , says:\n      Given that asymmetric transform operations are expensive, Diameter\n\
    \      servers MAY wish to use them only when dealing with inter-domain\n    \
    \  servers, as shown in Figure 3.  This configuration is normally\n      desirable\
    \ since Diameter entities within a given administrative\n      domain MAY inherently\
    \ trust each other.  Further, it is desirable\n      to move this functionality\
    \ to the edges, since NASes do not\n      necessarily have the CPU power to perform\
    \ expensive cryptographic\n      operations.\n   Given all the fuss that has been\
    \ made about \"end-to-end\"\n   confidentiality (which really means \"NAS-to-home_server\"\
    ), the\n   evaluator finds it absurd that the proposed solution is acknowledged\n\
    \   to be unsuited to the NAS.\n   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity - P (was T).  See\
    \ above.\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport - T\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport\

    \ Proxy and Routing Brokers - T\n   1.1.12 Auditability - T (based on our interpretation\
    \ as non-\n   repudiation, rather than the definition given in reqts)\n   1.1.13\

    \ Passwords - T\n   1.2.5 Reauthentication on demand - P (was T).  No mechanism\
    \ was\n   evident for the server to demand a reauthentication, based for\n   example\
    \ on detection of suspicious behavior by the user.  Session-\n   timeout is not\
    \ sufficient, as it must be specified at the start.\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o\
    \ Authentication - T\n   1.3 Authorization Requirements\n   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic\
    \ IP Addr Assignment - T\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability - P (was T).  RADIUS\
    \ has evolved from\n   the version on which Diameter was based.  EAP is a notable\
    \ case where\n   the convention that the Diameter attribute number duplicates\
    \ the\n   RADIUS one is violated.  No protocol, not even RADIUS++, can claim a\n\
    \   T on this.\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability - T (The evaluator fails to understand\
    \ how\n   any AAA protocol could rate anything other than T on this.)\n   1.3.4\
    \ Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling - T\n   1.3.5 Reauth on Demand - P (was T).  As with\
    \ reauthentication, there\n   is no evident mechanism for the server to initiate\
    \ this based on\n   conditions subsequent to the start of the session.\n   1.3.6\
    \ Support for ACLs - P (was T).  The evaluator finds the Filter-\n   Rule AVP\
    \ laughably inadequate to describe filters.  For example, how\n   would it deal\
    \ with restricting SMTP to a given server, unless all IP\n   options are forbidden\
    \ so the IP header length is known?  No real NAS\n   could have such an impoverished\
    \ filter capability, or it would not\n   survive as a product.\n   1.3.7 State\
    \ Reconciliation - P (was T).  It is difficult for the\n   evaluator to understand\
    \ how this is to work in a multi-administration\n   situation, or indeed in any\
    \ proxy situation.  Furthermore, SRQ with\n   no session-id is defined to ask\
    \ for info on all sessions, not just\n   those \"owned\" by the requester.\n \
    \  1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect - T\n   1.4 Accounting Requirements\n   1.4.1\
    \ Real Time Accounting - T\n   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding - T\n   1.4.3\
    \ Accounting Record Extensibility - T\n   1.4.4 Batch Accounting - P (was T).\
    \  The evaluator suspects that\n   simply sending multiple accounting records\
    \ in a single request is not\n   how batch accounting should or will be done.\n\
    \   1.4.5 Guaranteed Delivery - T\n   1.4.6 Accounting Timestamps - T  (The evaluator\
    \ notes with amusement\n   that NTP time cycles in 2036, not 2038 as claimed in\
    \ the Diameter\n   drafts.  It's Unix time that will set the sign bit in 2038.)\n\
    \   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting - T\n   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n   1.5.1 Encoding\
    \ of MOBILE IP Registration Messages - T\n   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly - F (was\
    \ T).  Until such time as firewalls\n   are extended to know about or proxy SCTP,\
    \ it is very unlikely that\n   SCTP will be passed.  Even then, the convenient\
    \ feature of being able\n   to send a request from any port, and get the reply\
    \ back to that port,\n   means that a simple port filter will not be sufficient,\
    \ and\n   statefulness will be required.  Real friendship would require that\n\
    \   both source and dest ports be 1812.\n   1.5.3 Allocation of Local Home Agent\
    \ - T\n   2. Summary Discussion\n   In some areas, Diameter is not completely\
    \ thought through.  In\n   general, real effort has gone into satisfying a stupendous\
    \ range of\n   requirements.\n   3. General Requirements\n   Diameter certainly\
    \ fails the KISS test.  With SCTP, the drafts add up\n   to 382 pages - well over\
    \ double the size of RADIUS even with\n   extensions.  The evaluator sympathizes\
    \ with the political instinct\n   when faced with a new requirement no matter\
    \ how bizarre, to say \"we\n   can do that\" and add another piece of filigree.\
    \  But the major places\n   where Diameter claims advantage over RADIUS, namely\
    \ \"end-to-end\"\n   confidentiality and resource management, are just the places\
    \ where\n   some hard work remains, if the problems are not indeed intractable.\n\
    \   More specifically, the evaluator sees no indication that specifying\n   the\
    \ separate transport protocol provided any advantage to defray the\n   large increase\
    \ in complexity.  Application acks are still required,\n   and no benefit from\
    \ the transport acks was evident to the evaluator.\n   Nor was there any obvious\
    \ discussion of why \"sequenced in-order\"\n   delivery is required, when AAA\
    \ requests are typically independent.\n   SCTP offers out-of-order delivery, but\
    \ Diameter seems to have chosen\n   not to use that feature.\n   Whether TLV encoding\
    \ or ASN.1/BER is superior is a religious\n   question, but Diameter manages to\
    \ require both, if the \"strong\"\n   extension is implemented.  The evaluator\
    \ has a pet peeve with length\n   fields that include the header, making small\
    \ length values invalid,\n   but that is a minor point.\n   Finally, interoperability\
    \ would be greatly aided by defining a\n   standard \"dictionary\" format by which\
    \ an implementation could adopt\n   wholesale a set of attributes, perhaps from\
    \ another vendor, and at\n   least know how to display them.  That is one of the\
    \ advantages of\n   MIBs.\n   4. Summary Recommendation\n   Diameter is clearly\
    \ close enough to meeting the myriad requirements\n   that it is an acceptable\
    \ candidate, though needing some polishing.\n   Whether the vast increase in complexity\
    \ is worth the increase in\n   functionality over RADIUS is debatable.\n"

    \   partial compliance and F to indicate no compliance.\n   Section 1 - Per item\
    \ discussion\n   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability - The document\
    \ [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over - The document\
    \ [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication\
    \ - The document claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.4 Transmission\
    \ Level Security - The document [1] indicates that\n   transmission layer security,\
    \ as defined in [3], is provided in the\n   protocol, using the mechanisms described\
    \ in [2].  It should be noted\n   that this requirement is now a SHOULD in [3].\
    \  The document claims\n   \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.5 Data Object\
    \ Confidentiality - The document [1] indicates that\n   end-to-end confidentiality\
    \ is provided using a CMS-data attribute,\n   based in large part upon RFC 2630.\
    \  The evaluator has not, at this\n   time, investigated the applicability of\
    \ RFC 2630 to the AAA work.\n   The document claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n\
    \   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity - The document [1] indicates that data\n   object\
    \ integrity is provided using a CMS-data attribute, based in\n   large part upon\
    \ RFC 2630.  The evaluator has not, at this time,\n   investigated the applicability\
    \ of RFC 2630 to the AAA work.  The\n   document claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ concurs.\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport - The document [1] indicates that\n\
    \   certificate transport is provided using a CMS-data attribute, based\n   in\
    \ large part upon RFC 2630 and RFC 1510.  The evaluator has not, at\n   this time,\
    \ investigated the applicability of RFC 2630 to the AAA\n   work.  The document\
    \ claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport -\
    \ The document [1] indicates that COPS\n   uses TCP, which certainly meets the\
    \ requirements for a reliable\n   transport.  The document claims \"T\", and the\
    \ evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.9 Run over IPv4 - The document [1] claims \"T\",\
    \ and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.1.10 Run over IPv6 - The document [1] claims\
    \ \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.1.11 Support Proxy and Routing Brokers\
    \ - Reasonable detail of proxy\n   operations is provided in [5].  The document\
    \ [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.12 Auditability - The\
    \ document [1] alludes to a History PIB that\n   would enable auditing without\
    \ explaining how it would work.  The AAA\n   Extension [5] does not provide additional\
    \ insight.  The document\n   claims \"T\", and the evaluator awards \"P\".\n \
    \  1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required - The document [1] claims \"T\" and\n   the\
    \ evaluator concurs.\n   1.1.14 Ability to Carry Service Specific Attributes -\
    \  The document\n   [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.2 Authentication\
    \ Requirements\n   1.2.1 NAI Support - The document [1] indicates that NAI is\
    \ to be\n   supported in the Information Model, but notes that for cases where\n\
    \   certificates are in use, the more restrictive syntax of RFC 2459\n   applies.\
    \  The document claims \"T\", and the evaluator awards \"P\".\n   1.2.2 CHAP Support\
    \ - The document [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n   1.2.3 EAP\
    \ Support - The document [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n  \
    \ 1.2.4 PAP/Clear-text Passwords - The document [1] indicates\n   compliance,\
    \ presumably using a CMS-data attribute, based in large\n   part upon RFC 2630.\
    \  The evaluator has not, at this time,\n   investigated the applicability of\
    \ RFC 2630 to the AAA work.  The\n   document claims \"T\", and the evaluator\
    \ concurs.\n   1.2.5 Reauthentication on demand - The document [1] claims \"T\"\
    , and\n   the evaluator concurs.\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication -\
    \ This requirement, as applied\n   to the protocol specification, mandates that\
    \ non- necessary\n   authentication credentials not be required in a request for\n\
    \   authorization.  The actual decision to provide authorization in the\n   absence\
    \ of any authentication resides in the application (e.g. AAA\n   server).  The\
    \ document [1] claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3 Authorization\
    \ Requirements\n   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic IP Addr Assignment -  The document\
    \ [1]\n   claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability\
    \ - The document [1] claims \"T\", and in\n   the absence of any detailed discussion\
    \ of how this is accomplished,\n   in either [1] or [5], the evaluator awards\
    \ \"P\".\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability - The document claims [1] \"T\" and the\n\
    \   evaluator concurs.\n   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling - The document [1]\
    \ claims \"T\", and\n   in the absence of any detailed discussion of how this\
    \ is\n   accomplished, in either [1] or [5], the evaluator awards \"P\".\n   1.3.5\
    \ Reauth on Demand -  The document [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n\
    \   1.3.6 Support for ACLs - The document [1] \"T\", and the evaluator\n   concurs.\n\
    \   1.3.7 State Reconciliation - The document [1] \"T\", and the evaluator\n \
    \  concurs.\n   1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect - The document [1] claims \"T\",\
    \ and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.4 Accounting Requirements\n   1.4.1 Real\
    \ Time Accounting -  The document [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n\
    \   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding - Note that the term \"bloated\" in\n   [3]\
    \ is somewhat subjective.  The document [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator\
    \ concurs.\n   1.4.3 Accounting Record Extensibility -  The document [1] claims\
    \ \"T\",\n   and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.4 Batch Accounting - The protocol\
    \ [2] [5] does not address how in\n   detail this feature might be accomplished.\
    \  The document [1] claims\n   \"T\", and the awards \"P\".\n   1.4.5 Guaranteed\
    \ Delivery - Guaranteed delivery is provided by TCP.\n   The document [1] claims\
    \ \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.6 Accounting Timestamps - The document\
    \ [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting\
    \ - The document [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n   1.5 MOBILE\
    \ IP Requirements\n   1.5.1 Encoding of MOBILE IP Registration Messages - The\
    \ document [1]\n   claims \"T\", and the evaluator concurs.\n   1.5.2 Firewall\
    \ Friendly - The document [1] claims \"T\", and the\n   evaluator concurs.\n \
    \  1.5.3 Allocation of Local Home Agent - The document [1] claims \"T\",\n   and\
    \ the evaluator concurs.\n   2. Summary Discussion\n   It may appear, upon initial\
    \ inspection, that the evaluator has not\n   lent a critical eye to the compliance\
    \ assertions of the document [1].\n   First, this memo is a \"PRO\" brief, and\
    \ as such reasonable benefit of\n   doubt is to be given in favor of the protocol\
    \ submission.  Second,\n   there is a fundamental conceptual issue at play.  The\
    \ COPS-PR model\n   provides a sufficient set of basic operations and commands,\
    \ a\n   stateful model, the ability for either \"peer\" to initiate certain\n\
    \   kinds of requests, as well as an extensible command set, to be able\n   to\
    \ support a wide variety of network and resource management\n   protocols.  The\
    \ details of protocol specific messages is left to\n   Policy Information Base\
    \ (PIB) data objects.  Since no AAA PIB has\n   been written, the evacuator can\
    \ only (optimistically) assess the\n   inherent capabilities of the base protocol\
    \ to accomplish the intended\n   requirements of [3], given a reasonable set of\
    \ assumptions about what\n   an AAA PIB might look like.\n   In some sense, this\
    \ akin to asserting that a given algorithm can be\n   correctly implemented in\
    \ a specific programming language, without\n   actually providing the code.\n\
    \   The PIB model used by COPS is a powerful and flexible model.  The\n   protocol\
    \ document [5] spends a considerable amount of time\n   enumerating and describing\
    \ the benefits of this data model, and\n   explaining its roots in Object Oriented\
    \ (OO) design methodology.\n   Analogies are made to class inheritance and class\
    \ containment, among\n   others.  It's always hard to say bad things about OO.\n\
    \   3. General Requirements\n   COPS-AAA would appear to meet (totally or partially)\
    \ all of the\n   requirements of [3], at least as can be determined without the\n\
    \   benefit of an AAA PIB.\n   4. Summary Recommendation\n   Recommended with\
    \ reservation.  Before final acceptance of COPS-AAA,\n   someone is going to have\
    \ to write the AAA PIB and evaluate its\n   details.\n"

    \ relevant.\n   Compliance: T==Total, P==Partial, F=Failed\n   Section 1 - Per\
    \ item discussion\n   Initial Note: [COPSComp] claims \"unconditional compliance\"\
    \ with all\n   requirements.\n   1.1 General Requirements\n   1.1.1 Scalability\
    \ - P (was T) The evaluator is concerned with\n   scalability of many always-on\
    \ TCP connections to a server supporting\n   a lot of clients, particularly with\
    \ the heartbeat messages.  The\n   claim that the request handle is \"unbounded\"\
    \ sounds fishy.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over - P (was T) COPS gives an indication of peer\
    \ failure,\n   and has mechanisms to restart state, but there seems to be a bias\n\
    \   toward a single state server.  COPS has decided that synchronizing\n   state\
    \ between multiple hot servers is out of scope.\n   Because COPS uses TCP, it\
    \ is at the mercy of the TCP timers of the\n   implementation which can be significant.\
    \  Connection timeout\n   reporting to the application may be delayed beyond the\
    \ client\n   authentication timeouts.  Tuning the Keep-Alive message to a tighter\n\
    \   period will increase the session and system overhead.\n   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication\
    \ - P (was T) The explanation is sort of\n   for message object integrity.  It\
    \ does not describe authentication\n   techniques.  The evaluator assumes that\
    \ COPS peers would authenticate\n   each other at Client-Open time.  But cannot\
    \ understand how this would\n   work if proxies are involved.\n   1.1.4 Transmission\
    \ Level Security - T\n   1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality - T  Seems almost a\
    \ carbon copy of\n   the Diameter capabilities.  This evaluator echoes the high\
    \ overhead\n   concerns of the Diameter evaluator for the CMS capability.  TLS\
    \ is\n   not mentioned here, but is piled on later.\n   1.1.6 Data Object Integrity\
    \ - T  See above.\n   1.1.7 Certificate Transport - T\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport\
    \ - T (maybe P) COPS meets this\n   requirement as well as any other protocol\
    \ we've evaluated.  That is\n   it does have one application level ACK.  Statements\
    \ such as \"TCP\n   provides guaranteed delivery\" are incorrect.  COPS does attempt\
    \ to\n   identify outages by using a keep-alive message between TCP peers.\n \
    \  1.1.9 Run over IPv4 - T\n   1.1.10 Run over IPv6 - T\n   1.1.11 Support Proxy\
    \ and Routing Brokers - P (was T)  How client\n   types are supported forward\
    \ is not well understood by this evaluator.\n   Does each client type require\
    \ the Broker to make a different client\n   Open request to it's upstream servers?\
    \  What about routing brokers?\n   1.1.12 Auditability - P (was T)  (based on\
    \ our interpretation as\n   non-repudiation, rather than the definition given\
    \ in reqts) The\n   explanation of a History PIB is incomplete and therefore\n\
    \   inconclusive.\n   1.1.13 Shared Secret Not Required - T  Except this clause\
    \ in\n   [COPSAAA] 6.2 page 14 \"COPS MUST be capable of supporting TLS\"\n  \
    \ 1.1.14 Ability to Carry Service Specific Attributes - P (was T)\n   a) COPS\
    \ only allows a small number of unique objects to be added.\n      256 Object\
    \ \"classes\" or types, with 256 subtypes or versions.\n      Client types are\
    \ 16 bits long, where the high bit indicates\n      \"enterprise\" specific values.\
    \  But pertain to a COPS peer-\n      connection session.  The client type seems\
    \ to just identify the\n      information model for the message. eg. it will be\
    \ fixed to one\n      value for AAA.\n   b) Service specific objects are not the\
    \ same as Vendor Specific\n      Objects.  They pertain to objects within a client\
    \ type.\n   c) The PIB model leads to a different model interoperability.\n  \
    \    Because most vendor product differ in some way, each PIB will be\n      different,\
    \ and sharing common provisioning profiles will be a\n      rather difficult mapping\
    \ problem on the server.\n   d) It's not clear the different client types can\
    \ be mixed or that\n      other objects definitions can be used from other defined\
    \ client\n      types.  It's really unclear how the client type of a connection\n\
    \      propagates in a proxy situation.\n   1.2 Authentication Requirements\n\
    \   1.2.1 NAI Support - T  The requirement that RFC 2459 (X.509 profiles)\n  \
    \ be met presumes that Auth servers would not have a mapping or local\n   transformation.\n\
    \   1.2.2 CHAP Support - T  An Information Model is being invoked, which\n   I\
    \ don't see really fleshed out anywhere.  [COPSAAA] does a bit of\n   handwaving\
    \ and definitions but doesn't deliver much meat.\n   Nonetheless, this could be\
    \ handled ala RADIUS.\n   1.2.3 EAP Support - P (was T)  Again with the non-existent\n\
    \   Information Model.  To do EAP, this evaluator thinks another Request\n   or\
    \ Decision type is needed here to indicate to proxies that an\n   extended message\
    \ exchange is in progress.\n   1.2.4 PAP/Clear-text Passwords - T\n   1.2.5 Reauthentication\
    \ on demand - T\n   1.2.6 Authorization w/o Authentication - T\n   The comment\
    \ \"Please note: with existing algorithms, any authorization\n   scheme not based\
    \ on prior authentication is meaningless\" is\n   meaningless out of application\
    \ context.\n   1.3 Authorization Requirements\n   1.3.1 Static and Dynamic IP\
    \ Addr Assignment - T\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway Capability - P (was T).  It would\
    \ be interesting\n   to see RADIUS attributes wrapped in some COPS \"Information\
    \ Model\".\n   1.3.3 Reject Capability - T\n   1.3.4 Preclude Layer 2 Tunneling\
    \ - T\n   More work for the \"Information Model\" author!\n   1.3.5 Reauthorization\
    \ on Demand - T\n   1.3.6 Support for Access Rules & Filters - P (was T)  Yet\
    \ more work\n   for the \"Information Model\" author, including some design issues\n\
    \   which alluded the RADIUS and Diameter designers.  At least an attempt\n  \
    \ was made in Diameter.  There is nothing here.\n   1.3.7 State Reconciliation\
    \ - P (was T).  It is difficult for the\n   evaluator to understand how well the\
    \ COPS mechanisms work in a\n   multi-administration situation, or in any proxy\
    \ situation.  Multi-\n   server coordination, if allowed, seems to be lacking\
    \ a description.\n   1.3.8 Unsolicited Disconnect - T\n   1.4 Accounting Requirements\n\
    \   1.4.1 Real Time Accounting - T\n   1.4.2 Mandatory Compact Encoding - T  This\
    \ evaluator does not believe\n   that ADIF is a compact format.  But does believe\
    \ that the Information\n   Model author can design a PIB with accounting statistics\
    \ that will\n   satisfy this requirement.\n   1.4.3 Accounting Record Extensibility\
    \ - P (was T)  By defining a\n   vendor/device specific PIB for additional elements.\n\
    \   1.4.4 Batch Accounting - P (was T)  Offered description does not seem\n  \
    \ to match the requirement.\n   1.4.5 Guaranteed Delivery - P (was T)  TCP does\
    \ NOT \"guarantee\n   delivery\", only application Acks can do that.  If these\
    \ acks can be\n   generated similar to the description here, then this requirement\
    \ is\n   met.\n   1.4.6 Accounting Timestamps - T  Another item for the \"Information\n\
    \   Model\" author.\n   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting - T  Event and interim accounting\
    \ can be\n   supported.\n   1.5 MOBILE IP Requirements\n   1.5.1 Encoding of MOBILE\
    \ IP Registration Messages - P (was T)  Yet\n   more work for the \"Information\
    \ Model\" author.  Hope he can handle it.\n   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly - P (was\
    \ T)  I guess.  Because it uses TCP\n   and can be identified by known connection\
    \ port.  But there is an\n   issue with respect to the impact level of mixed COPS\
    \ traffic coming\n   through a common firewall port.\n   1.5.3 Allocation of Local\
    \ Home Agent - P (was T)  Just add another\n   element to that \"Information Model\"\
    \ definition.\n   2. Summary Discussion\n   COPS was designed to do some things\
    \ similar to what we want and be\n   somewhat flexible, but with a totally different\
    \ set of assumptions on\n   how many clients and requests would be funneled through\
    \ the\n   infrastructure and the acceptable overhead.  This evaluator is not\n\
    \   sure that it scales well to the fast evolving access market where\n   every\
    \ product doesn't implement a small set of common features, but a\n   large set\
    \ of overlapping ones.\n   3. General Requirements\n   COPS started out with small\
    \ and easily met set of design goals for\n   RSVP and DiffServe, and is evolving\
    \ as a new hammer to hit other\n   nails [COPSPR].  As COPS implementors get more\
    \ operational\n   experience, it is interesting to see more reliability fixes/features\n\
    \   quickly get patched in.\n   Understanding COPS requires that you read a number\
    \ RFCs and drafts\n   which do not readily integrate well together.  Each application\
    \ of\n   COPS has spawned a number of drafts.  It's not clear if one wants to\n\
    \   or can implement a single COPS server that can service AAA and other\n   application\
    \ clients.\n   The COPS authors seem to overly believe in the goodness of TCP,\
    \ and\n   rely on it to solve all their transport problems, with concessions to\n\
    \   application keep-alive messages to probe the connection status and\n   sequence\
    \ numbers to prevent replay attacks.  This evaluator believes\n   this type of\
    \ approach may work for many networks but really doesn't\n   scale well in larger\
    \ configurations.  End-to-end application acks are\n   the only guaranteed delivery\
    \ solution, particularly where distributed\n   state is involved.\n   COPS falls\
    \ into an in between place on encoding.  It has small number\n   of simple data\
    \ object blobs which are concatenated ala\n   RADIUS/Diameter TLVs to form a flexible\
    \ message layout.  However,\n   they attempt to limit the number of objects by\
    \ making them\n   arbitrarily complex ala SNMP MIBs, and defining yet another\
    \ data\n   structuring language for these PIBs.  There is a lot of computer\n\
    \   science style grandstanding in [COPSAAA] Section 1.2, but no\n   translation\
    \ into how a set of data objects can be used to meet these\n   wonderful features\
    \ in operation.  (or even if we needed them) This\n   will be the crux of the\
    \ interoperability issue.  RADIUS\n   implementations interoperate because they\
    \ at least, understand a\n   common set of functional attributes from the RFCs.\
    \  And vendor extent\n   ions can be simply customized in as needed via dictionaries.\
    \  If PIB\n   definitions are needed for every piece and version of access\n \
    \  equipment, before you can use it, then the bar for ease of\n   configuration\
    \ and use has been raised quite high.\n   Support for PIB definition and vendor\
    \ extensions will be on the same\n   order as MIB integration in SNMP management\
    \ products and put the\n   supposed complexity of Diameter to shame.\n   4. Summary\
    \ Recommendation\n   COPS has a structure that could be made to serve as a AAA\
    \ protocol,\n   perhaps by just copying the features of RADIUS and Diameter into\
    \ it.\n   The author of [COPSAAA] and [COPSComp] has not done the whole job yet\n\
    \   and some of the missing pieces are vexing even for those already in\n   the\
    \ field.\n   While some of the synergy with other COPS services is attractive,\n\
    \   this evaluator is concerned about the liabilities of combining AAA\n   services\
    \ with the new emerging COPS applications in a single server\n   entity will introduce\
    \ more complexity than needed and opportunities\n   to have progress pulled into\
    \ other rat-holes. (eg. Policy Frameworks)\n"

  - "D.1  Minutes of 22-Jun-2000 Teleconference\n   Recorded by: Mark Stevens\n  \
    \ Arguments for and against SNMP as an AAA protocol were given.  Stuart\n   Barkley\
    \ gave a summary of the pro argument.  Mike St. Johns gave a\n   summary of the\
    \ con argument.  Dave Nelson asked for \"instructions to\n   the jury\" in an\
    \ effort to determine what evidence could and could not\n   be used in making\
    \ decisions.\n   The AAA evaluation criteria is weak in some areas and in others\
    \ it\n   appears to be written with what might be interpreted as undue\n   influence\
    \ from the NASREQ working group.\n   Mike St. Johns offered that we must restrict\
    \ ourselves to considering\n   only the evidence provided in the compliance documents\
    \ and any\n   supporting documents to which they may refer.\n   In summary: AAA\
    \ evaluation criteria document, AAA evaluation criteria\n   source documents,\
    \ protocol response documents and reference\n   documents.\n   The question as\
    \ to what the group should do with malformed\n   requirements came up.  The consensus\
    \ seemed to be that we would use\n   the requirements as adjusted in our last\
    \ meeting where the\n   requirements made no sense.\n   The floor was then given\
    \ to Stuart Barkley for the pro SNMP argument.\n   Highlights:\n   *  In most\
    \ areas the requirements are met by SNMP.\n   *  Confidentiality and Certificate\
    \ transport mechanisms may be weak,\n      but workable.\n   *  With regard to\
    \ Authentication, every technique can be supported\n      although support for\
    \ PAP or cleartext passwords is weak.\n   *  With regard to Authorization, there\
    \ is nothing in the requirements\n      that cannot be supported.\n   *  Accounting\
    \ everything supported, although there is no specific\n      consideration for\
    \ compact encoding.  SNMP not as bloated as ASCII\n      or XML based encoding\
    \ schemes.  Requirement for compact encoding\n      weakly indicated in requirements\
    \ anyway.  Server-specific\n      attributes needed, but compact encoding preclude\
    \ w/o tradeoffs.\n   *  With regard to mobile IP requirement, everything works\
    \ well,\n      although firewall friendliness is a judgment call.\n   *  Proxy\
    \ mechanisms of SNMPv3 mitigates problems w/ firewalls.\n   *  Scalability is\
    \ ok.\n   *  Overall, meets most requirements and shortfalls are minor.\n   *\
    \  In some cases requirements seemed to expressed in a manner that\n      \"stacks\"\
    \ the odds against SNMP.\n   *  SNMP is deployed everywhere already.\n   *  The\
    \ protocol has a well-understood behavior despite the tedium of\n      MIB definition,\
    \ so it has the advantage of not requiring the\n      creation of a new infrastructure.\n\
    \   *  AAA response document is silent on architecture and MIB\n      definition,\
    \ but there is too much work to do at this stage of\n      evaluation.  Not having\
    \ done the MIB definitions and architecture\n      is not a limitation of the\
    \ protocol.\n   *  SNMP is a good candidate.\n   Mike St. Johns took the floor\
    \ to give a summary of the con argument.\n   *  Neither the requirements, core\
    \ documents nor response document\n      specify the mechanism of operation.\n\
    \   *  Liberties were taken in the assertion that the server to server\n     \
    \ interaction requirements were met.\n   *  The scaling arguments are weak.\n\
    \   *  Fail-over arguments are weak.\n   *  Security aspects work well with the\
    \ manager/server paradigm, but\n      not well in bidirectional interactions among\
    \ peers.\n   *  The authentication requirements not understood by authors of the\n\
    \      response document.  *  SNMP is just data moving protocol.\n   *  Message\
    \ formats not specified.\n   *  What is the method for supporting authentication?\
    \ Storing the\n      information is handled, but what do the nodes do with it?\n\
    \   *  The protocol certainly shined in the area of meeting accounting\n     \
    \ requirements.\n   *  Although SNMP could certainly play a role in the accounting\
    \ space,\n      it is unusable in the areas of Authorization and Authentication.\n\
    \   *  The response document does not address how the problem will be\n      solved.\n\
    \   *  It does not address the scalability issues that may arise in the\n    \
    \  transition from a manager-agent mode of operation to a client-\n      server\
    \ model.\n   The group then examined each requirement against SNMP in a line-by-\n\
    \   line exercise.\n"

    \ Dave Mitton, Dave Nelson, Mark\n   Stevens, Barney Wolff, Stuart Barkley, Steven\
    \ Crain, Basavaraj Patil)\n   Minutes recorded by : Basavaraj Patil\n   Evaluation\
    \ of RADIUS++ AAA Requirements\n   Pro : Mark Stevens\n   Con : Dave Nelson\n\
    \   -  Question raised on if all meetings held so far have been recorded.\n  \
    \    Last week's meeting was recorded by Mark.  Previous meetings have\n     \
    \ been recorded by Mike.  All of these minutes should be available\n      in the\
    \ archive.\n   -  Dave Nelson mentioned that Pat Calhoun has responded on the\
    \ AAA WG\n      mailing list to the changes made to the requirements document\
    \ by\n      the evaluation team.  Pat's response includes arguments for\n    \
    \  inclusion of some of the requirements that were deleted by the\n      eval\
    \ team.\n   -  Mike concluded that we can reinstate these requirements after\n\
    \      reviewing Pat's comments in detail and the RFCs referenced.  The\n    \
    \  intent is to take Pat's comments/document and review it between\n      now\
    \ and next Thursday (July 6th) and integrate the comments based\n      on the\
    \ findings at that time.\n   Voting Procedure for evaluation : No voting during\
    \ the discussion.\n   All votes MUST be submitted to Mike by COB, June 28th, 00.\n\
    \   -  Dave Nelson's summary of the Con statement for RADIUS++.\n      Overview\
    \ of the points on which the evaluator disagrees with the\n      compliance statement.\n\
    \      Conclusion from Dave : Not recommended (Details in the con\n      statement).\n\
    \      Q: Is it possible to use it for accounting?\n      A: Authentication and\
    \ Authorization could be separated, but\n      Accounting is the weak link in\
    \ this protocol and hence is not\n      suitable.\n   -  Mark Steven's summary\
    \ of the Pro statement\n      Agreed with most of the observations made by Dave\
    \ Nelson.  The\n      biggest thing going for it is that it has been running in\
    \ this\n      environment for a while and it does meet most of the requirements\n\
    \      in the document.  Transition will be easy and backwards\n      compatibility\
    \ is a key plus point.\n   Point-by-point Discussion:\n   General (1.1):\n   1.1.1\
    \ Scalability\n   BW - There is no actual limit on the number of outstanding requests.\n\
    \   The protocol itself does not limit the number.\n   DN -Simultaneous requests\
    \ is not the same as outstanding requests.\n   Discussion of workarounds that\
    \ have been implemented to overcome this\n   problem.\n   1.1.2 Fail-over\n  \
    \ DN - This is an application layer protocol and uses application level\n   time-outs\
    \ to provide fail-over solutions.  Analogy and discussion on\n   the use of round-trip-timer\
    \ in TCP.\n   Example of how robust a network can be based on a machine at MIT\
    \ that\n   was decommissioned and a new one with the same name installed in the\n\
    \   network.\n   Discussion of environments where proxies for primary, secondary\
    \ and\n   tertiaries exist and the possible effect of flooding messages in the\n\
    \   event of a fail-over detection.\n   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication\n   No Discussion.\
    \  Accepted as stated.\n   1.1.4 Transmission level security\n   This requirement\
    \ was deleted from the list by the evaluation team.\n   It was deleted because\
    \ it is an overgeneralization of Roam Ops.\n   DN - There is a concern regarding\
    \ what this really means.  Referred\n   to what Pat is saying about this on the\
    \ list and the need for it to\n   be reinstated.\n   Suggestion to change the\
    \ tag in the requirements document to hop-by-\n   hop security.\n   Does the Roamops\
    \ group use transmission level security to imply hop-\n   by-hop security?\n \
    \  1.1.5 Data Object Confidentiality\n   Mike explained the concept of Cryptographic\
    \ Message Syntax (CMS -\n   RFC2630).  There are some issues regarding the use\
    \ of CMS at an end\n   point.  Symmetric or Asymmetric keys can be used.\n   There\
    \ does not seem to be a problem with the suggested usage of CMS\n   in RADIUS++.\n\
    \   1.1.6/7 Data Object Integrity/Certificate Transport\n   No discussion.  (I\
    \ guess everyone concurs with the statement in the\n   compliance document and\
    \ the reviewers comments).\n   1.1.8 Reliable AAA Transport\n   BW - Radius provides\
    \ reliability at the application layer by doing\n   retransmissions.  So why is\
    \ there a need for a reliable AAA transport\n   protocol?\n   - Is it packet loss\
    \ that the protocol needs to be concerned about?\n   DN - This requirement is\
    \ tied to the failover issue.  Explanation of\n   the negative impact of retransmissions\
    \ in a network, especially in\n   the case of a web of proxies.\n   Conclusion\
    \ is that this requirement deals with packet loss.\n   1.1.9/10 Run over IPv4/6\n\
    \   Running over IPv6 should be a trivial issue.\n   1.1.11 Support Proxy and\
    \ Routing Brokers\n   -  Discussion on what this requirement means and analogy\
    \ to DNS\n      servers in a network.\n   -  RADIUS can be extended to support\
    \ this requirement and from the\n      compliance document this does not appear\
    \ to be fully cooked yet.\n   1.1.12 Auditability\n   No Discussion\n   1.1.13\
    \ Shared Secret Not Required\n   This seems to be a trivial issue to be addressed\
    \ in RADIUS++.\n   1.1.14 Ability to carry Service Specific Attributes\n   No\
    \ Discussion\n   Authentication Requirements:\n   1.2.1 NAI Support\n   Trivial\
    \ - Total compliance.\n   1.2.2 CHAP Support\n   Comment : RADIUS support of CHAP\
    \ could be better and the response\n   needs to be encrypted.\n   1.2.3/4 EAP/PAP\n\
    \   No Discussion\n   1.2.5 Reauthentication on Demand\n   DN - Document claims\
    \ that the server can reauthenticate by issuing an\n   Access-challenge.  There\
    \ is a change to the state machine and the\n   suggested solution is too simplistic.\
    \  Also backwards compatibility\n   would be an issue.\n   1.2.6 Authorization\
    \ w/o Authentication\n   DN - This is trivial to fix, but this is not mentioned\
    \ in the\n   compliance document.\n   Authorization Requirements:\n   1.3.1 Static\
    \ and Dynamic IP Addr assignment\n   -  RADIUS does not rise to the demands of\
    \ being a resource manager\n   -  RADIUS assigns an address and it stays assigned\
    \ for the session.\n      There is no concept of leasing.\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway\
    \ Capability\n   This is a requirement written that is not applicable to RADIUS\n\
    \   itself.\n   1.3.3/4/5/6/7/8\n   Call dropped.  Somebody else needs to fill\
    \ in here.  (Mike ????)\n   Accounting Requirements:\n   1.4.1 Real time accounting\n\
    \   No dissent.  No discussion\n   1.4.2 Mandatory compact encoding\n   Comment\
    \ made regarding ASN.1 and XML in this context\n   1.4.3 Accounting Record Extensibility\n\
    \   No discussion\n   1.4.4 Batch Accounting\n   No specific wording in the document\
    \ to show how this can be done.\n   Basically it is real time accounting without\
    \ the real time\n   constraint.\n   It may be a trivial issue.\n   1.4.5/6 Guaranteed\
    \ Delivery/Accounting Timestamps\n   No Discussion\n   1.4.7 Dynamic Accounting\n\
    \   There is ongoing discussion in the AAA WG on this requirement.  The\n   RADIUS\
    \ WG is also discussing this (comment).  The idea here is to be\n   able to send\
    \ the equivalent of a phonecall in progress type of\n   messages.\n   Mobile IP\
    \ Requirements:\n   1.5.1 Encoding of Mobile IP Reg. Messages\n   May be trivial.\
    \  Discussion on what this requirement really is.  Is\n   it just the ability\
    \ to carry the reg. message as payload? Does the\n   AAA protocol have to delve\
    \ into the reg. message and behave\n   differently.\n   1.5.2 Firewall Friendly\n\
    \   No Discussion\n   1.5.3 Allocation of Local Home Agents\n   This concept needs\
    \ to be clarified as the author writing the\n   compliance statement did not understand\
    \ it either.\n   If you notice anything that I recorded here as something\n  \
    \ misinterpreted, please feel free to make corrections.\n"

    \ model.\n      No apparent showstoppers.\n      Will resend review with typos\
    \ corrected.\n   Con review of COPS - Dave Mitton\n      Architecture is mostly\
    \ there.\n      Strong dependency on info model, sceptical of object model.\n\
    \      Problem with info model in multi-vendor, multi-administration\n      environment.\n\
    \      How does server speak to multiple client flavors?\n      Will resend review\
    \ with typos corrected.\n   Comment by Mike StJ \"replace SNMP with COPS\" - :)\
    \ I think.\n   Per-Item discussion\n   1.1.1 Scalability - concern re always-on\
    \ TCP.  Direction to DM - add\n   general issue of number of connections.\n  \
    \ 1.1.2 Failover - No hot backup, but true of all protocols.  (ie, no\n   explicit\
    \ mention of server-server protocol that might keep a backup\n   server in sync\
    \ so it could take over instantly.)\n   1.1.3 Mutual Authentication - perhaps\
    \ relies on TLS.  Draft does not\n   otherwise support this.\n   1.1.8 Reliable\
    \ AAA Transport - TCP + appl heartbeat.\n   1.1.11 Proxy & Routing Brokers - client-type\
    \ interaction with proxy\n   is questionable.  (In later discussion, it appears\
    \ client-type is a\n   field in the request, and perhaps all AAA is one type,\
    \ so may not be\n   an issue.)\n   1.1.13 Shared secret not req'd - runs over\
    \ TLS, no multiple levels of\n   security.\n   1.2.1 NAI Support - some uncertainty\
    \ on the impact of RFC 2459 (X.509\n   profiles) on this - may restrict NAI in\
    \ some way?\n   1.2.3 EAP Support - multi-pass handshake needs work.\n   1.2.6\
    \ Authorization without Authentication - Mike comments the\n   requirement is\
    \ broken.  BW comment (post-meeting) - the requirement\n   appears intended specifically\
    \ to chastise RADIUS for requiring User-\n   Name and some sort of password in\
    \ an Access-Request, even if it's\n   sent pre-connect, on receipt of DNIS, for\
    \ example.  Sure it's silly,\n   but does it really matter whether an attribute\
    \ is absent or filled\n   with \"NONE\"?  This was just nasty sniping at RADIUS\
    \ on somebody's\n   part, imho.\n   1.3.2 RADIUS Gateway - skepticism was expressed.\n\
    \   1.3.4 Preclude L2 Tunnels - too much handwaving.\n   1.3.6 Access Rules -\
    \ lots of work needed.\n   1.3.7 State Reconciliation - multi-server coordination\
    \ is an issue.\n   1.4.4 Batch Accounting - for small batches, perhaps.\n   1.4.5\
    \ Guaranteed Delivery - application acks are an area of mystery.\n   1.5.2 Firewall-Friendly\
    \ - COPS like any Swiss-Army-Knife protocol\n   (SNMP) requires the firewall to\
    \ look inside the packets, because\n   passing AAA may be allowed but not other\
    \ protocol uses.  So it would\n   be a big help, for both COPS and SNMP, to define\
    \ a different port for\n   its AAA application.\n"

  - "D.5  Minutes of 11-Jul-2000 Teleconference\n   Present:  Mike, Bernard, Paul,\
    \ Bert, Raj, Dave N., Dave M., Barney,\n   Stuart, Mark\n   Recorded By: Dave\
    \ Nelson\n   Mike St. Johns set the ground rules.\n   An item by item review of\
    \ the summary results was held.\n   1.1.1 Question as to why SNMP and RADIUS++\
    \ are \"P\"?  There are issues\n   regarding scaling of retries in a web of proxies\
    \ (multi-layer proxy;\n   primary, secondary tertiary servers at each level).\n\
    \   1.1.2 No protocol did very well.  Similar issues as above, e.g. web\n   of\
    \ proxies.  Recovery of state from a previously failed primary\n   server?\n \
    \  1.1.3 Question as to how serious is the need for this requirement?\n   May\
    \ be some legitimate requirements from Mobile IP.  Is this\n   requirement an\
    \ AAA-level issue?\n   1.1.4 Called hop-by-hop or transmission level?\n   1.1.5\
    \ Most protocols evaluated used CMS to meet this requirement.\n   Question as\
    \ to applicability of CMS for NASes and other edge devices?\n   There is a requirement\
    \ for object by object confidentiality.\n   consider three-party scenarios.\n\
    \   1.1.6 Question as to why SNMP did not rate the same as for item\n   1.1.5?\
    \  The evaluation is based on what was contained in the\n   submission documents,\
    \ rather than capabilities of the protocol\n   itself.  Too much hand waving.\n\
    \   1.1.7 No comments.\n   1.1.8 Question as to meaning of \"reliable\"?  Discussion\
    \ of transport\n   protocols was deferred to later in the meeting.\n   1.1.9 No\
    \ comments.\n   1.1.10 SNMP received \"P\" because of hand waving in the submission\n\
    \   documents.\n   1.1.11 SNMP received \"F\" because this section of the submission\n\
    \   document indicated \"t.b.d.\".  Diameter was the only protocol\n   submission\
    \ to completely address this item.\n   1.1.12 We treated this requirement as \"\
    non-repudiation\".  There is a\n   concern that digital signatures are computationally\
    \ expensive and are\n   not globally available.  COPS has more work to do on this\
    \ item.\n   1.1.13 Question that \"no shared secrets\" should be interpreted to\n\
    \   mean that an alternative key management mechanism is available?  We\n   treated\
    \ this as meaning that application-layer security could be\n   turned off in deference\
    \ to transport layer security.  There had been\n   discussion of the use of IKE\
    \ in the AAA protocol.\n   1.1.14 No comments.\n   1.2.1 No comments.\n   1.2.2\
    \ No comments.\n   1.2.3 No comments.\n   1.2.4 Is there a need for a clear-text\
    \ \"password\" for service such as\n   OTP, SecurID, et. al.?   It was noted that\
    \ all plain passwords are\n   exposed in clear-text at the NAS or other edge device,\
    \ which is no\n   more inherently trustworthy than any AAA server or proxy.\n\
    \   1.2.5 We distinguished event-driven reauthentication from timer-\n   driven\
    \ (or lifetime-driven).  How is this requirement to be met in a\n   proxy environment?\n\
    \   1.2.6 We asserted that this requirement is an oxymoron.\n   1.3.1 We had difficulty\
    \ in determining what \"static\" meant, and from\n   which reference point it\
    \ was measured.\n   1.3.2 We agreed that NAIs could be handled, possibly with\
    \ some\n   restrictions.\n   1.3.3 No comment.\n   1.3.4 The SNMP submission documents\
    \ contained significant hand\n   waving.\n   1.3.5 Similar comments as to item\
    \ 1.2.5.  The question was raised as\n   to how the server knows when to send\
    \ this request?\n   1.3.6 We found that the notation in Diameter was weak, and\
    \ of a least\n   common denominator nature.  In general, there was concern about\n\
    \   achieving interoperability when the syntax was standardized but the\n   semantics\
    \ were not.  This area needs further work.\n   1.3.7 Question as to how this requirement\
    \ is achieved via proxies?\n   1.4.1 No comment.\n   1.4.2 No comment.\n   1.4.3\
    \ No comment.\n   1.4.4 There was significant skepticism regarding batch accounting\
    \ as\n   part of the AAA protocol.  How large are the \"batches\"?  Should this\n\
    \   requirement be met using FTP or something similar?\n   1.4.5 No comment.\n\
    \   1.4.6 No comment.\n   1.4.7 No comment.\n   1.5.1 No comment.\n   1.5.2 There\
    \ was some discussion of what constitutes firewall\n   friendly.  It was suggested\
    \ that the firewall didn't want to look\n   into packets much past the application\
    \ protocol address (e.g. UDP or\n   TCP port number).  Protocols such as SNMP\
    \ and COPS that have usage\n   other than AAA are at a disadvantage, since the\
    \ firewall must look\n   deep into the application PDU to determine the intended\
    \ purpose of\n   the packet.  Diameter suffers from reliance of SCTP, which is\
    \ not\n   widely deployed or widely recognized by firewalls.  Should firewalls\n\
    \   also be AAA proxy engines?  Has this issue anything to do with\n   interoperability\
    \ with NAT?\n   1.5.3 We had some confusion as to what the requirement actually\
    \ was.\n   Raj seemed to be able to explain it, but the rest of us had to take\n\
    \   it on faith.\n   A poll was taken on overall acceptability and effort for\
    \ each of the\n   protocols submitted, for requirements conformance.\n   Each\
    \ member indicated their evaluation in the form of (Acceptable,\n   Not-Acceptable)\
    \ with qualifiers for (Accounting, or effort to change)\n   This information will\
    \ be summarized in the final report.\n   A general wrap-up discussion was held.\n\
    \   It was considered important that as much of the thought processes and\n  \
    \ rationales be placed in the final report as is feasible.  Mike St.\n   John\
    \ will work with Dave Mitton on the ID.  We really need to meet\n   the IETF July\
    \ 14 submission deadline, even if we have to issue an\n   update on the AAA WG\
    \ mailing list.  All agreed that the process went\n   fairly well.  In future\
    \ evaluations of this nature, it would be well\n   for the evaluators to follow\
    \ the requirements documents closely, for\n   the submitters to create accurate\
    \ and complete conformance documents,\n   and to allow a \"re-spin\" cycle to\
    \ correct errors and omissions in the\n   requirements documents and conformance\
    \ documents.\n   A discussion of the transport protocol was held.\n   The issue\
    \ with transport is congestion control.  There has been a\n   problem with streams-oriented\
    \ applications over TCP.  The IESG is\n   increasingly sensitive to this issue\
    \ in new protocols.  It was noted\n   that AAA was a transaction-oriented application.\
    \  Other request-\n   response applications, such as DNS, seem to scale welt to\
    \ Internet-\n   scale using simple application-level retries and UDP transport.\
    \  TCP\n   has problems with head-of-line blocking, especially when multiple\n\
    \   sessions are using a single TCP connection.  AAA typically will send\n   3\
    \ or 4 iterations and then indicate a failure to the upper layers.\n   It won't\
    \ continue retransmissions in the face of congestion, like\n   TCP.  It was noted\
    \ that bulk data transfer may not best be\n   implemented in the AAA protocol.\
    \  Concern was voiced that SCTP is not\n   a widely implemented protocol.  AAA\
    \ will implement congestion control\n   by limiting the number of outstanding\
    \ requests.  Some RADIUS\n   implementations send lots of traffic when they encounter\n\
    \   misconfigured shared secrets, but this is likely caused by a lack of\n   proper\
    \ error recovery.  Diameter, as currently drafted, relies on\n   SCTP.  Can AAA\
    \ run over UDP?  The IESG didn't say \"no\"; their issue\n   is addressing congestion\
    \ control.\n"
