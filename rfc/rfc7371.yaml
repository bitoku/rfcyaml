  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document updates the IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291]\
    \ by\n   redefining reserved bits as generic flag bits (Section 2).  The\n   document\
    \ also provides some clarifications related to the use of\n   these flag bits\
    \ (Section 3).\n   This document updates [RFC3956], [RFC3306], and [RFC4291].\
    \  These\n   updates are logical consequences of the new processing rules in\n\
    \   Section 3.\n   Textual representation of IPv6 addresses included in the RFC\
    \ updates\n   follows the recommendation in [RFC5952].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Addressing Architecture Update
  contents:
  - "2.  Addressing Architecture Update\n   Bits 17-20 of a multicast address, where\
    \ bit 1 is the most\n   significant bit, are defined in [RFC3956] and [RFC3306]\
    \ as reserved\n   bits.  This document defines these bits as generic flag bits\
    \ so that\n   they apply to any multicast address.  These bits are referred to\
    \ as\n   \"ff2\" (flag field 2), while the \"flgs\" bits in [RFC4291] [RFC3956]\n\
    \   are renamed to \"ff1\" (flag field 1).\n   Within this document, flag bits\
    \ denote both ff1 and ff2.\n   Defining the bits 17-20 as flags for all IPv6 multicast\
    \ addresses\n   allows addresses to be treated in a more uniform and generic way,\
    \ and\n   allows for these bits to be defined in the future for different\n  \
    \ purposes, irrespective of the specific type of multicast address.\n   For the\
    \ record, this design choice was initially triggered by the\n   specification\
    \ in [ADDR-FORMAT], which proposed associating a meaning\n   with one of the reserved\
    \ bits.  Moreover, [ADDR-FORMAT] also\n   considered the use of the last remaining\
    \ flag in ff1, but that\n   approach was abandoned because it is not clear at\
    \ this stage whether\n   there are other usage scenarios of the flag.\n   Section\
    \ 4 specifies the updated structure of the addressing\n   architecture.\n   Further\
    \ specification documents may define a meaning for these\n   flag bits.\n"
- title: '3.  Flag Bits: New Processing Rules'
  contents:
  - "3.  Flag Bits: New Processing Rules\n   Some implementations and specification\
    \ documents do not treat the\n   flag bits as separate bits but tend to use their\
    \ combined value as a\n   4-bit integer.  This practice is a hurdle for assigning\
    \ a meaning to\n   the remaining flag bits.  Below are listed some examples for\n\
    \   illustration purposes:\n   o  The reading of [RFC3306] may lead one to conclude\
    \ that ff3x::/32\n      is the only allowed Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) IPv6\
    \ prefix\n      block.\n   o  [RFC3956] states that only ff70::/12 applies to\
    \ Embedded-RP.\n      Particularly, implementations should not treat the fff0::/12\
    \ range\n      as Embedded-RP.\n   To avoid such confusion and to unambiguously\
    \ associate a meaning with\n   the remaining flags, the following requirement\
    \ is made:\n      Implementations MUST treat flag bits as separate bits.\n"
