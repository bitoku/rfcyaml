Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines two MIB modules for managing the new capabilities of MAC bridges defined by the IEEE 802.1D 1998 MAC Bridges and the IEEE 802.1Q 1998
Virtual LAN (VLAN) standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.
One MIB module defines objects for managing the 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced Multicast Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D 1998.
The other MIB module defines objects for managing IEEE 802.1Q VLANs.
Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.
Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.
This memo also includes several MIB modules in a manner that is compliant to the SMIv2 [V2SMI].
This memo supplements RFC 1493 [BRIDGEMIB] and (to a lesser extent)
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in an Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks [ARCH].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [V1SMI], STD 16, RFC 1212 [V1CONCISE] and RFC 1215 [V1TRAPS].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [V2SMI], STD 58, RFC 2579 [V2TC] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [V2CONFORM].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [V2COMMUNITY] and RFC 1906 [V2TRANS].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [V2TRANS], Message Processing and Dispatching [V3MPC] and User  based Security Model [V3USM].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [V2PROTO].
A set of fundamental applications described in SNMPv3 Applications [V3APPS] and the view based access control mechanism described in View based Access Control Model [V3VACM].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
Overview A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.
This device is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network layer.
These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.
There are two major modes defined for this bridging: Source Route and transparent.
Source Route bridging is described by IEEE 802.5 [802.5].  and is not discussed further in this document.
The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE 802.1D 1998
[802.1D] which is an update to the original IEEE 802.1D specification [802.1D ORIG].
Managed objects for that original specification of transparent bridging were defined in RFC 1493 [BRIDGEMIB].
The original IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q 1998 [802.1Q] to provide support for 'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged physical LAN network may be used to support multiple logical bridged LANs, each of which offers a service approximately the same as that defined by IEEE 802.1D.
Such virtual LANs (VLANs) are an integral feature of switched LAN networks.
A VLAN can be viewed as a group of end stations on multiple LAN segments and can communicate as if they were on a single LAN.
IEEE 802.1Q defines port based Virtual LANs where membership is determined by the bridge port on which data frames are received.
This memo defines the objects needed for the management of port based VLANs in bridge entities.
This memo defines those objects needed for the management of a bridging entity operating in the transparent mode, as well as some objects applicable to all types of bridges.
Managed objects for Source Route bridging are defined in RFC 1525 [SRBRIDGEMIB].
This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which attempts to match the set defined in IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.
However, to be consistent with the spirit of the SNMP Framework, a subjective judgement was made to omit the objects from those standards most 'costly' to implement in an agent and least 'essential' for fault and configuration management.
The omissions are described in section 3 below.
The original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] used the following principles for determining inclusion of an object in the BRIDGE MIB module:
(1)   Start with a small set of essential objects and add only as further objects are needed.
(2)   Require objects be essential for either fault or configuration management.
(3)   Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
(4)   Limit the total of objects.
(5)   Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this or other MIBs.
(6)   Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.
The  guideline that was followed is one counter per critical section per layer.
This document defines additional objects, on top of those existing in the original BRIDGE MIB module defined in [BRIDGEMIB]: that MIB module is to be maintained unchanged for backwards compatibility.
Section 3.4.3 of the present document contains some recommendations regarding usage of objects in the original bridge MIB by devices implementing the enhancements defined here.
Two MIB modules are defined here:
(1)   Managed objects for an extended bridge
MIB module P BRIDGE MIB for the traffic class and multicast filtering enhancements defined by IEEE 802.1D 1998
(2)   Managed objects for a virtual bridge
MIB module Q BRIDGE MIB for the Virtual LAN bridging enhancements defined by IEEE 802.1Q 1998 [802.1Q].
Structure of Extended Bridge MIB module Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.
Each group is organized as a set of related objects.
The overall structure and assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.
Relationship to IEEE 802.1D 1998
This section contains a cross reference to the objects defined in IEEE 802.1D 1998 [802.1D].
It also details those objects that are not considered necessary in this MIB module.
Some objects defined by IEEE 802.1D 1998 have been included in the virtual bridge MIB module rather than this one: entries in dot1qTpGroupTable, dot1qForwardAllTable and dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable are required for virtual bridged LANs with additional indexing (e.g. per VLAN, per FDB) and so are not defined here.
Instead, devices which do not implement virtual bridged LANs but do implement the Extended Forwarding Services defined by IEEE 802.1D (i.e. dynamic learning of multicast group addresses and group service requirements in the filtering database) should implement these tables with a fixed value for dot1qFdbId (the value 1 is recommended) or dot1qVlanIndex (the value 1 is recommended).
Devices which support Extended Filtering Services should support dot1qTpGroupTable, dot1qForwardAllTable and dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable.
The following IEEE 802.1D 1998 management objects have not been included in the Bridge MIB for the indicated reasons.
ApplicantAdministrativeControl not provided per attribute (e.g. per VLAN, per Group).
Only per {device,port,application} control is provided in this MIB.
Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects
This section contains section number cross references to manageable objects defined in IEEE 802.1Q 1998 [802.1Q].
These objects have been included in this MIB as they provide a natural fit with the IEEE 802.1D objects with which they are co located.
This group contains the objects which are applicable to all bridges implementing the traffic class and multicast filtering features of IEEE 802.1D 1998 [802.1D].
It includes per device configuration of GARP and GMRP protocols.
This group will be implemented by all devices which implement the extensions defined in 802.1D 1998.
The dot1dPriority Group This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting status of priority based queuing mechanisms in a bridge.
This includes per  port user priority treatment, mapping of user priority in frames into internal traffic classes and outbound user priority and access priority.
This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on operation of the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol (GARP).
This group contains the objects for configuring and reporting on operation of the GARP Multicast Registration Protocol (GMRP).
The dot1dTpHCPortTable This table extends the dot1dTp group from the original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] and contains the objects for reporting port bridging statistics for high capacity network interfaces.
This table extends the dot1dTp group from the original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] and contains the objects for reporting the upper bits of port bridging statistics for high capacity network interfaces for when 32 bit counters are inadequate.
Structure of Virtual Bridge MIB module Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.
Each group is organized as a set of related objects.
The overall structure and assignment of objects to their groups is shown below.
Some manageable objects defined in the original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] need to be indexed differently when they are used in a VLAN bridging environment: these objects are, therefore, effectively duplicated by new objects with different indexing which are defined in the Virtual Bridge MIB.
Relationship to IEEE 802.1Q Manageable Objects
This section contains section number cross references to manageable objects defined in clause 12 of IEEE 802.1Q 1998 [802.1Q].
It also details those objects that are not considered necessary in this MIB module.
Note: unlike IEEE 802.1D 1998, IEEE 802.1Q 1998
[802.1Q] did not define exact syntax for a set of managed objects: the following cross references indicate the section numbering of the descriptions of management operations from clause 12 in the latter document.

This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all bridges implementing IEEE 802.1Q virtual LANs.
This group contains objects that control the operation and report the status of transparent bridging.
This includes management of the dynamic Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast forwarding.
This group will be implemented by all bridges that perform destination address filtering.
This group contains objects that control static configuration information for transparent bridging.
This includes management of the static entries in the Filtering Databases for both unicast and multicast forwarding.
This group contains objects that control configuration and report status of the Virtual LANs known to a bridge.
This includes management of the statically configured VLANs as well as reporting VLANs discovered by other means e.g. GVRP.
It also controls configuration and reports status of per port objects relating to VLANs and reports traffic statistics.
It also provides for management of the VLAN Learning Constraints.
The datatypes MacAddress, BridgeId, Timeout, EnabledStatus, PortList, VlanIndex and VlanId are used as textual conventions in this document.
These textual conventions have NO effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.
Objects defined using these conventions are always encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers.
As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.
In particular, it is assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will also implement (at least)
the 'system' group defined in MIB II [MIB2], the 'interfaces' group defined in [INTERFACEMIB] and the original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB].
Relationship to the 'system' group
the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each object in the 'system' group.
Thus, those objects apply to the entity as a whole irrespective of whether the entity's sole functionality is bridging, or whether bridging is only a subset of the entity's functionality.
The Interfaces Group MIB [INTERFACEMIB], requires that any MIB which is an adjunct of the Interfaces Group MIB, clarify specific areas within the Interfaces Group MIB.
These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interfaces Group MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of certain media types.
The Interfaces Group MIB enumerates several areas which a media  specific MIB must clarify.
Each of these areas is addressed in a following subsection.
The implementor is referred to the Interfaces Group MIB in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
In the Interfaces Group MIB, the 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces, where each interface is thought of as being attached to a `subnetwork'.
(Note that this term is not to be confused with `subnet' which refers to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of protocols.)
The term 'segment' is used in this memo to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.
Implicit in this Extended Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a bridge.
Each of these ports is associated with one interface of the 'interfaces' group (one row in ifTable) and, in most situations, each port is associated with a different interface.
However, there are situations in which multiple ports are associated with the same interface.
An example of such a situation would be several ports each corresponding one to one with several X.25 virtual circuits but all on the same interface.
Each port is uniquely identified by a port number.
A port number has no mandatory relationship to an interface number, but in the simple case a port number will have the same value as the corresponding interface's interface number.
Port numbers are in the range (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).
Some entities perform other functionality as well as bridging through the sending and receiving of data on their interfaces.
In such situations, only a subset of the data sent/received on an interface is within the domain of the entity's bridging functionality.
This subset is considered to be delineated according to a set of protocols, with some protocols being bridged, and other protocols not being bridged.
For example, in an entity which exclusively performed bridging, all protocols would be considered as being bridged, whereas in an entity which performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only bridged other protocols, only the non IP data would be considered as being bridged.
Thus, this Extended Bridge MIB (and in particular, its counters) is applicable only to that subset of the data on an entity's interfaces which is sent/received for a protocol being bridged.
All such data is sent/received via the ports of the bridge.
This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in accordance with the Interfaces Group MIB [INTERFACEMIB] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that each sub layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface.
This document recommends that, within an entity, VLANs which are instantiated as an entry in dot1qVlanCurrentTable by either management configuration through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by dynamic means (e.g.  through GVRP), are NOT also represented by an entry in ifTable.
Where an entity contains higher layer protocol entities e.g. IP layer interfaces that transmit and receive traffic to/from a VLAN, these should be represented in the ifTable as interfaces of type propVirtual(53).
Protocol specific types such as l3ipxvlan(137) should not be used here since there is no implication that the bridge will perform any protocol filtering before delivering up to these virtual interfaces.
In addition, the Interfaces Group MIB [INTERFACEMIB] defines a table 'ifStackTable' for describing the relationship between logical interfaces within an entity.
It is anticipated that implementors will use this table to describe the binding of e.g. IP interfaces to physical ports,
although the presence of VLANs makes the representation less than perfect for showing connectivity: the ifStackTable cannot represent the full capability of the IEEE 802.1Q
since that makes a distinction between VLAN bindings on 'ingress' to and 'egress' from a port: these relationships may or may not be symmetrical whereas
Interface MIB Evolution assumes a symmetrical binding for transmit and receive.
This makes it necessary to define other manageable objects for configuring which ports are members of which VLANs.
This table contains all MAC addresses, unicast, multicast, and broadcast, for which an interface will receive packets and forward them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.
Note that this does not include addresses for data link layer control protocols such as Spanning Tree, GMRP or GVRP.
The format of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for ifPhysAddress.
This table does not include unicast or multicast addresses which are accepted for possible forwarding out some other port.
This table is explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.
Relation to Original Bridge MIB
This section defines how objects in the original bridge MIB module [BRIDGEMIB] should be represented for devices which implement the extensions: some of the old objects are less useful in such devices but must still be implemented for reasons of backwards compatibility.
Note that formal conformance statements for that MIB module do not exist since it is defined in SMIv1. 3.4.3.1.
This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all types of bridges.
Interpretation of this group is unchanged.
This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.
Interpretation of this group is unchanged.
This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with respect to transparent bridging.
In a device operating with a single Filtering Database, interpretation of this group is unchanged.
In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is interpreted as follows:
The number of times that  any  of the FDBs became full.
This applies to all Filtering Databases.
dot1dTpFdbTable Report MAC addresses learned on each port, regardless of which Filtering Database they have been learnt in.
If an address has been learnt in multiple databases on a single port, report it only once.
If an address has been learnt in multiple databases on more than one port, report the entry on any one of the valid ports.
This table is port based and is not affected by multiple Filtering Databases or multiple VLANs.
The counters should include frames received or transmitted for all VLANs.
Note that equivalent 64 bit port statistics counters, as well as other objects to represent the upper 32 bits of these counters, are defined in this document for high capacity network interfaces.
These have confromance statements to indicate for which speeds of interface they are required.
This optional group contains objects that describe the configuration of destination address filtering.
In a device operating with a single Filtering Database, interpretation of this group is unchanged.
In a device supporting multiple Filtering Databases, this group is interpreted as follows:
dot1dStaticTable Entries read from this table include all static entries from all of the Filtering Databases.
Entries for the same MAC address and receive port in more than one Filtering Database must appear only once since these are the indices of this table.
This table should be implemented as read only in devices that support multiple Forwarding Databases instead, write access should be provided through dot1qStaticUnicastTable and dot1qStaticMulticastTable, as defined in this document.
Additions to the Original Bridge MIB
In addition to the objects in the original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB], this document contains:
(1)   support for multiple traffic classes and dynamic multicast filtering as per IEEE 802.1D 1998 [802.1D].
(2)   support for bridged Virtual LANs as per IEEE 802.1Q 1998 [802.1Q].
(3)   support for 64 bit versions of original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB] port counters.

Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port.
Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object.
If that bit has a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'.
A value used to index per VLAN tables: values of 0 and 4095 are not permitted; if the value is between 1 and 4094 inclusive, it represents an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN ID with global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId textual convention).
If the value is greater than 4095 then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN ID assigned to it.
Such VLANs are outside the scope of IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them in the same way using this MIB.
"The version number of IEEE 802.1Q that this device supports."
The maximum IEEE 802.1Q VLAN ID that this device supports."
"The maximum number of IEEE 802.1Q VLANs that this device supports."
"The current number of IEEE 802.1Q VLANs that are configured in this device."
"The administrative status requested by management for GVRP.
The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP should be enabled on this device, on all ports for which it has not been specifically disabled.
When disabled(2), GVRP is disabled on all ports and all GVRP packets will be forwarded transparently.
This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines.
A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on all ports.
A table that contains configuration and control information for each Filtering Database currently operating on this device.
Entries in this table appear automatically when VLANs are assigned FDB IDs in the dot1qVlanCurrentTable."
current DESCRIPTION "Information about a specific Filtering Database.
The identity of this Filtering Database."
The current number of dynamic entries in this Filtering Database."
Multiple Forwarding Databases for 802.1Q Transparent devices
This table is an alternative to the dot1dTpFdbTable,
previously defined for 802.1D devices which only support a   single Forwarding Database.
A table that contains information about unicast entries for which the device has forwarding and/or filtering information.
This information is used by the transparent bridging function in determining how to propagate a received frame."
current DESCRIPTION "Information about a specific unicast MAC address for which the device has some forwarding and/or filtering information."
"A unicast MAC address for which the device has forwarding and/or filtering information."
Either the value '0', or the port number of the port on which a frame having a source address equal to the value of the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbAddress has been seen.
A value of '0' indicates that the port number has not been learned but that the device does have some forwarding/filtering information about this address (e.g. in the dot1qStaticUnicastTable).
Implementors are encouraged to assign the port value to this object whenever it is learned even for addresses for which the corresponding value of dot1qTpFdbStatus is not learned(3)."
The status of this entry.
The meanings of the values are: other(1) none of the following.
This may include the case where some other MIB object (not the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbPort, nor an entry in the dot1qStaticUnicastTable) is being used to determine if and how frames addressed to the value of the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbAddress are being forwarded.
this entry is no longer valid (e.g., it was learned but has since aged out), but has not yet been flushed from the table.
the value of the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbPort was learned and is being used.
the value of the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbAddress represents one of the device's addresses.
The corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbPort indicates which of the device's ports has this address.
the value of the corresponding instance of dot1qTpFdbAddress is also the value of an existing instance of dot1qStaticAddress."
