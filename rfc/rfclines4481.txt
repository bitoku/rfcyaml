Abstract The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML format for presenting presence information for a presentity.
This document extends PIDF, adding a timed status extension (<timed status> element) that allows a presentity to declare its status for a time interval fully in the future or the past.
Traditionally, presence information, e.g., represented as Presence Information Data Format [3]
(PIDF) and augmented by Rich Presence Information Data format [9] (RPID), describes the current state of the presentity.
However, a watcher can better plan communications if it knows about the presentity's future plans.
For example, if a watcher knows that the presentity is about to travel, it might place a phone call earlier.
In this document, we use terms defined in RFC 2778 [7].
In particular, a "presentity", abbreviating presence entity, provides presence information to a presence service.
It is typically a uniquely identified person.
RPID already allows a presentity to indicate the period when a particular aspect of its presence is valid.
However, the <status> element in the PIDF <tuple> does not have this facility, so that it is not possible to indicate that a presentity will be OPEN or CLOSED in the future, for example.
It is also occasionally useful to represent past information since it may be the only known presence information; it may give watchers an indication of the current status.
For example, indicating that the presentity was at an off site meeting that ended an hour ago indicates that the presentity is likely in transit at the current time.
It is unfortunately not possible to simply add time range attributes to the PIDF <status> element, as PIDF parsers without this capability would ignore these attributes and thus not be able to distinguish current from future presence status information.
This document defines the <timed status> element that describes the status of a presentity that is either no longer valid or covers some future time period.
The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].
The <timed status> element is a child of the <tuple> element and MUST NOT appear as a child of a PIDF <status> element or another <timed status> element.
More than one such element MAY appear within a PIDF <tuple> element.
Sources of <timed status> information should avoid elements that overlap in time, but since overlapping appointments are common in calendars, for example, receivers MUST be able to render such overlapping <timed status> indications.
The <timed status> element MUST be qualified with the 'from' attribute and MAY be qualified with an 'until' attribute to describe the time when the status assumed this value and the time until which this element is expected to be valid.
If the 'until' attribute is missing, the information is assumed valid until the tuple is explicitly overridden or expires as defined by the publication mechanism used.
The time range MUST NOT encompass the present time, i.e., the PIDF <timestamp> value, as that would provide an unnecessary and confusing alternate mechanism to describe presence.
Thus, the 'from' attribute for tuples without an 'until' attribute MUST refer to the future.
During composition, a presence agent (PA) may encounter a stored <timed status> element that covers the present time.
The PA MAY either discard that element or MAY convert it to a regular <status> element if it considers that information more credible.
The <timed status> element may contain the <basic> and <note> elements, as well as any other element that is appropriate as a PIDF <status> extension and that has a limited validity period.
Examples include the PIDF LO [8] extensions for location objects.
This extension chose absolute rather than relative times, since relative times would be too hard to keep properly updated when spacing notifications, for example.
Originators of presence information MUST generate time values in the <timed status> elements that are fully in the past or future relative to local real (wallclock) time and the time information contained in the optional PIDF <timestamp> element.
An example combining PIDF and timed status is shown below:
"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:timed status" entity "pres:someone@example.com"> <
tuple id "c8dqui"> <status> <basic
timed status from "2005 08 15T10:20:00.000 05:00" until "2005 08 22T19:30:00.000 05:00"> <ts:
> <note>I'll be in Tokyo next
The XML [4] schema [5][6] is shown below.

This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN and schema per [2].
URN Sub Namespace Registration for 'urn
This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by RFC 4481 to describe timed status presence information extensions for the status element in the PIDF presence document format in the application/pidf xml content type.
