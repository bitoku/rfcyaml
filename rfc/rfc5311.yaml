- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   [IS-IS] defines the set of LSPs that may be originated by a\
    \ system at\n   each level.  This set is limited to 256 LSPs.  [IS-IS] also defines\
    \ a\n   maximum value for an LSP (originatingLxLSPBufferSize) as 1492 bytes.\n\
    \   The carrying capacity of an LSP set, while bounded, has thus far been\n  \
    \ sufficient for advertisements associated with an area/domain in\n   existing\
    \ deployment scenarios.  However, the definition of additional\n   information\
    \ to be included in LSPs (e.g., multi-topology support,\n   traffic engineering\
    \ information, router capabilities, etc.) has the\n   potential to exceed the\
    \ carrying capacity of an LSP set.\n   This issue first drew interest when traffic\
    \ engineering extensions\n   were introduced.  This interest resulted in the solution\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC3786].  However, that solution suffers from restrictions\
    \ required\n   to maintain interoperability with systems that do not support the\n\
    \   extensions.\n   This document defines extensions that allow a system to exceed\
    \ the\n   256 LSP limit and do so in a way that has no interoperability issues\n\
    \   with systems that do not support the extension.  It is seen as a\n   simpler,\
    \ and therefore preferred, solution to the problem.\n"

- title: 3.  Definition of Commonly Used Terms
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Commonly Used Terms\n   This section provides definitions for\
    \ terms that are used throughout\n   the text.  The terminology is consistent\
    \ with that used in RFC 3786.\n   Originating System: A physical IS running the\
    \ IS-IS protocol.  As\n   this document describes a method that allows a single\
    \ physical IS to\n   originate LSPs on behalf of multiple virtual ISs, the Originating\n\
    \   System represents the single physical IS.\n   Normal system-id: The system-id\
    \ of an Originating System as defined\n   by [IS-IS].\n   Additional system-id:\
    \ A system-id other than the \"Normal system-id\"\n   that is assigned by the\
    \ network administrator to an Originating\n   System in order to allow the generation\
    \ of Extended LSPs.  The\n   Additional system-id, like the Normal system-id,\
    \ must be unique\n   throughout the routing area (Level-1) or domain (Level-2).\n\
    \   Original LSP: An LSP using the Normal system-id in its LSP ID.\n   Extended\
    \ LSP: An LSP using an Additional system-id in its LSP ID.\n   LSP set: All LSPs\
    \ of a given level having the same system ID and\n   Pseudonode ID.  (The LSPID\
    \ field then only varies in the LSP number\n   octet.) This constitutes the complete\
    \ set of link state information\n   at a given level originated using that system\
    \ ID/Pseudonode ID.  This\n   term is defined to resolve the ambiguity between\
    \ a logical LSP and a\n   single Link State PDU -- which is sometimes called an\
    \ LSP fragment.\n   The latter is the unit of information handled by the update\
    \ process.\n   Extended LSP set: An LSP set consisting of LSPs using an Additional\n\
    \   system-id.\n   Extension-capable IS: An IS implementing the mechanisms described\
    \ in\n   this document.\n   Virtual IS: The system, identified by an Additional\
    \ system-id,\n   advertised as originating the Extended LSPs.  These LSPs specify\
    \ the\n   Additional system-id in their LSP IDs.\n"
- title: 4.  Utilizing Additional System IDs
  contents:
  - "4.  Utilizing Additional System IDs\n   This extension allows an Originating\
    \ System to be assigned additional\n   system-ids that may be used to generate\
    \ additional LSP sets.  The\n   additional system-ids are subject to the same\
    \ restrictions as normal\n   system-ids, i.e., when used at Level-1, the additional\
    \ system-id MUST\n   be unique within the Level-1 area.  When used at Level-2,\
    \ the\n   additional system-id MUST be unique within the domain.\n   Extended\
    \ LSPs are treated by the IS-IS Update Process in the same\n   manner as normal\
    \ LSPs, i.e., the same rules as to generation,\n   flooding, purging, etc. apply.\
    \  In particular, if the Extended LSP\n   with LSP number zero and remaining lifetime\
    \ > 0 is not present for a\n   particular additional system-id, then none of the\
    \ Extended LSPs in\n   that Extended LSP set shall be processed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Additional Information in Extended LSPs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Additional Information in Extended LSPs\n   The LSP number zero of an Extended\
    \ LSP set MUST include the new IS\n   alias ID TLV defined in Section 4.4.  This\
    \ allows the Extended LSP\n   set to be associated with the Originating System\
    \ that generated the\n   LSP(s).\n"
- title: 4.2.  Extended LSP Restrictions
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Extended LSP Restrictions\n   The following restrictions on the information\
    \ that may appear in an\n   Extended LSP are defined in order to avoid interoperability\
    \ issues\n   with systems that do not support the extensions defined in this\n\
    \   document.  All TLV references are based on the current definitions in\n  \
    \ the IANA IS-IS TLV Codepoints Registry.\n"

    \      Part. DIS (4)\n      Prefix Neighbors (5)\n   If any of the TLVs listed\
    \ above appear in an Extended LSP, an\n   Extension Capable IS MUST ignore those\
    \ TLVs on receipt and SHOULD\n   report an error.  Other TLVs in that Extended\
    \ LSP set MUST be\n   processed normally.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Leaf Advertisements in Extended LSPs\n   Advertisement of leaf information\
    \ in Extended LSPs is allowed.\n   Inclusion of such information requires the\
    \ advertisement of a\n   neighbor between the Originating System and the Virtual\

    \ appear.\n   See Section 4.2.3.\n   When leaf advertisements for multiple topologies\
    \ (see [RFC5120]) are\n   included in an Extended LSP set, the multi-topology\

    \   Note that ISs NOT supporting these extensions will interpret these\n   bits\
    \ normally in Extended LSPs they receive.  If the ATT bit were set\n   in an Extended\
    \ LSP, this could indicate that the Virtual IS is\n   attached to other areas\
    \ when the Originating System is not.  This\n   might cause legacy systems to\
    \ use the Virtual IS as a default exit\n   point from the area.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Originating LSP Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Originating LSP Requirements\n   The Original LSP set MUST include a neighbor\

- title: 4.5.  New TLVs in Support of IS Neighbor Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.5.  New TLVs in Support of IS Neighbor Attributes\n   One of the major sources\
    \ of additional information in LSPs is the\n   sub-TLV information associated\
    \ with the extended IS reachability TLV\n   (22) and MT-ISN TLV (222).  This includes\
    \ (but is not limited to)\n   information required in support of Traffic Engineering\
    \ (TE) as\n   defined in [RFC5305] and [RFC5307].  The restrictions defined in\
    \ this\n   document prohibit the presence of TLV 22 and/or TLV 222 in Extended\n\
    \   LSPs except to advertise the neighbor relationship to the Originating\n  \
    \ System.  In the event that there is a need to advertise in Extended\n   LSPs\
    \ such information associated with neighbors of the Originating\n   System, it\
    \ is necessary to define new TLVs to carry the sub-TLV\n   information.\n   Two\
    \ new TLVs are therefore defined.\n   1) IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (23).  It is\
    \ identical in format to the\n      extended IS reachability TLV (22).\n   2)\
    \ MT IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (223).  It is identical in format to\n      the\
    \ MT-ISN TLV (222).\n   These new TLVs MAY be included in Original LSPs or Extended\
    \ LSPs.\n   Regardless of the type of LSP in which the TLVs appear, the\n   information\
    \ pertains to the neighbor relationship between the\n   Originating System and\
    \ the IS identified in the TLV.\n   These TLVs MUST NOT be used to infer that\
    \ a neighbor relationship\n   exists in the absence of TLV 22 or TLV 222 (whichever\
    \ applies) in the\n   Originating LSP set for the specified neighbor.  This restriction\
    \ is\n   necessary in order to maintain compatibility with systems that do not\n\
    \   support these extensions.\n"
- title: 5.  Comparison with the RFC 3786 Solution
  contents:
  - "5.  Comparison with the RFC 3786 Solution\n   This document utilizes the same\
    \ basic mechanism (additional system-\n   ids) as RFC 3786 to allow an originating\
    \ system to generate more than\n   256 LSPs.  It differs from RFC 3786 in that\
    \ it restricts the content\n   of Extended LSPs to information that does NOT impact\
    \ the building of\n   a Shortest Path Tree (SPT).\n   Legacy IS-IS implementations\
    \ which do not support the extensions\n   defined in this document see the Extended\
    \ LSPs as information\n   associated with a system that is reachable only via\
    \ the Originating\n   System.  As no other systems are reachable via the Virtual\
    \ ISs, the\n   Shortest Path First (SPF) calculation in legacy ISs is therefore\n\
    \   consistent with that performed by extension-capable ISs.  There is\n   therefore\
    \ no need for the two different operating modes defined in\n   RFC 3786.\n   There\
    \ is also no need for the special handling of the original LSP\n   set and the\
    \ Extended LSP set(s) as a single Logical LSP during the\n   SPF as specified\
    \ in Section 5 of RFC 3786.\n"
- title: 6.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Deployment Considerations\n   There are a number of deployment considerations\

- title: 6.1.  Advertising New TLVs in Extended LSPs
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Advertising New TLVs in Extended LSPs\n   As Extended LSPs MAY be utilized\
    \ to advertise TLVs associated with\n   other protocol extensions (definition\
    \ of which is outside the scope\n   of this document) and/or the extensions defined\
    \ in Section 4.4 of\n   this document, it is obvious that the utilization of the\
    \ information\n   in Extended LSPs by legacy IS-IS implementations will be limited.\n\
    \   The implication of this is that as implementations are revised to\n   support\
    \ the protocol extensions that define new TLVs/sub-TLVs that\n   MAY be advertised\
    \ in Extended LSPs; the implementation SHOULD also be\n   revised to support the\

  contents:
  - "6.2.  Reachability and Non-SPF TLV Staleness\n   In cases where non-SPF information\

    \ IS\n   does not use or leak stale information.  As long as the OL bit is NOT\n\
    \   set by the Originating System in normal LSPs, reachability to the\n   Virtual\

- title: 6.3.  Normal LSP OL State and Use of Extended LSPs
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Normal LSP OL State and Use of Extended LSPs\n   If the Originating System\

    \ not use the information in\n   the corresponding Extended LSPs.  Under these\
    \ circumstances,\n   Extension-capable ISs MUST also see the Virtual ISs as unreachable.\n\

- title: 6.4.  Moving Neighbor Attribute INFO LSPs
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Moving Neighbor Attribute INFO LSPs\n   Section 4.4 defines new TLVs that\
    \ MAY be used to advertise neighbor\n   attribute information in Extended LSPs.\
    \  In cases where neighbor\n   attribute information associated with the same\
    \ context (e.g., the\n   same link) appears in both an Original LSP and in one\
    \ or more\n   Extended LSP sets, the following rules apply for each attribute:\n\
    \   o If the attribute information does not conflict, it MUST be\n     considered\
    \ additive.\n   o If the attribute information conflicts, then the information\
    \ in the\n     Original LSP, if present, MUST be used.  If no information is\n\
    \     in the Original LSP, then the information from the Extended LSP\n     with\

  contents:
  - "6.5.  Advertising Leaf INFO Extended LSPs\n     The need to advertise leaf information\
