  - "1.  Problems\n   With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers\n\
    \   using BGP4 [1],[2] has grown significantly. RFC1930 [4] outlines a\n   set\
    \ of guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS. However,\n   the customer\
    \ and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a\n   result of this in\
    \ that while there is no need for an allocated AS\n   under the guidelines, certain\
    \ conditions make the use of BGP4 a very\n   pragmatic and perhaps only way to\
    \ connect a customer homed to a\n   single ISP. These conditions are as follows:\n\
    \   1) Customers multi-homed to single provider\n   Consider the scenario outlined\
    \ in Figure 1 below.\n                        +-------+      +-------+\n     \
    \                      +----+       |      |       |\n                +------+\

    \              +------+        ++-----++\\     +-------+\n                   \

    \                                ++-----++   +-|        |\n                  \
    \              | Cust. |     |  ISP C |\n                                |   Y\
    \   |     |        |\n                                +-------+     +--------+\n\
    \          Figure 1: Customers multi-home to a single provider\n   Here both customer\
    \ X and customer Y are multi-homed to a single\n   provider, ISP A. Because these\
    \ multiple connections are \"localized\"\n   between the ISP A and its customers,\
    \ the rest of the routing system\n   (ISP B and ISP C in this case) doesn't need\
    \ to see routing\n   information for a single multi-homed customer any differently\
    \ than a\n   singly-homed customer as it has the same routing policy as ISP A\n\
    \   relative to ISP B and ISP C.  In other words, with respect to the\n   rest\
    \ of the Internet routing system the organization is singly-homed,\n   so the\
    \ complexity of the multiple connections is not relevant in a\n   global sense.\
    \  Autonomous System Numbers (AS) are identifiers used in\n   routing protocols\
    \ and are needed by routing domains as part of the\n   global routing system.\
    \  However, as [4] correctly outlines,\n   organizations with the same routing\
    \ policy as their upstream provider\n   do not need an AS.\n   Despite this fact,\
    \ a problem exists in that many ISPs can only\n   support the load-sharing and\
    \ reliability requirements of a multi-\n   homed customer if that customer exchanges\
    \ routing information using\n   BGP-4 which does require an AS as part of the\
    \ protocol.\n   2) Singly-homed customers requiring dynamic advertisement of NLRI's\n\
    \      While this is not a common case as static routing is generally\n      used\
    \ for this purpose, if a large amount of NLRI's need to be\n      advertised from\
    \ the customer to the ISP it is often\n      administratively easier for these\
    \ prefixes to be advertised using\n      a dynamic routing protocol. Today, the\
    \ only exterior gateway\n      protocol (EGP) that is able to do this is BGP.\
    \ This leads to the\n      same problem outlined in condition 1 above.\n   As\
    \ can be seen there is clearly a problem with the recommendations\n   set forth\
    \ in [4] and the practice of using BGP4 in the scenarios\n   above. Section 2\
    \ proposes a solution to this problem with following\n   sections describing the\
    \ implications and application of the proposed\n   solution.\n   It should also\
    \ be noted that if a customer is multi-homed to more\n   than one ISP then they\
    \ are advised to obtain an official allocated AS\n   from their allocation registry.\n"
- title: 2.  Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Solution\n   The solution we are proposing is that all BGP customers homed\
    \ to the\n   same single ISP use a single, dedicated AS specified by the ISP.\n\
    \   Logically, this solution results in an ISP having many peers with the\n  \
    \ same AS, although that AS exists in \"islands\" completely disconnected\n  \
    \ from one another.\n   Several practical implications of this solution are discussed\
    \ in the\n   next section.\n"

- title: 3.1 Full Routing Table Announcement
  contents:
  - "3.1 Full Routing Table Announcement\n   The solution precludes the ability for\
    \ a BGP customer using the\n   dedicated AS to receive 100% full routes.  Because\
    \ of routing loop\n   detection of AS path, a BGP speaker rejects routes with\
    \ its own AS\n   number in the AS path.  Imagine Customer X and Customer Y maintain\n\
    \   BGP peers with Provider A using AS number N. Then, Customer X will\n   not\
    \ be able to received routes of Customer Y.  We do not believe that\n   this would\
    \ cause a problem for Customer X, though, because Customer X\n   and Customer\
    \ Y are both stub networks so default routing is adequate,\n   and the absence\
    \ of a very small portion of the full routing table is\n   unlikely to have a\
    \ noticeable impact on traffic patterns guided by\n   MEDs received.\n   A BGP\
    \ customer using the dedicated AS must carry a default route\n   (preferably receiving\
    \ from its provider via BGP).\n"
- title: 3.2  Change of External Connectivity
  contents:
  - "3.2  Change of External Connectivity\n   The dedicated AS specified by a provider\
    \ is purely for use in peering\n   between its customers and the provider. When\
    \ a customer using the\n   dedicated AS changes its external connectivity, it\
    \ may be necessary\n   for the customer to reconfigure their network to use a\
    \ different AS\n   number (either a globally unique one if homed to multiple providers,\n\
    \   or a dedicated AS of a different provider).\n"
- title: 3.3  Aggregation
  contents:
  - "3.3  Aggregation\n   As BGP customers using this dedicated AS are only homed\
    \ to one ISP,\n   their routes allocated from its providers CIDR block do not\
    \ need to\n   be announced upstream by its provider as the providers will already\n\
    \   be originating the larger block. [6].\n"
- title: 3.4  Routing Registries
  contents:
  - "3.4  Routing Registries\n   The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) [5] is used by\
    \ providers to\n   generate route filtering lists.  Such lists are derived primarily\n\
    \   from the \"origin\" attribute of the route objects.  The \"origin\" is\n \
    \  the AS that originates the route.  With multiple customers using the\n   same\
    \ AS, finer granularity will be necessary to generate the correct\n   route filtering.\
    \  For example, the \"mntner\" attribute or the\n   \"community\" attribute of\
    \ a route object can be used along with the\n   \"origin\" attribute in generating\
    \ the filtering lists.\n"
- title: 4. Practice
  contents:
  - "4. Practice\n   The AS number specified by a provider can either be an AS from\
    \ the\n   private AS space (64512 - 65535) [4], or be an AS previously\n   allocated\
    \ to the provider.  With the former, the dedicated AS like\n   all other private\
    \ AS's should be stripped from its AS path while the\n   route is being propagated\
    \ to the rest of the Internet routing system.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The usage of AS numbers described in this document\
    \ has no effective\n   security impact.  Acceptance and filtering of AS numbers\
    \ from\n   customers is an issue dealt with in other documents.\n"
