  - "1.  Introduction\n   Sieve [RFC5228] is a language for filtering email messages\
    \ at or\n   around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to be\n   implementable\
    \ on either a mail client or mail server.  It is suitable\n   for running on a\
    \ mail server where users may not be allowed to\n   execute arbitrary programs,\
    \ such as on black box Internet Message\n   Access Protocol [RFC3501] servers,\
    \ as it has no user-controlled loops\n   or the ability to run external programs.\n\
    \   The base Sieve specification defines the envelope extension and test\n   to\
    \ access information in the message envelope.  Only information\n   available\
    \ in regular SMTP [RFC5321] is provided; additional\n   information added to the\
    \ SMTP envelope by SMTP extensions cannot be\n   accessed.\n   The \"envelope-dsn\"\
    \ extension extends the envelope test to allow\n   access to the additional envelope\
    \ fields defined by the SMTP\n   extension for delivery status notifications (DSNs)\
    \ specified in\n   RFC 3461 [RFC3461].  The \"envelope-deliverby\" extension extends\
    \ the\n   envelope test to allow access to the additional envelope fields\n  \
    \ defined by the Deliver-By SMTP extension defined in [RFC2852].\n   The base\
    \ Sieve specification also defines the redirect action, which\n   sends the message\
    \ to a different address.  Redirect only allows\n   specification of the new recipient\
    \ address.  The \"redirect-dsn\"\n   extension extends redirect to allow specification\
    \ of some fields\n   defined by the delivery status notification SMTP extension.\n\
    \   \"redirect-deliverby\" in turn provides the ability to set a time limit\n\
    \   for delivery as specified in RFC 2852 [RFC2852].\n"

- title: 4.  Envelope-dsn Extension
  contents:
  - "4.  Envelope-dsn Extension\n   The \"envelope-dsn\" extension does not define\
    \ any new tests or\n   actions; rather, it adds four values to the list of possible\
    \ (case-\n   insensitive) envelope-part strings defined in Section 5.4 of\n  \
    \ [RFC5228]:\n   notify -  Match the list of notification conditions, or NOTIFY\n\
    \      values, associated with the TO address used in the SMTP RCPT TO\n     \
    \ command that resulted in this message getting delivered to this\n      user.\
    \  More than one notification condition can be in effect at\n      once; each\
    \ condition that is in effect is tested separately, and\n      any match causes\
    \ the test to succeed.  The syntax and semantics of\n      the NOTIFY parameter\
    \ are defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3461\n      [RFC3461] .  Currently, the possible\
    \ notification condition values\n      are \"NEVER\", \"SUCCESS\", \"FAILURE\"\
    , and \"DELAY\".  Note that the\n      value \"NEVER\" is never combined with\
    \ any other value.\n   orcpt -  Match the original recipient, or ORCPT, value\
    \ associated\n      with the TO address used in the SMTP RCPT TO command that\
    \ resulted\n      in this message getting delivered to this user, with xtext\n\
    \      encoding removed.  The syntax and semantics of the ORCPT parameter\n  \
    \    are defined in Section 4.2 of RFC 3461 [RFC3461].\n   ret -  Match the return\
    \ of content, or RET, value given in the SMTP\n      MAIL FROM command.  The syntax\
    \ and semantics of the RET parameter\n      are defined in Section 4.3 of RFC\
    \ 3461 [RFC3461].  The possible\n      return of content values are \"FULL\" and\
    \ \"HDRS\".\n   envid -  Match the envelope identifier, or ENVID, value in decoded\n\
    \      form given in the SMTP MAIL FROM command.  The syntax and\n      semantics\
    \ of the ENVID parameter are defined in Section 4.4 of\n      RFC 3461 [RFC3461].\n\
    \   The envelope test fails unconditionally for each of these envelope-\n   part\
    \ strings if the specified envelope parameter does not exist for\n   the current\
    \ message or recipient.\n   The envelope test's ADDRESS-PART argument assumes\
    \ the string being\n   tested has the syntax of an email address.  None of the\
    \ new envelope\n   parts defined here have address syntax; accordingly, it is\
    \ an error\n   to specify an ADDRESS-PART argument in conjunction with these new\n\
    \   envelope parts.\n   The \"relational\" extension [RFC5231] adds a match type\
    \ called\n   \":count\".  The count of an envelope test with an envelope-part\
    \ of\n   \"orcpt\", \"ret\", and \"envid\" is 1 if the corresponding SMTP parameter\n\
    \   is present and 0 otherwise.  The count of an envelope test with an\n   envelope-part\
    \ of \"notify\" is equal to the number of notification\n   conditions specified\
    \ and 0 if the NOTIFY parameter is not present.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Examples
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Examples\n   The fact that the NOTIFY envelope parameter is multivalued\
    \ and the\n   notify envelope-part turns this into a list of values makes it easy\n\
    \   to check to see if a given value is present without having to worry\n   about\
    \ other values:\n   require [\"envelope\", \"envelope-dsn\"];\n   # Check whether\
    \ SUCCESS notifications were requested,\n   # irrespective of any other requests\
    \ that were made\n   if envelope \"notify\" \"SUCCESS\"\n   {\n       # do whatever\n\
    \   }\n   Checking to see if a given request is the only one present is a\n  \
    \ little trickier, however:\n   require [\"envelope\", \"envelope-dsn\", \"relational\"\
    ,\n            \"comparator-i;ascii-numeric\"];\n   # Check whether only FAILURE\
    \ notifications were requested\n   if allof ( envelope \"notify\" \"FAILURE\"\
    ,\n              envelope :comparator \"i;ascii-numeric\"\n                  \
    \     :count \"eq\" \"notify\" \"1\"\n            )\n   {\n       # do whatever\n\
    \   }\n   The orcpt envelope-part always contains an address type indicator\n\
    \   prefix in addition to an address, which must be taken into account in\n  \
    \ any tests:\n   require [\"envelope\", \"envelope-dsn\"];\n   # See if the orcpt\
    \ is an RFC822 address in the example.com\n   # domain\n   if envelope :matches\
    \ \"orcpt\" \"rfc822;*@example.com\"\n   {\n       # do whatever\n   }\n"
- title: 5.  Envelope-deliverby Extension
  contents:
  - "5.  Envelope-deliverby Extension\n   The \"envelope-deliverby\" extension does\
    \ not define any new tests or\n   actions; rather, it adds four values to the\
    \ list of possible (case-\n   insensitive) envelope-part strings defined in Section\
    \ 5.4 of\n   [RFC5228] and an optional :zone tagged argument.  This updates the\n\
    \   usage description for envelope to:\n   Usage:   envelope [COMPARATOR] [ADDRESS-PART]\n\
    \                     [MATCH-TYPE] [:zone <time-zone: string>]\n             \
    \        <envelope-part: string-list>\n                     <key-list: string-list>\n\
    \   These new envelope parts correspond to the new MAIL FROM parameters\n   defined\
    \ in Section 4 of [RFC2852].  They are:\n   bytimeabsolute -  Match the current\
    \ value of the initial integer part\n      of the Deliver-By extension's BY parameter\
    \ on the SMTP MAIL FROM\n      command, converted into an absolute time represented\
    \ in restricted\n      ISO 8601 format.  The restricted ISO 8601 format is specified\
    \ by\n      the date-time ABNF production given in [RFC3339], Section 5.6,\n \
    \     with the added restrictions that the letters \"T\" and \"Z\" MUST be\n \
    \     in upper case, and a time zone offset of zero MUST be represented\n    \
    \  by \"Z\" and not \"+00:00\".\n   bytimerelative -  Match the current value\
    \ of the initial integer part\n      of the Deliver-By extension's BY parameter\
    \ specified in the SMTP\n      MAIL FROM command.\n   bymode -  Match a string\
    \ computed from the by-mode part of the\n      Deliver-By extension's BY parameter.\
    \  The possible values are\n      \"notify\" and \"return\", which correspond\
    \ to the BY parameter mode\n      specifier characters \"N\" and \"R\", respectively.\n\
    \   bytrace -  Match the trace modifier computed from the by-trace\n      modifier\
    \ on the Deliver-By extension's BY parameter.  The possible\n      values are\
    \ \"trace\" and \"\" (the empty string).  These values\n      correspond to the\
    \ presence or absence of the by-trace \"T\"\n      modifier, respectively.\n \
    \  The envelope test fails unconditionally for each of these envelope-\n   part\
    \ strings if the BY SMTP MAIL FROM parameter does not exist for\n   the current\
    \ message or recipient.\n   The new :zone argument specifies a time zone offset\
    \ string that any\n   bytimeabsolute value is to be shifted to prior to testing.\
    \ :zone has\n   no effect on envelope-parts other than bytimeabsolute.  The value\
    \ of\n   the time zone offset string MUST be an offset relative to UTC with\n\
    \   the following syntax:\n   time-zone  =  ( \"+\" / \"-\" ) 4DIGIT\n   The \"\
    +\" or \"-\" indicates whether the time-of-day is ahead of (i.e.,\n   east of)\
    \ or behind (i.e., west of) UTC.  The first two digits\n   indicate the number\
    \ of hours difference from Universal Time, and the\n   last two digits indicate\
    \ the number of minutes difference from\n   Universal Time.  Note that this agrees\
    \ with the [RFC5322] format for\n   time zone offsets, not the ISO 8601 format.\
    \  The local time zone MUST\n   be used for bytimeabsolute if the :zone argument\
    \ is omitted.\n   The envelope test's ADDRESS-PART argument assumes the string\
    \ being\n   tested has the syntax of an email address.  None of the new envelope\n\
    \   parts defined here have address syntax; accordingly, it is an error\n   to\
    \ specify an ADDRESS-PART argument in conjunction with these new\n   envelope\
    \ parts.\n   The \"relational\" extension [RFC5231] adds a match type called\n\
    \   \":count\".  The count of an envelope test with an envelope-part of\n   \"\
    bytime\", \"bymode\", and \"bytrace\" is 1 if the BY parameter is present\n  \
    \ and 0 otherwise.\n   It is important to note that the Deliver-By by-time is\
    \ decremented as\n   the message passes through the transport infrastructure.\n\
    \   Accordingly, it is not possible to tell what the message originator\n   set\
    \ the value to; only the amount of time remaining at the moment the\n   sieve\
    \ is run can be determined.  Additionally, note that\n   bytimerelative values\
    \ can be negative, making it necessary to either\n   perform additional checks\
    \ or else use a comparator that, unlike\n   i;ascii-numeric, is capable of handling\
    \ signed integers.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Examples
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Examples\n   As noted above, this extension does not provide access to\
    \ the\n   originator's initial by-time setting for the simple reason that this\n\
    \   information is not part of the envelope.  It can, however, be used to\n  \
    \ check and see if the message was delivered within the allotted time.\n   Note\
    \ the additional check to see if the value is negative:\n   require [\"envelope\"\
    , \"envelope-deliverby\", \"relational\",\n            \"comparator-i;ascii-numeric\"\
    ];\n   # Check to see if this message didn't make it in the time allotted by\n\
    \   # the originator.\n   if anyof (envelope :contains \"bytimerelative\" \"-\"\
    ,\n             envelope :value \"eq\" :comparator \"i;ascii-numeric\"\n     \
    \                 \"bytimerelative\" \"0\")\n   {\n       # do whatever\n   }\n\
    \   This operation can be done more simply if the date [RFC5260] and\n   variables\
    \ [RFC5229] extensions are available:\n   require [\"envelope\", \"envelope-deliverby\"\
    , \"relational\", \"date\",\n            \"variables\"];\n   # Check to see if\
    \ this message didn't make it in the time allotted by\n   # the originator.\n\
    \   if currentdate :matches \"iso8601\" \"*\" {\n       set \"cdate\" \"${0}\"\

    \     # do whatever\n       }\n   }\n   Note that there is no need to force the\
    \ use of a particular time zone\n   since both currentdate and the bytimeabsolute\
    \ value are required to\n   default to the local time zone.  A similar check could\
    \ be written\n   using :zone if the action taken depends on having the by-time\n\
    \   represented in a particular zone:\n   require [\"envelope\", \"envelope-deliverby\"\
    , \"relational\", \"date\",\n            \"variables\"];\n   # If the message\
    \ didn't make it in time, file it according to when it\n   # should have been\
    \ received\n   if envelope :matches :zone \"+0000\" \"bytimeabsolute\" \"*T*:*:*\"\
    \ {\n       set \"bdate\" \"${0}\";\n       set \"bhour\" \"${2}\";\n       if\
    \ currentdate :zone \"+0000\" :value \"lt\" \"iso8601\" \"${bdate}\")\n      \

    \   the usage description for redirect to:\n   Usage:   redirect [:notify \"value\"\
    ] [:ret \"FULL\"|\"HDRS\"]\n                     <address: string>\n   The syntax\

- title: 6.1.  MAIL FROM Address Selection
  contents:
  - "6.1.  MAIL FROM Address Selection\n   RFC 5228 does not require that any particular\
    \ envelope sender address\n   be associated with redirected messages.  However,\
    \ the redirect-dsn\n   extension isn't terribly useful if the place where the\

    \   When these arguments are specified, they are used to construct the\n   corresponding\
    \ BY ESMTP MAIL FROM parameter.  The :bytimeabsolute or\n   :bytimerelative value\
    \ becomes the by-time, the :bymode becomes the\n   by-mode value, and :bytrace\
    \ sets the by-trace modifier.  If the\n   Deliver-By extension is unavailable,\
    \ the handling of the redirected\n   message MUST conform to the semantics specified\
    \ in [RFC2852],\n   Section 4.1.4 for relaying to a server that does not support\
    \ the\n   Deliver-By SMTP extension.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1.  MAIL FROM Address Selection\n   RFC 5228 does not require that any particular\
    \ envelope sender address\n   be associated with redirected messages.  However,\
    \ the redirect-\n   deliverby extension, like the redirect-dsn extension, isn't\
    \ terribly\n   useful if the place where any delivery status notifications are\
    \ sent\n   isn't known.  Accordingly, when either :bytimeabsolute or\n   :bytimerelative\
    \ is specified and the envelope sender address isn't\n   empty, implementations\
    \ MUST set the envelope sender address to the\n   address of the sieve owner.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Example
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Example\n   The obvious use of \"redirect-deliverby\" is to specify a limit\

    redirect-deliverby\"];\n   # Send a copy to my cell phone, time out after 10 minutes\n\

    \ time of day may also be\n   constructed:\n   require [\"copy\", \"redirect-deliverby\"\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The envelope-dsn and envelope-deliverby extensions\
    \ provide access to\n   additional message envelope information.  This is not\
    \ believed to\n   raise any additional security issues beyond those for the Sieve\n\
    \   \"envelope\" test.\n   The redirect-dsn extension allows specification of\
    \ the delivery\n   status notification's NOTIFY parameter, which can cause the\n\
    \   generation of notification messages that might otherwise not be\n   generated,\
    \ especially if notification in the event of successful\n   delivery is required.\
    \  Sites that limit the ability to request\n   success notifications will also\
    \ need to restrict the ability to\n   request them using the redirect-dsn extension.\n\
    \   Similarly, the redirect-deliverby extension is used to control how\n   long\
    \ the transport infrastructure will continue to attempt to deliver\n   a message\
    \ before giving up, which could result in the generation of\n   additional notification\
    \ messages.  While the underlying Deliver-By\n   extension does have a minimum\
    \ by-time limit, sites may wish to impose\n   additional limits on the minimum\
    \ by-time allowed in a redirect\n   action.\n   All of the security considerations\
    \ given in the base Sieve\n   specification also apply to this extension.\n"
