  - "2. Overview of ITU-T Recommendation G.722.1\n   G.722.1 is a low complexity coder,\
    \ it compresses 50Hz - 7kHz audio\n   signals into one of two bit rates, 24 kbit/s\
    \ or 32 kbit/s.\n   The coder may be used for speech, music and other types of\
    \ audio.\n   Some of the applications for which this coder is suitable are:\n\
    \   o  Real-time communications such as videoconferencing and telephony.\n   o\
    \  Streaming audio\n   o  Archival and messaging\n   A fixed frame size of 20\
    \ ms is used, and for any given bit rate the\n   number of bits in a frame is\
    \ a constant.\n"

    \ rate clock of 16 kHz, so the\n   RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of\

    \                     Figure 1: RTP payload for G.722.1\n   The encoding and decoding\
    \ algorithm can change the bit rate at any\n   20ms frame boundary, but no bit\
    \ rate change notification is provided\n   in-band with the bit stream.  Therefore,\
    \ a separate out-of-band\n   method is REQUIRED to indicate the bit rate (see\
    \ section 6 for an\n   example of signaling bit rate information using SDP). \
    \ For the\n   payload format specified here, the bit rate MUST remain constant\
    \ for\n   a particular payload type value.  An application MAY switch bit rates\n\
    \   from packet to packet by defining two payload type values and\n   switching\
    \ between them.\n   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet\
    \ format is\n   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified\
    \ here.\n   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of\n  \
    \ applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that\n   is\
    \ not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen.\n   The number\
    \ of bits within a frame is fixed, and within this fixed\n   frame G.722.1 uses\
    \ variable length coding (e.g., Huffman coding) to\n   represent most of the encoded\
    \ parameters [2].  All variable length\n   codes are transmitted in order from\
    \ the left most (most significant -\n   MSB) bit to the right most (least significant\
    \ - LSB) bit, see [2] for\n   more details.\n   The use of Huffman coding means\
    \ that it is not possible to identify\n   the various encoded parameters/fields\
    \ contained within the bit stream\n   without first completely decoding the entire\
    \ frame.\n   For the purposes of packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it is only\n\
    \   necessary to consider the sequence of bits as output by the G.722.1\n   encoder,\
    \ and present the same sequence to the decoder.  The payload\n   format described\
    \ here maintains this sequence.\n   When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480 bits (60\
    \ octets) are produced per\n   frame, and when operating at 32 kbit/s, 640 bits\
    \ (80 octets) are\n   produced per frame.  Thus, both bit rates allow for octet\
    \ alignment\n   without the need for padding bits.\n   Figure 2 illustrates how\
    \ the G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into\n   an octet aligned RTP payload.\n\
    \   An RTP packet SHALL only contain G.722.1 frames of the same bit rate.\n  \

    \ is split into\n                   a sequence of octets (60 or 80 depending on\n\
    \                   the bit rate), and each octet is in turn\n               \
    \    mapped into an RTP octet.\n   The ITU-T standardized bit rates for G.722.1\
    \ are 24 kbit/s and\n   32kbit/s.  However, the coding algorithm itself has the\
    \ capability to\n   run at any user specified bit rate (not just 24 and 32kbit/s)\
    \ while\n   maintaining an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 7 kHz.  This rate change\n\
    \   is accomplished by a linear scaling of the codec operation, resulting\n  \
    \ in frames with size in bits equal to 1/50 of the corresponding bit\n   rate.\n\
    \   When operating at non-standard rates the payload format MUST follow\n   the\
    \ guidelines illustrated in Figure 2.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n   values in the\
    \ range 16000 to 32000 be used, and that any value MUST\n   be a multiple of 400\
    \ (this maintains octet alignment and does not\n   then require (undefined) padding\
    \ bits for each frame if not octet\n   aligned).  For example, a bit rate of 16.4\
    \ kbit/s will result in a\n   frame of size 328 bits or 41 octets which are mapped\
    \ into RTP per\n   Figure 2.\n"
- title: 3.1 Multiple G.722.1 frames in a RTP packet
  contents:
  - "3.1 Multiple G.722.1 frames in a RTP packet\n   More than one G.722.1 frame may\
    \ be included in a single RTP packet by\n   a sender.\n   Senders have the following\
    \ additional restrictions:\n   o  SHOULD NOT include more G.722.1 frames in a\
    \ single RTP packet than\n      will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.\n\
    \   o  All frames contained in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same\n     \
    \ length, that is they MUST have the same bit rate (octets per\n      frame).\n\
    \   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ the number of frames contained within an RTP\n   packet be consistent with the\
    \ application.  For example, in a\n   telephony application where delay is important,\
    \ then the fewer frames\n   per packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay\
    \ insensitive\n   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would\
    \ be\n   acceptable.\n"

    \ the total\n   number of octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count\

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined in\
    \ this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification [3], and any appropriate RTP profile.  This implies\n\
    \   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.\n   Because\
    \ the data compression used with this payload format is applied\n   end-to-end,\
    \ encryption may be performed after compression so there is\n   no conflict between\
    \ the two operations.\n   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data\
    \ encodings using\n   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end\n\
    \   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams\n   into\
    \ the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to\n   be overloaded.\
    \  However, this encoding does not exhibit any\n   significant non-uniformity.\n\
    \   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may\n   be\
    \ overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either\n   desired or\
    \ undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to\n   discard packets\
    \ from undesired sources, but the processing cost of\n   the authentication itself\
    \ may be too high.  In a multicast\n   environment, pruning of specific sources\
    \ may be implemented in future\n   versions of IGMP [7] and in multicast routing\
    \ protocols to allow a\n   receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach\
    \ it.\n"
