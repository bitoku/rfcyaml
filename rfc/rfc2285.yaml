  - "1. Introduction\n   This document is intended to provide terminology for the\
    \ benchmarking\n   of local area network (LAN) switching devices.  It extends\
    \ the\n   terminology already defined for benchmarking network interconnect\n\
    \   devices in RFCs 1242 and 1944 to switching devices.\n   Although it might\
    \ be found useful to apply some of the terms defined\n   here to a broader range\
    \ of network interconnect devices, this RFC\n   primarily deals with devices which\
    \ switch frames at the Medium Access\n   Control (MAC) layer.  It defines terms\
    \ in relation to the traffic put\n   to use when benchmarking switching devices,\
    \ forwarding performance,\n   congestion control, latency, address handling and\
    \ filtering.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1 Unidirectional traffic\n   Definition:\n      When all frames presented\
    \ to the input interfaces of a DUT/SUT are\n      addressed to output interfaces\
    \ which do not themselves receive any\n      frames.\n   Discussion:\n      This\
    \ definition conforms to the discussion in section 16 of RFC\n      1944 which\
    \ describes how unidirectional traffic can be offered to\n      a DUT/SUT to measure\
    \ throughput.  Unidirectional traffic is also\n      appropriate for:\n      -the\
    \ measurement of the minimum inter-frame gap -the creation of\n      many-to-one\
    \ or one-to-many interface overload -the detection of\n      head of line blocking\
    \ -the measurement of forwarding rates and\n      throughput when congestion control\
    \ mechanisms are active.\n      When a tester offers unidirectional traffic to\
    \ a DUT/SUT reception\n      and transmission are handled by different interfaces\
    \ or sets of\n      interfaces of the DUT/SUT.  All frames received from the tester\
    \ by\n      the DUT/SUT are transmitted back to the tester from interfaces\n \
    \     which do not themselves receive any frames.\n      It is useful to distinguish\
    \ traffic orientation and traffic\n      distribution when considering traffic\
    \ patterns used in device\n      testing.  Unidirectional traffic, for example,\
    \ is traffic\n      orientated in a single direction between mutually exclusive\
    \ sets\n      of source and destination interfaces of a DUT/SUT.  Such traffic,\n\
    \      however, can be distributed between interfaces in different ways.\n   \
    \   When traffic is sent to two or more interfaces from an external\n      source\
    \ and then forwarded by the DUT/SUT to a single output\n      interface the traffic\
    \ orientation is unidirectional and the\n      traffic distribution between interfaces\
    \ is many-to-one.  Traffic\n      can also be sent to a single input interface\
    \ and forwarded by the\n      DUT/SUT to two or more output interfaces to achieve\
    \ a one-to-many\n      distribution of traffic.\n      Such traffic distributions\
    \ can also be combined to test for head\n      of line blocking or to measure\
    \ forwarding rates and throughput\n      when congestion control mechanisms are\
    \ active.\n      When a DUT/SUT is equipped with interfaces running at different\n\
    \      media rates the number of input interfaces required to load or\n      overload\
    \ an output interface or interfaces will vary.\n      It should be noted that\
    \ measurement of the minimum inter-frame gap\n      serves to detect violations\

    \     This definition follows from the discussion in section 16 of RFC\n     \
    \ 1944 on multi-port testing.  Partially meshed traffic allows for\n      one-to-many,\

    \ devices or systems more\n      than fully meshed traffic.  When offered partially\

  - "3.3.3 Fully meshed traffic\n   Definition:\n      Frames offered to a designated\
    \ number of interfaces of a DUT/SUT\n      such that each one of the interfaces\
    \ under test receives frames\n      addressed to all of the other interfaces under\
    \ test.\n   Discussion:\n      As with bidirectional partially meshed traffic,\
    \ fully meshed\n      traffic requires each one the interfaces of a DUT/SUT to\
    \ both\n      receive and transmit frames.  But since the interfaces are not\n\
    \      divided into groups as with partially meshed traffic every\n      interface\
    \ forwards frames to and receives frames from every other\n      interface.  The\
    \ total number of individual input/output interface\n      pairs when traffic\
    \ is fully meshed over n switched interfaces\n      equals n x (n - 1).  This\
    \ compares with n x (n / 2) such interface\n      pairs when traffic is partially\
    \ meshed.\n      Fully meshed traffic on half duplex interfaces is inherently\n\
    \      bursty since interfaces must interrupt transmission whenever they\n   \
    \   receive frames.  This kind of bursty meshed traffic is\n      characteristic\
    \ of real network traffic and can be advantageously\n      used to diagnose a\
    \ DUT/SUT by exercising many of its component\n      parts simultaneously.  Additional\
    \ inspection may be warranted to\n      correlate the frame forwarding capacity\
    \ of a DUT/SUT when offered\n      meshed traffic and the behavior of individual\
    \ elements such as\n      input or output buffers, buffer allocation mechanisms,\
    \ aggregate\n      switching capacity, processing speed or medium access control.\n\
    \      The analysis of forwarding rate measurements presents a challenge\n   \
    \   when offering bidirectional or fully meshed traffic since the rate\n     \
    \ at which the tester can be observed to transmit frames to the\n      DUT/SUT\
    \ may be smaller than the rate at which it intends to\n      transmit due to collisions\
    \ on half duplex media or the action of\n      congestion control mechanisms.\
    \  This makes it important to take\n      account of both the intended and offered\
    \ loads defined in sections\n      3.5.1.and 3.5.2 below when reporting the results\
    \ of such\n      forwarding rate measurements.\n      When offering bursty meshed\
    \ traffic to a DUT/SUT a number of\n      variables have to be considered.  These\
    \ include frame size, the\n      number of frames within bursts, the interval\
    \ between bursts as\n      well as the distribution of load between incoming and\
