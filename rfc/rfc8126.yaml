  - "Abstract\n   Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants\n\
    \   to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values\n   in\
    \ these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote\n   interoperability,\
    \ their allocations are often coordinated by a\n   central record keeper.  For\
    \ IETF protocols, that role is filled by\n   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\
    \ (IANA).\n   To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance\n  \
    \ describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned,\n   as\
    \ well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made,\n   is needed.\
    \  This document defines a framework for the documentation\n   of these guidelines\
    \ by specification authors, in order to assure that\n   the provided guidance\
    \ for the IANA Considerations is clear and\n   addresses the various issues that\
    \ are likely in the operation of a\n   registry.\n   This is the third edition\
    \ of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that\
    \ use constants\n   to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the\
    \ values\n   in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote\n   interoperability,\
    \ their allocations are often coordinated by a\n   central record keeper.  The\
    \ Protocol field in the IP header [RFC791]\n   and MIME media types [RFC6838]\
    \ are two examples of such\n   coordinations.\n   The IETF selects an IANA Functions\
    \ Operator (IFO) for protocol\n   parameters defined by the IETF.  In the contract\
    \ between the IETF and\n   the current IFO (ICANN), that entity is referred to\
    \ as the IANA\n   PROTOCOL PARAMETER SERVICES Operator, or IPPSO.  For consistency\
    \ with\n   past practice, the IFO or IPPSO is referred to in this document as\n\
    \   \"IANA\" [RFC2860].\n   In this document, we call the range of possible values\
    \ for such a\n   field a \"namespace\".  The binding or association of a specific\
    \ value\n   with a particular purpose within a namespace is called an assignment\n\
    \   (or, variously: an assigned number, assigned value, code point,\n   protocol\
    \ constant, or protocol parameter).  The act of assignment is\n   called a registration,\
    \ and it takes place in the context of a\n   registry.  The terms \"assignment\"\
    \ and \"registration\" are used\n   interchangeably throughout this document.\n\
    \   To make assignments in a given namespace prudently, guidance\n   describing\
    \ the conditions under which new values should be assigned,\n   as well as when\
    \ and how modifications to existing values can be made,\n   is needed.  This document\
    \ defines a framework for the documentation\n   of these guidelines by specification\
    \ authors, in order to assure that\n   the guidance for the IANA Considerations\
    \ is clear and addresses the\n   various issues that are likely in the operation\
    \ of a registry.\n   Typically, this information is recorded in a dedicated section\
    \ of the\n   specification with the title \"IANA Considerations\".\n"
- title: 1.1.  Keep IANA Considerations for IANA
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Keep IANA Considerations for IANA\n   The purpose of having a dedicated\
    \ IANA Considerations section is to\n   provide a single place to collect clear\
    \ and concise information and\n   instructions for IANA.  Technical documentation\
    \ should reside in\n   other parts of the document; the IANA Considerations should\
    \ refer to\n   these other sections by reference only (as needed).  Using the\
    \ IANA\n   Considerations section as primary technical documentation both hides\n\
    \   it from the target audience of the document and interferes with\n   IANA's\
    \ review of the actions they need to take.\n   An ideal IANA Considerations section\
    \ clearly enumerates and specifies\n   each requested IANA action; includes all\
    \ information IANA needs, such\n   as the full names of all applicable registries;\
    \ and includes clear\n   references to elsewhere in the document for other information.\n\
    \   The IANA actions are normally phrased as requests for IANA (such as,\n   \"\
    IANA is asked to assign the value TBD1 from the Frobozz\n   Registry...\"); the\
    \ RFC Editor will change those sentences to reflect\n   the actions taken (\"\
    IANA has assigned the value 83 from the Frobozz\n   Registry...\").\n"
- title: 1.2.  For Updated Information
  contents:
  - "1.2.  For Updated Information\n   IANA maintains a web page that includes additional\
    \ clarification\n   information beyond what is provided here, such as minor updates\
    \ and\n   summary guidance.  Document authors should check that page.  Any\n \
    \  significant updates to the best current practice will have to feed\n   into\
    \ updates to BCP 26 (this document), which is definitive.\n      <https://iana.org/help/protocol-registration>\n"
- title: 1.3.  A Quick Checklist Upfront
  contents:
  - "1.3.  A Quick Checklist Upfront\n   It's useful to be familiar with this document\
    \ as a whole.  But when\n   you return for quick reference, here are checklists\
    \ for the most\n   common things you'll need to do and references to help with\
    \ the less\n   common ones.\n   In general...\n   1.  Put all the information\
    \ that IANA will need to know into the\n       \"IANA Considerations\" section\
    \ of your document (see Section 1.1).\n   2.  Try to keep that section only for\
    \ information to IANA and to\n       designated expert reviewers; put significant\
    \ technical\n       information in the appropriate technical sections of the document\n\
    \       (see Section 1.1).\n   3.  Note that the IESG has the authority to resolve\
    \ issues with IANA\n       registrations.  If you have any questions or problems,\
    \ you should\n       consult your document shepherd and/or working group chair,\
    \ who\n       may ultimately involve an Area Director (see Section 3.3).\n   If\
    \ you are creating a new registry...\n   1.  Give the registry a descriptive name\
    \ and provide a brief\n       description of its use (see Section 2.2).\n   2.\
    \  Identify any registry grouping that it should be part of (see\n       Section\
    \ 2.1).\n   3.  Clearly specify what information is required in order to register\n\
    \       new items (see Section 2.2).  Be sure to specify data types,\n       lengths,\
    \ and valid ranges for fields.\n   4.  Specify the initial set of items for the\
    \ registry, if applicable\n       (see Section 2.2).\n   5.  Make sure the change\
    \ control policy for the registry is clear to\n       IANA, in case changes to\
    \ the format or policies need to be made\n       later (see Sections 2.3 and 9.5).\n\
    \   6.  Select a registration policy -- or a set of policies -- to use\n     \
    \  for future registrations (see Section 4, and especially note\n       Sections\
    \ 4.11 and 4.12).\n   7.  If you're using a policy that requires a designated\
    \ expert\n       (Expert Review or Specification Required), understand Section\
    \ 5\n       and provide review guidance to the designated expert (see\n      \
    \ Section 5.3).\n   8.  If any items or ranges in your registry need to be reserved\
    \ for\n       special use or are otherwise unavailable for assignment, see\n \
    \      Section 6.\n   If you are registering into an existing registry...\n  \
    \ 1.  Clearly identify the registry by its exact name and optionally by\n    \
    \   its URL (see Section 3.1).\n   2.  If the registry has multiple ranges from\
    \ which assignments can be\n       made, make it clear which range is requested\
    \ (see Section 3.1).\n   3.  Avoid using specific values for numeric or bit assignments,\
    \ and\n       let IANA pick a suitable value at registration time (see\n     \
    \  Section 3.1).  This will avoid registration conflicts among\n       multiple\
    \ documents.\n   4.  For \"reference\" fields, use the document that provides\
    \ the best\n       and most current documentation for the item being registered.\n\
    \       Include section numbers to make it easier for readers to locate\n    \
    \   the relevant documentation (see Sections 3.1 and 7).\n   5.  Look up (in the\
    \ registry's reference document) what information\n       is required for the\
    \ registry and accurately provide all the\n       necessary information (see Section\
    \ 3.1).\n   6.  Look up (in the registry's reference document) any special rules\n\
    \       or processes there may be for the registry, such as posting to a\n   \
    \    particular mailing list for comment, and be sure to follow the\n       process\
    \ (see Section 3.1).\n   7.  If the registration policy for the registry does\
    \ not already\n       dictate the change control policy, make sure it's clear\
    \ to IANA\n       what the change control policy is for the item, in case changes\n\
    \       to the registration need to be made later (see Section 9.5).\n   If you're\
    \ writing a \"bis\" document or otherwise making older\n   documents obsolete,\
    \ see Section 8.\n   If you need to make an early registration, such as for supporting\n\
    \   test implementations during document development, rather than waiting\n  \
    \ for your document to be finished and approved, see [RFC7120].\n   If you need\
    \ to change the format/contents or policies for an existing\n   registry, see\
    \ Section 2.4.\n   If you need to update an existing registration, see Section\
    \ 3.2.\n   If you need to close down a registry because it is no longer needed,\n\
    \   see Section 9.6.\n"
- title: 2.  Creating and Revising Registries
  contents:
  - "2.  Creating and Revising Registries\n   Defining a registry involves describing\
    \ the namespaces to be created,\n   listing an initial set of assignments (if\
    \ applicable), and\n   documenting guidelines on how future assignments are to\
    \ be made.\n   When defining a registry, consider structuring the namespace in\
    \ such\n   a way that only top-level assignments need to be made with central\n\
    \   coordination, and those assignments can delegate lower-level\n   assignments\
    \ so coordination for them can be distributed.  This\n   lessens the burden on\
    \ IANA for dealing with assignments, and is\n   particularly useful in situations\
    \ where distributed coordinators have\n   better knowledge of their portion of\
    \ the namespace and are better\n   suited to handling those assignments.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Organization of Registries
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Organization of Registries\n   All registries are anchored from the IANA\
    \ \"Protocol Registries\" page:\n      <https://www.iana.org/protocols>\n   That\
    \ page lists registries in protocol category groups, placing\n   related registries\
    \ together and making it easier for users of the\n   registries to find the necessary\
    \ information.  Clicking on the title\n   of one of the registries on the IANA\
    \ Protocol Registries page will\n   take the reader to the details page for that\
    \ registry.\n   Unfortunately, we have been inconsistent in how we refer to these\n\
    \   entities.  The group names, as they are referred to here, have been\n   variously\
    \ called \"protocol category groups\", \"groups\", \"top-level\n   registries\"\
    , or just \"registries\".  The registries under them have\n   been called \"registries\"\
    \ or \"sub-registries\".\n   Regardless of the terminology used, document authors\
    \ should pay\n   attention to the registry groupings, should request that related\n\
    \   registries be grouped together to make related registries easier to\n   find,\
    \ and, when creating a new registry, should check whether that\n   registry might\
    \ best be included in an existing group.  That grouping\n   information should\
    \ be clearly communicated to IANA in the registry\n   creation request.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Documentation Requirements for Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Documentation Requirements for Registries\n   Documents that create a new\
    \ namespace (or modify the definition of an\n   existing space) and that expect\
    \ IANA to play a role in maintaining\n   that space (serving as a repository for\
    \ registered values) must\n   provide clear instructions on details of the namespace,\
    \ either in the\n   IANA Considerations section or referenced from it.\n   In\
    \ particular, such instructions must include:\n   The name of the registry\n \
    \     This name will appear on the IANA web page and will be referred to\n   \
    \   in future documents that need to allocate a value from the new\n      space.\
    \  The full name (and abbreviation, if appropriate) should be\n      provided.\
    \  It is highly desirable that the chosen name not be\n      easily confused with\
    \ the name of another registry.\n      When creating a registry, the group that\
    \ it is a part of must be\n      identified using its full name, exactly as it\
    \ appears in the\n      Protocol Registries list.\n      Providing a URL to precisely\
    \ identify the registry helps IANA\n      understand the request.  Such URLs can\
    \ be removed from the RFC\n      prior to final publication or left in the document\
    \ for reference.\n      If you include iana.org URLs, IANA will provide corrections,\
    \ if\n      necessary, during their review.\n   Required information for registrations\n\
    \      This tells registrants what information they have to include in\n     \
    \ their registration requests.  Some registries require only the\n      requested\
    \ value and a reference to a document where use of the\n      value is defined.\
    \  Other registries require a more detailed\n      registration template that\
    \ describes relevant security\n      considerations, internationalization considerations,\
    \ and other\n      such information.\n   Applicable registration policy\n    \
    \  The policy that will apply to all future requests for\n      registration.\
    \  See Section 4.\n   Size, format, and syntax of registry entries\n      What\
    \ fields to record in the registry, any technical requirements\n      on registry\
    \ entries (valid ranges for integers, length limitations\n      on strings, and\
    \ such), and the exact format in which registry\n      values should be displayed.\
    \  For numeric assignments, one should\n      specify whether values are to be\
    \ recorded in decimal, in\n      hexadecimal, or in some other format.\n     \
    \ Strings are expected to be ASCII, and it should be clearly\n      specified\
    \ whether case matters, and whether, for example, strings\n      should be shown\
    \ in the registry in uppercase or lowercase.\n      Strings that represent protocol\
    \ parameters will rarely, if ever,\n      need to contain non-ASCII characters.\
    \  If non-ASCII characters are\n      really necessary, instructions should make\
    \ it very clear that they\n      are allowed and that the non-ASCII characters\
    \ should be\n      represented as Unicode characters using the \"(U+XXXX)\" convention.\n\
    \      Anyone creating such a registry should think carefully about this\n   \

  - "2.3.  Specifying Change Control for a Registry\n   Registry definitions and registrations\
    \ within registries often need\n   to be changed after they are created.  The\
    \ process of making such\n   changes is complicated when it is unclear who is\
    \ authorized to make\n   the changes.  For registries created by RFCs in the IETF\
    \ stream,\n   change control for the registry lies by default with the IETF, via\n\
    \   the IESG.  The same is true for value registrations made in IETF-\n   stream\
    \ RFCs.\n   Because registries can be created and registrations can be made\n\
    \   outside the IETF stream, it can sometimes be desirable to have change\n  \
    \ control outside the IETF and IESG, and clear specification of change\n   control\
    \ policies is always helpful.\n   It is advised, therefore, that all registries\
    \ that are created\n   clearly specify a change control policy and a change controller.\
    \  It\n   is also advised that registries that allow registrations from outside\n\
    \   the IETF stream include, for each value, the designation of a change\n   controller\
    \ for that value.  If the definition or reference for a\n   registered value ever\
    \ needs to change, or if a registered value needs\n   to be deprecated, it is\
    \ critical that IANA know who is authorized to\n   make the change.  For example,\
    \ the Media Types registry [RFC6838]\n   includes a \"Change Controller\" in its\
    \ registration template.  See\n   also Section 9.5.\n"

    \ changes to the format of\n   an already existing (previously created) registry\
    \ (whether created\n   explicitly or implicitly) follows a process similar to\
    \ that used when\n   creating a new registry.  That is, a document is produced\
    \ that makes\n   reference to the existing namespace and then provides detailed\n\
    \   guidance for handling assignments in the registry or detailed\n   instructions\
    \ about the changes required.\n   If a change requires a new column in the registry,\
    \ the instructions\n   need to be clear about how to populate that column for\
    \ the existing\n   entries.  Other changes may require similar clarity.\n   Such\
    \ documents are normally processed with the same document status\n   as the document\
    \ that created the registry.  Under some circumstances,\n   such as with a straightforward\
    \ change that is clearly needed (such as\n   adding a \"status\" column), or when\
    \ an earlier error needs to be\n   corrected, the IESG may approve an update to\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Documentation Requirements for Registrations\n   Often, documents request\
    \ an assignment in an existing registry (one\n   created by a previously published\
    \ document).\n   Such documents should clearly identify the registry into which\
    \ each\n   value is to be registered.  Use the exact registry name as listed on\n\
    \   the IANA web page, and cite the RFC where the registry is defined.\n   When\
    \ referring to an existing registry, providing a URL to precisely\n   identify\
    \ the registry is helpful (see Section 2.2).\n   There is no need to mention what\
    \ the assignment policy is when making\n   new assignments in existing registries,\
    \ as that should be clear from\n   the references.  However, if multiple assignment\
    \ policies might\n   apply, as in registries with different ranges that have different\n\
    \   policies, it is important to make it clear which range is being\n   requested,\
    \ so that IANA will know which policy applies and can assign\n   a value in the\
    \ correct range.\n   Be sure to provide all the information required for a registration,\n\
    \   and follow any special processes that are set out for the registry.\n   Registries\
    \ sometimes require the completion of a registration\n   template for registration\
    \ or ask registrants to post their request to\n   a particular mailing list for\
    \ discussion prior to registration.  Look\n   up the registry's reference document:\
    \ the required information and\n   special processes should be documented there.\n\
    \   Normally, numeric values to be used are chosen by IANA when the\n   document\
    \ is approved; drafts should not specify final values.\n   Instead, placeholders\
    \ such as \"TBD1\" and \"TBD2\" should be used\n   consistently throughout the\
    \ document, giving each item to be\n   registered a different placeholder.  The\
    \ IANA Considerations should\n   ask the RFC Editor to replace the placeholder\
    \ names with the IANA-\n   assigned values.  When drafts need to specify numeric\
    \ values for\n   testing or early implementations, they will either request early\n\
    \   allocation (see Section 3.4) or use values that have already been set\n  \
    \ aside for testing or experimentation (if the registry in question\n   allows\
    \ that without explicit assignment).  It is important that\n   drafts not choose\
    \ their own values, lest IANA assign one of those\n   values to another document\
    \ in the meantime.  A draft can request a\n   specific value in the IANA Considerations\
    \ section, and IANA will\n   accommodate such requests when possible, but the\
    \ proposed number\n   might have been assigned to some other use by the time the\
    \ draft is\n   approved.\n   Normally, text-string values to be used are specified\
    \ in the\n   document, as collisions are less likely with text strings.  IANA\
    \ will\n   consult with the authors if there is, in fact, a collision, and a\n\
    \   different value has to be used.  When drafts need to specify string\n   values\
    \ for testing or early implementations, they sometimes use the\n   expected final\
    \ value.  But it is often useful to use a draft value\n   instead, possibly including\
    \ the draft version number.  This allows\n   the early implementations to be distinguished\
    \ from those implementing\n   the final version.  A document that intends to use\
    \ \"foobar\" in the\n   final version might use \"foobar-testing-draft-05\" for\
    \ the -05 version\n   of the draft, for example.\n   For some registries, there\
    \ is a long-standing policy prohibiting\n   assignment of names or codes on a\
    \ vanity or organization-name basis.\n   For example, codes might always be assigned\
    \ sequentially unless there\n   is a strong reason for making an exception.  Nothing\
    \ in this document\n   is intended to change those policies or prevent their future\n\
    \   application.\n   As an example, the following text could be used to request\
    \ assignment\n   of a DHCPv6 option number:\n      IANA is asked to assign an\
    \ option code value of TBD1 to the DNS\n      Recursive Name Server option and\
    \ an option code value of TBD2 to\n      the Domain Search List option from the\
    \ DHCP option code space\n      defined in Section 24.3 of RFC 3315.\n   The IANA\
    \ Considerations section should summarize all of the IANA\n   actions, with pointers\
    \ to the relevant sections elsewhere in the\n   document as appropriate.  Including\
    \ section numbers is especially\n   useful when the reference document is large;\
    \ the section numbers will\n   make it easier for those searching the reference\
    \ document to find the\n   relevant information.\n   When multiple values are\
    \ requested, it is generally helpful to\n   include a summary table of the additions/changes.\
    \  It is also helpful\n   for this table to be in the same format as it appears\
    \ or will appear\n   on the IANA web site.  For example:\n     Value     Description\
    \          Reference\n     --------  -------------------  ---------\n     TBD1\
    \      Foobar               this RFC, Section 3.2\n     TBD2      Gumbo      \
    \          this RFC, Section 3.3\n     TBD3      Banana               this RFC,\
    \ Section 3.4\n   Note: In cases where authors feel that including the full table\
    \ of\n   changes is too verbose or repetitive, authors should still include\n\
    \   the table in the draft, but may include a note asking that the table\n   be\
    \ removed prior to publication of the final RFC.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Updating Existing Registrations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Updating Existing Registrations\n   Even after a number has been assigned,\
    \ some types of registrations\n   contain additional information that may need\
    \ to be updated over time.\n   For example, MIME media types, character sets,\
    \ and language tags\n   typically include more information than just the registered\
    \ value\n   itself, and may need updates to items such as point-of-contact\n \
    \  information, security issues, pointers to updates, and literature\n   references.\n\
    \   In such cases, the document defining the namespace must clearly state\n  \
    \ who is responsible for maintaining and updating a registration.\n   Depending\
    \ on the registry, it may be appropriate to specify one or\n   more of:\n   o\
    \  Letting registrants and/or nominated change controllers update\n      their\
    \ own registrations, subject to the same constraints and\n      review as with\
    \ new registrations.\n   o  Allowing attachment of comments to the registration.\
    \  This can be\n      useful in cases where others have significant objections\
    \ to a\n      registration, but the author does not agree to change the\n    \

- title: 3.3.  Overriding Registration Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Overriding Registration Procedures\n   Experience has shown that the documented\
    \ IANA considerations for\n   individual protocols do not always adequately cover\
    \ the reality of\n   registry operation or are not sufficiently clear.  In addition,\n\
    \   documented IANA considerations are sometimes found to be too\n   stringent\
    \ to allow even working group documents (for which there is\n   strong consensus)\
    \ to perform a registration in advance of actual RFC\n   publication.\n   In order\
    \ to allow assignments in such cases, the IESG is granted\n   authority to override\
    \ registration procedures and approve assignments\n   on a case-by-case basis.\n\
    \   The intention here is not to overrule properly documented procedures\n   or\
    \ to obviate the need for protocols to properly document their IANA\n   considerations.\
    \  Rather, it is to permit assignments in specific\n   cases where it is obvious\
    \ that the assignment should just be made,\n   but updating the IANA process beforehand\
    \ is too onerous.\n   When the IESG is required to take action as described above,\
    \ it is a\n   strong indicator that the applicable registration procedures should\n\
    \   be updated, possibly in parallel with the work that instigated it.\n   IANA\
    \ always has the discretion to ask the IESG for advice or\n   intervention when\
    \ they feel it is needed, such as in cases where\n   policies or procedures are\
    \ unclear to them, where they encounter\n   issues or questions they are unable\

    \   when early implementations are created while the document is still\n   under\
    \ development.\n   IANA has a mechanism for handling such early allocations in\
    \ some\n   cases.  See [RFC7120] for details.  It is usually not necessary to\n\

- title: 4.  Choosing a Registration Policy and Well-Known Policies
  contents:
  - "4.  Choosing a Registration Policy and Well-Known Policies\n   A registration\
    \ policy is the policy that controls how new assignments\n   in a registry are\
    \ accepted.  There are several issues to consider\n   when defining the registration\
    \ policy.\n   If the registry's namespace is limited, assignments will need to\
    \ be\n   made carefully to prevent exhaustion.\n   Even when the space is essentially\
    \ unlimited, it is still often\n   desirable to have at least a minimal review\
    \ prior to assignment in\n   order to:\n   o  prevent the hoarding of or unnecessary\
    \ wasting of values.  For\n      example, if the space consists of text strings,\
    \ it may be\n      desirable to prevent entities from obtaining large sets of\
    \ strings\n      that correspond to desirable names (existing company names, for\n\
    \      example).\n   o  provide a sanity check that the request actually makes\
    \ sense and\n      is necessary.  Experience has shown that some level of minimal\n\
    \      review from a subject matter expert is useful to prevent\n      assignments\
    \ in cases where the request is malformed or not\n      actually needed (for example,\
    \ an existing assignment for an\n      essentially equivalent service already\
    \ exists).\n   Perhaps most importantly, unreviewed extensions can impact\n  \
    \ interoperability and security.  See [RFC6709].\n   When the namespace is essentially\
    \ unlimited and there are no\n   potential interoperability or security issues,\
    \ assigned numbers can\n   usually be given out to anyone without any subjective\
    \ review.  In\n   such cases, IANA can make assignments directly, provided that\
    \ IANA is\n   given detailed instructions on what types of requests it should\n\
    \   grant, and it is able to do so without exercising subjective\n   judgment.\n\
    \   When this is not the case, some level of review is required.\n   However,\
    \ it's important to balance adequate review and ease of\n   registration.  In\
    \ many cases, those making registrations will not be\n   IETF participants; requests\
    \ often come from other standards\n   organizations, from organizations not directly\
    \ involved in standards,\n   from ad-hoc community work (from an open-source project,\
    \ for\n   example), and so on.  Registration must not be unnecessarily\n   difficult,\
    \ unnecessarily costly (in terms of time and other\n   resources), nor unnecessarily\
    \ subject to denial.\n   While it is sometimes necessary to restrict what gets\
    \ registered\n   (e.g., for limited resources such as bits in a byte, or for items\
    \ for\n   which unsupported values can be damaging to protocol operation), in\n\
    \   many cases having what's in use represented in the registry is more\n   important.\
    \  Overly strict review criteria and excessive cost (in time\n   and effort) discourage\
    \ people from even attempting to make a\n   registration.  If a registry fails\
    \ to reflect the protocol elements\n   actually in use, it can adversely affect\
    \ deployment of protocols on\n   the Internet, and the registry itself is devalued.\n\
    \   Therefore, it is important to think specifically about the\n   registration\
    \ policy, and not just pick one arbitrarily nor copy text\n   from another document.\
    \  Working groups and other document developers\n   should use care in selecting\
    \ appropriate registration policies when\n   their documents create registries.\
    \  They should select the least\n   strict policy that suits a registry's needs,\
    \ and look for specific\n   justification for policies that require significant\
    \ community\n   involvement (those stricter than Expert Review or Specification\n\
    \   Required, in terms of the well-known policies).  The needs here will\n   vary\
    \ from registry to registry, and, indeed, over time, and this BCP\n   will not\
    \ be the last word on the subject.\n   The following policies are defined for\
    \ common usage.  These cover a\n   range of typical policies that have been used\
    \ to describe the\n   procedures for assigning new values in a namespace.  It\
    \ is not\n   strictly required that documents use these terms; the actual\n  \
    \ requirement is that the instructions to IANA be clear and\n   unambiguous. \
    \ However, use of these terms is strongly recommended\n   because their meanings\
    \ are widely understood.  Newly minted policies,\n   including ones that combine\
    \ the elements of procedures associated\n   with these terms in novel ways, may\
    \ be used if none of these policies\n   are suitable; it will help the review\
    \ process if an explanation is\n   included as to why that is the case.  The terms\
    \ are fully explained\n   in the following subsections.\n      1.   Private Use\n\
    \      2.   Experimental Use\n      3.   Hierarchical Allocation\n      4.   First\

    \      10.  IESG Approval\n   It should be noted that it often makes sense to\
    \ partition a namespace\n   into multiple categories, with assignments within\
    \ each category\n   handled differently.  Many protocols now partition namespaces\
    \ into\n   two or more parts, with one range reserved for Private or\n   Experimental\
    \ Use while other ranges are reserved for globally unique\n   assignments assigned\
    \ following some review process.  Dividing a\n   namespace into ranges makes it\
    \ possible to have different policies in\n   place for different ranges and different\
    \ use cases.\n   Similarly, it will often be useful to specify multiple policies\
    \ in\n   parallel, with each policy being used under different circumstances.\n\
    \   For more discussion of that topic, see Section 4.12.\n   Examples of RFCs\

    \ are made to\n   anyone on a first come, first served basis.  There is no substantive\n\
    \   review of the request, other than to ensure that it is well-formed\n   and\
    \ doesn't duplicate an existing assignment.  However, requests must\n   include\
    \ a minimal amount of clerical information, such as a point of\n   contact (including\
    \ an email address, and sometimes a postal address)\n   and a brief description\
    \ of how the value will be used.  Additional\n   information specific to the type\
    \ of value requested may also need to\n   be provided, as defined by the namespace.\
    \  For numbers, IANA\n   generally assigns the next in-sequence unallocated value,\
    \ but other\n   values may be requested and assigned if an extenuating circumstance\n\
    \   exists.  With names, specific text strings can usually be requested.\n   When\
    \ creating a new registry with First Come First Served as the\n   registration\
    \ policy, in addition to the contact person field or\n   reference, the registry\
    \ should contain a field for change controller.\n   Having a change controller\
    \ for each entry for these types of\n   registrations makes authorization of future\
    \ modifications more clear.\n   See Section 2.3.\n   It is important that changes\
    \ to the registration of a First Come\n   First Served code point retain compatibility\
    \ with the current usage\n   of that code point, so changes need to be made with\
    \ care.  The change\n   controller should not, in most cases, be requesting incompatible\n\
    \   changes nor repurposing a registered code point.  See also Sections\n   9.4\
    \ and 9.5.\n   A working group or any other entity that is developing a protocol\n\
    \   based on a First Come First Served code point has to be extremely\n   careful\
    \ that the protocol retains wire compatibility with current use\n   of the code\
    \ point.  Once that is no longer true, the new work needs\n   to change to a different\
    \ code point (and register that use at the\n   appropriate time).\n   It is also\
    \ important to understand that First Come First Served\n   really has no filtering.\
    \  Essentially, any well-formed request is\n   accepted.\n   Examples:\n     \
    \ SASL mechanism names [RFC4422]\n      LDAP Protocol Mechanisms and LDAP Syntax\

    \   require formal documentation, information needs to be provided with\n   the\
    \ request for the designated expert to evaluate.  The registry's\n   definition\
    \ needs to make clear to registrants what information is\n   necessary.  The actual\
    \ process for requesting registrations is\n   administered by IANA (see Section\
    \ 1.2 for details).\n   (This policy was also called \"Designated Expert\" in\

    .)\n   The required documentation and review criteria, giving clear guidance\n\

    \  It is particularly important to lay out what should be\n   considered when\

  - "4.6.  Specification Required\n   For the Specification Required policy, review\
    \ and approval by a\n   designated expert (see Section 5) is required, and the\
    \ values and\n   their meanings must be documented in a permanent and readily\n\
    \   available public specification, in sufficient detail so that\n   interoperability\
    \ between independent implementations is possible.\n   This policy is the same\
    \ as Expert Review, with the additional\n   requirement of a formal public specification.\
    \  In addition to the\n   normal review of such a request, the designated expert\
    \ will review\n   the public specification and evaluate whether it is sufficiently\n\
    \   stable and permanent, and sufficiently clear and technically sound to\n  \
    \ allow interoperable implementations.\n   The intention behind \"permanent and\
    \ readily available\" is that a\n   document can reasonably be expected to be\
    \ findable and retrievable\n   long after IANA assignment of the requested value.\
    \  Publication of an\n   RFC is an ideal means of achieving this requirement,\
    \ but\n   Specification Required is intended to also cover the case of a\n   document\
    \ published outside of the RFC path, including informal\n   documentation.\n \
    \  For RFC publication, formal review by the designated expert is still\n   requested,\
    \ but the normal RFC review process is expected to provide\n   the necessary review\
    \ for interoperability.  The designated expert's\n   review is still important,\
    \ but it's equally important to note that\n   when there is IETF consensus, the\
    \ expert can sometimes be \"in the\n   rough\" (see also the last paragraph of\
    \ Section 5.4).\n   As with Expert Review (Section 4.5), clear guidance to the\
    \ designated\n   expert should be provided when defining the registry, and thorough\n\
    \   understanding of Section 5 is important.\n   When specifying this policy,\
    \ just use the term \"Specification\n   Required\".  Some specifications have\
    \ chosen to refer to it as \"Expert\n   Review with Specification Required\",\
    \ and that only causes confusion.\n   Examples:\n      Diffserv-aware TE Bandwidth\

    \ policies benefit from both community\n   experience and wide understanding,\
    \ their use is encouraged, and the\n   creation of new policies needs to be accompanied\
    \ by reasonable\n   justification.\n   It is also acceptable to cite one or more\
    \ well-known policies and\n   include additional guidelines for what kind of considerations\
    \ should\n   be taken into account by the review process.\n   For example, for\
    \ media-type registrations [RFC6838], a number of\n   different situations are\
    \ covered that involve the use of IETF Review\n   and Specification Required,\
    \ while also including specific additional\n   criteria the designated expert\
    \ should follow.  This is not meant to\n   represent a registration procedure,\
    \ but to show an example of what\n   can be done when special circumstances need\
    \ to be covered.\n   The well-known policies from \"First Come First Served\"\
    \ to \"Standards\n   Action\" specify a range of policies in increasing order\
    \ of strictness\n   (using the numbering from the full list in Section 4):\n \

    \ sufficient documentation for review.\n      6. Specification Required\n    \
    \     Significant stable public documentation sufficient for\n         interoperability.\n\
    \   7. RFC Required\n      Any RFC publication, IETF or a non-IETF Stream.\n \
    \  8. IETF Review\n      RFC publication, IETF Stream only, but need not be Standards\n\
    \      Track.\n   9. Standards Action\n      RFC publication, IETF Stream, Standards\
    \ Track or BCP only.\n   Examples of situations that might merit IETF Review or\
    \ Standards\n   Action include the following:\n   o  When a resource is limited,\
    \ such as bits in a byte (or in two\n      bytes, or four), or numbers in a limited\
    \ range.  In these cases,\n      allowing registrations that haven't been carefully\
    \ reviewed and\n      agreed to by community consensus could too quickly deplete\
    \ the\n      allowable values.\n   o  When thorough community review is necessary\
    \ to avoid extending or\n      modifying the protocol in ways that could be damaging.\
    \  One\n      example is in defining new command codes, as opposed to options\n\
    \      that use existing command codes: the former might require a strict\n  \
    \    policy, where a more relaxed policy could be adequate for the\n      latter.\
    \  Another example is in defining protocol elements that\n      change the semantics\
    \ of existing operations.\n   o  When there are security implications with respect\
    \ to the resource,\n      and thorough review is needed to ensure that the new\
    \ usage is\n      sound.  Examples of this include lists of acceptable hashing\
    \ and\n      cryptographic algorithms, and assignment of transport ports in the\n\
    \      system range.\n   When reviewing a document that asks IANA to create a\
    \ new registry or\n   change a registration policy to any policy more stringent\
    \ than Expert\n   Review or Specification Required, the IESG should ask for\n\
    \   justification to ensure that more relaxed policies have been\n   considered\
    \ and that the more strict policy is the right one.\n   Accordingly, document\
    \ developers need to anticipate this and document\n   their considerations for\
    \ selecting the specified policy (ideally, in\n   the document itself; failing\
    \ that, in the shepherd writeup).\n   Likewise, the document shepherd should ensure\
    \ that the selected\n   policies have been justified before sending the document\
    \ to the IESG.\n   When specifications are revised, registration policies should\
    \ be\n   reviewed in light of experience since the policies were set.\n"
- title: 4.12.  Using Multiple Policies in Combination
  contents:
  - "4.12.  Using Multiple Policies in Combination\n   In some situations, it is necessary\
    \ to define multiple registration\n   policies.  For example, registrations through\
    \ the normal IETF process\n   might use one policy, while registrations from outside\
    \ the process\n   would have a different policy applied.\n   Thus, a particular\
    \ registry might want to use a policy such as \"RFC\n   Required\" or \"IETF Review\"\
    \ sometimes, with a designated expert\n   checking a \"Specification Required\"\
    \ policy at other times.\n   The alternative to using a combination requires either\
    \ that all\n   requests come through RFCs or that requests in RFCs go through\
    \ review\n   by the designated expert, even though they already have IETF review\n\
    \   and consensus.\n   This can be documented in the IANA Considerations section\
    \ when the\n   registry is created, for example:\n      IANA is asked to create\
    \ the registry \"Fruit Access Flags\" under\n      the \"Fruit Parameters\" group.\
    \  New registrations will be permitted\n      through either the IETF Review policy\
    \ or the Specification\n      Required policy [BCP26].  The latter should be used\
    \ only for\n      registrations requested by SDOs outside the IETF.  Registrations\n\
    \      requested in IETF documents will be subject to IETF review.\n   Such combinations\
    \ will commonly use one of {Standards Action, IETF\n   Review, RFC Required} in\
    \ combination with one of {Specification\n   Required, Expert Review}.  Guidance\
    \ should be provided about when\n   each policy is appropriate, as in the example\
    \ above.\n"
- title: 4.13.  Provisional Registrations
  contents:
  - "4.13.  Provisional Registrations\n   Some existing registries have policies that\
    \ allow provisional\n   registration: see URI Schemes [RFC7595] and Email Header\
    \ Fields\n   [RFC3864].  Registrations that are designated as provisional are\n\
    \   usually defined as being more readily created, changed, reassigned,\n   moved\
    \ to another status, or removed entirely.  URI Schemes, for\n   example, allow\
    \ provisional registrations to be made with incomplete\n   information.\n   Allowing\
    \ provisional registration ensures that the primary goal of\n   maintaining a\
    \ registry -- avoiding collisions between incompatible\n   semantics -- is achieved\
    \ without the side effect of \"endorsing\" the\n   protocol mechanism the provisional\
    \ value is used for.  Provisional\n   registrations for codepoints that are ultimately\
    \ standardized can be\n   promoted to permanent status.  The criteria that are\
    \ defined for\n   converting a provisional registration to permanent will likely\
    \ be\n   more strict than those that allowed the provisional registration.\n \
    \  If your registry does not have a practical limit on codepoints,\n   perhaps\
    \ adding the option for provisional registrations might be\n   right for that\
    \ registry as well.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Motivation for Designated Experts\n   Discussion on a mailing list\
    \ can provide valuable technical feedback,\n   but opinions often vary and discussions\
    \ may continue for some time\n   without clear resolution.  In addition, IANA\
    \ cannot participate in\n   all of these mailing lists and cannot determine if\
    \ or when such\n   discussions reach consensus.  Therefore, IANA relies on a \"\
    designated\n   expert\" for advice regarding the specific question of whether\
    \ an\n   assignment should be made.  The designated expert is an individual\n\
    \   who is responsible for carrying out an appropriate evaluation and\n   returning\
    \ a recommendation to IANA.\n   It should be noted that a key motivation for having\
    \ designated\n   experts is for the IETF to provide IANA with a subject matter\
    \ expert\n   to whom the evaluation process can be delegated.  IANA forwards\n\
    \   requests for an assignment to the expert for evaluation, and the\n   expert\
    \ (after performing the evaluation) informs IANA as to whether\n   or not to make\
    \ the assignment or registration.  In most cases, the\n   registrants do not work\
    \ directly with the designated experts.  The\n   list of designated experts for\
    \ a registry is listed in the registry.\n   It will often be useful to use a designated\
    \ expert only some of the\n   time, as a supplement to other processes.  For more\
    \ discussion of\n   that topic, see Section 4.12.\n"
- title: 5.2.  The Role of the Designated Expert
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The Role of the Designated Expert\n   The designated expert is responsible\
    \ for coordinating the appropriate\n   review of an assignment request.  The review\
    \ may be wide or narrow,\n   depending on the situation and the judgment of the\
    \ designated expert.\n   This may involve consultation with a set of technology\
    \ experts,\n   discussion on a public mailing list, consultation with a working\n\
    \   group (or its mailing list if the working group has disbanded), etc.\n   Ideally,\
    \ the designated expert follows specific review criteria as\n   documented with\
    \ the protocol that creates or uses the namespace.  See\n   the IANA Considerations\
    \ sections of [RFC3748] and [RFC3575] for\n   specific examples.\n   Designated\
    \ experts are expected to be able to defend their decisions\n   to the IETF community,\
    \ and the evaluation process is not intended to\n   be secretive or bestow unquestioned\
    \ power on the expert.  Experts are\n   expected to apply applicable documented\
    \ review or vetting procedures,\n   or in the absence of documented criteria,\
    \ follow generally accepted\n   norms such as those in Section 5.3.  Designated\
    \ experts are generally\n   not expected to be \"gatekeepers\", setting out to\
    \ make registrations\n   difficult to obtain, unless the guidance in the defining\
    \ document\n   specifies that they should act as such.  Absent stronger guidance,\n\
    \   the experts should be evaluating registration requests for\n   completeness,\
    \ interoperability, and conflicts with existing protocols\n   and options.\n \
    \  It has proven useful to have multiple designated experts for some\n   registries.\
    \  Sometimes those experts work together in evaluating a\n   request, while in\
    \ other cases additional experts serve as backups,\n   acting only when the primary\
    \ expert is unavailable.  In registries\n   with a pool of experts, the pool often\
    \ has a single chair responsible\n   for defining how requests are to be assigned\
    \ to and reviewed by\n   experts.  In other cases, IANA might assign requests\
    \ to individual\n   members in sequential or approximate random order.  The document\n\
    \   defining the registry can, if it's appropriate for the situation,\n   specify\
    \ how the group should work -- for example, it might be\n   appropriate to specify\
    \ rough consensus on a mailing list, within a\n   related working group or among\
    \ a pool of designated experts.\n   In cases of disagreement among multiple experts,\
    \ it is the\n   responsibility of those experts to make a single clear recommendation\n\
    \   to IANA.  It is not appropriate for IANA to resolve disputes among\n   experts.\
    \  In extreme situations, such as deadlock, the designating\n   body may need\
    \ to step in to resolve the problem.\n   If a designated expert has a conflict\
    \ of interest for a particular\n   review (is, for example, an author or significant\
    \ proponent of a\n   specification related to the registration under review),\
    \ that expert\n   should recuse himself.  In the event that all the designated\
    \ experts\n   are conflicted, they should ask that a temporary expert be designated\n\
    \   for the conflicted review.  The responsible AD may then appoint\n   someone\
    \ or the AD may handle the review.\n   This document defines the designated expert\
    \ mechanism with respect to\n   documents in the IETF stream only.  If other streams\
    \ want to use\n   registration policies that require designated experts, it is\
    \ up to\n   those streams (or those documents) to specify how those designated\n\

    \ the delay (some requests may be\n      particularly complex), and if this is\
    \ a recurring event, IANA must\n      raise the issue with the IESG.  Because\
    \ of the problems caused by\n      delayed evaluations and assignments, the IESG\
    \ should take\n      appropriate actions to ensure that the expert understands\
    \ and\n      accepts his or her responsibilities, or appoint a new expert.\n \
    \  o  The designated expert is not required to personally bear the\n      burden\
    \ of evaluating and deciding all requests, but acts as a\n      shepherd for the\
    \ request, enlisting the help of others as\n      appropriate.  In the case that\
    \ a request is denied, and rejecting\n      the request is likely to be controversial,\
    \ the expert should have\n      the support of other subject matter experts. \
    \ That is, the expert\n      must be able to defend a decision to the community\
    \ as a whole.\n   When a designated expert is used, the documentation should give\
    \ clear\n   guidance to the designated expert, laying out criteria for performing\n\
    \   an evaluation and reasons for rejecting a request.  In the case where\n  \
    \ there are no specific documented criteria, the presumption should be\n   that\
    \ a code point should be granted unless there is a compelling\n   reason to the\
    \ contrary (and see also Section 5.4).  Reasons that have\n   been used to deny\
    \ requests have included these:\n   o  Scarcity of code points, where the finite\
    \ remaining code points\n      should be prudently managed, or where a request\
    \ for a large number\n      of code points is made and a single code point is\
    \ the norm.\n   o  Documentation is not of sufficient clarity to evaluate or ensure\n\
    \      interoperability.\n   o  The code point is needed for a protocol extension,\
    \ but the\n      extension is not consistent with the documented (or generally\n\
    \      understood) architecture of the base protocol being extended and\n    \
    \  would be harmful to the protocol if widely deployed.  It is not\n      the\
    \ intent that \"inconsistencies\" refer to minor differences \"of a\n      personal\
    \ preference nature\".  Instead, they refer to significant\n      differences\
    \ such as inconsistencies with the underlying security\n      model, implying\
    \ a change to the semantics of an existing message\n      type or operation, requiring\
    \ unwarranted changes in deployed\n      systems (compared with alternate ways\
    \ of achieving a similar\n      result), etc.\n   o  The extension would cause\
    \ problems with existing deployed systems.\n   o  The extension would conflict\
    \ with one under active development by\n      the IETF, and having both would\
    \ harm rather than foster\n      interoperability.\n   Documents must not name\
    \ the designated expert(s) in the document\n   itself; instead, any suggested\
    \ names should be relayed to the\n   appropriate Area Director at the time the\
    \ document is sent to the\n   IESG for approval.  This is usually done in the\
    \ document shepherd\n   writeup.\n   If the request should also be reviewed on\
    \ a specific public mailing\n   list, its address should be specified.\n"

    \      Experimental:  Available for general experimental use as described\n  \

    \ item is defined and explained in the current\n      document, it is important\
    \ to include sufficient information to\n      enable implementors to understand\
    \ the item and to create a proper\n      implementation.\n   o  If the registered\
    \ item is explained primarily in a specific\n      section of the reference document,\
    \ it is useful to include a\n      section reference.  For example, \"[RFC4637],\
    \ Section 3.2\", rather\n      than just \"[RFC4637]\".\n   o  For documentation\
    \ of a new registry, the reference should provide\n      information about the\

    \ includes the purpose of the\n      registry, a rationale for its creation, documentation\
    \ of the\n      process and policy for new registrations, guidelines for new\n\
    \      registrants or designated experts, and other such related\n      information.\
    \  But note that, while it's important to include this\n      information in the\

- title: 8.  What to Do in "bis" Documents
  contents:
  - "8.  What to Do in \"bis\" Documents\n   On occasion, an RFC is issued that obsoletes\
    \ a previous edition of\n   the same document.  We sometimes call these \"bis\"\
    \ documents, such as\n   when RFC 4637 is to be obsoleted by draft-ietf-foo-rfc4637bis.\
    \  When\n   the original document created registries and/or registered entries,\n\
    \   there is a question of how to handle the IANA Considerations section\n   in\
    \ the \"bis\" document.\n   If the registrations specify the original document\
    \ as a reference,\n   those registrations should be updated to point to the current\
    \ (not\n   obsolete) documentation for those items.  Usually, that will mean\n\
    \   changing the reference to be the \"bis\" document.\n   There will, though,\
    \ be times when a document updates another, but\n   does not make it obsolete,\
    \ and the definitive reference is changed\n   for some items but not for others.\
    \  Be sure that the references\n   always point to the correct, current documentation\
    \ for each item.\n   For example, suppose RFC 4637 registered the \"BANANA\" flag\
    \ in the\n   \"Fruit Access Flags\" registry, and the documentation for that flag\
    \ is\n   in Section 3.2.\n   The current registry might look, in part, like this:\n\
    \      Name      Description          Reference\n      --------  -------------------\
    \  ---------\n      BANANA    Flag for bananas     [RFC4637], Section 3.2\n  \
    \ If draft-ietf-foo-rfc4637bis obsoletes RFC 4637 and, because of some\n   rearrangement,\
    \ now documents the flag in Section 4.1.2, the IANA\n   Considerations of the\
    \ bis document might contain text such as this:\n      IANA is asked to change\
    \ the registration information for the\n      BANANA flag in the \"Fruit Access\
    \ Flags\" registry to the\n      following:\n      Name      Description     \
    \     Reference\n      --------  -------------------  ---------\n      BANANA\
    \    Flag for bananas     [[this RFC]], Section 4.2.1\n   In many cases, if there\
    \ are a number of registered references to the\n   original RFC and the document\
    \ organization has not changed the\n   registered section numbering much, it may\
    \ simply be reasonable to do\n   this:\n      Because this document obsoletes\
    \ RFC 4637, IANA is asked to change\n      all registration information that references\
    \ [RFC4637] to instead\n      reference [[this RFC]].\n   If information for registered\
    \ items has been or is being moved to\n   other documents, then the registration\
    \ information should be changed\n   to point to those other documents.  In most\
    \ cases, documentation\n   references should not be left pointing to the obsoleted\
    \ document for\n   registries or registered items that are still in current use.\
    \  For\n   registries or registered items that are no longer in current use, it\n\
    \   will usually make sense to leave the references pointing to the old\n   document\
    \ -- the last current reference for the obsolete items.  The\n   main point is\
    \ to make sure that the reference pointers are as useful\n   and current as is\
    \ reasonable, and authors should consider that as\n   they write the IANA Considerations\
    \ for the new document.  As always:\n   do the right thing, and there is flexibility\
    \ to allow for that.\n   It is extremely important to be clear in your instructions\
    \ regarding\n   updating references, especially in cases where some references\
    \ need\n   to be updated and others do not.\n"

- title: 9.1.  When There Are No IANA Actions
  contents:
  - "9.1.  When There Are No IANA Actions\n   Before an Internet-Draft can be published\
    \ as an RFC, IANA needs to\n   know what actions (if any) it needs to perform.\
    \  Experience has shown\n   that it is not always immediately obvious whether\
    \ a document has no\n   IANA actions, without reviewing the document in some detail.\
    \  In\n   order to make it clear to IANA that it has no actions to perform (and\n\
    \   that the author has consciously made such a determination), such\n   documents\
    \ should, after the authors confirm that this is the case,\n   include an IANA\
    \ Considerations section that states:\n      This document has no IANA actions.\n\
    \   IANA prefers that these \"empty\" IANA Considerations sections be left\n \
    \  in the document for the record: it makes it clear later on that the\n   document\
    \ explicitly said that no IANA actions were needed (and that\n   it wasn't just\
    \ omitted).  This is a change from the prior practice of\n   requesting that such\
    \ sections be removed by the RFC Editor, and\n   authors are asked to accommodate\

- title: 9.3.  After-the-Fact Registrations
  contents:
  - "9.3.  After-the-Fact Registrations\n   Occasionally, the IETF becomes aware that\
    \ an unassigned value from a\n   namespace is in use on the Internet or that an\
    \ assigned value is\n   being used for a different purpose than it was registered\
    \ for.  The\n   IETF does not condone such misuse; procedures of the type described\n\
    \   in this document need to be applied to such cases, and it might not\n   always\
    \ be possible to formally assign the desired value.  In the\n   absence of specifications\
    \ to the contrary, values may only be\n   reassigned for a different purpose with\
    \ the consent of the original\n   assignee (when possible) and with due consideration\
    \ of the impact of\n   such a reassignment.  In cases of likely controversy, consultation\n\
    \   with the IESG is advised.\n   This is part of the reason for the advice in\
    \ Section 3.1 about using\n   placeholder values, such as \"TBD1\", during document\
    \ development:\n   problems are often caused by the open use of unregistered values\n\
    \   after results from well-meant, early implementations, where the\n   implementations\
    \ retained the use of developmental code points that\n   never proceeded to a\
    \ final IANA assignment.\n"
- title: 9.4.  Reclaiming Assigned Values
  contents:
  - "9.4.  Reclaiming Assigned Values\n   Reclaiming previously assigned values for\
    \ reuse is tricky, because\n   doing so can lead to interoperability problems\
    \ with deployed systems\n   still using the assigned values.  Moreover, it can\
    \ be extremely\n   difficult to determine the extent of deployment of systems\
    \ making use\n   of a particular value.  However, in cases where the namespace\
    \ is\n   running out of unassigned values and additional ones are needed, it\n\
    \   may be desirable to attempt to reclaim unused values.  When\n   reclaiming\
    \ unused values, the following (at a minimum) should be\n   considered:\n   o\
    \  Attempts should be made to contact the original party to which a\n      value\
    \ is assigned, to determine if the value was ever used, and if\n      so, the\
    \ extent of deployment.  (In some cases, products were never\n      shipped or\
    \ have long ceased being used.  In other cases, it may be\n      known that a\
    \ value was never actually used at all.)\n   o  Reassignments should not normally\
    \ be made without the concurrence\n      of the original requester.  Reclamation\
    \ under such conditions\n      should only take place where there is strong evidence\
    \ that a value\n      is not widely used, and the need to reclaim the value outweighs\n\
    \      the cost of a hostile reclamation.  IESG Approval is needed in\n      this\
    \ case.\n   o  It may be appropriate to write up the proposed action and solicit\n\
    \      comments from relevant user communities.  In some cases, it may be\n  \
    \    appropriate to write an RFC that goes through a formal IETF\n      process\
    \ (including IETF Last Call) as was done when DHCP reclaimed\n      some of its\
    \ \"Private Use\" options [RFC3942].\n   o  It may be useful to differentiate\
    \ between revocation, release, and\n      transfer.  Revocation occurs when IANA\
    \ removes an assignment,\n      release occurs when the assignee initiates that\
    \ removal, and\n      transfer occurs when either revocation or release is coupled\
    \ with\n      immediate reassignment.  It may be useful to specify procedures\n\
    \      for each of these or to explicitly prohibit combinations that are\n   \
    \   not desired.\n"
- title: 9.5.  Contact Person vs Assignee or Owner
  contents:
  - "9.5.  Contact Person vs Assignee or Owner\n   Many registries include designation\
    \ of a technical or administrative\n   contact associated with each entry.  Often,\
    \ this is recorded as\n   contact information for an individual.  It is unclear,\
    \ though, what\n   role the individual has with respect to the registration: is\
    \ this\n   item registered on behalf of the individual, the company the\n   individual\
    \ worked for, or perhaps another organization the individual\n   was acting for?\n\
    \   This matters because some time later, when the individual has changed\n  \
    \ jobs or roles, and perhaps can no longer be contacted, someone might\n   want\
    \ to update the registration.  IANA has no way to know what\n   company, organization,\
    \ or individual should be allowed to take the\n   registration over.  For registrations\
    \ rooted in RFCs, the stream\n   owner (such as the IESG or the IAB) can make\
    \ an overriding decision.\n   But in other cases, there is no recourse.\n   Registries\
    \ can include, in addition to a \"Contact\" field, an\n   \"Assignee\" or \"Owner\"\
    \ field (also referred to as \"Change Controller\")\n   that can be used to address\
    \ this situation, giving IANA clear\n   guidance as to the actual owner of the\
    \ registration.  This is\n   strongly advised, especially for registries that\
    \ do not require RFCs\n   to manage their information (e.g., registries with policies\
    \ such as\n   First Come First Served (Section 4.4), Expert Review (Section 4.5),\n\

    \   clarifications from document authors, relevant working group chairs,\n   designated\
    \ experts, and mail list participants.\n   Information concerning possible security\
    \ vulnerabilities of a\n   protocol may change over time.  Likewise, security\
    \ vulnerabilities\n   related to how an assigned number is used may change as\
    \ well.  As new\n   vulnerabilities are discovered, information about such\n \
    \  vulnerabilities may need to be attached to existing registrations so\n   that\
    \ users are not misled as to the true security issues surrounding\n   the use\
    \ of a registered number.\n   Security needs to be considered as part of the selection\
    \ of a\n   registration policy.  For some protocols, registration of certain\n\
    \   parameters will have security implications, and registration policies\n  \
    \ for the relevant registries must ensure that requests get appropriate\n   review\

  - "14.2.  2008: Changes in RFC 5226 Relative to RFC 2434\n   Changes include:\n\
    \   o  Major reordering of text to expand descriptions and to better\n      group\
    \ topics such as \"updating registries\" vs. \"creating new\n      registries\"\
    , in order to make it easier for authors to find the\n      text most applicable\
    \ to their needs.\n   o  Numerous editorial changes to improve readability.\n\
    \   o  Changed the term \"IETF Consensus\" to \"IETF Review\" and added more\n\
    \      clarifications.  History has shown that people see the words \"IETF\n \
    \     Consensus\" (without consulting the actual definition) and are\n      quick\
    \ to make incorrect assumptions about what the term means in\n      the context\
    \ of IANA Considerations.\n   o  Added \"RFC Required\" to list of defined policies.\n\
    \   o  Much more explicit directions and examples of \"what to put in\n      RFCs\"\
    .\n   o  \"Specification Required\" now implies use of a designated expert to\n\
    \      evaluate specs for sufficient clarity.\n   o  Added a section describing\
    \ provisional registrations.\n   o  Significantly changed the wording in the \"\
    Designated Experts\"\n      section.  Main purpose is to make clear that Expert\
    \ Reviewers are\n      accountable to the community, and to provide some guidance\
    \ for\n      review criteria in the default case.\n   o  Changed wording to remove\
    \ any special appeals path.  The normal\n      RFC 2026 appeals path is used.\n\
    \   o  Added a section about reclaiming unused values.\n   o  Added a section\
    \ on after-the-fact registrations.\n   o  Added a section indicating that mailing\
    \ lists used to evaluate\n      possible assignments (such as by a designated\
    \ expert) are subject\n      to normal IETF rules.\n"
