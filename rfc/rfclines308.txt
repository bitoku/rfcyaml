Several months ago a SURVEY program was implemented on the MIT DMCG ITS PDP 10 system to aid in gathering information on the availability of various HOSTS on the ARPANET.
The purpose of this 1.
to inform the Network Working Group of the existence of this information gathering service and about getting access to it, 2.
to present the results of SURVEY for its first few months, and 3.
to correct errors in our data or collection methods.
Briefly, the SURVEY program works as follows:
At 15 minute intervals whenever the MIT DMCG ITS Time Sharing system is in normal operation, a SURVEY is started.
The SURVEY program attempts to establish a connection to the LOGGER (socket 1) of each HOST listed in its table.
The results of each connection attempt are recorded for future reference.
The Initial Connection Protocol is aborted prior to reading the transmitted socket number so as to cause the minimum amount of processing at SURVEYed HOSTS.
If the LOGGER connection succeeds, the average request for connection response time (in seconds) for the HOST is updated.
This information can later be viewed in several formats using the MIT DMCG server TELNET "NETWRK" as described below.
Each test results in the assignment of one of the following five statuses: 1.
LOGGER not responding RFC sent (HOST HOST OK), but no response (20 seconds allowed).
LOGGER rejecting CLOSE returned by NCP. 4.
timed out (15 seconds allowed).
HOST dead host dead status returned by IMP.
MIT DMCG ITS Time Sharing System is in normal operation and the MIT IMP is operational.
Thus the current figure of 94% for MIT DMCG is inaccurate.
(It should actually be closer to 66%.)
There are, in addition, two other shortcomings of which we are aware.
The first is that SURVEY is on a 24 hour basis and does  not  consider advertised up time.
For example, MIT DMCG will never be better than 67% on a Tuesday since the machine is always unavailable from 4 p.m. to midnight.
The second shortcoming is the fact that the Lincoln Lab's TX 2 shows as "never available".
This reflects an as yet undiagnosed problem currently under investigation.
To get availability information from DMCG, you must first follow the scenario in RFC 254.
Once in NETWRK, the DMCG user TELNET, there are seven available commands which pertain to SURVEY data: SUMMARY.OF.SURVEYS summarizes most recent information.
<host name> gives a detailed recent history of the given host.
This generates a lot of output, so use it sparingly.
ACTIVE.HOSTS lists those hosts who accepted a connection at least once during the last 24 hours.
BEST.SURVEY lists the best of the recent surveys.
LONGTERM SUMMARY.OF.SURVEYS summarizes all past information.
This was used to generate the table on the next page.
> gives a summary of past history of the given host.
It does not generate as much output as the HISTORY command.
LONGTERM ACTIVE.HOSTS lists those hosts who accepted a connection at least once since December 13, 1971.
