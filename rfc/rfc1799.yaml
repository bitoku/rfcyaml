    \         Names\nThe OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys\
    \ to\nentries in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1.\nWhen\
    \ a distinguished name is communicated between to users not using a\ndirectory\
    \ protocol (e.g., in a mail message), there is a need to have a\nuser-oriented\
    \ string representation of distinguished name. This\nspecification defines a string\

    \ of commonly used names, whilst\nbeing able to represent any distinguished name.\
