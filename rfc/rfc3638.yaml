  - "Abstract\n   This memo recommends that RFC 1643 be reclassified as an Historic\n\
    \   document and provides the supporting motivation for that\n   recommendation.\n"
- title: 1.  Details
  contents:
  - "1.  Details\n   STD 50, RFC 1643 [RFC1643], \"Definitions of Managed Objects\
    \ for the\n   Ethernet-like Interface Types\", and its SMIv2 equivalent, RFC 1650\n\
    \   [RFC1650], are applicable to half-duplex 10 Mb/s Ethernet interfaces\n   only.\
    \  Subsequent to the 1994 publication of these documents, 100\n   Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s,\
    \ and 10 Gb/s Ethernet interface types have been\n   developed, and full-duplex\
    \ operation at 10 Mb/s has been\n   standardized.  Updates to RFC 1650 have been\
    \ produced to accommodate\n   these new technologies [RFC2358] [RFC2665] [RFC2666]\
    \ [RFC3635].\n   These updates define new MIB objects to supplement those defined\
    \ in\n   RFC 1643 and RFC 1650 and in addition deprecate some of the objects\n\
    \   in RFC 1643 and RFC 1650 that are no longer considered useful.  They\n   also\
    \ levy a requirement for implementations of the EtherLike-MIB to\n   support the\
    \ MAU-MIB [RFC2239] [RFC2668] [RFC3636] as well.\n   RFC 1643 is an obsolete specification,\
    \ overtaken by events.  Its\n   SMIv2 equivalent, RFC 1650, was officially retired\
    \ in 1998.  New\n   implementations -- even those that support only half-duplex\
    \ 10 Mb/s\n   interfaces -- should comply with in the latest version of the\n\
    \   specification, currently RFC 3635 [RFC3635] and RFC 2666 [RFC2666],\n   instead\
    \ of RFC 1643.  It is therefore recommended that RFC 1643 be\n   reclassified\
    \ as an Historic document.\n"

  - "2.  Effect on Other Standards Track Documents\n   Reclassification of RFC 1643\
    \ will have no impact on the status of any\n   standards track RFC because no\
    \ standards track RFC cites it as a\n   normative reference.  An RFC content search\
    \ made with the tools\n   available at http://www.rfc-editor.org reveals the following\n\
    \   standards track documents that cite RFC 1643:\n      Document            \
    \   Title\n      --------               -----\n      RFC 2020         IEEE 802.12\

    \ Interface Types\n      RFC 2720         Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB\n\
    \      RFC 3635         Definitions of Managed Objects for the\n             \
    \          Ethernet-like Interface Types\n   RFC 2020 [RFC2020] contains DOT12-IF-MIB,\
    \ which is the MIB module for\n   managing IEEE 802.12 100VG-AnyLAN interfaces.\
    \  It refers to RFC 1643\n   in the context of an admonition not to implement\
    \ the EtherLike-MIB\n   for any interface where the DOT12-IF-MIB is implemented.\n\
    \   RFC 2358 [RFC2358], RFC 2665 [RFC2665], and RFC 3635 [RFC3635] all\n   contain\
    \ updated versions of the EtherLike-MIB.  They refer to RFC\n   1643 in the context\
    \ of explaining the history of the EtherLike-MIB,\n   and the citation in RFC\
    \ 3635 is explicitly listed as a non-normative\n   reference.\n   RFC 2720 [RFC2720]\
    \ contains the FLOW-METER-MIB.  It refers to RFC\n   1643 only in an ASN.1 comment\
    \ in the MIB module.  Omission of that\n   comment would not preclude correct\
    \ implementation of the MIB module.\n   Clearly, none of these citations are normative.\n"
