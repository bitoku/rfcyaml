- title: 1.3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Overview\n   The framework for Layer 1 VPNs is described in [RFC4847].\
    \  Basic mode\n   operation is further defined in [RFC5251].  [RFC5251] identifies\
    \ the\n   information that is necessary to map customer information (port\n  \
    \ identifiers) to provider information (identifiers).  It also states\n   that\
    \ this mapping information may be provided via provisioning or via\n   an auto-discovery\
    \ mechanism.  [RFC5252] provides such an auto-\n   discovery mechanism using Open\
    \ Shortest Path First (OSPF) version 2.\n   This document provides the same functionality\
    \ using OSPF version 3\n   and adds support for IPv6.\n   Figure 1 shows the L1VPN\
    \ basic service being supported using OSPF-\n   based L1VPN auto-discovery.  This\
    \ figure shows two PE routers\n   interconnected over a GMPLS backbone.  Each\
    \ PE is attached to three\n   CE devices belonging to three different Layer 1\
    \ VPNs.  In this\n   network, OSPF is used to provide the VPN membership, port\
    \ mapping,\n   and related information required to support basic mode operation.\n\

    \                 Figure 1: OSPF Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs\n   The approach used\
    \ in this document to provide OSPFv3-based L1VPN\n   auto-discovery uses a new\
    \ type of Link State Advertisement (LSA),\n   which is referred to as an OSPFv3\
    \ L1VPN LSA.  The OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA\n   carries information in TLV (type, length,\
    \ value) structures.  An\n   L1VPN-specific TLV is defined below to propagate\
    \ VPN membership and\n   port information.  This TLV is referred to as the L1VPN\
    \ Info TLV.\n   The OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA may also carry Traffic Engineering (TE) TLVs;\n\
    \   see [RFC3630], [RFC4203], and [RFC5329].\n"

- title: 3.  OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing
  contents:
  - "3.  OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing\n   PEs advertise local <CPI,\
    \ PPI> tuples in OSPFv3 L1VPN LSAs containing\n   L1VPN Info TLVs.  Each PE MUST\
    \ originate a separate OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA\n   with area or AS flooding scope, based\
    \ on configuration, for each\n   local CE-PE link.  The LSA MUST be originated\
    \ each time a PE restarts\n   and every time there is a change in the PIT entry\
    \ associated with a\n   local CE-PE link.  The LSA MUST include a single L1VPN\
    \ Info TLV and\n   MAY include a single TE Link TLV.  The TE Link TLV carries\
    \ TE\n   attributes of the associated CE-PE link.  Note that because CEs are\n\
    \   outside of the provider TE domain, the attributes of CE-PE links are\n   not\
    \ advertised via normal OSPF-TE procedures as described in\n   [RFC5329].  If\
    \ more than one L1VPN Info TLVs and/or TE Link TLVs are\n   found in the LSA,\
    \ the subsequent TLVs SHOULD be ignored by the\n   receiving PEs.\n   Every time\
    \ a PE receives a new, removed, or modified OSPFv3 L1VPN\n   LSA, the PE MUST\
    \ check whether it maintains a PIT associated with the\n   L1VPN specified in\
    \ the L1VPN Globally Unique Identifier field.  If\n   this is the case (the appropriate\
    \ PIT will be found if one or more\n   local CE-PE links that belong to the L1VPN\
    \ are configured), the PE\n   SHOULD add, remove, or modify the PIT entry associated\
    \ with each of\n   the advertised CE-PE links accordingly.  (An implementation\
    \ MAY\n   choose to not remove or modify the PIT according to local policy or\n\
    \   management directives.)  Thus, in the normal steady-state case, all\n   PEs\
    \ associated with a particular L1VPN will have identical local PITs\n   for an\
    \ L1VPN.\n"
- title: 4.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4.  Backward Compatibility\n   Neither the TLV nor the LSA introduced in this\
    \ document present any\n   interoperability issues.  Per [RFC5340], and due to\
    \ the U-bit being\n   set, OSPFv3 speakers that do not support the OSPFv3 L1VPN\
    \ LSA (Ps for\n   example) just participate in the LSA's flooding process but\
    \ should\n   ignore the LSA's contents.\n"
- title: 5.  Manageability Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Manageability Considerations\n   The principal concern in operating an auto-discovery\
    \ mechanism for an\n   L1VPN is that the PE needs to be configured with information\
    \ about\n   which VPNs it supports.  This information can be discovered from the\n\
    \   CEs using some form of membership negotiation, but is more likely to\n   be\
    \ directly configured by the operator as described in [RFC4847],\n   [RFC5251],\
    \ and [RFC5253].  No standardized mechanisms to configure\n   this information\
    \ have been defined, and it is a matter for individual\n   implementations with\
    \ input from operator policy how a PE is told\n   which L1VPNs it supports.  It\
    \ is probable that configuration of this\n   information is closely tied to the\
    \ configuration of CE-facing ports\n   on the PE, which in turn causes PITs to\
    \ be established in the PE.\n   Additionally, it may be of value to an operator\
    \ to view the L1VPN\n   membership information that has been learned by a PE.\
    \  An\n   implementation may supply this information through a proprietary\n \
    \  interface, or may allow it to be inspected through the OSPFv3 MIB\n   module\
    \ [OSPFv3-MIB] or the Traffic Engineering Database MIB\n   [TED-MIB].\n   Note\
    \ that the operation of the control plane has no impact on IP\n   network traffic\
    \ because all of the user data is in Layer 1, while the\n   control plane is necessarily\
    \ out of band in a Data Communications\n   Network (DCN).\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Coexistence with and Migration from OSPFv2\n   It is expected that only\
    \ a single routing protocol instance will be\n   used to operate auto-discovery\

    \ migration from OSPFv2 to OSPFv3\n   and can be expected to be transient.\n \
    \  Migration from OSPFv2 to OSPFv3 would be a once-only event for any\n   network\
    \ and would probably depend on the migration of the routing\n   protocol used\
    \ within the network for normal GMPLS procedures.  The\n   migration process would\
    \ not be any different from the process used to\n   migrate the normal GMPLS routing\
    \ protocol.  The steps to follow are\n   clearly a matter for the operator of\
    \ the network and are not a matter\n   for standardization, but the following\
    \ sequence is provided to\n   illustrate the potential actions:\n   1. Assign\
    \ IPv6 addresses to all control plane and data plane\n      resources.\n   2.\
    \ Install and enable OSPFv3 on all controllers.\n   3. Use OSPFv3 to advertise\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 resource identifiers.\n   4. Manually verify the advertised membership\
    \ and topology information\n      from the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 databases.\n   5.\
    \ Start a maintenance window where data continues to flow, but no\n      L1VPN\
    \ connections can be changed.\n   6. Cut over to the OSPFv3 membership and topology\
    \ information.\n   7. Close the maintenance window.\n   8. Turn off OSPFv2.\n\
    \   9. Remove/disable the IPv4 address for all control plane and data\n      plane\
    \ resources.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The approach presented in this document describes\
    \ how PEs dynamically\n   learn L1VPN specific information.  Mechanisms to deliver\
    \ the VPN\n   membership information to CEs are explicitly out of scope of this\n\
    \   document.  Therefore, the security issues raised in this document are\n  \
    \ limited to within the OSPF domain.\n   This defined approach reuses mechanisms\
    \ defined in [RFC5340].\n   Therefore, the same security approaches and considerations\
    \ apply to\n   this approach.  OSPF provides several security mechanisms that\
    \ can be\n   applied.  Specifically, OSPF supports multiple types of\n   authentication,\
    \ limits the frequency of LSA origination and\n   acceptance, and provides techniques\
    \ to avoid and limit the impact of\n   database overflow.  In cases were end-to-end\
    \ authentication is\n   desired, OSPF's neighbor-to-neighbor authentication approach\
    \ can be\n   augmented with an approach similar to the experimental extension\
    \ to\n   OSPF, see [RFC2154], which supports the signing and authentication of\n\
    \   LSAs.\n"
