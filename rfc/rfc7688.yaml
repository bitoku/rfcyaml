  - "1.  Introduction\n   The documents [RFC6163], [RFC7446], and [RFC7581] explain\
    \ how to\n   extend the Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) control plane\n\
    \   to support both multiple WSON signal types and common hybrid electro-\n  \
    \ optical systems as well hybrid systems containing optical switching\n   and\
    \ electro-optical resources.  In WSON, not all the optical signals\n   in the\
    \ network are compatible with all network elements participating\n   in the network.\
    \  Therefore, signal compatibility is an important\n   constraint in path computation\
    \ in a WSON.\n   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support\n\
    \   signal compatibility constraints associated with general WSON network\n  \
    \ elements.  These routing enhancements are applicable in common\n   optical or\
    \ hybrid electro-optical networks where not all optical\n   signals in the network\
    \ are compatible with all network elements\n   participating in the network.\n\
    \   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical\n   or\
    \ hybrid electro-optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,\n   and wavelength\
    \ converters, since such systems can be limited to\n   processing only certain\
    \ types of WSON signals.\n   Related to this document is [RFC7580], which provides\
    \ GMPLS OSPF\n   routing enhancements to support the generic routing and label\n\
    \   assignment process that can be applicable to a wider range of\n   technologies\
    \ beyond WSON.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  The Optical Node Property TLV\n   [RFC3630] defines OSPF Traffic Engineering\
    \ (TE) Link State\n   Advertisement (LSA) using an opaque LSA.  This document\
    \ adds a new\n   top-level TLV for use in the OSPF TE LSA: the Optical Node Property\n\
    \   TLV.  The Optical Node Property TLV describes a single node.  It is\n   comprised\
    \ of a set of optional sub-TLVs.  There are no ordering\n   requirements for the\
    \ sub-TLVs.\n   When using the extensions defined in this document, at least one\n\
    \   Optical Node Property TLV MUST be advertised in each LSA.  To allow\n   for\
    \ fine-grained changes in topology, more than one Optical Node\n   Property TLV\
    \ MAY be advertised in a single LSA.  Implementations MUST\n   support receiving\
    \ multiple Optical Node Property TLVs in an LSA.\n   The Optical Node Property\
    \ TLV contains all WSON-specific node\n   properties and signal compatibility\
    \ constraints.  The detailed\n   encodings of these properties are defined in\
    \ [RFC7581].\n   The following sub-TLVs of the Optical Node Property TLV are defined:\n\
    \   Value    Length      Sub-TLV Type\n   1        variable    Resource Block\
    \ Information\n   2        variable    Resource Accessibility\n   3        variable\
    \    Resource Wavelength Constraints\n   4        variable    Resource Block Pool\
    \ State\n   5        variable    Resource Block Shared Access Wavelength\n   \
    \                     Availability\n   The detailed encodings of these sub-TLVs\
    \ are found in [RFC7581] as\n   indicated in the table below.\n   Sub-TLV Type\
    \                                Section from [RFC7581]\n   Resource Block Information\

    \       3.2\n   Resource Block Pool State                                3.3\n\
    \   Resource Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability     3.4\n   All sub-TLVs\
    \ defined here may occur at most once in any given Optical\n   Node TLV under\
    \ one TE LSA.  If more than one copy of the sub-TLV is\n   received in the same\
    \ LSA, the redundant sub-TLV SHOULD be ignored.\n   If the same sub-TLV is advertised\
    \ in a different TE LSA (which would\n   only occur if there was a packaging error),\
    \ then the sub-TLV with the\n   largest LSA ID (Section 2.2 of RFC 3630) SHOULD\
    \ be picked.  These\n   restrictions need not apply to future sub-TLVs.  Unrecognized\
    \ sub-\n   TLVs are ignored.\n   Among the sub-TLVs defined above, the Resource\
    \ Block Pool State sub-\n   TLV and Resource Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability\
    \ are\n   dynamic in nature, while the rest are static.  As such, they can be\n\
    \   separated out from the rest and be advertised with multiple TE LSAs\n   per\
    \ OSPF router, as described in [RFC3630] and [RFC5250].\n"

- title: 2.2.  Resource Accessibility
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Resource Accessibility\n   This sub-TLV describes the structure of the\
    \ resource pool in relation\n   to the switching device.  In particular, it indicates\
    \ the ability of\n   an ingress port to reach a resource block and of a resource\

- title: 2.3.  Resource Wavelength Constraints
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Resource Wavelength Constraints\n   Resources, such as wavelength converters,\

    \ due to the\n   structure of the optical system, not all wavelengths can necessarily\n\
    \   reach or leave all the resources.  The Resource Wavelength\n   Constraints\
    \ sub-TLV describes these properties.\n"

- title: 4.  WSON-Specific Scalability and Timeliness
  contents:
  - "4.  WSON-Specific Scalability and Timeliness\n   This document has defined five\
    \ sub-TLVs specific to WSON.  The\n   examples given in [RFC7581] show that very\
    \ large systems, in terms of\n   channel count, ports, or resources, can be very\
    \ efficiently encoded.\n   There has been concern expressed that some possible\
    \ systems may\n   produce LSAs that exceed the IP Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).\
    \  In\n   a typical node configuration, the Optical Node Property TLV will not\n\
    \   exceed the IP MTU.  A typical node configuration refers to a system\n   with\
    \ several hundreds of channels with an OEO element in the node.\n   This would\
    \ give the Optical Node Property TLV less than 350 bytes.\n   In addition, [RFC7581]\
    \ provides mechanisms to compactly encode\n   required information elements. \
    \ In a rare case where the TLV exceeds\n   the IP MTU, IP fragmentation/reassembly\
    \ can be used, which is an\n   acceptable method.  For IPv6, a node may use the\
    \ IPv6 Fragment header\n   to fragment the packet at the source and have it reassembled\
    \ at the\n   destination(s).\n   If the size of this LSA is greater than the MTU,\
    \ then these sub-TLVs\n   can be packed into separate LSAs.  From the point of\
    \ view of path\n   computation, the presence of the Resource Block Information\
    \ sub-TLV\n   indicates that resources exist in the system and may have signal\n\
    \   compatibility or other constraints.  The other four sub-TLVs indicate\n  \
    \ constraints on access to and availability of those resources.\n   Hence, the\
    \ \"synchronization\" procedure is quite simple from the point\n   of view of\
    \ path computation.  Until a Resource Block Information sub-\n   TLV is received\
    \ for a system, path computation cannot make use of the\n   other four sub-TLVs\
    \ since it does not know the nature of the\n   resources, e.g., whether the resources\
    \ are wavelength converters,\n   regenerators, or something else.  Once this sub-TLV\
    \ is received, path\n   computation can proceed with whatever sub-TLVs it may\
    \ have received\n   (their use is dependent upon the system type).\n   If path\
    \ computation proceeds with out-of-date or missing information\n   from these\
    \ sub-TLVs, then there is the possibility of either (a) path\n   computation yielding\
    \ a path that does not exist in the network, (b)\n   path computation failing\
    \ to find a path through the network that\n   actually exists.  Both situations\
    \ are currently encountered with\n   GMPLS, i.e., out-of-date information on constraints\
    \ or resource\n   availability.\n   If the new sub-TLVs or their attendant encodings\
    \ are malformed, a\n   proper implementation SHOULD log the problem and MUST stop\
    \ sending\n   the LSA that contains malformed TLVs or sub-TLVs.\n   Errors of\
    \ this nature SHOULD be logged for the local operator.\n   Implementations MUST\
    \ provide a rate limit on such logs, and that rate\n   limit SHOULD be configurable.\n\
    \   Note that the connection establishment mechanism (signaling or\n   management)\
    \ is ultimately responsible for the establishment of the\n   connection, and this\
    \ implies that such mechanisms must ensure signal\n   compatibility.\n"
