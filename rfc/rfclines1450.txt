27 RFC 1450    Management Information Base for SNMPv2
Introduction A network management system contains:
several (potentially many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey management information between the agents and management stations.
Operations of the protocol are carried out under an administrative framework which defines both authentication and authorization policies.
Network management stations execute management applications which monitor and control network elements.
Network elements are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled through access to their management information.
Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base (MIB).
Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules.
These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
The management protocol, SNMPv2 [3], provides for the exchange of messages which convey management information between the agents and the management stations.
It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which describe the behavior of a SNMPv2 entity.
For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet standard Network Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155, 1157, and 1212, is termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).
The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).

"The total number of packets received by the SNMPv2 entity from the transport service.
"The total number of packets which had an initial octet with a value of 30 hexadecimal received by a SNMPv2 entity which does not support SNMPv1. (Such packets are possibly misdirected SNMPv1 Messages.)
"The total number of packets received by the SNMPv2 entity which were improperly encoded or had invalid syntax."
"The total number of SnmpPrivMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity for which the privDst field was not a known local party."
"The total number of SnmpPrivMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which contained a SnmpAuthMsg for which the authData.dstParty field did not match the privDst field in the SnmpPrivMsg."
"The total number of SnmpAuthMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity for which the authData.srcParty field was not a known remote party."
"The total number of SnmpAuthMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which contained an authInfo field which was inconsistent with the authentication protocol associated with the source party."
"The total number of SnmpAuthMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which were deemed unauthentic due to their authInfo.authSrcTimestamp field being less than the source party's clock plus lifetime."
"The total number of SnmpAuthMsgs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which were deemed unauthentic due to their authInfo.authDigest field being unequal to the expected digest value."
"The total number of SnmpMgmtComs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity for which the context field was not a known SNMPv2 context."
"The total number of messages delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which were silently dropped because the PDU type referred to an operation not allowed in the aclTable[5]."
"The total number of GetRequest PDUs, GetNextRequest PDUs, GetBulkRequest PDUs, SetRequest PDUs, and InformRequest PDUs delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which were silently dropped because the size of an reply containing an alternate Response PDU with an empty variable  bindings field was greater than either a local constraint or the maximum message size of the request's source party."
A Case diagram[4] relating these objects
"The total number of SNMPv1 Messages delivered to the SNMPv2 entity which used a community name not known to the SNMPv2 entity.
"The total number of SNMPv1 Messages delivered to SNMPv2 entity containing an operation which was not allowed for the community named in the Message."
"The value of sysUpTime at the time of the most recent change in state or value of any instance of snmpORID."
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing the dynamically  configurable object resources in a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role.
SNMPv2 entities which do not support dynamically configurable object resources will never have any instances of the columnar objects in this table."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry (conceptual row) in the snmpORTable."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
The auxiliary variable used for identifying instances of the columnar objects in the snmpORTable."
"An authoritative identification of one of the dynamically configurable object resources in a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role.
This is analogous to the sysObjectID object in MIB II."
"A textual description of one of the dynamically  configurable object resources in a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role.
This is analogous to the sysDescr object in MIB II."
The authoritative identification of the trap currently being sent.
This variable occurs as the second varbind of a SNMPv2 Trap PDU."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
A table which keeps track of how many traps have been sent to each SNMPv2 entity."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry which keeps track of how many traps have been sent to a particular SNMPv2 entity."
"The number of traps which have been sent to a particular SNMPv2 party, since the last initialization of the SNMPv2 entity, or the creation of the SNMPv2 party, whichever occurred most recently."
The authoritative identification of the enterprise associated with the trap currently being sent.
When a SNMPv2 proxy agent is mapping an RFC1157 Trap PDU into a SNMPv2 Trap PDU, this variable occurs as the last varbind."
TruthValue MAX ACCESS read write
"Indicates whether the SNMPv2 entity, when acting in an agent role, is permitted to generate authenticationFailure traps.
The value of this object overrides any configuration information; as such, it provides a means whereby all authenticationFailure traps may be disabled.
Note that it is strongly recommended that this object be stored in non volatile memory so that it remains constant between re initializations of the network management system."
REFERENCE "Derived from RFC1213 MIB.snmpEnableAuthenTraps."
April 1993   well known traps snmpTraps
{ snmpMIBObjects 5 } coldStart NOTIFICATION TYPE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, is reinitializing itself such that its configuration may be altered."
A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, is reinitializing itself such that its configuration is unaltered."
A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, recognizes a failure in one of the communication links represented in its configuration."
authenticationFailure NOTIFICATION TYPE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol message that is not properly authenticated.
While all implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating this trap, the snmpV2EnableAuthenTraps object indicates whether this trap will be generated."
An egpNeighborLoss trap signifies that an EGP neighbor has been marked down and the EGP peer relationship no longer obtains."
SNMPv2 entities, all acting in a manager role, to   coordinate their use of the SNMPv2 set operation.
An advisory lock used to allow several cooperating SNMPv2 entities, all acting in a manager role, to coordinate their use of the SNMPv2 set operation.
This object is used for coarse grain coordination.
To achieve fine grain coordination, one or more similar objects might be defined within each MIB group, as appropriate."
snmpMIBCompliance MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for SNMPv2 entities which implement the SNMPv2 MIB."
