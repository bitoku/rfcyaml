- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ for\n   identifying NewsML NewsItems.  A NewsItem is an information resource\n\
    \   that is expressible as a NewsML element within a NewsML document\n   conforming\
    \ to the NewsML Document Type Declaration (DTD) as defined\n   by the International\
    \ Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC).\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   NewsML is an XML format for packaging multimedia news resources.\
    \  It\n   has been created under the auspices of the International Press\n   Telecommunications\
    \ Council (IPTC), and version 1.0 was approved by\n   the IPTC on 6 October 2000.\n\
    \   The same logical NewsItem may exist in multiple physical locations.\n   The\
    \ NewsML specification allows NewsItems to have multiple URLs, but\n   only a\
    \ single URN.  It is the latter which then uniquely names the\n   resource.\n\
    \   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \ Street\n      Windsor\n      SL4 1BE\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The\
    \ identifier has the following ABNF[6] specification:\n      NSS = ProviderId\
    \ \":\" DateId \":\" NewsItemId \":\" RevisionId Update\n      ProviderId = string\n\
    \      DateId = date\n      NewsItemId = string\n      RevisionId = posint\n \
    \     Update = 0*1( \"A\" / \"U\" )\n      date = century year month day\n   \
    \   century = ( \"0\" posdig ) / ( posdig DIGIT )\n      year = 1*2DIGIT\n   \
    \   month = ( 0 posdig ) / ( \"1\" ( \"0\" \"1\" \"2\" ) )\n      day = ( 0 posdig\
    \ ) / ( ( \"1\" / \"2\" ) DIGIT ) / \"30\" / \"31\"\n      string = 1*char\n \
    \     char = ALPHA / DIGIT / symbol / escape\n      symbol = \"(\" / \")\" / \"\
    +\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"=\" / \"@\" / \";\" /\n        \"$\" / \"_\" /\
    \ \"!\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n      escape = \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n      posint = posdig\
    \ *DIGIT\n      posdig = \"1\" / \"2\" / \"3\" / \"4\" / \"5\" / \"6\" / \"7\"\
    \ / \"8\" / \"9\"\n      The ProviderId must be an Internet domain name, and must\
    \ be owned\n         by the organisation creating the NewsML resource and allocating\n\
    \         the URN to it, at the date identified by the DateId.\n      DateId is\
    \ a date in ISO 8601 Basic Format (CCYYMMDD), and must\n         correspond to\
    \ a date at which the organisation allocating the\n         URN owned the domain\
    \ name specified in the ProviderId.\n      The NewsItemId must be unique among\
    \ all NewsItems emanating from\n         the same provider and having the same\
    \ DateId.\n      RevisionId is a positive integer indicating which revision of\
    \ a\n         given NewsItem this is.  Any positive integer may be used, but\n\
    \         it must always be the case that of two instances of a NewsItem\n   \
    \      that have the same ProviderId, DateId and NewsItemId, the one\n       \
    \  whose RevisionId has the larger value must be the more recent\n         revision.\
    \  A RevisionId of 0 is not permitted.\n      If the NewsItem contains an \"Update\"\
    \ element or elements, then\n         Update must be set to \"U\".  If the NewsItem\
    \ consists only of a\n         replacement set of NewsManagement data, then Update\
    \ must be set\n         to \"A\".  If neither of these is the case, then Update\
    \ must be\n         suppressed.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The combination of ProviderId\
    \ and DateId serves to uniquely\n         identify the organisation that is allocating\
    \ the URN.  That\n         organisation is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness\
    \ of the\n         DateId/NewsItemId/RevisionId combination.\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      A NewsML URN may only be allocated by an organisation\
    \ that owns an\n         Internet domain name.  The URN identifies a date on which\
    \ the\n         organisation owned that domain name.  The combination of date\n\
    \         and domain name will serve to uniquely identify that\n         organisation\
    \ for all time.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      The organisation\
    \ identified by the ProviderId/DateId combination\n         is responsible for\
    \ allocating a NewsItemId that is unique among\n         all those that it allocates\
    \ with that DateId.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      NewsML providers\
    \ are responsible for the provision of a URN\n         resolution service, if\
    \ any, for NewsML URNs they have assigned\n         with a valid ProviderId/DateId\
    \ combination.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      URNs are lexically equivalent\
    \ if the ProviderId, DateId,\n         NewsItemId, and RevisionId are all identical\
    \ (case-insensitive\n         comparison).\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \      No special considerations beyond the syntax herein described.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      Organisations that allocate NewsML URNs are responsible for\
    \ the\n         provision of a URN validation service, if any, for URNs they\n\
    \         have assigned with a valid ProviderId/DateId combination.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"
