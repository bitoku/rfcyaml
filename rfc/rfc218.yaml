  - "     To help us expand our role as NCC, we will be changing the\nstatus reporting\
    \ facility of the IMP.  The change will take place\nwithin the next month and\
    \ should be transparent to the hosts.\n     The text status reports will be removed.\
    \  They have already\nbeen completely superseded by a binary version sent directly\
    \ to\nthe NCC and are now just excess baggage.\n     The status reports will remain\
    \ with the statistics program\non fake host 3, but will no longer be affected\
    \ by any of the\nPARAMETER CHANGE parameters.  This will prevent the Hosts from\n\
    inadvertently interfering with the operation of the NCC.\nBC/jm\n   [ This RFC\
