  - "Abstract\n   Maintaining high Quality of Experience (QoE) increasingly requires\n\
    \   end-to-end, holistic network management, including managed Customer\n   Premises\
    \ Equipment (CPE).  Because customer management is a shared\n   global responsibility,\
    \ the Domain Name System (DNS) provides an ideal\n   existing infrastructure for\
    \ maintaining authoritative customer\n   information that must be readily, reliably,\
    \ and publicly accessible.\n   This document describes four new DNS resource record\
    \ types for\n   encoding customer information in the DNS.  These records are intended\n\
    \   to better facilitate high customer QoE via inter-provider cooperation\n  \

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A significant portion of today's Internet is comprised of\
    \ residential\n   access networks.  These access networks, and their providers,\
    \ are now\n   critical infrastructure, and significant research is devoted to\n\
    \   measuring residential broadband speed and reliability [SAMKNOWS].\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is one of the\n   weakest links in the chain\
    \ of network equipment connecting consumers\n   to the Internet.  Customers typically\
    \ do not perform proactive\n   maintenance, e.g., firmware updates, on their own\
    \ CPE.  In many\n   cases, CPE is even deployed with default authentication credentials,\n\
    \   a fact that has been exploited by various Internet-wide denial-of-\n   service\
    \ attacks [MIRAI].\n   A central observation motivating this document is that\
    \ customers\n   simply cannot be trusted to manage their own networks, much less\
    \ the\n   path-critical CPE.  Given the difficulty in maintaining the hygiene\n\
    \   and resilience of broadband access, CPE maintenance should instead be\n  \
    \ treated as a shared global responsibility among Internet Service\n   Providers\
    \ (ISPs).\n   Further complicating customer management is choice in ISP, which\
    \ is\n   currently available to nearly half of US households.  While customers\n\
    \   may switch providers, their biographical, billing, and technological\n   details\
    \ remain constant.  Therefore, service providers need\n   mechanisms to ensure\
    \ that transitioning customers into and out of\n   their network is as seamless\
    \ as possible from both a technical and\n   billing standpoint.\n   Finally, service\
    \ providers, advertisers, and law enforcement agencies\n   have varying but important\
    \ reasons to track unique users' behavior on\n   the Internet.  While RFC 7043\
    \ [RFC7043] makes use of EUI48 and EUI64\n   Resource Record (RR) types to uniquely\
    \ identify CPE devices and\n   better support third-party tracking, these mechanisms\
    \ can be defeated\n   by the customer simply purchasing new CPE.\n   This document\
    \ takes a holistic, end-to-end view of customer\n   management with the aim of\
    \ enhancing customer QoE and overall network\n   security.  To enable shared CPE\
    \ maintenance, this document leverages\n   the Domain Name System (DNS), described\
    \ in RFC 1034 [RFC1034] and\n   RFC 1035 [RFC1035], and introduces new RR types\
    \ to aid network\n   management.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses capitalized keywords such as MUST and\
    \ MAY to\n   describe the requirements for using the registered RR types.  The\n\
    \   intended meaning of those keywords in this document are the same as\n   those\
    \ described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and RFC 8174 [RFC8174].\n   Although these keywords\
    \ are often used to specify normative\n   requirements in IETF Standards, their\
    \ use in this document does not\n   imply that this document is a standard of\
    \ any kind.\n"

    \   validate that none of the 16 digits were corrupted in\n           transit.\

    \ a running total; for every second digit\n           (beginning with the second-from-left\
    \ digit), we add twice its\n           value to the running total.  This algorithm\
    \ continues until\n           all 16 digits have been exhausted.  With this partial\
    \ sum in\n           hand, we solve for the value x such that x added to our\n\
    \           partial sum is congruent to 0 modulo 10, and store x in the\n    \
    \       CHECKSUM field.\n           When a CREDITCARD RR is queried, the recipient\
    \ simply\n           computes Luhn's algorithm in the same manner as described\n\
    \           above, and validates that their computed value of x matches\n    \
    \       that stored in the CHECKSUM field.\n           Note that this novel use\
    \ of Luhn's algorithm MAY have\n           applications outside of the CREDITCARD\

  - "3.  Related RR Types\n   The practice of introducing new RR types to the DNS\
    \ to support\n   functionality that is either only tangentially related or wholly\n\
    \   unrelated to name resolution is well established.\n   [RFC2539] describes\
    \ the Diffie-Hellman KEY RR type, which is used to\n   conveniently store public\
    \ key parameters for a domain.  The SRV RR\n   type [RFC2782] combines name resolution\
    \ with transport- and\n   application-layer details, providing a \"no-fuss\" way\
    \ for network\n   administrators to advertise the location of specific services.\
    \  The\n   Name Authority PTR (NAPTR) RR [RFC2915] recognized and corrected the\n\
    \   lack of POSIX Extended Regular Expression support in the DNS,\n   allowing\
    \ for DNS-based automobile parts identification systems\n   [RFC3402] among other\
    \ use cases.  Having established the DNS's role\n   in encryption in [RFC2539],\
    \ the IPSECKEY RR resurrected the since-\n   obsoleted ability to store public\
    \ key parameters for the purposes of\n   IPsec encryption [RFC4025].  [RFC4255]\
    \ codified the natural inter-\n   dependency between the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\
    \ [RFC4253] and DNS\n   by providing the SSHFP RR type, which is used to verify\
    \ the host key\n   of a server.\n   Extending the idea of distributing public\
    \ key parameters via DNS,\n   [RFC4398] introduced the CERT RR type to publish\
    \ X.509 and PGP\n   certificates.  [RFC4701] introduces the DHCID RR type to solve\
    \ the\n   problem of Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) collisions when Dynamic\n\
    \   Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients make DNS updates after\n   obtaining\
    \ a DHCP lease.  The TLSA RR type [RFC6698] is used to\n   associate a TLS certificate\
    \ with a domain, leveraging DNSSEC as the\n   binding, and the CAA RR type [RFC6844]\
    \ specifies the Certificate\n   Authority allowed to issue certificates for a\
    \ domain.  The EUI48 and\n   EUI64 RR types specified in [RFC7043] seek to eliminate\
