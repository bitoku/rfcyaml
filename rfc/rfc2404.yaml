  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo specifies the use of SHA-1 [FIPS-180-1] combined\
    \ with HMAC\n   [RFC-2104] as a keyed authentication mechanism within the context\
    \ of\n   the Encapsulating Security Payload and the Authentication Header.\n \
    \  The goal of HMAC-SHA-1-96 is to ensure that the packet is authentic\n   and\
    \ cannot be modified in transit.\n   HMAC is a secret key authentication algorithm.\
    \ Data integrity and\n   data origin authentication as provided by HMAC are dependent\
    \ upon the\n   scope of the distribution of the secret key. If only the source\
    \ and\n   destination know the HMAC key, this provides both data origin\n   authentication\
    \ and data integrity for packets sent between the two\n   parties; if the HMAC\
    \ is correct, this proves that it must have been\n   added by the source.\n  \
    \ In this memo, HMAC-SHA-1-96 is used within the context of ESP and AH.\n   For\
    \ further information on how the various pieces of ESP - including\n   the confidentiality\
    \ mechanism -- fit together to provide security\n   services, refer to [ESP] and\
    \ [Thayer97a]. For further information on\n   AH, refer to [AH] and [Thayer97a].\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"\
    \ in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].\n"
- title: 2. Algorithm and Mode
  contents:
  - "2. Algorithm and Mode\n   [FIPS-180-1] describes the underlying SHA-1 algorithm,\
    \ while [RFC-\n   2104] describes the HMAC algorithm. The HMAC algorithm provides\
    \ a\n   framework for inserting various hashing algorithms such as SHA-1.\n  \
    \ HMAC-SHA-1-96 operates on 64-byte blocks of data.  Padding\n   requirements\
    \ are specified in [FIPS-180-1] and are part of the SHA-1\n   algorithm.  If you\
    \ build SHA-1 according to [FIPS-180-1] you do not\n   need to add any additional\
    \ padding as far as HMAC-SHA-1-96 is\n   concerned.  With regard to \"implicit\
    \ packet padding\" as defined in\n   [AH] no implicit packet padding is required.\n\
    \   HMAC-SHA-1-96 produces a 160-bit authenticator value.  This 160-bit\n   value\
    \ can be truncated as described in RFC2104.  For use with either\n   ESP or AH,\
    \ a truncated value using the first 96 bits MUST be\n   supported.  Upon sending,\
    \ the truncated value is stored within the\n   authenticator field.  Upon receipt,\
    \ the entire 160-bit value is\n   computed and the first 96 bits are compared\
    \ to the value stored in\n   the authenticator field.  No other authenticator\
    \ value lengths are\n   supported by HMAC-SHA-1-96.\n   The length of 96 bits\
    \ was selected because it is the default\n   authenticator length as specified\
    \ in [AH] and meets the security\n   requirements described in [RFC-2104].\n"
- title: 2.1  Performance
  contents:
  - "2.1  Performance\n   [Bellare96a] states that \"(HMAC) performance is essentially\
    \ that of\n   the underlying hash function\".  As of this writing no detailed\n\
    \   performance analysis has been done of SHA-1, HMAC or HMAC combined\n   with\
    \ SHA-1.\n   [RFC-2104] outlines an implementation modification which can improve\n\
    \   per-packet performance without affecting interoperability.\n"
- title: 3. Keying Material
  contents:
  - "3. Keying Material\n   HMAC-SHA-1-96 is a secret key algorithm. While no fixed\
    \ key length is\n   specified in [RFC-2104], for use with either ESP or AH a fixed\
    \ key\n   length of 160-bits MUST be supported.  Key lengths other than 160-\n\
    \   bits MUST NOT be supported (i.e. only 160-bit keys are to be used by\n   HMAC-SHA-1-96).\
    \  A key length of 160-bits was chosen based on the\n   recommendations in [RFC-2104]\
    \ (i.e. key lengths less than the\n   authenticator length decrease security strength\
    \ and keys longer than\n   the authenticator length do not significantly increase\
    \ security\n   strength).\n   [RFC-2104] discusses requirements for key material,\
    \ which includes a\n   discussion on requirements for strong randomness.  A strong\
    \ pseudo-\n   random function MUST be used to generate the required 160-bit key.\n\
    \   At the time of this writing there are no specified weak keys for use\n   with\
    \ HMAC.  This does not mean to imply that weak keys do not exist.\n   If, at some\
    \ point, a set of weak keys for HMAC are identified, the\n   use of these weak\
    \ keys must be rejected followed by a request for\n   replacement keys or a newly\
    \ negotiated Security Association.\n   [ARCH] describes the general mechanism\
    \ for obtaining keying material\n   when multiple keys are required for a single\
    \ SA (e.g. when an ESP SA\n   requires a key for confidentiality and a key for\
    \ authentication).\n   In order to provide data origin authentication, the key\
    \ distribution\n   mechanism must ensure that unique keys are allocated and that\
    \ they\n   are distributed only to the parties participating in the\n   communication.\n\
    \   [RFC-2104] makes the following recommendation with regard to\n   rekeying.\
    \  Current attacks do not indicate a specific recommended\n   frequency for key\
    \ changes as these attacks are practically\n   infeasible.  However, periodic\
    \ key refreshment is a fundamental\n   security practice that helps against potential\
    \ weaknesses of the\n   function and keys, reduces the information avaliable to\
    \ a\n   cryptanalyst, and limits the damage of an exposed key.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Interaction with the ESP Cipher Mechanism\n   As of this writing, there are\
    \ no known issues which preclude the use\n   of the HMAC-SHA-1-96 algorithm with\
    \ any specific cipher algorithm.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security provided by HMAC-SHA-1-96 is based\
    \ upon the strength of\n   HMAC, and to a lesser degree, the strength of SHA-1.\
    \  At the time of\n   this writing there are no practical cryptographic attacks\
    \ against\n   HMAC-SHA-1-96.\n   [RFC-2104] states that for \"minimally reasonable\
    \ hash functions\" the\n   \"birthday attack\" is impractical.  For a 64-byte\
    \ block hash such as\n   HMAC-SHA-1-96, an attack involving the successful processing\
    \ of 2**80\n   blocks would be infeasible unless it were discovered that the\n\
    \   underlying hash had collisions after processing 2**30 blocks.  A hash\n  \
    \ with such weak collision-resistance characteristics would generally\n   be considered\
    \ to be unusable.\n   It is also important to consider that while SHA-1 was never\
    \ developed\n   to be used as a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC had that criteria from\
    \ the\n   onset.\n   [RFC-2104] also discusses the potential additional security\
    \ which is\n   provided by the truncation of the resulting hash. Specifications\n\
    \   which include HMAC are strongly encouraged to perform this hash\n   truncation.\n\
    \   As [RFC-2104] provides a framework for incorporating various hash\n   algorithms\
    \ with HMAC, it is possible to replace SHA-1 with other\n   algorithms such as\
    \ MD5. [RFC-2104] contains a detailed discussion on\n   the strengths and weaknesses\
    \ of HMAC algorithms.\n   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of\
    \ its strength\n   lies in the correctness of the algorithm implementation, the\
    \ security\n   of the key management mechanism and its implementation, the strength\n\
    \   of the associated secret key, and upon the correctness of the\n   implementation\
    \ in all of the participating systems.  [RFC-2202]\n   contains test vectors and\
    \ example code to assist in verifying the\n   correctness of HMAC-SHA-1-96 code.\n"
