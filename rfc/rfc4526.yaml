  - "Abstract\n   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) to support absolute True and False filters based upon similar\n   capabilities\
    \ found in X.500 directory systems.  The document also\n   extends the String\
    \ Representation of LDAP Search Filters to support\n   these filters.\n"

- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   The X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511] supports\
    \ absolute\n   True and False assertions.  An 'and' filter with zero elements\
    \ always\n   evaluates to True.  An 'or' filter with zero elements always\n  \
    \ evaluates to False.  These filters are commonly used when requesting\n   DSA-specific\
    \ Entries (DSEs) that do not necessarily have\n   'objectClass' attributes; that\
    \ is, where \"(objectClass=*)\" may\n   evaluate to False.\n   Although LDAPv2\
    \ [RFC1777][RFC3494] placed no restriction on the\n   number of elements in 'and'\
    \ and 'or' filter sets, the LDAPv2 string\n   representation [RFC1960][RFC3494]\
    \ could not represent empty 'and' and\n   'or' filter sets.  Due to this, absolute\
    \ True or False filters were\n   (unfortunately) eliminated from LDAPv3 [RFC4510].\n\
    \   This documents extends LDAPv3 to support absolute True and False\n   assertions\
    \ by allowing empty 'and' and 'or' in Search filters\n   [RFC4511] and extends\
    \ the filter string representation [RFC4515] to\n   allow empty filter lists.\n\
    \   It is noted that certain search operations, such as those used to\n   retrieve\
    \ subschema information [RFC4512], require use of particular\n   filters.  This\
    \ document does not change these requirements.\n   This feature is intended to\
    \ allow a more direct mapping between DAP\n   and LDAP (as needed to implement\
    \ DAP-to-LDAP gateways).\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP 14\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Absolute True and False Filters
  contents:
  - "2.  Absolute True and False Filters\n   Implementations of this extension SHALL\
    \ allow 'and' and 'or' choices\n   with zero filter elements.\n   An 'and' filter\
    \ consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate\n   to True.  This filter\
    \ is represented by the string \"(&)\".\n   An 'or' filter consisting of an empty\
    \ set of filters SHALL evaluate\n   to False.  This filter is represented by the\
    \ string \"(|)\".\n   Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object\
    \ Identifier\n   1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.3 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures'\n\
    \   [RFC4512] attribute in the root DSE.\n   Clients supporting this feature SHOULD\
    \ NOT use the feature unless\n   they know that the server supports it.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The (re)introduction of absolute True and False\
    \ filters is not\n   believed to raise any new security considerations.\n   Implementors\
    \ of this (or any) LDAPv3 extension should be familiar\n   with general LDAPv3\
    \ security considerations [RFC4510].\n"
