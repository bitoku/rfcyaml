  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The evolution of large electronic mail systems testifies to\
    \ the\n   increasing importance of electronic mail as a means of communication\n\
    \   and coordination throughout the scientific research community.\n   This paper\
    \ is a summary of the development of, and a status report\n   on, an experiment\
    \ in protocol interoperation between mail systems of\n   different design. USC/Information\
    \ Sciences Institute (ISI) began work\n   on this experiment in 1981 and over\
    \ the years has provided an\n   evolving demonstration service for users to exchange\
    \ mail between the\n   Internet and a few commercial mail systems.\n   Recently\
    \ other organizations have begun to provide similar services,\n   demonstrating\
    \ the ongoing need for interoperation of the Internet and\n   the commercial mail\
    \ systems.  We believe that ISI's pioneering work\n   in this area has promoted\
    \ this expansion of service.\n   These systems include the Internet mail system,\
    \ the US Sprint\n   Telemail system, the MCI Mail system, and the Dialcom systems.\
    \ All of\n   the systems were designed to operate autonomously, with no convenient\n\
    \   mechanism to allow users of one system to send electronic mail to\n   users\
    \ on another system.\n   The Intermail and Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) services\
    \ described in\n   this paper were developed to provide a means for sending mail\
    \ between\n   the Internet and these commercial mail systems.\n   The Internet\
    \ is an interconnected system of networks using the SMTP\n   mail protocol, which\
    \ includes the ARPANET, MILNET, NSFNET, and about\n   700 other networks; mail\
    \ relays allow the exchange of mail with\n   BITNET, CSNET, and the UUCP networks\
    \ as well.  To the users, this\n   Internet looks like one large mail system with\
    \ at least 100,000\n   computers and at least 400,000 users.  Figure 1 illustrates\
    \ the path\n   of a message sent by a user on one Internet host to a user on another\n\
    \   Internet host.  For more details on the Internet and connected\n   networks\
    \ (see Appendix A).\n   As commercial mail systems came into popular use, it became\
    \ clear\n   that a mail link between the Internet and the commercial mail systems\n\
    \   was necessary (see Appendix B).  More and more commercial and\n   research\
    \ entities needed to communicate with the Internet research\n   community, and\
    \ many of these organizations (for one reason or\n   another) were inappropriate\
    \ candidates for Internet sites.  The\n   Intermail and CMR services allow these\
    \ groups to communicate with\n   Internet users by purchasing electronic mail\
    \ services from commercial\n   companies.\n"
- title: INTERMAIL
  contents:
  - "INTERMAIL\n   Intermail is an experimental mail forwarding system that allows\
    \ users\n   to send electronic mail across mail system boundaries. The use of\n\
    \   Intermail is nearly transparent, in that users on each system are\n   able\
    \ to use their usual mail programs to prepare, send, and receive\n   messages.\
    \  No modifications to any of the mail programs on any of the\n   systems are\
    \ required.  However, users must put some extra addressing\n   information at\
    \ the beginning of the body of their messages.\n               <<< Figure 1 -\
    \ Internet to Internet Mail >>>\n   The earliest version of Intermail was developed\
    \ in 1981, by Jon\n   Postel, Danny Cohen, Lee Richardson, and Joel Goldberg [1].\
    \ It ran on\n   the TOPS-20 operating system and was used to forward VLSI chip\n\
    \   specifications for the MOSIS project between the ARPANET and the\n   Telemail\
    \ system.  The original addressing model used in this system\n   was called \"\
    Source Route Forwarding\".  It was developed to handle\n   situations in which\
    \ a message might travel multiple hops before\n   reaching its destination.\n\
    \   Later, in 1983, Annette DeSchon converted Intermail into a more\n   general-purpose\
    \ mail-forwarding system, supporting forwarding between\n   the Internet mail\
    \ system and three commercial mail systems: Telemail,\n   MCI Mail, and Dialcom\
    \ [3,4].\n   As it became apparent that the level of generality of Source Route\n\
    \   Forwarding was not needed, and as Intermail gained acceptance among\n   users,\
    \ an easier approach to addressing was developed.  The new\n   addressing model\
    \ is called \"Simple Forwarding\".  This form of\n   addressing, like Source Route\
    \ Forwarding, appears at the beginning of\n   the text of each message.  It can\
    \ be used to include various Internet\n   mail header fields in addition to the\
    \ standard \"To\" and \"Cc\" address\n   fields.  This format also allows the\
    \ use of special address formats,\n   such as U.S. postal addresses and TELEX\
    \ addresses, which are\n   supported by the MCI Mail system.  The Intermail system\
    \ performed\n   partially automated error handling.  Error messages were created\
    \ by\n   the Intermail program and were then either approved or corrected by a\n\
    \   human postmaster.\n   Figure 2 illustrates the pathways between the user mailboxes\
    \ in the\n   commercial mail systems and the user mailboxes in the Internet via\n\
    \   the Intermail accounts and program modules.  Figure 3 shows the\n   Intermail\
    \ processing in more detail.\n              <<< Figure 2 - Commercial Mail to\
    \ Intermail >>>\n                  <<< Figure 3 - Intermail Processing >>>\n"
- title: COMMERCIAL MAIL RELAY
  contents:
  - "COMMERCIAL MAIL RELAY\n   In 1988, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) was developed\
    \ to run on a\n   dedicated UNIX system, replacing the TOPS-20-based Intermail\
    \ system.\n   The CMR is a store-and-forward mail link between the Internet and\
    \ two\n   commercial systems, Telemail and Dialcom. The only remaining\n   forwarding\
    \ performed by the TOPS-20 Intermail system is in support of\n   the MCI Mail\
    \ system.  (This is planned for conversion to the CMR.)\n   The CMR supports relay-style\
    \ addressing in the \"Internet to\n   commercial system\" direction, as well as\
    \ Simple Forwarding in both\n   directions.  One advantage of relay-style addressing\
    \ is that users\n   from different commercial systems can appear on Internet mailing\n\
    \   lists.  Another advantage is that the reply features of most Internet\n  \
    \ user applications can be used by Internet users to respond to mail\n   that\
    \ originated on a commercial system. Unfortunately, since we do\n   not have access\
    \ to the address-parsing software on the commercial\n   systems, it is not possible\
    \ for users of the commercial systems to\n   enter addresses directly into the\
    \ message header, and they must\n   continue to use Simple Forwarding.\n   The\
    \ CMR supports automated error handling, which enables the system\n   to provide\
    \ faster turnaround on messages containing addressing\n   errors, and requires\
    \ much less intervention from a human postmaster.\n"
- title: DESCRIPTION OF THE CMR SYSTEM
  contents:
  - "DESCRIPTION OF THE CMR SYSTEM\n   The Multi-channel Memo Distribution Facility\
    \ (MMDF) is used as the\n   system mail software because of its notion of separating\
    \ the mail\n   queue into separate channels [5].  This makes it easy to dedicate\
    \ a\n   channel/queue combination to each commercial system.  Internet mail\n\
    \   comes in over the standard SMTP port, and the system parses the\n   destination\
    \ address, queuing the message in the proper outgoing\n   queue.  A tag can be\
    \ added to outgoing traffic so that replies can be\n   made without any special\
    \ processing at the destination site.\n   The CMR uses a relay mailbox on each\
    \ commercial system.  Commercial\n   users send mail to this mailbox with a Simple\
    \ Forwarding Header (SFH)\n   at the head of their message text.  Each channel,\
    \ in addition to\n   sending outgoing mail into the commercial system, reads all\
    \ messages\n   in the relay mailbox and places them in a spool file in the CMR\
    \ host\n   computer.\n   The processing of the spool file is performed by a single\
    \ daemon. It\n   parses each commercial system message header to find the sender\
    \ and\n   subject, then it searches for and processes the SFH.  The SFH\n   contains\
    \ the destination Internet addresses.  Figure 4a illustrates\n   the path of mail\
    \ from the Internet to the commercial sytems. Figure\n   4b illustrates the path\
    \ from the commercial systrems to the Internet.\n   Note:  MCI Mail is not yet\
    \ implemented.\n   The CMR employs a simple accounting mechanism:  a shell script\
    \ counts\n   the number of times a string marker occurs in the MMDF logs.  At\
    \ the\n   end of the month, another script uses an \"awk\" program to total the\n\
    \   number of messages sent and received with each commercial system. The\n  \
    \ Commercial Mail Relay is being developed by Craig E. Ward.  Ann\n   Westine\
    \ served as the Postmaster for both Intermail and the CMR until\n   March 1989.\
    \  Currently, our Action Office serves as Postmaster.\n   Questions may be sent\
    \ to \"Intermail-Request@ISI.EDU\".\n          <<< Figure 4a - The Internet to\

- title: COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS SERVED
  contents:
  - "COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS SERVED\n   The CMR provides mail relay service between the\
    \ Internet and two\n   commercial electronic mail systems:  the US Sprint Telemail\
    \ system\n   and the Dialcom system.  A CMR connection to MCI Mail is under\n\
    \   development.  MCI Mail is currently served by the TOPS-20 Intermail\n   system.\
    \  See Appendix C for recent traffic data.\n   Telemail is an international commercial\
    \ service.  Some of the\n   Telemail systems served by the CMR include MAIL/USA,\
    \ NASAMAIL/USA,\n   and GSFC/USA.  Some government agencies, such as NASA and\
    \ the\n   Environmental Protection Agency, have dedicated Telemail systems.\n\
    \   Companies also exist that purchase bulk services from Telemail and\n   resell\
    \ the service to individuals.  Omnet's Sciencenet is a very\n   popular example\
    \ of this type of service.\n   Dialcom is a commercial service similar to Telemail\
    \ in that it has\n   facilities for allowing groups to purchase tailored services,\
    \ and\n   some government agencies (such as the National Science Foundation and\n\
    \   the U.S.  Department of Agriculture) have special group-access plans.\n  \
    \ The IEEE Computer Society also has a dedicated group service, called\n   IEEE\
    \ Compmail, which is open to members of the IEEE Computer Society.\n   MCI Mail\
    \ is operated by MCI and is marketed to large companies as\n   well as individual\
    \ users.\n   Specific examples of the users of Intermail and the CMR are as\n\
    \   follows:\n   1) Scientists in Oceanography, Astronomy, Geology, and Agriculture\n\
    \   use Intermail and the CMR to communicate with colleagues.  Many of\n   these\
    \ scientists have accounts on \"Sciencenet\", which is actually\n   part of a\
    \ Telemail system administered by Omnet.\n   (2) The IEEE Computer Society's publication\
    \ editors use the Dialcom\n   system \"Compmail\" to manage the papers being prepared\
    \ for their\n   numerous publications.  Many of the authors are in university\n\
    \   departments with access to the Internet. Intermail and the CMR\n   support\
    \ a significant exchange of large messages containing\n   manuscripts.\n   (3)\
    \  NASA uses Telemail systems for its own work and has extensive\n   exchanges\
    \ through its own relay service, as well as Intermail and the\n   CMR, for communicating\
    \ with university scientists on the Internet.\n   Other developments to interoperate\
    \ between the Internet and\n   Commercial mail systems are:\n      (1)  The Merit\
    \ gateway to Sprintmail and IEEE Compmail\n      (2)  The CNRI gateway to MCI\
    \ Mail\n      (3)  The Ohio State University gateway to Compuserve, and,\n   \
    \   (4)  NASA-Ames gateway to Telemail\n"
- title: ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY FOR INTERMAIL AND THE CMR
  contents:
  - "ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY FOR INTERMAIL AND THE CMR\n   The Internet is composed\
    \ of many networks sponsored by many\n   organizations.  However, all the Internet's\
    \ long-haul networks are\n   provided by U.S.  government agencies.  Each of these\
    \ agencies limits\n   the use of the facilities it provides in some way.  In general,\
    \ the\n   statement by an agency about how its facilities may be used is called\n\
    \   an \"Acceptable Use Policy\".\n   The various agencies involved in the Internet\
    \ are currently preparing\n   their Acceptable Use Policy statements.  Most of\
    \ these are in draft\n   form and have not been released as official agency statements\
    \ as yet.\n   None of these policies are currently available as online documents.\n\
    \   In the least restrictive case, all bona fide researchers and\n   scholars,\
    \ public and private, from the United States and foreign\n   countries (unless\
    \ denied access by national policy) are allowed\n   access.\n   The Intermail\
    \ and Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) systems at ISI are\n   resources provided by\
    \ the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n   (DARPA) for computing and\
    \ communication.  Use of these resources must\n   be limited to DARPA-sponsored\
    \ work or other approved government\n   business (or must otherwise meet the acceptable\
    \ use policy of DARPA),\n   only.\n   However, DARPA, as a member of the Federal\
    \ Research Internet\n   Coordinating Committee (FRICC), has agreed to the FRICC\
    \ draft policy\n   for communication networks, which provides in part that:  \"\
    The member\n   agencies of the FRICC agree to carry all traffic that meets the\n\
    \   Acceptable Use Policy of the originating member agency\".\n   Thus, e-mail\
    \ messages (i.e., \"traffic\") that meet the Acceptable Use\n   Policy of an agency\
    \ and pass through some facility of that agency\n   (i.e., \"the originating member\"\
    ) on the way to Intermail or CMR are\n   allowed.\n   The current member agencies\
    \ of the FRICC are DARPA, NSF, DOE, NASA,\n   and NIH.\n   BITNET and UUCP (and\
    \ other) networks are interconnected to the\n   Internet via mail relays.  It\
    \ is the responsibility of the managers\n   of these mail relays to ensure that\
    \ the e-mail messages (\"traffic\")\n   that enter the Internet via their mail\
    \ relays meet the Acceptable Use\n   Policy of the member agency providing the\
    \ Internet access.\n   In addition, we cannot allow CMR or Intermail to be used\
    \ simply as a\n   bridge between two commercial systems, even though CMR has this\n\
    \   technical capability.  At least one end of the communication must be\n   related\
    \ to FRICC acceptable use.\n"
- title: DETAILS OF CMR SYSTEM USE
  contents:
  - "DETAILS OF CMR SYSTEM USE\n   The CMR host computer is Internet host INTERMAIL.ISI.EDU\n\
    \   (128.9.2.203).  The users of the commercials system are required to\n   know\
    \ the proper gateways between the Internet and other networks such\n   as BITNET,\
    \ CSNET, or UUCP.  Users on networks interconnected to the\n   Internet likewise\
    \ need to know how to reach the Internet to send mail\n   through INTERMAIL.ISI.EDU\
    \ to a commercial system.\n   The relay connection to Telemail is through their\
    \ host TELEMAIL/USA.\n   The general syntax for Telemail addresses is\n   \"[USER/ORGANIZATION]HOST/COUNTRY\"\
    , making the full address for the\n   relay mailbox:\n                      [INTERMAIL/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA\n\
    \   Users across the entire Telemail service can send mail to this\n   address.\
    \  Users on the TELEMAIL host need only send to INTERMAIL.\n   Internet users\
    \ can use the basic Telemail format, append a\n   \"%TELEMAIL\" to it, and mail\
    \ to the resulting address as if it really\n   existed on INTERMAIL.ISI.EDU, e.g.:\n\
    \           [CWARD/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA%TELEMAIL@INTERMAIL.ISI.EDU\n   Note that\
    \ the CMR system will accept anything before the \"%TELEMAIL\",\n   that is, the\
    \ CMR does not validate Telemail addresses before\n   transmitting them to Telemail.\n\
    \   The CMR handles Dialcom mail delivery in a similar way, but this\n   system\
    \ has what might be called \"virtual hosts\".  Groups can be set\n   up with an\
    \ alias system to allow easier intra-group access.  For\n   example, both NSF\
    \ and USDA share the same Dialcom host (157); but,\n   while both groups send\
    \ relay messages to Intermail, their actual\n   fully qualified Dialcom mailboxes\
    \ are different. For example, NSF's\n   mailbox is NSF153, and USDA's mailbox\
    \ is AGS9999.\n   Mail going in either direction may use an embedded Simple Forwarding\n\
    \   Header.  An SFH must be the first part of the message text.  It\n   starts\
    \ with a \"Forward:\"  field followed by a \"To:\" field.  \"Cc:\",\n   \"Subject:\"\
    , and other fields may follow the \"To:\" fields. The SFH is\n   terminated by\
    \ a blank line.\n   This is a template of an SFH:\n      Forward: Destination-Network\n\
    \      To: User@host1, User@host2,\n           User2@host2\n      Cc: User@host1\n\
    \      Subject: This subject supercedes the subject in the host net header\n \
    \     <Blank-Line>\n   Dialcom syntax is \"Host-ID:User-ID\", for example, 134:ABC1234.\
    \  This\n   format will work from any Dialcom host; but users in the same group\n\
    \   as ABC would be able to use the user name, for example, JSMITH.\n   Using\
    \ the SFH format, mail to a Dialcom system could be sent as\n   follows:\n   \
    \   To: Intermail@ISI.EDU\n      Subject:  Test Message\n      Forward: Compmail\n\
    \      To: 134:ABC1234\n      Here is the text of the message.\n   Proper destination\
    \ network names include ARPA, Telemail, Compmail,\n   NSF-Mail, and USDA-Mail.\n\
    \   It is possible for a user to make mistakes at many points in the\n   process.\
    \ Errors are handled as automatically as possible by the CMR.\n   Many errors\
    \ are caught in the standard Internet mail traffic, and\n   users receive the\
    \ usual error messages from the system.  Messages\n   with incorrect commercial\
    \ system addresses or faulty SFHs are also\n   automatically returned to sender.\
    \  Messages that the software cannot\n   handle are sent to the CMR's user-service\
    \ mailbox, Intermail-\n   Request@ISI.EDU.  This mailbox has been set up to take\
    \ care of user\n   problems and to be a central distribution point for user\n\
    \   instructions.\n"
- title: PROBLEMS
  contents:
  - "PROBLEMS\n   Several problems arise from the store-and-forward nature of the\
    \ CMR.\n   One of the biggest is that almost all of the commercial systems lack\n\
    \   a machine-to-machine interface -- the CMR software must mimic a human\n  \
    \ user of the commercial system.  Another problem is that the Internet\n   and\
    \ a commercial system have different forms (or syntax) for\n   electronic mail\
    \ addresses.  A major goal of the CMR project is to\n   make the link between\
    \ networks as transparent as possible, allowing\n   Internet users to use off-the-shelf\
    \ mail programs.  Making commercial\n   address formats fit the Internet standard\
    \ is a major task [2].\n   Compatibility with Internet addressing standards is\
    \ also a concern.\n   The commercial accounts are not able to take advantage of\
    \ the\n   transparency features of the Domain Name System (DNS) (see Appendix\n\
    \   D); and some commercial addresses are incompatible with the Internet\n   syntax--this\
    \ requires Internet users to continue using the older\n   methods.\n   Another\
    \ general problem to be solved is to reduce the amount of time\n   needed to maintain\
    \ the system.  Because most commercial systems force\n   our software to mimic\
    \ a human user, automatic error detection and\n   handling are quite complex.\
    \ The Intermail system requires human\n   intervention in processing failed mail.\
    \  A goal of the CMR is to\n   fully automate these processes.\n   A related problem\
    \ facing the CMR, as well as its predecessor\n   Intermail, is the frequency with\
    \ which commercial systems change\n   their software.  The changes are usually\
    \ minor and do not bother most\n   human users; however, the CMR depends on being\
    \ able to recognize\n   certain strings.  To avoid the necessity of rebuilding\
    \ the whole CMR\n   when these strings change, most of the string markers are\
    \ stored in\n   ASCII files that are read at run time.\n   The translation of\
    \ commercial system addresses has created a new set\n   of problems,  most of\
    \ which are caused by the use of \"special\"\n   characters by the commercial\
    \ systems.\n   Telemail uses square brackets (\"[\" and \"]\") around user names.\
    \ While\n   these characters are not special by Internet standards when found\
    \ in\n   the local part of an address, many (perhaps most) Internet mailers\n\
    \   refuse to accept these characters unless they are quoted.  MMDF was\n   modified\
    \ locally to correct this.\n   The square bracket problem is even worse for users\
    \ of IBM mainframe\n   machines, many of which are used on BITNET.  The square\
    \ bracket is\n   not a printable character on many BITNET IBM hosts, and all kinds\
    \ of\n   strange addresses can result from its use.\n   The colon is another example.\
    \  Dialcom uses it as the delimiter\n   between host and mailbox.  However, the\
    \ colon is a special character\n   in the Internet mail standard [2].  Users can\
    \ avoid this problem by\n   using the SFH and placing the Dialcom address at the\
    \ beginning of the\n   message text.  Although the CMR can accept addresses with\
    \ colons,\n   many Internet hosts and relays are unable to accept addresses that\n\
    \   contain colons.  Mail with colons in the address fields is often\n   rejected\
    \ by Internet hosts and is returned to the Intermail-Request\n   mailbox for error\
    \ processing.  This can cause significant delays.\n   Problems have also been\
    \ caused by confusion about which hosts are\n   mail relays between the Internet\
    \ and other systems compatible with\n   the Internet mail standard [2]. (e.g.,\
    \ BITNET, UUCP, and CSNET).\n   When the CMR was implemented, a decision was made\
    \ that the CMR would\n   not keep track of these mail relays.  When a relay is\
    \ changed, as the\n   BITNET mail relays were in 1988, mail may be rejected because\
    \ the\n   host either no longer exists or refuses the mail.\n   The mail relay\
    \ problem is a subset of the larger problem of\n   communicating information about\
    \ new features and changes to the user\n   community. Virtually none of the users\
    \ of the CMR are local.  Many\n   are hidden behind the veil of the commercial\
    \ system.  (Dealing with\n   commercial system customer support people has proven\
    \ to be\n   frustrating -- few of them seem to understand the concept of\n   machine-to-machine\
    \ exchanges.) Enhancements to commercial software\n   that necessitate minor changes\
    \ can disrupt some CMR users for days.\n   Another problem that has not been adequately\
    \ solved is validation of\n   commercial system addresses and processing of failed\
    \ commercial\n   system mail.  The Telemail system will not validate a user/host\n\
    \   combination until after the full text of the message has been\n   transmitted.\
    \  If a long message is sent to an invalid address, it can\n   be very expensive\
    \ in terms of wasted time and connect charges.\n   Telemail also gives inadequate\
    \ information when the host is correct\n   but the user name is not.  The failed\
    \ mail notice received from\n   Telemail is of little use to either a human reader\
    \ or the CMR\n   software.  The only information that Telemail returns is the\
    \ message\n   ID number -- it provides no subject, and no text to distinguish\
    \ the\n   message from the numerous others that pass through the mailbox.\n  \
    \ Dialcom does a better job of validating addresses.  If an address is\n   not\
    \ recognized, the system immediately prompts for a correction.  A\n   simple <RETURN>\
    \ will delete the invalid address from the list.\n   The commercial systems are\
    \ geared for paying customers to send and\n   receive mail to other paying customers.\
    \  They are not equipped to\n   handle reverse billing, or \"collect calls.\"\
    \  ISI is currently charged\n   for connect time needed to transmit and receive\
    \ mail to and from\n   other Internet sites.  A possible solution to this problem\
    \ would be\n   to extend the CMR. to include accounting and billing procedures\
    \ that\n   would pass the costs of CMR to its users.\n   What had been GTE Telemail\
    \ became Sprint SprintMail, Telenet became\n   Sprintnet, and the host TELEMAIL/USA\
    \ became SM66/USA.\n   In April 1990, Sprint installed its X.400 implementation.\
    \  For the\n   time being, the old-style Interconnect syntax will work. The CMR\n\
    \   telemail channel and the Simple Forwarding Header (SFH) processor,\n   were\
    \ modified to accept either format in the SprintMail \"From\" field.\n   Sprint\
    \ uses the following syntax for X.400:\n                      (O:USCISI,UN:INTERMAIL,TS:SM66)\n\
    \   The SFH processor will \"translate\" this into:\n                 /O=USCISI/UN=INTERMAIL/TS=SM66/%TELEMAIL\n\
    \   The channel program will reverse the process.  In the translation,\n   parentheses\
    \ become slashes, colons become equal signs and commas\n   become slashes and\
    \ vice versa.\n   Unfortunately, the translation algorithm is not foolproof. \
    \ A\n   Sprint/Internet relay did not use the same field names and values as\n\
    \   those in SprintMail.  Consequently, a CMR translated address can not\n   be\
    \ sent unmodified to Sprint's relay, Sprint.COM, and Sprint.COM\n   processed\
    \ addresses cannot be sent unmodified to the CMR.\n   From experimentation, the\
    \ modifications necessary to a CMR processed\n   address to make it acceptable\
    \ to Sprint.COM are (1) take the \"non-\n   standard\" X.400 fields of \"UN\"\
    \ and \"TS\" and prepend \"DD.\" to them,\n   (2) add the country field and code\
    \ (C:US) and (3) add the Telemail\n   administrative domain name (ADMD:Telemail).\
    \  The above example would\n   become:\n    /O=USCISI/DD.UN=INTERMAIL/DD.TS=SM66/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/@Sprint.COM\n\
    \   The country code must be changed from \"US\" to \"USA.\"  The CMR queue\n\
    \   name must also be appended: \"%TELEMAIL.\"\n   The situation is further complicated\
    \ by Sprint's decision to only\n   relay mail to and from its own administrative\
    \ domain.  Other X.400\n   ADMDs may be added in the future if payment problems\
    \ can be overcome.\n   SprintMail encoded Internet addresses are not parsed correctly\
    \ by the\n   SFH processor, but that should not be a major problem -- who on the\n\
    \   Internet is going to send to the commercial side of the relay?\n   When the\
    \ NSF decided to terminate NSFMAIL, it became clear that the\n   CMR Project needed\
    \ a way to get news out to the commercial users.\n   The CMR channel programs\
    \ now are able to append a news file to the\n   end of messages going into the\
    \ commercial networks.  After\n   transmitting a message, each channel checks\
    \ for a news file with the\n   channel name and if present, sends it.\n   The\
    \ biggest costs of the CMR are the connect times to the Sprintnet\n   X.25 network\
    \ and the commercial machines.  Making the CMR transmit\n   faster is the current\
    \ number one problem.\n   Three strategies are being pursued:\n      - Improve\
    \ the implementation of the current method\n      - Change the method to take\
    \ advantage of changes in the commercial\n        software\n      - Upgrade the\
    \ modems and increase the number of phone lines\n   For a list of known problems\
    \ or bugs in the CMR software, see the\n   Appendix of the program logic manual\
    \ [6].\n"
- title: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
  contents:
  - "FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n   No software project is ever completed, and the CMR is no\
    \ exception.\n   There are many possible extensions, some more difficult than\
    \ others.\n   One addition that will be made to the CMR is a channel for\n   interacting\
    \ with MCI Mail.  MCI Mail is one of the original TOPS-20\n   commercial systems\
    \ that were serviced by Intermail; the CMR will need\n   to replace this function\
    \ before all of the TOPS-20 machines are\n   removed from service on the Internet.\n\
    \   The adaptability of the CMR is such that adding new commercial\n   systems\
    \ should not be a major problem.  Additional commercial systems\n   under consideration\
    \ include General Electric's GENIE, Western Union's\n   EasyLink, and Compuserve.\n\
    \   One possible addition to the CMR system could be maintenance of a\n   list\
    \ of gateways.  This would allow commercial system users to\n   incorporate the\
    \ native address formats of other networks into the\n   SFHs.  An advantage of\
    \ this would be that users could simply tell the\n   CMR to forward a message\
    \ to BITNET, for example, and the CMR would\n   find the gateway and properly\
    \ format the address for that gateway.\n   To increase the ease of use to Internet\
    \ users, the system might treat\n   each commercial system as an Internet host\
    \ and create DNS database\n   records for them.  This would allow users to send\
    \ mail to a non-\n   Internet user at an Internet-style domain name.\n   Another\
    \ improvement would be the possibility of accepting X.400-style\n   addressing.\
    \ The current system rejects them.\n   In order to further reduce the hazards\
    \ of string changes in the\n   commercial system software, an AI component could\
    \ be added to the\n   commercial system interfaces.  Such an AI component might\
    \ be able to\n   \"figure out\" what marker a new prompt represents and to remember\
    \ it.\n"

  - "APPENDIX A\n   The Internet and Connected Networks\n   The Internet is a network\
    \ of networks interconnected by gateways or\n   routers. The common element is\
    \ the TCP/IP protocol suite.  The\n   Internet now includes approximately 800\
    \ networks and 100,000 host\n   computers.  The Internet is made up of local area\
    \ networks in\n   research institutes and university campuses, regional networks,\
    \ and\n   long-haul networks.  These resources are supported by the using\n  \
    \ organizations and by several US goverment agencies (including DARPA,\n   NSF,\
    \ NASA, DOE, and NIH).   The long-haul networks in the Internet\n   are the ARPANET,\
    \ the MILNET, the NSFNET Backbone, the NASA Science\n   Internet (NSI), and the\
    \ DOE Energy Science Network (ESNET).\n   Other systems using TCP/IP or other\
    \ protocols may be networks of\n   networks or \"internets\" with a lower case\
    \ \"i\".  The capital \"I\"\n   Internet is the one described above.\n   There\
    \ are other networks with (semi-) compatible electronic mail\n   systems. These\
    \ include BITNET (and EARN and NETNORTH), UUCP (and\n   EUNET), CSNET, ACSNET,\
    \ and JANET.  Users of electronic mail may not\n   necessarily be aware of the\
    \ boundaries between these systems and the\n   Internet.\n   The Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) is a mechanism used in the Internet for\n   translating names of host\
    \ computers into addresses.  The DNS also\n   allows host computers not directly\
    \ on the Internet to have registered\n   names in the same style.\n   BITNET (Because\
    \ It's Time NETwork)\n   BITNET has about 2,500 host computers, primarily at universities,\
    \ in\n   many countries.  It is managed by EDUCOM, which provides\n   administrative\
    \ support and information services.  There are three\n   main constituents of\
    \ the network: BITNET in the United States and\n   Mexico, NETNORTH in Canada,\
    \ and EARN in Europe.  There are also\n   AsiaNet, in Japan, and connections in\
    \ South America.  Gateways exist\n   between BITNET and the Internet.  The most\
    \ common gateway used is\n   CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.\n   CSNET (The Computer + Science\
    \ Network)\n   CSNET has 180 member organizations, primarily computer science\n\
    \   research laboratories at universities and research institutes,\n   including\
    \ international affiliates in more than a dozen countries.\n   CSNET has adopted\
    \ DNS-style names for all its host computers.  It is\n   administered by the University\
    \ Corporation for Atmospheric Research\n   (UCAR) and provides administrative\
    \ support and information services\n   via the CSNET Information Center (CIC)\
    \ at Bolt Beranek and Newman\n   (BBN). The gateway between CSNET and the Internet\
    \ is RELAY.CS.NET.\n   Note: CSNET and BITNET have officially merged into a single\n\
    \   organization as of October 1, 1989.\n   UUCP (UNIX to UNIX Copy)\n   UUCP\
    \ is a protocol, a set of files, and a set of commands for copying\n   data files\
    \ from one UNIX machine to another.  These procedures are\n   widely used to implement\
    \ a hop-by-hop electronic mail system.  This\n   simple mechanism allows any UNIX\
    \ host computer to join the system by\n   arranging a connection (dial-up or permanent)\
    \ with any UNIX host\n   already in the system.  In the basic UUCP system, mail\
    \ is source\n   routed by the sending user through a path of connected hosts to\
    \ the\n   destination.  Currently, there are databases of connection\n   information\
    \ (UUCP maps) and programs (pathalias) that aid in\n   determining routes.  There\
    \ is some use of DNS-style names by UUCP\n   hosts.  EUNET is a UUCP-based network\
    \ in Europe, and JUNET is a\n   similar net in Japan.  These international branches\
    \ of UUCP use DNS-\n   style names as well.  There are many hosts that may relay\
    \ mail\n   between UUCP and the Internet.  One prominent gateway is\n   UUNET.UU.NET.\n\
    \   JANET (Joint Academic NETwork)\n   JANET is the primary academic network in\
    \ the United Kingdom, linking\n   about 1,000 computers at about 100 universities\
    \ and research\n   institutes.  JANET has a domain name system similar to that\
    \ of the\n   Internet, but the order of the domain name parts is opposite (with\n\
    \   the top-level domain on the left).  The protocols used in JANET are\n   the\
    \ UK \"Coloured Books\".  The primary gateway between JANET and the\n   Internet\
    \ is NSFNET-RELAY.AC.UK.\n   ACSNET (Australian Computer Science Network)\n  \
    \ ACSNET is the principal electronic mail system for the computer\n   science\
    \ and academic research community in Australia, connecting\n   about 300 sites.\
    \  It works similarly to UUCP.  ACSNET has a domain\n   naming syntax similar\
    \ to that for Internet domains.  The gateways\n   between ACSNET and the Internet\
    \ are MUNNARI.OZ.AU and UUNET.UU.NET.\n"

  - "APPENDIX D\n   The Domain Name System\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides\
    \ for the translation between\n   host names and addresses.   Within the Internet,\
    \ this means\n   translating from a name, such as \"ABC.ISI.EDU\", to an IP address\
    \ such\n   as \"128.9.0.123\".  The DNS is a set of protocols and databases. \
    \ The\n   protocols define the syntax and semantics for a query language to ask\n\
    \   questions about information located by DNS-style names. The databases\n  \
    \ are distributed and replicated.  There is no dependence on a single\n   central\
    \ server, and each part of the database is provided in at least\n   two servers.\n\
    \   In addition to translating names to addresses for hosts that are in\n   the\
