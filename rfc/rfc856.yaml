    binary data by\n      the receiver of the data.\n   IAC WON'T TRANSMIT-BINARY\n
    \     If the connection is already being operated in binary transmission\n      mode,
    the sender of this command DEMANDS to begin transmitting\n      data characters
    which are to be interpreted as standard NVT ASCII\n      characters by the receiver
    of the data.  If the connection is not\n      already being operated in binary
    transmission mode, the sender of\n      this command REFUSES to begin transmitting
    characters which are to\n      be interpreted as binary characters by the receiver
    of the data\n      (i.e., the sender of the data demands to continue transmitting\n
    \     characters in its present mode).\n      A connection is being operated in

  title: 3.  Default
- contents:
  - "4.  Motivation for the Option\n   It is sometimes useful to have available a
    binary transmission path\n   within TELNET without having to utilize one of the
    more efficient,\n   higher level protocols providing binary transmission (such
    as the\n   File Transfer Protocol).  The use of the IAC prefix within the basic\n
    \  TELNET protocol provides the option of binary transmission in a\n   natural
    way, requiring only the addition of a mechanism by which the\n   parties involved
    can agree to INTERPRET the characters transmitted\n   over a TELNET connection
    as binary data.\n"
  title: 4.  Motivation for the Option
- contents:
  - "5.  Description of the Option\n   With the binary transmission option in effect,
    the receiver should\n   interpret characters received from the transmitter which
    are not\n   preceded with IAC as 8 bit binary data, with the exception of IAC\n
    \  followed by IAC which stands for the 8 bit binary data with the\n   decimal
    value 255.  IAC followed by an effective TELNET command (plus\n   any additional
    characters required to complete the command) is still\n   the command even with
    the binary transmission option in effect.  IAC\n   followed by a character which
    is not a defined TELNET command has the\n   same meaning as IAC followed by NOP,
    although an IAC followed by an\n   undefined command should not normally be sent
    in this mode.\n"

  - "6.  Implementation Suggestions\n   It is foreseen that implementations of the
    binary transmission option\n   will choose to refuse some other options (such
    as the EBCDIC\n   transmission option) while the binary transmission option is
    in\n   effect.  However, if a pair of hosts can understand being in binary\n   transmission
    mode simultaneous with being in, for example, echo mode,\n   then it is all right
    if they negotiate that combination.\n   It should be mentioned that the meanings
    of WON'T and DON'T are\n   dependent upon whether the connection is presently
    being operated in\n   binary mode or not.  Consider a connection operating in,
    say, EBCDIC\n   mode which involves a system which has chosen not to implement
    any\n   knowledge of the binary command.  If this system were to receive a DO\n
    \  TRANSMIT-BINARY, it would not recognize the TRANSMIT-BINARY option\n   and
    therefore would return a WON'T TRANSMIT-BINARY.  If the default\n   for the WON'T
    TRANSMIT-BINARY were always NVT ASCII, the sender of\n   the DO TRANSMIT-BINARY
    would expect the recipient to have switched to\n   NVT ASCII, whereas the receiver
    of the DO TRANSMIT-BINARY would not\n   make this interpretation.\n   Thus, we
    have the rule that when a connection is not presently\n   operating in binary
    mode, the default (i.e., the interpretation of\n   WON'T and DON'T) is to continue
    operating in the current mode,\n   whether that is NVT ASCII, EBCDIC, or some
    other mode.  This rule,\n   however, is not applied once a connection is operating
    in a binary\n   mode (as agreed to by both ends); this would require each end
    of the\n   connection to maintain a stack, containing all of the encoding-method\n
    \  transitions which had previously occurred on the connection, in order\n   to
    properly interpret a WON'T or DON'T.  Thus, a WON'T or DON'T\n   received after
    the connection is operating in binary mode causes the\n   encoding method to revert
    to NVT ASCII.\n   It should be remembered that a TELNET connection is a two way\n
    \  communication channel.  The binary transmission mode must be\n   negotiated
    separately for each direction of data flow, if that is\n   desired.\n   Implementation
    of the binary transmission option, as is the case with\n   implementations of
    all other TELNET options, must follow the loop\n   preventing rules given in the
    General Considerations section of the\n   TELNET Protocol Specification.\n   Consider
    now some issues of binary transmission both to and from\n   both a process and
    a terminal:\n      a. Binary transmission from a terminal.\n         The implementer
    of the binary transmission option should\n         consider how (or whether) a
    terminal transmitting over a TELNET\n         connection with binary transmission
    in effect is allowed to\n         generate all eight bit characters, ignoring
    parity\n         considerations, etc., on input from the terminal.\n      b. Binary
    transmission to a process.\n         The implementer of the binary transmission
    option should\n         consider how (or whether) all characters are passed to
    a\n         process receiving over a connection with binary transmission in\n
    \        effect.  As an example of the possible problem, TOPS-20\n         intercepts
    certain characters (e.g., ETX, the terminal\n         control-C) at monitor level
    and does not pass them to the\n         process.\n      c. Binary transmission
    from a process.\n         The implementer of the binary transmission option should\n
    \        consider how (or whether) a process transmitting over a\n         connection
    with binary transmission in effect is allowed to\n         send all eight bit
    characters with no characters intercepted by\n         the monitor and changed
    to other characters.  An example of\n         such a conversion may be found in
    the TOPS-20 system where\n         certain non-printing characters are normally
    converted to a\n         Circumflex (up-arrow) followed by a printing character.\n
    \     d. Binary transmission to a terminal.\n         The implementer of the binary
    transmission option should\n         consider how (or whether) all characters
    received over a\n         connection with binary transmission in effect are sent
    to a\n         local terminal.  At issue may be the addition of timing\n         characters
    normally inserted locally, parity calculations, and\n         any normal code
    conversion.\n"
