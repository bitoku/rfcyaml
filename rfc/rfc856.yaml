    REQUESTS permission to begin\n      transmitting, or confirms that it will now
    begin transmitting\n      characters which are to be interpreted as 8 bits of
    binary data by\n      the receiver of the data.\n   IAC WON'T TRANSMIT-BINARY\n
    \     If the connection is already being operated in binary transmission\n      mode,
    the sender of this command DEMANDS to begin transmitting\n      data characters
    which are to be interpreted as standard NVT ASCII\n      characters by the receiver
    of the data.  If the connection is not\n      already being operated in binary
    transmission mode, the sender of\n      this command REFUSES to begin transmitting
    characters which are to\n      be interpreted as binary characters by the receiver
    of the data\n      (i.e., the sender of the data demands to continue transmitting\n
    \     characters in its present mode).\n      A connection is being operated in
    binary transmission mode only\n      when one party has requested it and the other
    has acknowledged it.\n   IAC DO TRANSMIT-BINARY\n      The sender of this command
    REQUESTS that the sender of the data\n      start transmitting, or confirms that
    the sender of data is\n      expected to transmit, characters which are to be
    interpreted as 8\n      bits of binary data (i.e., by the party sending this command).\n

  title: 3.  Default
- contents:
  - "4.  Motivation for the Option\n   It is sometimes useful to have available a
    binary transmission path\n   within TELNET without having to utilize one of the
    more efficient,\n   higher level protocols providing binary transmission (such
    as the\n   File Transfer Protocol).  The use of the IAC prefix within the basic\n
    \  TELNET protocol provides the option of binary transmission in a\n   natural
    way, requiring only the addition of a mechanism by which the\n   parties involved
    can agree to INTERPRET the characters transmitted\n   over a TELNET connection
    as binary data.\n"
  title: 4.  Motivation for the Option
- contents:
  - "5.  Description of the Option\n   With the binary transmission option in effect,
    the receiver should\n   interpret characters received from the transmitter which
    are not\n   preceded with IAC as 8 bit binary data, with the exception of IAC\n
    \  followed by IAC which stands for the 8 bit binary data with the\n   decimal
    value 255.  IAC followed by an effective TELNET command (plus\n   any additional
    characters required to complete the command) is still\n   the command even with
    the binary transmission option in effect.  IAC\n   followed by a character which
    is not a defined TELNET command has the\n   same meaning as IAC followed by NOP,
    although an IAC followed by an\n   undefined command should not normally be sent
    in this mode.\n"

  - "6.  Implementation Suggestions\n   It is foreseen that implementations of the
    binary transmission option\n   will choose to refuse some other options (such
    as the EBCDIC\n   transmission option) while the binary transmission option is
    in\n"
