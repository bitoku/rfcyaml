  - "                      Resource Notebook Framework\nIntroduction\nThe purpose\
    \ of this RFC is to present a framework for coordinating all\nthe surveys and\
    \ data gathering efforts concerned with \"resource\nnotebook\" type of information.\n\
    We have obtained agreement from ARPA with the framework, which is\ndescribed below.\n\
    \    The scheme is designed with two purposes:\n        a) to avoid a proliferation\
    \ of data gathering efforts, which\n        would overwhelm the sites and persons\
    \ supplying the much-needed\n        information;\n        b) to give the responsibility\
    \ to the NIC for coordinating the\n        tasks associated with the resource\
    \ notebook.\nTwo companion documents, NIC 14514 and NIC 14515 provide supplementary\n\
    information to this RFC.\n    NIC 14514 describes the history of the Resource\
    \ Notebook from 1971\n    to the present.\n    NIC 14515 contains the questionnaire\
    \ that the NIC is currently\n    sending to server sites for data on Network Resources.\n\
    A recent RFC by John Iseli and Dave Crocker (NWG/RFC #462, NIC 14434)\nalso addresses\
    \ the same problem area.\n    The proposed framework for data collection suggested\
    \ by John and\n    Dave is different from the framework outlined in this RFC.\n\
    Framework\nThe Network Information Center will coordinate the task of collecting,\n\
    verifying, and disseminating information of a \"resource notebook\"\nnature.\n\
    \    a) Collecting and verifying the data.\n        Because of the magnitude of\
    \ this task, regional data collectors\n        would provide assistance both to\
    \ the NIC and to the sites\n        supplying the information.\n            We\
    \ think that initially there should be five regions:\n            Boston, Washington\
    \ DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Mid-\n            Continent.\n        The\
    \ regional agent would collect the information from the sites\n        in their\
    \ region and forward it to NIC for inclusion in the\n        Resource Notebook\
    \ data base.\n        The NIC would work closely with the regional agents to ensure\n\
    \        that the data is accurate and up-to-date.\n    b) Disseminating data.\n\
    \        There is presently a need to prepare different subsets or\n        \"\
    views\" of the resource notebook information.\n        Regardless of which groups\
    \ on the Network are given\n        responsibility for preparing different views\
    \ of the complete\n        resource notebook data base, these views should be\
    \ available for\n        use on-line as the NIC as well as off-line.\nA working\
    \ group of persons interested in the needs and problems of a\nresource notebook\
    \ would meet periodically to review the situation, and\nto make concrete proposals\
    \ for improvements.\nDiscussion\nWe welcome discussion on this RFC.\nI you think\
    \ it is desirable, a meeting could be held at SRI-ARC to\ndiscuss the whole problem\
    \ area.\n    If a meeting is desirable, we suggest it be held soon, say on Monday\n\
    \    March 19, 1973, at 8:30 AM in the SRI-ARC Conference Room.\nPlease let us\
    \ have your comments by March 9.\n    You may contact us at (415) 326-6200, ext\
    \ 3617, care of Mlke\n    Kudlick.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with\
