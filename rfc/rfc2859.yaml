    \ rates: Committed Target Rate\n   (CTR) and Peak Target Rate (PTR).\n"

  - "1.0 Introduction\n   The Time Sliding Window Three Colour Marker (TSWTCM) is\
    \ designed to\n   mark packets of an IP traffic stream with colour of red, yellow\
    \ or\n   green. The marking is performed based on the measured throughput of\n\
    \   the traffic stream as compared against the Committed Target Rate\n   (CTR)\
    \ and the Peak Target Rate (PTR). The TSWTCM is designed to mark\n   packets contributing\
    \ to sending rate below or equal to the CTR with\n   green colour.  Packets contributing\
    \ to the portion of the rate\n   between the CTR and PTR are marked yellow. Packets\
    \ causing the rate\n   to exceed PTR are marked with red colour.\n   The TSWTCM\
    \ has been primarily designed for traffic streams that will\n   be forwarded based\
    \ on the AF PHB in core routers.\n   The TSWTCM operates based on simple control\
    \ theory principles of\n   proportionally regulated feedback control.\n"
- title: 2.0 Overview of TSWTCM
  contents:
  - "2.0 Overview of TSWTCM\n   The TSWTCM consists of two independent components:\
    \ a rate estimator,\n   and a marker to associate a colour (drop precedence) with\
    \ each\n   packet.  The marker uses the algorithm specified in section 4. If the\n\
    \   marker is used with the AF PHB, each colour would correspond to a\n   level\
    \ of drop precedence.\n   The rate estimator provides an estimate of the running\
    \ average\n   bandwidth.  It takes into account burstiness and smoothes out its\n\
    \   estimate to approximate the longer-term measured sending rate of the\n   traffic\
    \ stream.\n   The marker uses the estimated rate to probabilistically associate\n\
    \   packets with one of the three colours. Using a probabilistic function\n  \
    \ in the marker is beneficial to TCP flows as it reduces the likelihood\n   of\
    \ dropping multiple packets within a TCP window.  The marker also\n   works correctly\
    \ with UDP traffic, i.e., it associates the appropriate\n   portion of the UDP\
    \ packets with yellow or red colour marking if such\n   flows transmit at a sustained\
    \ level above the contracted rate.\n                +---------+\n            \

    \ yellow and green translate into DS\n   codepoints representing drop precedence\
    \ 2, 1 and 0 of a single AF\n   class respectively.\n   Based on feedback from\
    \ four different implementations, the TSWTCM is\n   simple and straightforward\
    \ to implement.  The TSWTCM can be\n   implemented in either software or hardware\
    \ depending on the nature of\n   the forwarding engine.\n"
- title: 3.0 Rate Estimator
  contents:
  - "3.0 Rate Estimator\n   The Rate Estimator provides an estimate of the traffic\
    \ stream's\n   arrival rate.  This rate should approximate the running average\n\
    \   bandwidth of the traffic stream over a specific period of time\n   (AVG_INTERVAL).\n\
    \   This memo does not specify a particular algorithm for the Rate\n   Estimator.\
    \  However, different Rate Estimators should yield similar\n   results in terms\
    \ of bandwidth estimation over the same fixed window\n   (AVG_INTERVAL) of time.\
    \  Examples of Rate Estimation schemes include:\n   exponential weighted moving\
    \ average (EWMA) and the time-based rate\n   estimation algorithm provided in\
    \ [TON98].\n   Preferably, the Rate Estimator SHOULD maintain time-based history\
    \ for\n   its bandwidth estimation.  However, the Rate Estimator MAY utilize\n\
    \   weight-based history.  In this case, the Estimator used should\n   discuss\
    \ how the weight translates into a time-window such as\n   AVG_INTERVAL.\n   Since\
    \ weight-based Estimators track bandwidth based on packet\n   arrivals, a high-sending\
    \ traffic stream will decay its past history\n   faster than a low-sending traffic\
    \ stream. The time-based Estimator is\n   intended to address this problem. The\
    \ latter Rate Estimator utilizes\n   a low-pass filter decaying function. [FANG99]\
    \ shows that this Rate\n   Estimator decays past history independently of the\
    \ traffic stream's\n   packet arrival rate.  The algorithm for the Rate Estimator\
    \ from\n   [TON98] is shown in Figure 2 below.\n"
