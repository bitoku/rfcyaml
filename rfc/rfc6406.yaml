- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a reference peering architecture for\
    \ the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], it's functional\n   components\
    \ and interfaces in the context of session peering for\n   multimedia interconnects.\
    \  In this process, we define the peering\n   reference architecture and its functional\
    \ components, and peering\n   interface functions from the perspective of a SIP\
    \ Service Provider's\n   (SSP's) [RFC5486] network.  Thus, it also describes the\
    \ components\n   and the steps necessary to establish a session between two SSP\n\
    \   peering domains.\n   An SSP may also be referred to as an Internet Telephony\
    \ Service\n   Provider (ITSP).  While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used\n\
    \   interchangeably, this document and other subsequent SIP peering-\n   related\
    \ documents should use the term SSP.  SSP more accurately\n   depicts the use\
    \ of SIP as the underlying Layer 5 signaling protocol.\n   This architecture enables\
    \ the interconnection of two SSPs in Layer 5\n   peering, as defined in the SIP-based\
    \ session peering requirements\n   [RFC6271].\n   Layer 3 peering is outside the\
    \ scope of this document.  Hence, the\n   figures in this document do not show\
    \ routers so that the focus is on\n   Layer 5 protocol aspects.\n   This document\
    \ uses terminology defined in \"Session Peering for\n   Multimedia Interconnect\
    \ (SPEERMINT) Terminology\" [RFC5486].  In\n   addition to normative references\
    \ included herein, readers may also\n   find [RFC6405] informative.\n"
- title: 2.  New Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  New Terminology\n   [RFC5486] is a key reference for the majority of the\
    \ SPEERMINT-\n   related terminology used in this document.  However, some additional\n\
    \   new terms are used here as follows in this section.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Session Border Controller (SBC)
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Session Border Controller (SBC)\n   A Session Border Controller (SBC) is\
    \ referred to in Section 5.  An\n   SBC can contain a Signaling Function (SF),\
    \ Signaling Path Border\n   Element (SBE) and Data Path Border Element (DBE),\
    \ and may perform the\n   Lookup Function (LUF) and Location Routing Function\
    \ (LRF), as\n   described in Section 3.  Whether the SBC performs one or more\
    \ of\n   these functions is, generally speaking, dependent upon how a SIP\n  \
    \ Service Provider (SSP) configures such a network element.  In\n   addition,\
    \ requirements for an SBC can be found in [RFC5853].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Carrier-of-Record
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Carrier-of-Record\n   A carrier-of-record, as used in Section 6.1.2.2,\
    \ is defined in\n   [RFC5067].  That document describes the term as referring\
    \ to the\n   entity having discretion over the domain and zone content and acting\n\
    \   as the registrant for a telephone number, as represented in ENUM.\n   This\
    \ can be as follows:\n   o  the service provider to which the E.164 number was\
    \ allocated for\n      end user assignment, whether by the National Regulatory\
    \ Authority\n      (NRA) or the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), for\n\
    \      instance, a code under \"International Networks\" (+882) or\n      \"Universal\
    \ Personal Telecommunications (UPT)\" (+878), or\n   o  if the number is ported,\
    \ the service provider to which the number\n      was ported, or\n   o  where\
    \ numbers are assigned directly to end users, the service\n      provider that\
    \ the end user number assignee has chosen to provide a\n      Public Switched\
    \ Telephone Network / Public Land Mobile Network\n      (PSTN/PLMN) point-of-interconnect\
    \ for the number.\n   It is understood that the definition of \"carrier-of-record\"\
    \ within a\n   given jurisdiction is subject to modification by national\n   authorities.\n"
- title: 3.  Reference Architecture
  contents:
  - "3.  Reference Architecture\n   The following figure depicts the architecture\
    \ and logical functions\n   that form peering between two SSPs.\n   For further\
    \ details on the elements and functions described in this\n   figure, please refer\
    \ to [RFC5486].  The following terms, which appear\n   in Figure 1 and are documented\
    \ in [RFC5486], are reproduced here for\n   simplicity.\n   o  Data Path Border\
    \ Element (DBE): A data path border element (DBE)\n      is located on the administrative\
    \ border of a domain through which\n      the media associated with an inter-domain\
    \ session flows.\n      Typically, it provides media-related functions such as\
    \ deep packet\n      inspection and modification, media relay, and firewall-traversal\n\
    \      support.  The DBE may be controlled by the SBE.\n   o  E.164 Number Mapping\
    \ (ENUM): See [RFC6116].\n   o  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): See [RFC1035].\n\
    \   o  Location Routing Function (LRF): The Location Routing Function\n      (LRF)\
    \ determines, for the target domain of a given request, the\n      location of\
    \ the SF in that domain, and optionally develops other\n      Session Establishment\
    \ Data (SED) required to route the request to\n      that domain.  An example\
    \ of the LRF may be applied to either\n      example in Section 4.3.3 of [RFC5486].\
    \  Once the ENUM response or\n      SIP 302 redirect is received with the destination's\
    \ SIP URI, the\n      LRF must derive the destination peer's SF from the FQDN\
    \ in the\n      domain portion of the URI.  In some cases, some entity (usually\
    \ a\n      third party or federation) provides peering assistance to the\n   \
    \   Originating SSP by providing this function.  The assisting entity\n      may\
    \ provide information relating to direct (Section 4.2.1 of\n      [RFC5486]) or\
    \ indirect (Section 4.2.2 of [RFC5486]) peering as\n      necessary.\n   o  Lookup\
    \ Function (LUF): The Lookup Function (LUF) determines, for a\n      given request,\
    \ the target domain to which the request should be\n      routed.  An example\
    \ of an LUF is an ENUM [4] look-up or a SIP\n      INVITE request to a SIP proxy\
    \ providing redirect responses for\n      peers.  In some cases, some entity (usually\
    \ a third party or\n      federation) provides peering assistance to the Originating\
    \ SSP by\n      providing this function.  The assisting entity may provide\n \
    \     information relating to direct (Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5486]) or\n      indirect\
    \ (Section 4.2.2 of [RFC5486]) peering as necessary.\n   o  Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP): See [RFC3550].\n   o  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): See\
    \ [RFC3261].\n   o  Signaling Path Border Element (SBE): A signaling path border\n\
    \      element (SBE) is located on the administrative border of a domain\n   \
    \   through which inter-domain session-layer messages will flow.\n      Typically,\
    \ it provides Signaling Functions such as protocol inter-\n      working (for\
    \ example, H.323 to SIP), identity and topology hiding,\n      and Session Admission\
    \ Control for a domain.\n   o  Signaling Function (SF): The Signaling Function\
    \ (SF) performs\n      routing of SIP requests for establishing and maintaining\
    \ calls and\n      in order to assist in the discovery or exchange of parameters\
    \ to\n      be used by the Media Function (MF).  The SF is a capability of SIP\n\
    \      processing elements such as SIP proxies, SBEs, and User Agents.\n   o \
    \ SIP Service Provider (SSP): A SIP Service Provider (SSP) is an\n      entity\
    \ that provides session services utilizing SIP signaling to\n      its customers.\
    \  In the event that the SSP is also a function of\n      the SP, it may also\
    \ provide media streams to its customers.  Such\n      an SSP may additionally\
    \ be peered with other SSPs.  An SSP may\n      also interconnect with the PSTN.\n\

  contents:
  - "4.  Procedures of Inter-Domain SSP Session Establishment\n   This document assumes\
    \ that in order for a session to be established\n   from a User Agent (UA) in\
    \ the Originating (or Indirect) SSP's network\n   to a UA in the Target SSP's\
    \ network the following steps are taken:\n   1.  Determine the Target or Indirect\
    \ SSP via the LUF.  (Note: If the\n       target address represents an intra-SSP\
    \ resource, the behavior is\n       out of scope with respect to this document.)\n\
    \   2.  Determine the address of the SF of the Target SSP via the LRF.\n   3.\
    \  Establish the session.\n   4.  Exchange the media, which could include voice,\
    \ video, text, etc.\n   5.  End the session (BYE)\n   The Originating or Indirect\
    \ SSP would perform steps 1-4, the Target\n   SSP would perform step 4, and either\
    \ one can perform step 5.\n   In the case that the Target SSP changes, steps 1-4\

    \ private roots\n   are used, specialized routing rules may be implemented; these\
    \ rules\n   may vary depending upon whether an Originating or Indirect SSP is\n\
    \   querying the LUF.\n"
- title: 6.1.1.1.  Target Address Analysis
  contents:
  - "6.1.1.1.  Target Address Analysis\n   When the Originating (or Indirect) SSP\
    \ receives a request to\n   communicate, it analyzes the target URI to determine\
    \ whether the call\n   needs to be routed internally or externally to its network.\
    \  The\n   analysis method is internal to the SSP; thus, outside the scope of\n\
    \   SPEERMINT.\n   If the target address does not represent a resource inside\
    \ the\n   Originating (or Indirect) SSP's administrative domain or federation\n\
    \   of domains, then the Originating (or Indirect) SSP performs a Lookup\n   Function\
    \ (LUF) to determine a target address, and then it resolves\n   the call routing\
    \ data by using the Location Routing Function (LRF).\n   For example, if the request\
    \ to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI\n   type [RFC3861] [RFC3953], the\
    \ Originating (or Indirect) SSP follows\n   the procedures in [RFC3861].  If the\
    \ highest priority supported URI\n   scheme is sip: or sips:, the Originating\
    \ (or Indirect) SSP skips to\n   SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.3.  Likewise,\
    \ if the target address\n   is already a sip: or sips: URI in an external domain,\
    \ the Originating\n   (or Indirect) SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section\
    \ 6.1.2.1.\n   This may be the case, to use one example, with\n   \"sips:bob@biloxi.example.com\"\
    .\n   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the\n   SSP\
    \ may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according to\n   local\
    \ policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string\n   beginning \"011\
    \ 44\" could be converted to \"+44\"; in the United\n   Kingdom, \"00 1\" could\
    \ be converted to \"+1\".  Once the SSP has an\n   E.164 address, it can use ENUM.\n"
- title: 6.1.1.2.  ENUM Lookup
  contents:
  - "6.1.1.2.  ENUM Lookup\n   If an external E.164 address is the target, the Originating\
    \ (or\n   Indirect) SSP consults the public \"User ENUM\" rooted at e164.arpa,\n\
    \   according to the procedures described in [RFC6116].  The SSP must\n   query\
    \ for the \"E2U+sip\" enumservice as described in [RFC3764], but\n   may check\
    \ for other enumservices.  The Originating (or Indirect) SSP\n   may consult a\
    \ cache or alternate representation of the ENUM data\n   rather than actual DNS\
    \ queries.  Also, the SSP may skip actual DNS\n   queries if the Originating (or\
    \ Indirect) SSP is sure that the target\n   address country code is not represented\
    \ in e164.arpa.\n   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen based on an \"E2U+im\" [RFC3861]\
    \ or\n   \"E2U+pres\" [RFC3953] enumserver, the SSP follows the procedures for\n\
    \   resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such as SIP or\n   Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as described in the\n   previous section.\n\
    \   The Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) response to the ENUM lookup may\n   be\
    \ a SIP address of record (AOR) (such as \"sips:bob@example.com\") or\n   SIP\
    \ URI (such as \"sips:bob@sbe1.biloxi.example.com\").  In the case\n   when a\

    \   [RFC5746] [RFC5878].  When the receiving SSP receives a TLS client\n   hello,\
    \ it responds with its certificate.  The Target SSP certificate\n   should be\
    \ valid and rooted in a well-known certificate authority.\n   The procedures to\
    \ authenticate the SSP's originating domain are\n   specified in [RFC5922].\n\
    \   The SF of the Target SSP verifies that the Identity header is valid,\n   corresponds\
    \ to the message, corresponds to the Identity-Info header,\n   and that the domain\
    \ in the From header corresponds to one of the\n   domains in the TLS client certificate.\n\
    \   As noted above in Section 6.1.3.2, some deployments may utilize IPsec\n  \
    \ rather than TLS.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2.2.  Receive SIP Requests\n   Once a trust relationship is established, the\
    \ Target SSP is prepared\n   to receive incoming SIP requests.  For new requests\
    \ (dialog forming\n   or not), the receiving SSP verifies if the target (Request-URI)\
    \ is a\n   domain for which it is responsible.  For these requests, there should\n\
    \   be no remaining Route header field values.  For in-dialog requests,\n   the\
    \ receiving SSP can verify that it corresponds to the top-most\n   Route header\
    \ field value.\n   The receiving SSP may reject incoming requests due to local\
    \ policy.\n   When a request is rejected because the Originating (or Indirect)\
    \ SSP\n   is not authorized to peer, the receiving SSP should respond with a\n\
    \   403 response with the reason phrase \"Unsupported Peer\".\n"

    \ implementation\n   between two SSPs.\n   An example of this is to transform\
    \ a voice payload from one codec\n   (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC).  Additionally,\

    \ space, which is defined by\n   the federation, which may be entirely on the\
    \ public Internet, or some\n   private address space [RFC1918].  The origination\
    \ or termination\n   networks may or may not entirely be in the same address space.\
    \  If\n   they are not, then a Network Address Translation (NAT) or similar may\n\
    \   be needed before the signaling or media is presented correctly to the\n  \
    \ federation.  The only requirement is that all associated entities\n   across\
    \ the peering interface are reachable.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The level (or types) of security mechanisms implemented\
    \ between\n   peering providers is, in practice, dependent upon on the underlying\n\
    \   physical security of SSP connections.  This means, as noted in\n   Section\
    \ 6.1.3.3, whether peering equipment is in a secure facility or\n   not may bear\
    \ on other types of security mechanisms that may be\n   appropriate.  Thus, if\
    \ two SSPs peered across public Internet links,\n   they are likely to use IPsec\
    \ or TLS since the link between the two\n   domains should be considered untrusted.\n\
    \   Many detailed and highly relevant security requirements for SPEERMINT\n  \
    \ have been documented in Section 5 of [RFC6271].  As a result, that\n   document\
    \ should be considered required reading.\n   Additional and important security\
    \ considerations have been documented\n   separately in [RFC6404].  This document\
    \ describes the many relevant\n   security threats to SPEERMINT, as well the relevant\
    \ countermeasures\n   and security protections that are recommended to combat\
    \ any potential\n   threats or other risks.  This includes a wide range of detailed\n\
    \   threats in Section 2 of [RFC6404].  It also includes key requirements\n  \
    \ in Section 3.1 of [RFC6404], such as the requirement for the LUF and\n   LRF\
    \ to support mutual authentication for queries, among other\n   requirements which\
    \ are related to [RFC6271].  Section 3.2 of\n   [RFC6404] explains how to meet\
    \ these security requirements, and then\n   Section 4 explores a wide range of\
    \ suggested countermeasures.\n"
