- title: 2.2.  PW Session Establishment
  contents:
  - "2.2.  PW Session Establishment\n   The provisioning of an Ethernet port or Ethernet\
    \ VLAN and its\n   association with a PW triggers the establishment of an L2TP\
    \ session\n   via the standard Incoming Call three-way handshake described in\n\
    \   Section 3.4.1 of [RFC3931].\n   Note that an L2TP Outgoing Call is essentially\
    \ a method of\n   controlling the originating point of a Switched Virtual Circuit\n\
    \   (SVC), allowing it to be established from any reachable L2TP-enabled\n   device\
    \ able to perform outgoing calls.  The Outgoing Call model and\n   its corresponding\
    \ OCRQ, OCRP, and OCCN control messages are mainly\n   used within the dial arena\
    \ with L2TPv2 today and has not been found\n   applicable for PW applications\
    \ yet.\n   The following are the signaling elements needed for the Ethernet PW\n\
    \   establishment:\n   a) Pseudowire Type: The type of a Pseudowire can be either\
    \ \"Ethernet\n      port\" or \"Ethernet VLAN\".  Each LCCE signals its Pseudowire\
    \ type\n      in the Pseudowire Type AVP [RFC3931].  The assigned values for\n\
    \      \"Ethernet port\" and \"Ethernet VLAN\" Pseudowire types are captured\n\
    \      in the \"IANA Considerations\" of this document.  The Pseudowire\n    \
    \  Type AVP MUST be present in the ICRQ.\n   b) Pseudowire ID: Each PW is associated\
    \ with a Pseudowire ID.  The\n      two LCCEs of a PW have the same Pseudowire\
    \ ID for it.  The Remote\n      End Identifier AVP [RFC3931] is used to convey\
    \ the Pseudowire ID.\n      The Remote End Identifier AVP MUST be present in the\
    \ ICRQ in order\n      for the remote LCCE to determine the PW to associate the\
    \ L2TP\n      session with.  An implementation MUST support a Remote End\n   \
    \   Identifier of four octets known to both LCCEs either by manual\n      configuration\
    \ or some other means.  Additional Remote End\n      Identifier formats that MAY\
    \ be supported are outside the scope of\n      this document.\n   c) The Circuit\
    \ Status AVP [RFC3931] MUST be included in ICRQ and ICRP\n      to indicate the\
    \ circuit status of the Ethernet port or Ethernet\n      VLAN.  For ICRQ and ICRP,\
    \ the Circuit Status AVP MUST indicate\n      that the circuit status is for a\
    \ new circuit (refer to N bit in\n      Section 2.3.3).  An implementation MAY\
    \ send an ICRQ or ICRP before\n      an Ethernet interface is ACTIVE, as long\
    \ as the Circuit Status AVP\n      (refer to A bit in Section 2.3.3) in the ICRQ\
    \ or ICRP reflects the\n      correct status of the Ethernet port or Ethernet\
    \ VLAN link.  A\n      subsequent circuit status change of the Ethernet port or\
    \ Ethernet\n      VLAN MUST be conveyed in the Circuit Status AVP in ICCN or SLI\n\
    \      control messages.  For ICCN and SLI (refer to Section 2.3.2), the\n   \
    \   Circuit Status AVP MUST indicate that the circuit status is for an\n     \
    \ existing circuit (refer to N bit in Section 2.3.3) and reflect the\n      current\
    \ status of the link (refer to A bit in Section 2.3.3).\n"

    \ link status notifications between LCCEs.  This can be useful\n   to indicate\
    \ Ethernet interface state changes without bringing down\n   the L2TP session.\
    \  Note that change in the Ethernet interface state\n   will trigger an SLI message\
    \ for each PW associated with that Ethernet\n   interface.  This may be one Ethernet\
    \ port PW or more than one\n   Ethernet VLAN PW.  The SLI message MUST be sent\
    \ any time there is a\n   status change of any values identified in the Circuit\
    \ Status AVP.\n   The only exception to this is the initial ICRQ, ICRP, and CDN\n\
    \   messages that establish and tear down the L2TP session itself.  The\n   SLI\
    \ message may be sent from either LCCE at any time after the first\n   ICRQ is\

    \ the\n   functionality performed by the PW termination point depicted in\n  \
    \ Figure 1, unless otherwise indicated.\n   The entire Ethernet frame, without\
    \ the preamble or frame check\n   sequence (FCS), is encapsulated in L2TPv3 and\
    \ is sent as a single\n   packet by the ingress LCCE.  This is done regardless\
    \ of whether or\n   not a VLAN tag is present in the Ethernet frame.  For Ethernet\
    \ port-\n   to-port mode, the remote LCCE simply decapsulates the L2TP payload\n\
    \   and sends it out on the appropriate interface without modifying the\n   Ethernet\
    \ header.  For Ethernet VLAN-to-VLAN mode, the remote LCCE MAY\n   rewrite the\
    \ VLAN tag.  As described in Section 1, the VLAN tag\n   modification is an NSP\
    \ function.\n   The Ethernet PW over L2TP is homogeneous with respect to packet\n\

    \ and reassembly\n   mechanism within L2TP itself in the event that no other option\
    \ is\n   available.  Implementations MUST follow these guidelines with respect\n\
    \   to fragmentation and reassembly.\n"
- title: 4.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Applicability Statement\n   The Ethernet PW emulation allows a service provider\
    \ to offer a\n   \"port-to-port\"-based Ethernet service across an IP Packet Switched\n\
    \   Network (PSN), while the Ethernet VLAN PW emulation allows an \"VLAN-\n  \
    \ to-VLAN\"-based Ethernet service across an IP Packet Switched Network\n   (PSN).\n\
    \   The Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW emulation has the following\n   characteristics\
    \ in relationship to the respective native service:\n   o  Ethernet PW connects\
    \ two Ethernet port ACs, and Ethernet VLAN PW\n      connects two Ethernet VLAN\
    \ ACs, which both support bi-directional\n      transport of variable-length Ethernet\
    \ frames.  The ingress LCCE\n      strips the preamble and FCS from the Ethernet\
    \ frame and transports\n      the frame in its entirety across the PW.  This is\
    \ done regardless\n      of the presence of the VLAN tag in the frame.  The egress\
    \ LCCE\n      receives the Ethernet frame from the PW and regenerates the\n  \
    \    preamble and FCS before forwarding the frame to the attached\n      Remote\
    \ System (see Section 3.1).  Since FCS is not being\n      transported across\
    \ either Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PWs, payload\n      integrity transparency\
    \ may be lost.  To achieve payload integrity\n      transparency on Ethernet or\
    \ Ethernet VLAN PWs using L2TP over IP\n      or L2TP over UDP/IP, the L2TPv3\
    \ session can utilize IPsec as\n      specified in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC3931].\n\
    \   o  While architecturally [RFC3985] outside the scope of the L2TPv3 PW\n  \
    \    itself, if VLAN tags are present, the NSP may rewrite VLAN tags on\n    \
    \  ingress or egress from the PW (see Section 3.1).\n   o  The Ethernet or Ethernet\
    \ VLAN PW only supports homogeneous\n      Ethernet frame type across the PW;\
    \ both ends of the PW must be\n      either tagged or untagged.  Heterogeneous\
    \ frame type support\n      achieved with NSP functionality is outside the scope\
    \ of this\n      document (see Section 3.1).\n   o  Ethernet port or Ethernet\
    \ VLAN status notification is provided\n      using the Circuit Status AVP in\
    \ the SLI message (see Sections\n      2.3.2 and 2.3.3).  Loss of connectivity\
    \ between LCCEs can be\n      detected by the L2TPv3 keep-alive mechanism (see\
    \ Section 2.3.1 of\n      this document and Section 4.4 of [RFC3931]).  The LCCE\
    \ can convey\n      these indications back to its attached Remote System.\n  \
    \ o  The maximum frame size that can be supported is limited by the PSN\n    \
    \  MTU minus the L2TPv3 header size, unless fragmentation and\n      reassembly\
    \ is used (see Section 3.3 of this document and Section\n      4.1.4 of [RFC3931]).\n\
    \   o  The Packet Switched Network may reorder, duplicate, or silently\n     \
    \ drop packets.  Sequencing may be enabled in the Ethernet or\n      Ethernet\
    \ VLAN PW for some or all packets to detect lost,\n      duplicate, or out-of-order\
    \ packets on a per-session basis (see\n      Section 3.2).\n   o  The faithfulness\
    \ of an Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW may be\n      increased by leveraging Quality-of-Service\
    \ (QoS) features of the\n      LCCEs and the underlying PSN.  For example, for\

- title: 5.  Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "5.  Congestion Control\n   As explained in [RFC3985], the PSN carrying the PW\
    \ may be subject to\n   congestion, with congestion characteristics depending\
    \ on PSN type,\n   network architecture, configuration, and loading.  During congestion,\n\
    \   the PSN may exhibit packet loss that will impact the service carried\n   by\
    \ the Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW.  In addition, since Ethernet or\n   Ethernet\
    \ VLAN PWs carry a variety of services across the PSN,\n   including but not restricted\
    \ to TCP/IP, they may or may not behave in\n   a TCP-friendly manner prescribed\
    \ by [RFC2914] and thus consume more\n   than their fair share.\n   Whenever possible,\
    \ Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PWs should be run over\n   traffic-engineered PSNs\
    \ providing bandwidth allocation and admission\n   control mechanisms.  IntServ-enabled\
    \ domains providing the Guaranteed\n   Service (GS) or DiffServ-enabled domains\
    \ using EF (expedited\n   forwarding) are examples of traffic-engineered PSNs.\
    \  Such PSNs will\n   minimize loss and delay while providing some degree of isolation\
    \ of\n   the Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW's effects from neighboring streams.\n\
    \   LCCEs SHOULD monitor for congestion (by using explicit congestion\n   notification\
    \ or by measuring packet loss) in order to ensure that the\n   service using the\
    \ Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW may be maintained.\n   When severe congestion is\
    \ detected (for example, when enabling\n   sequencing and detecting that the packet\
    \ loss is higher than a\n   threshold), the Ethernet or Ethernet VLAN PW SHOULD\
    \ be halted by\n   tearing down the L2TP session via a CDN message.  The PW may\
    \ be\n   restarted by manual intervention or by automatic means after an\n   appropriate\
    \ waiting time.  Note that the thresholds and time periods\n   for shutdown and\
    \ possible automatic recovery need to be carefully\n   configured.  This is necessary\
    \ to avoid loss of service due to\n   temporary congestion and to prevent oscillation\
    \ between the congested\n   and halted states.\n   This specification offers no\
    \ congestion control and is not TCP\n   friendly [TFRC].  Future works for PW\
    \ congestion control (being\n   studied by the PWE3 Working Group) will provide\
    \ congestion control\n   for all PW types including Ethernet and Ethernet VLAN\
    \ PWs.\n"
