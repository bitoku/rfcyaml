- title: 1. Protocol Documents
  contents:
  - "1. Protocol Documents\n   \"Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits\" [2]\
    \ suggests an\n   enhancement to the \"Routing Internet Protocol\" (RIP) [3] and\
    \ \"RIP-2\"\n   [4] to allow them to run more cost-effectively on Wide Area Networks\n\
    \   (WANs).  Network management extensions for Demand RIP are described\n   in\
    \ RIP Version 2 MIB Extensions [5].\n"
- title: 2. Applicability
  contents:
  - "2. Applicability\n   Demand RIP requires that there is an underlying mechanism\
    \ for\n   determining unreachability in a finite predictable period.\n   The demand\
    \ extensions to RIP are particularly appropriate for WANs\n   where the cost -\
    \ either financial or packet overhead - would make\n   periodic transmission of\
    \ routing (or service advertising) updates\n   unacceptable:\n   o  Connection\
    \ oriented Public Data Networks - for example X.25 packet\n      switched networks\
    \ or ISDN.\n   o  Point-to-point links supporting PPP link quality monitoring\
    \ or\n      echo request to determine link failure.\n   A demand RIP implementation\
    \ runs standard RIP on Local Area Networks\n   (LANs) allowing them to interoperate\
    \ transparently with\n   implementations adhering to the original specifications.\n"
- title: 3. Key Features
  contents:
  - "3. Key Features\n   The proposal shares the same basic algorithms as RIP or RIP-2\
    \ when\n   running on LANs or fixed point-to-point links; Packet formats,\n  \
    \ broadcast frequency, triggered update operation and database timeouts\n   are\
    \ all unmodified.\n   The new features operate on WANs which use switched circuits\
    \ on\n   demand to achieve intermittent connectivity.  Instead of using\n   periodic\
    \ 'broadcasts', information is only sent as triggered updates.\n   The proposal\
    \ makes use of features of the underlying connection\n   oriented service to provide\
    \ feedback on connectivity.\n"
- title: 3.1 Triggered Updates
  contents:
  - "3.1 Triggered Updates\n   Updates are only sent on the WAN when an event changes\
    \ the routing\n   database.  Each update is retransmitted until acknowledged.\n\
    \   Information received in an update is not timed out.\n   The packet format\
    \ of a RIP response is modified (with a different\n   unique command field) to\
    \ include sequence and fragment number\n   information.  An acknowledgement packet\
    \ is also defined.\n"
- title: 3.2 Circuit Manager
  contents:
  - "3.2 Circuit Manager\n   The circuit manager running below the IP network layer\
    \ is responsible\n   for establishing a circuit to the next hop router whenever\
    \ there is\n   data (or a routing update) to transfer.  After a period of inactivity\n\
    \   the circuit will be closed by the circuit manager.\n   If the circuit manager\
    \ fails to make a connection a circuit down\n   indication is sent to the routing\
    \ application.  The circuit manager\n   will then attempt at (increasing) intervals\
    \ to establish a\n   connection.  When successful a circuit up indication is sent\
    \ to the\n   routing application.\n"
- title: 3.3 Presumption of Reachability
  contents:
  - "3.3 Presumption of Reachability\n   In a stable network there is no requirement\
    \ to propagate routing\n   information on a circuit, so if no routing information\
    \ is (being)\n   received on a circuit it is assumed that:\n   o  The most recently\
    \ received information is accurate.\n   o  The intervening path is operational\
    \ (although there may be no\n      current connection).\n   If the circuit manager\
    \ determines that the intervening path is NOT\n   operational routing information\
    \ previously received on that circuit\n   is timed out.  It is worth stressing\
    \ that it can be ANY routed\n   datagram which triggers the event.\n   When the\
    \ circuit manager re-establishes a connection, the application\n   exchanges full\
    \ routing information with its peer.\n"
- title: 3.4 Routing Information Flow Control
  contents:
  - "3.4 Routing Information Flow Control\n   If the circuit manager reports a circuit\
    \ as down, the routing\n   application is flow controlled from sending further\
    \ information on\n   the circuit.\n   To prevent transmit queue overflow and also\
    \ to avoid 'predictable'\n   circuit down messages, the routing application can\
    \ also optionally\n   limit the rate of sending routing messages to an interface.\n"
- title: 4. Implementations
  contents:
  - "4. Implementations\n   At this stage there is only believed to be one completed\n\
    \   implementation.\n   The Spider Systems' implementation supports all the features\
    \ outlined\n   for IP RIP-1, IPX RIP and IPX SAP.  RIP-2 is not currently supported.\n\
    \   It has been tested against itself on X.25 and ISDN WANs.  It has also\n  \
    \ been tested in operation with various router and host RIP-1, IPX RIP\n   and\
    \ IPX SAP implementations on Ethernet LANs.\n   Two other Novell-only implementations\
    \ are known to be under\n   development.\n"
- title: 5. Restrictions
  contents:
  - "5. Restrictions\n   Demand RIP relies on the ability to place a call in either\
    \ direction.\n   Some dialup services - for example DTR dialing - allow calls\
    \ to be\n   made in one direction only.\n   Demand RIP can not operate with third-party\
    \ advertisement of routes\n   on the WAN.  The next hop IP address in RIP-2 should\
    \ always be\n   0.0.0.0 for any routes advertised on the WAN.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Security is provided through authentication of\
    \ the logical and\n   physical address of the sender of the routing update.  Incoming\
    \ call\n   requests are matched by the circuit manager against a list of\n   physical\
    \ addresses (used to make outgoing calls).  The routing\n   application makes\
    \ a further check against the logical address of an\n   incoming update.\n   Additional\
    \ security can be provided by RIP-2 authentication [2] where\n   appropriate.\n"
