Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB), the Mobile IPv6 MIB, for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, the Mobile IPv6 MIB will be used to monitor and control the mobile node, home agent, and correspondent node functions of a Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) entity.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The Mobile IPv6 Protocol Entities
[RFC3775] specifies a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.
An entity that implements the MIPv6 protocol is a MIPv6 entity.
There are three types of entities envisaged by the MIPv6 protocol.
A node that can change its point of attachment from one link to another, while still being reachable via its home address.
A peer node with which a mobile node is communicating.
The correspondent node may be either mobile or stationary.
(Note that a correspondent node does not necessarily require MIPv6 support.)
A router on a mobile node's home link with which the mobile node has registered its current care of address.
While the mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts packets on the home link destined to the mobile node's home address, encapsulates them, and routes them to the mobile node's registered care of address.
This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used to monitor and control MIPv6 entities.
The terminology used in this document is consistent with the definitions used in Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC3775].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements
For managing a MIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor the following: capabilities of MIPv6 entities traffic due to MIPv6 binding related statistics (at home agent, correspondent node, and mobile node)
binding details (at home agent and correspondent node) history of Binding Updates (at home agent, correspondent node, and mobile node)
The MIPv6 protocol document stipulates that several MIPv6 related parameters should be manually configurable.
The MIPv6 MIB should define managed objects that can be used to configure the related parameters, for example: the preference value the home agent will use in Router Advertisements; the lifetime value the home agent will use in Router Advertisements; whether a home agent will send ICMP Mobile Prefix Advertisements to mobile nodes; whether a home agent will respond to ICMP Mobile Prefix Solicitation messages from mobile nodes; and whether a home agent will process multicast group membership control messages from mobile nodes.
The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the essential needs of monitoring and control are met.
It is envisaged that wherever possible existing MIBs will be used (e.g., IPSec MIB, Neighbor Discovery MIB, Tunnel MIB [RFC4087]) for monitor and control of MIPv6 entities.
It is assumed that the Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (MOBILEIPV6 MIB) will always be implemented in conjunction with the IPv6 capable version of the IP MIB [RFC4293].
The MOBILEIPV6 MIB uses the textual conventions defined in the INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001].
The Mobile IPv6 MIB is composed of the following groups of definitions: mip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are common to all the Mobile IPv6 entities.
this group models the home agent service.
It is composed of objects specific to the services and associated advertisement parameters offered by the home agent on each of its links.
It also contains objects pertaining to the maintenance of the home agent list on each of the links on which the service is offered.
this group models the mobile node service.
It is composed of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent discovery function and related parameters.
It also contains objects that record the movement of the mobile node.
: models the correspondent node and is primarily scoped to its participation in the Return Routability procedure for achieving Route Optimization triggered by the mobile node.
mip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that will be used to asynchronously monitor the Mobile IPv6 entities.
The tables contained in the above groups are as follows:
: models the binding cache on the home agent and correspondent node.
It contains details of the Binding Update requests that have been received and accepted.
: tracks the history of the binding cache.
: the mobile node wise traffic counters.
mip6MnHomeAddressTable  : contains all the home addresses pertaining to the mobile node and the corresponding registration status.
It contains information about the registration requests sent by the mobile node and the corresponding results.

mip6@ietf.org" DESCRIPTION "The MIB module for monitoring Mobile IPv6 entities.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4295; see the RFC itself for full legal notices. "
The value of the status field in the Binding Acknowledgment message when the Binding Update was rejected. "
"This object indicates the Mobile IPv6 functions that are supported by this managed entity.
Multiple Mobile IPv6 functions may be supported by a single entity. "
"This object indicates whether the Mobile IPv6 function is enabled for the managed entity.
If it is enabled, the agent discovery and registration functions will be operational.
Changing the status from enabled(1) to disabled(2) will terminate the agent discovery and registration functions.
On the other hand, changing the status from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will start the agent discovery and registration functions.
The value of this object SHOULD remain unchanged across reboots of the managed entity. "
SEQUENCE OF Mip6BindingCacheEntry MAX ACCESS
"This table models the Binding Cache on the managed entity.
The cache is maintained by home agents and correspondent nodes.
It contains both correspondent registration entries and home registration entries.
Entries in this table are not required to survive a reboot of the managed entity. "
"This entry represents a conceptual row in the binding cache table.
It represents a single Binding Update.
Implementors need to be aware that if the total number of octets in mip6BindingHomeAddress exceeds 113, then OIDs of column instances in this row will have more than 128 sub identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
current DESCRIPTION "The InetAddressType of the mip6BindingHomeAddress that follows. "
The home address of the mobile node corresponding to the Binding Cache entry.
This field is used as the key for searching the mobile node's current care of address in the Binding Cache.
The type of the address represented by this object is specified by the corresponding mip6BindingHomeAddressType object.
"The care of address of the mobile node indicated by the home address field (mip6BindingHomeAddress) in this Binding Cache entry.
The type of the address represented by this object is specified by the corresponding mip6BindingCOAType object.
"The timestamp when this Binding Cache entry was created. "
"The lifetime in seconds granted to the mobile node for this registration. "
"The lifetime in seconds remaining for this registration.
"This object indicates whether or not this Binding Cache entry is a home registration entry (applicable only on nodes that support home agent functionality).
"The maximum value of the Sequence Number field received in previous Binding Updates for this home address (mip6BindingHomeAddress).
"The timestamp when this entry was last looked up. "
"The number of times this entry was looked up. "
mip6BindingCacheEntry 11 } mip6BindingAdminStatus OBJECT TYPE
"This is an administrative object used to control the status of a binding cache entry.
By default the value will be 'active'(1).
A value of 'inactive'(2) will indicate that the validity of the entry is suspended.
It does not exist in the binding cache for all practical purposes.
The state can be changed from 'active' to 'inactive' by operator intervention.
Causing the state to change to 'inactive' results in the entry being deleted from the cache.
Attempts to change the status from 'inactive' to 'active' will be rejected.
Once the lifetime expires an entry will be removed from the   Binding Cache.
For monitoring purposes it will be useful to have access to   the history of the Binding Cache.
It records the history of the Bindings.
The size of the table will be left to implementors.
A table containing a record of the bindings. "
The record of a binding.
Implementors need to be aware that if the total number of octets in mip6BindingHstHomeAddress exceeds 112, then OIDs of column instances in this row will have more than 128 sub identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and the corresponding sensitivity/vulnerability:
The value of this object is used to enable or disable the MIPv6 functionality on a MIPv6 entity.
Access to this MO may be abused to disrupt the MIPv6 communication.
Access to this object may be abused to force MNs into selecting the wrong HA.
: Access to this object may be abused to set the advertised lifetime to incorrect values.
That will have an adverse impact on the MIPv6 communication.
The value of this object is used to control the status of a Binding Cache entry.
Access to this object may be abused to deny Mobile IPv6 connectivity to a legitimate user or to grant Mobile IPv6 connectivity to an illegal user.
The value of this object indicates whether the home agent will send ICMP Mobile Prefix Advertisements to the mobile node.
Access to this object may be abused to send unwanted/wrong prefix information or to deny the mobile node from receiving information about the changes in the home prefixes.
This may result in disruption of the Mobile IPv6 connectivity.
: The value of this object indicates whether the home agent should respond to ICMP Mobile Prefix Solicitation messages from a mobile node.
Access to this object may be abused to deny the mobile node information about its home prefix.
This may result in disruption of the Mobile IPv6 connectivity.
The value of this object decides whether the home agent should process the multicast group membership control messages it receives from mobile nodes.
Access to this object may be used to subvert administrate policy on multicasting or to disrupt the multicast communication with the mobile node.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The address related objects in this MIB may be considered to be particularly sensitive and/or private.
The care of address related objects reveal the location and movement of the mobile node.
This information may be considered to be private and sensitive and must be carefully handled.
The mobile node's home address  and home agent related information may be considered to be sensitive too as these may provide clues to a malicious party on ways to disrupt the mobile nodes communication channels.
The correspondent node's address related MOs will reveal the nodes with whom the mobile node is corresponding.
This information may be considered private and sensitive.
mip6MnBLNodeAddressType, mip6MnBLNodeAddress SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a base arc in the 'mib 2' (standards track) OID tree for the 'mip6MIB' MODULE IDENTITY defined in the Mobile IPv6 MIB.
The mib 2 number is 133 for mip6MIB.
