  - "1. Introduction\n   New users joining the Internet community have the same questions\
    \ as\n   did everyone else who has ever joined.  Our quest is to provide the\n\
    \   Internet community with up to date, basic Internet knowledge and\n   experience,\
    \ while moving the redundancies away from the electronic\n   mailing lists so\
    \ that the lists' subscribers do not have to read the\n   same queries and answers\
    \ over and over again.\n   Future updates of this memo will be produced as User\
    \ Services members\n   become aware of additional questions that should be included,\
    \ and of\n   deficiencies or inaccuracies that should be amended in this document.\n\
    \   An additional FYI Q/A will be published which will deal with\n   intermediate\
    \ and advanced Q/A topics.\n   The Q/A mailing lists are maintained by Gary Malkin\
    \ at FTP.COM.  They\n   are used by a subgroup of the User Services Working Group\
    \ to discuss\n   the Q/A FYIs.  They include:\n   quail@ftp.com           This\
    \ is a discussion mailing list.  Its\n                           primary use is\

- title: 3. Questions About the Internet
  contents:
  - "3. Questions About the Internet\n   What is the Internet?\n      The Internet\
    \ is a large collection of networks (all of which run\n      the TCP/IP protocols)\
    \ that are tied together so that users of any\n      of the networks can use the\
    \ network services provided by TCP/IP to\n      reach users on any of the other\
    \ networks.  The Internet started\n      with the ARPANET, but now includes such\
    \ networks as NSFNET,\n      NYSERnet, and thousands of others.  There are other\
    \ major wide\n      area networks, such as BITNET and DECnet networks, that are\
    \ not\n      based on the TCP/IP protocols and are thus not part of the\n    \
    \  Internet.  However, it is possible to communicate between them and\n      the\
    \ Internet via electronic mail because of mail gateways that act\n      as \"\
    translators\" between the different network protocols involved.\n      Note: You\
    \ will often see \"internet\" with a small \"i\".  This could\n      refer to\
    \ any network built based on TCP/IP, or might refer to\n      networks using other\
    \ protocol families that are composites built\n      of smaller networks.\n  \
    \ I just got on the Internet.  What can I do now?\n      You now have access to\
    \ all the resources you are authorized to use\n      on your own Internet host,\
    \ on any other Internet host on which you\n      have an account, and on any other\
    \ Internet host that offers\n      publicly accessible information.  The Internet\
    \ gives you the\n      ability to move information between these hosts via file\n\
    \      transfers.  Once you are logged into one host, you can use the\n      Internet\
    \ to open a connection to another, login, and use its\n      services interactively\
    \ (this is known as remote login or\n      \"TELNETTING\".  In addition, you can\
    \ send electronic mail to users\n      at any Internet site and to users on many\
    \ non-Internet sites that\n      are accessible via electronic mail.\n      There\
    \ are various other services you can use.  For example, some\n      hosts provide\
    \ access to specialized databases or to archives of\n      information.  The Internet\
    \ Resource Guide provides information\n      regarding some of these sites.  The\
    \ Internet Resource Guide lists\n      facilities on the Internet that are available\
    \ to users.  Such\n      facilities include supercomputer centers, library catalogs\
    \ and\n      specialized data collections.  The guide is published by the NSF\n\
    \      Network Service Center (NNSC) and is continuously being updated.\n    \
    \  The Resource Guide is distributed free via e-mail (send a note to\n      resource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net\
    \ to join the e-mail\n      distribution) and via anonymous FTP (in nnsc.nsf.net:resource-\n\
    \      guide/*).  Hardcopy is available at a nominal fee (to cover\n      reproduction\
    \ costs) from the NNSC.  Call the NNSC at 617-873-3400\n      for more information.\n\
    \   How do I find out if a site has a computer on the Internet?\n      Three good\
    \ sources to consult are \"!%@:: A Directory of Electronic\n      Mail Addressing\
    \ and Networks\" by Donnalyn Frey and Rick Adams;\n      \"The User's Directory\
    \ of Computer Networks\", by Tracy LaQuey; and\n      \"The Matrix: Computer Networks\
    \ and Conferencing Systems\n      Worldwide\", by John Quarterman.\n      In addition,\
    \ it is possible to find some information about\n      Internet sites in the WHOIS\
    \ database maintained at the DDN NIC at\n      SRI International.  The DDN NIC\
    \ (Defense Data Network, Network\n      Information Center) provides an information\
    \ retrieval interface to\n      the database that is also called WHOIS.  To use\
    \ this interface,\n      TELNET to NIC.DDN.MIL and type \"whois\" (carriage return).\
    \  No\n      login is necessary.  Type \"help\" at the whois prompt for more\n\
    \      information on using the facility.  WHOIS will show many sites,\n     \
    \ but may not show every site registered with the DDN NIC (simply\n      for reasons\
    \ having to do with how the program is set up to search\n      the database).\n"
- title: 4. Questions About TCP/IP
  contents:
  - "4. Questions About TCP/IP\n   What is TCP/IP?\n      TCP/IP (Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol/Internet Protocol) [4,5,6]\n      is the common name for a family of\
    \ over 100 data-communications\n      protocols used to organize computers and\
    \ data-communications\n      equipment into computer networks.  TCP/IP was developed\
    \ to\n      interconnect hosts on ARPANET, PRNET (packet radio), and SATNET\n\
    \      (packet satellite).  All three of these networks have since been\n    \
    \  retired; but TCP/IP lives on.  It is currently used on a large\n      international\
    \ network of networks called the Internet, whose\n      members include universities,\
    \ other research institutions,\n      government facilities, and many corporations.\
    \  TCP/IP is also\n      sometimes used for other networks, particularly local\
    \ area\n      networks that tie together numerous different kinds of computers\n\
    \      or tie together engineering workstations.\n   What are the other well-known\
    \ standard protocols\n   in the TCP/IP family?\n      Other than TCP and IP, the\
    \ three main protocols in the TCP/IP\n      suite are the Simple Mail Transfer\
    \ Protocol (SMTP) [8], the File\n      Transfer Protocol (FTP) [3], and the TELNET\
    \ Protocol [9].  There\n      are many other protocols in use on the Internet.\
    \  The Internet\n      Activities Board (IAB) regularly publishes an RFC [2] that\n\
    \      describes the state of standardization of the various Internet\n      protocols.\
    \  This document is the best guide to the current status\n      of Internet protocols\
    \ and their recommended usage.\n"
- title: 5.  Questions About the Domain Name System
  contents:
  - "5.  Questions About the Domain Name System\n   What is the Domain Name System?\n\
    \      The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed method\n  \
    \    of organizing the name space of the Internet.  The DNS\n      administratively\
    \ groups hosts into a hierarchy of authority that\n      allows addressing and\
    \ other information to be widely distributed\n      and maintained.  A big advantage\
    \ to the DNS is that using it\n      eliminates dependence on a centrally-maintained\
    \ file that maps\n      host names to addresses.\n   What is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name?\n      A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is a domain name that\n\
    \      includes all higher level domains relevant to the entity named.\n     \
    \ If you think of the DNS as a tree-structure with each node having\n      its\
    \ own label, a Fully Qualified Domain Name for a specific node\n      would be\
    \ its label followed by the labels of all the other nodes\n      between it and\
    \ the root of the tree.  For example, for a host, a\n      FQDN would include\
    \ the string that identifies the particular host,\n      plus all domains of which\
    \ the host is a part up to and including\n      the top-level domain (the root\
    \ domain is always null).  For\n      example, PARIS.NISC.SRI.COM is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name for\n      the host at 192.33.33.109.  In addition, NISC.SRI.COM\
    \ is the FQDN\n      for the NISC domain.\n"
- title: 6. Questions About Internet Documentation
  contents:
  - "6. Questions About Internet Documentation\n   What is an RFC?\n      The Request\
    \ for Comments documents (RFCs) are working notes of the\n      Internet research\
    \ and development community.  A document in this\n      series may be on essentially\
    \ any topic related to computer\n      communication, and may be anything from\
    \ a meeting report to the\n      specification of a standard.  Submissions for\
    \ Requests for\n      Comments may be sent to the RFC Editor, Jon Postel\n   \
    \   (POSTEL@ISI.EDU).\n      Most RFCs are the descriptions of network protocols\
    \ or services,\n      often giving detailed procedures and formats for their\n\
    \      implementation.  Other RFCs report on the results of policy\n      studies\
    \ or summarize the work of technical committees or\n      workshops.  All RFCs\
    \ are considered public domain unless\n      explicitly marked otherwise.\n  \
    \    While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\n      technical\
    \ review from either the task forces, individual technical\n      experts, or\
    \ the RFC Editor, as appropriate.  Currently, most\n      standards are published\
    \ as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n      Anyone can submit\
    \ a document for publication as an RFC.\n      Submissions must be made via electronic\
    \ mail to the RFC Editor.\n      Please consult RFC 1111, \"Instructions to RFC\
    \ Authors\" [10], for\n      further information.  RFCs are accessible online\
    \ in public access\n      files, and a short message is sent to a notification\
    \ distribution\n      list indicating the availability of the memo.  Requests\
    \ to be\n      added to this distribution list should be sent to RFC-\n      REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n\
    \      The online files are copied by interested people and printed or\n     \
    \ displayed at their sites on their equipment.  (An RFC may also be\n      returned\
    \ via electronic mail in response to an electronic mail\n      query.) This means\
    \ that the format of the online files must meet\n      the constraints of a wide\
    \ variety of printing and display\n      equipment.\n      Once a document is\
    \ assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC\n      is never revised or re-issued\
    \ with the same number.  There is\n      never a question of having the most recent\
    \ version of a particular\n      RFC.  However, a protocol (such as File Transfer\
    \ Protocol (FTP))\n      may be improved and re-documented many times in several\
    \ different\n      RFCs.  It is important to verify that you have the most recent\
    \ RFC\n      on a particular protocol.  The \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\"\
    \n      [2] memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC to refer\n \
    \     to for the current specification of each protocol.\n   How do I obtain RFCs?\n\
    \      RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname\n    \
    \  RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where \"nnnn\" refers to the\n      number\
    \ of the RFC).  Login using FTP, username \"anonymous\" and\n      password \"\
    guest\".  The NIC also provides an automatic mail service\n      for those sites\
    \ which cannot use FTP.  Address the request to\n      SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and\
    \ in the subject field of the message\n      indicate the RFC number, as in \"\
    Subject: RFC nnnn\" (or \"Subject:\n      RFC nnnn.PS\" for PostScript RFCs).\n\
    \      RFCs can also be obtained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,\n     \
    \ login with username \"anonymous\" and password \"guest\"; then connect\n   \
    \   to the RFC directory (\"cd RFC\").  The file name is of the form\n      RFCnnnn.TXT-1\
    \ (where \"nnnn\" refers to the number of the RFC).  The\n      NIS also provides\
    \ an automatic mail service for those sites which\n      cannot use FTP.  Address\
    \ the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and\n      leave the subject field of the\
    \ message blank.  The first line of\n      the text of the message must be \"\
    SEND RFCnnnn.TXT-1\", where nnnn\n      is replaced by the RFC number.\n     \
    \ Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either\n      the author\
    \ of the RFC in question, or to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.  SRI\n      International operates\
    \ NIC.DDN.MIL and has a hardcopy subscription\n      service for RFCs as well\
    \ as several publications which incorporate\n      a selection of RFCs defining\
    \ Internet standards.  Unless\n      specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself,\
    \ all RFCs are for\n      unlimited distribution.\n   How do I obtain a list of\
    \ RFCs?\n      The NIC maintains a file that is an index of the RFCs.  It lists\n\
    \      each RFC, starting with the most recent, and for each RFC provides\n  \
    \    the number, title, author(s), issue date, and number of hardcopy\n      pages.\
    \  In addition, it lists the online formats (PostScript or\n      ASCII text)\
    \ for each RFC and the number of bytes each such version\n      is online on the\
    \ NIC.DDN.MIL host.  If an RFC is also an FYI, that\n      fact is noted, with\
    \ the corresponding FYI number.  (There is a\n      parallel FYI Index available).\
    \  Finally, the Index notes whether\n      or not an RFC is obsoleted or updated\
    \ by another RFC, and gives\n      the number of that RFC, or if an RFC itself\
    \ obsoletes or updates\n      another RFC, and gives that RFC number.  The index\
    \ is updated\n      online each time an RFC is issued.\n      This RFC Index is\
    \ available online from the NIC.DDN.MIL host as\n      RFC:RFC-INDEX.TXT.  The\
    \ FYI Index is online as FYI:FYI-INDEX.TXT.\n      It is also available from the\
    \ NIC in hardcopy for $10, as are\n      individual RFCs.  Call the NIC at 1-800-235-3155\
    \ for help in\n      obtaining the file.\n   Which RFCs are Standards?\n     \
    \ See \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" (currently, RFC 1140) [2].\n   What\
    \ is an Internet Draft?  Are there any guidelines available for\n   writing one?\n\
    \      Internet Drafts (I-D's) are the current working documents of the\n    \
    \  IETF.  Internet Drafts are generally in the format of an RFC with\n      some\
    \ key differences:\n         -  The Internet Drafts are not RFC's and are not\
    \ a numbered\n            document series.\n         -  The words INTERNET-DRAFT\
    \ appear in place of RFC XXXX\n            in the upper left-hand corner.\n  \
    \       -  The document does not refer to itself as an RFC or as a\n         \
    \   Draft RFC.\n         -  An Internet Draft does not state nor imply that it\
    \ is a\n            proposed standard.  To do so conflicts with the role of\n\
    \            the IAB, the RFC Editor, and the Internet Engineering\n         \
    \   Steering Group (IESG).\n      An Internet Drafts Directory has been installed\
    \ to make available,\n      for review and comment by the IETF members, draft\
    \ documents that\n      will be submitted ultimately to the IAB and the RFC Editor\
    \ to be\n      considered for publishing as an RFC.  The Internet Drafts\n   \
    \   Directories are maintained primarily at the NSFNET Network Service\n     \
    \ Center (NNSC).  There are several \"shadow\" machines which contain\n      the\
    \ IETF and Internet Drafts Directories.  They are:\n         NSF Network Service\
    \ Center:  nnsc.nsf.net\n         DDN NIC:  nic.ddn.mil\n         Pacific Rim:\
    \  munnari.oz.au\n         Europe:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17)\n      To access\
    \ these directories, use anonymous FTP.  Login with\n      username, \"anonymous\"\
    , password, \"guest\".  Once logged in, change\n      to the directory, \"cd internet-drafts\"\
    .  Internet Draft files can\n      then be retrieved.\n      For further information\
    \ on the Internet Drafts of the IETF, or if\n      you have problems with retrieving\
    \ Internet Draft documents,\n      contact Megan Davies (mdavies@nri.reston.va.us)\
    \ or Greg Vaudreuil\n      (gvaudre@nri.reston.va.us) for assistance.\n   How\
    \ do I obtain OSI Standards documents?\n      OSI Standards documents are NOT\
    \ available from the Internet via\n      anonymous FTP due to copyright restrictions.\
    \  These are available\n      from:\n         Omnicom Information Service\n  \

    \ of values to the\n      parameters of protocols is delegated by the Internet\
    \ Activities\n      Board (IAB) to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\
    \      These protocol parameters include op-codes, type fields, terminal\n   \
    \   types, system names, object identifiers, and so on.  The \"Assigned\n    \
    \  Numbers\" Request for Comments (RFC) [1] documents the currently\n      assigned\
    \ values from several series of numbers used in network\n      protocol implementations.\
    \  Internet addresses and Autonomous\n      System numbers are assigned by the\
    \ Network Information Center at\n      SRI International.  This responsibility\

    \ assignments, contact IANA@ISI.EDU.\n   What is a NIC?  What is a NOC?\n    \
    \  \"NIC\" stands for Network Information Center.  It is an\n      organization\
    \ which provides network users with information about\n      services provided\
    \ by the network.\n      \"NOC\" stands Network Operations Center.  It is an organization\n\
    \      that is responsible for maintaining a network.\n      For many networks,\
    \ especially smaller, local networks, the\n      functions of the NIC and NOC\
    \ are combined.  For larger networks,\n      such as mid-level and backbone networks,\
    \ the NIC and NOC\n      organizations are separate, yet they do need to interact\
    \ to fully\n      perform their functions.\n   What is \"The NIC\"?\n      \"\
    The NIC\" is the Defense Data Network, Network Information Center\n      (DDN\
    \ NIC) at SRI International, which is a network information\n      center which\
    \ holds a primary repository for RFCs and Internet\n      Drafts.  The host name\
    \ is NIC.DDN.MIL.  Shadow copies of the RFCs\n      and the Internet Drafts are\
    \ maintained by the NSFNET on\n      NIS.NSF.NET.\n      The DDN NIC also provides\
    \ various user assistance services for DDN\n      users; contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL\
    \ or call 1-800-235-3155 for more\n      information.  In addition, the DDN NIC\
    \ is the Internet\n      registration authority for the root domain and several\
    \ top and\n      second level domains; maintains the official DoD Internet Host\n\
    \      Table; is the site of the Internet Registry (IR); and maintains\n     \
    \ the WHOIS database of network users, hosts, domains, networks, and\n      Points\
    \ of Contact.\n   What is the IR?\n      The Internet Registry (IR) is the organization\
    \ that is responsible\n      for assigning identifiers, such as IP network numbers\
    \ and\n      autonomous system numbers, to networks.  The IR also gathers and\n\
    \      registers such assigned information.  The IR may, in the future,\n    \
    \  allocate the authority to assign network identifiers to other\n      organizations;\
    \ however, it will continue to gather data regarding\n      such assignments.\
    \  At present, the DDN NIC at SRI International\n      serves as the IR.\n   What\
    \ is the IETF?\n      The Internet has grown to encompass a large number of widely\n\
    \      geographically dispersed networks in academic and research\n      communities.\
    \  It now provides an infrastructure for a broad\n      community with various\
    \ interests.  Moreover, the family of\n      Internet protocols and system components\
    \ has moved from\n      experimental to commercial development.  To help coordinate\
    \ the\n      operation, management and evolution of the Internet, the IAB\n  \
    \    established the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n      The IETF is\
    \ chaired by Phill Gross and managed by its Internet\n      Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG).  The IETF is a large open\n      community of network designers,\
    \ operators, vendors, and\n      researchers concerned with the Internet and the\
    \ Internet protocol\n      suite.  It is organized around a set of several technical\
    \ areas,\n      each managed by a technical area director.  In addition to the\n\
    \      IETF Chairman, the area directors make up the IESG membership.\n      The\
    \ IAB has delegated to the IESG the general responsibility for\n      making the\
    \ Internet work and for the resolution of all short- and\n      mid-range protocol\
    \ and architectural issues required to make the\n      Internet function effectively.\n\
    \   What is the IRTF?\n      To promote research in networking and the development\
    \ of new\n      technology, the IAB established the Internet Research Task Force\n\
    \      (IRTF).\n      In the area of network protocols, the distinction between\
    \ research\n      and engineering is not always clear, so there will sometimes\
    \ be\n      overlap between activities of the IETF and the IRTF.  There is, in\n\
    \      fact, considerable overlap in membership between the two groups.\n    \
    \  This overlap is regarded as vital for cross-fertilization and\n      technology\
    \ transfer.\n      The IRTF is a community of network researchers, generally with\
    \ an\n      Internet focus.  The work of the IRTF is governed by its Internet\n\
    \      Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The chairman of the IRTF and IRSG\n  \
    \    is David Clark.\n"

  - "8. Questions About Services\n   How do I find someone's electronic mail address?\n\
    \      There are a number of directories on the Internet; however, all of\n  \
    \    them are far from complete.  The largest directories are the WHOIS\n    \
    \  database at the DDN NIC, the PSInet White Pages, and KNOWBOT.\n      Generally,\
    \ it is still necessary to ask the person for his or her\n      email address.\n\
    \   How do I use the WHOIS program at the DDN NIC?\n      To use the WHOIS program\
    \ to search the WHOIS database at the DDN\n      NIC, TELNET to the NIC host,\
    \ NIC.DDN.MIL.  There is no need to\n      login.  Type \"whois\" to call up the\
    \ information retrieval program.\n      Next, type the name of the person, host,\
    \ domain, network, or\n      mailbox for which you need information.  If you are\
    \ only typing\n      part of the name, end your search string with a period. \
    \ Type\n      \"help\" for a more in-depth explanation of what you can search\
    \ for\n      and how you can search.  If you have trouble, send a message to\n\
    \      NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL or call 1-800-235-3155.  Bug reports can be sent\n    \
    \  to BUG-WHOIS@NIC.DDN.MIL and suggestions for improvements to the\n      program\
    \ can be sent to SUGGESTIONS@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n   How do I become registered in the\
    \ DDN NIC's WHOIS database?\n      If you would like to be listed in the WHOIS\
    \ database, you must\n      have an electronic mailbox accessible from the Internet.\
    \  First\n      obtain the file NETINFO:USER-TEMPLATE.TXT.  You can either\n \
    \     retrieve this file via anonymous FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL or get it\n      through\
    \ electronic mail.  To obtain the file via electronic mail,\n      send a message\
    \ to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and put the file name in the\n      subject line of the\
    \ message; that is, \"Subject: NETINFO USER-\n      TEMPLATE.TXT\".  The file\
    \ will be returned to you overnight.\n      Fill out the name and address information\
    \ requested in the file\n      and return it to REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Your application\
    \ will be\n      processed and you will be added to the database.  Unless you\
    \ are\n      an official Point of Contact for a network entity registered at\n\
    \      the DDN NIC, the DDN NIC will not regularly poll you for updates,\n   \
    \   so you should remember to send corrections to your information as\n      your\
    \ contact data changes.\n   How do I use the White Pages at PSI?\n      Performance\
    \ Systems International, Inc. (PSI), sponsors a White\n      Pages Pilot Project\
    \ that collects personnel information from\n      member organizations into a\
    \ database and provides online access to\n      that data.  This effort is based\
    \ on the OSI X.500 Directory\n      standard.\n      To access the data, TELNET\
    \ to WP.PSI.COM and login as \"fred\" (no\n      password is necessary).  You\
    \ may now look up information on\n      participating organizations.  The program\
    \ provides help on usage.\n      For example, typing \"help\" will show you a\
    \ list of commands,\n      \"manual\" will give detailed documentation, and \"\
    whois\" will\n      provide information regarding how to find references to people.\n\
    \      For a list of the organizations that are participating in the\n      pilot\
    \ project by providing information regarding their members,\n      type \"whois\
    \ -org *\".\n      For more information, send a message to WP-INFO@PSI.COM.\n\
    \   How do I use the Knowbot Information Service?\n      The Knowbot Information\
    \ Service is a white pages \"meta-service\"\n      that provides a uniform interface\
    \ to heterogeneous white pages\n      services in the Internet.  Using the Knowbot\
    \ Information Service,\n      you can form a single query that can search for\
    \ white pages\n      information from the NIC WHOIS service, the CSNET WHOIS service,\n\
    \      the PSI White Pages Pilot Project, and MCI Mail, among others, and\n  \
    \    have the responses displayed in a single, uniform format.\n      Currently,\
    \ the Knowbot Information Service can be accessed through\n      TELNET to port\
    \ 185 on hosts nri.reston.va.us and sol.bucknell.edu.\n      From a UNIX host,\
    \ use \"telnet nri.reston.va.us 185\".  There is\n      also an electronic mail\
    \ interface avaliable by sending mail to\n      netaddress at either nri.reston.va.us\
    \ or sol.bucknell.edu.\n      The commands \"help\" and \"man\" summarize the\
    \ command interface.\n      Simply entering a user name at the prompt searches\
    \ a default list\n      of Internet directory services for the requested information.\n\
    \      Organization and country information can be included thorgh the\n     \
    \ syntax: \"userid@organization.country\".  For example, the queries\n      \"\
    droms@bucknell\" and \"kille@ucl.gb\" are both valid.  Note that\n      these\
    \ are not Domain Names, but rather a syntax to specify an\n      organization\
    \ and a country for the search.\n      The default list of directory services\
    \ currently includes the\n      whois services at the SRI NIC and the CSNET NIC\
    \ and the white\n      pages service for MCIMail.  If an organization is specified,\
    \ the\n      PSI X.500 service is also searched.  Other services can be\n    \
    \  requested explicitly.\n   What is Usenet?  What is Netnews?\n      Usenet and\
    \ Netnews are common names of a distributed computer\n      bulletin board system\
    \ that some computers on the Internet\n      participate in.  It is not strictly\
    \ an Internet service: many\n      computers not on the Internet also participate.\
    \  Netnews can be a\n      valuable tool to economize what might otherwise be\
    \ a large volume\n      of traffic from electronic mailing lists.\n   How do I\
    \ get on Usenet?  How do I get Netnews on my computer?\n      To get on Usenet,\
    \ you must acquire the software, which is\n      available for some computers\
    \ at no cost from some anonymous FTP\n      sites across the Internet, and you\
    \ must find an existing Usenet\n      site that is willing to support a connection\
    \ to your computer.  In\n      many cases, this \"connection\" merely represents\
    \ additional traffic\n      over existing Internet access channels.\n   What is\
    \ anonymous FTP?\n      Anonymous FTP is a conventional way of allowing you to\
    \ sign on to\n      a computer on the Internet and copy specified public files\
    \ from it\n      [3].  Some sites offer anonymous FTP to distribute software and\n\
    \      various kinds of information.  You use it like any FTP, but the\n     \
    \ username is \"anonymous\".  Many systems will allow any password and\n     \
    \ request that the password you choose is your userid.  If this\n      fails,\
    \ the generic password is usually \"guest\".\n   What is \"TELNET\"?\n      The\
    \ term \"TELNET\" refers to the remote login that's possible on\n      the Internet\
    \ because of the TELNET Protocol [9].  The use of this\n      term as a verb,\
    \ as in \"telnet to a host\" means to establish a\n      connection across the\
    \ Internet from one host to another.  Usually,\n      you must have an account\
    \ on the remote host to be able to login to\n      it once you've made a connection.\
    \  However, some hosts, such as\n      those offering white pages directories,\
    \ provide public services\n      that do not require a personal account.\n"

  contents:
  - "9. Mailing Lists\n   What is a mailing list?\n      A mailing list is really\
    \ nothing more than an alias that has\n      multiple destinations.  Mailing lists\
    \ are usually created to\n      discuss specific topics.  Anybody interested in\
    \ that topic, may\n      (usually) join that list.  Some mailing lists have membership\n\
    \      restrictions, others have message content restrictions, and still\n   \
    \   others are moderated.  Most large, \"public\" mailing lists, such as\n   \
    \   IETF and TCP-IP, have an additional mail address to which requests\n     \
    \ to be added or deleted may be sent.  Usually, these are of the\n      form listname-request.\n\
    \      There is a \"list-of-lists\" file available on the host\n      ftp.nisc.sri.com\
    \ that lists most of the major mailing lists,\n      describes their primary topics,\
    \ and explains how to subscribe to\n      them.  The file is available for anonymous\
    \ ftp in the netinfo\n      directory as interest-groups (that is, the path is:\n\
    \      netinfo/interest-groups).  It can also be obtained via electronic\n   \
    \   mail.  Send a message to mail-server@nisc.sri.com with the body of\n     \
    \ the message reading, \"Send netinfo/interest-groups\" and the file\n      will\
    \ be returned in moderate size pieces via electronic mail.\n   How do I contact\
    \ the administrator of a mailing list rather than\n   posting to the entire list?\n\
    \      For every mailing list mentioned in the \"interest-groups\" file, there\n\
    \      is a description of how to join the list or send other such\n      administrative\
    \ messages to the person in charge of the list.  In\n      general, however, it\
    \ is usually safe to assume that you can send a\n      message to an address in\
    \ the format of ListName-request@domain.  The\n      convention of having a parallel\
    \ mailbox conforming to the\n      \"-request\" format is very widely followed.\
    \  All administrative\n      messages regarding using, joining, or quitting the\
    \ list should be\n      sent to that mailbox instead of to the whole list so that\
    \ the readers\n      of the list don't have to read them.\n   What are some good\
    \ mailing lists or news groups?\n      The TCP-IP, IETF, and RFC Distribution\
    \ lists are primary lists for new\n      Internet users who desire further information\
    \ about current and\n      emerging developments in the Internet.  The first two\
    \ lists are\n      unmoderated discussion lists, and the latter is an announcement\n\
    \      service used by the RFC Editor.\n   How do I subscribe to the TCP-IP mailing\
    \ list?\n      To be added to the TCP-IP mailing list, send a message to:\n  \
    \          TCP-IP-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL\n   How do I subscribe to the IETF mailing\
    \ list?\n      To be added to the IETF mailing list, send a message to:\n    \
    \        IETF-REQUEST@ISI.EDU\n   How do I subscribe to the RFC Distribution list?\n\
    \      To be added to the RFC Distribution list, send a message to:\n        \

    \ In many electronic mail messages, it is sometimes useful to\n      indicate\

    \ series may be on\n           essentially any topic related to computer communication,\
    \ and\n           may be anything from a meeting report to the specification of\n\
    \           a standard.\n   RIP     Routing Interchange Protocol\n           One\
    \ protocol which may be used on internets simply to pass\n           routing information\
    \ between gateways.   It is used on may\n           LANs and on some of the NSFNET\
    \ intermediate level networks.\n   RJE     Remote Job Entry\n           The general\
    \ protocol for submitting batch jobs and\n           retrieving the results.\n\
    \   RLOGIN  Remote Login\n           A service on internets very similar to TELNET.\
    \   RLOGIN was\n           invented for use between Berkeley Unix systems on the\
    \ same\n           LAN at a time when TELNET programs didn't provide all the\n\
    \           services users wanted.   Berkeley plans to phase it out.\n   router\
    \  A special-purpose dedicated computer that attaches to\n           two or more\
    \ networks and routes packets from one\n           network to the other.  In particular,\
    \ an Internet\n           gateway routes IP datagrams among the networks it\n\
    \           connects.  Gateways route packets to other\n           gateways until\
    \ they can be delivered to the final\n           destination directly across one\
    \ physical network.\n   RPC     Remote Procedure Call\n           An easy and\
    \ popular paradigm for implementing the\n           client-server model of distributed\
    \ computing.\n   server  A computer that shares its resources, such as printers\n\
    \           and files, with other computers on the network.  An\n           example\
    \ of this is a Network Files System (NFS)\n           Server which shares its\
    \ disk space with one or more\n           workstations that may not have local\
    \ disk drives of\n           their own.\n   SLIP    Serial Line Internet Protocol\n\
    \           SLIP is currently a defacto standard, commonly used for\n        \
    \   point-to-point serial connections running TCP/IP.  It is\n           not an\
    \ Internet standard but is defined in RFC 1055.\n   SMTP    Simple Mail Transfer\
    \ Protocol\n           The Internet standard protocol for transferring\n     \
    \      electronic mail messages from one computer to another.\n           SMTP\
    \ specifies how two mail systems interact and the\n           format of control\
    \ messages they exchange to transfer mail.\n   SNA     System Network Architecture\n\
    \           IBM's data communications protocol.\n   SNMP    Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol\n           The Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1157) is the\n\
    \           Internet's standard for remote monitoring and management\n       \
    \    of hosts, routers and other nodes and devices on a network.\n   subnet  A\
    \ portion of a network, which may be a physically independent\n           network,\
    \ which shares a network address with other portions\n           of the network\
    \ and is distinguished by a subnet number.  A\n           subnet is to a network\
    \ what a network is to an internet.\n   subnet number\n           A part of the\
    \ internet address which designates a subnet.\n           It is ignored for the\
    \ purposes internet routing, but is\n           used for intranet routing.\n \
    \  T1      A term for a digital carrier facility used to transmit a\n        \
    \   DS-1 formatted digital signal at 1.544 megabits per second.\n   T3      A\
    \ term for a digital carrier facility used to transmit a DS-3\n           formatted\
    \ digital signal at 44.746 megabits per second.\n   TCP     Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol\n           A transport layer protocol for the Internet.  It is a\n\
    \           connection oriented, stream protocol defined by RFC 793.\n   TCP/IP\
    \  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol\n           This is a common\
    \ shorthand which refers to the suite\n           of application and transport\
    \ protocols which run over IP.\n           These include FTP, TELNET, SMTP, and\
    \ UDP (a transport\n           layer protocol).\n   Telenet A public packet-switching\
    \ network operated by US Sprint.\n           Also known as \"SprintNet\".\n  \
    \ TELNET  The Internet standard protocol for remote terminal\n           connection\
    \ service.  TELNET allows a user at one site\n           to interact with a remote\
    \ timesharing system at\n           another site as if the user's terminal was\
    \ connected\n           directly to the remote computer.\n   THEnet  The Texas\
    \ Higher Education Network, a multiprotocol\n           network connecting most\
    \ major academic and research\n           institutions in the State of Texas,\
    \ as well as several\n           institutions in Mexico.\n   Token Ring\n    \
    \       A type of LAN.   Examples are IEEE 802.5, ProNET-10/80 and\n         \
    \  FDDI.  The term \"token ring\" is often used to denote 802.5\n   Tymnet  A\
    \ public character-switching/packet-switching network\n           operated by\
    \ British Telecom.\n   UDP     User Datagram Protocol\n           A transport\
    \ layer protocol for the Internet.  It is a\n           datagram protocol which\

    \ of\n           people and other Internet entities, such as domains,\n      \
    \     networks, and hosts, kept at the NIC.  The information for\n           people\
    \ shows a person's company name, address, phone number\n           and email address.\n\
    \   XNS     Xerox Network System\n           A data communications protocol suite\
    \ developed by Xerox.  It\n           uses Ethernet to move the data between computers.\n\
    \   X.25    A data communications interface specification developed to\n     \
    \      describe how data passes into and out of public data\n           communications\
    \ networks.  The public networks such as\n           Sprintnet and Tymnet use\
    \ X.25 to interface to customer\n           computers.\n"
