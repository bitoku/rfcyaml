  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3966 [2] defines a tel URI parameter \"isub\" that is\
    \ designed to\n   carry Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) subaddresses.\n\
    \   In an ISDN User Part (ISUP) message, a Network Service Access Point\n   (NSAP)\
    \ address [6] or a \"user specified\" address can be carried as an\n   ISDN subaddress.\
    \  The NSAP address accommodates various types of\n   address information along\
    \ with an identifier for the address type and\n   its encoding type.\n   The \"\
    isub\" parameter can carry any type of address, but RFC 3966 [2]\n   does not\
    \ define a solution to carry information on a subaddress type\n   (whether the\
    \ subaddress is NSAP or user specific) or an identifier\n   for the encoding type\
    \ used.\n   The most commonly used encoding type for the ISDN subaddress is an\n\
    \   International Alphabet 5 (IA5) [5].  RFC 3966 does state, \"ISDN\n   subaddresses\
    \ typically contain IA5 characters but may contain any\n   octet value\" considering\
    \ this fact.  Nevertheless, IA5 is just one of\n   the encoding types among various\
    \ encoding types used in the NSAP\n   address.  Therefore, \"isub\" parameter\
    \ alone is not sufficient to\n   describe ISDN subaddresses, and additional information\
    \ is needed.\n      Lack of information describing the encoding type of ISDN\n\
    \      subaddress will make it difficult for an ISDN terminal receiving\n    \
    \  the ISDN subaddress from the SIP network (SIP-ISDN\n      Interconnection)\
    \ to interpret the \"isub\" parameter value, as a\n      gateway may translate\
    \ it using a wrong encoding type and end up\n      with a wrong subaddress value\
    \ due to inconsistency in the encoding\n      type used.  It will also make it\
    \ difficult to recover the original\n      ISDN subaddress value when an ISUP\
    \ message is translated to a SIP\n      message and translated back to the ISUP\
    \ message (ISDN-SIP-ISDN\n      Interconnection).  As there is no placeholder\
    \ to carry the\n      encoding type in the SIP message, the encoding type information\n\
    \      that was present in the original ISUP message will be lost, and\n     \
    \ reconstructing the intended ISDN subaddress value is nearly\n      impossible.\n\
    \   To solve the issues presented, this specification defines an \"isub-\n   encoding\"\
    \ parameter to carry information describing whether the value\n   of the \"isub\"\
    \ parameter is an NSAP address as well as its encoding\n   type.  In addition,\
    \ this document specifies the accommodating values\n   to be carried in the \"\
    isub\" parameter for each encoding type used.\n"

    \ 2119 [1].\n"

  - "3.1.  SIP-ISDN Interconnection\n   The diagrams in Figure 1 show an issue that\
    \ will be observed when\n   interworking between SIP network and ISDN network\
    \ with an ISDN\n   subaddress.  When SIP equipment sends a request with an \"\
    isub\"\n   parameter to address an ISDN terminal behind Private Branch Exchange\n\
    \   (PBX), the encoding type of the ISDN subaddress currently cannot be\n   specified.\
    \  Therefore, gateway sitting between the SIP network and\n   ISDN network cannot\
    \ translate the value of \"isub\" into an ISUP\n   Initial Address Message (IAM)\
    \ properly as the encoding type\n   information of the ISDN subaddress is missing.\n\

  - "5.  Parameter Definition\n   The parameter defined in this document is represented\
    \ as a tel URI\n   parameter, which describes the encoding type information of\
    \ the ISDN\n   subaddress.  It is an optional parameter to tel URI to accommodate\n\
    \   some of the information lacking in the \"isub\" parameter defined in\n   RFC\
    \ 3966 [2].  The ABNF [3] syntax is as follows.\n   isub-encoding           =\
    \ isub-encoding-tag \"=\" isub-encoding-value\n   isub-encoding-tag       = \"\
    isub-encoding\"\n   isub-encoding-value     = \"nsap-ia5\" / \"nsap-bcd\" / \"\
    nsap\" / token\n   The semantics of these \"isub-encoding\" values are described\
    \ below:\n   nsap-ia5: Indication that the \"isub\" parameter value needs to be\n\
    \             encoded using IA5 (AFI=0x50) when translated to an ISUP\n      \
    \       message.\n   nsap-bcd: Indication that the \"isub\" parameter value needs\

    \             translated to an ISUP message.\n   nsap:     Indication that the\
    \ \"isub\" parameter value needs to be\n             encoded using the encoding\
    \ type defined in ISO 8348 [6]\n             other than IA5 (AFI=0x50) or BCD\
    \ (AFI=0x48).\n      Note: Q.931 [7] defines a \"user specified\" subaddress type,\
    \ but\n            this document does not specify any behavior or value for\n\
    \            \"user specified\" subaddress type.  Therefore, the \"user\n    \
    \        specified\" subaddress is beyond the scope of this document.\n   An example\
    \ of the syntax of the \"isub-encoding\" parameter (in a small\n   fragment of\

- title: 6.  Usage
  contents:
  - "6.  Usage\n   It is anticipated that a tel URI parameter defined in this document\n\
    \   will be used along with an \"isub\" parameter defined in RFC 3966 [2]\n  \
    \ when interworking between an ISUP network and a SIP network.  The URI\n   parameter\
    \ defined here is an optional parameter to the tel URI and is\n   useful only\
    \ when it's accompanying the \"isub\" parameter.\n   An ISDN subaddress information\
    \ element carried in the ISUP message\n   consists of a 3-octet header followed\
    \ by either an NSAP address or a\n   user-specified address.  The NSAP address\
    \ consists of an Initial\n   Domain Part (IDP) (Authority and Format Identifier\
    \ (AFI) and\n   conditionally Initial Domain Identifier (IDI)) that identifies\
    \ an\n   encoding type of the subaddress, and a Domain Specific Part (DSP)\n \
    \  that represents the subaddress value itself.\n   To find out more about the\
    \ ISDN subaddress information element and\n   the NSAP address including definition\
    \ of AFI, IDI, IDP, and DSP,\n   please refer to Appendices A and B.\n   If the\
    \ \"isub-encoding\" is absent, and a message is interpreted by an\n   entity on\
    \ the SIP network, the entity compliant to this specification\n   MUST assume\
    \ that the original ISDN subaddress in an ISUP message was\n   an NSAP address\
    \ with an encoding type of IA5 (AFI=0x50), of which the\n   DSP value was translated\
    \ and set to the \"isub\" parameter value, and\n   MUST handle the message accordingly.\n\
    \   If the \"isub-encoding\" is absent, and the message is handled by a\n   gateway\
    \ translating the SIP message to ISUP message, the gateway\n   compliant to this\
    \ specification MUST encode the value in the \"isub\"\n   parameter using IA5\
    \ (AFI=0x50) and set the encoded value into the DSP\n   part of the NSAP address\
    \ when translating the message into an ISUP\n   message.\n   If the value of \"\
    isub-encoding\" is set to \"nsap\", the encoding type\n   (AFI) is assumed to\
    \ be in the first two characters of the \"isub\"\n   parameter in hexadecimal\
    \ represented as US-ASCII characters 0-9 and\n   A-F.\n   If the ISDN subaddress\
    \ is not an NSAP address, the entity translating\n   the message SHOULD treat\
    \ the message as if neither the \"isub-\n   encoding\" nor the \"isub\" parameters\
    \ existed, unless it has a prior\n   knowledge of the encoding method used.\n\
    \   When an entity that is not compliant to this specification handles\n   the\
    \ message with the \"isub-encoding\" parameter, it would simply\n   ignore the\
    \ parameter and its value.\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Structure of NSAP Addresses
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Structure of NSAP Addresses\n   In ISUP messages, the ISDN subaddress\
    \ is generally represented as an\n   NSAP address.  The NSAP address is defined\
    \ as follows in ISO 8348\n   [6].\n   The NSAP address consists of an Initial\
    \ Domain Part (IDP) and a\n   Domain Specific Part (DSP).  The IDP consists of\
    \ two fields, an\n   Authority and Format Identifier (AFI) and an Initial Domain\n\
    \   Identifier (IDI).  The maximum length of an NSAP address is 20\n   octets.\n\

    \      Figure 4:  Structure of NSAP Addresses\n   The AFI value is 2 hexadecimal\
    \ digits (00-FF), and it identifies the\n   IDI format and the DSP syntax.\n \
    \  The IDI value when present is represented as decimal digits, and it\n   identifies\
    \ a network addressing domain or authority responsible for\n   allocating values\
    \ of the DSP.  The length of IDI varies and depends\n   on the value of AFI.\n\
    \   The typical encoding type of the ISDN subaddress, IA5, is identified\n   as\
    \ AFI=0x50.  When the AFI value is 0x50, the length of IDI is zero;\n   therefore,\
    \ the length of IDP is 2 digits (1 octet).  In this case,\n   the DSP value is\
    \ a subaddress encoded by IA5, and its maximum length\n   is 19 octets.  The length\
    \ of IDI is also zero when the encoding type\n   is BCD (AFI=0x48).  The NSAP\
    \ address for when the AFI value is set to\n   either 0x50 or 0x48 is shown below.\
    \  As shown, DSP starts from the\n   2nd octet of the NSAP address.\n        \
