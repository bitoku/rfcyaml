  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\n\
    \   community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any\n   kind.\
    \  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Unicode Standard, version 1.1, and ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E)\n\
    \   jointly define a 16 bit character set (hereafter referred to as\n   Unicode)\
    \ which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.\n   However, Internet\
    \ mail (STD 11, RFC 822) currently supports only 7-\n   bit US ASCII as a character\
    \ set. MIME (RFC 1521 and RFC 1522) extends\n   Internet mail to support different\
    \ media types and character sets,\n   and thus could support Unicode in mail messages.\
    \ MIME neither defines\n   Unicode as a permitted character set nor specifies\
    \ how it would be\n   encoded, although it does provide for the registration of\
    \ additional\n   character sets over time.\n   This document specifies the usage\
    \ of Unicode within MIME.\n"
- title: Motivation
  contents:
  - "Motivation\n   Since Unicode is starting to see widespread commercial adoption,\n\
    \   users will want a way to transmit information in this character set\n   in\
    \ mail messages and other Internet media. Since MIME was expressly\n   designed\
    \ to allow such extensions and is on the standards track for\n   the Internet,\
    \ it is the most appropriate means for encoding Unicode.\n   RFC 1521 and RFC\
    \ 1522 do not define Unicode as an allowed character\n   set, but allow registration\
    \ of additional character sets.\n   In addition to allowing use of Unicode within\
    \ MIME bodies, another\n   goal is to specify a way of using Unicode that allows\
    \ text which\n   consists largely, but not entirely, of US-ASCII characters to\
    \ be\n   represented in a way that can be read by mail clients who do not\n  \
    \ understand Unicode. This is in keeping with the philosophy of MIME.\n   Such\
    \ an encoding is described in another document, \"UTF-7: A Mail\n   Safe Transformation\
    \ Format of Unicode\" [UTF-7].\n"
- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   Several ways of using Unicode are possible. This document specifies\n\
    \   both guidelines for use of Unicode within MIME, and a specific usage.\n  \
    \ The usage specified in this document is a straightforward use of\n   Unicode\
    \ as specified in \"The Unicode Standard, Version 1.1\".\n   This encoding is\
    \ intended for situations where sender and recipient\n   do not want to do a lot\
    \ of processing, when the text does not consist\n   primarily of characters from\
    \ the US-ASCII character set, or when\n   sender and receiver are known in advance\
    \ to support Unicode.\n   Another encoding is intended for situations where the\
    \ text consists\n   primarily of US-ASCII, with occasional characters from other\
    \ parts of\n   Unicode. This encoding allows the US-ASCII portion to be read by\
    \ all\n   recipients without having to support Unicode. This encoding is\n   specified\
    \ in another document, \"UTF-7: A Mail Safe Transformation\n   Format of Unicode\"\
    \ [UTF-7].\n   Finally, in keeping with the principles set forth in RFC 1521,\
    \ text\n   which can be represented using the US-ASCII or ISO-8859-x character\n\
    \   sets should be so represented where possible, for maximum\n   interoperability.\n"
- title: Definitions
  contents:
  - "Definitions\n   The definition of character set Unicode:\n      The 16 bit character\
    \ set Unicode is defined by \"The Unicode\n      Standard, Version 1.1\". This\
    \ character set is identical with the\n      character repertoire and coding of\
    \ the international standard\n      ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E); Coded Representation\
    \ Form=UCS-2;\n      Subset=300; Implementation Level=3.\n      Note. Unicode\
    \ 1.1 further specifies the use and interaction of\n      these character codes\
    \ beyond the ISO standard. However, any valid\n      10646 BMP (Basic Multilingual\
    \ Plane) sequence is a valid Unicode\n      sequence, and vice versa; Unicode\
    \ supplies interpretations of\n      sequences on which the ISO standard is silent\
    \ as to\n      interpretation.\n      This character set is encoded as sequences\
    \ of octets, two per 16-\n      bit character, with the most significant octet\
    \ first. Text with an\n      odd number of octets is ill-formed.\n      Rationale.\
    \ ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E) specifies that when characters\n      in the UCS-2 form\
    \ are serialized as octets, that the most\n      significant octet appear first.\
    \  This is also in keeping with\n      common network practice of choosing a canonical\
    \ format for\n      transmission.\n"
- title: General Specification of Unicode Character Sets Within MIME
  contents:
  - "General Specification of Unicode Character Sets Within MIME\n   The Unicode Standard\
    \ is currently at version 1.1. Although new\n   versions should be compatible\
    \ with old implementations if an\n   implementation is compliant with the standard,\
    \ some implementations\n   may choose to check the version of the character set\
    \ that is being\n   used. In order to allow some implementations to check the\
    \ version\n   number and allow others to ignore it, all registrations of Unicode\n\
    \   variants and versions for MIME usage should have MIME charset names\n   which\
    \ conform to one of the two following patterns:\n      UNICODE-major-minor\n \
    \     UNICODE-major-minor-variant\n   Where major and minor are strings of decimal\
    \ digits (0 through 9)\n   specifying the major and minor version number of the\
    \ Unicode standard\n   to which the text in question conforms. In the interests\
    \ of\n   interoperability, the lowest version number compatible with the text\n\
    \   should be used. The lowest acceptable version number is UNICODE-1-1,\n   corresponding\
    \ to \"The Unicode Standard, Version 1.1\". The optional\n   trailing string \"\
    variant\" describes the particular transformation\n   format of Unicode that the\
    \ registration describes; its content is up\n   to the particular registration.\
    \ If there is no trailing variant\n   string, the charset name refers to the basic\
    \ two octet form of\n   Unicode as described in \"The Unicode Standard\".\n  \
    \ Example. A hypothetical charset which referred to the UTF-8\n   transformation\
    \ format of Unicode/10646 (also known as UTF-2 or UTF-\n   FSS) might be named\
    \ UNICODE-1-1-UTF-8.\n"
- title: Encoding Character Set Unicode Within MIME
  contents:
  - "Encoding Character Set Unicode Within MIME\n   Character set Unicode uses 16\
    \ bit characters, and therefore would\n   normally be used with the Binary or\
    \ Base64 content transfer encodings\n   of MIME. In header fields, it would normally\
    \ be used with the B\n   content transfer encoding. The MIME character set identifier\
    \ is\n   UNICODE-1-1.\n   Example. Here is a text portion of a MIME message containing\
    \ the\n   Japanese word \"nihongo\" (hexadecimal 65E5,672C,8A9E) written in Han\n\
    \   characters.\n   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UNICODE-1-1\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding:\
    \ base64\n   ZeVnLIqe\n   Example. Here is a text portion of a MIME message containing\
    \ the\n   Unicode sequence \"A<NOT IDENTICAL TO><ALPHA>.\" (hexadecimal\n   0041,2262,0391,002E)\n\
    \   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UNICODE-1-1\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding:\
