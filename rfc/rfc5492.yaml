- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base BGP-4 specification [RFC4271] requires that when\
    \ a BGP\n   speaker receives an OPEN message with one or more unrecognized\n \
    \  Optional Parameters, the speaker must terminate the BGP peering.\n   This complicates\
    \ the introduction of new capabilities in BGP.\n   This specification defines\
    \ an Optional Parameter and processing rules\n   that allow BGP speakers to communicate\
    \ capabilities in an OPEN\n   message.  A pair of BGP speakers that supports this\
    \ specification can\n   establish the peering even when presented with unrecognized\n\
    \   capabilities, so long as all capabilities required to support the\n   peering\
    \ are supported.\n"

- title: 3.  Overview of Operations
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview of Operations\n   When a BGP speaker [RFC4271] that supports capabilities\
    \ advertisement\n   sends an OPEN message to its BGP peer, the message MAY include\
    \ an\n   Optional Parameter, called Capabilities.  The parameter lists the\n \
    \  capabilities supported by the speaker.\n   A BGP speaker determines the capabilities\
    \ supported by its peer by\n   examining the list of capabilities present in the\
    \ Capabilities\n   Optional Parameter carried by the OPEN message that the speaker\n\
    \   receives from the peer.\n   A BGP speaker that supports a particular capability\
    \ may use this\n   capability with its peer after the speaker determines (as described\n\
    \   above) that the peer supports this capability.  Simply put, a given\n   capability\
    \ can be used on a peering if that capability has been\n   advertised by both\
    \ peers.  If either peer has not advertised it, the\n   capability cannot be used.\n\
    \   A BGP speaker determines that its peer doesn't support capabilities\n   advertisement\
    \ if, in response to an OPEN message that carries the\n   Capabilities Optional\
    \ Parameter, the speaker receives a NOTIFICATION\n   message with the Error Subcode\
    \ set to Unsupported Optional Parameter.\n   (This is a consequence of the base\
    \ BGP-4 specification [RFC4271] and\n   not a new requirement.)  In this case,\
    \ the speaker SHOULD attempt to\n   re-establish a BGP connection with the peer\
    \ without sending to the\n   peer the Capabilities Optional Parameter.\n   If\
    \ a BGP speaker that supports a certain capability determines that\n   its peer\
    \ doesn't support this capability, the speaker MAY send a\n   NOTIFICATION message\
    \ to the peer and terminate peering (see Section\n   \"Extensions to Error Handling\"\
    \ for more details).  For example, a BGP\n   speaker may need to terminate peering\
    \ if it established peering to\n   exchange IPv6 routes and determines that its\
    \ peer does not support\n   Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 [RFC4760].  The\
    \ Error Subcode in\n   the NOTIFICATION message is then set to Unsupported Capability.\
    \  The\n   message MUST contain the capability or capabilities that cause the\n\
    \   speaker to send the message.  The decision to send the message and\n   terminate\
    \ the peering is local to the speaker.  If terminated, such\n   peering SHOULD\
    \ NOT be re-established automatically.\n   If a BGP speaker receives from its\
    \ peer a capability that it does not\n   itself support or recognize, it MUST\
    \ ignore that capability.  In\n   particular, the Unsupported Capability NOTIFICATION\
    \ message MUST NOT\n   be generated and the BGP session MUST NOT be terminated\
    \ in response\n   to reception of a capability that is not supported by the local\n\
    \   speaker.\n"
- title: '4.  Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):'
  contents:
  - "4.  Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):\n   This is an Optional\
    \ Parameter that is used by a BGP speaker to convey\n   to its BGP peer the list\
    \ of capabilities supported by the speaker.\n   The encoding of BGP Optional Parameters\
    \ is specified in Section 4.2\n   of [RFC4271].  The parameter type of the Capabilities\
    \ Optional\n   Parameter is 2.\n   The parameter contains one or more triples\
    \ <Capability Code,\n   Capability Length, Capability Value>, where each triple\
    \ is encoded as\n   shown below:\n          +------------------------------+\n\
    \          | Capability Code (1 octet)    |\n          +------------------------------+\n\
    \          | Capability Length (1 octet)  |\n          +------------------------------+\n\
    \          | Capability Value (variable)  |\n          ~                     \
    \         ~\n          +------------------------------+\n   The use and meaning\
    \ of these fields are as follows:\n      Capability Code:\n         Capability\
    \ Code is a one-octet unsigned binary integer that\n         unambiguously identifies\
    \ individual capabilities.\n      Capability Length:\n         Capability Length\
    \ is a one-octet unsigned binary integer that\n         contains the length of\
    \ the Capability Value field in octets.\n      Capability Value:\n         Capability\
    \ Value is a variable-length field that is interpreted\n         according to\
    \ the value of the Capability Code field.\n   BGP speakers SHOULD NOT include\
    \ more than one instance of a\n   capability with the same Capability Code, Capability\
    \ Length, and\n   Capability Value.  Note, however, that processing of multiple\n\
    \   instances of such capability does not require special handling, as\n   additional\
    \ instances do not change the meaning of the announced\n   capability; thus, a\
    \ BGP speaker MUST be prepared to accept such\n   multiple instances.\n   BGP\
    \ speakers MAY include more than one instance of a capability (as\n   identified\
    \ by the Capability Code) with non-zero Capability Length\n   field, but with\
    \ different Capability Value and either the same or\n   different Capability Length.\
    \  Processing of these capability\n   instances is specific to the Capability\
    \ Code and MUST be described in\n   the document introducing the new capability.\n\
    \   The Capabilities Optional Parameter (OPEN Optional Parameter Type 2)\n   SHOULD\
    \ only be included in the OPEN message once.  If the BGP speaker\n   wishes to\
    \ include multiple capabilities in the OPEN message, it\n   SHOULD do so as discussed\
    \ above -- by listing all those capabilities\n   as TLVs within a single Capabilities\
    \ Optional Parameter.  However,\n   for backward compatibility, a BGP speaker\
    \ MUST be prepared to receive\n   an OPEN message that contains multiple Capabilities\
    \ Optional\n   Parameters, each of which contains one or more capabilities TLVs.\n\
    \   The set of capabilities should be processed in the same way in either\n  \
    \ case, whether it is enumerated within a single Capabilities Optional\n   Parameter\
    \ of the OPEN message or split across multiple Capabilities\n   Optional Parameters.\n"
- title: 5.  Extensions to Error Handling
  contents:
  - "5.  Extensions to Error Handling\n   This document defines a new Error Subcode,\
    \ Unsupported Capability.\n   The value of this Subcode is 7.  The Data field\
    \ in the NOTIFICATION\n   message MUST list the set of capabilities that causes\
    \ the speaker to\n   send the message.  Each such capability is encoded in the\
    \ same way as\n   it would be encoded in the OPEN message.\n   As explained in\
    \ the \"Overview of Operations\" section, the Unsupported\n   Capability NOTIFICATION\
    \ is a way for a BGP speaker to complain that\n   its peer does not support a\
    \ required capability without which the\n   peering cannot proceed.  It MUST NOT\
    \ be used when a BGP speaker\n   receives a capability that it does not understand;\
    \ such capabilities\n   MUST be ignored.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a Capability Optional Parameter\
    \ along with a\n   Capability Code field.  IANA maintains the registry for Capability\n\
    \   Code values.  Capability Code value 0 is reserved.  Capability Code\n   values\
    \ 1 through 63 are to be assigned by IANA using the \"IETF\n   Review\" policy\
    \ defined in [RFC5226].  Capability Code values 64\n   through 127 are to be assigned\
    \ by IANA using the \"First Come First\n   Served\" policy defined in [RFC5226].\
    \  Capability Code values 128\n   through 255 are for \"Private Use\" as defined\
    \ in [RFC5226].\n   IANA created and maintains a registry for OPEN message Optional\n\
    \   Parameters called \"BGP OPEN Optional Parameter Types\".  Optional\n   Parameters\
    \ are identified by the Parameter Type, which is a one-octet\n   unsigned integer.\
    \  Values (0 reserved, 1-255) are to be allocated\n   according to the \"IETF\
    \ Review\" policy as defined in [RFC5226].\n   The registry has been populated\
    \ with the two Parameter Type codes\n   that are currently defined:\n   o  Parameter\
    \ Type 1: Authentication (deprecated) [RFC4271] [RFC5492]\n   o  Parameter Type\
