  - "                  Single access to Standard Protocols\nIsn't the idea of a single\
    \ access protocol simple enough that one could\nbe specified, and a socket reserved\
    \ for it, before the proposed mail\nprotocol becomes official?  The result would\
    \ be that MP could be the\nfirst protocol implemented under UULP (or whatever\
    \ it is to be called),\nand the other protocols could be \"moved\" as soon as\
    \ any problems in the\nofficial specifications could be worked out, and at the\
    \ convenience of\nimplementors.\nThe single access protocol might have the following\
    \ commands:\n    USER\n    PASS\n    ACCT\n    MAIL\n    FTP\n    RJS\n    DRS\
    \ (?)\n    HELP (?)\n    BYE\nfollowing Jim White's idea of nested command and\
    \ reply spaces.\nThis doesn't address the question of \"what is free\", or of\
    \ the\ninterrelationships between the various protocols, but it doesn't make\n\
    those problem any worse, only a little different.\n       [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by\
    \ Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.     \
    \       10/99 ]\n"
