- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of\n\
    \   encapsulating network-layer protocol information over point-to-point\n   links.\
    \  PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and\n   proposes a family\
    \ of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for\n   establishing and configuring different\
    \ network-layer protocols.\n   The IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP), which is an\
    \ NCP for a PPP link,\n   allows for the negotiation of desirable parameters for\
    \ an IPv6\n   interface over PPP.\n   This document defines the IPv6 datagram\
    \ compression option that can\n   be negotiated by a node on the link through\
    \ the IPV6CP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP [1] has three main components:\n      1) A method for\
    \ encapsulating datagrams over serial links.\n      2) A Link Control Protocol\
    \ (LCP) for establishing, configuring,\n         and testing the data-link connection.\n\
    \      3) A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing\n    \
    \     and configuring different network-layer protocols.\n   In order to establish\
    \ communications over a point-to-point link, each\n   end of the PPP link must\
    \ first send LCP packets to configure and test\n   the data link.  After the link\
    \ has been established and optional\n   facilities have been negotiated as needed\
    \ by the LCP, PPP must send\n   NCP packets to choose and configure one or more\
    \ network-layer\n   protocols.  Once each of the chosen network-layer protocols\
    \ has been\n   configured, datagrams from each network-layer protocol can be sent\n\
    \   over the link.  The link will remain configured for communications\n   until\
    \ explicit LCP or NCP packets close the link down, or until some\n   external\
    \ event occurs (power failure at the other end, carrier drop,\n   etc.).\n   In\
    \ the IPv6 over PPP specification [2], the NCP, or IPV6CP, for\n   establishing\
    \ and configuring IPv6 over PPP is defined.  The same\n   specification defines\
    \ the Interface Identifier parameter, which can\n   be used to generate link-local\
    \ and globally unique IPv6 addresses,\n   for negotiation.\n   In this specification,\
    \ the compression parameter for use in IPv6\n   datagram compression is defined.\
    \  Together with RFC 5072 [2], this\n   document obsoletes RFC 2472 [13].  However,\
    \ no protocol changes have\n   been introduced over RFC 2472.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [3].\n"
- title: 2.  IPV6CP Configuration Options
  contents:
  - "2.  IPV6CP Configuration Options\n   IPV6CP Configuration Options allow negotiation\
    \ of desirable IPv6\n   parameters.  IPV6CP uses the same Configuration Option\
    \ format as\n   defined for LCP [1] but with a separate set of Options.  If a\n\
    \   Configuration Option is not included in a Configure-Request packet,\n   the\
    \ default value for that Configuration Option is assumed.\n   The only IPV6CP\
    \ option defined in this document is the IPv6-\n   Compression-Protocol.  The\
    \ Type field for this IPV6CP Option is as\n   follows:\n            2 IPv6-Compression-Protocol\n\
    \   Note that the up-to-date values of the IPV6CP Option Type field are\n   specified\
    \ in the on-line database of \"Assigned Numbers\" maintained by\n   IANA [7].\n"
- title: 2.1.  IPv6-Compression-Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPv6-Compression-Protocol\n   This Configuration Option provides a way\
    \ to negotiate the use of a\n   specific IPv6 packet compression protocol.  The\
    \ IPv6-Compression-\n   Protocol Configuration Option is used to indicate the\
    \ ability to\n   receive compressed packets.  Each end of the link MUST separately\n\
    \   request this option if bidirectional compression is desired.  By\n   default,\
    \ compression is not enabled.\n   IPv6 compression negotiated with this option\
    \ is specific to IPv6\n   datagrams and is not to be confused with compression\
    \ resulting from a\n   compression method negotiated via the PPP Compression Control\n\
    \   Protocol (CCP) [12], which potentially affects all datagrams.\n   A summary\
    \ of the IPv6-Compression-Protocol Configuration Option\n   format is shown below.\

    \ of this option) is to have\n   no IPv6 compression protocol enabled.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Lack of proper link security, such as authentication,\
    \ prior to data\n   transfers may enable man-in-the middle attacks resulting in\
    \ the loss\n   of data integrity and confidentiality.  The mechanisms that are\n\
    \   appropriate for ensuring PPP link security are addressed below\n   together\
    \ with the reference to a generic threat model.\n   The mechanisms that are appropriate\
    \ for ensuring PPP link security\n   are: 1) Access Control Lists that apply filters\
    \ on traffic received\n   over the link for enforcing admission policy, 2) an\
    \ authentication\n   protocol that facilitates negotiations between peers [8]\
    \ to select an\n   authentication method (e.g., MD5 [9]) for validation of the\
    \ peer, and\n   3) an encryption control protocol that facilitates negotiations\n\
    \   between peers to select encryption algorithms (or crypto-suites) to\n   ensure\
    \ data confidentiality [10]).\n   There are certain threats associated with peer\
    \ interactions on a PPP\n   link even with one or more of the above security measures\
    \ in place.\n   For instance, using the MD5 authentication method [9] exposes\
    \ one to\n   replay attacks, in which an attacker could intercept and replay a\n\
    \   station's identity and password hash to get access to a network.  The\n  \
    \ user of this specification is advised to refer to [8], which presents\n   a\
    \ generic threat model, for an understanding of the threats posed to\n   the security\
    \ of a link.  The reference [8] also gives a framework to\n   specify requirements\
    \ for the selection of an authentication method\n   for a given application.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   No specific action is needed for the assignment of\
    \ a value for the\n   Type field of IPv6 datagram compression option specified\
    \ in this\n   specification.  The current assignment is up-to-date in the registry\n\
    \   \"PPP IPV6CP CONFIGURATION OPTIONS\" for item IPv6-Compression-Protocol\n\
    \   (2) at [7].  However, the RFC reference for that item has been\n   changed\
    \ to 5172.\n   No action is needed either for the assignment of the IPV6-\n  \
    \ Compression-Protocol values, as such values have already been defined\n   by\
    \ other documents listed in Section 2.1.  Values for this field are\n   always\
    \ the same as the PPP Data Link Layer Protocol field values for\n   that same\
    \ compression protocol.  As a result, future allocation of\n   these values is\
    \ governed by RFC 3818 [11] that requires IETF\n   Consensus.  Current values\
    \ are in the registry \"IPv6-Compression-\n   Protocol Types\".  However, the\
    \ RFC reference for that registry has\n   been changed to 5172.\n"
- title: 5.  Management Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Management Considerations\n   From an operational point of view, the status\
    \ of the negotiation and\n   the compression algorithm on the link should be observable\
    \ by an\n   operator managing a network.  There is no standard management\n  \
    \ interface that covers this at the time of the writing of this\n   specification.\n"
