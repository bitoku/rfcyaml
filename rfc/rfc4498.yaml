- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   For the purpose of management, it is necessary to access Managed\n\
    \   Objects (MOs).  The SNMP framework provides a mechanism for naming\n   and\
    \ describing managed objects.  These objects are accessed via a\n   virtual information\
    \ store termed a Management Information Base (MIB).\n   MIBs have been defined\
    \ by equipment, protocol, and application\n   developers to provide management\
    \ access to the managed entities.  We\n   will call the MOs defined in these MIBs\
    \ simple MOs (SMO).  Management\n   applications will access one or more instances\
    \ of these SMOs, one or\n   more times, to monitor the target entity.\n   There\
    \ is a cost associated with accessing MOs.  The cost is the\n   network bandwidth\
    \ and the packet header processing overhead at the\n   command generator (manager)\
    \ and the command responder (agent).  This\n   cost constrains the number of MO\
    \ instances that can be polled and the\n   interval at which polling can be carried\
    \ out.\n   The overhead reduction can be carried out by reducing the number of\n\
    \   query-response packets.  This will reduce the packet processing\n   overhead,\
    \ and to some extent, the bandwidth.\n   The payloads in a typical SNMP \"get\"\
    \ packet and the corresponding\n   response are as shown in Figure 1.  In this\
    \ example, polling is\n   carried out for 'n' Managed Object instances OID1, OID2,\
    \ ..., OIDn.\n   It is obvious that a substantial amount of the payload in an\
    \ SNMP\n   packet consists of the OIDs.\n"
- title: '3.  MO Aggregation: The Concept'
  contents:
  - "3.  MO Aggregation: The Concept\n   In this document, a mechanism of MO aggregation\
    \ for payload\n   compression is defined.  The idea is simple: we introduce the\
    \ concept\n   of an Aggregate MO (AgMO).  An AgMO is just another MO as far as\
    \ the\n   SNMP protocol is concerned.  No new protocol operations will be\n  \
    \ required to handle these MOs.  As in the case of any other MO, it\n   requires\
    \ additional instrumentation at the command responder (agent)\n   and at the (command\
    \ generator) manager.  In this mechanism, the user\n   defines an Aggregate MO\
    \ (AgMO) corresponding to one or more\n   (predefined) MO instances.  Semantically,\
    \ the value of an AgMO\n   instance will be equivalent to the concatenation of\
    \ the values of the\n   corresponding MO instances.  The order of the concatenation\
    \ will be\n   determined by the order in which the MO instances are specified\
    \ in\n   the AgMO definition.  With the definitions done, the user can, as and\n\
    \   when the necessity arises, do an SNMP 'get' on instances of the AgMO\n   to\
    \ fetch the value of the constituent MO instances.  There is\n   substantial savings\
    \ on bandwidth, as only one instance object\n   identifier is carried in the request\
    \ and the response.  In the normal\n   case, instance object identifiers for each\
    \ of the constituent MO\n   instances would be carried in the requests and the\
    \ responses.  This\n   is the basic concept of Aggregate Managed Objects.  For\
    \ every AgMO,\n   an ErrorStatus Managed Object is defined.  This MO indicates\
    \ errors,\n   if any, that have been encountered while fetching the values of\
    \ the\n   constituent MO instances.  The error indication is comprised of the\n\
    \   index of the MO instance and the corresponding error.  If there are\n   no\
    \ errors, the ErrorStatus Managed Object instance will have a null\n   value.\
    \  This is the basic concept of Aggregate Managed Objects.\n   The concepts are\
    \ explained in Figure 2.  An aggregate managed object,\n   AgMOx, has been defined\
    \ for the MO instances MOI1, ... MOIn.  The\n   value of an instance of AgMOx\
    \ will be a concatenation of the values\n   of MOI1, ... MOIn, in that order.\n\

    \                     Figure 2.  MO aggregation\n   As a further refinement of\
    \ the AgMO, we introduce the Time-Based\n   Aggregated Managed Object (TAgMO).\
    \  The TAgMO is an MO that\n   represents the values of a user-specified MO instance\
    \ sampled at\n   user-specified intervals for a user-specified number of times.\
    \  In\n   this case, the user defines a TAgMO by specifying the MO instance\n\
    \   that needs to be sampled, the sampling interval, and the desired\n   number\
    \ of samples that will be included in one TAgMO.  The value of a\n   TAgMO instance\
    \ will include the timestamp (sysUpTime) at which the\n   first sample was taken.\
    \  The start time is not specified when the\n   TAgMO is defined.  Implementations\
    \ may choose to align the start time\n   with the appropriate time boundaries\
    \ (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours).\n   With the definitions, the user can do an\
    \ SNMP \"get\" on an instance of\n   the TAgMO to fetch the values of the constituent\
    \ MO instance sampled\n   at the specified intervals.  This is the concept of\
    \ Time-Based\n   aggregation.\n   Polling for 'n' samples of an MO Instance [MOI]\

- title: 4.  The Requirements for Managed Object Aggregation
  contents:
  - "4.  The Requirements for Managed Object Aggregation\n   The general requirements\
    \ of managed object aggregation are as\n   follows:\n      o It should lead to\
    \ fewer packets.\n      o It should lead to less bandwidth consumption.\n    \
    \  o It should not lead to loss of information.\n   In the case of Time-Based\
    \ aggregation, there will be a delay involved\n   in getting the actual data.\
    \  The minimum delay in this case will be\n   the duration of the aggregation.\n\
    \   The manager application is expected to configure AgMOs (Aggregate\n   MOs)\
    \ and TAgMOs (Time-Based Aggregate MOs) with care so that the\n   response size\
    \ is not too large.  In case the resultant response size\n   is larger than the\
    \ maximum acceptable message size of the originator\n   or larger than the local\
    \ maximum message size, then the error-status\n   field will be set to \"tooBig\"\
    .\n   Note that an aggregate MO can be defined only when all the\n   constituent\
    \ MO instances of interest are known.  This scheme cannot\n   be employed if a\
    \ manager/application does not know the specific MO\n   instances (of interest)\
    \ that are serviced by the management target.\n   In such cases, the application\
    \ may \"discover\" the MO instances of\n   interest by some means, e.g., by \"\
    walking\" through the MIB tree on\n   the agent.  According to the results of\
    \ the \"walk\", the application\n   can define an appropriate aggregate MO that\
    \ will serve the purpose.\n   Considering the cost involved in this exercise,\
    \ this method is\n   recommended only if the aggregate MO will be used repeatedly,\
    \ so that\n   the benefits of aggregation outweigh the costs of configuration.\n"
- title: 5.  MIB Design
  contents:
  - "5.  MIB Design\n   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as\
    \ possible\n   and at the same time to make it flexible enough that a large number\n\
    \   of users and applications can use the MIB to configure aggregate MOs\n   conveniently.\n\
    \   Two separate MIB modules have been defined.  The AggrMIB supports the\n  \
    \ aggregation of independent MO instances, while TAggrMIB supports the\n   aggregation\
    \ of several samples of the same MO instance.  Both of\n   these MIB modules use\
    \ the textual conventions defined in RMON-MIB\n   [RFC2819] and SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB\
    \ [RFC3411].\n   The AggrMIB is comprised of three tables, described below.\n\
    \   -  The aggrCtlTable controls the aggregation process.  Each row in\n     \
    \ this table defines the attributes of the aggregate object defined\n      in\
    \ the aggrMOTable.\n   -  The aggrMOTable defines the primary MO-based aggregation,\
    \ i.e.,\n      the MOs that will be aggregated.\n   -  The aggrDataTable contains\
    \ the details of the aggregated object.\n   The TAggrMIB is comprised of two tables\
    \ described below.\n   -  The tAggrCtlTable controls the aggregation process.\
    \  Each row in\n      this table defines the attributes of the aggregate object\
    \ defined\n      in the aggrMOTable.\n   -  The tAggrDataTable contains the details\
    \ of the aggregated object.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are management objects in the MIB modules\
    \ defined in this\n   document that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create. \
    \ Such objects\n   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  The objects and corresponding vulnerabilities\n   are discussed below.\n  \
    \ The following MOs are used to configure an agent that implements the\n   aggregate\
    \ MIB modules.\n         aggrCtlMOIndex,\n         aggrCtlMODescr,\n         aggrCtlCompressionAlgorithm,\n\
    \         aggrCtlEntryOwner,\n         aggrCtlEntryStorageType,\n         aggrCtlEntryStatus,\n\
    \         aggrMOInstance,\n         aggrMODescr,\n         aggrMOEntryStorageType,\n\
    \         aggrMOEntryStatus,\n         tAggrCtlMOInstance,\n         tAggrCtlAgMODescr,\n\
    \         tAggrCtlInterval,\n         tAggrCtlSamples,\n         tAggrCtlCompressionAlgorithm,\n\
    \         tAggrCtlEntryOwner,\n         tAggrCtlEntryStorageType,\n         tAggrCtlEntryStatus,\n\
    \   Access to these objects may be abused to affect the operation of the\n   data\
    \ collection system.  In particular,\n      -  by changing the value of an instance\
    \ of aggrCtlEntryStatus,\n         tAggrCtlEntryStatus, aggrMOEntryStatus, or\
    \ tAggrMOEntryStatus\n         to 'notInService' or 'destroy', the data aggregation\
    \ operation\n         for the corresponding entry will become unavailable to the\n\
    \         management system.\n      -  by changing the value of an instance of\
    \ aggrMOInstance or\n         tAggrCtlMOInstance, the data aggregation operation\
    \ may be\n         subverted.  This may result in wrong information being fed\
    \ to\n         the management system.\n      -  by adding several rows in the\
    \ aggrMOTable corresponding to an\n         aggregate MO, it is possible to make\
    \ the value of the aggregate\n         MOs very large.  A similar effect may be\
    \ achieved by\n         manipulating the value of the tAggrCtlSamples instance\n\
    \         corresponding to a Time-Based aggregate MO.  This could result\n   \
    \      in very heavy management traffic and/or fragmentation of\n         response\
    \ packets.  In some cases the responder may refuse to\n         send the data\
    \ and will simply respond with an error message\n         indicating that the\
    \ response packet size is too big.\n   An entity attempting to access an instance\
    \ of an aggregated MO MUST\n   have access rights to all the component instance\
    \ objects and the\n   aggregate MO instance.  An implementation MUST follow this\n\
    \   requirement.  Lax adherence to this requirement will breach the\n   security\
    \ model and make the system vulnerable to illegal accesses.\n   SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   there is no control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
