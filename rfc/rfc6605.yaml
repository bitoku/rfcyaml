- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and\
    \ 4035\n   ([RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035]), uses cryptographic keys and\n\
    \   digital signatures to provide authentication of DNS data.  Currently,\n  \
    \ the most popular signature algorithm is RSA with SHA-1, using keys\n   that\
    \ are 1024 or 2048 bits long.\n   This document defines the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource\
    \ records (RRs) of\n   two new signing algorithms: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve DSA)\
    \ with curve\n   P-256 and SHA-256, and ECDSA with curve P-384 and SHA-384.  (A\n\
    \   description of ECDSA can be found in [FIPS-186-3].)  This document\n   also\
    \ defines the DS RR for the SHA-384 one-way hash algorithm; the\n   associated\
    \ DS RR for SHA-256 is already defined in RFC 4509\n   [RFC4509].  [RFC6090] provides\
    \ a good introduction to implementing\n   ECDSA.\n   Current estimates are that\
    \ ECDSA with curve P-256 has an approximate\n   equivalent strength to RSA with\
    \ 3072-bit keys.  Using ECDSA with\n   curve P-256 in DNSSEC has some advantages\
    \ and disadvantages relative\n   to using RSA with SHA-256 and with 3072-bit keys.\
    \  ECDSA keys are\n   much shorter than RSA keys; at this size, the difference\
    \ is 256\n   versus 3072 bits.  Similarly, ECDSA signatures are much shorter than\n\
    \   RSA signatures.  This is relevant because DNSSEC stores and transmits\n  \
    \ both keys and signatures.\n   In the two signing algorithms defined in this\
    \ document, the size of\n   the key for the elliptic curve is matched with the\
    \ size of the output\n   of the hash algorithm.  This design is based on the widespread\
    \ belief\n   that the equivalent strength of P-256 and P-384 is half the length\
    \ of\n   the key, and also that the equivalent strength of SHA-256 and SHA-384\n\
    \   is half the length of the key.  Using matched strengths prevents an\n   attacker\
    \ from choosing the weaker half of a signature algorithm.  For\n   example, in\
    \ a signature that uses RSA with 2048-bit keys and SHA-256,\n   the signing portion\
    \ is significantly weaker than the hash portion,\n   whereas the two algorithms\
    \ here are balanced.\n   Signing with ECDSA is significantly faster than with\
    \ RSA (over 20\n   times in some implementations).  However, validating RSA signatures\n\
    \   is significantly faster than validating ECDSA signatures (about 5\n   times\
    \ faster in some implementations).\n   Some of the material in this document is\
    \ copied liberally from RFC\n   6460 [RFC6460].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  SHA-384 DS Records\n   SHA-384 is defined in FIPS 180-3 [FIPS-180-3] and\
    \ RFC 6234 [RFC6234],\n   and is similar to SHA-256 in many ways.  The implementation\
    \ of SHA-\n   384 in DNSSEC follows the implementation of SHA-256 as specified\
    \ in\n   RFC 4509 except that the underlying algorithm is SHA-384, the digest\n\
    \   value is 48 bytes long, and the digest type code is 4.\n"

  - "3.  ECDSA Parameters\n   Verifying ECDSA signatures requires agreement between\
    \ the signer and\n   the verifier of the parameters used.  FIPS 186-3 [FIPS-186-3]\
    \ lists\n   some NIST-recommended elliptic curves.  (Other documents give more\n\
    \   detail on ECDSA than is given in FIPS 186-3.)  These are the same\n   curves\
    \ listed in RFC 5114 [RFC5114].  The curves used in this\n   document are:\n \

- title: 4.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for ECDSA
  contents:
  - "4.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for ECDSA\n   ECDSA public keys consist\
    \ of a single value, called \"Q\" in FIPS\n   186-3.  In DNSSEC keys, Q is a simple\
    \ bit string that represents the\n   uncompressed form of a curve point, \"x |\
    \ y\".\n   The ECDSA signature is the combination of two non-negative integers,\n\
    \   called \"r\" and \"s\" in FIPS 186-3.  The two integers, each of which is\n\
    \   formatted as a simple octet string, are combined into a single longer\n  \
    \ octet string for DNSSEC as the concatenation \"r | s\".  (Conversion of\n  \
    \ the integers to bit strings is described in Section C.2 of FIPS\n   186-3.)\
    \  For P-256, each integer MUST be encoded as 32 octets; for\n   P-384, each integer\
    \ MUST be encoded as 48 octets.\n   The algorithm numbers associated with the\
    \ DNSKEY and RRSIG resource\n   records are fully defined in the IANA Considerations\
    \ section.  They\n   are:\n   o  DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs signifying ECDSA with the\
    \ P-256 curve and\n      SHA-256 use the algorithm number 13.\n   o  DNSKEY and\
    \ RRSIG RRs signifying ECDSA with the P-384 curve and\n      SHA-384 use the algorithm\
    \ number 14.\n   Conformant implementations that create records to be put into\
    \ the DNS\n   MUST implement signing and verification for both of the above\n\
    \   algorithms.  Conformant DNSSEC verifiers MUST implement verification\n   for\
    \ both of the above algorithms.\n"
- title: 5.  Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence
  contents:
  - "5.  Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence\n   RFC 5155 [RFC5155] defines new\
    \ algorithm identifiers for existing\n   signing algorithms to indicate that zones\
    \ signed with these algorithm\n   identifiers can use NSEC3 as well as NSEC records\
    \ to provide denial\n   of existence.  That mechanism was chosen to protect implementations\n\
    \   predating RFC 5155 from encountering resource records they could not\n   know\
    \ about.  This document does not define such algorithm aliases.\n   A DNSSEC validator\
    \ that implements the signing algorithms defined in\n   this document MUST be\
    \ able to validate negative answers in the form\n   of both NSEC and NSEC3 with\
    \ hash algorithm 1, as defined in RFC 5155.\n   An authoritative server that does\
    \ not implement NSEC3 MAY still serve\n   zones that use the signing algorithms\
    \ defined in this document with\n   NSEC denial of existence.\n"
