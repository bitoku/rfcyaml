  - "2.  OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA\n   The OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA
    is used to advertise additional\n   prefix attributes.  Opaque LSAs are described
    in [OPAQUE].\n   Multiple OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs can be advertised
    by an\n   OSPFv2 router.  The flooding scope of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix\n   Opaque
    LSA depends on the scope of the advertised prefixes and is\n   under the control
    of the advertising router.  In some cases (e.g.,\n   mapping server deployment
    [SEGMENT-ROUTING]), the LSA flooding scope\n   may be greater than the scope of
    the corresponding prefixes.\n   The format of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque
    LSA is as follows:\n       0                   1                   2                   3\n

    Opaque LSA\n   The Opaque Type used by the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is
    7.\n   The Opaque Type is used to differentiate the various types of OSPFv2\n
    \  Opaque LSAs and is described in Section 3 of [OPAQUE].  The LS Type\n   may
    be 10 or 11, indicating that the Opaque LSA flooding scope is\n   area-local (10)
    or AS-wide (11) [OPAQUE].  The LSA Length field\n   [OSPFV2] represents the total
    length (in octets) of the Opaque LSA,\n   including the LSA header and all TLVs
    (including padding).\n   The Opaque ID field is an arbitrary value used to maintain
    multiple\n   OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs.  For OSPFv2 Extended Prefix\n
    \  Opaque LSAs, the Opaque ID has no semantic significance other than to\n   differentiate
    OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs originated by the\n   same OSPFv2 router.  If
    multiple OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs\n   include the same prefix, the attributes
    from the Opaque LSA with the\n   lowest Opaque ID SHOULD be used.\n   The format
    of the TLVs within the body of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix\n   Opaque LSA is the
    same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering\n   Extensions to OSPFv2 [TE].
    \ The variable TLV section consists of one\n   or more nested TLV tuples.  Nested
    TLVs are also referred to as sub-\n   TLVs.  The format of each TLV is:\n       0
    \                  1                   2                   3\n       0 1 2 3 4

    \                               TLV Format\n   The Length field defines the length
    of the value portion in octets\n   (thus, a TLV with no value portion would have
    a length of 0).  The\n   TLV is padded to 4-octet alignment; padding is not included
    in the\n   Length field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the\n
    \  total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also\n   32-bit
    aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the Length\n   field set to 1,
    and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of\n   the value portion of
    the TLV.  The padding is composed of zeros.\n"

      inside the OSPFv2 External Prefix\n      TLV applies to the prefix regardless
      of prefix's route type.  This\n      is useful when prefix-specific attributes
      are advertised by an\n      external entity that is not aware of the route type
      associated\n      with the prefix.  Supported types are:\n         0 - Unspecified\n
      \        1 - Intra-Area\n         3 - Inter-Area\n         5 - Autonomous System
      (AS) External\n         7 - Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) External\n      These
      route types correspond directly to the OSPFv2 LSAs types as\n      defined in
      the \"OSPFv2 Link State (LS) Type\" registry in\n      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ospfv2-parameters>.\n

      for the prefix.  Currently, the only supported\n      value is 0 for IPv4 unicast.
      \ The inclusion of address family in\n      this TLV allows for future extension.\n
      \  Flags\n      This one-octet field contains flags applicable to the prefix.\n
      \     Supported Flags include:\n         0x80 - A-Flag (Attach Flag): An Area
      Border Router (ABR)\n         generating an OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV for an
      inter-area\n         prefix that is locally connected or attached in another\n
      \        connected area SHOULD set this flag.\n         0x40 - N-Flag (Node
      Flag): Set when the prefix identifies the\n         advertising router, i.e.,
      the prefix is a host prefix\n         advertising a globally reachable address
      typically associated\n         with a loopback address.  The advertising router
      MAY choose to\n         not set this flag even when the above conditions are
      met.  If\n         the flag is set and the prefix length is not a host prefix,\n
      \        then the flag MUST be ignored.  The flag is preserved when the\n         OSPFv2
      Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is propagated between areas.\n   Address Prefix\n
      \     For the address family IPv4 unicast, the prefix itself is encoded\n      as
      a 32-bit value.  The default route is represented by a prefix\n      of length
      0.  Prefix encoding for other address families is beyond\n      the scope of
      this specification.\n   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same
      prefix in the\n   same OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA, only the first instance
      of\n   the TLV is used by receiving OSPFv2 routers.  This situation SHOULD\n
      \  be logged as an error.\n   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the
      same prefix in\n   different OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs originated by
      the same\n   OSPFv2 router, the OSPFv2 advertising router is re-originating
      OSPFv2\n   Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs for multiple prefixes and is most likely\n
      \  repacking Extended-Prefix-TLVs in OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs.\n   In
      this case, the Extended-Prefix-TLV in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix\n   Opaque
      LSA with the smallest Opaque ID is used by receiving OSPFv2\n   routers.  This
      situation may be logged as a warning.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv2 routers
      advertising OSPFv2 Extended\n   Prefix TLVs in different OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
      Opaque LSAs\n   re-originate these LSAs in ascending order of Opaque ID to minimize\n
      \  the disruption.\n   If this TLV is advertised multiple times for the same
      prefix in\n   different OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSAs originated by different\n
      \  OSPFv2 routers, the application using the information is required to\n   determine
      which OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque LSA is used.  For\n   example, the application
      could prefer the LSA providing the best path\n   to the prefix.\n   This document
      creates a registry for OSPFv2 Extended Prefix sub-TLVs\n   in Section 6.\n"

      advertise various attributes\n   of the link.  It describes a single link and

      \     Specification of link types other than those defined will prevent\n      correlation

      Data\n      Link Data is defined in Section A.4.2 of [OSPFV2].\n   If this TLV
      is advertised multiple times in the same OSPFv2 Extended\n   Link Opaque LSA,
      only the first instance of the TLV is used by\n   receiving OSPFv2 routers.

      multiple times for the same link in\n   different OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque
      LSAs originated by the same\n   OSPFv2 router, the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV
      in the OSPFv2 Extended\n   Link Opaque LSA with the smallest Opaque ID is used
      by receiving\n   OSPFv2 routers.  This situation may be logged as a warning.\n
      \  It is RECOMMENDED that OSPFv2 routers advertising OSPFv2 Extended\n   Link
      TLVs in different OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSAs re-originate\n   these LSAs
      in ascending order of Opaque ID to minimize the\n   disruption.\n   This document

    compatible\n   [OPAQUE], the extensions described herein are fully backward\n

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   In general, new LSAs defined in this document
    are subject to the same\n   security concerns as those described in [OSPFV2] and
    [OPAQUE].\n   OSPFv2 applications utilizing these OSPFv2 extensions must define
    the\n   security considerations relating to those applications in the\n   specifications
    corresponding to those applications.\n   Additionally, implementations must assure
    that malformed TLV and sub-\n   TLV permutations are detected and do not provide
    a vulnerability for\n   attackers to crash the OSPFv2 router or routing process.
    \ Malformed\n   LSAs MUST NOT be stored in the Link State Database (LSDB),\n   acknowledged,
    or reflooded.  Reception of malformed LSAs SHOULD be\n   counted and/or logged
    for further analysis.  In this context, a\n   malformed LSA is one that cannot
    be parsed due to a TLV or sub-TLV\n   overrunning the end of the subsuming LSA,
    TLV, or sub-TLV or where\n   there is data remaining to be parsed but the length
    of the remaining\n   data is less than the size of a TLV header.\n"
