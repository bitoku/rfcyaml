    \  July 1991\n    1   Introduction\n    The Internet is moving towards a multi-protocol\
    \ environment that\n    includes OSI. To support OSI in the Internet, an OSI lower\
    \ layers\n    infrastructure is required. This infrastructure comprises the\n\
    \    connectionless network protocol (CLNP) [12] (see also RFC 994 [8])\n    and\
    \ supporting routing protocols. Also required as part of this\n    infrastructure\
    \ are guidelines for network service access point (NSAP)\n    address assignment.\
    \ This paper provides guidelines for allocating\n    NSAPs in the Internet (NSAP\
    \ and NSAP address are used interchangeably\n    throughout this paper in referring\
    \ to NSAP addresses).\n    The remainder of this paper is organized into five\
    \ major sections and\n    an appendix. Section 2 defines the boundaries of the\
    \ problem addressed\n    in this paper and Section 3 provides background information\
    \ on OSI\n    routing and the implications for NSAPs.\n    Section 4 addresses\
    \ the specific relationship between NSAPs and\n    routing, especially with regard\
    \ to hierarchical routing and data\n    abstraction. This is followed in Section\
    \ 5 with an application of\n    these concepts to the Internet environment. Section\
    \ 6 provides\n    recommended guidelines for NSAP allocation in the Internet.\n\
    \    Appendix A contains a compendium of useful information concerning\n    NSAP\
    \ structure and allocation authorities. The GOSIP Version 2 NSAP\n    structure\
    \ is discussed in detail and the structure for U.S.-based DCC\n    (Data Country\
    \ Code) NSAPs is described. Contact information for the\n    registration authorities\
    \ for GOSIP and DCC-based NSAPs in the U.S.,\n    the General Services Administration\
    \ (GSA) and the American National\n    Standards Institute (ANSI), respectively,\
    \ is provided.\n    2   Scope\n    There are two aspects of interest when discussing\
    \ OSI NSAP allocation\n    within the Internet. The first is the set of administrative\
    \ require-\n    ments for obtaining and allocating NSAPs; the second is the technical\n\
    \    aspect of such assignments, having largely to do with routing, both\n   \
    \ within a routing domain (intra-domain routing) and between routing\n    Colella,\
    \ Gardner, & Callon                                     [Page 4]\n    RFC 1237\
    \  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    domains\
    \ (inter-domain routing). This paper focuses on the technical\n    issues.\n \
    \   The technical issues in NSAP allocation are mainly related to routing.\n \
    \   This paper assumes that CLNP will be widely deployed in the Internet,\n  \
    \  and that the routing of CLNP traffic will normally be based on the OSI\n  \
    \  ES-IS (end-system to intermediate system) routing protocol applicable\n   \
    \ for point-to-point links and LANs [13] (see also RFC 995 [7]) and\n    the emerging\
    \ intra-domain IS-IS protocol [17]. Also expected is the\n    deployment of an\
    \ inter-domain routing protocol similar to Border\n    Gateway Protocol (BGP)\
    \ [18].\n    The guidelines provided in this paper are intended for immediate\n\
    \    deployment as CLNP is made available in the Internet. This paper\n    specifically\
    \ does not address long-term research issues, such as\n    complex policy-based\
    \ routing requirements.\n    In the current Internet many routing domains (such\
    \ as corporate and\n    campus networks) attach to transit networks (such as NSFNET\
    \ regionals)\n    in only one or a small number of carefully controlled access\
    \ points.\n    Addressing solutions which require substantial changes or constraints\n\
    \    on the current topology are not considered.\n    The guidelines in this paper\
    \ are oriented primarily toward the large-\n    scale division of NSAP address\
    \ allocation in the Internet. Topics\n    covered include:\n       * Arrangement\
    \ of parts of the NSAP for efficient operation of the\n         DIS10589IS-IS\
    \ routing protocol;\n       * Benefits of some topological information in NSAPs\
    \ to reduce\n         routing protocol overhead;\n       * The anticipated need\
    \ for additional levels of hierarchy in\n         Internet addressing to support\
    \ network growth;\n       * The recommended mapping between Internet topological\
    \ entities\n         (i.e., backbone networks, regional networks, and site networks)\n\
    \         and OSI addressing and routing components;\n       * The recommended\
    \ division of NSAP address assignment authority\n         among backbones, regionals\
    \ (also called mid-levels), and sites;\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon       \

    \ Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n       * Background information on administrative\
    \ procedures for registra-\n         tion of administrative authorities immediately\
    \ below the national\n         level (GOSIP administrative authorities and ANSI\
    \ organization\n         identifiers); and,\n       * Choice of the high-order\
    \ portion of the NSAP in leaf routing\n         domains that are connected to\
    \ more than one regional or backbone.\n    It is noted that there are other aspects\
    \ of NSAP allocation, both\n    technical and administrative, that are not covered\
    \ in this paper.\n    Topics not covered or mentioned only superficially include:\n\
    \       * Identification of specific administrative domains in the Internet;\n\
    \       * Policy or mechanisms for making registered information known to\n  \
    \       third parties (such as the entity to which a specific NSAP or a\n    \
    \     potion of the NSAP address space has been allocated);\n       * How a routing\
    \ domain (especially a site) should organize its\n         internal topology of\
    \ areas or allocate portions of its NSAP\n         address space; the relationship\
    \ between topology and addresses is\n         discussed, but the method of deciding\
    \ on a particular topology or\n         internal addressing plan is not; and,\n\
    \       * Procedures for assigning the System Identifier (ID) portion of the\n\
    \         NSAP.\n    3   Background\n    Some background information is provided\
    \ in this section that is\n    helpful in understanding the issues involved in\
    \ NSAP allocation. A\n    brief discussion of OSI routing is provided, followed\
    \ by a review\n    of the intra-domain protocol in sufficient detail to understand\
    \ the\n    issues involved in NSAP allocation. Finally, the specific constraints\n\
    \    that the intra-domain protocol places on NSAPs are listed.\n    Colella,\

    \ Routing Standards\n    OSI partitions the routing problem into three parts:\n\
    \       * routing exchanges between end systems and intermediate systems\n   \
    \      (ES-IS),\n       * routing exchanges between ISs in the same routing domain\
    \ (intra-\n         domain IS-IS), and,\n       * routing among routing domains\
    \ (inter-domain IS-IS).\n    ES-IS, international standard ISO9542 [13] approved\
    \ in 1987, is\n    available in vendor products and is planned for the next release\
    \ of\n    Berkeley UNIX (UNIX is a trademark of AT&T). It is also cited in GOSIP\n\
    \    Version 2 [4], which became effective in April 1991 for all applicable\n\
    \    federal procurements, and mandatory beginning eighteen months later in\n\
    \    1992.\n    Intra-domain IS-IS advanced to draft international standard (DIS)\n\
    \    status within ISO in November, 1990 as DIS10589 [17]. It is reasonable\n\
    \    to expect that final text for the intra-domain IS-IS standard will be\n \
    \   available by mid-1991.\n    There are two candidate proposals which address\
    \ OSI inter-domain\n    routing, ECMA TR/50 [3] and Border Router Protocol (BRP)\
    \ [19], a\n    direct derivative of the IETF Border Gateway Protocol [18]. ECMA\
    \ TR/50\n    has been proposed as base text in the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6/WG2 committee,\n\
    \    which is responsible for the Network layer of the ISO Reference Model\n \
    \   [11 ].X3S3.3, the ANSI counterpart to WG2, has incorporated features\n   \
    \ of TR/50 into BRP and submitted this as alternate base text at the\n    WG2\
    \ meeting in October, 1990. Currently, it is out for ISO Member\n    Body comment.\
    \ The proposed protocol is referred to as the Inter-domain\n    Routing Protocol\
    \ (IDRP) [20].\n    This paper examines the technical implications of NSAP assignment\n\
    \    under the assumption that ES-IS, intra-domain IS-IS, and IDRP routing\n \
    \   are deployed to support CLNP.\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon            \

    \ in the Internet  July 1991\n    3.2   Overview of DIS10589\n    The IS-IS intra-domain\
    \ routing protocol, DIS10589, developed in ISO,\n    provides routing for OSI\
    \ environments. In particular, DIS10589 is\n    designed to work in conjunction\
    \ with CLNP and ES-IS. This section\n    briefly describes the manner in which\
    \ DIS10589 operates.\n    In DIS10589, the internetwork is partitioned into routing\
    \ domains.\n    A routing domain is a collection of ESs and ISs that operate common\n\
    \    routing protocols and are under the control of a single administra-\n   \
    \ tion. Typically, a routing domain may consist of a corporate network,\n    a\
    \ university campus network, a regional network, or a similar contigu-\n    ous\
    \ network under control of a single administrative organization. The\n    boundaries\
    \ of routing domains are defined by network management by\n    setting some links\
    \ to be exterior, or inter-domain, links. If a link\n    is marked as exterior,\
    \ no DIS10589 routing messages are sent on that\n    link.\n    Currently, ISO\
    \ does not have a standard for inter-domain routing\n    (i.e., for routing between\
    \ separate autonomous routing domains). In\n    the interim, DIS10589 uses manual\
    \ configuration. An inter-domain link\n    is statically configured with the set\
    \ of address prefixes reachable\n    via that link, and with the method by which\
    \ they can be reached (such\n    as the DTE address to be dialed to reach that\
    \ address, or the fact\n    that the DTE address should be extracted from the\
    \ OSI NSAP address).\n    DIS10589 routing makes use of two-level hierarchical\
    \ routing. A\n    routing domain is subdivided into areas (also known as level\
    \ 1\n    subdomains). Level 1 ISs know the topology in their area, including\n\
    \    all ISs and ESs in their area. However, level 1 ISs do not know the\n   \
    \ identity of ISs or destinations outside of their area. Level 1 ISs\n    forward\
    \ all traffic for destinations outside of their area to a level\n    2 IS within\
    \ their area.\n    Similarly, level 2 ISs know the level 2 topology and know which\n\
    \    addresses are reachable via each level 2 IS. The set of all level 2\n   \
    \ ISs in a routing domain are known as the level 2 subdomain, which can\n    be\
    \ thought of as a backbone for interconnecting the areas. Level 2\n    ISs do\
    \ not need to know the topology within any level 1 area, except\n    to the extent\
    \ that a level 2 IS may also be a level 1 IS within a\n    single area. Only level\
    \ 2 ISs can exchange data packets or routing\n    information directly with external\
    \ ISs located outside of their\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon               \

    \ in the Internet  July 1991\n    routing domain.\n    As illustrated in Figure\
    \ 1, ISO addresses are subdivided into the\n    Initial Domain Part (IDP) and\
    \ the Domain Specific Part (DSP), as spec-\n    ified in ISO8348/Addendum 2, the\
    \ OSI network layer addressing standard\n    [14 ](also RFC 941 [6]). The IDP\
    \ is the part which is standardized by\n    ISO, and specifies the format and\
    \ authority responsible for assigning\n    the rest of the address. The DSP is\
    \ assigned by whatever addressing\n    authority is specified by the IDP (see\
    \ Appendix A for more discussion\n    on the top level NSAP addressing authorities).\
    \ The DSP is further\n    subdivided, by DIS10589, into a High Order Part of DSP\
    \ (HO-DSP), a\n    system identifier (ID), and an NSAP selector (SEL). The HO-DSP\
    \ may\n    use any format desired by the authority which is identified by the\n\
    \    IDP. Together, the combination of [IDP,HO-DSP] identify an area within\n\
    \    a routing domain and, implicitly, the routing domain containing the\n   \
    \ area. The combination of [IDP,HO-DSP] is therefore referred to as the\n    area\
    \ address.\n                  _______________________________________________\n\

    \    The ID field may be from one to eight octets in length, but must have\n \
    \   a single known length in any particular routing domain. Each router is\n \
    \   configured to know what length is used in its domain. The SEL field is\n \
    \   always one octet in length. Each router is therefore able to identify\n  \
    \  the ID and SEL fields as a known number of trailing octets of the NSAP\n  \
    \  address. The area address can be identified as the remainder of the\n    address\
    \ (after truncation of the ID and SEL fields).\n    Usually, all nodes in an area\
    \ have the same area address. However,\n    sometimes an area might have multiple\
    \ addresses. Motivations for\n    allowing this are several:\n    Colella, Gardner,\

    \ for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n       * It might be desirable\
    \ to change the address of an area. The most\n         graceful way of changing\
    \ an area from having address A to having\n         address B is to first allow\
    \ it to have both addresses A and B, and\n         then after all nodes in the\
    \ area have been modified to recognize\n         both addresses, one by one the\
    \ ESs can be modified to forget\n         address A.\n       * It might be desirable\
    \ to merge areas A and B into one area. The\n         method for accomplishing\
    \ this is to, one by one, add knowledge of\n         address B into the A partition,\
    \ and similarly add knowledge of\n         address A into the B partition.\n \
    \      * It might be desirable to partition an area C into two areas, A and\n\
    \         B (where A might equal C, in which case this example becomes one\n \
    \        of removing a portion of an area). This would be accomplished by\n  \
    \       first introducing knowledge of address A into the appropriate ESs\n  \
    \       (those destined to become area A), and knowledge of address B into\n \
    \        the appropriate nodes, and then one by one removing knowledge of\n  \
    \       address C.\n    Since the addressing explicitly identifies the area, it\
    \ is very easy\n    for level 1 ISs to identify packets going to destinations\
    \ outside\n    of their area, which need to be forwarded to level 2 ISs. Thus,\
    \ in\n    DIS10589 the two types of ISs route as follows:\n       * Level 1 intermediate\
    \ systems -- these nodes route based on the ID\n         portion of the ISO address.\
    \ They route within an area. Level 1 ISs\n         recognize, based on the destination\
    \ address in a packet, whether\n         the destination is within the area. If\
    \ so, they route towards the\n         destination. If not, they route to the\
    \ nearest level 2 IS.\n       * Level 2 intermediate systems -- these nodes route\
    \ based on address\n         prefixes, preferring the longest matching prefix,\
    \ and preferring\n         internal routes over external routes. They route towards\
    \ areas,\n         without regard to the internal structure of an area; or towards\n\
    \         level 2 ISs on the routing domain boundary that have advertised\n  \
    \       external address prefixes into the level 2 subdomain. A level 2 IS\n \
    \        may also be operating as a level 1 IS in one area.\n    A level 1 IS\
    \ will have the area portion of its address manually\n    configured. It will\
    \ refuse to become a neighbor with an IS whose area\n    addresses do not overlap\
    \ its own area addresses. However, if a level 1\n    IS has area addresses A,\
    \ B, and C, and a neighbor has area addresses\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon\
    \                                    [Page 10] \f    RFC 1237  Guidelines for\
    \ OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    B and D, then the level\
    \ 1 IS will accept the other IS as a level 1\n    neighbor.\n    A level 2 IS\
    \ will accept another level 2 IS as a neighbor, regardless\n    of area address.\
    \ However, if the area addresses do not overlap, the\n    link would be considered\
    \ by both ISs to be level 2 only, and only\n    level 2 routing packets would\
    \ flow on the link. External links (i.e.,\n    to other routing domains) must\
    \ be between level 2 ISs in different\n    routing domains.\n    DIS10589 provides\
    \ an optional partition repair function. In the\n    unlikely case that a level\
    \ 1 area becomes partitioned, this function,\n    if implemented, allows the partition\
    \ to be repaired via use of level 2\n    routes.\n    DIS10589 requires that the\
    \ set of level 2 ISs be connected. Should the\n    level 2 backbone become partitioned,\
    \ there is no provision for use of\n    level 1 links to repair a level 2 partition.\n\
    \    In unusual cases, a single level 2 IS may lose connectivity to the\n    level\
    \ 2 backbone. In this case the level 2 IS will indicate in its\n    level 1 routing\
    \ packets that it is not attached, thereby allowing\n    level 1 ISs in the area\
    \ to route traffic for outside of the area\n    to a different level 2 IS. Level\
    \ 1 ISs therefore route traffic to\n    destinations outside of their area only\
    \ to level 2 ISs which indicate\n    in their level 1 routing packets that they\
    \ are attached.\n    An ES may autoconfigure the area portion of its address by\
    \ extracting\n    the area portion of a neighboring IS's address. If this is the\
    \ case,\n    then an ES will always accept an IS as a neighbor. Since the standard\n\
    \    does not specify that the end system must autoconfigure its area\n    address,\
    \ an end system may be pre-configured with an area address. In\n    this case\
    \ the end system would ignore IS neighbors with non-matching\n    area addresses.\n\

    \ of the DSP (HO-DSP) is that portion of the\n         DSP whose assignment, structure,\
    \ and meaning are not constrained\n         by DIS10589;\n       * The concatenation\
    \ of the IDP and the HO-DSP, the area address,\n         must be globally unique\
    \ (if the area address of an NSAP matches\n         one of the area addresses\
    \ of a system, it is in the system's area\n         and is routed to by level\
    \ 1 routing);\n       * Level 2 routing acts on address prefixes, using the longest\n\
    \         address prefix that matches the destination address;\n       * Level\
    \ 1 routing acts on the ID field. The ID field must be unique\n         within\
    \ an area for ESs and level 1 ISs, and unique within the\n         routing domain\
    \ for level 2 ISs. The ID field is assumed to be\n         flat;\n       * The\
    \ one-octet NSAP Selector, SEL, determines the entity to receive\n         the\
    \ CLNP packet within the system identified by the rest of the\n         NSAP (i.e.,\
    \ a transport entity) and is always the last octet of\n         the NSAP; and,\n\
    \       * A system shall be able to generate and forward data packets\n      \
    \   containing addresses in any of the formats specified by ISO\n         8348/Addendum\
    \ 2. However, within a routing domain that conforms to\n         DIS10589, the\
    \ lower-order octets of the NSAP should be structured\n         as the ID and\
    \ SEL fields shown in Figure 1 to take full advantage\n         of DIS10589 routing.\
    \ End systems with addresses which do not\n         conform may require additional\
    \ manual configuration and be subject\n         to inferior routing performance.\n\
    \    For purposes of efficient operation of the IS-IS routing protocol,\n    several\
    \ observations may be made. First, although the IS-IS protocol\n    specifies\
    \ an algorithm for routing within a single routing domain, the\n    routing algorithm\
    \ must efficiently route both: (i) Packets whose final\n    destination is in\
    \ the domain (these must, of course, be routed to the\n    correct destination\
    \ end system in the domain); and (ii) Packets whose\n    final destination is\
    \ outside of the domain (these must be routed to a\n    correct ``border'' router,\
    \ from which they will exit the domain).\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon     \
    \                               [Page 12]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI NSAP\
    \ Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    For those destinations which are\
    \ in the domain, level 2 routing treats\n    the entire area address (i.e., all\
    \ of the NSAP address except the ID\n    and SEL fields) as if it were a flat\
    \ field. Thus, the efficiency of\n    level 2 routing to destinations within the\
    \ domain is affected only by\n    the number of areas in the domain, and the number\
    \ of area addresses\n    assigned to each area (which can range from one up to\
    \ a maximum of\n    three).\n    For those destinations which are outside of the\
    \ domain, level 2\n    routing routes according to address prefixes. In this case,\
    \ there\n    is considerable potential advantage (in terms of reducing the amount\n\
    \    of routing information that is required) if the number of address\n    prefixes\
    \ required to describe any particular set of destinations can\n    be minimized.\n\
    \    4   NSAPs and Routing\n    When determining an administrative policy for\
    \ NSAP assignment, it\n    is important to understand the technical consequences.\
    \ The objective\n    behind the use of hierarchical routing is to achieve some\
    \ level\n    of routing data abstraction, or summarization, to reduce the cpu,\n\
    \    memory, and transmission bandwidth consumed in support of routing.\n    This\
    \ dictates that NSAPs be assigned according to topological\n    routing structures.\
    \ However, administrative assignment falls along\n    organizational or political\
    \ boundaries. These may not be congruent to\n    topological boundaries and therefore\
    \ the requirements of the two may\n    collide. It is necessary to find a balance\
    \ between these two needs.\n    Routing data abstraction occurs at the boundary\
    \ between hierarchically\n    arranged topological routing structures. An element\
    \ lower in the\n    hierarchy reports summary routing information to its parent(s).\
    \ Within\n    the current OSI routing framework [16] and routing protocols, the\n\
    \    lowest boundary at which this can occur is the boundary between an\n    area\
    \ and the level 2 subdomain within a DIS10589 routing domain. Data\n    abstraction\
    \ is designed into DIS10589 at this boundary, since level 1\n    ISs are constrained\
    \ to reporting only area addresses, and a maximum\n    number of three area addresses\
    \ are allowed in one area (This is an\n    architectural constant in DIS10589.\
    \ See [17], Clause 7.2.11 and Table\n    2 of Clause 7.5.1).\n    Colella, Gardner,\
    \ & Callon                                    [Page 13]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines\
    \ for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    Level 2 routing is based\
    \ upon address prefixes. Level 2 ISs dis-\n    tribute, throughout the level 2\
    \ subdomain, the area addresses of the\n    level 1 areas to which they are attached\
    \ (and any manually configured\n    reachable address prefixes). Level 2 ISs compute\
    \ next-hop forwarding\n    information to all advertised address prefixes. Level\
    \ 2 routing is\n    determined by the longest advertised address prefix that matches\
    \ the\n    destination address.\n    At routing domain boundaries, address prefix\
    \ information is exchanged\n    (statically or dynamically) with other routing\
    \ domains. If area\n    addresses within a routing domain are all drawn from distinct\
    \ NSAP\n    assignment authorities (allowing no abstraction), then the boundary\n\
    \    prefix information consists of an enumerated list of all area\n    addresses.\n\
    \    Alternatively, should the routing domain ``own'' an address prefix\n    and\
    \ assign area addresses based upon it, boundary routing information\n    can be\
    \ summarized into the single prefix. This can allow substantial\n    data reduction\
    \ and, therefore, will allow much better scaling (as\n    compared to the uncoordinated\
    \ area addresses discussed in the previous\n    paragraph).\n    If routing domains\
    \ are interconnected in a more-or-less random (non-\n    hierarchical) scheme,\
    \ it is quite likely that no further abstraction\n    of routing data can occur.\
    \ Since routing domains would have no defined\n    hierarchical relationship,\
    \ administrators would not be able to assign\n    area addresses out of some common\
    \ prefix for the purpose of data\n    abstraction. The result would be flat inter-domain\
    \ routing; all\n    routing domains would need explicit knowledge of all other\
    \ routing\n    domains that they route to. This can work well in small- and medium-\n\
    \    sized internets, up to a size somewhat larger than the current IP\n    Internet.\
    \ However, this does not scale to very large internets. For\n    example, we expect\
    \ growth in the future to an international Internet\n    which has tens or hundreds\
    \ of thousands of routing domains in the U.S.\n    alone. This requires a greater\
    \ degree of data abstraction beyond that\n    which can be achieved at the ``routing\
    \ domain'' level.\n    In the Internet, however, it should be possible to exploit\
    \ the\n    existing hierarchical routing structure interconnections, as discussed\n\
    \    in Section 5. Thus, there is the opportunity for a group of routing\n   \
    \ domains each to be assigned an address prefix from a shorter prefix\n    assigned\
    \ to another routing domain whose function is to interconnect\n    the group of\
    \ routing domains. Each member of the group of routing\n    Colella, Gardner,\
    \ & Callon                                    [Page 14]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines\
    \ for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    domains now ``owns''\
    \ its (somewhat longer) prefix, from which it\n    assigns its area addresses.\n\
    \    The most straightforward case of this occurs when there is a set\n    of\
    \ routing domains which are all attached only to a single regional\n    (or backbone)\
    \ domain, and which use that regional for all external\n    (inter-domain) traffic.\
    \ A small address prefix may be assigned to\n    the regional, which then assigns\
    \ slightly longer prefixes (based\n    on the regional's prefix) to each of the\
    \ routing domains that it\n    interconnects. This allows the regional, when informing\
    \ other\n    routing domains of the addresses that it can reach, to abbreviate\n\
    \    the reachability information for a large number of routing domains\n    as\
    \ a single prefix. This approach therefore can allow a great deal\n    of hierarchical\
    \ abbreviation of routing information, and thereby can\n    greatly improve the\
    \ scalability of inter-domain routing.\n    Clearly, this approach is recursive\
    \ and can be carried through several\n    iterations. Routing domains at any ``level''\
    \ in the hierarchy may\n    use their prefix as the basis for subsequent suballocations,\
    \ assuming\n    that the NSAP addresses remain within the overall length and structure\n\
    \    constraints. The GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure, discussed later in\n   \
    \ this section, allows for multiple levels of routing hierarchy.\n    At this\
    \ point, we observe that the number of nodes at each lower\n    level of a hierarchy\
    \ tends to grow exponentially. Thus the greatest\n    gains in data abstraction\
    \ occur at the leaves and the gains drop\n    significantly at each higher level.\
    \ Therefore, the law of diminishing\n    returns suggests that at some point data\
    \ abstraction ceases to\n    produce significant benefits. Determination of the\
    \ point at which data\n    abstraction ceases to be of benefit requires a careful\
    \ consideration\n    of the number of routing domains that are expected to occur\
    \ at each\n    level of the hierarchy (over a given period of time), compared\
    \ to the\n    number of routing domains and address prefixes that can conveniently\n\
    \    and efficiently be handled via dynamic inter-domain routing protocols.\n\
    \    There is a balance that must be sought between the requirements\n    on NSAPs\
    \ for efficient routing and the need for decentralized NSAP\n    administration.\
    \ The NSAP structure from Version 2 of GOSIP (Figure 2)\n    offers an example\
    \ of how these two needs might be met. The AFI,\n    IDI, DFI, and AA fields provide\
    \ for administrative decentralization.\n    The AFI/IDI pair of values 47/0005\
    \ identify the U.S. government\n    as the authority responsible for defining\

    \ DSP structure\n    to that provided by GOSIP Version 2. The ANSI format, therefore,\n\
    \    differs from that illustrated above only in that the IDP is based\n    on\
    \ an ISO DCC assignment, and in that the AA will be administered\n    by a different\
    \ organization (ANSI secretariat instead of GSA).\n    The technical considerations\
    \ applicable to NSAP administration are\n    independent of whether a GOSIP Version\
    \ 2 or an ANSI value is used for\n    the NSAP assignment.\n    Similarly, although\
    \ other countries may make use of slightly different\n    NSAP formats, the principles\
    \ of NSAP assignment and use are the same.\n    In the low-order part of the GOSIP\
    \ Version 2 NSAP format, two\n    fields are defined in addition to those required\
    \ by DIS10589. These\n    fields, RD and Area, are defined to allow allocation\
    \ of NSAPs along\n    topological boundaries in support of increased data abstraction.\n\
    \    Administrations assign RD identifiers underneath their unique address\n \
    \   prefix (the reserved field is left to accommodate future growth and\n    to\
    \ provide additional flexibility for inter-domain routing). Routing\n    domains\
    \ allocate Area identifiers from their unique prefix. The result\n    is:\n  \
    \     * AFI+IDI+DFI+AA = administration prefix,\n       * administration prefix(+Rsvd)+RD\
    \ = routing domain prefix, and,\n       * routing domain prefix+Area = area address.\n\
    \    This provides for summarization of all area addresses within a routing\n\
    \    domain into one prefix. If the AA identifier is accorded topological\n  \
    \  significance (in addition to administrative significance), an\n    additional\
    \ level of data abstraction can be obtained, as is discussed\n    in the next\
    \ section.\n    5   NSAP Administration and Routing in the Internet\n    Internet\

    \ arranged hierarchically for the most part. A\n    natural mapping from these\
    \ components to OSI routing components\n    is that backbones, regionals, and\
    \ sites act as routing domains.\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon              \

    \ in the Internet  July 1991\n    (Alternatively, a site may choose to operate\
    \ as an area within a\n    regional. However, in such a case the area is part\
    \ of the regional's\n    routing domain and the discussion in Section 5.1 applies.\
    \ We assume\n    that some, if not most, sites will prefer to operate as routing\n\
    \    domains. By operating as a routing domain, a site operates a level 2\n  \
    \  subdomain as well as one or more level 1 areas.)\n    Given such a mapping,\
    \ where should address administration and alloca-\n    tion be performed to satisfy\
    \ both administrative decentralization and\n    data abstraction? Three possibilities\
    \ are considered:\n      1. at the area,\n      2. at the leaf routing domain,\
    \ and,\n      3. at the transit routing domain (TRD).\n    Leaf routing domains\
    \ correspond to sites, where the primary purpose is\n    to provide intra-domain\
    \ routing services. Transit routing domains are\n    deployed to carry transit\
    \ (i.e., inter-domain) traffic; backbones and\n    regionals are TRDs.\n    The\
    \ greatest burden in transmitting and operating on routing informa-\n    tion\
    \ is at the top of the routing hierarchy, where routing information\n    tends\
    \ to accumulate. In the Internet, for example, regionals must man-\n    age the\
    \ set of network numbers for all networks reachable through the\n    regional.\
    \ Traffic destined for other networks is generally routed to\n    the backbone.\
    \ The backbones, however, must be cognizant of the network\n    numbers for all\

    \ of abstracting routing information at a\n    given level of the routing hierarchy\
    \ is greater at the higher levels\n    of the hierarchy. There is relatively little\
    \ direct benefit to the\n    administration that performs the abstraction, since\
    \ it must maintain\n    routing information individually on each attached topological\
    \ routing\n    structure.\n    For example, suppose that a given site is trying\
    \ to decide whether\n    to obtain an NSAP address prefix based on an AA value\
    \ from GSA\n    (implying that the first four octets of the address would be those\n\
    \    assigned out of the GOSIP space), or based on an RD value from its\n    regional\

    \ to that regional). If considering only their own\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon\

    \ NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    self-interest, the site itself,\
    \ and the attached regional, have\n    little reason to choose one approach or\
    \ the other. The site must use\n    one prefix or another; the source of the prefix\
    \ has little effect\n    on routing efficiency within the site. The regional must\
    \ maintain\n    information about each attached site in order to route, regardless\
    \ of\n    any commonality in the prefixes of the sites.\n    However, there is\
    \ a difference when the regional distributes routing\n    information to backbones\
    \ and other regionals. In the first case, the\n    regional cannot aggregate the\
    \ site's address into its own prefix;\n    the address must be explicitly listed\
    \ in routing exchanges, resulting\n    in an additional burden to backbones and\
    \ other regionals which must\n    exchange and maintain this information.\n  \
    \  In the second case, each other regional and backbone sees a single\n    address\
    \ prefix for the regional, which encompasses the new site. This\n    avoids the\
    \ exchange of additional routing information to identify the\n    new site's address\
    \ prefix. Thus, the advantages primarily accrue to\n    other regionals and backbones\
    \ which maintain routing information about\n    this site and regional.\n    One\
    \ might apply a supplier/consumer model to this problem: the higher\n    level\
    \ (e.g., a backbone) is a supplier of routing services, while\n    the lower level\
    \ (e.g., an attached regional) is the consumer of these\n    services. The price\
    \ charged for services is based upon the cost of\n    providing them. The overhead\
    \ of managing a large table of addresses\n    for routing to an attached topological\
    \ entity contributes to this\n    cost.\n    The Internet, however, is not a market\
    \ economy. Rather, efficient\n    operation is based on cooperation. The guidelines\
    \ discussed below\n    describe reasonable ways of managing the OSI address space\
    \ that\n    benefit the entire community.\n    5.1   Administration at the Area\n\
    \    If areas take their area addresses from a myriad of unrelated NSAP\n    allocation\
    \ authorities, there will be effectively no data abstraction\n    beyond what\

    \ = xxx:\n                       AFI=39, IDI=840, DFI=dd, ORG=xxx, ....\n    As\
    \ described in Section 3.3, from the point of view of any particular\n    routing\
    \ domain, there is no harm in having the different areas in\n    the routing domain\
    \ use addresses obtained from a wide variety of\n    administrations. For routing\
    \ within the domain, the area addresses are\n    treated as a flat field.\n  \
    \  However, this does have a negative effect on inter-domain routing,\n    particularly\
    \ on those other domains which need to maintain routes to\n    this domain. There\
    \ is no common prefix that can be used to represent\n    these NSAPs and therefore\
    \ no summarization can take place at the\n    routing domain boundary. When addresses\
    \ are advertised by this routing\n    domain to other routing domains, an enumerated\
    \ list must be used\n    consisting of the three area addresses.\n    This situation\
    \ is roughly analogous to the dissemination of routing\n    information in the\
    \ TCP/IP Internet. Areas correspond roughly to\n    networks and area addresses\
    \ to network numbers. The result of allowing\n    areas within a routing domain\
    \ to take their NSAPs from unrelated\n    authorities is flat routing at the area\
    \ address level. The number\n    of address prefixes that leaf routing domains\
    \ would advertise is on\n    the order of the number of attached areas; the number\
    \ of prefixes a\n    regional routing domain would advertise is approximately\
    \ the number of\n    areas attached to the client leaf routing domains; and for\
    \ a backbone\n    this would be summed across all attached regionals. Although\
    \ this\n    situation is just barely acceptable in the current Internet, as the\n\
    \    Internet grows this will quickly become intractable. A greater degree\n \
    \   of hierarchical information reduction is necessary to allow continued\n  \
    \  growth in the Internet.\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                   \

    \ in the Internet  July 1991\n    5.2   Administration at the Leaf Routing Domain\n\
    \    As mentioned previously, the greatest degree of data abstraction comes\n\
    \    at the lowest levels of the hierarchy. Providing each leaf routing\n    domain\
    \ (that is, site) with a unique prefix results in the biggest\n    single increase\
    \ in abstraction, with each leaf domain assigning area\n    addresses from its\
    \ prefix. From outside the leaf routing domain, the\n    set of all addresses\
    \ reachable in the domain can then be represented\n    by a single prefix.\n \
    \   As an example, assume NSF has been assigned the AA value of zzz\n    under\
    \ ICD=0005. NSF then assigns a routing domain identifier to a\n    routing domain\
    \ under its administrative authority identifier, rrr. The\n    resulting prefix\
    \ for the routing domain is:\n               AFI=47, IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=zzz,\
    \ Rsvd=0, RD=rrr.\n    All areas attached to this routing domain would have area\
    \ addresses\n    comprising this prefix followed by an Area identifier. The prefix\n\
    \    represents the summary of reachable addresses within the routing\n    domain.\n\
    \    There is a close relationship between areas and routing domains\n    implicit\
    \ in the fact that they operate a common routing protocol and\n    are under the\
    \ control of a single administration. The routing domain\n    administration subdivides\
    \ the domain into areas and structures a level\n    2 subdomain (i.e., a level\
    \ 2 backbone) which provides connectivity\n    among the areas. The routing domain\
    \ represents the only path between\n    an area and the rest of the internetwork.\
    \ It is reasonable that\n    this relationship also extend to include a common\
    \ NSAP addressing\n    authority. Thus, the areas within the leaf RD should take\
    \ their NSAPs\n    from the prefix assigned to the leaf RD.\n    5.3   Administration\
    \ at the Transit Routing Domain\n    Two kinds of transit routing domains are\
    \ considered, backbones and\n    regionals. Each is discussed separately below.\n\
    \    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                                    [Page 21]\n\
    \    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n\
    \    5.3.1   Regionals\n    It is interesting to consider whether regional routing\
    \ domains should\n    be the common authority for assigning NSAPs from a unique\
    \ prefix to\n    the leaf routing domains that they serve. The benefits derived\
    \ from\n    data abstraction are less than in the case of leaf routing domains,\n\
    \    and the additional degree of data abstraction provided by this is\n    not\
    \ necessary in the short term. However, in the long term the number\n    of routing\
    \ domains in the Internet will grow to the point that it\n    will be infeasible\
    \ to route on the basis of a flat field of routing\n    domains. It will therefore\
    \ be essential to provide a greater degree of\n    information abstraction.\n\
    \    Regionals may assign prefixes to leaf domains, based on a single\n    (shorter\
    \ length) address prefix assigned to the regional. For example,\n    given the\
    \ GOSIP Version 2 address structure, an AA value may be\n    assigned to each\
    \ regional, and routing domain values may be assigned\n    by the regional to\
    \ each attached leaf routing domain. A similar\n    hierarchical address assignment\
    \ based on a prefix assigned to each\n    regional may be used for other NSAP\
    \ formats. This results in regionals\n    advertising to backbones a small fraction\
    \ of the number of address\n    prefixes that would be necessary if they enumerated\
    \ the individual\n    prefixes of the leaf routing domains. This represents a\
    \ significant\n    savings given the expected scale of global internetworking.\n\
    \    Are leaf routing domains willing to accept prefixes derived from\n    the\
    \ regional's? In the supplier/consumer model, the regional is\n    offering connectivity\
    \ as the service, priced according to its costs\n    of operation. This includes\
    \ the ``price'' of obtaining service from\n    one or more backbones. In general,\
    \ backbones will want to handle as\n    few address prefixes as possible to keep\
    \ costs low. In the Internet\n    environment, which does not operate as a typical\
    \ marketplace, leaf\n    routing domains must be sensitive to the resource constraints\
    \ of the\n    regionals and backbones. The efficiencies gained in routing clearly\n\
    \    warrant the adoption of NSAP administration by the regionals.\n    The mechanics\
    \ of this scenario are straightforward. Each regional\n    is assigned a unique\
    \ prefix, from which it allocates slightly longer\n    routing domain prefixes\
    \ for its attached leaf routing domains.\n    For GOSIP NSAPs, this means that\
    \ a regional would be assigned an\n    AA identifier. Attached leaf routing domains\
    \ would be assigned RD\n    identifiers under the regional's unique prefix. For\
    \ example, assume\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                            \
    \        [Page 22]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet\
    \  July 1991\n    NIST is a leaf routing domain whose sole inter-domain link is\
    \ via\n    SURANet. If SURANet is assigned an AA identifier kkk, NIST could be\n\
    \    assigned an RD of jjj, resulting in a unique prefix for SURANet of:\n   \
    \                     AFI=47, IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=kkk\n    and a unique prefix\
    \ for NIST of\n              AFI=47, IDI=0005, DFI=80h, AA=kkk, (Rsvd=0), RD=jjj.\n\
    \    A similar scheme can be established using NSAPs allocated under\n    DCC=840.\
    \ In this case, a regional applies for an ORG identifier from\n    ANSI, which\
    \ serves the same purpose as the AA identifier in GOSIP.\n    The current direction\
    \ in ANSI is to standardize on an NSAP structure\n    identical to GOSIP Version\
    \ 2 (see Section A.2).\n    5.3.2   Backbones\n    There does not appear to be\
    \ a strong case for regionals to take their\n    address spaces from the the NSAP\
    \ space of a backbone. The benefit in\n    routing data abstraction is relatively\
    \ small. The number of regionals\n    today is in the tens and an order of magnitude\
    \ increase would not\n    cause an undue burden on the backbones. Also, it may\
    \ be expected that\n    as time goes by there will be increased direct interconnection\
    \ of the\n    regionals, leaf routing domains directly attached to the backbones,\n\
    \    and international links directly attached to the regionals. Under\n    these\
    \ circumstances, the distinction between regionals and backbones\n    may become\
    \ blurred.\n    An additional factor that discourages allocation of NSAPs from\
    \ a\n    backbone prefix is that the backbones and their attached regionals are\n\
    \    perceived as being independent. Regionals may take their long-haul\n    service\
    \ from one or more backbones, or may switch backbones should\n    a more cost-effective\
    \ service be provided elsewhere (essentially,\n    backbones can be thought of\
    \ the same way as long-distance telephone\n    carriers). Having NSAPs derived\
    \ from the backbone is inconsistent with\n    the nature of the relationship.\n\

    \    5.4   Multi-homed Routing Domains\n    The discussions in Section 5.3 suggest\
    \ methods for allocating NSAP\n    addresses based on regional or backbone connectivity.\
    \ This allows a\n    great deal of information reduction to be achieved for those\
    \ routing\n    domains which are attached to a single TRD. In particular, such\n\
    \    routing domains may select their NSAP addresses from a space allocated\n\
    \    to them by the regional. This allows the regional, when announcing the\n\
    \    addresses that it can reach to other regionals and backbones, to use\n  \
    \  a single address prefix to describe a large number of NSAP addresses\n    corresponding\
    \ to multiple routing domains.\n    However, there are additional considerations\
    \ for routing domains\n    which are attached to multiple regionals and backbones.\
    \ Such ``multi-\n    homed'' routing domains may, for example, consist of single-site\n\
    \    campuses and companies which are attached to multiple backbones, large\n\
    \    organizations which are attached to different regionals at different\n  \
    \  locations in the same country, or multi-national organizations which\n    are\
    \ attached to backbones in a variety of countries worldwide. There\n    are a\
    \ number of possible ways to deal with these multi-homed routing\n    domains.\n\
    \    One possible solution is to assign addresses to each multi-homed\n    organization\
    \ independently from the regionals and backbones to which\n    it is attached.\
    \ This allows each multi-homed organization to base its\n    NSAP assignments\
    \ on a single prefix, and to thereby summarize the set\n    of all NSAPs reachable\
    \ within that organization via a single prefix.\n    The disadvantage of this\
    \ approach is that since the NSAP address\n    for that organization has no relationship\
    \ to the addresses of any\n    particular TRD, the TRDs to which this organization\
    \ is attached will\n    need to advertise the prefix for this organization to\
    \ other regionals\n    and backbones. Other regionals and backbones (potentially\
    \ worldwide)\n    will need to maintain an explicit entry for that organization\
    \ in their\n    routing tables.\n    For example, suppose that a very large U.S.-wide\
    \ company ``Mega\n    Big International Incorporated'' (MBII) has a fully interconnected\n\
    \    internal network and is assigned a single AA value under the U.S.\n    GOSIP\
    \ Version 2 address space. It is likely that outside of the U.S.,\n    a single\
    \ entry may be maintained in routing tables for all U.S. GOSIP\n    addresses.\
    \ However, within the U.S., every backbone and regional\n    will need to maintain\
    \ a separate address entry for MBII. If MBII\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon \
    \                                   [Page 24]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI\
    \ NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    is in fact an international\
    \ corporation, then it may be necessary\n    for every backbone worldwide to maintain\
    \ a separate entry for MBII\n    (including backbones to which MBII is not attached).\
    \ Clearly this\n    may be acceptable if there are a small number of such multi-homed\n\
    \    routing domains, but would place an unacceptable load on routers\n    within\
    \ backbones if all organizations were to choose such address\n    assignments.\
    \ This solution may not scale to internets where there are\n    many hundreds\
    \ of thousands of multi-homed organizations.\n    A second possible approach would\
    \ be for multi-homed organizations to\n    be assigned a separate NSAP space for\
    \ each connection to a TRD, and\n    to assign a single address prefix to each\
    \ area within its routing\n    domain(s) based on the closest interconnection\
    \ point. For example, if\n    MBII had connections to two regionals in the U.S.\
    \ (one east coast, and\n    one west coast), as well as three connections to national\
    \ backbones\n    in Europe, and one in the far east, then MBII may make use of\
    \ six\n    different address prefixes. Each area within MBII would be assigned\
    \ a\n    single address prefix based on the nearest connection.\n    For purposes\
    \ of external routing of traffic from outside MBII to a\n    destination inside\
    \ of MBII, this approach works similarly to treating\n    MBII as six separate\
    \ organizations. For purposes of internal routing,\n    or for routing traffic\
    \ from inside of MBII to a destination outside of\n    MBII, this approach works\
    \ the same as the first solution.\n    If we assume that incoming traffic (coming\
    \ from outside of MBII, with\n    a destination within MBII) is always to enter\
    \ via the nearest point to\n    the destination, then each TRD which has a connection\
    \ to MBII needs\n    to announce to other TRDs the ability to reach only those\
    \ parts of\n    MBII whose address is taken from its own address space. This implies\n\
    \    that no additional routing information needs to be exchanged between\n  \
    \  TRDs, resulting in a smaller load on the inter-domain routing tables\n    maintained\
    \ by TRDs when compared to the first solution. This solution\n    therefore scales\
    \ better to extremely large internets containing very\n    large numbers of multi-homed\
    \ organizations.\n    One problem with the second solution is that backup routes\
    \ to multi-\n    homed organizations are not automatically maintained. With the\
    \ first\n    solution, each TRD, in announcing the ability to reach MBII, specifies\n\
    \    that it is able to reach all of the NSAPs within MBII. With the second\n\
    \    solution, each TRD announces that it can reach all of the NSAPs based\n \
    \   on its own address prefix, which only includes some of the NSAPs\n    within\
    \ MBII. If the connection between MBII and one particular TRD\n    Colella, Gardner,\
    \ & Callon                                    [Page 25]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines\
    \ for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    were severed, then the\
    \ NSAPs within MBII with addresses based on that\n    TRD would become unreachable\
    \ via inter-domain routing. The impact\n    of this problem can be reduced somewhat\
    \ by maintenance of additional\n    information within routing tables, but this\
    \ reduces the scaling\n    advantage of the second approach.\n    The second solution\
    \ also requires that when external connectivity\n    changes, internal addresses\
    \ also change.\n    Also note that this and the previous approach will tend to\
    \ cause\n    packets to take different routes. With the first approach, packets\n\
    \    from outside of MBII destined for within MBII will tend to enter via\n  \
    \  the point which is closest to the source (which will therefore tend to\n  \
    \  maximize the load on the networks internal to MBII). With the second\n    solution,\
    \ packets from outside destined for within MBII will tend to\n    enter via the\
    \ point which is closest to the destination (which will\n    tend to minimize\
    \ the load on the networks within MBII, and maximize\n    the load on the TRDs).\n\
    \    These solutions also have different effects on policies. For example,\n \
    \   suppose that country ``X'' has a law that traffic from a source\n    within\
    \ country X to a destination within country X must at all\n    times stay entirely\
    \ within the country. With the first solution, it\n    is not possible to determine\
    \ from the destination address whether\n    or not the destination is within the\
    \ country. With the second\n    solution, a separate address may be assigned to\
    \ those NSAPs which are\n    within country X, thereby allowing routing policies\
    \ to be followed.\n    Similarly, suppose that ``Little Small Company'' (LSC)\
    \ has a policy\n    that its packets may never be sent to a destination that is\
    \ within\n    MBII. With either solution, the routers within LSC may be configured\n\
    \    to discard any traffic that has a destination within MBII's address\n   \
    \ space. However, with the first solution this requires one entry;\n    with the\
    \ second it requires many entries and may be impossible as a\n    practical matter.\n\
    \    There are other possible solutions as well. A third approach is to\n    assign\
    \ each multi-homed organization a single address prefix, based on\n    one of\
    \ its connections to a TRD. Other TRDs to which the multi-homed\n    organization\
    \ are attached maintain a routing table entry for the\n    organization, but are\
    \ extremely selective in terms of which other\n    TRDs are told of this route.\
    \ This approach will produce a single\n    ``default'' routing entry which all\
    \ TRDs will know how to reach\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                \

    \ in the Internet  July 1991\n    (since presumably all TRDs will maintain routes\
    \ to each other), while\n    providing more direct routing in some cases.\n  \
    \  There is at least one situation in which this third approach is\n    particularly\
    \ appropriate. Suppose that a special interest group of\n    organizations have\
    \ deployed their own backbone. For example, lets\n    suppose that the U.S. National\
    \ Widget Manufacturers and Researchers\n    have set up a U.S.-wide backbone,\
    \ which is used by corporations\n    who manufacture widgets, and certain universities\
    \ which are known\n    for their widget research efforts. We can expect that the\
    \ various\n    organizations which are in the widget group will run their internal\n\
    \    networks as separate routing domains, and most of them will also\n    be\
    \ attached to other TRDs (since most of the organizations involved\n    in widget\
    \ manufacture and research will also be involved in other\n    activities). We\
    \ can therefore expect that many or most of the\n    organizations in the widget\
    \ group are dual-homed, with one attachment\n    for widget-associated communications\
    \ and the other attachment for\n    other types of communications. Let's also\
    \ assume that the total number\n    of organizations involved in the widget group\
    \ is small enough that\n    it is reasonable to maintain a routing table containing\
    \ one entry\n    per organization, but that they are distributed throughout a\
    \ larger\n    internet with many millions of (mostly not widget-associated) routing\n\
    \    domains.\n    With the third approach, each multi-homed organization in the\
    \ widget\n    group would make use of an address assignment based on its other\n\
    \    attachment(s) to TRDs (the attachments not associated with the widget\n \
    \   group). The widget backbone would need to maintain routes to the\n    routing\
    \ domains associated with the various member organizations.\n    Similarly, all\
    \ members of the widget group would need to maintain a\n    table of routes to\
    \ the other members via the widget backbone. However,\n    since the widget backbone\
    \ does not inform other general worldwide TRDs\n    of what addresses it can reach\
    \ (since the backbone is not intended\n    for use by other outside organizations),\
    \ the relatively large set\n    of routing prefixes needs to be maintained only\
    \ in a limited number\n    of places. The addresses assigned to the various organizations\
    \ which\n    are members of the widget group would provide a ``default route''\
    \ via\n    each members other attachments to TRDs, while allowing communications\n\
    \    within the widget group to use the preferred path.\n    A fourth solution\
    \ involves assignment of a particular address prefix\n    for routing domains\
    \ which are attached to precisely two (or more)\n    specific routing domains.\

    \ Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    large number of customers in common\
    \ (i.e., there are a large number\n    of routing domains which are attached to\
    \ both). Rather than getting\n    two address prefixes (such as two AA values\
    \ assigned under the GOSIP\n    address space) these organizations could obtain\
    \ three prefixes. Those\n    routing domains which are attached to NorthSouthNet\
    \ but not attached\n    to SouthNorthNet obtain an address assignment based on\
    \ one of the\n    prefixes. Those routing domains which are attached to SouthNorthNet\n\
    \    but not to NorthSouthNet would obtain an address based on the second\n  \
    \  prefix. Finally, those routing domains which are multi-homed to both\n    of\
    \ these networks would obtain an address based on the third prefix.\n    Each\
    \ of these two TRDs would then advertise two prefixes to other\n    TRDs, one\
    \ prefix for leaf routing domains attached to it only, and one\n    prefix for\
    \ leaf routing domains attached to both.\n    This fourth solution is likely to\
    \ be important when use of public data\n    networks becomes more common. In particular,\
    \ it is likely that at some\n    point in the future a substantial percentage\
    \ of all routing domains\n    will be attached to public data networks. In this\
    \ case, nearly all\n    government-sponsored networks (such as some current NSFNET\
    \ regionals)\n    may have a set of customers which overlaps substantially with\
    \ the\n    public networks.\n    There are therefore a number of possible solutions\
    \ to the problem\n    of assigning NSAP addresses to multi-homed routing domains.\
    \ Each\n    of these solutions has very different advantages and disadvantages.\n\
    \    Each solution places a different real (i.e., financial) cost on the\n   \
    \ multi-homed organizations, and on the TRDs (including those to which\n    the\
    \ multi-homed organizations are not attached).\n    In addition, most of the solutions\
    \ described also highlight the need\n    for each TRD to develop policy on whether\
    \ and under what conditions\n    to accept addresses that are not based on its\
    \ own address prefix, and\n    how such non-local addresses will be treated. For\
    \ example, a somewhat\n    conservative policy might be that non-local NSAP prefixes\
    \ will be\n    accepted from any attached leaf RD, but not advertised to other\
    \ TRDs.\n    In a less conservative policy, a TRD might accept such non-local\n\
    \    prefixes and agree to exchange them with a defined set of other TRDs\n  \
    \  (this set could be an a priori group of TRDs that have something in\n    common\
    \ such as geographical location, or the result of an agreement\n    specific to\
    \ the requesting leaf RD). Various policies involve real\n    costs to TRDs, which\
    \ may be reflected in those policies.\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon        \

    \ Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    5.5   Private Links\n    The discussion\
    \ up to this point concentrates on the relationship\n    between NSAP addresses\
    \ and routing between various routing domains\n    over transit routing domains,\
    \ where each transit routing domain\n    interconnects a large number of routing\
    \ domains and offers a more-or-\n    less public service.\n    However, there\
    \ may also exist a large number of private point-to-point\n    links which interconnect\
    \ two private routing domains. In many cases\n    such private point-to-point\
    \ links may be limited to forwarding packets\n    directly between the two private\
    \ routing domains.\n    For example, let's suppose that the XYZ corporation does\
    \ a lot of\n    business with MBII. In this case, XYZ and MBII may contract with\
    \ a\n    carrier to provide a private link between the two corporations, where\n\
    \    this link may only be used for packets whose source is within one of\n  \
    \  the two corporations, and whose destination is within the other of the\n  \
    \  two corporations. Finally, suppose that the point-to-point link is\n    connected\
    \ between a single router (router X) within XYZ corporation\n    and a single\
    \ router (router M) within MBII. It is therefore necessary\n    to configure router\
    \ X to know which addresses can be reached over\n    this link (specifically,\
    \ all addresses reachable in MBII). Similarly,\n    it is necessary to configure\
    \ router M to know which addresses can be\n    reached over this link (specifically,\
    \ all addresses reachable in XYZ\n    Corporation).\n    The important observation\
    \ to be made here is that such private\n    links may be ignored for the purpose\
    \ of NSAP allocation, and do not\n    pose a problem for routing. This is because\
    \ the routing information\n    associated with private links is not propagated\
    \ throughout the\n    internet, and therefore does not need to be collapsed into\
    \ a TRD's\n    prefix.\n    In our example, lets suppose that the XYZ corporation\
    \ has a single\n    connection to an NSFNET regional, and has therefore received\
    \ an\n    address allocation from the space administered by that regional.\n \
    \   Similarly, let's suppose that MBII, as an international corporation\n    with\
    \ connections to six different backbones or regionals, has chosen\n    the second\
    \ solution from Section 5.4, and therefore has obtained six\n    different address\
    \ allocations. In this case, all addresses reachable\n    in the XYZ Corporation\
    \ can be described by a single address prefix\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon\
    \                                    [Page 29]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI\
    \ NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    (implying that router M only\
    \ needs to be configured with a single\n    address prefix to represent the addresses\
    \ reachable over this point-\n    to-point link). All addresses reachable in MBII\
    \ can be described by\n    six address prefixes (implying that router X needs\
    \ to be configured\n    with six address prefixes to represent the addresses reachable\
    \ over\n    the point-to-point link).\n    In some cases, such private point-to-point\
    \ links may be permitted\n    to forward traffic for a small number of other routing\
    \ domains,\n    such as closely affiliated organizations. This will increase the\n\
    \    configuration requirements slightly. However, provided that the number\n\
    \    of organizations using the link is relatively small, then this still\n  \
    \  does not represent a significant problem.\n    Note that the relationship between\
    \ routing and NSAP addressing\n    described in other sections of this paper is\
    \ concerned with problems\n    in scaling caused by large, essentially public\
    \ transit routing domains\n    which interconnect a large number of routing domains.\
    \ However, for\n    the purpose of NSAP allocation, private point-to-point links\
    \ which\n    interconnect only a small number of private routing domains do not\n\
    \    pose a problem, and may be ignored. For example, this implies that\n    a\
    \ single leaf routing domain which has a single connection to a\n    ``public''\
    \ backbone (e.g., the NSFNET), plus a number of private\n    point-to-point links\
    \ to other leaf routing domains, can be treated\n    as if it were single-homed\
    \ to the backbone for the purpose of NSAP\n    address allocation.\n    5.6  \
    \ Zero-Homed Routing Domains\n    Currently, a very large number of organizations\
    \ have internal\n    communications networks which are not connected to any external\n\
    \    network. Such organizations may, however, have a number of private\n    point-to-point\
    \ links that they use for communications with other\n    organizations. Such organizations\
    \ do not participate in global\n    routing, but are satisfied with reachability\
    \ to those organizations\n    with which they have established private links.\
    \ These are referred to\n    as zero-homed routing domains.\n    Zero-homed routing\
    \ domains can be considered as the degenerate case\n    of routing domains with\
    \ private links, as discussed in the previous\n    section, and do not pose a\
    \ problem for inter-domain routing. As above,\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon\

    \ NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    the routing information exchanged\
    \ across the private links sees very\n    limited distribution, usually only to\
    \ the RD at the other end of the\n    link. Thus, there are no address abstraction\
    \ requirements beyond those\n    inherent in the address prefixes exchanged across\
    \ the private link.\n    However, it is important that zero-homed routing domains\
    \ use valid\n    globally unique NSAP addresses. Suppose that the zero-homed routing\n\
    \    domain is connected through a private link to an RD. Further, this\n    RD\
    \ participates in an internet that subscribes to the global OSI\n    addressing\
    \ plan (i.e., Addendum 2 to ISO8348). This RD must be able\n    to distinguish\
    \ between the zero-homed routing domain's NSAPs and any\n    other NSAPs that\
    \ it may need to route to. The only way this can be\n    guaranteed is if the\
    \ zero-homed routing domain uses globally unique\n    NSAPs.\n    5.7   Transition\
    \ Issues\n    Allocation of NSAP addresses based on connectivity to TRDs is\n\
    \    important to allow scaling of inter-domain routing to an internet\n    containing\
    \ millions of routing domains. However, such address\n    allocation based on\
    \ topology also implies that a change in topology\n    may result in a change\
    \ of address.\n    This need to allow for change in addresses is a natural, inevitable\n\
    \    consequence of routing data abstraction. The basic notion of routing\n  \
    \  data abstraction is that there is some correspondence between the\n    address\
    \ and where a system (i.e., a routing domain, area, or end\n    system) is located.\
    \ Thus if the system moves, in some cases the\n    address will have to change.\
    \ If it were possible to change the\n    connectivity between routing domains\
    \ without changing the addresses,\n    then it would clearly be necessary to keep\
    \ track of the location of\n    that routing domain on an individual basis.\n\
    \    In the short term, due to the rapid growth and increased commer-\n    cialization\
    \ of the Internet, it is possible that the topology may be\n    relatively volatile.\
    \ This implies that planning for address transition\n    is very important. Fortunately,\
    \ there are a number of steps which can\n    be taken to help ease the effort\
    \ required for address transition. A\n    complete description of address transition\
    \ issues is outside of the\n    scope of this paper. However, a very brief outline\
    \ of some transition\n    issues is contained in this section.\n    Colella, Gardner,\
    \ & Callon                                    [Page 31]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines\
    \ for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    Also note that the possible\
    \ requirement to transition addresses\n    based on changes in topology imply\
    \ that it is valuable to anticipate\n    the future topology changes before finalizing\
    \ a plan for address\n    allocation. For example, in the case of a routing domain\
    \ which is\n    initially single-homed, but which is expecting to become multi-homed\n\
    \    in the future, it may be advantageous to assign NSAP addresses based\n  \
    \  on the anticipated future topology.\n    In general, it will not be practical\
    \ to transition the NSAP addresses\n    assigned to a routing domain in an instantaneous\
    \ ``change the address\n    at midnight'' manner. Instead, a gradual transition\
    \ is required in\n    which both the old and the new addresses will remain valid\
    \ for a\n    limited period of time. During the transition period, both the old\
    \ and\n    new addresses are accepted by the end systems in the routing domain,\n\
    \    and both old and new addresses must result in correct routing of\n    packets\
    \ to the destination.\n    Provision for transition has already been built into\
    \ DIS10589.\n    As described in Section 3, DIS10589 allows multiple addresses\
    \ to\n    be assigned to each area specifically for the purpose of easing\n  \
    \  transition.\n    Similarly, there are provisions in OSI for the autoconfiguration\
    \ of\n    area addresses. This allows OSI end systems to find out their area\n\
    \    addresses automatically by observing the ISO9542 IS-Hello packets\n    transmitted\
    \ by routers. If the ID portion of the address is assigned\n    by using IEEE\
    \ style ``stamped in PROM at birth'' identifiers, then\n    an end system can\
    \ reconfigure its entire NSAP address automatically\n    without the need for\
    \ manual intervention. However, routers will still\n    need manual address reconfiguration.\n\
    \    During the transition period, it is important that packets using\n    the\
    \ old address be forwarded correctly, even when the topology has\n    changed.\
    \ This is facilitated by the use of ``best match'' inter-domain\n    routing.\n\
    \    For example, suppose that the XYZ Corporation was previously connected\n\
    \    only to the NorthSouthNet NSFNET regional. The XYZ Corporation\n    therefore\
    \ went off to the NorthSouthNet administration and got a\n    routing domain assignment\
    \ based on the AA value assigned to the\n    NorthSouthNet regional under the\
    \ GOSIP address space. However, for\n    a variety of reasons, the XYZ Corporation\
    \ decided to terminate its\n    association with the NorthSouthNet, and instead\
    \ connect directly to\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                        \
    \            [Page 32]\n    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the\
    \ Internet  July 1991\n    the NewCommercialNet public data network. Thus the\
    \ XYZ Corporation\n    now has a new address assignment under the ANSI address\
    \ assigned to\n    the NewCommercialNet. The old address for the XYZ Corporation\
    \ would\n    seem to imply that traffic for the XYZ Corporation should be routed\
    \ to\n    the NorthSouthNet, which no longer has any direct connection with XYZ\n\
    \    Corporation.\n    If the old TRD (NorthSouthNet) and the new TRD (NewCommercialNet)\
    \ are\n    adjacent and cooperative, then this transition is easy to accomplish.\n\
    \    In this case, packets routed to the XYZ Corporation using the old\n    address\
    \ assignment could be routed to the NorthSouthNet, which would\n    directly forward\
    \ them to the NewCommercialNet, which would in turn\n    forward them to XYZ Corporation.\
    \ In this case only NorthSouthNet\n    and NewCommercialNet need be aware of the\
    \ fact that the old address\n    refers to a destination which is no longer directly\
    \ attached to\n    NorthSouthNet.\n    If the old TRD and the new TRD are not\
    \ adjacent, then the situation\n    is a bit more complex, but there are still\
    \ several possible ways to\n    forward traffic correctly.\n    If the old TRD\
    \ and the new TRD are themselves connected by other\n    cooperative transit routing\
    \ domains, then these intermediate domains\n    may agree to forward traffic for\
    \ XYZ correctly. For example, suppose\n    that NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet\
    \ are not directly connected,\n    but that they are both directly connected to\
    \ the NSFNET backbone.\n    In this case, all three of NorthSouthNet, NewCommercialNet,\
    \ and\n    the NSFNET backbone would need to maintain a special entry for XYZ\n\
    \    corporation so that traffic to XYZ using the old address allocation\n   \
    \ would be forwarded via NewCommercialNet. However, other routing\n    domains\
    \ would not need to be aware of the new location for XYZ\n    Corporation.\n \
    \   Suppose that the old TRD and the new TRD are separated by a non-\n    cooperative\
    \ routing domain, or by a long path of routing domains. In\n    this case, the\
    \ old TRD could encapsulate traffic to XYZ Corporation in\n    order to deliver\
    \ such packets to the correct backbone.\n    Also, those locations which do a\
    \ significant amount of business with\n    XYZ Corporation could have a specific\
    \ entry in their routing tables\n    added to ensure optimal routing of packets\
    \ to XYZ. For example,\n    suppose that another commercial backbone ``OldCommercialNet''\
    \ has a\n    large number of customers which exchange traffic with XYZ Corporation,\n\
    \    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                                    [Page 33]\n\
    \    RFC 1237  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n\
    \    and that this third TRD is directly connected to both NorthSouthNet\n   \
    \ and NewCommercialNet. In this case OldCommercialNet will continue\n    to have\
    \ a single entry in its routing tables for other traffic\n    destined for NorthSouthNet,\
    \ but may choose to add one additional (more\n    specific) entry to ensure that\
    \ packets sent to XYZ Corporation's old\n    address are routed correctly.\n \
    \   Whichever method is used to ease address transition, the goal is that\n  \
    \  knowledge relating XYZ to its old address that is held throughout the\n   \
    \ global internet would eventually be replaced with the new information.\n   \
    \ It is reasonable to expect this to take weeks or months and will be\n    accomplished\
    \ through the distributed directory system. Discussion of\n    the directory,\
    \ along with other address transition techniques such as\n    automatically informing\
    \ the source of a changed address, are outside\n    the scope of this paper.\n\
    \    6   Recommendations\n    We anticipate that the current exponential growth\
    \ of the Internet will\n    continue or accelerate for the foreseeable future.\
    \ In addition, we\n    anticipate a rapid internationalization of the Internet.\
    \ The ability\n    of routing to scale is dependent upon the use of data abstraction\n\
    \    based on hierarchical NSAP addresses. As OSI is introduced in the\n    Internet,\
    \ it is therefore essential to choose a hierarchical structure\n    for NSAP addresses\
    \ with great care.\n    It is in the best interests of the internetworking community\
    \ that the\n    cost of operations be kept to a minimum where possible. In the\
    \ case of\n    NSAP allocation, this again means that routing data abstraction\
    \ must\n    be encouraged.\n    In order for data abstraction to be possible,\
    \ the assignment of NSAP\n    addresses must be accomplished in a manner which\
    \ is consistent with\n    the actual physical topology of the Internet. For example,\
    \ in those\n    cases where organizational and administrative boundaries are not\n\
    \    related to actual network topology, address assignment based on such\n  \
    \  organization boundaries is not recommended.\n    The intra-domain IS-IS routing\
    \ protocol allows for information\n    abstraction to be maintained at two levels:\
    \ systems are grouped\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                        \

    \ Internet  July 1991\n    into areas, and areas are interconnected to form a\
    \ routing domain.\n    For zero-homed and single-homed routing domains (which\
    \ are expected\n    to remain zero-homed or single-homed), we recommend that the\
    \ NSAP\n    addresses assigned for OSI use within a single routing domain use\n\
    \    a single address prefix assigned to that domain. Specifically, this\n   \
    \ allows the set of all NSAP addresses reachable within a single domain\n    to\
    \ be fully described via a single prefix.\n    We anticipate that the total number\
    \ of routing domains existing on a\n    worldwide OSI Internet to be great enough\
    \ that additional levels of\n    hierarchical data abstraction beyond the routing\
    \ domain level will be\n    necessary.\n    In most cases, network topology will\
    \ have a close relationship with\n    national boundaries. For example, the degree\
    \ of network connectivity\n    will often be greater within a single country than\
    \ between countries.\n    It is therefore appropriate to make specific recommendations\
    \ based on\n    national boundaries, with the understanding that there may be\
    \ specific\n    situations where these general recommendations need to be modified.\n\
    \    6.1   Recommendations Specific to U.S. Parts of the Internet\n    NSAP addresses\

    \ primarily on two address prefixes: the IDP format\n    used by NIST for GOSIP\
    \ Version 2, and the DCC=840 format defined by\n    ANSI.\n    We anticipate that,\
    \ in the U.S., public interconnectivity between\n    private routing domains will\
    \ be provided by a diverse set of TRDs,\n    including (but not necessarily limited\
    \ to):\n       * the NSFNET backbone;\n       * a number of NSFNET regional networks;\
    \ and,\n       * a number of commercial Public Data Networks.\n    It is also\
    \ expected that these networks will not be interconnected\n    in a strictly hierarchical\
    \ manner (for example, there is expected\n    to be direct connectivity between\

    \ interconnect\n    a wide variety of routing domains, each of which may comprise\
    \ a single\n    corporation, part of a corporation, a university campus, a government\n\
    \    agency, or other organizational unit.\n    In addition, some private corporations\
    \ may be expected to make use of\n    dedicated private TRDs for communication\
    \ within their own corporation.\n    We anticipate that the great majority of\
    \ routing domains will be\n    attached to only one of the TRDs. This will permit\
    \ hierarchical\n    address abbreviation based on TRD. We therefore strongly recommend\n\
    \    that addresses be assigned hierarchically, based on address prefixes\n  \
    \  assigned to individual TRDs.\n    For the GOSIP address format, this implies\
    \ that Administrative\n    Authority (AA) identifiers should be assigned to all\
    \ TRDs (explicitly\n    including the NSFNET backbone, the NSFNET regionals, and\
    \ other major\n    government backbones). For those leaf routing domains which\
    \ are\n    connected to a single TRD, they should be assigned a Routing Domain\n\
    \    (RD) value from the space assigned to that TRD.\n    We recommend that all\
    \ TRDs explicitly be involved in the task of\n    address administration for those\
    \ leaf routing domains which are\n    single-homed to them. This will offer a\
    \ valuable service to their\n    customers, and will also greatly reduce the resources\
    \ (including\n    human and network resources) necessary for that TRD to take\
    \ part in\n    inter-domain routing.\n    Each TRD should develop policy on whether\
    \ and under what conditions to\n    accept addresses that are not based on its\
    \ own address prefix, and how\n    such non-local addresses will be treated. Policies\
    \ should reflect the\n    issue of cost associated with implementing such policies.\n\
    \    We recommend that a similar hierarchical model be used for NSAP\n    addresses\
    \ using the DCC-based address format. The structure for\n    DCC=840-based NSAPs\
    \ is provided in Section A.2.\n    For routing domains which are not attached\
    \ to any publically-\n    available TRD, there is not the same urgent need for\
    \ hierarchical\n    address abbreviation. We do not, therefore, make any additional\n\
    \    recommendations for such ``isolated'' routing domains, except to\n    Colella,\
    \ Gardner, & Callon                                    [Page 36]\n    RFC 1237\
    \  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet  July 1991\n    note that\
    \ there is no technical reason to preclude assignment of\n    GOSIP AA identifier\
    \ values or ANSI organization identifiers to such\n    domains. Where such domains\
    \ are connected to other domains by private\n    point-to-point links, and where\
    \ such links are used solely for routing\n    between the two domains that they\
    \ interconnect, again no additional\n    technical problems relating to address\
    \ abbreviation is caused by such\n    a link, and no specific additional recommendations\
    \ are necessary.\n    6.2   Recommendations Specific to Non-U.S. Parts of the\
    \ Internet\n    For the part of the Internet which is outside of the U.S., it\
    \ is\n    recommended that the DSP format be structured similarly to that\n  \
    \  specified within GOSIP Version 2 no matter whether the addresses are\n    based\
    \ on DCC or ICD format.\n    Further, in order to allow aggregation of NSAPs at\
    \ national boundaries\n    into as few prefixes as possible, we further recommend\
    \ that NSAPs\n    allocated to routing domains should be assigned based on each\
    \ routing\n    domain's connectivity to a national Internet backbone.\n    6.3\
    \   Recommendations for Multi-Homed Routing Domains\n    Some routing domains\
    \ will be attached to multiple TRDs within the\n    same country, or to TRDs within\
    \ multiple different countries. We\n    refer to these as ``multi-homed'' routing\
    \ domains. Clearly the strict\n    hierarchical model discussed above does not\
    \ neatly handle such routing\n    domains.\n    There are several possible ways\
    \ that these multi-homed routing domains\n    may be handled. Each of these methods\
    \ vary with respect to the amount\n    of information that must be maintained\
    \ for inter-domain routing\n    and also with respect to the inter-domain routes.\
    \ In addition, the\n    organization that will bear the brunt of this cost varies\
    \ with the\n    possible solutions. For example, the solutions vary with respect\
    \ to:\n       * resources used within routers within the TRDs;\n       * administrative\
    \ cost on TRD personnel; and,\n    Colella, Gardner, & Callon                \

    \ inter-domain routing\n         information within leaf routing domains.\n  \
    \  Also, the solution used may affect the actual routes which packets\n    follow,\
    \ and may effect the availability of backup routes when the\n    primary route\
    \ fails.\n    For these reasons it is not possible to mandate a single solution\
    \ for\n    all situations. Rather, economic considerations will require a variety\n\
    \    of solutions for different routing domains, regionals, and backbones.\n \

    \ NSAPs\n    NSAPs represent the endpoints of communication through the Network\n\
    \    Layer and must be globally unique [5]. Addendum 2 to ISO8348 defines\n  \
    \  the semantics of the NSAP and the abstract syntaxes in which the\n    semantics\
    \ of the Network address can be expressed [14].\n    The NSAP consists of the\
    \ initial domain part (IDP) and the domain\n    specific part (DSP). The initial\
    \ domain part of the NSAP consists\n    of an authority and format identifier\
    \ (AFI) and an initial domain\n    identifier (IDI). The AFI specifies the format\
    \ of the IDI, the network\n    addressing authority responsible for allocating\
    \ values of the IDI,\n    and the abstract syntax of the DSP. The IDI specifies\
    \ the addressing\n    subdomain from which values of the DSP are allocated and\
    \ the network\n    addressing authority responsible for allocating values of the\
    \ DSP from\n    that domain. The structure and semantics of the DSP are determined\
    \ by\n    the authority identified by the IDI. Figure 3 shows the NSAP address\n\

    \   For OSI networks in the U.S., portions of the ICD subdomain are\n    available\
    \ for use through the U.S. Government, and the DCC subdo-\n    main is available\
    \ for use through The American National Standards\n    Institute (ANSI). The British\
    \ Standards Institute is the registration\n    authority for the ICD subdomain,\
    \ and has registered four IDIs for\n    the U.S. Government: those used for GOSIP,\
    \ DoD, OSINET, and the OSI\n    Implementors Workshop. ANSI, as the U.S. ISO Member\
    \ Body, is the\n    registration authority for the DCC domain in the United States.\
    \ (The\n    U.S. Government is registered as an organization by ANSI under the\n\
    \    DCC, and in turn, will register object identifiers and X.400 names\n    under\
    \ this authority.)\n    A.1   GOSIP Version 2 NSAPs\n    GOSIP Version 2 makes\
    \ available for government use an NSAP addressing\n    subdomain with a corresponding\
    \ address format as illustrated in\n    Figure 2 on page 16. The ``47'' signifies\
    \ that it is based on the ICD\n    format and uses a binary syntax for the DSP.\
    \ The 0005 is an IDI value\n    which has been assigned to the U.S. Government.\
    \ Although GOSIP Version\n    2 NSAPs are intended primarily for U.S. government\
    \ use, requests from\n    non-government and non-U.S. organizations will be considered\
    \ on a\n    case-by-case basis.\n    The format for the DSP under ICD=0005 has\
    \ been established by the\n    National Institute of Standards and Technology\
    \ (NIST), the authority\n    for the ICD=0005 domain, in GOSIP Version 2 [4] (see\
    \ Figure 2,\n    page 16). NIST has delegated the authority to register AA identifiers\n\
    \    for GOSIP Version 2 NSAPs to the General Services Administration\n    (GSA).\n\
    \    Addendum 2 to ISO8348 allows a maximum length of 20 octets for the\n    NSAP.\
    \ The AFI of 47 occupies one octet, and the IDI of 0005 occupies\n    two octets.\
    \ The DSP is encoded as binary as indicated by the AFI of\n    47. One octet is\

    \ six octets for the System Identifier,\n    and one octet for the NSAP selector.\
    \ Note that two octets have been\n    reserved to accommodate future growth and\
    \ to provide additional\n    flexibility for inter-domain routing. The last seven\
    \ octets of the\n    GOSIP NSAP format are structured in accordance with DIS10589\
    \ [17], the\n    intra-domain IS-IS routing protocol. The DSP Format Identifier\
    \ (DFI)\n    identifies the format of the remaining DSP structure and may be used\n\
    \    in the future to identify additional DSP formats; the value 80h in the\n\
    \    DFI identifies the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure.\n    The Administrative\
    \ Authority identifier names the administrative\n    authority which is responsible\
    \ for registration within its domain.\n    The administrative authority may delegate\
    \ the responsibility for\n    registering areas to the routing domains, and the\
    \ routing domains\n    may delegate the authority to register System Identifiers\
    \ to the\n    areas. The main responsibility of a registration authority at any\n\
    \    level of the addressing hierarchy is to assure that names of entities\n \
    \   are unambiguous, i.e., no two entities have the same name. The\n    registration\
    \ authority is also responsible for advertising the names.\n    A routing domain\
    \ is a set of end systems and intermediate systems\n    which operate according\
    \ to the same routing procedures and is wholly\n    contained within a single\
    \ administrative domain. An area uniquely\n    identifies a subdomain of the routing\
    \ domain. The system identifier\n    names a unique system within an area. The\
    \ value of the system\n    field may be a physical address (SNPA) or a logical\
    \ value. Address\n    resolution between the NSAP and the SNPA may be accomplished\
    \ by an ES-\n    IS protocol [13], locally administered tables, or mapping functions.\n\
    \    The NSAP selector field identifies the end user of the network layer\n  \
    \  service, i.e., a transport layer entity.\n    A.1.1   Application for Administrative\

    \         authority (resulting in additional levels of hierarchy in the\n    \

    \ of NSAPs that it\n         specifies are unique, current, and accurate.\n  \
    \     * The authority should ensure that procedures exist for dissemi-\n     \
    \    nating NSAPs to routing domains and to areas within each routing\n      \
    \   domain.\n       * The systems administrator must determine whether a logical\
    \ or a\n         physical address should be used in the System Identifier field\n\
    \         (Figure2, page 16). An example of a physical address is a 48-bit\n \
    \        MAC address; a logical address is merely a number that meets the\n  \
    \       uniqueness requirements for the System Identifier field, but bears\n \
    \        no relationship to an address on a physical subnetwork.\n       * The\

    \ NSAPs\n    NSAPs from the Data Country Code (DCC) subdomain will also be common\n\
    \    in the international Internet. Currently, there is a draft proposed\n   \

    \ DCC=840 [1]. Subsequent to an upcoming ANSI X3 Committee ballot,\n    the dpANS\
    \ will be distributed for public comment.\n    In the dpANS, the DSP structure\
    \ is identical to that specified in\n    GOSIP Version 2, with the Administrative\
    \ Authority identifier replaced\n    by the numeric form of the ANSI-registered\
    \ organization name, as shown\n    in Figure 4.\n    Referring to Figure 4, when\
    \ the value of the AFI is 39, the IDI\n    denotes an ISO DCC and the abstract\
    \ syntax of the DSP is binary\n    octets. The value of the IDI for the U.S. is\
    \ 840, the three-digit\n    numeric code for the United States under ISO3166 [9].\
    \ The numeric\n    form of organization name is analogous to the Administrative\

    \ Application for Numeric Organization Name\n    The procedures for registration\
    \ of numeric organization names in\n    the U.S. have been defined and are operational.\
    \ To register a\n    numeric organization name, the applicant must submit a request\
    \ for\n    registration and the $1,000 (U.S.) fee to the registration authority,\n\
    \    the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI will register a\n\
    \    numeric value, along with the information supplied for registration,\n  \
    \  in the registration database. The registration information will be\n    sent\
    \ to the applicant within ten working days. The values for numeric\n    organization\
    \ names are assigned beginning at 113527.\n    The application form for registering\
    \ a numeric organization name may\n    be obtained from the ANSI Registration\
    \ Coordinator at the following\n    address:\n               Registration Coordinator\n\

    \ (tel)\n               +1 212 398 0023 (fax)\n    Once an organization has registered\
    \ with ANSI, it becomes a registra-\n    tion authority itself. In turn, it may\
    \ delegate registration authority\n    to routing domains, and these may make\
    \ further delegations, for in-\n    stance, from routing domains to areas. Again,\
    \ the responsibilities of\n    each Registration Authority are to assure that\
    \ NSAPs within the domain\n    are unambiguous and to advertise them as applicable.\n\
    \    A.3   Summary of Administrative Requirements\n    NSAPs must be globally\
    \ unique, and an organization may assure this\n    uniqueness for OSI addresses\
    \ in two ways. The organization may\n    apply to GSA for an Administrative Authority\
    \ identifier. Although\n    registration of Administrative Authority identifiers\
    \ by GSA primarily\n    serves U.S. Government agencies, requests for non-Government\
    \ and\n    non-U.S. organizations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\
    \    Alternatively, the organization may apply to ANSI for a numeric\n    Colella,\

    \ name. In either case, the organization becomes the\n    registration authority\
    \ for its domain and can register NSAPs or\n    delegate the authority to do so.\n\
    \    In the case of GOSIP Version 2 NSAPs, the complete DSP structure is\n   \
    \ given in GOSIP Version 2. For ANSI DCC-based NSAPs, there is a draft\n    proposed\
    \ American National Standard that specifies the DSP structure\n    under DCC=840.\
