  - "Introduction\n   A commonly asked question is \"What is the Internet?\" The reason\
    \ such\n   a question gets asked so often is because there's no agreed upon\n\
    \   answer that neatly sums up the Internet. The Internet can be thought\n   about\
    \ in relation to its common protocols, as a physical collection\n   of routers\
    \ and circuits, as a set of shared resources, or even as an\n   attitude about\
    \ interconnecting and intercommunication. Some common\n   definitions given in\
    \ the past include:\n      * a network of networks based on the TCP/IP protocols,\n\
    \      * a community of people who use and develop those networks,\n      * a\
    \ collection of resources that can be reached from those\n        networks.\n\
    \   Today's Internet is a global resource connecting millions of users\n   that\
    \ began as an experiment over 20 years ago by the U.S.  Department\n   of Defense.\
    \ While the networks that make up the Internet are based on\n   a standard set\
    \ of protocols (a mutually agreed upon method of\n   communication between parties),\
    \ the Internet also has gateways to\n   networks and services that are based on\
    \ other protocols.\n   To help answer the question more completely, the rest of\
    \ this paper\n   contains an updated second chapter from \"The Whole Internet\
    \ User's\n   Guide and Catalog\" by Ed Krol (1992) that gives a more thorough\n\
    \   explanation. (The excerpt is published through the gracious\n   permission\

  - "Catalog\")\n   The Internet was born about 20 years ago, trying to connect together\n\
    \   a U.S. Defense Department network called the ARPAnet and various\n   other\
    \ radio and satellite networks. The ARPAnet was an experimental\n   network designed\
    \ to support military research--in particular,\n   research about how to build\
    \ networks that could withstand partial\n   outages (like bomb attacks) and still\
    \ function.  (Think about this\n   when I describe how the network works; it may\
    \ give you some insight\n   into the design of the Internet.) In the ARPAnet model,\
    \ communication\n   always occurs between a source and a destination computer.\
    \ The\n   network itself is assumed to be unreliable; any portion of the\n   network\
    \ could disappear at any moment (pick your favorite\n   catastrophe--these days\
    \ backhoes cutting cables are more of a threat\n   than bombs). It was designed\
    \ to require the minimum of information\n   from the computer clients. To send\
    \ a message on the network, a\n   computer only had to put its data in an envelope,\
    \ called an Internet\n   Protocol (IP) packet, and \"address\" the packets correctly.\
    \ The\n   communicating computers--not the network itself--were also given the\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the communication was accomplished. The\n  \
    \ philosophy was that every computer on the network could talk, as a\n   peer,\
    \ with any other computer.\n   These decisions may sound odd, like the assumption\
    \ of an \"unreliable\"\n   network, but history has proven that most of them were\
    \ reasonably\n   correct. Although the Organization for International Standardization\n\
    \   (ISO) was spending years designing the ultimate standard for computer\n  \
    \ networking, people could not wait. Internet developers in the US, UK\n   and\
    \ Scandinavia, responding to market pressures, began to put their\n   IP software\
    \ on every conceivable type of computer. It became the only\n   practical method\
    \ for computers from different manufacturers to\n   communicate. This was attractive\
    \ to the government and universities,\n   which didn't have policies saying that\
    \ all computers must be bought\n   from the same vendor. Everyone bought whichever\
    \ computer they liked,\n   and expected the computers to work together over the\
    \ network.\n   At about the same time as the Internet was coming into being,\n\
    \   Ethernet local area networks (\"LANs\") were developed. This technology\n\
    \   matured quietly, until desktop workstations became available around\n   1983.\
    \ Most of these workstations came with Berkeley UNIX, which\n   included IP networking\
    \ software. This created a new demand: rather\n   than connecting to a single\
    \ large timesharing computer per site,\n   organizations wanted to connect the\
    \ ARPAnet to their entire local\n   network. This would allow all the computers\
    \ on that LAN to access\n   ARPAnet facilities. About the same time, other organizations\
    \ started\n   building their own networks using the same communications protocols\n\
    \   as the ARPAnet: namely, IP and its relatives. It became obvious that\n   if\
    \ these networks could talk together, users on one network could\n   communicate\
    \ with those on another; everyone would benefit.\n   One of the most important\
    \ of these newer networks was the NSFNET,\n   commissioned by the National Science\
    \ Foundation (NSF), an agency of\n   the U.S. government. In the late 80's the\
    \ NSF created five\n   supercomputer centers. Up to this point, the world's fastest\n\
    \   computers had only been available to weapons developers and a few\n   researchers\
    \ from very large corporations. By creating supercomputer\n   centers, the NSF\
    \ was making these resources available for any\n   scholarly research. Only five\
    \ centers were created because they were\n   so expensive--so they had to be shared.\
    \ This created a communications\n   problem: they needed a way to connect their\
    \ centers together and to\n   allow the clients of these centers to access them.\
    \  At first, the NSF\n   tried to use the ARPAnet for communications, but this\
    \ strategy failed\n   because of bureaucracy and staffing problems.\n   In response,\
    \ NSF decided to build its own network, based on the\n   ARPAnet's IP technology.\
    \ It connected the centers with 56,000 bit per\n   second (56k bps) telephone\
    \ lines.  (This is roughly the ability to\n   transfer two full typewritten pages\
    \ per second.  That's slow by\n   modern standards, but was reasonably fast in\
    \ the mid 80's.)  It was\n   obvious, however, that if they tried to connect every\
    \ university\n   directly to a supercomputing center, they would go broke. You\
    \ pay for\n   these telephone lines by the mile. One line per campus with a\n\
    \   supercomputing center at the hub, like spokes on a bike wheel, adds\n   up\
    \ to lots of miles of phone lines. Therefore, they decided to create\n   regional\
    \ networks. In each area of the country, schools would be\n   connected to their\
    \ nearest neighbor. Each chain was connected to a\n   supercomputer center at\
    \ one point and the centers were connected\n   together. With this configuration,\
    \ any computer could eventually\n   communicate with any other by forwarding the\
    \ conversation through its\n   neighbors.\n   This solution was successful--and,\
    \ like any successful solution, a\n   time came when it no longer worked. Sharing\
    \ supercomputers also\n   allowed the connected sites to share a lot of other\
    \ things not\n   related to the centers. Suddenly these schools had a world of\
    \ data\n   and collaborators at their fingertips. The network's traffic\n   increased\
    \ until, eventually, the computers controlling the network\n   and the telephone\
    \ lines connecting them were overloaded. In 1987, a\n   contract to manage and\
    \ upgrade the network was awarded to Merit\n   Network Inc., which ran Michigan's\
    \ educational network, in\n   partnership with IBM and MCI. The old network was\
    \ replaced with\n   faster telephone lines (by a factor of 20), with faster computers\
    \ to\n   control it.\n   The process of running out of horsepower and getting\
    \ bigger engines\n   and better roads continues to this day. Unlike changes to\
    \ the highway\n   system, however, most of these changes aren't noticed by the\
    \ people\n   trying to use the Internet to do real work. You won't go to your\n\
    \   office, log in to your computer, and find a message saying that the\n   Internet\
    \ will be inaccessible for the next six months because of\n   improvements. Perhaps\
    \ even more important: the process of running out\n   of capacity and improving\
    \ the network has created a technology that's\n   extremely mature and practical.\
    \ The ideas have been tested; problems\n   have appeared, and problems have been\
    \ solved.\n   For our purposes, the most important aspect of the NSF's networking\n\
    \   effort is that it allowed everyone to access the network. Up to that\n   point,\
    \ Internet access had been available only to researchers in\n   computer science,\
    \ government employees, and government contractors.\n   The NSF promoted universal\
    \ educational access by funding campus\n   connections only if the campus had\
    \ a plan to spread the access\n   around. So everyone attending a four year college\
    \ could become an\n   Internet user.\n   The demand keeps growing. Now that most\
    \ four-year colleges are\n   connected, people are trying to get secondary and\
    \ primary schools\n   connected. People who have graduated from college know what\
    \ the\n   Internet is good for, and talk their employers into connecting\n   corporations.\
    \ All this activity points to continued growth,\n   networking problems to solve,\
    \ evolving technologies, and job security\n   for networkers.\n"
- title: What Makes Up the Internet?
  contents:
  - "What Makes Up the Internet?\n   What comprises the Internet is a difficult question;\
    \ the answer\n   changes over time. Five years ago the answer would have been\
    \ easy:\n   \"All the networks, using the IP protocol, which cooperate to form\
    \ a\n   seamless network for their collective users.\" This would include\n  \
    \ various federal networks, a set of regional networks, campus\n   networks, and\
    \ some foreign networks.\n   More recently, some non-IP-based networks saw that\
    \ the Internet was\n   good. They wanted to provide its services to their clientele.\
    \ So they\n   developed methods of connecting these \"strange\" networks (e.g.,\n\
    \   Bitnet, DECnets, etc.) to the Internet. At first these connections,\n   called\
    \ \"gateways\", merely served to transfer electronic mail between\n   the two\
    \ networks. Some, however, have grown to translate other\n   services between\
    \ the networks as well. Are they part of the Internet?\n   Maybe yes and maybe\
    \ no. It depends on whether, in their hearts, they\n   want to be. If this sounds\
    \ strange, read on--it gets stranger.\n"
- title: Who Governs the Internet?
  contents:
  - "Who Governs the Internet?\n   In many ways the Internet is like a church: it\
    \ has its council of\n   elders, every member has an opinion about how things\
    \ should work, and\n   you can either take part or not. It's your choice. The\
    \ Internet has\n   no president, chief operating officer, or Pope. The constituent\n\
    \   networks may have presidents and CEO's, but that's a different issue;\n  \
    \ there's no single authority figure for the Internet as a whole.\n   The ultimate\
    \ authority for where the Internet is going rests with the\n   Internet Society,\
    \ or ISOC. ISOC is a voluntary membership\n   organization whose purpose is to\
    \ promote global information exchange\n   through Internet technology.  (If you'd\
    \ like more information, or if\n   you would like to join, contact information\
    \ is provided in the \"For\n   More Information\" section, near the end of this\
    \ document.)  It\n   appoints a council of elders, which has responsibility for\
    \ the\n   technical management and direction of the Internet.\n   The council\
    \ of elders is a group of invited volunteers called the\n   Internet Architecture\
    \ Board, or the IAB. The IAB meets regularly to\n   \"bless\" standards and allocate\
    \ resources, like addresses. The\n   Internet works because there are standard\
    \ ways for computers and\n   software applications to talk to each other. This\
    \ allows computers\n   from different vendors to communicate without problems.\
    \ It's not an\n   IBM-only or Sun-only or Macintosh-only network. The IAB is\n\
    \   responsible for these standards; it decides when a standard is\n   necessary,\
    \ and what the standard should be. When a standard is\n   required, it considers\
    \ the problem, adopts a standard, and announces\n   it via the network. (You were\
    \ expecting stone tablets?) The IAB also\n   keeps track of various numbers (and\
    \ other things) that must remain\n   unique. For example, each computer on the\
    \ Internet has a unique 32-\n   bit address; no other computer has the same address.\
    \  How does this\n   address get assigned? The IAB worries about these kinds of\
    \ problems.\n   It doesn't actually assign the addresses, but it makes the rules\n\
    \   about how to assign addresses.\n   As in a church, everyone has opinions about\
    \ how things ought to run.\n   Internet users express their opinions through meetings\
    \ of the\n   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF is another volunteer\n\
    \   organization; it meets regularly to discuss operational and near-term\n  \
    \ technical problems of the Internet. When it considers a problem\n   important\
    \ enough to merit concern, the IETF sets up a \"working group\"\n   for further\
    \ investigation. (In practice, \"important enough\" usually\n   means that there\
    \ are enough people to volunteer for the working\n   group.) Anyone can attend\
    \ IETF meetings and be on working groups; the\n   important thing is that they\
    \ work. Working groups have many different\n   functions, ranging from producing\
    \ documentation, to deciding how\n   networks should cooperate when problems occur,\
    \ to changing the\n   meaning of the bits in some kind of packet. A working group\
    \ usually\n   produces a report. Depending on the kind of recommendation, it could\n\
    \   just be documentation and made available to anyone wanting it, it\n   could\
    \ be accepted voluntarily as a good idea which people follow, or\n   it could\
    \ be sent to the IAB to be declared a standard.\n   If you go to a church and\
    \ accept its teachings and philosophy, you\n   are accepted by it, and receive\
    \ the benefits. If you don't like it,\n   you can leave. The church is still there,\
    \ and you get none of the\n   benefits. Such is the Internet. If a network accepts\
    \ the teachings of\n   the Internet, is connected to it, and considers itself\
    \ part of it,\n   then it is part of the Internet. It will find things it doesn't\
    \ like\n   and can address those concerns through the IETF. Some concerns may\
    \ be\n   considered valid and the Internet may change accordingly.  Some of\n\
    \   the changes may run counter to the religion, and be rejected. If the\n   network\
    \ does something that causes damage to the Internet, it could\n   be excommunicated\
    \ until it mends its evil ways.\n"
- title: Who Pays for It?
  contents:
  - "Who Pays for It?\n   The old rule for when things are confusing is \"follow the\
    \ money.\"\n   Well, this won't help you to understand the Internet. No one pays\
    \ for\n   \"it\"; there is no Internet, Inc. that collects fees from all Internet\n\
    \   networks or users. Instead, everyone pays for their part.  The NSF\n   pays\
    \ for NSFNET. NASA pays for the NASA Science Internet.  Networks\n   get together\
    \ and decide how to connect themselves together and fund\n   these interconnections.\
    \ A college or corporation pays for their\n   connection to some regional network,\
    \ which in turn pays a national\n   provider for its access.\n"
- title: What Does This Mean for Me?

  - "What Does This Mean for Me?\n   The concept that the Internet is not a network,\
    \ but a collection of\n   networks, means little to the end user. You want to\
    \ do something\n   useful: run a program, or access some unique data. You shouldn't\
    \ have\n   to worry about how it's all stuck together. Consider the telephone\n\
    \   system--it's an internet, too. Pacific Bell, AT&T, MCI, British\n   Telephony,\
    \ Telefonos de Mexico, and so on, are all separate\n   corporations that run pieces\
    \ of the telephone system. They worry\n   about how to make it all work together;\
    \ all you have to do is dial.\n   If you ignore cost and commercials, you shouldn't\
    \ care if you are\n   dealing with MCI, AT&T, or Sprint. Dial the number and it\
    \ works.\n   You only care who carries your calls when a problem occurs. If\n\
    \   something goes out of service, only one of those companies can fix\n   it.\
    \ They talk to each other about problems, but each phone carrier is\n   responsible\
    \ for fixing problems on its own part of the system.  The\n   same is true on\
    \ the Internet. Each network has its own network\n   operations center (NOC).\
    \ The operation centers talk to each other and\n   know how to resolve problems.\
    \ Your site has a contract with one of\n   the Internet's constituent networks,\
    \ and its job is to keep your site\n   happy. So if something goes wrong, they\
    \ are the ones to gripe at. If\n   it's not their problem, they'll pass it along.\n"

- title: New Standard Protocols
  contents:
  - "New Standard Protocols\n   When I was talking about how the Internet started,\
    \ I mentioned the\n   International Standards Organization (ISO) and their set\
    \ of protocol\n   standards. Well, they finally finished designing it. Now it\
    \ is an\n   international standard, typically referred to as the ISO/OSI (Open\n\
    \   Systems Interconnect) protocol suite. Many of the Internet's\n   component\
    \ networks allow use of OSI today. There isn't much demand,\n   yet. The U.S.\
    \ government has taken a position that government\n   computers should be able\
    \ to speak these protocols. Many have the\n   software, but few are using it now.\n\
    \   It's really unclear how much demand there will be for OSI,\n   notwithstanding\
    \ the government backing. Many people feel that the\n   current approach isn't\
    \ broke, so why fix it? They are just becoming\n   comfortable with what they\
    \ have, why should they have to learn a new\n   set of commands and terminology\
    \ just because it is the standard?\n   Currently there are no real advantages\
    \ to moving to OSI. It is more\n   complex and less mature than IP, and hence\
    \ doesn't work as\n   efficiently. OSI does offer hope of some additional features,\
    \ but it\n   also suffers from some of the same problems which will plague IP\
    \ as\n   the network gets much bigger and faster. It's clear that some sites\n\
    \   will convert to the OSI protocols over the next few years.  The\n   question\
    \ is: how many?\n"
- title: International Connections
  contents:
  - "International Connections\n   The Internet has been an international network\
    \ for a long time, but\n   it only extended to the United States' allies and overseas\
    \ military\n   bases. Now, with the less paranoid world environment, the Internet\
    \ is\n   spreading everywhere. It's currently in over 50 countries, and the\n\
    \   number is rapidly increasing. Eastern European countries longing for\n   western\
    \ scientific ties have wanted to participate for a long time,\n   but were excluded\
    \ by government regulation. This ban has been\n   relaxed. Third world countries\
    \ that formerly didn't have the means to\n   participate now view the Internet\
    \ as a way to raise their education\n   and technology levels.\n   In Europe,\
    \ the development of the Internet used to be hampered by\n   national policies\
    \ mandating OSI protocols, regarding IP as a cultural\n   threat akin to EuroDisney.\
    \  These policies prevented development of\n   large scale Internet infrastructures\
    \ except for the Scandinavian\n   countries which embraced the Internet protocols\
    \ long ago and are\n   already well-connected.  In 1989, RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeens)\
    \ began\n   coordinating the operation of the Internet in Europe and presently\n\
    \   about 25% of all hosts connected to the Internet are located in\n   Europe.\n\
    \   At present, the Internet's international expansion is hampered by the\n  \
    \ lack of a good supporting infrastructure, namely a decent telephone\n   system.\
    \ In both Eastern Europe and the third world, a state-of-the-\n   art phone system\
    \ is nonexistent. Even in major cities, connections\n   are limited to the speeds\
    \ available to the average home anywhere in\n   the U.S., 9600 bits/second. Typically,\
    \ even if one of these countries\n   is \"on the Internet,\" only a few sites\
    \ are accessible. Usually, this\n   is the major technical university for that\
    \ country. However, as phone\n   systems improve, you can expect this to change\
    \ too; more and more,\n   you'll see smaller sites (even individual home systems)\
    \ connecting to\n   the Internet.\n"
- title: Commercialization
  contents:
  - "Commercialization\n   Many big corporations have been on the Internet for years.\
    \ For the\n   most part, their participation has been limited to their research\
    \ and\n   engineering departments. The same corporations used some other\n   network\
    \ (usually a private network) for their business\n   communications. After all,\
    \ this IP stuff was only an academic toy.\n   The IBM mainframes that handled\
    \ their commercial data processing did\n   the \"real\" networking using a protocol\
    \ suite called System Network\n   Architecture (SNA).\n   Businesses are now discovering\
    \ that running multiple networks is\n   expensive. Some are beginning to look\
    \ to the Internet for \"one-stop\"\n   network shopping. They were scared away\
    \ in the past by policies which\n   excluded or restricted commercial use. Many\
    \ of these policies are\n   under review and will change. As these restrictions\
    \ drop, commercial\n   use of the Internet will become progressively more common.\n\
    \   This should be especially good for small businesses. Motorola or\n   Standard\
    \ Oil can afford to run nationwide networks connecting their\n   sites, but Ace\
    \ Custom Software couldn't. If Ace has a San Jose office\n   and a Washington\
    \ office, all it needs is an Internet connection on\n   each end. For all practical\
    \ purposes, they have a nationwide\n   corporate network, just like the big boys.\n"
- title: Privatization
  contents:
  - "Privatization\n   Right behind commercialization comes privatization. For years,\
    \ the\n   networking community has wanted the telephone companies and other\n\
    \   for-profit ventures to provide \"off the shelf\" IP connections.  That\n \
    \  is, just like you can place an order for a telephone jack in your\n   house\
    \ for your telephone, you could do this for an Internet\n   connection. You order,\
    \ the telephone installer leaves, and you plug\n   your computer into the Internet.\
    \ Except for Bolt, Beranek and Newman,\n   the company that ran the ARPAnet, there\
    \ weren't any takers.  The\n   telephone companies have historically said, \"\
    We'll sell you phone\n   lines, and you can do whatever you like with them.\"\
    \ By default, the\n   Federal government stayed in the networking business.\n\
    \   Now that large corporations have become interested in the Internet,\n   the\
    \ phone companies have started to change their attitude. Now they\n   and other\
    \ profit-oriented network purveyors complain that the\n   government ought to\
    \ get out of the network business. After all, who\n   best can provide network\
    \ services but the \"phone companies\"?  They've\n   got the ear of a lot of political\
    \ people, to whom it appears to be a\n   reasonable thing. If you talk to phone\
    \ company personnel, many of\n   them still don't really understand what the Internet\
    \ is about. They\n   ain't got religion, but they are studying the Bible furiously.\n\
    \   (Apologies to those telephone company employees who saw the light\n   years\
    \ ago and have been trying to drag their employers into church.)\n   Although\
    \ most people in the networking community think that\n   privatization is a good\
    \ idea, there are some obstacles in the way.\n   Most revolve around the funding\
    \ for the connections that are already\n   in place. Many schools are connected\
    \ because the government pays part\n   of the bill. If they had to pay their own\
    \ way, some schools would\n   probably decide to spend their money elsewhere.\
    \ Major research\n   institutions would certainly stay on the net; but some smaller\n\
    \   colleges might not, and the costs would probably be prohibitive for\n   most\
    \ secondary schools (let alone grade schools).  What if the school\n   could afford\
    \ either an Internet connection or a science lab? It's\n   unclear which one would\
    \ get funded. The Internet has not yet become a\n   \"necessity\" in many people's\
    \ minds. When it does, expect\n   privatization to come quickly.\n   Well, enough\
    \ questions about the history of the information highway\n   system. It's time\
    \ to walk to the edge of the road, try and hitch a\n   ride, and be on your way.\n"
