    \  current implementations, resulting in difficulties for operators.\n   Network
    operators should deploy consistent community handling across\n   their networks
    while taking the inconsistent behaviors from the\n   various BGP implementations
    into consideration.  This document\n   recommends specific actions to limit future
    inconsistency: namely,\n   BGP implementors must not create further inconsistencies
    from this\n   point forward.  These behavioral changes, though subtle, actually\n

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The BGP Communities attribute was specified in [RFC1997],
    which\n   introduced the concept of well-known communities.  In hindsight,\n   [RFC1997]
    did not prescribe as fully as it should have how well-known\n   communities may
    be manipulated by policies applied by operators.\n   Currently, implementations
    differ in this regard, and these\n   differences can result in inconsistent behaviors
    that operators find\n   difficult to identify and resolve.\n   This document describes
    the current behavioral differences in order\n   to assist operators in generating
    consistent community-manipulation\n   policies in a multi-vendor environment and
    to prevent the\n   introduction of additional divergence in implementations.\n
    \  This document recommends specific actions to limit future\n   inconsistency:
    namely, BGP implementors MUST NOT create further\n   inconsistencies from this
    point forward.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Manipulation of Communities by Policy\n   [RFC1997] says:\n      A BGP speaker
    receiving a route with the COMMUNITIES path\n      attribute may modify this attribute
    according to the local policy.\n   One basic operational need is to add or remove
    one or more\n   communities to or from the set.  The focus of this document is\n
    \  another common operational need: to replace all communities with a\n   new
    set.  To simplify this second case, most BGP policy\n   implementations provide
    a syntax to \"set\" a community that operators\n   use to mean \"remove any/all
    communities present on the route and\n   apply this set of communities instead\".\n
    \  Some operators prefer to write explicit policy to delete unwanted\n   communities
    rather than use \"set\", i.e., using \"delete community *:*\"\n   and then \"add
    community x:y ...\" configuration statements in an\n   attempt to replace all
    communities.  The same community-manipulation\n   policy differences described
    in the following section exist in the\n   syntax for both \"set\" and \"delete
    community *:*\".  For simplicity,\n   the remainder of this document refers only
    to the \"set\" behaviors,\n   which we refer to collectively as each implementation's
    '\"set\"\n   directive'.\n"
  title: 2.  Manipulation of Communities by Policy
- contents:
  - "3.  Community Manipulation Policy Differences\n   Vendor implementations differ
    in the treatment of certain well-known\n   communities when modified using the
    syntax to \"set\" the community.\n   Some replace all communities, including the
    well-known ones, with the\n   new set; others replace all non-well-known communities
    but do not\n   modify any well-known communities that are present.\n   These differences
    result in what would appear to be identical policy\n   configurations having very
    different results on different platforms.\n"

  - "4.  Documentation of Vendor Implementations\n   In this section, we document
    the syntax and observed behavior of the\n   \"set\" directive in several popular
    BGP implementations to illustrate\n   the severity of the problem operators face.\n
    \  In Juniper Networks' Junos OS, \"community set\" removes all\n   communities,
    well-known or otherwise.\n   In Cisco IOS XR, \"set community\" removes all communities
    except for\n   the following:\n            +-------------+-----------------------------------+\n
    \           | Numeric     | Common Name                       |\n            +-------------+-----------------------------------+\n

    65535:0     | graceful-shutdown                 |\n            | 65535:1     |
    accept-own rfc7611                |\n            | 65535:65281 | NO_EXPORT                         |\n
    \           | 65535:65282 | NO_ADVERTISE                      |\n            |
    65535:65283 | NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED (or local-AS) |\n            +-------------+-----------------------------------+\n
    \           Table 1: Communities Not Removed by Cisco's IOS XR\n   Cisco IOS XR
    allows well-known communities to be removed only by\n   explicitly enumerating
    one at a time and not in the aggregate -- for\n   example, \"delete community
    accept-own\".  Operators are advised to\n   consult Cisco IOS XR documentation
    and/or Cisco support for full\n   details.\n   On Extreme networks' Brocade NetIron,
    \"set community X\" removes all\n   communities and sets X.\n   In Huawei's VRP
    product, \"community set\" removes all communities,\n   well-known or otherwise.\n
    \  In OpenBGPD, \"set community\" does not remove any communities, well-\n   known
    or otherwise.\n   Nokia's SR OS has several directives that operate on communities.\n
    \  Its \"set\" directive is called using the \"replace\" keyword, replacing\n
    \  all communities, well-known or otherwise, with the specified\n   communities.\n"

    - "4.1.  Note on an Inconsistency\n   IANA publishes a list of well-known communities
      [IANA-WKC].\n   Cisco IOS XR's set of well-known communities that \"set community\"\n
      \  will not overwrite diverges from the IANA's list of well-known\n   communities.
      \ Quite a few well-known communities from IANA's list do\n   not receive special
      treatment in Cisco IOS XR, and at least one\n   community on Cisco IOS XR's
      special treatment list, internet == 0:0,\n   is not formally a well-known community
      as it is not in [IANA-WKC] (it\n   is taken from the Reserved range [0x00000000-0x0000FFFF]).\n
      \  This merely notes an inconsistency.  It is not a plea to protect the\n   entire
      IANA list from \"set community\".\n"

  - "5.  Note for Those Writing RFCs for New Community-Like Attributes\n   When establishing
    new attributes similar to those in [RFC1997] (large\n   communities, wide communities,
    etc.), RFC authors should state\n   explicitly how the new attribute is to be
    handled.\n"
  title: 5.  Note for Those Writing RFCs for New Community-Like Attributes
- contents:
  - "6.  Action Items\n   Network operators are encouraged to limit their use of the
    \"set\"\n   directive (within reason) to improve consistency across platforms.\n
    \  Unfortunately, it would be operationally disruptive for vendors to\n   change
    their current implementations.\n   Vendors MUST clearly document the behavior
    of the \"set\" directive in\n   their implementations.\n   Vendors MUST ensure
    that their implementations' \"set\" directive\n   treatment of any specific community
    does not change if/when that\n   community becomes a new well-known community
    through future\n   standardization.  For most implementations, this means that
    the \"set\"\n   directive MUST continue to remove the community; for those\n   implementations
    where the \"set\" directive removes no communities,\n   that behavior MUST continue.\n
    \  Given the implementation inconsistencies described in this document,\n   network
    operators are urged never to rely on any implicit\n   understanding of a neighbor
    ASN's BGP community handling.  That is,\n   before announcing prefixes with NO_EXPORT
    or any other community to a\n   neighbor ASN, the operator should confirm with
    that neighbor how the\n   community will be treated.\n"
