    \   clients and servers establish connections, they never negotiate the\n   use\
    \ of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0.  This document updates\n   the backward\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many protocols specified in the IETF rely on Transport Layer\
    \ Security\n   (TLS) [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2] for security services.  This is\
    \ a good\n   thing, but some TLS clients and servers also support negotiating\
    \ the\n   use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0 [SSL2]; however, this\n\
    \   version does not provide a sufficiently high level of security.  SSL\n   version\
    \ 2.0 has known deficiencies.  This document describes those\n   deficiencies,\
    \ and it requires that TLS clients and servers never\n   negotiate the use of\
    \ SSL version 2.0.\n   RFC 4346 [TLS1.1], and later RFC 5246 [TLS1.2], explicitly\
    \ warned\n   implementers that the \"ability to send version 2.0 CLIENT-HELLO\n\
    \   messages will be phased out with all due haste\".  This document\n   accomplishes\
    \ this by updating the backward compatibility sections\n   found in TLS [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2].\n"

- title: 2.  SSL 2.0 Deficiencies
  contents:
  - "2.  SSL 2.0 Deficiencies\n   SSL version 2.0 [SSL2] deficiencies include the\
    \ following:\n   o  Message authentication uses MD5 [MD5].  Most security-aware\
    \ users\n      have already moved away from any use of MD5 [RFC6151].\n   o  Handshake\
    \ messages are not protected.  This permits a man-in-the-\n      middle to trick\
    \ the client into picking a weaker cipher suite than\n      it would normally\
    \ choose.\n   o  Message integrity and message encryption use the same key, which\n\
    \      is a problem if the client and server negotiate a weak encryption\n   \
    \   algorithm.\n   o  Sessions can be easily terminated.  A man-in-the-middle\
    \ can easily\n      insert a TCP FIN to close the session, and the peer is unable\
    \ to\n      determine whether or not it was a legitimate end of the session.\n"
- title: 3.  Changes to TLS
  contents:
  - "3.  Changes to TLS\n   Because of the deficiencies noted in the previous section:\n\
    \   o  TLS clients MUST NOT send the SSL version 2.0 compatible CLIENT-\n    \
    \  HELLO message format.  Clients MUST NOT send any ClientHello\n      message\
    \ that specifies a protocol version less than\n      { 0x03, 0x00 }.  As previously\
    \ stated by the definitions of all\n      previous versions of TLS, the client\
    \ SHOULD specify the highest\n      protocol version it supports.\n   o  TLS servers\
    \ MAY continue to accept ClientHello messages in the\n      version 2 CLIENT-HELLO\
    \ format as specified in RFC 5246 [TLS1.2],\n      Appendix E.2.  Note that this\
    \ does not contradict the prohibition\n      against actually negotiating the\
    \ use of SSL 2.0.\n   o  TLS servers MUST NOT reply with an SSL 2.0 SERVER-HELLO\
    \ with a\n      protocol version that is less than { 0x03, 0x00 } and instead\
    \ MUST\n      abort the connection, i.e., when the highest protocol version\n\
    \      offered by the client is { 0x02, 0x00 }, the TLS connection will\n    \
    \  be refused.\n   Note that the number of servers that support this above-mentioned\n\
    \   \"MAY accept\" implementation option is declining, and the SSL 2.0\n   CLIENT-HELLO\
    \ precludes the use of TLS protocol enhancements that\n   require TLS extensions.\
    \  TLS extensions can only be sent as part of\n   an (Extended) ClientHello handshake\
    \ message.\n"
