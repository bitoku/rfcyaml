  - "1. Introduction\n   This document specifies what support is required at the firewall,\
    \ the\n   Mobile IP [1] home agent and the Mobile IP mobile node to enable the\n\
    \   latter to access a private network from the Internet.  For example, a\n  \
    \ company employee could attach his/her laptop to some Internet access\n   point\
    \ by:\n      a)   Dialing into a PPP/SLIP account on an Internet service\n   \
    \        provider's network.\n      b)   Connecting into a 10Base-T or similar\
    \ LAN network available\n           at, for example, an IETF terminal room, a\
    \ local university,\n           or another company's premises.\n   Notice that\
    \ in these examples, the mobile node's relevant interface\n   (PPP or 10Base-T)\
    \ is configured with an IP address different from\n   that which it uses \"normally\"\
    \ (i.e. at the office). Furthermore, the\n   IP address used is not necessarily\
    \ a fixed assignment. It may be\n   assigned temporarily and dynamically at the\
    \ beginning of the session\n   (e.g. by IPCP in the PPP case, or DHCP in the 10Base-T\
    \ case).\n   The following discussion assumes a network configuration consisting\n\
    \   of a private network separated by a firewall from the general\n   Internet\
    \ or public network.  The systems involved are:\n      Private Network\n     \
    \      A protected network separated from the Internet by hosts\n           enforcing\
    \ access restrictions (firewalls). A private network\n           may use a private\
    \ address space, and its addresses may not\n           even be routable by the\
    \ general internet.\n      Public Network\n          The Internet at large. Hosts\
    \ are able to communicate with each\n          other throughout the public network\
    \ without firewall-imposed\n          restrictions.\n      Mobile Node (MN)\n\
    \          Its permanent address falls within the range of the private\n     \
    \     network. The user removes the system from its home network,\n          and\
    \ connects it to the Internet at another point.  The\n          mechanisms outlined\
    \ in this discussion render this mobility\n          transparent:  the mobile\
    \ node continues accessing its home\n          network and its resources exactly\
    \ as if it were still within\n          it.  Notice that when the mobile node\
    \ leaves its home\n          network, it may migrate both within and outside of\
    \ the\n          private network's boundaries. As defined by Mobile IP [1], a\n\
    \          mobile node uses a care-of address while roaming.\n      Home Agent\
    \ (HA) for the mobile node\n         Serves as a location registry and router\
    \ as described in the\n         Mobile IP IETF draft.\n      Foreign Agent (FA)\n\
    \         Serves as a registration relayer and care of address for the\n     \
    \    mobile node as described in the Mobile IP IETF draft.\n      Correspondent\
    \ Node (CH)\n         A system that is exchanging data packets with the mobile\n\
    \         node.\n      Firewall (FW)\n         The system (or collection of systems)\
    \ that enforces access\n         control between the private network and the general\
    \ Internet.\n         It may do so by a combination of functions such as application\n\
    \         gatewaying, packet filtering and cryptographic techniques.\n   The mechanisms\
    \ described in this document allow a mobile node out on\n   a public sector of\
    \ the network to negotiate access past a SKIP\n   firewall, and construct a secure\
    \ channel into its home network.  This\n   enables it to communicate with correspondent\
    \ nodes that belong to the\n   private network, and, if bi-directional tunnels\
    \ are used, with\n   external hosts that are reachable when the mobile node is\
    \ at home.\n   The mobile node enjoys the same level of connectivity and privacy\
    \ as\n   it does when it is in its home network.\n   This document does not address\
    \ the scenario in which the mobile node\n   attempts to access its private network,\
    \ while within another private\n   network.\n   Sections 2 and 3 provide an overview\
    \ of the environment being\n   considered and the restrictions it imposes.  Section\
    \ 4 examines\n   firewall technologies. Section 5 discusses the best mode of operation\n\
    \   of the participating entities from the point of view of Mobile IP.\n   Section\
    \ 6 discusses possible configuration for the secure channel.\n   Finally, packet\
    \ formats are the topic of sections 7 and 8.\n"
- title: 2. Mobility without a Firewall
  contents:
  - "2. Mobility without a Firewall\n   Suppose the mobile node is roaming throughout\
    \ the general Internet,\n   but its home network is not protected by a firewall.\
    \ This is\n   typically found in academic environment as opposed to corporate\n\
    \    networks.\n   This works as prescribed by Mobile IP [1]. The only proviso\
    \ is that\n   the mobile node would most probably operate with a co-located address\n\
    \   instead of using a separate foreign agent's care-of address.  This is\n  \
    \ because, at least in the near term, it is far more likely to be able\n   to\
    \ secure a temporary care-of-address than it is to find a foreign\n   agent already\
    \ deployed at the site you are visiting. For example:\n   -   Internet Service\
    \ Provider: pre-assigns customers IP addresses,\n       or assigns them out dynamically\
    \ via PPP's address negotiation.\n   -   An IETF terminal room may pre-assign\
    \ addresses for your use or\n       offer DHCP services.\n   -   Other locations\
    \ probably would offer DHCP services.\n"
- title: 3. Restrictions imposed by a Firewall
  contents:
  - "3. Restrictions imposed by a Firewall\n   The firewall imposes restrictions on\
    \ packets entering or leaving the\n   private network. Packets are not allowed\
    \ through unless they conform\n   to a filtering specification, or unless there\
    \ is a negotiation\n   involving some sort of authentication.\n   Another restriction\
    \ is imposed by the separation between private\n   addresses and general Internet\
    \ addresses. Strictly speaking, this is\n   not imposed by a firewall, but by\
    \ the characteristics of the private\n   network. For example, if a packet destined\
    \ to an internal address\n   originates in the general Internet, it will probably\
    \ not be\n   delivered.  It is not that the firewall drops it. Rather, the\n \
    \  Internet's routing fabric is unable to process it. This elicits an\n   ICMP\
    \ host unreachable packet sent back to the originating node.\n   Because of this,\
    \ the firewall MUST be explicitly targeted as the\n   destination node by outside\
    \ packets seeking to enter the private\n   network. The routing fabric in the\
    \ general Internet will only see the\n   public address of the firewall and route\
    \ accordingly.  Once the\n   packet arrives at the firewall, the real packet destined\
    \ to a private\n   address is recovered.\n"

  - "4. Two Firewall Options: Application relay and IP Security\n   Before delving\
    \ into any details, lets examine two technologies which\n   may provide firewall\
    \ support for mobile nodes:\n   -   application relaying or proxying, or\n   -\
    \   IP Security.\n   To understand the implications, let's examine two specific\
    \ schemes to\n   accomplish the above: SOCKS version 5 and SKIP.\n"
- title: 4.1 SOCKS version 5 [4]
  contents:
  - "4.1 SOCKS version 5 [4]\n   There is an effort within the authenticated firewall\
    \ traversal WG\n   (aft) of the IETF to provide a common interface for application\n\
    \   relays.\n   The solution being proposed is a revised specification of the\
    \ SOCKS\n   protocol. Version 5 has been extended to include UDP services as\n\
    \   well.  The SOCKS solution requires that the mobile node -- or another\n  \
    \ node on its behalf -- establish a TCP session to exchange UDP traffic\n   with\
    \ the FW. It also has to use the SOCKS library to encapsulate the\n   traffic\
    \ meant for the FW. The steps required by a SOCKS solution are:\n   -   TCP connection\
    \ established to port 1080 (1.5 round trips)\n   -   version identifier/method\
    \ selection negotiation (1 round trip)\n       -   method-dependent negotiation.\
    \ For example, the\n           Username/Password Authentication [5] requires 1\
    \ round trip:\n           1. client sends a Username/Password request\n      \
    \     2. FW (server) responds\n           The GSS-API negotiation requires at\
    \ least 3 round trips:\n           1. client context establishment (at least 1\
    \ round trip)\n           2. client initial token/server reply (1 round trip)\n\
    \           3. message protection subnegotiation (at least 1 round trip)\n   -\
    \   (finally) SOCKS request/reply (1 round trip)\n   This is a minimum of 4 (6\
    \ with GSS-API) round-trips before the client\n   is able to pass data through\
    \ the FW using the following header:\n      +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+\n\
    \      |RSV | FRAG | ATYP | DST.ADDR | DST.PORT |   DATA   |\n      +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+\n\
    \      | 2  |  1   |  1   | Variable |    2     | Variable |\n      +----+------+------+----------+----------+----------+\n\
    \   Bear in mind that the above must be done each time the mobile\n   registers\
    \ a new care-of address. In addition to this inefficiency,\n   this scheme requires\
    \ that we use UDP to encapsulate IP datagrams.\n   There is at least one commercial\
    \ network that does this, but it is\n   not the best solution.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ SOCKS defines how to establish authenticated\n   connections, but currently\
    \ it does not provide a clear solution to\n   the problem of encrypting the traffic.\n\
    \   This header contains the relay information needed by all parties\n   involved\
    \ to reach those not directly reachable.\n"
- title: 4.2 SKIP [3]
  contents:
  - "4.2 SKIP [3]\n   Alternatively, traffic from the mobile node to the firewall\
    \ could be\n   encrypted and authenticated using a session-less IP security\n\
    \   mechanism like SKIP. This obviates the need to set up a session just\n   to\
    \ exchange UDP traffic with the firewall.\n   A solution based on SKIP is very\
    \ attractive in this scenario, as no\n   round trip times are incurred before\
    \ the mobile node and the firewall\n   achieve mutual trust: the firewall can\
    \ start relaying packets for the\n   mobile node as soon as it receives the first\
    \ one.  This, of course,\n   implies that SKIP is being used with AH [7] so that\
    \ authentication\n   information is contained in each packet.  Encryption by using\
    \ ESP [6]\n   is also assumed in this scenario, since the Internet at large is\n\
    \   considered a hostile environment.  An ESP transform that provides\n   both\
    \ authentication and encryption could be used, in which case the\n   AH header\
    \ need not be included.\n   The firewall and the mobile node may be previously\
    \ configured with\n   each other's authenticated Diffie-Hellman public components\
    \ (also\n   known as public values).  Alternatively, they could exchange them\
    \ in\n   real-time using any of the mechanisms defined by the SKIP protocol\n\
    \   (on-line certificate directory service or certificate discovery\n   protocol).\
    \ Home agents and the firewall also MUST have, be able to\n   exchange or obtain\
    \ each other's public components.\n   There are other proposals besides SKIP to\
    \ achieve IP layer security.\n   However, they are session-oriented key management\
    \ solutions, and\n   typically imply negotiations spanning several round-trip\
    \ times before\n   cryptographically secure communications are possible.  In this\n\
    \   respect they raise similar concerns to those outlined previously in\n   the\
    \ discussion on SOCKS-based solutions.  Others have arrived at\n   similar conclusions\
    \ regarding the importance of session-less key\n   management for Mobile IP applications\
    \ [8].\n   Another advantage of SKIP is its support for nomadic applications.\n\
    \   Typically, two hosts communicating via a secure IP layer channel use\n   the\
    \ IP source and destination addresses on incoming packets to arrive\n   at the\
    \ appropriate security association. The SKIP header can easily\n   supersede this\
    \ default mechanism by including the key ID the\n   recipient must use to obtain\
    \ the right certificate.\n   The key id is specified by two fields in the SKIP\
    \ header:\n      1) a name space identifier (NSID) to indicate which of the\n\
    \         possible name spaces is being used, and,\n      2) a master key identifier\
    \ (MKID) that uniquely indicates (within\n         the given name space) an id\
    \ to use in fetching the proper\n         certificate.\n   As an example, by setting\
    \ NSID to 1 and MKID to its home address, a\n   mobile node tells a receiver \"\
    ignore the IP source and use my home\n   address instead to look up my public\
    \ component\". Similarly, setting\n   NSID to 8 enables using Unsigned Diffie-Hellman\
    \ (UDH) certificates.\n   In this case, the MKID is set to the MD5 hash of the\
    \ DH public\n   component [10].\n   In addition to the NSID/MKID feature, Mobile\
    \ IP is best supported by\n   an appropriate policy at the SKIP firewall in the\
    \ form of a \"nomadic\"\n   access control list entry. This is an entry which\
    \ is filtered by key\n   ID, instead of by IP source address, as is the usual\
    \ case. It\n   translates to \"allow access from any IP source address for a given\n\
    \   NSID/MKID combination\".  Furthermore, incoming packets MUST have an\n   AH\
    \ header, so that after properly authenticating them, the firewall\n   establishes\
    \ a \"current address\" or \"dynamic binding\" for the nomadic\n   host.  The\
    \ NSID/MKID combination determines which key should be used\n   with the nomadic\
    \ host [9].\n   Notice that this supports Mobile IP, because the mobile node always\n\
    \   initiates contact. Hence, the SKIP firewall has a chance to learn the\n  \
    \ mobile node's \"current address\" from an incoming packet before it\n   attempts\
    \ to encrypt an outgoing packet.\n   However, this precludes the use of simultaneous\
    \ bindings by a mobile\n   node.  At the firewall, the last Registration Request\
    \ sent by the\n   mobile node replaces the association between its permanent address\n\
    \   and any prior care-of address. In order to support simultaneous\n   bindings\
    \ the firewall must be able to interpret Mobile IP\n   registration messages.\n\
    \   Section 7.2.2 discusses another advantage of making the firewall\n   understand\
    \ Mobile IP packet formats.\n   In what follows we assume a SKIP-based solution.\n"
- title: 5. Agents and Mobile Node Configurations
  contents:
  - "5. Agents and Mobile Node Configurations\n   Depending on which address it uses\
    \ as its tunnel endpoint, the Mobile\n   IP protocol specifies two ways in which\
    \ a mobile node can register a\n   mobility binding with its home agent.\n   \
    \   a)   an address advertised for that purpose by the foreign agent\n      b)\
    \   an address belonging to one of the mobile node's interfaces\n           (i.e.\
    \ operation with a co-located address).\n   From the firewall's point of view,\
    \ the main difference between these\n   two cases hinges on which node prepares\
    \ the outermost encrypting\n   encapsulation.  The firewall MUST be able to obtain\
    \ the Diffie-\n   Hellman public component of the node that creates the outermost\
    \ SKIP\n   header in an incoming packet. This is only possible to guarantee in\n\
    \   case \"b\", because the mobile node and the firewall both belong to the\n\
    \   same administrative domain. The problem is even more apparent when\n   the\
    \ mobile node attempts a Registration Request.  Here, the foreign\n   agent is\
    \ not just a relayer, it actually examines the packet sent by\n   the mobile node,\
    \ and modifies its agent services accordingly. In\n   short, assuming the current\
    \ specification of Mobile IP and the\n   current lack of trust in the internet\
    \ at large, only case \"b\" is\n   possible. Case \"a\" would require an extension\
    \ (e.g. a \"relay\"\n   Registration Request), and modifying code at the home\
    \ agent, the\n   firewall and the foreign agent.\n   Assuming that the firewall\
    \ offers a secure relay service (i.e.\n   decapsulation and forwarding of packets),\
    \ the mobile node can reach\n   addresses internal to the private network by encapsulating\
    \ the\n   packets in a SKIP header and directing them to the firewall.\n   Therefore,\
    \ It is simplest to assume that the mobile node operates\n   with a co-located\
    \ address.\n"

  - "6. Supporting Mobile IP: Secure Channel Configurations\n   The mobile node participates\
    \ in two different types of traffic:\n   Mobile IP registration protocol and data.\
    \ For the sake of simplicity,\n   the following discussion evaluates different\

  - "6.5 Choosing a Secure Channel Configuration\n   A potential problem in both options\
    \ 2 and 3 is that their end-to-end\n   channel components assume that the mobile\
    \ node and the home agent can\n   exchange IP traffic directly with each other.\
    \ This is generally not\n   the case, as the Internet routing fabric may not have\
    \ routes to\n   addresses that belong to private networks, and the private routing\n\
    \   fabric may ignore how to route to public addresses -- or doing so may\n  \
    \ be administratively restricted.  Therefore, it is necessary for\n   packets\
    \ to be addressed directly to the firewall, and indirectly --\n   via some tunneling\
    \ or relaying capability -- to the real destination\n   on the other side of the\
    \ firewall.\n   Options 1 and 4 are essentially equivalent. The latter may be\n\
    \   considered overkill, because it uses encryption even within the\n   private\
    \ network, and this is generally not necessary. What is\n   necessary even within\
    \ the private network is for the home agent to\n   add an encapsulation (not necessarily\
    \ encrypted) so as to direct\n   datagrams to the mobile node via the firewall.\
    \ The type of\n   encapsulation used determines the difference between options\
    \ 1 and 4.\n   Whereas option 4 uses SKIP, option 1 uses a cleartext encapsulation\n\
    \   mechanism.  This is obtainable by, for example, using IP in IP\n   encapsulation\
    \ [2].\n   Options 1 and 4 are mostly interchangeable. The difference is, of\n\
    \   course, that the former does not protect the data from eavesdroppers\n   within\
    \ the private network itself. This may be unacceptable in\n   certain cases. Traffic\
    \ from some departments in a company (for\n   example payroll or legal) may need\
    \ to be encrypted as it traverses\n   other sections of the company.\n   In the\
    \ interest of being conservative, in what follows we assume\n   option 4 (i.e.\
    \ traffic is encrypted on the general Internet, as well\n   as within the private\
    \ network.\n   Since the firewall is party to the security associations governing\n\
    \   encryption on both the public and private networks, it is always able\n  \
    \ to inspect the traffic being exchanged by the home agent and the\n   mobile\
    \ node. If this is of any concern, the home agent and mobile\n   node could set\
    \ up a bi-directional tunnel and encrypt it.\n"

  contents:
  - "7. Mobile IP Registration Procedure with a SKIP Firewall\n   When roaming within\
    \ a private network, a mobile node sends\n   Registration Requests directly to\
    \ its home agent. On the public\n   Internet, it MUST encapsulate the original\
    \ Registration Request in a\n   SKIP packet destined to the firewall.  The mobile\
    \ node MUST\n   distinguish between \"inside\" and \"outside\" addresses. This\
    \ could be\n   accomplished by a set of rules defining the address ranges.\n \
    \  Nevertheless, actual installations may present serious difficulties\n   in\
    \ defining exactly what is a private address and what is not.\n   Direct human\
    \ input is a very effective method: it may be obvious to\n   the user that the\
    \ current point of attachment is outside its private\n   network, and it should\
    \ be possible to communicate this knowledge to\n   the mobile node software.\n\
    \   The home agent must also distinguish between \"inside\" and \"outside\"\n\
    \   addresses, but lacks the potential benefit of direct user input.\n   Accordingly,\
    \ it should be possible for the mobile node to communicate\n   that knowledge\
    \ to the home agent. To accomplish this we define a\n   Traversal Extension to\
    \ the Registration Requests and Replies.  This\n   extension is also useful when\
    \ traversing multiple firewalls.\n   In spite of the above mechanisms, errors\
    \ in judgement are to be\n   expected.  Accordingly, the firewall SHOULD be configured\
    \ such that\n   it will still perform its relaying duties even if they are\n \
    \  unnecessarily required by a mobile node with an inside care-of\n   address.\n\
    \   Upon arriving at a foreign net and acquiring a care-of address, the\n   mobile\
    \ node must first -- before any data transfer is possible --\n   initiate a registration\
    \ procedure. This consists of an authenticated\n   exchange by which the mobile\
    \ node informs its home agent of its\n   current whereabouts (i.e. its current\
    \ care-of address), and receives\n   an acknowledgement. This first step of the\
    \ protocol is very\n   convenient, because the SKIP firewall can use it to dynamically\n\
    \   configure its packet filter.\n   The remainder of this section shows the packet\
    \ formats used.  Section\n   7.1 discusses how a mobile node sends a Registration\
    \ Request to its\n   home agent via the SKIP firewall. Section 7.2 discusses how\
    \ the home\n   agent send the corresponding Registration Reply to the mobile node.\n\
    \   Section 7.3 defines the Traversal Extension for use with Registration\n  \
    \ Requests and Replies.\n"

  - "8.2.2. On the Outside (Public) Network\n   The SKIP firewall intercepts the packet,\
    \ and recovers the Mobile IP\n   encapsulated datagram. Before sending it out,\
    \ the dynamic packet\n   filter configured by the original Registration Request\
    \ triggers\n   encryption of this packet, this time by the SKIP firewall for\n\

  - "9. Security Considerations\n   The topic of this document is security. Nevertheless,\
    \ it is\n   imperative to point out the perils involved in allowing a flow of\
    \ IP\n   packets through a firewall. In essence, the mobile host itself MUST\n\
    \   also take on responsibility for securing the private network, because\n  \
    \ it extends its periphery. This does not mean it stops exchanging\n   unencrypted\
    \ IP packets with hosts on the public network.  For\n   example, it MAY have to\
    \ do so in order to satisfy billing\n   requirements imposed by the foreign site,\
    \ or to renew its DHCP lease.\n   In the latter case it might filter not only\
    \ on IP source address, but\n   also on protocol and port numbers.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it MUST have some firewall capabilities, otherwise, any\n   malicious individual\
    \ that gains access to it will have gained access\n   to the private network as\
    \ well.\n"
