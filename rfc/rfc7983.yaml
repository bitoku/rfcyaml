  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 5.1.2 of \"Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\
    \ Extension\n   to Establish Keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol\
    \ (SRTP)\"\n   [RFC5764] defines a scheme for a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)\n\
    \   [RFC3550] receiver to demultiplex DTLS [RFC6347], Session Traversal\n   Utilities\
    \ for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389], and Secure Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (SRTP)\
    \ / Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP)\n   [RFC3711] packets\
    \ that are arriving on the RTP port.  Unfortunately,\n   this demultiplexing scheme\
    \ has created problematic issues:\n   1.  It implicitly allocated codepoints for\
    \ new STUN methods without\n       an IANA registry reflecting these new allocations.\n\
    \   2.  It did not take into account the fact that ZRTP [RFC6189] also\n     \
    \  needs to be demultiplexed with the other packet types explicitly\n       mentioned\
    \ in Section 5.1.2 of RFC 5764.\n   3.  It implicitly allocated codepoints for\
    \ new Transport Layer\n       Security (TLS) ContentTypes without an IANA registry\
    \ reflecting\n       these new allocations.\n   4.  It did not take into account\
    \ the fact that the Traversal Using\n       Relays around NAT (TURN) usage of\
    \ STUN can create TURN channels\n       that also need to be demultiplexed with\
    \ the other packet types\n       explicitly mentioned in Section 5.1.2 of RFC\
    \ 5764.\n   Having overlapping ranges between different IANA registries becomes\n\
    \   an issue when a new codepoint is allocated in one of these registries\n  \
    \ without carefully analyzing the impact it could have on the other\n   registries\
    \ when that codepoint is demultiplexed.  Among other\n   downsides of the bad\
    \ design of the demultiplexing algorithm detailed\n   in [RFC5764], it creates\
    \ a requirement for coordination between\n   codepoint assignments where none\
    \ should exist, and that is\n   organizationally and socially undesirable.  However,\
    \ RFC 5764 has\n   been widely deployed, so there must be an awareness of this\
    \ issue and\n   how it must be dealt with.  Thus, even if the feature related\
    \ to a\n   codepoint is not initially thought to be useful in the context of\n\
    \   demultiplexing, the respective IANA registry expert should at least\n   raise\
    \ a flag when the allocated codepoint irrevocably prevents\n   multiplexing.\n\
    \   The first goal of this document is to make sure that future\n   allocations\
    \ in any of the affected protocols are done with the full\n   knowledge of their\
    \ impact on multiplexing.  This is achieved by\n   updating [RFC5764], which includes\
    \ modifying the IANA registries with\n   instructions for coordination between\
    \ the protocols at risk.\n   A second goal is to permit the addition of new protocols\
    \ to the list\n   of existing multiplexed protocols in a manner that does not\
    \ break\n   existing implementations.\n   At the time of this writing, the flaws\
    \ in the demultiplexing scheme\n   were unavoidably inherited by other documents,\
    \ such as [RFC7345] and\n   [SDP-BUNDLE].  So in addition, these and any other\
    \ affected documents\n   will need to be corrected with the updates this document\
    \ provides.\n"

- title: 3.  Implicit Allocation of Codepoints for New STUN Methods
  contents:
  - "3.  Implicit Allocation of Codepoints for New STUN Methods\n   The demultiplexing\
    \ scheme in [RFC5764] states that the receiver can\n   identify the packet type\
    \ by looking at the first byte.  If the value\n   of this first byte is 0 or 1,\
    \ the packet is identified to be STUN.\n   The problem with this implicit allocation\
    \ is that it restricts the\n   codepoints for STUN methods (as described in Section\
    \ 18.1 of\n   [RFC5389]) to values between 0x000 and 0x07F, which in turn reduces\n\
    \   the number of possible STUN method codepoints assigned by IETF Review\n  \
    \ (i.e., the range 0x000 - 0x7FF) from 2048 to only 128 and eliminates\n   the\
    \ possibility of having STUN method codepoints assigned by\n   Designated Expert\
    \ (i.e., the range 0x800 - 0xFFF).\n   To preserve the Designated Expert range,\
    \ this document allocates the\n   values 2 and 3 to also identify STUN methods.\n\
    \   The IANA Registry for STUN methods has been modified to mark the\n   codepoints\
    \ from 0x100 to 0xFFF as Reserved.  These codepoints can\n   still be allocated,\
    \ but require IETF Review with a document that will\n   properly evaluate the\
    \ risk of an assignment overlapping with other\n   registries.\n   In addition,\
    \ this document also updates the IANA registry such that\n   the STUN method codepoints\
    \ assigned in the 0x080-0x0FF range are also\n   assigned via Designated Expert.\
    \  The \"STUN Methods\" registry has been\n   changed as follows:\n   OLD:\n \
    \  0x000-0x7FF     IETF Review\n   0x800-0xFFF     Designated Expert\n   NEW:\n\
    \   0x000-0x07F     IETF Review\n   0x080-0x0FF     Designated Expert\n   0x100-0xFFF\

- title: 4.  Multiplexing of ZRTP
  contents:
  - "4.  Multiplexing of ZRTP\n   ZRTP [RFC6189] is a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman\
    \ exchange\n   to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast\n\
    \   SRTP sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  The ZRTP\n   protocol\
    \ is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same\n   port as RTP and\
    \ does not require support in the signaling protocol.\n   In order to prevent\
    \ future documents from assigning values from the\n   unused range to a new protocol,\
    \ this document modifies the [RFC5764]\n   demultiplexing algorithm to properly\
    \ account for ZRTP [RFC6189] by\n   allocating the values from 16 to 19 for this\
    \ purpose.\n"
- title: 5.  Implicit Allocation of New Codepoints for TLS ContentTypes
  contents:
  - "5.  Implicit Allocation of New Codepoints for TLS ContentTypes\n   The demultiplexing\
    \ scheme in [RFC5764] dictates that if the value of\n   the first byte is between\
    \ 20 and 63 (inclusive), then the packet is\n   identified to be DTLS.  For DTLS\
    \ 1.0 [RFC4347] and DTLS 1.2\n   [RFC6347], that first byte corresponds to the\
    \ TLS ContentType field.\n   Considerations must be taken into account when assigning\
    \ additional\n   ContentTypes in the codepoint ranges 0 to 19 and 64 to 255, so\
    \ this\n   does not prevent demultiplexing when this functionality is desirable.\n\
    \   Note that [RFC5764] describes a narrow use of DTLS that works as long\n  \
    \ as the specific DTLS version used abides by the restrictions on the\n   demultiplexing\
    \ byte (the ones that this document imposes on the \"TLS\n   ContentType Registry\"\
    ).  Any extension or revision to DTLS that\n   causes it to no longer meet these\

    \ describes.\n   With respect to TLS packet identification, this document explicitly\n\

    \ succeeded in selecting a non-relayed path,\n   it is still possible to receive\
    \ data from the TURN server.  For\n   instance, when ICE is used with aggressive\
    \ nomination, the media path\n   can quickly change until it stabilizes.  Also,\
    \ freeing ICE candidates\n   is optional, so the TURN server can restart forwarding\
    \ STUN\n   connectivity checks during an ICE restart.\n   TURN channels are an\
    \ optimization where data packets are exchanged\n   with a 4-byte prefix instead\
    \ of the standard 36-byte STUN overhead\n   (see Section 2.5 of [RFC5766]).  The\
    \ problem is that the RFC 5764\n   demultiplexing scheme does not define what\
    \ to do with packets\n   received over a TURN channel since these packets will\
    \ start with a\n   first byte whose value will be between 64 and 127 (inclusive).\
    \  If\n   the TURN server was instructed to send data over a TURN channel, then\n\

    \  Current implementations violate RFC 5764 for values 64 to\n   127 (inclusive)\
    \ and they instead parse packets with such values as\n   TURN.\n   In order to\
    \ prevent future documents from assigning values from the\n   unused range to\
    \ a new protocol, this document modifies the\n   demultiplexing algorithm in RFC\
    \ 5764 to properly account for TURN\n   channels by allocating the values from\
    \ 64 to 79 for this purpose.\n   This modification restricts the TURN channel\
    \ space to a more limited\n   set of possible channels when the TURN client does\
    \ the channel\n   binding request in combination with the demultiplexing scheme\n\
    \   described in [RFC5764].\n"
