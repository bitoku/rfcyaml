  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is the subject\
    \ of\n   numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can\n\
    \   be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the\n   set\
    \ of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP.  \"Don't Panic!\"  [HGTTG]\n   This\
    \ specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series.  It is a\n   current\
    \ snapshot of the specifications under the SIP umbrella at the\n   time of publication.\
    \  It is anticipated that this document itself\n   will be regularly updated as\
    \ SIP specifications mature.  Furthermore,\n   it references many specifications,\
    \ which, at the time of publication\n   of this document, were not yet finalized,\
    \ and may eventually be\n   completed or abandoned.  Therefore, the enumeration\
    \ of specifications\n   here is a work-in-progress and subject to change.\n  \
    \ For each specification, a paragraph or so description is included\n   that summarizes\
    \ the purpose of the specification.  Each specification\n   also includes a letter\
    \ that designates its category in the Standards\n   Track [RFC2026].  These values\
    \ are:\n   S: Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or Standard)\n\
    \   E: Experimental\n   B: Best Current Practice\n   I: Informational\n   The\
    \ specifications are grouped together by topic.  The topics are:\n   Core:  The\
    \ SIP specifications that are expected to be utilized for\n      each session\
    \ or registration an endpoint participates in.\n   Public Switched Telephone Network\
    \ (PSTN) Interop:  Specifications\n      related to interworking with the telephone\
    \ network.\n   General Purpose Infrastructure:  General purpose extensions to\
    \ SIP,\n      SDP (Session Description Protocol), and MIME, but ones that are\n\
    \      not expected to always be used.\n   NAT Traversal:  Specifications to deal\
    \ with firewall and NAT\n      traversal.\n   Call Control Primitives:  Specifications\
    \ for manipulating SIP dialogs\n      and calls.\n   Event Framework:  Definitions\
    \ of the core specifications for the SIP\n      event framework, providing for\
    \ pub/sub capability.\n   Event Packages:  Packages that utilize the SIP event\
    \ framework.\n   Quality of Service:  Specifications related to multimedia quality\
    \ of\n      service (QoS).\n   Operations and Management:  Specifications related\
    \ to configuration\n      and monitoring of SIP deployments.\n   SIP Compression:\
    \  Specifications to facilitate usage of SIP with the\n      Signaling Compression\
    \ (Sigcomp) framework.\n   SIP Service URIs:  Specifications on how to use SIP\
    \ URIs to address\n      multimedia services.\n   Minor Extensions:  Specifications\
    \ that solve a narrow problem space\n      or provide an optimization.\n   Security\
    \ Mechanisms:  Specifications providing security functionality\n      for SIP.\n\
    \   Conferencing:  Specifications for multimedia conferencing.\n   Instant Messaging,\
    \ Presence, and Multimedia:  SIP extensions related\n      to IM, presence, and\
    \ multimedia.  This covers only the SIP\n      extensions related to these topics.\
    \  See [SIMPLE] for a full\n      treatment of SIP for IM and Presence (SIMPLE).\n\
    \   Emergency Services:  SIP extensions related to emergency services.\n     \
    \ See [ECRIT-FRAME] for a more complete treatment of additional\n      functionality\
    \ related to emergency services.\n   Typically, SIP extensions fit naturally into\
    \ topic areas, and\n   implementors interested in a particular topic often implement\
    \ many or\n   all of the specifications in that area.  There are some\n   specifications\
    \ that fall into multiple topic areas, in which case\n   they are listed more\
    \ than once.\n   Do not print all the specs cited here at once, as they might\
    \ share\n   the fate of the rules of Brockian Ultracricket when bound together:\n\
    \   collapse under their own gravity and form a black hole [HGTTG].\n   This document\
    \ itself is not an update to RFC 3261 or an extension to\n   SIP.  It is an informational\
    \ document, meant to guide newcomers,\n   implementors, and deployers to the many\
    \ specifications associated\n   with SIP.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope of This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope of This Document\n   It is very difficult to enumerate the set of SIP\
    \ specifications.\n   This is because there are many protocols that are intimately\
    \ related\n   to SIP and used by nearly all SIP implementations, but are not\n\
    \   formally SIP extensions.  As such, this document formally defines a\n   \"\
    SIP specification\" as:\n   o  RFC 3261 and any specification that defines an\
    \ extension to it,\n      where an extension is a mechanism that changes or updates\
    \ in some\n      way a behavior specified there.\n   o  The basic SDP specification\
    \ [RFC4566] and any specification that\n      defines an extension to SDP whose\
    \ primary purpose is to support\n      SIP.\n   o  Any specification that defines\
    \ a MIME object whose primary purpose\n      is to support SIP.\n   Excluded from\
    \ this list are requirements, architectures, registry\n   definitions, non-normative\
    \ frameworks, and processes.  Best Current\n   Practices are included when they\
    \ normatively define mechanisms for\n   accomplishing a task, or provide significant\
    \ description of the usage\n   of the normative specifications, such as call flows.\n\
    \   The SIP change process [RFC3427] defines two types of extensions to\n   SIP:\
    \ normal extensions and the so-called P-headers (where P stands\n   for \"preliminary\"\
    , \"private\", or \"proprietary\", and the \"P-\" prefix\n   is included in the\
    \ header field name), which are meant to be used in\n   areas of limited applicability.\
    \  P-headers cannot be defined in the\n   Standards Track.  For the most part,\
    \ P-headers are not included in\n   the listing here, with the exception of those\
    \ that have seen general\n   usage despite their P-header status.\n   This document\
    \ includes specifications, which have already been\n   approved by the IETF and\
    \ granted an RFC number, in addition to\n   Internet Drafts, which are still under\
    \ development within the IETF\n   and will eventually finish and get an RFC number.\
    \  Inclusion of\n   Internet Drafts here helps encourage early implementation\
    \ and\n   demonstrations of interoperability of the protocol, and thus aids in\n\
    \   the standards-setting process.  Inclusion of these also identifes\n   where\
    \ the IETF is targetting a solution at a particular problem\n   space.  Note that\
    \ final IANA assignment of codepoints (such as option\n   tags and header field\
    \ names) does not take place until shortly before\n   publication as an RFC, and\
    \ thus codepoint assignments may change.\n"
- title: 3.  Core SIP Specifications
  contents:
  - "3.  Core SIP Specifications\n   The core SIP specifications represent the set\
    \ of specifications whose\n   functionality is broadly applicable.  An extension\
    \ is broadly\n   applicable if it fits into one of the following categories:\n\
    \   o  For specifications that impact SIP session management, the\n      extension\
    \ would be used for almost every session initiated by a\n      user agent.\n \
    \  o  For specifications that impact SIP registrations, the extension\n      would\
    \ be used for almost every registration initiated by a user\n      agent.\n  \
    \ o  For specifications that impact SIP subscriptions, the extension\n      would\
    \ be used for almost every subscription initiated by a user\n      agent.\n  \
    \ In other words, these are not specifications that are used just for\n   some\
    \ requests and not others; they are specifications that would\n   apply to each\
    \ and every request for which the extension is relevant.\n   In the galaxy of\
    \ SIP, these specifications are like towels [HGTTG].\n   RFC 3261, The Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (S):  [RFC3261] is the core\n      SIP protocol itself.\
    \  RFC 3261 obsoletes [RFC2543].  It is the\n      president of the galaxy [HGTTG]\
    \ as far as the suite of SIP\n      specifications is concerned.\n   RFC 3263,\
    \ Locating SIP Servers (S):  [RFC3263] provides DNS\n      procedures for taking\
    \ a SIP URI and determining a SIP server that\n      is associated with that SIP\
    \ URI.  RFC 3263 is essential for any\n      implementation using SIP with DNS.\
    \  RFC 3263 makes use of both DNS\n      SRV records [RFC2782] and NAPTR records\
    \ [RFC3401].\n   RFC 3264, An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description\
    \ Protocol\n   (S):  [RFC3264] defines how the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\n\
    \      [RFC4566] is used with SIP to negotiate the parameters of a media\n   \
    \   session.  It is in widespread usage and an integral part of the\n      behavior\
    \ of RFC 3261.\n   RFC 3265, SIP-Specific Event Notification (S):  [RFC3265] defines\
    \ the\n      SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods.  These two methods provide a general\n\
    \      event notification framework for SIP.  To actually use the\n      framework,\
    \ extensions need to be defined for specific event\n      packages.  An event\
    \ package defines a schema for the event data\n      and describes other aspects\
    \ of event processing specific to that\n      schema.  An RFC 3265 implementation\
    \ is required when any event\n      package is used.\n   RFC 3325, Private Extensions\
    \ to SIP for Asserted Identity within\n   Trusted Networks (I):  Though its P-header\
    \ status implies that it has\n      limited applicability, [RFC3325], which defines\
    \ the P-Asserted-\n      Identity header field, has been widely deployed.  It\
    \ is used as\n      the basic mechanism for providing network-asserted caller\
    \ ID\n      services.  Its intended update, [UPDATE-PAI], clarifies its usage\n\
    \      for connected party identification as well.\n   RFC 3327, SIP Extension\
    \ Header Field for Registering Non-Adjacent\n   Contacts (S):  [RFC3327] defines\
    \ the Path header field.  This field\n      is inserted by proxies between a client\
    \ and their registrar.  It\n      allows inbound requests towards that client\
    \ to traverse these\n      proxies prior to being delivered to the user agent.\
    \  It is\n      essential in any SIP deployment that has edge proxies, which are\n\
    \      proxies between the client and the home proxy or SIP registrar.\n   RFC\
    \ 3581, An Extension to SIP for Symmetric Response Routing (S):\n      [RFC3581]\
    \ defines the rport parameter of the Via header.  It\n      allows SIP responses\
    \ to traverse NAT.  It is one of several\n      specifications that are utilized\
    \ for NAT traversal (see\n      Section 6).\n   RFC 3840, Indicating User Agent\
    \ Capabilities in SIP (S):  [RFC3840]\n      defines a mechanism for carrying\
    \ capability information about a\n      user agent in REGISTER requests and in\
    \ dialog-forming requests\n      like INVITE.  It has found use with conferencing\
    \ (the isfocus\n      parameter declares that a user agent is a conference server)\
    \ and\n      with applications like push-to-talk.\n   RFC 4320, Actions Addressing\
    \ Issues Identified with the Non-INVITE\n   Transaction in SIP (S):  [RFC4320]\
    \ formally updates RFC 3261 and\n      modifies some of the behaviors associated\
    \ with non-INVITE\n      transactions.  This addresses some problems found in\
    \ timeout and\n      failure cases.\n   RFC 4474, Enhancements for Authenticated\
    \ Identity Management in SIP\n   (S):  [RFC4474] defines a mechanism for providing\
    \ a cryptographically\n      verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP\
    \ request.  Known\n      as \"SIP Identity\", this mechanism provides an alternative\
    \ to RFC\n      3325.  It has seen little deployment so far, but its importance\
    \ as\n      a key construct for anti-spam techniques and new security\n      mechanisms\
    \ makes it a core part of the SIP specifications.\n   GRUU, Obtaining and Using\
    \ Globally Routable User Agent Identifiers\n   (GRUU) in SIP (S):  [GRUU] defines\
    \ a mechanism for directing requests\n      towards a specific UA instance.  GRUU\
    \ is essential for features\n      like transfer and provides another piece of\
    \ the SIP NAT traversal\n      story.\n   OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated\
    \ Connections through SIP (S):\n      [OUTBOUND], also known as SIP outbound,\
    \ defines important changes\n      to the SIP registration mechanism that enable\
    \ delivery of SIP\n      messages towards a UA when it is behind a NAT.  This\
    \ specification\n      is the cornerstone of the SIP NAT traversal strategy.\n\
    \   RFC 4566, Session Description Protocol (S):  [RFC4566] defines a\n      format\
    \ for representing multimedia sessions.  SDP objects are\n      carried in the\
    \ body of SIP messages and, based on the offer/answer\n      model, are used to\
    \ negotiate the media characteristics of a\n      session between users.\n   SDP-CAP,\
    \ SDP Capability Negotiation (S):  [SDP-CAP] defines a set of\n      extensions\
    \ to SDP that allows for capability negotiation within\n      SDP.  Capability\
    \ negotiation can be used to select between\n      different profiles of RTP (secure\
    \ vs. unsecure) or to negotiate\n      codecs such that an agent has to select\
    \ one amongst a set of\n      supported codecs.\n   ICE, Interactive Connectivity\
    \ Establishment (ICE) (S):  [ICE] defines\n      a technique for NAT traversal\
    \ of media sessions for protocols that\n      make use of the offer/answer model.\
    \  This specification is the\n      IETF-recommended mechanism for NAT traversal\
    \ for SIP media\n      streams, and is meant to be used even by endpoints that\
    \ are\n      themselves never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature\n\
    \      tag [OPTION-TAG] (also a core specification) have been defined for\n  \
    \    use with ICE.\n   RFC 3605, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in\
    \ the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [RFC3605] defines a way to\n\
    \      explicitly signal, within an SDP message, the IP address and port\n   \
    \   for RTCP, rather than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time\n      Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  It is needed for devices\n      behind NAT, and the\
    \ specification is required by ICE.\n   RFC 4916, Connected Identity in the Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   (S):  [RFC4916] formally updates RFC 3261.  It\
    \ defines an extension\n      to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the\
    \ identity of the\n      final called user (connected party).  Due to forwarding\
    \ and\n      retargeting services, this may not be the same as the user that\n\
    \      the caller was originally trying to reach.  The mechanism works in\n  \
    \    tandem with the SIP identity specification [RFC4474] to provide\n      signatures\
    \ over the connected party identity.  It can also be used\n      if a party identity\
    \ changes mid-call due to third-party call\n      control actions or PSTN behavior.\n\
    \   RFC 3311, The SIP UPDATE Method (S):  [RFC3311] defines the UPDATE\n     \
    \ method for SIP.  This method is meant as a means for updating\n      session\
    \ information prior to the completion of the initial INVITE\n      transaction.\
    \  It can also be used to update other information,\n      such as the identity\
    \ of the participant [RFC4916], without\n      involving an updated offer/answer\
    \ exchange.  It was developed\n      initially to support [RFC3312], but has found\
    \ other uses.  In\n      particular, its usage with RFC 4916 means it will typically\
    \ be\n      used as part of every session, to convey a secure, connected\n   \
    \   identity.\n   SIPS-URI, The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation\n\
    \   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [SIPS-URI] is intended to update RFC 3261.  It\n    \
    \  revises the processing of the SIPS URI, originally defined in RFC\n      3261,\
    \ to fix many errors and problems that have been encountered\n      with that\
    \ mechanism.\n   RFC 3665, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Basic Call Flow Examples\n\
    \   (B):  [RFC3665] contains best-practice call flow examples for basic\n    \
    \  SIP interactions -- call establishment, termination, and\n      registration.\n\
    \   Essential Corrections to SIP:  A collection of fixes to SIP that\n      address\
    \ important bugs and vulnerabilities.  These include a fix\n      requiring loop\
    \ detection in any proxy that forks [LOOP-FIX], a\n      clarification on how\
    \ record-routing works [RECORD-ROUTE], and a\n      correction to the IPv6 BNF\
    \ [ABNF-FIX].\n"

  - "4.  Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Interworking\n   Numerous extensions\
    \ and usages of SIP are related to interoperability\n   and communications with\
    \ or through the PSTN.\n   RFC 2848, The PINT Service Protocol (S):  [RFC2848]\
    \ is one of the\n      earliest extensions to SIP.  It defines procedures for\
    \ using SIP\n      to invoke services that actually execute on the PSTN.  Its\
    \ main\n      application is for third-party call control, allowing an IP host\n\
    \      to set up a call between two PSTN endpoints.  PINT (PSTN/Internet\n   \
    \   Interworking) has a relatively narrow focus and has not seen\n      widespread\
    \ deployment.\n   RFC 3910, The SPIRITS Protocol (S):  Continuing the trend of\
    \ naming\n      PSTN-related extensions with alcohol references, SPIRITS (Services\n\
    \      in PSTN Requesting Internet Services) [RFC3910] defines the\n      inverse\
    \ of PINT.  It allows a switch in the PSTN to ask an IP\n      element how to\
    \ proceed with call waiting.  It was developed\n      primarily to support Internet\
    \ Call Waiting (ICW).  Perhaps the\n      next specification will be called the\
    \ Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster\n      [HGTTG].\n   RFC 3372, SIP for Telephones\
    \ (SIP-T): Context and Architectures (I):\n      SIP-T [RFC3372] defines a mechanism\
    \ for using SIP between pairs of\n      PSTN gateways.  Its essential idea is\
    \ to tunnel ISDN User Part\n      (ISUP) signaling between the gateways in the\
    \ body of SIP messages.\n      SIP-T motivated the development of INFO [RFC2976].\
    \  SIP-T has seen\n      widespread implementation for the limited deployment\
    \ model that it\n      addresses.  As ISUP endpoints disappear from the network,\
    \ the need\n      for this mechanism will decrease.\n   RFC 3398, ISUP to SIP\

    \ SIP gateways and is part of the\n      SIP-T framework.\n   RFC 4497, Interworking\
    \ between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   and QSIG (B):  [RFC4497] defines\

    \ (PBX) signaling, to SIP.\n   RFC 3578, Mapping of ISUP Overlap Signaling to\
    \ SIP (S):  [RFC3578]\n      defines a mechanism to map overlap dialing into SIP.\
    \  This\n      specification is widely regarded as the ugliest SIP specification,\n\
    \      as the introduction to the specification itself advises that it\n     \
    \ has many problems.  Overlap signaling (the practice of sending\n      digits\
    \ into the network as dialed instead of waiting for complete\n      collection\
    \ of the called party number) is largely incompatible\n      with SIP at some\
    \ fairly fundamental levels.  That said, RFC 3578\n      is mostly harmless and\

  contents:
  - "5.  General Purpose Infrastructure Extensions\n   These extensions are general\
    \ purpose enhancements to SIP, SDP, and\n   MIME that can serve a wide variety\
    \ of uses.  However, they are not\n   used for every session or registration,\
    \ as the core specifications\n   are.\n   RFC 3262, Reliability of Provisional\
    \ Responses in SIP (S):  SIP\n      defines two types of responses to a request:\
    \ final and\n      provisional.  Provisional responses are numbered from 100 to\
    \ 199.\n      In SIP, these responses are not sent reliably.  This choice was\n\
    \      made in RFC 2543 since the messages were meant to just be truly\n     \
    \ informational and rendered to the user.  However, subsequent work\n      on\
    \ PSTN interworking demonstrated a need to map provisional\n      responses to\
    \ PSTN messages that needed to be sent reliably.\n      [RFC3262] was developed\
    \ to allow reliability of provisional\n      responses.  The specification defines\
    \ the PRACK method, used for\n      indicating that a provisional response was\
    \ received.  Though it\n      provides a generic capability for SIP, RFC 3262\
    \ implementations\n      have been most common in PSTN interworking devices. \
    \ However,\n      PRACK brings a great deal of complication for relatively small\n\
    \      benefit.  As such, it has seen only moderate levels of deployment.\n  \
    \ RFC 3323, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP)\
    \ (S):  [RFC3323] defines the Privacy header field, used by\n      clients to\
    \ request anonymity for their requests.  Though it\n      defines several privacy\
    \ services, the only one broadly used is the\n      one that supports privacy\
    \ of the P-Asserted-Identity header field\n      [RFC3325].\n   UA-PRIVACY, UA-Driven\
    \ Privacy Mechanism for SIP (S):  [UA-PRIVACY]\n      defines a mechanism for\
    \ achieving anonymous calls in SIP.  It is\n      an alternative to [RFC3323],\
    \ and instead places more intelligence\n      in the endpoint to craft anonymous\
    \ messages by directly accessing\n      network services.\n   RFC 2976, The INFO\
    \ Method (S):  [RFC2976] was defined as an extension\n      to RFC 2543.  It defines\
    \ a method, INFO, used to transport mid-\n      dialog information that has no\
    \ impact on SIP itself.  Its driving\n      application was the transport of PSTN-related\
    \ information when\n      using SIP between a pair of gateways.  Though originally\
    \ conceived\n      for broader use, it only found standardized usage with SIP-T\n\
    \      [RFC3372].  It has been used to support numerous proprietary and\n    \
    \  non-interoperable extensions due to its poorly defined scope.\n   RFC 3326,\
    \ The Reason Header Field for SIP (S):  [RFC3326] defines the\n      Reason header\
    \ field.  It is used in requests, such as BYE, to\n      indicate the reason that\
    \ the request is being sent.\n   RFC 3388, Grouping of Media Lines in the Session\
    \ Description Protocol\n   (S):  RFC 3388 [RFC3388] defines a framework for grouping\
    \ together\n      media streams in an SDP message.  Such a grouping allows\n \
    \     relationships between these streams, such as which stream is the\n     \
    \ audio for a particular video feed, to be expressed.\n   RFC 3420, Internet Media\
    \ Type message/sipfrag (S):  [RFC3420] defines\n      a MIME object that contains\
    \ a SIP message fragment.  Only certain\n      header fields and parts of the\
    \ SIP message are present.  For\n      example, it is used to report back on the\
    \ responses received to a\n      request sent as a consequence of a REFER.\n \
    \  RFC 3608, SIP Extension Header Field for Service Route Discovery\n   During\
    \ Registration (S):  [RFC3608] allows a client to determine,\n      from a REGISTER\
    \ response, a path of proxies to use in requests it\n      sends outside of a\
    \ dialog.  It can also be used by proxies to\n      verify the Route header in\
    \ client-initiated requests.  In many\n      respects, it is the inverse of the\
    \ Path header field, but has seen\n      less usage since default outbound proxies\
    \ have been sufficient in\n      many deployments.\n   RFC 3841, Caller Preferences\
    \ for SIP (S):  [RFC3841] defines a set of\n      headers that a client can include\
    \ in a request to control the way\n      in which the request is routed downstream.\
    \  It allows a client to\n      direct a request towards a UA with specific capabilities,\
    \ which a\n      UA indicates using [RFC3840].\n   RFC 4028, Session Timers in\
    \ SIP (S):  [RFC4028] defines a keepalive\n      mechanism for SIP signaling.\
    \  It is primarily meant to provide a\n      way to clean up old state in proxies\
    \ that are holding call state\n      for calls from failed endpoints that were\
    \ never terminated\n      normally.  Despite its name, the session timer is not\
    \ a mechanism\n      for detecting a network failure mid-call.  Session timers\n\
    \      introduce a fair bit of complexity for relatively little gain, and\n  \
    \    have seen moderate deployment.\n   RFC 4168, SCTP as a Transport for SIP\
    \ (S):  [RFC4168] defines how to\n      carry SIP messages over the Stream Control\
    \ Transmission Protocol\n      (SCTP) [RFC4960].  SCTP has seen very limited usage\
    \ for SIP\n      transport.\n   RFC 4244, An Extension to SIP for Request History\
    \ Information (S):\n      [RFC4244] defines the History-Info header field, which\
    \ indicates\n      information on how and why a call came to be routed to a\n\
    \      particular destination.\n   RFC 4145, TCP-Based Media Transport in the\
    \ Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP) (S):  [RFC4145] defines an extension\
    \ to SDP for\n      setting up TCP-based sessions between user agents.  It defines\
    \ who\n      sets up the connection and how its lifecycle is managed.  It has\n\
    \      seen relatively little usage due to the small number of media\n      types\
    \ to date that use TCP.\n   RFC 4091, The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT)\
    \ Semantics for\n   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework\
    \ (S):\n      [RFC4091] defines a mechanism for including both IPv4 and IPv6\n\

    \ never behind a NAT.  A SIP option tag and media feature\n      tag [OPTION-TAG]\
    \ have been defined for use with ICE.\n   ICE-TCP, TCP Candidates with Interactive\
    \ Connectivity Establishment\n   (ICE) (S):  [ICE-TCP] specifies the usage of\
    \ ICE for TCP streams.\n      This allows for selection of RTP-based voice on\
    \ top of TCP only\n      when NAT or firewalls would prevent UDP-based voice from\
    \ working.\n   RFC 3605, Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in the Session\n\

    \ than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time\n      Transport Protocol (RTP)\
    \ [RFC3550].  It is needed for devices\n      behind NAT, and the specification\
    \ is required by ICE.\n   OUTBOUND, Managing Client Initiated Connections through\
    \ SIP (S):\n      [OUTBOUND], also known as SIP outbound, defines important changes\n\
    \      to the SIP registration mechanism that enable delivery of SIP\n      messages\
    \ towards a UA when it is behind a NAT.\n   RFC 3581, An Extension to SIP for\
    \ Symmetric Response Routing (S):\n      [RFC3581] defines the rport parameter\

    \ Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent Identifiers\n   (GRUU) in SIP\
    \ (S):  [GRUU] defines a mechanism for directing requests\n      towards a specific\

    \ (S):  REFER [RFC3515] defines a mechanism\n      for asking a user agent to\
    \ send a SIP request.  It's a form of SIP\n      remote control, and is the primary\
    \ tool used for call transfer in\n      SIP.  Beware that not all potential uses\

    \ Lists (S):\n      [RFC4662] defines a resource called a Resource List Server\
    \ (RLS).\n      A client can send a subscribe to this server.  The server will\n\
    \      generate a series of subscriptions, compile the resulting\n      information,\
    \ and send it back to the subscriber.  The set of\n      resources that the RLS\
    \ will subscribe to is a property of the\n      request URI in the SUBSCRIBE request.\n\
    \   RFC 5363, Framework and Security Considerations for Session\n   Initiation\
    \ Protocol (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-List\n   Services (S):  [RFC5363]\
    \ defines the framework for list services in\n      SIP.  In this framework, a\
    \ UA can include an XML list object in\n      the body of various requests and\
    \ the server will provide list-\n      oriented services as a consequence.  For\
    \ example, a SUBSCRIBE with\n      a list subscribes to the URI in the list.\n\
    \   RFC 5367, Subscriptions To Request-Contained Resource Lists in SIP\n   (S):\
    \  [RFC5367] uses the URI-list framework [RFC5363] and allows a\n      client\
    \ to subscribe to a resource called a Resource List Server.\n      This server\
    \ will generate subscriptions to the URI in the list,\n      compile the resulting\
    \ information, and send it back to the\n      subscriber.\n   RFC 5365, Multiple-Recipient\
    \ MESSAGE Requests in SIP (S):  [RFC5365]\n      uses the URI-list framework [RFC5363]\
    \ and allows a client to send\n      a MESSAGE to a number of recipients.\n  \
    \ RFC 5366, Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists in\n   SIP\
    \ (S):  [RFC5366] uses the URI-list framework [RFC5363].  It allows\n      a client\
    \ to ask the server to act as a conference focus and send\n      an invitation\
    \ to each recipient in the list.\n   RFC 4240, Basic Network Media Services with\
    \ SIP (I):  [RFC4240]\n      defines a way for SIP application servers to invoke\
    \ announcement\n      and conferencing services from a media server.  This is\n\
    \      accomplished through a set of defined URI parameters that tell the\n  \
    \    media server what to do, such as what file to play and what\n      language\
    \ to render it in.\n   RFC 4458, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) URIs for Applications\n\
    \   such as Voicemail and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) (I):\n      [RFC4458]\

- title: 14.  Minor Extensions
  contents:
  - "14.  Minor Extensions\n   These SIP extensions don't fit easily into a single\
    \ specific use\n   case.  They have somewhat general applicability, but they solve\
    \ a\n   relatively small problem or provide an optimization.\n   RFC 4488, Suppression\
    \ of the SIP REFER Implicit Subscription (S):\n      [RFC4488] defines an enhancement\
    \ to REFER.  REFER normally creates\n      an implicit subscription to the target\
    \ of the REFER.  This\n      subscription is used to pass back updates on the\
    \ progress of the\n      referral.  This extension allows that implicit subscription\
    \ to be\n      bypassed as an optimization.\n   RFC 4538, Request Authorization\
    \ through Dialog Identification in SIP\n   (S):  [RFC4538] provides a mechanism\
    \ that allows a UAS to authorize a\n      request because the requestor proves\
    \ it knows a dialog that is in\n      progress with the UAS.  The specification\
    \ is useful in conjunction\n      with the SIP application interaction framework\
    \ [INTERACT-FRAME].\n   RFC 4508, Conveying Feature Tags with the REFER Method\
    \ in SIP (S):\n      [RFC4508] defines a mechanism for carrying RFC 3840 feature\
    \ tags\n      in REFER.  It is useful for informing the target of the REFER\n\
    \      about the characteristics of the intended target of the referred\n    \
    \  request.\n   RFC 5373, Requesting Answer Modes for SIP (S):  [RFC5373] defines\
    \ an\n      extension for indicating to the called party whether or not the\n\
    \      phone should ring and/or be answered immediately.  This is useful\n   \
    \   for push-to-talk and for diagnostic applications.\n   RFC 5079, Rejecting\
    \ Anonymous Requests in SIP (S):  [RFC5079] defines\n      a mechanism for a called\
    \ party to indicate to the calling party\n      that a call was rejected since\
    \ the caller was anonymous.  This is\n      needed for implementation of the Anonymous\
    \ Call Rejection (ACR)\n      feature in SIP.\n   RFC 5368, Referring to Multiple\
    \ Resources in SIP (S):  [RFC5368]\n      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the\
    \ recipient of the REFER to\n      generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.\
    \  This is useful for\n      conferencing, where a client would like to ask a\
    \ conference server\n      to eject multiple users.\n   RFC 4483, A Mechanism\
    \ for Content Indirection in Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) Messages (S):\
    \  [RFC4483] defines a mechanism for\n      content indirection.  Instead of carrying\
    \ an object within a SIP\n      body, a URL reference is carried instead, and\
    \ the recipient\n      dereferences the URL to obtain the object.  The specification\
    \ has\n      potential applicability for sending large instant messages, but\n\
    \      has yet to find much actual use.\n   RFC 3890, A Transport Independent\
    \ Bandwidth Modifier for the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) (S):  [RFC3890]\
    \ specifies an SDP extension\n      that allows for the description of the bandwidth\
    \ for a media\n      session that is independent of the underlying transport mechanism.\n\
    \   RFC 4583, Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor\n   Control\
    \ Protocol (BFCP) Streams (S):  [RFC4583] defines a mechanism\n      in SDP to\
    \ signal floor control streams that use BFCP.  It is used\n      for push-to-talk\
    \ and conference floor control.\n   CONNECT-PRECON, Connectivity Preconditions\
    \ for Session Description\n   Protocol Media Streams (S):  [CONNECT-PRECON] defines\
    \ a usage of the\n      precondition framework [RFC3312].  The connectivity precondition\n\
    \      makes sure that the session doesn't get established until actual\n    \
    \  packet connectivity is checked.\n   RFC 4796, The SDP (Session Description\
    \ Protocol) Content Attribute\n   (S):  [RFC4796] defines an SDP attribute for\
    \ describing the purpose\n      of a media stream.  Examples include a slide view,\
    \ the speaker, a\n      sign language feed, and so on.\n   IPv6-TRANS, IPv6 Transition\
    \ in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   (S):  [IPv6-TRANS] defines practices\
    \ for interworking between IPv6\n      and IPv6 user agents.  This is done through\
    \ multi-homed proxies\n      that interwork IPv4 and IPv6, along with ICE [ICE]\
    \ for media\n      traversal.  The specification includes some minor extensions\
    \ and\n      clarifications to SDP in order to cover some additional cases.\n\
    \   CONNECT-REUSE, Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP)\
    \ (S):  [CONNECT-REUSE] defines an extension to SIP that allows a\n      Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) connection between servers to be\n      reused for requests\
    \ in both directions.  Normally, two connections\n      are set up between a pair\
    \ of servers, one for requests in each\n      direction.\n"
- title: 15.  Security Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "15.  Security Mechanisms\n   Several extensions provide additional security features\
    \ to SIP.\n   RFC 4474, Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in\
    \ SIP\n   (S):  [RFC4474] defines a mechanism for providing a cryptographically\n\
    \      verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP request.  Known\n   \
    \   as \"SIP Identity\", this mechanism provides an alternative to RFC\n     \
    \ 3325.  It has seen little deployment so far, but its importance as\n      a\
    \ key construct for anti-spam techniques and new security\n      mechanisms makes\
    \ it a core part of the SIP specifications.\n   RFC 4916, Connected Identity in\
    \ the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   (S):  [RFC4916] formally updates RFC\
    \ 3261.  It defines an extension\n      to SIP that allows a calling user to determine\
    \ the identity of the\n      final called user (connected party).  Due to forwarding\
    \ and\n      retargeting services, this may not be the same as the user that\n\
    \      the caller was originally trying to reach.  The mechanism works in\n  \
    \    tandem with the SIP identity specification [RFC4474] to provide\n      signatures\
    \ over the connected party identity.  It can also be used\n      if a party identity\
    \ changes mid call due to third party call\n      control actions or PSTN behavior.\n\
    \   SIPS-URI, The Use of the SIPS URI Scheme in the Session Initiation\n   Protocol\
    \ (SIP) (S):  [SIPS-URI] is intended to update RFC 3261.  It\n      revises the\
    \ processing of the SIPS URI, originally defined in RFC\n      3261, to fix many\
    \ errors and problems that have been encountered\n      with that mechanism.\n\
    \   DOMAIN-CERTS, Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP)\
    \ (B):  [DOMAIN-CERTS] clarifies the usage of SIP over TLS with\n      regards\
    \ to certificate handling, and defines additional procedures\n      needed for\
    \ interoperability.\n   RFC 3323, A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation\
    \ Protocol\n   (SIP) (S):  [RFC3323] defines the Privacy header field, used by\n\
    \      clients to request anonymity for their requests.  Though it\n      defines\
    \ several privacy services, the only one broadly used is the\n      one that supports\
    \ privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity header field\n      [RFC3325].\n   RFC 4567,\
    \ Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP) and Real\
    \ Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (S):  [RFC4567] defines\n      extensions to\
    \ SDP that allow tunneling of a key management\n      protocol, namely MIKEY [RFC3830],\
    \ through offer/answer exchanges.\n      This mechanism is one of three Secure\
    \ Realtime Transport Protocol\n      (SRTP) keying techniques specified for SIP,\
    \ with Datagram\n      Transport Layer Security (DTLS)-SRTP [SRTP-FRAME] having\
    \ been\n      selected as the final solution.\n   RFC 4568, Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions\n   for Media Streams (S):  [RFC4568] defines\
    \ extensions to SDP that\n      allow for the negotiation of keying material directly\
    \ through\n      offer/answer, without a separate key management protocol.  This\n\
    \      mechanism, sometimes called sdescriptions, has the drawback that\n    \
    \  the media keys are available to any entity that has visibility to\n      the\
    \ SDP.  It is one of three SRTP keying techniques specified for\n      SIP, with\
    \ DTLS-SRTP [SRTP-FRAME] having been selected as the final\n      solution.\n\
    \   SRTP-FRAME, Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using\n  \
    \ DTLS (S):  [SRTP-FRAME] defines the overall framework and SDP and SIP\n    \
    \  processing required to perform key management for RTP using\n      Datagram\
    \ TLS (DTLS) [RFC4347] directly between endpoints, over the\n      media path.\
    \  It is one of three SRTP keying techniques specified\n      for SIP, with DTLS-SRTP\
    \ [SRTP-FRAME] having been selected as the\n      final solution.\n   RFC 3853,\
    \ S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for\n   SIP (S):  [RFC3853]\
    \ formally updates RFC 3261.  It is a brief\n      specification that updates\
    \ the cryptography mechanisms used in SIP\n      S/MIME.  However, SIP S/MIME\
    \ has seen very little deployment.\n   CERTS, Certificate Management Service for\
    \ the Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) (S):  [CERTS] defines a certificate\
    \ service for SIP\n      whose purpose is to facilitate the deployment of S/MIME.\
    \  The\n      certificate service allows clients to store and retrieve their own\n\
    \      certificates, in addition to obtaining the certificates for other\n   \
    \   users.\n   RFC 3893, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated Identity\n\
    \   Body (AIB) Format (S):  [RFC3893] defines a SIP message fragment that\n  \
    \    can be signed in order to provide an authenticated identity over a\n    \
    \  request.  It was an early predecessor to [RFC4474], and\n      consequently\
    \ AIB has seen no deployment.\n   SAML, SIP SAML Profile and Binding (S):  [SAML]\
    \ defines the usage of\n      the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) within\
    \ SIP, and\n      describes how to use it in conjunction with SIP identity [RFC4474]\n\
    \      to provide authenticated assertions about a user's role or\n      attributes.\n\
    \   RFC 5360, A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session\n  \
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) (S):  [RFC5360] defines several extensions\n     \
    \ to SIP, including the Trigger-Consent and Permission-Missing\n      header fields.\
    \  These header fields, in addition to the other\n      procedures defined in\
    \ the document, define a way to manage\n      membership on \"SIP mailing lists\"\
    \ used for instant messaging or\n      conferencing.  In particular, it helps\
    \ avoid the problem of using\n      such amplification services for the purposes\
    \ of an attack on the\n      network by making sure a user authorizes the addition\
    \ of their\n      address onto such a service.\n   RFC 5361, A Document Format\
    \ for Requesting Consent (S):  [RFC5361]\n      defines an XML object used by\
    \ the consent framework.  Consent\n      documents are sent from SIP \"mailing\
    \ list servers\" to users to\n      allow them to manage their membership on lists.\n\
    \   RFC 5362, The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Pending Additions\n   Event\
    \ Package (S):  [RFC5362] defines a SIP event package that allows\n      a UA\
    \ to learn whether consent has been given for the addition of\n      an address\
    \ to a SIP \"mailing list\".  It is used in conjunction\n      with the SIP framework\
    \ for consent [RFC5360].\n   RFC 3329, Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP (S):\
    \  [RFC3329]\n      defines a mechanism to prevent bid-down attacks in conjunction\n\
    \      with SIP authentication.  The mechanism has seen very limited\n      deployment.\
    \  It was defined as part of the 3GPP IP Multimedia\n      Subsystem (IMS) specification\
    \ suite [3GPP.24.229], and is needed\n      only when there is a multiplicity\
    \ of security mechanisms deployed\n      at a particular server.  In practice,\
    \ this has not been the case.\n   RFC 4572, Connection-Oriented Media Transport\
    \ over the Transport\n   Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description\
    \ Protocol\n   (SDP) (S):  [RFC4572] specifies a mechanism for signaling TLS-based\n\
    \      media streams between endpoints.  It expands the TCP-based media\n    \
    \  signaling parameters defined in [RFC4145] to include fingerprint\n      information\
    \ for TLS streams so that TLS can operate between end\n      hosts using self-signed\
    \ certificates.\n   RFC 5027, Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol\n\
    \   Media Streams (S):  [RFC5027] defines a precondition for use with the\n  \
    \    preconditions framework [RFC3312].  The security precondition\n      prevents\
    \ a session from being established until a security media\n      stream is set\
    \ up.\n   RFC 3310, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication\n\
    \   Using Authentication and Key Agreement (S):  [RFC3310] defines an\n      extension\
    \ to digest authentication to allow it to work with the\n      credentials stored\
    \ in cell phones.  Though technically it is an\n      extension to HTTP digest,\
    \ its primary application is SIP.  This\n      extension is useful primarily to\
    \ implementors of IMS.\n   RFC 4169, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest\
    \ Authentication\n   Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2 (S):\n\
    \      [RFC4169] is an enhancement to [RFC3310] that further improves\n      security\
    \ of the authentication.\n"

    \ as their\n   primary application.\n   RFC 4574, The SDP (Session Description\
    \ Protocol) Label Attribute\n   (S):  [RFC4574] defines an SDP attribute for providing\
    \ an opaque\n      label for media streams.  These labels can be referred to by\n\
    \      external documents, and in particular, by conference policy\n      documents.\
    \  This allows a UA to tie together documents it may\n      obtain through conferencing\
    \ mechanisms to media streams to which\n      they refer.\n   RFC 3911, The SIP\
    \ Join Header Field (S):  [RFC3911] defines the Join\n      header field.  When\
    \ sent in an INVITE, it causes the recipient to\n      join the resulting dialog\
    \ into a conference with another dialog in\n      progress.\n   RFC 4575, A SIP\

    \ membership.\n   RFC 5368, Referring to Multiple Resources in SIP (S):  [RFC5368]\n\
    \      allows a UA sending a REFER to ask the recipient of the REFER to\n    \
    \  generate multiple SIP requests, not just one.  This is useful for\n      conferencing,\
    \ where a client would like to ask a conference server\n      to eject multiple\
    \ users.\n   RFC 5366, Conference Establishment Using Request-Contained Lists\
    \ in\n   SIP (S):  [RFC5366] is similar to [RFC5367].  However, instead of\n \
    \     subscribing to the resource, an INVITE request is sent to the\n      resource,\
    \ and it will act as a conference focus and generate an\n      invitation to each\
