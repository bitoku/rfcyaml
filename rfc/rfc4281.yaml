  - "Abstract\n   Several MIME type/subtype combinations exist that can contain\n\
    \   different media formats.  A receiving agent thus needs to examine the\n  \
    \ details of such media content to determine if the specific elements\n   can\
    \ be rendered given an available set of codecs.  Especially when\n   the end system\
    \ has limited resources, or the connection to the end\n   system has limited bandwidth,\
    \ it would be helpful to know from the\n   Content-Type alone if the content can\

    \ codecs\n   indicated by the media formats contained within.\n   By labeling\
    \ content with the specific codecs indicated to render the\n   contained media,\
    \ receiving systems can determine if the codecs are\n   supported by the end system,\
    \ and if not, can take appropriate action\n   (such as rejecting the content,\
    \ sending notification of the\n   situation, transcoding the content to a supported\
    \ type, fetching and\n   installing the required codecs, further inspection to\
    \ determine if it\n   will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated\
    \ codecs, etc.)\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the original motivations for MIME is the ability\
    \ to identify\n   the specific media type of a message part.  However, due to\
    \ various\n   factors, it is not always possible from looking at the MIME type\
    \ and\n   subtype to know which specific media formats are contained in the\n\
    \   body part, or which codecs are indicated in order to render the\n   content.\n\
    \   There are several media type/subtypes (either currently registered or\n  \
    \ deployed with registration pending) that contain codecs chosen from a\n   set.\
    \  It is currently necessary to examine each media element in\n   order to determine\
    \ the codecs required to render the content.  For\n   example, video/3gpp may\
    \ contain any of the video formats H.263\n   Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264,\
    \ MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or any\n   of the audio formats Adaptive Multi Rate\
    \ (AMR), Adaptive Multi Rate -\n   WideBand (AMR-WB), Extended AMR-WB, Advanced\
    \ Audio Coding (AAC), or\n   Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in [3GPP-Formats].\n\
    \   In some cases, the specific codecs can be determined by examining the\n  \
    \ header information of the media content.  While this isn't as bad as\n   examining\
    \ the entire content, it still requires specialized knowledge\n   of each format\
    \ and is resource consumptive.\n   This ambiguity can be a problem for various\
    \ clients and servers.  It\n   presents a significant burden to Multimedia Messaging\
    \ (MMS) servers,\n   which must examine the media sent in each message in order\
    \ to\n   determine which codecs are required to render the content.  Only then\n\
    \   can such a server determine if the content requires transcoding or\n   specialized\
    \ handling prior to being transmitted to the handset.\n   Additionally, it presents\
    \ a challenge to smart clients on devices\n   with constrained memory, processing\
    \ power, or transmission bandwidth\n   (such as cellular telephones and PDAs).\
    \  Such clients often need to\n   determine in advance if they are currently capable\
    \ of rendering the\n   content contained in an MMS or email message.\n   Current\
    \ ambiguity:\n   o   audio/3gpp can contain AMR, AAC, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB,\
    \ or\n       Enhanced aacPlus contents as specified in [3GPP-Formats].\n   o \
    \  audio/3gpp2 can contain AMR, AAC, 13K (as per [13k]), Enhanced\n       Variable\
    \ Rate Codec (EVRC), Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV),\n       or VMR-WB, as specified\
    \ in [3GPP2-Formats].\n   o   video/3gpp can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile\
    \ 3, H.264,\n       MPEG-4 Simple Profile, and/or AMR, AMR-WB, Extended AMR-WB,\
    \ AAC,\n       or Enhanced aacPlus, as specified in [3GPP-Formats].\n   o   video/3gpp2\
    \ can contain H.263 Profile 0, H.263 Profile 3, H.264,\n       MPEG-4 Simple Profile,\
    \ and/or AMR, AAC, 13K (as per [13k]),\n       EVRC, SMV, or VMR-WB, as specified\
    \ in [3GPP2-Formats].\n   Note that there are additional media types that are\
    \ ambiguous, but\n   are outside the scope of this document, including:\n   o\
    \   video/mpeg4-generic, which can contain anything allowed by the\n       MPEG-4\
    \ specification, or any codec registered with the MP4\n       registration authority\
    \ [MP4-Reg];\n   o   video/quicktime, which can contain anything for which there\
    \ is a\n       QuickTime codec component; since QuickTime is extensible, this\n\
    \       is not limited to the codecs that are or have been shipped by\n      \
    \ Apple Computer.\n   With each \"bucket\" type, a receiving agent only knows\
    \ that it has a\n   container format.  It doesn't even know whether content labeled\n\
    \   video/3gpp or video/3gpp2 contains video; it might be audio only,\n   audio\
    \ and video, or video only.\n   A solution that permits a receiving agent to determine\
    \ the specific\n   codecs required to render media content would help provide\
    \ efficient\n   and scalable servers, especially for Multimedia Messaging (MMS),\
    \ and\n   aid the growth of multimedia services in wireless networks.\n"

- title: 3.  The Codecs Parameter
  contents:
  - "3.  The Codecs Parameter\n   This document adds a parameter to allow unambiguous\
    \ specification of\n   all codecs indicated to render the content in the MIME\
    \ part.  This\n   parameter is optional in all current types to which it is added.\n\
    \   Future types that contain ambiguity are strongly encouraged to\n   include\
    \ this parameter.\n   Media types:\n       audio/3gpp,\n       audio/3gpp2,\n\
    \       video/3gpp,\n       video/3gpp2,\n   Parameter name:\n       Codecs\n\
    \   Parameter value:  A single value, or a comma-separated list of values\n  \
    \      identifying the codec(s) indicated to render the content in the\n     \
    \   body part.\n        Each value consists of one or more dot-separated elements.\
    \  The\n        name space for the first element is determined by the MIME type.\n\
    \        The name space for each subsequent element is determined by the\n   \
    \     preceding element.\n        Note that, per [MIME-Format], some characters\
    \ (including the\n        comma used to separate multiple values) require that\
    \ the entire\n        parameter value be enclosed in quotes.\n        An element\
    \ MAY include an octet that must be encoded in order to\n        comply with [MIME-Format].\
    \  In this case, [MIME-Coding] is used:\n        an asterisk (\"*\") is placed\
    \ at the end of the parameter name\n        (becoming \"codecs*\" instead of \"\
    codecs\"), the parameter value\n        usually starts with two single quote (\"\
    '\") characters\n        (indicating that neither character set nor language is\n\
    \        specified), and each octet that requires encoding is represented\n  \
    \      as a percent sign (\"%\") followed by two hexadecimal digits.\n       \
    \ Note that, when the [MIME-Coding] form is used, the percent\n        sign, asterisk,\
    \ and single quote characters have special meaning\n        and so must themselves\
    \ be encoded.\n        Examples of Generic Syntax:\n            codecs=a.bb.ccc.d\n\
    \            codecs=\"a.bb.ccc.d, e.fff\"\n            codecs*=''fo%2e\n     \
    \       codecs*=\"''%25%20xz, gork\"\n   When the Codecs parameter is used, it\
    \ MUST contain all codecs\n   indicated by the content present in the body part.\
    \  The Codecs\n   parameter MUST NOT include any codecs that are not indicated\
    \ by any\n   media elements in the body part.\n   In some cases, not all indicated\
    \ codecs are absolutely required in\n   order to render the content.  Therefore,\
    \ when a receiver does not\n   support all listed codecs, special handling MAY\
    \ be required.  For\n   example, the media element(s) MAY need to be examined\
    \ in order to\n   determine if an unsupported codec is actually required (e.g.,\
    \ there\n   may be alternative tracks (such as English and Spanish audio), there\n\
    \   may be timed text that can be dropped, etc.)\n   NOTE:  Although the parameter\
    \ value MUST be complete and accurate in\n   'breadth' (that is, it MUST report\
    \ all four-character codes used in\n   all tracks for ISO-family files, for example)\
    \ systems MUST NOT rely\n   on it being complete in 'depth'.  If the hierarchical\
    \ rules for a\n   given code (e.g., 'qvxy') were written after a server was\n\
    \   implemented, for example, that server will not know what elements to\n   place\
    \ after 'qvxy'.\n   If a receiver encounters a body part whose Codecs parameter\
    \ contains\n   codecs that are not indicated by any media elements, then the\n\
    \   receiver SHOULD process the body part by discarding the information\n   in\
    \ the Codecs parameter.\n   If a receiver encounters a body part whose Codecs\
    \ parameter does not\n   contain all codecs indicated by the media elements, then\
    \ the receiver\n   MAY process the body part by discarding the information in\
    \ the Codecs\n   parameter.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  ISO File Format Name Space\n   For the ISO Base Media File Format, the\
    \ first element of a Codecs\n   parameter value is a sample description entry\
    \ four-character code as\n   registered by the MP4 Registration Authority [MP4-Reg].\
    \  Values are\n   case sensitive.\n   Note that there are potentially multiple\
    \ tracks in a file, each\n   potentially carrying multiple sample entries (some\
    \ but not all uses\n   of the ISO File Format restrict the number of sample entries\
    \ in a\n   track to one).\n   When the first element of a value is 'mp4a' (indicating\
    \ some kind of\n   MPEG-4 audio) or 'mp4v' (indicating some kind of MPEG-4 part-2\n\
    \   video), the second element is the hexadecimal representation of the\n   MP4\
    \ Registration Authority ObjectTypeIndication (OTI), as specified\n   in [MP4-Reg]\
    \ and [MP41] (including amendments).  Note that [MP4-Reg]\n   uses a leading \"\
