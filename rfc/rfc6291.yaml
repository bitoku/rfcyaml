- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The main purpose of this document is to provide a definition\
    \ of the\n   acronym \"OAM\" (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) for\
    \ use\n   in all future IETF documents that refer to OAM.\n   The acronym \"OAM\"\
    \ is frequently used in the data and\n   telecommunication industry.  One would\
    \ assume that something that is\n   so widely used is very clearly defined.  However,\
    \ a closer look\n   reveals some points that need to be clarified.\n   If such\
    \ an important piece of our technology is so poorly defined, or\n   if there are\
    \ dialects of the technology with different understandings\n   of such a key concept,\
    \ this will eventually cause problems.\n   Trying to understand the use of an\
    \ acronym that is as \"content-rich\"\n   as OAM reveals two levels of complexity.\
    \  First, each letter in the\n   acronym represents an integrated piece of functionality.\
    \  Second, the\n   acronym, as such, represents something that is more than just\
    \ the sum\n   of its parts.\n   There is also the issue of how each piece of the\
    \ acronym is defined.\n   This document provides an analysis of what each initial\
    \ of the\n   initialism represents and provides possible interpretations of the\n\
    \   acronym.  Finally, a recommendation for the interpretation of the\n   \"OAM\"\
    \ acronym is provided.\n   Another useful document to make the \"OAM\" term understandable\
    \ in a\n   wider scope is found in \"An Overview of Operations, Administration,\n\
    \   and Maintenance (OAM) Mechanisms\" [OAM-OVERVIEW].\n"

  - "2.  Pre-Existing Uses of OAM\n   This section provides information on how OAM\
    \ is used in other SDOs\n   (Standards Development Organizations) and provides\
    \ the background\n   necessary to understand the how the term is used in the IETF.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Uses of OAM in Other SDOs
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Uses of OAM in Other SDOs\n   Operations And Maintenance (OAM): A group\
    \ of network management\n   functions that provide network fault indication, performance\n\
    \   information, and data and diagnosis functions.  ATM OAM ITU-T I.610\n   [ITU-T-I.610]\
    \ is an example specification that uses this expansion of\n   the \"OAM\" acronym.\n\
    \   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM): A group of network\n  \
    \ management functions that provide network fault indication, fault\n   localization,\
    \ performance information, and data and diagnosis\n   functions.  Examples where\
    \ this acronym is used are Clause 57 of IEEE\n   802.3-2008 [IEEE.802.3-2008]\
    \ and ITU-T Y.1731 [ITU-T-Y.1731].\n   The ITU-T M.3010 [ITU-T-M.3010] Recommendation\
    \ defines operations\n   systems function as a function block that processes information\n\
    \   related to the telecommunications management for the purpose of\n   monitoring/coordinating\
    \ and/or controlling telecommunication\n   functions including management functions\
    \ (i.e., the TMN\n   (Telecommunications Management Network) itself).\n   The\
    \ Metro Ethernet Forum refers to OAM as the tools and utilities to\n   install,\
    \ monitor, and troubleshoot a network, helping carriers run\n   their networks\
    \ more effectively MEF 17 [MEF-17].\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  The "O" in OAM
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  The \"O\" in OAM\n   The \"O\" in OAM invariably stands for \"Operations\"\
    .  However, there is\n   some ambivalence in the definition and scope of the term\
    \ \"Operation\".\n   Examples of tools related to \"operations\" are performance\
    \ monitoring\n   tools used for service level agreement (SLA) measurement, fault\n\
    \   management tools used to monitor the health of nodes and links in the\n  \
    \ network, and network provisioning tools.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  The "A" in OAM
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  The \"A\" in OAM\n   The \"A\" in OAM stands for \"Administration\".\n\
    \   Examples of \"administration\" tools are network discovery and planning\n\
    \   tools.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  The "M" in OAM
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  The \"M\" in OAM\n   The \"M\" in OAM stands for \"Maintenance\" or \"\
    Management\".\n   Examples of \"maintenance\" tools are implementations of connectivity\n\
    \   check, loopback, link trace, and other tools that can be used to\n   monitor\
    \ and diagnose failures in a network or network element.\n   The Recommendation\
    \ ITU-T M.20 [ITU-T-M.20] defines maintenance as the\n   whole of operations required\
    \ for setting up and maintaining, within\n   prescribed limits, any element involved\
    \ in the setting up of a\n   connection (see the ITU-T M.60 [ITU-T-M.60] Recommendation).\
    \  The\n   purpose is to properly plan and program the maintenance operations\n\
    \   required to establish and maintain a network.\n   A major aim of the concept\
    \ of maintenance is to minimize both the\n   occurrence and the impact of failures\
    \ and to ensure that in case of a\n   failure the correct actions are taken.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Uses of OAM in the IETF
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Uses of OAM in the IETF\n   The examples below show a number of different\
    \ ways that the \"OAM\"\n   acronym has been expanded in IETF RFCs.  The reference\
    \ list is not\n   exhaustive.\n   o  OAM = Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\
    \ in RFC 5586\n      [RFC5586]\n   o  OAM = Operations and Maintenance in RFC\
    \ 3429 [RFC3429]\n   o  OAM = Operations and Management in RFC 4377 [RFC4377]\n\
    \   o  O&M = OAM and Maintenance in RFC 1812 [RFC1812]\n   Sometimes there is\
    \ a fourth letter added to the acronym:\n   o  OAM&P = Operations, Administration,\
    \ Maintenance and Provisioning\n      in RFC 4594 [RFC4594]\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendations on the Use of the "OAM" Acronym
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendations on the Use of the \"OAM\" Acronym\n   The IETF-recommended\
    \ expansion of the \"OAM\" acronym is given below.\n   In addition to the \"OAM\"\
    \ acronym, two other recommendations are made\n   in this section.\n   o  OAM\
    \ - Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   o  O&M - OAM and Management\n\
    \   o  \"Mgmt\" - Management\n   The components of the \"OAM\" acronym (and provisioning)\
    \ are defined as\n   follows:\n   o  Operations - Operation activities are undertaken\
    \ to keep the\n      network (and the services that the network provides) up and\n\
    \      running.  It includes monitoring the network and finding problems.\n  \
    \    Ideally these problems should be found before users are affected.\n   o \
    \ Administration - Administration activities involve keeping track\n      of resources\
    \ in the network and how they are used.  It includes\n      all the bookkeeping\
    \ that is necessary to track networking\n      resources and the network under\
    \ control.\n   o  Maintenance - Maintenance activities are focused on facilitating\n\
    \      repairs and upgrades -- for example, when equipment must be\n      replaced,\
    \ when a router needs a patch for an operating system\n      image, or when a\
    \ new switch is added to a network.  Maintenance\n      also involves corrective\
    \ and preventive measures to make the\n      managed network run more effectively,\
    \ e.g., adjusting device\n      configuration and parameters.\n   \"Provisioning\"\
    \ is outside the scope of this document, but the\n   following definition is provided\
    \ for completeness.\n   o  Provisioning - Provisioning activities involve configuring\n\
    \      resources in the network to support the offered services.  This\n     \
    \ might include setting up the network so that a new customer can\n      receive\
    \ an Internet access service.\n   In general, Provisioning is used to configure\
    \ the network to provide\n   new services, whereas OAM is used to keep the network\
    \ in a state that\n   it can support already existing services.\n   Sometimes\
    \ it is necessary to talk about the combination of functions\n   and tools supplied\
    \ by OAM and Management, it is preferred that this\n   is spelled out as \"OAM\
    \ and Management\".  In cases where an acronym is\n   needed, O&M should be used.\n\
    \   \"Mgmt\" will be used if an abbreviation for \"Management\" is needed.\n \
    \  This document does not define Management.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides guidance for the use of\
    \ the \"OAM\" acronym in\n   other documents.  This document does not have direct\
    \ security\n   implications.\n   The misunderstanding of an acronym may lead to\
    \ incorrect\n   specification or implementation which may, in turn, open up security\n\
    \   concerns with protocols or deployed networks.  Clarifying the meaning\n  \
    \ of OAM is, therefore, a benefit for future stability of\n   specifications.\n"
