- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   I would like to propose a new scheme which I believe is a good\
    \ medium\n   term solution to the routing and address problems of the internet.\n\
    \   It has the following positive attributes:\n      - No Changes to Hosts\n \
    \     - No Changes to Most Routers\n      - No New Routing Protocols\n      -\
    \ No New Internet Protocols\n      - No Translation of Addresses in Packets\n\
    \      - Reduces the Routing Table Size in All Routers\n      - Uses the Current\
    \ Internet Address Structure\n   It is not a solution good for all time, because\
    \ it does impose some\n   size limits and does not support new internet services\
    \ such as\n   guaranteed bandwidth, delay, etc.  It does require border routers\
    \ to\n   do additional processing, but does not require any packet\n   translation.\
    \  I believe that this scheme will give us enough time to\n   put into place a\
    \ long term solution (i.e. pick one or more of CLNP,\n   *NAT, IDPR, IDRP, Nimrod,\
    \ Unified, NewIP, etc.)\n   This scheme is based on the ideas presented by Deborah\
    \ Estrin (route\n   on ADs), Martha Steenstrup (encapsulation), and probably steals\
    \ from\n   ideas put forward by Noel Chiappa, Van Jacobson , Ross Callon, Dave\n\
    \   Oran, and everyone else in the ROAD group.\n"
- title: CONTEXT
  contents:
  - "CONTEXT\n   I think that we (the ROAD group) agree that in the short term we\
    \ need\n   to make better use of the IP address space.  I think we also (mostly)\n\
    \   agree that in the long term we need a solution that can deal with a\n   very\
    \ large number of end points and routes, as well as support new\n   services such\
    \ as guarantees of service, source selected routes, etc.\n   We do not agree on\
    \ any of the details of this but do agree that we\n   can not figure out a long\
    \ term solution before March.  We do agree\n   that we should start working on\
    \ a long term solution(s).\n   What this leaves is the need for a good medium\
    \ term solution which\n   can keep the Internet going until we can design and\
    \ deploy a long\n   term solution.  The medium term solution wants to be the most\
    \ \"cost\n   effective\".  It should buy us the most time to develop a long term\n\
    \   solution and do it with as little change to the existing Internet as\n   possible.\n\
    \   I propose this scheme as a new medium term solution.\n"
- title: NEW SCHEME
  contents:
  - "NEW SCHEME\n   The basic idea is that inter-domain routing be done by routing\
    \ on\n   autonomous domains (AD).  The key is how this is done.  The mechanism\n\
    \   to do this is for the border routers to encapsulate the original IP\n   datagrams\
    \ with another IP header.  The source and destination\n   addresses in the new\
    \ header (I will call it the AD-Header from here\n   on) represent the source\
    \ and destination ADs.\n   When the first (entrance) border router receives a\
    \ datagram from a\n   host or router without an AD-Header it looks at the source\
    \ and\n   destination address and does a DNS lookup to get the addresses for\n\
    \   the AD-Header.  It then adds an AD-Header and forwards the\n   encapsulated\
    \ datagram to its proper destination AD.\n   The border routers would compute\
    \ AD routes by running a routing\n   protocol between themselves.  BGP or even\
    \ IS-IS or OSPF for that\n   matter, would work fine.  As you will see later,\
    \ they might even be\n   better.\n   The addresses I propose to use for the AD\
    \ addresses are plain old IP\n   addresses.  A small number of Class A and Class\
    \ B addresses would be\n   reserved for this purpose.  The network number of the\
    \ address would\n   indicate that it was an AD identifier.  The local part of\
    \ the address\n   would indicate the actual AD.  This would allow for many ADs\
    \ to be\n   supported.  For example, 10 Class-A and 10 Class-B addresses could\n\
    \   accommodate (10*2^24 + 10*2^16) 168,427,500 ADs.  We clearly don't\n   need\
    \ that many for a long time.\n   The reason why I would chose to get more than\
    \ one network number to\n   use to represent the AD address is I would use them\
    \ to organize the\n   ADs.  Let's call them commonwealths.  Each commonwealth\
    \ would only\n   have to know the detail of it's own ADs.\n   Next I would have\
    \ the border routers inject these AD addresses into\n   the Intra-AD routing of\
    \ transit ADs.  They would tell the routers\n   inside of the transit AD that\
    \ they (the border routers) were the\n   route to each appropriate AD network.\
    \  Commonwealths that have\n   multiple interconnects (probably the common case)\
    \ could by the use of\n   careful assignment of the AD addresses use subnetting\
    \ to support\n   reasonable routing between the commonwealths.  This is where\
    \ OSPF or\n   IS-IS might be better than BGP.  Also, IS-IS, with its ability to\n\
    \   route on actual end points might be the best.\n   The motivation behind injecting\
    \ the AD addresses into the Intra-AD\n   routing of the transit ADs, is that the\
    \ routers in these ADs can\n   forward the AD-Headers without knowing that they\
    \ are special.  Only\n   the entrance and exit border routers are required to\
    \ do anything\n   different.\n   Finally when a AD-Header is received at the last\
    \ (exit) border router\n   it strips off the AD-Header and sends the datagram\
    \ to the final\n   destination.\n   This scheme is based around the idea that\
    \ IP addresses are globally\n   unique.  I think that we will not actually run\
    \ out of IP addresses\n   for a long time and that we can live with the current\
    \ addressing\n   until we can deploy a long term solution.\n   This scheme could\
    \ be extended to not require globally unique IP\n   address.  Effectively the\
    \ combination of AD-Address and IP-Address is\n   the globally unique address.\
    \  To use this scheme without globally\n   unique IP-Addresses and without changing\
    \ in the hosts would require a\n   NAT mechanism in the border routers.  I think\
    \ it would be preferable\n   to change the hosts to have them do the DNS query\
    \ and add the AD-\n   header.  This could be the basis for the long term solution.\n\
    \   Another interesting aspect of this scheme is that if we were to relax\n  \
    \ the current architecture where one IP-Address is always in only one\n   AD,\
    \ to allow an IP-Address to be in more than one AD, it would\n   provide a solution\
    \ to the issue of allowing a IP entity to get\n   service from more than one service\
    \ provider.\n"
- title: SUMMARY OF CHANGES REQUIRED
  contents:
  - "SUMMARY OF CHANGES REQUIRED\n   The DNS needs to be extended to add an AD-Address\
    \ entry for each\n   name.  These will be used by the entry and exit border routers\
    \ to get\n   the AD-Addresses to use when building the AD-Headers.\n   Border\
    \ routers need to be extended to do the DNS lookup, perform AD-\n   Header encapsulation,\
    \ run an inter-AD routing algorithm using AD-\n   Addresses, and be able to AD-Header\
    \ de-encapsulation.\n"
- title: CONCLUSION
  contents:
  - "CONCLUSION\n   I believe that this scheme has may advantages.  These are:\n \
    \     - Only border routers and the DNS need change.  No changes are\n       \
    \ required in hosts or non-border routers.\n      - No performance impact on datagram\
    \ forwarding except at entry\n        and exit border routers.\n      - Only a\
    \ small impact on bandwidth utilization on transit\n        networks due the addition\
    \ of a 20 byte IP header to each\n        datagram.\n      - Removes the Inter-AD\
    \ routing from Intra-AD routing and as a\n        result solves the routing load\
    \ (table size and computation)\n        problem for the foreseeable future.\n\
    \      - The routing load on the border routers is manageable because\n      \
    \  border routers only need to know the detail of the routing\n        commonwealth\
    \ they are a member of.  Other commonwealths appear\n        as single addresses.\n\
    \      - No requirement for new routing protocols to be designed or\n        deployed.\n\
    \      - No translation of packets from one address scheme to another.\n     \
    \ - Uses the current IP addressing structure.\n      - It scales well even if\
    \ there is on the order of one AD per IP\n        network, because the AD-Addresses\
    \ can be assigned logically.\n   It does have some disadvantages.  These are (at\
    \ least):\n      - It is not a long term solution in its initial form.\n     \
    \ - It assumes that the current IP-Addresses can remain globally\n        unique\
    \ for a long time.\n"
