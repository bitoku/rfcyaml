  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital\n  \
    \ certificates.  It is used for carrying these certificates in Host\n   Identity\
    \ Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the\n   certificate\
    \ parameter and the error signaling in case of a failed\n   verification.  Additionally,\
    \ this document specifies the\n   representations of Host Identity Tags (HITs)\
    \ in X.509 version 3 (v3).\n   The concrete use cases of certificates, including\
    \ how certificates\n   are obtained and requested and which actions are taken\
    \ upon\n   successful or failed verification, are specific to the scenario in\n\
    \   which the certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these\n   scenario-specific\
    \ aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT\n   parameter.\n   This document\
    \ updates RFC 7401 and obsoletes RFC 6253.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Digital certificates bind pieces of information to a public\
    \ key by\n   means of a digital signature and thus enable the holder of a private\n\
    \   key to generate cryptographically verifiable statements.  The Host\n   Identity\
    \ Protocol (HIP) [RFC7401] defines a new cryptographic\n   namespace based on\
    \ asymmetric cryptography.  The identity of each\n   host is derived from a public\
    \ key, allowing hosts to digitally sign\n   data and issue certificates with their\
    \ private key.  This document\n   specifies the CERT parameter, which is used\
    \ to transmit digital\n   certificates in HIP.  It fills the placeholder specified\
    \ in\n   Section 5.2 of [RFC7401] and thus updates [RFC7401].\n"

- title: 2.  CERT Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.  CERT Parameter\n   The CERT parameter is a container for certain types of\
    \ digital\n   certificates.  It does not specify any certificate semantics.\n\
    \   However, it defines supplementary parameters that help HIP hosts to\n   transmit\
    \ semantically grouped CERT parameters in a more systematic\n   way.  The specific\
    \ use of the CERT parameter for different use cases\n   is intentionally not discussed\
    \ in this document.  Hence, the use of\n   the CERT parameter will be defined\
    \ in the documents that use the CERT\n   parameter.\n   The CERT parameter is\
    \ covered and protected, when present, by the HIP\n   SIGNATURE field and is a\
    \ non-critical parameter.\n   The CERT parameter can be used in all HIP packets.\
    \  However, using it\n   in the first Initiator (I1) packet is NOT RECOMMENDED\
    \ because it can\n   increase the processing times of I1s, which can be problematic\
    \ when\n   processing storms of I1s.  Each HIP control packet MAY contain\n  \
    \ multiple CERT parameters, each carrying one certificate.  These\n   parameters\
    \ MAY be related or unrelated.  Related certificates are\n   managed in CERT groups.\
    \  A CERT group specifies a group of related\n   CERT parameters that SHOULD be\
    \ interpreted in a certain order (e.g.,\n   for expressing certificate chains).\
    \  Ungrouped certificates exhibit a\n   unique CERT group field and set the CERT\
    \ count to 1.  CERT parameters\n   with the same group number in the CERT group\
    \ field indicate a logical\n   grouping.  The CERT count field indicates the number\
    \ of CERT\n   parameters in the group.\n   CERT parameters that belong to the\
    \ same CERT group MAY be contained\n   in multiple sequential HIP control packets.\
    \  This is indicated by a\n   higher CERT count than the amount of CERT parameters\
    \ with matching\n   CERT group fields in a HIP control packet.  The CERT parameters\
    \ MUST\n   be placed in ascending order, within a HIP control packet, according\n\
    \   to their CERT group field.  CERT groups MAY only span multiple\n   packets\
    \ if the CERT group does not fit the packet.  A HIP packet MUST\n   NOT contain\
    \ more than one incomplete CERT group that continues in the\n   next HIP control\
    \ packet.\n   The CERT ID acts as a sequence number to identify the certificates\
    \ in\n   a CERT group.  The numbers in the CERT ID field MUST start from 1 up\n\
    \   to CERT count.\n   The CERT group and CERT ID namespaces are managed locally\
    \ by each\n   host that sends CERT parameters in HIP control packets.\n      0\

    \   The next sections outline the use of HITs in X.509 v3.  X.509 v3\n   certificates\
    \ and the handling procedures are defined in [RFC5280].\n   The wire format for\
    \ X.509 v3 is the Distinguished Encoding Rules\n   format as defined in [X.690].\n\
    \   Hash and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) encoding (3) is used as\n   defined\
    \ in Section 3.6 of [RFC7296].  Using hash and URL encodings\n   result in smaller\
    \ HIP control packets than by including the\n   certificate(s) but requires the\
    \ receiver to resolve the URL or check\n   a local cache against the hash.\n \
    \  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URL encoding (5) is used\n   as\
    \ defined in [RFC4516].  Using LDAP URL encoding results in smaller\n   HIP control\
    \ packets but requires the receiver to retrieve the\n   certificate or check a\
    \ local cache against the URL.\n   Distinguished Name (DN) encoding (7) is represented\
    \ by the string\n   representation of the certificate's subject DN as defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC4514].  Using the DN encoding results in smaller HIP control\n  \
    \ packets but requires the receiver to retrieve the certificate or\n   check a\
    \ local cache against the DN.\n"
- title: 3.  X.509 v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities
  contents:
  - "3.  X.509 v3 Certificate Object and Host Identities\n   If needed, HITs can represent\
    \ an issuer, a subject, or both in X.509\n   v3.  HITs are represented as IPv6\
    \ addresses as defined in [RFC7343].\n   When the Host Identifier (HI) is used\
    \ to sign the certificate, the\n   respective HIT SHOULD be placed into the Issuer\
    \ Alternative Name\n   (IAN) extension using the GeneralName form iPAddress as\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC5280].  When the certificate is issued for a HIP host, identified\n\
    \   by a HIT and an HI, the respective HIT SHOULD be placed into the\n   Subject\
    \ Alternative Name (SAN) extension using the GeneralName form\n   iPAddress, and\
    \ the full HI is presented as the subject's public key\n   info as defined in\
    \ [RFC5280].\n   The following examples illustrate how HITs are presented as the\n\
    \   issuer and subject in the X.509 v3 extension alternative names.\n       Format\
    \ of X509v3 extensions:\n           X509v3 Issuer Alternative Name:\n        \

    \   Appendix A shows a full example X.509 v3 certificate with HIP\n   content.\n\
    \   As another example, consider a managed Public Key Infrastructure\n   (PKI)\
    \ environment in which the peers have certificates that are\n   anchored in (potentially\
    \ different) managed trust chains.  In this\n   scenario, the certificates issued\
    \ to HIP hosts are signed by\n   intermediate Certification Authorities (CAs)\
    \ up to a root CA.  In\n   this example, the managed PKI environment is neither\
    \ HIP aware nor\n   can it be configured to compute HITs and include them in the\n\
    \   certificates.\n   When HIP communications are established, the HIP hosts not\
    \ only need\n   to send their identity certificates (or pointers to their\n  \
    \ certificates) but also the chain of intermediate CAs (or pointers to\n   the\
    \ CAs) up to the root CA, or to a CA that is trusted by the remote\n   peer. \
    \ This chain of certificates SHOULD be sent in a CERT group as\n   specified in\
    \ Section 2.  The HIP peers validate each other's\n   certificates and compute\
    \ peer HITs based on the certificate public\n   keys.\n"
- title: 4.  Revocation of Certificates
  contents:
  - "4.  Revocation of Certificates\n   Revocation of X.509 v3 certificates is handled\
    \ as defined in\n   Section 5 of [RFC5280] with two exceptions.  First, any HIP\n\
    \   certificate serial number that appears on the Certificate Revocation\n   List\
    \ (CRL) is treated as invalid regardless of the reason code.\n   Second, the certificateHold\
    \ is not supported.\n"
- title: 5.  Error Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.  Error Signaling\n   If the Initiator does not send all the certificates that\
    \ the\n   Responder requires, the Responder may take actions (e.g., reject the\n\

    \ a HIP NOTIFY message with NOTIFICATION parameter error type\n   CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED.\n\
    \   If the verification of a certificate fails, a verifier MAY signal\n   this\

- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines the CERT parameter for HIP\
    \ [RFC7401].  The CERT\n   parameter type number (768) is defined in [RFC7401].\n\
    \   The CERT parameter has an 8-bit unsigned integer field for different\n   certificate\
    \ types, for which IANA has created and maintains a\n   subregistry entitled \"\
    HIP Certificate Types\" under \"Host Identity\n   Protocol (HIP) Parameters\"\
    .  Values for the \"HIP Certificate Types\"\n   registry are given in Section\
    \ 2.  New values for the Certificate\n   types from the unassigned space are assigned\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Certificate grouping allows the certificates\
    \ to be sent in multiple\n   consecutive packets.  This might allow similar attacks,\
    \ as IP-layer\n   fragmentation allows, for example, the sending of fragments\
    \ in the\n   wrong order and skipping some fragments to delay or stall packet\n\
    \   processing by the victim in order to use resources (e.g., CPU or\n   memory).\
    \  Hence, hosts SHOULD implement mechanisms to discard\n   certificate groups\
    \ with outstanding certificates if state space is\n   scarce.\n   Although the\
    \ CERT parameter is allowed in the I1 packet, it is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED because\
    \ it can increase the processing times of I1s,\n   which can be problematic when\
    \ processing storms of I1s.  Furthermore,\n   the Initiator has to take into consideration\
    \ that the Responder can\n   drop the CERT parameter in I1 without processing\
    \ the parameter.\n   Checking of the URL and LDAP entries might allow denial-of-service\n\
    \   (DoS) attacks, where the target host may be subjected to bogus work.\n   Security\
