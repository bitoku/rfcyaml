    \  Introduction\n   This document describes a syntax for private-key information.\n\
    \   Private-key information includes a private key for some public-key\n   algorithm\
    \ and a set of attributes.  The document also describes a\n   syntax for encrypted\
    \ private keys.  A password-based encryption\n   algorithm (e.g., one of those\
    \ described in [PKCS#5]) could be used to\n   encrypt the private-key information.\n\
    \   The intention of including a set of attributes is to provide a simple\n  \
    \ way for a user to establish trust in information such as a\n   distinguished\
    \ name or a top-level certification authority's public\n   key.  While such trust\
    \ could also be established with a digital\n   signature, encryption with a secret\
    \ key known only to the user is\n   just as effective and possibly easier to implement.\
    \  A non-exhaustive\n   list of attributes is given in [PKCS#9].\n2.  Definitions\n\
    \   For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.\n    \
    \  AlgorithmIdentifier: A type that identifies an algorithm (by\n      object\
    \ identifier) and any associated parameters.  This type is\n      defined in [X.509].\n\
    \      ASN.1: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined in [X.208].\n      Attribute:\
    \ A type that contains an attribute type (specified by\n      object identifier)\
    \ and one or more attribute values.  This type is\n      defined in [X.501].\n\
    \      BER: Basic Encoding Rules, as defined in [X.209].\n3.  Symbols and Abbreviations\n\
    \   No symbols or abbreviations are defined in this document.\n4.  General Overview\n\
    \   The next two sections specify private-key information syntax and\n   encrypted\
    \ private-key information syntax.\n   This document exports two types: PrivateKeyInfo\
    \ (Section 6) and\n   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (Section 7).\n5.  Private-Key Information\
    \ Syntax\n   This section gives the syntax for private-key information.\n   Private-key\
    \ information shall have ASN.1 type PrivateKeyInfo:\n      PrivateKeyInfo ::=\
    \ SEQUENCE {\n        version                   Version,\n        privateKeyAlgorithm\
    \       PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,\n        privateKey                PrivateKey,\n\
    \        attributes           [0]  IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL }\n      Version\
    \ ::= INTEGER\n      PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier\n \
    \     PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING\n      Attributes ::= SET OF Attribute\n   The\
    \ fields of type PrivateKeyInfo have the following meanings:\n      version is\
    \ the syntax version number, for compatibility with\n      future revisions of\
    \ this document.  It shall be 0 for this version\n      of the document.\n   \
    \   privateKeyAlgorithm identifies the private-key algorithm.  One\n      example\
    \ of a private-key algorithm is PKCS #1's rsaEncryption\n      [PKCS#1].\n   \
    \   privateKey is an octet string whose contents are the value of the\n      private\
    \ key.  The interpretation of the contents is defined in the\n      registration\
    \ of the private-key algorithm.  For an RSA private\n      key, for example, the\
    \ contents are a BER encoding of a value of\n      type RSAPrivateKey.\n     \
    \ attributes is a set of attributes.  These are the extended\n      information\
    \ that is encrypted along with the private-key\n      information.\n6.  Encrypted\
    \ Private-Key Information Syntax\n   This section gives the syntax for encrypted\
    \ private-key information.\n   Encrypted private-key information shall have ASN.1\
    \ type\n   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo:\n      EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE\
    \ {\n        encryptionAlgorithm  EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,\n        encryptedData\
    \        EncryptedData }\n      EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier\n\
    \      EncryptedData ::= OCTET STRING\n   The fields of type EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo\
    \ have the following\n   meanings:\n      encryptionAlgorithm identifies the algorithm\
    \ under which the\n      private-key information is encrypted.  Two examples are\
    \ PKCS #5's\n      pbeWithMD2AndDES-CBC and pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC [PKCS#5].\n \
    \     encryptedData is the result of encrypting the private-key\n      information.\n\
    \   The encryption process involves the following two steps:\n      1. The private-key\
    \ information is BER encoded, yielding an octet\n         string.\n      2. The\
    \ result of step 1 is encrypted with the secret key to give\n         an octet\
    \ string, the result of the encryption process.\n7.  Security Considerations\n\
    \   Protection of the private-key information is vital to public-key\n   cryptography.\
    \  Disclosure of the private-key material to another\n   entity can lead to masquerades.\
    \  The encryption algorithm used in the\n   encryption process must be as 'strong'\
    \ as the key it is protecting.\nAppendix A.  ASN.1 Syntax\nPKCS-8 {iso(1) member-body(2)\
