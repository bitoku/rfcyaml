  - "1.  Introduction\n   DS-Lite [RFC6333] directs IANA to reserve 192.0.0.0/29 for\
    \ the Basic\n   Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  This memo generalizes that IANA\n\
    \   reservation to include other cases where a non-routed IPv4 interface\n   must\
    \ be numbered in an IPv6 transition solution.  IANA has listed the\n   address\
    \ block 192.0.0.0/29 reserved for IPv4 Service Continuity\n   Prefix.  The result\
    \ is that 192.0.0.0/29 may be used in any system\n   that requires IPv4 addresses\
    \ for backward compatibility with IPv4\n   communications in an IPv6-only network\
    \ but does not emit IPv4 packets\n   \"on the wire\".\n   This generalization\
    \ does not impact the use of the IPv4 Service\n   Continuity Prefix in a DS-Lite\
    \ context.\n"

- title: 3.  The Case of 464XLAT
  contents:
  - "3.  The Case of 464XLAT\n   464XLAT [RFC6877] describes an architecture for providing\
    \ IPv4\n   communication over an IPv6-only access network.  One of the methods\n\
    \   described in [RFC6877] is for the customer-side translator (CLAT) to\n   be\
    \ embedded in the host, such as a smartphone or a CPE (Customer\n   Premises Equipment).\
    \  In such scenarios, the host must have an IPv4\n   address configured to present\
    \ to the host network stack and for\n   applications to bind IPv4 sockets.\n"
- title: 4.  Choosing 192.0.0.0/29
  contents:
  - "4.  Choosing 192.0.0.0/29\n   To avoid conflicts with any other network that\
    \ may communicate with\n   the CLAT or other IPv6 transition solution, a locally\
    \ unique IPv4\n   address must be assigned.\n   IANA has defined a well-known\
    \ range, 192.0.0.0/29, in [RFC6333],\n   which is dedicated for DS-Lite.  As defined\
    \ in [RFC6333], this subnet\n   is only present between the B4 and the Address\
    \ Family Transition\n   Router (AFTR) and never emits packets from this prefix\
    \ \"on the wire\".\n   464XLAT has the same need for a non-routed IPv4 prefix,\
    \ and this same\n   need may be common for other similar solutions.  It is most\
    \ prudent\n   and effective to generalize 192.0.0.0/29 for the use of supporting\n\
    \   IPv4 interfaces in IPv6 transition technologies rather than reserving\n  \
    \ a prefix for every possible solution.\n   With this memo, 192.0.0.0/29 is now\
    \ generalized across multiple IPv4\n   continuity solutions such as 464XLAT and\
    \ DS-Lite.  A host MUST NOT\n   enable two active IPv4 continuity solutions simultaneously\
    \ in a way\n   that would cause a node to have overlapping 192.0.0.0/29 address\n\
    \   space.\n"
