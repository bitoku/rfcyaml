- title: 2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2271 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n  \
    \      second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC\n     \
    \   1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].\n   o    Message protocols for transferring management\
    \ information. The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the\
    \ SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n \
    \       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n      \
    \  RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and\n        RFC 2274 [12].\n\
    \   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n     \
    \   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n        operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n   o    A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and\n        the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2275\n        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \ A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted\
    \ into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,\
    \ this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the\
    \ semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This document identifies the set of objects for reporting the\
    \ status\n   of devices with APPN and DLUR capabilities via notifications.\n \
    \  See the SNANAU APPN MIB [18] and SNANAU DLUR MIB [19] for the objects\n   for\
    \ monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of the\n   devices with\
    \ APPN and DLUR capabilities. Many objects contained in\n   the notifications\
    \ of this MIB are imported from the APPN and DLUR\n   MIBs.  Implementors of this\
    \ MIB must also implement the APPN MIB.\n   Implementations that support the appnTrapMibDlurConfGroup\
    \ and the\n   appnTrapMibDlurNotifGroup must also implement the DLUR MIB.\n  \
    \ The SNANAU APPN MIB allows a management station to collect the\n   network topology\
    \ of an APPN network (the network nodes (NNs) in the\n   network and all of transmission\
    \ groups (TGs) between the network\n   nodes) from an APPN device.  It also allows\
    \ the management station to\n   collect the local topology (TGs to end stations,\
    \ and locally defined\n   ports and link stations) from an APPN device.  While\
    \ the SNANAU APPN\n   MIB has an efficient way to poll the APPN device for updates\
    \ to the\n   network topology, using flow reduction sequence numbers (FRSNs) as\
    \ a\n   table index; it does not have a mechanism to poll the local topology\n\
    \   tables (appnLocalTgTable, appnPortTable, and appnLsTable) for status\n   changes.\n\
    \   This MIB provides a mechanism for an APPN device to send\n   notifications\
    \ to inform the management station of status changes to\n   rows of these tables.\
    \ Status changes include operational state\n   changes, and for TGs also include\
    \ control-point to control-point\n   (CP-CP) session state changes.  A notification\
    \ is defined for each\n   type of status change for each table.\n   The port and\
    \ link operational state objects have intermediate states.\n   Notifications are\
    \ only sent for transition to active or inactive\n   state.\n   Notifications\
    \ are only sent for row creation if the state is active\n   or operational.  This\
    \ is done to avoid sending a notification as the\n   row is created with an inactive\
    \ initial state, followed by another\n   notification as the resource is activated.\n\
    \   Notifications are only sent for row deletion if the last state was\n   active\
    \ or operational.  In most cases, a resource must be deactivated\n   before it\
    \ can be deleted, and the deactivation will cause a\n   notification to be sent.\
    \  There is no need for a second notification\n   to be sent for the row deletion,\
    \ except for the case where the\n   deletion occurred without deactivation.  In\
    \ this case, the state of\n   the object in the notification will indicate an\
    \ inactve state, since\n   a deleted resource can no longer be active.\n   The\
    \ purpose of the appnLocalTgCpCpStateChangeTrap notification is to\n   identify\
    \ the loss or recovery of CP-CP sessions on a TG while the TG\n   remains operational.\
    \  Thus this notification is only sent if there is\n   a change to an appnLocalTgCpCpSession\
    \ object, but not a change to the\n   appnLocalTgOperational object.  This notification\
    \ is never sent for\n   the creation or deletion of a row in the appnLocalTgTable.\n\
    \   Each notification always contains an object which is a count of the\n   number\
    \ of times the status of a row in table has changed since the\n   APPN node was\
    \ last reinitialized.  This enables a management station\n   to detect that it\
    \ has missed a notification, if it does not get the\n   notifications in numerical\
    \ sequence.  If the notifications are not in\n   sequence, the management station\
    \ should retrieve the entire table to\n   get the correct status for all rows.\n\
    \   Similarly, the SNANAU DLUR MIB provides a mechanism for retrieving\n   the\
    \ configuration and status of dependent LU server (DLUS) sessions\n   on a device\
    \ with DLUR capabilities.  This MIB defines a notification\n   for a DLUR-DLUS\
    \ session state change of a row in the dlurDlusTable,\n   in the manner described\
    \ above.  A notification is only sent for a\n   session state transition to active\
    \ or inactive.  As with the above\n   notifications, it is only sent on row creation\
    \ if the initial state\n   is active; and on row deletion is the last state was\
    \ active, in which\n   case the notification indicates that the state is now inactive.\n\
    \   The SNANAU APPN MIB also provides a mechanism for a management\n   station\
    \ to collect traffic statistics on intermediate sessions,\n   primarily for accounting\
    \ purposes.  However, when the session is\n   terminated, all statistics from\
    \ the last poll until the session\n   termination time are lost, since the row\
    \ for that session is deleted\n   from the appnIsInTable.  This MIB defines a\
    \ notification so that the\n   session's final statistics can be sent to a management\
    \ station.  If\n   the notification is not delivered, the final session statistics\
    \ are\n   lost.  If this is a concern, polling of the appnIsInTable in the APPN\n\
    \   MIB should be increased to more likely reduce the time between the\n   last\
    \ poll and the session termination, thereby reducing the amount of\n   data lost.\n\
    \   Highlights of the management functions supported by the APPN TRAP MIB\n  \
    \ module include the following:\n   o    A notification for an APPN local TG operational\
    \ state change.\n   o    A notification for an APPN local TG CP-CP session state\
    \ change.\n   o    A notification for an APPN port operational state change.\n\
    \   o    A notification for an APPN link station operational state\n        change.\n\
    \   o    A notification for a DLUR-DLUS session state change.\n   o    A notification\
    \ for reporting final APPN intermediate session\n        statistics.\n   This\
    \ MIB module does not support:\n   o    Objects to query the configuration or\
    \ status of APPN nodes on\n        demand.\n   o    Notifications for changes\
    \ to local topology tables not related\n        to status.\n"
- title: 3.1.  APPN TRAP MIB Structure
  contents:
  - "3.1.  APPN TRAP MIB Structure\n   The APPN TRAP MIB module contains a group of\
    \ notifications, and a\n   group of supporting objects.\n   The group of notifications\
    \ consists of the following notifications:\n   1) appnIsrAccountingDataTrap\n\
    \   This notification is generated by an APPN device when an intermediate\n  \
    \ session is terminating, to report the final accounting statistics of\n   the\
    \ session.\n   2) appnLocalTgOperStateChangeTrap\n   This notification identifies\
    \ a change to the appnLocalTgOperational\n   object in a row of the SNANAU APPN\
    \ MIB appnLocalTgTable.\n   3) appnLocalTgCpCpStateChangeTrap\n   This notification\
    \ identifies a change to the appnLocalTgCpCpSession\n   object in a row of the\
    \ SNANAU APPN MIB appnLocalTgTable.\n   4) appnPortOperStateChangeTrap\n   This\
    \ notification identifies a change to the appnPortOperState object\n   in a row\
    \ of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnPortTable.\n   5) appnLsOperStateChangeTrap\n   This\
    \ notification identifies a change to the appnLsOperState object\n   in a row\
    \ of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnLsTable.\n   6) dlurDlusStateChangeTrap\n   This\
    \ notification identifies a change to the dlurDlusSessnStatus\n   object in a\
    \ row of the SNANAU DLUR MIB dlurDlusTable.\n   The group of supporting objects\
    \ contains the appnTrapControl object,\n   which controls whether the APPN device\
    \ generates each type of\n   notification.  Note that generation of the appnIsrAccountingDataTrap\n\
    \   is not controlled by this object; instead it is controlled by the\n   appnIsInGlobalCtrAdminStatus\
    \ object in the SNANAU APPN MIB.\n   Although APPN notification generation could\
    \ be controlled solely by\n   entries in the snmpNotificationMIB, RFC 2273 [9],\
    \ the appnTrapControl\n   object exists in this MIB so that implementations are\
    \ not required to\n   implement RFC 2273 to control generation of APPN notifications.\
    \  For\n   a notification to be generated and sent as a TRAP or INFORM, the\n\
    \   notification type must first be enabled by the appnTrapControl\n   object.\
    \  It must also not be disabled by an snmpNotificationMIB\n   entry.  The destination\
    \ of notifications is not within the scope of\n   this MIB.\n   Also contained\
    \ in this group are objects for the TG, port, link, and\n   DLUR-DLUS session\
    \ notifications to indicate the number of times each\n   of the tables has had\
    \ a status change of a row since the APPN node\n   was last reinitialized.\n"
