  - "1.  Introduction\n   The problems of location privacy, and privacy when using\
    \ IP for\n   communication, have become important.  IP privacy is broadly\n  \
    \ concerned with protecting user communication from unwittingly\n   revealing\
    \ information that could be used to analyze and gather\n   sensitive user data.\
    \  Examples include gathering data at certain\n   vantage points, collecting information\
    \ related to specific traffic,\n   and monitoring (perhaps) certain populations\
    \ of users for activity\n   during specific times of the day, etc.  In this document,\
    \ we refer to\n   this as the \"profiling\" problem.\n   Location privacy is concerned\
    \ with the problem of revealing roaming,\n   which we define here as the process\
    \ of a Mobile Node (MN) moving from\n   one network to another with or without\
    \ ongoing sessions.  A constant\n   identifier with global scope can reveal roaming.\
    \  Examples are a\n   device identifier such as an IP address, and a user identifier\
    \ such\n   as a SIP [RFC3261] URI [RFC3986].  Often, a binding between these two\n\
    \   identifiers is available, e.g., through DNS [RFC1035].  Traffic\n   analysis\
    \ of such IP and Upper Layer Protocol identifiers on a single\n   network can\
    \ indicate device and user roaming.  Roaming could also be\n   inferred by means\
    \ of profiling constant fields in IP communication\n   across multiple network\
    \ movements.  For example, an Interface\n   Identifier (IID) [RFC2462] in the\
    \ IPv6 address that remains unchanged\n   across networks could suggest roaming.\
    \  The Security Parameter Index\n   (SPI) in the IPsec [RFC4301] header is another\
    \ field that may be\n   subject to such profiling and inference.  Inferring roaming\
    \ in this\n   way typically requires traffic analysis across multiple networks,\
    \ or\n   colluding attackers, or both.  When location privacy is compromised,\n\
    \   it could lead to more targeted profiling of user communication.\n   As can\
    \ be seen, the location privacy problem spans multiple protocol\n   layers.  Nevertheless,\
    \ we can examine problems encountered by nodes\n   using a particular protocol\
    \ layer.  Roaming is particularly important\n   to Mobile IP, which defines a\
    \ global identifier (Home Address) that\n   can reveal device roaming, and in\
    \ conjunction with a corresponding\n   user identifier (such as a SIP URI), can\
    \ also reveal user roaming.\n   Furthermore, a user may not wish to reveal roaming\
    \ to\n   correspondent(s), which translates to the use of a Care-of Address.\n\
    \   As with a Home Address, the Care-of Address can also reveal the\n   topological\
    \ location of the Mobile Node.\n   This document scopes the problem of location\
    \ privacy for the Mobile\n   IP protocol.  The primary goal is to prevent attackers\
    \ on the path\n   between the Mobile Node (MN) and the Correspondent Node (CN)\
    \ from\n   detecting roaming due to the disclosure of the Home Address.  The\n\
    \   attackers are assumed to be able to observe, modify, and inject\n   traffic\
    \ at one point between the MN and the CN.  The attackers are\n   assumed not to\
    \ be able to observe at multiple points and correlate\n   observations to detect\
    \ roaming.  For this reason, MAC addresses,\n   IIDs, and other fields that can\
    \ be profiled to detect roaming are\n   only in scope to the extent that they\
    \ can be used by an attacker at\n   one point.  Upper layer protocol identifiers\
    \ that expose roaming are\n   out of scope except that a solution to the problem\
    \ described here\n   needs to be usable as a building block in solutions to those\n\
    \   problems.\n   This document also considers the problem from the exposure of\
    \ a\n   Care-of Address to the CN.\n   This document is only concerned with IP\
    \ address location privacy in\n   the context of Mobile IPv6.  It does not address\
    \ the overall privacy\n   problem.  For instance, it does not address privacy\
    \ issues related to\n   MAC addresses or the relationship of IP and MAC addresses\
    \ [HADDAD],\n   or the Upper Layer Protocol addresses.  Solutions to the problem\n\
    \   specified here should provide protection against roaming disclosure\n   due\
    \ to using Mobile IPv6 addresses from a visited network.\n   This document assumes\
    \ that the reader is familiar with the basic\n   operation of Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775]\
    \ and the associated terminology\n   defined therein.  For convenience, we provide\
    \ some definitions below.\n"

  - "3.2.  Revealing the Home Address to Onlookers\n   When a Mobile IP MN roams from\
    \ its home network to a visited network\n   or from one visited network to another,\
    \ use of a Home Address in\n   communication reveals to an onlooker that the MN\
    \ has roamed.  When a\n   binding of a Home Address to a user identifier (such\

    \ that the\n   user has roamed.  This problem is independent of whether the MN\

    \   (i.e., uses route optimization), or the MN communicates via the Home\n   Agent\

- title: 3.3.  Problem Scope
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Problem Scope\n   With existing Mobile IPv6 solutions, there is some protection\
    \ against\n   location privacy.  If a Mobile Node uses reverse tunneling with\n\
    \   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encryption, then the Home\n   Address\
    \ is not revealed on the MN - HA path.  So, eavesdroppers on\n   the MN - HA path\
    \ cannot determine roaming.  They could, however,\n   still profile fields in\
    \ the ESP header; however, this problem is not\n   specific to Mobile IPv6 location\
    \ privacy.\n   When an MN uses reverse tunneling (regardless of ESP encryption),\
    \ the\n   correspondent does not have access to the Care-of Address.  Hence, it\n\
    \   cannot determine that the MN has roamed.\n   Hence, the location privacy problem\
    \ is particularly applicable when\n   Mobile IPv6 route optimization is used or\
    \ when reverse tunneling is\n   used without protecting the inner IP packet containing\
    \ the Home\n   Address.\n"
- title: 4.  Problem Illustration
  contents:
  - "4.  Problem Illustration\n   This section is intended to provide an illustration\
    \ of the problem\n   defined in the previous section.\n   Consider a Mobile Node\
    \ at its home network.  Whenever it is involved\n   in IP communication, its correspondents\
    \ can see an IP address valid\n   on the home network.  Elaborating further, the\
    \ users involved in\n   peer-to-peer communication are likely to see a user-friendly\n\
    \   identifier such as a SIP URI, and the communication endpoints in the\n   IP\
    \ stack will see IP addresses.  Users uninterested in or unaware of\n   IP communication\
    \ details will not see any difference when the MN\n   acquires a new IP address.\
    \  Of course, any user can \"tcpdump\" or\n   \"ethereal\" a session, capture\
    \ IP packets, and map the MN's IP address\n   to an approximate geo-location.\
    \  This mapping may reveal the home\n   location of a user, but a correspondent\
    \ cannot ascertain whether the\n   user has actually roamed or not.  Assessing\
    \ the physical location\n   based on IP addresses has some similarities to assessing\
    \ the\n   geographical location based on the area code of a telephone number.\n\
    \   The granularity of the physical area corresponding to an IP address\n   can\
    \ vary depending on how sophisticated the available tools are, how\n   often an\
    \ ISP conducts its network re-numbering, etc.  Also, an IP\n   address cannot\
    \ guarantee that a peer is at a certain geographic area\n   due to technologies\
    \ such as VPN and tunneling.\n   When the MN roams to another network, the location\
    \ privacy problem\n   consists of two parts: revealing information to its correspondents\n\
    \   and to onlookers.\n   With its correspondents, the MN can either communicate\
    \ directly or\n   reverse-tunnel its packets through the Home Agent.  Using reverse\n\
    \   tunneling does not reveal the Care-of Address of the MN, although\n   end-to-end\
    \ delay may vary depending on the particular scenario.  With\n   those correspondents\
    \ with which it can disclose its Care-of Address\n   \"on the wire\", the MN has\
    \ the option of using route-optimized\n   communication.  The transport protocol\
    \ still sees the Home Address\n   with route optimization.  Unless the correspondent\
    \ runs some packet\n   capturing utility, the user cannot see which mode (reverse\
    \ tunneling\n   or route optimization) is being used, but knows that it is\n \
    \  communicating with the same peer whose URI it knows.  This is similar\n   to\
    \ conversing with a roaming cellphone user whose phone number, like\n   the URI,\
    \ remains unchanged.\n   Regardless of whether the MN uses route optimization\
    \ or reverse\n   tunneling (without ESP encryption), its Home Address is revealed\
    \ in\n   data packets.  When equipped with an ability to inspect packets \"on\n\
    \   the wire\", an onlooker on the MN - HA path can determine that the MN\n  \
    \ has roamed and could possibly also determine that the user has\n   roamed. \
    \ This could compromise the location privacy even if the MN\n   took steps to\
    \ hide its roaming information from a correspondent.\n   The above description\
    \ is valid regardless of whether a Home Address\n   is statically allocated or\
    \ is dynamically allocated.  In either case,\n   the mapping of IP address to\
    \ a geo-location will most likely yield\n   results with the same level of granularity.\
    \  With the freely\n   available tools on the Internet, this granularity is the\
    \ physical\n   address of the ISP or the organization that registers ownership\
    \ of a\n   prefix chunk.  Since an ISP or an organization is not, rightly,\n \
    \  required to provide a blueprint of its subnets, the granularity\n   remains\
    \ fairly coarse for a mobile wireless network.  However,\n   sophisticated attackers\
    \ might be able to conduct site mapping and\n   obtain more fine-grained subnet\
    \ information.\n   A compromise in location privacy could lead to more targeted\n\
    \   profiling of user data.  An eavesdropper may specifically track the\n   traffic\
    \ containing the Home Address, and monitor the movement of the\n   Mobile Node\
    \ with a changing Care-of Address.  The profiling problem\n   is not specific\
    \ to Mobile IPv6, but could be triggered by a\n   compromise in location privacy\
    \ due to revealing the Home Address.  A\n   correspondent may take advantage of\
    \ the knowledge that a user has\n   roamed when the Care-of Address is revealed,\
    \ and modulate actions\n   based on such knowledge.  Such information could cause\
    \ concern to a\n   mobile user, especially when the correspondent turns out be\n\
    \   untrustworthy.  For these reasons, appropriate security measures on\n   the\
    \ management interfaces on the MN to guard against the disclosure\n   or misuse\
    \ of location information should be considered.\n   Applying existing techniques\
    \ to thwart profiling may have\n   implications to Mobile IPv6 signaling performance.\
    \  For instance,\n   changing the Care-of Address often would cause additional\
    \ Return\n   Routability [RFC3775] and binding management signaling.  And,\n \
    \  changing the Home Address often has implications on IPsec security\n   association\
    \ management.  Careful consideration should be given to the\n   signaling cost\
    \ introduced by changing either the Care-of Address or\n   the Home Address.\n\
    \   When roaming, an MN may treat its home network nodes as any other\n   correspondents.\
    \  Reverse tunneling is perhaps sufficient for home\n   network communication,\
    \ since route-optimized communication will\n   traverse the identical path.  Hence,\
    \ an MN can avoid revealing its\n   Care-of Address to its home network correspondents\
    \ simply by using\n   reverse tunneling.  The Proxy Neighbor Advertisements [RFC2461]\
    \ from\n   the Home Agent could serve as hints to the home network nodes that\n\
    \   the Mobile Node is away.  However, they will not be able to know the\n   Mobile\
    \ Node's current point of attachment unless the MN uses route\n   optimization\
    \ with them.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusion\n   In this document, we have discussed the location privacy problem\
    \ as\n   applicable to Mobile IPv6.  The problem can be summarized as follows:\n\
    \   disclosing the Care-of Address to a correspondent and revealing the\n   Home\
    \ Address to an onlooker can compromise the location privacy of a\n   Mobile Node,\
    \ and hence that of a user.  We have seen that\n   bidirectional tunneling allows\
    \ an MN to protect its Care-of Address\n   to the CN.  And, ESP encryption of\
    \ an inner IP packet allows the MN\n   to protect its Home Address from the onlookers\
    \ on the MN - HA path.\n   However, with route optimization, the MN will reveal\
    \ its Care-of\n   Address to the CN.  Moreover, route optimization causes the\
    \ Home\n   Address to be revealed to onlookers in the data packets as well as\
    \ in\n   Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The solutions to this problem are\n\
    \   expected to be protocol specifications that use the existing Mobile\n   IPv6\
    \ functional entities, namely, the Mobile Node, its Home Agent,\n   and the Correspondent\
    \ Node.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document discusses the location privacy\
    \ problem specific to\n   Mobile IPv6.  Any solution must be able to protect (e.g.,\
    \ using\n   encryption) the Home Address from disclosure to onlookers in data\n\
    \   packets when using route optimization or reverse tunneling.  In\n   addition,\
    \ solutions must consider protecting the Mobile IPv6\n   signaling messages from\
    \ disclosing the Home Address along the MN - HA\n   and MN - CN paths.\n   Disclosing\
    \ the Care-of Address is inevitable if an MN wishes to use\n   route optimization.\
    \  Regardless of whether the Care-of Address is an\n   on-link address of the\
    \ MN on the visited link or that of a\n   cooperating proxy, mere presence of\
    \ a Binding Cache Entry is\n   sufficient for a CN to ascertain roaming.  Hence,\
    \ an MN concerned\n   with location privacy should exercise prudence in determining\
    \ whether\n   to use route optimization with, especially previously unacquainted,\n\
    \   correspondents.\n   The solutions should also consider the use of temporary\
    \ addresses and\n   their implications on Mobile IPv6 signaling as discussed in\
    \ Section\n   4, \"Problem Illustration\".  Use of IP addresses with privacy\n\
    \   extensions [RFC3041] could be especially useful for Care-of Addresses\n  \
    \ if appropriate trade-offs with Return Routability signaling are taken\n   into\
    \ account.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Background
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Background\n   The location privacy topic is broad and often has\
    \ different\n   connotations.  It also spans multiple layers in the OSI reference\n\
    \   model.  Besides, there are attributes beyond an IP address alone that\n  \
    \ can reveal hints about location.  For instance, even if a\n   correspondent\
    \ is communicating with the same endpoint it is used to,\n   the \"time of day\"\
    \ attribute can reveal a hint to the user.  Some\n   roaming cellphone users may\
    \ have noticed that their SMS messages\n   carry a timestamp of their \"home network\"\
    \ time zone (for location\n   privacy or otherwise), which can reveal that the\
    \ user is in a\n   different time zone when messages are sent during a \"normal\"\
    \ time of\n   the day.  Furthermore, tools exist on the Internet that can map\
    \ an IP\n   address to the physical address of an ISP or the organization that\n\
    \   owns the prefix chunk.  Taking this to another step, with built-in\n   GPS\
    \ receivers on IP hosts, applications can be devised to map geo-\n   locations\
    \ to IP network information.  Even without GPS receivers,\n   geo-locations can\
    \ also be obtained in environments where \"Geopriv\" is\n   supported, for instance,\
    \ as a DHCP option [RFC3825].  In summary, a\n   user's physical location can\
    \ be determined or guessed with some\n   certainty and with varying levels of\
    \ granularity by different means,\n   even though IP addresses themselves do not\
    \ inherently provide any\n   geo-location information.  It is perhaps useful to\
    \ bear this broad\n   scope in mind as the problem of IP address location privacy\
    \ in the\n   presence of IP Mobility is addressed.\n"
