    \                         Table 3: Key Type Values\n   This document defines a\
    \ key structure for both the public and private\n   parts of RSA keys.  Together,\
    \ an RSA public key and an RSA private\n   key form an RSA key pair.\n   The document\
    \ also provides support for the so-called \"multi-prime\"\n   RSA keys, in which\
    \ the modulus may have more than two prime factors.\n   The benefit of multi-prime\
    \ RSA is lower computational cost for the\n   decryption and signature primitives.\
    \  For a discussion on how multi-\n   prime affects the security of RSA cryptosystems,\
    \ the reader is\n   referred to [MultiPrimeRSA].\n   This document follows the\
    \ naming convention of [RFC8017] for the\n   naming of the fields of an RSA public\
    \ or private key, and the\n   corresponding fields have identical semantics. \
    \ The requirements for\n   fields for RSA keys are as follows:\n   o  For all\
    \ keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.\n   o  For public keys,\
    \ the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present.  All\n      other fields defined in\
    \ the following table below MUST be absent.\n   o  For private keys with two primes,\
    \ the fields 'other', 'r_i',\n      'd_i', and 't_i' MUST be absent; all other\
    \ fields MUST be present.\n   o  For private keys with more than two primes, all\
    \ fields MUST be\n      present.  For the third to nth primes, each of the primes\
    \ is\n      represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i', and\n   \
    \   't_i'.  The field 'other' is an array of those maps.\n   o  All numeric key\
    \ parameters are encoded in an unsigned big-endian\n      representation as an\
    \ octet sequence using the CBOR byte string\n      type (major type 2).  The octet\
    \ sequence MUST utilize the minimum\n      number of octets needed to represent\
    \ the value.  For instance, the\n      value 32,768 is represented as the CBOR\
    \ byte sequence 0b010_00010,\n      0x80 0x00 (major type 2, additional information\
    \ 2 for the length).\n   The following table provides a summary of the label values\

  - "6.1.  Key Size Security Considerations\n   A key size of 2048 bits or larger\
    \ MUST be used with these algorithms.\n   This key size corresponds roughly to\
    \ the same strength as provided by\n   a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.\
    \  Implementations SHOULD be\n   able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between\
    \ 2048 and 16K bits in\n   length.  Applications can impose additional restrictions\
    \ on the\n   length of the modulus.\n   In addition to needing to worry about\
    \ keys that are too small to\n   provide the required security, there are issues\
    \ with keys that are\n   too large.  Denial-of-service attacks have been mounted\
    \ with overly\n   large keys or oddly sized keys.  This has the potential to consume\n\
    \   resources with these keys.  It is highly recommended that checks on\n   the\
    \ key length be done before starting a cryptographic operation.\n   There are\
    \ two reasonable ways to address this attack.  First, a key\n   should not be\
    \ used for a cryptographic operation until it has been\n   verified that it is\
    \ controlled by a party trusted by the recipient.\n   This approach means that\
    \ no cryptography will be done until a trust\n   decision about the key has been\
    \ made, a process described in\n   Appendix D, Item 4 of [RFC7515].  Second, applications\
    \ can impose\n   maximum- as well as minimum-length requirements on keys.  This\
    \ limits\n   the resources that would otherwise be consumed by the use of overly\n\
    \   large keys.\n"

    \ effective\n   mitigation against it.  Unlike an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature\n\
