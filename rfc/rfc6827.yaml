  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945]\n\
    \   protocol suite is designed to provide a control plane for a range of\n   network\
    \ technologies.  These include optical networks such as time\n   division multiplexing\
    \ (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH, Optical\n   Transport Networks (OTNs), and\
    \ lambda switching optical networks.\n   The ITU-T defines the architecture of\
    \ the Automatically Switched\n   Optical Network (ASON) in [G.8080].\n   [RFC4258]\
    \ describes the routing requirements for the GMPLS suite of\n   routing protocols\
    \ to support the capabilities and functionality of\n   ASON control planes identified\
    \ in [G.7715] and in [G.7715.1].\n   [RFC4652] evaluates the IETF Link State routing\
    \ protocols against the\n   requirements identified in [RFC4258].  Section 7.1\
    \ of [RFC4652]\n   summarizes the capabilities to be provided by OSPFv2 [RFC2328]\
    \ in\n   support of ASON routing.  This document describes the OSPFv2\n   specifics\
    \ for ASON routing.\n   Multi-layer transport networks are constructed from multiple\
    \ networks\n   of different technologies operating in a client-server relationship.\n\
    \   The ASON routing model includes the definition of routing levels that\n  \
    \ provide scaling and confidentiality benefits.  In multi-level\n   routing, domains\
    \ called routing areas (RAs) are arranged in a\n   hierarchical relationship.\
    \  Note that as described in [RFC4652],\n   there is no implied relationship between\
    \ multi-layer transport\n   networks and multi-level routing.  The multi-level\
    \ routing mechanisms\n   described in this document work for both single-layer\
    \ and multi-layer\n   networks.\n   Implementations may support a hierarchical\
    \ routing topology (multi-\n   level) for multiple transport network layers and/or\
    \ a hierarchical\n   routing topology for a single transport network layer.\n\
    \   This document describes the processing of the generic (technology-\n   independent)\
    \ link attributes that are defined in [RFC3630],\n   [RFC4202], and [RFC4203]\
    \ and that are extended in this document.  As\n   described in Section 5.2, technology-specific\
    \ traffic engineering\n   attributes and their processing may be defined in other\
    \ documents\n   that complement this document.\n   Note that this work is scoped\
    \ to the requirements and evaluation\n   expressed in [RFC4258] and [RFC4652]\
    \ and the ITU-T Recommendations\n   that were current when those documents were\
    \ written.  Future\n   extensions or revisions of this work may be necessary if\
    \ the ITU-T\n   Recommendations are revised or if new requirements are introduced\n\
    \   into a revision of [RFC4258].\n"

- title: 2.  Routing Areas, OSPF Areas, and Protocol Instances
  contents:
  - "2.  Routing Areas, OSPF Areas, and Protocol Instances\n   An ASON routing area\
    \ (RA) represents a partition of the transport\n   plane, and its identifier is\
    \ used within the control plane as the\n   representation of this partition.\n\
    \   RAs are hierarchically contained: a higher-level (parent) RA contains\n  \
    \ lower-level (child) RAs that in turn MAY also contain RAs.  Thus, RAs\n   contain\
    \ RAs that recursively define successive hierarchical RA\n   levels.  Routing\
    \ information may be exchanged between levels of the\n   RA hierarchy, i.e., Level\
    \ N+1 and N, where Level N represents the RAs\n   contained by Level N+1.  The\
    \ links connecting RAs may be viewed as\n   external links (inter-RA links), and\
    \ the links representing\n   connectivity within an RA may be viewed as internal\
    \ links (intra-RA\n   links).  The external links to an RA at one level of the\
    \ hierarchy\n   may be internal links in the parent RA.  Intra-RA links of a child\
    \ RA\n   MAY be hidden from the parent RA's view [RFC4258].\n   An ASON RA can\
    \ be mapped to an OSPF area, but the hierarchy of ASON\n   RA levels does not\
    \ map to the hierarchy of OSPF areas.  Instead,\n   successive hierarchical levels\
    \ of RAs MUST be represented by separate\n   instances of the protocol.  Thus,\
    \ inter-level routing information\n   exchange (as described in Section 7) involves\
    \ the export and import\n   of routing information between protocol instances.\n\
    \   An ASON RA may therefore be identified by the combination of its OSPF\n  \
    \ Instance ID and its OSPF Area ID.  With proper and careful network-\n   wide\
    \ configuration, this can be achieved using just the OSPF Area ID,\n   and this\
    \ process is RECOMMENDED in this document.  These concepts are\n   discussed in\
    \ Section 7.\n   A key ASON requirement is the support of multiple transport planes\
    \ or\n   layers.  Each transport node has associated topology (links and\n   reachability),\
    \ which is used for ASON routing.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology and Identification
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology and Identification\n   This section describes the mapping of\
    \ key ASON entities to OSPF\n   entities.  Appendix A contains a complete glossary\
    \ of ASON routing\n   terminology.\n   There are three categories of identifiers\
    \ used for ASON routing\n   (G.7715.1): transport-plane names, control-plane identifiers\
    \ for\n   components, and Signaling Communications Network (SCN) addresses.\n\
    \   This section discusses the mapping between ASON routing identifiers\n   and\
    \ corresponding identifiers defined for GMPLS routing and how these\n   support\
    \ the physical (or logical) separation of transport-plane\n   entities and control-plane\
    \ components.  GMPLS supports this\n   separation of identifiers and planes.\n\
    \   In the context of OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE), an ASON transport\n   node\
    \ corresponds to a unique OSPF TE node.  An OSPF TE node is\n   uniquely identified\
    \ by the TE Router Address TLV [RFC3630].  In this\n   document, the TE Router\
    \ Address is referred to as the TE Router ID.\n   In GMPLS, TE router addresses\
    \ are advertised as reachable in both the\n   control and transport planes, see\
    \ Section 4 below.  Furthermore, the\n   TE Router ID should not be confused with\
    \ the OSPF Router ID that\n   uniquely identifies an OSPF router within an OSPF\
    \ routing domain\n   [RFC2328] and is in a name space for control-plane components.\n\
    \   The Router Address top-level TLV definition, processing, and usage\n   are\
    \ largely unchanged from [RFC3630].  This TLV specifies a stable\n   OSPF TE node\
    \ IP address, i.e., the IP address is always reachable\n   when there is IP connectivity\
    \ to the associated OSPF TE node.\n   ASON defines a Routing Controller (RC) as\
    \ an entity that handles\n   (abstract) information needed for routing and the\
    \ routing information\n   exchange with peering RCs by operating on the Routing\
    \ Database (RDB).\n   ASON defines a Protocol Controller (PC) as an entity that\
    \ handles\n   protocol-specific message exchanges according to the reference point\n\
    \   over which the information is exchanged (e.g., E-NNI, I-NNI) and\n   internal\
    \ exchanges with the RC [RFC4258].  In this document, an OSPF\n   router advertising\
    \ ASON TE topology information will perform both the\n   functions of the RC and\
    \ PC.  The OSPF routing domain comprises the\n   control plane, and each OSPF\
    \ router is uniquely identified by its\n   OSPF Router ID [RFC2328].\n"
- title: 4.  Reachability
  contents:
  - "4.  Reachability\n   In ASON, reachability information describes the set of endpoints\
    \ that\n   are reachable by the associated node in the transport plane.\n   Reachability\
    \ information represents transport-plane resources, e.g.,\n   an optical cross-connect\
    \ interface, and uses transport-plane\n   identifiers.\n   In order to advertise\
    \ blocks of reachable address prefixes, a\n   summarization mechanism is introduced\
    \ that is based on the techniques\n   described in [RFC5786].  For ASON reachability\
    \ advertisement, blocks\n   of reachable address prefixes are advertised together\
    \ with the\n   associated transport-plane node.  The transport-plane node is\n\
    \   identified in OSPF TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs) by its TE\n   Router\
    \ ID, as discussed in Section 6.\n   In order to support ASON reachability advertisement,\
    \ the Node\n   Attribute TLV defined in [RFC5786] is used to advertise the\n \
    \  combination of a TE Router ID and its set of associated reachable\n   address\
    \ prefixes.  The Node Attribute TLV can contain the following\n   sub-TLVs:\n\
    \      - Local TE Router ID sub-TLV: Length: 4; Defined in Section 6.2\n     \
    \ - Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV: Length: variable; [RFC5786]\n      - Node\
    \ IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV: Length: variable; [RFC5786]\n   A router may support\
    \ multiple transport nodes as discussed in\n   Section 6 and, as a result, may\
    \ be required to advertise reachability\n   separately for each transport node.\
    \  As a consequence, it MUST be\n   possible for the router to originate more\
    \ than one TE LSA containing\n   the Node Attribute TLV when used for ASON reachability\
    \ advertisement.\n   Hence, the Node Attribute TLV [RFC5786] advertisement rules\
    \ are\n   relaxed.  A Node Attribute TLV MAY appear in more than one TE LSA\n\
    \   originated by the RC when the RC is advertising reachability\n   information\
    \ for a different transport node identified by the Local TE\n   Router sub-TLV\
    \ (refer to Section 6.2).\n   As specified in [RFC3630], TE-advertised router\
    \ addresses are also\n   advertised as reachable in the control plane and are\
    \ therefore also\n   valid identifiers in the ASON SCN name space.\n"
- title: 5.  Link Attribute
  contents:
  - "5.  Link Attribute\n   With the exception of local adaptation (described below),\
    \ the mapping\n   of link attributes and characteristics to OSPF TE Link TLV sub-TLVs\n\
    \   is unchanged [RFC4652].  OSPF TE Link TLV sub-TLVs are described in\n   [RFC3630]\
    \ and [RFC4203].  Advertisement of this information SHOULD be\n   supported on\
    \ a per-layer basis, i.e., one TE LSA per unique switching\n   capability and\
    \ bandwidth granularity combination.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Local Adaptation
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Local Adaptation\n   Local adaptation is defined as a TE link attribute\
    \ (i.e., sub-TLV)\n   that describes the cross/inter-layer relationships.\n  \
    \ The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) TE Attribute\n   [RFC4202]\
    \ identifies the ability of the TE link to support cross-\n   connection to another\
    \ link within the same layer.  When advertising\n   link adaptation, it also identifies\
    \ the ability to use a locally\n   terminated connection that belongs to one layer\
    \ as a data link for\n   another layer (adaptation capability).  However, the\
    \ information\n   associated with the ability to terminate connections within\
    \ that\n   layer (referred to as the termination capability) is advertised with\n\
    \   the adaptation capability.\n   For instance, a link between two optical cross-connects\
    \ will contain\n   at least one ISCD attribute describing the Lambda Switching\
    \ Capable\n   (LSC) switching capability.  Conversely, a link between an optical\n\
    \   cross-connect and an IP/MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR) will\n   contain\
    \ at least two ISCD attributes, one for the description of the\n   LSC termination\
    \ capability and one for the Packet Switching Capable\n   (PSC) adaptation capability.\n\
    \   In OSPFv2, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) is a\n   sub-TLV\
    \ (type 15) of the top-level Link TLV (type 2) [RFC4203].  The\n   adaptation\
    \ and termination capabilities are advertised using two\n   separate ISCD sub-TLVs\
    \ within the same top-level Link TLV.\n   An interface MAY have more than one\
    \ ISCD sub-TLV, per [RFC4202] and\n   [RFC4203].  Hence, the corresponding advertisements\
    \ should not result\n   in any compatibility issues.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Bandwidth Accounting
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Bandwidth Accounting\n   GMPLS routing defines an ISCD that provides, among\
    \ other things, the\n   quantities of the maximum/minimum available bandwidth\
    \ per priority\n   for Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  One or more ISCD sub-TLVs\
    \ can be\n   associated with an interface, per [RFC4202] and [RFC4203].  This\n\
    \   information, combined with the Unreserved Bandwidth Link TLV sub-TLV\n   [RFC3630],\
    \ provides the basis for bandwidth accounting.\n   In the ASON context, additional\
    \ information may be included when the\n   representation and information in the\
    \ other advertised fields are not\n   sufficient for a specific technology, e.g.,\
    \ SDH.  The definition of\n   technology-specific information elements is beyond\
    \ the scope of this\n   document.  Some technologies will not require additional\
    \ information\n   beyond what is already defined in [RFC3630], [RFC4202], and\n\
    \   [RFC4203].\n"
- title: 6.  Routing Information Scope
  contents:
  - "6.  Routing Information Scope\n   For ASON routing, the control-plane component\
    \ routing adjacency\n   topology (i.e., the associated Protocol Controller (PC)\
    \ connectivity)\n   and the transport topology are not assumed to be congruent\
    \ [RFC4258].\n   Hence, a single OSPF router (i.e., the PC) MUST be able to advertise\n\
    \   on behalf of multiple transport-layer nodes.  The OSPF routers are\n   identified\
    \ by OSPF Router ID, and the transport nodes are identified\n   by TE Router ID.\n\
    \   The Router Address TLV [RFC3630] is used to advertise the TE Router\n   ID\
    \ associated with the advertising Routing Controller (RC).  TE\n   Router IDs\
    \ for additional transport nodes are advertised through\n   specification of the\
    \ Local TE Router Identifier in the Local and\n   Remote TE Router TE sub-TLV\
    \ and the Local TE Router Identifier\n   sub-TLV described in the sections below.\
    \  These Local TE Router\n   Identifiers are typically used as the local endpoints\

- title: 6.1.  Link Advertisement (Local and Remote TE Router ID Sub-TLV)
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Link Advertisement (Local and Remote TE Router ID Sub-TLV)\n   When an\
    \ OSPF Router advertises on behalf of multiple transport nodes,\n   the link endpoints\
    \ cannot be automatically assigned to a single\n   transport node associated with\
    \ the advertising router.  In this case,\n   the local and remote transport nodes\
    \ MUST be identified by TE Router\n   ID to unambiguously specify the transport\
    \ topology.\n   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 TE LSA top-level\
    \ Link\n   TLV is introduced that defines the Local and Remote TE Router ID.\n\
    \   The Type field of the Local and Remote TE Router ID sub-TLV is\n   assigned\

    \ logged for possible action by\n   the network operator.\n   Note: The Link ID\
    \ sub-TLV identifies the other end of the link (i.e.,\n   Router ID of the neighbor\
    \ for point-to-point links) [RFC3630].  When\n   the Local and Remote TE Router\
    \ ID sub-TLV is present, it MUST be used\n   to identify local and remote transport\
    \ node endpoints for the link\n   and the Link-ID sub-TLV MUST be ignored.  In\
    \ fact, when the Local and\n   Remote TE Router ID sub-TLV is specified, the Link-ID\

  - "6.2.  Reachability Advertisement (Local TE Router ID Sub-TLV)\n   When an OSPF\
    \ router is advertising on behalf of multiple transport\n   nodes, the routing\
    \ protocol MUST be able to associate the advertised\n   reachability information\
    \ with the correct transport node.\n   For this purpose, a new sub-TLV of the\
    \ OSPFv2 TE LSA top-level Node\n   Attribute TLV is introduced.  This TLV associates\
    \ the local prefixes\n   (see above) to a given transport node identified by the\
    \ TE Router ID.\n   The Type field of the Local TE Router ID sub-TLV is assigned\
    \ the\n   value 5 (see Section 10).  The Length field takes the value 4.  The\n\

  - "7.  Routing Information Dissemination\n   An ASON routing area (RA) represents\
    \ a partition of the transport\n   plane, and its identifier is used within the\
    \ control plane as the\n   representation of this partition.  An RA may contain\
    \ smaller RAs\n   inter-connected by links.  ASON RA levels do not map directly\
    \ to OSPF\n   areas.  Rather, hierarchical levels of RAs are represented by\n\
    \   separate OSPF protocol instances.  However, it is useful to align the\n  \
    \ RA IDs and area ID in order to facilitate isolation of RAs as\n   described\
    \ in Section 11.1.\n   Routing Controllers (RCs) supporting multiple RAs disseminate\n\
    \   information downward and upward in this ASON hierarchy.  The vertical\n  \
    \ routing information dissemination mechanisms described in this\n   section do\
    \ not introduce or imply hierarchical OSPF areas.  RCs\n   supporting RAs at multiple\

    \ as TE LSAs.  TE\n   LSAs are area-scoped Opaque LSAs with Opaque type 1 [RFC3630].\
    \  The\n   information that MAY be exchanged between adjacent levels includes\n\
    \   the Router Address, Link, and Node Attribute top-level TLVs.\n   The imported/exported\
    \ routing information content MAY be transformed,\n   e.g., filtered or aggregated,\

    \ or\n   downward, a specific mechanism is required to avoid looping of\n   routing\
    \ information.  Looping is the re-advertisement of routing\n   information into\
    \ an RA that had previously advertised that routing\n   information upward or\
    \ downward into an upper or lower level RA in the\n   ASON hierarchy.  For example,\
    \ without loop-prevention mechanisms,\n   this could happen when the RC advertising\
    \ routing information\n   downward in the hierarchy is not the same one that advertises\
    \ routing\n   information upward in the hierarchy.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  ASON Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following terms:\n\
    \   Administrative domain: (See Recommendation [G.805].)  For the\n      purposes\
    \ of [G.7715.1], an administrative domain represents the\n      extent of resources\
    \ that belong to a single player such as a\n      network operator, a service\
    \ provider, or an end-user.\n      Administrative domains of different players\
    \ do not overlap amongst\n      themselves.\n   Control plane: performs the call\
    \ control and connection control\n      functions.  Through signaling, the control\
    \ plane sets up and\n      releases connections and may restore a connection in\
    \ case of a\n      failure.\n   (Control) Domain: represents a collection of (control)\
    \ entities that\n      are grouped for a particular purpose.  The control plane\
    \ is\n      subdivided into domains matching administrative domains.  Within\n\
    \      an administrative domain, further subdivisions of the control\n      plane\
    \ are recursively applied.  A routing control domain is an\n      abstract entity\
    \ that hides the details of the RC distribution.\n   External NNI (E-NNI): interfaces\
    \ located between protocol controllers\n      between control domains.\n   Internal\
    \ NNI (I-NNI): interfaces located between protocol controllers\n      within control\
    \ domains.\n   Link: (See Recommendation G.805.)  A \"topological component\"\
    \ that\n      describes a fixed relationship between a \"subnetwork\" or \"access\n\
    \      group\" and another \"subnetwork\" or \"access group\".  Links are not\n\
    \      limited to being provided by a single server trail.\n   Management plane:\
    \ performs management functions for the transport\n      plane, the control plane,\
    \ and the system as a whole.  It also\n      provides coordination between all\
    \ the planes.  The following\n      management functional areas are performed\
    \ in the management plane:\n      performance, fault, configuration, accounting,\
    \ and security\n      management.\n   Management domain: (See Recommendation G.805.)\
    \  A management domain\n      defines a collection of managed objects that are\
    \ grouped to meet\n      organizational requirements according to geography, technology,\n\
    \      policy, or other structure, and for a number of functional areas\n    \
    \  such as Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and\n      Security\
    \ (FCAPS), for the purpose of providing control in a\n      consistent manner.\
    \  Management domains can be disjoint, contained,\n      or overlapping.  As such,\
    \ the resources within an administrative\n      domain can be distributed into\
    \ several possible overlapping\n      management domains.  The same resource can\
    \ therefore belong to\n      several management domains simultaneously, but a\
    \ management domain\n      shall not cross the border of an administrative domain.\n\
    \   Subnetwork Point (SNP): The SNP is a control-plane abstraction that\n    \
    \  represents an actual or potential transport-plane resource.  SNPs\n      (in\
    \ different subnetwork partitions) may represent the same\n      transport resource.\
    \  A one-to-one correspondence should not be\n      assumed.\n   Subnetwork Point\
    \ Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that are grouped together\n      for the purposes\
    \ of routing.\n   Termination Connection Point (TCP): A TCP represents the output\
    \ of a\n      Trail Termination function or the input to a Trail Termination\n\
    \      Sink function.\n   Transport plane: provides bidirectional or unidirectional\
    \ transfer of\n      user information, from one location to another.  It can also\n\
    \      provide transfer of some control and network management\n      information.\
    \  The transport plane is layered; it is equivalent to\n      the Transport Network\
    \ defined in Recommendation G.805.\n   User Network Interface (UNI): interfaces\
    \ are located between protocol\n      controllers between a user and a control\
    \ domain.  Note: There is\n      no routing function associated with a UNI reference\
    \ point.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  ASON Routing Terminology
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  ASON Routing Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following\
    \ terms:\n   Routing Area (RA): an RA represents a partition of the transport\n\
    \      plane, and its identifier is used within the control plane as the\n   \
    \   representation of this partition.  Per [G.8080], an RA is defined\n      by\
    \ a set of subnetworks, the links that interconnect them, and the\n      interfaces\
    \ representing the ends of the links exiting that RA.  An\n      RA may contain\
    \ smaller RAs inter-connected by links.  The limit of\n      subdivision results\
    \ in an RA that contains two subnetworks\n      interconnected by a single link.\n\
    \   Routing Database (RDB): a repository for the local topology, network\n   \
    \   topology, reachability, and other routing information that is\n      updated\
    \ as part of the routing information exchange and may\n      additionally contain\
    \ information that is configured.  The RDB may\n      contain routing information\
    \ for more than one routing area (RA).\n   Routing Components: ASON routing architecture\
    \ functions.  These\n      functions can be classified as protocol independent\
    \ (Link Resource\n      Manager (LRM), Routing Controller (RC)) or protocol specific\n\
    \      (Protocol Controller (PC)).\n   Routing Controller (RC): handles (abstract)\
    \ information needed for\n      routing and the routing information exchange with\
    \ peering RCs by\n      operating on the RDB.  The RC has access to a view of\
    \ the RDB.\n      The RC is protocol independent.\n   Note: Since the RDB may\
    \ contain routing information pertaining to\n      multiple RAs (and possibly\
    \ to multiple layer networks), the RCs\n      accessing the RDB may share the\
    \ routing information.\n   Link Resource Manager (LRM): supplies all the relevant\
    \ component and\n      TE link information to the RC.  It informs the RC about\
    \ any state\n      changes of the link resources it controls.\n   Protocol Controller\
    \ (PC): handles protocol-specific message exchanges\n      according to the reference\
    \ point over which the information is\n      exchanged (e.g., E-NNI, I-NNI) and\
    \ internal exchanges with the RC.\n      The PC function is protocol dependent.\n"
- title: Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 5787
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 5787\n   This document contains the following changes\
    \ from RFC 5787:\n   1. This document will be on the Standards Track, rather than\n\
    \      Experimental, and reflects experience gained from RFC 5787\n      implementation\
    \ and interoperability testing.  This also required\n      changes to the IANA\
    \ Considerations.\n   2. There is a new Section 3 on Terminology and Identification\
    \ to\n      describe the mapping of key ASON entities to OSPF entities.\n   3.\
    \ Sections were reorganized to explain terminology before defining\n      prefix\
    \ extensions.\n   4. There is a new Section 11, Management Considerations, which\n\
    \      describes how existing OSPF mechanisms address ASON requirements\n    \
    \  on Routing Area changes.\n   5. There is a new Section 12, which compares the\
    \ document to the\n      requirements in RFC 4258.\n   6. The prefix format was\
    \ changed to reference RFC 5786 rather than\n      defining a separate format\
    \ and The Node Attribute TLV in RFC 5786\n      has been updated as a result.\n\
    \   7. Routing Information Advertisements were simplified from RFC 5787.\n   8.\
    \ Review comments from ITU-T SG15 and the IESG were incorporated.\n"
