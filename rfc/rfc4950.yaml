  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP routers use the Internet Control Message Protocol, ICMPv4\n
    \  [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443], to convey control information to\n   source
    hosts.  Network operators use this information to diagnose\n   routing problems.\n
    \  When a router receives an undeliverable IP datagram, it can send an\n   ICMP
    message to the host that originated the datagram.  The ICMP\n   message indicates
    why the datagram could not be delivered.  It also\n   contains the IP header and
    leading payload octets of the \"original\n   datagram\" to which the ICMP message
    is a response.\n   MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSR) also use ICMP to convey
    control\n   information to source hosts.  Section 2.3 of [RFC3032] describes the\n
    \  interaction between MPLS and ICMP, and Sections 2.4 and 3 of\n   [RFC3032]
    provide applications of that interaction.\n   When an LSR receives an undeliverable
    MPLS-encapsulated datagram, it\n   removes the entire MPLS label stack, exposing
    the previously\n   encapsulated IP datagram.  The LSR then submits the IP datagram
    to an\n   error processing module.  Error processing can include ICMP message\n
    \  generation.\n   The ICMP message indicates why the original datagram could
    not be\n   delivered.  It also contains the IP header and leading octets of the\n
    \  original datagram.\n   The ICMP message, however, contains no information regarding
    the MPLS\n   label stack that encapsulated the original datagram when it arrived\n
    \  at the LSR.  This omission is significant because the LSR would have\n   forwarded
    the original datagram based upon information contained by\n   the MPLS label stack.\n
    \  This memo defines an ICMP extension object that permits an LSR to\n   append
    MPLS information to ICMP messages.  Selected ICMP messages\n   SHOULD include
    the MPLS label stack, as it arrived at the router that\n   is sending the ICMP
    message.  The ICMP message MUST also include the\n   IP header and leading payload
    octets of the original datagram.\n   The ICMP extensions defined in this document
    must be preceded by an\n   ICMP Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object
    Header.  Both are\n   defined in [RFC4884].\n   The ICMP extension defined in
    this document is equally applicable to\n   ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443].
    \ Throughout this document,\n   unless otherwise specified, the acronym ICMP refers
    to multi-part\n   ICMP messages, encompassing both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.\n"

  - "3.  Application to TRACEROUTE\n   The ICMP extension defined in this memo supports
    enhancements to\n   TRACEROUTE.  Enhanced TRACEROUTE applications, like older\n
    \  implementations, indicate which nodes the original datagram visited\n   en
    route to its destination.  They differ from older implementations\n   in that
    they also reflect the original datagram's MPLS encapsulation\n   status as it
    arrived at each node.\n   Figure 1 contains sample output from an enhanced TRACEROUTE\n
    \  implementation.\n   > traceroute 192.0.2.1\n     traceroute to 192.0.2.1 (192.0.2.1),

  - "4.  Disclaimer\n   This memo does not define the general relationship between
    ICMP and\n   MPLS.  Section 2.3 of [RFC3032] defines this relationship.\n   The
    current memo does not define encapsulation-specific TTL (Time to\n   Live) manipulation
    procedures.  It defers to Section 5.4 of RFC 3034\n   [RFC3034] and Section 10
    of [RFC3035] in this matter.\n   When encapsulation-specific TTL manipulation
    procedures defeat the\n   basic TRACEROUTE mechanism, they will also defeat enhanced
    TRACEROUTE\n   implementations.\n"

    the ICMP Time Exceeded\n   and Destination Unreachable messages.  A single instance
    of the MPLS\n   Label Stack Object represents the entire MPLS label stack, formatted\n
    \  exactly as it was when it arrived at the LSR that sends the ICMP\n   message.\n
    \  Figure 2 depicts the MPLS Label Stack Object.  It must be preceded by\n   an
    ICMP Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object Header.  Both\n   are defined
    in [RFC4884].\n   In the object payload, octets 0-3 depict the first member of
    the MPLS\n   label stack.  Each remaining member of the MPLS label stack is\n

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This memo does not specify the conditions that
    trigger the generation\n   of ICMP Messages for Labeled IP Packets.  It does not
    define the\n   interaction between MPLS and ICMP.  However, this document defines
    an\n   extension that allows an MPLS router to append MPLS information to\n   multi-part
    ICMP messages, and therefore can provide the user of the\n   TRACEROUTE application
    with additional information.  Consequently, a\n   network operator may wish to
    provide this information selectively\n   based on some policy; for example, only
    include the MPLS extensions\n   in ICMP messages destined to addresses within
    the network management\n   blocks with administrative control over the router.
    \ An\n   implementation could determine whether to include the MPLS Label\n   Stack
    extensions based upon the destination address of the ICMP\n   message, or based
    on a global configuration option in the router.\n   Alternatively, an implementation
    may determine whether to include\n   these MPLS extensions when TTL expires based
    on the number of label\n   stack entries (depth of the label stack) of the incoming
    packet.\n   Finally, an operator can make use of the TTL treatment on MPLS Pipe\n
    \  Model LSPs defined in [RFC3443] for a TTL-transparent mode of\n   operation
    that would prevent ICMP Time Exceeded altogether when\n   tunneled over the MPLS
    LSP.\n"
