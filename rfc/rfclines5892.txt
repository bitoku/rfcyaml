Abstract This document specifies rules for deciding whether a code point, considered in isolation or in context, is a candidate for inclusion in an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN).
It is part of the specification of Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications 2008 (IDNA2008).
[RFC4690] suggests an inclusion based approach for selecting the code points from The Unicode Standard
that should be included in the list of code points that may be used in Internationalized Domain Names.
Specifically, RFC 4690 [RFC4690] says the following:
The IAB has concluded that there is a consensus within the broader community that lists of code points should be specified by the use of an inclusion based mechanism (i.e., identifying the characters that are permitted), rather than by excluding a small number of characters from the total Unicode set as Stringprep [RFC3454] and Nameprep [RFC3491] do today.
That conclusion should be reviewed by the IETF community and action taken as appropriate.
This document reviews and classifies the collections of code points in the Unicode character set by examining various properties of the code points.
It then defines an algorithm for determining a derived property value.
It specifies a procedure, and not a table, of code points so that the algorithm can be used to determine code point sets independent of the version of Unicode that is in use.
This document is not intended to specify precisely how these property values are to be applied in IDN labels.
That information appears in the Protocol document [RFC5891], but it is important to understand that the assignment of a value of this property to a particular character is not sufficient to determine whether it can be used in a given label.
In particular, some combinations of allowed code points are not advisable for use in IDNs due to rules specific to a script or class of characters.
The requirement for such rules is linked to the operations in the Protocol document and especially to the characters designated as requiring contextual rules.
The value of the property is to be interpreted as follows.
Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs.
Code points with this property value are permitted for general use in IDNs.
However, that a label consists only of code points that have
this property value does not imply that the label can be used in DNS.
See the Protocol document for algorithms to make decisions about labels in domain names.
The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this value in the rest of this document.
Some characteristics of the character, such as it being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in others, require that it not be used in labels unless specific other characters or properties are present.
The abbreviated term CONTEXT is used to refer to this value in the rest of this document.
There are two subdivisions of CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED, one for Join controls (called CONTEXTJ) and for other characters (called CONTEXTO).
These are discussed in more detail below and in the Protocol document.
Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs.
Code points with this property value are not permitted in IDNs.
Those code points that are not designated (i.e., are unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.
The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the property for future versions of Unicode (including characters added after Unicode 5.2).
Changes in Unicode properties that do not affect the outcome of this process do not affect IDN.
For example, a character can have its Unicode General Category value (see [Unicode52])
change from So to Sm or from Lo to Ll, without affecting the algorithm results.
Moreover, even if such changes were the result, the BackwardCompatible list (Section 2.7) can be adjusted to ensure the stability of the results.
Some code points need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances but should be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described in other documents.
The most notable of these are the Join Control characters,
U 200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U 200C
Both of them have the derived property value CONTEXTJ.
A character with the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO
(CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED) is not to be used unless an appropriate rule has been established and the context of the character is consistent with that rule.
It is invalid to either register a string containing these characters or even to look one up unless such a contextual rule is found and satisfied.
Please see Appendix A, "The Contextual Rules Registry", for more information.
This document is part of a series that, together, constitute a proposal for updating the IDNA standards to resolve issues uncovered in recent years, cover a broader range of scripts, and provide for migration to newer versions of Unicode.
See the Rationale document [RFC5894] for a broader discussion.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Category Definitions Used to Calculate Derived Property Value
The derived property obtains its value based on a two step procedure.
First, characters are placed in one or more character categories based on either core properties defined by the Unicode Standard or by treating the code point as an exception and addressing the code point by its code point value.
These categories are not mutually exclusive.
In the second step, set operations are used with these categories to determine the values for an IDN specific property.
Those operations are specified in Section 3.
Unicode property names and property value names may have short abbreviations, such as gc for the General Category property, and Ll for the Lowercase Letter property value of the gc property.
In the following specification of categories, the operation that returns the value of a particular Unicode character property for a code point is designated by using the formal name of that property (from PropertyAliases.txt)
For example, the value of the General Category property for a code point is indicated by General Category(cp).
A: General Category(cp) is in {Ll, Lu, Lo, Nd, Lm, Mn,
These rules identify characters commonly used in mnemonics and often informally described as "language characters".
In general, only code points assigned to this category are suitable for use in IDN.
For more information, see Section 4.5 of The Unicode Standard [Unicode].
The categories used in this rule are:  Ll Lowercase Letter  Lu Uppercase Letter
This category is used to group the characters that are not stable under Normalization Form K (NFKC) and case folding.
In general, these code points are not suitable for use for IDN.
The toCaseFold() operation is defined in Section 3.13 of The Unicode Standard [Unicode].
The toNFKC() operation returns the code point in normalization form KC.
For more information, see Section 5 of Unicode Standard Annex #15 [TR15].
It should be noted that NFKC is used, although Normalization Form C (NFC) is used in the "IDNA Protocol" document [RFC5891].
IgnorableProperties (C) C: Default Ignorable Code Point(cp)
True or Noncharacter Code Point(cp)
This category is used to group code points that are not recommended for use in identifiers.
In general, these code points are not suitable for use in an IDN.
The definition for Default Ignorable Code Point can be found in DerivedCoreProperties.txt [DerivedCoreProperties] and is at the time of Unicode 5.2: Other Default Ignorable Code Point   Cf (Format characters)
Variation Selector White Space FFF9..FFFB (Annotation Characters)
0603, 06DD, 070F (exceptional Cf characters that should be visible) 2.4.
D: Block(cp) is in {Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols, Musical Symbols, Ancient Greek Musical Notation}
This category is used to identify code points that are not useful in mnemonics or that are otherwise impractical for IDN use.
In general, these code points are not suitable for use for IDN.
The definition of blocks can be found in Blocks.txt [BlockNames].
cp is in {002D, 0030..0039, 0061..
In general, these code points are suitable for use for IDN.
Note that there are other rules regarding the code point U 002D
that are specified in the IDNA Protocol Specification [RFC5891].
cp is in {00B7, 00DF, 0375, 03C2, 05F3, 05F4, 0640, 0660, 0661, 0662, 0663, 0664, 0665, 0666, 0667, 0668, 0669,
06F0, 06F1, 06F2, 06F3, 06F4, 06F5, 06F6, 06F7, 06F8, 06F9, 06FD, 06FE, 07FA, 0F0B, 3007, 302E, 302F, 3031, 3032, 3033, 3034, 3035, 303B, 30FB}
This category explicitly lists code points for which the category cannot be assigned using only the core property values that exist in the Unicode standard.
The values are according to the table below: PVALID   Would otherwise have been DISALLOWED 00DF;
INDIC DIGIT TWO 06F3; CONTEXTO
Would otherwise have been PVALID 0640; DISALLOWED # ARABIC TATWEEL 07FA; DISALLOWED # NKO LAJANYALAN 302E; DISALLOWED # HANGUL SINGLE DOT TONE MARK 302F; DISALLOWED # HANGUL DOUBLE DOT TONE MARK 3031;
DISALLOWED # VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK 3032; DISALLOWED # VERTICAL KANA REPEAT WITH VOICED SOUND MARK 3033; DISALLOWED # VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK UPPER HALF 3034; DISALLOWED # VERTICAL KANA REPEAT WITH VOICED SOUND MARK UPPER HA 3035; DISALLOWED # VERTICAL KANA REPEAT MARK LOWER HALF 303B
; DISALLOWED # VERTICAL IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK 2.7.
cp is in {} This category includes the code points that property values in versions of Unicode after 5.2 have changed in such a way that the derived property value would no longer be PVALID or DISALLOWED.
If changes are made to future versions of Unicode so that code points might change the property value from PVALID or DISALLOWED, then this table can be updated and keep special exception values so that the property values for code points stay stable.
JoinControl (H) H: Join Control(cp)
This category consists of Join Control characters (i.e., they are not in LetterDigits (Section 2.1) but are still required in IDN labels under some circumstances).
Hangul Syllable Type(cp) is in {L, V, T} This category consists of all conjoining Hangul Jamo (Leading Jamo, Vowel Jamo, and Trailing Jamo).
Elimination of conjoining Hangul Jamo from the set of PVALID characters results in restricting the set of Korean PVALID characters just to preformed, modern Hangul syllable characters.
Old Hangul syllables, which must be spelled with sequences of conjoining Hangul Jamo, are not PVALID for IDNs.
Unassigned (J) J: General Category(cp) is in {Cn} and Noncharacter Code Point(cp)
This category consists of code points in the Unicode character
set that are not (yet) assigned.
It should be noted that Unicode distinguishes between "unassigned code points" and "unassigned characters".
The unassigned code points are all but (Cn Noncharacters), while the unassigned  characters  are all but (Cn   Cs).
Calculation of the Derived Property
As described above (Section 1) and in more detail in the IDNA Protocol document [RFC5891], possible values of the IDN property are:  PVALID  CONTEXTJ  CONTEXTO  DISALLOWED  UNASSIGNED
The algorithm to calculate the value of the derived property is as follows.
If the name of a rule (such as Exception) is used, that implies the set of code points that the rule defines, while the same name as a function call (such as Exception(cp)) implies the value cp has in the Exceptions table.
Then PVALID; Else DISALLOWED; 4.  Code Points
The categories and rules defined in Sections 2 and 3 apply to all Unicode code points.
The table in Appendix B shows, for illustrative purposes, the consequences of the categories and classification rules, and the resulting property values.
The list of code points that can be found in Appendix B is non normative.
Sections 2 and 3 are normative.
Property Value Registry IANA has created a registry with the derived properties for the versions of Unicode released after (and including) version 5.2.
The derived property value is to be calculated in cooperation with a designated expert [RFC5226] according to the specifications in Sections 2 and 3 and not by copying the non normative table found in Appendix B.
If non backward compatible changes or other problems arise during the creation or designated expert review of the table of derived property values, they should be flagged for the IESG.
Changes to the rules (as specified in Sections 2 and 3), including BackwardCompatible (Section 2.7)
(a set that is at release of this document is empty) require IETF Review, as described in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].
For characters that are defined in the IDNA derived property value registry (Section 5.1) as CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ and that therefore require a contextual rule, IANA has created and now maintains a list of approved contextual rules.
Additions or changes to these rules require IETF Review, as described in [RFC5226].
Appendix A contains further discussion and a table from which that registry can be initialized.
The following information is to be given when a new rule is created.
Unique name of the rule Code point: Rule that should be applied when this code point exists in the label Overview: Description in plain English on what the rule verifies
Lookup: Should the rule be applied at time of lookup?
The set of rules, with a reference to the defining document.
Security Considerations Security Considerations for this version of IDNA, except for the special issues associated with right to left scripts and characters, are described in the Definitions document [RFC5890].
Specific issues for labels containing characters associated with scripts written right to left appear in the Bidi document [RFC5893].
Appendix A.  Contextual Rules Registry
As discussed in Section 5.2 and in the IANA Considerations section of the Rationale document [RFC5894], a registry of rules that define the contexts in which particular PROTOCOL VALID characters, characters associated with a requirement for Contextual Information, are permitted.
These rules are expressed as tests on the label in which the characters appear (all, or any part of, the label may be tested).
The grammatical rules are expressed in pseudo code.
The conventions used for that pseudo code are explained here.
Each rule is constructed as a Boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False.
simple "True;" or "False;" rule sets the default result value for the rule set.
Subsequent conditional rules that evaluate to True or False may re set the result value.
A special value "Undefined" is used to deal with any error conditions, such as an attempt to test a character before the start of a label or after the end of a label.
If any term of a rule evaluates to Undefined, further evaluation of the rule immediately terminates, as the result value of the rule will itself be Undefined.
cp represents the code point to be tested.
FirstChar is a special term that denotes the first code point in a label.
LastChar is a special term that denotes the last code point in a label.
B evaluates to True if A equals B. .is.
represents checking the position in a label.
B evaluates to True if A and B have same position in the same label.
represents the non equality relation.
B evaluates to True if A is not equal to B. .in.
represents the set inclusion relation.
B evaluates to True if A is a member of the set B. A functional notation, Function Name(cp), is used to express either string positions within a label, Boolean character property tests of a code point, or a regular expression match.
When such function names refer to Boolean character property tests, the function names use the exact Unicode character property name for the property in question, and "cp" is evaluated as the Unicode value of the code point to be tested, rather than as its position in the label.
When such function names refer to string positions within a label, "cp" is evaluated as its position in the label.
RegExpMatch(X) takes as its parameter X a schematic regular expression consisting of a mix of Unicode character property values and literal Unicode code points.
Script(cp) returns the value of the Unicode Script property, as defined in Scripts.txt in the Unicode Character Database.
Canonical Combining Class(cp) returns the value of the Unicode Canonical Combining Class property, as defined in UnicodeData.txt in the Unicode Character Database.
Before(cp) returns the code point of the character immediately preceding cp in logical order in the string representing the label.
After(cp) returns the code point of the character immediately following cp in logical order in the string representing the label.
Note that "Before" and "After" do not refer to the visual display order of the character in a label, which may be reversed or otherwise modified by the bidirectional algorithm for labels including characters from scripts written right to left.
Instead, "Before" and "After" refer to the network order of the character in the label.
The clauses "Then True" and "Then False" imply exit from the pseudo code routine with the corresponding result.
Repeated evaluation for all characters in a label makes use of the special construct:
End For; This construct requires repeated evaluation of "Expression" for each code point in the label, starting from FirstChar and proceeding to LastChar.
The different fields in the rules are to be interpreted as follows:
The code point, or code points, to which this rule is to be applied.
Normally, this implies that if any of the code points in a label is as defined, then the rules should be applied.
If evaluated to True, the code point is OK as used; if evaluated to False, it is not OK.
A description of the goal with the rule, in plain English.
True if application of this rule is recommended at lookup time; False otherwise.
Rule Set: The rule set itself, as described above.
NON JOINER Code point: U 200C Overview:
This may occur in a formally cursive script (such as Arabic) in a context where it breaks a cursive connection as required for orthographic rules, as in the Persian language, for example.
It also may occur in Indic scripts in a consonant conjunct context (immediately following a virama), to control required display of such conjuncts.
; If Canonical Combining Class(Before(cp)) .eq.
Then True; If RegExpMatch((Joining Type:{L,D})(Joining Type:T) \u200C (Joining Type:T) (Joining Type:{R,D}))
ZERO WIDTH JOINER Code point: U 200D Overview:
This may occur in Indic scripts in a consonant conjunct context (immediately following a virama), to control required display of such conjuncts.
; If Canonical Combining Class(Before(cp)) .eq.
MIDDLE DOT Code point: U 00B7
(U 006C) characters only, used to permit the Catalan character ela geminada to be expressed.
The script of the following character MUST be Greek.
GERESH Code point: U 05F3
The script of the preceding character MUST be Hebrew.
The script of the preceding character MUST be Hebrew.
KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT Code point:
Note that the Script of Katakana Middle Dot is not any of "Hiragana", "Katakana", or "Han".
The effect of this rule is to require at least one character in the label to be in one of those scripts.
False Rule Set: False; For All Characters: If Script(cp) .in.
Overview: Can not be mixed with Extended Arabic Indic Digits.
True; For All Characters: If cp .in.
Overview: Can not be mixed with Arabic Indic Digits.
True; For All Characters: If cp .in. 0660
Appendix B.  Code Points 0x0000
If one applies the rules (Section 3) to the code points 0x0000
to 0x10FFFF to Unicode 5.2, the result is as follows.
This list is non normative, and only included for illustrative purposes.
Specifically, what is displayed in the third column is not the formal name of the code point (as defined in Section 4.8 of The Unicode Standard [Unicode52]).
The differences exist, for example, for the code points that have the code point value as part of the name (for example, CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH 4E00) and the naming of Hangul syllables.
For many code points, what you see is the official name.
