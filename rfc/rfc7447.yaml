- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The BGP Entropy Label Capability attribute is defined in RFC 6790.\n\
    \   Regrettably, it has a bug: although RFC 6790 mandates that routers\n   incapable\
    \ of processing Entropy Labels must remove the attribute,\n   fulfillment of this\
    \ requirement cannot be guaranteed in practice.\n   This specification deprecates\
    \ the attribute.  A forthcoming document\n   will propose a replacement.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6790] defines the Entropy Label Capability attribute\
    \ (ELCA), an\n   optional, transitive BGP path attribute.  For correct operation,\
    \ an\n   intermediate node modifying the next hop of a route must remove the\n\
    \   ELCA unless the node doing so is able to process entropy labels.\n   Sadly,\
    \ this requirement cannot be fulfilled with the ELCA as\n   specified, because\
    \ it is an optional, transitive attribute.  By\n   definition, a node that does\
    \ not support the ELCA will propagate the\n   attribute (this is a general property\
    \ of optional, transitive\n   attributes; see [RFC4271]).  But such an ELCA-oblivious\
    \ node is\n   likely to be incapable of processing entropy labels and is exactly\n\
    \   the node that we desire to remove the attribute!\n   This specification updates\
    \ RFC 6790 by deprecating the version of\n   ELCA defined in Section 5.2 of that\
    \ document.  A forthcoming document\n   will propose a replacement.  All other\
    \ sections of RFC 6790 are\n   unchanged.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Deprecation of ELCA
  contents:
  - "2.  Deprecation of ELCA\n   This document deprecates the ELCA path attribute.\
    \  This means that\n   implementations MUST NOT generate the attribute.  If received,\
    \ the\n   attribute MUST be treated as any other unrecognized optional,\n   transitive\
    \ attribute as per [RFC4271], until and unless the code\n   point is reused by\
    \ some new specification.  (To the authors' best\n   knowledge, there are no implementations\
    \ of ELCA at the time of\n   writing.)\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   For the reasons given in Section 1, IANA has marked\
    \ attribute 28 \"BGP\n   Entropy Label Capability Attribute\" in the \"BGP Path\
    \ Attributes\"\n   registry as \"deprecated\" and has added a reference to this\
    \ RFC.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   ELCA, as defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6790],\
    \ has in common with\n   other optional, transitive path attributes the property\
    \ that it will\n   be \"tunneled\" through intervening routers that don't implement\
    \ the\n   relevant specification.  Unfortunately, as discussed elsewhere in\n\
    \   this document, implementations of ELCA that receive such \"tunneled\"\n  \
    \ attributes could -- sometimes improperly -- rely on them.  The\n   consequence\
    \ of doing so could be a black hole in the forwarding path\n   for the affected\
    \ routes.  Whether or not this is a new security issue\n   is somewhat debatable,\
    \ since an attacker would have to be part of the\n   control-plane path for the\
    \ route in question in order for the\n   attacker to exploit the issue.  Under\
    \ those circumstances, an\n   attacker already has a panoply of mischief-making\
    \ tools available, as\n   discussed in [RFC4272].\n   In any case, this document\
    \ renders any real or imagined security\n   issues with ELCA moot, by deprecating\
    \ it.\n"
