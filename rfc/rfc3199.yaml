    \      Specifications for E-Commerce\nCustomers are frequently required to enter\
    \ substantial amounts of\ninformation at an Internet merchant site in order to\
    \ complete a purchase\nor other transaction, especially the first time they go\
    \ there.  A\nstandard set of information fields is defined as the first version\
    \ of an\nElectronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) so that this task can be\n\
    more easily automated, for example by wallet software that could fill in\nfields.\
    \  Even for the manual data entry case, customers will be less\nconfused by varying\
    \ merchant sites if a substantial number adopt these\nstandard fields.  In addition,\
    \ some fields are defined for merchant to\nconsumer communication.  This memo\

    \      Specification\nThis document presents a protocol with which to implement\
    \ Realm Specific\nIP (RSIP).  The protocol defined herein allows negotiation of\
    \ resources\nbetween an RSIP host and gateway, so that the host can lease some\
    \ of the\ngateway's addressing parameters in order to establish a global network\n\
    presence.  This protocol is designed to operate on the application layer\nand\
    \ to use its own TCP or UDP port.  In particular, the protocol allows\na gateway\
    \ to allocate addressing and control parameters to a host such\nthat a flow policy\
    \ can be enforced at the gateway.  This memo defines an\nExperimental Protocol\
    \ for the Internet community.\n3102    Borella         Oct 2001        Realm Specific\
    \ IP: Framework\nThis document examines the general framework of Realm Specific\
    \ IP\n(RSIP).  RSIP is intended as a alternative to NAT in which the end-to-\n\
    end integrity of packets is maintained.  We focus on implementation\nissues, deployment\
    \ scenarios, and interaction with other layer-three\nprotocols.  This memo defines\
    \ an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\ncommunity.\n3101    Murphy      \

    \             (NSSA) Option\nThis memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest\
    \ Path First (OSPF)\narea that is somewhat humorously referred to as a \"not-so-stubby\"\
    \ area\n(or NSSA).  NSSAs are similar to the existing OSPF stub area\nconfiguration\
    \ option but have the additional capability of importing AS\nexternal routes in\
    \ a limited fashion.\nThe OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.\
    \  The functional\ndifferences between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in\
    \ Appendix F.\nAll differences, while expanding capability, are backward-compatible\
    \ in\nnature.  Implementations of this memo and of RFC 1587 will interoperate.\n\
