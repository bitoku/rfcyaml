  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to define the Community-based\n\
    \   Administrative Framework for the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2).\n   The\
    \ SNMPv2 framework is fully described in [1-6].  This framework is\n   derived\
    \ from the original Internet-standard Network Management\n   Framework (SNMPv1),\
    \ which consists of these three documents:\n      STD 16, RFC 1155 [7] which defines\
    \ the Structure of Management\n      Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for\
    \ describing and naming\n      objects for the purpose of management.\n      STD\
    \ 16, RFC 1212 [8] which defines a more concise description\n      mechanism,\
    \ which is wholly consistent with the SMI.\n      STD 15, RFC 1157 [9] which defines\
    \ the Simple Network Management\n      Protocol (SNMP), the protocol used for\
    \ network access to managed\n      objects.\n   For information on coexistence\
    \ between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, consult\n   [10].\n"
- title: 2.  Components of the SNMPv2 Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  Components of the SNMPv2 Framework\n   A management system contains:  several\
    \ (potentially many) nodes, each\n   with a processing entity, termed an agent,\
    \ which has access to\n   management instrumentation; at least one management\
    \ station; and, a\n   management protocol, used to convey management information\
    \ between\n   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol\
    \ are\n   carried out under an administrative framework which defines\n   authentication,\
    \ authorization, access control, and privacy policies.\n   Management stations\
    \ execute management applications which monitor and\n   control managed elements.\
    \  Managed elements are devices such as\n   hosts, routers, terminal servers,\
    \ etc., which are monitored and\n   controlled via access to their management\
    \ information.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Structure of Management Information
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Structure of Management Information\n   Management information is viewed\
    \ as a collection of managed objects,\n   residing in a virtual information store,\
    \ termed the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects\
    \ are defined\n   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of\
    \ OSI's\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [11].  It is the purpose of the\n\
    \   Structure of Management Information for SNMPv2 document [1] to define\n  \
    \ that subset.\n   The SMI is divided into three parts:  module definitions, object\n\
    \   definitions, and, trap definitions.\n   (1)  Module definitions are used when\
    \ describing information modules.\n        An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY, is\
    \ used to concisely convey the\n        semantics of an information module.\n\
    \   (2)  Object definitions are used when describing managed objects.  An\n  \
    \      ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax\n    \
    \    and semantics of a managed object.\n   (3)  Notification definitions are\
    \ used when describing unsolicited\n        transmissions of management information.\
    \  An ASN.1 macro,\n        NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the\
    \ syntax and\n        semantics of a notification.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Textual Conventions\n   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful\
    \ to define new types\n   similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison\
    \ to a type defined\n   in the SMI, each of these new types has a different name,\
    \ a similar\n   syntax, but a more precise semantics.  These newly defined types\
    \ are\n   termed textual conventions, and are used for the convenience of\n  \
    \ humans reading the MIB module.  It is the purpose of the Textual\n   Conventions\
    \ for SNMPv2 document [2] to define the initial set of\n   textual conventions\
    \ available to all MIB modules.\n   Objects defined using a textual convention\
    \ are always encoded by\n   means of the rules that define their primitive type.\
    \  However,\n   textual conventions often have special semantics associated with\n\
    \   them.  As such, an ASN.1 macro, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, is used to\n   concisely\
    \ convey the syntax and semantics of a textual convention.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Conformance Statements
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Conformance Statements\n   It may be useful to define the acceptable lower-bounds\
    \ of\n   implementation, along with the actual level of implementation\n   achieved.\
    \  It is the purpose of the Conformance Statements for SNMPv2\n   document [3]\
    \ to define the notation used for these purposes.  There\n   are two kinds of\
    \ notations:\n   (1)  Compliance statements are used when describing requirements\
    \ for\n        agents with respect to object definitions.  An ASN.1 macro,\n \
    \       MODULE-COMPLIANCE, is used to concisely convey such requirements.\n  \
    \ (2)  Capability statements are used when describing capabilities of\n      \
    \  agents with respect to object definitions.  An ASN.1 macro, AGENT-\n      \
    \  CAPABILITIES, is used to concisely convey such capabilities.\n   Finally, collections\
    \ of related objects are grouped together to form\n   a unit of conformance. \
    \ An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-GROUP, is used to\n   concisely convey the syntax and\
    \ semantics of a group.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Protocol Operations
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Protocol Operations\n   The management protocol provides for the exchange\
    \ of messages which\n   convey management information between the agents and the\
    \ management\n   stations.  The form of these messages is a message \"wrapper\"\
    \ which\n   encapsulates a Protocol Data Unit (PDU).\n   It is the purpose of\
    \ the Protocol Operations for SNMPv2 document [4]\n   to define the operations\
    \ of the protocol with respect to the sending\n   and receiving of the PDUs.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Transport Mappings
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Transport Mappings\n   The management protocol, version 2 of the Simple\
    \ Network Management\n   Protocol, may be used over a variety of protocol suites.\
    \  It is the\n   purpose of the Transport Mappings for SNMPv2 document [5] to\
    \ define\n   how the SNMPv2 maps onto an initial set of transport domains.  Other\n\
    \   mappings may be defined in the future.\n   Although several mappings are defined,\
    \ the mapping onto UDP is the\n   preferred mapping.  As such, to provide for\
    \ the greatest level of\n   interoperability, systems which choose to deploy other\
    \ mappings\n   should also provide for proxy service to the UDP mapping.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Protocol Instrumentation
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Protocol Instrumentation\n   It is the purpose of the Management Information\
    \ Base for SNMPv2\n   document [6] to define managed objects which describe the\
    \ behavior of\n   a SNMPv2 entity.\n"
- title: 3.  The Community-based Administrative Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The Community-based Administrative Framework\n   It is the purpose of an\
    \ administrative framework to define an\n   infrastructure through which effective\
    \ management can be realized in\n   a variety of configurations and environments.\
    \  Specified as a part\n   of, or as extensions of, an administrative framework\
    \ are security\n   mechanisms used to achieve an administratively-defined level\
    \ of\n   security for protocol interactions.\n   The administrative framework\
    \ for SNMPv2 identified in this document\n   is the same framework as was defined\
    \ for SNMPv1 [9].  This\n   administrative framework associates each message with\
    \ a \"community\"\n   as defined in [9].  Use of this administrative framework\
    \ with SNMP\n   Version 2 is commonly known as \"Community-based SNMPv2 (SNMPv2C).\"\
    \n   Specifically, Section 3.2.5 of [9] defines the concept of a\n   community,\
    \ and Section 4.1 of [9] defines the Elements of Procedure\n   for generating\
    \ and receiving messages.  The following updates apply:\n   (1)  The types of\
    \ access defined in Section 3.2.5 of [9] are updated\n        by [1].\n   (2)\
    \  The Elements of Procedure defined in Section 4.1 of [9] are\n        updated\
    \ with the additional requirement of incrementing the\n        relevant statistics\
    \ counter as defined in [6].\n   (3)  The requirement in the Elements of Procedure\
    \ in Section 4.1 of\n        [9] that the \"the source transport address that\
    \ a response\n        message is sent from shall be identical to the destination\n\
    \        transport address that the original request message was sent to\"\n \
    \       is deleted, i.e., the source transport address of a response\n       \
    \ message can be any transport address belonging to the agent.\n   The form of\
    \ a message is also taken from [9], with the exception that\n   a new version\
    \ number is used in the message \"wrapper\".  Use of a new\n   version number\
    \ is necessary because of SNMPv2's new PDU types [4],\n   error codes [4], etc.\
    \  With this one change, the wrapper becomes:\n    COMMUNITY-BASED-SNMPv2 DEFINITIONS\
    \ ::= BEGIN\n    -- top-level message\n        Message ::=\n                SEQUENCE\
    \ {\n                     version\n                        INTEGER {\n       \
    \                     version(1)  -- modified from RFC 1157\n                \
    \        },\n                    community           -- community name\n     \
    \                   OCTET STRING,\n                    data                --\
    \ PDUs as defined in [4]\n                        ANY\n                }\n   \
    \     }\n    END\n   Note that with this administrative framework, the\n   'authorizationError(16)'\
    \ value defined for the error-status component\n   of an SNMPv2 PDU [4] is unused.\
    \  It may, however, be used with future\n   administrative frameworks.\n"
