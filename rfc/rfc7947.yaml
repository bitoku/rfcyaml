  - "1.  Introduction to Multilateral Interconnection\n   Internet Exchange Points
    (IXPs) provide IP data interconnection\n   facilities for their participants,
    typically using shared Layer 2\n   networking media such as Ethernet.  The Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n   [RFC4271], an inter-Autonomous System (inter-AS) routing
    protocol, is\n   commonly used to facilitate exchange of network reachability\n
    \  information over such media.\n   While bilateral EBGP sessions between exchange
    participants were\n   previously the most common means of exchanging reachability\n
    \  information, the overhead associated with dense interconnection can\n   cause
    substantial operational scaling problems for participants of\n   larger IXPs.\n
    \  Multilateral interconnection is a method of interconnecting BGP\n   speaking
    routers using a third-party brokering system, commonly\n   referred to as a route
    server and typically managed by the IXP\n   operator.  Each multilateral interconnection
    participant (usually\n   referred to as a \"route server client\") announces network\n
    \  reachability information to the route server using EBGP.  The route\n   server,
    in turn, forwards this information to each route server\n   client connected to
    it, according to its configuration.  Although a\n   route server uses BGP to exchange
    reachability information with each\n   of its clients, it does not forward traffic
    itself and is therefore\n   not a router.\n   A route server can be viewed as
    similar in function to a route\n   reflector [RFC4456], except that it operates
    using EBGP instead of\n   Internal BGP (IBGP).  Certain adaptions to [RFC4271]
    are required to\n   enable an EBGP router to operate as a route server; these
    are\n   outlined in Section 2 of this document.  Route server functionality\n
    \  is not mandatory in BGP implementations.\n   The term \"route server\" is often
    used in a different context to\n   describe a BGP node whose purpose is to accept
    BGP feeds from\n   multiple clients for the purpose of operational analysis and\n
    \  troubleshooting.  A system of this form may alternatively be known as\n   a
    \"route collector\" or a \"route-views server\".  This document uses\n   the term
    \"route server\" exclusively to describe multilateral peering\n   brokerage systems.\n"

  - "2.  Technical Considerations for Route Server Implementations\n   A route server
    uses BGP [RFC4271] to broker network reachability\n   information amongst its
    clients.  There are some differences between\n   the behavior of a BGP route server
    and a BGP implementation that is\n   strictly compliant with [RFC4271].  These
    differences are described\n   as follows.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Client UPDATE Messages\n   A route server MUST accept all UPDATE messages
      received from each of\n   its clients for inclusion in its Adj-RIB-In.  These
      UPDATE messages\n   MAY be omitted from the route server's Loc-RIB or Loc-RIBs,
      due to\n   filters configured for the purpose of implementing routing policy.\n
      \  The route server SHOULD perform one or more BGP Decision Processes to\n   select
      routes for subsequent advertisement to its clients, taking\n   into account
      possible configuration to provide multiple Network Layer\n   Reachability Information
      (NLRI) paths to a particular client as\n   described in Section 2.3.2.2 or multiple
      Loc-RIBs as described in\n   Section 2.3.2.1.  The route server SHOULD forward
      UPDATE messages\n   from its Loc-RIB or Loc-RIBs to its clients as determined
      by local\n   policy.\n"

    - "2.2.  Attribute Transparency\n   As a route server primarily performs a brokering
      service,\n   modification of attributes could cause route server clients to

      thereby changing the intended routing policies of\n   exchange participants.
      \ Therefore, contrary to what is specified in\n   Section 5 of [RFC4271], route
      servers SHOULD NOT by default (unless\n   explicitly configured) update well-known
      BGP attributes received from\n   route server clients before redistributing
      them to their other route\n   server clients.  Optional recognized and unrecognized
      BGP attributes,\n   whether transitive or non-transitive, SHOULD NOT be updated

          server client BGP Decision Process,\n   the route server SHOULD NOT prepend
          its own AS number to the AS_PATH\n   segment nor modify the AS_PATH segment
          in any other way.  This\n   differs from the behavior specified in Section
          5.1.2 of [RFC4271],\n   which requires that the BGP speaker prepends its
          own AS number as the\n   last element of the AS_PATH segment.  This is a
          recommendation rather\n   than a requirement solely to provide backwards

        Policy Controlled Interconnection at an IXP\n   Using the example in Figure
        1, AS1 does not directly exchange prefix\n   information with either AS2 or
        AS3 at the IXP but only interconnects\n   with AS4.  The lines between AS1,
        AS2, AS3, and AS4 represent\n   interconnection relationships, whether via
        bilateral or multilateral\n   connections.\n   In the traditional bilateral
        interconnection model, per-client policy\n   control to a third-party exchange
        participant is accomplished either\n   by not engaging in a bilateral interconnection
        with that participant\n   or by implementing outbound filtering on the BGP
        session towards that\n   participant.  However, in a multilateral interconnection
        environment,\n   only the route server can perform outbound filtering in the
        direction\n   of the route server client; route server clients depend on the
        route\n   server to perform their outbound filtering for them.\n   Assuming
        the BGP Decision Process [RFC4271] is used, when the same\n   prefix is advertised
        to a route server from multiple route server\n   clients, the route server
        will select a single path for propagation\n   to all connected clients.  If,
        however, the route server has been\n   configured to filter the calculated
        best path from reaching a\n   particular route server client, then that client
        will not receive a\n   path for that prefix, although alternate paths received
        by the route\n   server might have been policy compliant for that client.
        \ This\n   phenomenon is referred to as \"path hiding\".\n   For example,
        in Figure 1, if the same prefix were sent to the route\n   server via AS2
        and AS4, and the route via AS2 was preferred according\n   to the BGP Decision
        Process on the route server, but AS2's policy\n   prevented the route server
        from sending the path to AS1, then AS1\n   would never receive a path to this
        prefix, even though the route\n   server had previously received a valid alternative
        path via AS4.\n   This happens because the BGP Decision Process is performed
        only once\n   on the route server for all clients.\n   Path hiding will only
        occur on route servers that employ per-client\n   policy control; if an IXP
        operator deploys a route server without\n   implementing a per-client routing
        policy control system, then path\n   hiding does not occur, as all paths are
        considered equally valid from\n   the point of view of the route server.\n"

          for per-client policy control\n   without the occurrence of path hiding
          is to use a route server BGP\n   implementation that performs the per-client
          best path calculation for\n   each set of paths to a prefix, which results
          after the route server's\n   client policies have been taken into consideration.
          \ This can be\n   implemented by using per-client Loc-RIBs, with path filtering\n
          \  implemented between the Adj-RIB-In and the per-client Loc-RIB.\n   Implementations
          can optimize this by maintaining paths not subject to\n   filtering policies
          in a global Loc-RIB, with per-client Loc-RIBs\n   stored as deltas.\n   This
          implementation is highly portable, as it makes no assumptions\n   about
          the feature capabilities of the route server clients.\n"

          above assumes standard BGP\n   session encoding where the route server sends
          a single path to its\n   client for any given prefix.  This path is selected
          using the BGP\n   path selection Decision Process described in [RFC4271].
          \ If, however,\n   it were possible for the route server to send more than
          a single path\n   to a route server client, then route server clients would
          no longer\n   depend on receiving a single path to a particular prefix;\n
          \  consequently, the path-hiding problem described in Section 2.3.1\n   would
          disappear.\n   We present two methods that describe how such increased path\n
          \  diversity could be implemented.\n"

          - "2.3.2.2.1.  Diverse BGP Path Approach\n   The diverse BGP path proposal
            as defined in [RFC6774] is a simple way\n   to distribute multiple prefix
            paths from a route server to a route\n   server client by using a separate
            BGP session from the route server\n   to a client for each different path.\n
            \  The number of paths that may be distributed to a client is\n   constrained
            by the number of BGP sessions that the server and the\n   client are willing
            to establish with each other.  The distributed\n   paths may be established
            from the global BGP Loc-RIB on the route\n   server in addition to any
            per-client Loc-RIB.  As there may be more\n   potential paths to a given
            prefix than configured BGP sessions, this\n   method is not guaranteed
            to eliminate the path-hiding problem in all\n   situations.  Furthermore,
            this method may significantly increase the\n   number of BGP sessions
            handled by the route server, which may\n   negatively impact its performance.\n"

            approach to multiple path propagation,\n   by allowing a BGP speaker to
            forward multiple paths for the same\n   prefix on a single BGP session.
            \ As [RFC4271] specifies that a BGP\n   listener must implement an implicit
            withdraw when it receives an\n   UPDATE message for a prefix that already
            exists in its Adj-RIB-In,\n   this approach requires explicit support
            for the feature both on the\n   route server and on its clients.\n   If
            the ADD-PATH capability is negotiated bidirectionally between the\n   route
            server and a route server client, and the route server client\n   propagates
            multiple paths for the same prefix to the route server,\n   then this
            could potentially cause the propagation of inactive,\n   invalid, or suboptimal
            paths to the route server, thereby causing\n   loss of reachability to
            other route server clients.  For this reason,\n   ADD-PATH implementations
            on a route server should enforce a send-only\n   mode with the route server

- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The path-hiding problem outlined in Section 2.3.1
    can be used in\n   certain circumstances to proactively block third-party path\n
    \  announcements from other route server clients.  Route server\n   operators
    should be aware that security issues may arise unless steps\n   are taken to mitigate
    against path hiding.\n   The AS_PATH check described in Section 2.2.2 is normally
    enabled in\n   order to check for malformed AS paths.  If this check is disabled,\n
    \  the route server client loses the ability to check incoming UPDATE\n   messages
    for certain categories of problems.  This could potentially\n   cause corrupted
    BGP UPDATE messages to be propagated where they might\n   not be propagated if
    the check were enabled.  Regardless of any\n   problems relating to malformed
    UPDATE messages, this check is also\n   used to detect BGP loops; removing the
    check could potentially cause\n   routing loops to be formed.  Consequently, this
    check SHOULD NOT be\n   disabled by IXP participants unless it is needed to establish
    BGP\n   sessions with a route server and, if possible, should only be\n   disabled
    for peers that are route servers.\n   Route server operators should carefully
    consider the security\n   practices discussed in \"BGP Operations and Security\"
    [RFC7454].\n"
