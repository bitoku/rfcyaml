  - "1.  Introduction\n   Two user agents involved in a SIP [RFC3261] dialog may find\
    \ it\n   impossible to establish a media session due to a variety of\n   incompatibilities.\
    \  Assuming that both user agents understand the\n   same session description\
    \ format (e.g., SDP [RFC4566]),\n   incompatibilities can be found at the user\
    \ agent level and at the\n   user level.  At the user agent level, both terminals\
    \ may not support\n   any common codec or may not support common media types (e.g.,\
    \ a text-\n   only terminal and an audio-only terminal).  At the user level, a\
    \ deaf\n   person will not understand anything said over an audio stream.\n  \
    \ In order to make communications possible in the presence of\n   incompatibilities,\
    \ user agents need to introduce intermediaries that\n   provide transcoding services\
    \ to a session.  From the SIP point of\n   view, the introduction of a transcoder\
    \ is done in the same way to\n   resolve both user level and user agent level\
    \ incompatibilities.  So,\n   the invocation mechanisms described in this document\
    \ are generally\n   applicable to any type of incompatibility related to how the\n\
    \   information that needs to be communicated is encoded.\n      Furthermore,\
    \ although this framework focuses on transcoding, the\n      mechanisms described\
    \ are applicable to media manipulation in\n      general.  It would be possible\
    \ to use them, for example, to invoke\n      a server that simply increases the\
    \ volume of an audio stream.\n   This document does not describe media server\
    \ discovery.  That is an\n   orthogonal problem that one can address using user\
    \ agent provisioning\n   or other methods.\n   The remainder of this document\
    \ is organized as follows.  Section 2\n   deals with the discovery of the need\
    \ for transcoding services for a\n   particular session.  Section 3 introduces\
    \ the third-party call\n   control and conference bridge transcoding invocation\
    \ models, which\n   are further described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.\
    \  Both\n   models meet the requirements regarding transcoding services\n   invocation\
    \ in RFC 3351 [RFC3351], which support deaf, hard of\n   hearing, and speech-impaired\
    \ individuals.\n"
- title: 2.  Discovery of the Need for Transcoding Services
  contents:
  - "2.  Discovery of the Need for Transcoding Services\n   According to the one-party\
    \ consent model defined in RFC 3238\n   [RFC3238], services that involve media\
    \ manipulation invocation are\n   best invoked by one of the endpoints involved\
    \ in the communication,\n   as opposed to being invoked by an intermediary in\
    \ the network.\n   Following this principle, one of the endpoints should be the\
    \ one\n   detecting that transcoding is needed for a particular session.\n   In\
    \ order to decide whether or not transcoding is needed, a user agent\n   needs\
    \ to know the capabilities of the remote user agent.  A user\n   agent acting\
    \ as an offerer [RFC3264] typically obtains this knowledge\n   by downloading\
    \ a presence document that includes media capabilities\n   (e.g., Bob is available\
    \ on a terminal that only supports audio) or by\n   getting an SDP description\
    \ of media capabilities as defined in RFC\n   3264 [RFC3264].\n   Presence documents\
    \ are typically received in a NOTIFY request\n   [RFC3265] as a result of a subscription.\
    \  SDP media capabilities\n   descriptions are typically received in a 200 (OK)\
    \ response to an\n   OPTIONS request or in a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response\
    \ to an\n   INVITE.\n   In the absence of presence information, routing logic\
    \ that involves\n   parallel forking to several user agents may make it difficult\
    \ (or\n   impossible) for the caller to know which user agent will answer the\n\
    \   next call attempt.  For example, a call attempt may reach the user's\n   voicemail\
    \ while the next one may reach a SIP phone where the user is\n   available.  If\
    \ both terminating user agents have different\n   capabilities, the caller cannot\
    \ know, even after the first call\n   attempt, whether or not transcoding will\
    \ be necessary for the\n   session.  This is a well-known SIP problem that is\
    \ referred to as\n   HERFP (Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem).  Resolving\n\
    \   HERFP is outside the scope of this document.\n   It is recommended that an\
    \ offerer does not invoke transcoding\n   services before making sure that the\
    \ answerer does not support the\n   capabilities needed for the session.  Making\
    \ wrong assumptions about\n   the answerer's capabilities can lead to situations\
    \ where two\n   transcoders are introduced (one by the offerer and one by the\n\
    \   answerer) in a session that would not need any transcoding services\n   at\
    \ all.\n      An example of the situation above is a call between two GSM\n  \
    \    (Global System for Mobile Communications) phones (without using\n      transcoding-free\
    \ operation).  Both phones use a GSM codec, but the\n      speech is converted\
    \ from GSM to PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) by the\n      originating MSC (Mobile\
    \ Switching Center) and from PCM back to GSM\n      by the terminating MSC.\n\
    \   Note that transcoding services can be symmetric (e.g., speech-to-text\n  \
    \ plus text-to-speech) or asymmetric (e.g., a one-way speech-to-text\n   transcoding\
    \ for a hearing-impaired user that can talk).\n"
- title: 3.  Transcoding Services Invocation
  contents:
  - "3.  Transcoding Services Invocation\n   Once the need for transcoding for a particular\
    \ session has been\n   identified as described in Section 2, one of the user agents\
    \ needs to\n   invoke transcoding services.\n   As stated earlier, transcoder\
    \ location is outside the scope of this\n   document.  So, we assume that the\
    \ user agent invoking transcoding\n   services knows the URI of a server that\
    \ provides them.\n   Invoking transcoding services from a server (T) for a session\
    \ between\n   two user agents (A and B) involves establishing two media sessions;\n\
    \   one between A and T and another between T and B.  How to invoke T's\n   services\
    \ (i.e., how to establish both A-T and T-B sessions) depends\n   on how we model\
    \ the transcoding service.  We have considered two\n   models for invoking a transcoding\
    \ service.  The first is to use\n   third-party call control [RFC3725], also referred\
    \ to as 3pcc.  The\n   second is to use a (dial-in and dial-out) conference bridge\
    \ that\n   negotiates the appropriate media parameters on each individual leg\n\
    \   (i.e., A-T and T-B).\n   Section 3.1 analyzes the applicability of the third-party\
    \ call\n   control model, and Section 3.2 analyzes the applicability of the\n\
    \   conference bridge transcoding invocation model.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Third-Party Call Control Transcoding Model\n   In the 3pcc transcoding\
    \ model, defined in [RFC4117], the user agent\n   invoking the transcoding service\
    \ has a signalling relationship with\n   the transcoder and another signalling\
    \ relationship with the remote\n   user agent.  There is no signalling relationship\
    \ between the\n   transcoder and the remote user agent, as shown in Figure 1.\n\

    \ Model\n   This model is suitable for advanced endpoints that are able to\n \
    \  perform third party call control.  It allows endpoints to invoke\n   transcoding\
    \ services on a stream basis.  That is, the media streams\n   that need transcoding\
    \ are routed through the transcoder while the\n   streams that do not need it\
    \ are sent directly between the endpoints.\n   This model also allows invoking\
    \ one transcoder for the sending\n   direction and a different one for the receiving\
    \ direction of the same\n   stream.\n   Invoking a transcoder in the middle of\
    \ an ongoing session is also\n   quite simple.  This is useful when session changes\
    \ occur (e.g., an\n   audio session is upgraded to an audio/video session) and\
    \ the\n   endpoints cannot cope with the changes (e.g., they had common audio\n\
    \   codecs but no common video codecs).\n   The privacy level that is achieved\
    \ using 3pcc is high, since the\n   transcoder does not see the signalling between\
    \ both endpoints.  In\n   this model, the transcoder only has access to the information\
    \ that is\n   strictly needed to perform its function.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Conference Bridge Transcoding Model
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Conference Bridge Transcoding Model\n   In a centralized conference, there\
    \ are a number of media streams\n   between the conference server and each participant\
    \ of a conference.\n   For a given media type (e.g., audio) the conference server\
    \ sends,\n   over each individual stream, the media received over the rest of\
    \ the\n   streams, typically performing some mixing.  If the capabilities of\n\
    \   all the endpoints participating in the conference are not the same,\n   the\
    \ conference server may have to send audio to different\n   participants using\
    \ different audio codecs.\n   Consequently, we can model a transcoding service\
    \ as a two-party\n   conference server that may change not only the codec in use,\
    \ but also\n   the format of the media (e.g., audio to text).\n   Using this model,\
    \ T behaves as a B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) and\n   the whole A-T-B session\
    \ is established as described in [RFC5370].\n   Figure 2 shows the signalling\

    \  In the conferencing bridge model, the endpoint invoking the\n   transcoder\
    \ is generally involved in less signalling exchanges than in\n   the 3pcc model.\
    \  This may be an important feature for endpoints using\n   low-bandwidth or high-delay\
    \ access links (e.g., some wireless\n   accesses).\n   On the other hand, this\
    \ model is less flexible than the 3pcc model.\n   It is not possible to use different\
    \ transcoders for different streams\n   or for different directions of a stream.\n\
    \   Invoking a transcoder in the middle of an ongoing session or changing\n  \
    \ from one transcoder to another requires the remote endpoint to\n   support the\
    \ Replaces [RFC3891] extension.  At present, not many user\n   agents support\
    \ it.\n   Simple endpoints that cannot perform 3pcc and thus cannot use the\n\
    \   3pcc model, of course, need to use the conference bridge model.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The specifications of the 3pcc and the conferencing\
    \ transcoding\n   models discuss security issues directly related to the implementation\n\
    \   of those models.  Additionally, there are some considerations that\n   apply\
    \ to transcoding in general.\n   In a session, a transcoder has access to at least\
    \ some of the media\n   exchanged between the endpoints.  In order to avoid rogue\
    \ transcoders\n   getting access to those media, it is recommended that endpoints\n\
    \   authenticate the transcoder.  TLS [RFC5246] and S/MIME [RFC3850] can\n   be\
    \ used for this purpose.\n   To achieve a higher degree of privacy, endpoints\
    \ following the 3pcc\n   transcoding model can use one transcoder in one direction\
    \ and a\n   different one in the other direction.  This way, no single transcoder\n\
    \   has access to all the media exchanged between the endpoints.\n   The fact\
    \ that transcoders need to access media exchanged between the\n   endpoints implies\
    \ that endpoints cannot use end-to-end media security\n   mechanisms.  Media encryption\
    \ would not allow the transcoder to\n   access the media, and media integrity\
    \ protection would not allow the\n   transcoder to modify the media (which is\
    \ obviously necessary to\n   perform the transcoding function).  Nevertheless,\
    \ endpoints can still\n   use media security between the transcoder and themselves.\n"
