  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is used to interconnect systems\n\
    \   across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it appear\n   that\
    \ they are on a private LAN.  The systems that are interconnected\n   may themselves\
    \ be LAN switches.  If, however, they are IP hosts or IP\n   routers, certain\
    \ simplifications to the operation of the VPLS are\n   possible.  We call this\
    \ simplified type of VPLS an \"IP-only LAN\n   Service\" (IPLS).  In an IPLS,\
    \ as in a VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in\n   promiscuous mode, and frames are\
    \ forwarded based on their destination\n   Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.\
    \  However, the maintenance of\n   the MAC forwarding tables is done via signaling,\
    \ rather than via the\n   MAC address learning procedures specified in the IEEE's\
    \ \"Media Access\n   Control (MAC) Bridges\".  This document specifies the protocol\n\
    \   extensions and procedures for support of the IPLS service.\n   The original\
    \ intent was to provide an alternate solution to VPLS for\n   those Provider Edge\
    \ (PE) routers that were not capable of learning\n   MAC addresses through data\
    \ plane.  This became a non-issue with newer\n   hardware.  The concepts put forth\
    \ by this document are still valuable\n   and are adopted in one form or other\
    \ by newer work such as Ethernet\n   VPN in L2VPN working group and possible data\
    \ center applications.  At\n   this point, no further action is planned to update\
    \ this document and\n   it is published simply as a historic record of the ideas.\n"

- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   As emphasized in [RFC4762], Ethernet has become popular as an\
    \ access\n   technology in metropolitan- and wide-area networks.  [RFC4762]\n\
    \   describes how geographically dispersed customer LANs can be\n   interconnected\
    \ over a service provider's network.  The VPLS service\n   is provided by Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) devices that connect Customer Edge\n   (CE) devices.  The VPLS architecture\
    \ provides this service by\n   incorporating bridging functions such as MAC address\
    \ learning in the\n   PE devices.\n   PE platforms are designed primarily to be\
    \ IP routers rather than LAN\n   switches.  To add VPLS capability to a PE router,\
    \ one has to add MAC-\n   address-learning capabilities, along with aging and\
    \ other mechanisms\n   native to Ethernet switches [IEEE802.1D].  This may be\
    \ fairly complex\n   to add to the forwarding-plane architecture of an IP router.\
    \  As\n   discussed in [RFC4664], in scenarios where the CE devices are NOT LAN\n\
    \   switches, but rather are IP hosts or IP routers, it is possible to\n   provide\
    \ the VPLS service without requiring MAC address learning and\n   aging on the\
    \ PE.  Instead, a PE router has to have the capability to\n   match the destination\
    \ MAC address in a packet received from a CE to\n   an outbound pseudowire (PW).\
    \  The requirements for the IPLS service\n   are described in [RFC4665].  The\
    \ purpose of this document is to\n   specify a solution optimized for IPLS.\n\
    \   IPLS provides a VPLS-like service using PE routers that are not\n   designed\
    \ to perform general LAN bridging functions.  One must be\n   willing to accept\
    \ the restriction that an IPLS be used for IP traffic\n   only, and not used to\
    \ interconnect CE devices that are themselves LAN\n   switches.  This is an acceptable\
    \ restriction in many environments,\n   given that IP is the predominant type\
    \ of traffic in today's networks.\n   The original intent was to provide an alternate\
    \ solution to VPLS for\n   those PE routers that were not capable of learning\
    \ MAC addresses in\n   the data plane.  This became a non-issue with newer hardware.\
    \  The\n   concepts put forth by this document are still valuable and are\n  \
    \ adopted in one form or other by newer work such as Ethernet VPN in\n   the L2VPN\
    \ working group and possible data center applications.  At\n   this point, no\
    \ further action is planned to update this document and\n   is published simply\
    \ as a historic record of the ideas.\n   In IPLS, a PE device implements multipoint\
    \ LAN connectivity for IP\n   traffic using the following key functions:\n   \
    \   1. CE Address Discovery: Each PE device discovers the MAC address\n      \
    \   of the locally attached CE IP devices, for each IPLS instance\n         configured\
    \ on the PE device.  In some configurations, the PE\n         also learns the\
    \ IP address of the CE device (when performing\n         ARP proxy functions,\
    \ described later in the document).\n      2. Pseudowire (PW) for Unicast Traffic:\
    \ For each locally attached\n         CE device in a given IPLS instance, a PE\
    \ device sets up a\n         pseudowire (PW) to each of the other PEs that supports\
    \ the same\n         IPLS instance.\n         For instance, if PEx and PEy both\
    \ support IPLS I, and PEy is\n         locally attached to CEa and CEb, PEy will\
    \ initiate the setup of\n         two PWs between itself and PEx.  One of these\
    \ will be used to\n         carry unicast traffic from any of PEx's CE devices\
    \ to CEa.  The\n         other will be used to carry unicast traffic from any\
    \ of PEx's\n         CE devices to CEb.\n         Note that these PWs carry traffic\
    \ only in one direction.\n         Further, while the PW implicitly identifies\
    \ the destination CE\n         of the traffic, it does not identify the source\
    \ CE; packets\n         from different source CEs bound to the same destination\
    \ CE are\n         sent on a single PW.\n      3. Pseudowires for Multicast Traffic:\
    \  In addition, every PE\n         supporting a given IPLS instance will set up\
    \ a special\n         'multicast' pseudowire to every other PE in that IPLS instance.\n\
    \         If, in the above example, one of PEx's CE devices sends a\n        \
    \ multicast packet, PEx would forward the multicast packet to PEy\n         on\
    \ the special 'multicast' pseudowire.  PEy would then send a\n         copy of\
    \ that packet to CEa and a copy to CEb.\n         The 'multicast' pseudowire carries\
    \ Ethernet frames of\n         multicast/broadcast IP, ARP, and ICMP (Inverse)\
    \ Neighbor\n         Discovery (ND/IND) packets for IPv6.  Thus, when a PE sends\
    \ a\n         multicast packet across the network, it sends one copy to each\n\
    \         remote PE (supporting the given IPLS instance).  If a\n         particular\
    \ remote PE has more than one CE device in that IPLS\n         instance, the remote\
    \ PE must replicate the packet and send one\n         copy to each of its local\
    \ CEs.\n         As with the pseudowires that are used for unicast traffic,\n\
    \         packets travel in only one direction on these pseudowires, and\n   \
    \      packets from different sources may be freely intermixed.\n      4. Signaling:\
    \  The necessary pseudowires can be set up and\n         maintained using the\
    \ signaling procedures based on the Label\n         Distribution Protocol (LDP)\
    \ described in [RFC4447].\n         A PE may assign the same label to each of\
    \ the unicast\n         pseudowires that lead to a given CE device, in effect\
    \ creating\n         a multipoint-to-point pseudowire.\n         Similarly, a\
    \ PE may assign the same label to each of the\n         'multicast' pseudowires\
    \ for a given IPLS instance, in effect\n         creating a multipoint-to-point\
    \ pseudowire.  When setting up a\n         pseudowire to be used for unicast traffic,\
    \ the PE must also\n         signal the MAC address of the corresponding CE device.\
    \  It\n         should also, optionally, advertise the IP address of the local\n\
    \         CE device, especially when ARP proxy function is configured or\n   \
    \      simply for operational management purposes.  Similarly, for\n         IPv6\
    \ support, PE may optionally advertise the IPv6 addresses of\n         the local\
    \ CE device.\n      5. ARP Packet Forwarding: ARP packets [RFC826] are forwarded\
    \ from\n         the attachment circuit (AC) to 'multicast' pseudowires in the\n\
    \         Ethernet frame format as described by [RFC4448].  The following\n  \
    \       rules are observed when processing ARP packets:\n         a. Both broadcast\
    \ (request) and unicast (response) ARP packets\n            are sent over the\
    \ 'multicast' pseudowire.\n         b. When an ARP packet is received from an\
    \ AC, the packet is\n            copied to the control plane for the purpose of\
    \ learning the\n            MAC address of the CE.  Optionally, an IP address\
    \ is also\n            learned to record the association of the IP and MAC address.\n\
    \         c. All Ethernet packets, including ARP packets, received from\n    \
    \        the 'multicast' pseudowire are forwarded out to all the ACs\n       \
    \     associated with the IPLS instance.  These packets are not\n            copied\
    \ to the control plane.\n      6. ICMP IPv6 ND/IND-related Packet Forwarding:\
    \ ND/IND IPv6 packets\n         from an AC are replicated and a copy is sent to\
    \ other ACs and\n         to 'multicast' PWs associated with the IPLS instance\
    \ in the\n         native Ethernet format, unchanged.  A copy is also submitted\
    \ to\n         the control plane to learn the MAC address and, optionally,\n \
    \        corresponding IPv6 addresses.\n      7. Multicast IP packet forwarding:\
    \ An IP Ethernet frame received\n         from an AC is replicated to other ACs\
    \ and the 'multicast' PWs\n         associated with the IPLS instance.  An IP\
    \ Ethernet frame\n         received from a 'multicast' PW is replicated to all\
    \ the egress\n         ACs associated with the IPLS instance.\n      8. Unicast\
    \ IP packet forwarding: An IP packet received from the AC\n         is forwarded\
    \ based on the destination MAC address lookup in the\n         forwarding table.\
    \  If a match is found, the packet is forwarded\n         to the associated egress\
    \ interface.  If the egress interface is\n         unicast PW, the packet is sent\
    \ without a MAC header.  If the\n         egress interface is a local AC, the\
    \ Ethernet frame is forwarded\n         as such.  An IP packet received from the\
    \ unicast PW is\n         forwarded to the egress AC with the MAC header prepended.\
    \  The\n         destination MAC address is derived from the forwarding table\n\
    \         while the source MAC address is the MAC address of the PE.\n   Both\
    \ VPLS [RFC4762] and IPLS require the ingress PE to forward a\n   frame based\
    \ on its destination MAC address.  However, two key\n   differences between VPLS\
    \ and IPLS can be noted from the above\n   description:\n   -  In VPLS, MAC entries\
    \ are placed in the Forwarding Information Base\n      (FIB) of the ingress PE\
    \ as a result of MAC address learning (which\n      occurs in the data plane);\
    \ whereas, in IPLS, MAC entries are\n      placed in the FIB as a result of PW\
    \ signaling operations (control\n      plane).\n   -  In VPLS, the egress PE looks\
    \ up a frame's destination MAC address\n      to determine the egress AC; in IPLS,\
    \ the egress AC is determined\n      entirely by the ingress PW label.\n   The\
    \ following sections describe the details of the IPLS scheme.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  VPLS vs. IPLS\n   The VPLS approach proposed in [RFC4762] provides VPN services\
    \ for IP\n   as well as other protocols.  The IPLS approach described in this\n\
    \   document is similar to VPLS in many respects:\n      -  It provides a Provider-Provisioned\
    \ Virtual LAN service with\n         multipoint capability where a CE connected\
    \ via a single\n         attachment circuit can reach many remote CEs\n      -\
    \  It appears as a broadcast domain and a single subnet\n      -  Forwarding is\
    \ based on destination MAC addresses\n   However, unlike VPLS, IPLS is restricted\
    \ to IP traffic only.  By\n   restricting the scope of the service to the predominant\
    \ type of\n   traffic in today's environment, IPLS eliminates the need for service\n\
    \   provider edge routers to implement some bridging functions such as\n   MAC\
    \ address learning in the data path (by, instead, distributing MAC\n   information\
    \ in the control plane).  Thus, this solution offers a\n   number of benefits:\n\
    \      -  It facilitates Virtual LAN services in instances where PE\n        \
    \ devices cannot or cannot efficiently (or are specifically\n         configured\
    \ not to) perform MAC address learning.\n      -  Unknown Unicast frames are never\
    \ flooded as would be the case\n         in VPLS.\n      -  Encapsulation is more\
    \ efficient (the MAC header is stripped)\n         for unicast IP packets while\
    \ traversing the backbone network.\n      -  PE devices are not burdened with\
    \ the processing overhead\n         associated with traditional bridging (e.g.,\
    \ Spanning Tree\n         Protocol (STP) processing, etc.).  Note, however, that\
    \ some of\n         these overheads (e.g., STP processing) could optionally be\n\
    \         turned off with a VPLS solution in the case where it is known\n    \
    \     that only IP devices are interconnected.\n      -  Loops (perhaps through\
    \ backdoor links) are minimized since a PE\n         could easily reject (via\

    \ addresses are candidate for ARP request generation.\n   The ARP Proxy Generator\
    \ feature is required to support back-to-back\n   IPLS configuration when any\
    \ member of the IPLS instance is using the\n   ARP Proxy Responder function. \
    \ An example of a back-to-back IPLS is a\n   configuration where PE-1 (ASBR) in\
    \ an IPLS cloud in one Autonomous\n   System (say, AS-1) is connected via an AC\
    \ to another PE-2 (ASBR) in\n   an IPLS cloud in another Autonomous System (say,\
    \ AS- 2) where each PE\n   appears as CE to each other.  Such configuration is\
    \ described in\n   [RFC4364] as option-A for inter-AS connectivity.  The Proxy\
    \ ARP\n   Responder feature prevents propagation of ARP requests to PE-1 (ASBR)\n\
    \   in AS-1.  This necessitates that PE-1 (ASBR) in AS-1 generates an ARP\n  \
    \ request on behalf of each CE connected to the IPLS instance in AS-1\n   as a\
    \ mean to 'advertise' the reachability to IPLS cloud in AS-2.\n"
- title: 14.  Data Center Applicability
  contents:
  - "14.  Data Center Applicability\n   The resurgence of interest in providing an\
    \ IP/MPLS-based solution for\n   Data Center Networks (DCNs) deserves another\
    \ look at the IPLS\n   methodologies described in this document.  The key requirement\
    \ of a\n   DCN to permit Virtual Machine (VM) mobility within or across a DCN\n\
    \   necessitates extending the reachability of IP subnet over a LAN,\n   transparently.\
    \  In addition, VMs tendency to generate frequent\n   gratuitous ARPs for location\
    \ discovery necessitates a solution that\n   curbs broadcasts closest to the source.\n\
    \   The IPLS solution facilitates VM mobility by the PE closest to the\n   new\
    \ location signaling the MAC address to all remote peers.  In\n   addition, control-plane-based\
    \ MAC learning mechanisms prevent\n   flooding of unknown unicast across a DCN.\
    \  The optional ARP proxy\n   mechanisms further reduce ARP broadcast floods by\
    \ preventing its\n   reach across a local PE.\n"
- title: 15.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "15.  Security Considerations\n   A more comprehensive description of the security\
    \ issues involved in\n   L2VPNs are covered in [RFC4111].  Most of the security\
    \ issues can be\n   avoided through implementation of appropriate guards.  The\
    \ security\n   aspect of this solution is addressed for two planes: the control\n\
    \   plane and data plane.\n"
- title: 15.1.  Control-Plane Security
  contents:
  - "15.1.  Control-Plane Security\n   The control-plane security pertains to establishing\
    \ the LDP\n   connection, PW establishment and CE's IP and MAC address\n   distribution.\
    \  The LDP connection between two trusted PEs can be\n   achieved by each PE verifying\
    \ the incoming connection against the\n   configured peer's address and authenticating\
    \ the LDP messages by\n   verifying keyed digests.  The PW establishments between\
    \ two secure\n   LDP peers do not pose security issue but mis-wiring could occur\
    \ due\n   to configuration error.  Some checks, such as, proper PW type and\n\
    \   other PW options may prevent mis-wiring due to configuration errors.\n   The\
    \ learning of the appropriate CE's IP and MAC address can be a\n   security issue.\
    \  It is expected that the local attachment circuit to\n   CE be physically secured.\
    \  If this is a concern, the PE must be\n   configured with the CE's IP and MAC\
    \ address.  During each ARP frame\n   processing, the PE must verify the received\
    \ information against the\n   configuration before accepting.  This prevents theft\
    \ of service,\n   denial of service to a subscriber, or DoS attacks to all subscribers\n\
    \   by malicious use of network services.\n   The IPLS also provides MAC anti-spoofing\
    \ by preventing the use of\n   already known MAC address.  For instance, if a\
    \ PE has already learned\n   a presence of a CE through a local connection or\
    \ from another PE, and\n   subsequently an advertisement for the same MAC and/or\
    \ IP address is\n   received from a different PE, the receiving PE can terminate\
    \ service\n   to that CE (either through label release and/or removing the ARP\n\
    \   entry from the FIB) and raise the alarm.\n   The IPLS learns and distributes\
    \ CE reachability through the control\n   plane.  This provides greater control\
    \ over CE topology distribution\n   through the application of local policies.\n"
- title: 15.2.  Data-Plane Security
  contents:
  - "15.2.  Data-Plane Security\n   The data traffic between the CE and PE is not\
    \ encrypted.  In an\n   insecure environment, it is possible that a malicious\
    \ user may tap\n   into the CE-to-PE connection and could conduct an active or\
    \ passive\n   attack.  An example of an active attack would be generating traffic\n\
    \   using the spoofed destination MAC address on the Ethernet Attachment\n   Circuit\
    \ and a passive attack could include targeted or passive\n   monitoring between\
    \ the CE and PE.  In order to avoid such hijacking,\n   the local PE may verify\
    \ the source MAC address of the received frame\n   against the MAC address of\
    \ the admitted connection.  The frame is\n   forwarded to the PW only when authenticity\
    \ is verified.  When\n   spoofing is detected, the PE must sever the connection\
    \ with the local\n   CE, tear down the PW, and start over.\n   Each IPLS instance\
    \ uses its own FIB.  This prevents leaking of one\n   customer data into another.\n"
