  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This memo reviews and expands on the mail service transition\
    \ plan\n   [20].\n   The principal aim of the plan is to provide for the orderly\
    \ support\n   of the most commonly used network service (mail) during the period\
    \ of\n   transition from ARPANET to Internet Protocol-based operation.\n   The\
    \ goal of the transition is, at the end, to provide in the internet\n   environment\
    \ service which is equivalent to or better than what has\n   been available in\
    \ the ARPANET environment.  During the interim\n   period, when both internet\
    \ and the older ARPANET-based protocols are\n   in use, the goal of the transition\
    \ is to minimize user impact and, to\n   the extent possible, to minimize software\
    \ development or modification\n   required to deal with transitional problems.\n\
    \   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both the ARPANET and\n   internet\
    \ protocol hierarchies [1-17].  The internet hierarchy is\n   designed to interface\
    \ to many different packet networks (e.g., packet\n   satellite, packet radio,\
    \ Ethernet, LCS Ring net, X.25 public\n   nets, ...), while the ARPANET hierarchy\
    \ is limited to ARPANET IMPs\n   (This is less true of the levels above NCP, but\
    \ NCP itself is closely\n   bound to ARPANET services).\n   The objective of the\
    \ transition plan is to specify means by which the\n   ARPANET electronic mail\
    \ services may be supported across the boundary\n   between the purely ARPANET\
    \ environment and the more general internet\n   environment during the period\
    \ of transition by ARPANET hosts to the\n   richer internet world.\n"

    \ make several transitions over the next few years, from the\n   existing, text-based\
    \ ARPANET electronic message system to an\n   internet-based, multimedia electronic\
    \ message system.\n   This paper addresses only the first of the transitions from\
    \ NCP-based\n   text mail to TCP-based multimedia mail.  The transition to the\
    \ new\n   multimedia mail system [7,19] lies ahead, but need not be planned in\n\
    \   detail until we have some experience with the basic concepts.  This\n   first\
    \ step only provides for the transition to TCP-based text mail.\n   The basic\
    \ ground rules for transition from ARPANET-based electronic\n   mail to internet\
    \ electronic mail are the following:\n      1.  ARPANET mailbox names must continue\
    \ to work correctly.\n      2.  No change required to mail editors which parse\
    \ message headers\n          to compose replies and the like.\n      3.  Accommodation\
    \ of non-ARPANET mailbox designators without\n          change to the header parsing\
    \ and checking mechanisms of mail\n          composition programs.\n      4. \

    \ the latter achieves this by actual file transfer.  In both\n   cases, it is\
    \ generally assumed that the receiving FTP server is\n   colocated with the destination\
    \ mailbox.\n   Thus, the sending procedure identifies to the receiver the\n  \
    \ destination mailbox identifier, but not the destination host (or\n   network)\
    \ identifier.  For example, messages sent from Postel at\n   USC-ISIF to Adams\
    \ at USC-ISIA would arrive at ISIA with an indicator\n   \"Adams\" but no indication\
    \ of \"ISIA\".  This creates some problems when\n   messages must be staged at\
    \ an intermediate host for further\n   processing, as is the case when moving\
    \ from an NCP-based sender to a\n   TCP-based receiver, or vice-versa.  Similar\
    \ considerations arise when\n   dealing with compatible, but different, message\
    \ systems requiring\n   re-formatting of messages at intermediate points.\n  \
    \ In the following paragraphs, a mechanism is proposed for dealing with\n   the\
    \ naming, addressing and routing [18] of messages between systems.\n   At the\
    \ source, it is assumed that the user has prepared the text of\n   the message\
    \ (including \"To:\" and \"CC:\" fields) in the conventional\n   way [12].  The\
    \ mailbox identifiers will continue to exhibit the\n   format:\n      User@Host\n\
    \   but \"host\" may in fact be a compound name (which is not necessarily\n  \
    \ parsed), such as:\n      USC-ISIA\n      ARPANET-ISIA\n      SATNET-NDRE\n \
    \     PPSN-RSRE\n      HOST1.SRINET\n      LCSNET/MAILROOM\n   or even the name\
    \ of an organization, such as:\n      BBN\n      ARPA\n      MIT\n      SRI\n\
    \   The only restriction is that the \"@\" not appear in either \"user\" or\n\
    \   \"host\" strings in the mailbox identifier.\n   During message composition,\

- title: NEW MAIL MECHANISMS
  contents:
  - "NEW MAIL MECHANISMS\n   At this point, we encounter the first critical new requirement\
    \ to\n   support the transition plan.  A new table is needed within the mailer\n\
    \   or in the host supporting the mailer or accessible to the mailer via\n   the\
    \ internet name server (for instance).  This table must provide for\n   mapping\
    \ of the \"host\" string into an internet destination address\n   (i.e., 32 bits:\
    \ 8 bits of net, 24 bits of host), and must also\n   indicate whether the destination\
    \ is NCP or TCP capable.\n   In the event that the source and destination hosts\
    \ do not have a\n   compatible host level protocol (e.g. source is NCP only, destination\n\
    \   is TCP only) then the message must be passed to a \"forwarder\" which\n  \
    \ can stage the transport by accepting via one protocol and forwarding\n   by\
    \ another.\n   This leads to a problem for the forwarding host since the basic\
    \ FTP\n   mail mechanism sends only the \"user\" portion of the mailbox\n   identifier\
    \ (\"user@host\") because the assumption is that the \"host\" is\n   the destination.\
    \  In the case of forwarding, the \"host\" is not the\n   forwarder.  Even if\
    \ we cleverly arrange for \"host\" to translate into\n   the internet address\
    \ of a forwarder, we will have two problems.\n   First, the forwarder may need\
    \ the \"host\" information to figure where\n   now to forward the message and\
    \ second, depending on which network the\n   source is in, \"host\" may need to\
    \ translate into different forwarder\n   addresses.  The latter observation raises\
    \ the spectre of many\n   different mappings of a given \"host\" string which\
    \ would require\n   different tables for different mail sources.  This would lead\
    \ to\n   considerable complexity in the maintenance and distribution of tables\n\
    \   of forwarder addresses.  Furthermore, a single-entry table mapping\n   \"\
    host\" to forwarder would limit reliability since only one forwarder\n   would\
    \ be bound to serve a giver \"host\".\n"

    \                  Comments on NCP/TCP Mail Service Transition Strategy\n   For\
    \ the NCP/TCP transition, it may be sufficient to declare some set\n   of well-known\
    \ hosts to be NCP/TCP forwarders.  Each mailer, when it\n   discovers an incompatible\
    \ destination, can send the message to any\n   forwarder which is available. \
    \ In addition, however, the mailer must\n   provide full mailbox identifier information\
    \ \"user@host\" to the\n   forwarding host.\n   In the present mailers, only the\
    \ \"user\" portion of the mailbox\n   identifier is sent, so all mailers must\
    \ change to send \"user@host\"\n   when sending to a forwarder.  The mailers all\
    \ have to learn how to do\n   table look-up a new way, also, to map \"host\" into\
    \ internet addresses\n   and to interpret the NCP or TCP capability information.\n\
    \   For purposes of this discussion, we postulate three different cases\n   of\
    \ electronic mail service implementation which must be made to\n   interoperate\
    \ during the transition:\n      1.  Unchanged OLD NCP (RFC733) mail\n      2.\
    \  NCP mail with new internet tables\n      3.  TCP mail with new internet tables.\n\
    \   The second case assumes that the host has adopted a new host-string\n   to\
    \ address table (including NCP/TCP capability bits) and new mailer -\n   mail\
    \ server programs, but continues to use the old NCP host level\n   protocol, modified\
    \ to send \"user@host\" when sending to a forwarder.\n   For such hosts, the only\
    \ table entries which result in direct\n   source-destination mail delivery are\
    \ those showing NCP capability.\n   If the destination is TCP capable only then\
    \ the source host selects a\n   forwarder address from another table and sends\
    \ the message to it for\n   further processing.\n   In the third case, the source\
    \ host has fully transitioned to TCP,\n   uses the new internet address tables\
    \ to translate host-strings into\n   internet addresses, and uses the new mailer\
    \ - mail server.\n   Destinations which are NCP-compatible only are reached via\
    \ NCP/TCP\n   forwarders.\n   Mail composition programs (e.g. SNDMSG, MSG, Hermes,\
    \ MH,...) which\n   today use ARPANET string-to-address tables to verify the legality\
    \ of\n   host names in mailbox entries can continue to use these \"old\" tables\n\
    \   as long as these are updated to include internet host names as well\n   as\
    \ ARPANET host names.\n   Indeed, expanding the old tables is essential to handle\

  - "IMPLICIT FORWARDING VS EXPLICIT FORWARDING\n   If the source host has adopted\
    \ the new internet tables, it can tell\n   whether the destination host has a\
    \ compatible mail acceptance\n   protocol.  Incompatibility is explicitly resolved\
    \ by selection of an\n   intermediate forwarder.\n   If, however, the source host\
    \ is still using pure NCP tables, it will\n   not be able to tell that a particular\
    \ destination host is only\n   TCP-capable.  To provide service for this case,\
    \ it is proposed to\n   expand the conventional NCP host table to include internet\
    \ host\n   names, but to map them into the addresses of implicit mail forwarders\n\
    \   (i.e. Aliases).\n   Since we are postulating a case in which the NCP host\
    \ has made no\n   change (except for extending the host table). we also assume\
    \ that the\n   source host cannot send the \"user@host\" information via FTP to\
    \ the\n   intermediate forwarder.\n   This leaves the intermediate forwarder with\
    \ the problem of figuring\n   out where to forward a message identified by \"\

    \ are registered at\n   implicit forwarders so that incoming mail from conventional\
    \ NCP\n   sources can be forwarded successfully to the destination.\n   In the\
    \ reverse direction, the source can use explicit forwarding\n   because it is\
    \ assumed that all TCP hosts use the new internet tables.\n   The use of registered\
    \ names in the implicit forwarder raises two\n   problems:\n      1.  How can\
    \ we deal with ambiguous mailbox names?  (e.g. USERX@BBN\n          and USERX@ISI\
    \ look the same if only the string \"USERX\" is\n          presented to the intermediate\
    \ forwarder)\n      2.  How can we collect, update and distribute changes to the\n\
