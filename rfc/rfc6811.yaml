  - "1.  Introduction\n   A BGP route associates an address prefix with a set of Autonomous\n\
    \   Systems (ASes) that identify the interdomain path the prefix has\n   traversed\
    \ in the form of BGP announcements.  This set is represented\n   as the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute in BGP [RFC4271] and starts with the AS that\n   originated the prefix.\
    \  To help reduce well-known threats against BGP\n   including prefix mis-announcing\
    \ and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one\n   of the security requirements is the\
    \ ability to validate the\n   origination AS of BGP routes.  More specifically,\
    \ one needs to\n   validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address\
    \ prefix\n   (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact\n\
    \   authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a\n   simple\
    \ validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.\n   The Resource\
    \ Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) describes an approach\n   to build a formally\
    \ verifiable database of IP addresses and AS\n   numbers as resources.  The overall\
    \ architecture of RPKI as defined in\n   [RFC6480] consists of three main components:\n\
    \   o  a public key infrastructure (PKI) with the necessary certificate\n    \
    \  objects,\n   o  digitally signed routing objects, and\n   o  a distributed\
    \ repository system to hold the objects that would\n      also support periodic\
    \ retrieval.\n   The RPKI system is based on resource certificates that define\n\
    \   extensions to X.509 to represent IP addresses and AS identifiers\n   [RFC3779],\
    \ thus the name RPKI.  Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)\n   [RFC6482] are separate\
    \ digitally signed objects that define\n   associations between ASes and IP address\
    \ blocks.  Finally, the\n   repository system is operated in a distributed fashion\
    \ through the\n   IANA, Regional Internet Registry (RIR) hierarchy, and ISPs.\n\
    \   In order to benefit from the RPKI system, it is envisioned that\n   relying\
    \ parties at either the AS or organization level obtain a local\n   copy of the\
    \ signed object collection, verify the signatures, and\n   process them.  The\
    \ cache must also be refreshed periodically.  The\n   exact access mechanism used\
    \ to retrieve the local cache is beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n   Individual\
    \ BGP speakers can utilize the processed data contained in\n   the local cache\
    \ to validate BGP announcements.  The protocol details\n   to retrieve the processed\
    \ data from the local cache to the BGP\n   speakers is beyond the scope of this\
    \ document (refer to [RFC6810] for\n   such a mechanism).  This document proposes\
    \ a means by which a BGP\n   speaker can make use of the processed data in order\
    \ to assign a\n   \"validation state\" to each prefix in a received BGP UPDATE\
    \ message.\n   Note that the complete path attestation against the AS_PATH attribute\n\
    \   of a route is outside the scope of this document.\n   Like the DNS, the global\
    \ RPKI presents only a loosely consistent\n   view, depending on timing, updating,\
    \ fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache\n   or router may have different data about\
    \ a particular prefix than\n   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for\
    \ this; it is the\n   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.\n  \
    \ Although RPKI provides the context for this document, it is equally\n   possible\
    \ to use any other database that is able to map prefixes to\n   their authorized\
    \ origin ASes.  Each distinct database will have its\n   own particular operational\
    \ and security characteristics; such\n   characteristics are beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to\n   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]\
    \ only when they\n   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower\
    \ or mixed\n   case as English words, without special meaning.\n"
- title: 2.  Prefix-to-AS Mapping Database
  contents:
  - "2.  Prefix-to-AS Mapping Database\n   The BGP speaker loads validated objects\
    \ from the cache into local\n   storage.  The objects loaded have the content\
    \ (IP address, prefix\n   length, maximum length, origin AS number).  We refer\
    \ to such a\n   locally stored object as a \"Validated ROA Payload\" or \"VRP\"\
    .\n   We define several terms in addition to \"VRP\".  Where these terms are\n\
    \   used, they are capitalized:\n   o  Prefix: (IP address, prefix length), interpreted\
    \ as is customary\n      (see [RFC4632]).\n   o  Route: Data derived from a received\
    \ BGP UPDATE, as defined in\n      [RFC4271], Section 1.1.  The Route includes\
    \ one Prefix and an\n      AS_PATH; it may include other attributes to characterize\
    \ the\n      prefix.\n   o  VRP Prefix: The Prefix from a VRP.\n   o  VRP ASN:\
    \ The origin AS number from a VRP.\n   o  Route Prefix: The Prefix derived from\
    \ a route.\n   o  Route Origin ASN: The origin AS number derived from a Route\
    \ as\n      follows:\n      *  the rightmost AS in the final segment of the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute\n         in the Route if that segment is of type AS_SEQUENCE, or\n\
    \      *  the BGP speaker's own AS number if that segment is of type\n       \
    \  AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET or if the AS_PATH is empty,\n         or\n\
    \      *  the distinguished value \"NONE\" if the final segment of the\n     \
    \    AS_PATH attribute is of any other type.\n   o  Covered: A Route Prefix is\
    \ said to be Covered by a VRP when the\n      VRP prefix length is less than or\
    \ equal to the Route prefix\n      length, and the VRP prefix address and the\
    \ Route prefix address\n      are identical for all bits specified by the VRP\
    \ prefix length.\n      (That is, the Route prefix is either identical to the\
    \ VRP prefix\n      or more specific than the VRP prefix.)\n   o  Matched: A Route\
    \ Prefix is said to be Matched by a VRP when the\n      Route Prefix is Covered\
    \ by that VRP, the Route prefix length is\n      less than or equal to the VRP\
    \ maximum length, and the Route Origin\n      ASN is equal to the VRP ASN.\n \
    \  Given these definitions, any given BGP Route will be found to have\n   one\
    \ of the following validation states:\n   o  NotFound: No VRP Covers the Route\
    \ Prefix.\n   o  Valid: At least one VRP Matches the Route Prefix.\n   o  Invalid:\
    \ At least one VRP Covers the Route Prefix, but no VRP\n      Matches it.\n  \
    \ We observe that no VRP can have the value \"NONE\" as its VRP ASN.\n   Thus,\
    \ a Route whose Origin ASN is \"NONE\" cannot be Matched by any\n   VRP.  Similarly,\
    \ no valid Route can have an Origin ASN of zero [AS0].\n   Thus, no Route can\
    \ be Matched by a VRP whose ASN is zero.\n   When a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE\
    \ from a neighbor, it SHOULD\n   perform a lookup as described above for each\
    \ of the Routes in the\n   UPDATE message.  The lookup SHOULD also be applied\
    \ to routes that are\n   redistributed into BGP from another source, such as another\
    \ protocol\n   or a locally defined static route.  An implementation MAY provide\n\
    \   configuration options to control which routes the lookup is applied\n   to.\
    \  The validation state of the Route MUST be set to reflect the\n   result of\
    \ the lookup.  The implementation should consider the\n   validation state as\
    \ described in the document as a local property or\n   attribute of the Route.\
    \  If validation is not performed on a Route,\n   the implementation SHOULD initialize\
    \ the validation state of such a\n   route to \"NotFound\".\n   Use of the validation\
    \ state is discussed in Sections 3 and 5.  An\n   implementation MUST NOT exclude\
    \ a route from the Adj-RIB-In or from\n   consideration in the decision process\
    \ as a side effect of its\n   validation state, unless explicitly configured to\
    \ do so.\n   We observe that a Route can be Matched or Covered by more than one\n\
    \   VRP.  This procedure does not mandate an order in which VRPs must be\n   visited;\
    \ however, the validation state output is fully determined.\n"

    \ 5.  For more details on operational policy considerations,\n   see [ORIGIN-OPS].\n\
    \   An implementation MUST also support four-octet AS numbers [RFC6793].\n"
- title: 4.  Interaction with Local Cache
  contents:
  - "4.  Interaction with Local Cache\n   Each BGP speaker supporting prefix validation\
    \ as described in this\n   document is expected to communicate with one or more\
    \ RPKI caches,\n   each of which stores a local copy of the global RPKI database.\
    \  The\n   protocol mechanisms used to gather and validate these data and\n  \
    \ present them to BGP speakers are described in [RFC6810].\n   The prefix-to-AS\
    \ mappings used by the BGP speaker are expected to be\n   updated over time. \
    \ When a mapping is added or deleted, the\n   implementation MUST re-validate\
    \ any affected prefixes and run the BGP\n   decision process if needed.  An \"\
    affected prefix\" is any prefix that\n   was matched by a deleted or updated mapping,\
    \ or could be matched by\n   an added or updated mapping.\n"
- title: 5.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Deployment Considerations\n   Once a Route is selected for validation, it\
    \ is categorized according\n   the procedure given in Section 2.  Subsequently,\
    \ routing policy as\n   discussed in Section 3 can be used to take action based\
    \ on the\n   validation state.\n   Policies that could be implemented include\
    \ filtering routes based on\n   validation state (for example, rejecting all \"\
    invalid\" routes) or\n   adjusting a route's degree of preference in the selection\
    \ algorithm\n   based on its validation state.  The latter could be accomplished\
    \ by\n   adjusting the value of such attributes as LOCAL_PREF.  Considering\n\
    \   invalid routes for BGP decision process is a purely local policy\n   matter\
    \ and should be done with utmost care.\n   In some cases (particularly when the\
    \ selection algorithm is\n   influenced by the adjustment of a route property\
    \ that is not\n   propagated into Internal BGP (IBGP)) it could be necessary for\n\
    \   routing correctness to propagate the validation state to the IBGP\n   peer.\
    \  This can be accomplished on the sending side by setting a\n   community or\
    \ extended community based on the validation state, and on\n   the receiving side\
    \ by matching the (extended) community and setting\n   the validation state.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Although this specification discusses one portion\
    \ of a system to\n   validate BGP routes, it should be noted that it relies on\
    \ a database\n   (RPKI or other) to provide validation information.  As such,\
    \ the\n   security properties of that database must be considered in order to\n\
    \   determine the security provided by the overall solution.  If\n   \"invalid\"\
    \ routes are blocked as this specification suggests, the\n   overall system provides\
    \ a possible denial-of-service vector; for\n   example, if an attacker is able\
    \ to inject (or remove) one or more\n   records into (or from) the validation\
    \ database, it could lead an\n   otherwise valid route to be marked as invalid.\n\
    \   In addition, this system is only able to provide limited protection\n   against\
    \ a determined attacker -- the attacker need only prepend the\n   \"valid\" source\
    \ AS to a forged BGP route announcement in order to\n   defeat the protection\
    \ provided by this system.\n   This mechanism does not protect against \"AS-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks\" or\n   provide any path validation.  It only attempts to verify the\
    \ origin.\n   In general, this system should be thought of more as a protection\n\
    \   against misconfiguration than as true \"security\" in the strong sense.\n"
