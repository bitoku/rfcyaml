  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2865 [RFC2865] defines the NAS-Prompt (7) and Administrative
    (6)\n   values of the Service-Type (6) Attribute.  Both of these values\n   provide
    access to the interactive, text-based Command Line Interface\n   (CLI) of the
    NAS, and were originally developed to control access to\n   the physical console
    port of the NAS, most often a serial port.\n   Remote access to the CLI of the
    NAS has been available in NAS\n   implementations for many years, using protocols
    such as Telnet,\n   Rlogin, and the remote terminal service of the Secure SHell
    (SSH).\n   In order to distinguish local, physical, console access from remote\n
    \  access, the NAS-Port-Type (61) Attribute is generally included in\n   Access-Request
    and Access-Accept messages, along with the Service-\n   Type (6) Attribute, to
    indicate the form of access.  A NAS-Port-Type\n   (61) Attribute with a value
    of Async (0) is used to signify a local\n   serial port connection, while a value
    of Virtual (5) is used to\n   signify a remote connection, via a remote terminal
    protocol.  This\n   usage provides no selectivity among the various available
    remote\n   terminal protocols (e.g., Telnet, Rlogin, SSH, etc.).\n   Today, it
    is common for network devices to support more than the two\n   privilege levels
    for management access provided by the Service-Type\n   (6) Attribute with values
    of NAS-Prompt (7) (non-privileged) and\n   Administrative (6) (privileged).  Also,
    other management mechanisms\n   may be used, such as Web-based management, the
    Simple Network\n   Management Protocol (SNMP), and the Network Configuration Protocol\n
    \  (NETCONF).  To provide support for these additional features, this\n   specification
    defines attributes for Framed Management protocols,\n   management protocol security,
    and management access privilege levels.\n   Remote management via the command
    line is carried over protocols such\n   as Telnet, Rlogin, and the remote terminal
    service of SSH.  Since\n   these protocols are primarily for the delivery of terminal
    or\n   terminal emulation services, the term \"Framed Management\" is used to\n
    \  describe management protocols supporting techniques other than the\n   command
    line.  Typically, these mechanisms format management\n   information in a binary
    or textual encoding such as HTML, XML, or\n   ASN.1/BER.  Examples include Web-based
    management (HTML over HTTP or\n   HTTPS), NETCONF (XML over SSH or BEEP or SOAP),
    and SNMP (SMI over\n   ASN.1/BER).  Command line interface, menu interface, or
    other text-\n   based (e.g., ASCII or UTF-8) terminal emulation services are not\n
    \  considered to be Framed Management protocols.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865], RFC 2866\n   [RFC2866],
    and RFC 5176 [RFC5176].\n   The term \"integrity protection\", as used in this
    document, is *not*\n   the same as \"authentication\", as used in SNMP.  Integrity
    protection\n   requires the sharing of cryptographic keys, but it does not require\n
    \  authenticated principals.  Integrity protection could be used, for\n   example,
    with anonymous Diffie-Hellman key agreement.  In SNMP, the\n   proof of identity
    of the principals (authentication) is conflated\n   with tamper-resistance of
    the protected messages (integrity).  In\n   this document, we assume that integrity
    protection and authentication\n   are separate concerns.  Authentication is part
    of the base RADIUS\n   protocol.\n   SNMP uses the terms \"auth\" and \"noAuth\",
    as well as \"priv\" and\n   \"noPriv\".  There is no analog to auth or noAuth
    in this document.  In\n   this document, we are assuming that authentication always
    occurs when\n   it is required, i.e., as a prerequisite to provisioning of access
    via\n   an Access-Accept packet.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   To support the authorization and provisioning of Framed Management\n
    \  access to managed entities, this document introduces a new value for\n   the
    Service-Type (6) Attribute [RFC2865] and one new attribute.  The\n   new value
    for the Service-Type (6) Attribute is Framed-Management\n   (18), used for remote
    device management via a Framed Management\n   protocol.  The new attribute is
    Framed-Management-Protocol (133), the\n   value of which specifies a particular
    protocol for use in the remote\n   management session.\n   Two new attributes
    are introduced in this document in support of\n   granular management access rights
    or command privilege levels.  The\n   Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute provides
    a text string\n   specifying a policy name of local scope, that is assumed to
    have been\n   pre-provisioned on the NAS.  This use of an attribute to specify
    use\n   of a pre-provisioned policy is similar to the Filter-Id (11)\n   Attribute
    defined in [RFC2865] Section 5.11.\n   The local application of the Management-Policy-Id
    (135) Attribute\n   within the managed entity may take the form of (a) one of
    an\n   enumeration of command privilege levels, (b) a mapping into an SNMP\n   Access
    Control Model, such as the View-Based Access Control Model\n   (VACM) [RFC3415],
    or (c) some other set of management access policy\n   rules that is mutually understood
    by the managed entity and the\n   remote management application.  Examples are
    given in Section 8.\n   The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute contains
    an integer-\n   valued management privilege level indication.  This attribute
    serves\n   to modify or augment the management permissions provided by the NAS-\n
    \  Prompt (7) value of the Service-Type (6) Attribute, and thus applies\n   to
    CLI management.\n   To enable management security requirements to be specified,
    the\n   Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute is introduced.  The\n
    \  value of this attribute indicates the minimum level of secure\n   transport
    protocol protection required for the provisioning of NAS-\n   Prompt (7), Administrative
    (6), or Framed-Management (18) service.\n"
  title: 3.  Overview

  - "4.  Domain of Applicability\n   Most of the RADIUS attributes defined in this
    document have broad\n   applicability for provisioning local and remote management
    access to\n   NAS devices.  However, those attributes that provision remote access\n
    \  over Framed Management protocols and over secure transports have\n   special
    considerations.  This document does not specify the details\n   of the integration
    of these protocols with a RADIUS client in the NAS\n   implementation.  However,
    there are functional requirements for\n   correct application of Framed Management
    protocols and/or secure\n   transport protocols that will limit the selection
    of such protocols\n   that can be considered for use with RADIUS.  Since the RADIUS
    user\n   credentials are typically obtained by the RADIUS client from the\n   secure
    transport protocol server or the Framed Management protocol\n   server, the protocol,
    and its implementation in the NAS, MUST support\n   forms of credentials that
    are compatible with the authentication\n   methods supported by RADIUS.\n   RADIUS
    currently supports the following user authentication methods,\n   although others
    may be added in the future:\n   o  Password - RFC 2865\n   o  CHAP (Challenge
    Handshake Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2865\n   o  ARAP (Apple Remote Access
    Protocol) - RFC 2869\n   o  EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) - RFC 2869,
    RFC 3579\n   o  HTTP Digest - RFC 5090\n   The remote management protocols selected
    for use with the RADIUS\n   remote NAS management sessions, for example, those
    described in\n   Section 6.1, and the secure transport protocols selected to meet
    the\n   protection requirements, as described in Section 6.2, obviously need\n
    \  to support user authentication methods that are compatible with those\n   that
    exist in RADIUS.  The RADIUS authentication methods most likely\n   usable with
    these protocols are Password, CHAP, and possibly HTTP\n   Digest, with Password
    being the distinct common denominator.  There\n   are many secure transports that
    support other, more robust,\n   authentication mechanisms, such as public key.
    \ RADIUS has no support\n   for public key authentication, except within the context
    of an EAP\n   Method.  The applicability statement for EAP indicates that it is
    not\n   intended for use as an application-layer authentication mechanism, so\n
    \  its use with the mechanisms described in this document is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.
    \ In some cases, Password may be the only compatible\n   RADIUS authentication
    method available.\n"

      packets.  This attribute is used in conjunction with a\n   Service-Type (6)

      the NAS include an appropriately valued\n   Framed-Management-Protocol (133)
      Attribute in an Access-Request\n   packet, indicating the type of management
      access being requested.  It\n   is further RECOMMENDED that the NAS include

  - contents:
    - "6.2.  Management-Transport-Protection\n   The Management-Transport-Protection
      (134) Attribute specifies the\n   minimum level of protection that is required
      for a protected\n   transport used with the Framed or non-Framed Management
      access\n   session.  The protected transport used by the NAS MAY provide a\n
      \  greater level of protection, but MUST NOT provide a lower level of\n   protection.\n
      \  When a secure form of non-Framed Management access is specified, it\n   means
      that the remote terminal session is encapsulated in some form\n   of protected
      transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that an explicit\n   secure mode of
      operation is required, when the Framed Management\n   protocol contains an intrinsic
      secure mode of operation.  The\n   Management-Transport-Protection (134) Attribute
      does not apply to CLI\n   access via a local serial port, or other non-remote
      connection.\n   When a secure form of Framed Management access is specified,
      it means\n   that the application-layer management protocol is encapsulated
      in\n   some form of protected transport, or tunnel.  It may also mean that\n
      \  an explicit secure mode of operation is required, when the Framed\n   Management
      protocol contains an intrinsic secure mode of operation.\n   A value of \"No
      Protection (1)\" indicates that a secure transport\n   protocol is not required,
      and that the NAS SHOULD accept a connection\n   over any transport associated
      with the application-layer management\n   protocol.  The definitions of management
      application to transport\n   bindings are defined in the relevant documents
      that specify those\n   management application protocols.  The same \"No Protection\"
      semantics\n   are conveyed by omitting this attribute from an Access-Accept
      packet.\n   Specific protected transport protocols, cipher suites, key agreement\n
      \  methods, or authentication methods are not specified by this\n   attribute.
      \ Such provisioning is beyond the scope of this document.\n   It is RECOMMENDED
      that the NAS include an appropriately valued\n   Management-Transport-Protection
      (134) Attribute in an Access-Request\n   packet, indicating the level of transport
      protection for the\n   management access being requested, when that information
      is available\n   to the RADIUS client.  The RADIUS server MAY use this attribute
      as a\n   hint in making its authorization decision.\n   The RADIUS server MAY
      include a Management-Transport-Protection (134)\n   Attribute in an Access-Accept
      packet that also includes a Service-\n   Type (6) Attribute with a value of
      Framed-Management (18), when the\n   RADIUS server chooses to enforce a management

      level of transport\n   security.\n   When a NAS receives a Management-Transport-Protection
      (134) Attribute\n   in an Access-Accept packet, it MUST deliver the management
      access\n   over a transport with equal or better protection characteristics

    - "6.3.  Management-Policy-Id\n   The Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute indicates
      the name of the\n   management access policy for this user.  Zero or one Management-\n
      \  Policy-Id (135) Attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept packet.\n   Identifying
      a policy by name allows the policy to be used on\n   different NASes without
      regard to implementation details.\n   Multiple forms of management access rules
      may be expressed by the\n   underlying named policy, the definition of which
      is beyond the scope\n   of this document.  The management access policy MAY
      be applied\n   contextually, based on the nature of the management access method.\n
      \  For example, some named policies may only be valid for application to\n   NAS-Prompt
      (7) services and some other policies may only be valid for\n   SNMP.\n   The
      management access policy named in this attribute, received in an\n   Access-Accept
      packet, MUST be applied to the session authorized by\n   the Access-Accept.
      \ If the NAS supports this attribute, but the\n   policy name is unknown, or
      if the RADIUS client is able to determine\n   that the policy rules are incorrectly
      formatted, the NAS MUST treat\n   the Access-Accept packet as if it had been
      an Access-Reject.\n   No precedence relationship is defined for multiple occurrences
      of the\n   Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute.  NAS behavior in such cases
      is\n   undefined.  Therefore, two or more occurrences of this attribute\n   SHOULD
      NOT be included in an Access-Accept or CoA-Request (Change-of-\n   Authorization).
      \ In the absence of further specification defining\n   some sort of precedence
      relationship, it is not possible to guarantee\n   multi-vendor interoperability
      when using multiple instances of this\n   attribute in a single Access-Accept
      or CoA-Request packet.\n   The content of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute
      is expected\n   to be the name of a management access policy of local significance
      to\n   the NAS, within a namespace of significance to the NAS.  In this\n   regard,
      the behavior is similar to that for the Filter-Id (11)\n   Attribute.  The policy
      names and rules are committed to the local\n   configuration data-store of the
      NAS, and are provisioned by means\n   beyond the scope of this document, such
      as via SNMP, NETCONF, or CLI.\n   The namespace used in the Management-Policy-Id
      (135) Attribute is\n   simple and monolithic.  There is no explicit or implicit
      structure or\n   hierarchy.  For example, in the text string \"example.com\",
      the \".\"\n   (period or dot) is just another character.  It is expected that
      text\n   string matching will be performed without parsing the text string\n
      \  into any sub-fields.\n   Overloading or subdividing this simple name with
      multi-part\n   specifiers (e.g., Access=remote, Level=7) is likely to lead to
      poor\n   multi-vendor interoperability and SHOULD NOT be utilized.  If a\n   simple,
      unstructured policy name is not sufficient, it is RECOMMENDED\n   that a Vendor
      Specific (26) Attribute be used instead, rather than\n   overloading the semantics
      of Management-Policy-Id.\n   A summary of the Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute

    - "6.4.  Management-Privilege-Level\n   The Management-Privilege-Level (136) Attribute
      indicates the integer-\n   valued privilege level to be assigned for management
      access for the\n   authenticated user.  Many NASes provide the notion of differentiated\n
      \  management privilege levels denoted by an integer value.  The\n   specific
      access rights conferred by each value are implementation\n   dependent.  It
      MAY be used in both Access-Request and Access-Accept\n   packets.\n   The mapping
      of integer values for this attribute to specific\n   collections of management
      access rights or permissions on the NAS is\n   vendor and implementation specific.
      \ Such mapping is often a user-\n   configurable feature.  It's RECOMMENDED
      that greater numeric values\n   imply greater privilege.  However, it would
      be a mistake to assume\n   that this recommendation always holds.\n   The management
      access level indicated in this attribute, received in\n   an Access-Accept packet,
      MUST be applied to the session authorized by\n   the Access-Accept.  If the
      NAS supports this attribute, but the\n   privilege level is unknown, the NAS

      the Service-Type (6) Attribute has\n   a value of NAS-Prompt (7) (not Administrative).
      \ Typically, NASes\n   treat NAS-Prompt as the minimal privilege CLI service
      and\n   Administrative as full privilege.  Using the Management-Privilege-\n
      \  Level (136) Attribute with a Service-Type (6) Attribute having a\n   value
      of NAS-Prompt (7) will have the effect of increasing the\n   minimum privilege
      level.  Conversely, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use\n   this attribute with a Service-Type
      (6) Attribute with a value of\n   Administrative (6), which may require decreasing
      the maximum\n   privilege level.\n   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the Management-Privilege-Level
      (136)\n   Attribute in combination with a Management-Policy-Id (135) Attribute\n
      \  or for management access methods other than interactive CLI.  The\n   behavior
      resulting from such an overlay of management access control\n   provisioning
      is not defined by this document, and in the absence of\n   further specification,
      is likely to lead to unexpected behaviors,\n   especially in multi-vendor environments.\n"

  - "7.  Use with Dynamic Authorization\n   It is entirely OPTIONAL for the NAS management
    authorization\n   attributes specified in this document to be used in conjunction
    with\n   Dynamic Authorization extensions to RADIUS [RFC5176].  When such\n   usage
    occurs, those attributes MAY be used as listed in the Table of\n   Attributes
    in Section 10.\n   Some guidance on how to identify existing management sessions
    on a\n   NAS for the purposes of Dynamic Authorization is useful.  The primary\n
    \  session identifiers SHOULD be User-Name (1) and Service-Type (6).  To\n   accommodate
    instances when that information alone does not uniquely\n   identify a session,
    a NAS supporting Dynamic Authorization SHOULD\n   maintain one or more internal
    session identifiers that can be\n   represented as RADIUS attributes.  Examples
    of such attributes\n   include Acct-Session-Id (44), Acct-Multi-Session-Id (50),
    NAS-Port\n   (5), or NAS-Port-Id (87).  In the case of a remote management\n   session,
    common identifier values might include things such as the\n   remote IP address
    and remote TCP port number, or the file descriptor\n   value for use with the
    open socket.  Any such identifier is obviously\n   transient in nature, and implementations
    SHOULD take care to avoid\n   and/or properly handle duplicate or stale values.\n
    \  In order for the session identification attributes to be available to\n   the
    Dynamic Authorization Client, a NAS supporting Dynamic\n   Authorization for management
    sessions SHOULD include those session\n   identification attributes in the Access-Request
    message for each such\n   session.  Additional discussion of session identification
    attribute\n   usage may be found in Section 3 of [RFC5176].\n"

    - "12.1.  General Considerations\n   This specification describes the use of RADIUS
      and Diameter for\n   purposes of authentication, authorization, and accounting
      for\n   management access to devices within networks.  RADIUS threats and\n
      \  security issues for this application are described in [RFC3579] and\n   [RFC3580];
      security issues encountered in roaming are described in\n   [RFC2607].  For
      Diameter, the security issues relating to this\n   application are described
      in [RFC4005] and [RFC4072].\n   This document specifies new attributes that
      can be included in\n   existing RADIUS packets, which may be protected as described
      in\n   [RFC3579] and [RFC5176].  In Diameter, the attributes are protected\n
      \  as specified in [RFC3588].  See those documents for a more detailed\n   description.\n
      \  The security mechanisms supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused\n   on
      preventing an attacker from spoofing packets or modifying packets\n   in transit.
      \ They do not prevent an authorized RADIUS/Diameter server\n   or proxy from
      inserting attributes with malicious intent.\n   A legacy NAS may not recognize
      the attributes in this document that\n   supplement the provisioning of CLI
      management access.  If the value\n   of the Service-Type Attribute is NAS-Prompt
      or Administrative, the\n   legacy NAS may silently discard such attributes,
      while permitting the\n   user to access the CLI management interface(s) of the
      NAS.  This can\n   lead to users improperly receiving authorized management
      access to\n   the NAS, or access with greater levels of access rights than were\n
      \  intended.  RADIUS servers SHOULD attempt to ascertain whether or not\n   the
      NAS supports these attributes before sending them in an Access-\n   Accept message
      that provisions CLI access.\n   It is possible that certain NAS implementations
      may not be able to\n   determine the protection properties of the underlying
      transport\n   protocol as specified by the Management-Transport-Protection\n
      \  Attribute.  This may be a limitation of the standard application\n   programming
      interface of the underlying transport implementation or\n   of the integration
      of the transport into the NAS implementation.  In\n   either event, NASes conforming
      to this specification, which cannot\n   determine the protection state of the
      remote management connection,\n   MUST treat an Access-Accept message containing
      a Management-\n   Transport-Protection Attribute containing a value other than
      No-\n   Protection (1) as if it were an Access-Reject message, unless\n   specifically
      overridden by local policy configuration.\n   Use of the No-Protection (1) option
      for the Management-Transport-\n   Protection (134) Attribute is NOT RECOMMENDED
      in any deployment where\n   secure management or configuration is required.\n"
    title: 12.1.  General Considerations
  - contents:
    - "12.2.  RADIUS Proxy Operation Considerations\n   The device management access
      authorization attributes presented in\n   this document present certain considerations
      when used in RADIUS\n   proxy environments.  These considerations are not different
      from\n   those that exist in RFC 2865 [RFC2865] with respect to the Service-\n
      \  Type Attribute values of Administrative and NAS-Prompt.\n   Most RADIUS proxy
      environments are also multi-party environments.  In\n   multi-party proxy environments
      it is important to distinguish which\n   entities have the authority to provision
      management access to the\n   edge devices, i.e., NASes, and which entities only
      have authority to\n   provision network access services of various sorts.\n
      \  It may be important that operators of the NAS are able to ensure that\n   access
      to the CLI, or other management interfaces of the NAS, is only\n   provisioned
      to their own employees or contractors.  One way for the\n   NAS to enforce this
      requirement is to use only local, non-proxy\n   RADIUS servers for management
      access requests.  Proxy RADIUS servers\n   could be used for non-management
      access requests, based on local\n   policy.  This \"bifurcation\" of RADIUS
      authentication and\n   authorization is a simple case of separate administrative
      realms.\n   The NAS may be designed so as to maintain separate lists of RADIUS\n
      \  servers for management AAA use and for non-management AAA use.\n   An alternate
      method of enforcing this requirement would be for the\n   first-hop RADIUS proxy
      server, operated by the owner of the NAS, to\n   filter out any RADIUS attributes
      that provision management access\n   rights that originate from \"up-stream\"
      proxy servers not operated by\n   the NAS owner.  Access-Accept messages that
      provision such locally\n   unauthorized management access MAY be treated as
      if they were an\n   Access-Reject by the first-hop proxy server.\n   An additional
      exposure present in proxy deployments is that sensitive\n   user credentials,
      e.g., passwords, are likely to be available in\n   cleartext form at each of
      the proxy servers.  Encrypted or hashed\n   credentials are not subject to this
      risk, but password authentication\n   is a very commonly used mechanism for
      management access\n   authentication, and in RADIUS passwords are only protected
      on a hop-\n   by-hop basis.  Malicious proxy servers could misuse this sensitive\n
      \  information.\n   These issues are not of concern when all the RADIUS servers,
      local\n   and proxy, used by the NAS are under the sole administrative control\n
      \  of the NAS owner.\n"
