  - "1.   INTRODUCTION\n   This document defines guidelines and procedures for Internet\n\
    \   Engineering Task Force working groups.  The Internet is a loosely-\n   organized\
    \ international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected\n   networks; it supports\
    \ host-to-host communication through voluntary\n   adherence to open protocols\
    \ and procedures defined by Internet\n   Standards, a collection of which are\
    \ commonly known as \"the TCP/IP\n   protocol suite\". The Internet Standards\
    \ Process is defined in [1].\n   Development and review of potential Internet\
    \ Standards from all\n   sources is conducted by the Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF).\n   The IETF is a large, open community of network designers,\
    \ operators,\n   vendors, users, and researchers concerned with the Internet and\
    \ the\n   technology used on it. The IETF is managed by its Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) whose membership includes an IETF\n   Chair, responsible\
    \ for oversight of general IETF operations, and Area\n   Directors, each of whom\
    \ is responsible for a set of IETF activities\n   and working groups. The IETF\
    \ Executive Director and IESG Secretary\n   are ex-officio participants, as are\
    \ the IAB Chair and a designated\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB) member.\
    \  At present there are 10\n   areas, though the number and purview of areas changes\
    \ over time:\n            User Services               (USV)\n            Applications\
    \                (APP)\n            Service Applications        (SAP)\n      \
    \      Transport Services          (TSV)\n            Internet               \
    \     (INT)\n            Routing                     (RTG)\n            Network\
    \ Management          (MGT)\n            Operational Requirements    (OPS)\n \
    \           Security                    (SEC)\n            Standards & Processes\
    \       (STD)\n   Most areas have an advisory group or directorate.  The specific\
    \ name\n   and the details of the role for each group differs from area to area,\n\
    \   but the primary intent is that the group assist the Area Director,\n   e.g.,\
    \ with the review of specifications produced in the area. An\n   advisory group\
    \ is formed by an Area Director (AD) and comprises\n   experienced members of\
    \ the IETF and technical community represented\n   by the area.  A small IETF\
    \ Secretariat provides staff and\n   administrative support for the operation\
    \ of the IETF.\n   The primary activities of the IETF are performed by committees\
    \ known\n   as working groups. There are currently more than 60 of these.\n  \
    \ Working groups tend to have a narrow focus and a lifetime bounded by\n   completion\
    \ of a specific task, although there are exceptions.\n   There is no formal membership\
    \ in the IETF.  Participation is open to\n   all.  This participation may be by\
    \ on-line contribution, attendance\n   at face-to-face sessions, or both.  Anyone\
    \ from the Internet\n   community who has the time and interest is urged to participate\
    \ in\n   IETF meetings and any of its on-line working group discussions.\n   Participation\
    \ is by individual technical contributors, rather than by\n   formal representatives\
    \ of organizations.\n   This document defines procedures and guidelines for formation\
    \ and\n   operation of working groups in the IETF. It defines the relations of\n\
    \   working groups to other bodies within the IETF. The duties of working\n  \
    \ group Chairs and Area Directors with respect to the operation of the\n   working\
    \ group are also defined.  The document uses: \"shall\", \"will\",\n   \"must\"\
    \ and \"is required\" where it describes steps in the process that\n   are essential,\
    \ and uses: \"suggested\", \"should\" and \"may\" are where\n   guidelines are\
    \ described that are not essential, but are strongly\n   recommended to help smooth\
    \ WG operation.\n"
- title: 1.1. IETF approach to standardization
  contents:
  - "1.1. IETF approach to standardization\n   The reader is encouraged to study The\
    \ Internet Standards Process [1].\n   Familiarity with this document is essential\
    \ for a complete\n   understanding of the philosophy, procedures and guidelines\
    \ described\n   in this document.\n   The goals of the process are summarized\
    \ in [1]:\n     \"In general, an Internet Standard is a specification that is\n\
    \     stable and well-understood, is technically competent, has\n     multiple,\
    \ independent, and interoperable implementations\n     with operational experience,\
    \ enjoys significant public\n     support, and is recognizably useful in some\
    \ or all parts of\n     the Internet.\n     ...\n     \"In outline, the process\
    \ of creating an Internet Standard is\n     straightforward: a specification undergoes\
    \ a period of\n     development and several iterations of review by the Internet\n\
    \     community and perhaps revision based upon experience, is\n     adopted as\
    \ a Standard by the appropriate body (see below),\n     and is published.\n  \
    \   \"In practice, the process is somewhat more complicated, due\n     to (1)\
    \ the number and type of possible sources for\n     specifications; (2) the need\
    \ to prepare and revise a\n     specification in a manner that preserves the interests\
    \ of\n     all of the affected parties;  (3) the importance of\n     establishing\
    \ widespread community agreement on its technical\n     content; and (4) the difficulty\
    \ of evaluating the utility of\n     a particular specification for the Internet\
    \ community.\n     ...\n     \"These procedures are explicitly aimed at developing\
    \ and\n     adopting generally-accepted practices.  Thus, a candidate\n     for\
    \ Internet standardization is implemented and tested for\n     correct operation\
    \ and interoperability by multiple,\n     independent parties, and utilized in\
    \ increasingly demanding\n     environments, before it can be adopted as an Internet\n\
    \     Standard.\"\n   The IETF standardization process has been marked by informality.\
    \  As\n   the community of participation has grown it has become necessary to\n\
    \   document procedures, while continuing to avoid unnecessary\n   bureaucracy.\
    \  This goals of this balancing act are summarized in [1]\n   as:\n     \"The\
    \ procedures that are described here provide a great deal\n     of flexibility\
    \ to adapt to the wide variety of circumstances\n     that occur in the Internet\
    \ standardization process.\n     Experience has shown this flexibility to be vital\
    \ in\n     achieving the following goals for Internet standardization:\n     \
    \      *    high quality,\n           *    prior implementation and testing,\n\
    \           *    openness and fairness, and\n           *    timeliness.\"\n"

- title: 2.  WORKING GROUP (WG) FORMATION
  contents:
  - "2.  WORKING GROUP (WG) FORMATION\n   IETF working groups (WGs) are the primary\
    \ mechanism for development\n   of IETF specifications and guidelines, many of\
    \ which are intended as\n   standards or recommendations. A working group may\
    \ be established at\n   the initiative of an Area Director (AD) or it may be initiated\
    \ by an\n   individual or group of individuals. Anyone interested in creating\
    \ an\n   IETF working group must obtain the advice and consent of the\n   appropriate\
    \ IETF Area Director under whose direction the working\n   group would fall and\
    \ must proceed through the formal steps detailed\n   in this section.\n   A working\
    \ group is typically created to address a specific problem or\n   produce a deliverable\
    \ (a guideline, standards specification, etc.)\n   and is expected to be short-lived\
    \ in nature.  Upon completion of its\n   goals and achievement of its objectives,\
    \ the working group as a unit\n   is terminated. Alternatively at the discretion\
    \ of the IESG, Area\n   Director, the WG Chair and the WG participants, the objectives\
    \ or\n   assignment of the working group may be extended by enhancing or\n   modifying\
    \ the working group's charter.\n"
- title: 2.1. Criteria for formation
  contents:
  - "2.1. Criteria for formation\n   When determining whether it is appropriate to\
    \ create a working group,\n   the Area Director and the IESG will consider several\
    \ issues:\n   -    Are the issues that the working group plans to address clear\n\
    \        and relevant for the Internet community?\n   -    Are the goals specific\
    \ and reasonably achievable, and\n        achievable within the time frame specified\
    \ by the\n        milestones?\n   -    What are the risks and urgency of the work,\
    \ to determine the\n        level of attention required?\n   -    Do the working\
    \ group's activities overlap with those of\n        another working group? If\
    \ so, it may still be appropriate to\n        create the working group, but this\
    \ question must be\n        considered carefully by the Area Directors as subdividing\n\
    \        efforts often dilutes the available technical expertise.\n   -    Is\
    \ there sufficient interest and expertise in the working\n        group's topic\
    \ with at least several people willing to expend\n        the effort to produce\
    \ the desired result (e.g., a protocol\n        specification)?  Working groups\
    \ require considerable effort,\n        including management of the working group\
    \ process, editing\n        of working group documents, and contribution to the\
    \ document\n        text.  IETF experience suggests that these roles typically\n\
    \        cannot all be handled by one person; four or five active\n        participants\
    \ are typically required.\n   -    Does a base of interested consumers (end users)\
    \ appear to\n        exist for the planned work?  Consumer interest can be\n \
    \       measured by participation of end-users within the IETF\n        process,\
    \ as well as by less direct means.\n   Considering the above criteria, the Area\
    \ Director will decide whether\n   to pursue the formation of the group through\
    \ the chartering process.\n"
- title: 2.2. Charter
  contents:
  - "2.2. Charter\n   The formation of a working group requires a charter which is\n\
    \   primarily negotiated between a prospective working group Chair and\n   the\
    \ relevant Area Director, although final approval is made by the\n   IESG and\
    \ all charters are reviewed by the Internet Architecture Board\n   (IAB).  A charter\
    \ is a contract between a working group and the IETF\n   to perform a set of tasks.\
    \  A charter:\n   1.   Lists relevant administrative aspects of the working group;\n\
    \   2.   Specifies the direction or objectives of the working group\n        and\
    \ describes the approach that will be taken to achieve the\n        goals; and\n\
    \   3.   Enumerates a set of milestones together with time frames for\n      \
    \  their completion.\n   When the prospective Chair, the Area Director and the\
    \ IESG Secretary\n   are satisfied with the charter form and content, it becomes\
    \ the basis\n   for forming a working group. The AD may require an initial draft\
    \ of a\n   charter to be available prior to holding an exploratory Birds of a\n\
    \   Feather (BOF) meeting, as described below.\n   Charters may be renegotiated\
    \ periodically to reflect the current\n   status, organization or goals of the\
    \ working group. Hence, a charter\n   is a contract between the IETF and the working\
    \ group which is\n   committing to meet explicit milestones and delivering concrete\n\
    \   \"products\".\n   Specifically, each charter consists of 6 sections:\n   Working\
    \ group name\n        A working group name should be reasonably descriptive or\n\
    \        identifiable. Additionally, the group shall define an\n        acronym\
    \ (maximum 8 printable ASCII characters) to reference\n        the group in the\
    \ IETF directories, mailing lists, and\n        general documents.\n   Chair(s)\n\
    \        The working group may have one or two Chair(s) to perform\n        the\
    \ administrative functions of the group. The email\n        address(es) of the\
    \ Chair(s) shall be included.\n   Area and Area Director(s)\n        The name\
    \ of the IETF area with which the working group is\n        affiliated and the\
    \ name and electronic mail address of the\n        associated Area Director.\n\
    \   Mailing list\n        It is required that an IETF working group have a general\n\
    \        Internet mailing list.  Most of the work of an IETF working\n       \
    \ group will be conducted that.\n        The charter shall include:\n        \
    \     The address to which a participant sends a\n             subscription request\
    \ and the procedures to follow when\n             subscribing,\n             The\
    \ address to which a participant sends submissions\n             and special procedures,\
    \ if any, and\n             The location of the mailing list archive, if any.\n\
    \        A message archive should be maintained in a public place\n        which\
    \ can be accessed via FTP. The ability to retrieve from\n        the archive via\
    \ electronic mail requests also is\n        recommended. Additionally, the address:\n\
    \             ietf-archive@cnri.reston.va.us\n        shall be included on the\
    \ mailing list.\n        NOTE:   It is strongly suggested that the mailing list\
    \ be on\n        a host directly connected to the IP Internet to facilitate\n\
    \        use of the SMTP expansion command (EXPN) and to allow mail\n        archive\
    \ access via FTP, gopher and the like in keeping with\n        the general IETF\
    \ rule for openness. If this is not possible,\n        the message archive and\
    \ membership of the list must be made\n        available to those who request\
    \ it by sending a message to\n        the list-request alias.\n   Description\
    \ of working group\n   The focus and intent of the group shall be set forth briefly.\
    \ By\n   reading this section alone, an individual should be able to decide\n\
    \   whether this group is relevant to their own work. The first paragraph\n  \
    \ must give a brief summary of the problem area, basis, goal(s) and\n   approach(es)\
    \ planned for the working group.  This paragraph will\n   frequently be used as\
    \ an overview of the working group's effort.\n   The terms \"they\", \"them\"\
    \ and \"their\" are used in this document as\n   third-person singular pronouns.\n\
    \        To facilitate evaluation of the intended work and to provide\n      \
    \  on-going guidance to the working group, the charter shall\n        describe\
    \ the problem being solved and shall discuss\n        objectives and expected\
    \ impact with respect to:\n        -    Architecture\n        -    Operations\n\
    \        -    Security\n        -    Network management\n        -    Transition\
    \ (where applicable)\n   Goals and milestones\n        The working group charter\
    \ must establish a timetable for\n        work. While this may be re-negotiated\
    \ over time, the list\n        of milestones and dates facilitates the Area Director's\n\
    \        tracking of working group progress and status, and it is\n        indispensable\
    \ to potential participants identifying the\n        critical moments for input.\
    \ Milestones shall consist of\n        deliverables that can be qualified as showing\
    \ specific\n        achievement; e.g., \"Internet-Draft finished\" is fine, but\n\
    \        \"discuss via email\" is not. It is helpful to specify\n        milestones\
    \ for every 3-6 months, so that progress can be\n        gauged easily.  This\
    \ milestone list is expected to be\n        updated periodically. Updated milestones\
    \ are re-negotiated\n        with the Area Director and the IESG, as needed, and\
    \ then are\n        submitted to the IESG Secretary:\n             IESG-secretary@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   An example of a WG charter is in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 2.3. Charter review & approval
  contents:
  - "2.3. Charter review & approval\n   Working groups often comprise technically\
    \ competent participants who\n   are not familiar with the history of Internet\
    \ architecture or IETF\n   processes.  This can, unfortunately, lead to good working\
    \ group\n   consensus about a bad design.  To facilitate working group efforts,\n\
    \   an Area Director may assign an Area Consultant from among the ranks\n   of\
    \ senior IETF participants.  (Area Consultants are described in the\n   section\
    \ of Staff Roles.)  At the discretion of the AD, approval of a\n   new WG may\
    \ be withheld in the absence of sufficient Consultant\n   resources.\n   Once\
    \ the Area Director (and the Area Directorate, as the AD deems\n   appropriate)\
    \ has approved the working group charter, the charter is\n   submitted for review\
    \ by the IAB and approval by the Internet\n   Engineering Steering Group using\
    \ the criteria described previously.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\
    \ will review the charter of the\n   proposed WG to determine the relationship\
    \ of the proposed work to the\n   overall architecture of the Internet Protocol\
    \ Suite.\n   The approved charter is submitted to the IESG Secretary who records\n\
    \   and enters the information into the IETF tracking database and\n   returns\
    \ the charter in a form formatted by the database.  The working\n   group is announced\
    \ to the IETF mailing list by the IESG Secretary.\n"
- title: 2.4. Birds of a feather (BOF)
  contents:
  - "2.4. Birds of a feather (BOF)\n   Often it is not clear whether an issue merits\
    \ the formation of a\n   working group. To facilitate exploration of the issues\
    \ the IETF\n   offers the possibility of a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session, as\
    \ well\n   as the early formation of an email list for preliminary discussion.\n\
    \   Alternatively, a BOF may serve as a forum for a single presentation\n   or\
    \ discussion, without any intent to form a working group.\n   A BOF is a session\
    \ at an IETF meeting which permits \"market research\"\n   and technical \"brainstorming\"\
    .  Any individual may request permission\n   to hold a BOF on a subject. The request\
    \ must be filed with the\n   relevant Area Director. The person who requests the\
    \ BOF is usually\n   appointed as Chair of the BOF.  The Chair of the BOF is also\n\
    \   responsible for providing a report on the outcome of the BOF.\n   The AD may\
    \ require the conduct of email discussion, prior to\n   authorizing a BOF.  This\
    \ permits initial exchanges and sharing of\n   framework, vocabulary and approaches,\
    \ in order to make the time spent\n   in the BOF more productive.  The AD may\
    \ require that a BOF be held,\n   prior to establishing a working group, and the\
    \ AD may require that\n   there be a draft of the WG charter prior to holding\
    \ a BOF.\n   Usually the outcome of a BOF will be one of the following:\n   -\
    \    There was enough interest and focus in the subject to\n        warrant the\
    \ formation of a WG;\n   -    The discussion came to a fruitful conclusion, with\
    \ results\n        to be written down and published, however there is no need\n\
    \        to establish a WG; or\n   -    There was not enough interest in the subject\
    \ to warrant the\n        formation of a WG.\n   There is an increasing demand\
    \ for BOF sessions at IETF meetings.\n   Therefore the following rules apply for\
    \ BOFs:\n   -    All BOFs must have the approval of the appropriate Area\n   \
    \     Director. The Secretariat will NOT schedule or allocate time\n        slots\
    \ without the explicit approval of the Area Director.\n   -    The purpose of\
    \ a BOF is to conduct a single, brief\n        discussion or to ascertain interest\
    \ and establish goals for\n        a working group. All BOF organizers are required\
    \ to submit a\n        brief written report of what transpired during the BOF\n\
    \        session together with a roster of attendees to the IESG\n        Secretary\
    \ for inclusion in the Proceedings.\n   -    A BOF may be held only once (ONE\
    \ slot at one IETF Plenary\n        meeting).\n   -    Under unusual circumstances\
    \ an Area Director may, at their\n        discretion, allow a BOF to meet for\
    \ a second time. Typically\n        (though not a requirement) this is to develop\
    \ a charter to\n        be submitted to the IESG.\n   -    BOFs are not permitted\
    \ to meet three times.\n   -    A BOF may be held for single-event discussion,\
    \ or may pursue\n        creation of normal IETF working groups for on-going\n\
    \        interactions and discussions. When the request for a BOF\n        comes\
    \ from a formally-constituted group, rather than from an\n        individual,\
    \ the rules governing the handling of the request\n        are the same as for\
    \ all other BOFs and working groups.\n   -    When necessary, WGs will be given\
    \ priority for meeting space\n        over BOFs.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  WORKING GROUP OPERATION\n   The IETF has basic requirements for open and\
    \ fair participation and\n   for thorough consideration of technical alternatives.\
    \  Within those\n   constraints, working groups are autonomous and each determines\
    \ most\n   of the details of its own operation with respect to session\n   participation,\
    \ reaching closure, etc. The core rule for operation is\n   that acceptance or\
    \ agreement is achieved via working group \"rough\n   consensus\".\n   A number\
    \ of procedural questions and issues will arise over time, and\n   it is the function\
    \ of the Working Group Chair to manage the group\n   process, keeping in mind\
    \ that the overall purpose of the group is to\n   make progress towards reaching\
    \ rough consensus in realizing the\n   working group's goals and objectives.\n\
    \   There are few hard and fast rules on organizing or conducting working\n  \
    \ group activities, but a set of guidelines and practices have evolved\n   over\
    \ time that have proven successful. These are listed here, with\n   actual choices\
    \ typically determined by the working group participants\n   and the Chair.\n"
- title: 3.1. Session planning
  contents:
  - "3.1. Session planning\n   For coordinated, structured WG interactions, the Chair\
    \ must publish a\n   draft agenda well in advance of the actual session. The agenda\
    \ needs\n   to contain at least:\n   -    The items for discussion;\n   -    The\
    \ estimated time necessary per item; and\n   -    A clear indication of what documents\
    \ the participants will\n        need to read before the session in order to be\
    \ well\n        prepared.\n   Publication shall include sending a copy to the\
    \ working group mailing\n   list and to the IETF-Announce list.  Notices for the\
    \ IETF-Announce\n   list should be sent to:\n          ietf-announce-post@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   All working group actions shall be taken in a public forum, and wide\n   participation\
    \ is encouraged.   A working group will conduct much of\n   its business via electronic\
    \ mail distribution lists but may meet\n   periodically to discuss and review\
    \ task status and progress, to\n   resolve specific issues and to direct future\
    \ activities. It is\n   common, but not required, that a working group will meet\
    \ at the\n   trimester IETF Plenary events. Additionally, interim sessions may\
    \ be\n   scheduled for telephone conference, video teleconference, or for\n  \
    \ face-to-face (physical) sessions.\n   All working group sessions (including\
    \ those held outside of the IETF\n   meetings) shall be reported by making minutes\
    \ available.  These\n   minutes should include the agenda for the session, an\
    \ account of the\n   discussion including any decisions made, and a list of attendees.\
    \ The\n   Working Group Chair is responsible for insuring that session minutes\n\
    \   are written and distributed, though the actual task may be performed\n   by\
    \ someone designated by the Working Group Chair. The minutes shall\n   be submitted\
    \ in printable ASCII text for publication in the IETF\n   Proceedings, and for\
    \ posting in the IETF Directories and are to be\n   sent to:\n               \

    \ often permit better focus and therefore can be more\n   efficient for reaching\
    \ a consensus among a core of the working group\n   participants.  In determining\
    \ the balance, the WG must ensure that\n   its process does not serve to exclude\
    \ contribution by email-only\n   participants.  Also note that decisions reached\

    \ apply for\n   time-slots as soon as the first announcement of that IETF meeting\
    \ is\n   made by the IETF Secretariat to the WG-chairs list.  Session time is\n\
    \   a scarce resource at IETF meetings, so placing requests early will\n   facilitate\
    \ schedule coordination for WGs requiring the same set of\n   experts.\n   The\
    \ application for a WG session at an IETF meeting shall be made to\n   the IETF\
    \ Secretariat.  Alternatively some Area Directors may want to\n   coordinate WG\
    \ sessions in their area and request that time slots be\n   coordinated through\
    \ them.  After receiving all requests for time\n   slots by WGs in the area, the\
    \ Area Director(s) form a draft session-\n   agenda for their area, which is then\
    \ sent to the WG chairs of the\n   area. After approval it will be sent to the\
    \ IETF Secretariat.\n   An application must contain:\n   -    The amount of time\
    \ requested;\n   -    The rough outline of the WG agenda that is expected to be\n\
    \        covered;\n   -    The estimated number of people that will attend the\
    \ WG\n        session;\n   -    Related WGs that must not be scheduled for the\
    \ same time\n        slot(s); and\n   -    Individuals whose attendance is desired.\n\
    \   The Secretariat allots time slots on the basis of the session-agenda\n   made\
    \ by the Area Director(s). If the proposed session- agenda for an\n   area does\
    \ not fit into the IETF meeting-agenda, the IETF Secretariat\n   will adjust it\
    \ to fit, after consulting the Area Director(s) and the\n   relevant chairs. \
    \ The Secretariat will then form a draft session-\n   agenda and distribute it\
    \ among the Working Group Chairs for final\n   approval.\n   NOTE:  While open\
    \ discussion and contribution is essential to working\n   group success, the Chair\
    \ is responsible for ensuring forward\n   progress.  When acceptable to the WG,\
    \ the Chair may call for\n   restricted participation (but not restricted attendance!)\
    \ at IETF\n   working group sessions for the purpose of achieving progress. The\n\
    \   Working Group Chair then has the authority to refuse to grant the\n   floor\
    \ to any individual who is unprepared or otherwise covering\n   inappropriate\
    \ material.\n"

    \ is\n   possible for a much wider base of interested persons than is\n   attendance\

- title: 3.3. Session management
  contents:
  - "3.3. Session management\n   Working groups make decisions through a \"rough consensus\"\
    \ process.\n   IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although\n\
    \   this is, of course, preferred.  In general the dominant view of the\n   working\
    \ group shall prevail.  (However, it must be noted that\n   \"dominance\" is not\
    \ to be determined on the basis of volume or\n   persistence, but rather a more\
    \ general sense of agreement.)\n   Consensus can be determined by balloting, humming,\
    \ or any other means\n   on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course).\n\
    \   The challenge to managing working group sessions is to balance the\n   need\
    \ for open and fair consideration of the issues against the need\n   to make forward\
    \ progress.  The working group, as a whole, has the\n   final responsibility for\
    \ striking this balance.  The Chair has the\n   responsibility for overseeing\
    \ the process but may delegate direct\n   process management to a formally-designated\
    \ Facilitator.\n   It is occasionally appropriate to revisit a topic, to re-evaluate\n\
    \   alternatives or to improve the group's understanding of a relevant\n   decision.\
    \  However, unnecessary repeated discussions on issues can be\n   avoided if the\
    \ Chair makes sure that the main arguments in the\n   discussion (and the outcome)\
    \ are summarized and archived after a\n   discussion has come to conclusion. It\
    \ is also good practice to note\n   important decisions/consensus reached by email\
    \ in the minutes of the\n   next 'live' session, and to summarize briefly the\
    \ decision-making\n   history in the final documents the WG produces.\n   To facilitate\
    \ making forward progress, a Working Group Chair may wish\n   to direct a discussion\
    \ to reject or defer the input from a member,\n   based upon the following criteria:\n\
    \   Old\n     The input pertains to a topic that already has been resolved\n \
    \    and is redundant with information previously available;\n   Minor\n     The\
    \ input is new and pertains to a topic that has already\n     been resolved, but\
    \ it is felt to be of minor import to the\n     existing decision;\n   Timing\n\
    \     The input pertains to a topic that the working group has not\n     yet opened\
    \ for discussion; or\n   Scope\n     The input is outside of the scope of the\
    \ working group\n     charter.\n"
- title: 3.4. Contention and appeals overview
  contents:
  - "3.4. Contention and appeals overview\n   In the course of group design processes,\
    \ strife happens.  Strife and\n   contention are particularly likely when working\
    \ groups comprise many\n   constituencies.  On the other hand differences in view\
    \ are vital to\n   the success of the IETF and healthy debate is encouraged. \
    \ Sometimes\n   debates degenerate into something akin to warfare.  For these\n\
    \   circumstances, the IETF has an extensive review and appeals process.\n   Formal\
    \ procedures for requesting review and conducting appeals are\n   documented in\
    \ The Internet Standards Process [1].  A brief summary is\n   provided, here.\n\
    \   In fact the IETF approach to reviews and appeals is quite simple:\n   When\
    \ an IETF participant feels that matters have not been conducted\n   properly,\
    \ they should state their concern to a member of IETF\n   management.  In other\
    \ words, the process relies upon those who have\n   concerns raising them.  If\
    \ the result is not satisfactory, there are\n   several levels of appeal available,\
    \ to ensure that review is possible\n   by a number of people uninvolved in the\
    \ matter in question.\n   Reviews and appeals step through four levels, each in\
    \ turn:\n   WG Chair\n     An appeal must begin with the management closest to\
    \ the\n     operation of the working group, even if the concern applies\n    \
    \ to their own handling of working group process.\n   Area\n     If discussion\
    \ and review with the WG Chair do not produce a\n     satisfactory result, the\
    \ complainant may bring their concern\n     to the cognizant Area Director.\n\
    \   IESG\n     If a concerned party is not satisfied with the results of\n   \
    \  the area-level review, then they may bring the matter to the\n     IESG Chair\
    \ and the Area Director for Standards & Processes.\n     The IESG Chair and the\
    \ Standards & Processes AD will bring\n     the issue before the full IESG for\
    \ an additional review and\n     will report the resolution back to the parties.\n\
    \   IAB\n     The IAB provides a final opportunity to appeal the results\n   \
    \  of previous reviews.   If a concerned party does not accept\n     the outcome\
    \ of the IESG review, then they may take their\n     concern to the IAB, by contacting\
    \ the IAB Chair.\n   Concerns entail either a disagreement with technical decisions\
    \ by the\n   working group or with the process by which working group business\
    \ has\n   been conducted.  Technical disagreements may be about specific\n   details\
    \ or about basic approach.  When an issue pertains to\n   preference, it should\
    \ be resolved within the working group.  When a\n   matter pertains to the technical\
    \ adequacy of a decision, review is\n   encouraged whenever the perceived deficiency\
    \ is noted.  For matters\n   having to do with preference, working group rough\
    \ consensus will\n   dominate.\n   When a matter pertains to working group process,\
    \ it is important that\n   those with a concern be clear about the manner in which\
    \ the process\n   was not open or fair and that they be willing to discuss the\
    \ issue\n   openly and directly.  In turn, the IETF management will make every\n\
    \   effort to understand how the process was conducted, what deficiencies\n  \
    \ were present (if any) and how the matter should be corrected.  The\n   IETF\
    \ functions on the good will and mutual respect of its\n   participants; continued\
    \ success requires continued attention to\n   working group process.\n"

  - "4.  WORKING GROUP TERMINATION\n   Working groups are typically chartered to accomplish\

    \   dormant rather than disband (i.e., the WG will no longer conduct\n   formal\
    \ activities, but the mailing list will remain available to\n   review the work\
    \ as it moves to Draft Standard and Standard status.)\n   If, at some point, it\

- title: 5.1. WG Chair
  contents:
  - "5.1. WG Chair\n   The Working Group Chair is concerned with making forward progress\n\
    \   through a fair and open process, and has wide discretion in the\n   conduct\
    \ of WG business.  The Chair must ensure that a number of tasks\n   are performed,\
    \ either directly or by others assigned to the tasks.\n   This encompasses at\
    \ the very least the following:\n   Ensure WG process and content management\n\
    \     The Chair has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a\n     working\
    \ group achieves forward progress and meets its\n     milestones.  For some working\
    \ groups, this can be\n     accomplished by having the Chair perform all management-\n\
    \     related activities.  In other working groups -- particularly\n     those\
    \ with large or divisive participation -- it is helpful\n     to allocate process\
    \ and/or secretarial functions to other\n     participants.  Process management\
    \ pertains strictly to the\n     style of working group interaction and not to\
    \ its content.\n     It ensures fairness and detects redundancy.  The secretarial\n\
    \     function encompasses document editing.  It is quite common\n     for a working\
    \ group to assign the task of specification\n     Editor to one or two participants.\
    \  Often, they also are\n     part of the design team, described below.\n   Moderate\
    \ the WG email list\n     The Chair should attempt to ensure that the discussions\
    \ on\n     this list are relevant and that they converge to consensus\n     agreements.\
    \ The Chair should make sure that discussions on\n     the list are summarized\
    \ and that the outcome is well\n     documented (to avoid repetition).  The Chair\
    \ also may choose\n     to schedule organized on-line \"sessions\" with agenda\
    \ and\n     deliverables.  These are structured as true meetings,\n     conducted\
    \ over the course of several days (to allow\n     participation across the Internet.)\
    \  Participants are\n     expected to allocate time to the meeting, usually in\
    \ the\n     range of 1-2 hours per day of the \"meeting\".\n   Organize, prepare\
    \ and chair face-to-face & on-line formal sessions\n     The Chair should plan\
    \ and announce sessions well in advance.\n     (See section on Session Planning\
    \ for exact procedures.)\n   Communicate results of sessions\n     The Chair and/or\
    \ Secretary must ensure that minutes of a\n     session are taken and that an\
    \ attendance list is circulated.\n     See the section on Session Documents for\
    \ detailed\n     procedures.\n     Immediately after a session, the WG Chair must\
    \ immediately\n     provide the Area Director with a very short report\n     (approximately\
    \ one paragraph, via email) on the session.\n     This is used in an Area Report\
    \ as presented in the\n     Proceedings of each IETF meeting.\n   Distribute the\
    \ work\n     Of course each WG will have participants who may not be able\n  \
    \   (or want) to do any work at all. Most of the time the bulk\n     of the work\
    \ is done by a few dedicated participants. It is\n     the task of the Chair to\
    \ motivate enough experts to allow\n     for a fair distribution of the workload.\n\
    \   Document development\n     Working groups produce documents and documents\
    \ need authors.\n     The Chair will make sure that authors of WG documents\n\
    \     incorporate changes as discussed by the WG.  See the section\n     on Session\
    \ Documents for details procedures.\n   Document publication\n     The Chair and/or\
    \ Secretary will work with the RFC Editor to\n     ensure document conformance\
    \ with RFC publication\n     requirements and to coordinate any editorial changes\n\

  - "6.2. IETF meeting document archive\n   In preparing for an IETF meeting it is\
    \ helpful to have ready access\n   to all documents that are being reviewed. While\
    \ documents usually are\n   placed in the internet-drafts Internet Repository\
    \ or in the\n   respective working group archives or just published in some mail-\n\
    \   lists, there are just too many things to browse or read through.\n   Also,\
    \ many documents are modified immediately before a meeting.\n   The InterNIC Directory\
    \ and Database Services provides a current-\n   ietf-docs archive to enable people\
    \ to get all documents that are\n   relevant for the up-coming IETF meeting. \
    \ This document database will\n   be removed two weeks after the IETF meeting.\n\
    \   The completeness of this archive depends on the authors and working\n   group\
    \ chairs submitting the documents.  Each WG Chair is requested to\n   submit the\
    \ agenda to this archive.\n   Structure of the archive:\n   On ds.internic.net\
    \ documents will be stored under the appropriate\n   working group name under\
    \ the appropriate area name in the directory:\n          /pub/current-ietf-docs\n\
    \   Each area will also have a directory called bof where a document to\n   be\
    \ discussed in a BOF meeting will be placed.  At the area level a\n   directory\
    \ called plenary will be created to hold documents or\n   presentation material\
    \ related to a plenary session.  Any filename\n   conflicts will be resolved by\
    \ the InterNIC's administrator and the\n   submitter will be informed via electronic\

- title: 6.6. Review of documents

  - "6.6. Review of documents\n   Usually in case of a submission intended as an Informational\
    \ or\n   Experimental RFC minimal review is necessary. However, if the WG or\n\
    \   the RFC Editor thinks that an extensive review is appropriate, the\n   Area\
    \ Director may be asked to conduct one. This review may either be\n   done by\
    \ the AD and other IESG participants or the IESG may ask for an\n   independent\
    \ review (e.g., by someone not part of the WG in question)\n   from the Area Directorate\
    \ or elsewhere.\n   A review will lead to one of three possible conclusions:\n\
    \   1.   The document is accepted as is.\n        This fact will be announced\
    \ by the IESG Secretary to the\n        IETF mailing list and to the RFC Editor.\
    \ Publication is then\n        further handled between the RFC Editor and the\
    \ author(s).\n   2.   Changes regarding content are suggested to the author(s)/WG.\n\
    \        Suggestions must be clear and direct, so as to facilitate\n        working\
    \ group and author correction of the specification.\n        Once the author(s)/WG\
    \ have made these changes or have\n        explained to the satisfaction of the\
    \ reviewers why the\n        changes are not necessary, the document will be accepted\
    \ for\n        publication as under point 1, above.\n   3.   The document is rejected.\n\
    \        This will need strong and thorough arguments from the\n        reviewers.\
    \ The whole IETF and working group process is\n        structured such that this\
    \ alternative is not likely to arise\n        for documents coming from a working\
    \ group. After all, the\n        intentions of the document will already have\
    \ been described\n        in the WG charter, and reviewed at the start of the\
    \ WG.\n   If any individual or group of individuals feels that the review\n  \
    \ treatment has been unfair, there is the opportunity to make a\n   procedural\
    \ complaint. The mechanism for procedural complaints is\n   described in the section\
    \ on Contention and Appeal.\n   Before the IESG makes a final decision on a standards-track\
    \ document,\n   the IESG Secretary will issue a \"Last Call\" to the IETF mailing\
    \ list.\n   This Last Call will announce the intention of the IESG to consider\n\
    \   the document, and it will solicit final comments from the IETF within\n  \
    \ a period of two weeks.  It is important to note that a Last Call is\n   intended\
    \ as a brief, final check with the Internet community, to make\n   sure that no\
    \ important concerns have been missed or misunderstood.\n   The Last Call cannot\
    \ serve as a more general, in-depth review.\n"

    \ Group:\n       The demand for Internet teleconferencing has arrived, yet an\n\
    \       infrastructure to support this demand is barely in place.\n       Multimedia\
    \ session control, defined as the management and\n       coordination of multiple\
    \ sessions and their multiple users in\n       multiple media (e.g., audio, video),\
    \ is one component of the\n       infrastructure.  The Multiparty Multimedia Session\
    \ Control\n       Working Group is chartered to design and specify a protocol\
    \ to\n       perform these functions.\n       The protocol will provide negotiation\
    \ for session membership,\n       underlying communication topology and media\
    \ configuration.  In\n       particular, the protocol will support a user initiating\
    \ a\n       multimedia multiparty session with other users (\"calling\" other\n\
    \       users) over the Internet by allowing a teleconferencing\n       application\
    \ on one workstation to explicitly rendezvous with\n       teleconferencing applications\
    \ running on remote workstations.\n       Defining a standard protocol will enable\
    \ session-level\n       interoperability between different teleconferencing\n\
    \       implementations.\n       The focus of the working group is to design a\
    \ session negotiation\n       protocol that is tailored to support tightly-controlled\n\
    \       conferences.  The MBONE currently carries primarily loosely-\n       controlled\
    \ sessions, i.e., sessions with little to no interaction\n       among members\
    \ and with no arbitration facility, security, or\n       coordination of quality-of-service\
    \ options for time-critical\n       media.  Users may learn of available sessions\
    \ using the \"sd\"\n       utility or other out of band mechanisms (e.g., email).\
    \  However,\n       there is clearly also a need for tightly-controlled sessions\
    \ that\n       provide mechanisms for directly contacting other users to\n   \
    \    initiate a session and for negotiating conference parameters such\n     \
    \  as membership, media encodings and encryption keys.  In addition,\n       these\
    \ sessions should support renegotiation during a session, for\n       example\
    \ to add or delete members or change the media encoding.\n       It is possible\
    \ that the protocol will, in the limiting case, also\n       support loosely-controlled\
    \ sessions.\n       The main goal of the working group will be to specify the\
    \ session\n       control protocol for use within teleconferencing software over\n\
    \       the Internet.  The working group will focus on the aspects of the\n  \
    \     session control problem that are well understood, while keeping\n      \
    \ an eye on evolving research issues.  Toward this end, the working\n       group\
    \ has made an inventory of existing conferencing systems and\n       their session\
    \ control protocols.  The working group will document\n       the requirements\
    \ of the existing prototypes as a basis for the\n       protocol development.\
    \  The working group will iteratively refine\n       the protocol based on implementation\
    \ and operational experience.\n       Furthermore, the working group will coordinate\
    \ with other efforts\n       related to multimedia conferencing, such as directory\
    \ services\n       for cataloguing users and conferences, the RTP and RTCP protocols\n\
    \       developed by the Audio/Video Transport Working Group, resource\n     \
    \  reservation and management at the network level, and schemes for\n       multicast\
    \ address allocation.\n       Goals and Milestones:\n            May 93     Hold\
    \ an on-line working group meeting to discuss\n                       the conference\
    \ control framework, the relevant\n                       terminology, a functional\
    \ taxonomy and how\n                       different conversational styles place\n\
    \                       requirements on session protocols.\n            Jun 93\
    \     Submit the Conference Session Control Protocol to\n                    \
