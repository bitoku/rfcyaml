- title: 1.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "1.  Rationale\n   Although system port assignments exist for IRC traffic that\
    \ is plain\n   text (TCP/UDP port 194) or TLS/SSL encrypted (TCP/UDP port 994)\n\
    \   [IANALIST], it is common practice amongst IRC networks not to use\n   them\
    \ for reasons of convenience and general availability on systems\n   where no\
    \ root access is granted or desired.\n   IRC networks have defaulted to listening\
    \ on TCP port 6667 for plain\n   text connections for a considerable time now.\
    \  This is covered by the\n   IRCU assignment of TCP/UDP ports 6665-6669.\n  \
    \ Similar consensus has been reached within the IRC community about\n   listening\
    \ on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via\n   TLS/SSL [RFC5246].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Connection Establishment
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Connection Establishment\n   An IRC client connects to an IRC server. \
    \ Immediately after that, a\n   normal TLS/SSL handshake takes place.  Once the\
    \ TLS/SSL connection\n   has been established, a normal IRC connection is established\
    \ via the\n   tunnel.  Optionally, the IRC server may set a specific user mode\n\
    \   (umode) for the client, marking it as using TLS/SSL.  Again,\n   optionally,\
    \ an IRC server might offer the option to create channels\n   in such a way that\
    \ only clients connected via TLS/SSL may join.\n   For details on how IRC works,\
    \ see [RFC1459], [RFC2810], [RFC2811],\n   [RFC2812], and [RFC2813].  Please note\
    \ that IRC is extremely\n   fragmented, and implementation details can vary wildly.\
    \  Most\n   implementations regard the latter RFCs as suggestions, not as\n  \
    \ binding.\n"

    '
- title: 2.2.1.  Server Certificate
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Server Certificate\n   The IRC server's certificate should be issued\
    \ by a commonly trusted\n   certification authority (CA).\n   The Common Name\
    \ should match the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)\n   of the IRC server or\
    \ have appropriate wildcards, if applicable.\n   The IRC client should verify\
    \ the certificate.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Client Certificate
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Client Certificate\n   If the client is using a certificate as well,\
    \ it should be issued by\n   a commonly trusted CA or a CA designated by the IRC\
    \ network.\n   The certificate's Common Name should match the main IRC nickname.\n\
    \   If the network offers nick registration, this nick should be used.\n   If\
    \ the network offers grouped nicks, the main nick or account name\n   should be\
    \ used.\n   If the network offers nick registration, the client certificate\n\
    \   should be used to identify the user against the nick database.  See\n   [CERTFP]\
    \ for a possible implementation.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The lack of a common, well-established listening\
    \ port for IRC via\n   TLS/SSL could lead to end users being unaware of their\
    \ IRC network of\n   choice supporting TLS/SSL.  Thus, they might not use encryption\
    \ even\n   if they wanted to.\n   It should be noted that this document merely\
    \ describes client-to-\n   server encryption.  There are still other attack vectors\
    \ like\n   malicious administrators, compromised servers, insecure server-to-\n\
    \   server communication, channels that do not enforce encryption for all\n  \
    \ channel members, malicious clients, or comprised client machines on\n   which\
    \ logs are stored.\n   Those attacks can by their very nature not be addressed\
    \ by client-to-\n   server encryption.  Additional safeguards are needed if a\
    \ user fears\n   any of the threats above.\n   This document does not address\
    \ server links as there are no commonly\n   accepted ports or even back-end protocols.\
    \  Ports and back-end\n   protocols are normally established in a bilateral agreement.\
    \  All\n   operators are encouraged to use strong encryption for back-end\n  \
    \ traffic, no matter if they offer IRC via TLS/SSL to end users.\n"

    \ does not\n   support TLS/SSL via port 6697 and has no plans to support it. \
    \ All\n   others supported it already or are supporting it since being\n   contacted\
