  - "                 Comments on On-Line Host Name Service\n    Peter Deutsch in\
    \ RFC #606 pointed out the desirability of having a\nsingle host maintain a data\
    \ base containing official host names and host\naddresses, as well as other information\
    \ of secondary importance.  Mike\nKudlick in RFC #608 agreed with the concept,\
    \ and proposed that the NIC\nwould implement Peter's ideas.  I would like to add\
    \ my voice to those in\nsupport of such a service, and express a few ideas for\
    \ its modification.\n    The notion of having a single host maintain this data\
    \ base clearly\nhas the weakness that anyone wishing to obtain a copy of the data\
    \ may be\nfaced with the situation that the serving host is not available when\
    \ the\ndata is desired.  It is true that each host could save a copy of the\n\
    most recently obtained data, such that whenever a current copy cannot be\nobtained,\
    \ at least a very recent copy is available.  This is not a\nparticularly attractive\
    \ idea, since it requires a non-trivial amount of\nbother on the part of everyone.\
    \  Therefore, I propose that the NIC\nmaintain the master data base, and one other\
    \ host be responsible for\nmaintaining a secondary copy, which is to be updated\
    \ to be equal to the\nNIC's at periodic and often intervals, such as once a day.\
    \  This way,\nanyone wishing to obtain the data can first try the NIC, and if\
    \ that\nfails, try the secondary host, thus much reducing the probability that\n\
    the data cannot be obtained, while requiring additional software to be\nwritten\
    \ at only one additional host.  Further, I volunteer UCSB to be\nthat secondary\
    \ host.\n    The proposal currently underway calls for the host names data base\n\
    to have the format of ASCII file.  RFC 606 makes the point, with which I\ncompletely\
    \ agree, that this data base should be formatted in an easily\nmachine-readable\
    \ form.  To this end, I propose that the data base be\nretrievable in binary form\
    \ rather than ASCII.  Using this concept, for\nexample, <host-address> would be\
    \ a one-byte (eight-bit) binary number,\n<host-name> would be a one-byte length\
    \ field followed by that many ASCII\ncharacters, and the possible <attribute-values>'s\
    \ for the STATUS\n<attribute-name> would be one-byte binary numbers.  This modification\n\
    would clearly make the data base unintelligible to a human user, and,\njust as\
    \ clearly, much more easily interpreted by a program.\n    RFC 608 states that\
    \ the data base will be maintained as a file and\nretrievable through FTP.  I\
    \ question the wisdom of basing such a simple\nprocess as keeping a host table\
    \ up to date on such a complex protocol as\nFTP.  Therefore I propose that the\
    \ data base be available via a program\nrunning under its own socket at the NIC\
    \ and at the secondary host.  This\nalso avoids the necessity for the accessing\
    \ program to know the login\nparameters for the guest account at the serving host,\
    \ which in fact\nmight not be the same at the two hosts.  Again, the motivation\
    \ is to\nmake things easy for accessing programs.\n    Anyone with comments about\
    \ any of the above is encouraged to make\nthem known.\n       [ This RFC was put\
