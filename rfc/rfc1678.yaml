- title: Executive Overview
  contents:
  - "Executive Overview\n   As more and more corporations are using TCP/IP for their\
    \ mission-\n   critical applications, they are bringing additional requirements,\n\
    \   summarized below, the satisfaction of which would make TCP/IP even\n   more\
    \ appealing to businesses.  Since these are requirements rather\n   than solutions,\
    \ we include capabilities that might be provided in\n   protocol layers other\
    \ than the one that IPv4 occupies; i.e., these\n   items might lie outside the\
    \ scope typically envisioned for IPng, but\n   we'll refer to them as IPng requirements\
    \ nonetheless.  When we\n   mention potential solutions, it is not to suggest\
    \ that they are the\n   best approach, but merely to clarify the requirement.\n\
    \   Among business users the major requirements we see for IPng are:\n      --\
    \ smooth migration from, and coexistence with, IPv4;\n      -- predictable levels\
    \ of service for predictable costs;\n      -- security; and\n      -- accommodation\
    \ of multiple protocols suites.\n   We also mention several more specific requirements.\n\
    \   IPng must have a viable strategy for migration from, and coexistence\n   with,\
    \ IPv4.  IPv4 and IPng must coexist well, because they will need\n   to do so\
    \ for several years.  To encourage IPv4 users to upgrade to\n   IPng, IPng must\
    \ offer compelling advantages and an easy migration\n   path.\n   Corporate networks\
    \ must meet promised levels of service while\n   controlling costs through efficient\
    \ use of resources.  The IETF\n   should consider both technical solutions (such\
    \ as service classes and\n   priorities) and administrative ones (such as accounting)\
    \ to promote\n   economy.\n   Many businesses will not connect to a network until\
    \ they are\n   confident that it will not significantly threaten the\n   confidentiality,\
    \ integrity, or availability of their data.\n   Corporations tend to use multiple\
    \ protocols.  Numerous forces stymie\n   the desire to settle on just one protocol\
    \ for a large corporation:\n   diverse installed bases, skills, technical factors,\
    \ and the general\n   trend toward corporate decentralization.  The IETF needs\
    \ a strategy\n   for heterogeneity flexible enough to accommodate the principal\n\
    \   multiprotocol techniques, including multiprotocol transport,\n   tunneling,\
    \ and link sharing.\n   Some of these requirements might be satisfied by more\
    \ extensive\n   deployment of existing Internet architectures (e.g., Generic Security\n\
    \   Service and IPv4 type of service).  The current Internet protocols\n   could\
    \ be enhanced to satisfy most of the remaining requirements of\n   commercial\
    \ users while retaining IPv4.  Nevertheless, some\n   corporations will be scared\
    \ away from TCP/IP by the publicity about\n   the address space until the IETF\
    \ sets a direction for its expansion.\n"
- title: Migration and Coexistence
  contents:
  - "Migration and Coexistence\n   As the use of IPv4 continues to grow, the day may\
    \ come when no more\n   IPv4 network addresses will be left, and no additional\
    \ networks will\n   be able to connect to the Internet.  Classless Inter-Domain\
    \ Routing\n   (CIDR, RFC 1519) and careful gleaning of the address space will\n\
    \   postpone that cutoff for several years.  The hundreds of millions of\n   people\
    \ on networks that do get IPv4 addresses won't be affected\n   directly by the\
    \ exhaustion of the address space, but they will miss\n   the opportunity to communicate\
    \ with those less lucky.\n   Because the Internet is too large for all its users\
    \ to cutover to\n   IPng quickly, IPng must coexist well with IPv4.  Furthermore,\
    \ IPv4\n   users won't upgrade to IPng without a compelling reason.  Access to\n\
    \   new services will not be a strong motivation, since new services will\n  \
    \ want to support both the IPng users and the IPv4 users.  Only\n   services that\
    \ cannot exist on IPv4 will be willing to use IPng\n   exclusively.  Moreover,\
    \ if IPng requires more resources (e.g.,\n   storage, memory, or administrative\
    \ complexity) than IPv4, users will\n   not install IPng unless it has clear benefits\
    \ over IPv4.  Indeed, the\n   millions of users of low-end systems (DOS, sub-notebooks)\
    \ might not\n   ever be able to use IPng if it takes more memory.  Thus there\
    \ will be\n   a long period of coexistence between IPng and IPv4, so the\n   coexistence\
    \ needs to be quite painless, and not based on any\n   assumption that IPv4 use\
    \ will diminish quickly.\n"
- title: Service Level Agreements
  contents:
  - "Service Level Agreements\n   If a corporation depends on its network for applications\
    \ that are\n   critical to its business (such as airlines do for reservations,\
    \ and\n   brokerages do for stock and bond trades), then the corporation\n   insists\
    \ that the network provide the needed service level for a\n   predictable cost,\
    \ so they can allow for it in their budget ahead of\n   time.  A service level\
    \ agreement (SLA) is a contract between\n   network's provider and users that\
    \ defines the service level which a\n   user will see and the cost associated\
    \ with that level of service.\n   Measurements in an SLA may include response\
    \ times (average and\n   maximum), availability percentages, number of active\
    \ sessions,\n   throughput rates, etc..  Businesses need to be able to predict\
    \ and\n   guarantee the service levels and costs (routing capacity, link\n   bandwidth,\
    \ etc.) for their traffic patterns on a TCP/IP network.\n   IPng should allow\
    \ control of the cost of networking, a major concern\n   for corporations.  Teleprocessing\
    \ lines are a significant cost in\n   corporate networks.  Although the cost per\
    \ bit-per-second tends to be\n   lower on higher-bandwidth links, high-bandwidth\
    \ links can be hard to\n   get, particularly in emerging nations. In many places\
    \ it is difficult\n   to acquire a 64 kpbs line, and T1 service might not exist.\n\
    \   Furthermore, lead times can be over six months.  Even in the US the\n   cost\
    \ of transcontinental T1 service is high enough to encourage high\n   utilization.\
    \  Cost-conscious businesses want IPng to allow high\n   utilization of teleprocessing\
    \ links, but without requiring excessive\n   processing power to achieve the high\
    \ utilization.  There has been\n   considerable speculation concerning the goodput\
    \ through congested\n   routes when using the Internet's current congestion control\n\
    \   algorithms; instead, it should be measured in a range of realistic\n   cases.\
    \  If peak-busy-hour goodput under congestion is near the\n   theoretical maximum,\
    \ publicize the data and move on to other\n   requirements.  If not, then the\
    \ IETF should seek a better standard\n   (e.g., they might explore XTP's adaptive\
    \ rate-based approach and\n   other proposals).\n   Functions, such as class of\
    \ service and priority, that let an\n   enterprise control use of bandwidth also\
    \ may help meet service level\n   agreements.  On the one hand, it has been said\
    \ that the absence of\n   these inhibits TCP/IP usage in corporate networks, especially\
    \ when\n   predictable interactive response times are required.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, few vendors have felt motivated to implement TCP's architected\n   type-of-service,\
    \ and priority tends to be handled in a non-standard\n   way (e.g., to assure\
    \ that interactive well-known ports, such as\n   Telnet, get faster response times\
    \ than non-interactive well-known\n   ports, such as file transfer).  The IETF\
    \ should sort out these\n   apparently conflicting perspectives.  If the ad hoc\
    \ techniques can be\n   demonstrated to be adequate, then they should be standardized;\n\
    \   otherwise, effective techniques should be developed and standardized.\n  \
    \ Commercial users often require the options of a higher level of\n   service\
    \ for a higher cost, or a lower level of service for a lower\n   cost; e.g., some\
    \ businesses pay top dollar to assure fast response\n   time during business hours,\
    \ but choose less expensive satellite\n   services for data backup during the\
    \ night.  Pervasive use of IPv4's\n   type-of-service markings might satisfy this\
    \ requirement.\n   To discourage waste of bandwidth and other expensive resources,\n\
    \   corporations want to account for their use.  Direct cost recovery\n   would\
    \ let an entity measure and benchmark its efficiency with minimal\n   economic\
    \ distortion.  Alternatives, such as placing these costs into\n   corporate overhead\
    \ or charging per connection, make sense when the\n   administrative cost of implementing\
    \ usage-based accounting is high\n   enough to introduce more economic distortion\
    \ than the alternatives\n   would.  For example, connection-based costs alone\
    \ may be adequate for\n   a resource (such as LAN bandwidth) that is not scarce\
    \ or expensive,\n   but a combination of a connection cost and a usage cost may\
    \ be more\n   appropriate for a more scarce  or expensive resource (such as WAN\n\
    \   bandwidth).  Balance must be maintained between the overhead of\n   accounting\
    \ and the granularity of cost allocation.\n"

  - "Security\n   Many corporations will stick with their private networks until public\n\
    \   ones can guarantee equivalent confidentiality, integrity, and\n   availability.\
    \  It is not clear that additional architecture is needed\n   to satisfy this\
    \ requirement;  perhaps more wide spread use of\n   existing security technology\
    \ would suffice.  For example, the\n   Internet could encourage wide deployment\
    \ of Generic Security Service,\n   and then solicit feedback on whether additional\
    \ security requirements\n   need to be satisfied.  Note that businesses are so\
    \ concerned about\n   network cost control mechanisms that they want them secured\
    \ against\n   tampering.  IPng should not interfere with firewalls, which many\n\
    \   corporations consider essential.\n"
- title: Heterogeneity
  contents:
  - "Heterogeneity\n   Corporate users want the Internet to accommodate multiple protocol\n\
    \   suites.  Several different protocol suites are growing in use, and\n   some\
    \ older ones will be used for many more years.  Although many\n   people wish\
    \ there were only one protocol in the world, there is\n   little agreement on\
    \ which one it should be.\n   Since the marketplace has not settled on one approach\
    \ to handling\n   multiple protocols, IPng should be flexible enough to accommodate\
    \ a\n   variety of technical approaches to achieving heterogeneity.  For\n   example,\
    \ most networking protocols assume they will be the dominate\n   protocol that\
    \ transports all others;  protocol designers should pay\n   more attention to\
    \ making their protocols easily transported by\n   others.  IPng needs to be flexible\
    \ enough to accommodate the major\n   multiprotocol trends, including multiprotocol\
    \ transport networking\n   (for an example, see X/OPEN document G306), tunneling\
    \ (both IP being\n   the tunnel and being tunneled), and link sharing (e.g., point-to-\n\
    \   point protocol and frame relay).  Fair sharing of bandwidth by\n   protocols\
    \ with different congestion control mechanisms is a\n   particularly interesting\
    \ subject.\n"
- title: Flow and Resource Reservation
  contents:
  - "Flow and Resource Reservation\n   Corporate users are becoming more interested\
    \ in transmitting both\n   non-isochronous and isochronous information together\
    \ across the same\n   link.  IPng should coexist effectively with the isochronous\
    \ protocols\n   being developed for the Internet.\n   The Internet protocols should\
    \ take advantage of services that may be\n   offered by an underlying fast packet\
    \ switching service. Constant-\n   bit-rate and variable-bit-rate services typically\
    \ require\n   specification of, and conformance to, traffic descriptors and\n\
    \   specification of quality-of-service objectives from applications or\n   users.\
    \  The Internet's isochronous protocols should provide\n   mechanisms to take\
    \ advantage of multimedia services that will be\n   offered by fast packet switching\
    \ networks, and must ensure that\n   quality-of-service guarantees are preserved\
    \ all the way up the\n   protocol stacks to the applications.  Protocols using\
    \ available-bit-\n   rate services may achieve better bandwidth utilization if\
    \ they react\n   to congestion messages from a fast packet switching network,\
    \ and if\n   they consider consequences of cell discard (e.g., if one cell of\
    \ an\n   IP datagram is discarded, it would be a waste to continue forwarding\n\
    \   the rest of the cells in that datagram; also, selective retransmit\n   should\
    \ be revisited in this context).\n   When the Internet protocol suite allows mixing\
    \ of non-isochronous and\n   isochronous traffic on one medium, it should provide\
    \ mechanisms to\n   discourage inappropriate reservation of resources; e.g., a\
    \ Telnet\n   connection probably doesn't need to reserve 45Mbps.  Accounting,\n\
    \   class-of-service, and well-known-port distinctions are possible ways\n   to\
    \ satisfy that requirement.\n"

  - "Mobile Hosts\n   Wireless technology opens up opportunities for new TCP/IP\n\
    \   applications that are specific to mobile hosts.  In addition to\n   coordinating\
    \ with organizations developing wireless standards, the\n   IETF also should encourage\
    \ the specification of new TCP/IP\n   applications enabled by wireless, such as\
    \ connectionless messaging.\n   IPng should deal well with the characteristics\
    \ (delay, error rates4,\n   etc.) peculiar to wireless.\n"
- title: Topological flexibility
  contents:
  - "Topological flexibility\n   Today a TCP/IP host moved to a different subnet needs\
    \ a new IP\n   address.  Such moves and changes can become a significant\n   administrative\

    \ world is trying to defeat the subnet\n   model of addressing either by proxy\
    \ or by IPaddress servers.  Perhaps\n   IPng needs an addressing model more flexible\
    \ than subnetting, both to\n   reduce the administrative burden and to facilitate\
    \ roaming users.\n   The need to eliminate single points of failure drives the\
    \ business\n   requirement for multi-tail attachment of hosts to networks.\n \
    \  Corporate users complain that TCP/IP can non-disruptively switch a\n   connection\
    \ from a broken route to a working one only if the new route\n   leads to the\
    \ same adapter on the end system.\n"

- title: Policy-Based Routing

  - "Policy-Based Routing\n   Policy-based routing is a more a solution than a requirement.\n\
    \   Businesses rarely require a general purpose policy architecture,\n   although\
    \ they do state requirements that policy-based routing could\n   satisfy.  For\
    \ example, corporations do not want to carry for free the\n   transit traffic\
    \ of other enterprises, and they may not want their\n   sensitive data to flow\
    \ through links controlled by certain other\n   enterprises.  Policy-based routing\
    \ is one possible way to satisfy\n   those requirements, but there seems to be\

    \ growth, but in RFC 1518 Tony Li and Yakov Rehkter have shown\n   that from a\
    \ technical perspective the addressing issue of IPng is not\n   an immediate concern.\n\
    \   Nevertheless, the TCP/IP community should establish a direction for\n   enlargement\
    \ of the address space, because unfounded publicity about\n   the address space\
    \ is scaring away potential TCP/IP users.  If the\n   IETF does not provide direction\
