- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol, as specified in [ISO-10589], provides\
    \ for the\n   authentication of Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) through\
    \ the\n   inclusion of authentication information as part of the LSP.  This\n\
    \   authentication information is encoded as a Type-Length-Value (TLV)\n   tuple.\
    \  The use of IS-IS for IPv4 networks is described in [RFC1195].\n   The type\
    \ of the TLV is specified as 10.  The length of the TLV is\n   variable.  The\
    \ value of the TLV depends on the authentication\n   algorithm and related secrets\
    \ being used.  The first octet of the\n   value is used to specify the authentication\
    \ type.  Type 0 is\n   reserved, type 1 indicates a cleartext password, and type\
    \ 255 is used\n   for routing domain private authentication methods.  The remainder\
    \ of\n   the TLV value is known as the Authentication Value.\n   This document\
    \ extends the above situation by allocating a new\n   authentication type for\
    \ HMAC-MD5 and specifying the algorithms for\n   the computation of the Authentication\
    \ Value.  This document also\n   describes modifications to the base protocol\
    \ to ensure that the\n   authentication mechanisms described in this document\
    \ are effective.\n   This document is a publication of the IS-IS Working Group\
    \ within the\n   IETF.  This document replaces [RFC3567], which is an Informational\n\
    \   RFC.  This document is on the Standards Track.  This document has\n   revised\
    \ Section 3, with the significant addition of a discussion of\n   recent attacks\
    \ on MD5 in Section 3.2.  This document has also added a\n   substantive \"IANA\
    \ Considerations\" section to create a missing\n   codepoint registry.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Authentication Procedures
  contents:
  - "2.  Authentication Procedures\n   The authentication type used for HMAC-MD5 is\
    \ 54 (0x36).  The length\n   of the Authentication Value for HMAC-MD5 is 16, and\
    \ the length field\n   in the TLV is 17.\n   The HMAC-MD5 algorithm requires a\
    \ key K and text T as input\n   [RFC2104].  The key K is the password for the\
    \ PDU type, as specified\n   in ISO 10589.  The text T is the IS-IS PDU to be\
    \ authenticated with\n   the Authentication Value field (inside of the Authentication\n\
    \   Information TLV) set to zero.  Note that the Authentication Type is\n   set\
    \ to 54 and the length of the TLV is set to 17 before\n   authentication is computed.\
    \  When LSPs are authenticated, the\n   Checksum and Remaining Lifetime fields\
    \ are set to zero (0) before\n   authentication is computed.  The result of the\
    \ algorithm is placed in\n   the Authentication Value field.\n   When calculating\
    \ the HMAC-MD5 result for Sequence Number PDUs, Level\n   1 Sequence Number PDUs\
    \ SHALL use the Area Authentication string as in\n   Level 1 Link State PDUs.\
    \  Level 2 Sequence Number PDUs SHALL use the\n   domain authentication string\
    \ as in Level 2 Link State PDUs.  IS-IS\n   Hello PDUs SHALL use the Link Level\
    \ Authentication String, which MAY\n   be different from that of Link State PDUs.\
    \  The HMAC-MD5 result for\n   the IS-IS Hello PDUs SHALL be calculated after\
    \ the packet is padded\n   to the MTU size, if padding is not disabled.  Implementations\
    \ that\n   support the optional checksum for the Sequence Number PDUs and IS-IS\n\
    \   Hello PDUs MUST NOT include the Checksum TLV.\n   To authenticate an incoming\
    \ PDU, a system should save the values of\n   the Authentication Value field,\
    \ the Checksum field, and the Remaining\n   Lifetime field, set these fields to\
    \ zero, compute authentication, and\n   then restore the values of these fields.\n\
    \   An implementation that implements HMAC-MD5 authentication and\n   receives\
    \ HMAC-MD5 Authentication Information MUST discard the PDU if\n   the Authentication\
    \ Value is incorrect.\n   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it\
    \ includes HMAC-\n   MD5 Authentication Information in PDUs but does not verify\
    \ the HMAC-\n   MD5 Authentication Information.  This is a transition aid for\n\
    \   networks in the process of deploying authentication.\n   An implementation\
    \ MAY check a set of passwords when verifying the\n   Authentication Value.  This\
    \ provides a mechanism for incrementally\n   changing passwords in a network.\n\
    \   An implementation that does not implement HMAC-MD5 authentication MAY\n  \
    \ accept a PDU that contains the HMAC-MD5 Authentication Type.  ISes\n   (routers)\
    \ that implement HMAC-MD5 authentication and initiate LSP\n   purges MUST remove\
    \ the body of the LSP and add the authentication\n   TLV.  ISes implementing HMAC-MD5\
    \ authentication MUST NOT accept\n   unauthenticated purges.  ISes MUST NOT accept\
    \ purges that contain\n   TLVs other than the authentication TLV.  These restrictions\
    \ are\n   necessary to prevent a hostile system from receiving an LSP, setting\n\
    \   the Remaining Lifetime field to zero, and flooding it, thereby\n   initiating\
    \ a purge without knowing the authentication password.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Implementation Considerations\n   There is an implementation issue that\
    \ occurs just after password\n   rollover on an IS-IS router and that might benefit\
    \ from additional\n   commentary.  Immediately after password rollover on the\
    \ router, the\n   router or IS-IS process may restart.  If this happens, this\
    \ causes\n   the LSP Sequence Number to restart from the value 1 using the new\n\
    \   password.  However, neighbors will reject those new LSPs because the\n   Sequence\
    \ Number is smaller.  The router cannot increase its own LSP\n   Sequence Number\
    \ because it fails to authenticate its own old LSP that\n   neighbors keep sending\
    \ to it.  So the router cannot update its LSP\n   Sequence Number to its neighbors\
    \ until all the neighbors time out all\n   of the original LSPs.  One possible\
    \ solution to this problem is for\n   the IS-IS process to detect if any inbound\
    \ LSP with an authentication\n   failure has the local System ID and also has\
    \ a higher Sequence Number\n   than the IS-IS process has.  In this event, the\
    \ IS-IS process SHOULD\n   increase its own LSP Sequence Number accordingly and\
    \ re-flood the\n   LSPs.  However, as this scenario could also be triggered by\
    \ an active\n   attack by an adversary, it is recommended that a counter be kept\
    \ on\n   this case to mitigate the risk from such an attack.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document enhances the security of the IS-IS\
    \ routing protocol.\n   Because a routing protocol contains information that need\
    \ not be kept\n   secret, privacy is not a requirement.  However, authentication\
    \ of the\n   messages within the protocol is of interest in order to reduce the\n\
    \   risk of an adversary compromising the routing system by deliberately\n   injecting\
    \ false information into that system.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Security Limitations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Security Limitations\n   The technology in this document provides an authentication\
    \ mechanism\n   for IS-IS.  The mechanism described here is not perfect and does\
    \ not\n   need to be perfect.  Instead, this mechanism represents a significant\n\
    \   increase in the work function of an adversary attacking the IS-IS\n   protocol,\
    \ while not causing undue implementation, deployment, or\n   operational complexity.\
    \  It provides improved security against\n   passive attacks, as defined in [RFC1704],\
    \ when compared to cleartext\n   password authentication.\n   This mechanism does\
    \ not prevent replay attacks; however, in most\n   cases, such attacks would trigger\
    \ existing mechanisms in the IS-IS\n   protocol that would effectively reject\
    \ old information.  Denial-of-\n   service attacks are not generally preventable\
    \ in a useful networking\n   protocol [DoS].\n   The mechanisms in this document\
    \ do not provide protection against\n   compromised, malfunctioning, or misconfigured\
    \ routers.  Such routers\n   can, either accidentally or deliberately, cause malfunctions\
    \ that\n   affect the whole routing domain.  The reader is encouraged to consult\n\
    \   [RFC4593] for a more comprehensive description of threats to routing\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Assurance
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Assurance\n   Users need to understand that the quality of the security\
    \ provided by\n   this mechanism depends completely on the strength of the implemented\n\
    \   authentication algorithms, the strength of the key being used, and\n   the\
    \ correct implementation of the security mechanism in all\n   communicating IS-IS\
    \ implementations.  This mechanism also depends on\n   the IS-IS Authentication\
    \ Key being kept confidential by all parties.\n   If any of these are incorrect\
    \ or insufficiently secure, then no real\n   security will be provided to the\
    \ users of this mechanism.\n   Since Dobbertin's attacks on MD5 [Dobb96a] [Dobb96b]\
    \ [Dobb98] were\n   first published a dozen years ago, there have been growing\
    \ concerns\n   about the effectiveness of the compression function within MD5.\
    \  More\n   recent work by Wang and Yu [WY05] accentuates these concerns.\n  \
    \ However, despite these research results, there are no published\n   attacks\
    \ at present on either Keyed-MD5 or HMAC-MD5.  A recent paper\n   by Bellare [Bell06a]\
    \ [Bell06b] provides new proofs for the security\n   of HMAC that require fewer\
    \ assumptions than previous published proofs\n   for HMAC.  Those proofs indicate\
    \ that the published issues with MD5\n   (and separately with SHA-1) do not create\
    \ an attack on HMAC-MD5 (or\n   HMAC SHA-1).  Most recently, Fouque and others\
    \ [FLN07] have published\n   new attacks on NMAC-MD4, HMAC-MD4, and NMAC-MD5.\
    \  However, their\n   attacks are non-trivial computationally, and they have not\
    \ found an\n   equivalent attack on HMAC-MD5.  So, despite the published issues\
    \ with\n   the MD5 algorithm, there is currently no published attack that\n  \
    \ applies to HMAC-MD5 as used in this IS-IS specification.  As with any\n   cryptographic\
    \ technique, there is the possibility of the discovery of\n   future attacks against\
    \ this mechanism.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Key Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Key Configuration\n   It should be noted that the key configuration mechanism\
    \ of routers\n   may restrict the possible keys that may be used between peers.\
    \  It is\n   strongly recommended that an implementation be able to support, at\n\
    \   minimum, a key composed of a string of printable ASCII of 80 bytes or\n  \
    \ less, as this is current practice.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Other Considerations\n   Changes to the authentication mechanism described\
    \ here (primarily: to\n   add a Key-ID field such as that of OSPFv2 and RIPv2)\
    \ were considered\n   at some length, but ultimately were rejected.  The mechanism\
    \ here was\n   already widely implemented in 1999.  As of this writing, this\n\
    \   mechanism is fairly widely deployed within the users interested in\n   cryptographic\
    \ authentication of IS-IS.  The improvement provided by\n   the proposed revised\
    \ mechanism was not large enough to justify the\n   change, given the installed\
    \ base and lack of operator interest in\n   deploying a revised mechanism.\n \
    \  If and when a key management protocol appears that is both widely\n   implemented\
    \ and easily deployed to secure routing protocols such as\n   IS-IS, a different\
    \ authentication mechanism that is designed for use\n   with that key management\
    \ schema could be added if desired.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Future Directions
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Future Directions\n   If a stronger authentication were believed to be\
    \ required, then the\n   use of a full digital signature [RFC2154] would be an\
    \ approach that\n   should be seriously considered.  It was rejected for this\
    \ purpose at\n   this time because the computational burden of full digital signatures\n\
    \   is believed to be much higher than is reasonable, given the current\n   threat\
    \ environment in operational commercial networks.\n   If and when additional authentication\
    \ mechanisms are defined (for\n   example, to provide a cryptographically stronger\
    \ hash function), it\n   will also be necessary to define mechanisms that allow\
    \ graceful\n   transition from the existing mechanisms (as defined in this document)\n\
    \   to any future mechanism.\n"
