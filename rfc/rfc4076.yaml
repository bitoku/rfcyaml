- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [2]\
    \ are able to\n   configure their IPv6 address and default router settings\n \
    \  automatically.  Although Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for IPv6\n   allows\
    \ automatic configuration of these settings, it does not provide\n   a mechanism\
    \ for additional non IP-address settings to be configured\n   automatically.\n\
    \   The full version of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6)\
    \ [3] is designed to provide both stateful address assignment\n   to IPv6 hosts,\
    \ as well as additional (non IP-address) configuration\n   including DNS, NTP,\
    \ and other specific settings.  A full stateful\n   DHCPv6 server allocates the\
    \ addresses and maintains the clients'\n   bindings to keep track of client leases.\n\
    \   If hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for IPv6 wish to\n   configure\
    \ their DNS, NTP, or other specific settings automatically,\n   the stateless\
    \ variant [4] of DHCPv6 could be used.  This variant is\n   more lightweight.\
    \  It does not do address assignment; instead, it\n   only provides additional\
    \ configuration parameters, such as DNS\n   resolver addresses.  It does not maintain\
    \ dynamic state about the\n   information assigned to clients, and therefore there\
    \ is no need to\n   maintain dynamic per-client state on the server.\n   This\
    \ combination of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and stateless\n   DHCPv6\
    \ could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   A problem, however, lies in the ability, or lack of\
    \ ability, of\n   clients using this combination to be informed of (or to deduce)\n\
    \   changes in DHCPv6-assigned settings.\n   While a DHCPv6 server unicasts Reconfigure\
    \ messages to individual\n   clients to trigger them to initiate Information-request/reply\n\
    \   configuration exchanges to update their configuration settings, the\n   stateless\
    \ variant of DHCPv6 cannot use the Reconfigure mechanism\n   because it does not\
    \ maintain a list of IP addresses (leases) to send\n   the unicast messages to.\
    \  Note that in DHCPv6, Reconfigure messages\n   must be unicast; multicast is\
    \ not allowed.\n   Thus, events including the following cannot be handled:\n \
    \  o  Full site renumbering\n   o  DNS server change of address\n   o  NTP server\
    \ change of address\n   o  A change in DNS search paths\n   It would be highly\
    \ desirable that a host using the combination of\n   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\
    \ and stateless DHCPv6 could handle\n   a renumbering or reconfiguration event,\
    \ whether planned or unplanned\n   by the network administrator.\n   Note that\
    \ the scope of the problem could extend beyond Stateless\n   DHCPv6, since only\
    \ IP address options have a lifetime; i.e., there is\n   no mechanism even in\
    \ the full DHCPv6 that \"expires\" old information\n   or otherwise forces a client\
    \ to recheck that new/updated information\n   is available.  However, with full\
    \ DHCPv6, a node may learn of updates\n   to non-address options when renewing\
    \ its address lease.\n"
- title: 3.  Renumbering Scenarios
  contents:
  - "3.  Renumbering Scenarios\n   There are two main scenarios for changes to DHCPv6-assigned\
    \ settings\n   that would require the client to initiate an Information-request/\n\
    \   reply exchange to update the configuration.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Site Renumbering
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Site Renumbering\n   One of the fundamental principles of IPv6 is that\
    \ sites receive their\n   IPv6 address allocations from an ISP using provider-assigned\
    \ (PA)\n   address space.  There is currently no provider-independent (PI)\n \
    \  address space in IPv6.  Therefore, a site changing its ISP must\n   renumber\
    \ its network.  Any such site renumbering will require hosts\n   to reconfigure\
    \ both their own address and default router settings and\n   their stateless DHCPv6-assigned\
    \ settings.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Changes to a DHCPv6-assigned Setting
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Changes to a DHCPv6-assigned Setting\n   An administrator may need to change\
    \ one or more stateless\n   DHCPv6-assigned settings; e.g., an NTP server, DNS\
    \ server, or the DNS\n   search path.  This may be required if a new, additional\
    \ DNS server is\n   brought online and is moved to a new network (prefix), or\
    \ if an\n   existing server is decommissioned or known to be unavailable.\n"
- title: 4.  Renumbering Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Renumbering Requirements\n   Ideally, any of the above scenarios should be\
    \ handled automatically\n   by the hosts on the network.  For this to be realised,\
    \ a method is\n   required whereby the hosts are informed that they should request\
    \ new\n   stateless DHCPv6-assigned setting information.\n   The solution to the\
    \ problem may depend on whether the renumbering or\n   configuration change is\
    \ planned or unplanned, from the perspective of\n   the network administrator.\
    \  There is already work underway toward\n   understanding the planned renumbering\
    \ [5] scenario for IPv6 networks.\n   However, there is currently no mechanism\
    \ in stateless DHCPv6 for\n   handling planned renumbering events.\n"
- title: 5.  Considerations in Choosing a Solution
  contents:
  - "5.  Considerations in Choosing a Solution\n   A number of considerations could\
    \ be listed for a desirable solution:\n   o  The solution should support planned\
    \ renumbering; it is desirable\n      that it also supports unplanned renumbering.\n\
    \   o  Security is important.  No new security concerns should be\n      introduced\
    \ to Stateless DHCPv6 by the solution.\n   o  It must be possible to update options,\
    \ even if the network is not\n      renumbered.\n   o  It is desirable to maintain\
    \ the \"stateless\" property; i.e., no\n      per-client state should need to\
    \ be kept in the server.\n"
- title: 6.  Solution Space
  contents:
  - "6.  Solution Space\n   Solutions should be designed and presented in a separate\
    \ document.\n   An initial brief set of candidate solutions might include the\n\
    \   following:\n   o  Add a Reconfigure message mechanism that would work in the\n\
    \      stateless DHCPv6 environment.  This could enable planned or\n      unplanned\
    \ events, but may require a multicast mechanism in order\n      to be realised.\n\
    \   o  Convey a valid lifetime timer to clients for stateless DHCPv6-\n      assigned\
    \ settings.  This could primarily enable planned events,\n      but with a small\
    \ time-out it could handle unplanned events to some\n      extent at the expense\
    \ of the additional request traffic.  The\n      selection of recommended lifetime\
    \ values/ranges would be the\n      subject of future work.\n   o  Use some form\
    \ of Router Advertisement (RA) [1] as a hint to\n      request new stateless DHCPv6-assigned\
    \ settings.  Using only an\n      observed new RA prefix as a hint to re-request\
    \ settings would not\n      handle changes that are purely to NTP, DNS, or other\
    \ options.\n      Other possible means of detection of network (re)attachment\
    \ could\n      also be used as cues (e.g., see Goals of Detecting Network\n  \
    \    Attachment (DNA) in IPv6 [6]).\n   o  Change the semantics of the 'O' flag\
    \ in RAs [2] so that toggling\n      its value may trigger an Information-request\
    \ message.\n   There will also be conditions under which a client should send\
    \ an\n   Information-request, such as reconnection to a link.  Recommendations\n\
    \   for these cases are outside the scope of this document, but we expect\n  \
    \ ongoing work in the DNA WG (as scoped in Goals of Detecting Network\n   Attachment\
    \ (DNA) in IPv6 [6]) to yield recommendations.\n"
- title: 7.  Summary
  contents:
  - "7.  Summary\n   This document presents a problem statement for how IPv6 hosts\
    \ that\n   use the combination of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and\n  \
    \ stateless DHCPv6 may be informed of renumbering events or other\n   changes\
    \ to the settings that they originally learned through\n   stateless DHCPv6. \
    \ A short list of candidate solutions is presented,\n   which the authors hope\
    \ will be expanded upon in subsequent documents.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no security considerations in this\
    \ problem statement per\n   se.  However, whatever mechanism is designed or chosen\
    \ to address\n   this problem should avoid introducing new security concerns for\n\
    \   (stateless) DHCPv6.\n   The issues of maintaining appropriate security through\
    \ a renumbering\n   event are outside the scope of this document (if specific\
    \ servers\n   within the network are being added or removed, firewall\n   configurations\
    \ and ACLs, for example, will need to reflect this).\n   However, this is an important\
    \ area for further work.\n"
