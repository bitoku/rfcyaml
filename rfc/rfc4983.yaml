    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a
    bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.
    \ Fibre Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols
    such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n   Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol), IEEE 802.2,
    and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple\n
    \  communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a\n   switching
    network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n   Fibre Channel \"node\"
    consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist of multiple Interconnect
    Elements, some of which are\n   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via
    a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected
    to a single\n   port on a switch via an \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch
    port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n
    \  term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term
    Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port,
    which is interconnected to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL),
    is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on
    a switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre
    Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have
    globally unique names.  These globally unique names\n   are typically formatted
    as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].
    \ WWNs are expected to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre
    Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n   the frame's
    source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address identifier
    and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the FC\n   address identifiers are dynamically
    assigned by a switch.  Each octet\n   of a 24-bit address represents a level in
    an address hierarchy, with\n   a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.\n
    \  Registered State Change Notifications (RSCNs) are defined in [FC-LS]\n   as
    a means to provide Nx_Ports that have registered to receive such\n   notifications
    with a timely indication of changes in the state of\n   nodes attached to the
    fabric.  Specifically, an Nx_Port may choose to\n   register, using a State Change
    Registration (SCR) request [FC-LS] to\n   receive RSCNs.  When an event occurs
    that may affect a registered\n   Nx_Port's port's state, the registered Nx_Port
    will receive an RSCN.\n   For example, an Nx_Port can use RSCNs as the means by
    which it is\n   informed of the failures of other nodes, of new devices coming\n
    \  online, or even of more network-accessible storage becoming\n   available.
    \ The payload of the RSCN indicates the type of change and\n   includes the address
    of the changed port.  RSCNs are often generated\n   by the fabric, but an Nx_Port
    can also generate (and send to the\n   fabric) an RSCN if and when it detects
    an event not visible to the\n   fabric.  The sender of an RSCN may coalesce several
    events into a\n   single RSCN message.  Each RSCN is a \"request\" that is acknowledged\n
    \  by the receiver with an accept or reject.\n   An RSCN is received by an Nx_Port
    from the Fabric as an Extended Link\n   Service (ELS) request [FC-LS].  The Fabric
    distributes RSCNs between\n   Switches using an SW_ILS frame with an Inter-Switch
    RSCN payload,\n   also known as an SW_RSCN [FC-SW-4].  So, when a Switch has directly\n
    \  attached Nx_Ports that have registered to receive RSCNs, it converts\n   received
    SW_RSCNs (i.e., SW_ILS frames containing SW_RSCN payloads)\n   into ELS requests
    containing the corresponding RSCN which it sends to\n   each such Nx_Port.\n   The
    latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple\n   Fabric Switch
    elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the\n   earlier specification
    for the operation of a single Fabric in a\n   physical infrastructure, and augments
    it with the definition of\n   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how
    multiple Virtual\n   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.\n
    \  The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in\n   its
    header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that\n   frame is being
    transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular\n   \"Core Switch\" [FC-SW-4]
    (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual\n   Fabric are processed by the
    same \"Virtual Switch\" within that Core\n   Switch.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel
    [RFC2837] was focused on\n   Fibre Channel switches.  It was replaced by the more
    generic Fibre\n   Channel Management MIB [RFC4044] which defines basic information
    for\n   Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the\n   standard
    [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.  [RFC4044] includes\n   the specification
    of how the generic objects defined in [IF-MIB]\n   apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.\n
    \  This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions defined in the\n   T11-TC-MIB
    [RFC4439] and in the T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [RFC4438].\n"
  title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
- contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management
    instance,\n   a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.  It also describes the four
    MIB\n   groups contained in the MIB.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance
      is defined in [RFC4044] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel
      functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel
      management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).
      \ For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having
      multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a
      different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely
      identify each Fibre Channel\n   management instance, for example, within the
      same SNMP context\n   ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).\n"
    title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Switch Index\n   The FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044] defines the fcmSwitchTable
      as a table of\n   information about Fibre Channel switches which are managed
      by Fibre\n   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance\n
      \  can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,\n   fcmSwitchIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value\n   to uniquely identify
      a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or\n   more) managed by the same Fibre
      Channel management instance.\n"
    title: 5.2.  Switch Index
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   Whether operating on a Physical Fabric (i.e., without
      Virtual\n   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the manner of operation of
      RSCNs\n   within a/each Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all\n
      \  Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary\n   integer,
      named a \"Fabric Index\", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from\n   the T11-TC-MIB
      [RFC4439].  When a device is connected to a single\n   Physical Fabric, without
      use of any Virtual Fabrics, the value of\n   this Fabric Index will always be
      1.  In an environment of multiple\n   Virtual and/or Physical Fabrics, this
      index provides a means to\n   distinguish one Fabric from another.\n   It is
      quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel\n   switch will
      have ports connected to multiple Virtual and/or Physical\n   Fabrics.  Thus,
      in order to simplify a management protocol query\n   concerning all the Fabrics
      to which a single switch is connected,\n   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before
      t11FcRscnFabricIndex when they\n   both appear in the same INDEX clause.\n"
    title: 5.3.  Fabric Index
  - contents:
    - "5.4.  The t11FcRscnRegistrationGroup Group\n   This group contains information
      about the Nx_Ports which have\n   registered to receive RSCNs.\n"
    title: 5.4.  The t11FcRscnRegistrationGroup Group
  - contents:
    - "5.5.  The t11FcRscnNotifyGroup Group\n   This group contains two notifications:
      one generated when a switch\n   rejects an SCR or RSCN; the other when a switch
      rejects an SW_RSCN.\n"
    - contents:
      - "5.5.1.  Flow-Control for Notifications\n   When defining SNMP notifications
        for events that occur in the data-\n   plane, the maximum frequency of their
        generation needs to be\n   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor,
        such notifications\n   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined
        such that after\n   some maximum number within a specified time interval have
        occurred,\n   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time\n
        \  interval.  However, when such a suppression occurs, the Network\n   Management
        System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications\n   (because they were
        suppressed) needs to be able to obtain an\n   indication of how many were
        suppressed.  Therefore, an additional\n   Counter32 object needs to be defined,
        and/or a new type of\n   notification needs to be defined for use at the end
        of the interval.\n   While this is extra complexity, it is necessary for notifications\n
        \  that need to be flow-controlled.\n   In contrast, for notifications such
        as both the ones defined in this\n   MIB module, which are generated due to
        control-plane events (and are\n   not able to start a chain reaction), the
        extra complexity of flow-\n   controlling these types of notifications is
        not warranted.\n"

  - contents:
    - "5.6.  The t11FcRscnNotifyControlGroup Group\n   This group contains one object
      for each notification in the\n   t11FcRscnNotifyGroup group to enable/disable
      that notification, as\n   well as three objects that record information about
      the latest\n   rejection of an SCR, RSCN or SW_RSCN.  Specifically, they record
      the\n   content (if available) of the rejected request, the source of the\n
      \  rejected request, and the reason for the rejection.\n"
    title: 5.6.  The t11FcRscnNotifyControlGroup Group
  - contents:
    - "5.7.  The t11FcRscnStatsGroup Group\n   This group contains RSCN-related statistics.
      \ Two levels of\n   statistics are included:\n      1) counters at the message-type
      level, for:\n         - the number of SCRs received/rejected,\n         - the
      number of RSCNs sent/received/rejected,\n         - the number of SW_RSCNs sent/received/rejected.\n
      \     2) counters for each different category of sent/received RSCNs,\n         where
      different categories are indicated by different values of\n         the 'Event
      Qualifier' contained in an RSCN message.  Note that\n         if and when several
      RSCN events are coalesced into a single\n         RSCN message, then that message
      may be counted in more than one\n         of these counters.  No counters are
      defined in this MIB for the\n         'Event Qualifier' value of '0001'b (meaning
      \"Changed Name\n         Server Object\") because these types of RSCNs are counted
      by the\n         t11NsInRscns and t11NsOutRscns objects already defined in\n
      \        [RFC4438].\n"

  title: 6.  Definitions

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned a MIB OID for the T11-FC-RSCN-MIB
    module under the\n   appropriate subtree.\n"
  title: 7.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability are:\n        t11FcRscnIlsRejectNotifyEnable\n
    \       t11FcRscnElsRejectNotifyEnable\n          -- ability to enable/disable
    a notification; these object, if\n             misconfigured, would either generate
    unwanted notifications\n             or suppress wanted notifications.\n   Some
    of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS
    other than not-accessible) may also be considered\n   sensitive or vulnerable
    in some network environments.  It is thus\n   important to control even GET and/or
    NOTIFY access to these objects\n   and possibly to even encrypt the values of
    these objects when sending\n   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the
    tables and objects and\n   their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n        t11FcRscnRegTable
    -- contains a list of Nx_Ports that are\n        currently registered to received
    RSCNs.\n        t11FcRscnStatsTable -- contains RSCN-related statistics.\n        t11FcRscnNotifyControlTable
    -- contains control and logging\n        information for notifications that are
    concerned with the\n        rejection of RSCN-related requests.\n   SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself
    is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as
    to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
