- title: 1. Motivation
  contents:
  - "1. Motivation\n   Hosts in an IP network are identified by IP addresses, and\
    \ the IP\n   address prefixes of subnets are advertised by routing protocols.\
    \  A\n   change in such IP addressing information associated with a host or\n\
    \   subnet is known as \"renumbering\".\n   Renumbering may occur for a variety\
    \ of reasons.  For example, moving\n   an IP host from one subnet to another requires\
    \ changing the host's IP\n   address.  Physically splitting a subnet due to traffic\
    \ overload may\n   also require renumbering.  A third example where renumbering\
    \ may\n   happen is when an organization changes its addressing plan.  Such\n\
    \   changes imply changing not only hosts' addresses, but subnet numbers\n   as\
    \ well.  These are just three examples that illustrate possible\n   scenarios\
    \ where renumbering could occur.\n   Increasingly, renumbering will be needed\
    \ for organizations that\n   require Internet-wide IP connectivity, but do not\
    \ themselves provide\n   a sufficient degree of address information aggregation.\
    \  Unless and\n   until viable alternatives are developed, extended deployment\
    \ of\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is vital to keep the Internet\n\
    \   routing system alive and to maintain continuous uninterrupted growth\n   of\
    \ the Internet.  With current IP technology, this requires such\n   organizations\
    \ to use addresses belonging to a single large block of\n   address space, allocated\
    \ to their current service provider which acts\n   as an aggregator for these\
    \ addresses.  To contain the growth of\n   routing information, whenever such\
    \ an organization changes to a new\n   service provider, the organization's addresses\
    \ will have to change.\n   Occasionally, service providers themselves may have\
    \ to change to a\n   new and larger block of address space. In either of these\
    \ cases, to\n   contain the growth of routing information, the organizations\n\
    \   concerned would need to renumber their subnet(s) and host(s). If the\n   organization\
    \ does not renumber, then some of the potential\n   consequences may include (a)\
    \ limited (less than Internet-wide) IP\n   connectivity, or (b) extra cost to\
    \ offset the overhead associated\n   with the organization's routing information\
    \ that Internet Service\n   Providers have to maintain, or both.\n   Currently,\
    \ renumbering is usually a costly, tedious and error-prone\n   process.  It normally\
    \ requires the services of experts in the area\n   and considerable advance planning.\
    \  Tools to facilitate renumbering\n   are few, not widely available, and not\
    \ widely deployed. While a\n   variety of ad hoc approaches to renumbering have\
    \ been developed and\n   used, the overall situation is far from satisfactory.\
    \  There is\n   little or no documentation that describes renumbering procedures.\n\
    \   While renumbering occurs in various parts of the Internet, there is\n   little\
    \ or no documented experience sharing.\n"
- title: 2. DNS versus IP Addresses
  contents:
  - "2. DNS versus IP Addresses\n   Within the Internet architecture an individual\
    \ host can be identified\n   by the IP address(es) assigned to the network interface(s)\
    \ on that\n   host.  The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a convenient way to\n\
    \   associate legible names with IP addresses.  The DNS name space is\n   independent\
    \ of the IP address space.  DNS names are usually related\n   to the ownership\
    \ and function of the hosts, not to the mechanisms of\n   addressing and routing.\
    \  A change in DNS name may be a sign of a real\n   change in function or ownership,\
    \ whereas a change in IP address is a\n   purely technical event.\n   Expressing\
    \ information in terms of Domain Names allows one to defer\n   binding between\
    \ a particular network entity and its IP address until\n   run time. Domain Names\
    \ for enterprises, and Fully Qualified Domain\n   Names (FQDNs, see RFC 1594)\
    \ for servers and many user systems, are\n   expected to be fairly long-lived,\
    \ and more stable than IP addresses.\n   Deferring the binding avoids the risk\
    \ of changed mapping between IP\n   addresses and specific network entities (due\
    \ to changing addressing\n   information).  Moreover, reliance on FQDNs (rather\
    \ than IP addresses)\n   also localizes to the DNS the changes needed to deal\
    \ with changing\n   addressing information due to renumbering.\n   In some cases,\
    \ both the addresses and FQDNs of desk top or portable\n   systems are allocated\
    \ dynamically. It is only a highly responsive\n   dynamic DNS update mechanism\
    \ that can cope with this.\n"
- title: 3. Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3. Recommendations\n   To make renumbering more feasible, the IAB strongly recommends\
    \ that\n   all designs and implementations should minimise the cases in which\
    \ IP\n   addresses are stored in non-volatile storage maintained by humans,\n\
    \   such as configuration files.  Configuration information used by\n   TCP/IP\
    \ protocols should be expressed, whenever possible, in terms of\n   Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Names, rather than IP addresses. Hardcoding IP\n   addresses into applications\
    \ should be deprecated.  Files containing\n   lists of name to address mappings,\
    \ other than that used as part of\n   DNS configuration, should be deprecated,\
    \ and avoided wherever\n   possible.\n   There are times when legacy applications\
    \ which require configuration\n   files with IP addresses rather than Domain Names\
    \ cannot be upgraded\n   to meet these recommendations. In those cases, it is\
    \ recommended that\n   the configuration files be generated automatically from\
    \ another file\n   which uses Domain Names, with the substitution of addresses\
    \ being\n   done by lookup in the DNS.\n   Use of licensing technology that is\
    \ based upon the IP address of a\n   host system makes renumbering quite difficult.\
    \ Therefore, the use of\n   such technology should be strongly discouraged.\n\
    \   The development and deployment of a toolkit to facilitate and\n   automate\
    \ host renumbering is essential.  The Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol\
    \ (DHCP) is clearly an essential part of such a\n   toolkit.  The IAB strongly\
    \ encourages implementation and wide-scale\n   deployment of DHCP.  Dynamic router\
    \ discovery (RFC 1256) and service\n   location (work in progress in the IETF)\
    \ also belong in this toolkit.\n   Support for dynamic update capabilities to\
    \ the Domain Name System\n   (DNS) that could be done with sufficient authentication\
    \ would further\n   facilitate host renumbering.  The IAB strongly encourages\
    \ progression\n   of work in this area towards standardization within the IETF,\
    \ with\n   the goal of integrating DHCP and dynamic update capabilities to\n \
    \  provide truly autoconfigurable TCP/IP hosts.\n   The IAB strongly encourages\
    \ sharing of experience with renumbering\n   and documenting this sharing within\
    \ the Internet community.  The IAB\n   suggests that the IETF (and specifically\
    \ its Operational Requirements\n   Area) may be the most appropriate place to\
    \ develop such\n   documentation.  The IAB welcomes the creation of the PIER (Procedures\n\
    \   for Internet and Enterprise Renumbering) working group.\n"
