Abstract This RFC describes a method of encapsulating IP datagrams on top of Acoustical Transmission Media (ATM).
This is a non recommended standard.
Distribution of this memo is unnecessary.
The modern laptop computer of today often contains the hardware needed to perform wireless communications by using Acoustical Transmission Media, i.e. sound waves.
Until this moment there has been no standard on how to run IP on such media.
This document is an attempt to fill this silence.
The IP datagram is divided into four bit chunks, in network beep order, and converted to characters according to the table below.
A single "b" character is prepended as a frame start signal, the characters are then transmitted in ordinary morse code by modulating a steady tone on and off.
The frequency of this tone is also known as the Acoustical Signature (AS number) of the sender.
To allow more than one Local Acoustical Network (LAN) to coexist the use of different AS numbers for different LANs is suggested.
This document proposes seven standard AS numbers to be used, see the table below for details.
It is assumed that for normal operation AS number "a", 440 Hz will be used.
The above process is simply performed backwards.
The author assumes that the users take whatever precautions that are necessary before attempting to use this protocol in any crowded area.
