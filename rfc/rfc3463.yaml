  - "1. Overview\n   There is a need for a standard mechanism for the reporting of\
    \ mail\n   system errors richer than the limited set offered by SMTP and the\n\
    \   system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages.  There is a\n   pressing\
    \ need for a rich machine-readable, human language independent\n   status code\
    \ for use in delivery status notifications [DSN].  This\n   document proposes\
    \ a new set of status codes for this purpose.\n   SMTP [SMTP] error codes have\
    \ historically been used for reporting\n   mail system errors.  Because of limitations\
    \ in the SMTP code design,\n   these are not suitable for use in delivery status\
    \ notifications.\n   SMTP provides about 12 useful codes for delivery reports.\
    \  The\n   majority of the codes are protocol specific response codes such as\n\
    \   the 354 response to the SMTP data command.  Each of the 12 useful\n   codes\
    \ are overloaded to indicate several error conditions.  SMTP\n   suffers some\
    \ scars from history, most notably the unfortunate damage\n   to the reply code\
    \ extension mechanism by uncontrolled use.  This\n   proposal facilitates future\
    \ extensibility by requiring the client to\n   interpret unknown error codes according\
    \ to the theory of codes while\n   requiring servers to register new response\
    \ codes.\n   The SMTP theory of reply codes are partitioned in the number space\
    \ in\n   such a manner that the remaining available codes will not provide the\n\
    \   space needed.  The most critical example is the existence of only 5\n   remaining\
    \ codes for mail system errors.  The mail system\n   classification includes both\
    \ host and mailbox error conditions.  The\n   remaining third digit space would\
    \ be completely consumed as needed to\n   indicate MIME and media conversion errors\
    \ and security system errors.\n   A revision to the SMTP theory of reply codes\
    \ to better distribute the\n   error conditions in the number space will necessarily\
    \ be incompatible\n   with SMTP.  Further, consumption of the remaining reply-code\
    \ number\n   space for delivery notification reporting will reduce the available\n\
    \   codes for new ESMTP extensions.\n   The following status code set is based\
    \ on the SMTP theory of reply\n   codes.  It adopts the success, permanent error,\
    \ and transient error\n   semantics of the first value, with a further description\
    \ and\n   classification in the second.  This proposal re-distributes the\n  \
    \ classifications to better distribute the error conditions, such as\n   separating\
    \ mailbox from host errors.\n   Document Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2. Status Code Structure
  contents:
  - "2. Status Code Structure\n   This document defines a new set of status codes\
    \ to report mail system\n   conditions.  These status codes are used for media\
    \ and language\n   independent status reporting.  They are not intended for system\n\
    \   specific diagnostics.\n   The syntax of the new status codes is defined as:\n\
    \      status-code = class \".\" subject \".\" detail\n      class = \"2\"/\"\
    4\"/\"5\"\n      subject = 1*3digit\n      detail = 1*3digit\n   White-space characters\
    \ and comments are NOT allowed within a status-\n   code.  Each numeric sub-code\
    \ within the status-code MUST be expressed\n   without leading zero digits.\n\
    \   Status codes consist of three numerical fields separated by \".\".  The\n\
    \   first sub-code indicates whether the delivery attempt was successful.\n  \
    \ The second sub-code indicates the probable source of any delivery\n   anomalies,\
    \ and the third sub-code indicates a precise error\n   condition.\n   Example:\
    \  2.1.23\n   The code space defined is intended to be extensible only by standards\n\
    \   track documents.  Mail system specific status codes should be mapped\n   as\
    \ close as possible to the standard status codes.  Servers should\n   send only\
    \ defined, registered status codes.  System specific errors\n   and diagnostics\
    \ should be carried by means other than status codes.\n   New subject and detail\
    \ codes will be added over time.  Because the\n   number space is large, it is\
    \ not intended that published status codes\n   will ever be redefined or eliminated.\
    \  Clients should preserve the\n   extensibility of the code space by reporting\
    \ the general error\n   described in the subject sub-code when the specific detail\
    \ is\n   unrecognized.\n   The class sub-code provides a broad classification\
    \ of the status.\n   The enumerated values for each class are defined as:\n  \
    \    2.XXX.XXX   Success\n         Success specifies that the DSN is reporting\
    \ a positive delivery\n         action.  Detail sub-codes may provide notification\
    \ of\n         transformations required for delivery.\n      4.XXX.XXX   Persistent\
    \ Transient Failure\n         A persistent transient failure is one in which the\
    \ message as\n         sent is valid, but persistence of some temporary condition\
    \ has\n         caused abandonment or delay of attempts to send the message.\n\
    \         If this code accompanies a delivery failure report, sending in\n   \
    \      the future may be successful.\n      5.XXX.XXX   Permanent Failure\n  \
    \       A permanent failure is one which is not likely to be resolved\n      \
    \   by resending the message in the current form.  Some change to\n         the\
    \ message or the destination must be made for successful\n         delivery.\n\
    \   A client must recognize and report class sub-code even where\n   subsequent\
    \ subject sub-codes are unrecognized.\n   The subject sub-code classifies the\
    \ status.  This value applies to\n   each of the three classifications.  The subject\
    \ sub-code, if\n   recognized, must be reported even if the additional detail\
    \ provided\n   by the detail sub-code is not recognized.  The enumerated values\
    \ for\n   the subject sub-code are:\n      X.0.XXX   Other or Undefined Status\n\
    \         There is no additional subject information available.\n      X.1.XXX\
    \ Addressing Status\n         The address status reports on the originator or\
    \ destination\n         address.  It may include address syntax or validity. \
    \ These\n         errors can generally be corrected by the sender and retried.\n\
    \      X.2.XXX Mailbox Status\n         Mailbox status indicates that something\
    \ having to do with the\n         mailbox has caused this DSN.  Mailbox issues\
    \ are assumed to be\n         under the general control of the recipient.\n  \
    \    X.3.XXX Mail System Status\n         Mail system status indicates that something\
    \ having to do with\n         the destination system has caused this DSN.  System\
    \ issues are\n         assumed to be under the general control of the destination\n\
    \         system administrator.\n      X.4.XXX Network and Routing Status\n  \
    \       The networking or routing codes report status about the\n         delivery\
    \ system itself.  These system components include any\n         necessary infrastructure\
    \ such as directory and routing\n         services.  Network issues are assumed\
    \ to be under the control\n         of the destination or intermediate system\
    \ administrator.\n      X.5.XXX Mail Delivery Protocol Status\n         The mail\
    \ delivery protocol status codes report failures\n         involving the message\
    \ delivery protocol.  These failures\n         include the full range of problems\
    \ resulting from\n         implementation errors or an unreliable connection.\n\
    \      X.6.XXX Message Content or Media Status\n         The message content or\
    \ media status codes report failures\n         involving the content of the message.\
    \  These codes report\n         failures due to translation, transcoding, or otherwise\n\
    \         unsupported message media.  Message content or media issues are\n  \
    \       under the control of both the sender and the receiver, both of\n     \
    \    which must support a common set of supported content-types.\n      X.7.XXX\
    \ Security or Policy Status\n         The security or policy status codes report\
    \ failures involving\n         policies such as per-recipient or per-host filtering\
    \ and\n         cryptographic operations.  Security and policy status issues\n\
    \         are assumed to be under the control of either or both the\n        \
    \ sender and recipient.  Both the sender and recipient must\n         permit the\
    \ exchange of messages and arrange the exchange of\n         necessary keys and\
    \ certificates for cryptographic operations.\n"

    \   Bad destination mailbox address\n         The mailbox specified in the address\
    \ does not exist.  For\n         Internet mail names, this means the address portion\

    \ the\n         delivery protocol or the next system in the forwarding path.\n\
    \         This is useful only as a permanent error.\n      X.6.2   Conversion\
    \ required and prohibited\n         The content of the message must be converted\
    \ before it can be\n         delivered and such conversion is not permitted. \
    \ Such\n         prohibitions may be the expression of the sender in the message\n\
    \         itself or the policy of the sending host.\n      X.6.3   Conversion\
    \ required but not supported\n         The message content must be converted in\
    \ order to be forwarded\n         but such conversion is not possible or is not\
    \ practical by a\n         host in the forwarding path.  This condition may result\
    \ when an\n         ESMTP gateway supports 8bit transport but is not able to\n\
    \         downgrade the message to 7 bit as required for the next hop.\n     \
    \ X.6.4   Conversion with loss performed\n         This is a warning sent to the\
    \ sender when message delivery was\n         successfully but when the delivery\
    \ required a conversion in\n         which some data was lost.  This may also\
    \ be a permanent error\n         if the sender has indicated that conversion with\
    \ loss is\n         prohibited for the message.\n      X.6.5   Conversion Failed\n\
    \         A conversion was required but was unsuccessful.  This may be\n     \
    \    useful as a permanent or persistent temporary notification.\n"

  - "3.8 Security or Policy Status\n      X.7.0   Other or undefined security status\n\
    \         Something related to security caused the message to be\n         returned,\
    \ and the problem cannot be well expressed with any of\n         the other provided\
    \ detail codes.  This status code may also be\n         used when the condition\
    \ cannot be further described because of\n         security policies in force.\n\
    \      X.7.1   Delivery not authorized, message refused\n         The sender is\
    \ not authorized to send to the destination.  This\n         can be the result\
    \ of per-host or per-recipient filtering.  This\n         memo does not discuss\

    \   A conversion from one secure messaging protocol to another was\n         required\
    \ for delivery and such conversion was not possible.\n         This is useful\
    \ only as a permanent error.\n      X.7.4   Security features not supported\n\
    \         A message contained security features such as secure\n         authentication\
    \ that could not be supported on the delivery\n         protocol.  This is useful\

    \ transport system otherwise authorized to validate or decrypt\n         a message\
    \ in transport was unable to do so because necessary\n         information such\
    \ as key was not available or such information\n         was invalid.\n      X.7.6\
    \   Cryptographic algorithm not supported\n         A transport system otherwise\
    \ authorized to validate or decrypt\n         a message was unable to do so because\
    \ the necessary algorithm\n         was not supported.\n      X.7.7   Message\
    \ integrity failure\n         A transport system otherwise authorized to validate\
    \ a message\n         was unable to do so because the message was corrupted or\n\
    \         altered.  This may be useful as a permanent, transient\n         persistent,\
