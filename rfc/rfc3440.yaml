    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC

    outlines the relationship of the ADSL Line Extension MIB\n   with other MIBs described
    in RFCs and in their various degrees of\n   standardization.  In regards to these
    relationships, the ADSL Line\n   Extension MIB follows conventions as used by
    the ADSL Line MIB with\n   one exception.  The value of the RFC 2863 object, ifOperstatus,
    SHALL\n   be down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in power state L3, as\n   defined
    in ITU G.992.1 [ITU G.992.1], which means no power.  Its\n   value shall be up(1)
    if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0\n   (power on) [ITU G.992.1] or
    L1 (reduced power).  Power Status L2 [ITU\n   G.992.1] is not applicable.\n"

        bucket(s) of \"interval-counters\", as\n   well as current and previous 1-day
        interval-counters.   Threshold\n   notification can be configured for each
        physical-layer current 15-\n   minute bucket.\n   There is no requirement
        for an agent to ensure fixed relationship\n   between the start of a fifteen
        minute and any wall clock; however\n   some implementations may align the
        fifteen-minute intervals with\n   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation
        may choose to align one\n   day intervals with start of a day.\n   Separate
        tables are provided for the 96 interval-counters.  They are\n   indexed by
        {ifIndex, AdslAtu*IntervalNumber}.\n   Counters are not reset when an ATU-C
        or ATU-R is reinitialized, only\n   when the agent is reset or reinitialized
        (or under specific request\n   outside the scope of this MIB).\n   The 15-minute
        event counters are of the type PerfCurrentCount and\n   PerfIntervalCount.

      - "4.2.6 Alternative profile configuration for the dual line mode interface\n
        \  The object, adslLineConfProfileDualLite, is used only when the\n   interface
        (the ADSL line and, if applicable, channel) is configured\n   as dual mode,
        that is, the object adslLineTransAtucConfig is\n   configured with one or
        more full-rate modes and one or more G.Lite\n   modes.\n   The object adslLineConfProfile
        defined in ADSL-MIB [RFC2662] is used\n   as the primary full-rate profile.
        \ The newly added object in this MIB\n   module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite,
        is used to describe and\n   configure the G.Lite profile.  Note that if one
        or more full-rate\n   modes are configured, or only G.Lite modes are configured,
        only the\n   original full-rate profile is needed.  The dual-mode profile
        object\n   is only needed when both full-rate and G.Lite profiles are needed.\n
        \  In this case, it will be set to the value of adslLineConfProfile when\n
        \  'dynamic' profiles are implemented.\n   When 'static' profiles are implemented,
        however, similar to the case\n   of the object, adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662],
        this object's value\n   will need to algorithmically represent the line.  In
        this case, the\n   value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating the
        line mode\n   type (e.g., G.Lite, Full-rate) will be used.  Therefore, the\n
        \  profile's name is a string of the concatenation of the ifIndex and\n   one
        of the following values: Full or Lite.  This string will be\n   fixed-length
        (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).  For example, the\n   profile name for ifIndex
        that equals '15' and is a full rate line\n   will be '0000000015Full'.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The following security matters should be considered
    when implementing\n   this MIB.\n   1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL
    MIB via the element\n      management system is outside the scope of this document.
    \ It\n      should be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized\n
    \     entity to modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both\n      subscriber
    service and network operations can be interfered with.\n      Subscriber service
    can be altered by modifying any of a number of\n      service characteristics
    such as rate partitioning and maximum\n      transmission rates.  Network operations
    can be impacted by\n      modifying notification thresholds such as Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio\n      (SNR) margins.\n   2) SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.
    \ Even if the\n      network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there
    is no\n      control over who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n
    \     GET (read) the objects in this MIB.  It is recommended that the\n      implementors
    consider the security features as provided by the\n      SNMPv3 framework.   Specifically,
    the use of the User-based\n      Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and
    the View-based\n      Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.\n
    \     It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n      entity
    giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n      configured to give
    access to only those objects, and to those\n      principals (users) that have
    legitimate rights to access them.\n   3) The profile mechanism presented in this
    document requires specific\n      attention.  The implementor of this MIB has
    a choice of\n      implementing either 'static' or 'dynamic' profiles.  This decision\n
    \     must be consistent with the implementation of RFC 2662.\n      In the case
    of 'static' profiles, the elements of the profile are\n      read-write, as opposed
    to read-create when 'dynamic' profiles are\n      implemented:\n         - adslConfProfileLineType,\n
    \        - adslAtucThreshold15MinFailedFastR,\n         - adslAtucThreshold15MinSesL,\n
    \        - adslAtucThreshold15MinUasL,\n         - adslAturThreshold15MinSesL,
    and\n         - adslAturThreshold15MinUasL.\n      This decision also impacts
    the mechanics of the index,\n      adslLineConfProfileDualLite.  When 'static'
    profiles are\n      implemented, its value is algorithmically set by the system
    and\n      its value is based on the ifIndex.  Hence it is not guaranteed\n      across
    system reboots.  Similar to the handling of\n      adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662],
    the implementor of this MIB must\n      ensure that the profile object values
    associated with these\n      indices are maintained across system reboots.\n      In
    the case of dynamic profiles, this object is set by the SNMP\n      manager.  The
    implementor of this MIB may want to provide a view\n      of the profile on a
    customer-by-customer standpoint, but should be\n      cautious of the dynamic
    nature of these objects.\n      4) ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU-R will
    permit the\n      subscriber to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the
    ADSL\n      overhead control channel(AOC)/embedded operations channel (EOC)\n
    \     for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked or unfiltered\n      fluctuations
    initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient\n      notifications to
    potentially overwhelm either the management\n      interface to the network or
    the element manager.  Other attacks\n      affecting the ATU-R portions of the
    MIB may also be possible.\n"
