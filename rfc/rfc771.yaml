  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The principal aim of the mail service transition plan is to\
    \ provide\n   orderly support for computer mail service during the period of\n\
    \   transition from the old ARPANET protocols to the new Internet\n   protocols.\n\
    \   This plan covers only the transition from the current text computer\n   mail\
    \ in the ARPANET environment to text computer mail in an Internet\n   environment.\
    \  This plan does not address a second transition from\n   text only mail to multimedia\
    \ mail [10,11].\n   The goal is to provide equivalent or better service in the\
    \ new\n   Internet environment as was available in the ARPANET environment.\n\
    \   During the interim period, when both protocol environments are in\n   use,\
    \ the goal is to minimize the impact on users and existing\n   software, yet to\
    \ permit the maximum mail exchange connectivity.\n   It is assumed that the user\
    \ is familiar with both the ARPANET and\n   Internet protocol environments [1-8].\
    \  The Internet protocols are\n   designed to be used in a diverse collection\
    \ of networks including the\n   ARPANET, Packet Radio nets, Satellite nets, and\
    \ local nets (e.g.,\n   Ethernets, Ring nets); while the ARPANET protocol are,\
    \ of course,\n   limited to the ARPANET.\n   The Internet protocol environment\
    \ specifies TCP as the host-to-host\n   transport protocol.  The ARPANET protocol\
    \ environment specifies NCP\n   as the host-to-host transport protocol.  Both\
    \ TCP and NCP provide\n   connection type process-to-process communication.  The\
    \ problem in the\n   transition is to bridge these two different interprocess\n\
    \   communication systems.\n   The objective of this plan is to specify the means\
    \ by which the\n   ARPANET computer mail services may be extended into the Internet\n\
    \   system without disruptive changes for the users during the\n   transition.\n"

- title: MODEL OF MAIL SERVICE
  contents:
  - "MODEL OF MAIL SERVICE\n   The model of the computer mail system taken here separates\
    \ the mail\n   composition and reading functions from the mail transport functions.\n\
    \   In the following, the discussion will be hoplessly TOPS20-oriented.\n   We\
    \ appologize to users of other systems, but  we feel it is better to\n   discuss\
    \ examples we know than to attempt to be abstract.\n   In the ARPANET mail service,\
    \ composition and reading is done with\n   user programs such as HERMES, MSG,\
    \ MM, etc., while mail transmission\n   is done by system programs such as MAILER\
    \ (sending) and FTPSRV\n   (receiving).\n   One element of the ARPANET mail service\
    \ is the assumption that every\n   source of mail can have a direct interprocess\
    \ communication\n   connection (via the NCPs) to every destination for mail. \
    \ (There are\n   some cases where special handling and forwarding of mail violates\n\
    \   this assumption.)\n   Mailbox names are of the form \"MAILBOX@HOST\", and\
    \ it is assumed that\n   MAILBOX is a destination mailbox on that host.\n   The\
    \ messages are actually transmitted according to the provisions of\n   the File\
    \ Transfer Protocol.  Mail may be transimitted via either the\n   control connection\
    \ (MAIL command), or via a data connection (MLFL\n   command).  In either case,\
    \ the argument specifies only the mailbox\n   since the destination host is assumed\
    \ to be the host receiving the\n   transmission.\n      For example:  messages\
    \ sent from Postel at USC-ISIF to Cerf at\n      USC-ISIA would arrive at ISIA\
    \ with the argument \"Cerf\" but no\n      indication of the host.\n"
- title: COMPOUND AND ALTERNATE NAMES
  contents:
  - "COMPOUND AND ALTERNATE NAMES\n   Mailboxes are of the form \"mailbox@host\" where\
    \ mailbox is usually a\n   name like \"Postel\" and host is a host identifier\
    \ like \"USC-ISIF\".  In\n   some cases it will be useful to allow the host to\
    \ be a compound name\n   such as:\n      USC-ISIA\n      ARPANET-ISIA\n      SATNET-NDRE\n\
    \      PPSN-RSRE\n      HOST1.SRINET\n      LSCNET/MAILROOM\n"

    \                                                  Mail Transition Plan\n   or\
    \ even the name of an organization:\n      BBN\n      ARPA\n      MIT\n      SRI\n\
    \   The only restriction is that \"@\" not appear in either the \"mailbox\"\n\
    \   or the \"host\" strings in the destination address.\n   To actually send the\
    \ message the mailer program must convert the host\n   string into the physical\
    \ address to which to transmit the message.\n   This name-to-address conversion\
    \ is typically done by looking the name\n   up in a table and finding the physical\
    \ address in another field of\n   that table entry.  This means that all the compound\
    \ and organization\n   names (and any other alternate names or synonyms) must\
    \ also be in the\n   host table.\n"
- title: HIDDEN HOSTS
  contents:
  - "HIDDEN HOSTS\n   Sometimes the mailbox part of the destination address is a compound\n\
    \   name and is used to mark a set of mailboxes which are not really on\n   the\
    \ host at all, but rather on another host which is connected to\n   this host\
    \ in a non-standard way.\n   It is important to users of computer mail that replies\
    \ to messages\n   may be easily composed with automatic assistance from the mail\n\
    \   processing programs.  To preserve this capability it is important\n   that\
    \ a host understand the mailbox part of every address in every\n   message it\
    \ sends if the host part of the address is itself.\n   That is, for every message,\
    \ in every header field, in every address\n   \"m@h\", host h must understand\
    \ all values of m.  Thus when a host\n   prepares a message it should check all\
    \ the addresses that appear in\n   the header and for any address whose host part\
    \ is this host the\n   mailbox part should be verified.\n"

- title: THE TRANSITION PLAN
  contents:
  - "THE TRANSITION PLAN\n   The basic ground rules for the transition are:\n    \
    \  1.  ARPANET mailbox names must continue to work correctly.\n      2.  No changes\
    \ should be required to mail editor software which\n      parses message headers\
    \ to compose replies and the like.\n      Specifically,  non-ARPANET mailbox designators\
    \ must be\n      accommodated without change to the parsing and checking mechanisms\n\
    \      of mail processing programs.\n      3.  Automatic forwarding of messages\
    \ between NCP and TCP\n      environments without user (or operator) intervention.\n\
    \   For the communication of messages between NCP and TCP hosts a mail\n   relay\
    \ service will be provided on a few hosts that implement both TCP\n   and NCP.\
    \  These will be \"well known\" in the same sense that sockets\n   or ports for\
    \ contacting Telnet or FTP servers are well known.\n   To make use of these relay\
    \ servers changes will be made to the mailer\n   programs.  The mailer program\
    \ will be responsible for determining if\n   the destination address of the message\
    \ is directly reachable via the\n   interprocess communication system it has available\
    \ (TCP or NCP or\n   both), or if the mail must be relayed.  If the mail must\
    \ be relayed,\n   the mailer must choose a relay server and transmit the message\
    \ to it.\n   The basis for the decision the mailer must make is an expanded host\n\
    \   name table.  There will be a table which translates host names to\n   physical\
    \ addresses.  The physical addresses in this table will be the\n   32-bit Internet\
    \ addresses. (This makes sense for even NCP-only hosts,\n   since after 1 January\
    \ 1981 even they must use 96-bit leader format\n   which requires 24-bit ARPANET\
    \ physical addresses).  Each entry in\n   this table will also have some flag\
    \ bits.\n   The flag bits will include information to indicate if the host in\n\
    \   this entry is (1) a  NCP host with \"old tables\", (2) a NCP host with\n \
    \  \"new tables\", (3) a TCP host, or (4) some other kind of host.  All\n   TCP\
    \ hosts are assumed to have \"new tables\".  \"Old tables\" are those\n   without\
    \ these flag bits, while \"new tables\" do have these flags.\n   A separate table\
    \ may be useful to list the addresses of the hosts\n   with relay servers.\n"

    \                                                  Mail Transition Plan\n   When\
    \ a message is sent to a relay server, the control information (in\n   the argument\
    \ of the mail transfer command) must be augmented to\n   include the destination\
    \ host identifier.\n   The relay server may accept messages to be relayed without\
    \ knowing\n   that destination mailbox is actually reachable.  This means that\
    \ it\n   may later discover that the destination mailbox does not exist (or\n\
    \   some other condition prevents mail delivery).  To be able to report\n   the\
    \ error to the originating user, the mailbox (mailbox@host) of the\n   originating\
    \ user must be included in the argument of the mail\n   transfer command.  If\
    \ the argument does not contain the address of\n   the originating user no error\
    \ response is attempted.  The error\n   report, which is itself a message, does\
    \ not carry an originator\n   address in the command argument to avoid the possibility\
    \ of a endless\n   chain of error reports (however, an originator address does\
    \ appear\n   the header).\n   Since the originating host will act as if the mail\
    \ was successfully\n   delivered when it is accepted by the relay server, it deletes\
    \ any\n   back up copies of the message it was keeping in case of errors.  For\n\
    \   this reason, the relay server must include the complete message in\n   any\
    \ error report it sends to the originator.  The relay server should\n   parse\
    \ the addresses in the argument before accepting a message.  If\n   it does not\
    \ understand how deliver locally, or both relay and reply\n   (if the originating\
    \ address is present) to the message, it should not\n   accept it.\n   There are\
    \ enough differences in the transmission procedure that the\n   relay server will\
    \ use a distinct mail transfer protocol, separate\n   from the file transfer protocol.\n"
