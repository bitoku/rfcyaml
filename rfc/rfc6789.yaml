  - "1.  Introduction\n   The power of Internet technology comes from multiplexing\
    \ shared\n   capacity with packets rather than circuits.  Network operators aim\
    \ to\n   provide sufficient shared capacity, but when too much packet load\n \
    \  meets too little shared capacity, congestion results.  Congestion\n   appears\
    \ as either increased delay, dropped packets, or packets\n   explicitly marked\
    \ with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\n   markings [RFC3168].  As described\
    \ in Figure 1, congestion control\n   currently relies on the transport receiver\
    \ detecting these\n   'Congestion Signals' and informing the transport sender\
    \ in\n   'Congestion Feedback Signals'.  The sender is then expected to reduce\n\
    \   its rate in response.\n   This document provides the entry point to the set\
    \ of documentation\n   about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol.  It focuses\
    \ on the\n   motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer.  (A\n \
    \  companion document, [CONEX-ABS], focuses on the mechanics of the\n   protocol.)\
    \  Briefly, the idea is for the sender to continually signal\n   expected congestion\
    \ in the headers of any data it sends.  To a first\n   approximation, the sender\
    \ does this by relaying the 'Congestion\n   Feedback Signals' back into the IP\
    \ layer.  They then travel unchanged\n   across the network to the receiver (shown\
    \ as 'IP-Layer-ConEx-Signals'\n   in Figure 1).  This enables IP-layer devices\
    \ on the path to see\n   information about the whole-path congestion.\n   ,---------.\

    \         Figure 1: The ConEx Protocol in the Internet Architecture\n   One of\
    \ the key benefits of exposing this congestion information at\n   the IP layer\
    \ is that it makes the information available to network\n   operators for use\
    \ as input into their traffic management procedures.\n   A ConEx-enabled sender\
    \ signals expected whole-path congestion, which\n   is approximately the congestion\
    \ at least a round-trip time earlier as\n   reported by the receiver to the sender\
    \ (Figure 1).  The ConEx signal\n   is a mark in the IP header that is easy for\
    \ any IP device to read.\n   Therefore, a node performing traffic management can\
    \ count congestion\n   as easily as it might count data volume today by simply\
    \ counting the\n   volume of packets with ConEx markings.\n   ConEx-based traffic\
    \ management can make highly efficient use of\n   capacity.  In times of no congestion,\
    \ all traffic management\n   restraints can be removed, leaving the network's\
    \ full capacity\n   available to all its users.  If some users on the network\
    \ cause\n   disproportionate congestion, the traffic management function can\n\
    \   learn about this and directly limit those users' traffic in order to\n   protect\
    \ the service of other users sharing the same capacity.  ConEx-\n   based traffic\
    \ management thus presents a step change in terms of the\n   options available\
    \ to network operators for managing traffic on their\n   networks.\n   The remainder\
    \ of this document explains the concepts behind ConEx and\n   how exposing congestion\
    \ can significantly improve Internet traffic\n   management, among other benefits.\
    \  Section 2 introduces a number of\n   concepts that are fundamental to understanding\
    \ how ConEx-based\n   traffic management works.  Section 3 shows how ConEx can\
    \ be used for\n   traffic management, discusses additional benefits from such\
    \ usage,\n   and compares ConEx-based traffic management to existing traffic\n\
    \   management approaches.  Section 4 discusses other related use cases.\n   Section\
    \ 5 briefly discusses deployment arrangements.  Section 6\n   suggests open issues\
    \ that experiments in the use of ConEx could\n   usefully be designed to answer.\
    \  The final sections are standard RFC\n   back matter.\n   The remainder of the\
    \ core ConEx document suite consists of:\n      [CONEX-ABS], which provides an\
    \ abstract encoding of ConEx signals,\n      explains the ConEx audit and security\
    \ mechanisms, and describes\n      incremental deployment features;\n      [CONEX-DESTOPT],\
    \ which specifies the IPv6 destination option\n      encoding for ConEx;\n   \
    \   [TCP-MOD], which specifies TCP-sender modifications for use of\n      ConEx;\n\
    \      and the following documents, which describe some feasible\n      scenarios\
    \ for deploying ConEx:\n         [CONEX-DEPLOY], which describes a scenario around\
    \ a fixed\n         broadband access network;\n         [CONEX-MOBILE], which\
    \ describes a scenario around a mobile\n         communications provider;\n  \
    \       [CONEX-DATA], which describes how ConEx could be used for\n         performance\
    \ isolation between tenants of a data centre.\n"
- title: 2.  Concepts
  contents:
  - "2.  Concepts\n   ConEx relies on a precise definition of congestion and a number\
    \ of\n   newer concepts that are introduced in this section.  Definitions are\n\
    \   summarized in Section 2.4.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Congestion
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Congestion\n   Despite its central role in network control and management,\n\
    \   congestion is a remarkably difficult concept to define.  Experts in\n   different\
    \ disciplines and with different perspectives define\n   congestion in a variety\
    \ of ways [Bauer09].\n   The definition used for the purposes of ConEx is expressed\
    \ as the\n   probability of packet loss (or the probability of packet marking\
    \ if\n   ECN is in use).  This definition focuses on how congestion is\n   measured,\
    \ rather than describing congestion as a condition or state.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Congestion-Volume
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Congestion-Volume\n   The metric that ConEx exposes is congestion-volume:\
    \ the volume of\n   bytes dropped or ECN-marked in a given period of time.  Counting\n\
    \   congestion-volume allows each user to be held responsible for his or\n   her\
    \ contribution to congestion.  Congestion-volume can only be a\n   property of\
    \ traffic, whereas congestion can be a property of traffic\n   or a property of\
    \ a link or a path.\n   To understand congestion-volume, consider a simple example.\
    \  Imagine\n   Alice sends 1 GB of a file while the loss-probability is a constant\n\
    \   0.2%.  Her contribution to congestion -- her congestion-volume -- is\n   1\
    \ GB x 0.2% = 2 MB.  If she then sends another 3 GB of the file while\n   the\
    \ loss-probability is 0.1%, this adds 3 MB to her congestion-\n   volume.  Her\
    \ total contribution to congestion is then 2 MB + 3 MB = 5\n   MB.\n   Fortunately,\
    \ measuring Alice's congestion-volume on a real network\n   does not require the\
    \ kind of arithmetic shown above, because\n   congestion-volume can be directly\
    \ measured by counting the total\n   volume of Alice's traffic that gets discarded\
    \ or ECN-marked.  (A\n   queue with varying percentage loss does these multiplications\
    \ and\n   additions inherently.)  With ConEx, network operators can count\n  \
    \ congestion-volume using techniques very similar to those they use for\n   counting\
    \ volume.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Rest-of-Path Congestion
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Rest-of-Path Congestion\n   At a particular measurement point within a\
    \ network, \"rest-of-path\n   congestion\" (also known as \"downstream congestion\"\
    ) is the level of\n   congestion that a traffic flow is expected to experience\
    \ between the\n   measurement point and its final destination.  \"Upstream congestion\"\
    \n   is the congestion experienced up to the measurement point.\n   If traffic\
    \ is ECN-capable, ECN signals monitored in the middle of a\n   network will indicate\
    \ the congestion experienced so far on the path\n   (upstream congestion).  In\
    \ contrast, the ConEx signals inserted into\n   IP headers as shown in Figure\
    \ 1 indicate the congestion along a whole\n   path from transport source to transport\
    \ destination.  Therefore, if a\n   measurement point detects both of these signals,\
    \ it can subtract the\n   level of ECN (upstream congestion) from the level of\
    \ ConEx (whole\n   path) to derive a measure of the congestion that packets are\
    \ likely\n   to experience between the monitoring point and their destination\n\
    \   (rest-of-path congestion).  A measurement point can calculate this\n   measurement\
    \ in the aggregate, across all flows.\n   A network monitor can usually accurately\
    \ measure upstream congestion\n   only if the traffic it observes is ECN-capable.\
    \  [CONEX-ABS] further\n   discusses the constraints around the network's ability\
    \ to measure\n   upstream and rest-of-path congestion in these circumstances.\n\
    \   However, there are a number of initial deployment arrangements that\n   benefit\
    \ from ConEx but work without ECN (see Section 5).\n"
- title: 2.4.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Definitions\n   Congestion:  In general, congestion occurs when any user's\
    \ traffic\n      suffers loss, ECN marking, or increased delay as a result of\
    \ one\n      or more network resources becoming overloaded.  For the purposes\n\
    \      of ConEx, congestion is measured using the concrete signals\n      provided\
    \ by loss and ECN markings (delay is not considered).\n      Congestion is measured\
    \ as the probability of loss or the\n      probability of ECN marking, usually\
    \ expressed as a dimensionless\n      percentage.\n   Congestion-volume:  For\
    \ any granularity of traffic (packet, flow,\n      aggregate, link, etc.), the\
    \ volume of bytes dropped or ECN-marked\n      in a given period of time.  Conceptually,\
    \ data volume multiplied\n      by the congestion each packet of the volume experienced.\
    \  This is\n      usually expressed in bytes (or kB, MB, etc.).\n   Congestion\
    \ policer:  A logical entity that allows a network operator\n      to monitor\
    \ each user's congestion-volume and enforce congestion-\n      volume limits (discussed\
    \ in Section 3.1).\n   Rest-of-path congestion (or downstream congestion):  The\
    \ congestion a\n      flow of traffic is expected to experience on the remainder\
    \ of its\n      path.  In other words, at a measurement point in the network,\
    \ the\n      rest-of-path congestion is the congestion the traffic flow has yet\n\
    \      to experience as it travels from that point to the receiver.\n      Upstream\
    \ congestion is usually expressed as a dimensionless\n      percentage.\n   Upstream\
    \ congestion:  The accumulated congestion experienced by a\n      traffic flow\
    \ thus far, relative to a point along its path.  In\n      other words, at a measurement\
    \ point in the network, the upstream\n      congestion is the accumulated congestion\
    \ the traffic flow has\n      experienced as it travels from the sender to that\
    \ point.  At the\n      receiver, this is equivalent to the end-to-end congestion\
    \ level\n      that (usually) is reported back to the sender.  This is usually\n\
    \      expressed as a dimensionless percentage.\n   Network operator (or provider):\
    \  Operator of a residential,\n      commercial, enterprise, campus, or other\
    \ network.\n   User:  The contractual entity that represents an individual,\n\
    \      household, business, or institution that uses the service of a\n      network\
    \ operator.  There is no implication that the contract has\n      to be commercial;\
    \ for instance, the users of a university or\n      enterprise network service\
    \ could be students or employees who do\n      not pay for access, but may be\
    \ required to comply with some form\n      of contract or acceptable use policy.\
    \  There is also no\n      implication that every user is an end user.  Where\
    \ two networks\n      form a customer-provider relationship, the term \"user\"\
    \ applies to\n      the customer network.\n   [CONEX-ABS] gives further definitions\
    \ for aspects of ConEx related to\n   protocol mechanisms.\n"

  - "3.  Core Use Case: Informing Traffic Management\n   This section explains how\
    \ ConEx could be used as the basis for\n   traffic management, highlights additional\
    \ benefits derived from\n   having ConEx-aware nodes on the network, and compares\
    \ ConEx-based\n   traffic management to existing approaches.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Use Case Description
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Use Case Description\n   One of the key benefits that ConEx can deliver\
    \ is in helping network\n   operators to improve how they manage traffic on their\
    \ networks.\n   Consider the common case of a commercial broadband network where\
    \ a\n   relatively small number of users place disproportionate demand on\n  \
    \ network resources, at times resulting in congestion.  The network\n   operator\
    \ seeks a way to manage traffic such that the traffic that\n   contributes more\
    \ to congestion bears more of the brunt of the\n   management.\n   Assuming ConEx\
    \ signals are visible at the IP layer, the network\n   operator can accomplish\
    \ this by placing a congestion policer at an\n   enforcement point within the\
    \ network and configuring it with a\n   traffic management policy that monitors\
    \ each user's contribution to\n   congestion.  As described in [CONEX-ABS] and\
    \ elaborated in [CongPol],\n   one way to implement a congestion policer is in\
    \ a similar way to a\n   bit-rate policer, except that it monitors congestion-volume\
    \ (based on\n   IP-layer ConEx signals) rather than bit rate.  When implemented\
    \ as a\n   token bucket, the tokens provide users with the right to cause bits\n\
    \   of congestion-volume, rather than to send bits of data volume.  The\n   fill\
    \ rate represents each user's congestion-volume quota.\n   The congestion policer\
    \ monitors the ConEx signals of the traffic\n   entering the network.  As long\
    \ as the network remains uncongested and\n   users stay within their quotas, no\
    \ action is taken.  When the network\n   becomes congested and a user exhausts\
    \ his quota, some action is taken\n   against the traffic that breached the quota\
    \ in accordance with the\n   network operator's traffic management policy.  For\
    \ example, the\n   traffic may be dropped, delayed, or marked with a lower QoS\
    \ class.\n   In this way, traffic is managed according to its contribution to\n\
    \   congestion -- not some application- or flow-specific policy -- and is\n  \
    \ not managed at all during times of no congestion.\n   As an example of how a\
    \ network operator might employ a ConEx-based\n   traffic management system, consider\
    \ a typical DSL network\n   architecture (as elaborated in [TR-059] and [TR-101]).\
    \  Traffic is\n   routed from regional and global IP networks to an operator-controlled\n\
    \   IP node, the Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  From the BRAS,\n   traffic\
    \ is delivered to access nodes.  The BRAS carries enhanced\n   functionality,\
    \ including IP QoS and traffic management capabilities.\n   By deploying a congestion\
    \ policer at the BRAS location, the network\n   operator can measure the congestion-volume\
    \ created by users within\n   the access nodes and police misbehaving users before\
    \ their traffic\n   affects others on the access network.  The policer would be\n\
    \   provisioned with a traffic management policy, perhaps directing the\n   BRAS\
    \ to drop packets from users that exceed their congestion-volume\n   quotas during\
    \ times of congestion.  Those users' apps would be likely\n   to react in the\
    \ typical way to drops, backing off (assuming at least\n   some use TCP), and\
    \ thereby lowering the users' congestion-volumes\n   back within the quota limits.\
    \  If none of a user's apps responds, the\n   policer would continue to increase\
    \ focused drops and effectively\n   enforce its own congestion control.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Additional Benefits
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Additional Benefits\n   The ConEx-based approach to traffic management\
    \ has a number of\n   benefits in addition to efficient management of traffic.\
    \  It provides\n   incentives for users to make use of \"scavenger\" transport\
    \ protocols,\n   such as the Low Extra Delay Background Transport [LEDBAT], that\n\
    \   provide ways for bulk-transfer applications to rapidly yield when\n   interactive\
    \ applications require capacity (thereby \"scavenging\"\n   remaining bandwidth).\
    \  With a congestion policer in place as\n   described in Section 3.1, users of\
    \ these protocols will be less\n   likely to run afoul of the network operator's\
    \ traffic management\n   policy than those whose bulk-transfer applications generate\
    \ the same\n   volume of traffic without being sensitive to congestion.  In short,\n\
    \   two users who produce similar traffic volumes over the same time\n   interval\
    \ may produce different congestion-volumes if one of them is\n   using a scavenger\
    \ transport protocol and the other is not; in that\n   situation, the scavenger\
    \ user's traffic is less likely to be managed\n   by the network operator.\n \
    \  ConEx-based traffic management also makes it possible for a user to\n   control\
    \ the relative performance among its own traffic flows.  If a\n   user wants some\
    \ flows to have more bandwidth than others, it can\n   reduce the rate of some\
    \ traffic so that it consumes less congestion-\n   volume \"budget\", leaving\
    \ more congestion-volume \"budget\" for the user\n   to \"spend\" on making other\
    \ traffic go faster.  This approach is most\n   relevant if congestion is signalled\
    \ by ECN, because no impairment due\n   to loss is involved and delay can remain\
    \ low.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Comparison with Existing Approaches
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Comparison with Existing Approaches\n   A variety of approaches already\
    \ exist for network operators to manage\n   congestion, traffic, and the disproportionate\
    \ usage of scarce\n   capacity by a small number of users.  Common approaches\
    \ can be\n   categorized as rate-based, volume-based, or application-based.\n\
    \   Rate-based approaches constrain the traffic rate per user or per\n   network.\
    \  A user's peak and average (or \"committed\") rate may be\n   limited.  These\
    \ approaches have the potential to either over- or\n   under-constrain the network,\
    \ suppressing rates even when the network\n   is uncongested or not suppressing\
    \ them enough during heavy usage\n   periods.\n   Round-robin scheduling and fair\
    \ queuing were developed to address\n   these problems.  They equalize relative\
    \ rates between active users\n   (or flows) at a known bottleneck.  The bit rate\
    \ allocated to any one\n   user depends on the number of active users at each\
    \ instant.  The\n   drawback of these approaches is that they favor heavy users\
    \ over\n   light users over time, because they do not have any memory of usage.\n\
    \   These approaches share bit rate instant by instant; however, heavy\n   users\
    \ are active at every instant, whereas light users only occupy\n   their share\
    \ of the link occasionally.\n   Volume-based approaches measure the overall volume\
    \ of traffic a user\n   sends (and/or receives) over time.  Users may be subject\
    \ to an\n   absolute volume cap (for example, 10GB per month) or the \"heaviest\"\
    \n   users may be sanctioned in some other manner.  Many providers use\n   monthly\
    \ volume limits, and count volume regardless of whether the\n   network is congested\
    \ or not, creating the potential for over- or\n   under-constraining problems,\
    \ as with the original rate-based\n   approaches.\n   ConEx-based approaches,\
    \ by comparison, only react during times of\n   congestion and in proportion to\
    \ each user's congestion contribution,\n   making more efficient use of capacity\
    \ and more proportionate\n   management decisions.\n   Unlike ConEx-based approaches,\
    \ neither rate-based nor volume-based\n   approaches provide incentives for applications\
    \ to use scavenger\n   transport protocols.  They may even penalize users of applications\n\
    \   that employ scavenger transports for the large amount of volume they\n   send,\
    \ rather than rewarding them for carefully avoiding congestion\n   while sending\
    \ it.  While the volume-based approach described in\n   \"Comcast's Protocol-Agnostic\
    \ Congestion Management System\" [RFC6057]\n   aims to overcome the over-/under-constraining\
    \ problem by only\n   measuring volume and triggering traffic management action\
    \ during\n   periods of high utilization, it still does not provide incentives\
    \ to\n   use scavenger transports, because congestion-causing volume cannot be\n\
    \   distinguished from volume overall.  ConEx provides this ability.\n   Application-based\
    \ approaches use deep packet inspection or other\n   techniques to determine what\
    \ application a given traffic flow is\n   associated with.  Network operators\
    \ may then use this information to\n   rate-limit or otherwise sanction certain\
    \ applications, in some cases\n   only during peak hours.  These approaches suffer\
    \ from being at odds\n   with IPsec and some application-layer encryption, and\
    \ they may raise\n   additional policy concerns.  In contrast, ConEx offers an\n\
    \   application-agnostic metric to serve as the basis for traffic\n   management\
    \ decisions.\n   The existing types of approaches share a further limitation that\n\
    \   ConEx can help to overcome: performance uncertainty.  Flat-rate\n   pricing\
    \ plans are popular because users appreciate the certainty of\n   having their\
    \ monthly bill amount remain the same for each billing\n   period, allowing them\
    \ to plan their costs accordingly.  But while\n   flat-rate pricing avoids billing\
    \ uncertainty, it creates performance\n   uncertainty: users cannot know whether\
    \ the performance of their\n   connections is being altered or degraded based\
    \ on how the network\n   operator is attempting to manage congestion.  By exposing\
    \ congestion\n   information at the IP layer, ConEx instead provides a metric\
    \ that can\n   serve as an open, transparent basis for traffic management policies\n\
    \   that both providers and their customers can measure and verify.  It\n   can\
    \ be used to reduce the performance uncertainty that some users\n   currently\
    \ experience, without having to sacrifice their billing\n   certainty.\n"
- title: 4.  Other Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Other Use Cases\n   ConEx information can be put to a number of uses other\
    \ than informing\n   traffic management.  These include:\n   Informing inter-operator\
    \ contracts:  ConEx information is made\n      visible to every IP node, including\
    \ border nodes between networks.\n      Network operators can use ConEx combined\
    \ with ECN markings to\n      measure how much traffic from each network contributes\
    \ to\n      congestion in the other.  As such, congestion-volume could be\n  \
    \    included as a metric in inter-operator contracts, just as volume\n      or\
    \ bit rate are included today.  This would not be an initial\n      deployment\
    \ scenario, unless ECN became widely deployed.\n   Enabling more efficient capacity\
    \ provisioning:  Section 3.2 explains\n      how operators can use ConEx-based\
    \ traffic management to encourage\n      use of scavenger transport protocols,\
    \ which significantly improves\n      the performance of interactive applications\
    \ while still allowing\n      heavy users to transfer high volumes.  Here we explain\
    \ how this\n      can also benefit network operators.\n      Today, when loss,\
    \ delay, or average utilization exceeds a certain\n      threshold, some operators\
    \ just buy more capacity without\n      attempting to manage the traffic.  Other\
    \ operators prefer to limit\n      a minority of heavy users at peak times, but\
    \ they still eventually\n      buy more capacity when utilization rises.\n   \
    \   With ConEx-based traffic management, a network operator should be\n      able\
    \ to provision capacity more efficiently.  An operator could\n      benefit from\
    \ this in a variety of ways.  For example, the operator\n      could add capacity\
    \ as it would do without ConEx, but deliver\n      better quality of service for\
    \ its users.  Or, the operator could\n      delay adding capacity while delivering\
    \ similar quality of service\n      to what it currently provides.\n"
- title: 5.  Deployment Arrangements
  contents:
  - "5.  Deployment Arrangements\n   ConEx is designed so that it can be incrementally\
    \ deployed in the\n   Internet and still be valuable for early adopters.  As long\
    \ as some\n   senders are ConEx-enabled, a network on the path can unilaterally\
    \ use\n   ConEx-aware policy devices for traffic management; no changes to\n \
    \  network forwarding elements are needed, and ConEx still works if\n   there\
    \ are other networks on the path that are unaware of ConEx marks.\n   The above\
    \ two steps seem to represent a stand-off where neither step\n   is useful until\
    \ the other has made the first move: i) some sending\n   hosts must be modified\
    \ to give information to the network, and ii) a\n   network must deploy policy\
    \ devices to monitor this information and\n   act on it.  Nonetheless, the developer\
    \ of a scavenger transport\n   protocol like LEDBAT does stand to benefit from\
    \ deploying ConEx.  In\n   this case, the developer makes the first move, expecting\
    \ it will\n   prompt at least some networks to move in response, using the ConEx\n\
    \   information to reward users of the scavenger transport protocol.\n   On the\
    \ host side, we have already shown (Figure 1) how the sender\n   piggy-backs ConEx\
    \ signals on normal data packets to re-insert\n   feedback about packet drops\
    \ (and/or ECN) back into the IP layer.  In\n   the case of TCP, [TCP-MOD] proposes\
    \ the required sender\n   modifications.  ConEx works with any TCP receiver as\
    \ long as it uses\n   SACK (selective acknowledgment), which most do.  There is\
    \ a receiver\n   optimisation [TCPM-ECN] that improves ConEx precision when using\
    \ ECN,\n   but ConEx can still use ECN without it.  Networks can make use of\n\
    \   ConEx even if the implementations of some of the transport protocols\n   on\
    \ a host do not support ConEx (e.g., the implementation of DNS over\n   UDP might\
    \ not support ConEx, while perhaps RTP over UDP and TCP\n   will).\n   On the\
    \ network side, the provider solely needs to place ConEx\n   congestion policers\
    \ at each ingress to its network in a similar\n   arrangement to the edge-policed\
    \ architecture of Diffserv [RFC2475].\n   A sender can choose whether to send\
    \ packets that support ConEx or\n   packets that don't.  ConEx-enabled packets\
    \ bring information to the\n   policer about congestion expected on the rest of\
    \ the path beyond the\n   policer.  Packets that do not support ConEx bring no\
    \ such\n   information.  Therefore, the network will tend to conservatively\n\
    \   rate-limit non-ConEx-enabled packets in order to manage the unknown\n   risk\
    \ of congestion.  In contrast, a network doesn't normally need to\n   rate-limit\
    \ ConEx-enabled packets unless they reveal a persistently\n   high contribution\
    \ to congestion.  This natural tendency for networks\n   to favour senders that\
    \ provide ConEx information reinforces ConEx\n   deployment.\n   Feasible initial\
    \ deployment scenarios exist for a broadband access\n   network [CONEX-DEPLOY],\
    \ a mobile communications network\n   [CONEX-MOBILE], and a multi-tenant data\
    \ centre [CONEX-DATA].  The\n   first two of these scenarios are believed to work\
    \ well without ECN\n   support, while the data center scenario works best with\
    \ ECN (and ECN\n   can be deployed unilaterally).\n   The above gives only the\
    \ most salient aspects of ConEx deployment.\n   For further detail, [CONEX-ABS]\
    \ describes the incremental deployment\n   features of the ConEx protocol and\
    \ the components that need to be\n   deployed for ConEx to work.\n"
- title: 6.  Experimental Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Experimental Considerations\n   ConEx is initially designed as an experimental\
    \ protocol because it\n   makes an ambitious change at the interoperability (IP)\
    \ layer, so no\n   amount of careful design can foresee all the potential feature\n\
    \   interactions with other uses of IP.  This section identifies a number\n  \
    \ of questions that would be useful to answer through well-designed\n   experiments:\n\
    \   o  Are the compromises that were made in order to fit the ConEx\n      encoding\
    \ into IP (for example, that the initial design was solely\n      for IPv6 and\
    \ not for IPv4, and that the encoding has limited\n      visibility when tunnelled\
    \ [CONEX-DESTOPT]) the right ones?\n   o  Is it possible to combine techniques\
    \ for distinguishing self-\n      congestion from shared congestion with ConEx-based\
    \ traffic\n      management such that users are not penalized for congestion that\n\
    \      does not impact others on the network?  Are other techniques\n      needed?\n\
    \   o  In practice, how does traffic management using ConEx compare with\n   \
    \   traditional techniques (Section 3.3)?  Does it give the benefits\n      claimed\
    \ in Sections 3.1 and 3.2?\n   o  Approaches are proposed for congestion policing\
    \ of ConEx traffic\n      alongside existing management (or lack thereof) of non-ConEx\n\
    \      traffic, including UDP traffic [CONEX-ABS].  Are they strategy-\n     \
    \ proof against users selectively using both?  Are there better\n      transition\
    \ strategies?\n   o  Audit devices have been designed and implemented to assure\
    \ ConEx\n      signal integrity [CONEX-ABS].  Do they achieve minimal false hits\n\
    \      and false misses in a wide range of traffic scenarios?  Are there\n   \
    \   new attacks?  Are there better audit designs to defend against\n      these?\n\
    \   o  If ECN deployment remains patchy, are the proposed initial ConEx\n    \
    \  deployment scenarios (Section 5) still useful enough to kick-start\n      deployment?\
    \  Is auditing effective when based on loss at a primary\n      bottleneck?  Can\
    \ rest-of-path congestion be approximated\n      accurately enough without ECN?\
    \  Are there other useful deployment\n      scenarios?\n   ConEx is intended to\
    \ be a generative technology that might be used\n   for unexpected purposes unforeseen\
    \ by the designers.  Therefore, this\n   list of experimental considerations is\
    \ not intended to be exhaustive.\n"
