  - "Status of the Illinois Site (Response to RFC 0116)\nAs of the date of the report,\
    \ 26 April, the Illinois Site has complete\noperational hardware connecting the\
    \ PDP-11 system with the IMP.\nDue to much trouble with the Burroughs B6500 computer,\
    \ final checkout\nof the operating system plus the network control program for\
    \ the\nPDP-11 has been seriously curtailed.  Current expectations are:\n     --checkout\
    \ of the NCP by the latter part of May\n     --installation of the PDP-11 system\
    \ in Paoli, PA (the operating\n       link between Illinois and Burroughs in Paoli)\
    \ so that the system\n       will be operational during June\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n          [ into the online\
    \ RFC archives by Tom McGhan 7/97 ]\n"
