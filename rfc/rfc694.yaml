  - "Introduction\n   This file contains information on the various protocols in the\
    \ ARPA\n   Network.  An effort will be made to keep the information current, but\n\
    \   his depends on the cooperation of the users of this file to convey\n   any\
    \ information about protocol developments, or corrections to this\n   information\
    \ to Jon Postel at SRI-ARC.\n      Online address is POSTEL@BBNB; Phone is (415)\

    \ is a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of\n   this activity\
    \ and most of this activity is with experimental\n   protocols, for those protocols,\
    \ which are official standards the\n   designation \"[Official]\" will be appended\
    \ to the name.\n   This protocol information file is online as:\n      Pathname:\

    \   Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for\n   Comments\
    \ (RFCs) and many of these are available online.  When a\n   document is accessible\
    \ online a pointer to that source will be given.\n   Also note that recent RFCs\
    \ are online at Office-1 in directory\n   <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.TXT\

    \ RFCs as an online\n   file:\n      [Office-1] <NETINFOR>RFC-INDEX.TXT\n   There\
    \ are three other online files that are relevant to protocols:\n      There is\

    \ in RFC 608, the pathname of this file is:\n         [Office-1] <NETOINFO>HOSTS.TXT\n\
    \      There are two files that list the addresses of the Network\n      Liaisons,\
    \ one file lists the online message address, and the other\n      the US Mail\

    \   The \"link number\" field has been extended from 8 to 12\n               bits\
    \ and renamed the \"message identification\" field.\n               Message type\
    \ 6 now is used to indicate a reason for at\n               type 7 (destination\

    \           be in transit between a source host and destination host\n       \
    \        should be made very soon.  This should not effect the\n             \

    \ and 3.4 add a new type of Host to Host\n                  data message, the\

  - "NATIONAL SOFTWARE WORKS\n   The national Software Works (NSW) is developing a\
    \ set of protocols\n   for its use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols\
    \ is\n   encouraged.\n   The Distributed Programming System (DPS) is intended\
    \ to facilitate\n   the sharing of resources in the network at the subroutine\
    \ level.  The\n   Distributed Programming System will be used to split NLS into\
    \ a front\n   end and back end components.  Distributed Programming system is\
    \ also\n   to be used in the NSW and the basis for communication between the\n\
    \   Works Manager, the Tool Bearing Hosts, and Front End procedure\n   packages.\n\
