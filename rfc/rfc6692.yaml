  - "1.  Introduction\n   [ARF] defined the Abuse Reporting Format, an extensible
    message\n   format for Email Feedback Reports.  These reports are used to report\n
    \  incidents of email abuse.  ARF was extended by [AUTHFAILURE-REPORT]\n   to
    enable the reporting of email authentication failures.  These\n   specifications
    provided for the source IP address to be included in a\n   report.  As explained
    in [LOG], the deployment of IP address sharing\n   techniques requires the source
    port values to be included in reports\n   if unambiguous identification of the
    origin of abuse is to be\n   achieved.\n   This document defines an ARF reporting
    field to contain this\n   information and provides guidance for its use.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Keywords\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n"
  title: 2.  Keywords
- contents:
  - "3.  Source-Port Field Definition\n   A new ARF header field called \"Source-Port\"
    is defined.  When present\n   in a report, it MUST contain the client port of
    the TCP connection\n   from which the reported message originated, corresponding
    to the\n   \"Source-IP\" field that contains the client address of that same\n
    \  connection, thereby describing completely the origin of the abuse\n   incident.\n
    \  Per, [ABNF], the formal syntax is:\n     source-port = \"Source-Port:\" [CFWS]
    1*5DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF\n   \"CFWS\", which represents email-style comments or folding
    white space,\n   is imported from [MAIL].\n   When any report is generated that
    includes the \"Source-IP\" field (see\n   Section 3.2 of [ARF]), this field SHOULD
    also be present, unless the\n   port number is unavailable.\n   Use of this field
    is RECOMMENDED for reports generated per\n   [AUTHFAILURE-REPORT] (see Section
    3.1 of that document).\n"
  title: 3.  Source-Port Field Definition
- contents:
  - "4.  Time Accuracy\n   [LOG] underscores the importance of accurate clocks when
    generating\n   reports that include source port information because of the fact
    that\n   source ports can be recycled very quickly in Internet Service\n   Provider
    environments.  The same considerations described there apply\n   here.\n   Report
    generators that include an Arrival-Date report field MAY\n   choose to express
    the value of that date in Universal Coordinated\n   Time (UTC) to enable simpler
    correlation with local records at sites\n   that are following the provisions
    of [LOG].\n"
  title: 4.  Time Accuracy
- contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added the following entry to the \"Feedback
    Report Header\n   Fields\" registry:\n   Field Name:  Source-Port\n   Description:
    \ TCP source port from which the original message was\n      received\n   Multiple
    Appearances:  No\n   Related \"Feedback-Type\":  any\n   Reference:  [RFC6692]\n
    \  Status:  current\n"
  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This extension introduces no new security considerations
    not already\n   covered in [ARF].\n   Some security considerations related to
    the general topic of source\n   port logging can be found in [LOG].\n"
