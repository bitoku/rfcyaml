  - "Abstract\n   This option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n
    \  client to optionally identify the type or category of user or\n   applications
    it represents.  The information contained in this option\n   is an opaque field
    that represents the user class of which the client\n   is a member.  Based on
    this class, a DHCP server selects the\n   appropriate address pool to assign an
    address to the client and the\n   appropriate configuration parameters.  This
    option should be\n   configurable by a user.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   DHCP administrators may define specific user class identifiers
    to\n   convey information about a client's software configuration or about\n   its
    user's preferences.  For example, the User Class option can be\n   used to configure
    all clients of people in the accounting department\n   with a different printer
    than clients of people in the marketing\n   department.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"

  - "3. DHCP Terminology\n   o \"DHCP client\"\n     A DHCP client or \"client\" is
    an Internet host using DHCP to obtain\n     configuration parameters such as a
    network address.\n   o \"DHCP server\"\n     A DHCP server or \"server\" is an
    Internet host that returns\n     configuration parameters to DHCP clients.\n   o
    \"binding\"\n     A binding is a collection of configuration parameters, including
    at\n     least an IP address, associated with or \"bound to\" a DHCP client.\n
    \    Bindings are managed by DHCP servers.\n"

  - "4. User Class option\n   This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify
    the type\n   or category of user or applications it represents.  A DHCP server\n
    \  uses the User Class option to choose the address pool it allocates an\n   address
    from and/or to select any other configuration option.\n   This option is a DHCP
    option [1, 2].\n   This option MAY carry multiple User Classes.  Servers may interpret\n
    \  the meanings of multiple class specifications in an implementation\n   dependent
    or configuration dependent manner, and so the use of\n   multiple classes by a
    DHCP client should be based on the specific\n   server implementation and configuration
    which will be used to process\n   that User class option.\n   The format of this
    option is as follows:\n         Code   Len   Value\n        +-----+-----+---------------------
    \ . . .  --+\n        | 77  |  N  | User Class Data ('Len' octets) |\n        +-----+-----+---------------------
    \ . . .  --+\n   where Value consists of one or more instances of User Class Data.\n
    \  Each instance of User Class Data is formatted as follows:\n         UC_Len_i
    \    User_Class_Data_i\n        +--------+------------------------  . . .  --+\n
    \       |  L_i   | Opaque-Data ('UC_Len_i' octets)   |\n        +--------+------------------------
    \ . . .  --+\n   Each User Class value (User_Class_Data_i) is indicated as an
    opaque\n   field.  The value in UC_Len_i does not include the length field\n   itself
    and MUST be non-zero.  Let m be the number of User Classes\n   carried in the
    option.  The length of the option as specified in Len\n   must be the sum of the
    lengths of each of the class names plus m:\n   Len= UC_Len_1 + UC_Len_2 + ...
    + UC_Len_m + m.  If any instances of\n   User Class Data are present, the minimum
    value of Len is two (Len =\n   UC_Len_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2).\n   The Code for this
    option is 77.\n   A server that is not equipped to interpret any given user class\n
    \  specified by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).\n   If
    a server recognizes one or more user classes specified by the\n   client, but
    does not recognize one or more other user classes\n   specified by the client,
    the server MAY use the user classes it\n   recognizes.\n   DHCP clients implementing
    this option SHOULD allow users to enter one\n   or more user class values.\n"

    purpose, should\n   be used as the User Class Option for DHCP.\n"

  - "6. Security Considerations\n   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security
    mechanisms.\n   Potential exposures to attack are discussed is section 7 of the\n
    \  protocol specification [1].\n   This lack of authentication mechanism means
    that a DHCP server cannot\n   check if a client or user is authorized to use a
    given User Class.\n   This introduces an obvious vulnerability when using the
    User Class\n   option.  For example, if the User Class is used to give out a special\n
    \  parameter (e.g., a particular database server), there is no way to\n   authenticate
    a client and it is therefore impossible to check if a\n   client is authorized
    to use this parameter.\n"
