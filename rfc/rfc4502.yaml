  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   The RMON2 MIB defines objects that provide RMON analysis up\
    \ to the\n   application layer.\n   Remote network monitoring devices, often called\
    \ monitors or probes,\n   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing\
    \ a network.\n   Often, these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote\n\
    \   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a\n   network.\
    \  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per\n   network segment,\
    \ to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices\n   may be used for a network\
    \ management service provider to access a\n   client network, which is often geographically\
    \ remote.\n   The objects defined in this document are intended to serve as an\n\
    \   interface between an RMON agent and an RMON management application\n   and\
    \ are not intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some\n   users may\
    \ tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few\n   will tolerate\
    \ the complexity of manually manipulating objects to\n   accomplish row creation.\
    \  The management application should handle\n   these functions.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Remote Network Management Goals
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Remote Network Management Goals\n   o  Offline Operation\n      There are\
    \ times when a management station will not be in constant\n      contact with\
    \ its remote monitoring devices.  This sometimes occurs\n      by design, in an\
    \ attempt to lower communications costs (especially\n      when communicating\
    \ over a WAN or dialup link), or by accident, as\n      network failures affect\
    \ the communications between the management\n      station and the probe.\n  \
    \    For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be configured to\n      perform\
    \ diagnostics and to collect statistics continuously, even\n      when communication\
    \ with the management station may not be possible\n      or efficient.  The probe\
    \ may then attempt to notify the management\n      station when an exceptional\
    \ condition occurs.  Thus, even in\n      circumstances where communication between\
    \ the management station\n      and probe is not continuous, fault, performance,\
    \ and configuration\n      information may be continuously accumulated and communicated\
    \ to\n      the management station conveniently and efficiently.\n   o  Proactive\
    \ Monitoring\n      Given the resources available on the monitor, it is potentially\n\
    \      helpful for it to run diagnostics continuously and to log network\n   \
    \   performance.  The monitor is always available at the onset of any\n      failure.\
    \  It can notify the management station of the failure and\n      can store historical\
    \ statistical information about the failure.\n      This historical information\
    \ can be played back by the management\n      station in an attempt to perform\
    \ further diagnosis of the cause of\n      the problem.\n   o  Problem Detection\
    \ and Reporting\n      The monitor can be configured to recognize conditions,\
    \ most\n      notably error conditions, and to check for them continuously.\n\
    \      When one of these conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and\n   \
    \   management stations may be notified in a number of ways.\n   o  Value Added\
    \ Data\n      Because a remote monitoring device represents a network resource\n\
    \      dedicated exclusively to network management functions, and because\n  \
    \    it is located directly on the monitored portion of the network,\n      the\
    \ remote network monitoring device has the opportunity to add\n      significant\
    \ value to the data it collects.  For instance, by\n      highlighting those hosts\
    \ on the network that generate the most\n      traffic or errors, the probe can\
    \ give the management station\n      precisely the information it needs to solve\
    \ a class of problems.\n   o  Multiple Managers\n      An organization may have\
    \ multiple management stations for\n      different units of the organization,\
    \ for different functions\n      (e.g., engineering and operations), and in order\
    \ to provide\n      disaster recovery.  Because environments with multiple management\n\
    \      stations are common, the remote network monitoring device has to\n    \
    \  deal with more than one management station, potentially using its\n      resources\
    \ concurrently.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Structure of MIB\n   The objects are arranged into the following groups:\n\
    \      - protocol directory\n      - protocol distribution\n      - address mapping\n\
    \      - network layer host\n      - network layer matrix\n      - application\
    \ layer host\n      - application layer matrix\n      - user history\n      -\
    \ probe configuration\n   These groups are the basic units of conformance.  If\
    \ a remote\n   monitoring device implements a group, then it must implement all\n\
    \   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent that implements\n   the\
    \ network layer matrix group must implement the nlMatrixSDTable and\n   the nlMatrixDSTable.\n\
    \   Implementations of this MIB must also implement the IF-MIB [RFC2863].\n  \
    \ These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object\n   identifiers,\
    \ and to provide a method for managed agents to know which\n   objects they must\
    \ implement.\n   This document also contains AUGMENTing tables to extend some\
    \ tables\n   defined in the RMON MIB [RFC2819].  These extensions include the\n\
    \   following:\n      1) Adding the DroppedFrames and LastCreateTime conventions\
    \ to each\n         table defined in the RMON MIB.\n      2) Augmenting the RMON\
    \ filter table with a mechanism that allows\n         filtering based on an offset\
    \ from the beginning of a particular\n         protocol, even if the protocol\
    \ headers are of variable length.\n      3) Augmenting the RMON filter and capture\
    \ status bits with\n         additional bits for WAN media and generic media.\
    \  These bits\n         are defined here as follows:\n         Bit     Definition\n\
    \         6       For WAN media, this bit is set for packets\n               \
    \  coming from one direction and cleared for\n                 packets coming\
    \ from the other direction.\n                 It is an implementation-specific\
    \ matter\n                 as to which bit is assigned to which\n            \
    \     direction, but it must be consistent for\n                 all packets received\
    \ by the agent.  If\n                 the agent knows which end of the link is\n\
    \                 \"local\" and which end is \"network\", the bit\n          \
    \       should be set for packets from the \"local\"\n                 side and\
    \ should be cleared for packets from\n                 the \"network\" side.\n\
    \         7       For any media, this bit is set for any packet\n            \
    \     with a physical layer error.  This bit may be\n                 set in addition\
    \ to other media-specific bits\n                 that denote the same condition.\n\
    \         8       For any media, this bit is set for any packet\n            \
    \     that is too short for the media.  This bit may\n                 be set\
    \ in addition to other media-specific\n                 bits that denote the same\
    \ condition.\n         9       For any media, this bit is set for any packet\n\
    \                 that is too long for the media.  This bit may\n            \
    \     be set in addition to other media-specific bits\n                 that denote\
    \ the same condition.\n   These enhancements are implemented by RMON-2 probes\
    \ that also\n   implement RMON and do not add any requirements to probes that\
    \ are\n   compliant to just RMON.\n"
- title: 3.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices
  contents:
  - "3.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices\n   Due to the complex nature\
    \ of the available functions in these\n   devices, the functions often need user\
    \ configuration.  In many cases,\n   the function requires that parameters be\
    \ set up for a data collection\n   operation.  The operation can proceed only\
    \ after these parameters are\n   fully set up.\n   Many functional groups in this\
    \ MIB have one or more tables in which\n   to set up control parameters, and one\
    \ or more data tables in which to\n   place the results of the operation.  The\
    \ control tables are typically\n   read/write in nature, while the data tables\
    \ are typically read-only.\n   Because the parameters in the control table often\
    \ describe resulting\n   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be\
    \ modified only\n   when the control entry is not active.  Thus, the method for\
    \ modifying\n   these parameters is to deactivate the entry, perform the SNMP\
    \ Set\n   operations to modify the entry, and then reactivate the entry.\n   Deleting\
    \ the control entry causes the deletion of any associated data\n   entries, which\
    \ also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the\n   resources used by the\
    \ associated data.\n   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute\
    \ an action on\n   the remote monitoring device.  These objects may execute an\
    \ action as\n   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects\n\
    \   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it\n   currently\
    \ holds would thus cause no action to occur.\n   To facilitate control by multiple\
    \ managers, resources have to be\n   shared among the managers.  These resources\
    \ are typically the memory\n   and computation resources that a function requires.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Resource Sharing among Multiple Management Stations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Resource Sharing among Multiple Management Stations\n   When multiple management\
    \ stations wish to use functions that compete\n   for a finite amount of resources\
    \ on a device, a method to facilitate\n   this sharing of resources is required.\
    \  Potential conflicts include\n   the following:\n      o  Two management stations\
    \ wish to use resources simultaneously\n         that together would exceed the\
    \ capability of the device.\n      o  A management station uses a significant\
    \ amount of resources for\n         a long period of time.\n      o  A management\
    \ station uses resources and then crashes,\n         forgetting to free the resources\
    \ so that others may use them.\n   The OwnerString mechanism is provided for each\
    \ management station-\n   initiated function in this MIB to avoid these conflicts\
    \ and to help\n   resolve them when they occur.  Each function has a label identifying\n\
    \   the initiator (owner) of the function.  This label is set by the\n   initiator\
    \ to provide for the following possibilities:\n      o  A management station may\
    \ recognize resources it owns and no\n         longer needs.\n      o  A network\
    \ operator can find the management station that owns\n         the resource and\
    \ negotiate for it to be freed.\n      o  A network operator may decide unilaterally\
    \ to free resources\n         another network operator has reserved.\n      o\
    \  Upon initialization, a management station may recognize\n         resources\
    \ it had reserved in the past.  With this information,\n         it may free the\
    \ resources if it no longer needs them.\n   Management stations and probes should\
    \ support any format of the owner\n   string dictated by the local policy of the\
    \ organization.  It is\n   suggested that this name contain one or more of the\
    \ following: IP\n   address, management station name, network manager's name,\
    \ location,\n   or phone number.  This information will help users share the\n\
    \   resources more effectively.\n   There is often default functionality that\
    \ the device or the\n   administrator of the probe (often the network administrator)\
    \ wishes\n   to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are\
    \ then\n   owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and they\n\
    \   are intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the\n   administrator\
    \ will set the relevant owner object to a string starting\n   with 'monitor'.\
    \  Indiscriminate modification of the monitor-owned\n   configuration by network\
    \ management stations is discouraged.  In\n   fact, a network management station\
    \ should only modify these objects\n   under the direction of the administrator\
    \ of the probe.\n   Resources on a probe are scarce and are typically allocated\
    \ when\n   control rows are created by an application.  Since many applications\n\
    \   may be using a probe simultaneously, indiscriminate allocation of\n   resources\
    \ to particular applications is very likely to cause resource\n   shortages in\
    \ the probe.\n   When a network management station wishes to utilize a function\
    \ in a\n   monitor, it is encouraged first to scan the control table of that\n\
    \   function to find an instance with similar parameters to share.  This\n   is\
    \ especially true for those instances owned by the monitor, which\n   can be assumed\
    \ to change infrequently.  If a management station\n   decides to share an instance\
    \ owned by another management station, it\n   should understand that the management\
    \ station that owns the instance\n   may indiscriminately modify or delete it.\n\
    \   Note that a management application should have the most trust in a\n   monitor-owned\
    \ row, because it should be changed very infrequently.  A\n   row owned by the\
    \ management application is less long-lived because a\n   network administrator\
    \ is more likely to reassign resources from a row\n   that is in use by one user\
    \ than those from a monitor-owned row that\n   is potentially in use by many users.\
    \  A row owned by another\n   application would be even less long-lived because\
    \ the other\n   application may delete or modify that row completely at its\n\
    \   discretion.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Row Addition among Multiple Management Stations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Row Addition among Multiple Management Stations\n   The addition of new\
    \ rows is achieved using the RowStatus Textual\n   Convention [RFC2579].  In this\
    \ MIB, rows are often added to a table\n   in order to configure a function. \
    \ This configuration usually\n   involves parameters that control the operation\
    \ of the function.  The\n   agent must check these parameters to make sure they\
    \ are appropriate\n   given the restrictions defined in this MIB, as well as any\n\
    \   implementation-specific restrictions, such as lack of resources.  The\n  \
    \ agent implementor may be confused as to when to check these\n   parameters and\
    \ when to signal to the management station that the\n   parameters are invalid.\
    \  There are two opportunities:\n      o  When the management station sets each\
    \ parameter object.\n      o  When the management station sets the row status\
    \ object to\n         active.\n   If the latter option is chosen, it would be\
    \ unclear to the management\n   station which of the several parameters was invalid\
    \ and caused the\n   badValue error to be emitted.  Thus, wherever possible, the\n\
    \   implementor should choose the former option, as it will provide more\n   information\
    \ to the management station.\n   A problem can arise when multiple management\
    \ stations attempt to set\n   configuration information simultaneously using SNMP.\
    \  When this\n   involves the addition of a new conceptual row in the same control\n\
    \   table, the managers may collide, attempting to create the same entry.\n  \
    \ To guard against these collisions, each such control entry contains a\n   status\
    \ object with special semantics that help arbitrate among the\n   managers.  If\
    \ an attempt is made with the row addition mechanism to\n   create such a status\
    \ object and that object already exists, an error\n   is returned.  When more\
    \ than one manager simultaneously attempts to\n   create the same conceptual row,\
    \ only the first will succeed.  The\n   others will receive an error.\n   In the\
    \ RMON MIB [RFC2819], the EntryStatus textual convention was\n   introduced to\
    \ provide this mutual exclusion function.  Since then,\n   this function was added\
    \ to the SNMP framework as the RowStatus\n   textual convention.  The RowStatus\
    \ textual convention is used for the\n   definition of all new tables.\n   When\
    \ a manager wishes to create a new control entry, it needs to\n   choose an index\
    \ for that row.  It may choose this index in a variety\n   of ways, hopefully\
    \ minimizing the chances that the index is in use by\n   another manager.  If\
    \ the index is in use, the mechanism mentioned\n   previously will guard against\
    \ collisions.  Examples of schemes to\n   choose index values include random selection\
    \ or scanning the control\n   table while looking for the first unused index.\
    \  Because index values\n   may be any valid value in the range and are chosen\
    \ by the manager,\n   the agent must allow a row to be created with any unused\
    \ index value\n   if it has the resources to create a new row.\n   Some tables\
    \ in this MIB reference other tables within this MIB.  When\n   creating or deleting\
    \ entries in these tables, it is generally\n   allowable for dangling references\
    \ to exist.  There is no defined\n   order for creating or deleting entries in\
    \ these tables.\n"
- title: 4.  Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.  Conventions\n   The following conventions are used throughout the RMON MIB\
    \ and its\n   companion documents.\n   Good Packets\n      Good packets are error-free\
    \ packets that have a valid frame\n      length.  For example, on Ethernet, good\
    \ packets are error-free\n      packets that are between 64 octets and 1518 octets\
    \ long.  They\n      follow the form defined in IEEE 802.3 section 3.2.all.\n\
    \   Bad Packets\n      Bad packets are packets that have proper framing and are\
    \ therefore\n      recognized as packets, but that contain errors within the packet\n\
    \      or have an invalid length.  For example, on Ethernet, bad packets\n   \
    \   have a valid preamble and SFD but have a bad CRC, or they are\n      either\
    \ shorter than 64 octets or longer than 1518 octets.\n"

    \ that is not\n   limited to MAC-layer and network-layer protocols, but can also\n\
    \   include transport, session, presentation, and application-layer\n   protocols.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Protocol Directory and Limited Extensibility
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Protocol Directory and Limited Extensibility\n   Every RMON 2 implementation\
    \ will have the capability to parse certain\n   types of packets and identify\
    \ their protocol type at multiple levels.\n   The protocol directory presents\
    \ an inventory of protocol types the\n   probe is capable of monitoring and allows\
    \ the addition, deletion, and\n   configuration of protocol types in this list.\n\
    \   One concept deserves special attention: the \"limited extensibility\"\n  \
    \ of the protocol directory table.  Using the RMON 2 model, protocols\n   are\
    \ detected by static software that has been written at\n   implementation time.\
    \  Therefore, as a matter of configuration, an\n   implementation cannot suddenly\
    \ learn how to parse new packet types.\n   However, an implementation may be written\
    \ such that the software\n   knows where the demultiplexing field is for a particular\
    \ protocol,\n   and it can be written in such a way that the decoding of the next\n\
    \   layer up is table driven.  This works when the code has been written\n   to\
    \ accommodate it and can be extended no more than one level higher.\n   This extensibility\
    \ is called \"limited extensibility\" to highlight\n   these limitations.  However,\
    \ this can be a very useful tool.\n   For example, suppose that an implementation\
    \ has C code that\n   understands how to decode IP packets on any of several ethernet\n\
    \   encapsulations, and also knows how to interpret the IP protocol field\n  \
    \ to recognize UDP packets and how to decode the UDP port number\n   fields. \
    \ That implementation may be table driven so that among the\n   many different\
    \ UDP port numbers possible, it is configured to\n   recognize 161 as SNMP, port\
    \ 53 as DNS, and port 69 as TFTP.  The\n   limited extensibility of the protocol\
    \ directory table would allow an\n   SNMP operation to create an entry that would\
    \ create an additional\n   table mapping for UDP that would recognize UDP port\
    \ 123 as NTP and\n   begin counting such packets.\n   This limited extensibility\
    \ is an option that an implementation can\n   choose to allow or disallow for\
    \ any protocol that has child\n   protocols.\n"

    \     \"To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application\n      to\
    \ download only those rows changed since a particular time.\n      Note that this\
    \ is not a history mechanism.  Only current values\n      of underlying objects\
    \ are returned; saved instance values\n      associated with particular values\
    \ of sysUpTime are not.\n      An entry is considered changed if the value of\
    \ any object in the\n      entry changes, if the row is created, or if any object\
    \ in the\n      entry is created or deleted.  Note that deleted entries cannot\n\
    \      be detected or downloaded.\n      A time-filtered conceptual table is created\
    \ by inserting a\n      single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX\
    \ component\n      in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any\n\
    \      SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component).  Thus, for\n      each\
    \ conceptual entry 'I' in the basic table, there exists N\n      conceptual entries\
    \ in the time-filtered version, indexed N.I,\n      where 'N' is equal to the\
    \ value of sysUpTime.\n      When an application retrieves conceptual instances\
    \ from a\n      time-filtered table, and an INDEX value is provided for the\n\
    \      TimeFilter INDEX component 'N', the agent will only consider\n      returning\
    \ basic conceptual entries (e.g., 'fooColumn.N.I') if\n      any column within\
    \ the basic conceptual entry has changed since\n      sysUpTime 'N'.  If not,\
    \ the basic conceptual entry will\n      be ignored for the particular retrieval\
    \ operation.\n      When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.\n\
    \      One conceptual entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime,\n      except\
    \ that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.\n      As an entry in\
    \ a time-filtered table is updated (i.e., one of\n      the columns in the basic\
    \ conceptual table is changed), new\n      conceptual entries are also created\
    \ in the time-filtered version\n      (which still shares the now updated object\
    \ values with all other\n      instances).  The number of unique time-filtered\
    \ instances that\n      are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at\
    \ which the\n      basic entry was last updated.  One unique instance will exist\n\
    \      for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.\n    \
    \  However, a new TimeFilter index instance is created for each new\n      sysUpTime\
    \ value.  The TimeFilter index values not associated\n      with entry updates\
    \ are called duplicate time-filtered instances.\n      After some deployment experience,\
    \ it has been determined that\n      a time-filtered table is more efficient if\
    \ the agent\n      stops a MIB walk operation by skipping over rows with a\n \
    \     TimeFilter index value higher than the value in the received\n      GetNext/GetBulk\
    \ request.  That is, instead of incrementing a\n      TimeFilter index value,\
    \ the agent will continue to the next\n      object or table.  As a consequence,\
    \ GetNext or GetBulk\n      operations will provide only one pass through a time-filtered\n\
    \      table.\n      It is suggested that an agent implement a time-filtered table\n\
    \      in this manner to improve performance and avoid a MIB walk\n      getting\
    \ stuck in time-filtered tables.  It is, however, still\n      acceptable for\
    \ an agent to implement a time-filtered table in\n      the traditional manner\
    \ (i.e., every conceptual time-filtered\n      instance is returned in GetNext\
    \ and GetBulk PDU responses), and\n      management applications must be able\
    \ to deal with such\n      traditional implementations.\n      See the appendix\
    \ for further discussion of this textual\n      convention.\n      The following\
    \ example is provided to demonstrate TimeFilter\n      behavior:\n      Consider\
    \ the following basic conceptual table, basicFooTable.\n      (Note that the basic\
    \ version of a time-filtered table may not\n      actually be defined.)\n    \
    \      basicFooTable:\n          basicFooTable ...\n          INDEX { fooIndex\
    \ }\n          BasicFooEntry {\n             fooIndex     Integer32,\n       \
    \      fooCounts    Counter32\n          }\n      For this example, the basicFooTable\
    \ contains two static\n      conceptual entries (fooIndex equals '1' and '2'),\
    \ created at\n      time zero.  It also contains one dynamic conceptual entry\n\
    \      (fooIndex equals '3'), which is created at time '3' and deleted\n     \
    \ at time '7'.\n      The time-filtered version of the basicFooTable could be\
    \ defined\n      as follows:\n          FooTable:\n          fooTable ...\n  \
    \        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }\n          FooEntry {\n             fooTimeMark\
    \  TimeFilter,\n             fooIndex     Integer32,\n             fooCounts \
    \   Counter32\n          }\n      Note that entries exist in the time-filtered\
    \ conceptual table\n      only if they actually exist in the underlying (basic)\
    \ table.\n      For this example, the fooTable will have three underlying\n  \
    \    basic entries (fooIndex == 1, 2, and 3), with the following\n      activity\
    \ (for sysUpTime equal 0 to 9):\n         - fooEntry.N.1 is created at time '0'\
    \ and most recently\n           updated at time '6' to the value '5'.\n      \
    \   - fooEntry.N.2 is created at time '0' and most recently\n           updated\
    \ at time '8' to the value '9'.\n         - fooEntry.N.3 is created at time '3',\
    \ updated at time '5'\n           to the value '17', and deleted at time '7'.\n\
    \     The following tables show the values that would be returned for\n     MIB\
    \ walk operations with various TimeFilter values, done at\n     different times.\
    \  An application issues a retrieval request at\n     time 'T', with a TimeFilter\
    \ value, 'N' (typically set to a lower\n     value, such as the value of sysUpTime\
    \ at the last polling cycle).\n     The following values would be returned in\
    \ a MIB walk of\n     fooCounts.N if T equals '0' and N equals '0':\n        \
    \   fooCounts.N.I    Value\n           ==========================\n          \
    \ fooCounts.0.1    0\n           fooCounts.0.2    0\n       Note that nothing\
    \ is returned for fooCounts.0.3, since that\n       entry does not exist at sysUpTime\
    \ equals '0'.\n     The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)\
    \ MIB\n     walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '3' and N equals '0':\n          \
    \ fooCounts.N.I    Value\n           =======================\n           fooCounts.0.1\
    \    0\n           fooCounts.0.2    0\n           fooCounts.0.3    0\n       \
    \    fooCounts.1.3    0\n           fooCounts.2.3    0\n           fooCounts.3.3\
    \    0\n       Note that there are no instances for T equals 1 or 2 for the\n\
    \       first two values of N, as these entries did not change\n       since they\
    \ were created at time '0'.\n       Note that the current value for 'fooCounts.N.3'\
    \ is returned\n       here, even for values of N less than '3' (when the entry\
    \ was\n       created).  The agent only considers the current existence of an\n\
    \       entry in the TimeFilter algorithm, not the time when the entry\n     \
    \  was created.\n       Note that the instances 'fooCounts.0.3', 'fooCounts.1.3',\n\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   In order to implement this MIB, a probe must\
    \ capture all packets on\n   the locally-attached network, including packets between\
    \ third\n   parties.  These packets are analyzed to collect network addresses,\n\
    \   protocol usage information, and conversation statistics.  Data of\n   this\
    \ nature may be considered sensitive in some environments.  In\n   such environments,\
    \ the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP access\n   to the probe.\n   The\
    \ usrHistoryGroup periodically samples the values of user-specified\n   variables\
    \ on the probe and stores them in another table.  Since the\n   access-control\
    \ specified for a stored snapshot may be different from\n   the access-control\
    \ for the sampled variable, the agent MUST ensure\n   that usrHistoryObjectVariable\
    \ is not writable in MIB views that don't\n   already have read access to the\
    \ entire agent.  Because the access\n   control configuration can change over\
    \ time, information could later\n   be deemed sensitive that would still be accessible\
    \ to this function.\n   For this reason, an agent SHOULD check the access control\
    \ on every\n   sample.  If an agent doesn't implement the latter check, there\
    \ is\n   potential for sensitive information to be revealed.\n   A probe implementing\
    \ this MIB is likely to also implement RMON\n   [RFC2819], which includes functions\
    \ for returning the contents of\n   captured packets, potentially including sensitive\
    \ user data or\n   passwords.  It is recommended that SNMP access to these functions\
    \ be\n   restricted.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n\
    \   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n   Some of\
    \ the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS\
    \ other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in\
    \ some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or\
    \ NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of\
    \ these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"

    \ required for a 'table-update' operation, by retrieving\n   only the rows that\
    \ have changed since a specified time (usually the\n   last poll time).  Polling\
    \ of tables that incorporate a 'TimeFilter'\n   INDEX can be reduced to a theoretical\
    \ minimum (if used correctly).\n   It can be easily implemented by an agent in\
    \ a way independent of the\n   number of NMS applications using the same time-filtered\
    \ table.\n   Although the name 'TimeFilter' may imply that a history of change\n\
    \   events is maintained by the agent, this is not the case.  A time-\n   filtered-value\
    \ represents the current value of the object instance,\n   not the 'saved' value\
    \ at the time indicated by the TimeFilter INDEX\n   value.  Note that TimeFilter\
    \ objects only appear in INDEX clauses\n   (always not-accessible), so their value\
    \ is never retrieved.  By\n   design, the actual value of a TimeFilter instance\
    \ is not in itself\n   meaningful (it's not a 'last-change-timestamp').\n   The\
    \ TimeFilter is a boolean filtering function applied in internal\n   Get* PDU\
    \ processing.  If the 'last-change-time' of the specified\n   instance is less\
    \ than the particular TimeFilter INDEX value, then the\n   instance is considered\
    \ 'not-present', and either it is skipped for\n   GetNext and GetBulk PDUs, or\
    \ a 'noSuchInstance' exception is returned\n   for Get PDUs.\n   For TimeFilter\
    \ purposes:\n      -  a row is created when an accessible column is created within\n\
    \         the row.\n      -  a column that is created or deleted causes the TimeFilter\
    \ to\n         update the time-stamp, only because the value of the column is\n\
    \         changing (non-existent <-> some value).\n      -  a row is deleted when\
    \ all accessible columns are deleted.  This\n         event is not detectable\
    \ with TimeFilter, and deleted rows are\n         not retrievable with SNMP.\n\
    \   1.1) Agent Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table\n   In implementation,\
    \ the time-filtered rows (one for each tick of\n   sysUpTime) are only conceptual.\
    \  The agent simply filters a real\n   table based on:\n      *  the current value\
    \ of sysUpTime,\n      *  the TimeFilter value passed in the varbind, and\n  \
    \    *  the last-update timestamp of each requested row (agent\n         implementation\
    \ requirement).\n   For example, to implement a time-filtered table row (e.g.,\
    \ set of\n   counters), an agent maintains a timestamp in a 32-bit storage\n \
    \  location, initialized to zero.  This is in addition to whatever\n   instrumentation\
    \ is needed for the set of counters.\n   Each time one of the counters is updated,\
    \ the current value of\n   sysUpTime is recorded in the associated timestamp.\
    \  If this is not\n   possible or practical, then a background polling process\
    \ must\n   'refresh' the timestamp by sampling counter values and comparing them\n\
    \   to recorded samples.  The timestamp update must occur within 5\n   seconds\
    \ of the actual change event.\n   When an agent receives a Get, GetNext, or GetBulk\
    \ PDU requesting a\n   time-filtered instance, after the agent has determined\
    \ that the\n   instance is within the specified MIB view, the following conceptual\n\
    \   test is applied to determine if the object is returned or filtered:\n    \
    \  /* return TRUE if the object is present */\n      boolean time_filter_test\
    \ (\n          TimeFilter  last_modified_timestamp,\n          TimeFilter  index_value_in_pdu\
    \ )\n      {\n          if (last_modified_timestamp < index_value_in_pdu)\n  \
    \            return FALSE;\n          else\n              return TRUE;\n     \
    \ }\n   The agent applies this function regardless of the lastActivationTime\n\
    \   of the conceptual row in question.  In other words, counter\n   discontinuities\
    \ are ignored (i.e., a conceptual row is deleted and\n   then re-created later).\
    \  An agent should consider an object instance\n   'changed' when it is created\
    \ (either at restart time for scalars and\n   static objects, or row-creation-time\
    \ for dynamic tables).\n   Note that using a timeFilter INDEX value of zero removes\
    \ the\n   filtering functionality, as the instance will always be 'present'\n\
    \   according to the test above.\n   After some deployment experience, it has\
    \ been determined that a\n   time-filtered table is more efficient to use if the\
    \ agent stops a MIB\n   walk operation after one time-filtered entry.  That is,\
    \ a GetNext or\n   GetBulk operation will provide one pass through a given table\
    \ (i.e.,\n   the agent will continue to the next object or table) instead of\n\
    \   incrementing a TimeMark INDEX value, even if there exist higher\n   TimeMark\
    \ values that are valid for the same conceptual row.\n   It is acceptable for\
    \ an agent to implement a time-filtered table in\n   this manner or in the traditional\
    \ manner (i.e., every conceptual\n   time-filtered instance is returned in GetNext\
    \ and GetBulk PDU\n   responses).\n   1.2) NMS Implementation of a Time-Filtered\
    \ Table\n   The particular TimeFilter INDEX values used by an NMS reflect the\n\
    \   polling interval of the NMS, relative to the particular agent's\n   notion\
    \ of sysUpTime.\n   An NMS needs to maintain one timestamp variable per agent\n\
    \   (initialized to zero) for an arbitrary group of time-filtered MIB\n   objects\
    \ that are gathered together in the same PDU.  Each time the\n   Get* PDU is sent,\
    \ a request for sysUpTime is included.  The retrieved\n   sysUpTime value is used\
    \ as the timeFilter value in the next polling\n   cycle.  If a polling sweep of\
    \ a time-filtered group of objects\n   requires more than one SNMP transaction,\
    \ then the sysUpTime value\n   retrieved in the first GetResponse PDU of the polling\
    \ sweep is saved\n   as the next timeFilter value.\n   The actual last-update\
    \ time of a given object is not indicated in the\n   returned GetResponse instance\
    \ identifier, but rather the timeFilter\n   value passed in the Get*Request PDU\
    \ is returned.\n   A \"time-filtered get-next/bulk-sweep\", done once per polling\
    \ cycle,\n   is a series of GetNext or GetBulk transactions and is over when one\n\
    \   of the following events occurs:\n      1) the TimeFilter index value returned\
    \ in the GetResponse is\n         different from the TimeFilter index value passed\
    \ in the GetNext\n         or GetBulk request.  Counter values will still be returned\n\
    \         beyond this point (until the last-change-time is reached), but\n   \
    \      most likely the same values will be returned.\n      2) the return PDU\
    \ includes instances lexigraphically greater than\n         the objects expected\
    \ (i.e., same GetNext semantics as if the\n         TimeFilter weren't there).\n\
    \      3) a noSuchName or other exception/error is returned.\n   Note that the\
    \ use of a time-filtered table in combination with a\n   GetRequest PDU neutralizes\
    \ any optimization that otherwise might be\n   achieved with the TimeFilter. \
    \ Either the current time-filtered\n   object-value is returned, or, if there\
    \ is no time-filtered object-\n   value instance, then a 'noSuchInstance' exception\
    \ (SNMPv2c or SNMPv3)\n   or 'noSuchName' error (SNMPv1) is returned.\n   2) TimeFilter\
    \ Example\n   The following example demonstrates how an NMS and Agent might use\
    \ a\n   table with a TimeFilter object in the INDEX.  A static table is\n   assumed\
    \ to keep the example simple, but dynamic tables can also be\n   supported.\n\
    \   2.1) General Assumptions\n      fooEntry INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIfIndex }\n\
    \      FooEntry = SEQUENCE {\n          fooTimeMark    TimeFilter,\n         \
    \ fooIfIndex     Integer32,\n          fooCounts      Counter32\n      }\n   The\
    \ NMS polls the fooTable every 15 seconds, and the baseline poll\n   occurs when\
    \ the agent has been up for 6 seconds, and when the NMS has\n   been up for 10\
    \ seconds.\n   There are 2 static rows in this table at system initialization\n\
    \   (fooCounts.0.1 and fooCounts.0.2).\n   Row 1 was updated as follows:\n   \
    \      SysUpTime    fooCounts.*.1 value\n            500            1\n      \
    \      900            2\n            2300           3\n   Row 2 was updated as\
    \ follows:\n         SysUpTime    fooCounts.*.2 value\n            1100      \
    \     1\n            1400           2\n   2.2) SNMP Transactions from NMS Perspective\n\

  - "9.  Changes since RFC 2021\n   This version obsoletes the proposed-standard version\
    \ of the RMON2 MIB\n   (published as RFC 2021) by adding 2 new enumerations to\
    \ the\n   nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase object and 4 new enumerations to the\n \
    \  alMatrixTopNControlRateBase object.  These new enumerations support\n   the\
    \ creation of high capacity top N reports in the High Capacity RMON\n   MIB [RFC3273].\n\
    \   Additionally, the following objects have been deprecated, as they\n   have\
    \ not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate\n   interoperability\

    \   In addition, two corrections were made.  The LastCreateTime Textual\n   Convention\
    \ had been defined with a base type of another textual\n   convention, which isn't\
    \ allowed in SMIv2.  The definition has been\n   modified to use TimeTicks as\
    \ the base type.\n   Further, the SerialConfigEntry SEQUENCE definition included\
    \ sub-\n   typing information that is not allowed in SMIv2.  This information\n\
    \   has been deleted.  Ranges were added to a number of objects and\n   textual-conventions\
    \ to constrain their maximum (and sometimes\n   minimum) sizes.  The addition\
    \ of these ranges documents existing\n   practice for these objects.  These objects\
    \ are:\n      ControlString\n      protocolDirID\n      protocolDirParameters\n\
    \      addressMapNetworkAddress\n      nlHostAddress\n      nlMatrixSDSourceAddress\n\

    \      alMatrixSDEntry\n      alMatrixDSEntry\n      alMatrixTopNSourceAddress\n\
    \      alMatrixTopNDestAddress\n   Finally, the TimeFilter TC has been updated\
    \ to encourage agent\n   implementations that allow a MIB walk to behave well\
    \ even when\n   performed by an application that is not aware of the special\n\
    \   TimeFilter semantics.\n"
