- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed (see [RIPE178]\
    \ and\n   [RFC2439]) and subsequently implemented to reduce BGP churn in\n   routers.\
    \  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for\n   being well\
    \ connected because topological richness amplifies the\n   number of update messages\
    \ exchanged, see [MAO2002].  Subsequently,\n   many operators turned RFD off;\
    \ see [RIPE378].  Based on the\n   measurements of [PELSSER2011], [RIPE580] now\
    \ recommends that RFD is\n   usable with some changes to the parameters.  Based\
    \ on the same\n   measurements, this document recommends adjusting a few RFD\n\
    \   algorithmic constants and limits.  The result is damping of a non-\n   trivial\
    \ amount of long-term churn without penalizing well-behaved\n   prefixes' normal\
    \ convergence process.\n   Very few prefixes are responsible for a large amount\
    \ of the BGP\n   messages received by a router; see [HUSTON2006] and [PELSSER2011].\n\
    \   For example, the measurements in [PELSSER2011] showed that only 3% of\n  \
    \ the prefixes were responsible for 36% percent of the BGP messages at\n   a router\
    \ with real feeds from a Tier-1 provider and an Internet\n   Exchange Point during\
    \ a one-week experiment.  Only these very\n   frequently flapping prefixes should\
    \ be damped.  The values\n   recommended in Section 6 achieve this.  Thus, RFD\
    \ can be enabled, and\n   some churn reduced.\n   The goal is to, with absolutely\
    \ minimal change, ameliorate the danger\n   of current RFD implementations and\
    \ use.  It is not a panacea, nor is\n   it a deep and thorough approach to flap\
    \ reduction.\n"

  - "1.1.  Suggested Reading\n   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP [RFC4271]\
    \ and Route\n   Flap Damping [RFC2439].  This work is based on the measurements\
    \ in\n   the paper [PELSSER2011].  A survey of Japanese operators' use of RFD\n\
    \   and their desires is reported in [RFD-SURVEY].\n"

- title: 4.  Suppress Threshold versus Churn
  contents:
  - "4.  Suppress Threshold versus Churn\n   By turning RFD back on with the values\
    \ recommended in Section 6,\n   churn is reduced.  Moreover, with these values,\
    \ prefixes going\n   through normal convergence are generally not damped.\n  \
    \ [PELSSER2011] estimates that, with a suppress threshold of 6,000, the\n   BGP\
    \ update rate is reduced by 19% compared to a situation without RFD\n   enabled.\
    \  [PELSSER2011] studies the number of prefixes damped over a\n   week between\
    \ September 29, 2010 and October 6, 2010.  With this 6,000\n   suppress threshold,\
    \ 90% fewer prefixes are damped compared to use of\n   a 2,000 threshold.  That\
    \ is, far fewer well-behaved prefixes are\n   damped.\n   Setting the suppress\
    \ threshold to 12,000 leads to very few damped\n   prefixes (0.22% of the prefixes\
    \ were damped with a threshold of\n   12,000 in the experiments in [PELSSER2011],\
    \ yielding an average\n   hourly update reduction of 11% compared to not using\
    \ RFD).\n   +---------------+-------------+--------------+----------------------+\n\

- title: 5.  Maximum Penalty
  contents:
  - "5.  Maximum Penalty\n   It is important to understand that the parameters shown\
    \ in Table 1\n   and the implementation's sampling rate impose an upper bound\
    \ on the\n   penalty value, which we can call the 'computed maximum penalty'.\n\
    \   In addition, BGP implementations have an internal constant, which we\n   will\
    \ call the 'maximum penalty', and the current computed penalty may\n   not exceed\
    \ it.\n"
- title: 6.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6.  Recommendations\n   Use of the following values is recommended:\n   Router\
    \ Maximum Penalty:  The internal constant for the maximum\n      penalty value\
    \ MUST be raised to at least 50,000.\n   Default Configurable Parameters:  In\
    \ order not to break existing\n      operational configurations, existing BGP\
    \ implementations,\n      including the examples in Table 1, SHOULD NOT change\
    \ their default\n      values.\n   Minimum Suppress Threshold:  Operators that\
    \ want damping that is much\n      less destructive than the current damping,\
    \ but still somewhat\n      aggressive, SHOULD configure the Suppress Threshold\
    \ to no less\n      than 6,000.\n   Conservative Suppress Threshold:  Conservative\
    \ operators SHOULD\n      configure the Suppress Threshold to no less than 12,000.\n\
    \   Calculate But Do Not Damp:  Implementations MAY have a test mode\n      where\
    \ the operator can see the results of a particular\n      configuration without\
    \ actually damping any prefixes.  This will\n      allow for fine-tuning of parameters\
    \ without losing reachability.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   It is well known that an attacker can generate\
    \ false flapping to\n   cause a victim's prefix(es) to be damped.\n   As the recommendations\
    \ merely change parameters to more conservative\n   values, there should be no\
    \ increase in risk.  In fact, the parameter\n   change to more conservative values\
    \ should slightly mitigate the\n   false-flap attack.\n"
