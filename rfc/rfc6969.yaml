  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document modifies the \"Unassigned\" number space in the IANA\n\
    \   \"OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values\" registry by dividing it in\n\
    \   two halves -- one half Unassigned but managed via Standards Action,\n   and\
    \ the other Reserved for Private Use.  It updates RFC 5838.\n"

    \ Values\"\n   registry for the purpose of mapping OSPFv3 Instance IDs to different\n\
    \   address families.  The following table lists the value ranges that\n   were\
    \ allocated for [RFC5838] and Unassigned.\n   +---------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+\n\

    \   In some networks, additional OSPFv3 instances may be required to\n   operationally\
    \ identify specific applications.  This need requires a\n   pool of Instance IDs\
    \ that the operator may locally assign for that\n   purpose.\n   For example,\
    \ [OSPF-EMBED] describes an application in which IPv4-\n   embedded IPv6 addresses\
    \ [RFC6052] are used to transport IPv4 packets\n   over an IPv6 network.  While\
    \ the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses do in\n   fact represent IPv6 destinations,\
    \ it would be operationally\n   beneficial to be able to easily identify the specific\
    \ application by\n   having a separate space to do so.  This benefit is enabled\
    \ by the\n   allocation of a range of Private Use Instance IDs.\n   This document\
    \ modifies the IANA \"OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family\n   Values\" registry\
    \ by designating a range as Reserved for Private Use.\n   For the remaining unassigned\
    \ values, the registration procedure is\n   Standards Action.\n"
