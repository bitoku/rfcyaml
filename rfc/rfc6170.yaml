  - "1.  Introduction\n   This standard specifies how to bind a certificate image\
    \ to a\n   certificate (defined in [RFC5280]), providing a visual representation\n\
    \   of that certificate using the Logotype extension defined in [RFC3709]\n  \
    \ and specifying the certificate image as a new \"otherLogos\" type.\n   The purpose\
    \ of the certificate image is to aid human interpretation\n   of a certificate\
    \ by providing meaningful visual information to the\n   user interface (UI).\n\
    \   Typical situations when a human needs to examine the visual\n   representation\
    \ of a certificate are:\n   -  A person establishes a secured channel with an\
    \ authenticated\n      service.  The person needs to determine the identity of\
    \ the\n      service based on the authenticated credentials.\n   -  A person validates\
    \ the signature on critical information, such as\n      signed executable code,\
    \ and needs to determine the identity of the\n      signer based on the signer's\
    \ certificate.\n   -  A person is required to select an appropriate certificate\
    \ to be\n      used when authenticating to a service or Identity Management\n\
    \      infrastructure.  The person needs to see the available\n      certificates\
    \ in order to distinguish between them in the selection\n      process.\n   The\
    \ display of certificate information to humans is challenging due\n   to lack\
    \ of well-defined semantics for critical identity attributes.\n   Unless the application\
    \ has out-of-band knowledge about a particular\n   certificate, the application\
    \ will not know the exact nature of the\n   data stored in common identification\
    \ attributes such as serialNumber,\n   organizationName, country, etc.  Consequently,\
    \ the application can\n   display the actual data, but faces the problem of labeling\
    \ that data\n   in the UI and informing the human about the exact nature (semantics)\n\
    \   of that data.  It is also challenging for the application to\n   determine\
    \ which identification attributes are important to display\n   and how to organize\
    \ them in a logical order.\n   RFC 3709 [RFC3709] defines a certificate extension\
    \ for binding images\n   to a certificate, such as a community logo and issuer\
    \ logo, enhancing\n   the display of certificate information.  The syntax is extensible\
    \ and\n   allows inclusion of new image types using the otherLogos structure.\n\
    \   This standard defines how to include a complete certificate image\n   using\
    \ the extensibility mechanism of RFC 3709.\n"

  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Certificate Image
  contents:
  - "2.  Certificate Image\n   This section defines the certificate image as a new\
    \ otherLogos type\n   according to Section 4.1 of [RFC3709].\n   The certificate\
    \ image otherLogos type is identified by the Object\n   Identifier (OID) id-logo-certimage.\n\
    \      id-pkix  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=\n           { iso(1) identified-organization(3)\
    \ dod(6) internet(1)\n           security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }\n      id-logo\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 20 }\n      id-logo-certimage OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::= { id-logo 3 }\n   When present, the certificate image MUST be a complete\
    \ visual\n   representation of the certificate.  This means that the display of\n\
    \   this certificate image represents all information about the\n   certificate\
    \ that the issuer subjectively defines as relevant to show\n   to a typical human\
    \ user within the typical intended use of the\n   certificate, giving adequate\
    \ information about at least the following\n   three aspects of the certificate:\n\
    \   -  Certificate Context\n   -  Certificate Issuer\n   -  Certificate Subject\n\
    \   Certificate Context information is visual marks and/or textual\n   information\
    \ that helps the typical user to understand the typical\n   usage and/or purpose\
    \ of the certificate.\n   It is up to the issuer to decide what information --\
    \ in the form of\n   text, graphical symbols, and elements -- represents a complete\
    \ visual\n   representation of the certificate.  However, the visual\n   representation\
    \ of Certificate Subject and Certificate Issuer\n   information from the certificate\
    \ MUST have the same meaning as the\n   textual representation of that information\
    \ in the certificate itself.\n   Applications providing a Graphical User Interface\
    \ (GUI) to the\n   certificate user MAY present a certificate image according\
    \ to this\n   standard in any given application interface, as the only visual\n\
    \   representation of a certificate.\n"
- title: 3.  LogotypeImageInfo
  contents:
  - "3.  LogotypeImageInfo\n   The optional LogotypeImageInfo structure is defined\
    \ in [RFC3709] and\n   is included here for convenience:\n     LogotypeImageInfo\
    \ ::= SEQUENCE {\n        type          [0] LogotypeImageType DEFAULT color,\n\

    \ language      [4] IA5String OPTIONAL }  -- RFC 3066 Language Tag\n   NOTE: The\
    \ referenced RFC 3066 in the structure above (from RFC 3709)\n         is obsolete\
    \ and is currently replaced by RFC 5646 [RFC5646].\n         The language tag\
    \ may carry information about the language used\n         to express any textual\
    \ elements within the image as well as any\n         audio information associated\
    \ with the image.\n   When the optional LogotypeImageInfo is included with a certificate\n\
    \   image, the parameters shall be used with the following semantics and\n   restrictions.\n\
    \   xSize and ySize represent the recommended display size for the image.\n  \
    \ When a value of 0 (zero) is present, no recommended display size is\n   specified.\
    \  When non-zero values are present and these values differ\n   from corresponding\
    \ size values in the referenced image file, then the\n   referenced image SHOULD\
    \ be scaled to fit within the size parameters\n   of LogotypeImageInfo, while\
    \ keeping the x and y ratio intact.\n   The resolution parameter is redundant\
    \ for all image formats that are\n   relevant for certificate images and MUST\
    \ NOT be specified.\n"

    \ of mediaType in LogotypeDetails MUST be identical to the\n      media type value\
    \ in the \"data\" URL.\n   -  The hash of the image MUST be included in logotypeHash\
    \ and MUST be\n      calculated over the same data as it would have been, had\
    \ the image\n      been referenced through a link to an external resource.\n \
    \  NOTE: As the \"data\" URL scheme is processed as a data source rather\n   \
    \      than as a URL, the image data is typically not limited by any\n       \
    \  URL length limit settings that otherwise apply to URLs in\n         general.\n\
    \   NOTE: Implementations need to be cautious about the size of images\n     \
    \    included in a certificate in order to ensure that the size of\n         the\
    \ certificate does not prevent the certificate from being\n         used as intended.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document is based on and inherits all security\
    \ considerations\n   from RFC 3709 [RFC3709].  In particular, RFC 3709 discusses\
    \ several\n   issues a Certificate Authority (CA) should take into consideration\n\
    \   when evaluating a request to issue a certificate with a certificate\n   image.\n\
    \   Images incorporated according to RFC 3709 provide an additional\n   possibility\
    \ for a CA with bad intentions or bad security procedures\n   to include false,\
    \ conflicting, or malicious information to relying\n   parties.  Such a CA may,\
    \ for example:\n   -  include information in graphical form that is in conflict\
    \ with\n      information in provided text-based attributes or other name forms,\n\
    \      and\n   -  include malicious data that could exploit known security bugs\
    \ in\n      common software libraries used to render graphical images.\n   This\
    \ underlines the necessity for CAs to provide reliable services,\n   and the relying\
    \ party's responsibility and need to carefully select\n   which CAs are trusted\
    \ to provide public key certificates.\n   This also underlines the general necessity\
    \ for relying parties to use\n   up-to-date software libraries to render or dereference\
    \ data from\n   external sources (such as certificates), to minimize risks related\
    \ to\n   processing potentially malicious data before the data has been\n   adequately\
    \ verified and validated.\n   Referenced image files are hashed in order to bind\
    \ the image to the\n   signature of the certificate.  Some image types, such as\
    \ SVG, allow\n   part of the image to be collected from an external source by\n\
    \   incorporating a reference to an external image file.  If this feature\n  \
    \ were used within a certificate image file, the hash of the image file\n   would\
    \ only cover the URI reference to the external image file, but\n   not the referenced\
    \ image data.  Clients SHOULD verify that SVGT\n   images meet all requirements\
    \ listed in Section 5.2 and reject images\n   that contain references to external\
    \ data.\n   CAs issuing certificates with embedded certificate images should be\n\
    \   cautious when accepting graphics from the certificate requestor for\n   inclusion\
    \ in the certificate if the hash algorithm used to sign the\n   certificate is\
    \ vulnerable to collision attacks.  In such a case, the\n   accepted image may\
    \ contain data that could help an attacker to obtain\n   colliding certificates\
    \ with identical certificate signatures.\n   Certificates, and hence their certificate\
    \ images, are commonly public\n   objects and as such usually will not contain\
    \ privacy-sensitive\n   information.  However, when a certificate image that is\
    \ referenced\n   from a certificate contains privacy-sensitive information,\n\
    \   appropriate security controls should be in place to protect the\n   privacy\
    \ of that information.  Details of such controls are outside\n   the scope of\
    \ this document.\n"
