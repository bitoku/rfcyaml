- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 [RFC5340]\
    \ that is\n   adapted to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [RFC2501] and based on\n\
    \   mechanisms providing:\n   Flooding-reduction:  only a subset of all routers\
    \ will be involved in\n      (re)transmissions during a flooding operation.\n\
    \   Topology-reduction:  only a subset of links are advertised, hence\n      both\
    \ the number and the size of Link State Advertisements (LSAs)\n      are decreased.\n\
    \   Adjacency-reduction:  adjacencies are brought up only with a subset\n    \
    \  of neighbors for lower database synchronization overhead.\n   These mechanisms\
    \ are based on multipoint relays (MPR), a technique\n   developed in the Optimized\
    \ Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)\n   [RFC3626].\n   The extension specified\
    \ in this document integrates into the OSPF\n   framework by defining the OSPFv3\
    \ MANET interface type.  While this\n   extension enables OSPFv3 to function efficiently\
    \ on mobile ad hoc\n   networks, operation of OSPFv3 on other types of interfaces\
    \ or\n   networks, or in areas without OSPFv3 MANET interfaces, remains\n   unaltered.\n"

- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   The OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined in this\
    \ specification,\n   allows OSPFv3 to be deployed within an area where parts of\
    \ that area\n   are a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with moderate mobility\n \
    \  properties.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MANET Characteristics
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MANET Characteristics\n   MANETs [RFC2501] are networks in which a dynamic\
    \ network topology is\n   a frequently expected condition, often due to router\
    \ mobility and/or\n   to varying quality of wireless links -- the latter of which\
    \ also\n   generally entails bandwidth scarcity and interference issues between\n\
    \   neighbors.\n   Moreover, MANETs often exhibit \"semi-broadcast\" properties,\
    \ i.e., a\n   router R that makes a transmission within a MANET can only assume\n\
    \   that transmission to be received by a subset of the total number of\n   routers\
    \ within that MANET.  Further, if two routers, R1 and R2, each\n   make a transmission,\
    \ neither of these transmissions is guaranteed to\n   be received by the same\
    \ subset of routers within the MANET -- even if\n   R1 and R2 can mutually receive\
    \ transmissions from each other.\n   These characteristics are incompatible with\
    \ several OSPFv3\n   mechanisms, including, but not limited to, existing mechanisms\
    \ for\n   control-traffic reduction, such as flooding-reduction, topology-\n \
    \  reduction, and adjacency-reduction (e.g., Designated Router).\n"
- title: 3.2.  OSPFv3 MANET Interface Characteristics
  contents:
  - "3.2.  OSPFv3 MANET Interface Characteristics\n   An interface of the OSPFv3 MANET\
    \ interface type is the point of\n   attachment of an OSPFv3 router to a network\
    \ that may have MANET\n   characteristics.  That is, an interface of the OSPFv3\
    \ MANET interface\n   type is able to accommodate the MANET characteristics described\
    \ in\n   Section 3.1.  An OSPFv3 MANET interface type is not prescribing a set\n\
    \   of behaviors or expectations that the network is required to satisfy.\n  \
    \ Rather, it is describing operating conditions under which protocols\n   on an\
    \ interface towards that network must be able to function (i.e.,\n   the protocols\
    \ are required to be able to operate correctly when faced\n   with the characteristics\
    \ described in Section 3.1).  As such, the\n   OSPFv3 MANET interface type is\
    \ a generalization of other OSPFv3\n   interface types; for example, a protocol\
    \ operating correctly over an\n   OSPFv3 MANET interface would also operate correctly\
    \ over an OSPFv3\n   broadcast interface (whereas the inverse would not necessarily\
    \ be\n   true).\n   Efficient OSPFv3 operation over MANETs relies on control-traffic\n\
    \   reduction and on using mechanisms appropriate for semi-broadcast.\n   The\
    \ OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined in this document, allows\n   networks with\
    \ MANET characteristics into the OSPFv3 framework by\n   integrating mechanisms\
    \ (flooding-reduction, topology-reduction, and\n   adjacency-reduction) derived\
    \ from solutions standardized by the MANET\n   working group.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning\n   The OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined\
    \ in this specification, makes\n   use of flooding-reduction, topology-reduction,\
    \ and adjacency-\n   reduction, all based on MPR, a technique derived from [RFC3626],\
    \ as\n   standardized in the MANET working group.  Multicast transmissions of\n\
    \   protocol packets are used when possible.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Efficient Flooding Using MPRs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Efficient Flooding Using MPRs\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces use a flooding-reduction\
    \ mechanism, denoted\n   MPR flooding [MPR], whereby only a subset of MANET neighbors\
    \ (those\n   selected as Flooding-MPR) participate in a flooding operation.  This\n\
    \   reduces the number of (re)transmissions necessary for a flooding\n   operation\
    \ [MPR-analysis], while retaining resilience against\n   transmission errors (inherent\
    \ when using wireless links) and against\n   obsolete two-hop neighbor information\
    \ (e.g., as caused by router\n   mobility) [MPR-robustness].\n"
- title: 4.2.  MPR Topology-Reduction
  contents:
  - "4.2.  MPR Topology-Reduction\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces use a topology-reduction\
    \ mechanism, denoted\n   MPR topology-reduction, whereby only necessary links\
    \ to MANET\n   neighbors (those identified by Path-MPR selection as belonging\
    \ to\n   shortest paths) are included in LSAs.  Routers in a MANET\n   periodically\
    \ generate and flood Router-LSAs describing their\n   selection of such links\
    \ to their Path-MPRs.  Such links are reported\n   as point-to-point links.  This\
    \ reduces the size of LSAs originated by\n   routers on a MANET [MPR-topology],\
    \ while retaining classic OSPF\n   properties: optimal paths using synchronized\
    \ adjacencies (if\n   synchronized paths are preferred over non-synchronized paths\
    \ of equal\n   cost).\n"
- title: 4.3.  Multicast Transmissions of Protocol Packets
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Multicast Transmissions of Protocol Packets\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces\
    \ employ multicast transmissions when possible,\n   thereby taking advantage of\
    \ inherent broadcast capabilities of the\n   medium, if present (with wireless\
    \ interfaces, this can often be the\n   case [RFC2501]).  In particular, LSA acknowledgments\
    \ are sent via\n   multicast over these interfaces, and retransmissions over the\
    \ same\n   interfaces are considered as implicit acknowledgments.  Jitter\n  \
    \ management, such as delaying packet (re)transmission, can be employed\n   in\
    \ order to allow several packets to be bundled into a single\n   transmission,\
    \ which may avoid superfluous retransmissions due to\n   packet collisions [RFC5148].\n"
- title: 4.4.  MPR Adjacency-Reduction
  contents:
  - "4.4.  MPR Adjacency-Reduction\n   Adjacencies over OSPFv3 MANET interfaces are\
    \ required to be formed\n   only with a subset of the neighbors of that OSPFv3\
    \ MANET interface.\n   No Designated Router or Backup Designated Router are elected\
    \ on an\n   OSPFv3 MANET interface.  Rather, adjacencies are brought up over an\n\
    \   OSPFv3 MANET interface only with MPRs and MPR selectors.  Only a\n   small\
    \ subset of routers in the MANET (called Synch routers) are\n   required to bring\
    \ up adjacencies with all their MANET neighbors.\n   This reduces the amount of\
    \ control traffic needed for database\n   synchronization, while ensuring that\
    \ LSAs still describe only\n   synchronized adjacencies.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC4593] describes generic threats to routing\
    \ protocols, whose\n   applicability to OSPFv3 [RFC5340] is not altered by the\
    \ presence of\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces.  As such, the OSPFv3 MANET interface\
    \ type\n   does not introduce new security threats to [RFC5340].\n   However,\
    \ the use of a wireless medium and the lack of infrastructure,\n   as enabled\
    \ by the use of the OSPFv3 MANET interface type, may render\n   some of the attacks\
    \ described in [RFC4593] easier to undertake.\n   For example, control-traffic\
    \ sniffing and control-traffic analysis\n   are simpler tasks with wireless than\
    \ with wires, as it is sufficient\n   to be somewhere within radio range in order\
    \ to \"listen\" to wireless\n   traffic.  Inconspicuous wiretapping of the right\
    \ cable(s) is not\n   necessary.\n   In a similar fashion, physical signal interference\
    \ is also a simpler\n   task with wireless than with wires, as it is sufficient\
    \ to emit from\n   somewhere within radio range in order to be able to disrupt\
    \ the\n   communication medium.  No complex wire connection is required.\n   Other\
    \ types of interference (including not forwarding packets),\n   spoofing, and\
    \ different types of falsification or overloading (as\n   described in [RFC4593])\
    \ are also threats to which routers using\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces may be subject.\
    \  In these cases, the lack of\n   predetermined infrastructure or authority,\
    \ enabled by the use of\n   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces, may facilitate such attacks\
    \ by making it\n   easier to forge legitimacy.\n   Moreover, the consequence zone\
    \ of a given threat, and its consequence\n   period (as defined in [RFC4593]),\
    \ may also be slightly altered over\n   the wireless medium, compared to the same\
    \ threat over wired networks.\n   Indeed, mobility and the fact that radio range\
    \ spans \"further\" than a\n   mere cable may expand the consequence zone in some\
    \ cases; meanwhile,\n   the more dynamic nature of MANET topologies may decrease\
    \ the\n   consequence period, as harmful information (or lack of information)\n\
    \   will tend to be replaced quicker by legitimate information.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Flooding-MPR Selection Heuristic
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Flooding-MPR Selection Heuristic\n   The following specifies a proposed\
    \ heuristic for selection of\n   Flooding-MPRs on interface i.  It constructs\
    \ a Flooding-MPR set that\n   enables a router to reach routers in the 2-hop neighborhood\
    \ through\n   relaying by one Flooding-MPR router.\n   The following terminology\
    \ will be used in describing the heuristics:\n   D(Y) is the degree of a 1-hop\
    \ neighbor, router Y (where Y is a member\n   of N(i), defined as the number of\
    \ neighbors of router Y, EXCLUDING\n   all the members of N(i) and EXCLUDING the\
    \ router performing the\n   computation.  The proposed heuristic can then be described\
    \ as\n   follows.  Begin with an empty Flooding-MPR set.  Then:\n   1.  Calculate\
    \ D(Y), where Y is a member of N(i), for all routers in\n       N(i).\n   2. \
    \ Add to the Flooding-MPR set those routers in N(i) that are the\n       only\
    \ routers to provide reachability to a router in N2(i).  For\n       example,\
    \ if router B in N2(i) can be reached only through a\n       router A in N(i),\
    \ then add router A to the Flooding-MPR set.\n       Remove the routers from N2(i)\
    \ that are now covered by a router in\n       the Flooding-MPR set.\n   3.  While\
    \ there exist routers in N2(i) that are not covered by at\n       least one router\
    \ in the Flooding-MPR set:\n       1.  For each router in N(i), calculate the\
    \ reachability, i.e.,\n           the number of routers in N2(i) that are not\
    \ yet covered by at\n           least one router in the Flooding-MPR set, and\
    \ that are\n           reachable through this 1-hop neighbor;\n       2.  Select\
    \ as a Flooding-MPR the neighbor with the highest\n           willingness among\
    \ the routers in N(i) with non-zero\n           reachability.  In case of a tie\
    \ among routers with the same\n           willingness, select the router that\
    \ provides reachability to\n           the maximum number of routers in N2(i).\
    \  In case of another\n           tie between routers also providing the same\
    \ amount of\n           reachability, select as Flooding-MPR the router whose\
    \ D(Y) is\n           greater.  Remove the routers from N2(i) that are now covered\n\
    \           by a router in the Flooding-MPR set.\n   4.  As an optimization, consider\
    \ in increasing order of willingness\n       each router Y in the Flooding-MPR\
    \ set: if all routers in N2(i)\n       are still covered by at least one router\
    \ in the Flooding-MPR set\n       when excluding router Y, then router Y MAY be\
    \ removed from the\n       Flooding-MPR set.\n   Other algorithms, as well as\
    \ improvements over this algorithm, are\n   possible.  Different routers may use\
    \ different algorithms\n   independently.  However, the algorithm used MUST provide\
    \ the router\n   with a Flooding-MPR set that fulfills the flooding coverage\n\
    \   criterion, i.e., it MUST select a Flooding-MPR set such that any\n   2-hop\
    \ neighbor is covered by at least one Flooding-MPR router.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Path-MPR Selection Heuristic
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Path-MPR Selection Heuristic\n   The following specifies a proposed\
    \ heuristic for calculating a Path-\n   MPR set that enables a router to reach\
    \ routers in the 2-hop\n   neighborhood through shortest paths via routers in\
    \ its Path-MPR set.\n   The following terminology will be used for describing\
    \ this heuristic:\n   A -  The router performing the Path-MPR set calculation.\n\
    \   B, C, D, .... -  Other routers in the network.\n   cost(A,B) -  The cost of\
    \ the path through the direct link, from A to\n      B.\n   dist(C,A) -  The cost\
    \ of the shortest path from C to A.\n   A cost matrix is populated with the values\
    \ of the costs of links\n   originating from router A (available locally) and\
    \ with values listed\n   in Hello packets received from neighbor routers.  More\
    \ precisely, the\n   cost matrix is populated as follows:\n   1.  The coefficients\
    \ of the cost matrix are set by default to 0xFFFF\n       (maximal value, i.e.,\
    \ infinity).\n   2.  The coefficient cost(A,B) of the cost matrix for a link from\n\
    \       router A to a neighbor B (the direct cost for this link) is set\n    \
    \   to the minimum cost over all interfaces that feature router B as\n       a\
    \ symmetric 1-hop neighbor.  The reverse cost for this link,\n       cost(B,A),\
    \ is set at the value received in Hello packets from\n       router B.  If router\
    \ B is reachable through several interfaces at\n       the same time, cost(B,A)\
    \ is set as the minimum cost advertised by\n       router B for its links towards\
    \ router A.\n   3.  The coefficients of the cost matrix concerning the link between\n\
    \       two neighbors of A, routers C and B, are populated at the\n       reception\
    \ of their Hello packets.  The cost(B,C) is set to the\n       value advertised\
    \ by the Hello packets from B, and, respectively,\n       the cost(C,B) is set\
    \ to the value advertised in Hello packets\n       from C.\n   4.  The coefficients\
    \ cost(B,C) of the cost matrix for a link that\n       connects a neighbor B to\
    \ a 2-hop neighbor C are obtained via the\n       Hello packets received from\
    \ router B.  In this case, cost(B,C)\n       and cost(C,B) are respectively set\
    \ to the values advertised by\n       router B for the direct cost and reverse\
    \ cost for node C.\n   Once the cost matrix is populated, the proposed heuristic\
    \ can then be\n   described as follows.  Begin with an empty Path-MPR set.  Then:\n\
    \   1.  Using the cost matrix and the Dijkstra algorithm, compute the\n      \
    \ router distance vector, i.e., the shortest distance for each pair\n       (X,A)\
    \ where X is in N or N2 minimizing the sum of the cost of the\n       path between\
    \ X and A.\n   2.  Compute N' as the subset of N made of the elements X such that\n\
    \       cost(X,A)=dist(X,A).\n   3.  Compute N2' as the subset of N and N2 made\
    \ of the elements Y that\n       do not belong to N' and such that there exist\
    \ X in N' such\n       cost(Y,X)+cost(X,A)=dist(Y,A).\n   4.  Compute the MPR\
    \ selection algorithm presented in Appendix A with\n       N' instead of N(i)\
    \ and N2' instead of N2(i).  The resulting MPR\n       set is the Path-MPR set.\n\
    \   Other algorithms, as well as improvements over this algorithm, are\n   possible.\
    \  Different routers may use different algorithms\n   independently.  However,\
    \ the algorithm used MUST provide the router\n   with a Path-MPR set that fulfills\
    \ the path coverage criterion, i.e.,\n   it MUST select a Path-MPR set such that\
    \ for any element of N or N2\n   that is not in the Path-MPR set, there exists\
    \ a shortest path that\n   goes from this element to the router through a neighbor\
    \ selected as\n   Path-MPR (unless the shortest path is only one hop).\n"
