    \ Address\n   Autoconfiguration provide ways to configure either fixed or mobile\n\
    \   nodes with one or more IPv6 addresses, default routes, and some other\n  \
    \ parameters [1][2].  To support the access to additional services in\n   the\

- title: 3.  IPv6 DNS Configuration Approaches
  contents:
  - "3.  IPv6 DNS Configuration Approaches\n   In this section, the operational attributes\
    \ of the three solutions\n   are described in detail.\n"
- title: 3.1.  RA Option
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RA Option\n   The RA approach defines a new ND option, called the RDNSS\
    \ option,\n   that contains a recursive DNS server address [6].  Existing ND\n\
    \   transport mechanisms (i.e., advertisements and solicitations) are\n   used.\
    \  This works in the same way that nodes learn about routers and\n   prefixes.\
    \  An IPv6 host can configure the IPv6 addresses of one or\n   more RDNSSes via\
    \ RA message periodically sent by a router or\n   solicited by a Router Solicitation\
    \ (RS).\n   This approach needs RDNSS information to be configured in the routers\n\
    \   doing the advertisements.  The configuration of RDNSS addresses can\n   be\
    \ performed manually by an operator or in other ways, such as\n   automatic configuration\
    \ through a DHCPv6 client running on the\n   router.  An RA message with one RDNSS\
    \ option can include as many\n   RDNSS addresses as needed [6].\n   Through the\
    \ ND protocol and RDNSS option, along with a prefix\n   information option, an\
    \ IPv6 host can perform network configuration of\n   its IPv6 address and RDNSS\
    \ simultaneously [1][2].  The RA option for\n   RDNSS can be used on any network\
    \ that supports the use of ND.\n   The RA approach is useful in some mobile environments\
    \ where the\n   addresses of the RDNSSes are changing because the RA option includes\n\
    \   a lifetime field that allows client to use RDNSSes nearer to the\n   client.\
    \  This can be configured to a value that will require the\n   client to time\
    \ out the entry and switch over to another RDNSS address\n   [6].  However, from\
    \ the viewpoint of implementation, the lifetime\n   field would seem to make matters\
    \ a bit more complex.  Instead of just\n   writing to a DNS configuration file,\
    \ such as resolv.conf for the list\n   of RDNSS addresses, we have to have a daemon\
    \ around (or a program\n   that is called at the defined intervals) that keeps\
    \ monitoring the\n   lifetime of RDNSSes all the time.\n   The preference value\
    \ of RDNSS, included in the RDNSS option, allows\n   IPv6 hosts to select primary\
    \ RDNSS among several RDNSSes [6]; this\n   can be used for the load balancing\
    \ of RDNSSes.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Advantages
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Advantages\n   The RA option for RDNSS has a number of advantages.  These\
    \ include:\n   1.  The RA option is an extension of existing ND/Autoconfig\n \
    \      mechanisms [1][2] and does not require a change in the base ND\n      \
    \ protocol.\n   2.  This approach, like ND, works well on a variety of link types,\n\
    \       including point-to-point links, point-to-multipoint, and\n       multipoint-to-multipoint\
    \ (i.e., Ethernet LANs).  RFC 2461 [1]\n       states, however, that there may\
    \ be some link types on which ND is\n       not feasible; on such links, some\
    \ other mechanisms will be needed\n       for DNS configuration.\n   3.  All the\
    \ information a host needs to run the basic Internet\n       applications (such\
    \ as the email, web, ftp, etc.) can be obtained\n       with the addition of this\
    \ option to ND and address\n       autoconfiguration.  The use of a single mechanism\
    \ is more\n       reliable and easier to provide than when the RDNSS information\
    \ is\n       learned via another protocol mechanism.  Debugging problems when\n\
    \       multiple protocol mechanisms are being used is harder and much\n     \
    \  more complex.\n   4.  This mechanism works over a broad range of scenarios\
    \ and\n       leverages IPv6 ND.  This works well on links that are high\n   \
    \    performance (e.g., Ethernet LANs) and low performance (e.g.,\n       cellular\
    \ networks).  In the latter case, by combining the RDNSS\n       information with\
    \ the other information in the RA, the host can\n       learn all the information\
    \ needed to use most Internet\n       applications, such as the web, in a single\
    \ packet.  This not only\n       saves bandwidth, but also minimizes the delay\
    \ needed to learn the\n       RDNSS information.\n   5.  The RA approach could\
    \ be used as a model for similar types of\n       configuration information. \
    \ New RA options for other server\n       addresses, such as NTP server address,\
    \ that are common to all\n       clients on a subnet would be easy to define.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Disadvantages
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Disadvantages\n   1.  ND is mostly implemented in the kernel of the operating\
    \ system.\n       Therefore, if ND supports the configuration of some additional\n\
    \       services, such as DNS servers, ND should be extended in the\n       kernel\
    \ and complemented by a user-land process.  DHCPv6, however,\n       has more\
    \ flexibility for the extension of service discovery\n       because it is an\
    \ application layer protocol.\n   2.  The current ND framework should be modified\
    \ to facilitate the\n       synchronization between another ND cache for RDNSSes\
    \ in the\n       kernel space and the DNS configuration file in the user space.\n\
    \       Because it is unacceptable to write and rewrite to the DNS\n       configuration\
    \ file (e.g., resolv.conf) from the kernel, another\n       approach is needed.\
    \  One simple approach to solve this is to have\n       a daemon listening to\
    \ what the kernel conveys, and to have the\n       daemon do these steps, but\
    \ such a daemon is not needed with the\n       current ND framework.\n   3.  It\
    \ is necessary to configure RDNSS addresses at least at one\n       router on\
    \ every link where this information needs to be\n       configured via the RA\
    \ option.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Observations
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Observations\n   The proposed RDNSS RA option, along with the IPv6 ND\
    \ and\n   Autoconfiguration, allows a host to obtain all of the information it\n\
    \   needs to access basic Internet services like the web, email, ftp,\n   etc.\
    \  This is preferable in the environments where hosts use RAs to\n   autoconfigure\
    \ their addresses and all the hosts on the subnet share\n   the same router and\
    \ server addresses.  If the configuration\n   information can be obtained from\
    \ a single mechanism, it is preferable\n   because it does not add additional\
    \ delay, and because it uses a\n   minimum of bandwidth.  Environments like this\
    \ include homes, public\n   cellular networks, and enterprise environments where\
    \ no per host\n   configuration is needed.\n   DHCPv6 is preferable where it is\
    \ being used for address configuration\n   and if there is a need for host specific\
    \ configuration [3]-[5].\n   Environments like this are most likely to be the\
    \ enterprise\n   environments where the local administration chooses to have per\
    \ host\n   configuration control.\n"
- title: 3.2.  DHCPv6 Option
  contents:
  - "3.2.  DHCPv6 Option\n   DHCPv6 [3] includes the \"DNS Recursive Name Server\"\
    \ option, through\n   which a host can obtain a list of IP addresses of recursive\
    \ DNS\n   servers [5].  The DNS Recursive Name Server option carries a list of\n\
    \   IPv6 addresses of RDNSSes to which the host may send DNS queries.\n   The\
    \ DNS servers are listed in the order of preference for use by the\n   DNS resolver\
    \ on the host.\n   The DNS Recursive Name Server option can be carried in any\
    \ DHCPv6\n   Reply message, in response to either a Request or an Information\n\
    \   request message.  Thus, the DNS Recursive Name Server option can be\n   used\
    \ either when DHCPv6 is used for address assignment, or when\n   DHCPv6 is used\
    \ only for other configuration information as stateless\n   DHCPv6 [4].\n   Stateless\
    \ DHCPv6 can be deployed either by using DHCPv6 servers\n   running on general-purpose\
    \ computers, or on router hardware.  Several\n   router vendors currently implement\
    \ stateless DHCPv6 servers.\n   Deploying stateless DHCPv6 in routers has the\
    \ advantage that no\n   special hardware is required, and it should work well\
    \ for networks\n   where DHCPv6 is needed for very straightforward configuration\
    \ of\n   network devices.\n   However, routers can also act as DHCPv6 relay agents.\
    \  In this case,\n   the DHCPv6 server need not be on the router; it can be on\
    \ a general\n   purpose computer.  This has the potential to give the operator\
    \ of the\n   DHCPv6 server more flexibility in how the DHCPv6 server responds\
    \ to\n   individual clients that can easily be given different configuration\n\
    \   information based on their identity, or for any other reason.\n   Nothing\
    \ precludes adding this flexibility to a router, but generally,\n   in current\
    \ practice, DHCP servers running on general-purpose hosts\n   tend to have more\
    \ configuration options than those that are embedded\n   in routers.\n   DHCPv6\
    \ currently provides a mechanism for reconfiguring DHCPv6\n   clients that use\
    \ a stateful configuration assignment.  To do this,\n   the DHCPv6 server sends\
    \ a Reconfigure message to the client.  The\n   client validates the Reconfigure\
    \ message, and then contacts the\n   DHCPv6 server to obtain updated configuration\
    \ information.  By using\n   this mechanism, it is currently possible to propagate\
    \ new\n   configuration information to DHCPv6 clients as this information\n  \
    \ changes.\n   The DHC Working Group has standardized an additional mechanism\n\
    \   through which configuration information, including the list of\n   RDNSSes,\
    \ can be updated.  The lifetime option for DHCPv6 [8] assigns\n   a lifetime to\
    \ configuration information obtained through DHCPv6.  At\n   the expiration of\
    \ the lifetime, the host contacts the DHCPv6 server\n   to obtain updated configuration\
    \ information, including the list of\n   RDNSSes.  This lifetime gives the network\
    \ administrator another\n   mechanism to configure hosts with new RDNSSes by controlling\
    \ the time\n   at which the host refreshes the list.\n   The DHC Working Group\
    \ has also discussed the possibility of defining\n   an extension to DHCPv6 that\
    \ would allow the use of multicast to\n   provide configuration information to\
    \ multiple hosts with a single\n   DHCPv6 message.  Because of the lack of deployment\
    \ experience, the WG\n   has deferred consideration of multicast DHCPv6 configuration\
    \ at this\n   time.  Experience with DHCPv4 has not identified a requirement for\n\
    \   multicast message delivery, even in large service provider networks\n   with\
    \ tens of thousands of hosts that may initiate a DHCPv4 message\n   exchange simultaneously.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Advantages
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Advantages\n   The DHCPv6 option for RDNSS has a number of advantages.\
    \  These\n   include:\n   1.  DHCPv6 currently provides a general mechanism for\
    \ conveying\n       network configuration information to clients.  Configuring\
    \ DHCPv6\n       servers in this way allows the network administrator to configure\n\
    \       RDNSSes, the addresses of other network services, and location-\n    \
    \   specific information, such as time zones.\n   2.  As a consequence, when the\
    \ network administrator goes to\n       configure DHCPv6, all the configuration\
    \ information can be\n       managed through a single service, typically with\
    \ a single user\n       interface and a single configuration database.\n   3.\
    \  DHCPv6 allows for the configuration of a host with information\n       specific\
    \ to that host, so that hosts on the same link can be\n       configured with\
    \ different RDNSSes and with other configuration\n       information.\n   4. \
    \ A mechanism exists for extending DHCPv6 to support the\n       transmission\
    \ of additional configuration that has not yet been\n       anticipated.\n   5.\
    \  Hosts that require other configuration information, such as the\n       addresses\
    \ of SIP servers and NTP servers, are likely to need\n       DHCPv6 for other\
    \ configuration information.\n   6.  The specification for configuration of RDNSSes\
    \ through DHCPv6 is\n       available as an RFC.  No new protocol extensions (such\
    \ as new\n       options) are necessary.\n   7.  Interoperability among independent\
    \ implementations has been\n       demonstrated.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Disadvantages
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Disadvantages\n   The DHCPv6 option for RDNSS has a few disadvantages.\
    \  These include:\n   1.  Update currently requires a message from server (however,\
    \ see\n       [8]).\n   2.  Because DNS information is not contained in RA messages,\
    \ the host\n       must receive two messages from the router and must transmit\
    \ at\n       least one message to the router.  On networks where bandwidth is\n\
    \       at a premium, this is a disadvantage, although on most networks\n    \
    \   it is not a practical concern.\n   3.  There is an increased latency for initial\
    \ configuration.  In\n       addition to waiting for an RA message, the client\
    \ must now\n       exchange packets with a DHCPv6 server.  Even if it is locally\n\
    \       installed on a router, this will slightly extend the time\n       required\
    \ to configure the client.  For clients that are moving\n       rapidly from one\
    \ network to another, this will be a disadvantage.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Observations
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Observations\n   In the general case, on general-purpose networks, stateless\
    \ DHCPv6\n   provides significant advantages and no significant disadvantages.\n\
    \   Even in the case where bandwidth is at a premium and low latency is\n   desired,\
    \ if hosts require other configuration information in addition\n   to a list of\
    \ RDNSSes or if hosts must be configured selectively,\n   those hosts will use\
    \ DHCPv6 and the use of the DHCPv6 DNS recursive\n   name server option will be\
    \ advantageous.\n   However, we are aware of some applications where it would\
    \ be\n   preferable to put the RDNSS information into an RA packet; for\n   example,\
    \ in a mobile phone network, where bandwidth is at a premium\n   and extremely\
    \ low latency is desired.  The DNS configuration based on\n   RA should be standardized\
    \ so as to allow these special applications\n   to be handled using DNS information\
    \ in the RA packet.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Well-known Anycast Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Well-known Anycast Addresses\n   Anycast uses the same routing system as\
    \ unicast [9].  However,\n   administrative entities are local ones.  The local\
    \ entities may\n   accept unicast routes (including default routes) to anycast\
    \ servers\n   from adjacent entities.  The administrative entities should not\n\
    \   advertise their peer routes to their internal anycast servers, if\n   they\
    \ want to prohibit external access from some peers to the servers.\n   If some\
    \ advertisement is inevitable (such as the case with default\n   routes), the\
    \ packets to the servers should be blocked at the boundary\n   of the entities.\
    \  Thus, for this anycast, not only unicast routing\n   but also unicast ND protocols\
    \ can be used as is.\n   First of all, the well-known anycast addresses approach\
    \ is much\n   different from that discussed by the IPv6 Working Group in the past\n\
    \   [7].  Note that \"anycast\" in this memo is simpler than that of RFC\n   1546\
    \ [9] and RFC 3513 [10], where it is assumed to be prohibited to\n   have multiple\
    \ servers on a single link sharing an anycast address.\n   That is, on a link,\
    \ an anycast address is assumed to be unique.  DNS\n   clients today already have\
    \ redundancy by having multiple well-known\n   anycast addresses configured as\
    \ RDNSS addresses.  There is no point\n   in having multiple RDNSSes sharing an\
    \ anycast address on a single\n   link.\n   The approach with well-known anycast\
    \ addresses is to set multiple\n   well-known anycast addresses in clients' resolver\
    \ configuration files\n   from the beginning as, say, factory default.  Thus,\
    \ there is no\n   transport mechanism and no packet format [7].\n   An anycast\
    \ address is an address shared by multiple servers (in this\n   case, the servers\
    \ are RDNSSes).  A request from a client to the\n   anycast address is routed\
    \ to a server selected by the routing system.\n   However, it is a bad idea to\
    \ mandate \"site\" boundary on anycast\n   addresses, because most users do not\
    \ have their own servers and want\n   to access their ISPs across their site boundaries.\
    \  Larger sites may\n   also depend on their ISPs or may have their own RDNSSes\

  - "3.3.1.  Advantages\n   The basic advantage of the well-known addresses approach\
    \ is that it\n   uses no transport mechanism.  Thus, the following apply:\n  \
    \ 1.  There is no delay to get the response and no further delay by\n       packet\
    \ losses.\n   2.  The approach can be combined with any other configuration\n\
    \       mechanisms, such as the RA-based approach and DHCP-based\n       approach,\
    \ as well as the factory default configuration.\n   3.  The approach works over\
    \ any environment where DNS works.\n   Another advantage is that this approach\
    \ only needs configuration of\n   the DNS servers as a router (or configuration\
    \ of a proxy router).\n   Considering that DNS servers do need configuration,\
    \ the amount of\n   overall configuration effort is proportional to the number\
    \ of DNS\n   servers and it scales linearly.  Note that, in the simplest case,\n\
    \   where a subscriber to an ISP does not have a DNS server, the\n   subscriber\
    \ naturally accesses DNS servers of the ISP, even though the\n   subscriber and\
    \ the ISP do nothing and there is no protocol to\n   exchange DNS server information\
    \ between the subscriber and the ISP.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  Disadvantages
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  Disadvantages\n   The well-known anycast addresses approach requires\
    \ that DNS servers\n   (or routers near to them as a proxy) act as routers to\
    \ advertise\n   their anycast addresses to the routing system, which requires\
    \ some\n   configuration (see the last paragraph of the previous section on the\n\
    \   scalability of the effort).  In addition, routers at the boundary of\n   the\
    \ \"site\" might need the configuration of route filters to prevent\n   providing\
    \ DNS services for parties outside the \"site\" and the\n   possibility of denial\
    \ of service attacks on the internal DNS\n   infrastructure.\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  Observations
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  Observations\n   If other approaches are used in addition, the well-known\
    \ anycast\n   addresses should also be set in RA or DHCP configuration files to\n\
    \   reduce the configuration effort of users.\n   The redundancy by multiple RDNSSes\
    \ is better provided by multiple\n   servers with different anycast addresses\
    \ than by multiple servers\n   sharing the same anycast address, because the former\
    \ approach allows\n   stale servers to generate routes to their anycast addresses.\
    \  Thus,\n   in a routing domain (or domains sharing DNS servers), there will\
    \ be\n   only one server with an anycast address unless the domain is so large\n\
    \   that load distribution is necessary.\n   Small ISPs will operate one RDNSS\
    \ at each anycast address that is\n   shared by all the subscribers.  Large ISPs\
    \ may operate multiple\n   RDNSSes at each anycast address to distribute and reduce\
    \ load, where\n   the boundary between RDNSSes may be fixed (redundancy is still\n\
    \   provided by multiple addresses) or change dynamically.  DNS packets\n   with\
    \ the well-known anycast addresses are not expected (though not\n   prohibited)\
    \ to cross ISP boundaries, as ISPs are expected to be able\n   to take care of\
    \ themselves.\n   Because \"anycast\" in this memo is simpler than that of RFC\
    \ 1546 [9]\n   and RFC 3513 [10], where it is assumed to be administratively\n\
    \   prohibited to have multiple servers on a single link sharing an\n   anycast\
    \ address, anycast in this memo should be implemented as\n   UNICAST of RFC 2461\
    \ [1] and RFC 3513 [10].  As a result, ND-related\n   instability disappears.\
    \  Thus, in the well-known anycast addresses\n   approach, anycast can and should\
    \ use the anycast address as a source\n   unicast (according to RFC 3513 [10])\
    \ address of packets of UDP and\n   TCP responses.  With TCP, if a route flips\
    \ and packets to an anycast\n   address are routed to a new server, it is expected\
    \ that the flip is\n   detected by ICMP or sequence number inconsistency, and\
    \ that the TCP\n   connection is reset and retried.\n"

  - "4.  Interworking among IPv6 DNS Configuration Approaches\n   Three approaches\
    \ can work together for IPv6 host configuration of\n   RDNSS.  This section shows\
    \ a consideration on how these approaches\n   can interwork.\n   For ordering\
    \ between RA and DHCP approaches, the O (Other stateful\n   configuration) flag\
    \ in the RA message can be used [6][28].  If no\n   RDNSS option is included,\
    \ an IPv6 host may perform DNS configuration\n   through DHCPv6 [3]-[5] regardless\
    \ of whether the O flag is set or\n   not.\n   The well-known anycast addresses\
    \ approach fully interworks with the\n   other approaches.  That is, the other\
    \ approaches can remove the\n   configuration effort on servers by using the well-known\
    \ addresses as\n   the default configuration.  Moreover, the clients preconfigured\
    \ with\n   the well-known anycast addresses can be further configured to use\n\
    \   other approaches to override the well-known addresses, if the\n   configuration\
    \ information from other approaches is available.\n   Otherwise, all the clients\
    \ need to have the well-known anycast\n   addresses preconfigured.  In order to\
    \ use the anycast approach along\n   with two other approaches, there are three\
    \ choices as follows:\n   1.  The first choice is that well-known addresses are\
    \ used as last\n       resort, when an IPv6 host cannot get RDNSS information\
    \ through RA\n       and DHCP.  The well-known anycast addresses have to be\n\
    \       preconfigured in all of IPv6 hosts' resolver configuration files.\n  \
    \ 2.  The second is that an IPv6 host can configure well-known\n       addresses\
    \ as the most preferable in its configuration file even\n       though either\
    \ an RA option or DHCP option is available.\n   3.  The last is that the well-known\
    \ anycast addresses can be set in\n       RA or DHCP configuration to reduce the\
    \ configuration effort of\n       users.  According to either the RA or DHCP mechanism,\
    \ the well-\n       known addresses can be obtained by an IPv6 host.  Because\
    \ this\n       approach is the most convenient for users, the last option is\n\
    \       recommended.\n   Note: This section does not necessarily mean that this\
    \ document\n   suggests adopting all of these three approaches and making them\n\
    \   interwork in the way described here.  In fact, as a result of further\n  \
    \ discussion some approaches may not even be adopted at all.\n"

- title: 5.1.  ISP Network
  contents:
  - "5.1.  ISP Network\n   A characteristic of an ISP network is that multiple Customer\
    \ Premises\n   Equipment (CPE) devices are connected to IPv6 PE (Provider Edge)\n\
    \   routers and that each PE connects multiple CPE devices to the\n   backbone\
    \ network infrastructure [11].  The CPEs may be hosts or\n   routers.\n   If the\
    \ CPE is a router, there is a customer network that is connected\n   to the ISP\
    \ backbone through the CPE.  Typically, each customer\n   network gets a different\
    \ IPv6 prefix from an IPv6 PE router, but the\n   same RDNSS configuration will\
    \ be distributed.\n   This section discusses how the different approaches to distributing\n\
    \   DNS information are compared in an ISP network.\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  RA Option Approach
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  RA Option Approach\n   When the CPE is a host, the RA option for RDNSS\
    \ can be used to allow\n   the CPE to get RDNSS information and /64 prefix information\
    \ for\n   stateless address autoconfiguration at the same time when the host is\n\
    \   attached to a new subnet [6].  Because an IPv6 host must receive at\n   least\
    \ one RA message for stateless address autoconfiguration and\n   router configuration,\
    \ the host could receive RDNSS configuration\n   information in the RA without\
    \ the overhead of an additional message\n   exchange.\n   When the CPE is a router,\
    \ the CPE may accept the RDNSS information\n   from the RA on the interface connected\
    \ to the ISP and copy that\n   information into the RAs advertised in the customer\
    \ network.\n   This approach is more valuable in the mobile host scenario, in\
    \ which\n   the host must receive at least an RA message for detecting a new\n\
    \   network, than in other scenarios generally, although the\n   administrator\
    \ should configure RDNSS information on the routers.\n   Secure ND [12] can provide\
    \ extended security when RA messages are\n   used.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  DHCPv6 Option Approach
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  DHCPv6 Option Approach\n   DHCPv6 can be used for RDNSS configuration\
    \ through the use of the DNS\n   option, and can provide other configuration information\
    \ in the same\n   message with RDNSS configuration [3]-[5].  The DHCPv6 DNS option\
    \ is\n   already in place for DHCPv6, as RFC 3646 [5] and DHCPv6-lite or\n   stateless\
    \ DHCP [4] is not nearly as complex as a full DHCPv6\n   implementation.  DHCP\
    \ is a client-server model protocol, so ISPs can\n   handle user identification\
    \ on its network intentionally; also,\n   authenticated DHCP [13] can be used\
    \ for secure message exchange.\n   The expected model for deployment of IPv6 service\
    \ by ISPs is to\n   assign a prefix to each customer, which will be used by the\
    \ customer\n   gateway to assign a /64 prefix to each network in the customer's\n\
    \   network.  Prefix delegation with DHCP (DHCPv6 PD) has already been\n   adopted\
    \ by ISPs for automating the assignment of the customer prefix\n   to the customer\
    \ gateway [15].  DNS configuration can be carried in\n   the same DHCPv6 message\
    \ exchange used for DHCPv6 to provide that\n   information efficiently, along\
    \ with any other configuration\n   information needed by the customer gateway\
    \ or customer network.  This\n   service model can be useful to Home or SOHO subscribers.\
    \  The Home or\n   SOHO gateway, which is a customer gateway for ISP, can then\
    \ pass that\n   RDNSS configuration information to the hosts in the customer network\n\
    \   through DHCP.\n"

    \ well-known anycast\n   addresses avoids some of the security risks in rogue\
    \ messages sent\n   through an external protocol such as RA or DHCPv6.  The configuration\n\
    \   of hosts for the use of well-known anycast addresses requires no\n   protocol\
    \ or manual configuration, but the configuration of routing\n   for the anycast\
    \ addresses requires intervention on the part of the\n   network administrator.\
    \  Also, the number of special addresses would\n   be equal to the number of RDNSSes\

- title: 5.2.  Enterprise Network
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Enterprise Network\n   An enterprise network is defined as a network that\
    \ has multiple\n   internal links, one or more router connections to one or more\n\
    \   providers, and is actively managed by a network operations entity\n   [14].\
    \  An enterprise network can get network prefixes from an ISP by\n   either manual\
    \ configuration or prefix delegation [15].  In most\n   cases, because an enterprise\
    \ network manages its own DNS domains, it\n   operates its own DNS servers for\
    \ the domains.  These DNS servers\n   within enterprise networks process recursive\
    \ DNS name resolution\n   requests from IPv6 hosts as RDNSSes.  The RDNSS configuration\
    \ in the\n   enterprise network can be performed as it is in Section 4, in which\n\
    \   three approaches can be used together as follows:\n   1.  An IPv6 host can\
    \ decide which approach is or may be used in its\n       subnet with the O flag\
    \ in RA message [6][28].  As the first\n       choice in Section 4, well-known\
    \ anycast addresses can be used as\n       a last resort when RDNSS information\
    \ cannot be obtained through\n       either an RA option or a DHCP option.  This\
    \ case needs IPv6 hosts\n       to preconfigure the well-known anycast addresses\
    \ in their DNS\n       configuration files.\n   2.  When the enterprise prefers\
    \ the well-known anycast approach to\n       others, IPv6 hosts should preconfigure\
    \ the well-known anycast\n       addresses as it is in the first choice.\n   3.\
    \  The last choice, a more convenient and transparent way, does not\n       need\
    \ IPv6 hosts to preconfigure the well-known anycast addresses\n       because\
    \ the addresses are delivered to IPv6 hosts via either the\n       RA option or\
    \ DHCPv6 option as if they were unicast addresses.\n       This way is most recommended\

    \ Options Information Element (PCO-\n   IE) mechanism [20].  The RDNSS addresses\
    \ can also be received over\n   the air (using text messages) or typed in manually\
    \ in the UE.  Note\n   that the two last mechanisms are not very well scalable.\
    \  The UE user\n   most probably does not want to type IPv6 RDNSS addresses manually\
    \ in\n   the user's UE.  The use of well-known addresses is briefly discussed\n\
    \   in section 5.3.4.\n   It is seen that the mechanisms above most probably are\
    \ not sufficient\n   for the 3GPP environment.  IPv6 is intended to operate in\
    \ a zero-\n   configuration manner, no matter what the underlying network\n  \
    \ infrastructure is.  Typically, the RDNSS address is needed to make an\n   IPv6\
    \ node operational, and the DNS configuration should be as simple\n   as the address\
    \ autoconfiguration mechanism.  Note that there will be\n   additional IP interfaces\
    \ in some near-future 3GPP UEs; e.g., 3GPP-\n   specific DNS configuration mechanisms\
    \ (such as PCO-IE [20]) do not\n   work for those IP interfaces.  In other words,\
    \ a good IPv6 DNS\n   configuration mechanism should also work in a multi-access\
    \ network\n   environment.\n   From a 3GPP point of view, the best IPv6 DNS configuration\
    \ solution\n   is feasible for a very large number of IPv6-capable UEs (even\n\
    \   hundreds of millions in one operator's network), is automatic, and\n   thus\
    \ requires no user action.  It is suggested that a lightweight,\n   stateless\
    \ mechanism be standardized for use in all network\n   environments.  The solution\
    \ could then be used for 3GPP, 3GPP2, and\n   other access network technologies.\
    \  Thus, not only is a light,\n   stateless IPv6 DNS configuration mechanism needed\

    \ solution are:\n   1.  Stateless DHCPv6 is a standardized mechanism.\n   2. \
    \ DHCPv6 can be used for receiving configuration information other\n       than\

    \ integrated into an existing\n       router.  This means that there might be\
    \ one additional server to\n       be maintained.\n   2.  DHCPv6 is not necessarily\
    \ needed for 3GPP UE IPv6 addressing\n       (3GPP Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\
    \ is typically used) and\n       is not automatically implemented in 3GPP IPv6\
    \ UEs.\n   3.  Scalability and reliability of DHCPv6 in very large 3GPP networks\n\
    \       (with tens or hundreds of millions of UEs) may be an issue; at\n     \
    \  least the redundancy needs to be taken care of.  However, if the\n       DHCPv6\

    \   The case where dual-stack hosts behind an NAT need access to an IPv6\n   RDNSS\
    \ cannot be entirely ruled out.  The DNS configuration mechanism\n   has to work\
    \ over the tunnel, and the underlying tunneling mechanism\n   could implement\
    \ NAT traversal.  The tunnel server assumes the role of\n   a relay (for both\
    \ DHCP and well-known anycast addresses approaches).\n   The RA-based mechanism\
    \ is relatively straightforward in its\n   operation, assuming the tunnel server\
    \ is also the IPv6 router\n   emitting RAs.  The well-known anycast addresses\
    \ approach also seems\n   simple in operation across the tunnel, but the deployment\
    \ model using\n   well-known anycast addresses in a tunneled environment is unclear\
    \ or\n   not well understood.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   As security requirements depend solely on applications\
    \ and differ\n   from application to application, there can be no generic requirement\n\
    \   defined at the IP or application layer for DNS.\n   However, note that cryptographic\
    \ security requires configured secret\n   information and that full autoconfiguration\
    \ and cryptographic\n   security are mutually exclusive.  People insisting on\
    \ secure, full\n   autoconfiguration will get false security, false autoconfiguration,\n\
    \   or both.\n   In some deployment scenarios [17], where cryptographic security\
    \ is\n   required for applications, the secret information for the\n   cryptographic\
    \ security is preconfigured, through which application-\n   specific configuration\
    \ data, including those for DNS, can be securely\n   configured.  Note that if\
    \ applications requiring cryptographic\n   security depend on DNS, the applications\
    \ also require cryptographic\n   security to DNS.  Therefore, the full autoconfiguration\
    \ of DNS is not\n   acceptable.\n   However, with full autoconfiguration, weaker\
    \ but still reasonable\n   security is being widely accepted and will continue\
    \ to be acceptable.\n   That is, with full autoconfiguration, which means there\
    \ is no\n   cryptographic security for the autoconfiguration, it is already\n\
    \   assumed that the local environment is secure enough that the\n   information\
    \ from the local autoconfiguration server has acceptable\n   security even without\
    \ cryptographic security.  Thus, the\n   communication between the local DNS client\
    \ and local DNS server has\n   acceptable security.\n   In autoconfiguring recursive\
    \ servers, DNSSEC may be overkill, because\n   DNSSEC [23]-[25] needs the configuration\
    \ and reconfiguration of\n   clients at root key roll-over [26][27].  Even if\
    \ additional keys for\n   secure key roll-over are added at the initial configuration,\
    \ they are\n   as vulnerable as the original keys to some forms of attack, such\
    \ as\n   social hacking.  Another problem of using DNSSEC and\n   autoconfiguration\
    \ together is that DNSSEC requires secure time, which\n   means secure communication\
    \ with autoconfigured time servers, which\n   requires configured secret information.\
    \  Therefore, in order that the\n   autoconfiguration may be secure, configured\
    \ secret information is\n   required.\n   If DNSSEC [23]-[25] is used and the\
    \ signatures are verified on the\n   client host, the misconfiguration of a DNS\
    \ server may simply be\n   denial of service.  Also, if local routing environment\
    \ is not\n   reliable, clients may be directed to a false resolver with the same\n\
    \   IP address as the true one.\n"
- title: 6.1.  RA Option
  contents:
  - "6.1.  RA Option\n   The security of RA option for RDNSS is the same as the ND\
    \ protocol\n   security [1][6].  The RA option does not add any new vulnerability.\n\
    \   Note that the vulnerability of ND is not worse and is a subset of the\n  \
    \ attacks that any node attached to a LAN can do independently of ND.\n   A malicious\
    \ node on a LAN can promiscuously receive packets for any\n   router's MAC address\
    \ and send packets with the router's MAC address\n   as the source MAC address\
    \ in the L2 header.  As a result, the L2\n   switches send packets addressed to\
    \ the router to the malicious node.\n   Also, this attack can send redirects that\
    \ tell the hosts to send\n   their traffic somewhere else.  The malicious node\
    \ can send\n   unsolicited RA or NA replies, answer RS or NS requests, etc.  All\
    \ of\n   this can be done independently of implementing ND.  Therefore, the RA\n\
    \   option for RDNSS does not add to the vulnerability.\n   Security issues regarding\
    \ the ND protocol were discussed by the IETF\n   SEND (Securing Neighbor Discovery)\
    \ Working Group, and RFC 3971 for\n   the ND security has been published [12].\n"
- title: 6.2.  DHCPv6 Option
  contents:
  - "6.2.  DHCPv6 Option\n   The DNS Recursive Name Server option may be used by an\
    \ intruder DHCP\n   server to cause DHCP clients to send DNS queries to an intruder\
    \ DNS\n   recursive name server [5].  The results of these misdirected DNS\n \
    \  queries may be used to spoof DNS names.\n   To avoid attacks through the DNS\
    \ Recursive Name Server option, the\n   DHCP client SHOULD require DHCP authentication\
    \ (see \"Authentication\n   of DHCP messages\" in RFC 3315 [3][13]) before installing\
    \ a list of\n   DNS recursive name servers obtained through authenticated DHCP.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Well-known Anycast Addresses
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Well-known Anycast Addresses\n   The well-known anycast addresses approach\
    \ is not a protocol, thus\n   there is no need to secure the protocol itself.\n\
    \   However, denial of service attacks on the DNS resolver system might\n   be\
    \ easier to achieve as the anycast addresses used are by definition\n   well known.\n"
