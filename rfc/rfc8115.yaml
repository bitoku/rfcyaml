  - "1.  Introduction\n   Several solutions (e.g., [RFC8114]) are proposed for the\
    \ delivery of\n   multicast services in the context of transition to IPv6.  Even\
    \ if\n   these solutions may have different applicable use cases, they all use\n\
    \   specific IPv6 addresses that embed IPv4 addresses, for both multicast\n  \
    \ group and source addresses.\n   This document defines a DHCPv6 option [RFC3315]\
    \ that carries the IPv6\n   prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses.\n   In particular, this option can be used in the context\
    \ of Dual-Stack\n   Lite (DS-Lite) [RFC6333], Stateless Address plus Port (A+P)\n\
    \   [RFC6346], and other IPv4-IPv6 transition techniques.\n"

    \ address.\n   Prefix64:  an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv4-embedded IPv6\n\

    \              Figure 1: Option Format for OPTION_V6_PREFIX64\n   The fields of\
    \ the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:\n   option-code:  OPTION_V6_PREFIX64\
    \ (see Section 6).\n   option-length:  length of the option, in octets.\n   asm-length:\
    \  the prefix length for the ASM IPv4-embedded prefix, as\n      an 8-bit unsigned\
    \ integer.  This field represents the number of\n      valid leading bits in the\
    \ prefix.  This field MUST be set to 96.\n   ASM_mPrefix64:  this field identifies\
    \ the IPv6 multicast prefix to be\n      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 addresses of the\n      multicast groups in the ASM mode.  The conveyed\
    \ multicast IPv6\n      prefix MUST belong to the ASM range.\n   ssm-length: \
    \ the prefix length for the SSM IPv4-embedded prefix, as\n      an 8-bit unsigned\
    \ integer.  This field represents the number of\n      valid leading bits in the\
    \ prefix.  This field MUST be set to 96.\n   SSM_mPrefix64:  this field identifies\
    \ the IPv6 multicast prefix to be\n      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 addresses of the\n      multicast groups in SSM mode.  The conveyed multicast\
    \ IPv6 prefix\n      MUST belong to the SSM range.\n   unicast-length:  the prefix\
    \ length for the IPv6 unicast prefix to be\n      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 addresses of the\n      multicast sources, as an 8-bit unsigned integer.\
    \  As specified in\n      [RFC6052], the unicast-length MUST be one of 32, 40,\
    \ 48, 56, 64,\n      or 96.  This field represents the number of valid leading\
    \ bits in\n      the prefix.\n   uPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 unicast\
    \ prefix to be used\n      in SSM mode for constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6\
    \ addresses\n      representing the IPv4 multicast sources in the IPv6 domain.\n\
    \      uPrefix64 may also be used to extract the IPv4 address from the\n     \
    \ received multicast data flows.  It is a variable-size field with\n      the\
    \ length of the field defined by the unicast-length field and is\n      rounded\
    \ up to the nearest octet boundary.  In this case, any\n      additional padding\
    \ bits must be zeroed.  The address mapping MUST\n      follow the guidelines\
    \ documented in [RFC6052].\n   Multiple instances of OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 may be\
    \ returned to a DHCPv6\n   client.  Configuration recommendations for DHCP servers\
    \ are listed in\n   Appendix A.\n   Note that it was tempting to define three\
    \ distinct DHCPv6 options,\n   but that approach was not adopted because it has\
    \ a side effect: the\n   specification of a DHCPv6 option that could be used to\
    \ discover\n   unicast Prefix64s in environments where multicast is not enabled.\n\
    \   Such a side effect conflicts with the recommendation to support the\n   Well-Known\
    \ DNS Name heuristic discovery-based method for unicast-only\n   environments\
    \ (Section 6 of [RFC7051]).\n"
- title: 4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior\n   To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used\
    \ to synthesize unicast\n   and multicast IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6\
    \ client MUST\n   include the OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 code in its OPTION_ORO.  If the\
    \ DHCPv6\n   client receives more than one OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 option from the\n\
    \   DHCPv6 server:\n   o  If each enclosed IPv6 multicast prefix has a distinct\
    \ scope\n      [RFC7346], the client MUST select the appropriate IPv6 multicast\n\
    \      prefix whose scope matches the IPv4 multicast address used to\n      synthesize\
    \ an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.\n   o  If at least two of the received\
    \ options convey IPv6 multicast\n      prefixes that have the same scope, the\
    \ said options MUST be\n      discarded.\n   If asm-length, ssm-length and unicast-length\
    \ fields are all set to 0,\n   the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION_V6_PREFIX64\
    \ had not been\n   received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.\n\
    \   If the asm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by\n   ASM_mPrefix64\
    \ is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast\n   addresses in the ASM\
    \ range.  This is achieved by concatenating the\n   ASM_mPrefix64 and the IPv4\
    \ multicast address; the IPv4 multicast\n   address is inserted in the last 32\
    \ bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6\n   multicast address.\n   If the ssm-length\
    \ field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by\n   SSM_mPrefix64 is used to\
    \ synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast\n   addresses in the SSM range.  This\
    \ is achieved by concatenating the\n   SSM_mPrefix64 and the IPv4 multicast address;\
    \ the IPv4 multicast\n   address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6\n   multicast address.\n   If the unicast-length field is non-null, the\
    \ IPv6 prefix identified\n   by uPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded\
    \ IPv6 unicast\n   addresses as specified in [RFC6052].\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Configuration Recommendations for DHCP Servers\n   This appendix\
    \ details a set of non-normative configuration\n   recommendations:\n   o  DHCP\
    \ servers supporting OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 must be configured with\n      ASM_mPrefix64\
    \ or SSM_mPrefix64, and may be configured with both.\n   o  uPrefix64 must also\
    \ be configured when SSM_mPrefix64 is provided.\n   o  uPrefix64 may be configured\
    \ when ASM_mPrefix64 is provided.\n      Note that uPrefix64 is not mandatory\
    \ for the ASM case if, for\n      example, a local address mapping algorithm is\
    \ supported or the\n      Well-Known Prefix (64:ff9b::/96) is used.\n   o  Both\
    \ ASM_mPrefix64 and SSM_mPrefix64 may be configured and\n      therefore be returned\
    \ to a requesting DHCP client in the same\n      OPTION_V6_PREFIX64.  In particular,\
    \ if both SSM and ASM modes are\n      supported, ASM_mPrefix64 and SSM_mPrefix64\
    \ prefixes must be\n      configured.  For SSM deployments, both SSM_mPrefix64\
    \ and uPrefix64\n      must be configured.\n   o  When a multicast Prefix64 (ASM_mPrefix64\

    \   o  When distinct IPv6 multicast address scopes [RFC7346] are required\n  \
    \    to preserve the scope when translating IPv4 multicast addresses\n      (Section\
    \ 8 of [RFC2365]), each scope is configured as a separate\n      OPTION_V6_PREFIX64.\
    \  How DHCP servers are configured to separate\n      multicast Prefix64 per scope\
    \ is implementation specific and not\n      covered by this document.\n   o  When\
