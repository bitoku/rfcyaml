  - "Abstract\n   As the demand for networked realtime services grows, so does the\
    \ need\n   for shared networks to provide deterministic delivery services. Such\n\
    \   deterministic delivery services demand that both the source\n   application\
    \ and the network infrastructure have capabilities to\n   request, setup, and\
    \ enforce the delivery of the data. Collectively\n   these services are referred\
    \ to as bandwidth reservation and Quality\n   of Service (QoS).\n   The IETF is\
    \ currently working on an integrated services model to\n   support realtime services\
    \ on the Internet  The IETF has not yet\n   focused on the integration of ATM\
    \ and its inherent QoS and bandwidth\n   allocation mechanisms for delivery of\
    \ realtime traffic over shared\n   wires. (ATM hardware and interfaces provide\
    \ the network\n   infrastructure for the determinitic data delivery, however the\
    \ host\n   resident protocol stacks and applications need more attention.)\n \
    \  Current IETF efforts underway in the IP over ATM (ipatm) working\n   group\
    \ rely on intserv, rsvp and ST2 to address QoS issues for ATM. As\n   such, RFC\

  - "1.0 Introduction\n   The ATM Forum and the IETF seem to approach ATM networking\n\
    \   differently.\n   The ATM forum appeaars to believe that host systems require\
    \ no\n   protocols beyond OSI layer 2 to deal with ATM.  They define a layer 2\n\
    \   API and Q.2931 signaling for all new applications.\n   LAN Emulation, a mechanism\
    \ to make the ATM interface appear to be a\n   LAN/internet, is intended to support\
    \ 'legacy' network applications.\n   LAN emulation does not provide applications\
    \ any visibility of the ATM\n   features, nor does it provide a mechanism to allow\
    \ applications to\n   request specific ATM services. With LAN Emulation, application\n\
    \   traffic shares virtual circuits with no policing or guarantees of\n   service.\
    \ LAN Emulation simply extends LAN characteristics to ATM.\n   Thus far, the IETF,\
    \ through  RFC 1577[1]  treats an ATM network as a\n   wire.  The ipatm working\
    \ group has explicitly left issues of specific\n   QoS handling out of their specifications\
    \ and working documents.\n   Current approaches do not give the application access\
    \ to individual\n   virtualcircuits and their associated guaranteed bandwidth\
    \ and QoS.\n   Instead, all IP traffic between two hosts shares virtual circuits\n\
    \   with no granularity assigned to application-specific traffic or QoS\n   requirements.\n\
    \   Thus, neither LAN Emulation nor RFC 1577 (IP over ATM) uses the\n   features\
    \ of ATM that make it a unique and desirable technology.  RFC\n   1821 (Integration\
    \ of Realtime Services in an IP-ATM Network\n   Architecture) [2] raises many\
    \ of the issues associated with current\n   IETF efforts towards integrating ATM\
    \ into the Internet, but it does\n   not propose any solutions.\n   This document\
    \ offers a  framework for provision of native ATM\n   circuits for applications\
    \ which require bandwidth guarantees and QoS.\n   It identifies  the requirements\
    \ of  a native ATM protocol which is\n   complementary to standard IP and describes\
    \ one working\n   implementation.\n   This document recognizes  the fact that\
    \ it is critical that such a\n   native ATM  protocol  is consistent in the four\
    \ topologies described\n   in [2]:\n   *       Communication across an ATM-only\
    \ network between two hosts\n           directly connected to the ATM network,\n\
    \   *       Communication between ATM connected hosts which involves some\n  \
    \         non-ATM subnets,\n   *       Communication between a host on a non-ATM\
    \ subnet and a host\n           directly connected to ATM,\n   *       Communication\
    \ between two hosts, neither of which has a direct\n           ATM connection,\
    \ but which may make use of one or more ATM\n           networks for some part\
    \ of the path.\n   That is, to the host systems, the underlying type of network\
    \ remains\n   transparent even when QoS is involved in internet, ATM, and mixed\n\
    \   networking environments.  To make this consistency possible, the\n   'native\
    \ ATM' protocol must also be:\n   *       Multicast capable, to optimize transmission\
    \ overhead and\n           support ATM multipoint facilities,\n   *       Routable,\
    \ to enable transmissions across subnets and\n           internets,\n   *    \
    \   QoS knowledgeable, to take advantage of ATM QoS facilities,\n   *       Capable\
    \ of Bandwidth/QoS Reservation to allocate proper\n           facilities for application\
    \ traffic as it travels across\n           different types of networks: to effectively\
    \ extend virtual\n           circuits across internets, and\n   *       Capable\
    \ of policing to ensure proper packet scheduling\n           behavior and to protect\
    \ guaranteed services at merge points.\n   Clearly the protocol should support\
    \ reservations.  Reservation\n   protocols enable creation of  'virtual circuits'\
    \  with guaranteed\n   bandwidth and QoS on the LAN or internet, and simultaneously\
    \ can act\n   as signaling mechanisms to routers or ATM interfaces to request\n\
    \   provisioning of circuits. Use of a reservation protocol makes\n   characteristics\
    \ of  mixed networks (LANs, internet, ATM, ISDN)\n   transparent to the host systems.\
    \   That is, a reservation will allow\n   the host or router to provision ATM\
    \ circuits which match the\n   reservation, but in mixed networks, will allow\
    \ routers and host to\n   provide bandwidth reservation and QoS across the non-ATM\
    \ interfaces\n   as well.  Effectively, the reservation maps ATM virtual circuits\
    \ to\n   reservations on subnets and internets.\n   This creates a consistent\
    \ End-to-End, QoS-guaranteed service for\n   mixed network topologies.\n   While\
    \ it is beyond the scope of this document, the same requirements\n   apply to\
    \ mixed ISDN networks and are currently being explored by the\n   ITU for their\
    \ H.323, H.223, and T.123 standards.\n   Arguably, the reservation protocol that\
    \ provides this end-to-end\n   guaranteed service should be connection-oriented\
    \ to facilitate\n   mapping of real connections (ATM or ISDN) with virtual connections\
    \ on\n   the LAN/internet.  [2] points out the shortcomings of IP and RSVP [3]\n\
    \   in the ATM environment. Most notable among these are the difficulty\n   of\
    \ mapping connectionless traffic to ATM connections, the constant\n   softstate\
    \ refreshes of RSVP (and merging of RESV messages), the\n   receiver orientation\
    \ of  RSVP, and the dependence on IP multicast.\n   [6] is an excellent document\
    \ that proposes solutions to many of the\n   issues raised in [2], but the solutions\
    \ recommend modifications to\n   the current RSVP and ATM implementations.  Recently,\
    \ issues of\n   incompatibility with the current IP over ATM model, VC explosions\
    \ due\n   to use of multicast groups and VC explosions due to features\n   associated\
    \ with heterogeneous receivers suggest that the current\n   version of RSVP may\
    \ be inappropriate for ATM implementations.\n   Since ATM is connection-oriented,\
    \ hard state, and origin-oriented for\n   transmission, signaling, and multicast,\
    \ and is bandwidth and QoS\n   knowledgeable, perhaps the simplest and most elegant\
    \ approach to a\n   native protocol for ATM would include a protocol that shares\
    \ these\n   characteristics.\n   In surveying protocols described in IETF RFCs\
    \ and Internet Drafts,\n   only two seem to meet these requirements: Experimental\
    \ Internet\n   Stream Protocol: Version 2 (RFC 1190) [4] and Internet STream\n\
    \   Protocol Version 2+ (RFC 1819) [5]; ST2 and ST2+ respectively.\n"
- title: 2.0 ST2 and ST2+
  contents:
  - "2.0 ST2 and ST2+\n   Both ST2 and ST2+ have been given the Internet Protocol\
    \ Version 5\n   (IPv5) designation.  In fact, ST2+ is an updated version of ST2.\n\
    \   Both protocols are origin-oriented reservation and multicast\n   protocols\
    \ that provide bandwidth and QoS guarantees through\n   internets.  Unlike IPv4\
    \ or IPv6, ST2 and ST2+ are connection-\n   oriented, subscribing to the philosophy\
    \ that once a connection is\n   established, protocol and routing overhead can\
    \ be substantially\n   reduced.  This carries forward to QoS and Bandwidth Reservation\
    \ as\n   well, simplifying the implementation of QoS guarantees. THESE\n   PROTOCOLS\
    \ WERE INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT STANDARD CONNECTIONLESS IP,\n   RECOGNIZING THAT\
    \ WHILE MOST INTERNET TRAFFIC BENEFITS FROM\n   CONNECTIONLESS NETWORKING, PERFORMANCE\
    \ AND QoS GUARANTEES COULD BE\n   ACHIEVED MOST EASILY WITH INTERNET CONNECTIONS.\n\
    \   Both ST2 and ST2+ really consist of two protocols: SCMP and ST.  SCMP\n  \
    \ is analogous to ICMP in that it is the control and signaling\n   protocol, while\
    \ ST is the low-overhead streaming protocol.   ST-2\n   uses standard IP addresses\
    \ during connection setup, but then reduces\n   header overhead by including a\
    \ stream identifier in each data packet.\n   ST2+ includes simplification of many\
    \ of the original ST2 features as\n   well as clarification of the ST2 specification.\
    \  Among these\n   simplifications and clarifications are:\n   1) Much simpler\
    \ connection setup.\n   2) Flow Specification independence and consolidation of\
    \ experimental\n      Flow Specifications.\n   3) Clarification on the implementation\
    \ of Groups of Streams.\n   4) Clarification of leaf-initiated JOINs in multicast\
    \ trees (several\n      ST2 implementations had done this).\n   While there continues\
    \ to be a  dramatic increase in the use of ST2\n   for videoconferencing, video\
    \ on demand, telemetry applications and\n   networked virtual reality, ST2+  has\
    \ no commercial implementations\n   and is not yet supported by any router vendors.\
    \  This is because ST2+\n   was released as an RFC late in the summer of 1995.\
    \  It is expected\n   that several implementations will appear over the coming\
    \ months.  As\n   such, the approach described in this document applies to both\n\
    \   protocols, and, in fact, would be valid for any other similar\n   protocol\
    \ used to establish 'native' ATM circuits.  Since ST2 and ST2+\n   are so similar,\
    \ this document will refer to  'the ST2 protocols'\n   generically in describing\
    \ an implementation approach to both.  Where\n   particular features of ST2+ are\
    \ required or affect implementation,\n   'ST2+ ' will be used specifically.\n"

  - "3.0 Implementation Issues for Reservations over ATM\n   As described above, ST\
    \ is a connection-oriented, hard state, origin-\n   oriented multicast protocol\
    \ and thus maps fairly well to ATM.\n   However, ST-2 has several features that\

- title: 3.1 Addressing
  contents:
  - "3.1 Addressing\n   Of course mapping an Internet address to ATM address is always\n\
    \   problematic.  It would be possible to set up a well known ARP server\n   to\
    \ resolve the IP addresses of targets.  However, the widespread\n   deployment\
    \ of IP over ATM and LAN emulation in host-based ATM\n   drivers, and the assumption\
    \ that most host systems will be running\n   some  IP applications that do not\
    \ need specific QoS and bandwidth\n   provisioning, suggests that  use of ARP\
    \ facilities provided by IP\n   over ATM and LAN Emulation  is the most obvious\
    \ choice for address\n   resolution.\n   It should be noted that ATMARP returns\
    \ the ATM address.  For some\n   implementations (particularly kernel-based protocols),\
    \ an NSAP\n   address is also required.  Since these addresses are often difficult\n\
    \   to get from the ATM network itself in advance of the connection, it\n   may\
    \ be necessary to invoke out-of-band signaling mechanisms to pass\n   this address,\
    \ or it may be better to create an NSAP address server.\n"
- title: 3.2 Changes to Bandwidth and QoS
  contents:
  - "3.2 Changes to Bandwidth and QoS\n   Both ST-2 and ST-2+ allow the origin to\
    \ dynamically change the QoS\n   and Bandwidth of a particular stream.  At this\
    \ time Q.2931 and UNI\n   3.1 do not support this feature. Until this capability\
    \ is available,\n   full support of the SCMP CHANGE message for dedicated ATM\
    \ circuits\n   (one reservation = one ATM circuit) can only be implemented  by\n\
    \   tearing down the existing VC for a stream and establishing a new one\n   if\
    \ efficient use of ATM resources are to be preserved.\n   Of course, the CHANGE\
    \ message can simply be passed across the ATM\n   virtual circuit to the hosts\
    \ or routers. This would allow the hosts\n   to relax resource requirements locally,\
    \ and permit routers to relax\n   access to downstream circuits, but the ATM VC\
    \ itself, would still\n   retain excessive bandwidth.\n   In addition, if the\
    \ implementation allows sharing of virtual circuits\n   by multiple streams, the\
    \ bandwidth/QoS of individual streams within\n   the VC can be CHANGEd.\n"
- title: 3.3 Multicasting
  contents:
  - "3.3 Multicasting\n   ST-2 and ST-2+ support origin-oriented multicasting.  That\
    \ is, the\n   origin of a stream explicitly specifies the addresses of the targets\n\
    \   it wants involved in the connection.  In addition, the origin can Add\n  \
    \ or drop targets as desired.  Aside from receiver-initiated JOINs\n   (discussed\
    \ in section 3.4), there is a one to one mapping between\n   ST-2 multicast and\
    \ ATM multipoint connections.  Origin-initiated\n   additions can be accomplished\
    \ through an ADDPARTY, and drops can be\n   done through DROPPARTY.\n   A key\
    \ goal in implementation of a native ATM protocol is to ensure\n   consistent\
    \ implementation for unicast and multicast data transfers.\n   One difficulty\
    \ in doing this with ATM Virtual Circuits is the fact\n   that point-to-point\
    \ circuits are duplex, while multipoint circuits\n   are simplex.  This means\
    \ that for multicast connections to be mapped\n   to multipoint ATM Virtual Circuits,\
    \ any two-way, end-to-end signaling\n   must be done out of band.  An alternative\
    \ is to  let the local\n   reservation agent act as a split/merge point for the\
    \ connection by\n   establishing point-to-point Virtual Circuits for each member\
    \ of the\n   multicast group directly connected to the ATM network.  For multicast\n\
    \   group members not directly connected to the ATM network, traffic can\n   be\
    \ multicast to the router connected at the edge across a single\n   virtual circuit\
    \ associated with the reservation.\n   Section 4 describes alternative mechanisms\
    \ for implementing\n   signaling.\n   Included in each discussion is the optimal\
    \ means for mapping\n   multicast to ATM  point-to-point or multipoint circuits.\n\
    \   Note that the fact that ST-2 does not rely on IP multicast is a\n   strong\
    \ advantage in implementation of a native protocol for ATM.  The\n   one-to-one\
    \ mapping of ST-2 multicast connections to ATM multipoint\n   virtual circuits\
    \ minimizes the number of circuits required to support\n   large multicast groups.\n"
- title: 3.4 Receiver Initiated JOINs to Multicast Groups
  contents:
  - "3.4 Receiver Initiated JOINs to Multicast Groups\n   ST-2+ provides an in-band\
    \ mechanism to permit receivers to join an\n   existing stream.  Based on an origin-established\
    \ authorization level,\n   the JOIN can be refused immediately, can be allowed\
    \ with notification\n   of the origin, or can be allowed without notifying the\
    \ origin.  This\n   capability is made available through a new SCMP JOIN message.\
    \  If the\n   receiver knows the IP address of the origin and the Stream ID, he\
    \ can\n   join the stream if authorized to do so.\n   Note that since the JOIN\
    \ flows from the receiver to the origin, there\n   will be issues in trying to\
    \  support this feature with Q.2931 and UNI\n   3.1. The JOIN may have to be sent\

- title: 3.5 Computation of QoS Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.5 Computation of QoS Parameters\n   The recommended flow specifications (flowspecs)\
    \ for ST-2 and ST-2+\n   include parameters that are not currently available to\
    \ ATM virtual\n   circuits through Q.2931 and  UNI 3.1.  The mapping of packet\
    \ rate to\n   cell rate,  packet delay to cell delay, and other translatable QoS\n\
    \   parameters is described in section 5.  However,  the ST-2 flowspecs\n   also\
    \ include parameters like accumulated end-to-end delay and\n   accumulated jitter.\
    \  These parameters assume that the SCMP messages\n   follow the same path as\
    \ the data.  Depending on the signaling\n   mechanism chosen, this may not be\
    \ true with ATM and thus certain QoS\n   parameters may be rendered useless.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that since ST-2 connections are simplex, all\n   QoS\
    \ parameters are specified separately for each direction of data\n   transfer.\
    \  Thus two connections and two QoS negotiations are required\n   for a duplex\
    \ connection.  To take advantage of the full duplex nature\n   of point-to-point\
    \ ATM connections, special multiplexing of ST\n   connections would be required\
    \ by ST-2 agents.\n"
- title: 3.6 Use of HELLOs

  - "3.6 Use of HELLOs\n   Both ST-2 and ST-2+ support HELLO messages.  HELLOs are\

    \ an ST-2 agent if the network\n   connection is down, there is still the possibility\
    \ that the\n   connection is intact but that the ST-2 agent itself is down.\n\
    \   Knowledge of the neighboring agent's status is increasingly important\n  \
    \ when multiple ST-2 connections share virtual circuits, when the\n   neighboring\
    \ agents are routers, and when there are multiple dedicated\n   virtual circuits\
    \ between agents.\n   As such, HELLO is a desirable feature.  Note that some signaling\n\

- title: 4.0 Reservation Signaling with ATM
  contents:
  - "4.0 Reservation Signaling with ATM\n   Use of Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)\
    \ for reservation signaling\n   presents no problem for ST-2, ST-2+, or RSVP.\
    \  Each circuit is\n   considered to be a dedicated link to the next hop.  If\
    \ the PVCs are\n   to be shared, reservation protocols can divide and regulate\
    \ the\n   bandwidth just as they would with any other link type.\n   Where ATM\
    \ connections become more interesting is when the ATM network\n   takes on the\
    \ role of an extended LAN or internet.  To do this,\n   Switched Virtual Circuits\
    \ are used to establish dynamic connections\n   to various endpoints and routers.\
    \  The ITU-TS Q.2931 SETUP message is\n   used to request a connection from the\
    \ network with specific bandwidth\n   and QoS requirements, and a CONNECT message\
    \ is received by the origin\n   to indicate that connection establishment is complete.\n\
    \   For IP over ATM and LAN Emulation, SVCs are established between\n   endpoints\
    \ and data traffic for a given destination shares the SVCs.\n   There is no mechanism\

    \  The goal is to use\n   reservations to request establishment of individual\

    \ This will\n   guarantee the requirements of the application while taking full\n\
    \   advantage of the ATM network's capabilities.\n   There are four possible mechanisms\

    \   The basic idea in embedding reservation signaling within the ATM\n   controls\
    \ is to use the Q.2931 SETUP and CONNECT messages to establish\n   both reservations\
    \ and dedicated data paths (virtual circuits) across\n   the ATM network.  This\
    \ eliminates the need for dedicated signaling\n   channels, in-band signaling,\
    \ or out of band mechanisms to communicate\n   between endpoints.  Since SETUP\
    \ and CONNECT include bandwidth and QoS\n   information, the basic concept is\
    \ sound.  In fact, this approach will\n   speed network connection by preventing\
    \ multiple passes at\n   establishing a reservation and associated connection.\
    \  This normally\n   results from the fact that most higher layer protocols (network\
    \ and\n   transport) first require a link to signal their connection\n   requirements.\
    \  As such,  with ATM, the ATM virtual circuit must be\n   established before\
    \ the network  and/or transport protocols can do\n   their own signaling.\n  \
    \ Embedded reservation signaling allows the reservation information to\n   be\
    \ carried in the SETUP and CONNECT messages, allowing the\n   reservation protocol\
    \ to do its signaling simultaneously with the ATM\n   signaling.\n   [7] describes\
    \ a clever way of combining the reservation signaling\n   with the ATM control\
    \ plane signaling for ST-2.  This 'simultaneous\n   connection establishment'\
    \ process will optimize the establishment of\n   circuits and minimize connection\
    \ setup time while simultaneously\n   eliminating unnecessary network layer signaling\
    \ in ST-2.  To be\n   effective, [7] requires enhancements to Q.2931 signaling\
    \ and to the\n   ST-2 protocol implementations.  In addition, it currently only\n\
    \   applies to point-to-point connections and will not work with\n   multipoint\
    \ largely due to the simplex nature of multipoint\n   communication in current\
    \ ATM implementations.\n   Implementation of multicast for Embedded Reservation\
    \ Signaling is\n   done as described above: the reservation agent at the edge\
    \ of the ATM\n   network must create point-to-point virtual circuits for each\
    \ target\n   that is directly connected to the ATM network, and for each router\n\
    \   that supports downstream targets.  This ensures two-way signaling\n   between\
    \ targets and the origin.\n   Signaling itself is quite simple:\n        CONNECT\
    \ maps directly to one or more (multicast) Q.2931\n                SETUPs and\
    \ CONNECTs.\n        ACCEPT maps directly to Q.2931 CONNECTACK.\n        CHANGE/CHANGE\
    \ REQUEST are  not supported.\n        DISCONNECT maps directly to Q.2931 RELEASE.\n\
    \        HELLOs are not needed.\n   Unfortunately, the flowspec in the reservation\
    \ protocol CONNECT\n   message cannot be passed across the ATM network in the\
    \ signaling\n   messages and thus must be regenerated by the receiving agent.\n\
    \   In addition, User Data, which can be sent in most SCMP messages\n   cannot\
    \ be supported without substantial changes to current Q.2931\n   signaling.\n\
    \   One of the additional complexities with embedding the reservation\n   signaling\
    \ occurs in heterogeneous networks.  Since ATM signaling only\n   operates point\
    \ to point across the ATM network itself, if the\n   endpoints reside on other\
    \ types of networks or subnets, the routers\n   at the edge of the ATM networks\
    \ must generate and regenerate\n   endpoint-based signaling messages on behalf\
    \ of the host reservation\n   agents.  In particular, CONNECT and ACCEPT messages\
    \ and their\n   associated flowspecs must be regenerated.  Refer to Section 5\
    \ for\n   details on the QoS mappings and on which QoS parameters can be\n   recreated\
    \ for the generated flowspecs.\n   This approach is worth revisiting as an optimal\
    \ signaling method in\n   pure ATM network environments once ATM signaling capabilities\
    \ expand.\n   However, for heterogeneous networks,  other signaling mechanisms\
    \ may\n   be more appropriate.\n"

  - "4.2 In-Band Reservation Signaling\n   In-Band Reservation Signaling is the easiest\
    \ signaling mechanism to\n   implement.  When the applications requests a reservation,\
    \ the\n   reservation agent simply sets up ATM virtual circuits to the\n   endpoints\
    \ with the   QoS specified in the CONNECT request.  When\n   ACCEPTed, all subsequent\
    \ data transmissions proceed  on the virtual\n   circuits.\n   Once again, to\
    \ support multicast, the reservation agent must create\n   individual point-to-point\
    \ virtual circuits to the targets which are\n   directly connected to the ATM\
    \ network, as well as to routers which\n   can access downstream targets.\n  \
    \ Since signaling is done in-band, all reservation signaling messages\n   can\
    \ be passed between agents.  However, some minimal additional\n   bandwidth must\
    \ be allocated in the Q.2931 SETUP to allow for the\n   signaling messages themselves.\n\
    \   Note that the primary disadvantage to In-Band Reservation Signaling\n   is\
    \ the fact that it does not make use of  the multipoint capabilities\n   of ATM\

    \ necessary number of virtual circuits.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3 Dedicated Reservation Signaling Virtual Circuits\n   One mechanism that can\
    \ be used to take advantage of the full data\n   transmission capabilities of\
    \ ATM networks is to use Dedicated Virtual\n   Circuits for reservation signaling.\
    \  This guarantees a two-way\n   signaling pipe between the endpoints in a connection\
    \ while enabling\n   the data transmission to take advantage of the multipoint\n\
    \   capabilities of ATM.  Data and Signaling are done over separate\n   virtual\
    \ circuits.\n   When an application requests a reservation, the reservation agent\n\
    \   reviews the list of targets in the CONNECT request.  For any targets\n   which\
    \ have no current signaling virtual circuits established, the\n   agent establishes\
    \ UBR (unspecified bit rate) virtual circuits and\n   forwards the CONNECT message\
    \ to the targets over these virtual\n   circuits. ATMARP is used to resolve any\
    \ endpoint addresses.  For any\n   targets for which there already exist signaling\
    \ virtual circuits, the\n   agent simply forwards the CONNECT message over the\
    \ existing virtual\n   circuit.\n   Once an ACCEPT message is received, the agent\
    \ issues a Q.2931 SETUP\n   to the associated target.  Upon receipt of a CONNECTACK,\
    \ data can\n   begin to flow.  As additional ACCEPTs are received, the Q.2931\n\
    \   ADDPARTY message is used to add a target to the multicast and\n   multipoint\
    \ connection.  Depending on the cause of any ADDPARTY\n   failure, the agent may\
    \ attempt to establish a dedicated point-to-\n   point virtual circuit to complete\
    \ the multicast group.\n   DISCONNECT requests result in  Q.2931 DROPPARTY messages\
    \ and will\n   cause a member to be dropped from a multicast and multipoint\n\
    \   connection.  When all targets are dropped from a multipoint\n   connection,\
    \ a RELEASE can be issued to take down the virtual circuit.\n   Signaling virtual\
    \ circuits are shared among reservations while data\n   circuits are dedicated\
    \ to a particular  reservation.   Once all\n   reservations to a given endpoint\
    \ are terminated, the signaling\n   virtual circuit to that endpoint can be RELEASEd.\n\
    \   Note that this approach  would allow the NSAP address to be passed as\n  \
    \ user data in the ACCEPT message to enable a kernel-based reservation\n   protocol\
    \ to establish the dedicated data circuit.  In addition,\n   because the connectivity\
    \ to the endpoint is identical to that of the\n   data circuit, this approach\
    \ assures the fact that accumulated\n   information in the flowspecs retains it\
    \ validity.\n"
- title: 4.4 Reservation Signaling via IP over ATM or LAN Emulation
  contents:
  - "4.4 Reservation Signaling via IP over ATM or LAN Emulation\n   As described in\
    \ the previous section, it would be possible to set up\n   unique SVCs for SCMP\
    \ signaling, however, since the streaming,\n   connection-oriented data transport\
    \ offered by ST-2 is intended to be\n   complementary to IP and other connectionless\
    \ protocol\n   implementations, it would be simpler and more elegant to simply\
    \ use\n   classical IP over ATM (RFC 1577) mechanisms, or to use LAN Emulation.\n\
    \   The widespread deployment of IP over ATM and LAN emulation in host-\n   based\
    \ ATM drivers, and the assumption that most host systems will be\n   running applications\
    \ that do not need specific QoS and bandwidth\n   provisioning, makes this the\
    \ most straightforward (if not performance\n   optimal) solution for signaling.\
    \  Once an end-to-end acceptance of a\n   reservation request is completed via\
    \ normal LAN or IP transmission,\n   then a unique direct virtual circuit can\
    \ be established for each data\n   flow.\n   If LAN Emulation is used, as long\
    \ as the ST-2 implementation allows\n   for different paths for SCMP and data,\
    \ there would be no changes to\n   the signaling mechanisms employed by the reservation\
    \ agent.\n   For IP over ATM, all SCMP messages would be encapsulated in IP as\n\
    \   described in both RFC 1190 and RFC 1819.  This is required because\n   current\
    \ ATM drivers will not accept Ipv5 packets, and most drivers do\n   not provide\
    \ direct access to the shared signaling virtual circuits\n   used for IP.\n  \
    \ In either case, LAN Emulation or IP over ATM, the reservation agent\n   would\
    \ handle SCMP messages as it normally does.  However, once the\n   first ACCEPT\
    \ is received for  a reservation request, a dedicated\n   virtual circuit is established\
    \ for the data flow.  Subsequent ACCEPTs\n   will result in the use of ADDPARTY\
    \ to add multicast targets to the\n   multipoint virtual circuit.  In fact, processing\
    \ of\n   multipoint/multicast is identical to that described in section 4.3.\n\
    \   Once again, the use of an out-of-band signaling mechanism makes it\n   possible\
    \ to carry the NSAP address of the target in the ACCEPT\n   message.\n   One potential\
    \ drawback to using LAN Emulation or SCMP messages\n   encapsulated in IP over\
    \ ATM, is the fact that there is no guarantee\n   that the connectivity achieved\
    \ to reach the target via signaling has\n   any relationship to the data path.\
    \  This means that accumulated\n   values in the flowspec may be rendered useless.\n\
    \   In addition, it is possible that the targets will actually  reside\n   outside\
    \ the ATM network.  That is, there may be no direct ATM access\n   to the Targets\
    \ and it may be difficult to identify ATM addresses of\n   the associated ATM\
    \ connected routers.  This approach will involve\n   some additional complexity\
    \ in routing to the targets.  However, since\n   ST-2 is intended to run with\
    \ IP, if ATM vendors would accept IPv5\n   packets or would allow direct access\
    \ to the IP over ATM signaling\n   virtual circuits, this approach would be optimal\
    \ in minimizing the\n   number of virtual circuits required.\n"

    \ (section 4.1) is ideal for homogeneous\n   ATM connections, but  requires extensions\
    \ to existing ATM signaling\n   to support multipoint connections.  In-Band Reservation\
    \ Signaling\n   (section 4.2) is the easiest to implement, but cannot employ\n\
    \   multipoint connections either.\n   Perhaps the simplest way to do this is\
    \ similar to what is suggested\n   in [6]: separate the reservation signaling\
    \ from the actual data\n   flows, mapping the data flows directly to ATM circuits\
    \ while doing\n   the signaling separately.\n   While there is significant complexity\
    \ in doing this for IP traffic\n   and RSVP, the ST2 protocols lend themselves\
    \ to this quite well.  In\n   fact, because SCMP reservation signaling results\
    \ in streaming,\n   multicast connections, the 'Shortcut' mechanism described\
    \ in [6],\n   which can bypass routers where direct ATM connections are possible,\n\
    \   is automatically available to ST2 streams.\n   Using Reservation Signaling\
    \ over LAN Emulation or IP over ATM\n   (section 4.4) is one multipoint-capable\
    \ approach  to implement in\n   hosts since most ATM drivers shipping today provide\
    \ both IP over ATM\n   and LAN Emulation, as well as associated address resolution\n\
    \   mechanisms. However, it is not complete in its ability to accurately\n   depict\
    \ flowspec parameters or to resolve host ATM addresses. In\n   addition, to be\
    \ optimal, ATM vendors would either have to support\n   IPv5 in their drivers\
    \ or allow direct access to the IP signaling\n   virtual circuits.  Thus the current\
    \ ideal approach to implementation\n   of the ST2 protocols over ATM is to use\
    \ shared Dedicated Reservation\n   Signaling Virtual Circuits (section 4.3) for\
    \ signaling of\n   reservations, and then to establish appropriate multipoint\

  - "7.0 Implementation Experience and Conclusions\n   All of the signaling mechanisms\
    \ described in Section 4 were\n   implemented and tested in a mixed ATM network/routed\
    \ LAN environment.\n   Initially it appeared that the best approach was to do\
    \ signaling via\n   IP over ATM or LANE.  However, because it required IP encapsulation\n\
    \   of the SCMP packets (for IP over ATM), and because some applications\n   use\
    \ the accumulated values in the flowspecs (which are not guaranteed\n   to be\
    \ accurate in LANE and IP/ATM), using virtual circuits dedicated\n   to SCMP signaling\
    \  turned out to be the best implementation for\n   taking full advantage of the\
    \ ATM features.\n   Also, the issue of mapping ATM address to E.164 NSAP addresses\
    \ was\n   resolved through an external signaling mechanism (the User Data field\n\
    \   of the ST-2 CONNECT and ACCEPT messages).  It appears that ATM\n   vendors\
    \ need to implement a consistent addressing mechanism\n   throughout their interfaces.\n\
    \   From a performance point of view, using ST over ATM provided more\n   than\
    \ triple the performance of raw IP.  The differences became\n   increasingly clear\
    \ as more simultaneous applications were run.  This\n   resulted in dedicated\
    \ virtual circuits for the ST traffic while the\n   IP traffic suffered (saw inconsistent\
    \ performance) over shared\n   circuits.  Even more dramatic were results in mixed\
    \ network\n   environments where all traffic shared the same LAN/router\n   connections,\
    \ and, when both IP and ST traffic was sent, the ST\n   traffic maintained its\
    \ quality while the IP traffic saw increasing\n   variation in performance.\n\
    \   Clearly, using a connection-oriented, origin-oriented reservation\n   protocol\
    \ to provide consistent end-to-end guaranteed QoS and\n   bandwidth in mixed ATM/internet\
    \ environments is not only feasible, it\n   results in dramatic performance and\
    \ quality improvements for\n   transmission of realtime traffic.\n"

    \  However, with their\n   connection-oriented and origin controlled natures,\

    \ of this is\n   beyond the scope of this document.\n"
