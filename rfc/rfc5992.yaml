- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Cyrillic is one of a fairly small number of scripts that\
    \ are used,\n   with different subsets of characters, to write a large number\
    \ of\n   languages, some of which are not closely related to the others.  When\n\
    \   those languages might be used together in a zone (typical of generic\n   TLDs\
    \ (gTLDs) but likely in other zones both at and below the root),\n   special considerations\
    \ for intermixing characters may apply.\n   Cyrillic also has the property that,\
    \ while it is usually considered a\n   separate script from the Latin (Roman)\
    \ and Greek ones, it shares many\n   characters with them, creating opportunities\
    \ for visual confusion.\n   Those difficulties are especially pronounced when\
    \ \"all of Cyrillic\"\n   is used rather than only the characters associated with\
    \ a particular\n   language.\n   This specification provides guidelines for the\
    \ use of Cyrillic, as\n   encoded in Unicode [Unicode52] with internationalized\
    \ domain name\n   (IDN) labels derived from most \"European\" languages that use\
    \ the\n   script (use of the term \"European\" is a convenience, since there is\n\
    \   disagreement about the relevant boundaries for different purposes\n   and,\
    \ of course, much of Russia lies within geological Asia).\n   Specifically, it\
    \ covers (in alphabetic order) Bosnian, Bulgarian,\n   Byelorussian, the Kildin\
    \ member of the Sami (often written \"Saami\")\n   language family, Macedonian,\
    \ Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, and\n   Ukrainian.  Supplemental tables, based\
    \ on information in the Unicode\n   Standard and a recently completed Montenegrin\
    \ government standard\n   [MontenegrinChars] are provided for use with Montenegrin.\
    \  Moldovan\n   is no longer in official use with Cyrillic script: no registrations\n\
    \   are considered likely in Cyrillic, at least within the relevant\n   ccTLD,\
    \ and it is not further discussed in this document.  Languages\n   of Asia that\
    \ use Cyrillic are not considered here and should be the\n   subject of separate\
    \ specifications.\n   While Cyrillic script is the primary one used for many of\
    \ the\n   relevant languages and countries, Latin script is often used instead\n\
    \   of, or in combination with, it.  Standard keyboards used in most of\n   the\
    \ countries have both Cyrillic and Latin characters.  Therefore,\n   some registries\
    \ could use Latin scripts for domain name registration\n   in their zones.  From\
    \ time to time, some registries and users have\n   claimed that there is a requirement\
    \ for mixing Cyrillic and Latin\n   characters in the same label.  We strongly\
    \ recommend against such\n   mixing as user confusion is almost certain to result.\
    \  In addition,\n   registries that support many scripts will probably encounter\
    \ the need\n   to support labels in Greek or Latin scripts as well as Cyrillic,\
    \ and\n   a large number of character forms are shared among those three\n   scripts.\n\
    \   Because the DNS has no way for the end user to distinguish among the\n   languages\
    \ that might have been used to inspire a particular label, it\n   seems useful\
    \ to treat the characters of a large number of languages\n   that use Cyrillic\
    \ in their writing systems together, rather than\n   trying to differentiate them.\
    \  The discussion and tables in this\n   specification should provide a foundation\
    \ for developing more\n   restrictive rules for zones in which only a single language\
    \ is likely\n   to be used, but it does not specify those language-specific rules.\n\
    \   Readers of this document should be aware that its recommendations are\n  \
    \ about use in DNS labels.  The orthography for some of the languages\n   involved,\
    \ especially Kildin Sami, is not completely standardized and\n   local usage sometimes\
    \ permits substitution of Latin-based characters\n   for their Cyrillic equivalents.\
    \  Unless they are required by official\n   orthographies, those substitutions\
    \ should generally be avoided in DNS\n   labels because of the risk of additional\
    \ user confusion with the\n   Latin characters that are visually similar.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Similar Characters and Variants
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Similar Characters and Variants\n   For some human languages, there are\
    \ characters and/or strings that\n   have equivalent or near-equivalent meanings.\
    \  If someone is allowed\n   to register a name with such a character or string,\
    \ the registry\n   might want to automatically register all the names that have\
    \ the same\n   meaning in that language.  Further, some registries might want\
    \ to\n   restrict the set of characters to be registered for language-based\n\
    \   reasons.\n   So-called \"variant techniques\", introduced in the JET specification\n\
    \   for the CJK script [RFC3743] and its generalization [RFC4290],\n   describe\
    \ ways of registering IDNs to decrease the risk of\n   misunderstandings, cybersquatting,\
    \ and other forms of confusion.\n   The tables below (Appendix A) identify confusable\
    \ characters in Latin\n   and Greek scripts that might be easily confused with\
    \ Cyrillic ones.\n   As with variant approaches for other scripts (e.g., see RFC\
    \ 4713\n   [RFC4713] for the Chinese language or RFC 5564 [RFC5564] for the\n\
    \   Arabic language), this document identifies sets of characters that\n   need\
    \ special consideration and provides information about them.  A\n   registry that\
    \ handles names using these characters can then make a\n   policy decision about\
    \ how to actually handle them.  The options for\n   those policy decisions would\
    \ include automatically registering all\n   look-alike strings to the same registrant,\
    \ registering one such\n   string and blocking the others, and so on.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The terminology that follows is derived from the JET specification\n\
    \   for the CJK script [RFC3743] and its generalization [RFC4290], but\n   this\
    \ specification does not depend on them.  All characters listed\n   here have\
    \ been verified to be \"PVALID\" under the IDNA2008\n   specification [RFC5890]\
    \ [RFC5892].\n   A \"string\" is a sequence of one or more characters.\n   This\
    \ document discusses characters that have equivalent or near-\n   equivalent characters\
    \ or strings.  The \"base character\" is the\n   character that has one or more\
    \ equivalents; the \"variant(s)\" are the\n   character(s) and/or string(s) that\
    \ are equivalent to the base\n   character.\n   A \"registration bundle\" is the\
    \ set of all labels that comes from\n   expanding all base characters for a single\
    \ name into their variants.\n   A registry is the administrative authority for\
    \ a DNS zone.  That is,\n   the registry is the body that makes and enforces policies\
    \ that are\n   used in a particular zone in the DNS.  The term \"registry\" applies\
    \ to\n   all zones in the DNS, not only those that exist at the top level.\n"
- title: 2.  Languages and Characters
  contents:
  - "2.  Languages and Characters\n   In the interest of clarity and balance, this\
    \ document describes a\n   \"Base Cyrillic\" set of 23 characters for use in comparing\
    \ the\n   character usage for Russian and Central European languages that use\n\
    \   Cyrillic.  The balance of this section compares the character usage\n   of\
    \ the individual languages in that group.\n   \"Base Cyrillic\" consists of the\
    \ following Unicode code points (names\n   associated with these code points and\
    \ those below appear in\n   Appendix A): U+0430, U+0431, U+0432, U+0433, U+0434,\
    \ U+0435, U+0436,\n   U+0437, U+043A, U+043B, U+043C, U+043D, U+043E, U+043F,\

    \   In addition, modern writing systems that use Cyrillic do not have\n   digits\
    \ separate from the \"European\" ones used with Latin characters.\n   For registries\
    \ that permit digits to appear in domain name labels,\n   the \"Base Cyrillic\"\
    \ code point listed above should be considered to\n   include U+0030, U+0031,\
    \ U+0032, U+0033, U+0034, U+0035, U+0036,\n   U+0037, U+0038, and U+0039 (Digit\
    \ Zero, and Digit One through Digit\n   Nine).  The Hyphen-Minus character (U+002D)\
    \ may also be used.\n   It is worth noting that the EU top-level domain registry\
    \ allows\n   Cyrillic registrations using 32 code points [EU-registry].  That\
    \ list\n   is sufficient for some of the languages listed here but not for\n \
    \  others.\n   The individual languages that are the focus of this specification\
    \ are\n   discussed below (in English alphabetical order).\n"

- title: 2.4.  Kildin Sami
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Kildin Sami\n   The phonetics of the Kildin Sami are quite complex and\
    \ not easily\n   represented in Cyrillic (see, e.g., Kertom's work [Kert]).  The\n\
    \   orthography is not standardized and the writing system may best be\n   thought\
    \ of as an attempt to transcribe the language phonetically\n   (primary in Latin\
    \ script in the 1930s but in Cyrillic more recently).\n   Different scholars have\
    \ reported different numbers of phonemes,\n   further complicating the transcription\
    \ process.  Kertom identifies 53\n   consonants with long-short distinctions and,\
    \ in many cases, hard-soft\n   ones.  He also identifies ascending and descending\
    \ diphthongs and one\n   triphthong as well as more common short and long vowels.\n\
    \   The primary reference for Kildin Sami, widely circulated for some\n   time\
    \ but only in draft, is apparently used by Sami language(s)\n   experts in Scandinavian\
    \ countries [Riessl07].  It, and the references\n   it cites, uses 56 characters,\
    \ 33 of which do not appear in the basic\n   set.  Eight* of these characters\
    \ have no precomposed forms in Unicode\n   and hence must be written as a sequence\
    \ of two code points with the\n   second one being COMBINING MACRON (U+0304).\
    \  Using parentheses to\n   make the two-code-point sequences more obvious, the\
    \ additional\n   characters are: (U+0430 U+0304)*, (U+0435 U+0304)*, U+0438, U+0439,\n\
    \   (U+043E U+0304), U+044A, U+044B, (U+044B U+0304), U+044C, U+044D,\n   (U+044D\
    \ U+0304), U+044E, (U+044E U+0304), U+044F, (U+044F U+0304),\n   U+0451, (U+0451\
    \ U+0304), U+0458, U+048B, U+048D, U+048F, U+04BB,\n   U+04C6, U+04C8, U+04CA,\
    \ U+04CE, U+04D3, U+04E3, U+04E7, U+04ED,\n   U+04EF, U+04F1, U+04F9.\n   *  These\
    \ characters, CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A (U+0430) with a\n      COMBINING MACRON\
    \ (U+0304) and CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE (U+0435)\n      with a COMBINING MACRON\
    \ (U+0304), respectively, have the same\n      visual appearance as LATIN SMALL\
    \ LETTER A WITH MACRON (U+0101) and\n      LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH MACRON (U+0113).\
    \  There are no known\n      keyboards designed specifically for Kildin Sami.\
    \  If an extended\n      Latin-based keyboard and associated software are used,\
    \ these\n      characters might appear with the code point based on Latin (e.g.,\n\
    \      U+0113 for the second case).  By contrast, keyboards and input\n      software\
    \ that are designed to be more Cyrillic-friendly are more\n      likely to produce\
    \ code points for the Cyrillic base characters.\n      The use of a Latin character\
    \ base for that second case occurs in\n      some Western European sources including\
    \ Riessler's work\n      [Riessl07].  While we have not found explicit substitutions\
    \ for A\n      with Macron, we believe they might be found in practice.  These\n\
    \      alternatives are not mapped together by Unicode Normalization Form\n  \
    \    C (NFC) (or Normalization Form KC (NFKC)), so registries, and\n      possibly\
    \ applications software, should exercise some care about\n      these coding variations.\
    \  However, U+0101 and U+0113 are Latin\n      Script characters so, if either\
    \ is used, any tests on homogeneity\n      of the script within a label need to\
    \ be made with care.\n      Similar issues may apply to other Kildin Sami characters\n\
    \      constructed with combining sequences.\n   The key references in Russian\
    \ ([Anto90], [Kert86], [Kuru85]) all\n   propose slightly different character\
    \ tables relative to each other\n   and to Riessler's list.  Because the latter\
    \ list appears to be more\n   comprehensive and to represent more recent scholarship,\
    \ we have based\n   the tables in this document on it.  We recommend, however,\
    \ that\n   registries review these recommendations and the relevant papers\n \
    \  should registration requests for Kildin Sami actually appear.\n   Additional\
    \ perspectives on Kildin Sami can be found on the Omniglot\n   Sami pages [OmniglotSaami].\n"

  - "6.  Steps after Registering an Input Label\n   A registry has at least three\
    \ policy options for handling the cases\n   where the registration bundle has\
    \ more than one label.  These\n   options, and their key implications, are:\n\
    \   o  Allocate all labels to the same registrant, making the zone\n      information\
    \ identical to that of the input label.\n      This option will cause end users\
    \ to be able to find names with\n      variants more easily, but will result in\
    \ larger zone files.  In\n      principle, the zone file could become so large\
    \ that it could\n      negatively affect the ability of the registry to perform\
    \ name\n      resolution.\n   o  Block all labels so they cannot be registered\
    \ in the future.\n      This option does not increase the size of the zone file,\
    \ but it\n      may cause end users to not be able to find names with variants\n\
    \      that they would expect.\n   o  Allocate some labels and block some other\
    \ labels.\n      This option is likely to cause the most confusion with users\n\
    \      because including some variants will cause a name to be found, but\n  \
    \    using other variants will cause the name to be not found.\n   With any of\
    \ these three options, the registry MUST keep a database\n   that links each label\
    \ in the registration bundle to the input label.\n   This link needs to be maintained\
    \ so that changes in the non-DNS\n   registration information (such as the label's\
    \ owner name and address)\n   are reflected in every member of the registration\
    \ bundle as well.\n"
