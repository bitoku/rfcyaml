  - "2.0  Introduction\n   The Media Gateway Control Protocol or MGCP [36] is used\
    \ to control\n   voice media gateways from external call control elements.  Even\n\
    \   though the bearer network might be IP, ATM, TDM or a mix of these,\n   MGCP\
    \ is transported over IP.  Packages such as the MGCP CAS packages\n   [38] are\
    \ modular sets of parameters such as connection options,\n   signal, event and\
    \ statistics definitions that can be used to extend\n   it into specific contexts.\
    \  A related,  IP-based mechanism for the\n   description of ATM connections [18]\
    \ has been generated by the IETF\n   MMUSIC group.  Due to the IP-centric nature\
    \ of all aspects of the\n   MGCP device control protocol, and for consistency\
    \ with other MGCP\n   package definitions, it is desirable to publish the MGCP\
    \ ATM package\n   in an IETF document.\n   MGCP [36] allows the auditing of endpoints\
    \ for package versions\n   supported.  The package version for the MGCP ATM package,\
    \ as\n   specified in this document, is 0.  Even if the ATM package is the\n \
    \  default package for some endpoints, the package prefix \"atm\" shall\n   not\
    \ be omitted in local connection option names, event names, signal\n   names etc.\
    \  If the ATM package is the default package for an\n   endpoint, it will be listed\
    \ as the first package in the audit\n   response list.  It is not necessary for\
    \ the MGCP ATM package to be\n   the default package for ATM to be supported on\
    \ an endpoint.\n   The ATM package in this document consists of Local Connection\
    \ Options\n   (Section 3.0), Events and Signals (Section 4.0) and ATM Statistics\n\
    \   Parameters (Section 5.0).  Section 6.1 has guidelines for consistency\n  \
    \ in the use of Local Connection Options.  Section 6.2 describes codec\n   and\
    \ profile negotiation.  Section 7.0 addresses security\n   considerations.\n \
    \  In the ATM networks addressed in this document, services are carried\n   directly\
    \ over ATM without an intervening IP layer.  The Local\n   Connection Options,\
    \ Events, Signals and Statistics Parameters\n   described in this section are\
    \ not needed for VoIP calls which can be\n   carried, in whole or in part, over\
    \ an ATM network.  In that case, the\n   constructs defined elsewhere for IP are\
    \ sufficient.\n   The ATM local connection option names, event names and signal\
    \ names\n   MUST always have an \"atm\" package prefix.  Backward compatibility\n\
    \   with older implementations that use X-atm as the package name is\n   desirable.\n\
    \   MGCP grammar [36] must be followed with regard to the use of white\n   spaces.\
    \  The examples in this document attempt to follow MGCP grammar\n   in this and\
    \ all other respects.\n"
- title: 3.0  Local Connection Options
  contents:
  - "3.0  Local Connection Options\n   The Local Connection Options (LCOs) defined\
    \ in this section are\n   specific to ATM applications.  Like other LCOs, these\
    \ can be used in\n   commands to create connections, modify connections and audit\n\
    \   connections.  However, unless noted otherwise below, they are not to\n   be\
    \ returned when an endpoint is audited for capabilities.\n   ATM Local Connection\
    \ Options are divided into the following\n   categories: ATM bearer connection,\
    \ ATM adaptation layer, service\n   layer, ATM bearer traffic management and AAL\
    \ dimensioning.\n   When parameter values are represented in decimal format, leading\n\
    \   zeros are omitted.\n"

    \   Connection type (ct): This parameter describes the ATM adaptation\n   layer.\
    \  The values that can be assigned to it are: AAL1, AAL1_SDT,\n   AAL1_UDT, AAL2,\
    \ AAL3/4, AAL5 and USER_DEFINED_AAL.  The user defined\n   adaptation layer is\
    \ per amendment 2 of ITU-T Q.2931.\n   Type of Bearer/VC (vc): This indicates\
    \ whether a PVC, CID or an SVC\n   is to be used for an ATM connection.  Possible\
    \ values are: PVC, SVC\n   or CID.  Omitting this parameter will result in the\
    \ use of a default,\n   which could be embedded or provisioned.  The value \"\
    PVC\" covers both\n   classical PVCs and SPVCs.  The value \"CID\"  covers subchannels\
    \ within\n   AAL1 [35] and AAL2 [10] virtual circuits.  A value of \"SVC\" for\n\
    \   atm/vc does not necessarily imply that the addressed media gateway\n   should\
    \ initiate signaling for bearer set-up, since this might be done\n   by another\
    \ node such as the far-end media gateway.\n   Enable path set-up (se): This local\
    \ connection option is used to\n   explicitly enable or disable the use of bearer\
    \ signaling for path\n   set-up.  Permitted values of this local connection option\
    \ are  \"on\"\n   and \"off\".  Examples of bearer signaling are SVC signaling,\
    \ ITU\n   Q.2630.1 signaling and combinations thereof.  Examples of such\n   combinations\
    \ are the set-up of an AAL2 SVC and the assignment of a\n   CID within it or the\
    \ set-up of a concatenation of an AAL2 single-CID\n   SVC and a CID channel within\
    \ a multiplexed AAL2 VC.  This parameter\n   can be used with both the backward\
    \ and forward bearer connection\n   set-up methods.  In the former case, the call-terminating\
    \ gateway\n   sets up the bearer connection.  In the latter case, the call-\n\
    \   originating gateway sets up the bearer connection.\n   This option may or\
    \ may not be used in conjunction with atm/sc event\n   notification.  When this\
    \ option and the atm/sc event notification are\n   omitted, creating and modifying\
    \ connection commands, the call agent\n   is deferring any relevant decision to\
    \ set up an ATM or AAL2\n   connection to the media gateways.  In the absence\
    \ of this parameter,\n   a media gateway's autonomous decision to set up an ATM\
    \ or AAL2 path\n   via bearer signaling depends on default/provisioned behaviors,\
    \ such\n   as the applicability and nature (backward/forward) of a bearer\n  \
    \ connection set-up model, the network type ('nt'), connection type\n   ('atm/ct')\
    \ and bearer type/VC ('atm/vc') local connection options,\n   and the media gateway's\
    \ awareness of whether it is the originating\n   gateway or terminating gateway\
    \ in a call.  This awareness may be\n   based on the presence or absence of an\
    \ SDP remote connection\n   descriptor in the initial create connection command.\n\
    \   Connection Element Identifier (ci): This indicates the Virtual\n   Circuit\
    \ or CID to be used for the bearer connection.  It is used when\n   the call agent\
    \ manages VC and/or CID resources in the bearer network.\n   The ci parameter\
    \ can be in one of the following formats:\n      * VCCI-<vcci>\n      * VCCI-<vcci>/CID-<cid>\n\
    \      * <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci>\n      * <ATMaddress>/VCCI-<vcci>\n\

    \   The CID, or Channel ID, can refer to AAL1 as well as AAL2\n   applications.\
    \  In AAL1 applications based on [35], it refers to the\n   octet position, starting\
    \ from one, within an n x 64 SDT frame.\n   The VPCI is a 16 bit field defined\
    \ in Section 4.5.16 of ITU Q.2931.\n   The VPCI is similar to the VPI, except\
    \ for its width and the fact\n   that it retains its value across VP crossconnects.\n\
    \   The VCCI is a 16 bit field defined in ITU Recommendation Q.2941.2\n   [14].\
    \  The VCCI is similar to the VCI, except for the fact that it\n   retains its\
    \ value across VC crossconnects.\n   In general, <vpci> and <vcci> values are\
    \ unique between a pair of\n   nodes.  When they are unique between a pair of\
    \ nodes, but not unique\n   within a network, they need to be qualified at any\
    \ node, by the ATM\n   address of the remote node.  These parameters can be pre-provisioned\n\
    \   or signaled via SVC signaling messages.  When VPCI and VCCI values\n   are\
    \ pre-provisioned, administrations have the option of provisioning\n   them uniquely\
    \ in a network.  In this case, the ATM address of the far\n   end is not needed\
    \ to qualify these parameters.\n   The <portId> parameter is used to identify\
    \ the physical trunk port on\n   an ATM module.  It can be represented as a decimal\
    \ or hex number of\n   up to 32 digits.\n   In some applications, it is meaningful\
    \ to bundle a set of connections\n   between a pair of ATM nodes into a bearer\
    \ connection group.  The\n   <bcg> subparameter is an eight bit field that allows\
    \ the bundling of\n   up to 255 VPCs or VCCs.\n   In some applications, it is\
    \ necessary to wildcard some elements of\n   the ci local connection option. \
    \ The \"$\" wildcard character can be\n   substituted for some of the terms of\
    \ this parameter.  While\n   wildcarding, the constant strings that qualify the\
    \ terms in the ci\n   parameter are retained.  The concatenation <ATMaddressType>-\n\
    \   <ATMaddress> can be wildcarded in the following ways:\n      *  The entire\
    \ concatenation, <ATMaddressType>-<ATMaddress>, is\n         replaced with a \"\
    $\".\n      *  <ATMaddress> is replaced with a \"$\", but <ATMaddressType> is\n\
    \         not.\n   Examples of wildcarding the ci parameter in the AAL1 and AAL5\n\
    \   contexts are: VCCI-$, BCG-100/VPI-20/VCI-$.\n   Examples of wildcarding the\
    \ ci parameter in the AAL2 context are:\n   VCCI- 40/CID-$, BCG-100/VPI-20/VCI-120/CID-$.\n\
    \   If the addressType is NSAP, the address is expressed in the standard\n   dotted\
    \ hex form.  This is a string of 40 hex digits, with dots after\n   the 2nd, 6th,\
    \ 10th, 14th, 18th, 22nd, 26th, 30th, 34th and 38th\n   digits.  The \"0x\" prefix\
    \ is not used, since this is always\n   represented in hex.  The last octet of\
    \ the NSAP address is the\n   'selector' field that is available for non-standard\
    \ use.  For\n   example:\n  L: atm/ci:NSAP-47.0091.8100.0000.0060.3e64.fd01.0060.3e64.fd01.00/\n\
    \            VCCI-65\n   If the ATMaddressType is E164, the ATMaddress is expressed\
    \ as a\n   decimal number with up to 15 digits.  For example:\n      L: atm/ci:E164-9738294382/VCCI-100\n\
    \   The E.164 numbers used can be in the International Format E.164 or\n   conform\
    \ to a private numbering plan.\n   If the ATMaddressType is GWID, it means that\
    \ the address is a Gateway\n   Identifier or Node Alias.  This may or may not\
    \ be globally unique.\n   In this format, the ATMaddress is expressed as an alphanumeric\
    \ string\n   (\"A\"-\"Z\", \"a\"-\"z\", \"0\" - \"9\",\".\",\"-\",\"_\").  For\
    \ example:\n       L: atm/ci:GWID-officeABCmgx101vism12\n   The keyword \"ALIAS\"\
    \ can be substituted for \"GWID\".  For example:\n       L: atm/ci:ALIAS-officeABCmgx101vism12\n\
    \   An example of a GWID (ALIAS) is the CLLI code used for telecom\n   equipment.\
    \  For all practical purposes, it should be adequate for the\n   GWID (ALIAS)\
    \ to be a variable length string with a maximum size of 32\n   characters.\n \
    \  When an endpoint supporting the ATM package is audited for\n   capabilities,\
    \ the following local connection options from Section 3.1\n   shall be returned:\
    \ connection type (atm/ct) and VC/bearer type\n   (atm/vc).  If more than one\
    \ value is supported, these shall be\n   expressed as a list of semicolon-separated\
    \ values.  Although this is\n   not very useful, it is permissible for these values\
    \ to have\n   overlapping semantics (e.g., AAL1 and AAL1_SDT).  An example of\n\
    \   returning, in audit response, the local connection options defined in\n  \
    \ Section 3.1 is:\n      A: atm/ct:AAL1_SDT;AAL2, atm/vc:PVC;CID\n"

    \   Partial Fill Count (pf): When present, the 'pf' parameter is used to\n   indicate\
    \ the fill level of cells.  When this local connection option\n   is absent, then\
    \ other means (such as provisionable defaults) are used\n   to determine the presence\
    \ and level of partial fill.\n   This parameter indicates the number of non-pad\
    \ payload octets, not\n   including any AAL SAR or convergence sublayer octets.\
    \  For example,\n   in some AAL1 applications that use partially filled cells\
    \ with\n   padding at the end, this attribute indicates the number of leading\n\
    \   payload octets not including any AAL overhead.\n   In general, permitted values\
    \ of the pf parameter are integers in the\n   range 1 - 48 inclusive.  However,\
    \ this upper bound is different for\n   different adaptations since the AAL overhead,\
    \ if any, is different.\n   If a specified partial fill (e.g. 47) is greater than\
    \ or equal to the\n   maximum fill (in this example, 46 for AAL1 P-cells), then\
    \ complete\n   fill (46 in this example) is used.  Using a 'partial' fill of 48\n\
    \   effectively disables partial fill. Values below or above the\n   permissible\
    \ range of 1-48 MUST be rejected with an error code of 532\n   {Unsupported value(s)\
    \ in LocalConnectionOptions}.\n   In the AAL1 context, this parameter applies\
    \ uniformly to both P and\n   non-P cells.  In AAL1 applications that do not distinguish\
    \ between P\n   and non-P cells, a value of 47 indicates complete fill (i.e.,\
    \ the\n   absence of partial fill).  In AAL1 applications that distinguish\n \
    \  between P and non-P cells, a value of 46 indicates no padding in\n   P-cells\
    \ and a padding of one in non-P cells.\n   If partial fill is enabled (i.e., there\
    \ is padding in at least some\n   cells), then AAL1 structures must not be split\
    \ across cell\n   boundaries.  These shall fit in any cell.  Hence, their size\
    \ shall be\n   less than or equal to the partial fill size.  Further, the partial\n\
    \   fill size is preferably an integer multiple of the structure size.\n   If\
    \ it is not, then the partial fill size stated in the local\n   connection options\
    \ shall be truncated to an integer multiple of the\n   structure size (e.g., a\
    \ partial fill size of 40 is truncated to 36 to\n   support six 6 x 64 channels).\n\
    \   Clock recovery type (crt): This is used in AAL1 UDT (unstructured\n   data\
    \ transfer) applications only.  It can be assigned the values:\n   \"NULL\", \"\
    SRTS\", or \"ADAPTIVE\".  A value of \"NULL\" is equivalent to\n   omitting this\
    \ parameter and implies that the stream (T1 or E1)\n   encapsulated in ATM is\
    \ either synchronous to the ATM network or is\n   re-timed, before AAL1 encapsulation,\
    \ via slip buffers.  The default\n   value used in the absence of this LCO can\
    \ be hardcoded or\n   provisioned.\n   Forward Error Correction Enable (fe): This\
    \ indicates whether FEC, as\n   defined in ITU I.363.1 [1], is enabled or not.\
    \  Possible values are:\n   \"NULL\", \"DELAY_SENSITIVE\" and \"LOSS_SENSITIVE\"\
    .  FEC can be enabled\n   differently for delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive connections.\
    \  A\n   \"NULL\" value implies disabling FEC for an AAL1 connection.\n   TABLE\

    \   Profile List (pfl): This is a list of profiles.  Profile types are\n   followed\
    \ by profile numbers for each type.  The ordering of profiles\n   can imply preference,\
    \ with the most preferred profile first.  There\n   can be multiple instances\
    \ of the same profile type in this list.\n   Spaces are used as delimiters within\
    \ this list.  Therefore, to comply\n   with MGCP syntax [36], it is necessary\
    \ to enclose this list in double\n   quotes.\n   The format of the pfl parameter\
    \ is as follows:\n   \"<profileType#1><format list#1><profileType#2><format list#2>\
    \ ...\n   <profileType #M><format list#M>\"\n   where <format list#i> has the\
    \ form <profile#i_1>...<profile#i_N>\n   The <profileType> parameter indicates\
    \ the type of profile.  It is\n   expressed in the format AAL2/<profileClass>\
    \ where <profileClass>\n   identifies the source of the definition of the profile.\n\
    \   The <profileClass> can be assigned a string value indicating the\n   source\
    \ of the subsequent profile numbers until the next <profileType>\n   field.  The\
    \ following rules apply to the contents of the\n   <profileClass> field:\n   \
    \   -  <profileClass> = \"ITU\" indicates profiles defined by ITU.\n         Examples:\
    \ profiles defined in the I.366.2 specification [2].\n      -  <profileClass>\
    \ = \"ATMF\"  indicates profiles defined by ATM\n         forum.  Examples: profiles\
    \ defined in af-vtoa-0113 [3] or af-\n         vmoa-0145.000 [21].\n      -  <profileClass>\
    \ = \"custom\"  indicates profiles defined by a\n         corporation or a multi-vendor\
    \ agreement.  Since there is no\n         standard administration of this convention,\
    \ care should be\n         taken to preclude inconsistencies within the scope\
    \ of a\n         deployment.\n      - <profileClass> = <corporateName>\n     \
    \    An equipment vendor or service provider can use its registered,\n       \
    \  globally unique corporate name (e.g., Cisco, Telcordia etc.) as\n         a\
    \ string value of the <profileClass>.  It is suggested that\n         organizations\
    \ maintain consistent definitions of the advertised\n         AAL2 profiles that\
    \ bear their corporate name.\n      -  The <profileClass> can be based on IEEE\
    \ Standard 802-1990,\n         Section 5.1, which defines the globally unique,\
    \ IEEE-\n         administered, three-octet OUIs used in MAC addresses and\n \
    \        protocol identifiers.  In this case, the <profileClass> field\n     \
    \    shall be assigned a string value of \"IEEE:\" concatenated with\n       \
    \  <oui> where <oui> is the hex representation of a three-octet\n         field\
    \ identical to the IEEE OUI.  Since this is always\n         represented in hex,\
    \ the \"0x\" prefix is not used.  Leading zeros\n         may be omitted.  For\

    \   Voice codec selection (vsel): This is a prioritized list of one or\n   more\
    \ 3-tuples describing voice service.  Each vsel 3-tuple indicates\n   a codec,\
    \ an optional packet length and an optional packetization\n   period.\n   The\
    \ vsel local connection option is structured as follows:\n      \"<encodingName\
    \ #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1>\n      <encodingName #2> <packetLength\
    \ #2><packetTime #2>\n         ...\n      <encodingName #N> <packetLength #N><packetTime\
    \ #N>\"\n   where the <encodingName> refers to a codec name such as PCMU, G726-\n\
    \   32, G729 etc.  See [18] and [34] for a list of codecs with static\n   payload\
    \ types.  The <packetLength> is a decimal integer\n   representation of the packet\
    \ length in octets.  The <packetTime> is a\n   decimal integer representation\
    \ of the packetization interval in\n   microseconds.\n   Voiceband data codec\
    \ selection (dsel): This is a prioritized list of\n   one or more 3-tuples describing\
    \ voiceband data passthrough service.\n   Each dsel 3-tuple indicates a codec,\
    \ an optional packet length and an\n   optional packetization period.  Depending\
    \ on the application, the\n   dsel local connection option may or may not cover\
    \ facsimile service.\n   This is indicated via an <fxIncl> flag preceding the\
    \ list of 3-\n   tuples.  This flag indicates whether the dsel list explicitly\n\
    \   addresses facsimile (\"on\" value) or not (\"off\" value).  This flag can\n\
    \   also be set to \"-\", which is equivalent to setting it to \"off\".\n   If\
    \ <fxIncl> is \"on\", then it is rarely useful to also include an fsel\n   option.\
    \  However, it is syntactically correct to do so as long as the\n   dsel and fsel\
    \ options include an identical set of 3-tuples, perhaps\n   in a different order.\n\
    \   If <fxIncl> is \"off\", then any fsel list may still be ignored if the\n \
    \  media gateway does not provide separate treatment of voiceband data\n   passthrough\
    \ and fax.  Since, in this case, there is no distinct\n   facsimile service from\
    \ the media gateway's perspective, any fsel list\n   does not apply.\n   The dsel\
    \ local connection option is structured as follows:\n      \"<fxIncl> <encodingName\
    \ #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1>\n               <encodingName #2> <packetLength\
    \ #2><packetTime #2>\n               ...\n               <encodingName #N> <packetLength\
    \ #N><packetTime #N>\"\n   where the <encodingName> refers to a codec name such\
    \ as PCMU, G726-\n   32, G729 etc.  The <packetLength> is a decimal integer representation\n\
    \   of the packet length in octets.  The <packetTime> is a decimal\n   integer\
    \ representation of the packetization interval in microseconds.\n   Facsimile\
    \ codec selection (fsel): This is a prioritized list of one\n   or more 3-tuples\
    \ describing fax service.  Each fsel 3-tuple indicates\n   a codec, an optional\
    \ packet length and an optional packetization\n   period.  If the dsel option\
    \ includes facsimile, the fsel connection\n   option should be consistent with\
    \ it.  Each fsel 3-tuple indicates a\n   codec, an optional packet length and\
    \ an optional packetization\n   period.  The fsel local connection option is structured\
    \ as follows:\n         \"<encodingName #1> <packetLength #1><packetTime #1>\n\
    \         <encodingName #2> <packetLength #2><packetTime #2>\n         ...\n \
    \        <encodingName #N> <packetLength #N><packetTime #N>\"\n   where the <encodingName>\
    \ refers to a codec name such as PCMU, G726-\n   32, G729 etc.  The <packetLength>\
    \ is a decimal integer representation\n   of the packet length in octets.  The\
    \ <packetTime> is a decimal\n   integer representation of the packetization interval\
    \ in microseconds.\n   Since spaces are used as delimiters within the vsel, dsel\
    \ and fsel\n   lists, it is necessary to enclose these lists in double quotes\
    \ [36].\n   The vsel, fsel and dsel parameters complement the rest of the local\n\
    \   connection options and should be consistent with them.\n   Examples of the\
    \ use of these parameters are:\n      L: atm/vsel:\"G729 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000\"\
    \n      L: atm/dsel:\"off PCMA 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000\"\n      L: atm/fsel:\"\
    PCMU 40 5000 G726-32 20 5000\"\n      L: atm/vsel:\"G729 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000\"\
    \n      L: atm/dsel:\"on  PCMA 10 10000 G726-32 40 10000\"\n   The <packetLength>and\
    \ <packetTime> can be set to \"-\" when not needed.\n   A <fxIncl> value of \"\
    -\" is equivalent to setting it to \"off\".  For\n   example:\n      L: atm/vsel:\"\
    G729 - - G726-32 - -\"\n      L: atm/dsel:\"- G729 - - G726-32 - -\"\n      L:\
    \ atm/fsel:\"G729-24 - -\"\n   The vsel, dsel and fsel local connection options\
    \ can be used in the\n   AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5 contexts.  The <packetLength> and\
    \ <packetTime>\n   are not meaningful in the AAL1 case and should be set to \"\
    -\".  In the\n   AAL2 case, these local connection options indicate the preferred\
    \ use\n   of some or all of the rows in a given profile table.  If multiple 3-\n\
    \   tuples are present, they can indicate a preferentially ordered\n   assignment\
    \ of some rows in that profile to voice, voiceband data\n   passthrough or facsimile\
    \ service (e.g., row A preferred to row B\n   etc).  If multiple profiles are\
    \ specified in the pfl parameter\n   (described in section 3.2), the profile qualified\
    \ by these local\n   connection options is the first profile in the list.\n  \
    \ Codec configuration (ccnf): This is used to convey the contents of\n   the single\
    \ codec information element (IE) defined in [30].  The\n   contents of this IE\
    \ are: a single-octet Organizational Identifier\n   (OID) field, followed by a\
    \ single-octet Codec Type field, followed by\n   zero or more octets of a codec\
    \ configuration bit-map.  The semantics\n   of the codec configuration bit-map\
    \ are specific to the\n   organization[30, 31].  Since this bit-map is always\
    \ represented in\n   hex format, the \"0x\" prefix is omitted.  Leading zeros\
    \ are not\n   omitted.  For example:\n      L: atm/ccnf:01080C\n   indicates an\
    \ Organizational Identifier of 0x01(the ITU-T).  Using\n   [57], the second octet\
    \ (0x08) indicates a codec type of G.726\n   (ADPCM).  The last octet, 0x0C indicates\
    \ that 16 kbps and 24 kbps\n   rates are NOT supported, while the 32 kbps and\
    \ 40 kbps rates ARE\n   supported.\n   ISUP User Information (usi): This is used\
    \ to convey the contents of\n   the 'User Information Layer 1 protocol' field\
    \ within the bearer\n   capability information element defined in Section 4.5.5\
    \ of [32], and\n   reiterated as the user service information element (IE) in\
    \ Section\n   3.57 of [33].  The 'User Information Layer 1 protocol' field consists\n\
    \   of the five least significant bits of Octet 5 of this information\n   element.\n\
    \   The usi LCO represented as a string of two hex digits.  The \"0x\"\n   prefix\
    \ is omitted since this value is always hexadecimal.  These hex\n   digits are\
    \ constructed from an octet with three leading '0' bits and\n   the last five\
    \ bits equal to the 'User Information Layer 1 protocol'\n   field described above.\
    \  Digits to the left are more significant than\n   digits to the right.  The\
    \ resulting values of the usi local\n   connection option are as follows:\n  \
    \    VALUE   MEANING\n      0x01    CCITT standardized rate adaption V.110 and\

    \   ATM QoS parameters, forward direction (aqf) and backward direction\n   (aqb):\

    \ are used in this list, it must be enclosed in double\n   quotes for MGCP compliance\
    \ [36].\n   The <cdvType> parameter can take on the string values of \"PP\" and\n\
    \   \"2P\".  These refer to the peak-to-peak and two-point CDV as defined\n  \
    \ in UNI 4.0 [6] and ITU Q.2965.2 [7] respectively.\n   The CDV parameters, <acdv>\
    \ and <ccdv>, refer to the acceptable and\n   cumulative CDVs respectively.  These\
    \ are expressed in units of\n   microseconds and represented as the decimal or\
    \ hex equivalent of 24-\n   bit fields.  These use the cell loss ratio, <aclr>,\
    \ as the \"alpha\"\n   quantiles defined in the ATMF TM 4.1 specification [8]\
    \ and in ITU\n   I.356 [9].\n   The transit delay parameters, <eetd> and <cmtd>,\
    \ refer to the end-to-\n   end and cumulative transit delays respectively in milliseconds.\n\
    \   These are represented as the decimal equivalents of 16-bit fields.\n   These\
    \ parameters are defined in Q.2965.2 [7], UNI 4.0 [8] and Q.2931\n   [29].\n \
    \  The <aclr> parameter refers to forward and backward acceptable cell\n   loss\
    \ ratios.  This is the ratio between the number of cells lost and\n   the number\
    \ of cells transmitted.  It is expressed as the decimal or\n   hex equivalent\
    \ of an 8-bit field.  This field expresses an order of\n   magnitude n, where\
    \ n is an integer in the range 1-15.  The Cell Loss\n   Ratio takes on the value\
    \ 10 raised to the power of minus n.\n   If any of these parameters is not specified,\

    \ forward direction CLP=0+1 (adf0+1), backward\n   direction CLP=0+1 (adb0+1),\
    \ forward direction CLP=0 (adf0), backward\n   direction CLP=0 (adb0): Here, forward\
    \ is the direction away from the\n   media gateway, backward is the direction\
    \ towards the gateway.  If the\n   directional convention used by bearer signaling\
    \ at the gateway is\n   different, then appropriate translations must be done\
    \ by the media\n   gateway.  The adf0+1, adb0+1, adf0 and adb0 local connection\

    \   Structured Data Transfer Block Size (str): This parameter is\n   meaningful\
    \ only when structured AAL1 is used.  It indicates the size\n   (in octets) of\
    \ the block used for structured data transfer.  If not\n   included as a local\
    \ connection option, the structure size is to be\n   known by other means.  For\
    \ instance, af-vtoa-78 [20] fixes the\n   structure size for n x 64 service, with\
    \ or without CAS.  The\n   L: atm/str parameter is coded as the decimal equivalent\
    \ of a 16-bit\n   field [29].  The theoretical maximum value of this parameter\
    \ is\n   65,535, although most services use much less.\n   CBR Rate (cbrRate):\
    \ This is a hexadecimal representation of the bit\n   map defined in Table 4-6\
    \ of ITU Q.2931 [29].  This is represented as\n   exactly two hex digits.  For\
    \ example:\n      L: atm/cbrRate:04\n   implies a CBR rate of 1.544 Mbps.\n  \
    \ Forward maximum CPCS-SDU size (fcpcs): This is the maximum size of\n   the AAL2\
    \ or AA5 CPCS SDU in the forward direction.\n   Backward maximum CPCS-SDU size\
    \ (bcpcs): This is the maximum size of\n   the AAL2 or AA5 CPCS SDU in the backward\
    \ direction.\n   Forward maximum AAL2 CPCS-SDU rate (fSDUrate): This is the maximum\n\
    \   rate of the AAL2 CPCS-SDUs in the forward direction.\n   Backward maximum\
    \ AAL2 CPCS-SDU rate (bSDUrate): This is the maximum\n   rate of the AAL2 CPCS-SDUs\
    \ in the backward direction.\n   The fSDUrate and bSDUrate local connection options\
    \ can be used to\n   rate-limit AAL2 CIDs, especially when used in the SSSAR [1]\
    \ and frame\n   mode [2] contexts.\n   Forward maximum frame mode block size (ffrm):\
    \ This is the maximum\n   size, in the forward direction, of the AAL2 frame mode\
    \ data unit\n   (I.366.2) [2].\n   Backward maximum frame mode block size (bfrm):\
    \ This is the maximum\n   size, in the backward direction, of the AAL2 frame mode\
    \ data unit\n   (I.366.2) [2].\n   Forward maximum SSSAR-SDU size (fsssar): This\
    \ is the maximum size, in\n   the forward direction, of the AAL2-based SSSAR-SDU\
    \ (I.366.1) [1].\n   Backward maximum SSSAR-SDU size (bsssar): This is the maximum\

  - "4.0 Signals and Events\n   Standard MGCP syntax and keywords [36] are used in\
    \ Table 11 to define\n   the events in this package.  Since these are all connection\
    \ events,\n   they cannot be requested for endpoints.  For consistency with MGCP\n\
    \   [36], it is required that the suffix @<connection-id> NOT be omitted\n   even\
    \ if there is only one connection to an endpoint.  This suffix can\n   also be\
    \ wildcarded per MGCP rules.\n   There are no auditable event-states associated\
    \ with the ATM package.\n   Set-up complete (\"sc\"):\n   Within the RequestedEvents\
    \ (R:) structure, \"sc\" is used to request\n   notification of successful ATM\
    \ or AAL2 connection set-up.  The ATM OR\n   AAL2 bearer path is ready for subscriber\
    \ payload carriage when this\n   notification is sent.\n   This could be the set-up\
    \ of an SVC, the assignment of an AAL2 CID\n   path and combinations thereof.\
    \  Examples of such combinations are the\n   set-up of an AAL2 SVC and the assignment\
    \ of a CID within it or the\n   set-up of a concatenation of an AAL2 single-CID\
    \ SVC and a CID channel\n   within a multiplexed AAL2 VC.\n   This event is included\
    \ for backward compatibility.  It is preferred\n   that the call agent and the\
    \ media gateway rely on provisional\n   acknowledgements in the case in which\
    \ connection set-up has a long\n   latency.  However, if this event is requested,\
    \ the media gateway must\n   issue notification of connection set-up via this\
    \ event.  In this\n   case, a provisional acknowledgement is not very useful,\
    \ and full\n   acknowledgement of the create connection or modify connection need\n\
    \   not be deferred until connection set up.\n   The designated trigger for an\
    \ ATM OR AAL2 connection set-up is an\n   \"on\" value of the L: atm/se local\
    \ connection option provided with a\n   create or modify connection command. \
    \ However, it is recognized that\n   certain applications use the presence of\
    \ an atm/sc event notification\n   to initiate the set-up of an ATM or AAL2 connection.\n\

    \ is cancelled through a subsequent\n   NotificationRequest command or when the\
    \ VoAAL2 connection is deleted.\n   Enable DTMF tones via type 3 packets (\"etd\"\
    ):\n   A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and\n\
    \   receives DTMF tones via type 3 packets.  This signal indicates that\n   the\
    \ media gateway is to forward and receive DTMF tones via type 3\n   packets on\
    \ an AAL2 connection.  This does not preclude the call agent\n   from requesting\
    \ notification of DTMF tones.\n   Enable MF tones via type 3 packets (\"etm\"\
    ):\n   A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and\n\
    \   receives MF tones via type 3 packets.  This signal indicates that the\n  \
    \ media gateway is to forward and receive MF tones via type 3 packets\n   on an\
    \ AAL2 connection.  This does not preclude the call agent from\n   requesting\
    \ notification of MF tones.  This signal request does not\n   specify the MF tone\
    \ type, which is known by other means.\n   Enable R1 MF tones via type 3 packets\
    \ (\"etr1\"):\n   A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards\
    \ and\n   receives R1 MF tones via type 3 packets.  This signal indicates that\n\
    \   the media gateway is to forward and receive R1 MF tones via type 3\n   packets\
    \ on an AAL2 connection.  This does not preclude the call agent\n   from requesting\
    \ notification of R1 MF tones.\n   Enable R2 MF tones via type 3 packets (\"etr2\"\
    ):\n   A gateway will ignore this signal request if it normally forwards and\n\
    \   receives R2 MF tones via type 3 packets.  This signal indicates that\n   the\
    \ media gateway is to forward and receive R2 MF tones via type 3\n   packets on\
    \ an AAL2 connection.  This does not preclude the call agent\n   from requesting\
    \ notification of R2 MF tones.\n   Used codec changed (\"uc (string)\"):\n   If\
    \ armed via an R:atm/uc, a media gateway signals a codec change\n   through an\
    \ O:atm/uc.  The alphanumeric string in parentheses is\n   optional.  It is the\
    \ encoding name of the codec to which the switch\n   is made.  Although this event\
    \ can be used with all ATM adaptations\n   (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5):\n      *  The\
    \ pftrans event is more suited to AAL2 applications.\n      *  Codec switches\
    \ do not generally occur mid-call in AAL1\n         applications.\n   Packet time\
    \ changed (\"ptime(#)\"):\n   If armed via an R:atm/ptime, a media gateway signals\
    \ a packetization\n   period change through an O:atm/ptime.  The decimal number\
    \ in\n   parentheses is optional.  It is the new packetization period in\n   milliseconds.\
    \  In AAL2 applications, the pftrans event can be used to\n   cover packetization\
    \ period changes (and codec changes).\n   Profile element changed (\"pftrans(#)\"\
    ):\n   If armed via an R:atm/pftrans, a media gateway signals a mid-call\n   profile\
    \ element change through an O:atm/ptime.  This event is used\n   with AAL2 adaptation\
    \ only.  A profile element is a row in a profile\n   table.  Profile elements\
    \ indicating silence should not trigger this\n   event.  The decimal number in\
    \ parentheses is optional.  It is the row\n   number to which the switch is made.\
    \  Rows are counted downward,\n   beginning from 1.\n   Cell loss exceeded (\"\
    cle(#)\"):\n   This event indicates that the cell loss rate exceeds the threshold\
    \ #.\n   If the threshold is omitted in the requested events and observed\n  \
    \ events parameters, it is known by other means.  The optional decimal\n   number\
    \ is the number of dropped cells per 100,000 cells.  For\n   example, cle(10)\
    \ indicates cells are being dropped at a rate of 1 in\n   10,000 cells.\n   Packet\
    \ loss exceeded (\"ple(#)\"):\n   This event indicates that the packet loss rate\
    \ exceeds the threshold\n   #.  If the threshold is omitted in the requested events\
    \ and observed\n   events parameters, it is known by other means.  The optional\
    \ decimal\n   number is the number of dropped packets per 100,000 packets.  For\n\
    \   example, ple(10) indicates packets are being dropped at a rate of 1\n   in\
    \ 10,000 packets.\n   When the bearer connection uses an AAL2 CID within a multiplexed\
    \ VCC\n   rather than an entire VCC, the 'ple' event is used instead of 'cle'.\n\
    \   The packets are AAL2 CPS PDUs.\n   Quality alert (\"qa\"):\n   This event\
    \ indicates that the bearer path fails to any predetermined\n   combination of\
    \ quality criteria such as loss, delay, jitter etc.\n   This criterion is not\
    \ defined and is left to the application.  The\n   gateway reports this quality\
    \ violation to the call agent if armed to\n   do so.\n   Report failure (\"of\
    \ (#)\"):\n   This indicates a connection failure.  It can also indicate failure\
    \ to\n   establish a connection, in lieu of \"sf\".\n   The most common response\
    \ to these events is for the media gateway to\n   delete the connection.  Some\
    \ applications might choose to report an\n   \"of\" with the appropriate reason\
    \ code, a decimal number, optionally\n   included in parentheses.  Reason codes\
    \ are the same as for\n   spontaneous deletes by the gateway.\n"

    \ specific to the ATM package is defined.\n   The standard connection parameters\
    \ redefined for ATM are:\n   Number of packets sent: If a VCC is assigned to the\

  - "6.1  Consistency of Parameters\n   For ATM networks, the \"nt\" local connection\
    \ option in MGCP must be\n   set to \"ATM\".\n   In any ATM application, the following\
    \ Local Connection Options should\n   not be used:\n      Type of service, L:\
    \ t\n      Resource reservation, L: r\n   This is because the Local Connection\

- title: 6.2  Codec/Profile Negotiation in ATM Networks
  contents:
  - "6.2  Codec/Profile Negotiation in ATM Networks\n   In AAL1 and AAL5 applications,\
    \ codec negotiation is similar to the IP\n   case, although some of the local\
    \ connection options and SDP\n   connection descriptor parameters are different.\
    \  See [18] for\n   conventions for the use of the Session Description Protocol\
    \ [26] in\n   the ATM context.\n   In AAL2 applications, the L:a and L:p parameters\
    \ are disallowed.\n   Profile negotiation takes the place of codec negotiation.\
    \  The\n   remainder of this section addresses how this is done.\n   The specifics\
    \ of the AAL2 bearer are not germane to profile\n   negotiation.  The bearer could\
    \ be PVC-based or SVC-based, based on\n   single-CID or multi-CID VCs, subcell\
    \ multiplexed or not.\n   The most general case involves different prioritized\
    \ lists of\n   profiles at the originating gateway, the terminating gateway, the\n\
    \   originating call agent and the terminating call agent.  Whether these\n  \
    \ lists are based on network policies, end subscriber service level\n   agreements\
    \ or equipment design is immaterial to the profile\n   negotiation that is done\
    \ as part of the connection establishment\n   process.  It is also irrelevant\
    \ whether these lists are hardcoded\n   defaults or provisionable.  In the connection\
    \ establishment process,\n   a series of ordered intersections is performed. \
    \ This leaves a single\n   ordered list in the end.  The highest priority profile\
    \ in this list\n   is the selected profile.\n   The call agent conveys its priority\
    \ list through the pfl local\n   connection option.  The gateway conveys intersection\
    \ results through\n   the media information line in SDP [18].  Whether these lists\
    \ imply a\n   real priority or not, a profile is, as a general rule, preferred\
    \ to\n   profiles that follow it in a list.\n   Each media gateway has a policy\
    \ for assigning priorities to different\n   lists (inter-list priority) which\
    \ is different from the positional\n   ordering of profiles within a list (intra-list\
    \ priority).  This\n   policy might be a hardcoded default or provisioned.  The\
    \ inter-list\n   priority specifies an ordering of the following lists with respect\
    \ to\n   each other:\n      *  'C-list', which is the priority list from the call\
    \ agent,\n         received through L: atm/pfl.\n      *  'R-list', which is the\
    \ priority list from the remote end,\n         received through the SDP remote\
    \ connection descriptor.\n      *  'L-list', which is the local priority list,\
    \ hardcoded or\n         provisioned.\n   Depending on the application, different\
    \ inter-list priorities may be\n   used in cases where the gateway originates\
    \ and terminates a call.\n   The policy mentioned above will vary depending on\
    \ the type,\n   capabilities and deployment of the media gateway.  Network\n \
    \  administrations or equipment vendors will provision/default this\n   policy\
    \ for various reasons such as resource usage optimization,\n   quality of service,\
    \ likelihood of finding a common profile etc.\n   When doing an ordered intersection\
    \ of lists, the intra-list\n   priorities of the highest priority list are used.\
    \  Any profile that\n   cannot be supported due to resource (bandwidth, processing\
    \ power\n   etc.)  limitations is eliminated from the intersection.\n   In the\
    \ absence of one or more of these lists, the remaining list(s)\n   are used in\
    \ the profile selection process.  If the call agent does\n   not provide a list\
    \ of profiles, the C-list is absent.  In this case,\n   the intersection of the\
    \ C-list, R-list and L-list simply becomes the\n   intersection of the R-list\
    \ and the L-list.  If the R-list is also\n   absent, no intersection is performed\
    \ and the result of this null\n   operation is the L-list.  Previous values, if\
    \ any, of the C-list and\n   R-list are not used.\n   The process of profile negotiation\
    \ is as shown below:\n          ORIGINATING                     TERMINATING\n\

    \    via SDP.\n   Prior to receiving the final profile in step 5, if the originating\n\
    \   gateway has indicated multiple profiles in step 2, the originating\n   gateway\
    \ does not always have a usable basis for decoding AAL2\n   packets.  This is\
    \ because a combination of packet length and UUI\n   (user-to-user indication)\
    \ codepoint range may indicate different\n   codecs in different profiles.  The\
    \ time lag between when the\n   terminating gateways start sending AAL2 packets\
    \ and when the\n   originating gateway becomes aware of the selected AAL2 profile\
    \ should\n   be minimized so that any ensuing clipping of the front-end of the\n\
    \   audio stream is tolerable for voice circuits.  It is unlikely that\n   this\
    \ will introduce errors in modem or fax circuits since these will\n   not have\
    \ entered their user data transfer phase at this time.\n   When connection establishment\
    \ is complete, there is only one profile\n   associated with a connection.  This\
    \ implies that both endpoints are\n   ready to receive, on the fly, packets that\
    \ comply with any row in the\n   profile.  Some applications may elect to associate\
    \ profile rows with\n   one or more of the following service types: voice service,\
    \ voiceband\n   data (modem) passthrough service and fax service.  This binding\
    \ can\n   be by default, through provisioning or as part of profile negotiation\n\
    \   during call establishment.  Such service type associations, when\n   communicated\
    \ to another entity, are advisory and do not limit the\n   requirement for supporting,\
    \ at any time, on-the-fly switches to any\n   profile element.\n   Media gateways\
    \ can have internal default (or provisioned) bindings\n   between service types\
    \ and profile elements.  Note that not all of\n   these bindings might be meaningful\
    \ in an application context (e.g.,\n   the fax service binding might be ignored\
    \ and omitted).  As part of\n   profile negotiation, applications might choose\
    \ to coordinate those\n   bindings that are meaningful.  When this is done, the\
    \ vsel, dsel and\n   fsel LCOs described in this document, and the vsel, dsel\
    \ and fsel\n   media attribute lines [18] are used to effect this coordination.\n\
    \   Using these constructs, entities such as call agents and media\n   gateways\
    \ can indicate preferred bindings for the first, most\n   preferred profile in\
    \ a profile list.\n   When performing ordered intersections of the C-list, L-list\
    \ and\n   R-list in the call flow above, media gateways MUST use the inter-list\n\
    \   priority to choose between a service to profile row binding suggested\n  \
    \ by the call agent, the remote gateway or it own internal (provisioned\n   or\
    \ default) binding.  Thus, a service type to profile row binding\n   inherits\
    \ its relative priority from the profile list generated by the\n   same source.\
    \  If the C-list has the highest priority, and the first\n   profile in the C-list\
    \ is selected as the first profile of the\n   intersected list, then any service\
    \ type to profile row bindings\n   provided by the call agent via the vsel, dsel\
    \ and fsel LCOs are\n   associated with the first profile.  If the R-list has\
    \ the highest\n   priority, and the first profile in the R-list is selected as\
    \ the\n   first profile of the intersected list, then any service type to\n  \
    \ profile row bindings provided by the remote gateway via the vsel,\n   dsel and\
    \ fsel SDP attributes [18] are associated with the first\n   profile.  If the\
    \ L-list has the highest priority, then any internal\n   (default or provisioned)\
    \ service to profile row bindings are\n   associated with the first profile. \
    \ At the end of profile negotiation\n   (step 4 in the call flow above), there\
    \ is one profile selected by the\n   terminating media gateway.  It MAY convey\
    \ any applicable service type\n   to profile row bindings for this profile to\
    \ the originating gateway\n   via the vsel, dsel and fsel SDP attributes [18].\n\
    \   If the first profile in the intersected list is not the first profile\n  \
    \ in the highest priority profile list, then any service to profile row\n   bindings\
    \ associated with the highest priority profile list cannot be\n   used with the\
    \ first (or only profile) in the intersected list.  In\n   this case, the originating\
    \ or terminating media gateway MUST attempt\n   to associate internal (default\
    \ or provisioned) service to profile row\n   bindings with the first (or only\
    \ profile) in the intersected list.\n   Since there is more than one service type,\
    \ it is possible that the\n   service type to profile row bindings for the first\
    \ profile in the\n   intersected list be derived from different sources (the call\
    \ agent,\n   the remote media gateway, internal defaults or provisioning).  For\n\
    \   consistency, if the voiceband data (passthrough) service mappings\n   include\
    \ fax, then a different set of fax service mappings cannot\n   apply to the profile\
    \ under consideration.  If applied in this case,\n   the set of fax service mappings\
    \ must include the same codecs, packet\n   lengths and packetization periods as\
    \ the voiceband data service\n   mappings.  However, they may be in a different\
    \ order.\n   If the media gateway lumps fax service with voiceband data (modem)\n\
    \   passthrough service, then it can ignore any fax service to profile\n   row\
    \ bindings provided by another entity such as the call agent or the\n   remote\
    \ gateway.  From the media gateway's perspective, there is no\n   distinct fax\
    \ service in this case.  In this case, the media gateway\n   will not indicate\
    \ a separate preference for the use of certain\n   profile rows in conjunction\
    \ with fax service.\n   It is possible that the procedure described in this section\
    \ for\n   associating service types with profile rows fail to yield mappings\n\
    \   between a given service type and the row(s) of the first profile in\n   the\
    \ intersected list of profiles.  This is acceptable since these\n   bindings are\
    \ merely indications of the preferred codecs and\n   packetizations in the context\
    \ of a given service.  They do not\n   obviate the AAL2 requirement that, given\
    \ a profile that is bound to a\n   connection, a transmitter may switch to any\
    \ profile row on the fly.\n   An example of profile negotiation:\n   The L-list\
    \ at gateway #1, which is the originating gateway in this\n   example, is:\n \
    \     custom 100, itu 3, itu 1, itu 8\n   The L-list at gateway #2, which is the\
    \ terminating gateway in this\n   example, is:\n      itu 2, itu 3, itu 1, itu\
    \ 5\n   The originating call agent sends the following profile list (C-list)\n\
    \   to the originating gateway in the first create connection command:\n     \
    \ itu 8, itu 9, atmf 7, itu 3, itu 1, custom 100\n   Further, the originating\
    \ call agent qualifies the first profile in\n   its list with the following service\
    \ type bindings:\n      L: atm/vsel:\"G729 10 10000\", atm/dsel:\"on PCMU 40 5000\"\
    \n   There is no atm/fsel local connection option.  Facsimile is included\n  \
    \ with voiceband data in the atm/dsel local connection option.\n   In step 1 at\
    \ the originating gateway, there is no remote connection\n   descriptor, hence\
    \ no R-list.  The policy for originating calls at\n   gateway #1 is:\n      C-List\
    \ > R-list > L-list\n   where '>' means 'has higher priority than'.  The term\
    \ 'R-list' can be\n   omitted from this series of inequalities since, in case\
    \ under study,\n   profile negotiation does not include any further ordered\n\
    \   intersections at the originating gateway.\n   In accordance with this policy,\
    \ the originating gateway performs an\n   ordered intersection of the C-list and\
    \ the L-list to produce:\n      itu 8, itu 3, itu 1, custom 100\n   Since the\
    \ C-list has the highest priority and the first profile in\n   the intersected\
    \ profile list is also the first profile in the C-list,\n   the service bindings\
    \ provided by the originating call agent are\n   associated with the first profile,\
    \ itu 8.  The originating gateway\n   sends this result(intersected profile list\
    \ and service bindings for\n   the first profile, itu 8) via the SDP remote session\
    \ descriptor to\n   the terminating gateway.  The service bindings are expressed\
    \ as\n   follows [18]:\n      a=vsel:G729 10 10000\n      a=dsel:on PCMU 40 5000\n\
    \   The intersected profile list produced by gateway 1 becomes the R-list\n  \
    \ for gateway #2.  The terminating call agent sends the following\n   profile\
    \ list (C-list) to the terminating gateway in the first create\n   connection\
    \ command:\n      itu 1, itu 4,   itu 3, custom 110, custom 100, itu 2\n   Any\
    \ service bindings (not shown) sent by the terminating call agent\n   apply to\
    \ the first profile in this list, itu 1.\n   The policy for terminating calls\
    \ at gateway #2 is:\n      R-list > L-list > C-list\n   Using this policy, gateway\
    \ #2 produces the following ordered\n   intersection of R-list, L-list and C-list:\n\
    \      itu 3, itu 1\n   The first profile in this list, itu 3, is to be used for\
    \ this\n   connection.  Gateway 2 indicates this to the call agent through the\n\
    \   SDP local connection descriptor.\n   Note that the service bindings provided\
    \ by the originating gateway\n   have not been specified with respect to itu 3.\
    \  Therefore, these\n   cannot be used even though the R-list has the highest\
    \ priority at the\n   terminating gateway.  Any existing internal (default or\
    \ provisioned)\n   service bindings for AAL2 profile itu 3 must be associated\
    \ by the\n   terminating gateway with the selected profile, itu 3.  Those service\n\
    \   bindings that are internally unavailable are left unspecified.\n   Since the\
    \ internal service type bindings do exist for the profile itu\n   3 at the terminating\
    \ gateway, they are selected and bound to the\n   connection.  In these, fax service\
    \ is lumped with voiceband data\n   passthrough.  These bindings are indicated\
    \ to the originating gateway\n   via the following SDP media attribute lines:\n\
    \      a=vsel:G726-32 20 5000 G726-24 15 5000\n      a=dsel:on PCMU 40 5000 G726-40\
    \ 25 5000\n   The vsel line maps voice service to certain rows in the itu 3 profile\n\
    \   table.  The dsel line maps voiceband data service to certain rows in\n   the\
    \ itu 3 profile table.  The \"on\" in the dsel line indicates that\n   voiceband\
    \ data includes fax, otherwise a separate fsel line might\n   have been used.\
    \  Two codecs each are indicated for voice and for\n   voiceband data, with the\
    \ first codec being the preferred one.\n   Although the originating gateway is\
    \ not constrained by these advisory\n   indications of profile element to service\
    \ type mapping, applications\n   may choose to limit on-the-fly switches based\
    \ on the current service\n   state (voice, voiceband data etc.).  If done, this\
    \ provides greater\n   simplicity at the expense of flexibility.\n"
