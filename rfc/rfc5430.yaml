  - "1.  Introduction\n   The United States government has posted the Fact Sheet on\
    \ National\n   Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography [NSA], and at the time\
    \ of\n   writing, it states:\n       To complement the existing policy for the\
    \ use of the Advanced\n       Encryption Standard (AES) to protect national security\
    \ systems\n       and information as specified in The National Policy on the use\
    \ of\n       the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National\n    \
    \   Security Systems and National Security Information (CNSSP-15),\n       the\
    \ National Security Agency (NSA) announced Suite B Cryptography\n       at the\
    \ 2005 RSA Conference.  In addition to the AES, Suite B\n       includes cryptographic\
    \ algorithms for hashing, digital\n       signatures, and key exchange.\n    \
    \   Suite B only specifies the cryptographic algorithms to be\n       used. Many\
    \ other factors need to be addressed in determining\n       whether a particular\
    \ device implementing a particular set of\n       cryptographic algorithms should\
    \ be used to satisfy a particular\n       requirement.\n   Among those factors\
    \ are \"requirements for interoperability both\n   domestically and internationally\"\
    .\n   This document does not define any new cipher suites; instead, it\n   defines\
    \ two profiles:\n   o  A Suite B compliant profile for use with TLS version 1.2\
    \ [RFC5246]\n      and the cipher suites defined in [RFC5289].  This profile uses\n\
    \      only Suite B algorithms.\n   o  A transitional profile for use with TLS\
    \ version 1.0 [RFC2246] or\n      TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346] and the cipher suites\
    \ defined in\n      [RFC4492].  This profile uses the Suite B cryptographic algorithms\n\
    \      to the greatest extent possible and provides backward\n      compatibility.\
    \  While the transitional profile is not Suite B\n      compliant, it provides\
    \ a transition path towards the Suite B\n      compliant profile.\n"

- title: 3.  Suite B Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Suite B Requirements\n   The Fact Sheet on Suite B Cryptography requires\
    \ that key\n   establishment and authentication algorithms be based on Elliptic\n\
    \   Curve Cryptography, and that the encryption algorithm be AES [AES].\n   Suite\
    \ B defines two security levels, of 128 and 192 bits.\n   In particular, Suite\
    \ B includes:\n       Encryption:         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES]\
    \ --\n                           FIPS 197 (with key sizes of 128 and 256 bits)\n\
    \       Digital Signature:  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\n     \
    \                      (ECDSA) [DSS] - FIPS 186-2 (using the\n               \
    \            curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)\n       Key Exchange:\
    \       Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) - NIST\n                        \
    \   Special Publication 800-56A [PWKE] (using the\n                          \
    \ curves with 256- and 384-bit prime moduli)\n   The 128-bit security level corresponds\
    \ to an elliptic curve size of\n   256 bits and AES-128; it also makes use of\
    \ SHA-256 [SHS].  The 192-\n   bit security level corresponds to an elliptic curve\
    \ size of 384 bits\n   and AES-256; it also makes use of SHA-384 [SHS].\n   Note:\
    \ Some people refer to the two security levels based on the AES\n   key size that\
    \ is employed instead of the overall security provided by\n   the combination\
    \ of Suite B algorithms.  At the 128-bit security\n   level, an AES key size of\
    \ 128 bits is used, which does not lead to\n   any confusion.  However, at the\
    \ 192-bit security level, an AES key\n   size of 256 bits is used, which sometimes\
    \ leads to an expectation of\n   more security than is offered by the combination\
    \ of Suite B\n   algorithms.\n   To accommodate backward compatibility, a Suite\
    \ B compliant client or\n   server can be configured to accept a cipher suite\
    \ that is not part of\n   Suite B. However, whenever a Suite B compliant client\
    \ and a Suite B\n   compliant server establish a TLS version 1.2 session, only\
    \ Suite B\n   algorithms are employed.\n"
- title: 4.  Suite B Compliance and Interoperability Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Suite B Compliance and Interoperability Requirements\n   TLS version 1.1\
    \ [RFC4346] and earlier do not support Galois Counter\n   Mode (GCM) cipher suites\
    \ [RFC5289].  However, TLS version 1.2\n   [RFC5246] and later do support GCM.\
    \  For Suite B TLS compliance, GCM\n   cipher suites are REQUIRED to be used whenever\
    \ both the client and\n   the server support the necessary cipher suites.  Also,\
    \ for Suite B\n   TLS compliance, Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) cipher suites are\n\
    \   employed when GCM cipher suites cannot be employed.\n   For a client to implement\
    \ the Suite B compliant profile, it MUST\n   implement TLS version 1.2 or later,\
    \ and the following cipher suite\n   rules apply:\n   o  A Suite B compliant TLS\
    \ version 1.2 or later client MUST offer at\n      least two cipher suites for\
    \ each supported security level.  For\n      the 128-bit security level,\n   \
    \   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\
    \ MUST be offered in this\n      order in the ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit\
    \ security level,\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384\
    \ MUST be offered in this\n      order in the ClientHello message.  One of these\
    \ cipher suites MUST\n      be the first (most preferred) cipher suite in the\
    \ ClientHello\n      message.\n   o  A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later\
    \ client that offers\n      backward compatibility with TLS version 1.1 or earlier\
    \ servers MAY\n      offer an additional cipher suite for each supported security\n\
    \      level.  If these cipher suites are offered, they MUST appear after\n  \
    \    the ones discussed above.  For the 128-bit security level,\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \ MAY be offered in the\n      ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit security\
    \ level,\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA MAY be offered in the\n \
    \     ClientHello message.\n   o  A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later\
    \ client that offers\n      interoperability with non-Suite B compliant servers\
    \ MAY offer\n      additional cipher suites.  If any additional cipher suites\
    \ are\n      offered, they MUST appear after the ones discussed above in the\n\
    \      ClientHello message.\n   For a client to implement the Suite B transitional\
    \ profile, it MUST\n   implement TLS version 1.1 or earlier and the following\
    \ cipher suite\n   rules apply:\n   o  A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1\
    \ or earlier client MUST\n      offer the cipher suite for the 128-bit security\
    \ level, the cipher\n      suite for the 192-bit security level, or both.  For\
    \ the 128-bit\n      security level, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA MUST\
    \ be\n      offered in the ClientHello message.  For the 192-bit security\n  \
    \    level, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA MUST be offered in the\n    \
    \  ClientHello message.  One of these cipher suites MUST be the first\n      (most\
    \ preferred) cipher suite in the ClientHello message.\n   o  A Suite B transitional\
    \ TLS version 1.1 or earlier client that\n      offers interoperability with non-Suite\
    \ B compliant servers MAY\n      offer additional cipher suites.  If any additional\
    \ cipher suites\n      are offered, they MUST appear after the ones discussed\
    \ above in\n      the ClientHello message.\n   A Suite B compliant TLS server\
    \ MUST be configured to support the 128-\n   bit security level, the 192-bit security\
    \ level, or both security\n   levels.  The cipher suite rules for each of these\
    \ security levels is\n   described below.  If a Suite B compliant TLS server is\
    \ configured to\n   support both security levels, then the configuration MUST\
    \ prefer one\n   security level over the other.  In practice, this means that\
    \ the\n   cipher suite rules associated with the cipher suites listed in\n   Section\
    \ 4.1 for the preferred security level are processed before the\n   cipher suite\
    \ rules for the less preferred security level.\n   For a server to implement the\
    \ Suite B conformant profile at the 128-\n   bit security level, the following\
    \ cipher suite rules apply:\n   o  A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later\
    \ server MUST accept\n      the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher\
    \ suite if it is\n      offered.\n   o  If the preceding cipher suite is not offered,\
    \ then a Suite B\n      compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST accept\
    \ the\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 cipher suite if it is\n \
    \     offered.\n   o  If neither of the preceding two cipher suites is offered,\
    \ then a\n      Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server that offers\n\
    \      backward compatibility with TLS version 1.1 or earlier clients MAY\n  \
    \    accept the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it\n    \
    \  is offered.\n   o  If the server is not offered any of the preceding three\
    \ cipher\n      suites and interoperability with clients that are not compliant\
    \ or\n      interoperable with Suite B is desired, then the server MAY accept\n\
    \      another offered cipher suite that is considered acceptable by the\n   \
    \   server administrator.\n   For a server to implement the Suite B transitional\
    \ profile at the\n   128-bit security level, the following cipher suite rules\
    \ apply:\n   o  A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier server MUST\n\
    \      accept the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it\n  \
    \    is offered.\n   o  If the server is not offered the preceding cipher suite\
    \ and\n      interoperability with clients that are not Suite B transitional is\n\
    \      desired, then the server MAY accept another offered cipher suite\n    \
    \  that is considered acceptable by the server administrator.\n   For a server\
    \ to implement the Suite B conformant profile at the 192-\n   bit security level,\
    \ the following cipher suite rules apply:\n   o  A Suite B compliant TLS version\
    \ 1.2 or later server MUST accept\n      the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\
    \ cipher suite if it is\n      offered.\n   o  If the preceding cipher suite is\
    \ not offered, then a Suite B\n      compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server\
    \ MUST accept the\n      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 cipher suite\
    \ if it is\n      offered.\n   o  If neither of the preceding two cipher suites\
    \ is offered, then a\n      Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server\
    \ that offers\n      backward compatibility with TLS version 1.1 or earlier clients\
    \ MAY\n      accept the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it\n\
    \      is offered.\n   o  If the server is not offered any of the preceding three\
    \ cipher\n      suites and interoperability with clients that are not compliant\
    \ or\n      interoperable with Suite B is desired, then the server MAY accept\n\
    \      another offered cipher suite that is considered acceptable by the\n   \
    \   server administrator.\n   For a server to implement the Suite B transitional\
    \ profile at the\n   192-bit security level, the following cipher suite rules\
    \ apply:\n   o  A Suite B transitional TLS version 1.1 or earlier server MUST\n\
    \      accept the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if it\n  \
    \    is offered.\n   o  If the server is not offered the preceding cipher suite\
    \ and\n      interoperability with clients that are not Suite B transitional is\n\
    \      desired, then the server MAY accept another offered cipher suite\n    \
    \  that is considered acceptable by the server administrator.\n   Note that these\
    \ rules explicitly permit the use of CBC cipher suites\n   in TLS version 1.2\
    \ connections in order to permit operation between\n   Suite B compliant and non-Suite\
    \ B compliant implementations.  For\n   instance, a Suite B compliant TLS version\
    \ 1.2 client might offer TLS\n   version 1.2 with both GCM and CBC cipher suites\
    \ when communicating\n   with a non-Suite B TLS version 1.2 server, which then\
    \ selected the\n   CBC cipher suites.  This connection would nevertheless meet\
    \ the\n   requirements of this specification.  However, any two Suite B\n   compliant\
    \ implementations will negotiate a GCM cipher suite when\n   doing TLS version\
    \ 1.2.\n"

- title: 4.2.  Acceptable Curves
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Acceptable Curves\n   RFC 4492 defines a variety of elliptic curves.  For\
    \ cipher suites\n   defined in this specification, only secp256r1(23) or secp384r1(24)\n\
    \   may be used.  These are the same curves that appear in FIPS 186-2\n   [DSS]\
    \ as P-256 and P-384, respectively.  For cipher suites at the\n   128-bit security\
    \ level, secp256r1 MUST be used.  For cipher suites at\n   the 192-bit security\
    \ level, secp384r1 MUST be used.  RFC 4492\n   requires that the uncompressed(0)\
    \ form be supported.  The\n   ansiX962_compressed_prime(1) point formats MAY also\
    \ be supported.\n   Clients desiring to negotiate only a Suite B compliant connection\n\
    \   MUST generate a \"Supported Elliptic Curves Extension\" containing only\n\
    \   the allowed curves.  These curves MUST match the cipher suite\n   security\
    \ levels being offered.  Clients that are willing to do both\n   Suite B compliant\
    \ and non-Suite B compliant connections MAY omit the\n   extension or send the\
    \ extension but offer other curves as well as the\n   appropriate Suite B ones.\n\
    \   Servers desiring to negotiate a Suite B compliant connection SHOULD\n   check\
    \ for the presence of the extension, but MUST NOT negotiate\n   inappropriate\
    \ curves even if they are offered by the client.  This\n   allows a client that\
    \ is willing to do either Suite B compliant or\n   non-Suite B compliant modes\
    \ to interoperate with a server that will\n   only do Suite B compliant modes.\
    \  If the client does not advertise an\n   acceptable curve, the server MUST generate\
    \ a fatal\n   \"handshake_failure\" alert and terminate the connection.  Clients\
    \ MUST\n   check the chosen curve to make sure it is acceptable.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Certificates
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Certificates\n   Server and client certificates used to establish a Suite\
    \ B compliant\n   connection MUST be signed with ECDSA.  Digital signatures MUST\
    \ be\n   calculated using either the P-256 curve along with the SHA-256 hash\n\
    \   algorithm or calculated using the P-384 curve along with the SHA-384\n   hash\
    \ algorithm.  For certificates used at the 128-bit security level,\n   the subject\
    \ public key MUST use the P-256 curve and be signed with\n   either the P-384\
    \ curve or the P-256 curve.  For certificates used at\n   the 192-bit security\
    \ level, the subject public key MUST use the P-384\n   curve and be signed with\
    \ the P-384 curve.\n   In TLS version 1.0 and TLS version 1.1, the key exchange\
    \ algorithm\n   used in the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA-collection of cipher suites requires\
    \ the\n   server's certificate to be signed with a particular signature scheme.\n\
    \   TLS version 1.2 offers more flexibility.  This specification does not\n  \
    \ impose any additional restrictions on the server certificate\n   signature or\
    \ the signature schemes used elsewhere in the\n   certification path.  (Often\
    \ such restrictions will be useful, and it\n   is expected that this will be taken\
    \ into account in practices of\n   certification authorities.  However, such restrictions\
    \ are not\n   strictly required, even if it is beyond the capabilities of a client\n\
    \   to completely validate a given certification path, the client may be\n   able\
    \ to validate the server's certificate by relying on a trusted\n   certification\
    \ authority whose certificate appears as one of the\n   intermediate certificates\
    \ in the certification path.)\n   Likewise, this specification does not impose\
    \ restrictions on\n   signature schemes used in the certification path for the\
    \ client's\n   certificate when mutual authentication is employed.\n"

    \ of cipher suites, the server sends\n   its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification\
    \ of the\n   corresponding curve in the ServerKeyExchange message.  These\n  \
    \ parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the private key\n   corresponding\
    \ to the public key in the server's certificate.\n   A TLS version 1.1 or earlier\
    \ server MUST sign the ServerKeyExchange\n   message using SHA-1 with ECDSA.\n\
    \   A Suite B compliant TLS version 1.2 or later server MUST sign the\n   ServerKeyExchange\
    \ message using either SHA-256 with ECDSA or SHA-384\n   with ECDSA.  For the\
    \ 128-bit security level, SHA-256 with ECDSA MUST\n   be used.  For the 192-bit\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Most of the security considerations for this\
    \ document are described\n   in \"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol\
    \ Version 1.2\"\n   [RFC5246], \"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites\
    \ for\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS)\" [RFC4492], \"AES Galois Counter Mode\n\
    \   (GCM) Cipher Suites for TLS\" [RFC5288], and \"TLS Elliptic Curve\n   Cipher\
    \ Suites with SHA-256/384 and AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM)\"\n   [RFC5289]. \
    \ Readers should consult those documents.\n   In order to meet the goal of a consistent\
    \ security level for the\n   entire cipher suite, in Suite B mode TLS implementations\
    \ MUST ONLY\n   use the curves defined in Section 4.2.  Otherwise, it is possible\
    \ to\n   have a set of symmetric algorithms with much weaker or stronger\n   security\
    \ properties than the asymmetric (ECC) algorithms.\n"
