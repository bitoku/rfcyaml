Abstract The Optical Interworking Forum (OIF) has defined extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) and the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) for optical User Network Interface (UNI) signaling.
These extensions consist of a set of new data objects and error codes.
This document describes these extensions.
The OIF UNI signaling specification is described in [8].
This specification utilizes IETF protocol standards as well as IETF work in progress.
Specifically, the following IETF specifications are used:  Label distribution protocol (LDP) [6]  Resource reservation protocol (RSVP)
[5]  GMPLS signaling and GMPLS extensions for SONET/SDH [4]  GMPLS RSVP TE and CR
The aim of the OIF UNI specification is the maximal re use of IETF protocol definitions.
A few extensions to IETF protocols, however, have been defined to serve UNI specific needs.
These extensions are described in this document.
Signaling The LDP extensions for UNI signaling consist of new TLVs that capture UNI specific parameters and new UNI specific status codes.
The new TLVs are Source ID (3 TLVs), Destination ID (3 TLVs), Egress Label, Local Connection ID, Diversity, Contract ID, and UNI Service Level [8].
The new status codes are assigned from the private use space of LDP codes, as described in [8].
The UNI specification [8] also defines two new LDP messages, Status Enquiry and Status Response.
These messages have been obsoleted and hence no code points are requested in this document for them.
Three TLVs have been defined to encode the Source ID.
The content and usage of these TLVs are described in [8].

Signaling A single new object class, called "Generalized UNI" is defined.
In addition, extension to the RSVP session object and new UNI specific error codes are defined.
The GENERALIZED UNI object has the following format:
The contents of a GENERALIZED UNI object are a series of variable  length data items.
The common format of the sub objects is shown below:
The following sub objects are defined.
The contents of these sub  objects are described in [8]:  Source Transport Network Assigned (TNA) Address
The following sub types are defined: Ipv4 (Sub type   1); Ipv6 (Sub type   2); NSAP (Sub type   3).
Destination TNA Address sub object: Type   2;
The following sub types are defined: Ipv4 (Sub type   1); Ipv6 (Sub type   2); NSAP (Sub type   3).
Type   3, Sub type   1.  Egress label sub object: Type   4, Sub type   1.  Service level sub object:
Type   5, Sub type   1. 3.2  UNI Ipv4 Session Object
This object [7] has the following format: UNI IPv4 SESSION object:
The C Type value (11) will distinguish UNI related RSVP Sessions from other RSVP sessions.
The usage of this object is described in [8].
3.3  Error Codes UNI specific errors fall under the "Routing Problem" (error code   24) [7] and "Policy Control Failure" (error code   2) [5] errors, and they require the assignment of sub codes.
The following is the list of errors and proposed assignments of sub codes:  Routing Problem: Diversity not available (Error code   24, sub  code   100)
Routing Problem: Service level not available (Error code   24, sub code   101)
Invalid/Unknown connection ID (Error code   24, sub code   102)  Policy control failure: Unauthorized sender (Error code   2, sub  code
100)  Policy control failure: Unauthorized receiver (Error code   2, sub code   101
The OIF UNI 1.0 specification defines new objects and error codes under LDP and RSVP.
The majority of these extensions require code point assignments via IETF consensus action.
4.1 LDP Messages, TLVs and Status Codes TLV types 0x0960 0x0970
as described in Sections 2.1 2.7 above.
UNI specific status codes have been allocated out of the Private Use space, i.e., 0x3Fxxxxxx.
These do not require IANA administration.
4.2  RSVP Object Class and Error Codes Generalized UNI object class (Section 3.1), Class Number 229, C Type 1.
Further sub objects are defined, with Type numbers 1 5 and various Sub Type numbers, as described in Section 3.1.
The code points for the Generalized UNI object and the associated sub objects require IANA administration.
UNI Ipv4 Session Object (Class Num   1, C Type   11), as described in Section 3.2.
UNI specific errors fall under the Routing Problem and Policy Control Failure errors (error codes 24 and 2).
Sub codes under error code 24 are 100, 101 and 102, as described in Section 3.3.
Sub codes under error code 2 are 100 and 101, as described in Section 3.3.
Security Considerations Security considerations related to RSVP, RSVP TE and LDP are described in Section 2.8, Section 6 and Section 5 of RFCs 2205 [5], 3209 [9] and 3036 [6], respectively.
Security considerations pertaining to UNI signaling using the extensions described in this document and how these relate to the security aspects of RSVP, RSVP  TE and LDP are described in Section 13.4 of the UNI specification [8].
