- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the current global hierarchical\n\
    \   replicated distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail\n   proxy,\
    \ and similar information. The DNS has been extended to include\n   digital signatures\
    \ and cryptographic keys as described in [RFC 2535].\n   Thus the DNS can now\
    \ be used for secure key distribution.\n"
- title: 1.1 About This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1 About This Document\n   This document describes how to store Diffie-Hellman\
    \ keys in the DNS.\n   Familiarity with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm\
    \ is assumed\n   [Schneier].\n"
- title: 1.2 About Diffie-Hellman
  contents:
  - "1.2 About Diffie-Hellman\n   Diffie-Hellman requires two parties to interact\
    \ to derive keying\n   information which can then be used for authentication.\
    \  Since DNS SIG\n   RRs are primarily used as stored authenticators of zone information\n\
    \   for many different resolvers, no Diffie-Hellman algorithm SIG RR is\n   defined.\
    \ For example, assume that two parties have local secrets \"i\"\n   and \"j\"\
    .  Assume they each respectively calculate X and Y as follows:\n             \
    \   X = g**i ( mod p ) Y = g**j ( mod p )\n   They exchange these quantities and\
    \ then each calculates a Z as\n   follows:\n                Zi = Y**i ( mod p\
    \ ) Zj = X**j ( mod p )\n   shared secret between the two parties that an adversary\
    \ who does not\n   know i or j will not be able to learn from the exchanged messages\n\
    \   (unless the adversary can derive i or j by performing a discrete\n   logarithm\
    \ mod p which is hard for strong p and g).\n   The private key for each party\
    \ is their secret i (or j).  The public\n   key is the pair p and g, which must\
    \ be the same for the parties, and\n   their individual X (or Y).\n"
- title: 2. Diffie-Hellman KEY Resource Records
  contents:
  - "2. Diffie-Hellman KEY Resource Records\n   Diffie-Hellman keys are stored in\
    \ the DNS as KEY RRs using algorithm\n   number 2.  The structure of the RDATA\
    \ portion of this RR is as shown\n   below.  The first 4 octets, including the\
    \ flags, protocol, and\n   algorithm fields are common to all KEY RRs as described\
    \ in [RFC\n   2535].  The remainder, from prime length through public value is\
    \ the\n   \"public key\" part of the KEY RR. The period of key validity is not\
    \ in\n   the KEY RR but is indicated by the SIG RR(s) which signs and\n   authenticates\
    \ the KEY RR(s) at that domain name.\n                         1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\

    \   Prime length is length of the Diffie-Hellman prime (p) in bytes if it\n  \
    \ is 16 or greater.  Prime contains the binary representation of the\n   Diffie-Hellman\
    \ prime with most significant byte first (i.e., in\n   network order). If \"prime\
    \ length\" field is 1 or 2, then the \"prime\"\n   field is actually an unsigned\
    \ index into a table of 65,536\n   prime/generator pairs and the generator length\
    \ SHOULD be zero.  See\n   Appedix A for defined table entries and Section 4 for\
    \ information on\n   allocating additional table entries.  The meaning of a zero\
    \ or 3\n   through 15 value for \"prime length\" is reserved.\n   Generator length\
    \ is the length of the generator (g) in bytes.\n   Generator is the binary representation\
    \ of generator with most\n   significant byte first.  PublicValueLen is the Length\
    \ of the Public\n   Value (g**i (mod p)) in bytes.  PublicValue is the binary\n\
    \   representation of the DH public value with most significant byte\n   first.\n\
    \   The corresponding algorithm=2 SIG resource record is not used so no\n   format\
    \ for it is defined.\n"
- title: 3. Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Performance Considerations\n   Current DNS implementations are optimized for\
    \ small transfers,\n   typically less than 512 bytes including overhead.  While\
    \ larger\n   transfers will perform correctly and work is underway to make larger\n\
    \   transfers more efficient, it is still advisable to make reasonable\n   efforts\
    \ to minimize the size of KEY RR sets stored within the DNS\n   consistent with\
    \ adequate security.  Keep in mind that in a secure\n   zone, an authenticating\
    \ SIG RR will also be returned.\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   Assignment of meaning to Prime Lengths of 0 and 3\
    \ through 15 requires\n   an IETF consensus.\n   Well known prime/generator pairs\
    \ number 0x0000 through 0x07FF can\n   only be assigned by an IETF standards action\
    \ and this Proposed\n   Standard assigns 0x0001 through 0x0002. Pairs number 0s0800\
    \ through\n   0xBFFF can be assigned based on RFC documentation.  Pairs number\n\
    \   0xC000 through 0xFFFF are available for private use and are not\n   centrally\
    \ coordinated. Use of such private pairs outside of a closed\n   environment may\
    \ result in conflicts.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Many of the general security consideration in\
    \ [RFC 2535] apply.  Keys\n   retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted unless\
    \ (1) they have\n   been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently\n\
    \   verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure\n   obtainment\
    \ or independent verification conform to security policies\n   acceptable to the\
    \ user.  As with all cryptographic algorithms,\n   evaluating the necessary strength\
    \ of the key is important and\n   dependent on local policy.\n   In addition,\
    \ the usual Diffie-Hellman key strength considerations\n   apply. (p-1)/2 should\
    \ also be prime, g should be primitive mod p, p\n   should be \"large\", etc.\
