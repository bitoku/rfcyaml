- title: 1.2.  Requirement for Quotas
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirement for Quotas\n   WebDAV servers based on [RFC2518] have been\
    \ implemented and deployed\n   with quota restrictions on collections and users,\
    \ so it makes sense\n   to standardize this functionality to improve user experience\
    \ and\n   client interoperability.\n   The reasons why WebDAV servers frequently\
    \ have quotas enforced are\n   the same reasons why any storage system comes with\
    \ quotas.\n   o  Sometimes the storage service charges according to quota.\n \
    \  o  Sometimes the storage service is provided free, but the storage\n      service\
    \ provider has limited storage space (e.g., university-\n      provided student\
    \ accounts).\n   o  Even in cases where the storage can be upgraded, the storage\n\
    \      managers may choose to limit quota in order to encourage users to\n   \
    \   limit the files they store on the system and to clean up obsolete\n      files\
    \ (e.g., IT departments within corporations).\n   In order to work best with repositories\
    \ that support quotas, client\n   software should be able to determine and display\
    \ the DAV:quota-\n   available-bytes (defined below) on collections.  Further,\
    \ client\n   software should have some way of fairly reliably determining how\
    \ much\n   storage space is already counted towards that quota.\n   Support for\
    \ the properties defined in this document enhances the\n   client experience,\
    \ because the client has a chance of managing its\n   files to avoid running out\
    \ of allocated storage space.  Clients may\n   not be able to calculate the value\
    \ as accurately on their own,\n   depending on how total space used is calculated\
    \ by the server.\n"
- title: 2.  Solution Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Solution Overview\n   The approach to meeting the requirements and scenarios\
    \ outlined above\n   is to define two live properties.  This specification can\
    \ be met on a\n   server by implementing both DAV:quota-available-bytes and DAV:quota-\n\
    \   used-bytes on collections only.\n   A <DAV:allprop> PROPFIND request SHOULD\
    \ NOT return any of the\n   properties defined by this document.  However, these\
    \ property names\n   MUST be returned in a <DAV:propname> request for a resource\
    \ that\n   supports the properties, except in the case of infinite limits, which\n\
    \   are explained below.\n   The DAV:quota-available-bytes and DAV:quota-used-bytes\
    \ definitions\n   below borrow heavily from the quota definitions in the Network\
    \ File\n   System (NFS) [RFC3530] specification.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  DAV:quota-available-bytes\n   Name: quota-available-bytes\n   Namespace:\

    \      to be allocated to a resource.\n   DTD: <!ELEMENT quota-available-bytes\
    \ (#PCDATA) >\n   The DAV:quota-available-bytes property value is the value in\
    \ octets\n   representing the amount of additional disk space beyond the current\n\
    \   allocation that can be allocated to this resource before further\n   allocations\
    \ will be refused.  It is understood that this space may be\n   consumed by allocations\
    \ to other resources.\n   Support for this property is REQUIRED on collections,\
    \ and OPTIONAL on\n   other resources.  A server SHOULD implement this property\
    \ for each\n   resource that has the DAV:quota-used-bytes property.\n   Clients\
    \ SHOULD expect that as the DAV:quota-available-bytes on a\n   resource approaches\
    \ 0, further allocations to that resource may be\n   refused.  A value of 0 indicates\
    \ that users will probably not be able\n   to perform operations that write additional\
    \ information (e.g., a PUT\n   inside a collection), but may be able to replace\
    \ through overwrite an\n   existing resource of equal size.\n   Note that there\
    \ may be a number of distinct but overlapping limits,\n   which may even include\
    \ physical media limits.  When reporting DAV:\n   quota-available-bytes, the server\
    \ is at liberty to choose any of\n   those limits but SHOULD do so in a repeatable\
    \ way.  The rule may be\n   configured per repository, or may be \"choose the\
    \ smallest number\".\n   If a resource has no quota enforced or unlimited storage\
    \ (\"infinite\n   limits\"), the server MAY choose not to return this property\
    \ (404 Not\n   Found response in Multi-Status), although this specification\n\
    \   RECOMMENDS that servers return some appropriate value (e.g., the\n   amount\
    \ of free disk space).  A client cannot entirely assume that\n   there is no quota\
    \ enforced on a resource that does not have this\n   property, but might as well\
    \ act as if there is no quota.\n   The value of this property is protected (see\
    \ Section 1.4.2 of\n   [RFC3253] for the definition of protected properties).\
    \  A 403\n   Forbidden response is RECOMMENDED for attempts to write a protected\n\
    \   property, and the server SHOULD include an XML error body as defined\n   by\
    \ DeltaV [RFC3253] with the <DAV:cannot-modify-protected-property/>\n   precondition\

    \   quota or physical storage limits.  In order to differentiate the\n   response\

    \ as defined by DeltaV [RFC3253] with the appropriate\n   precondition tag.\n\
    \   Preconditions:\n   (DAV:quota-not-exceeded): the request MUST NOT cause the\

    \ to operating system\n   status codes, such as E_NOSPC and E_DQUOT in NFS (see\
    \ [RFC3530],\n   Section 12).\n"
- title: 7.  Notes
  contents:
  - "7.  Notes\n   Server implementations store and account for their data in many\n\
    \   different ways.  Some of the challenges:\n   o  Some server implementations\
    \ find it prohibitive to count storage\n      used for metadata; others may choose\
    \ to do so for better\n      accounting.\n   o  Older versions of resources may\
    \ be stored as well.\n   o  Variants of one resource may exist with different\
    \ content lengths.\n   o  Content may be dynamically generated.\n   o  Resource\
    \ bodies can be compressed.\n   o  Some resources may be stored for \"free\",\
    \ not counting against\n      quota.\n   Since server storage accounting can vary\
    \ so much, clients should\n   expect the following:\n   o  The size of a file\
    \ on the client's file system, or in a PUT\n      message, may not correspond\
    \ to the amount of storage required by\n      the server to store the resource.\
    \  Thus, the client cannot predict\n      with 100% accuracy whether a given file\
    \ will be allowed given the\n      storage quota.\n   o  Deleting or overwriting\
    \ a resource may not free up the same amount\n      of storage as indicated by\
    \ the DAV:getcontentlength property\n      defined in [RFC2518] for the resource.\
    \  If deleting a resource\n      does not free up any space, the file may have\
    \ been moved to a\n      \"trash\" folder or \"recycle bin\", or retained as in\
    \ versioning\n      systems ([RFC3253]).\n   o  Since there are many factors that\
    \ affect the storage used by a set\n      of resources, including automatic compression,\
    \ the size of\n      associated metadata, and server-inserted content (such as\
    \ that\n      created by PHP code) in the on-the-wire representation of\n    \
    \  resources, clients are advised not to depend on the value of DAV:\n      quota-used-bytes\
    \ being the sum of the DAV:getcontentlength\n      properties for resources contained\
    \ by a collection.\n   o  Additionally, because there may be a number of distinct\
    \ but\n      overlapping sets of resources for which a DAV:quota-used-bytes is\n\
    \      maintained (Section 4), there may be no correlation between the\n     \
    \ size of the resources in a collection and DAV:quota-used-bytes.\n      For example,\
    \ for a server that implements user-based quotas,\n      DAV:quota-used-bytes\
    \ usually will be the same for a collection and\n      its members.\n   o  On\
    \ some systems where quota is counted by collection and not by\n      user, a\
    \ quota on a sub-collection may be larger than the quota on\n      the parent\
    \ collection that contains it.  For example, the quota on\n      /~milele/ may\
    \ be 100 MB, but the quota on /~milele/public/ may be\n      unlimited.  This\
    \ allows the space used by /~milele/public/ to be\n      as large as the quota\
    \ on /~milele/ allows (depending on the other\n      contents of /~milele/) even\
    \ if the quota on /~milele/ is changed.\n      Thus, even when the quota on a\
    \ parent collection is changed, it is\n      not necessarily required to change\
    \ the quota on every child or\n      descendant collection.\n"
