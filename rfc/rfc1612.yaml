  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes a set of extensions which instrument DNS\n   resolver\
    \ functions.  This memo was produced by the DNS working group.\n   With the adoption\
    \ of the Internet-standard Network Management\n   Framework [4,5,6,7], and with\
    \ a large number of vendor\n   implementations of these standards in commercially\
    \ available\n   products, it became possible to provide a higher level of effective\n\
    \   network management in TCP/IP-based internets than was previously\n   available.\
    \  With the growth in the use of these standards, it has\n   become possible to\
    \ consider the management of other elements of the\n   infrastructure beyond the\
    \ basic TCP/IP protocols.  A key element of\n   the TCP/IP infrastructure is the\
    \ DNS.\n   Up to this point there has been no mechanism to integrate the\n   management\
    \ of the DNS with SNMP-based managers.  This memo provides\n   the mechanisms\
    \ by which IP-based management stations can effectively\n   manage DNS resolver\
    \ software in an integrated fashion.\n   We have defined DNS MIB objects to be\
    \ used in conjunction with the\n   Internet MIB to allow access to and control\
    \ of DNS resolver software\n   via SNMP by the Internet community.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o  RFC 1442\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n         describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.\n      o  STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,\
    \ the core set of managed\n         objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \      o  RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other\n         architectural\
    \ aspects of the framework.\n      o  RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used\
    \ for network access to\n         managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new\
    \ objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named\n   by\
    \ an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The\n   object type\
    \ together with an object instance serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific\
    \ instantiation of the object.  For human\n   convenience, we often use a textual\
    \ string, termed the descriptor, to\n   refer to the object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   In theory, the DNS world is pretty simple.  There are two kinds\
    \ of\n   entities: resolvers and name servers.  Resolvers ask questions.  Name\n\
    \   servers answer them.  The real world, however, is not so simple.\n   Implementors\
    \ have made widely differing choices about how to divide\n   DNS functions between\
    \ resolvers and servers.  They have also\n   constructed various sorts of exotic\
    \ hybrids.  The most difficult task\n   in defining this MIB was to accommodate\
    \ this wide range of entities\n   without having to come up with a separate MIB\
    \ for each.\n   We divided up the various DNS functions into two, non-overlapping\n\
    \   classes, called \"resolver functions\" and \"name server functions.\"  A\n\
    \   DNS entity that performs what we define as resolver functions\n   contains\
    \ a resolver, and therefore must implement the MIB groups\n   required of all\
    \ resolvers which are defined in this module.  Some\n   resolvers also implement\
    \ \"optional\" functions such as a cache, in\n   which case they must also implement\
    \ the cache group contained in this\n   MIB.  A DNS entity which implements name\
    \ server functions is\n   considered to be a name server, and must implement the\
    \ MIB groups\n   required for name servers which are defined in a separate module.\
    \  If\n   the same piece of software performs both resolver and server\n   functions,\
    \ we imagine that it contains both a resolver and a server\n   and would thus\
    \ implement both the DNS Server and DNS Resolver MIBs.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Resolvers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Resolvers\n   In our model, a resolver is a program (or piece thereof)\
    \ which\n   obtains resource records from servers.  Normally it does so at the\n\
    \   behest of an application, but may also do so as part of its own\n   operation.\
    \  A resolver sends DNS protocol queries and receives DNS\n   protocol replies.\
    \  A resolver neither receives queries nor sends\n   replies.  A full service\
    \ resolver is one that knows how to resolve\n   queries: it obtains the needed\
    \ resource records by contacting a\n   server authoritative for the records desired.\
    \  A stub resolver does\n   not know how to resolve queries: it sends all queries\
    \ to a local name\n   server, setting the \"recursion desired\" flag to indicate\
    \ that it\n   hopes that the name server will be willing to resolve the query.\
    \  A\n   resolver may (optionally) have a cache for remembering previously\n \
    \  acquired resource records.  It may also have a negative cache for\n   remembering\
    \ names or data that have been determined not to exist.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Name Servers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Name Servers\n   A name server is a program (or piece thereof) that provides\
    \ resource\n   records to resolvers.  All references in this document to \"a name\n\
    \   server\" imply \"the name server's role\"; in some cases the name\n   server's\
    \ role and the resolver's role might be combined into a single\n   program.  A\
    \ name server receives DNS protocol queries and sends DNS\n   protocol replies.\
    \  A name server neither sends queries nor receives\n   replies.  As a consequence,\
    \ name servers do not have caches.\n   Normally, a name server would expect to\
    \ receive only those queries to\n   which it could respond with authoritative\
    \ information.  However, if a\n   name server receives a query that it cannot\
    \ respond to with purely\n   authoritative information, it may choose to try to\
    \ obtain the\n   necessary additional information from a resolver which may or\
    \ may not\n   be a separate process.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Selected Objects
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Selected Objects\n   Many of the objects included in this memo have been\
    \ created from\n   information contained in the DNS specifications [1,2], as amended\
    \ and\n   clarified by subsequent host requirements documents [3].  Other\n  \
    \ objects have been created based on experience with existing DNS\n   management\
    \ tools, expected operational needs, the statistics\n   generated by existing\
    \ DNS implementations, and the configuration\n   files used by existing DNS implementations.\
    \  These objects have been\n   ordered into groups as follows:\n         o  Resolver\
    \ Configuration Group\n         o  Resolver Counter Group\n         o  Resolver\
    \ Lame Delegation Group\n         o  Resolver Cache Group\n         o  Resolver\
    \ Negative Cache Group\n         o  Resolver Optional Counter Group\n   This information\
    \ has been converted into a standard form using the\n   SNMPv2 SMI defined in\
    \ [9].  For the most part, the descriptions are\n   influenced by the DNS related\
    \ RFCs noted above.  For example, the\n   descriptions for counters used for the\
    \ various types of queries of\n   DNS records are influenced by the definitions\
    \ used for the various\n   record types found in [2].\n"
- title: 3.4.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Textual Conventions\n   Several conceptual data types have been introduced\
    \ as a textual\n   conventions in the DNS Server MIB document and have been imported\n\
    \   into this MIB module.  These additions will facilitate the common\n   understanding\
    \ of information used by the DNS.  No changes to the SMI\n   or the SNMP are necessary\
    \ to support these conventions.\n   Readers familiar with MIBs designed to manage\
    \ entities in the lower\n   layers of the Internet protocol suite may be surprised\
    \ at the number\n   of non-enumerated integers used in this MIB to represent values\
    \ such\n   as DNS RR class and type numbers.  The reason for this choice is\n\
    \   simple: the DNS itself is designed as an extensible protocol,\n   allowing\
    \ new classes and types of resource records to be added to the\n   protocol without\
    \ recoding the core DNS software.  Using non-\n   enumerated integers to represent\
    \ these data types in this MIB allows\n   the MIB to accommodate these changes\
    \ as well.\n"
