  - "Abstract\n   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol specifies the maximum time\n\
    \   allowed between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements\n   (RAs)\
    \ from a router interface as well as the maximum router lifetime.\n   It also\
    \ allows the limits to be overridden by documents that are\n   specific to the\
    \ link layer.  This document allows for overriding\n   these values on a per-link\
    \ basis.\n   This document specifies updates to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n\
    \   Protocol (RFC 4861) to increase the maximum time allowed between\n   sending\
    \ unsolicited multicast RAs from a router interface as well as\n   to increase\
    \ the maximum router lifetime.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on IP multicast based on\
    \ the\n   expectation that multicast makes efficient use of available bandwidth\n\
    \   and avoids generating interrupts in the network nodes.  On some data\n   link\
    \ layers, multicast may not be natively supported.  On such links,\n   any possible\
    \ reduction of multicast traffic will be highly\n   beneficial.  Unfortunately,\
    \ due to the fixed protocol constants\n   specified in [RFC4861], it is difficult\
    \ to relax the multicast timers\n   for Neighbor Discovery.  There are already\
    \ clarifications specific to\n   the link technology about how to tune the Neighbor\
    \ Discovery Protocol\n   (NDP) constants for certain systems in order to reduce\
    \ excess NDP\n   traffic.  For example, [RFC6459] and [RFC7066] contain such\n\
    \   clarifications for 3GPP cellular links.\n   This document specifies updates\
    \ to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery\n   Protocol [RFC4861] to increase the maximum\
    \ time allowed between\n   sending unsolicited multicast RAs from a router interface\
    \ as well as\n   to increase the maximum router lifetime.\n"

- title: 3.  Relationship between AdvDefaultLifetime and MaxRtrAdvInterval
  contents:
  - "3.  Relationship between AdvDefaultLifetime and MaxRtrAdvInterval\n   MaxRtrAdvInterval\
    \ is an upper bound on the time between which two\n   successive Router Advertisement\
    \ messages are sent.  Therefore, one\n   might reason about the relationship between\
    \ these two values in terms\n   of a ratio K = AdvDefaultLifetime / MaxRtrAdvInterval,\
    \ which\n   expresses how many Router Advertisements are guaranteed to be sent\n\
    \   before the router lifetime expires.\n   Assuming unicast Solicited Router\
    \ Advertisements or a perfectly\n   stable network, on a theoretically perfect\
    \ link with no losses, it\n   would be sufficient to have K just above 1, so that\
    \ the sent Router\n   Advertisement refreshes the router entry just before it\
    \ expires.  On\n   the real links that allow for some loss, one would need to\
    \ use K > 2\n   in order to minimize the chances of a single Router Advertisement\n\
    \   loss causing a loss of the router entry.\n   The exact calculation will depend\
    \ on the packet loss probability.  An\n   example: if we take a ballpark value\
    \ of 1% probability of a packet\n   loss, then K = 2 will give 0.01% chance of\
    \ an outage due to a packet\n   loss, K = 3 will give 0.0001% chance of an outage,\
    \ and so forth.  To\n   reverse the numbers, with these parameters, K ~= 1 gives\
    \ 99%\n   reliability, K ~= 2 gives 99.99% reliability, and K ~= 3 gives\n   99.9999%\
    \ reliability -- which should be good enough for a lot of\n   scenarios.\n   In\
    \ a network with higher packet loss probabilities or if higher\n   reliability\
    \ is desired, the K might be chosen to be even higher.  On\n   the other hand,\
    \ some of the data link layers provide reliable\n   delivery at Layer 2, so there\
    \ one might even consider using the\n   \"theoretical\" value of K just above\
    \ 1.  Since the choice of these two\n   parameters does not impact interoperability\
    \ per se, this document\n   does not impose any specific constraints on their\
    \ values other than\n   providing the guidelines in this section.  Therefore,\
    \ each individual\n   link can optimize according to its use case.\n   Also, AdvDefaultLifetime\
    \ MUST be set to a value greater than or equal\n   to the selected MaxRtrAdvInterval.\
    \  Otherwise, a router lifetime is\n   guaranteed to expire before the new Router\
    \ Advertisement has a chance\n   to be sent, thereby creating an outage.\n"
- title: 4.  Updates to RFC 4861
  contents:
  - "4.  Updates to RFC 4861\n   This document updates Sections 4.2 and 6.2.1 of [RFC4861]\
    \ to change\n   the following router configuration variables.\n   In Section 4.2,\
    \ inside the paragraph that defines Router Lifetime,\n   change 9000 to 65535\
    \ seconds.\n   In Section 6.2.1, inside the paragraph that defines\n   MaxRtrAdvInterval,\
    \ change 1800 to 65535 seconds.\n   In Section 6.2.1, inside the paragraph that\
    \ defines\n   AdvDefaultLifetime, change 9000 to 65535 seconds.\n   As explained\
    \ in Section 3, the probability of packet loss must be\n   considered when choosing\
    \ the relationship between MaxRtrAdvInterval\n   and AdvDefaultLifetime.\n"
- title: 5.  Host Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  Host Behavior\n   Legacy hosts on a link with updated routers may have issues\
    \ with a\n   Router Lifetime of more than 9000 seconds.  In the few\n   implementations\
    \ we have tested with general-purpose operating\n   systems, there does not seem\
    \ to be any issue with setting this field\n   to more than 9000, but there might\
    \ be implementations that\n   incorrectly reject such RAs (since RFC 4861 requires\
    \ receivers to\n   handle any value).\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   On a link where Router Advertisements are few\
    \ and far between, the\n   detrimental effects of a rogue router that sends an\
    \ unsolicited RA\n   are greatly increased.  These rogue RAs can be prevented\
    \ by using\n   approaches like RA-Guard [RFC6105] and SEcure Neighbor Discovery\n\
    \   (SEND) [RFC3971].\n"
