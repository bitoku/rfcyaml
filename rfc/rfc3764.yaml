  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 2916 [6]) is a system that\
    \ uses DNS\n   (Domain Name Service, STD 13, RFC 1034 [3]) to translate telephone\n\
    \   numbers, like '+12025332600', into URIs (Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers,\
    \ RFC 2396 [4]), like 'sip:egar@example.com'.  ENUM exists\n   primarily to facilitate\
    \ the interconnection of systems that rely on\n   telephone numbers with those\
    \ that use URIs to route transactions.\n   This document applies to the revised\
    \ version of ENUM described in RFC\n   3761.\n   SIP (Session Initiation Protocol,\
    \ RFC 3261 [2]) is a text-based\n   application protocol that allows endpoints\
    \ on the Internet to\n   discover one another in order to exchange context information\
    \ about a\n   session they would like to share.  Common forms of communication\
    \ that\n   are set up by SIP include Internet telephony, instant messaging,\n\
    \   video, Internet gaming and other forms of real-time communications.\n   SIP\
    \ is a multi-service protocol capable of initiating sessions\n   involving different\
    \ forms of real-time communications simultaneously.\n   SIP is a protocol that\
    \ finds the best way for parties to communicate.\n"

- title: 3.  Addresses-of-record in SIP
  contents:
  - "3.  Addresses-of-record in SIP\n   This document specifies an enumservice field\
    \ that is appropriate for\n   SIP addresses-of-record URIs.  Various other types\
    \ of URIs can be\n   present in SIP requests.  A URI that is associated with a\
    \ particular\n   SIP user agent (for example, a SIP phone) is commonly known as\
    \ a SIP\n   contact address.\n   The difference between a contact address and\
    \ an address-of-record is\n   like the difference between a device and its user.\
    \  While there is no\n   formal distinction in the syntax of these two forms of\
    \ addresses,\n   contact addresses are associated with a particular device, and\
    \ may\n   have a very device-specific form (like sip:10.0.0.1, or\n   sip:edgar@ua21.example.com).\
    \  An address-of-record, however,\n   represents an identity of the user, generally\
    \ a long-term identity,\n   and it does not have a dependency on any device; users\
    \ can move\n   between devices or even be associated with multiple devices at\
    \ one\n   time while retaining the same address-of-record.  A simple URI,\n  \
    \ generally of the form 'sip:egdar@example.com', is used for an\n   address-of-record.\n\
    \   When a SIP request is created by a user agent, it populates the\n   address-of-record\
    \ of its target in its To header field and\n   (generally) Request-URI.  The address-of-record\
    \ of the user that is\n   sending the request populates the From header field\
    \ of the message;\n   the contact address of the device from which the request\
    \ is sent is\n   listed in the Contact header field.\n   By sending a registration\
    \ to a registrar on behalf of its user, a SIP\n   device (i.e., a user agent)\
    \ can temporarily associate its own contact\n   address with the user's address-of-record.\
    \  In so doing, the device\n   becomes eligible to receive requests that are sent\
    \ to the address-\n   of-record.  Upon receiving the registration request, the\
    \ registrar\n   modifies the provisioning data in a SIP location service to create\
    \ a\n   mapping between the address-of-record for the user and the device\n  \
    \ where the user can currently be reached.  When future requests arrive\n   at\
    \ the administrative domain of this location service for the user in\n   question,\
    \ proxy servers ask the location service where to find the\n   user, and will\
    \ in turn discover the registered contact address(es).\n   A SIP-based follow-me\
    \ telephony service, for example, would rely on\n   this real-time availability\
    \ data in order to find the best place to\n   reach the end user without having\
    \ to cycle through numerous devices\n   from which the user is not currently registered.\
    \  Note that\n   addresses-of-record can be registered with other addresses-of-record;\n\
    \   for example, while at home, a user might elect to register the\n   address-of-record\
    \ they use as their personal identity under their\n   work address-of-record in\
    \ order to direct requests for their work\n   identity to whatever devices they\
    \ might have associated with their\n   home address-of-record.\n   When a SIP\
    \ entity (be it a user agent or proxy server) needs to make\n   a forwarding decision\
    \ for a Request-URI containing an address-of-\n   record, it uses the mechanisms\
    \ described in the SIP specification\n   (RFC 3263) to locate the proper resource\
    \ in the network.  Ordinarily,\n   this entails resolving the domain portion of\
    \ the URI (example.com in\n   the example above) in order to route the call to\
    \ a proxy server that\n   is responsible for that domain.\n   SIP user agents\
    \ have specific communications capabilities (such as\n   the ability to initiate\
    \ voice communications with particular codecs,\n   or support for particular SIP\
    \ protocol extensions).  Because an\n   address-of-record does not represent any\
    \ particular device or set of\n   devices, an address-of-record does not have\
    \ capabilities as such.\n   When a SIP user agent sends a request to an address-of-record,\
    \ it\n   begins a phase of capability negotiation that will eventually\n   discover\
    \ the best way for the originator to communicate with the\n   target.  The originating\
    \ user agent first expresses capabilities of\n   its own in the request it sends\
    \ (and preferences for the type of\n   session it would like to initiate).  The\
    \ expression of these\n   capabilities may entail the usage of SDP [8] to list\
    \ acceptable types\n   of media supported and favored by the client, the inclusion\
    \ of\n   Required/Supported headers to negotiate compatibility of extensions,\n\
    \   and possibly the usage of optional SIP extensions, for example using\n   callee\
    \ capabilities [7] to communicate request handling dispositions.\n   Proxy servers\
    \ or endpoints subsequently return responses that allow a\n   rich bidirectional\
    \ capability negotiation process.\n   The process by which SIP endpoints negotiate\
    \ capabilities can overlap\n   with the primary service provided by NAPTR records:\
    \ permitting the\n   originating client to select a particular URI for communications\n\
    \   based on an ordered list of enumservices.  However, ENUM's capability\n  \
    \ management mechanism is decidedly one-way - the administrator of the\n   telephone\
    \ number expresses capabilities (in the form of protocol\n   names) and preferences\
    \ that the client must evaluate without\n   negotiation.  Moreover, listing available\
    \ protocols is not comparable\n   to agreement on session media (down to the codec/interval\
    \ level) and\n   protocol extension support - it would be difficult to express,\
    \ in the\n   level of detail necessary to arrange a desired session, the\n   capabilities\
    \ of a SIP device within a NAPTR service field.\n   Provisioning contact addresses\
    \ in ENUM rather than addresses-of-\n   record would compromise the SIP capability\
    \ negotiation and discovery\n   process.  Much of the benefit of using a URI comes\
    \ from the fact that\n   it represents a logical service associated with a user,\
    \ rather than a\n   device - indeed, if ENUM wished to target particular devices,\n\
    \   'E2IPv4' would be a more appropriate resolution service to define\n   than\
    \ 'E2U'.\n   SIP addresses-of-record may use the SIP URI scheme or the SIPS URI\n\
    \   scheme.  The SIPS URI scheme, when used in an address-of-record,\n   indicates\
    \ that the user it represents can only be reached over a\n   secure connection\
    \ (using TLS).\n"
- title: 4.  The 'E2U+SIP' enumservice
  contents:
  - "4.  The 'E2U+SIP' enumservice\n   Traditionally, the services field of a NAPTR\
    \ record (as defined in\n   [5]) contains a string that is composed of two subfields:\
    \ a\n   'protocol' subfield and a 'resolution service' subfield.  ENUM in\n  \
    \ particular defines an 'E2U' (E.164 to URI) resolution service.  This\n   document\
    \ defines an 'E2U+SIP' enumservice for SIP.\n   The scheme of the URI that will\
    \ appear in the regexp field of a NAPTR\n   record using the 'E2U+SIP' enumservice\
    \ may either be 'SIP' or 'SIPS'.\n   This enumservice is best suited to SIP addresses-of-record.\n\
    \   When a SIP address-of-record appears in the regexp field of a NAPTR\n   record,\
    \ there is no need to further qualify the enumservice field\n   with any capability\
    \ data, since addresses-of-record do not have\n   capabilities.\n   There is also\
    \ generally no need to have more than one NAPTR record\n   under a single telephone\
    \ number that points to a SIP address-of-\n   record.\n   Note that the user portion\
    \ of a SIP URI may contain a telephone\n   number (e.g., 'sip:+1442079460148@example.com').\
    \  Clients should be\n   careful to avoid infinite loops when recursively performing\
    \ ENUM\n   queries on URIs that result from an ENUM lookup.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A SIP address-of-record is a canonical address\
    \ by which a user is\n   known - placing this address in ENUM is comparable to\
    \ placing an\n   email address or a similar URI in the DNS.\n   DNS does not make\
    \ policy decisions about the records that it shares\n   with an inquirer.  All\
    \ DNS records must be assumed to be available to\n   all inquirers at all times.\
    \  The information provided within an ENUM\n   record set must therefore be considered\
    \ to be open to the public -\n   which is a cause for some privacy considerations.\n\
    \   Unlike a traditional telephone number, the resource identified by a\n   SIP\
    \ URI may require that callers provide cryptographic credentials\n   for authentication\
    \ and authorization before a user is alerted.  In\n   this respect, ENUM in concert\
    \ with SIP can actually provide far\n   greater protection from unwanted callers\
    \ than the existing PSTN,\n   despite the public availability of ENUM records.\
    \  An analysis of\n   threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS, and\
    \ the\n   applicability of DNSSEC [9] to these, is provided in [1].\n"
