  - "Abstract\n   This memo provides an overview to the new Internet User.  The\n\
    \   intended audience is the common Internet user of today, thus it\n   attempts\
    \ to provide a more consumer oriented approach to the Internet\n   rather than\
    \ going into any depth about a topic.  Unlike its\n   predecessors, this edition\
    \ seeks to answer the general questions that\n   an unsophisticated consumer would\
    \ ask as opposed to the more pointed\n   questions of a more technically sophisticated\
    \ Internet user.  Those\n   desiring a more in-depth discussion are directed to\
    \ FYI 7 that deals\n   with intermediate and advanced Q/A topics.  A conscious\
    \ effort has\n   been made to keep this memo brief but at the same time provide\
    \ the\n   new user with enough information to generally understand the\n   Internet.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1. What is the Internet?\n   People use computers to perform a wide assortment\
    \ of tasks.  A\n   connected group of computers is known as a network. Because\
    \ people\n   are connected via this network, they can use their computers to\n\
    \   exchange ideas and information.  Some computers are connected\n   directly\
    \ to the network while others (primarily those in homes) are\n   connected via\
    \ a telephone line and a communication device known as a\n   modem.  By connecting\
    \ networks together with specialized computers\n   known as routers, people on\
    \ one network can engage in activities with\n   people on other networks.  This\
    \ INTER-connected group of NETworks is\n   known as the INTERNET.\n"
- title: 2.2. What Can I do on the Internet?
  contents:
  - "2.2. What Can I do on the Internet?\n   There is a large variety of activities\
    \ that users can do on the\n   Internet.  These activities include surfing, searching,\
    \ sending mail,\n   transfering programs and documents, chatting, and playing\
    \ games.\n   SURFING\n   Surfing is one of the most popular Internet activities.\
    \ To surf, a\n   user needs a program known as a web browser.  The web browser\
    \ enables\n   the user to connect to a location that contains information.  Many\n\
    \   locations contain links to other sites that contain related\n   information.\
    \  These links are usually identified by underlined text\n   that is of a different\
    \ color from the rest of the text in an article.\n   By clicking on one of these\
    \ links the user is then connected to that\n   information.  This information\
    \ may be at the same location or may be\n   at a different location.  This new\
    \ information may, in turn, have\n   links to other information.  So just like\
    \ a footnote or reference in\n   a print publication, links can be used to find\
    \ related or non-related\n   information.\n   SEARCHING\n   Searching involves\
    \ using a special program known as a seach engine.\n   There are several of these\
    \ engines that are located at various search\n   sites.  The popular web browsers\
    \ have location information about\n   these search sites.  Searching is similar\
    \ to using a card catalog in\n   a library.  Just as a person would look up a\
    \ topic in a card catalog\n   and find one or more references to that topic with\
    \ library location\n   information, a search engine provides the user with a list\
    \ of sites\n   that may contain relevant information.  This list is actually a\
    \ set\n   of links to these sites so that all the user has to do is click on\n\
    \   the link to go to the location.  Just as different library card\n   catalogs\
    \ will contain different reference cards, different search\n   engines will provide\
    \ different reference lists.\n   E-MAIL\n   E-mail is another very popular activity.\
    \  It is very similar to\n   sending letters through the post office or notes\
    \ and memos around the\n   office.  It is used to exchange messages between two\
    \ or more people.\n   Because email can be misunderstood or abused, users should\
    \ be\n   familiar with email netiquette.  For more information see Netiquette\n\
    \   Guidelines [FYI 28, RFC 1855].\n   Many people also participate in mailing\
    \ lists.  Usually a mailing\n   list is dedicated to a particular topic or interest.\
    \  Some mailing\n   lists are used to provide information to subscribers, such\
    \ as product\n   update information for something an individual may have purchased\n\
    \   while others are used for discussion.  In the latter instance people\n   participate\
    \ in the discussion by sending email to a \"list\" address\n   which in turn distributes\
    \ it to all members of a list.  Abuse of mail\n   lists is probably the biggest\
    \ source of junk email (also known as\n   \"spam\").  Everyone should take care\
    \ that they aren't the source of\n   junk mail.\n   FILE TRANSFER\n   Programs\
    \ and documents are transferred in several ways.  The most\n   common way this\
    \ is done between individual users is to attach the\n   program or document to\
    \ an e-mail message.  Programs and documents are\n   usually transferred from\
    \ sites to users using the save feature of a\n   web browser or the file transfer\
    \ protocol (FTP).   Such transfers\n   enable users to obtain a variety of programs,\
    \ documents, audio files,\n   and video files.\n   CHAT\n   Chat takes place between\
    \ one or more persons who are on the Internet.\n   Chatting is very similar to\
    \ going to a party.  Just as people\n   congregate in small groups and discuss\
    \ things, chatters meet in chat\n   rooms to discuss a topic.  Chat rooms are\
    \ generally sponsored or\n   operated by an organization that has an interest\
    \ in the topic area.\n   For example, an online news organization would have a\
    \ chat room for\n   chatters to discuss current events.  To chat one person writes\
    \ a\n   message which can be read, as it is being written, by the others who\n\
    \   can respond to it in turn.  First time chatters should be aware that\n   just\
    \ as at a party where some people never say anything, so there may\n   be people\
    \ in the room who are just listening.  Also, just like at a\n   party, some people\
    \ may portray themselves to be someone different\n   than who they really are.\
    \  Lastly, remember that chatters come and go\n   to chat rooms the same way people\
    \ move about groups at a party.\n   GAMES\n   Some people use the Internet to\
    \ play games. These games can be role\n   playing games, action/adventure games,\
    \ or online versions of old\n   standbys like chess.  Some games require the user\
    \ to purchase a copy\n   of the game and install it on their computer, while others\
    \ are played\n   by going to a game site.  Just like other forms of game playing,\n\
    \   Internet game playing can be challenging, entertaining, and an\n   enjoyable\
    \ social experience.  Don't be afraid to have fun.\n   OTHER ACTIVITIES\n   Other\
    \ popular activities include electronic shopping, banking, and\n   investing.\
    \  Many retailers describe and display pictures of their\n   products on the Internet\
    \ enabling people to buy on line.  Shopping\n   also includes purchasing services\
    \ such as an airline ticket or\n   ordering groceries.  Many banks allow people\
    \ to transfer funds, check\n   available funds, pay bills and other such activities\
    \ while on the\n   Internet with an account number and ID. Lastly, many people\
    \ invest\n   while on the Internet in everything from stocks and bonds to real\n\
    \   estate.  One word of caution, if you are using a credit card, check\n   to\
    \ see if there are security features in place to protect your credit\n   card\
    \ information.  Reputable sites should tell you how they are\n   protecting your\
    \ information. If you are in doubt about how your\n   information will be protected,\
    \ don't use your credit card at that\n   site.\n"
- title: 2.3. What is an Address?
  contents:
  - "2.3. What is an Address?\n   Two commonly asked questions these days are \"What's\
    \ your e-mail\n   address?\" and \"What's the URL?\"  Generally, the first question\
    \ is\n   asking where to send information, while the second is asking where to\n\
    \   get information.  The answer to the first question is usually\n   something\
    \ like myname@company.com.  The answer to the second question\n   is usually something\
    \ like \"http://www.newspaper.com\".  What do these\n   answers mean?\n   E-MAIL\
    \ ADDRESS\n   As stated previously an e-mail address is something like\n   \"\
    myname@company.com\", pronounced \"MYNAME at COMPANY dot COM\".  An\n   email\
    \ address consists of two parts that are divided by an \"@\" sign.\n   The portion\
    \ to the left is like the name line on a letter, it\n   identifies a particular\
    \ person and usually is composed of the\n   person's name.  Typical names look\
    \ like this:\n     john_doe\n     john.doe\n     jdoe\n     doej\n   The name\
    \ is assigned by the system or network adminstrator who is\n   managing the email\
    \ system and follows rules that have been\n   established by the company providing\
    \ the e-mail service.  Sometimes\n   the name portion of the e-mail address is\
    \ referred to as a mailbox.\n   The portion to the right of the \"@\" sign is\
    \ the name of the computer\n   system that is providing the e-mail service.  This\
    \ name is usually\n   the name of the company that owns the computer system followed\
    \ by a\n   \"dot\" and an abbreviation that represents the \"domain\" or group\
    \ of\n   names which the organization falls under.  Examples of these \"top\n\
    \   level\" domains are \"edu\", \"com\", and country codes such as \"fr\" for\n\
    \   France and \"jp\" for Japan.  When an e-mail is sent the portion of the\n\
    \   address to the right of the \"@\" sign is used to find the destination\n \
    \  computer of the email.\n   URL\n   A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is commonly\
    \ used to identify a\n   computer that provides world wide web service.  It usually\
    \ looks\n   something like \"http://www.newspaper.com\".  This address also\n\
    \   consists of two parts.  In this case the two parts are separated by\n   the\
    \ \"//\".  The portion to the left means find the world wide web\n   service that\
    \ is located at the computer identified to the right of\n   the \"//\".  The portion\
    \ to the right is the name of the computer that\n   is providing the world wide\
    \ web service.  Its name is composed of\n   parts that are similar to those described\
    \ for the name of an email\n   computer.  Sometimes the portion on the right contains\
    \ additional\n   information that identifies a particular document at the web\
    \ site.\n   For example, http://www.newspaper.com/sports/article1.html would\n\
    \   identify a specific article in the sports section of the newspaper.\n"
- title: 2.4. Are There Any Rules of Behavior on the Internet?
  contents:
  - "2.4. Are There Any Rules of Behavior on the Internet?\n   In general, common\
    \ sense, courtesy, and decency govern good Internet\n   behavior. There is no\
    \ single formal rulebook that governs behavior on\n   the Internet. FYI 28 that\
    \ was mentioned previously is a good guide.\n   Many activities such as game sites,\
    \ chat rooms, or e-mail lists may\n   have rules of their own.  What may be acceptable\
    \ behavior in one chat\n   room may be totally out of bounds in another.  It never\
    \ hurts to\n   check the water temperature before jumping in the pool.  Users\
    \ should\n   use the same precautions before joining in any online activity.\n\
    \   E-mail in particular can lead to misunderstandings between people.\n   Users\
    \ should remember that the reader only has the text to determine\n   what is being\
    \ said.  Other conversation cues such as \"tone of voice\"\n   and body signals\
    \ like winking are not present in the text.  Because\n   of this, users of the\
    \ Internet have developed cues to put in the\n   text.  Text techniques such as\
    \ capitalization and symbols known as\n   emoticons (also called \"smilies\")\
    \ are used.\n                   A typical smiley looks like this  :-)\n   Additionally,\
    \ acronyms have evolved over time (for example IMHO - In\n   My Humble Opinion).\
    \  More information about this can be found by\n   searching.  Use keywords like\
    \ \"netiquette\" and \"emoticon\" with your\n   search engine to find more information.\n\
    \   Users should also be aware that their particular programs such as\n   word\
    \ processors or e-mail might produce documents and messages that\n   are not readable\
    \ by everyone.  Very often, a reader must have the\n   same program in which a\
    \ document was written in order to read it.\n   So, before sending an attached\
    \ document, it is a good idea to make\n   sure that the intended receiver of your\
    \ document has the capability\n   to read it.  If in doubt, send a text (ascii)\
    \ version of the\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.5. How Does the Internet Work?
  contents:
  - "2.5. How Does the Internet Work?\n   Each of the activities mentioned in the\
    \ section describing what one\n   can do on the Internet requires that computers\
    \ exchange information.\n   Computers take turns sending and receiving information.\
    \  When a\n   computer is sending information, it is known as the \"source\";\
    \ when it\n   is receiving information, it is known as the \"destination.\"  (The\n\
    \   same computer can be both a source and destination at different\n   times.\
    \  This is especially clear when one thinks of sending and\n   receiving e-mail.)\n\
    \   Every computer on the Internet has a unique Internet \"address\" that\n  \
    \ identifies it from among the millions of computers.  The Internet has\n   specialized\
    \ computers between the source and destination located at\n   network inter-connection\
    \ points.  These computers are known as\n   \"routers.\"  The routers understand\
    \ how to use a computer's address to\n   appropriately point information from\
    \ one computer to another over the\n   Internet.\n   In an exchange of information\
    \ the following occurs:\n     *  The source finds the address of the destination.\n\
    \     *  The source contacts the destination and says \"hello\".\n     *  The\
    \ destination responds back with a \"hello\" of its own.\n     *  The source tells\
    \ the destination that it has information to\n        send.\n     *  The destination\
    \ tells the source that it is ready to receive the\n        information.\n   \
    \  *  The source breaks the information into small pieces called\n        packets\
    \ and sends each packet on its way to the destination.\n     *  The routers guide\
    \ each packet to the destination.\n     *  The destination takes the packets and\
    \ puts them back together to\n        form the information.\n     *  The destination\
    \ tells the source that it has received the\n        information and asks the\
    \ source if it has anything more to send.\n     *  If the source says no, the\
    \ destination will say \"good bye\"\n        unless it has something to send back.\
    \  If it does, it will break\n        the information into packets and send them.\n\
    \     *  Once both end users are done \"talking\", they say both say \"good\n\
    \        bye\".\n   Clearly our simplified introduction to this section did not\
    \ explain\n   many steps in this process, such as how a computer discovers the\n\
    \   address of another computer or how packets are divided and\n   reassembled.\
    \  Fortunately, these are specifics that people using the\n   Internet never really\
    \ need to deal with!\n"
- title: 2.6  Who Runs the Internet?
  contents:
  - "2.6  Who Runs the Internet?\n   No one.  The Internet is a cooperative effort\
    \ among Internet Service\n   Providers (ISPs), software companies, volunteer organizations,\
    \ and a\n   few facilities that tie the whole thing together.  The ISPs and\n\
    \   software companies are completely independent and most of them\n   compete\
    \ with each other.  The ISPs provide internet service to people\n   much the same\
    \ way that they obtain telephone service from a telephone\n   company.  ISPs agree\
    \ to connect their networks to each other and\n   transmit information following\
    \ an established set of rules\n   (protocols).  The software companies agree to\
    \ manufacture programs\n   (such as email or web browsers) that also follow protocols.\
    \  There\n   are other organizations that keep things straight.  Some assign\n\
    \   Internet addresses in much the same manner as telephone numbers are\n   assigned,\
    \ others keep track of names used by Internet users and\n   groups, and a large\
    \ volunteer organization called the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ develops the protocols computers follow\n   to make network communications succeed.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   The question \"is the Internet secure?\" can be\
    \ a confusing one for\n   people, who will hear many assurances that it is secure\
    \ and many\n   scary stories saying it is not secure.  There are a few basic rules\n\
    \   of thumb to remember that will address most concerns.\n   First, make it a\
    \ rule never to share account passwords with anyone.\n   Learning a password is\
    \ the easiest way for someone to break into a\n   system.  Most people feel that\
    \ their files are not that interesting\n   to anyone, but someone may be able\
    \ to get a foothold from one\n   innocuous account to other places in the same\
    \ computer system.  Many\n   good security practices can be found in the User's\
    \ Security Handbook\n   [FYI 34, RFC 2504].\n   Second, understand that there\
    \ are means for people to track the\n   information a user sends via email, the\
    \ files one downloads, and the\n   sites visited on the web.  The system administrators\
    \ and network\n   engineers who oversee a sites' computers require access to\n\
    \   information that an individual may think is secret.  In practice, no\n   responsible\
    \ system administrator or network engineer will violate a\n   person's privacy\
    \ out of personal curiosity.  However, if someone less\n   legitimate attains\
    \ illegal access to a system, they also will have\n   access to this information.\
    \  This situation is not a problem for most\n   people, but it should be understood\
    \ that things like email sent a\n   year ago or a log of users web pages browsed\
    \ may still exist in some\n   system's backup archive tape and can be easily resurrected\
    \ and\n   published widely.\n   Third, before giving personal information over\
    \ the Internet, such as\n   filling in a form on a Web page, users should realize\
    \ that there is\n   no assurance of confidentiality or privacy.   It could be\
    \ compared to\n   faxing such information to a party that you've never dealt with\n\
    \   before.  While many organizations on the Internet are responsible\n   with\
    \ information received via the web and email, this cannot always\n   be determined\
    \ in advance.\n"
