    - "3.2.  Interface Instance ID Values\n   The following OSPFv2 Instance IDs have
      been defined:\n   0      Base IPv4 Instance - This is the default IPv4 routing
      instance\n          corresponding to default IPv4 unicast routing and the\n
      \         attendant IPv4 routing table.  Use of this Instance ID\n          provides
      backward compatibility with the base OSPF\n          specification [OSPFV2].\n
      \  1      Base IPv4 Multicast Instance - This IPv4 instance corresponds\n          to
      the separate IPv4 routing table used for the Reverse Path\n          Forwarding
      (RPF) checking performed on IPv4 multicast traffic.\n   2      Base IPv4 In-band
      Management Instance - This IPv4 instance\n          corresponds to a separate
      IPv4 routing table used for network\n          management applications.\n   3-127
      \ Private Use - These Instance IDs are reserved for definition\n          and
      semantics defined by the local network administrator.  For\n          example,
      separate Interface Instance IDs and their\n          corresponding OSPFv2 instances
      could be used to support\n          independent non-congruent topologies for
      different classes of\n          IPv4 unicast traffic.  The details of such deployments
      are\n          beyond the scope of this document.\n   The first three Interface
      Instance IDs are analogous to the topology\n   IDs defined in [RFC4915].\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  OSPFv2 Authentication Impacts\n   Now that the AuType OSPFv2 header field
    has been reduced from 2\n   octets to 1 octet, OSPFv2 routers not supporting this
    specification\n   will fail packet authentication for any instance other than
    the\n   default (i.e., the Base IPv4 Unicast Instance).  This is solely due\n
    \  to the difference in field definition as opposed to any explicit\n   change
    to OSPFv2 authentication, as described in Appendix D of RFC\n   2328 [OSPFV2]
    and RFC 5709 [RFC5709].  However, this is exactly what\n   is desired since OSPFv2
    routers not supporting this specification\n   should only support the default
    instance (refer to Section 6).\n"
  title: 5.  OSPFv2 Authentication Impacts
- contents:
  - "6.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment Considerations\n   When there are OSPFv2
    routers that support OSPFv2 Multi-Instance\n   extensions on the same broadcast-capable
    interface as OSPFv2 routers\n   that do not, packets with non-zero OSPFv2 header
    Instance IDs are\n   received by those legacy OSPFv2 routers.  Since the non-zero
    Instance\n   ID is included in the AuType by these legacy OSPFv2 routers, it is\n
    \  misinterpreted as a mismatched authentication type and the packet is\n   dropped.
    \ This is exactly what is expected and desired.\n   Previously, there was concern
    that certain implementations would log\n   every single authentication type mismatch.
    \ However, discussions with\n   implementers have led us to the conclusion that
    this is not as severe\n   a problem as we'd first thought, and it will be even
    less of a\n   problem by the time the mechanism described herein is standardized,\n
    \  implemented, and deployed.  Most implementations will dampen the\n   logging
    of errors.  Hence, the more drastic mechanisms to avoid\n   legacy OSPFv2 routers
    from receiving multicast OSPFv2 packets with\n   non-zero Instance IDs have been
    removed.\n   If the OSPF MIB as specified in [OSPF-MIB] is implemented, even the\n
    \  damped generation of the ospfIfAuthFailure or ospfVirtIfAuthFailure\n   Simple
    Network Management Protocol (SNMP) notifications would be\n   undesirable in situations
    where legacy OSPFv2 routers are deployed on\n   the same subnet as OSPFv2 routers
    supporting this specification.\n   Consequently, it is recommended that implementations
    that implement\n   this specification and the OSPF MIB also implement SNMP Notification\n
    \  filtering as specified in Section 6 of [RFC3413].\n"
  title: 6.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The enhancement described herein doesn't include
    additional security\n   considerations to OSPFv2.  Security considerations for
    OSPFv2 are\n   described in [OSPFV2].\n   Given that only three OSPFv2 authentication
    types have been\n   standardized, it seems reasonable to reduce the OSPFv2 packet
    header\n   field to 8 bits.\n"
  title: 7.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   The size of the AuType field is reduced from 16 octets
    to 8 octets.\n   This changes the OSPF Authentication Codes registry in that the\n
    \  values 256-65535 are no longer defined and are therefore deprecated.\n   There
    is no backward compatibility issue since this range of values\n   was previously
    defined as \"Reserved and should not be assigned\".\n   A new registry has been
    created for OSPFv2 Instance IDs.  The initial\n   allocation of OSPFv2 Instance
