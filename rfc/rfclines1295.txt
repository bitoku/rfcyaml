Abstract This RFC is a near verbatim copy of a document, known as NADF 265, which has been produced by the North American Directory Forum (NADF).
User Bill of Rights for entries and listings in the Public Directory
The mission of the North American Directory Forum is to provide interconnected electronic directories which empower users with unprecedented access to public information.
To address significant security and privacy issues, the North American Directory Forum introduces the following "User Bill of Rights" for entries in the Public Directory.
As a user, you have: I.
The right not to be listed.
The right to have you or your agent informed when your entry is created.
The right to examine your entry.
The right to correct inaccurate information in your entry.
The right to remove specific information from your entry.
The right to be assured that your listing in the Public Directory will comply with US or Canadian law regulating privacy or access information.
The right to expect timely fulfillment of these rights.
Scope of Intent User Bill of Rights
The North American Directory Forum is a collection of service providers that plan to offer a cooperative directory service in North America.
This is achieved by interconnecting electronic directories using a set of internationally developed standards known as the CCITT X.500 series.
In this context, the "Directory" represents the collection of electronic directories administered by both service providers and private operators.
When an entry containing information about a user is listed in the Directory, that information can be accessed unless restricted by security and privacy controls.
A portion of the Directory
The Public Directory   contains information for public dissemination.
In contrast, other portions of the Directory may contain information not intended for public access.
A user or user's agent may elect to list information in the Public Directory, a private directory, or some combination.
For example, a user might publicly list a telephone number or an electronic mail address, and might designate other information for specific private use.
The User Bill of Rights pertains to the Public Directory.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
