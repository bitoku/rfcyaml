  - "1.  Introduction\n   Kerberos Version 5 [RFC4120] is a trusted third-party authentication\n\
    \   system.  Each organization wishing to use Kerberos establishes its\n   own\
    \ \"realm\", and each client is registered as part of that realm.  At\n   least\
    \ one Key Distribution Center (KDC) is required for the operation\n   of a Kerberos\
    \ realm.\n   When a client wishes to communicate with, and be authenticated to,\
    \ a\n   Kerberos application server (also a client of the KDC), the client\n \
    \  identifies itself, and its realm, to the KDC and acquires a\n   credential\
    \ from the KDC.  The client then presents the credential to\n   the Kerberos application\
    \ server, which can use the credential to\n   authenticate the client.  The client\
    \ needs to know at least one IP\n   address for a KDC in order to initiate this\
    \ process.\n   One example of the application of this protocol is as follows.\
    \  A\n   student might want to use a shared, public workstation, one that is\n\
    \   not configured for Kerberos.  If there is a mechanism for the\n   workstation\
    \ to obtain a realm name and IP address for a KDC, then a\n   student need only\
    \ input a user-id and pass phrase to be able to use\n   Kerberos.\n   The Kerberos\
    \ V5 specification [RFC4120] defines the use of DNS SRV\n   records [RFC2782]\
    \ for KDC discovery.  Some systems, such as\n   industrial systems, do not use\
    \ DNS.  Such systems already have their\n   own name spaces and their own name\
    \ resolution systems, including\n   preconfigured mapping tables for devices,\
    \ and do not use Fully\n   Qualified Domain Names.  However, many of these systems\
    \ do use DHCP.\n   Adding a DNS server to such systems may decrease the reliability\
    \ of\n   the system and increase the management cost.  In such an environment,\n\
    \   another mechanism is needed to provide an IP address for the KDC.\n   For\
    \ the PacketCable Architecture [PCARCH], RFC 3634 [RFC3634] defines\n   the KDC\
    \ Server Address sub-option for the DHCPv4 CableLabs Client\n   Configuration\
    \ option.  However, a mechanism is still needed to\n   provide a realm name and\
    \ an IPv6 address -- one that does not depend\n   on any external architecture.\n\
    \   This document defines a Kerberos option for DHCPv6 that provides a\n   realm\
    \ name and/or a list of KDC IP addresses.  This option does not\n   replace or\
    \ modify any of the existing methods for obtaining this\n   information.\n"

    \ a principal name.\n   If a client requires a realm name, the client sends a\
    \ DHCPv6 Option\n   Request Option (ORO) specifying the Kerberos Default Realm\
    \ Name\n   Option.  The DHCPv6 server responds with a Reply message containing\
    \ a\n   Kerberos Default Realm Name Option.\n   If a client requires configuration\
    \ parameters for a KDC, the client\n   sends a DHCPv6 ORO specifying the Kerberos\
    \ KDC Option.  The client\n   MAY include a Kerberos Principal Name Option.  The\
    \ client MAY include\n   a Kerberos Realm Name Option.\n   The DHCPv6 server replies\
    \ with one or more sets of configuration\n   parameters for a Kerberos KDC.  If\
    \ the client has specified either a\n   Kerberos Principal Name Option or a Kerberos\
    \ Realm Name Option, then\n   the DHCPv6 server MAY use those parameters to select\
    \ specific sets of\n   configuration parameters.\n   Where the server replies\
    \ with more than one set of configuration\n   parameters, the usage of the Priority\
    \ and Weight fields by the client\n   MUST follow the specification for DNS SRV\
    \ [RFC2782].\n   The client MAY include other options with data values as hints\
    \ to the\n   DHCPv6 server about parameter values the client would like to have\n\
    \   returned; this is specified in Section 18.1.5 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].\n"

    \   document, the choice of method is determined by local policy.  The\n   administrator\
    \ of the realm usually defines the method as part of the\n   configuration of\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in RFC 3315 [RFC3315]\
    \ apply.\n   DHCPv6 messages can be modified in transit.  If an adversary modifies\n\
    \   the response from a DHCPv6 server or injects its own response, a\n   client\
    \ may be led into contacting a malicious KDC.  Both cases are\n   categorized\
    \ as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.  However, a\n   malicious KDC does not\
    \ know the shared key and so is unable to\n   proceed any further with the exchange.\
    \  If a client receives a\n   response from such a KDC, the client can use the\
    \ shared key to detect\n   that the message originates from a malicious KDC.\n\
    \   A shared, unconfigured workstation may obtain its KDC information,\n   and\
    \ default realm, via DHCPv6.  Such a workstation may not have a\n   host or other\
    \ service key, and thus it may be unable to validate the\n   Ticket-Granting Ticket\
    \ issued by the KDC.  A modified DHCPv6 response\n   would then result in the\
    \ workstation talking to a malicious KDC, and\n   the workstation would not be\
    \ able to detect that this has happened.\n   This in turn could allow access by\
    \ unauthorized users.\n   To minimize potential vulnerabilities, a client SHOULD\
    \ use DHCPv6\n   authentication as defined in Section 21 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].\n\
    \   Kerberos information may be manually configured on the client before\n   requesting\
    \ information from DHCPv6.  Manual configuration of the\n   device SHOULD be preferred\
    \ to configuration via the DHCPv6 server.\n"
