- title: Abstract

  - "Abstract\n   INETPhone is a true telephone service through the Internet. It\n\
    \   integrates the local telephone networks and the Internet using\n   INETPhone\
    \ servers. Thus a long distance call can be split into two\n   local calls and\
    \ an Internet connection, which is transparent to end\n   users. Such a phone\
    \ service through Internet will be a major step\n   towards integrated services\
    \ on Internet. In order to support the\n   INETPhone and lay down the ground rules\
    \ of the service, a scheme of\n   \"open partnership\" is proposed, so that the\
    \ entire Internet community\n   can have the equal opportunity and benefits from\
    \ the INETPhone\n   service.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The success of traditional Internet services, such as the\
    \ electronic\n   mail, the file transfer, and the remote machine access, has inspired\n\
    \   a row of new network applications -- the world-wide information web,\n   voice\
    \ and video conferencing, and network telemarketing are just a\n   few to mention.\
    \  With the further development in infrastructure and\n   the architecture of\
    \ integrated, multimedia information services\n   [1,2,3], certainly the Internet\
    \ will play a crucial role in shaping\n   up the future of so-called information\
    \ super-highway.\n   Among many new applications, the voice communication through\
    \ Internet\n   bears perhaps the most potential impact, since it competes directly\n\
    \   with the telephone communication, which has become an indispensable\n   part\
    \ of the modern society.  Recently, many software packages are\n   available,\
    \ either commercially or as public free-ware, which supports\n   voice communication\
    \ on Internet.  Some of these products are targeted\n   directly as possible substitution\
    \ for long distance telephone\n   services.  However, so far, all such products\
    \ only support voice\n   communications using a computer that is on the Internet\
    \ or is\n   connected, via a SLIP link, to the Internet [4].\n   This RFC presents\
    \ a true telephone service, called INETPhone, which\n   supports voice communication\
    \ through the Internet.  INETPhone\n   integrates the local phone network with\
    \ the Internet. The phone\n   network provides local access of INETPhone service\
    \ with the existing\n   telephone facilities, whereas the Internet delivers the\
    \ packets of\n   voice communication over long distances.  The service of INETPhone\
    \ is\n   illustrated by the following scenario.  Assuming a user at area A\n \
    \  wants to call another user in area B. The user first makes a local\n   call\
    \ to an INETPhone server in area A. After the connection, the user\n   keys in\
    \ the remote phone number in area B to the server. Then the\n   server in area\
    \ A makes a connection to another INETPhone server in\n   area B, and requests\
    \ the remote server to dial, as a local call, the\n   phone number in area B.\
    \ Therefore, a long distance phone connection\n   between users in area A and\
    \ B is established via two local phone\n   connections and one Internet connection\
    \ between two INETPhone\n   servers.\n   The INETPhone provides a general service\
    \ of voice communication on\n   Internet compatible to the existing telephone\
    \ service.  The\n   motivation in developing and experimenting the INETPhone service\
    \ can\n   be two-folds: on the one hand, a general telephone service on the\n\
    \   Internet will be a major step towards integrated services on Internet\n  \
    \ and a great challenge to the future development of Internet\n   infrastructure\
    \ and protocol architecture; on the other hand, the\n   entire Internet community\
    \ can take the advantage from the cheap and\n   convenient voice communication\
    \ of the INETPhone service.\n"
- title: 2. Design Philosophy
  contents:
  - "2. Design Philosophy\n   The design philosophy of the INETPhone differs from\
    \ the most of\n   current voice communication services on Internet in three basic\n\
    \   aspects: integrating the existing telephone networks with the\n   Internet;\
    \ using the INETPhone servers to carry out the task of voice\n   packet delivery\
    \ on Internet; and an open-partnership of establishing\n   the INETPhone service\
    \ on Internet.  The discussion of each of these\n   aspects is given as follows.\n\
    \   The conventional telephone service is the most popular and convenient\n  \
    \ means for voice communication across distances. Any serious effort to\n   integrate\
    \ voice communication on the Internet should take the full\n   advantage of this\
    \ well-established service.  The INETPhone bridges\n   the existing telephone\
    \ network with the Internet, so that the access\n   of the INETPhone service will\
    \ be totally based on the local phone\n   services and facilities. This will lead\
    \ to a much easier access and\n   broader user population than the approaches\
    \ of computer-based access.\n   The INETPhone service is based on the client-server\
    \ model, in which a\n   group of INETPhone servers are responsible for accepting/initiating\n\
    \   local calls and deliverying voice packets across the Internet.  The\n   general\
    \ users (as clients) can easily access the service through a\n   conventional\
    \ phone with a local call. The creation of such INETPhone\n   servers eases the\
    \ burden from general users, and provides services of\n   voice communication\
    \ on the Internet in a more efficient and\n   manageable manner.\n   Hundreds\
    \ even thousands of INETPhone servers will be required for the\n   wide coverage\
    \ of INETPhone services on the Internet (to cover all\n   areas within US, at\
    \ least one server needs to be installed in each\n   area of phone area code).\
    \  Instead of letting few industrials\n   monopolize such a service on the Internet,\
    \ an alternative approach\n   based on an open-partnership scheme of INETPhone\
    \ service is proposed\n   (see Section 5), which will give equal opportunity and\
    \ benefits to\n   the entire Internet community.\n"
- title: 3. INETPhone Servers
  contents:
  - "3. INETPhone Servers\n   The central components of the INETPhone service are\
    \ its servers on\n   Internet.  The server acts as a gateway between the telephone\
    \ network\n   and the Internet.  For this purpose, the server will have both\n\
    \   interfaces to a computer network and the telephone network.\n   Currently,\
    \ there are many commercial telephone interface cards\n   available on the market\
    \ (such as Dialogic's Voice Boards [5]), which\n   support various telephone operations\
    \ of detecting/generating\n   telephone signals (ring, DTMF, etc. [6]), receiving/initiating\
    \ phone\n   calls, recording (digitizing and compressing) or playing back audio\n\
    \   signals, and monitoring the progress of a phone call.\n   With the support\
    \ of necessary hardware interfaces, the function of an\n   INETPhone server includes:\n\
    \     (a) Receive a local call or accept a connection from a remote\n        \
    \ server;\n     (b) Identify the PIN of a local call and determine if to proceed\n\
    \         the call or not;\n     (c) Accept a phone number for remote dialing\
    \ from a local call;\n     (d) Look up the local directory for a remote server\
    \ of a\n         requested call;\n     (e) Make a connection to a remote server;\n\
    \     (f) Make a local phone call upon the request of a remote server;\n     (g)\
    \ Maintain full-duplex, real-time exchanges of voice packets\n         via Internet;\n\
    \     (h) Maintain information exchanges with Directory Servers (see\n       \
    \  Section 4);\n     (i) Handle exceptional conditions, such as long delay or\
    \ drop of\n         voice packets;\n     (j) Monitor quality of service and keep\
    \ accounting information.\n   The above listed functions represent probably the\
    \ minimal\n   requirements for each INETPhone server. Some further important\n\
    \   features, such as compression/decompression, security, multicasting,\n   and\
    \ voice mail need also to be considered when a real service of\n   INETPhone is\
    \ launched on the Internet.  Since a general public of the\n   Internet community\
    \ might be involved in this proposed INETPhone\n   service, it is probably necessary\
    \ to set an open standard in the\n   building of INETPhone servers (see Section\
    \ 5).\n"
- title: 4. Directory Servers
  contents:
  - "4. Directory Servers\n   The main philosophy behind the INETPhone service is\
    \ to reduce a long\n   distance phone call into two local calls and an Internet\
    \ connection.\n   Therefore, an INETPhone server will always be identified by\
    \ its IP\n   address with its local area code of the phone number (also possibly\n\
    \   with its sub-regional number).  In order to support a dynamic\n   configuration\
    \ of INETPhone servers on the Internet, a Directory\n   Server(s) (DS) will be\
    \ required to map between IP address and area\n   code of INETPhone servers, which\
    \ in some sense, is similar to the\n   functions of a Name Server (such as the\
    \ BIND [7]).  After an\n   INETPhone server is installed on the Internet, it needs\
    \ to register\n   itself with a DS.  The mapping information at DS will be disseminated\n\
    \   to INETPhone servers for the search of a remote server in response to\n  \
    \ a requested phone call.  Local cache of mapping information may also\n   be\
    \ maintained at INETPhone servers to alleviate communications\n   between INETPhone\
    \ servers and Directory Server(s).  Again, the\n   function of a Directory Server\
    \ for the INETPhone may require another\n   open specification.\n"
- title: 5. Open Partnership
  contents:
  - "5. Open Partnership\n   Voice communication and telephone service are important\
    \ parts for\n   providing integrated information services over the Internet. \
    \ With\n   the current trends of commercialized services over the Internet,\n\
    \   sooner or later, some kind of telephone services will be launched on\n   the\
    \ Internet by some private companies.  On the other hand, the\n   operation of\
    \ the INETPhone service will depend on the installment of\n   enough INETPhone\
    \ servers over the Internet, which can be achieved\n   through a cooperative effort\
    \ of the entire Internet community.  This\n   RFC proposes an open-partnership\
    \ scheme for the INETPhone service,\n   which provides equal opportunity and benefits\
    \ to the entire Internet\n   community.\n   An outline of the proposed open-partnership\
    \ scheme is listed as\n   follows:\n     (a) Any organization or individual person\
    \ can join or withdraw\n         from this open-partnership on a voluntary base.\n\
    \     (b) In order to join the partnership (therefore becoming a member\n    \
    \     of the partnership), an organization or a person should at\n         least\
    \ install and maintain an INETPhone server on the\n         Internet with the\
    \ equal capacity of lines for call-in and\n         dial-out services.\n     (c)\
    \ Each member of the partnership has the equal right to use the\n         INETPhone\
    \ service through any INETPhone servers on the\n         Internet.  All services\
    \ will bear the same charges based on\n         the number of bytes transmitted\
    \ through the Internet and\n         whatever the rate (if any) laid down by the\
    \ Internet\n         authority.\n     (d) A not-for-profit consortium will be\
    \ formed from the\n         representatives of all members of the partnership.\
    \ The main\n         task of the consortium is to establish all regulations and\n\
    \         specifications of the INETPhone service, and to coordinate\n       \
    \  the execution of these rules by all the members.\n"

    \ the\n   Internet community, the IAB may need to consider forming a special\n\
    \   task force or working group to further look into the matter.\n"
