  - "1. Introduction\n   There are thousands of networks in the internet.  There are\
    \ tens of\n   thousands of host machines.  There are hundreds of thousands of\n\
    \   users.  It takes a great deal of effort to manage the resources and\n   protocols\
    \ which make the Internet possible.  Sites may have people\n   who get paid to\
    \ manage their hardware and software.  But the\n   infrastructure of the Internet\
    \ is managed by volunteers who spend\n   considerable portions of their valued\
    \ time to keep the people\n   connected.\n   Hundreds of people attend the three\
    \ IETF meetings each year.  They\n   represent the government, the military, research\
    \ institutions,\n   educational institutions, and vendors from all over the world.\
    \  Most\n   of them are volunteers; people who attend the meetings to learn and\n\
    \   to contribute what they know.  There are a few very special people\n   who\
    \ deserve special notice.  These are the people who sit on the IAB,\n   IESG,\
    \ and IRSG.  Not only do they spend time at the meetings, but\n   they spend additional\
    \ time to organize them.  They are the IETF's\n   interface to other standards\
    \ bodies and to the funding institutions.\n   Without them, the IETF, indeed the\
    \ whole Internet, would not be\n   possible.\n"

    \ their\n   biographies so that I could compile them into this FYI RFC, I would\n\
    \   like to give special thanks to Joyce K. Reynolds (whose biography is\n   in\

- title: 3. Request for Biographies
  contents:
  - "3. Request for Biographies\n   In mid-February, I sent the following message\
    \ to the members of the\n   IAB, IESG and IRSG.  It is their responses to this\
    \ message that I\n   have compiled in this FYI RFC.\n      The ARPANET is 20 years\
    \ old.  The next meeting of the IETF in St.\n      Louis this coming March will\
    \ be the 20th plenary.  It is a good\n      time to credit the people who help\
    \ make the Internet possible.  I\n      am sending this request to the current\
    \ members of the IAB, the\n      IRSG, and the IESG.  At some future time, I would\
    \ like to expand\n      the number of people to be included.  For now, however,\
    \ I am\n      limiting inclusion to members of the groups listed above.\n    \
    \  I would like to ask you to submit to me your biography.  I intend\n      to\
    \ compile the bios submitted into an FYI RFC to be published\n      before the\
    \ next IETF meeting.  In order to maintain some\n      consistency, I would like\
    \ to have the bios contain three\n      paragraphs.  The first paragraph should\
    \ contain your bio, second\n      should be your school affiliation & other interests,\
    \ and the third\n      should contain your opinion of how the Internet has grown.\
    \  Of\n      course, if there is anything else you would like to say, please\n\
    \      feel free.  The object is to let the very large user community\n      know\
    \ about the people who give them what they have.\n"

  - "4. Biographies\n   The biographies are in alphabetical order.  The contents have\
    \ not\n   been edited; only the formating has been changed.\n      4.1  Robert\
    \ Braden, IAB Executive Director\n           Bob Braden joined the networking\
    \ research group at ISI in\n           1986.  Since thenf, he has been supported\
    \ by NSF for research\n           concerning NSFnet, and by DARPA for protocol\
    \ research.  Tasks\n           have included designing the statspy program for\
    \ collecting\n           NSFnet statistics, editing the Host Requirements RFCs,\
    \ and\n           coordinating the DARPA Research Testbed network DARTnet.  His\n\
    \           research interests generally include end-to-end protocols,\n     \
    \      especially in the transport and network (Internet) layers.\n          \
    \ Braden came to ISI from UCLA, where he had worked 16 of the\n           preceding\
    \ 18 years for the campus computing center.  There he\n           had technical\
    \ responsibility for attaching the first\n           supercomputer (IBM 360/91)\
    \ to the ARPAnet, beginning in 1970.\n           Braden was active in the ARPAnet\
    \ Network Working Group,\n           contributing to the design of the FTP protocol\
    \ in particular.\n           In 1975, he began to receive direct DARPA funding\
    \ for\n           installing the 360/91 as a \"tool-bearing host\" in the\n  \
    \         National Software Works.  In 1978, he became a member of the\n     \
    \      TCP Internet Working Group and began developing a TCP/IP\n           implementation\
    \ for the IBM system.  As a result, UCLA's\n           360/91 was one of the ARPAnet\
    \ host systems that replaced NCP\n           by TCP/IP in the big changeover of\
    \ January 1983.  The UCLA\n           package of ARPAnet host software, including\
    \ Braden's TCP/IP\n           code, was distributed to other OS/MVS sites and\
    \ was later\n           sold commercially.\n           Braden spent 1981-1982\
    \ in the Computer Science Department of\n           University College London.\
    \  At that time, he wrote the first\n           Telnet/XXX relay system connecting\
    \ the Internet with the UK\n           academic X.25 network.  In 1981, Braden\
    \ was invited to join\n           the ICCB, an organization that became the IAB,\
    \ and has been\n           an IAB member ever since.  When IAB task forces were\
    \ formed\n           in 1986, he created and still chairs the End-to-End Task\n\
    \           Force (now Research Group).\n           Braden has been in the computer\
    \ field for 40 years this year.\n           Prior to UCLA, he worked at Stanford\
    \ and at Carnegie Tech.\n           He has taught programming and operating systems\
    \ courses at\n           Carnegie Tech, Stanford, and UCLA.  He received a Bachelor\
    \ of\n           Engineering Physics from Cornell in 1957, and an MS in\n    \
    \       Physics from Stanford in 1962.\n           ------------\n           Regardless\
    \ of the ancient Chinese curse, living through\n           interesting times is\
    \ not always bad.\n           For me,  participation in the development of the\
    \ ARPAnet and\n           the Internet protocols has been very exciting.  One\
    \ important\n           reason it worked, I believe, is that there were a lot\
    \ of very\n           bright people all working more or less in the same direction,\n\
    \           led by some very wise people in the funding agency.  The\n       \
    \    result was to create a community of network researchers who\n           believed\
    \ strongly that collaboration is more powerful than\n           competition among\
    \ researchers.  I don't think any other model\n           would have gotten us\
    \ where we are today.  This world view\n           persists in the IAB, and is\
    \ reflected in the informal\n           structure of the IAB, IETF, and IRTF.\n\
    \           Nevertheless, with growth and success (plus subtle policy\n      \
    \     shifts in Washington), the prevailing mode may be shifting\n           towards\
    \ competition, both commercial and academic.  To\n           develop protocols\
    \ in a commercially competitive world, you\n           need elaborate committee\
    \ structures and rules.  The action\n           then shifts to the large companies,\
    \ away from small companies\n           and universities.  In an academically\
    \ competitive world, you\n           don't develop any (useful) protocols; you\
    \ get 6 different\n           protocols for the same objective, each with its\
    \ research\n           paper (which is the \"real\" output).  This results in\n\
    \           efficient production of research papers, but it may not\n        \
    \   result in the kind of intellectual consensus necessary to\n           create\
    \ good and useful communication protocols.\n           Being a member of the IAB\
    \ is sometimes very frustrating.  For\n           some years now we have been\
    \ painfully aware of the scaling\n           problems of the Internet, and since\
    \ 1982 have lived through a\n           series of mini-disasters as various limits\
    \ have been\n           exceeded.  We have been saying that \"getting big\" is\
    \ probably\n           a more urgent (and perhaps more difficult) research problem\n\
    \           than \"getting fast\", but it seems difficult to persuade\n      \
    \     people of the importance of launching the kind of research\n           program\
    \ we think is necessary to learn how to deal with\n           Internet growth.\n\
    \           It is very hard to figure out when the exponential growth is\n   \
    \        likely to stop, or when, if ever, the fundamental\n           architectural\
    \ model of the Internet will be so out of kilter\n           with reality that\
    \ it will cease be useful.  Ask me again in\n           ten years.\n      4.2\
    \  Hans-Werner Braun, IAB Member\n           Hans-Werner Braun joined the San\
    \ Diego Supercomputer Center\n           as a Principal Scientist in January 1991.\
    \ In his initial\n           major responsibility as Co-Principal Investigator\
    \ of, and\n           Executive Committee member on the CASA gigabit network\n\
    \           research project he is working on networking efforts beyond\n    \
    \       the problems of todays computer networking infrastructure.\n         \
    \  Between April 1983 and January 1991 he worked at the\n           University\
    \ of Michigan and focused on operational\n           infrastructure for the Merit\
    \ Computer Network and the\n           University of Michigan's Information Technology\
    \ Division.\n           Starting out with the networking infrastructure within\
    \ the\n           State of Michigan he started to investigate into TCP/IP\n  \
    \         protocols and became very involved in the early stages of the\n    \
    \       NSFNET networking efforts.  He was Principal Investigator on\n       \
    \    the NSFNET backbone project since the NSFNET award went to\n           Merit\
    \ in November 1987 and managed Merit's Internet\n           Engineering group.\
    \ Between April 1978 and April 1983 Hans-\n           Werner Braun worked at the\
    \ Regional Computing Center of the\n           University of Cologne in West Germany\
    \ on network engineering\n           responsibilities for the regional and local\
    \ network.\n           In March 1978 Hans-Werner Braun graduated in West Germany\
    \ and\n           holds a Diploma in Engineering with a major in Information\n\
    \           Processing. He is a member of the Association of Computing\n     \
    \      Machinery (ACM) and its Special Interest Group on\n           Communications,\
    \ the Institute of Electrical and Electronical\n           Engineers (IEEE) as\
    \ well as the IEEE Computer Society and the\n           IEEE Communications Society\
    \ and the American Association for\n           the Advancement of Science. He\
    \ was a member of the National\n           Science Foundation's Network Program\
    \ Advisory Group (NPAG)\n           and in particular its Technical Committee\
    \ (NPAG-TC) between\n           November 1986 and late 1987, at which time the\
    \ NPAG got\n           resolved. He also chaired the Technical Committee of the\n\
    \           National Science Foundation's Network Program Advisory Group\n   \
    \        (NPAG-TC) starting in February 1987. Prior to the\n           organizational\
    \ change of the JvNCnet he participated in the\n           JvNCnet Network Technical\
    \ Advisory Committee (NTAC) of the\n           John von Neumann National Supercomputer\
    \ Center. While working\n           as Principal Investigator on the NSFNET project\
    \ at Merit, he\n           chaired the NSFNET Network Technical Committee, created\
    \ to\n           aid Merit with the NSFNET project.  Hans-Werner Braun is a\n\
    \           member of the Engineering Planning Group of the Federal\n        \
    \   Networking Council (FEPG) since its beginnings in early 1989,\n          \
    \ a member of the Internet Activities Board (IAB), the Internet\n           Engineering\
    \ Task Force. He had participated in an earlier,\n           informal, version\
    \ of the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n           and the then existing\
    \ Internet Architecture Task Force. While\n           at Merit, Hans-Werner Braun\
    \ was also Principal Investigator\n           on NSF projects for the \"Implementation\
    \ and Management of\n           Improved Connectivity Between NSFNET and CA*net\"\
    \ and for\n           \"Coordinating Routing for the NSFNET,\" the latter at the\
    \ time\n           of the old 56kbps NSFNET backbone network that he was quite\n\
    \           intimately involved with.\n           ------------\n           The\
    \ growth of the Internet can be measured in many ways and I\n           can only\
    \ try to find some examples.\n           o Network number counts\n           There\
    \ were days where being \"connected to net 10\" was the\n           Greatest Thing\
    \ Ever.  A time where the Internet just\n           consisted of a few networks\
    \ centered around the ARPAnet and\n           where growing above 100 network\
    \ numbers seemed excessive.\n           Todays number of networks in the global\
    \ infrastructure\n           exceeds 2000 connected networks, and many more if\
    \ isolated\n           network islands get included.\n           o Traffic growth\n\
    \           The Internet has undergone a dramatic increase in traffic\n      \
    \     over the last few years. The NSFNET backbone can be used as\n          \
    \ an example here, where in August 1988 about 194 million\n           packets\
    \ got injected into the network, which had increased to\n           about 396\
    \ million packets per month by the end of the year,\n           to reach about\
    \ 4.8 billion packets in December 1990. January\n           1991 yielded close\
    \ to 5.9 billion packets as sent into the\n           NSFNET backbone.\n     \
    \      o Internet Engineering Task Force participation\n           The early IETF,\
    \ after it spun off the old GADS, included\n           about 20 or so people.\
    \ I remember a meeting a few people had\n           with Mike Corrigan several\
    \ years ago. Mike then chaired the\n           IETF before Phill Gross became\
    \ chair and the discussion was\n           had about permitting the \"NSFNET crowd\"\
    \ to join the IETF.\n           Mike finally agreed and the IETF started to explode\
    \ in size,\n           now including many working groups and several hundred\n\
    \           members, including vendors and phone companies.\n           o International\
    \ infrastructure\n           At some point of time the Internet was centric around\
    \ the US\n           with very little international connectivity. The\n      \
    \     international connectivity was for network research purposes,\n        \
    \   just like the US domestic component at that point of time.\n           Today's\
    \ Internet stretches to so many countries that it can\n           be considered\
    \ close to global in scope, in particular as more\n           and more international\
    \ connections to, as well as Internet\n           infrastructure within, other\
    \ countries are happening.\n           o References in trade journals\n      \
    \     Many trade journals just a year or two ago had close to no\n           mention\
    \ of the Internet. Today references to the Internet\n           appear in many\
    \ journals and press releases from a variety of\n           places.\n        \
    \   o Articles in professional papers\n           Publications like ACM SIGCOMM\
    \ show increased interest for\n           Internet related professional papers,\
    \ compared to a few years\n           ago. Also the publication rate of the Request\
    \ For Comments\n           (RFC) series is quite impressive.\n           o Congressional\
    \ and Senatorial visibility\n           A few years ago the Internet was \"just\
    \ a research project.\"\n           Today's dramatically increased visibility\
    \ in result of the\n           Internet success allows Congress as well as Senators\
    \ to play\n           lead roles in pushing the National Research and Education\n\
    \           Network (NREN) agenda forward, which is also fostered by the\n   \
    \        executive branch. In the context of the US federal government\n     \
    \      the real credit should go to DARPA, though, for starting to\n         \
    \  prototype advanced networking, leading to the Internet about\n           twenty\
    \ years ago and over time opening it up more and more to\n           the science\
    \ and research community until more operational\n           efforts were able\
    \ to move the network to a real\n           infrastructure in support of science,\
    \ research and education\n           at large. This really allowed NSF to make\
    \ NSFNET happen.\n           o Funding\n           The Internet funding initially\
    \ consisted of DARPA efforts.\n           Agencies like NSF, NASA, DOE and others\
    \ started to make major\n           contributions later. Industrial participation\
    \ helped moving\n           the network forward as well. Very major investments\
    \ have been\n           made by campuses and research institutions to create local\n\
    \           infrastructure. Operational infrastructure comes at a high\n     \
    \      cost, especially if ubiquity, robustness and high performance\n       \
    \    are required.\n           o Research and continued development\n        \
    \   The Internet has matured from a network research oriented\n           environment\
    \ to an operational infrastructure supporting\n           research, science and\
    \ education at large. However, even\n           though for many people the Internet\
    \ is an environment\n           supporting their day-to-day work, the Internet\
    \ at its current\n           level of technology is supported by a culture of\
    \ people that\n           cooperates in a largely non-competitive environment.\
    \ Many\n           times already the size of the routing tables or the amount\
    \ of\n           traffic or the insufficiency of routing exchange protocols,\n\
    \           just to name examples, have broken connectivity with many\n      \
    \     people being interrupted in their day-to-day work. Global\n           Internet\
    \ management and problem resolution further hamper\n           fast recovery from\
    \ certain incidents. It is unproven that the\n           current technology will\
    \ survive in a competitive but\n           unregulated environment, with uncoordinated\
    \ routing policies\n           and global network management being just two of\
    \ the major\n           issues here.  Furthermore, while frequently comments are\n\
    \           being made where the publicly available monthly increases in\n   \
    \        traffic figures would not justify moving to T3 or even\n           gigabit\
    \ per second networks, it should be pointed out that\n           monthly figures\
    \ are very macroscopic views. Much of the\n           Internet traffic is very\
    \ bursty and we have frequently seen\n           an onslaught of traffic towards\
    \ backbone nodes if one looks\n           at it over fairly short intervals of\
    \ time. For example, for\n           specific applications that, perhaps in real-time,\

    \ less even kept pace with\n           the general Internet growth (by whatever\

    \           ------------\n           The Internet started as a focused DARPA research\
    \ effort to\n           develop a capability to link computers across multiple,\n\
    \           internally diverse packet networks. The successful evolution\n   \
    \        of this technology through 4 versions, demonstration on\n           ARPANET,\
    \ mobile packet radio nets, the Atlantic SATNET and\n           at-sea MATNET\
    \ provided the basis for formal mandating of the\n           TCP/IP protocols\
    \ for use on ARPANET and other DoD systems in\n           1983. By the mid-1980's,\
    \ a market had been established for\n           software and hardware supporting\
    \ these protocols, largely\n           triggered by the Ethernet and other LAN\
    \ phenomena, coupled\n           with the rapid proliferation of UNIX-based systems\
    \ which\n           incorporated the TCP/IP protocols as part of the standard\n\
    \           release package.  Concurrent with the development of a market\n  \
    \         and rapid increase in vendor interest, government agencies in\n    \
    \       addition to DoD began applying the technology to their needs,\n      \
    \     culminating in the formation of the Federal Research Internet\n        \
    \   Coordinating Committee which has now evolved into the Federal\n          \
    \ Networking Council, in the U.S. At the same time, similar\n           rapid\
    \ growth of TCP/IP technology application is occurring\n           outside the\
    \ US in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Rim,\n           Eurasia, Australia,\
    \ South and Central America and, to a\n           limited extent, Africa.  The\
    \ internationalization of the\n           Internet has spawned new organizational\
    \ foci such as the\n           Coordinating Committee for International Research\
    \ Networking\n           (CCIRN) and heightened interest in commercial provision\
    \ of IP\n           services (e.g. in Finland, the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere).\n\
    \           The Internet has also become the basis for a proposed\n          \
    \ National Research and Education Network (NREN) in the U.S.\n           It's\
    \ electronic messaging system has been linked to the major\n           U.S.  commercial\
    \ email carriers and to other major private\n           electronic mail services\
    \ such as Bitnet (in the US, EARN in\n           Europe) as well as UUNET (in\
    \ the U.S.) and EUNET (in Europe).\n           The Bitnet and UUCP-based systems\
    \ are international in scope\n           and complement the Internet system in\
    \ terms of email\n           connectivity.\n           With the introduction of\
    \ OSI capability (in the form of CLNP)\n           into important parts of the\
    \ Internet (such as the NSFNET\n           backbone and selected intermediate\
    \ level networks), a path\n           has been opened to support the use of multiple\
    \ protocol\n           suites in the Internet. Many of the vendor routers/gateways\n\
    \           support TCP/IP, OSI and a variety of vendor-specific\n           protocols\
    \ in a common network environment.\n           In the U.S., regional Bell Operating\
    \ Company carriers are\n           planning the introduction of Switched Multimegabit\
    \ Data\n           Services and Frame Relay services which can support TCP/IP\n\
    \           and other Internet protocols. On the research side, DARPA and\n  \
    \         the NSF are supporting a major initiative in gigabit speed\n       \
    \    networking, towards which the NREN is aimed.\n           The Internet is\
    \ a grand collaboration of over 5000 networks\n           involving millions of\
    \ users, hundreds of thousands of hosts\n           and dozens of countries around\
    \ the world. It may well do for\n           computers what the telephone system\
    \ has done for people:\n           provided a means for international interchange\
    \ of information\n           which is blind to nationality, proprietary interests,\
    \ and\n           hardware platform specifics.\n      4.5  Noel Chiappa, IETF\
    \ Internet Services Area Director\n           Noel Chiappa is currently an independent\
    \ inventor working in\n           the area of computer networks and system software.\
    \ His\n           principal occupation, however, is his service as the Area\n\
    \           Director for Internet Services of the Steering Group of the\n    \
    \       Internet Engineering Task Force.\n           His primary current research\

    \ for very large scale\n           (globally ubiquitous and larger) internetworks,\
    \ but he is\n           generally interested in the problems of the packet layer\
    \ of\n           internetworking; i.e. everything involved in getting traffic\n\
    \           from one host to another anywhere in the internetwork.  As a\n   \
    \        with many novel features intended for use in large\n           programming\
    \ projects with many source and header files.\n           He has been a member\
    \ of the TCP/IP Working Group and its\n           successors (up to the IETF)\
    \ since 1977. He was a member of\n           the Research Staff at the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of\n           Technology from 1977-1982 and 1984-1986. While at MIT\
    \ he\n           worked on packet switching and local area networks, and was\n\
    \           responsible for the conception of the multi-protocol backbone\n  \
    \         and the multi-protocol router.  After leaving MIT he worked\n      \
    \     with a number of companies, including Proteon, to bring\n           networking\
    \ products based on work done at MIT to the public.\n           He attended Phillips\
    \ Andover Academy and MIT.  He was born\n           and bred in Bermuda.\n   \
    \        His outside interests include study and collection of antique\n     \
    \      racing cars (principally Lotuses), reading (particularly\n           political\
    \ and military history and biographies), landscape\n           gardening (particularly\
    \ Japanese), and study of Oriental rugs\n           (particularly Turkoman tribal\
    \ rugs) and Oriental antiques\n           (particularly Japanese lacquerware and\
    \ Chinese archaic\n           jades).\n      4.6  Lyman Chapin, IAB Member\n \
    \          Lyman Chapin graduated from Cornell University in 1973 with a\n   \
    \        B.A. in Mathematics, and spent the next two years writing\n         \
    \  COBOL applications for Systems & Programs (NZ) Ltd. in Lower\n           Hutt,\
    \ New Zealand.  After a year travelling in Australia and\n           Asia, he\
    \ joined the newly-formed Networking group at Data\n           General Corporation\
    \ in 1977.  At DG, he was responsible for\n           the development of software\
    \ for distributed resource\n           management (operating-system embedded RPC),\
    \ distributed\n           database management, X.25-based local and wide- area\n\
    \           networks, and OSI-based transport, internetwork, and routing\n   \
    \        functions for DG's open-system products.  In 1987 he formed\n       \
    \    the Distributed Systems Architecture group, and was\n           responsible\
    \ for the development of DG's Distributed\n           Application Architecture\
    \ (DAA) and for the specification of\n           the directory and management\
    \ services of DAA.  He moved to\n           Bolt, Beranek & Newman in 1990 as\
    \ the Chief Network Architect\n           in BBN's Communications Division, where\
    \ he serves as a\n           consultant to the Systems Architecture group and\
    \ the\n           coordinator for BBN's open system standards activities.  He\n\
    \           is the chairman of ANSI-accredited task group X3S3.3,\n          \
    \ responsible for Network and Transport layer standards, since\n           1982;\
    \  vice-chairman of the ACM Special Interest Group on\n           Data Communications\
    \ (SIGCOMM) since 1985;  and a member of\n           the Internet Activities Board\
    \ (IAB) since 1989.  He lives\n           with his wife and two young daughters\
    \ in Hopkinton,\n           Massachusetts.\n           ------------\n        \
    \   I started out in 1977 working with X.25 networks, and began\n           working\
    \ on OSI in 1979 - first the architecture (the OSI\n           Reference Model),\
    \ and then the transport and internetwork\n           protocol specifications.\
    \  It didn't take long to recognize\n           the basic irony of OSI standards\
    \ development:  there we were,\n           solemnly anointing international standards\
    \ for networking,\n           and every time we needed to send electronic mail\
    \ or exchange\n           files, we were using the TCP/IP-based Internet!  I've\
    \ been\n           looking for ways to overcome this anomaly ever since;  to\n\
    \           inject as much of the proven TCP/IP technology into OSI as\n     \
    \      possible, and to introduce OSI into an ever more pervasive\n          \
    \ and worldwide Internet.  It is, to say the least, a\n           challenge!\n\
    \      4.7  Dr. David Clark, IAB Member, IRTF Chairman\n           David Clark\
    \ works at the M.I.T. Laboratory for Computer\n           Science, where he is\
    \ a Senior Research Scientist. His current\n           research involves protocols\
    \ for high speed and very large\n           networks, in particular the problems\
    \ of routing and flow and\n           congestion control. He is also working on\
    \ integration of\n           video into packet networks. Prior to this effort,\
    \ he\n           developed a new implementation approach for network software,\n\
    \           and an operating system (Swift) to demonstrate this concept.\n   \
    \        Earlier projects include the token ring LAN and the Multics\n       \
    \    operating system. He joined the TCP development effort in\n           1975,\
    \ and chaired the IAB from 1981 to 1990. He has a\n           continuing interest\
    \ in protocol performance. He is also\n           active in the area of computer\
    \ and communications security.\n           David Clark received his BSEE from\
    \ Swarthmore College in\n           1966, and his MS and PhD from MIT, the latter\
    \ in 1973. He has\n           worked at MIT since then.\n           ------------\n\
    \           It is not proper to think of networks as connecting\n           computers.\
    \ Rather, they connect people using computers to\n           mediate. The great\
    \ success of the internet is not technical,\n           but in human impact. Electronic\
    \ mail may not be a wonderful\n           advance in Computer Science, but it\
    \ is a whole new way for\n           people to communicate. The continued growth\
    \ of the Internet\n           is a technical challenge to all of us, but we must\
    \ never\n           loose sight of where we came from, the great change we have\n\
    \           worked on the larger computer community, and the great\n         \
    \  potential we have for future change.\n      4.8  Dr. Stephen Crocker, IETF\
    \ Security Area Director\n           Currently I'm vice president of Trusted Information\
    \ Systems,\n           Inc.  which I joined in late 1986.  I set up TIS' Los Angeles\n\
    \           office and ran it until summer 1989 when I moved to the home\n   \
    \        office in Maryland.  At TIS my primary concerns are program\n       \
    \    verification research and application, integration of\n           cryptography\
    \ with trusted systems, network security, and new\n           applications for\
    \ networks and trusted systems.\n           I was at the Aerospace Corporation\
    \ from 1981-86 as Director\n           of the Information Sciences Research Office\
    \ which later\n           became the Computer Science Laboratory.  The research\
    \ program\n           at Aerospace included networks, program verification,\n\
    \           artificial intelligence, applications of expert systems, and\n   \
    \        parallel processing.\n           From 1974-81 I was a researcher at USC's\
    \ Information Sciences\n           Institute, where I focused primarily on program\
    \ verification.\n           From 1971-74 I was a program manager at DARPA/IPTO\
    \ (now\n           ISTO).  I was responsible for the research programs in\n  \
    \         artificial intelligence, automatic programming, speech\n           understanding,\
    \ and some parts of the network research.  I\n           also initiated an ambitious\
    \ but somewhat ill-fated venture\n           called the National Software Works.\n\
    \           From 1968-71 I was a graduate student in the UCLA Computer\n     \
    \      Science Department.  While there I initiated the Network\n           Working\
    \ Group, arguably the forerunner of the IETF and many\n           related groups\
    \ around the world, and helped define the\n           original suite of protocols\
    \ for the Arpanet.  I also\n           initiated the Request for Comments (RFC)\
    \ series.  A short\n           description of the events of that era are contained\
    \ in RFC\n           1000.\n           I was a graduate student in the MIT AI\
    \ Lab for a year and a\n           half in 1967-68, and I was an undergraduate\
    \ at UCLA for a\n           long time before that.\n           ------------\n\
    \           I've watched the Internet grow from its beginning.  At UCLA\n    \
    \       we had the privilege of being node 1 of the Arpanet.  In\n           those\
    \ days, several of us dreamed of very high quality\n           intercomputer connections\
    \ and very rich protocols to knit the\n           computers together.  Some of\
    \ the those concepts are stilled\n           discussed and anticipated today under\
    \ the names remote\n           visualization, distributed file systems, etc. \
    \ On the other\n           hand, I would never have imagined that 20 years later\
    \ we'd\n           have such a plethora of different network technologies.  Even\n\
    \           more astonishing is the enormous number of independently\n       \
    \    managed but nonetheless interconnected networks that make up\n          \
    \ the current network.  And somewhat beyond comprehension is\n           that\
    \ it seems to work.\n           How will the Internet evolve?  I expect to see\
    \ substantial\n           developments in the following dimensions.\n        \
    \   o Regularization, internationalization and commercialization\n           Standards\
    \ will become even more important than they are now.\n           Implementations\
    \ of protocols and related mechanisms will\n           become more standard and\
    \ robust.  The relationship between\n           the TCP/IP stack and the OSI stack\
    \ will be resolved, with\n           either both co-existing, OSI winning out,\
    \ or some\n           intermediate convergence emerging.\n           The Internet\
    \ will become a less U.S.-centric and more\n           international operation.\
    \  Much of the Internet will be\n           operated by commercial concerns on\
    \ a a profit-making basis,\n           thereby opening up the Internet to unrestricted\
    \ use.  The\n           telephone companies, including both the local exchange\n\
    \           carriers and the interexchange carriers, will start providing\n  \
    \         some of the protocol stack other than the point-to-point\n         \
    \  lines.\n           o Higher and lower bandwidths; great proliferation\n   \
    \        I expect to see T1 connections become the norm for the types\n      \
    \     of institutions that are now on the Internet.  Higher speeds,\n        \
    \   including speeds up to a gigabit will become available.  At\n           the\
    \ same time, I expect to see a vast expansion of the\n           Internet, reaching\
    \ into a significant fraction of the schools\n           and businesses in this\
    \ country and elsewhere in the world.\n           Many of these institutions will\
    \ be connected at 9600 bits/sec\n           or slower.\n           o More applications\n\
    \           E-mail dominates the Internet, and it's likely to remain the\n   \
    \        dominant use of the Internet in the future.  Nonetheless, I\n       \
    \    expect to see an exciting array of other applications which\n           become\
    \ heavily used and cause a change in the perception of\n           the Internet\
    \ as primarily a \"mail system.\"  Important\n           databases will become\
    \ available on the Internet, and\n           applications dependent on those databases\
    \ will flourish.  New\n           techniques and tools for collaboration over\
    \ a network will\n           emerge.  These will include various forms of conferencing\
    \ and\n           cooperative multi-media document development.\n           o\
    \ Security\n           Security will tighten up on the Internet, but not without\n\
    \           some (more) pain.  Host operating systems will be built,\n       \
    \    configured, distributed and operated under much tighter\n           constraints\
    \ than they have been.  Firewalls will abound.\n           Encryption will be\
    \ added to links, routers and various\n           protocol layers.  All of this\
    \ will decrease the utility of\n           the Internet in the short run, but\
    \ lay the groundwork for\n           broader use eventually.  New protocols will\
    \ emerge which\n           incorporate sound protection but also provide efficient\
    \ and\n           flexible access control and resource sharing.  These will\n\
    \           provide the basis for the kind of close knit applications\n      \
    \     that motivated the original thinking behind the Arpanet.\n      4.9  James\

    \           ------------\n           The growth of the internet over the years\
    \ has taken it from\n           lower speeds to higher speeds, from limited geographical\n\
    \           extent to global presence, from research apparatus to an\n       \
    \    essential social and commercial infrastructure, from\n           experimentation\
    \ among a few networking sophisticates to daily\n           use by thousands in\

    \  UC Davis has\n           also been instrumental in the development of new network\n\
    \           protocols and their prototype implementations, in particular,\n  \
    \         the Point-to- Point Protocol (PPP).  UC Davis has been very\n      \
    \     active in the use of networking for students from\n           kindergarten\
    \ through community colleges and has had the Davis\n           High School on\
    \ the Internet since 1989.  In conjunction with\n           the City of Davis,\
    \ UC Davis is planning a community network\n           using ISDN to bring networking\
    \ into the residences in Davis\n           for university network connection,\
    \ high school and library\n           resource access, telecommuting, and electronic\
    \ democracy.\n           ------------\n           I have seen the rapid growth\
    \ of the Internet into a worldwide\n           utility, but believe that it is\
    \ lacking in the types of\n           applications that could make use of its\
    \ full potential.  I\n           believes that it is time to look at the network\
    \ from the\n           users side and consider the functionality that they desire.\n\
    \           New applications for information storage and retrieval,\n        \
    \   personal and group communications, and coordinated computer\n           resources\

    \ and network applications. He is now at\n           INRIA in Sophia-Antipolis,\
    \ where he leads the research\n           project \"RODEO\", whose objective is\
    \ the definition and the\n           experimentation of communication protocols\
    \ for very high\n           speed networks, at one Gbit/s or more. This includes\
    \ the\n           study of high speed transmission control protocols, of their\n\
    \           parameterization and of their insertion in the operating\n       \
    \    systems, and the study of the synchronization functions and\n           of\
    \ the management of data transparency between heterogeneous\n           systems.\
    \ The work is conducted in cooperation with industrial\n           partners and\
    \ takes into account the evolution of the\n           communication standards.\
    \  Previously, he took part to the\n           NADIR project, investigating computer\
    \ usage of\n           telecommunication satellites, and to OSI developments in\
    \ the\n           GIPSI project for the SM90 work station, including one of the\n\
    \           earliest X.400 systems, and to the ESPRIT project THORN,\n       \
    \    which is provide one of the first X.500 conformant directory\n          \
    \ system.\n           Christian Huitema graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique\
    \ in\n           Paris in 1975, and passed his doctorate in the University of\n\
    \           Paris VI in 1985.\n           ------------\n           The various\
    \ projects which followed the \"Cyclades\" network in\n           France were\
    \ following closely the developments of the Arpanet\n           and then the Internet.\
    \ However, the first linkage was\n           established in the early 80's through\
    \ mail connections. I was\n           directly involved in the setting up of the\
    \ first direct TCP-\n           IP connection between France and the Internet\
    \ (actually,\n           NSFNET) which was first experimented in 1987, and became\n\
    \           operational in 1988. This interconnection, together with\n       \
    \    parallel actions in the Nordic countries of Europe, at CERN\n           and\
    \ through the EUNET association, was certainly influential\n           in the\
    \ development TCP/IP internetting in Europe. The rapid\n           growth of the\
    \ Internet here is indicative both of the\n           perceived needs and of the\
    \ future. Researcher from\n           universities, non profit and industrial\
    \ organizations are\n           eager to communicate; new applications are being\
    \ developed\n           which will enable them to interact more and more closely..\n\
    \           and will pose the networking challenge of realizing a very\n     \
    \      large, very powerful Internet.\n      4.12 Dr. Stephen Kent, IAB Member\n\

    \           Telecommunications and Networks Architecture and Advanced\n      \
    \     Development group.  For the past fifteen years his group has\n         \
    \  designed the network architecture and protocols behind\n           Digital's\
    \ DECnet computer networking products.  His group has\n           played a leading\
    \ role in local area network standardization,\n           including Ethernet,\
    \ FDDI, and transparent bridged LANs.  His\n           group has also played a\
    \ leading role in standardizing the OSI\n           network and transport layers.\
    \  Most recently, they have\n           completed the architecture for the next\
    \ phase of DECnet which\n           is based on OSI while providing backward compatibility\
    \ with\n           DECnet Phase IV.  Prior to his role in network architecture\n\
    \           he was responsible for setting the direction of Digital's\n      \
    \     PDP-11 communications products.  In addition to working at\n           Digital,\
    \ he worked at Autex, Inc. where was a designer of a\n           transaction processing\
    \ system for securities trading and at\n           the Smithsonian Astrophysical\
    \ Observatory were he developed\n           an early remote batch system.\n  \
    \         Mr. Lauck received his BA degree from Harvard in 1965.  He\n       \
    \    has worked in a number of areas related to data\n           communication,\
    \ ranging from design of physical links for\n           local area networks to\
    \ applications for distributed\n           processing.  His current interests\
    \ include high speed local\n           and wide area networks, multiprotocol networking,\
    \ network\n           security, and distributed processing. He was a member of\
    \ the\n           Committee on Computer-Computer Communications Protocols of\n\
    \           the National Research Council which did a comparison of the\n    \
    \       TCP and TP4 transport protocols for DOD and NBS.  He was also\n      \
    \     a member of the National Science Foundation Network Technical\n        \
    \   Advisory Board. In December of 1984, he was recognized by\n           Science\
    \ Digest magazine as one of America's 100 brightest\n           young scientists\
    \ for his work on computer networking.\n           ------------\n           In\
    \ 1978 Vint Cerf came to Digital to give a lecture on TCP\n           and IP,\
    \ just prior to the big blizzard.  I was pleased to see\n           that TCP/IP\
    \ shared the same connectionless philosophy of\n           networking as did DECnet.\
    \  Some years later, Digital decided\n           that future phases of DECnet\
    \ would be based on standards.\n           Since Digital was a multinational company,\
    \ the standards\n           would need to be international.  Unfortunately, in\
    \ 1980 ISO\n           rejected TCP and IP on national political grounds.  When\
    \ it\n           looked like the emerging OSI standards were going to be\n   \
    \        limited to purely connection- oriented networking, I was very\n     \
    \      concerned and began efforts to standardize connectionless\n           networking\
    \ in OSI.  As it turned out, TCP/IP retained its\n           initial lead over\
    \ OSI, moving internationally as the Internet\n           expanded, thereby becoming\
    \ an international protocol suite\n           and meeting my original needs. \
    \ I hope that the Internet can\n           evolve into a multiprotocol structure\
    \ that can accommodate\n           changing networking technologies and can do\
    \ so with a minimum\n           of religious fervor.  It will be exciting to solve\
    \ problems\n           like network scale and security, especially in the context\
    \ of\n           a network which must serve users while it evolves.\n      4.14\

    \         My first exposure to the internet (actually Arpanet) was in\n      \
    \     1977 when, as a DARPA contractor, I was provided access.  At\n         \
    \  that point, the Arpanet was primarily used to support DARPA\n           and\
    \ related activities, and was confined to a relatively\n           small set of\
    \ users and sites.  The Internet technology was\n           just in the process\
    \ of being developed and demonstrated.  In\n           fact, my DARPA contract\
    \ was in relation to the Packet Radio\n           Network, and the primary motivation\
    \ for the Internet\n           technology was to connect the mobile Packet Radio\
    \ Network to\n           the long-haul Arpanet.  Now, only 13 years later, things\
    \ have\n           changed radically.  The Internet has grown by several orders\n\
    \           of magnitude in size and connects a much wider community,\n      \
    \     including academic, commercial, and government.  It has\n           spread\
    \ well beyond the USA to include many organizations\n           throughout the\
    \ world.  It has grown beyond the experimental\n           network to provide\
    \ operational service.  Its influence is\n           seen throughout the computer\

    \ Lynch led the Arpanet team that made the transition from the\n           original\
    \ NCP protocols to the current TCP/IP based protocols.\n           Lynch directed\
    \ this effort with 75 people from 1980 until\n           1983.\n           He\
    \ was Director of Computing Facilities at SRI International\n           in the\
    \ late 70's serving the computing needs of over 3,000\n           employees. \
    \ He formerly served as manager of the computing\n           laboratory for the\
    \ Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI\n           which conducts research in\
    \ robotics, vision, speech\n           understanding, theorem proving and distributed\
    \ databases.\n           While at SRI he performed initial debugging of the TCP/IP\n\
    \           protocols in conjunction with BBN.\n           Lynch has been active\
    \ in computer networking since 1973.\n           Prior to that he developed realtime\
    \ software for missile\n           decoy detection for the USAF.  He received\
    \ undergraduate\n           training in mathematics and philosophy from Loyola\
    \ University\n           of Los Angeles and obtained a Master's Degree in mathematics\n\
    \           from UCLA in 1965.\n           -------\n           The Internet has\
    \ grown because it solves simple problems in a\n           simple a manner as\
    \ possible.  Putting together a huge\n           Internet has not been easy. \
    \ We still do not know how to do\n           routing in a huge internet.  When\
    \ you add the realworld\n           requirement of commercial security and the\
    \ desire for\n           \"classes of service\" we are faced with big challenges.\
    \  I\n           think this means that we have to get a lot more involved with\n\
    \           operational provisioning considerations such as those that\n     \
    \      the phone companies and credit card firms have wrestled with.\n       \
    \    Hopefully we can do this and still maintain the rather\n           friendly\
    \ attitude that Internetters have always had.\n      4.16 Dr. Jonathan B. Postel,\
    \ IAB Member, RFC Editor\n           Jon Postel joined ISI in March 1976 as a\
    \ member of the\n           technical staff, and is now Division Director of the\n\
    \           Communications Division.  His current activities include a\n     \
    \      continuing involvement with the evolution of the Internet\n           through\
    \ the work of the various ISI projects on Gigabit\n           Networking, Multimedia\
    \ Conferencing, Protocol Engineering,\n           Los Nettos, Parallel Computing\
    \ System Research, and the Fast\n           Parts Automated Broker.  Previous\
    \ work at ISI included the\n           creation of the \"Los Nettos\" regional\
    \ network for the Los\n           Angeles area, creating prototype implementations\
    \ of several\n           of the protocols developed for the Internet community,\n\
    \           including the Simple Mail Transport Protocol, the Domain Name\n  \
    \         Service, and an experimental Multimedia Mail system.  Earlier\n    \
    \       Jon studied the possible approaches for converting the\n           ARPANET\
    \ from the NCP protocol to the TCP protocol.\n           Participated in the design\
    \ of many protocols for the Internet\n           community.\n           Before\
    \ moving to ISI, Jon worked at SRI International in Doug\n           Engelbart's\
    \ group developing the NLS (later called Augment)\n           system.  While at\
    \ SRI Jon led a special project to develop\n           protocol specifications\
    \ for the Defense Communication Agency\n           for AUTODIN-II.  Most of the\
    \ development effort during this\n           period at ARC was focused on the\
    \ National Software Works.\n           Prior to working at SRI, Jon spent a few\
    \ months with Keydata\n           redesigning and reimplementing the NCP in the\
    \ DEC PDP-15 data\n           management system used by ARPA.  Before Keydata,\
    \ Jon worked\n           at the Mitre Corporation in Virginia where he conducted\
    \ a\n           study of ARPANET Network Control Protocol implementations.\n \
    \          Jon received his B.S. and M.S. in Engineering in 1966 and\n       \
    \    1968 (respectively) from UCLA, and the Ph.D. in Computer\n           Science\
    \ in 1974 from UCLA.  Jon is a member of the ACM.  Jon\n           continues to\
    \ participate in the Internet Activities Board and\n           serve as the editor\
    \ of the \"Request for Comments\" Internet\n           document series.\n    \
    \       -------\n           My first experience with the ARPANET was at UCLA when\
    \ i was\n           working in the group that became the Network Measurement\n\
    \           Center.  When we were told that the first IMP would be\n         \
    \  installed at UCLA we had to get busy on a number of problems.\n           We\
    \ had to work with the other early sites to develop\n           protocols, and\
    \ we had to get our own computing environment in\n           order -- this included\
    \ creating a time-sharing operating\n           system for the SDS Sigma-7 computer.\
    \  Since then the ARPANET\n           and then the Internet have continued to\
    \ grow and always\n           faster than expected.  I think three factors contribute\
    \ to\n           the success of the Internet: 1) public documentation of the\n\
    \           protocols, 2) free (or cheap) software for the popular\n         \
    \  machines, and 3) vendor independence.\n      4.17 Joyce K. Reynolds, IETF User\

    \ twelve years in my professional\n           life to participate in the ARPANET/Internet\
    \ world, from the\n           transition of the TENEX to TOPs-20 machines in 1979\
    \ to\n           surviving the NCP to TCP transition in 1980.  Celebrating the\n\
    \           achievement of the ISI 1000 Hour Club where one of our TOPs-\n   \
    \        20 machines set a record for staying up and running for 1000\n      \
    \     consecutive hours without crashing, to watching the cellular\n         \
    \  split of the ARPANET into the Milnet and Internet sides, and\n           surviving\
    \ the advent of Unix in 1985.  All in all, my most\n           memorable times\
    \ are the people who have contributed to the\n           research and development\
    \ of the Internet.  Lots of hard,\n           intense work, coupled with creative,\
    \ exciting fun.  As for\n           the future, there is much discussion and enthusiasm\
    \ about the\n           next step in the evolution of the Internet.  An\n    \
    \       \"international\" Internet is on the very tip of the horizon.\n      \
    \     Utilizing the global Internet will improve the quality of\n           collaborative\
    \ research.  I'm looking forward.\n      4.18 Gregory Vaudreuil, IESG Member\n\
