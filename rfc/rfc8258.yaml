  title: Table of Contents

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the
    reader is\n   expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture, associated\n
    \  terminology, and protocol standards: notably, but not limited to,\n   [RFC3945],
    [RFC4202], [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].\n   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
    (ISCD) [RFC4202] allows\n   routing protocols such as OSPF and ISIS to carry technology-specific\n
    \  information in the Switching Capability-specific information field,\n   see
    [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  The format of an SCSI field is dictated\n   by the specific
    technology being represented as indicated by the ISCD\n   Switching Capability
    field.  Existing Switching Capabilities are\n   managed by IANA in the \"Switching
    Types\" registry\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters> and
    the\n   related \"IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB\" definitions.\n   [RFC7138] introduced a
    \"sub-TLV\" structure to its technology-specific\n   SCSI field.  The sub-TLV-based
    approach allows for greater\n   flexibility in the structure, ordering, and ability
    to support\n   extensions of the SC-specific format.  This Sub-TLV approach is
    also\n   used in [RFC7688].\n   This document generalizes this approach and defines
    a new generalized\n   SCSI field format for use by future specific technologies
    and\n   Switching Capability types.  The generalized SCSI carries SCSI-TLVs\n
    \  that may be defined within the scope of a specific technology or\n   shared
    across multiple technologies (e.g., [AVAIL-EXT]).  This\n   document also establishes
    a registry for SCSI-TLV definitions that\n   may be shared across multiple technologies.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n   The reader is expected to be familiar with GMPLS terminology
    (e.g.,\n   as found in [RFC3945]) as well as the terminology used in [RFC4202],\n
    \  [RFC4203], and [RFC5307].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Generalized SCSI Formats\n   The Generalized SCSI is composed of zero or
    more variable-length TLV\n   fields each of which is called an \"SCSI-TLV\".  There
    are no specific\n   size restrictions on these SCSI-TLVs.  Size and other formatting\n
    \  restrictions may be imposed by the routing protocol ISCD field (refer\n   to
    [RFC4203] and [RFC5307]).  Please refer to [RFC3630] for the\n   treatment of
    malformed Link TLVs.\n   The SCSI-TLV format is:\n       0                   1
    \                  2                   3\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4
    5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \      |             Type              |             Length            |\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \      ...                           Value                           ...\n       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \                          Figure 1: TLV Format\n   Type (2 octets):\n      This
    field indicates the type and structure of the information\n      contained in
    the Value field.\n   Length (2 octets):\n      This field MUST be set to the size,
    in octets (bytes), of the\n      Value field.  The value of the field MUST be
    zero or divisible by\n      4.  Note that this implies that the Value field can
    be omitted or\n      contain padding.\n   Value (variable):\n      A variable-length
    field, formatted according to the definition\n      indicated by value of the
    Type field.  This field can be omitted\n      for certain types.\n"
  title: 3.  Generalized SCSI Formats
- contents:
  - "4.  Procedures\n   The ISCD can include a Generalized SCSI when advertising technologies\n
    \  whose Switching Capability definition references this document.  The\n   corollary
    of this is that the Generalized SCSI MUST NOT be used for\n   ISCDs of technologies
    whose Switching Capability definition do not\n   reference this document.\n   The
    Generalized SCSI MAY contain a sequence of zero or more SCSI-\n   TLVs.  Sub-TLV
    parsing (format) errors MUST be treated as a malformed\n   ISCD.  SCSI-TLVs MUST
    be processed in the order received and, if re-\n   originated, ordering MUST be
    preserved.  Unknown SCSI-TLVs MUST be\n   ignored and transparently processed,
    i.e., re-originated when\n   appropriate.  Processing related to multiple SCSI-TLVs
    of the same\n   type may be further refined based on the definition on the type.\n"
  title: 4.  Procedures
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any security
    issue beyond those\n   discussed in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  As discussed there,
    the\n   information carried in ISCDs is not used for Shortest Path First\n   (SPF)
    computation or normal routing, and the extensions here defined\n   do not have
    a direct effect on IP routing.  Tampering with GMPLS\n   Traffic Engineering (TE)
    Link State Advertisements (LSAs) may have an\n   effect on the underlying transport
    network.  Mechanisms such as those\n   described in [RFC2154] and [RFC5304] to
    protect the transmission of\n   this information are suggested.\n"
  title: 5.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new SCSI-TLV that is carried
    in the SCSI\n   field of the ISCDs defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].  The SCSI-TLV\n
    \  includes a 16-bit type identifier (the Type field).  The same Type\n   field
    values are applicable to the new SCSI-TLV.\n   IANA has created and will maintain
    a new registry, the \"Generalized\n   SCSI (Switching Capability Specific Information)
    TLV Types\" registry\n   under the \"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS)\n   Signaling Parameters\" registry.\n   The initial contents of this
    registry are as follows:\n       Value       SCSI-TLV                Switching
    Type   Reference\n       ---------   ----------------------- --------------   ---------\n
    \      0           Reserved                                 [RFC8258]\n       1-65535
    \    Unassigned              (value list)\n   New allocation requests to this
    registry must indicate the value or\n   values to be used in the Switching Type
    column.\n   The registry should be established with registration policies of\n
    \  \"Specification Required\", see [RFC8126].\n"
