- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] requires that when a BGP speaker receives\
    \ an\n   OPEN message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the\n\
    \   speaker must terminate BGP peering. This complicates introduction of\n   new\
    \ capabilities in BGP.\n   This document defines new Optional Parameter, called\
    \ Capabilities,\n   that is expected to facilitate introduction of new capabilities\
    \ in\n   BGP by providing graceful capability advertisement without requiring\n\
    \   that BGP peering be terminated.\n"
- title: 1. Overview of Operations
  contents:
  - "1. Overview of Operations\n   When a BGP speaker that supports capabilities advertisement\
    \ sends an\n   OPEN message to its BGP peer, the message may include an Optional\n\
    \   Parameter, called Capabilities. The parameter lists the capabilities\n   supported\
    \ by the speaker.\n   A BGP speaker determines the capabilities supported by its\
    \ peer by\n   examining the list of capabilities present in the Capabilities\n\
    \   Optional Parameter carried by the OPEN message that the speaker\n   receives\
    \ from the peer.\n   A BGP speaker that supports a particular capability may use\
    \ this\n   capability with its peer after the speaker determines (as described\n\
    \   above) that the peer supports this capability.\n   A BGP speaker determines\
    \ that its peer doesn't support capabilities\n   advertisement, if in response\
    \ to an OPEN message that carries the\n   Capabilities Optional Parameter, the\
    \ speaker receives a NOTIFICATION\n   message with the Error Subcode set to Unsupported\
    \ Optional Parameter.\n   In this case the speaker should attempt to re-establish\
    \ a BGP\n   connection with the peer without sending to the peer the Capabilities\n\
    \   Optional Parameter.\n   If a BGP speaker that supports a certain capability\
    \ determines that\n   its peer doesn't support this capability, the speaker may\
    \ send a\n   NOTIFICATION message to the peer, and terminate peering. The Error\n\
    \   Subcode in the message is set to Unsupported Capability. The message\n   should\
    \ contain the capability (capabilities) that causes the speaker\n   to send the\
    \ message.  The decision to send the message and terminate\n   peering is local\
    \ to the speaker.  Such peering should not be re-\n   established automatically.\n"
- title: '2. Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):'
  contents:
  - "2. Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):\n   This is an Optional\
    \ Parameter that is used by a BGP speaker to convey\n   to its BGP peer the list\
    \ of capabilities supported by the speaker.\n   The parameter contains one or\
    \ more triples <Capability Code,\n   Capability Length, Capability Value>, where\
    \ each triple is encoded as\n   shown below:\n      +------------------------------+\n\
    \      | Capability Code (1 octet)    |\n      +------------------------------+\n\
    \      | Capability Length (1 octet)  |\n      +------------------------------+\n\
    \      | Capability Value (variable)  |\n      +------------------------------+\n\
    \   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:\n      Capability Code:\n\
    \         Capability Code is a one octet field that unambiguously\n         identifies\
    \ individual capabilities.\n      Capability Length:\n         Capability Length\
    \ is a one octet field that contains the length\n         of the Capability Value\
    \ field in octets.\n      Capability Value:\n         Capability Value is a variable\
    \ length field that is interpreted\n         according to the value of the Capability\
    \ Code field.\n   A particular capability, as identified by its Capability Code,\
    \ may\n   occur more than once within the Optional Parameter.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Extensions to Error Handling\n   This document defines new Error Subcode -\
    \ Unsupported Capability.\n   The value of this Subcode is 7. The Data field in\
    \ the NOTIFICATION\n   message lists the set of capabilities that cause the speaker\
    \ to send\n   the message.  Each such capability is encoded the same way as it\
    \ was\n   encoded in the received OPEN message.\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   Section 4 defines a Capability Optional Parameter\
    \ along with an\n   Capability Code field. IANA is expected to create and maintain\
    \ the\n   registry for Capability Code values. Capability Code value 0 is\n  \
    \ reserved. Capability Code values 1 through 63 are to be assigned by\n   IANA\
    \ using the \"IETF Consensus\" policy defined in RFC2434. Capability\n   Code\
    \ values 64 through 127 are to be assigned by IANA, using the\n   \"First  Come\
    \ First Served\" policy defined in RFC2434. Capability Code\n   values 128 through\
    \ 255 are for \"Private Use\" as defined in RFC2434.\n"
