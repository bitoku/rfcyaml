- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the base BGP specification [RFC4271], the Autonomous\
    \ System (AS)\n   number is encoded as a two-octet entity.  To prepare for the\n\
    \   anticipated exhaustion of the two-octet AS numbers, this document\n   describes\
    \ extensions to BGP to carry the AS numbers as four-octet\n   entities.\n   More\
    \ specifically, this document defines a BGP capability code,\n   \"support for\
    \ four-octet AS number capability\", to be used by a BGP\n   speaker to indicate\
    \ its support for four-octet AS numbers.  Two\n   attributes, AS4_PATH and AS4_AGGREGATOR,\
    \ are introduced that can be\n   used to propagate four-octet-based AS path information\
    \ across BGP\n   speakers that do not support four-octet AS numbers.  This document\n\
    \   also specifies mechanisms for constructing the AS path information\n   from\
    \ the AS_PATH attribute and the AS4_PATH attribute.\n   The extensions specified\
    \ in this document allow a gradual transition\n   from two-octet AS numbers to\
    \ four-octet AS numbers.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4893 and updates RFC\
    \ 4271.  It includes\n   several clarifications and editorial changes, and it\
    \ specifies the\n   error handling for the new attributes.\n"

- title: 3.  Protocol Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Extensions\n   For the purpose of this document, we define a BGP\
    \ speaker that does\n   not support the new four-octet AS number extensions as\
    \ an OLD BGP\n   speaker, and a BGP speaker that supports the new four-octet AS\
    \ number\n   extensions as a NEW BGP speaker.\n   BGP carries the AS numbers in\
    \ the \"My Autonomous System\" field of the\n   OPEN message, in the AS_PATH attribute\
    \ of the UPDATE message, and in\n   the AGGREGATOR attribute of the UPDATE message.\
    \  BGP also carries the\n   AS numbers in the BGP Communities attribute.\n   A\
    \ NEW BGP speaker uses BGP Capabilities Advertisements [RFC5492] to\n   advertise\
    \ to its neighbors (either internal or external) that it\n   supports four-octet\
    \ AS number extensions, as specified in this\n   document.\n   The capability\
    \ that is used by a BGP speaker to convey to its BGP\n   peer the four-octet Autonomous\
    \ System number capability also carries\n   the AS number (encoded as a four-octet\
    \ entity) of the speaker in the\n   Capability Value field of the capability.\
    \  The Capability Length\n   field of the capability is set to 4.\n   The AS path\
    \ information exchanged between NEW BGP speakers is carried\n   in the existing\
    \ AS_PATH attribute, except that each AS number in the\n   attribute is encoded\
    \ as a four-octet entity (instead of a two-octet\n   entity).  The same applies\
    \ to the AGGREGATOR attribute -- the same\n   attribute is used between NEW BGP\
    \ speakers, except that the AS number\n   carried in the attribute is encoded\
    \ as a four-octet entity.\n   The AS_PATH attribute and the AGGREGATOR attribute\
    \ carried between a\n   NEW BGP speaker and an OLD BGP speaker will continue to\
    \ contain\n   two-octet AS numbers.\n   To preserve the AS path information with\
    \ four-octet AS numbers across\n   OLD BGP speakers, this document defines a new\
    \ BGP path attribute\n   called AS4_PATH.  This is an optional transitive attribute\
    \ that\n   contains the AS path encoded with four-octet AS numbers.  The\n   AS4_PATH\
    \ attribute has the same semantics and the same encoding as\n   the AS_PATH attribute,\
    \ except that it is \"optional transitive\", and\n   it carries four-octet AS\
    \ numbers.\n   To prevent the possible propagation of Confederation-related path\n\
    \   segments outside of a Confederation, the path segment types\n   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ and AS_CONFED_SET [RFC5065] are declared invalid\n   for the AS4_PATH attribute\
    \ and MUST NOT be included in the AS4_PATH\n   attribute of an UPDATE message.\n\
    \   Similarly, this document defines a new BGP path attribute called\n   AS4_AGGREGATOR,\
    \ which is optional transitive.  The AS4_AGGREGATOR\n   attribute has the same\
    \ semantics and the same encoding as the\n   AGGREGATOR attribute, except that\
    \ it carries a four-octet AS number.\n   Currently assigned two-octet AS numbers\
    \ are converted into four-octet\n   AS numbers by setting the two high-order octets\
    \ of the four-octet\n   field to zero.  Such a four-octet AS number is said to\
    \ be mappable to\n   a two-octet AS number.\n   This document reserves a two-octet\
    \ AS number called \"AS_TRANS\".\n   AS_TRANS can be used to represent non-mappable\
    \ four-octet AS numbers\n   as two-octet AS numbers in AS path information that\
    \ is encoded with\n   two-octet AS numbers.  (In this context, four-octet AS numbers\
    \ that\n   are not mapped from two-octet AS numbers are referred to as\n   \"\
    non-mappable\".) We denote this special AS number as AS_TRANS for\n   ease of\
    \ description in the rest of this specification.  This AS\n   number is also placed\
    \ in the \"My Autonomous System\" field of the OPEN\n   message originated by\
    \ a NEW BGP speaker, if and only if the speaker\n   does not have a (globally\
    \ unique) two-octet AS number.\n"

- title: 4.2.2.  Generating Updates
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Generating Updates\n   When communicating with an OLD BGP speaker, a\
    \ NEW BGP speaker MUST\n   send the AS path information in the AS_PATH attribute\
    \ encoded with\n   two-octet AS numbers.  The NEW BGP speaker MUST also send the\
    \ AS path\n   information in the AS4_PATH attribute (encoded with four-octet AS\n\
    \   numbers), except for the case where all of the AS path information is\n  \
    \ composed of mappable four-octet AS numbers only.  In this case, the\n   NEW\
    \ BGP speaker MUST NOT send the AS4_PATH attribute.\n   In the AS_PATH attribute\
    \ encoded with two-octet AS numbers,\n   non-mappable four-octet AS numbers are\
    \ represented by the well-known\n   two-octet AS number, AS_TRANS.  This will\
    \ preserve the path length\n   property of the AS path information and also help\
    \ in updating the AS\n   path information received on a NEW BGP speaker from an\
    \ OLD BGP\n   speaker, as explained in the next section.\n   The NEW BGP speaker\
    \ constructs the AS4_PATH attribute from the AS\n   path information.  Whenever\
    \ the AS path information contains the\n   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET\
    \ path segment, the NEW BGP speaker\n   MUST exclude such path segments from the\
    \ AS4_PATH attribute being\n   constructed.\n   The AS4_PATH attribute, being\
    \ optional transitive, will be carried\n   across a series of OLD BGP speakers\
    \ without modification and will\n   help preserve the non-mappable four-octet\
    \ AS numbers in the AS path\n   information.\n   Similarly, if the NEW BGP speaker\
    \ has to send the AGGREGATOR\n   attribute, and if the aggregating Autonomous\
    \ System's AS number is a\n   non-mappable four-octet AS number, then the speaker\
    \ MUST use the\n   AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute and set the AS number field in the\
    \ existing\n   AGGREGATOR attribute to the reserved AS number, AS_TRANS.  Note\
    \ that\n   if the AS number is mappable, then the AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST\n\
    \   NOT be sent.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Processing Received Updates
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Processing Received Updates\n   When a NEW BGP speaker receives an update\
    \ from an OLD BGP speaker, it\n   MUST be prepared to receive the AS4_PATH attribute\
    \ along with the\n   existing AS_PATH attribute.  If the AS4_PATH attribute is\
    \ also\n   received, both of the attributes will be used to construct the exact\n\
    \   AS path information, and therefore the information carried by both of\n  \
    \ the attributes will be considered for AS path loop detection.\n   Note that\
    \ a route may have traversed a series of Autonomous Systems\n   with two-octet\
    \ AS numbers and OLD BGP speakers only.  In that case,\n   if the route carries\
    \ the AS4_PATH attribute, this attribute would\n   have remained unmodified since\
    \ the route left the last NEW BGP\n   speaker.  The trailing AS path information\
    \ (representing Autonomous\n   Systems with two-octet AS numbers and OLD BGP speakers\
    \ only) is\n   contained only in the current AS_PATH attribute (encoded in the\n\
    \   leading part of the AS_PATH attribute).\n   Under certain conditions, it may\
    \ not be possible to reconstruct all\n   of the AS path information from the AS_PATH\
    \ and the AS4_PATH\n   attributes of a route.  This occurs, for example, when\
    \ two or more\n   routes that carry the AS4_PATH attribute are aggregated by an\
    \ OLD BGP\n   speaker, and the AS4_PATH attribute of at least one of these routes\n\
    \   carries at least one four-octet AS number (as opposed to a two-octet\n   AS\
    \ number that is encoded in 4 octets).  Depending on the\n   implementation, either\
    \ the AS4_PATH attribute would be lost during\n   route aggregation, or both the\
    \ AS_PATH attribute and the AS4_PATH\n   attribute would contain valid, partial\
    \ information that cannot be\n   combined seamlessly, resulting in incomplete\
    \ AS path information in\n   these cases.\n   A NEW BGP speaker MUST also be prepared\
    \ to receive the AS4_AGGREGATOR\n   attribute along with the AGGREGATOR attribute\
    \ from an OLD BGP\n   speaker.  When both of the attributes are received, if the\
    \ AS number\n   in the AGGREGATOR attribute is not AS_TRANS, then:\n      -  the\
    \ AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute and the AS4_PATH attribute SHALL\n         be ignored,\n\
    \      -  the AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be taken as the information\n       \
    \  about the aggregating node, and\n      -  the AS_PATH attribute SHALL be taken\
    \ as the AS path\n         information.\n   Otherwise,\n      -  the AGGREGATOR\
    \ attribute SHALL be ignored,\n      -  the AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be\
    \ taken as the information\n         about the aggregating node, and\n      -\
    \  the AS path information would need to be constructed, as in all\n         other\
    \ cases.\n   In order to construct the AS path information, it is necessary to\n\
    \   first calculate the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH and AS4_PATH\n   attributes\
    \ using the method specified in Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271]\n   and in [RFC5065]\
    \ for route selection.\n   If the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute\
    \ is less than the\n   number of AS numbers in the AS4_PATH attribute, then the\
    \ AS4_PATH\n   attribute SHALL be ignored, and the AS_PATH attribute SHALL be\
    \ taken\n   as the AS path information.\n   If the number of AS numbers in the\
    \ AS_PATH attribute is larger than\n   or equal to the number of AS numbers in\
    \ the AS4_PATH attribute, then\n   the AS path information SHALL be constructed\
    \ by taking as many AS\n   numbers and path segments as necessary from the leading\
    \ part of the\n   AS_PATH attribute, and then prepending them to the AS4_PATH\
    \ attribute\n   so that the AS path information has a number of AS numbers identical\n\
    \   to that of the AS_PATH attribute.  Note that a valid\n   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ or AS_CONFED_SET path segment SHALL be prepended\n   if it is either the leading\
    \ path segment or is adjacent to a path\n   segment that is prepended.\n"

  - "5.  Handling BGP Communities\n   As specified in [RFC1997], when the high-order\
    \ two octets of the\n   community attribute is neither 0x0000 nor 0xffff, these\
    \ two octets\n   encode the AS number.  Quite clearly, this would not work for\
    \ a NEW\n   BGP speaker with a non-mappable four-octet AS number.  Such BGP\n\

    \ that Autonomous System have been\n   upgraded to support four-octet AS numbers.\n\
    \   A non-mappable four-octet AS number cannot be used as a \"Member AS\n   Number\"\
    \ of a BGP Confederation until all the BGP speakers within the\n   Confederation\

    \   The inconsistency between the AS_PATH attribute and the AS4_PATH\n   attribute\
    \ can create loss of the AS path information, and potential\n   routing loops\
    \ in certain cases, as discussed in this document.  This\n   could be exploited\
    \ by an attacker.\n   It is a misconfiguration to assign a non-mappable four-octet\
    \ AS\n   number as the \"Member AS Number\" in a BGP Confederation before all\n\
    \   the BGP speakers within the Confederation have transitioned to\n   support\
    \ four-octet AS numbers.  Such a misconfiguration would weaken\n   AS path loop\
    \ detection within a Confederation.\n"
