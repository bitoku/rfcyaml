    \ for developing a comprehensive authentication and\n   authorization solution\
    \ for this class of scenarios.\n   Where specific details are relevant, it is\
    \ assumed that the devices\n   use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ as a communication\n   protocol.  However, most conclusions apply generally.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Constrained devices [RFC7228] are nodes with limited processing\n\
    \   power, storage space, and transmission capacities.  These devices are\n  \
    \ often battery-powered and in many cases do not provide user\n   interfaces.\n\
    \   Constrained devices benefit from being interconnected using Internet\n   protocols.\
    \  However, deploying common security protocols can\n   sometimes be difficult\
    \ because of device or network limitations.\n   Regardless, adequate security\
    \ mechanisms are required to protect\n   these constrained devices, which are\
    \ expected to be integrated in all\n   aspects of everyday life, from attackers\
    \ wishing to gain control over\n   the device's data or functions.\n   This document\
    \ comprises a collection of representative use cases for\n   the application of\
    \ authentication and authorization in constrained\n   environments.  These use\
    \ cases aim at identifying authorization\n   problems that arise during the life\
    \ cycle of a constrained device.\n   Note that this document does not aim at collecting\
    \ all possible use\n   cases.\n   We assume that the communication between the\
    \ devices is based on the\n   Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural\
    \ style, i.e., a\n   device acts as a server that offers resources such as sensor\
    \ data and\n   actuators.  The resources can be accessed by clients, sometimes\n\
    \   without human intervention (M2M).  In some situations, the\n   communication\
    \ will happen through intermediaries (e.g., gateways,\n   proxies).\n   Where\
    \ specific detail is necessary, it is assumed that the devices\n   communicate\
    \ using CoAP [RFC7252], although most conclusions are\n   generic.\n"

- title: 2.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "2.  Use Cases\n   This section includes the use cases; each use case first presents\
    \ a\n   general description of the application environment, then one or more\n\
    \   specific use cases, and finally a summary of the authorization-\n   related\
    \ problems to be solved.  The document aims at listing the\n   relevant authorization\
    \ problems and not to provide an exhaustive\n   list.  It might not be possible\
    \ to address all of the listed problems\n   with a single solution; there might\
    \ be conflicting goals within or\n   among some requirements.\n   There are various\
    \ reasons for assigning a function (client or server)\n   to a device.  The function\
    \ may even change over time; e.g., the\n   device that initiates a conversation\
    \ is temporarily assigned the role\n   of client, but could act as a server in\
    \ another context.  The\n   definition of the function of a device in a certain\
    \ use case is not\n   in scope of this document.  Readers should be aware that\
    \ there might\n   be reasons for each setting and that endpoints might even have\n\
    \   different functions at different times.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Container Monitoring\n   The ability of sensors to communicate environmental\
    \ data wirelessly\n   opens up new application areas.  Sensor systems make it\
    \ possible to\n   continuously track and transmit characteristics such as temperature,\n\
    \   humidity, and gas content while goods are transported and stored.\n   Sensors\
    \ in this scenario have to be associated with the appropriate\n   pallet of the\
    \ respective container.  Sensors, as well as the goods,\n   belong to specific\
    \ customers.\n   While in transit, goods often pass stops where they are transloaded\n\
    \   to other means of transportation, e.g., from ship transport to road\n   transport.\n\
    \   Perishable goods need to be stored at a constant temperature and with\n  \
    \ proper ventilation.  Real-time information on the state of the goods\n   is\
    \ needed by both the transporter and the vendor.  Transporters want\n   to prioritize\
    \ goods that will expire soon.  Vendors want to react\n   when goods are spoiled\
    \ to continue to fulfill delivery obligations.\n   The Intelligent Container <http://www.intelligentcontainer.com>\
    \ is an\n   example project that explores solutions to continuously monitor\n\
    \   perishable goods.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Bananas for Munich
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Bananas for Munich\n   A fruit vendor grows bananas in Costa Rica for\
    \ the German market.  It\n   instructs a transport company to deliver the goods\
    \ via ship to\n   Rotterdam where they are picked up by trucks and transported\
    \ to a\n   ripening facility.  A Munich supermarket chain buys ripened bananas\n\
    \   from the fruit vendor and transports them from the ripening facility\n   to\
    \ the individual markets with their own company's trucks.\n   The fruit vendor's\
    \ quality management wants to assure the quality of\n   their products; thus,\
    \ it equips the banana boxes with sensors.  The\n   state of the goods is monitored\
    \ consistently during shipment and\n   ripening, and abnormal sensor values are\
    \ recorded (U1.2).\n   Additionally, the sensor values are used to control the\
    \ climate\n   within the cargo containers (U1.1, U1.5, U1.7).  Therefore, the\n\
    \   sensors need to communicate with the climate-control system.  Since\n   an\
    \ incorrect sensor value leads to a wrong temperature, and thus to\n   spoiled\
    \ goods, the integrity of the sensor data must be assured\n   (U1.2, U1.3).  The\
    \ banana boxes within a container will, in most\n   cases, belong to the same\
    \ owner.  Adjacent containers might contain\n   goods and sensors of different\
    \ owners (U1.1).\n   The personnel that transloads the goods must be able to locate\
    \ the\n   goods meant for a specific customer (U1.1, U1.6, U1.7).  However, the\n\
    \   fruit vendor does not want to disclose sensor information pertaining\n   to\
    \ the condition of the goods to other companies and therefore wants\n   to assure\
    \ the confidentiality of this data (U1.4).  Thus, the\n   transloading personnel\
    \ is only allowed to access logistic information\n   (U1.1).  Moreover, the transloading\
    \ personnel is only allowed to\n   access the data for the time of the transloading\
    \ (U1.8).\n   Due to the high water content of the fruits, the propagation of\
    \ radio\n   waves is hindered, thus often inhibiting direct communication between\n\
    \   nodes [Jedermann14].  Instead, messages are forwarded over multiple\n   hops\
    \ (U1.9).  The sensors in the banana boxes cannot always reach the\n   Internet\
    \ during the journey (U1.10).  Sensors may need to use relay\n   stations owned\
    \ by the transport company to connect to endpoints on\n   the Internet.\n   In\
    \ the ripening facility bananas are stored until they are ready to\n   be sold.\
    \  The banana box sensors are used to control the ventilation\n   system and to\
    \ monitor the degree of ripeness of the bananas.  Ripe\n   bananas need to be\
    \ identified and sold before they spoil (U1.2,\n   U1.8).\n   The supermarket\
    \ chain gains ownership of the banana boxes when the\n   bananas have ripened\
    \ and are ready to leave the ripening facility.\n"

    \ requires the integrity and authenticity of\n           the sensor data that\
    \ pertains to the state of the goods for\n           climate control and to ensure\

    \ may not be present\n           at the time of access and cannot manually intervene\
    \ in the\n           authorization process.\n   U1.8:   The fruit vendor, container\

    \   The fruit vendor, container owner, and transloading company\n           want\
    \ their security objectives to be achieved, even if the\n           messages between\
    \ the endpoints need to be forwarded over\n           multiple hops.\n   U1.10:\
    \  The constrained devices might not always be able to reach the\n           Internet\
    \ but still need to enact the authorization policies\n           of their principals.\n\
    \   U1.11:  Fruit vendors and container owners want to be able to revoke\n   \
    \        authorization on a malfunctioning sensor.\n"

    \ eHealth devices, are\n   typically battery-driven and located physically on\
    \ or in the user to\n   monitor some bodily function, such as temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, or\n   pulse rate.  These devices typically connect to the Internet\
    \ through\n   an intermediary base station, using wireless technologies and through\n\
    \   this connection they report the monitored data to some entity, which\n   may\
    \ either be the user or a medical caregiver.\n   Medical data has always been\
    \ considered very sensitive, and therefore\n   requires good protection against\
    \ unauthorized disclosure.  A\n   frequent, conflicting requirement is the capability\
    \ for medical\n   personnel to gain emergency access, even if no specific access\
    \ rights\n   exist.  As a result, the importance of secure audit logs increases\
    \ in\n   such scenarios.\n   Since the users are not typically trained in security\
    \ (or even\n   computer use), the configuration must use secure default settings,\n\
    \   and the interface must be well adapted to novice users.  Parts of the\n  \
    \ system must operate with minimal maintenance.  Especially frequent\n   changes\
    \ of battery are unacceptable.\n   There is a plethora of wearable health monitoring\

  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  John and the Heart Rate Monitor\n   John has a heart condition that can\
    \ result in sudden cardiac arrests.\n   He therefore uses a device called \"HeartGuard\"\
    \ that monitors his\n   heart rate and his location (U3.7).  In the event of a\
    \ cardiac\n   arrest, it automatically sends an alarm to an emergency service,\n\
    \   transmitting John's current location (U3.1).  Either the device has\n   long-range\
    \ connectivity itself (e.g., via GSM) or it uses some\n   intermediary, nearby\
    \ device (e.g., John's smartphone) to transmit\n   such an alarm.  To ensure John's\
    \ safety, the device is expected to be\n   in constant operation (U3.3, U3.6).\n\
    \   The device includes an authentication mechanism to prevent other\n   persons\
    \ who get physical access to it from acting as the owner and\n   altering the\
    \ access control and security settings (U3.8).\n   John can configure a list of\
    \ people that get notified in an\n   emergency, for example his daughter Jill.\
    \  Furthermore, the device\n   stores data on John's heart rate, which can later\
    \ be accessed by a\n   physician to assess the condition of John's heart (U3.2).\n\
    \   However, John is a privacy-conscious person and is worried that Jill\n   might\
    \ use HeartGuard to monitor his location even when there is no\n   emergency.\
    \  Furthermore, he doesn't want his health insurance to get\n   access to the\
    \ HeartGuard data, or even to the fact that he is wearing\n   a HeartGuard, since\
    \ they might refuse to renew his insurance if they\n   decided he was too great\
    \ of a risk for them (U3.8).\n   Finally, John, while being comfortable with modern\
    \ technology and\n   able to operate it reasonably well, is not trained in computer\n\
    \   security.  Therefore, he needs an interface for the configuration of\n   the\
    \ HeartGuard security that is easy to understand and use (U3.5).\n   If John does\
    \ not understand the meaning of a setting, he tends to\n   leave it alone, assuming\
    \ that the manufacturer has initialized the\n   device to secure settings (U3.4).\n\
    \   Note: Monitoring of some state parameter (e.g., an alarm button) and\n   the\
    \ position of a person also fits well into a nursing service\n   context.  This\
    \ is particularly useful for people suffering from\n   dementia, where the relatives\
    \ or caregivers need to be notified of\n   the whereabouts of the person under\
    \ certain conditions.  In that\n   case, it is not the patient that decides about\
    \ access.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.1.  Installation and Commissioning\n   Installation of the building automation\
    \ components often start even\n   before the construction work is completed. \
    \ Lighting is one of the\n   first components to be installed in new buildings.\
    \  A lighting plan\n   created by a lighting designer provides the necessary information\n\
    \   related to the kind of lighting devices (luminaires, sensors, and\n   switches)\
    \ to be installed along with their expected behavior.  The\n   physical installation\
    \ of the correct lighting devices at the right\n   locations are done by electricians\
    \ based on the lighting plan.  They\n   ensure that the electrical wiring is performed\
    \ according to local\n   regulations and lighting devices, which may be from multiple\n\
    \   manufacturers, are connected to the electrical power supply properly.\n  \
    \ After the installation, lighting can be used in a default out-of-box\n   mode,\
    \ e.g., at full brightness when powered on.  After this step (or\n   in parallel\
    \ in a different section of the building), a lighting\n   commissioner adds the\
    \ devices to the building domain (U4.1) and\n   performs the proper configuration\
    \ of the lights as prescribed in the\n   lighting plan.  This involves, for example,\
    \ grouping to ensure that\n   light points react together, more or less synchronously\
    \ (U4.8) and\n   defining lighting scenes for particular areas of the building.\
    \  The\n   commissioning is often done in phases, either by one or more\n   commissioners,\
    \ on different floors.  The building lighting network at\n   this stage may be\
    \ in different network islands with no connectivity\n   between them due to lack\
    \ of the IT infrastructure.\n   After this, other building components, like HVAC\
    \ and security\n   systems, are similarly installed by electricians and later\n\
    \   commissioned by their respective domain professionals.  Similar\n   configurations\
    \ related to grouping (U4.8) are required to ensure,\n   e.g., HVAC equipment\
    \ is controlled by the closest temperature sensor.\n   For the building IT systems,\
    \ the Ethernet wiring is initially laid\n   out in the building according to the\
    \ IT plan.  The IT network is\n   often commissioned after the construction is\
    \ completed to avoid any\n   damage to sensitive networking and computing equipment.\
    \  The\n   commissioning is performed by an IT engineer with additional switches\n\
    \   (wired and/or wireless), IP routers, and computing devices.  Direct\n   Internet\
    \ connectivity for all installed/commissioned devices in the\n   building is only\
    \ available at this point.  The BLMS that monitors and\n   controls the various\
    \ building automation components is only connected\n   to the field devices at\
    \ this stage.  The different network islands\n   (for lighting and HVAC) are also\
    \ joined together without any further\n   involvement of domain specialists, such\
    \ as lighting or HVAC\n   commissioners.\n"

    \ hires an external installation and\n   commissioning company to perform the\
    \ changes.\n   Different parts of the building are rented out to different companies\n\
    \   for office space.  The tenants are provided access to use the\n   automated\
    \ HVAC, lighting, and physical access control systems\n   deployed.  The safety\
    \ of the occupants is also managed using\n   automated systems, such as a fire-alarm\
    \ system, which is triggered by\n   several smoke detectors that are spread out\
    \ across the building.\n   Company A's staff moves into the newly furnished office\

    \   lighting brightness and color in their offices by using the switches\n   or\
    \ handheld controllers.  Such changes are allowed only if the\n   authorization\
    \ rules exist in the BLMS.  For example, lighting in the\n   corridors may not\
    \ be manually adjustable.\n   At the end of the day, lighting is dimmed or switched\
    \ off if no\n   occupancy is detected, even if manually overridden during the\
    \ day.\n   On a later date, Company B also moves into the same building, and\n\

  - "2.5.3.  Advanced Metering Infrastructure\n   A utility company is updating its\
    \ old utility distribution network\n   with advanced meters and new communication\
    \ systems, known as an\n   Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).  AMI refers\
    \ to a system that\n   measures, collects, and analyzes usage, and interacts with\
    \ metering\n   devices such as electricity meters, gas meters, heat meters, and\n\
    \   water meters, through various communication media either on request\n   (on-demand)\
    \ or on predefined schedules.  Based on this technology,\n   new services make\
    \ it possible for consumers to control their utility\n   consumption (U5.2, U5.7)\
    \ and reduce costs by supporting new tariff\n   models from utility companies,\
    \ and more accurate and timely billing.\n   However, the end consumers do not\
    \ want unauthorized persons to gain\n   access to this data.  Furthermore, the\
    \ fine-grained measurement of\n   consumption data may induce privacy concerns,\
    \ since it may allow\n   others to create behavioral profiles (U5.5, U5.10).\n\
    \   The technical solution is based on levels of data aggregation between\n  \
    \ smart meters located at the consumer premises and the Meter Data\n   Management\
    \ (MDM) system located at the utility company (U5.9).  For\n   reasons of efficiency\
    \ and cost, end-to-end connectivity is not always\n   feasible, so metering data\
    \ is stored and aggregated in various\n   intermediate devices before being forwarded\
    \ to the utility company,\n   and in turn accessed by the MDM.  The intermediate\
    \ devices may be\n   operated by a third-party service operator on behalf of the\
    \ utility\n   company (U5.7).  One responsibility of the service operator is to\n\
    \   make sure that meter readings are performed and delivered in a\n   regular,\
    \ timely manner.  An example of a Service Level Agreement\n   between the service\
    \ operator and the utility company is, for example,\n   at least 95% of the meters\

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   As the use cases listed in this document demonstrate,\
    \ constrained\n   devices are used in various environments.  These devices are\
    \ small\n   and inexpensive and this makes it easy to integrate them into many\n\
    \   aspects of everyday life.  With access to vast amounts of valuable\n   data\
    \ and possible control of important functions, these devices need\n   to be protected\
    \ from unauthorized access.  Protecting seemingly\n   innocuous data and functions\
    \ will lessen the possible effects of\n   aggregation; attackers collecting data\
    \ or functions from several\n   sources can gain insights or a level of control\
    \ not immediately\n   obvious from each of these sources on its own.\n   Not only\
    \ the data on the constrained devices themselves is\n   threatened, the devices\
    \ might also be abused as an intrusion point to\n   infiltrate a network.  Once\
    \ an attacker gains control over the\n   device, it can be used to attack other\
    \ devices as well.  Due to their\n   limited capabilities, constrained devices\
    \ appear as the weakest link\n   in the network; hence, they pose an attractive\
    \ target for attackers.\n   This section summarizes the security problems highlighted\

- title: 3.1.  Attacks
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Attacks\n   This document lists security problems that users of constrained\n\
    \   devices want to solve.  Further analysis of attack scenarios is not\n   in\
    \ scope of the document.  However, there are attacks that must be\n   considered\
    \ by solution developers.\n   Because of the expected large number of devices\
    \ and their ubiquity,\n   constrained devices increase the danger from Pervasive\
    \ Monitoring\n   [RFC7258] attacks.  Solution Designers should consider this in\
    \ the\n   design of their security solution and provide for protection against\n\
    \   this type of attack.  In particular, messages containing sensitive\n   data\
    \ that are sent over unprotected channels should be encrypted if\n   possible.\n\
    \   Attacks aimed at altering data in transit (e.g., to perpetrate fraud)\n  \
    \ are a problem that is addressed in many web security protocols such\n   as TLS\
    \ or IPsec.  Developers need to consider these types of attacks,\n   and make\
    \ sure that the protection measures they implement are adapted\n   to the constrained\
    \ environment.\n   As some of the use cases indicate, constrained devices may\
    \ be\n   installed in hostile environments where they are physically\n   accessible\
    \ (see Section 2.5).  Protection from physical attacks is\n   not in the scope\
    \ of this document, but it should be kept in mind by\n   developers of authorization\
    \ solutions.\n   Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks threaten the availability of\
    \ services\n   a device provides and constrained devices are especially vulnerable\n\
    \   to these types of attacks because of their limitations.  Attackers\n   can\
    \ illicit a temporary or, if the battery is drained, permanent\n   failure in\
    \ a service simply by repeatedly flooding the device with\n   connection attempts;\
    \ for some services (see Section 2.3),\n   availability is especially important.\
    \  Solution designers must be\n   particularly careful to consider the following\
    \ limitations in every\n   part of the authorization solution:\n   o  Battery\
    \ usage\n   o  Number of required message exchanges\n   o  Size of data that is\
    \ transmitted (e.g., authentication and access\n      control data)\n   o  Size\
    \ of code required to run the protocols\n   o  Size of RAM memory and stack required\
    \ to run the protocols\n   o  Resources blocked by partially completed exchanges\
    \ (e.g., while\n      one party is waiting for a transaction time to run out)\n\
    \   Solution developers also need to consider whether the session should\n   be\
    \ protected from information disclosure and tampering.\n"
