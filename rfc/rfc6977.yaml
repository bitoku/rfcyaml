  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies two new DHCPv6 messages [RFC3315]:\n
    \  Reconfigure-Request and Reconfigure-Reply.\n   Section 3 describes a typical
    problem scenario encountered that\n   triggers the DHCPv6 server to issue a Reconfigure
    message when the\n   configuration data is supplied by the relay agent.  This
    problem may\n   be encountered in other contexts.  It is out of scope of this\n
    \  document to list all these cases.\n   Section 4 describes the proposed solution
    that relies on the use of\n   Reconfigure-Request and Reconfigure-Reply messages.
    \ The Reconfigure-\n   Request message is sent by a DHCPv6 relay agent to notify
    a DHCPv6\n   server about a configuration-information change, so that the DHCPv6\n
    \  server can send a Reconfigure message accordingly.  The Reconfigure-\n   Reply
    message is used by the server to acknowledge the receipt of\n   Reconfigure-Request.\n
    \  Section 5 specifies the Link Address Option used by the relay agent\n   to
    indicate the link on which the client is located to the server.\n   Section 6
    provides the detailed specification of the procedure to\n   trigger Reconfigure
    messages by DHCPv6 relay agents.\n"

  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   For cases where the DHCPv6 relay agent possesses some
    information\n   that would be useful to the DHCPv6 client, [RFC6422] specifies
    a\n   mechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information\n
    \  to the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to\n   the
    DHCP client.  This is achieved by use of RSOO (Relay-Supplied\n   Options option),
    which carries configuration data to the DHCPv6\n   server.  The data conveyed
    in an RSOO is then sent back by the DHCPv6\n   server to the requesting DHCPv6
    client.\n   An example of RSOO usage is shown in Figure 1; only a subset of\n
    \  exchanged DHCPv6 and RADIUS messages is represented.  Figure 1 shows\n   a
    broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS)\n   embeds
    a DHCPv6 relay agent.\n      +-------+                   +-------+                    +-------+\n

  title: 3.  Problem Statement
- contents:
  - "4.  Solution Overview\n   To solve the problem described in Section 3, this document
    proposes a\n   new DHCP message called Reconfigure-Request.  In the example depicted\n
    \  in Figure 3, a Reconfigure-Request message is sent by the DHCPv6\n   relay
    agent to a DHCPv6 server as soon as the configuration data\n   conveyed in an
    RSOO has changed.  Upon receipt of this message, and\n   if it is configured to
    support such a mode, the DHCPv6 server must\n   build Reconfigure-Reply and Reconfigure
    messages.  Reconfigure-Reply\n   is used to acknowledge the receipt of Reconfigure-Request.
    \ The\n   Reconfigure message encapsulated in Relay-Reply is sent to the DHCPv6\n
    \  relay, which in turn will forward the message to the appropriate\n   DHCPv6
    client.\n   This setup assumes the relay has a record of the client, so that it\n
    \  has enough information to send the Reconfigure-Request message to the\n   server.
    \ How the state is recorded in the relay is out of scope of\n   this document.
    \ For better resilience of the proposed solution, means\n   to recover state in
    the event of failure (e.g., use of stable\n   storage, DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery
    [RFC5460]) need to be supported.\n   These state recovery solutions are not discussed
    in this document.\n      +-------+                   +-------+                    +-------+\n

    \             Figure 3: Flow Example with Reconfigure-Request\n   The support
    of Reconfigure-Reply messages simplifies the\n   retransmission procedure of the
    relay as it provides an explicit\n   indication from the server (see Section 6.3
    for more details).  An\n   alternative approach is the relay monitors' Reconfigure
    messages\n   received from the server to conclude whether or not the Reconfigure-\n
    \  Request was successfully handled.  Nevertheless, this implicit\n   approach
    may fail to achieve its goals in some cases: for example,\n   the server accepts
    the request but it delays generating the\n   corresponding Reconfigure messages
    due to its rate-limiting policies,\n   the request was partially failed for some
    clients, etc.  To avoid\n   useless reconfigure cycles (e.g., due to the loss
    of Reconfigure-\n   Reply messages), the approach adopted in this document allows
    the\n   relay to correct the content of a retransmitted Reconfigure-Request\n
    \  based on some observed events (e.g., the client has retrieved the\n   updated
    configuration).  If the relay has no client to be\n   reconfigured, it stops sending
    Reconfigure-Request messages.\n   The Reconfigure-Request message can also be
    used in scenarios other\n   than those that assume the use of RSOO.  It is out
    of scope of this\n   document to describe all these scenarios.\n"

    - "6.3.  Creation and Transmission of a Reconfigure-Request\n   For any event
      (e.g., modification of the configuration information)\n   that requires the
      server to issue a Reconfigure message, the relay\n   agent determines the client(s)
      affected by the change and then builds\n   a Reconfigure-Request message: the
      relay agent sets the \"msg-type\"\n   field to RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, generates
      a transaction ID, and inserts\n   it in the \"transaction-id\" field.\n   The
      relay agent MUST include one or more Client Identifier Options\n   [RFC3315]
      and a Link Address Option (Section 5) so that the DHCPv6\n   server can identify
      the corresponding client and the link on which\n   the client is located.\n
      \  The relay agent MAY include a Relay Identifier Option [RFC5460].\n   The
      relay agent MAY supply the updated configuration in the RSOO\n   [RFC6422].
      \ The relay agent MAY supply a Reconfigure Message Option\n   to indicate which
      form of Reconfigure to use.  The relay agent MAY\n   include any option (e.g.,
      Interface Identifier [RFC3315]) that it\n   might insert when relaying a message
      received from a client.\n   When several clients on the same link are affected
      by a configuration\n   change, the relay MUST include several Client Identifier
      Options;\n   each of these options identifies a specific client.  If including
      the\n   Client Identifier Options of all impacted clients exceeds the maximum\n
      \  message size (see Section 7), the relay MUST generate several\n   Reconfigure-Request
      messages required to carry all Client Identifier\n   Options.  Rate-limit considerations
      are discussed in Section 7.\n   The relay sets the destination address of the
      Reconfigure-Request\n   message to the IP address it would have sent a Relay-Forward
      message\n   (see Section 20 of [RFC3315]).\n   In case multiple servers are
      configured to the relay agent, several\n   Reconfigure-Request messages are
      to be built.  The behavior of the\n   relay agent to disambiguate responses
      when multiple servers are\n   configured is implementation specific.  For example,
      an\n   implementation may generate a distinct \"transaction-id\" per server\n
      \  while another implementation may use the content of the \"transaction-\n
      \  id\" field and the Server Identifier Option to disambiguate the\n   responses.\n
      \  The relay transmits Reconfigure-Request messages according to\n   Section
      14 of [RFC3315], using the following parameters:\n     IRT (Initial retransmission
      time):      1 sec\n     MRT (Maximum retransmission time):     10 secs\n     MRC
      (Maximum retransmission count):     5\n     MRD (Maximum retransmission duration):
      \ 0\n   The relay MAY remove clients from the client identifier list in\n   subsequent
      retransmissions, but MUST NOT add clients to the client\n   identifier list.
      \ This decision is local to the relay (e.g., it may\n   be based on observed
      events such as one or more clients were\n   reconfigured on their own).\n   The
      relay may receive Reconfigure encapsulated in Relay-Reply before\n   Reconfigure-Reply.
      \ The relay SHOULD NOT interpret it as if the\n   Reconfigure-Request was successfully
      handled by the server.  The\n   relay SHOULD use Reconfigure-Reply, not the
      Reconfigure message, to\n   determine if the request was successful (see the
      discussion in\n   Section 4).\n"

      Reconfigure-\n   Request messages.  If no indication is explicitly configured
      to the\n   server, the default behavior is to reject Reconfigure-Request\n   messages.\n
      \  Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure-Request message from a DHCPv6\n   relay
      agent (see Section 6.2), the server determines the client(s)\n   for which a
      Reconfigure message is to be sent.\n   The server constructs a Reconfigure-Reply
      message by setting the\n   \"msg-type\" field to RECONFIGURE-REPLY and copying
      the transaction ID\n   from the Reconfigure-Request message into the \"transaction-id\"
      field.\n   The server includes its server identifier in a Server Identifier\n
      \  Option.  The server MUST include a Status Code Option [RFC3315]\n   indicating
      whether the request has been successfully processed,\n   failed, or partially
      failed.\n   o  If the server fails to process the request, the server MUST set\n
      \     the Status Code Option to the appropriate status code (e.g.,\n      UnspecFail,
      NotAllowed, etc.).  In particular,\n      *  UnspecFail MUST be returned if

      \     *  NotConfigured MUST be returned if the server has no record of\n         the
      link [RFC5007].\n   o  If the Reconfigure-Request is successfully validated,
      the server\n      MUST return a Status Code Option indicating \"Success\".  In\n

      Options of the clients to which Reconfigure messages\n      will not be sent
      (e.g., the server has no record of the client or\n      the client did not negotiate
      for Reconfigure support).  Note that\n      this means that \"Success\" will
      be returned even if Reconfigure\n      messages will not be sent to any of the
      clients.\n   If RSOO is supplied, the server might use its content to double
      check\n   whether a Reconfigure is required to be sent to the client.  This\n
      \  assumes the server stored the content of RSOO it used to generate the\n   configuration
      data sent to requesting clients.\n   The server might use the content of the
      Reconfigure Message Option\n   supplied by the relay agent to determine which
      form of Reconfigure to\n   use.\n   Then, the server MUST follow the procedure

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations elaborated in [RFC3315]
    (in particular\n   Section 21.1) and [RFC6422] must be taken into account.  In
    addition,\n   DHCPv6 servers MAY be configured to reject relayed Reconfigure-\n
    \  Request messages or restrict relay chaining (see [RFC5007] for more\n   discussion
    about the rationale of this recommended behavior).\n   Section 6.5 specifies the
    error code to return when the server is\n   configured to reject Reconfigure-Request
    messages.\n   Relay agents SHOULD implement appropriate means to prevent using\n
    \  Reconfigure-Request messages as a denial-of-service attack on the\n   DHCPv6
    servers.\n   Because the Reconfigure-Request message provides a mechanism for\n
    \  triggering the DHCPv6 Reconfigure message, and the DHCPv6 Reconfigure\n   message
    can raise security threats (e.g., to control the timing of a\n   DHCPv6 renewal),
    the DHCPv6 server MUST have some mechanism for\n   determining that the relay
    agent is a trusted entity.  DHCPv6 servers\n   and relay agents MUST implement
    relay message authentication as\n   described in Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].  DHCPv6
    servers MAY also\n   implement a control policy based on the content of a received
    Relay\n   Identifier Option [RFC5460].  Administrators are strongly advised to\n
    \  configure one of these security mechanisms.\n   In an environment where the
    network connecting the relay agent to the\n   DHCPv6 server is physically secure
    and does not contain devices not\n   controlled by the server administrator, it
    may be sufficient to trust\n   the Relay Agent Identifier provided by the relay
    agent.  In networks\n   where the security of the machines with access to the
    data path is\n   not under the control of the server administrator, IPsec [RFC4301]
    is\n   necessary to prevent spoofing of Reconfigure-Request messages.\n   DHCPv6
    servers MUST silently discard Reconfigure-Request messages\n   originating from
    unknown relay agents.\n"
