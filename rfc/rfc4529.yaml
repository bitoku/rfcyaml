- title: 1.  Background and Intended Use
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intended Use\n   In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) [RFC4510], the\n   search operation [RFC4511] supports requesting the\
    \ return of a set of\n   attributes.  This set is determined by a list of attribute\n\
    \   descriptions.  Two special descriptors are defined to request all\n   user\
    \ attributes (\"*\") [RFC4511] and all operational attributes (\"+\")\n   [RFC3673].\
    \  However, there is no convenient mechanism for requesting\n   pre-defined sets\
    \ of attributes such as the set of attributes used to\n   represent a particular\
    \ class of object.\n   This document extends LDAP to allow an object class identifier\
    \ to be\n   specified in attributes lists, such as in Search requests, to request\n\
    \   the return of all attributes belonging to an object class.  The\n   COMMERCIAL\
    \ AT (\"@\", U+0040) character is used to distinguish an\n   object class identifier\
    \ from an attribute descriptions.\n   For example, the attribute list of \"@country\"\
    \ is equivalent to the\n   attribute list of 'c', 'searchGuide', 'description',\
    \ and\n   'objectClass'.  This object class is described in [RFC4519].\n   This\
    \ extension is intended primarily to be used where the user is in\n   direct control\
    \ of the parameters of the LDAP search operation, for\n   instance when entering\
    \ an LDAP URL [RFC4516] into a web browser, such\n   as <ldap:///dc=example,dc=com?@organization?base>.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14\n\
    \   [RFC2119].\n   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).\n   DSE\
    \ stands for DSA-specific Entry.\n"
- title: 3.  Return of All Attributes of an Object Class
  contents:
  - "3.  Return of All Attributes of an Object Class\n   This extension allows object\
    \ class identifiers to be provided in the\n   attributes field of the LDAP SearchRequest\
    \ [RFC4511] or other request\n   values of the AttributeSelection data type (e.g.,\
    \ attributes field in\n   pre/post read controls [ReadEntry]) and/or <attributeSelector>\n\
    \   production (e.g., attributes of an LDAP URL [RFC4516]).  For each\n   object\
    \ class identified in the attributes field, the request is to be\n   treated as\
    \ if each attribute allowed by that class (by \"MUST\" or\n   \"MAY\", directly\
    \ or by \"SUP\"erior) [RFC4512] were itself listed.\n   This extension extends\
    \ the <attributeSelector> [RFC4511] production\n   as indicated by the following\
    \ ABNF [RFC4234]:\n        attributeSelector =/ objectclassdescription\n     \
    \   objectclassdescription = ATSIGN oid options\n        ATSIGN = %x40 ; COMMERCIAL\
    \ AT (\"@\" U+0040)\n   where <oid> and <options> productions are as defined in\
    \ [RFC4512].\n   The <oid> component of an <objectclassdescription> production\n\
    \   identifies the object class by short name (descr) or object\n   identifier\
    \ (numericoid).  If the value of the <oid> component is\n   unrecognized or does\
    \ not refer to an object class, the object class\n   description is to be treated\
    \ as an unrecognized attribute\n   description.\n   The <options> production is\
    \ included in the grammar for extensibility\n   purposes.  An object class description\
    \ with an unrecognized or\n   inappropriate option is to be treated as unrecognized.\n\
    \   Although object class description options and attribute description\n   options\
    \ share the same syntax, they are not semantically related.\n   This document\
    \ does not define any object description option.\n   Servers supporting this feature\
    \ SHOULD publish the object identifier\n   (OID) 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.2 as a value\
    \ of the 'supportedFeatures'\n   [RFC4512] attribute in the root DSE.  Clients\
    \ supporting this feature\n   SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they know that\
    \ the server supports\n   it.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This extension provides a shorthand for requesting\
    \ all attributes of\n   an object class.  Because these attributes could have\
    \ been listed\n   individually, introduction of this shorthand is not believed\
    \ to raise\n   additional security considerations.\n   Implementors of this LDAP\
    \ extension should be familiar with security\n   considerations applicable to\
    \ the LDAP search operation [RFC4511], as\n   well as with general LDAP security\
    \ considerations [RFC4510].\n"
