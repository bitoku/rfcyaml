  - "Abstract\n   The audio layers of the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 standards are in frequent\n\
    \   use on the internet, but there is no uniform Multipurpose Internet\n   Mail\
    \ Extension (MIME) type for these files.  The intention of this\n   document is\
    \ to define the media type audio/mpeg to refer to this kind\n   of contents.\n\

- title: 1.  MPEG audio
  contents:
  - "1.  MPEG audio\n   The audio compression defined as layer I, layer II and layer\
    \ III in\n   the MPEG-1 [MPEG-1] and MPEG-2 [MPEG-2] standards is a popular method\n\
    \   of compressing audio with a low quality loss.  The compressed audio\n   is\
    \ split into several small data frames, each containing a frame\n   header and\
    \ compressed audio data.\n   The mime type audio/mpeg defines a elementary byte\
    \ stream containing\n   MPEG frames according to [MPEG-1] and [MPEG-2], possibly\
    \ interspersed\n   with non MPEG data.  Non MPEG data is data without MPEG\n \
    \  synchronization or in other ways not possible to decompress without\n   error.\n\
    \   Typically MPEG audio meta data is concatenated with the MPEG stream,\n   e.g.,\
    \ the meta data format ID3 puts a 128 byte data block in the end\n   of the stream\
    \ while ID3v2 [ID3V2] prepends a data block of variable\n   size to the stream.\n\
    \   NOTE: MPEG audio was not designed as a file format but as a format\n   for\
    \ transmitting audio streams.  As such, it does not have any well\n   defined\
    \ way of including meta data along with audio information.\n   Some products embed\
    \ meta data using zero amplitude frames or\n   disguised as transmission errors.\
    \  Others embed the MPEG data in WAV\n   format.\n   NOTE: The audio/MPS mime\
    \ type is in use in addition to the\n   audio/mpeg.  The MPA [RFC 1890] sub-type\
    \ refers to MPEG audio when it\n   is segmented and send as a Realtime Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) payload.\n"
- title: 2.  Registration Information
  contents:
  - "2.  Registration Information\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org Subject: Registration\
    \ of MIME media type\n   audio/mpeg\n   MIME media type name: audio\n   MIME subtype\
    \ name: mpeg\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: none\n   Encoding\
    \ considerations:\n       For use over internet it is assumed that lower layers\
    \ take care\n       of transmission errors, so audio/mpeg data MAY include MPEG\n\
    \       frames generated without the optional cyclic redundancy checks\n     \
    \  (CRC) for improved audio quality.\n       The MPEG audio data is binary data,\
    \ and must be encoded for\n       non-binary transport; the Base64 encoding is\
    \ suitable for Email.\n       Note that the MPEG audio data does not compress\
    \ easily using\n       lossless compression.\n   Security considerations:\n  \
    \      MPEG is a tagged data format, and some tags are available for\n       \
    \ private use.  As such, arbitrary material could potentially\n        be transferred\
    \ in the MPEG stream, including executable content.\n        Tagged data containing\
    \ executable content SHOULD never be sent\n        and MUST not be executed if\
    \ it is received.\n                                NOTE\n            The requirement\
    \ that such content not be executed on receipt\n            is especially important\
    \ since situations exist where content\n            will be generated independently\
    \ and therefore could contain\n            executable content that the sender\
    \ is unaware of.\n        Audio/mpeg objects are not signed or encrypted internally.\n\
    \        External security mechanisms must be employed to ensure content\n   \
    \     confidentiality\n   Interoperability considerations:\n       MPEG audio\
    \ has proven to be widely interoperable across computer\n       platforms.\n \
    \  Published specification: see [MPEG-1] and [MPEG-2]\n   Applications which use\
    \ this media type:\n       MPEG audio is device-, platform- and vendor-neutral\
    \ and is\n       supported by a wide range of encoders and decoders (players).\n\
    \   Additional information:\n       Magic number(s): none\n       File extension(s):\
