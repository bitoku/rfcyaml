- title: 3.1.  General Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1.  General Overview\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional\
    \ point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre\
    \ Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols\
    \ such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n\
    \   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol),\
    \ IEEE 802.2, and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection\
    \ of multiple\n   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either\
    \ by a\n   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n\
    \   Fibre Channel \"node\" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n  \
    \ consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are\n   switches. \
    \ An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.\
    \  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single\n   port on a switch via an\
    \ \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch port\n   is called an FL_Port, and\
    \ the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n   term Nx_Port is used to refer\
    \ to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term Fx_Port is used to refer to\
    \ either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port, which is interconnected\
    \ to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.\
    \  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port\
    \ provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre Channel components,\
    \ including the Fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have globally unique names.\
    \  These globally unique names\n   are typically formatted as World Wide Names\
    \ (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected\
    \ to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre Channel frames\
    \ contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n   the frame's source and\
    \ destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address identifier and a WWN.\
    \  For an Nx_Port, its WWN is called a\n   N_Port_Name and its address identifier\
    \ is called an N_Port_ID.  When\n   a Fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers\
    \ are dynamic and are\n   assigned by a switch.  Each octet of a 24-bit address\
    \ represents a\n   level in an address hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest\n\
    \   level of the hierarchy.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Zoning
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Zoning\n   Zones within a Fabric provide a mechanism to control frame delivery\n\
    \   between Nx_Ports (\"Hard Zoning\") or to expose selected views of Name\n \
    \  Server information (\"Soft Zoning\").\n   Communication is only possible when\
    \ the communicating endpoints are\n   members of a common zone.  This technique\
    \ is similar to virtual\n   private networks in that the Fabric has the ability\
    \ to group devices\n   into Zones.\n   Hard zoning and soft zoning are two different\
    \ means of realizing\n   this.  Hard zoning is enforced in the Fabric (i.e., switches)\
    \ whereas\n   soft zoning is enforced at the endpoints (e.g., host bus adapters\n\
    \   (HBAs)) by relying on the endpoints to not send traffic to an\n   N_Port_ID\
    \ not obtained from the Name Server with a few exceptions for\n   well-known N_Port_IDs\
    \ used to bootstrap the Fabric (e.g., talk to the\n   Name Server).\n   Administrators\
    \ create Zones to increase network security and to\n   prevent data loss or corruption\
    \ by controlling access between devices\n   or user groups.  Zones may be specifically\
    \ used to create:\n      a) Barriers between devices that use different operating\
    \ systems.\n         It is often critical to separate servers and storage devices\n\
    \         with different operating systems because accidental transfer of\n  \
    \       information from one to another may delete or corrupt data;\n      b)\
    \ Logical subsets of closed user groups.  Administrators may\n         authorize\
    \ access rights to specific Zones for specific user\n         groups, thereby\
    \ protecting confidential data from unauthorized\n         access;\n      c) Groups\
    \ of devices that are separate from devices in the rest of\n         a Fabric.\
    \  Zones allow certain processes to be performed on\n         devices in a group\
    \ without interrupting devices in other\n         groups; or\n      d) Temporary\
    \ access between devices for specific purposes.\n         Administrators may remove\
    \ Zone restrictions temporarily, then\n         restore Zone restrictions to perform\
    \ normal processes.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Zoning Configuration and Management
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Zoning Configuration and Management\n   Zones are configured via a Fabric\
    \ Zone Server, using requests defined\n   in [FC-GS-5]), or via the T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB\
    \ module defined in\n   this memo, or via some other mechanism.\n   An Nx_Port\
    \ may be a member of one or more Zones.  Zone membership may\n   be specified\
    \ by:\n      a) The N_Port_Name of the Nx_Port connected to the switch;\n    \
    \  b) The N_Port_ID assigned during Fabric Login;\n      c) The Node_Name associated\
    \ with the Nx_Port; note that the\n         Node_Name may include more than one\
    \ Nx_Port;\n      d) The F_Port_Name of the Fx_Port to which the Nx_Port is\n\
    \         connected; or\n      e) The domain identifier (Domain_ID) and physical\
    \ port number of\n         the Switch Port to which the Nx_Port is attached.\n\
    \   A Fabric's Zone Server may be used to create a Zone by specifying the\n  \
    \ Zone Members.  One or more Zones may be collected into a Zone Set,\n   and a\
    \ Zone may be a member of more than one Zone Set.  A Zone Set\n   creates a collection\
    \ of Zones that may be activated or deactivated as\n   a single entity across\
    \ all Switches in a Fabric (e.g., having two\n   Zone Sets, one for normal operation,\
    \ and a second for backup during\n   off-hours).  Only one Zone Set may be activated\
    \ at one time.\n   Other terminology defined in [FC-GS-5] is:  an Active Zone\
    \ Set is the\n   Zone Set currently enforced by a Fabric; a Zone Set Database\
    \ is a\n   database of the Zone Sets available to be activated within a Fabric;\n\
    \   and a Zoning Database is a generic term used to indicate a\n   combination\
    \ of an Active Zone Set and a Zone Set Database.\n   Two distinct sets of management\
    \ requests, Enhanced and Basic, are\n   defined in [FC-GS-5] to interact with\
    \ a Fabric Zone Server.  Basic\n   Zoning provides compatibility with [FC-GS-4]\
    \ and earlier versions of\n   Fibre Channel's Generic Services specification.\
    \  If all the Switches\n   in a Fabric support the Enhanced request set, then\
    \ it may be used to\n   manage zoning; otherwise, only the Basic request set may\
    \ be used, in\n   order to support backward compatibility.\n   In the context\
    \ of Enhanced Zoning Management, a management action\n   (i.e., write access to\
    \ the Zoning Database) to the Zone Server can\n   only occur inside a server session.\
    \  A server session is set up using\n   the FC-GS-5's Common Transport (CT) protocol\
    \ defined in [FC-GS-5].  A\n   server session is delimited by CT protocol requests,\
    \ Server Session\n   Begin (SSB) and Server Session End (SSE), which are directed\
    \ to the\n   Management Service and which have the GS_Subtype specifying the Zone\n\
    \   Server.  Query requests that result in read access to the Zoning\n   Database\
    \ are not required to be issued inside a server session,\n   although the information\
    \ returned is not guaranteed to be consistent\n   when supplied outside of a server\
    \ session.\n   When setting up a server session for Enhanced Zoning, the Zone\
    \ Server\n   is required to lock the Fabric.  This ensures serialized management\n\
    \   access to the Zoning Database and guarantees a deterministic\n   behavior.\
    \  The switch that receives the SSB request is called the\n   'managing' switch,\
    \ and it tries to lock the Fabric using the Fabric\n   Management Session Protocol\
    \ (see section 10.6 of [FC-SW-4]) by\n   sending an Acquire Change Authorization\
    \ (ACA) request to all other\n   switches in the Fabric.  If any switch(es) respond\
    \ with an SW_RJT\n   indicating failure, then the attempt to lock the Fabric fails\
    \ and the\n   SSB request is rejected.  If all the other switches respond with\
    \ an\n   SW_ACC indicating success, then the Fabric is locked and the server\n\
    \   session can be established.  The subsequent SSE request causes a\n   Release\
    \ Change Authorization (RCA) request to all other switches, and\n   thus, the\
    \ Fabric to be unlocked.\n   For at least one application other than Zoning, the\
    \ managing switch\n   uses a different type of request to lock the Fabric, i.e.,\
    \ it sends\n   an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA) request to all\
    \ other\n   switches in the Fabric.  An EACA reserves local resources associated\n\
    \   with a designated application to ensure the consistency of that\n   application's\
    \ data.  The application is identified in the EACA using\n   an Application_ID\
    \ (see Table 116 in [FC-SW-4]).  A lock that was\n   established via an EACA is\
    \ released using an Enhanced Release Change\n   Authorization (ERCA) request.\n\
    \   Changes requested in a Zoning Database by Enhanced Zoning commands\n   persist\
    \ after the end of the Zoning (server) session only if the\n   commands are followed,\
    \ within the same server session, by a Commit\n   Zone Changes (CMIT) request.\
    \  On receipt of a CMIT request, the Zone\n   Server checks that the Zoning Database\
    \ as modified by the outstanding\n   changes will pass the applicable consistency\
    \ checks, and then\n   distributes it to all other switches in the Fabric using\
    \ a Stage\n   Fabric Configuration Update (SFC) request.  If all other switches\n\
    \   accept the SFC request, then the \"managing\" switch sends an Update\n   Fabric\
    \ Configuration (UFC) Request to each other switch, and the\n   staged Zoning\
    \ Database thereby becomes the Fabric's (active) Zoning\n   Database.\n   The\
    \ latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple\n   Fabric\
    \ Switch elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the\n   earlier specification\
    \ for the operation of a single Fabric in a\n   physical infrastructure, and augments\
    \ it with the definition of\n   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of\
    \ how multiple Virtual\n   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.\n\
    \   The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in\n   its\
    \ header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that\n   frame is being\
    \ transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular\n   \"Core Switch\" [FC-SW-4]\
    \ (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual\n   Fabric are processed by the\
    \ same \"Virtual Switch\" within that Core\n   switch.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance\
    \ is defined in [RFC4044] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel\
    \ functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel\
    \ management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).\
    \  For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having\
    \ multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a\
    \ different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,\
    \ is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely\
    \ identify each Fibre Channel\n   management instance, for example, within the\
    \ same SNMP context\n   ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).\n"
- title: 5.2.  Switch Index

- title: 5.3.  Fabric Index
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without\
    \ Virtual\n   Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of a Zone Server\n\
    \   within a Fabric is identical.  Therefore, this MIB defines all\n   Fabric-related\
    \ information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary\n   integer, named a\
    \ \"Fabric Index\", having the syntax, T11FabricIndex,\n   which is IMPORTed from\
    \ the T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439].  When a device is\n   connected to a single physical\
    \ Fabric, without use of any Virtual\n   Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index\
    \ will always be 1.  In an\n   environment of multiple virtual and/or physical\
    \ Fabrics, this index\n   provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.\n\
    \   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel\n   switch\
    \ will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical\n   Fabrics. \
    \ Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query\n   concerning all the\
    \ Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,\n   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed\

- title: 5.4.  Locking the Fabric
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Locking the Fabric\n   The T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB module provides for the\
    \ management of\n   locks on a Fibre Channel Fabric.  A Fibre Channel Fabric lock\
    \ is used\n   to ensure serialized access to some types of management data related\n\
    \   to a Fabric, e.g., the Fabric's Zoning Database.\n   Some (managing) applications\
    \ obtain a lock by initiating server\n   sessions and the Fabric is locked so\
    \ as to reserve local resources in\n   each Switch.  For this usage, the managing\
    \ switch sends an Acquire\n   Change Authorization (ACA) request to other switches\
    \ in order to lock\n   the Fabric.\n   For some other applications, a managing\
    \ switch locks the Fabric using\n   an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA)\
    \ request, which\n   identifies the application on whose behalf the Fabric is\
    \ being locked\n   with an Application_ID.  In this case, only local resources\n\
    \   associated with the designated application are reserved.\n   Locks established\
    \ via ACAs and via EACAs are both represented in the\n   t11FLockTable in the\
    \ T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB.  The Application_ID\n   provided by the EACA serves\
    \ to distinguish between multiple\n   concurrent locks established by EACAs. \
    \ In order to use this same\n   mechanism to distinguish a lock established via\
    \ an ACA from each of\n   those established via EACAs, an additional (special)\
    \ value of\n   Application_ID has been assigned [APPL-ID] for use by this MIB\n\
    \   module.  Specifically, this newly assigned value will never be used\n   to\
    \ indicate an Application locked by an EACA, and therefore this MIB\n   module\
    \ uses it to uniquely distinguish a lock established via an ACA.\n   In other\
    \ words, with this additional assignment, an Application_ID\n   value can be used\
    \ to uniquely identify any active lock amongst all\n   those established (on the\
    \ same Fabric) either by an EACA or an ACA.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Basic and Enhanced Modes
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Basic and Enhanced Modes\n   The t11ZsServerOperationMode object indicates\
    \ whether a Fabric's Zone\n   Server is operating in Basic mode or Enhanced mode.\
    \  These two modes\n   have a sufficient amount of commonality to make it worthwhile\
    \ to have\n   one set of MIB objects that are used for the subset of functionality\n\
    \   that is common to both modes.  To accommodate the differences,\n   additional\
    \ MIB objects are defined.\n   For Enhanced mode, the additional objects are defined\
    \ in a group,\n   t11ZsEnhancedModeGroup, which is only required to be implemented\
    \ in a\n   Zone Server capable of supporting Enhanced mode.  The objects\n   specific\
    \ to Basic mode are always (even in Enhanced mode) expected to\n   be implemented,\
    \ but when in Enhanced mode, their values are either\n   restricted or do not\
    \ affect current operations, e.g.,\n    - an example of \"restricted\" is:  the\
    \ distribution of updates to the\n      Zone Server database throughout the Fabric\
    \ has to be requested\n      explicitly in Basic mode; this functionality is provided\
    \ in the\n      MIB by the t11ZsServerDistribute object.  In contrast, in Enhanced\n\
    \      mode, the distribution is an implicit part of the commit function\n   \
    \   which is initiated using the t11ZsServerCommit object.  Thus, when\n     \
    \ operating in Enhanced mode, t11ZsServerDistribute has a fixed\n      value,\
    \ and when operating in Basic mode, t11ZsServerCommit has a\n      fixed value.\n\
    \    - an example of \"do not affect current operations\" is:\n      t11ZsServerHardZoning,\
    \ which specifies whether a switch enforces\n      hard Zoning on a Fabric when\
    \ in Basic mode.  This object is\n      instantiated and could even be modified\
    \ while in Enhanced mode,\n      but its value only takes effect when in Basic\
    \ mode.  (Note that in\n      Enhanced mode, t11ZsActiveZoneHardZoning specifies\
    \ whether hard\n      Zoning is enabled on a particular Zone.)\n"

  contents:
  - "5.8.5.1.  Flow-Control for Notifications\n   When defining SNMP notifications\
    \ for events that occur in the data-\n   plane, the maximum frequency of their\
    \ generation needs to be\n   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor,\
    \ such notifications\n   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined\
    \ such that after\n   some maximum number have occurred within a specified time\
    \ interval,\n   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time\n\
    \   interval.  However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the\n   Network\
    \ Management System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications\n   (because they\
    \ were suppressed) needs an indication of how many were\n   suppressed.  Therefore,\
    \ an additional Counter32 object needs to be\n   defined, and/or a new type of\
    \ notification needs to be defined for\n   use at the end of the interval.  While\
    \ this is extra complexity, it\n   is necessary for notifications that need to\
    \ be flow-controlled.\n   In contrast, for notifications such as all those defined\
    \ in this MIB\n   module, which are generated due to control-plane events (and\
    \ are not\n   able to start a chain reaction):\n   - estimating the maximum number\
    \ that could be generated per unit time\n     for each type of notification is\
    \ too simplistic.  For example, it's\n     unreasonable to ask how many of the\
    \ t11ZsDefZoneChangeNotify\n     notifications can be generated in a time interval\
    \ because it\n     depends on several factors: how many operators can be re-\n\
    \     configuring the network at the same time? and how frequently can\n     each\
    \ of them change the Default Zone Setting?\n   - the extra complexity of flow-controlling\
    \ these types of\n     notifications is not warranted.\n"

    The MIB module for the management of locks on a Fibre\n           Channel Fabric.\
    \  A Fibre Channel Fabric lock is used to\n           ensure serialized access\
    \ to some types of management data\n           related to a Fabric, e.g., the\
    \ Fabric's Zoning Database.\n           Some (managing) applications generate\
    \ Fabric locks by\n           initiating server sessions.  Server sessions are\n\
    \           defined generically in FC-GS-5 to represent a collection of\n    \
    \       one or more requests to the session's server, e.g., to the\n         \
    \  Zone Server.  Such a session is started by a Server Session\n           Begin\
    \ (SSB) request, and terminated by a Server Session End\n           (SSE) request.\
    \  The switch receiving the SSB is called the\n           'managing' switch. \
    \ Some applications require the\n           'managing' switch to lock the Fabric\
    \ for the particular\n           application, e.g., for Enhanced Zoning, before\
    \ it can\n           respond successfully to the SSB.  On receipt of the\n   \
    \        subsequent SSE, the lock is released.  For this usage, the\n        \
    \   managing switch sends an Acquire Change Authorization (ACA)\n           request\
    \ to other switches to lock the Fabric.\n           For some other applications,\
    \ a managing switch locks the\n           Fabric using an Enhanced Acquire Change\
    \ Authorization (EACA)\n           request, which identifies the application on\
    \ whose behalf\n           the Fabric is being locked with an Application_ID.\n\
    \           Fabric locks can also be requested more directly, e.g.,\n        \
    \   through the use of this MIB.  In these situations, the term\n           'managing'\
    \ switch is used to indicate the switch that\n           receives such a request\
    \ and executes it by issuing either\n           ACA or EACA requests to other\
    \ switches in the Fabric.\n           This MIB module defines information about\
    \ the 'managing'\n           switch for currently-active Fabric locks.\n     \

    \ specific to a current\n           Fabric lock set up by a particular 'managing'\
    \ switch on a\n           particular Fabric.  The 'managing switch' is identified\

    \ sessions for several different types of servers\n           are defined in FC-GS-5.\
    \  The behavior of a server with\n           respect to commands received within\
    \ a server session is\n           specified for each type of server.  For some\
    \ types,\n           parameter changes can only be made within the context of\
    \ a\n           session, and the setting up of a session requires that the\n \
    \          Fabric be locked.  A Fabric is locked by one switch, called\n     \
    \      the 'managing' switch, sending Acquire Change Authorization\n         \
    \  (ACA) requests to all other switches in the Fabric.\n           For other applications,\
    \ a Fabric lock is established by the\n           'managing' switch sending Enhanced\
    \ Acquire Change\n           Authorization (EACA) requests to other switches in\
    \ the\n           Fabric.  Each EACA request includes an Application_ID\n    \
    \       value to identify the application requesting the lock.\n           For\
    \ the benefit of this MIB module, a distinct value of\n           Application_ID\
    \ has also been assigned/reserved (see\n           ANSI INCITS T11/06-679v0, titled\
    \ 'FC-SW-5 Letter to\n           T11.5') as a means of distinguishing locks established\
    \ via\n           Acquire Change Authorization (ACA) requests.  This\n       \
    \    additional assignment allows an Application_ID to be used to\n          \
    \ uniquely identify any active lock amongst all those\n           established\
    \ by either an EACA or an ACA.\n           Whenever a Fabric is locked, by the\
    \ sending of either an ACA\n           or an EACA, a row gets created in the representation\
    \ of this\n           table for the 'managing' switch.\n           In order to\
    \ process SNMP SetRequests that make parameter\n           changes for the relevant\
    \ types of servers (e.g., to the\n           Zoning Database), the SNMP agent\
    \ must get serialized access\n           to the Fabric (for the relevant type\
    \ of management data),\n           i.e., the Fabric must be locked by creating\
    \ an entry in\n           this table via an SNMP SetRequest.  Creating an entry\
    \ in\n           this table via an SNMP SetRequest causes an ACA or an EACA\n\
    \           to be sent to all other switches in the Fabric.  The value\n     \
    \      of t11FLockApplicationID for such an entry determines\n           whether\
    \ an ACA or an EACA is sent.\n           If an entry in this table is created\
    \ by an SNMP SetRequest,\n           the value of the t11FLockInitiatorType object\
    \ in that entry\n           will normally be 'snmp'.  A row for which the value\
    \ of\n           t11FLockInitiatorType is not 'snmp' cannot be modified\n    \
    \       via SNMP.  In particular, it cannot be deleted via\n           t11FLockRowStatus.\
    \  Note that it's possible for a row to be\n           created by an SNMP SetRequest,\
    \ but for the setup of the lock\n           to fail, and immediately thereafter\
    \ be replaced by a lock\n           successfully set up by some other means; in\
    \ such a case, the\n           value of t11FLockInitiatorType would change as\
    \ and when the\n           lock was set up by the other means, and so the row\
    \ could\n           not thereafter be deleted via t11FLockRowStatus.\n       \
    \    FC-GS-5 mentions various error situations in which a\n           Fabric lock\
    \ is released so as to avoid a deadlock.  In\n           such situations, the\
    \ agent removes the corresponding row\n           in this table as and when the\

    \ as defined in the FC-GS-5 specification.\n           FC-GS-5 defines (in-band)\
    \ management operations for\n           manipulating the Zone Set Database, some\
    \ for use in Basic\n           mode (e.g., 'Add Zone Set (AZS)', etc.), and some\
    \ for use in\n           Enhanced mode (e.g., Create Zone Set (CZS)', etc.). \
    \ When\n           Enhanced Zoning Management is in use, FC-GS-5 requires that\n\
    \           these in-band management operations be rejected unless they\n    \
    \       are issued within the context of a GS-5 server session.  The\n       \
    \    use of a server session ensures serialized access to the\n           Zoning\
    \ Database since the Fabric lock for the Zone Server\n           must be obtained\
    \ as a part of establishing the server\n           session to the Zone Server.\n\
    \           Thus, if and when this MIB is used for Enhanced Zoning\n         \
    \  Management, SNMP SetRequests that request the modification\n           of zoning\
    \ definitions must be serialized with respect to\n           the GS-5 requests\
    \ to modify the Zoning Database.  This is\n           achieved by requiring that\
    \ an SNMP management application\n           must first obtain the Fabric lock\
    \ for the Zone Server\n           before attempting to modify any zoning definitions.\
    \  The\n           companion T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB module is defined as a means\n\
    \           of obtaining the Fabric lock for the Zone Server (or any\n       \
    \    other server).\n           In Enhanced Zoning Management, a Zone Server keeps\
    \ track of\n           changes requested in the zoning definitions, but does not\n\
    \           update its Zone Set Database unless there is (and until\n        \
    \   there is) a 'commit' operation.  To model this behavior,\n           this\
    \ MIB module assumes that a Zone Server (in Enhanced\n           mode) takes a\
    \ snapshot of its Zone Set Database as and when\n           the Fabric lock (for\
    \ the Zone Server application) is\n           obtained; this snapshot is used\
    \ to create what is herein\n           called the 'copy' database.  It is this\
    \ 'copy' database\n           that is then updated by SNMP SetRequests (while\
    \ the Fabric\n           is locked).  If and when a 'commit' operation is requested\n\
    \           (while the Fabric is still locked), the 'copy' database is\n     \
    \      then used to overwrite the previously committed contents of\n         \
    \  the Zone Set Database, and the new Zone Set Database is\n           distributed\
    \ to all other switches in the Fabric.  When the\n           lock is released,\
    \ any changes made that were not\n           'committed' are discarded.\n    \
    \       When this MIB is used for Basic Zoning Management, the same\n        \
    \   set of MIB objects as used for Enhanced mode are used to\n           make\
    \ changes to the Database of a Zone Server on a\n           particular switch,\
    \ but the changes take immediate effect at\n           that switch without an\
    \ explicit commit.  The distribution of\n           those changes to Zone Servers\
    \ on other switches in the\n           Fabric is subsequently requested through\
    \ the use of a\n           separate set of MIB objects.\n           The management\
    \ information specified in this MIB module\n           includes the Zoning Database\
    \ for each of one or more Fibre\n           Channel Fabrics.  A Zoning Database\
    \ is a combination of the\n           Fabric's Zone Set Database and its Active\
    \ Zone Set.  The\n           Active Zone Set is the Zone Set currently enforced\
    \ by the\n           Fabric; a Zone Set Database is a database of the Zone Sets\n\
    \           available to be activated within a Fabric.  All the MIB\n        \
    \   objects representing a Zone Set Database are modifiable at\n           any\
    \ time (irrespective of the value of any RowStatus\n           object), whereas\
    \ all objects representing the Active Zone\n           Set are always read-only\
    \ (except to deactivate it and/or\n           activate a different one).\n   \

    \   module (159) and one for the T11-FC-ZONE-SERVER-MIB module (160),\n   under\
    \ the mib-2 subtree.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are many management objects defined in\
    \ these MIB modules with a\n   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such objects may\n   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\
    \ environments.\n   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment\
    \ without\n   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\n\
    \   Specifically, unauthorized write access to *any* of the writable\n   objects\
    \ in these MIB modules could cause unauthorized manipulation of\n   the Zoning\
    \ information on a Zone Server, and/or the activation of an\n   unauthorized Active\
    \ Zone Set in a Fabric.  This could result in\n   allowing unauthorized connectivity,\
    \ and/or denying authorized\n   connectivity, between hosts connected to the Fibre\
    \ Channel network.\n   It could also cause the suppression of notifications (e.g.,\
    \ of\n   unauthorized operations), or the disruption of network operations due\n\
    \   to the generation of unwanted notifications.\n   Some of the readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.\n   Unauthorized read access to any of the\
    \ readable objects in the\n   t11ZsServerTable, t11ZsActiveZoneTable, t11ZsActiveZoneMemberTable,\n\
    \   or t11ZsActiveAttribTable tables would reveal information about the\n   currently\
    \ authorized connectivity between hosts connected to the\n   Fibre Channel network.\n\
    \   Unauthorized read access to any of the readable objects in the\n   t11ZsSetTable,\
    \ t11ZsZoneTable, t11ZsSetZoneTable, t11ZsAliasTable,\n   t11ZsZoneMemberTable,\
    \ t11ZsAttribBlockTable, or t11ZsAttribTable\n   tables would reveal information\
    \ about potential/alternative\n   connectivity that could be authorized between\
    \ hosts connected to the\n   Fibre Channel network.\n   SNMP versions prior to\
    \ SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is\
    \ secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to\
    \ who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
