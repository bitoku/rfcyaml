    \   MIB object groups for IPv6.  Specifically, the ICMPv6 group is\n   defined\
    \ in this document.\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the IPv6-based\n\
    \   internets.\n   This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both\n\
    \   compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer\n   SNMPv1\
    \ definitions.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework presently consists of three\n   major components.  They are:\n   o\
    \ the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for\n     describing\
    \ and naming objects for the purpose of management.\n   o the MIB-II, described\
    \ in RFC 1213/STD 17 [3] - the core set of\n     managed objects for the Internet\
    \ suite of protocols.\n   o RFC 1157/STD 15 [4] and RFC 1905 [5] which define\
    \ two versions of the\n     protocol used for network access to managed objects.\n\
    \   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation\
    \ and evaluation.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object type\n   together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we often\n   use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the object\n   type.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   This document is the one in the series of documents that define\n\
    \   various MIB object groups for IPv6. These groups are the basic unit of\n \
    \  conformance: if the semantics of a group is applicable to an\n   implementation,\
    \ then it must implement all objects in that group.  For\n   example, an implementation\
    \ must implement the TCP group if and only if\n   it implements the TCP over IPv6\
    \ protocol.  At minimum, implementations\n   must implement the IPv6 General group\
    \ [9] as well as the ICMPv6 group\n   defined in this document.\n   This document\
    \ defines the ICMPv6 group of the IPv6 MIB.\n"
