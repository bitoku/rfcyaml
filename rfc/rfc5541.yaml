    \  Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks is subject to a set of one or more\n   specific optimization
    criteria, referred to as objective functions\n   (e.g., minimum cost path, widest
    path, etc.).\n   In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path\n
    \  Computation Client (PCC) may want a path to be computed for one or\n   more
    TE LSPs according to a specific objective function.  Thus, the\n   PCC needs to
    instruct the PCE to use the correct objective function.\n   Furthermore, it is
    possible that not all PCEs support the same set of\n   objective functions; therefore,
    it is useful for the PCC to be able\n   to automatically discover the set of objective
    functions supported by\n   each PCE.\n   This document defines extensions to the
    PCE communication Protocol\n   (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate the set of objective
    functions it\n   supports.  Extensions are also defined so that a PCC can indicate
    in\n   a path computation request the required objective function, and a PCE\n
    \  can report in a path computation reply the objective function that\n   was
    used for path computation.\n   This document defines objective function code types
    for six objective\n   functions previously listed in the PCE requirements work,
    and\n   provides the definition of four new metric types that apply to a set\n
    \  of synchronized requests.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element-based network architecture
    [RFC4655]\n   defines a Path Computation Element (PCE) as an entity capable of\n
    \  computing the paths of Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE\n   LSPs)
    based on a network graph and of applying computational\n   constraints.  A PCE
    services path computation requests that are sent\n   by Path Computation Clients
    (PCC).\n   The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP), defined in [RFC5440], allows\n
    \  for communication between a PCC and a PCE or between two PCEs, in\n   compliance
    with requirements and guidelines set forth in [RFC4657].\n   Such interactions
    include path computation requests and path\n   computation replies.\n   The computation
    of one or a set of TE LSPs is subject to a set of one\n   or more optimization
    criteria, called an objective function.  An\n   objective function is used by
    the PCE when it computes a path or a\n   set of paths in order to select the \"best\"
    candidate paths.  There is\n   a variety of objective functions: an objective
    function could apply\n   either to a set of non-synchronized path computation
    requests, or to\n   a set of synchronized path computation requests.  In the former
    case,\n   the objective function refers to an individual path computation\n   request
    (e.g., computation of the shortest constrained path where the\n   metric is the
    IGP metric, computation of the least loaded constrained\n   path, etc.).  Conversely,
    in the latter case, the objective function\n   refers to a set of path computation
    requests the computation of which\n   is synchronized (e.g., minimize the aggregate
    bandwidth consumption\n   of all LSPs, minimize the sum of the delays for two
    diverse paths or\n   of the delta between those delays, etc.).  Moreover, some
    objective\n   functions relate to the optimization of a single metric and others
    to\n   the optimization of a set of metrics (organized in a hierarchical\n   manner,
    using a weighted function, etc.).\n   As spelled out in [RFC4674], it may be useful
    for a PCC to discover\n   the set of objective functions supported by a PCE.  Furthermore,\n
    \  [RFC4657] requires the ability for a PCC to indicate in a path\n   computation
    request a required/desired objective function, as well as\n   optional function
    parameters.\n   For these purposes, this document extends the PCE communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP).  It defines PCEP extensions that allow a PCE to\n   advertise
    a list of supported objective functions, as well as\n   extensions to carry the
    objective function in PCEP request and reply\n   messages.  It complements the
    PCEP base specification [RFC5440].\n   Note that OSPF- and IS-IS-based PCE discovery
    mechanisms are defined\n   in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].  These mechanisms are dedicated
    to the\n   discovery of a few generic parameters, while more detailed PCE\n   parameters
    should be discovered using the PCE communication Protocol.\n   Objective functions
    are in this second category; thus, the objective\n   function discovery procedure
    is handled by PCEP.\n   A new PCEP TLV, named the OF-List TLV, is defined in Section
    2.  The\n   OF-List TLV is carried in the PCEP OPEN object and allows a PCE to\n
    \  list, during PCEP session-setup phase, the objective functions that\n   it
    supports.\n   A new PCEP object, the OF object, is defined in Section 3.  The
    OF\n   object is carried within a PCReq (Path Computation Request) message\n   to
    indicate the required/desired objective function to be applied by\n   a PCE, or
    in a PCRep (Path Computation Reply) message to indicate the\n   objective function
    that was used for path computation.\n   Six mandatory objective functions that
    must be supported by PCEP are\n   listed in [RFC4657].  This document provides
    a definition of these\n   six mandatory objective functions.  Additional objective
    functions\n   may be defined in other documents.  Note that additional objective\n
    \  functions are defined for the PCE Global Concurrent Optimization\n   (GCO)
    application, in [PCE-GCO].\n   This document also provides the definition of four
    new metric types\n   that apply to a set of synchronized requests.\n"

        \  [RFC5440] specifies a bit flag, referred to as the P bit, carried in\n

    - "3.3.  New RP Object Flag\n   In some cases, where no objective function is
      specified in the\n   request or an optional objective function is desired (P
      flag cleared\n   in the OF object common header) but the PCE does not follow
      the\n   request, the PCC may desire to know the objective function that was\n
      \  used by the PCE during path computation.  To that end, a new flag is\n   defined
      in the RP object, named the OF flag, allowing a PCC to\n   request for the inclusion
      in the path computation reply of the\n   objective function that was used by
      the PCE during path computation.\n   The following new bit flag of the RP object
      is defined:\n   The Supply OF on response flag (bit number 24).  When set in
      a PCReq\n   message, this indicates that the PCE MUST provide the applied\n
      \  objective function (should a path satisfying the constraints be\n   found)
      in the PCRep message.  When set in a PCRep message, this\n   indicates that
      the objective function that was used during path\n   computation is included.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.3.1.  Elements Of Procedure\n   If the PCC wants to know the objective
        function used by the PCE\n   during path computation for a given request,
        it sets the OF flag in\n   the RP object.\n   On receipt of a PCReq message
        with the OF flag in the RP object set,\n   the PCE proceeds as follows:\n
        \  - If policy permits, it MUST include in the PCRep message an OF\n     object
        indicating the objective function it used during path\n     computation.\n
        \  - If policy does not permit, it MUST send a PCErr message with the\n     PCEP
        error code \"policy-violation\" (type 5) and a new error value,\n     \"objective
        function indication not allowed\", which is defined in\n     this document.\n
        \  Note that a legacy PCE might not recognize the OF flag in the RP\n   object.
        \ According to the definition of the Flags field for the RP\n   object (Section
        7.4.1 of [RFC5440]), the legacy PCE will ignore the\n   unknown flag, resulting
        in it sending a PCRep that does not contain\n   an OF object.  In this case,
        the PCC's behavior is an implementation\n   choice.  The PCC might:\n   -
        Discard the PCRep because it really wanted the OF object returned.\n   - Accept
        the PCRep without the knowledge of the OF that was applied.\n   Note also
        that these procedures can give rise to the situation where\n   a PCC receives
        a PCRep that contains an OF object with an objective\n   function identifier
        that the PCC does not recognize.  In this\n   situation, the PCC behavior
        is dependent on implementation and\n   configuration.  The PCC could choose
        any of the following (or some\n   other action):\n   - Ignore the OF object
        and use the computed path.\n   - Add the objective function to its view of
        the PCE's repertoire for\n     inclusion in future computation requests.\n
        \  - Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send a PCReq to\n     another
        PCE.\n   - Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send another PCReq\n
        \    to the same PCE explicitly requiring the use of some other\n     objective
        function (i.e., by setting the P bit in the OF object).\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Objective Functions Definition\n   Six objective functions that must be supported
    by PCEP are listed in\n   [RFC4657].  Objective function codes have been assigned
    by IANA and\n   are described below.\n   Objective functions are formulated using
    the following terminology:\n   - A network comprises a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.\n
    \  - A path P is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.\n   - Metric of link L is
    denoted M(L).  This can be the IGP metric, the\n     TE metric, or any other metric.\n
    \  - The cost of a path P is denoted C(P), where C(P) = sum {M(Lpi),\n     (i=1...K)}.\n
    \  - Residual bandwidth on link L is denoted r(L).\n   - Maximum reservable bandwidth
    on link L is denoted R(L).\n   There are three objective functions that apply
    to the computation of\n   a single path:\n   Objective Function Code: 1\n   Name:
    Minimum Cost Path (MCP)\n   Description: Find a path P such that C(P) is minimized.\n
    \  Objective Function Code: 2\n   Name: Minimum Load Path (MLP)\n   Description:
    Find a path P such that\n           ( Max {(R(Lpi) - r(Lpi)) / R(Lpi), i=1...K
    } ) is minimized.\n   Objective Function Code: 3\n   Name: Maximum residual Bandwidth
    Path (MBP)\n   Description: Find a path P such that\n             ( Min { r(Lpi),
    i=1...K } ) is maximized.\n   There are three objective functions that apply to
    a set of path\n   computation requests the computation of which is synchronized:\n
    \  Objective Function Code: 4\n   Name: Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption
    (MBC)\n   Description: Find a set of paths such that\n             ( Sum {R(Li)
    - r(Li), i=1...N} ) is minimized.\n   Objective Function Code: 5\n   Name: Minimize
    the Load of the most loaded Link (MLL)\n   Description: Find a set of paths such
    that\n             ( Max { (R(Li) - r(Li)) / R(Li), i=1...N}) is minimized.\n
    \  Objective Function Code: 6\n   Name: Minimize the Cumulative Cost of a set
    of paths (MCC)\n   Description: Find a set of paths {P1...Pm} such that\n             (Sum
    { C(Pi), i=1...m}) is minimized.\n   Other objective functions may be defined
    in separate documents.\n"

    \  to a set of synchronized requests:\n      Type 4: Aggregate bandwidth consumption.\n
    \     Type 5: Load of the most loaded link.\n      Type 6: Cumulative IGP cost.\n
    \     Type 7: Cumulative TE cost.\n   These metrics may be used in a PCReq to
    indicate a bound (B bit set\n   in the METRIC object) or to request the computation
    of a metric (C\n   bit set in the METRIC object), or in a PCRep to indicate a
