    \   that are connected to the same link as the client) to provide the\n   client's\
    \ link-layer address in the DHCPv6 messages being sent towards\n   the server.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Background and Scenario
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Background and Scenario\n   The DHCPv4 specification [RFC2131] provides\
    \ a way to specify the\n   client link-layer address in the DHCPv4 message header.\
    \  A DHCPv4\n   message header has 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify the\
    \ client\n   link-layer address type and the link-layer address, respectively.\n\
    \   The client link-layer address thus learned can be used by the DHCPv4\n   server\
    \ and the relay agent in different ways.  In some of the\n   deployments, DHCPv4\
    \ servers use 'chaddr' as a customer identifier and\n   a key for lookup in the\
    \ client lease database.\n   With the incremental deployment of IPv6 to existing\
    \ IPv4 networks,\n   which results in a dual-stack network environment, there\
    \ will be\n   devices that act as both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients.  In service\n\
    \   provider deployments, a typical DHCPv4 implementation will use the\n   client\
    \ link-layer address as one of the keys to build the DHCP client\n   lease database.\
    \  In dual-stack scenarios, operators need to be able\n   to associate DHCPv4\
    \ and DHCPv6 messages with the same client\n   interface, based on an identifier\
    \ that is common to the interface.\n   The client link-layer address is such an\
    \ identifier.\n   Currently, the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] does not define\
    \ a way\n   to communicate the client link-layer address to the DHCP server in\n\
    \   cases where the DHCP server is not connected to the same network link\n  \
    \ as the DHCP client.  The DHCPv6 specification mandates that all\n   clients\
    \ prepare and send a DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) as the\n   client identifier\
    \ option in all the DHCPv6 message exchanges.\n   However, none of these methods\
    \ provide a simple way to extract a\n   client's link-layer address.  This presents\
    \ a problem to an operator\n   who is using an existing DHCPv4 system with the\
    \ client link-layer\n   address as the customer identifier and who desires to\
    \ correlate\n   DHCPv6 assignments using the same identifier.  [RFC4361] describes\
    \ a\n   mechanism for using the same DUID in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ this specification requires modification of existing\n   DHCPv4 clients, and\
    \ has not seen broad adoption in the industry\n   (indeed, we are not aware of\
    \ any commercial implementations).\n   Providing an option in DHCPv6 Relay-Forward\
    \ messages to carry the\n   client link-layer address explicitly will help the\
    \ above mentioned\n   scenarios.  For example, it can be used along with other\
    \ identifiers\n   to associate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages from a dual-stack client.\n\
    \   Further, having the client link-layer address in DHCPv6 will help by\n   providing\
    \ additional information for event debugging and logging\n   related to the client\
    \ at the relay agent and the server.  The\n   proposed option may be used in a\
    \ wide range of networks; two notable\n   deployment models are service provider\
    \ and enterprise network\n   environments.\n"

- title: 5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior\n   DHCPv6 relay agents that receive messages\
    \ originating from clients\n   (for example, Solicit and Request, but not, for\
    \ example,\n   Relay-Forward or Advertise) MAY include the link-layer source address\n\
    \   of the received DHCPv6 message in the Client Link-Layer Address\n   option,\
    \ in relayed DHCPv6 Relay-Forward messages.  The DHCPv6 relay\n   agent behavior\
    \ can depend on configuration that decides whether the\n   Client Link-Layer Address\
    \ option needs to be included.\n"
- title: 6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   If the DHCPv6 server is configured to store or\
    \ use a client link-\n   layer address, it SHOULD look for the Client Link-Layer\
    \ Address\n   option in the Relay-Forward DHCP message of the DHCPv6 relay agent\n\
    \   closest to the client.  The mechanism described in this document is\n   not\
    \ necessary in the case where the DHCPv6 server is connected to the\n   same network\
    \ link as the client, because the server can obtain the\n   link-layer address\
    \ from the link-layer header of the DHCPv6 message.\n   If the DHCP server receives\
    \ a Client Link-Layer Address option\n   anywhere in any encapsulated message\
    \ that is not a Relay-Forward DHCP\n   message, the server MUST silently ignore\
    \ that option.\n   There is no requirement that a server return this option and\
    \ its data\n   in a downstream DHCP message.\n"
- title: 7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior
  contents:
  - "7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior\n   The Client Link-Layer Address option is only exchanged\
    \ between the\n   relay agents and the servers.  DHCPv6 clients are not aware\
    \ of the\n   usage of the Client Link-Layer Address option.  The DHCPv6 client\n\
    \   MUST NOT send the Client Link-Layer Address option, and MUST ignore\n   the\
    \ Client Link-Layer Address option if received.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned an option code (79) to OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR\n\
    \   from the \"DHCP Option Codes\" registry\n   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/).\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   It is possible for a rogue DHCPv6 relay agent\
    \ to insert an incorrect\n   Client Link-Layer Address option for malicious purposes.\
    \  A DHCPv6\n   client can also pose as a rogue DHCP relay agent by sending a\n\
    \   Relay-Forward message containing an incorrect Client Link-Layer\n   Address\
    \ option.  In either case, it would be possible for a DHCPv6\n   client to masquerade\
    \ as the same device as a DHCPv4 client, when in\n   fact the two are distinct.\n\
    \   One possible attack that could be accomplished using this masquerade\n   would\
    \ be in the case where a DHCPv4 client is using DHCPv4 to do a\n   Dynamic DNS\
    \ update to install an A record so that it can be reached\n   by other nodes [RFC4702].\
    \  A masquerading DHCPv6 client could use\n   DHCPv6 to install a AAAA record\
    \ with the same name [RFC4704].  Dual-\n   stack nodes attempting to connect to\
    \ the DHCPv4 client might then be\n   tricked into connecting to the masquerading\
    \ DHCPv6 client instead.\n   It is possible that there are other attacks that\
    \ could be\n   accomplished using this masquerading technique, although the authors\n\
    \   are not aware of any.  To prevent masquerades of this sort, DHCP\n   server\
    \ administrators are strongly advised to configure DHCP servers\n   that use this\
    \ option to communicate with their relay agents using\n   IPsec, as described\
    \ in Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].\n   In some networks, it may be the case that\
    \ the operator of the\n   physical network and the provider of connectivity over\
    \ that network\n   are administratively separate, such that the Client Link-Layer\n\
    \   Address option would reveal information to one or the other party\n   that\
    \ they do not need and could not otherwise obtain.  It is also\n   possible, in\
    \ some cases, that a relay agent might communicate with a\n   DHCP server over\
    \ an open network where eavesdropping would be\n   possible.  In these cases,\
    \ it is strongly recommended, in order to\n   protect end-user privacy, that network\
    \ operators use IPsec to provide\n   confidentiality for messages between the\
    \ relay agent and the DHCP\n   server.\n"
