    \ in the\n   design of IP networks.  However, as IP networks evolve, the concept\n\
    \   of service in IP is also evolving, and the strategies of the past may\n  \
    \ not apply to the full-service QoS-capable network envisioned by some\n   for\

    \ for the argument that if the promise of IP is to be\n   fulfilled, networks\
    \ will need to offer an increasing variety of\n   services.  The definition of\

- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The task of defining a management framework for QoS will be\
    \ difficult\n   due to the fact that it represents a radical departure from the\
    \ best\n   effort service model that was at the core of IP in the past, and had\n\
    \   a clear design strategy to have simplicity take precedence over\n   everything\
    \ else [1].  This philosophy was nowhere more apparent than\n   in the network\
    \ and service management area for IP [2].  Proposed\n   changes to support a variety\
    \ of QoS features will impact the existing\n   control structure in a very dramatic\
    \ way.  Compounding the problem is\n   the lack of understanding of what makes\
    \ up a \"service\" in IP [3].\n   Unlike some other network technologies, in IP\
    \ it does not suffice to\n   limit the scope of service management simply to end-to-end\n\
    \   connectivity, but the transport service offered to packets and the\n   way\
    \ the transport is used must also be covered.  QoS management is a\n   subset\
    \ of the more general service management.  In looking to solve\n   the QoS management\
    \ problem it can be useful to understand some of the\n   issues and limitations\
    \ of the service management problem.  QoS can\n   not be treated as a standalone\
    \ entity and will have its management\n   requirements driven by the general higher\
    \ level service requirements.\n   If the available transport services in IP expand,\
    \ the result will be\n   the further expansion of what is considered a service.\
    \  The now\n   de-facto inclusion of WEB services in the scope of IP service,\
    \ which\n   is remarkable given that the WEB did not even exist when IP was first\n\
    \   invented, illustrates this situation well.  This phenomenon can be\n   expected\
    \ to increase with the current trend towards moving network\n   decision points\
    \ towards the boundary of the network and, as a result,\n   closer to the applications\
    \ and customers.  Additionally, the argument\n   continues over the need for QoS\
    \ in IP networks at all.  New\n   technologies based on fiber and wavelength-division\
    \ multiplexing have\n   many people convinced that bandwidth will be so inexpensive\
    \ it is not\n   going to be necessary to have an explicit control framework for\n\
    \   providing QoS differentiation.  However uneconomical it is to\n   engineer\
    \ a network for peak usage, a major argument in this debate\n   certainly is the\
    \ cost of developing operational support systems for a\n   QoS network and deploying\
    \ them in the existing networks.  Just the\n   fact that customers might be willing\
    \ to pay for additional service\n   may not be justification for implementing\
    \ sweeping architectural\n   changes that could seriously affect the Internet\
    \ as it is known\n   today.  The IP community must be very concerned that the\
    \ equality\n   that characterized  the best effort Internet may be sacrificed\
    \ in\n   favor of a service that has a completely different business model.\n\
    \   If the core network started to provide services that generated more\n   revenue,\
    \ it could easily come at the expense of the less revenue\n   generating best\
    \ effort service.\n"
- title: 3. IP Management Standardization
  contents:
  - "3. IP Management Standardization\n   Management standardization efforts in the\
    \ IP community have\n   traditionally been concerned with what is commonly referred\
    \ to as\n   \"element management\" or \"device management\".  Recently, new efforts\n\
    \   in IP management have added the ability to address service issues and\n  \
    \ to look at the network in more abstract terms.  These efforts which\n   included\
    \ a logical representation of services as well as the\n   representation of resources\
    \ in the network, combined with the notion\n   of a user of a service, has made\
    \ possible the much talked about\n   concept of 'policy'.  Notable among these\
    \ efforts are the Policy work\n   in the IETF and the DMTF work on CIM and DEN.\
    \  Crucial elements of\n   the service management framework are coming into perspective,\
    \ but\n   point to a trend in IP that is a quite radical departure from the\n\
    \   control mechanisms of the past.  As the service model evolves from\n   being\
    \ what was sufficient to support best effort to being able to\n   support variable\
    \ levels of service, a trend towards a centralized\n   management architecture\
    \ has become quite apparent.\n   This is becoming increasingly apparent for two\
    \ reasons.  QoS\n   mechanisms need network wide information [4], and for them\
    \ to\n   succeed, they must not require a tremendous amount of support from\n\
    \   the core network.  It is becoming increasingly accepted that only at\n   the\
    \ edge of the network will there be sufficient resources to provide\n   the mechanisms\
    \ necessary to admit and control various QoS flows.\n   A question often asked\
    \ these days is if \"the architectural benefits\n   of providing services in the\
    \ middle of the network outweigh the\n   architectural costs\"[5].  This same\
    \ question should be asked of\n   service management.  As new network elements\
    \ are needed to support\n   service management, even if they are not contributing\
    \ directly to the\n   forwarding of packets, the cost both in the increased complexity\
    \ and\n   the possibility of destabilizing the networks needs to be considered.\n\
    \   An analyses of this issue will be made by the SMRG when we start to\n   look\
    \ more in detail at some of the issues raised in this survey\n   document.\n"
- title: 4. Telecommunications Service Management
  contents:
  - "4. Telecommunications Service Management\n   One place to start an effort to\
    \ define service management in IP\n   networks is by looking at what has been\
    \ done previously in\n   telecommunications networks.  The telecommunications\
    \ standards for a\n   service management framework have not received wide scale\
    \ acceptance\n   even in an environment in which the service is fairly constrained.\n\
    \   Many proprietary protocols still dominate in the market even though\n   regulation\
    \ has made it necessary for network operators to open their\n   networks sufficiently\
    \ to allow for multiple vendor participation in\n   providing the service.  This\
    \ indicates that some formalized\n   boundaries exist or the markets are sufficiently\
    \ large to justify the\n   development of interfaces.  International telecommunications\n\
    \   management standards look at the complete management problem by\n   dividing\
    \ it into separate but highly related layers.  Much of the\n   terminology used\
    \ to describe the management problem in IP has\n   diffused from the telecommunications\
    \ standards [6].  These standards\n   were designed specifically to address telecommunications\
    \ networks and\n   services, and it is not clear how applicable they will be to\
    \ IP\n   networks.  Service management is defined in terms of the set of\n   services\
    \ found in telecommunications networks and the management\n   framework reflects\
    \ the hierarchical centralized control structure of\n   these networks.  The framework\
    \ for service management is based on the\n   Telecommunications Management Network\
    \ (TMN) layered approach to\n   management.  Current IP standards are heavily\
    \ weighted towards the\n   element management layer and especially towards the\
    \ gathering of\n   statistical data with a decentralized approach being emphasized.\
    \  In\n   the TMN architecture a dependency exists between layers and clear\n\
    \   interfaces at the boundaries are defined.  To what extent service\n   management,\
    \ as defined in the TMN standards, can be applied to IP\n   where there would\
    \ likely be resistance to a requirement to have\n   formalized interfaces between\
    \ layers [6] must be further\n   investigated.\n   TMN concepts must be applied\
    \ carefully to IP networks because\n   fundamental differences exist.  Control\
    \ of IP networks is highly\n   distributed especially in the network layer.  Management\
    \ is non-\n   hierarchical and decentralized with many peer-to-peer relationships.\n\
    \   A formal division of management into layers, where management\n   dependencies\
    \ exist at the borders of these layers, may not be\n   applicable to IP.  Any\
    \ effort to define service management in IP must\n   be constantly vigilant that\
    \ it does not assume the telecommunications\n   concepts can be applied directly\
    \ to IP networks.  The most basic\n   abstraction of the network management problem\
    \ into element, network,\n   and service management has its origins in the telecommunications\n\
    \   industry's standardization work and the IP management framework might\n  \
    \ not have made even these distinctions if it where not for the\n   telecommunications\
    \ legacy.\n"
- title: '5. IP Service Management: Problem Statement'
  contents:
  - "5. IP Service Management: Problem Statement\n   In defining the Service Management\
    \ Framework for IP, the nature of\n   services that are going to need to be managed\
    \ must be addressed.\n   Traditionally network management frameworks consist of\
    \ two parts, an\n   informational framework and the framework to distribute information\n\
    \   to the network devices.  A very straight forward relationship exists\n   in\
    \ that the distribution framework must support the informational\n   one, but\
    \ also more subtle relationships exists with what the\n   informational and distribution\
    \ frameworks imply about the management\n   of the system.  The informational\
    \ framework appears to be the easier\n   problem to address and the one that is\
    \ principally being focused on\n   by the IP community.\n   Efforts like the DMTF\
    \ CIM are currently trying to define network, and\n   to a lesser extent service,\
    \ information models.  These efforts show a\n   surprising similarity to those\
    \ of the telecommunications industry to\n   define information models [7].  What\
    \ has not emerged is a standard\n   for defining how the information contained\
    \ in the models is to be\n   used to manage a network.\n   The number of elements\
    \ to be managed in these networks will require\n   this information to be highly\
    \ distributed.  Highly distributed\n   directories would be a prime candidate\
    \ for the information that is of\n   a static nature.  For information that is\
    \ of a dynamic nature the\n   problem becomes far more complex and has yet to\
    \ be satisfactorily\n   addressed.  Policy management is a logical extension of\
    \ having\n   distributed directories services available in the network.  The IETF\n\
    \   and DMTF are looking to Policy management to be a framework to handle\n  \
    \ certain service management issues.  Much of the current policy\n   efforts are\
    \ focused on access and traffic prioritization within a\n   particular network\
    \ element and only for a single administrative\n   domain [8].  Classifying traffic\
    \ flows and enforcing policies at the\n   edge with the intent of focusing on\
    \ admission issues, without\n   addressing the end-to-end nature of the problem,\
    \ leaves some of the\n   most complex QoS management issues still unanswered.\
    \  Providing a\n   verifiable commodity level of service, in IP, will effect every\
    \ facet\n   of the network and a management solution to the problem will have\
    \ to\n   address the scale and the dynamics by which it operates.\n"
- title: 5.1 Common Management Domain
  contents:
  - "5.1 Common Management Domain\n   Standardization efforts need to concentrate\
    \ on the management\n   problems that are multi-domain in character.  The test\
    \ for multi-\n   domain often centers around there being a many-to-one or a one-to-\n\
    \   many relationship requiring the involvement of two or more distinct\n   entities.\
    \  Domains could reflect the administrative domain, routing\n   domain, or include\
    \ agreements between domains.  Unlike the\n   telecommunications network in which\
    \ traffic traverses only a\n   relatively small number of domains, traffic in\
    \ IP networks is likely\n   to traverse numerous domains under separate administrative\
    \ control.\n   Further complicating the situation is, that unlike the\n   telecommunications\
    \ network, many of these domains will be highly\n   competitive in nature, offering\
    \ and accommodating varying service\n   level agreements.  Telecommunications\
    \ traffic, even with\n   deregulation, passes from the access providers network\
    \ to a core\n   network and then, if it is an international call, across\n   international\
    \ boundaries.  The number of domains is relative to IP\n   small, the service\
    \ supported in each is virtually identical, and yet\n   each domains is likely\
    \ to have a different business model from the\n   other.  In contrast IP will\
    \ have many domains, many services, and\n   domains will likely be highly competitive.\
    \  To be successful IP will\n   need to model the domain problem in a way that\
    \ reduces the complexity\n   that arises from having many independent networks\
    \ each having a\n   different service model being responsible for a single flow.\n\
    \   Addressing service management issues across domains that are direct\n   competitors\
    \ of each other will also complicate the process because a\n   solution must not\
    \ expose too much information about the capabilities\n   of one domains network\
    \ to the competitor.  Solutions may require a\n   3rd party trusted by both to\
    \ provide the needed management functions\n   while at the same time insuring\
    \ that sensitive information does not\n   pass from one to the other.\n"
- title: 5.2 Service Management Business Processes
  contents:
  - "5.2 Service Management Business Processes\n   A service management framework\
    \ must address the business processes\n   that operate when providing a service.\
    \  A service can be separated\n   into two fundamental divisions.  The first is\
    \ the definition of the\n   service and the second is the embodiment of the service.\
    \  While this\n   division may seem intuitive, a formal process that addresses\
    \ these\n   two aspects of a service needs to be in place if management of the\n\
    \   service is to be actually realized.\n   In specifying a service it must be\
    \ possible to map it onto the\n   capabilities of the underlying network architecture.\
    \  The service\n   needs to be specified in an unambiguous way so that mechanisms\
    \ can be\n   put in place to enable the control of the service.  It can be a\n\
    \   useful tool to view the relationship of the definition of a service\n   to\
    \ an instance of that service to the relationship between the\n   definition of\
    \ an object to the instantiation of that object in object\n   oriented modeling.\
    \  As networks evolve it is going to be necessary to\n   logically describe the\
    \ network capabilities to the service and\n   because IP networks are so fragmented\
    \ specific service\n   classifications will need to be made available that transcend\
    \ the\n   individual regions and domains.  An interface that defines and\n   controls\
    \ the network capabilities, abstracted for the service\n   perspective, allows\
    \ for the administration of the network by the\n   service management systems.\n\
    \   Services are often designed with management capabilities specific to\n   them.\
    \  These services have tended to not rely on the service aspects\n   of the network,\
    \ but only on its transport capabilities.  As services\n   become more dependent\
    \ on the network, Management over a shared\n   framework will be required.  Operators\
    \ have recognized the business\n   need to allow the user to have as much control\
    \ over the management of\n   their own services as possible.  IP services will\
    \ be highly diverse\n   and customizable further necessitating that the management\
    \ of the\n   service be made available to the user to the extent possible.\n \
    \  In the IP environment where they may be many separate entities\n   required\
    \ to provide the service this will create a significant\n   management challenge.\n"

  - "5.3 Billing and Security\n   Paramount to the success of any service is determining\
    \ how that\n   service will be billed.  The process by which billing will take\
    \ place\n   must be defined at the service inception.  It is here that the\n \
    \  network support necessary for billing should be addressed.\n   Analogously,\
    \ security must also be addressed in the most early stages\n   of the service\
    \ definition.  It is not practical to assume that the\n   billing and the security\
    \ services will be hosted by the same provider\n   as the service itself or that\
    \ it will be possible to have the billing\n   and security functions specifically\
    \ designed for every service.\n   These functions will have to be a generic part\
    \ of the network.\n"

  - "5.4 Standards\n   Given the limited success of the telecommunications standards\
    \ bodies\n   efforts to formalize the relationship between different management\n\
    \   support functions it is highly suspect that such efforts would\n   succeed\
    \ in IP networks which have an even more diverse concept of\n   network and services.\
    \  If the IP network is to be made up of peer\n   domains of equal dominion it\
    \ will be necessary to have management\n   functionality that is able to traverse\
    \ these domains.  Of course the\n   perspective of where management responsibility\
    \ lies is largely\n   dependent on the reference point.  A centric vantage point\
    \ indicates\n   responsibility shared equally among different domains.  From within\n\
    \   any particular domain management responsibility exists within that\n   domain\
    \ and that domain only.  For a management framework to succeed\n   in IP networks\
    \ logical management functions will have to be\n   identified along with an extremely\
    \ flexible definition language to\n   define the interface to these management\
    \ functions.  The more the\n   management functionality will have to cross boundaries\
    \ of\n   responsibility, the more the network management functions have to be\n\
    \   distributed throughout the network.\n"
- title: 5.5 Core Inter-domain Functions
  contents:
  - "5.5 Core Inter-domain Functions\n   The service management paradigm for IP must\
    \ address management from a\n   perspective that is a combination of technical\
    \ solutions as well as a\n   formula for representing vendor business relationships.\
    \  Currently\n   services that need support between domains require that the service\n\
    \   level agreements (SLAs) be negotiated between the providers.  At some\n  \
    \ point these agreements will likely become unmanageable, if the number\n   of\
    \ agreements becomes very large and/or the nature of the agreements\n   is highly\
    \ variable.  This will result in there being sufficient need\n   for some form\
    \ of standardization to control these agreements.\n   Bandwidth Brokers have been\
    \ conceived as a method for dealing with\n   many of the problems between the\
    \ domains relating to traffic from a\n   business perspective.  The premise of\
    \ the Bandwidth Brokers is to\n   insure agreement between the network domains\
    \ with regards to traffic,\n   but security and billing issues, that are not likely\
    \ to be as\n   quantifiable, will also need to be addressed.  Service providers\
    \ have\n   traditionally been reluctant to use bandwidth broker or SLA types of\n\
    \   functions as they fear such tools expose their weaknesses to\n   competitors\
    \ and customers.  While this is not a technical problem, it\n   does pose a real\
    \ practical problem in managing a service effectively.\n   Looking at the basic\
    \ requirements of the QoS network of the future\n   two competing philosophies\
    \ become apparent.  The network providers\n   are interested in having more control\
    \ over the traffic to allow them\n   to choose what traffic gets priority especially\
    \ in a congested\n   environment.  Users desire the ability to identify a path\
    \ that has\n   the characteristics very similar to a leased line [9].  In either\n\
    \   situation as IP bandwidth goes from being delivered on an equal\n   basis,\
    \ to being delivered based on complex formulas, there will\n   become an increasing\
    \ need to provide authentication and validation to\n   verify who gets what service\
    \ and that they pay for it.  This will\n   include the ability to measure that\
    \ the service specified is being\n   provided, to define the exact parameters\
    \ of the service, and to\n   verify that only an authorized level of service is\
    \ being provided.\n   Some of the earlier work on an architectural framework for\
    \ mixed\n   traffic networks has suggested that bilateral agreements will be the\n\
    \   only method that will work between administrative domains [10].\n   Multilateral\
    \ agreements may indeed be complex to administer, but\n   bilateral agreements\
    \ will not scale well and if the traffic needs to\n   traverse many administrative\
    \ domains it will be hard to quantify the\n   end-to-end service being provided.\
    \  Instability in the ownership and\n   administration of domains will also limit\
    \ the usability of bilateral\n   agreements in predicting end-to-end service.\n\
    \   As the convergence towards all IP continues it will be interesting to\n  \
    \ understand what effects existing telecommunications regulations might\n   have\
    \ on IP networks as more regulated traffic is carried over them.\n   Regulation\
    \ has been used in the telecommunications world to open the\n   network, but it\
    \ has had mixed results.  A regulated process could\n   possibly eliminate the\
    \ effects competitive pressures will have on\n   bilateral types of agreements\
    \ and make it possible to get a truly\n   open environment, but it could also\
    \ have an opposite effect.\n   Unfortunately the answer to this question may not\
    \ come in the form of\n   the best technical solution but in the politically most\
    \ acceptable\n   one.  If traffic agreements between the boundaries of networks\
    \ is not\n   standardized a continuing consolidation of network providers would\n\
    \   result.  Providers unable to induce other providers to pair with them\n  \
    \ may not be able to compete if QoS networks become commonplace.  This\n   would\
    \ be especially visible for small and midsize service providers,\n   who would\
    \ be pressured to combine with a larger provider or face not\n   being able to\
    \ offer the highest levels of service.  If this\n   phenomenon plays out across\
    \ international boundaries it is hard to\n   predict what the final outcome might\
    \ be.\n"
- title: 5.6 Network Services

  - "5.6 Network Services\n   The majority of current activity on higher level management\
    \ functions\n   for IP networks have been restricted to the issue of providing\
    \ QoS.\n   Many service issues still remain to be resolved with respect to the\n\
    \   current best effort paradigm and many more can be expected if true\n   QoS\
    \ support is realized.  Authentication, authorization and\n   accounting services\
    \ still inadequate for the existing best effort\n   service will need additional\
    \ work to support QoS services.\n   It is reasonable that services can be classified\
    \ into application\n   level services and transport level services.  Transport\
    \ services are\n   the services that the network provides independent of any\n\
    \   application.  These include services such as Packet Forwarding and\n   Routing,\
    \ QoS differentiation, Traffic Engineering etc.  These might\n   also include\
    \ such functions as security (Ipsec) and Directory\n   services.  In IP networks\
    \ a distinction is often made between QoS\n   transport services that are viewed\
    \ as end-to-end (RSVP) or per-hop\n   (Diffserv).  From a management perspective\

    \  An application\n   that needs additional transport level services will need\

    \   can be justified.  Because of the effort in altering transport\n   services,\
    \ applications that need new ones will have a longer time to\n   market and the\
    \ effort and cost to develop a framework necessary to\n   support new transport\
    \ services should not be underestimated.\n   Application level services are those\
    \ specific to the application.\n   Many service management functions occur between\
    \ the application\n   supplier and the application consumer which require no knowledge\
    \ or\n   support by the existing network.  By keeping service management\n   functions\
    \ at this level time to market and costs can be greatly\n   reduced.  The disadvantages\
    \ are that many applications need the same\n   functionality causing inefficient\
    \ use of the network resources.\n   Services supplied by the network are able\
    \ to be built more robustly\n   and can provide additional functionality, by virtue\
    \ of having access\n   to information that applications can not, providing additional\n\
    \   benefit over application level services.  An example of an\n   application\
    \ level service that could benefit from a Network service\n   is the AAA paradigm\
    \ for Web based E-Commerce, which is largely\n   restricted to user input of credit\
    \ card information.  Sometimes\n   application level service requirements have\
    \ the disadvantages of both\n   transport service and application service level.\
    \  For instance, in IP\n   telephony, this may include services provided by a\
    \ gateway or other\n   network device specific to IP telephony to support such\
    \ services as\n   call forwarding or call waiting.  The mass appeal of IP telephony\n\
    \   makes it possible to suggest considerable infrastructure changes, but\n  \
    \ the nature of this kind of change has contributed to the slow\n   penetration\
    \ of IP telephony applications.\n"

  - "6. The Way to a QoS Management Architecture\n   An overview of some of the problems\
    \ in the previous sections shows a\n   need for a consolidated framework.  Transport\
    \ level QoS will demand\n   traffic engineering that has a view of the complete\
    \ network that is\n   far more comprehensive than what is currently available\
    \ via the\n   Routing protocols.  This view will need to including dynamic network\n\
    \   congestion information as well as connectivity information.  The\n   current\
    \ existing best-effort transport control may become more of a\n   hindrance to\
    \ new services and may be of questionable value if the IP\n   network will truly\
    \ become a full service QoS network.  Both IntServ\n   and DiffServ QoS schemes\
    \ require network provisioning to adequately\n   support QoS within a particular\
    \ domain and agreements for traffic\n   traversing domains.  Policy management,\
    \ object oriented information\n   models, and domain gateways are leading to a\
    \ more centralized\n   management structure that provides full service across\
    \ domains and\n   throughout the network.  Given the probable cost and complexity\
    \ of\n   such a system failure to come up with a standard, even if it is a de\n\
    \   facto one, will have serious implications for the Internet in the\n   future.\n"
- title: 6.1 Point to Point QoS
  contents:
  - "6.1 Point to Point QoS\n   For the current trends in QoS to succeed, there will\
    \ need to be\n   harmonization across the new and existing control structures.\
    \  By\n   utilizing a structure very similar to the existing routing control\n\
    \   structures, it should be possible develop functionality, not in the\n   data\
    \ path, that can allocate traffic within a domain and use inter-\n   domain signaling\
    \ to distribute between domains.  Additional\n   functionality, necessary to support\
    \ QoS-like authorization and\n   authentication functions for edge devices admitting\
    \ QoS traffic and\n   administering and allocating traffic between administrative\
    \ domains\n   could also be supported.  While meeting the requirements for a\n\
    \   bandwidth broker network element [10], additional functionality of\n   making\
    \ more general policy decisions and QoS routing could also be\n   performed. \
    \ Given that these tasks are interrelated it makes sense to\n   integrate them\
    \ if possible.\n   The new service architecture must allocate traffic within a\n\
    \   particular administrative domain and signal traffic requirements\n   across\
    \ domains, while at the same time it must be compatible with the\n   current method\
    \ for routing traffic.  This could be accomplished by\n   redirecting routing\
    \ messages to a central function, which would then\n   calculate paths based on\
    \ the entire network transport requirements.\n   Across domains, communication\
    \ would occur as necessary to establish\n   and maintain service levels at the\
    \ gateways.  At the edges, devices\n   would provide traffic information to billing\
    \ interfaces and verify\n   that the service level agreed to was being provided.\
    \  For scalability\n   any central function would need to be able to be distributed\
    \ in large\n   networks.  Routing messages, very similar in content to the existing\n\
    \   ones, would provide information sufficient to support the traffic\n   engineering\
    \ requirements without changing the basic forwarding\n   functions of the devices.\
    \  Having routes computed centrally would\n   simplify network devices by alleviating\
    \ them from performing\n   computationally intensive routing related tasks.\n\
    \   Given the number of flows through the network the core can not know\n   about\
    \ individual flow states [11].  At the same time it is not\n   practical to expect\
    \ that the edge devices can determine paths that\n   will optimally utilize the\
    \ network resources.  As the information\n   needed to forward traffic through\
    \ the network becomes related to\n   complex parameters that can not be determined\
    \ on a per hop basis and\n   have nothing to do with the forwarding of packets,\
    \ which routers do\n   best, it might make sense to move the function of determining\
    \ routes\n   to network components specifically designed for the task.  In a QoS\n\
    \   network routing decisions will become increasingly dependent on\n   information\
    \ not easily discernable from the data that routers could\n   logically share\
    \ between themselves.  This will necessitate the need\n   to for additional functionality\
    \ to determine the routing of data\n   through the network and further suggests\
    \ that all the information\n   needed to allow a router to forward packets might\
    \ not be better\n   provided by a network element external to the packet forwarding\n\
    \   functions of a router.\n   At the edges of the network where the traffic is\
    \ admitted it will be\n   necessary to have mechanisms that will insure the traffic\
    \ is within\n   the bounds of what has been specified.  To achieve this it will\
    \ be\n   necessary to buffer and control the input traffic.  Second the\n   traffic\
    \ would need to be marked so the other network elements are\n   able to identify\
    \ that this is preferred traffic without having to\n   keep flow information.\
    \  Conversely, a path could be chosen for the\n   traffic that was dedicated to\
    \ the level of service being requested\n   that was per flow based.  A combination\
    \ of the two would be possible\n   that would allow a reservation of resources\
    \ that would accommodate\n   multiple flows.  Both methods are similar from a\
    \ management\n   perspective and are really identical with regards to route\n\
    \   determination that could be performed centrally in that one method\n   represents\
    \ just a virtual path based on the handling of the packets\n   by the device in\
    \ the network and the second would be a pre-reserved\n   path through the network.\
    \  Existing best effort routing will not\n   provide the optimum routes for these\
    \ new levels of service and to\n   achieve this it would be necessary to have\
    \ either routing protocols\n   that supported optimum path discovery or mechanisms\
    \ to configure\n   paths necessary to support the required services.  In addition\
    \ to\n   specific service parameters reliability will also be a potential\n  \
    \ service discriminator.  It is unlikely using traditional path\n   determination\
    \ methods that in the event of a failure a new path could\n   be determined sufficiently\
    \ quickly to maintain the agreed service\n   level.  This would imply the need\
    \ for multiple path reservations in\n   some instances.  Because Per flow reservations\
    \ are too resource\n   intensive virtual trunks would provide a good way to reduce\
    \ the\n   amount of management traffic by reserving blocks of capacity and\n \
    \  would provide stability in the event of a failure in the resource\n   reservation\
    \ and route selection functions.\n   There are implications of providing shaping\
    \ at the network\n   boundaries.  Shaping would include both rate and burst parameters\
    \ as\n   well as possible delay aspects.  Having to provision services with\n\
    \   specific service parameters would present both major business and\n   technical\
    \ problems.  By definition, packet data is bursty in nature\n   and there exist\
    \ periods of idleness during the session that a\n   provider could reasonable\
    \ hope to exploit to better utilize the\n   network resources.  It is not practical\
    \ to expect a consumer paying a\n   premium for a service would not check that\
    \ the service was truly\n   available.  Such a service model seems to be filled\
    \ with peril for\n   the existing best effort Internet, because any significant\
    \ amount of\n   bandwidth that was reserved for exclusive use or a high priority\
    \ flow\n   would not be available for best effort data.\n   With respect to traffic\
    \ within the network itself there will be the\n   need to pre-configure routes\
    \ and to provide the ability to have\n   routes be dynamically configured.  Some\
    \ of the problems with pre-\n   configured traffic include the basic inconsistency\
    \ with the way\n   traffic is currently engineered through the Internet and the\n\
    \   difficulty in developing arrangements between administrative domains.\n  \
    \ The current Internet has been developed with one of the most\n   egalitarian\
    \ yet simplistic methods of sharing bandwidth.  Supporting\n   the existing best\
    \ effort service, in an unbiased way, while at the\n   same time providing for\
    \ other classes of service could potentially\n   add a tremendous amount of complexity\
    \ to the QoS scheme.  On the\n   other hand, if the reserved bandwidth is not\
    \ shared it could result\n   in a significant impact on the availability of the\
    \ bandwidth in the\n   Internet as we know it today.  QoS could potentially contribute\
    \ more\n   to their being insufficient bandwidth, by reserving bandwidth within\n\
    \   the network that can not be used by other services, even though it\n   can\
    \ be expected that this bandwidth will be underutilized for much of\n   the time.\
    \  Add to that the motivation of the service providers in\n   wanting to sell\
    \ commodity bandwidth, and there could be tremendous\n   pressures on the availability\
    \ of Internet bandwidth.\n   Current work within the IP community on defining\
    \ mechanisms to\n   provide QoS have centered on a particular few architectures\
    \ and a\n   handful of new protocols.  In the following sections, we will examine\n\
    \   some of the particular issues with regards to the current IP\n   community\
    \ efforts as they relate to the previous discussions.  It is\n   not the goal\
    \ of this document to serve as a tutorial on these efforts\n   but rather to identify\
    \ some of the support issues related to using\n   particular technologies that\
    \ support some form of classifiable\n   service within an IP network.\n"
- title: 6.2 QoS Service Management Scope
  contents:
  - "6.2 QoS Service Management Scope\n   One can restrict the scope of a discussion\
    \ of QoS management only to\n   the configuration of a path between two endpoints.\
    \  Even within this\n   limited scope there still remains many unresolved issues.\
    \  There is\n   no expectation that a QoS path for traffic between two points\
    \ needs\n   to be, or should be, the same in both directions.  Given that there\n\
    \   will be an originator of the connection there are questions about how\n  \
    \ billing and accounting with be resolved if the return path is\n   established\
    \ by a different provider then that of the originator of\n   the connection. \
    \ To facilitate billing a method will need to exist\n   that permits the application\
    \ originating the call to pay also for the\n   return path and also for collect\
    \ calls to be made.  3rd party\n   providers will need to be established that\
    \ are trusted by all parties\n   in the data path to insure billing and guaranteed\
    \ payment.  Utilizing\n   the service of a virtual DCN that is built upon both\
    \ IETF and non-\n   IETF protocols, messages between service providers and the\
    \ 3rd party\n   verification system can be secured.  A signaling protocol will\
    \ be\n   necessary to establish the cost of the call and who will be paying\n\
    \   for it, and each provider will need a verifiable method to bill for\n   the\
    \ service provided.  As pointed out earlier this functionality will\n   be similar\
    \ to what is used in the existing telephone network, but\n   will be at a much\
    \ larger scale and potentially involve providers that\n   are highly competitive\
    \ with each other.\n"
- title: 7. The DiffServ Architecture
  contents:
  - "7. The DiffServ Architecture\n   The DiffServ management problem is two pronged.\
    \  First there is the\n   management within the administrative domain that must\
    \ be addressed,\n   and then the management between the domains.  There has been\
    \ little\n   actual work on the second in the architecture.  What work there has\n\
    \   been anticipates that service level agreements will be reached\n   between\
    \ the administrative domains, and that end-to-end service will\n   be a concatenation\
    \ of these various service level agreements.  This\n   is problematic for many\
    \ reasons.  It presumes that agreements reached\n   bilaterally could be concatenated\
    \ and continue to provide a level of\n   end-to-end service the customer would\
    \ be willing to pay a premium\n   for.  Problems discussed earlier, with trying\
    \ to maintain large\n   numbers of these agreements between competitive networks\
    \ would also\n   apply, and tend to limit the effectiveness of this approach.\
    \  To\n   efficiently establish the chain necessary to get end to end service\n\
    \   it might take an infinite number of iterations.\n   Guaranteeing a class of\
    \ service on a per hop basis is in no way a\n   guarantee of the service on an\
    \ end-to-end basis.  It is not likely\n   that a customer would be willing to\
    \ pay for an improved level of\n   service if it did not include guarantees on\
    \ the bandwidth and the\n   quantitative bounds on delay and error rates guaranteed\
    \ end-to-end.\n   This would necessitate engineering the paths through the network\
    \ so\n   as to achieve a desired end-to-end result.  While it is very likely\n\
    \   that an initial attempt at providing this kind of service will\n   specify\
    \ only a particular ingress and egress border, for robustness\n   and flexibility\
    \ it will be desirable to have a network that can\n   support such service without\
    \ such limitations.  The Intserv approach,\n   as opposed to the DiffServ architecture,\
    \ would require per flow\n   information in the core network and may as a result\
    \ of this prove not\n   to be scalable [11].  A DiffServ type architecture, with\
    \ a limited\n   number of service classes, could be pre-provisioned, and as network\n\
    \   circumstances warranted, be modified to support the actual dynamics\n   of\
    \ the network.\n   The high level functional requirements for edge routers has\
    \ been\n   quite well defined in the DiffServ architecture, but the true scope\n\
    \   of the effort to implement this functionality has not been well\n   recognized.\
    \  While interesting differences exist between the QoS\n   architecture of the\
    \ Internet and the circuit switched network used\n   for telecommunications much\
    \ of the lessons learned in\n   telecommunications should, even if they might\
    \ do little else, provide\n   some insight into the level of effort needed to\
    \ implement these kinds\n   of requirements.  Ironically, given the Internet community\
    \ in the\n   past has rejected the level of standardization that was proposed\
    \ for\n   management of telecommunications networks, it may be the full service\n\
    \   internet where it becomes actually imperative that such requirements\n   be\
    \ completed if the desired services will ever be offered.\n"

  - "8. A Summary of the QoS Functional Areas\n   The management of QoS will need\
    \ to provide functionality to the\n   application and/or at the access, at the\
    \ core, and at the boundaries\n   to administrative regions.\n   QoS traffic functions\
    \ will need to include admission control,\n   authentication and authorization,\
    \ and billing.  Verification that\n   traffic is within agreed parameters and\
    \ programmatic interfaces to\n   advise when the service is outside the agreed\
    \ limits.  Interfaces\n   that provide service verification, fault notification,\
    \ and re-\n   instantiation and termination will also be necessary.\n   Core functions\
    \ will include traffic engineering, network device\n   configuration, fault detection,\
    \ and recovery.  Network devices will\n   need to inform the management system\
    \ of their available resources and\n   the management system will need to tell\
    \ devices how and where to\n   forward data.\n   Between administrative regions\
    \ accounting, service signaling, and\n   service verification will be needed.\
    \  At the administrative\n   boundaries of the network functions similar to those\
    \ provided at the\n   edge will be necessary.  Peer entities in different administrative\n\
    \   domains would signal their needs across the boundary.  Verification\n   at\
    \ the boundary could then occur consistent with the verification at\n   the edge.\
    \  Actual traffic through the boundaries could be measured\n   and billing information\
    \ be transferred between the domains.  The\n   central management function would\
    \ be responsible for re-routing\n   traffic in the event of a failure or to better\
    \ utilize the existing\n   network resources.\n   Billing requirements suggest\
    \ the need for 3rd party verification and\n   validation functions available to\
    \ each provider of QoS service within\n   the flow.  On one side of the transaction\
    \ functionality is needed to\n   approve pricing and payment and on the other\
    \ side there will need to\n   be an interface to provide the pricing information\
    \ and make payment\n   request for payment demands.\n   These requirements will\
    \ raise a host of issues not the least of which\n   is security.  For the most\
    \ part security considerations will be\n   addressed both by securing the protocols\
    \ (like with IPsec) and by\n   establishing a dedicated network for control information\
    \ [6].  While\n   it will be in most instances too costly to create a physically\n\
    \   separated DCN it will be possible to create a virtually separated\n   network\
    \ that will provide the same security benefits.  Future work in\n   the IRTF Service\
    \ Management Research Group intends to look in detail\n   at these requirements.\n"

    \  Further analysis is needed to determine what is the\n   proper paradigm for\
