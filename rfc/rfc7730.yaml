- title: 2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Format\n   This document does not propose a new format\
    \ for trust anchor\n   material.  A trust anchor in the RPKI is represented by\
    \ a self-signed\n   X.509 Certification Authority (CA) certificate, a format commonly\n\
    \   used in PKIs and widely supported by RP software.  This document\n   specifies\
    \ a format for data used to retrieve and verify the\n   authenticity of a trust\
    \ anchor in a very simple fashion.  That data\n   is referred to as the TAL.\n\
    \   The motivation for defining the TAL is to enable selected data in the\n  \
    \ trust anchor to change, without needing to effect redistribution of\n   the\
    \ trust anchor per se.  In the RPKI, certificates contain\n   extensions that\
    \ represent Internet Number Resources (INRs) [RFC3779].\n   The set of INRs associated\
    \ with an entity acting as a trust anchor is\n   likely to change over time. \
    \ Thus, if one were to use the common PKI\n   convention of distributing a trust\
    \ anchor to RPs in a secure fashion,\n   then this procedure would need to be\
    \ repeated whenever the INR set\n   for the entity acting as a trust anchor changed.\
    \  By distributing the\n   TAL (in a secure fashion), instead of distributing\
    \ the trust anchor,\n   this problem is avoided, i.e., the TAL is constant so\
    \ long as the\n   trust anchor's public key and its location do not change.\n\
    \   The TAL is analogous to the TrustAnchorInfo data structure specified\n   in\
    \ [RFC5914], which is on the Standards Track.  That specification\n   could be\
    \ used to represent the TAL, if one defined an rsync URI\n   extension for that\
    \ data structure.  However, the TAL format was\n   adopted by RPKI implementors\
    \ prior to the PKIX trust anchor work, and\n   the RPKI implementer community\
    \ has elected to utilize the TAL format,\n   rather than define the requisite\
    \ extension.  The community also\n   prefers the simplicity of the ASCII encoding\
    \ of the TAL, versus the\n   binary (ASN.1) encoding for TrustAnchorInfo.\n  \
    \ The TAL is an ordered sequence of:\n      1)  a URI section,\n      2)  a <CRLF>\
    \ or <LF> line break,\n      3)  a subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] in DER format\
    \ [X.509],\n          encoded in Base64 (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]).  To avoid\
    \ long\n          lines, <CRLF> or <LF> line breaks MAY be inserted into the\n\
    \          Base64-encoded string.\n   where the URI section is comprised of one\
    \ of more of the ordered\n   sequence of:\n      1.1)  an rsync URI [RFC5781],\n\
    \      1.2)  a <CRLF> or <LF> line break.\n"
- title: 2.2.  TAL and Trust Anchor Certificate Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  TAL and Trust Anchor Certificate Considerations\n   Each rsync URI in the\
    \ TAL MUST reference a single object.  It MUST\n   NOT reference a directory or\
    \ any other form of collection of objects.\n   The referenced object MUST be a\
    \ self-signed CA certificate that\n   conforms to the RPKI certificate profile\
    \ [RFC6487].  This certificate\n   is the trust anchor in certification path discovery\
    \ [RFC4158] and\n   validation [RFC5280] [RFC3779].\n   The validity interval\
    \ of this trust anchor SHOULD reflect the\n   anticipated period of stability\
    \ of the particular set of INRs that\n   are associated with the putative trust\
    \ anchor.\n   The INR extension(s) of this trust anchor MUST contain a non-empty\n\
    \   set of number resources.  It MUST NOT use the \"inherit\" form of the\n  \
    \ INR extension(s).  The INR set described in this certificate is the\n   set\
    \ of number resources for which the issuing entity is offering\n   itself as a\
    \ putative trust anchor in the RPKI [RFC6480].\n   The public key used to verify\
    \ the trust anchor MUST be the same as\n   the subjectPublicKeyInfo in the CA\
    \ certificate and in the TAL.\n   The trust anchor MUST contain a stable key.\
    \  This key MUST NOT change\n   when the certificate is reissued due to changes\
    \ in the INR\n   extension(s), when the certificate is renewed prior to expiration,\
    \ or\n   for any reason other than a key change.\n   Because the public key in\
    \ the TAL and the trust anchor MUST be\n   stable, this motivates operation of\
    \ that CA in an offline mode.\n   Thus, the entity that issues the trust anchor\
    \ SHOULD issue a\n   subordinate CA certificate that contains the same INRs (via\
    \ the use\n   of the \"inherit\" option in the INR extensions of the subordinate\n\
    \   certificate).  This allows the entity that issues the trust anchor to\n  \
    \ keep the corresponding private key of this certificate offline, while\n   issuing\
    \ all relevant child certificates under the immediate\n   subordinate CA.  This\
    \ measure also allows the Certificate Revocation\n   List (CRL) issued by that\
    \ entity to be used to revoke the subordinate\n   CA certificate in the event\
    \ of suspected key compromise of this\n   online operational key pair that is\
    \ potentially more vulnerable.\n   The trust anchor MUST be published at a stable\
    \ URI.  When the trust\n   anchor is reissued for any reason, the replacement\
    \ CA certificate\n   MUST be accessible using the same URI.\n   Because the trust\
    \ anchor is a self-signed certificate, there is no\n   corresponding CRL that\
    \ can be used to revoke it, nor is there a\n   manifest [RFC6486] that lists this\
    \ certificate.\n   If an entity wishes to withdraw a self-signed CA certificate\
    \ as a\n   putative trust anchor, for any reason, including key rollover, the\n\
    \   entity MUST remove the object from the location referenced in the\n   TAL.\n\
    \   Where the TAL contains two or more rsync URIs, then the same self-\n   signed\
    \ CA certificate MUST be found at each referenced location.  In\n   order to increase\
    \ operational resilience, it is RECOMMENDED that the\n   domain name parts of\
    \ each of these URIs resolve to distinct IP\n   addresses that are used by a diverse\
    \ set of repository publication\n   points, and these IP addresses be included\
    \ in distinct Route Origin\n   Authorizations (ROAs) objects signed by different\
    \ CAs.\n"

- title: 3.  Relying Party Use
  contents:
  - "3.  Relying Party Use\n   In order to use the TAL to retrieve and validate a\
    \ (putative) trust\n   anchor, an RP SHOULD:\n   1.  Retrieve the object referenced\
    \ by (one of) the URI(s) contained\n       in the TAL.\n   2.  Confirm that the\
    \ retrieved object is a current, self-signed RPKI\n       CA certificate that\
    \ conforms to the profile as specified in\n       [RFC6487].\n   3.  Confirm that\
    \ the public key in the TAL matches the public key in\n       the retrieved object.\n\
    \   4.  Perform other checks, as deemed appropriate (locally), to ensure\n   \
    \    that the RP is willing to accept the entity publishing this self-\n     \
    \  signed CA certificate to be a trust anchor.  These tests apply to\n       the\
    \ validity of attestations made in the context of the RPKI\n       relating to\
    \ all resources described in the INR extension of this\n       certificate.\n\
    \   An RP SHOULD perform these functions for each instance of TAL that it\n  \
    \ is holding for this purpose every time the RP performs a\n   resynchronization\
    \ across the local repository cache.  In any case, an\n   RP also SHOULD perform\
    \ these functions prior to the expiration of the\n   locally cached copy of the\
    \ retrieved trust anchor referenced by the\n   TAL.\n   In the case where a TAL\
    \ contains multiple URIs, an RP MAY use a\n   locally defined preference rule\
    \ to select the URI to retrieve the\n   self-signed RPKI CA certificate that is\
    \ to be used as a trust anchor.\n   Some examples are:\n   o  Using the order\
    \ provided in the TAL\n   o  Selecting the URI randomly from the available list\n\
    \   o  Creating a prioritized list of URIs based on RP-specific\n      parameters,\
    \ such as connection establishment delay\n   If the connection to the preferred\
    \ URI fails, or the retrieved CA\n   certificate public key does not match the\
    \ TAL public key, the RP\n   SHOULD retrieve the CA certificate from the next\
    \ URI, according to\n   the local preference ranking of URIs.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Compromise of a trust anchor private key permits\
    \ unauthorized parties\n   to masquerade as a trust anchor, with potentially severe\n\
    \   consequences.  Reliance on an inappropriate or incorrect trust anchor\n  \
    \ has similar potentially severe consequences.\n   This TAL does not directly\
    \ provide a list of resources covered by the\n   referenced self-signed CA certificate.\
    \  Instead, the RP is referred\n   to the trust anchor itself and the INR extension(s)\
    \ within this\n   certificate.  This provides necessary operational flexibility,\
    \ but it\n   also allows the certificate issuer to claim to be authoritative for\n\
    \   any resource.  Relying parties should either have great confidence in\n  \
    \ the issuers of such certificates that they are configuring as trust\n   anchors,\
    \ or they should issue their own self-signed certificate as a\n   trust anchor\
    \ and, in doing so, impose constraints on the subordinate\n   certificates.\n"
