  - "THE ORIGINS OF RFCS - by Stephen D. Crocker\n   The DDN community now includes\
    \ hundreds of nodes and thousands of\n   users, but once it was all a gleam in\
    \ Larry Roberts' eye.  While much\n   of the development proceeded according to\
    \ a grand plan, the design of\n   the protocols and the creation of the RFCs was\
    \ largely accidental.\n   The procurement of the ARPANET was initiated in the\
    \ summer of 1968 --\n   Remember Vietnam, flower children, etc?  There had been\
    \ prior\n   experiments at various ARPA sites to link together computer systems,\n\
    \   but this was the first version to explore packet-switching on a grand\n  \
    \ scale.  (\"ARPA\" didn't become \"DARPA\" until 1972.)  Unlike most of\n   the\
    \ ARPA/IPTO procurements of the day, this was a competitive\n   procurement. The\
    \ contract called for four IMPs to be delivered to\n   UCLA, SRI, UCSB and The\
    \ University of Utah.  These sites were running\n   a Sigma 7 with the SEX operating\
    \ system, an SDS 940 with the Genie\n   operating system, an IBM 360/75 with OS/MVT\
    \ (or perhaps OS/MFT), and\n   a DEC PDP-10 with the Tenex operating system. \
    \ Options existed for\n   additional nodes if the first experiments were successful.\
    \  BBN won\n   the procurement in December 1968, but that gets ahead of this story.\n\
    \   Part of the reason for selecting these four sites was these were\n   existing\
    \ ARPA computer science research contractors.  The precise\n   usage of the ARPANET\
    \ was not spelled out in advance, and the research\n   community could be counted\
    \ on to take some initiative.  To stimulate\n   this process, a meeting was called\
    \ during the summer with\n   representatives from the selected sites, chaired\
    \ by Elmer Shapiro\n"

    \ from SRI.  If memory serves me correctly, Jeff Rulifson came from\n   SRI, Ron\
    \ Stoughton from UCSB, Steve Carr from Utah and I came from\n   UCLA. (Apologies\
    \ to anyone I've left out; records are inaccessible or\n   lost at this point.)\
    \  At this point we knew only that the network was\n   coming, but the precise\
    \ details weren't known.\n   That first meeting was seminal.  We had lots of questions\
    \ -- how IMPs\n   and hosts would be connected, what hosts would say to each other,\
    \ and\n   what applications would be supported.  No one had any answers, but\n\
    \   the prospects seemed exciting.  We found ourselves imagining all\n   kinds\
    \ of possibilities -- interactive graphics, cooperating\n   processes, automatic\
    \ data base query, electronic mail -- but no one\n   knew where to begin.  We\
    \ weren't sure whether there was really room\n   to think hard about these problems;\
    \ surely someone from the east\n   would be along by and by to bring the word.\
    \  But we did come to one\n   conclusion: We ought to meet again.  Over the next\
    \ several months, we\n   managed to parlay that idea into a series of exchange\
    \ meetings at\n   each of our sites, thereby setting the most important precedent\
    \ in\n   protocol design.\n   The first few meetings were quite tenuous.  We had\
    \ no official\n   charter.  Most of us were graduate students and we expected\
    \ that a\n   professional crew would show up eventually to take over the problems\n\
    \   we were dealing with.  Without clear definition of what the host-IMP\n   interface\
    \ would look like, or even what functions the IMP would\n   provide, we focused\
    \ on exotic ideas.  We envisioned the possibility\n   of application specific\
    \ protocols, with code downloaded to user\n   sites, and we took a crack at designing\
    \ a language to support this.\n   The first version was known as DEL, for \"Decode-Encode\
    \ Language\" and\n   a later version was called NIL, for \"Network Interchange\
    \ Language.\"\n   When the IMP contract was finally let and BBN provided some\
    \ definite\n   information on the host-IMP interface, all attention shifted to\n\
    \   low-level matters and the ambitious ideas for automatic downloading\n   of\
    \ code evaporated.  It was several years before ideas like remote\n   procedure\
    \ calls and typed objects reappeared.\n   In February of 1969 we met for the first\
    \ time with BBN.  I don't\n   think any of us were prepared for that meeting.\
    \  The BBN folks, led\n   by Frank Heart, Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein and Will Crowther,\
    \ found\n   themselves talking to a crew of graduate students they hadn't\n  \
    \ anticipated.  And we found ourselves talking to people whose first\n   concern\
    \ was how to get bits to flow quickly and reliably but hadn't\n   -- of course\
    \ -- spent any time considering the thirty or forty layers\n   of protocol above\
    \ the link level.  And while BBN didn't take over the\n   protocol design process,\
    \ we kept expecting that an official protocol\n   design team would announce itself.\n\
    \   A month later, after a particularly delightful meeting in Utah, it\n   became\
    \ clear to us that we had better start writing down our\n"

    \ discussions.  We had accumulated a few notes on the design of DEL and\n   other\
    \ matters, and we decided to put them together in a set of notes.\n   I remember\
    \ having great fear that we would offend whomever the\n   official protocol designers\
    \ were, and I spent a sleepless night\n   composing humble words for our notes.\
    \  The basic ground rules were\n   that anyone could say anything and that nothing\
    \ was official.  And to\n   emphasize the point, I labeled the notes \"Request\
    \ for Comments.\"  I\n   never dreamed these notes would distributed through the\
    \ very medium\n   we were discussing in these notes.  Talk about Sorcerer's Apprentice!\n\
    \   Over the spring and summer of 1969 we grappled with the detailed\n   problems\
    \ of protocol design.  Although we had a vision of the vast\n   potential for\
    \ intercomputer communication, designing usable protocols\n   was another matter.\
    \  A custom hardware interface and custom intrusion\n   into the operating system\
    \ was going to be required for anything we\n   designed, and we anticipated serious\
    \ difficulty at each of the sites.\n   We looked for existing abstractions to\
    \ use.  It would have been\n   convenient if we could have made the network simply\
    \ look like a tape\n   drive to each host, but we knew that wouldn't do.\n   It\
    \ was clear we needed to support remote login for interactive use --\n   later\
    \ known as Telnet -- and we needed to move files from machine to\n   machine.\
    \  We also knew that we needed a more fundamental point of\n   view for building\
    \ a larger array of protocols.  Unfortunately,\n   operating systems of that era\
    \ tended to view themselves as the center\n   of the universe; symmetric cooperation\
    \ did not fit into the concepts\n   currently available within these operating\
    \ systems.  And time was\n   pressing: The first IMP was due to be delivered to\
    \ UCLA September 1,\n   1969, and the rest were scheduled at monthly intervals.\n\
    \   At UCLA we scrambled to build a host-IMP interface.  SDS, the builder\n  \
    \ of the Sigma 7, wanted many months and many dollars to do the job.\n   Mike\
    \ Wingfield, another grad student at UCLA, stepped in and offered\n   to get interface\
    \ built in six weeks for a few thousand dollars.  He\n   had a gorgeous, fully\
    \ instrumented interface working in five and one\n   half weeks.  I was in charge\
    \ of the software, and we were naturally\n   running a bit late.  September 1\
    \ was Labor Day, so I knew I had a\n   couple of extra days to debug the software.\
    \  Moreover, I had heard\n   BBN was having some timing troubles with the software,\
    \ so I had some\n   hope they'd miss the ship date.  And I figured that first\
    \ some\n   Honeywell people would install the hardware -- IMPs were built out\
    \ of\n   Honeywell 516s in those days -- and then BBN people would come in a\n\
    \   few days later to shake down the software.  An easy couple of weeks\n   of\
    \ grace.\n   BBN fixed their timing trouble, air shipped the IMP, and it arrived\n\
    \   on our loading dock on Saturday, August 30.  They arrived with the\n   IMP,\
    \ wheeled it into our computer room, plugged it in and the\n"

    \ software restarted from where it had been when the plug was pulled in\n   Cambridge.\
    \  Still Saturday, August 30.  Panic time at UCLA.\n   The second IMP was delivered\
    \ to SRI at the beginning of October, and\n   ARPA's interest was intense.  Larry\
    \ Roberts and Barry Wessler came by\n   for a visit on November 21, and we actually\
    \ managed to demonstrate a\n   Telnet-like connection to SRI.\n   With the pressure\
    \ to get something working and the general confusion\n   as to how to achieve\
    \ the high generality we all aspired to, we punted\n   and defined the first set\
    \ of protocols to include only Telnet and FTP\n   functions.  In particular, only\
    \ asymmetric, user-server relationships\n   were supported.  In December 1969,\
    \ we met with Larry Roberts in Utah,\n   and suffered our first direct experience\
    \ with \"redirection\".  Larry\n   made it abundantly clear that our first step\
    \ was not big enough, and\n   we went back to the drawing board.  Over the next\
    \ few months we\n   designed a symmetric host-host protocol, and we defined an\
    \ abstract\n   implementation of the protocol known as the Network Control Program.\n\
    \   (\"NCP\" later came to be used as the name for the protocol, but it\n   originally\
    \ meant the program within the operating system that managed\n   connections.\
    \  The protocol itself was known blandly only as the\n   host-host protocol.)\
    \  Along with the basic host-host protocol, we\n   also envisioned a hierarchy\
    \ of protocols, with Telnet, FTP and some\n   splinter protocols as the first\
    \ examples.  If we had only consulted\n   the ancient mystics, we would have seen\
    \ immediately that seven layers\n   were required.\n   The initial experiment\
    \ had been declared an immediate success and the\n   network continued to grow.\
    \  More and more people started coming to\n   meetings, and the Network Working\
    \ Group began to take shape.  Working\n   Group meetings started to have 50 and\
    \ 100 people in attendance\n   instead of the half dozen we had had in 1968 and\
    \ early 1969.  We held\n   one meeting in conjunction with the Spring Joint Computer\
    \ Conference\n   in Atlantic City in 1971.  In October 1971 we all convened at\
    \ MIT for\n   a major protocol \"fly-off\".  Representatives from each site were\
    \ on\n   hand, and everyone tried to log in to everyone else's site.  With the\n\
    \   exception of one site that was completely down, the matrix was almost\n  \
    \ completely filled in, and we had reached a major milestone in\n   connectivity.\n\
    \   The rapid growth of the network and the working group also led to a\n   large\
    \ pile of RFCs.  When the 100th RFC was in sight, Peggy Karp took\n   on the task\
    \ of indexing them.  That seemed like a large task then,\n   and we could have\
    \ hardly anticipated seeing more than a 1000 RFCs\n   several years later.\n \
    \  Where will it end?  The network has the exceeded all estimates of its\n   growth.\
    \  It has been transformed, extended, cloned, renamed and\n   reimplemented. \

    \ discussion of the design of a\n      personal-computer-based distributed mail\
    \ system.  Pcmail is a\n      distributed mail system that provides mail service\
    \ to an arbitrary\n      number of users, each of which owns one or more personal\
    \ computers\n      (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists\n\
    \      of a single entity called the \"repository\".  The repository is a\n  \
    \    storage center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can\n      arrive\
    \ externally from the Internet or internally from other\n      repository users.\
    \  The repository also maintains a stable copy of\n      each user's mail state.\
    \  The repository is therefore typically a\n      computer with a large amount\
    \ of disk storage. It is published for\n      discussion and comment, and does\
    \ not constitute a standard.  As\n      the proposal may change, implementation\

    \  ISO Transport Services on Top of the\n                                    TCP\n\
    \      This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the\n      ARPA-Internet\
    \ community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined\n      various session, presentation,\
    \ and application recommendations\n      which have been adopted by the international\
    \ community and\n      numerous vendors.  To the largest extent possible, it is\
    \ desirable\n      to offer these higher level services directly to the\n    \
    \  ARPA-Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This\n      permits\
    \ users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications\n      which previously\
    \ were not available in the ARPA-Internet.  The\n      intention is that hosts\
    \ within the ARPA-Internet that choose to\n      implement ISO TSAP services on\
    \ top of the TCP be expected to adopt\n      and implement this standard.  Suggestions\
    \ for improvement are\n      encouraged.\n"

    \      This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in\n     \
    \ the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and\n      suggestions\
    \ for improvements.  One of the services frequently\n      neglected in computer\
    \ network design is a high-quality,\n      time-of-day clock capable of generating\
    \ accurate timestamps with\n      small errors compared to one-way network delays.\
    \  Such a service\n      would be useful for tracing the progress of complex transactions,\n\
    \      synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring network performance\n     \
    \ and isolating problems.  In this memo, one such clock service\n      design\
    \ will be described and its performance assessed.  This\n      design has been\

    \ algorithms for the\n      ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and\
    \ suggestions\n      for improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet\n\
    \      community in determining accurate time from a set of mutually\n      suspicious\
    \ network clocks has been prompted by several occasions\n      in which errors\
    \ were found in usually reliable, accurate clock\n      servers after thunderstorms\
    \ which disrupted their power supply.\n      To these sources of error should\
    \ be added those due to\n      malfunctioning hardware, defective software and\
    \ operator mistakes,\n      as well as random errors in the mechanism used to\
    \ set and\n      synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model\
    \ and\n      algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples\n\
    \      measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in\n   \

    \ (BOOTP)\n      This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which\n\
    \      allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address,\n    \
    \  the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded\n      into\
    \ memory and executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought\n      of as consisting\
    \ of TWO PHASES.  This RFC describes the first\n      phase, which could be labeled\
    \ `address determination and bootfile\n      selection'.  After this address and\
    \ filename information is\n      obtained, control passes to the second phase\
    \ of the bootstrap\n      where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will\
    \ typically\n      use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases\n\
    \      reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with\n   \
    \   other protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed\n     \

    \               Scheme\n      There have been several proposals for schemes to\
    \ allow the use of\n      a single Internet network number to refer to a collection\
    \ of\n      physical networks under common administration which are reachable\n\
    \      from the rest of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes\n      allow\
    \ a simplified view of an otherwise complicated topology from\n      hosts and\
    \ gateways outside of this collection.  They allow the\n      complexity of the\
    \ number and  type of these networks, and routing\n      to them, to be localized.\
    \  Additions and changes in configuration\n      thus cause no detectable change,\
    \ and no interruption of service,\n      due to slow propagation of routing and\
    \ other information outside\n      of the local environment.  These schemes also\
    \ simplify the\n      administration of the network, as changes do not require\n\
    \      allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.\n     \
    \ This proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been\n      in use\
    \ at the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.\n      This RFC\

    \ the need for such communication over an asynchronous link\n      at relatively\
    \ low speeds. The suggested protocol uses the methods\n      of existing national\

    \ RFC proposes an alternative addressing scheme for subnets\n      which, in most\
    \ cases, requires no modification to host software\n      whatsoever.  The drawbacks\
    \ of this scheme are that the total\n      number of subnets in any one network\

    \ and suggestions for\n      improvements.  This is the second draft of this proposal\n\
    \      (superseding RFC 912) and incorporates a more formal description\n    \
    \  of the syntax for the request and response dialog, as well as a\n      change\

    \ terminal type information\n      within the Telnet protocol are expected to\
    \ adopt and implement\n      this standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\
    \  This\n      standard supersedes RFC 884.  The only change is to specify that\n\

    \ Protocol introduced here\n      and described in RFC 929 is the result of the\
    \ deliberations of a\n      number of experienced H-FP designers, who sat as a\
    \ committee of\n      the DoD Protocol Standards Technical Panel.  It is the intent\
    \ of\n      the designers that the protocol be subjected to multiple test\n  \
    \    implementations and probable iteration before being agreed upon as\n    \
    \  any sort of \"standard\".  Therefore, the first order of business is\n    \

    \  It is intended primarily for\n      TAC connections to target hosts on behalf\

    \     Oct 84      Multi-LAN Address Resolution\n      The problem of treating\
    \ a set of local area networks (LANs) as one\n      Internet network has generated\
    \ some interest and concern.  It is\n      inappropriate to give each LAN within\
    \ a site a distinct\n      ARPA-Internet network number.  It is desirable to hide\
    \ the details\n      of the interconnections between the LANs within a site from\n\
    \      people, gateways, and hosts outside the site.  The question arises\n  \
    \    on how to best do this, and even how to do it at all.  In RFC 917,\n    \
    \  Jeffery Mogul makes a case for the use of \"explicit subnets\" in a\n     \
    \ multi-LAN environment.  The explicit subnet scheme is a call to\n      recursively\
    \ apply the mechanisms the ARPA-Internet uses to manage\n      networks to the\
    \ problem of managing LANs within one network.  In\n      this note I urge another\
    \ approach: the use of \"transparent\n      subnets\" supported by a multi-LAN\
    \ extension of the Address\n      Resolution Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed\
    \ protocol for\n      the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and\n\

    \ the current ARPANET\n      host access protocol.  The first change will allow\
    \ hosts to use\n      logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent\
    \ of\n      their physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each\n\
    \      other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of\n    \
    \  time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message\n      to\
    \ the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a\n      host for\
    \ up to 15 seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.\n   801     Postel       Nov 81  \
