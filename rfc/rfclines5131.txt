Abstract This MIB module defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47 language tags.
The intent is that this textual convention will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representation.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
It defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47
The LangTag TEXTUAL CONVENTION defined by this RFC replaces the similar LanguageTag TEXTUAL CONVENTION defined by RFC 2932 [RFC2932].
The old LanguageTag TEXTUAL CONVENTION is used by some existing MIB modules.
New MIB modules should use the LangTag TEXTUAL CONVENTION, which has been created (and is to be preferred) for the following reasons:  Its syntax description is current, and is more comprehensive.
It is short enough to use as an index object without subtyping, yet is of adequate length to represent any language tag in practice.
It is provided in a dedicated MIB module to simplify module dependencies.
It is not possible to apply changes in syntax and length to an existing textual convention.
This is why the creation of a new textual convention with a new name was necessary.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

Home page: http://www.ops.ietf.org/" DESCRIPTION "
This MIB module defines a textual convention for representing BCP 47 language tags."
Initial revision, published as RFC 5131.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 5131; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
Only lowercase characters are allowed.
The purpose of this restriction is to provide unique language tags for use as indexes.
BCP 47 recommends case conventions for user interfaces, but objects using this TEXTUAL CONVENTION MUST use only lowercase.
Values MUST be well formed language tags, in conformance with the definition of well formed tags in BCP 47.
An implementation MAY further limit the values it accepts to those permitted by a 'validating' processor, as defined in BCP 47.
In theory, BCP 47 language tags are of unlimited length.
The language tag described in this TEXTUAL CONVENTION is of limited length.
The analysis of language tag lengths in BCP 47 confirms that this limit will not pose a problem in practice.
In particular, this length is greater than the minimum requirements set out in Section 4.3.1.
A zero length language tag is not a valid language tag.
This can be used to express 'language tag absent' where required, for example, when used as an index field.

OCTET STRING (SIZE (0   2..63))
This MIB module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines a textual convention that may be imported by other MIB modules and used for object definitions.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
This document therefore has no impact on the security of the Internet.
IANA Considerations LANGTAG TC MIB is rooted under the mib 2 subtree.
IANA has assigned { mib 2 165 } to the LANGTAG TC MIB module specified in this document.
