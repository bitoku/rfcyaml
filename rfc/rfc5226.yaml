  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many protocols make use of fields that contain constants\
    \ and other\n   well-known values (e.g., the Protocol field in the IP header [IP]\
    \ or\n   MIME media types [MIME-REG]).  Even after a protocol has been defined\n\
    \   and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., a\n  \
    \ new option type in DHCP [DHCP-OPTIONS] or a new encryption or\n   authentication\
    \ transform for IPsec [IPSEC]).  To ensure that such\n   fields have consistent\
    \ values and interpretations in different\n   implementations, their assignment\
    \ must be administered by a central\n   authority.  For IETF protocols, that role\
    \ is provided by the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [IANA-MOU].\n\
    \   In this document, we call the set of possible values for such a field\n  \
    \ a \"namespace\"; its actual value may be a text string, a number, or\n   another\
    \ kind of value.  The binding or association of a specific\n   value with a particular\
    \ purpose within a namespace is called an\n   assigned number (or assigned value,\
    \ or sometimes a \"code point\",\n   \"protocol constant\", or \"protocol parameter\"\
    ).  Each assignment of a\n   value in a namespace is called a registration.\n\
    \   In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs\n   guidelines\
    \ describing the conditions under which new values should be\n   assigned or when\
    \ (and how) modifications to existing values can be\n   made.  This document provides\
    \ guidelines to authors on what sort of\n   text should be added to their documents\
    \ in order to provide IANA\n   clear guidelines, and it reviews issues that should\
    \ be considered in\n   formulating an appropriate policy for assigning numbers\
    \ to name\n   spaces.\n   Not all namespaces require centralized administration.\
    \  In some\n   cases, it is possible to delegate a namespace in such a way that\n\
    \   further assignments can be made independently and with no further\n   (central)\
    \ coordination.  In the Domain Name System, for example, IANA\n   only deals with\
    \ assignments at the higher levels, while subdomains\n   are administered by the\
    \ organization to which the space has been\n   delegated.  As another example,\
    \ Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined\n   by the ITU are also delegated [ASSIGNED];\
    \ IANA manages the subtree\n   rooted at \"iso.org.dod.internet\" (1.3.6.1) .\
    \  When a namespace is\n   delegated, the scope of IANA is limited to the parts\
    \ of the namespace\n   where IANA has authority.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].\n   For this document, \"the specification\"\
    \ as used by RFC 2119 refers to\n   the processing of protocol documents within\
    \ the IETF standards\n   process.\n"
- title: 2.  Why Management of a Namespace May Be Necessary
  contents:
  - "2.  Why Management of a Namespace May Be Necessary\n   One issue to consider\
    \ in managing a namespace is its size.  If the\n   space is small and limited\
    \ in size, assignments must be made\n   carefully to prevent exhaustion of the\
    \ space.  If the space is\n   essentially unlimited, on the other hand, potential\
    \ exhaustion will\n   probably not be a practical concern at all.  Even when the\
    \ space is\n   essentially unlimited, however, it is usually desirable to have\
    \ at\n   least a minimal review prior to assignment in order to:\n      - prevent\
    \ the hoarding of or unnecessary wasting of values.  For\n        example, if\
    \ the space consists of text strings, it may be\n        desirable to prevent\
    \ entities from obtaining large sets of\n        strings that correspond to desirable\
    \ names (e.g., existing\n        company names).\n      - provide a sanity check\
    \ that the request actually makes sense and\n        is necessary.  Experience\
    \ has shown that some level of minimal\n        review from a subject matter expert\
    \ is useful to prevent\n        assignments in cases where the request is malformed\
    \ or not\n        actually needed (i.e., an existing assignment for an essentially\n\
    \        equivalent service already exists).\n   A second consideration is whether\
    \ it makes sense to delegate the\n   namespace in some manner.  This route should\
    \ be pursued when\n   appropriate, as it lessens the burden on IANA for dealing\
    \ with\n   assignments.\n   A third, and perhaps most important, consideration\
    \ concerns potential\n   impact on the interoperability of unreviewed extensions.\
    \  Proposed\n   protocol extensions generally benefit from community review; indeed,\n\
    \   review is often essential to avoid future interoperability problems\n   [PROTOCOL-EXT].\n\
    \   When the namespace is essentially unlimited and there are no\n   potential\
    \ interoperability issues, assigned numbers can safely be\n   given out to anyone\
    \ without any subjective review.  In such cases,\n   IANA can make assignments\
    \ directly, provided that IANA is given\n   specific instructions on what types\
    \ of requests it should grant, and\n   what information must be provided as part\
    \ of a well-formed request\n   for an assigned number.\n"

- title: 3.1.  The Motivation for Designated Experts
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Motivation for Designated Experts\n   It should be noted that IANA\
    \ does not create or define assignment\n   policy itself; rather, it carries out\
    \ policies that have been defined\n   by others and published in RFCs.  IANA must\
    \ be given a set of\n   guidelines that allow it to make allocation decisions\
    \ with minimal\n   subjectivity and without requiring any technical expertise\
    \ with\n   respect to the protocols that make use of a registry.\n   In many cases,\
    \ some review of prospective allocations is appropriate,\n   and the question\
    \ becomes who should perform the review and what is\n   the purpose of the review.\
    \  One might think that an IETF working\n   group (WG) familiar with the namespace\
    \ at hand should be consulted.\n   In practice, however, WGs eventually disband,\
    \ so they cannot be\n   considered a permanent evaluator.  It is also possible\
    \ for namespaces\n   to be created through individual submission documents, for\
    \ which no\n   WG is ever formed.\n   One way to ensure community review of prospective\
    \ assignments is to\n   have the requester submit a document for publication as\
    \ an RFC.  Such\n   an action helps ensure that the specification is publicly\
    \ and\n   permanently available, and it allows some review of the specification\n\
    \   prior to publication and assignment of the requested code points.\n   This\
    \ is the preferred way of ensuring review, and is particularly\n   important if\
    \ any potential interoperability issues can arise.  For\n   example, some assignments\
    \ are not just assignments, but also involve\n   an element of protocol specification.\
    \  A new option may define fields\n   that need to be parsed and acted on, which\
    \ (if specified poorly) may\n   not fit cleanly with the architecture of other\
    \ options or the base\n   protocols on which they are built.\n   In some cases,\
    \ however, the burden of publishing an RFC in order to\n   get an assignment is\
    \ excessive.  However, it is generally still\n   useful (and sometimes necessary)\
    \ to discuss proposed additions on a\n   mailing list dedicated to the purpose\
    \ (e.g., the ietf-types@iana.org\n   for media types) or on a more general mailing\
    \ list (e.g., that of a\n   current or former IETF WG).  Such a mailing list provides\
    \ a way for\n   new registrations to be publicly reviewed prior to getting assigned,\n\
    \   or gives advice to persons wanting help in understanding what a\n   proper\
    \ registration should contain.\n   While discussion on a mailing list can provide\
    \ valuable technical\n   feedback, opinions may vary and discussions may continue\
    \ for some\n   time without clear resolution.  In addition, IANA cannot participate\n\
    \   in all of these mailing lists and cannot determine if or when such\n   discussions\
    \ reach consensus.  Therefore, IANA relies on a \"designated\n   expert\" for\
    \ advice regarding the specific question of whether an\n   assignment should be\
    \ made.  The designated expert is an individual\n   who is responsible for carrying\
    \ out an appropriate evaluation and\n   returning a recommendation to IANA.\n\
    \   It should be noted that a key motivation for having designated\n   experts\
    \ is for the IETF to provide IANA with a subject matter expert\n   to whom the\
    \ evaluation process can be delegated.  IANA forwards\n   requests for an assignment\
    \ to the expert for evaluation, and the\n   expert (after performing the evaluation)\
    \ informs IANA as to whether\n   or not to make the assignment or registration.\n"
- title: 3.2.  The Role of the Designated Expert
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The Role of the Designated Expert\n   The designated expert is responsible\
    \ for initiating and coordinating\n   the appropriate review of an assignment\
    \ request.  The review may be\n   wide or narrow, depending on the situation and\
    \ the judgment of the\n   designated expert.  This may involve consultation with\
    \ a set of\n   technology experts, discussion on a public mailing list, consultation\n\
    \   with a working group (or its mailing list if the working group has\n   disbanded),\
    \ etc.  Ideally, the designated expert follows specific\n   review criteria as\
    \ documented with the protocol that creates or uses\n   the namespace.  (See the\
    \ IANA Considerations sections of [RFC3748]\n   and [RFC3575] for examples that\
    \ have been done for specific\n   namespaces.)\n   Designated experts are expected\
    \ to be able to defend their decisions\n   to the IETF community, and the evaluation\
    \ process is not intended to\n   be secretive or bestow unquestioned power on\
    \ the expert.  Experts are\n   expected to apply applicable documented review\
    \ or vetting procedures,\n   or in the absence of documented criteria, follow\
    \ generally accepted\n   norms, e.g., those in Section 3.3.\n   Section 5.2 discusses\
    \ disputes and appeals in more detail.\n   Designated experts are appointed by\
    \ the IESG (normally upon\n   recommendation by the relevant Area Director). \
    \ They are typically\n   named at the time a document creating or updating a namespace\
    \ is\n   approved by the IESG, but as experts originally appointed may later\n\
    \   become unavailable, the IESG will appoint replacements if necessary.\n   For\
    \ some registries, it has proven useful to have multiple designated\n   experts.\
    \  Sometimes those experts work together in evaluating a\n   request, while in\
    \ other cases additional experts serve as backups.\n   In cases of disagreement\
    \ among those experts, it is the\n   responsibility of those experts to make a\
    \ single clear recommendation\n   to IANA.  It is not appropriate for IANA to\
    \ resolve disputes among\n   experts.  In extreme situations (e.g., deadlock),\
    \ the IESG may need\n   to step in to resolve the problem.\n   In registries where\
    \ a pool of experts evaluates requests, the pool\n   should have a single chair\
    \ responsible for defining how requests are\n   to be assigned to and reviewed\
    \ by experts.  In some cases, the expert\n   pool may consist of a primary and\
    \ backups, with the backups involved\n   only when the primary expert is unavailable.\
    \  In other cases, IANA\n   might assign requests to individual members in sequential\
    \ or\n   approximate random order.  In the event that IANA finds itself having\n\
    \   received conflicting advice from its experts, it is the\n   responsibility\
    \ of the pool's chair to resolve the issue and provide\n   IANA with clear instructions.\n\
    \   Since the designated experts are appointed by the IESG, they may be\n   removed\
    \ by the IESG.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Designated Expert Reviews
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Designated Expert Reviews\n   In the eight years since RFC 2434 was published\
    \ and has been put to\n   use, experience has led to the following observations:\n\
    \      - A designated expert must respond in a timely fashion, normally\n    \
    \    within a week for simple requests to a few weeks for more\n        complex\
    \ ones.  Unreasonable delays can cause significant\n        problems for those\
    \ needing assignments, such as when products\n        need code points to ship.\
    \  This is not to say that all reviews\n        can be completed under a firm\
    \ deadline, but they must be\n        started, and the requester and IANA should\
    \ have some\n        transparency into the process if an answer cannot be given\n\
    \        quickly.\n      - If a designated expert does not respond to IANA's requests\n\
    \        within a reasonable period of time, either with a response or\n     \
    \   with a reasonable explanation for the delay (e.g., some requests\n       \
    \ may be particularly complex), and if this is a recurring event,\n        IANA\
    \ must raise the issue with the IESG.  Because of the\n        problems caused\
    \ by delayed evaluations and assignments, the IESG\n        should take appropriate\
    \ actions to ensure that the expert\n        understands and accepts his or her\
    \ responsibilities, or appoint\n        a new expert.\n      - The designated\
    \ expert is not required to personally bear the\n        burden of evaluating\
    \ and deciding all requests, but acts as a\n        shepherd for the request,\
    \ enlisting the help of others as\n        appropriate.  In the case that a request\
    \ is denied, and\n        rejecting the request is likely to be controversial,\
    \ the expert\n        should have the support of other subject matter experts.\
    \  That\n        is, the expert must be able to defend a decision to the\n   \
    \     community as a whole.\n   In the case where a designated expert is used,\
    \ but there are no\n   specific documented criteria for performing an evaluation,\
    \ the\n   presumption should be that a code point should be granted, unless\n\
    \   there is a compelling reason to the contrary.  Possible reasons to\n   deny\
    \ a request include:\n      - scarcity of code points, where the finite remaining\
    \ code points\n        should be prudently managed, or when a request for a large\n\
    \        number of code points is made, when a single code point is the\n    \
    \    norm.\n      - documentation is not of sufficient clarity to evaluate or\
    \ ensure\n        interoperability.\n      - the code point is needed for a protocol\
    \ extension, but the\n        extension is not consistent with the documented\
    \ (or generally\n        understood) architecture of the base protocol being extended,\n\
    \        and would be harmful to the protocol if widely deployed.  It is\n   \
    \     not the intent that \"inconsistencies\" refer to minor differences\n   \
    \     \"of a personal preference nature\".  Instead, they refer to\n        significant\
    \ differences such as inconsistencies with the\n        underlying security model,\
    \ implying a change to the semantics of\n        an existing message type or operation,\
    \ requiring unwarranted\n        changes in deployed systems (compared with alternate\
    \ ways of\n        achieving a similar result), etc.\n      - the extension would\
    \ cause problems with existing deployed\n        systems.\n      - the extension\
    \ would conflict with one under active development\n        by the IETF, and having\
    \ both would harm rather than foster\n        interoperability.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Well-Known IANA Policy Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Well-Known IANA Policy Definitions\n   The following are some defined policies,\
    \ some of which are in use\n   today.  These cover a range of typical policies\
    \ that have been used\n   to date to describe the procedure for assigning new\
    \ values in a\n   namespace.  It is not required that documents use these terms;\
    \ the\n   actual requirement is that the instructions to IANA are clear and\n\
    \   unambiguous.  However, use of these terms is RECOMMENDED where\n   possible,\
    \ since their meaning is widely understood.\n      Private Use - For private or\
    \ local use only, with the type and\n            purpose defined by the local\
    \ site.  No attempt is made to\n            prevent multiple sites from using\
    \ the same value in\n            different (and incompatible) ways.  There is\
    \ no need for\n            IANA to review such assignments (since IANA does not\
    \ record\n            them) and assignments are not generally useful for broad\n\
    \            interoperability.  It is the responsibility of the sites\n      \
    \      making use of the Private Use range to ensure that no\n            conflicts\
    \ occur (within the intended scope of use).\n            Examples: Site-specific\
    \ options in DHCP [DHCP-IANA], Fibre\n            Channel Port Type Registry [RFC4044],\
    \ Exchange Types in the\n            IKEv2 header [RFC4306].\n      Experimental\
    \ Use - Similar to private or local use only, with the\n            purpose being\
    \ to facilitate experimentation.  See\n            [EXPERIMENTATION] for details.\n\
    \            Example: Experimental Values in IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6,\n   \
    \         UDP, and TCP Headers [RFC4727].\n      Hierarchical Allocation - Delegated\
    \ managers can assign values\n            provided they have been given control\
    \ over that part of the\n            namespace.  IANA controls the higher levels\
    \ of the namespace\n            according to one of the other policies.\n    \
    \        Examples: DNS names, Object Identifiers, IP addresses.\n      First Come\
    \ First Served - Assignments are made to anyone on a\n            first come,\
    \ first served basis.  There is no substantive\n            review of the request,\
    \ other than to ensure that it is\n            well-formed and doesn't duplicate\
    \ an existing assignment.\n            However, requests must include a minimal\
    \ amount of clerical\n            information, such as a point of contact (including\
    \ an email\n            address) and a brief description of how the value will\
    \ be\n            used.  Additional information specific to the type of value\n\
    \            requested may also need to be provided, as defined by the\n     \
    \       namespace.  For numbers, the exact value is generally\n            assigned\
    \ by IANA; with names, specific text strings can\n            usually be requested.\n\
    \            Examples: SASL mechanism names [RFC4422], LDAP Protocol\n       \
    \     Mechanisms, and LDAP Syntax [RFC4520].\n      Expert Review (or Designated\

    \ documentation and review\n            criteria for use by the Designated Expert\
    \ should be provided\n            when defining the registry.  For example, see\
    \ Sections 6 and\n            7.2 in [RFC3748].\n            Examples: EAP Method\
    \ Types [RFC3748], HTTP Digest AKA\n            algorithm versions [RFC4169],\
    \ URI schemes [RFC4395], GEOPRIV\n            Location Types [RFC4589].\n    \
    \  Specification Required - Values and their meanings must be\n            documented\
    \ in a permanent and readily available public\n            specification, in sufficient\
    \ detail so that interoperability\n            between independent implementations\
    \ is possible.  When used,\n            Specification Required also implies use\
    \ of a Designated\n            Expert, who will review the public specification\
    \ and\n            evaluate whether it is sufficiently clear to allow\n      \
    \      interoperable implementations.  The intention behind\n            \"permanent\
    \ and readily available\" is that a document can\n            reasonably be expected\
    \ to be findable and retrievable long\n            after IANA assignment of the\
    \ requested value.  Publication\n            of an RFC is an ideal means of achieving\
    \ this requirement,\n            but Specification Required is intended to also\
    \ cover the\n            case of a document published outside of the RFC path.\
    \  For\n            RFC publication, the normal RFC review process is expected\n\
    \            to provide the necessary review for interoperability, though\n  \
    \          the Designated Expert may be a particularly well-qualified\n      \
    \      person to perform such a review.\n            Examples: Diffserv-aware\
    \ TE Bandwidth Constraints Model\n            Identifiers [RFC4124], TLS ClientCertificateType\
    \ Identifiers\n            [RFC4346], ROHC Profile Identifiers [RFC4995].\n  \
    \    RFC Required - RFC publication (either as an IETF submission or as\n    \
    \        an RFC Editor Independent submission [RFC3932]) suffices.\n         \
    \   Unless otherwise specified, any type of RFC is sufficient\n            (e.g.,\
    \ Informational, Experimental, Standards Track, etc.).\n      IETF Review - (Formerly\

    \ the IESG as AD-\n            Sponsored or IETF WG Documents [RFC3932] [RFC3978].\
    \  The\n            intention is that the document and proposed assignment will\n\
    \            be reviewed by the IESG and appropriate IETF WGs (or\n          \
    \  experts, if suitable working groups no longer exist) to\n            ensure\
    \ that the proposed assignment will not negatively\n            impact interoperability\
    \ or otherwise extend IETF protocols\n            in an inappropriate or damaging\
    \ manner.\n            To ensure adequate community review, such documents are\n\
    \            shepherded through the IESG as AD-sponsored (or WG)\n           \
    \ documents with an IETF Last Call.\n            Examples: IPSECKEY Algorithm\
    \ Types [RFC4025],\n            Accounting-Auth-Method AVP values in DIAMETER\
    \ [RFC4005], TLS\n            Handshake Hello Extensions [RFC4366].\n      Standards\
    \ Action - Values are assigned only for Standards Track\n            RFCs approved\
    \ by the IESG.\n            Examples: BGP message types [RFC4271], Mobile Node\n\
    \            Identifier option types [RFC4283], DCCP Packet Types\n          \
    \  [RFC4340].\n      IESG Approval - New assignments may be approved by the IESG.\n\
    \            Although there is no requirement that the request be\n          \
    \  documented in an RFC, the IESG has discretion to request\n            documents\
    \ or other supporting materials on a case-by-case\n            basis.\n      \
    \      IESG Approval is not intended to be used often or as a\n            \"\
    common case\"; indeed, it has seldom been used in practice\n            during\
    \ the period RFC 2434 was in effect.  Rather, it is\n            intended to be\
    \ available in conjunction with other policies\n            as a fall-back mechanism\
    \ in the case where one of the other\n            allowable approval mechanisms\
    \ cannot be employed in a timely\n            fashion or for some other compelling\
    \ reason.  IESG Approval\n            is not intended to circumvent the public\
    \ review processes\n            implied by other policies that could have been\
    \ employed for\n            a particular assignment.  IESG Approval would be\n\
    \            appropriate, however, in cases where expediency is desired\n    \
    \        and there is strong consensus for making the assignment\n           \
    \ (e.g., WG consensus).\n            The following guidelines are suggested for\
    \ any evaluation\n            under IESG Approval:\n            - The IESG can\
    \ (and should) reject a request if another path\n              for registration\
    \ is available that is more appropriate and\n              there is no compelling\
    \ reason to use that path.\n            - Before approving a request, the community\
    \ should be\n              consulted, via a \"call for comments\" that provides\
    \ as much\n              information as is reasonably possible about the request.\n\
    \            Examples: IPv4 Multicast address assignments [RFC3171], IPv4\n  \
    \          IGMP Type and Code values [RFC3228], Mobile IPv6 Mobility\n       \
    \     Header Type and Option values [RFC3775].\n   It should be noted that it\
    \ often makes sense to partition a namespace\n   into multiple categories, with\
    \ assignments within each category\n   handled differently.  For example, many\
    \ protocols now partition\n   namespaces into two (or even more) parts, where\
    \ one range is reserved\n   for Private or Experimental Use, while other ranges\
    \ are reserved for\n   globally unique assignments assigned following some review\
    \ process.\n   Dividing a namespace into ranges makes it possible to have different\n\
    \   policies in place for different ranges.\n   Examples:  LDAP [RFC4520], Pseudowire\
    \ Edge to Edge Emulation (PWE3)\n   [RFC4446].\n"
- title: 4.2.  What to Put in Documents That Create a Registry
  contents:
  - "4.2.  What to Put in Documents That Create a Registry\n   The previous sections\
    \ presented some issues that should be considered\n   in formulating a policy\
    \ for assigning values in namespaces.  It is\n   the working group and/or document\
    \ author's job to formulate an\n   appropriate policy and specify it in the appropriate\
    \ document.  In\n   almost all cases, having an explicit \"IANA Considerations\"\
    \ section is\n   appropriate.  The following and later sections define what is\
    \ needed\n   for the different types of IANA actions.\n   Documents that create\
    \ a new namespace (or modify the definition of an\n   existing space) and that\
    \ expect IANA to play a role in maintaining\n   that space (e.g., serving as a\
    \ repository for registered values) MUST\n   provide clear instructions on details\
    \ of the namespace.  In\n   particular, instructions MUST include:\n      1) The\
    \ name of the registry (or sub-registry) being created and/or\n         maintained.\
    \  The name will appear on the IANA web page and will\n         be referred to\
    \ in future documents that need to allocate a\n         value from the new space.\
    \  The full name (and abbreviation, if\n         appropriate) should be provided.\
    \  It is highly desirable that\n         the chosen name not be easily confusable\
    \ with the name of\n         another registry.  When creating a sub-registry,\
    \ the registry\n         that it is a part of should be clearly identified.  When\n\
    \         referring to an already existing registry, providing a URL to\n    \
    \     precisely identify the registry is helpful.  All such URLs,\n         however,\
    \ will be removed from the RFC prior to final\n         publication.  For example,\
    \ documents could contain: [TO BE\n         REMOVED: This registration should\
    \ take place at the following\n         location:  http://www.iana.org/assignments/foobar-registry]\n\
    \      2) What information must be provided as part of a request in order\n  \
    \       to assign a new value.  This information may include the need\n      \
    \   to document relevant security considerations, if any.\n      3) The review\
    \ process that will apply to all future requests for a\n         value from the\
    \ namespace.\n         Note: When a Designated Expert is used, documents MUST\
    \ NOT name\n         the Designated Expert in the document itself; instead, the\
    \ name\n         should be relayed to the appropriate Area Director at the time\n\
    \         the document is sent to the IESG for approval.\n         If the request\
    \ should also be reviewed on a specific public\n         mailing list (such as\
    \ the ietf-types@iana.org for media types),\n         that mailing address should\
    \ be specified.  Note, however, that\n         when mailing lists are specified,\
    \ the requirement for a\n         Designated Expert MUST also be specified (see\
    \ Section 3).\n         If IANA is expected to make assignments without requiring\
    \ an\n         outside review, sufficient guidance MUST be provided so that\n\
    \         the requests can be evaluated with minimal subjectivity.\n      4) The\
    \ size, format, and syntax of registry entries.  When\n         creating a new\
    \ name/number space, authors must describe any\n         technical requirements\
    \ on registry (and sub-registry) values\n         (e.g., valid ranges for integers,\
    \ length limitations on\n         strings, etc.) as well as the exact format in\
    \ which registry\n         values should be displayed.  For number assignments,\
    \ one should\n         specify whether values are to be recorded in decimal,\n\
    \         hexadecimal, or some other format.  For strings, the encoding\n    \
    \     format should be specified (e.g., ASCII, UTF8, etc.).  Authors\n       \
    \  should also clearly specify what fields to record in the\n         registry.\n\
    \      5) Initial assignments and reservations.  Clear instructions\n        \
    \ should be provided to identify any initial assignments or\n         registrations.\
    \  In addition, any ranges that are to be reserved\n         for \"Private Use\"\
    , \"Reserved\", \"Unassigned\", etc. should be\n         clearly indicated.\n\
    \   When specifying the process for making future assignments, it is\n   quite\
    \ acceptable to pick one (or more) of the example policies listed\n   in Section\
    \ 4.1 and refer to it by name.  Indeed, this is the\n   preferred mechanism in\
    \ those cases where the sample policies provide\n   the desired level of review.\
    \  It is also acceptable to cite one of\n   the above policies and include additional\
    \ guidelines for what kind of\n   considerations should be taken into account\
    \ by the review process.\n   For example, RADIUS [RFC3575] specifies the use of\
    \ a Designated\n   Expert, but includes specific additional criteria the Designated\n\
    \   Expert should follow.\n   For example, a document could say something like:\n\
    \      This document defines a new DHCP option, entitled \"FooBar\" (see\n   \
    \   Section y), assigned a value of TBD1 from the DHCP Option space\n      [to\
    \ be removed upon publication:\n      http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters]\n\
    \      [DHCP-OPTIONS] [DHCP-IANA]:\n                                     Data\n\

    \          FooBar server\n      The FooBar option also defines an 8-bit FooType\
    \ field, for which\n      IANA is to create and maintain a new sub-registry entitled\n\
    \      \"FooType values\" under the FooBar option.  Initial values for the\n \
    \     DHCP FooBar FooType registry are given below; future assignments\n     \
    \ are to be made through Expert Review [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].\n      Assignments\
    \ consist of a DHCP FooBar FooType name and its\n      associated value.\n   \

- title: 5.1.  What to Put in Documents When Registering Values
  contents:
  - "5.1.  What to Put in Documents When Registering Values\n   Often, documents request\
    \ an assignment from an already existing\n   namespace (i.e., one created by a\
    \ previously published RFC).  In such\n   cases:\n      - Documents should clearly\
    \ identify the namespace in which each\n        value is to be registered.  If\
    \ the registration goes into a\n        sub-registry, the author should clearly\
    \ describe where the\n        assignment or registration should go.  It is helpful\
    \ to use the\n        exact namespace name as listed on the IANA web page (and\n\
    \        defining RFC), and cite the RFC where the namespace is defined.\n   \
    \     Note 1: There is no need to mention what the assignment policy\n       \
    \ for new assignments is, as that should be clear from the\n        references.\n\
    \        Note 2: When referring to an existing registry, providing a URL\n   \
    \     to precisely identify the registry is helpful.  Such URLs,\n        however,\
    \ should usually be removed from the RFC prior to final\n        publication,\
    \ since IANA URLs are not guaranteed to be stable in\n        the future.  In\
    \ cases where it is important to include a URL in\n        the document, IANA\
    \ should concur on its inclusion.\n        As an example, documents could contain:\
    \ [TO BE REMOVED: This\n        registration should take place at the following\
    \ location:\n        http://www.iana.org/assignments/foobar-registry]\n      -\
    \ Each value requested should be given a unique reference.  When\n        the\
    \ value is numeric, use the notation: TBD1, TBD2, etc.\n        Throughout the\
    \ document where an actual IANA-assigned value\n        should be filled in, use\
    \ the \"TBDx\" notation.  This helps ensure\n        that the final RFC has the\
    \ correct assigned values inserted in\n        all of the relevant places where\
    \ the value is expected to appear\n        in the final document.  For values\
    \ that are text strings, a\n        specific name can be suggested.  IANA will\
    \ normally assign the\n        name, unless it conflicts with a name already in\
    \ use.\n      - Normally, the values to be used are chosen by IANA and documents\n\
    \        should specify values of \"TBD\".  However, in some cases, a value\n\
    \        may have been used for testing or in early implementations.  In\n   \
    \     such cases, it is acceptable to include text suggesting what\n        specific\
    \ value should be used (together with the reason for the\n        choice).  For\
    \ example, one might include the text \"the value XXX\n        is suggested as\
    \ it is used in implementations\".  However, it\n        should be noted that\
    \ suggested values are just that; IANA will\n        attempt to assign them, but\
    \ may find that impossible, if the\n        proposed number has already been assigned\
    \ for some other use.\n        For some registries, IANA has a long-standing policy\
    \ prohibiting\n        assignment of names or codes on a vanity or organization\
    \ name\n        basis, e.g., codes are always assigned sequentially unless there\n\
    \        is a strong reason for making an exception.  Nothing in this\n      \
    \  document is intended to change those policies or prevent their\n        future\
    \ application.\n      - The IANA Considerations section should summarize all of\
    \ the IANA\n        actions, with pointers to the relevant sections elsewhere\
    \ in the\n        document as appropriate.  When multiple values are requested,\
    \ it\n        is generally helpful to include a summary table.  It is also\n \
    \       helpful for this table to be in the same format as it should\n       \
    \ appear on the IANA web site.  For example:\n            Value     Description\
    \          Reference\n            --------  -------------------  ---------\n \
    \           TBD1      Foobar               [RFCXXXX]\n      Note: In cases where\
    \ authors feel that including the full table is\n      too verbose or repetitive,\
    \ authors should still include the table,\n      but may include a note asking\
    \ that the table be removed prior to\n      publication of the final RFC.\n  \
    \ As an example, the following text could be used to request assignment\n   of\
    \ a DHCPv6 option number:\n      IANA has assigned an option code value of TBD1\
    \ to the DNS\n      Recursive Name Server option and an option code value of TBD2\
    \ to\n      the Domain Search List option from the DHCP option code space\n  \
    \    defined in Section 24.3 of RFC 3315.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Updating Registrations
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Updating Registrations\n   Registrations are a request to assign a new\
    \ value, including the\n   related information needed to evaluate and document\
    \ the request.\n   Even after a number has been assigned, some types of registrations\n\
    \   contain additional information that may need to be updated over time.\n  \
    \ For example, MIME media types, character sets, and language tags,\n   etc. typically\
    \ include more information than just the registered\n   value itself.  Example\
    \ information can include point-of-contact\n   information, security issues, pointers\
    \ to updates, literature\n   references, etc.  In such cases, the document defining\
    \ the namespace\n   must clearly state who is responsible for maintaining and\
    \ updating a\n   registration.  In different cases, it may be appropriate to specify\n\
    \   one or more of the following:\n      - Let the author update the registration,\
    \ subject to the same\n        constraints and review as with new registrations.\n\
    \      - Allow some mechanism to attach comments to the registration, for\n  \
    \      cases where others have significant objections to claims in a\n       \
    \ registration, but the author does not agree to change the\n        registration.\n\
    \      - Designate the IESG, a Designated Expert, or another entity as\n     \
    \   having the right to change the registrant associated with a\n        registration\
    \ and any requirements or conditions on doing so.\n        This is mainly to get\
    \ around the problem when a registrant\n        cannot be reached in order to\
    \ make necessary updates.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Overriding Registration Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Overriding Registration Procedures\n   Since RFC 2434 was published, experience\
    \ has shown that the\n   documented IANA considerations for individual protocols\
    \ do not always\n   adequately cover the reality after the protocol is deployed.\
    \  For\n   example, many older routing protocols do not have documented,\n   detailed\
    \ IANA considerations.  In addition, documented IANA\n   considerations are sometimes\
    \ found to be too stringent to allow even\n   working group documents (for which\
    \ there is strong consensus) to\n   obtain code points from IANA in advance of\
    \ actual RFC publication.\n   In other cases, the documented procedures are unclear\
    \ or neglected to\n   cover all the cases.  In order to allow assignments in individual\n\
    \   cases where there is strong IETF consensus that an allocation should\n   go\
    \ forward, but the documented procedures do not support such an\n   assignment,\
    \ the IESG is granted authority to approve assignments in\n   such cases.  The\
    \ intention is not to overrule properly documented\n   procedures, or to obviate\
    \ the need for protocols to properly document\n   their IANA considerations. \
    \ Instead, the intention is to permit\n   assignments in individual cases where\
    \ it is obvious that the\n   assignment should just be made, but updating the\
    \ IANA process just to\n   assign a particular code point is viewed as too heavy\
    \ a burden.\n   In general, the IETF would like to see deficient IANA registration\n\
    \   procedures for a namespace revised through the IETF standards\n   process,\
    \ but not at the cost of unreasonable delay for needed\n   assignments.  If the\
    \ IESG has had to take the action in this section,\n   it is a strong indicator\
    \ that the IANA registration procedures should\n   be updated, possibly in parallel\
    \ with ongoing protocol work.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  When There Are No IANA Actions\n   Before an Internet-Draft can be published\
    \ as an RFC, IANA needs to\n   know what actions (if any) it needs to perform.\
    \  Experience has shown\n   that it is not always immediately obvious whether\
    \ a document has no\n   IANA actions, without reviewing the document in some detail.\
    \  In\n   order to make it clear to IANA that it has no actions to perform (and\n\
    \   that the author has consciously made such a determination), such\n   documents\
    \ should include an IANA Considerations section that states:\n      This document\
    \ has no IANA actions.\n   This statement, or an equivalent, must only be inserted\
    \ after the WG\n   or individual submitter has carefully verified it to be true.\
    \  Using\n   such wording as a matter of \"boilerplate\" or without careful\n\
    \   consideration can lead to incomplete or incorrect IANA actions being\n   performed.\n\
    \   If a specification makes use of values from a namespace that is not\n   managed\
    \ by IANA, it may be useful to note this fact, e.g., with\n   wording such as:\n\
    \      The values of the Foobar parameter are assigned by the Barfoo\n      registry\
    \ on behalf of the Rabfoo Forum.  Therefore, this document\n      has no IANA\
    \ actions.\n   In some cases, the absence of IANA-assigned values may be considered\n\
    \   valuable information for future readers; in other cases, it may be\n   considered\
    \ of no value once the document has been approved, and may\n   be removed before\
    \ archival publication.  This choice should be made\n   clear in the draft, for\
    \ example, by including a sentence such as\n      [RFC Editor: please remove this\
    \ section prior to publication.]\n   or\n      [RFC Editor: please do not remove\
    \ this section.]\n"
- title: 6.2.  Namespaces Lacking Documented Guidance
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Namespaces Lacking Documented Guidance\n   For all existing RFCs that either\
    \ explicitly or implicitly rely on\n   IANA to evaluate assignments without specifying\
    \ a precise evaluation\n   policy, IANA (in consultation with the IESG) will continue\
    \ to decide\n   what policy is appropriate.  Changes to existing policies can\
    \ always\n   be initiated through the normal IETF consensus process.\n   All future\
    \ RFCs that either explicitly or implicitly rely on IANA to\n   register or otherwise\
    \ manage namespace assignments MUST provide\n   guidelines for managing the namespace.\n"
- title: 6.3.  After-the-Fact Registrations
  contents:
  - "6.3.  After-the-Fact Registrations\n   Occasionally, IANA becomes aware that\
    \ an unassigned value from a\n   managed namespace is in use on the Internet or\
    \ that an assigned value\n   is being used for a different purpose than originally\
    \ registered.\n   IANA will not condone such misuse; i.e., procedures of the type\n\
    \   described in this document MUST be applied to such cases.  In the\n   absence\
    \ of specifications to the contrary, values may only be\n   reassigned for a different\
    \ purpose with the consent of the original\n   assignee (when possible) and with\
    \ due consideration of the impact of\n   such a reassignment.  In cases of likely\
    \ controversy, consultation\n   with the IESG is advised.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Reclaiming Assigned Values
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Reclaiming Assigned Values\n   Reclaiming previously assigned values for\
    \ reuse is tricky, because\n   doing so can lead to interoperability problems\
    \ with deployed systems\n   still using the assigned values.  Moreover, it can\
    \ be extremely\n   difficult to determine the extent of deployment of systems\
    \ making use\n   of a particular value.  However, in cases where the namespace\
    \ is\n   running out of unassigned values and additional ones are needed, it\n\
    \   may be desirable to attempt to reclaim unused values.  When\n   reclaiming\
    \ unused values, the following (at a minimum) should be\n   considered:\n    \
    \  - Attempts should be made to contact the original party to which a\n      \
    \  value is assigned, to determine if the value was ever used, and\n        if\
    \ so, the extent of deployment.  (In some cases, products were\n        never\
    \ shipped or have long ceased being used.  In other cases,\n        it may be\
    \ known that a value was never actually used at all.)\n      - Reassignments should\
    \ not normally be made without the\n        concurrence of the original requester.\
    \  Reclamation under such\n        conditions should only take place where there\
    \ is strong evidence\n        that a value is not widely used, and the need to\
    \ reclaim the\n        value outweighs the cost of a hostile reclamation.  In\
    \ any case,\n        IESG Approval is needed in this case.\n      - It may be\
    \ appropriate to write up the proposed action and\n        solicit comments from\
    \ relevant user communities.  In some cases,\n        it may be appropriate to\
    \ write an RFC that goes through a formal\n        IETF process (including IETF\
    \ Last Call) as was done when DHCP\n        reclaimed some of its \"Private Use\"\
    \ options [RFC3942].\n"
- title: 7.  Appeals
  contents:
  - "7.  Appeals\n   Appeals of registration decisions made by IANA can be made using\
    \ the\n   normal IETF appeals process as described in Section 6.5 of\n   [IETF-PROCESS].\
    \  Specifically, appeals should be directed to the\n   IESG, followed (if necessary)\
    \ by an appeal to the IAB, etc.\n"
- title: 8.  Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "8.  Mailing Lists\n   All IETF mailing lists associated with evaluating or discussing\n\
    \   assignment requests as described in this document are subject to\n   whatever\
    \ rules of conduct and methods of list management are\n   currently defined by\
    \ Best Current Practices or by IESG decision.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Information that creates or updates a registration\
    \ needs to be\n   authenticated and authorized.  IANA updates registries according\
    \ to\n   instructions in published RFCs and from the IESG.  It also may accept\n\
    \   clarifications from document authors, relevant WG chairs, Designated\n   Experts,\
    \ and mail list participants, too.\n   Information concerning possible security\
    \ vulnerabilities of a\n   protocol may change over time.  Likewise, security\
    \ vulnerabilities\n   related to how an assigned number is used (e.g., if it identifies\
    \ a\n   protocol) may change as well.  As new vulnerabilities are discovered,\n\
    \   information about such vulnerabilities may need to be attached to\n   existing\
    \ registrations, so that users are not misled as to the true\n   security issues\
    \ surrounding the use of a registered number.\n   An analysis of security issues\
    \ is generally required for all\n   protocols that make use of parameters (data\
    \ types, operation codes,\n   keywords, etc.) used in IETF protocols or registered\
    \ by IANA.  Such\n   security considerations are usually included in the protocol\
    \ document\n   [RFC3552].  It is the responsibility of the IANA considerations\n\
    \   associated with a particular registry to specify what (if any)\n   security\
    \ considerations must be provided when assigning new values,\n   and the process\
    \ for reviewing such claims.\n"
- title: 10.  Changes Relative to RFC 2434
  contents:
  - "10.  Changes Relative to RFC 2434\n   Changes include:\n      - Major reordering\
    \ of text to expand descriptions and to better\n        group topics such as \"\
    updating registries\" vs. \"creating new\n        registries\", in order to make\
    \ it easier for authors to find the\n        text most applicable to their needs.\n\
    \      - Numerous editorial changes to improve readability.\n      - Changed the\
    \ term \"IETF Consensus\" to \"IETF Review\" and added\n        more clarifications.\
    \  History has shown that people see the\n        words \"IETF Consensus\" (without\
    \ consulting the actual\n        definition) and are quick to make incorrect assumptions\
    \ about\n        what the term means in the context of IANA Considerations.\n\
    \      - Added \"RFC Required\" to list of defined policies.\n      - Much more\
    \ explicit directions and examples of \"what to put in\n        RFCs\".\n    \
    \  - \"Specification Required\" now implies use of a Designated Expert\n     \
    \   to evaluate specs for sufficient clarity.\n      - Significantly changed the\
    \ wording in Section 3.  Main purpose is\n        to make clear that Expert Reviewers\
    \ are accountable to the\n        community, and to provide some guidance for\
    \ review criteria in\n        the default case.\n      - Changed wording to remove\
    \ any special appeals path.  The normal\n        RFC 2026 appeals path is used.\n\
    \      - Added a section about reclaiming unused value.\n      - Added a section\
    \ on after-the-fact registrations.\n      - Added a section indicating that mailing\
    \ lists used to evaluate\n        possible assignments (e.g., by a Designated\
    \ Expert) are subject\n        to normal IETF rules.\n"
