  - "1.0 Introduction\n   This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses\
    \ to be\n   used in testing IPv6 prototype software.  These addresses are\n  \
    \ temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.  Any IPv6 system using\n   these\
    \ addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.\n   These addresses\
    \ will not to be routable in the Internet other than\n   for IPv6 testing.\n \
    \  The addresses described in this document are consistent with the IPv6\n   Addressing\
    \ Architecture [ARCH].  They may be assigned to nodes\n   manually, with IPv6\
    \ Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for\n   IPv6 [DHCPv6].\n"
- title: 2.0 Address Format
  contents:
  - "2.0 Address Format\n   The address format for the IPv6 test address is consistent\
    \ with the\n   provider-based unicast address allocation [PRVD] which is as follows:\n\
    \   | 3 |  5 bits  |  16 bits | 8 |   24 bits  | 8 |    64 bits     |\n   +---+----------+----------+---+------------+---+----------------+\n\
    \   |010|RegistryID|ProviderID|RES|SubscriberID|RES|Intra-Subscriber|\n   +---+----------+----------+---+------------+---+----------------+\n\
    \   The specific allocation of each field of the test address format is\n   as\
    \ follows:\n   | 3 |  5 bits  |  16 bits | 8 |   24 bits  | 8 | 16 bits|48 bits|\n\
    \   +---+----------+----------+---+------------+---+--------+-------+\n   |  \
    \ |          |Autonomous|   |    IPv4    |   | Subnet | Intf. |\n   |010|  11111\
    \   |  System  |RES|   Network  |RES|        |       |\n   |   |          |  Number\
    \  |   |   Address  |   | Address|  ID   |\n   +---+----------+----------+---+------------+---+--------+-------+\n\
    \   where:\n   010\n        This is the Format Prefix used to identify provider-based\n\
    \        unicast addresses.\n   11111\n        This is a Registry ID reserved\
    \ by the IANA.  The initial use of\n        addresses in this Registry ID for\
    \ IPv6 testing is temporary.\n        All users of these addresses will be required\
    \ to renumber at\n        some time in the future.\n   Autonomous System Number\n\
    \        This is the current autonomous system number assigned to the\n      \
    \  provider providing internet service to the an IPv6 testers\n        organization.\
    \  For example for IPv6 testers receiving internet\n        service from BBN Barrnet\
    \ would use autonomous system number 189.\n        This would be coded in the\
    \ autonomous system field of the\n        address as follows:\n             0000\
    \ 0000 1011 1101 (binary)\n        The values for the autonomous system number\
    \ of an organization's\n        provider can be obtained from that provider, or\
    \ can be looked up\n        in the \"whois\" database maintained by the internic.net.\n\
    \   RES\n        This field is reserved and must be set to zero.\n   IPv4 Network\
    \ Address\n        This is based on the current IPv4 routable address for the\n\
    \        subscriber which the interface is connected.  It is formed by\n     \
    \   taking the high order 24 bits of the IPv4 address.  For example\n        for\
    \ an IPv4 address (in IPv4 syntax):\n             IPv4 Address\n             ------------\n\
    \             39.11.22.1\n        the value to put in this field of IPv6 address\
    \ is:\n             IPv4 Format             Hex\n             ------------   \
    \         ------\n             39.11.22                270B16\n        This technique\
    \ for generating values for this field only works\n        for subscribers which\
    \ have IPv4 subscriber prefixes less than\n        equal to 24 bits long.  There\
    \ may be subscribers using IPv4\n        addresses with longer subscriber prefixes,\
    \ but this conflict is\n        expected to be very rare.  Subscribers with subscriber\
    \ prefixes\n        larger than 24 bits should use the remaining bits in the IPv4\n\
    \        prefix as the high order bits in the Subnet Address field.\n   RES\n\
    \        This field is reserved and must be set to zero.\n   Subnet Address\n\
    \        The Subnet ID identifies a specific physical link on which the\n    \
    \    interface is located.  There can be multiple subnets on the same\n      \
    \  physical link.  A specific subnet can not span multiple physical\n        links.\
    \  The assignment of values for this field is left to an\n        individual subscriber.\
    \  One possible algorithm to generate\n        values for this field is to use\
    \ the bits in the IPv4 address\n        which identify the IPv4 subnet.\n   Interface\
    \ ID\n        This is the unique identifier of the interface on the link,\n  \
    \      usually the 48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address of the interface if\n        available.\n"
