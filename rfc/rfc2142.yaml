  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "ABSTRACT\n   This specification enumerates and describes Internet mail addresses\n
    \  (mailbox name @ host reference) to be used when contacting personnel\n   at
    an organization.  Mailbox names are provided for both operations\n   and business
    functions.  Additional mailbox names and aliases are not\n   prohibited, but organizations
    which support email exchanges with the\n   Internet are encouraged to support
    AT LEAST each mailbox name for\n   which the associated function exists within
    the organization.\n"
  title: ABSTRACT
- contents:
  - "1.  RATIONALE AND SCOPE\n   Various Internet documents have specified mailbox
    names to be used\n   when reaching the operators of the new service; for example,
    [RFC822\n   6.3, C.6] requires the presence of a <POSTMASTER@domain> mailbox name\n
    \  on all hosts that have an SMTP server.  Other protocols have defacto\n   standards
    for well known mailbox names, such as <USENET@domain> for\n   NNTP (see [RFC977]),
    and <WEBMASTER@domain> for HTTP (see [HTTP]).\n   Defacto standards also exist
    for well known mailbox names which have\n   nothing to do with a particular protocol,
    e.g., <ABUSE@domain> and\n   <TROUBLE@domain>.\n   The purpose of this memo is
    to aggregate and specify the basic set of\n   mailbox names which organizations
    need to support.  Most\n   organizations do not need to support the full set of
    mailbox names\n   defined here, since not every organization will implement the
    all of\n   the associated services.  However, if a given service is offerred,\n
    \  then the associated mailbox name(es) must be supported, resulting in\n   delivery
    to a recipient appropriate for the referenced service or\n   role.\n   If a host
    is not configured to accept mail directly, but it\n   implements a service for
    which this specification defines a mailbox\n   name, that host must have an MX
    RR set (see [RFC974]) and the mail\n   exchangers specified by this RR set must
    recognize the referenced\n   host's domain name as \"local\" for the purpose of
    accepting mail bound\n   for the defined mailbox name.  Note that this is true
    even if the\n   advertised domain name is not the same as the host's domain name;
    for\n   example, if an NNTP server's host name is DATA.RAMONA.VIX.COM yet it\n
    \  advertises the domain name VIX.COM in its \"Path:\" headers, then mail\n   must
    be deliverable to both <USENET@VIX.COM> and\n   <USENET@DATA.RAMONA.VIX.COM>,
    even though these addresses might be\n   delivered to different final destinations.\n
    \  The scope of a well known mailbox name is its domain name.  Servers\n   accepting
    mail on behalf of a domain must accept and correctly\n   process mailbox names
    for that domain, even if the server, itself,\n   does not support the associated
    service.  So, for example, if an NNTP\n   server advertises the organization's
    top level domain in \"Path:\"\n   headers (see [RFC977]) the mail exchangers for
    that top level domain\n   must accept mail to <USENET@domain> even if the mail
    exchanger hosts\n   do not, themselves, serve the NNTP protocol.\n"
  title: 1.  RATIONALE AND SCOPE
- contents:
  - "2.  INVARIANTS\n   For well known names that are not related to specific protocols,
    only\n   the organization's top level domain name are required to be valid.\n
    \  For example, if an Internet service provider's domain name is\n   COMPANY.COM,
    then the <ABUSE@COMPANY.COM> address must be valid and\n   supported, even though
    the customers whose activity generates\n   complaints use hosts with more specific
    domain names like\n   SHELL1.COMPANY.COM.  Note, however, that it is valid and
    encouraged\n   to support mailbox names for sub-domains, as appropriate.\n   Mailbox
    names must be recognized independent of character case.  For\n   example, POSTMASTER,
    postmaster, Postmaster, PostMaster, and even\n   PoStMaStEr are to be treated
    the same, with delivery to the same\n   mailbox.\n   Implementations of these
    well known names need to take account of the\n   expectations of the senders who
    will use them.  Sending back an\n   automatic mail acknowledgement is usually
    helpful (though we suggest\n   caution against the possibility of \"duelling mail
    robots\" and the\n   resulting mail loops).\n"

    mailbox name to which add/drop\n   requests and other meta-queries can be sent.\n
    \  For a mailing list whose submission mailbox name is:\n      <LIST@DOMAIN>\n
    \  there MUST be the administrative mailbox name:\n      <LIST-REQUEST@DOMAIN>\n
    \  Distribution List management software, such as MajorDomo and\n   Listserv,
    also have a single mailbox name associated with the\n   software on that system
    -- usually the name of the software -- rather\n   than a particular list on that
    system.  Use of such mailbox names\n   requires participants to know the type
    of list software employed at\n   the site.  This is problematic.  Consequently:\n
    \     LIST-SPECIFIC (-REQUEST) MAILBOX NAMES ARE REQUIRED,\n      INDEPENDENT
    OF THE AVAILABILITY OF GENERIC LIST SOFTWARE\n      MAILBOX NAMES.\n"

    and [RFC1035]), the Start Of\n   Authority record (SOA RR) has a field for specifying
    the mailbox name\n   of the zone's administrator.\n   This field must be a simple
    word without metacharacters (such as \"%\"\n   or \"!\" or \"::\"), and a mail
    alias should be used on the relevant mail\n   exchanger hosts to direct zone administration
    mail to the appropriate\n   mailbox.\n   For simplicity and regularity, it is
    strongly recommended that the\n   well known mailbox name HOSTMASTER always be
    used\n   <HOSTMASTER@domain>.\n"

    System 3557 in the BGP4 (see [RFC1654], [RFC1655] and\n   [RFC1656]).\n   Not
    all Autonomous Systems are registered with all registries,\n   however, and so
    undeliverable mailbox names under this scheme should\n   be treated as an inconvenience
    rather than as an error or a standards\n   violation.\n"
