  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP [RFC6830]) and\
    \ related\n   mechanisms ([RFC6831], [RFC6832], [RFC6833], [RFC6834], [RFC6835],\n\
    \   [RFC6836], [RFC6837]) separate the IP addressing space into two\n   logical\
    \ spaces, the Endpoint Identifier (EID) space and the Routing\n   Locator (RLOC)\
    \ space.  The first space is used to identify\n   communication endpoints, while\
    \ the second is used to locate EIDs in\n   the Internet routing infrastructure\
    \ topology.\n   [RFC7954] requests an IPv6 address block reservation exclusively\
    \ for\n   use as EID prefixes in the LISP experiment.  The rationale, intent,\n\
    \   size, and usage of the EID address block are described in [RFC7954].\n   This\
    \ document proposes a management framework for the registration of\n   EID prefixes\
    \ from that block, allowing the requesting organization\n   exclusive use of those\
    \ EID prefixes limited to the duration of the\n   LISP experiment.\n"

- title: 3.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Terms\n   This document does not introduce any new terms related\

    \   [RFC6834], [RFC6835], [RFC6836], [RFC6837]), but assumes that the\n   reader\
    \ is familiar with the LISP terminology.  [INTRO] provides an\n   introduction\
    \ to the LISP technology, including its terminology.\n"
- title: 4.  EID Prefix Registration Policy
  contents:
  - "4.  EID Prefix Registration Policy\n   The request for registration of EID prefixes\
    \ MUST be done under the\n   following policies:\n   1.  EID prefixes are made\
    \ available in the reserved space on a\n       temporary basis and for experimental\
    \ uses.  The requester of an\n       experimental prefix MUST provide a short\
    \ description of the\n       intended use or experiment that will be carried out\
    \ (see\n       Section 6).  If the prefix will be used for activities not\n  \
    \     documented in the original description, renewal of the\n       registration\
    \ may be denied.\n   2.  EID prefix registrations MUST be renewed on a regular\
    \ basis to\n       ensure their use by active participants in the experiment.\
    \  The\n       registration period is 12 months.  A renewal SHOULD NOT cause a\n\
    \       change in the EID prefix registered in the previous request.  The\n  \
    \     conditions of registration renewal are to be the same as the\n       conditions\
    \ of the first EID prefix registration request.\n   3.  It is preferable that\
    \ EID prefixes whose registrations have\n       expired not be reused.  When an\
    \ EID prefix registration is\n       removed from the registry, then the reuse\
    \ of the EID prefix in a\n       subsequent registration on behalf of a different\
    \ end user should\n       be avoided where possible.  If the considerations of\
    \ overall\n       usage of the EID block prefix requires reuse of a previously\n\
    \       registered EID prefix, then a minimum delay of at least one week\n   \
    \    between removal and subsequent registration SHOULD be applied by\n      \
    \ the registry operator.\n   4.  When the reserved experimental LISP EID block\
    \ expires, all EID\n       prefix registrations expire as well.  The further disposition\
    \ of\n       these prefixes and the associated registry entries are to be\n  \
    \     specified in the announcement of the cessation of this\n       experiment.\n"
- title: 5.  EID Prefixes Registration Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  EID Prefixes Registration Requirements\n   All EID prefix registrations MUST\
    \ satisfy the following requirements:\n   1.  All EID prefix registrations MUST\
    \ use a globally unique EID\n       prefix.\n   2.  The EID prefix registration\
    \ information, as specified in\n       Section 6, MUST be collected upon initial\
    \ registration and\n       renewal, and made publicly available through interfaces\
    \ allowing\n       both the retrieval of specific registration details (search)\
    \ and\n       the enumeration of the entire registry contents (e.g., RDAP\n  \
    \     ([RFC7481]), WHOIS, HTTP, or similar access methods).\n   3.  The registry\
    \ operator MUST permit the delegation of EID prefixes\n       in the reverse DNS\
    \ space to holders of registered EID prefixes.\n   4.  Anyone can obtain an entry\
    \ in the EID prefix registry, on the\n       understanding that the prefix so\
    \ registered is for the exclusive\n       use in the LISP experimental network,\
    \ and that their registration\n       details (as specified in Section 6) are\
    \ openly published in the\n       EID prefix registry.\n"
- title: 6.  EID Prefix Request Template
  contents:
  - "6.  EID Prefix Request Template\n   The following is a basic request template\
    \ for prefix registration to\n   ensure a uniform process.  This template is inspired\
    \ by IANA's online\n   \"Private Enterprise Number (PEN) Request\" form\n   <http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page>.\n\
    \   Note that all details in this registration become part of the\n   registry\
    \ and will be published in the LISP EID Prefix Registry\n   managed by RIPE NCC.\n\
    \   The EID Prefix Request template MUST at a minimum contain:\n   1.  Organization\
    \ (In the case of individuals requesting an EID\n       prefix, this section can\
    \ be left empty)\n       (a)  Organization Name\n       (b)  Organization Address\n\

    \         +  All registrations may be renewed by the applicant for\n         \
    \   further 12-month periods, ending on August 2019.\n         +  According to\
    \ the 3+3 year experimentation plan, defined in\n            [RFC7954], all registrations\
    \ MUST end by August 2019, unless\n            the IETF community decides to grant\
    \ a permanent LISP EID\n            address block.  In the latter case, registrations\
    \ following\n            the present document policy MUST end by August 2022 and\
    \ a\n            new policy (to be decided -- see Section 7) will apply\n    \
    \        thereafter.\n   4.  Experiment Description\n       (a)  Experiment and\

    \ if necessary)\n"
- title: 7.  Policy Validity Period
  contents:
  - "7.  Policy Validity Period\n   The policy outlined in the present document is\
    \ tied to the existence\n   of the experimental LISP EID block requested in [RFC7954]\
    \ and is\n   valid until August 2019.\n   If the IETF decides to transform the\
    \ block into a permanent\n   allocation, the usage period reserved for the LISP\
    \ EID block will be\n   extended for three years (until August 2022) to allow\
    \ time for the\n   IETF to define, following the policies outlined in [RFC5226],\
    \ the\n   final size of the EID block and create a transition plan, while the\n\
    \   policy in the present document will still apply.\n   Note that, as stated\
    \ in [RFC7954], the transition of the EID block\n   into a permanent allocation\
    \ has the potential to pose policy issues\n   (as recognized in [RFC2860], Section\
    \ 4.3); hence, discussion with the\n   IANA, the Regional Internet Registry (RIR)\
    \ communities, and the IETF\n   community will be necessary to determine the appropriate\
    \ policy for\n   permanent EID prefix management, which will be effective after\
    \ August\n   2022.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce new security\
    \ threats in the LISP\n   architecture nor in the Legacy Internet architecture.\n\
    \   For accountability reasons and in line with the security\n   considerations\
    \ in [RFC7020], each registration request MUST contain\n   accurate information\
    \ about the requesting entity (company,\n   institution, individual, etc.) and\
    \ valid and accurate contact\n   information of a referral person (see Section\
    \ 6).\n"
- title: 9.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA allocated the following IPv6 address block for\
    \ experimental use\n   as the LISP EID prefix [RFC7954]:\n   o  Address Block:\
    \ 2001:5::/32\n   o  Name: EID Space for LISP\n   o  RFC: [RFC7954]\n   o  Further\
    \ details are at: www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-\n      special-registry\n\
    \   To grant requesting organizations and individuals exclusive use of\n   EID\
    \ prefixes out of this reserved block (limited to the duration of\n   the LISP\
    \ experiment as outlined in Section 7), there is an\n   operational requirement\
    \ for an EID registration service.\n   Provided that the policies and requirements\
    \ outlined in Sections 4,\n   5, and 6 are satisfied, EID prefix registration\
    \ is accorded based on\n   a \"First Come First Served\" basis.\n   There is no\
    \ hard limit to the number of registrations an organization\n   or individual\
    \ can submit, as long as the information described in\n   Section 6 is provided,\
    \ in particular point 4: \"Experiment\n   Description\".\n   For the duration\
    \ defined in [RFC7954], RIPE NCC will manage the LISP\n   EID prefix as described\
    \ herein.  Therefore, this document has no IANA\n   actions.\n"
- title: 10.  Procedures to be Followed by RIPE NCC
  contents:
  - "10.  Procedures to be Followed by RIPE NCC\n   RIPE NCC will provide the registration\
    \ service following the EID\n   Prefix Registration Policy (Section 4) and the\
    \ EID Prefix\n   Registration Requirements (Section 5) provided in this document.\
    \  The\n   request form provided by RIPE NCC will include at least the\n   information\
    \ from the template in Section 6.  RIPE NCC will make all\n   received requests\
    \ publicly available.  While this document does not\n   suggest any minimum allocation\
    \ size; RIPE NCC is allowed to introduce\n   such a minimum size for management\
