  - "1.  Introduction\n   A requirement for the development of a common control plane\
    \ for both\n   optical and electronic switching equipment is that there must be\n\
    \   signaling, routing, and link management mechanisms that support data\n   plane\
    \ fault recovery.  In this document, the term \"recovery\" is\n   generically\
    \ used to denote both protection and restoration; the\n   specific terms \"protection\"\
    \ and \"restoration\" are used only when\n   differentiation is required.  The\
    \ subtle distinction between\n   protection and restoration is made based on the\
    \ resource allocation\n   done during the recovery period (see [RFC4427]).\n \
    \  A label-switched path (LSP) may be subject to local (span), segment,\n   and/or\
    \ end-to-end recovery.  Local span protection refers to the\n   protection of\
    \ the link (and hence all the LSPs marked as required for\n   span protection\
    \ and routed over the link) between two neighboring\n   switches.  Segment protection\
    \ refers to the recovery of an LSP\n   segment (i.e., an SNC in the ITU-T terminology)\
    \ between two nodes,\n   i.e., the boundary nodes of the segment.  End-to-end\
    \ protection\n   refers to the protection of an entire LSP from the ingress to\
    \ the\n   egress port.  The end-to-end recovery models discussed in this\n   document\
    \ apply to segment protection where the source and destination\n   refer to the\
    \ protected segment rather than the entire LSP.  Multiple\n   recovery levels\
    \ may be used concurrently by a single LSP for added\n   resiliency; however,\
    \ the interaction between levels affects any one\n   direction of the LSP results\
    \ in both directions of the LSP being\n   switched to a new span, segment, or\
    \ end-to-end path.\n   Unless otherwise stated, all references to \"link\" in\
    \ this document\n   indicate a bi-directional link (which may be realized as a\
    \ pair of\n   unidirectional links).\n   Consider the control plane message flow\
    \ during the establishment of\n   an LSP.  This message flow proceeds from an\
    \ initiating (or source)\n   node to a terminating (or destination) node, via\
    \ a sequence of\n   intermediate nodes.  A node along the LSP is said to be \"\
    upstream\"\n   from another node if the former occurs first in the sequence. \
    \ The\n   latter node is said to be \"downstream\" from the former node.  That\n\
    \   is, an \"upstream\" node is closer to the initiating node than a node\n  \
    \ further \"downstream\".  Unless otherwise stated, all references to\n   \"upstream\"\
    \ and \"downstream\" are in terms of the control plane message\n   flow.\n   The\
    \ flow of the data traffic is defined from ingress (source node) to\n   egress\
    \ (destination node).  Note that for bi-directional LSPs, there\n   are two different\
    \ data plane flows, one for each direction of the\n   LSP.  This document presents\
    \ a protocol functional description to\n   support Generalized Multi-Protocol\
    \ Label Switching (GMPLS)-based\n   recovery (i.e., protection and restoration).\
    \  Protocol-specific\n   formats, encoding, and mechanisms will be described in\
    \ companion\n   documents.\n"

- title: 2.  Span Protection
  contents:
  - "2.  Span Protection\n   Consider a (working) link i between two nodes A and B.\
    \  There are two\n   fundamental models for span protection.  The first is referred\
    \ to as\n   1+1 protection.  Under this model, a dedicated link j is pre-assigned\n\
    \   to protect link i.  LSP traffic is permanently bridged onto both\n   links\
    \ i and j at the ingress node, and the egress node selects the\n   signal (i.e.,\
    \ normal traffic) from i or j, based on a selection\n   function (e.g., signal\
    \ quality).  Under unidirectional 1+1 span\n   protection (Section 2.1), each\
    \ node A and B acts autonomously to\n   select the signal from the working link\
    \ i or the protection link j.\n   Under bi-directional 1+1 span protection (Section\
    \ 2.2) the two nodes\n   A and B coordinate the selection function such that they\
    \ select the\n   signal from the same link, i or j.\n   Under the second model,\
    \ a set of N working links are protected by a\n   set of M protection links, usually\
    \ with M =< N.  A failure in any of\n   the N working links results in traffic\
    \ being switched to one of the M\n   protection links that is available.  This\
    \ is typically a three-step\n   process: first the data plane failure is detected\
    \ at the egress node\n   and reported (notification), then a protection link is\
    \ selected, and\n   finally, the LSPs on the failed link are moved to the protection\n\
    \   link.  If reversion is supported, a fourth step is included, i.e.,\n   return\
    \ of the traffic to the working link (when the working link has\n   recovered\
    \ from the failure).  In Section 2.3, 1:1 span protection is\n   described.  In\
    \ Section 2.4, M:N span protection is described, where\n   M =< N.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Unidirectional 1+1 Dedicated Protection
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Unidirectional 1+1 Dedicated Protection\n   Suppose a bi-directional LSP\
    \ is routed over link i between two nodes\n   A and B.  Under unidirectional 1+1\
    \ protection, a dedicated link j is\n   pre-assigned to protect the working link\
    \ i.  LSP traffic is\n   permanently bridged on both links at the ingress node,\
    \ and the egress\n   node selects the normal traffic from one of the links, i\
    \ or j.  If a\n   node (A or B) detects a failure of a span, it autonomously invokes\
    \ a\n   process to receive the traffic from the protection span.  Thus, it is\n\
    \   possible that node A selects the signal from link i in the B to A\n   direction\
    \ of the LSP, and node B selects the signal from link j in\n   the A to B direction.\n\
    \   The following functionality is required for 1+1 unidirectional span\n   protection:\n\
    \      o  Routing: A single TE link encompassing both working and\n         protection\
    \ links SHOULD be announced with a Link Protection\n         Type \"Dedicated\
    \ 1+1\", along with the bandwidth parameters for\n         the working link. \
    \ As the resources are consumed/released, the\n         bandwidth parameters of\
    \ the TE link are adjusted accordingly.\n         Encoding of the Link Protection\
    \ Type and bandwidth parameters\n         in IS-IS is specified in [RFC4205].\
    \  Encoding of this\n         information in OSPF is specified in [RFC4203].\n\
    \      o  Signaling: The Link Protection object/TLV SHOULD be used to\n      \
    \   request \"Dedicated 1+1\" link protection for that LSP.  This\n         object/TLV\
    \ is defined in [RFC3471].  If the Link Protection\n         object/TLV is not\
    \ used, link selection is a matter of local\n         policy.  No additional signaling\
    \ is required when a fail-over\n         occurs.\n      o  Link management: Both\
    \ nodes MUST have a consistent view of the\n         link protection association\
    \ for the spans.  This can be done\n         using the Link Management Protocol\
    \ (LMP) [RFC4204], or if LMP\n         is not used, this MUST be configured manually.\n"

- title: 2.3.  Dedicated 1:1 Protection with Extra Traffic
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Dedicated 1:1 Protection with Extra Traffic\n   Consider two adjacent nodes,\
    \ A and B.  Under 1:1 protection, a\n   dedicated link j between A and B is pre-assigned\
    \ to protect working\n   link i.  Link j may be carrying (pre-emptable) Extra\
    \ Traffic.  A\n   failure affecting link i results in the corresponding LSP(s)\
    \ being\n   restored to link j.  Extra Traffic being routed over link j may need\n\
    \   to be pre-empted to accommodate the LSPs that have to be restored.\n   Once\
    \ a fault is isolated/localized, the affected LSP(s) must be moved\n   to the\
    \ protection link.  The process of moving an LSP from a failed\n   (working) link\
    \ to a protection link must be initiated by one of the\n   nodes, A or B.  This\
    \ node is referred to as the \"master\".  The other\n   node is called the \"\
    slave\".  The determination of the master and the\n   slave may be based on configured\
    \ information or protocol specific\n   requirements.\n   The basic steps in dedicated\
    \ 1:1 span protection (ignoring reversion)\n   are as follows:\n      1. If the\
    \ master detects/localizes a link failure event, it\n         invokes a process\
    \ to allocate the protection link to the\n         affected LSP(s).\n      2.\
    \ If the slave detects a link failure event, it informs the\n         master of\
    \ the failure using a failure indication message.  The\n         master then invokes\
    \ the same procedure as (1) to move the LSPs\n         to the protection link.\
    \  If the protection link is carrying\n         Extra Traffic, the slave stops\
    \ using the span for the Extra\n         Traffic.\n      3. Once the span protection\
    \ procedure is invoked in the master, it\n         requests the slave to switch\
    \ the affected LSP(s) to the\n         protection link.  Prior to this, if the\
    \ protection link is\n         carrying Extra Traffic, the master stops using\
    \ the span for\n         this traffic (i.e., the traffic is dropped by the master\
    \ and\n         not forwarded into or out of the protection link).\n      4. The\
    \ slave sends an acknowledgement to the master.  Prior to\n         this, the\
    \ slave stops using the link for Extra Traffic (i.e.,\n         the traffic is\
    \ dropped by the slave and not forwarded into or\n         out of the protection\
    \ link).  It then starts sending the normal\n         traffic on the selected\
    \ protection link.\n      5. When the master receives the acknowledgement, it\
    \ starts sending\n         and receiving the normal traffic over the new link.\
    \  The\n         switchover of the LSPs is thus completed.\n      Note: Although\
    \ this mechanism implies more traffic dropped than\n      necessary, it is preferred\
    \ over possible misconnections during the\n      recovery process.\n   From the\
    \ description above, it is clear that 1:1 span protection may\n   require up to\
    \ three signaling messages for each failed span: a\n   failure indication message,\
    \ an LSP Switchover Request message, and an\n   LSP Switchover Response message.\
    \  Furthermore, it may be possible to\n   switch multiple LSPs from the working\
    \ span to the protection span\n   simultaneously.\n   The following functionality\
    \ is required for dedicated 1:1 span\n   protection:\n      o  Pre-emption MUST\
    \ be supported to accommodate Extra Traffic.\n      o  Routing: A single TE link\
    \ encompassing both working and\n         protection links is announced with a\
    \ Link Protection Type\n         \"Dedicated 1:1\".  If Extra Traffic is supported\
    \ over the\n         protection link, then the bandwidth parameters for the\n\
    \         protection link MUST also be announced.  The differentiation\n     \
    \    between bandwidth for working and protect links is made using\n         priority\
    \ mechanisms.  In other words, the network MUST be\n         configured such that\
    \ bandwidth at priority X or lower is\n         considered Extra Traffic.\n  \
    \       If there is a failure on the working link, then the normal\n         traffic\
    \ is switched to the protection link, pre-empting Extra\n         Traffic if necessary.\
    \  The bandwidth for the protection link\n         MUST be adjusted accordingly.\n\
    \      o  Signaling: To establish an LSP on the working link, the Link\n     \
    \    Protection object/TLV indicating \"Dedicated 1:1\" SHOULD be\n         included\
    \ in the signaling request message for that LSP.  To\n         establish an LSP\
    \ on the protection link, the appropriate\n         priority (indicating Extra\
    \ Traffic) SHOULD be used for that\n         LSP.  These objects/TLVs are defined\
    \ in [RFC3471].  If the Link\n         Protection object/TLV is not used, link\
    \ selection is a matter\n         of local policy.\n      o  Link management:\
    \ Both nodes MUST have a consistent view of the\n         link protection association\
    \ for the spans.  This can be done\n         using LMP [RFC4204] or via manual\
    \ configuration.\n      o  When a link failure is detected at the slave, a failure\n\
    \         indication message MUST be sent to the master informing the\n      \
    \   node of the link failure.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Shared M:N Protection
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Shared M:N Protection\n   Shared M:N protection is described with respect\
    \ to two neighboring\n   nodes, A and B.  The scenario considered is as follows:\n\
    \      o  At any point in time, there are two sets of links between A and\n  \
    \       B, i.e., a working set of N (bi-directional) links carrying\n        \
    \ traffic subject to protection and a protection set of M (bi-\n         directional)\
    \ links.  A protection link may be carrying Extra\n         Traffic.  There is\
    \ no a priori relationship between the two\n         sets of links, but the value\
    \ of M and N MAY be pre-configured.\n         The specific links in the protection\
    \ set MAY be pre-configured\n         to be physically diverse to avoid the possibility\
    \ of failure\n         events affecting a large proportion of protection links\
    \ (along\n         with working links).\n      o  When a link in the working set\
    \ is affected by a failure, the\n         normal traffic is diverted to a link\
    \ in the protection set, if\n         such a link is available.  Note that such\
    \ a link might be\n         carrying more than one LSP, e.g., an OC-192 link carrying\
    \ four\n         STS-48 LSPs.\n      o  More than one link in the working set\
    \ may be affected by the\n         same failure event.  In this case, there may\
    \ not be an adequate\n         number of protection links to accommodate all of\
    \ the affected\n         traffic carried by failed working links.  The set of\
    \ affected\n         working links that are actually restored over available\n\
    \         protection links is then subject to policies (e.g., based on\n     \
    \    relative priority of working traffic).  These policies are not\n        \
    \ specified in this document.\n      o  When normal traffic must be diverted from\
    \ a failed link in the\n         working set to a protection link, the decision\
    \ as to which\n         protection link is chosen is always made by one of the\
    \ nodes, A\n         or B.  This node is considered the \"master\" and it is required\n\
    \         to both apply any policies and select specific protection links\n  \
    \       to divert working traffic.  The other node is considered the\n       \
    \  \"slave\".  The determination of the master and the slave MAY be\n        \
    \ based on configured information, protocol-specific\n         requirements, or\
    \ as a result of running a neighbor discovery\n         procedure.\n      o  Failure\
    \ events are detected by transport layer mechanisms, if\n         available (e.g.,\
    \ SONET Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)/Remote\n         Defect Indication (RDI)).\
    \  Since the bi-directional links are\n         formed by a pair of unidirectional\
    \ links, a failure in the link\n         from A to B is typically detected by\
    \ B, and a failure in the\n         opposite direction is detected by A.  It is\
    \ possible for a\n         failure to simultaneously affect both directions of\
    \ the bi-\n         directional link.  In this case, A and B will concurrently\n\
    \         detect failures, in the B-to-A direction and in the A-to-B\n       \
    \  direction, respectively.\n   The basic steps in M:N protection (ignoring reversion)\
    \ are as\n   follows:\n      1. If the master detects a failure of a working link,\
    \ it\n         autonomously invokes a process to allocate a protection link to\n\
    \         the affected traffic.\n      2. If the slave detects a failure of a\
    \ working link, it MUST\n         inform the master of the failure using a failure\
    \ indication\n         message.  The master then invokes the same procedure as\
    \ above\n         to allocate a protection link.  (It is possible that the master\n\
    \         has itself detected the same failure, for example, a failure\n     \
    \    simultaneously affecting both directions of a link.)\n      3. Once the master\
    \ has determined the identity of the protection\n         link, it indicates this\
    \ to the slave and requests the\n         switchover of the traffic (using a \"\
    Switchover Request\"\n         message).  Prior to this, if the protection link\
    \ is carrying\n         Extra Traffic, the master stops using the link for this\
    \ traffic\n         (i.e., the traffic is dropped by the master and not forwarded\n\
    \         into or out of the protection link).\n      4. The slave sends a \"\
    Switchover Response\" message back to the\n         master.  Prior to this, if\
    \ the selected protection link is\n         carrying traffic that could be pre-empted,\
    \ the slave stops\n         using the link for this traffic (i.e., the traffic\
    \ is dropped\n         by the slave and not forwarded into or out of the protection\n\
    \         link).  It then starts sending the normal traffic on the\n         selected\
    \ protection link.\n      5. When the master receives the Switchover Response,\
    \ it starts\n         sending and receiving the traffic that was previously carried\n\
    \         on the now-failed link over the new link.\n      Note: Although this\
    \ mechanism implies more traffic dropped than\n      necessary, it is preferred\
    \ over possible misconnections during the\n      recovery process.\n   From the\
    \ description above, it is clear that M:N span restoration\n   (involving LSP\
    \ local recovery) MAY require up to three messages for\n   each working link being\
    \ switched: a failure indication message, a\n   Switchover Request message, and\
    \ a Switchover Response message.\n   The following functionality is required for\
    \ M:N span restoration:\n      o  Pre-emption MUST be supported to accommodate\
    \ Extra Traffic.\n      o  Routing: A single TE link encompassing both sets of\
    \ working and\n         protect links should be announced with a Link Protection\
    \ Type\n         \"Shared M:N\".  If Extra Traffic is supported over a set of\
    \ the\n         protection links, then the bandwidth parameters for the set of\n\
    \         protection links MUST also be announced.  The differentiation\n    \
    \     between bandwidth for working and protect links is made using\n        \
    \ priority mechanisms.\n         If there is a failure on a working link, then\
    \ the affected\n         LSP(s) MUST be switched to a protection link, pre-empting\
    \ Extra\n         Traffic if necessary.  The bandwidth for the protection link\n\
    \         MUST be adjusted accordingly.\n      o  Signaling: To establish an LSP\
    \ on the working link, the Link\n         Protection object/TLV indicating \"\
    Shared M:N\" SHOULD be\n         included in the signaling request message for\
    \ that LSP.  To\n         establish an LSP on the protection link, the appropriate\n\
    \         priority (indicating Extra Traffic) SHOULD be used.  These\n       \
    \  objects/TLVs are defined in [RFC3471].  If the Link Protection\n         object/TLV\
    \ is not used, link selection is a matter of local\n         policy.\n      o\
    \  For link management, both nodes MUST have a consistent view of\n         the\
    \ link protection association for the links.  This can be\n         done using\
    \ LMP [RFC4204] or via manual configuration.\n"

- title: 3.3.  Shared Mesh Restoration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Shared Mesh Restoration\n   Shared mesh restoration refers to schemes under\
    \ which protection\n   paths for multiple LSPs share common link and node resources.\
    \  Under\n   these schemes, the protection capacity is pre-reserved, i.e., link\n\
    \   capacity is allocated to protect one or more LSPs, but explicit\n   action\
    \ is required to instantiate a specific protection LSP.  This\n   requires restoration\
    \ signaling along the protection path.  Typically,\n   the protection capacity\
    \ is shared only amongst LSPs whose working\n   paths are physically diverse.\
    \  This criterion can be enforced when\n   provisioning the protection path. \
    \ Specifically, provisioning-related\n   signaling messages may carry information\
    \ about the working path to\n   nodes along the protection path.  This can be\
    \ used as call admission\n   control to accept/reject connections along the protection\
    \ path based\n   on the identification of the resources used for the primary path.\n\
    \   Thus, shared mesh restoration is designed to protect an LSP after a\n   single\
    \ failure event, i.e., a failure that affects the working path\n   of at most\
    \ one LSP sharing the protection capacity.  It is possible\n   that a protection\
    \ path may not be successfully activated when\n   multiple, concurrent failure\
    \ events occur.  In this case, shared mesh\n   restoration capacity may be claimed\
    \ for more than one failed LSP and\n   the protection path can be activated only\
    \ for one of them (at most).\n   For implementing shared mesh restoration, the\
    \ identifier and nodal\n   information related to signaling along the control\
    \ path are as\n   defined for 1+1 protection in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.  In\
    \ addition,\n   each node MUST also keep (local) information needed to establish\
    \ the\n   data plane of the protection path.  This information MUST indicate\n\
    \   the local resources to be allocated, the fabric cross-connect to be\n   established\
    \ to activate the path, etc.  The precise nature of this\n   information would\
    \ depend on the type of node and LSP (the GMPLS\n   signaling document describes\
    \ different type of switches [RFC3471]).\n   It would also depend on whether the\
    \ information is fine or coarse-\n   grained.  For example, fine-grained information\
    \ would indicate pre-\n   selection of all details pertaining to protection path\
    \ activation,\n   such as outgoing link, labels, etc.  Coarse-grained information,\
    \ on\n   the other hand, would allow some details to be determined during\n  \
    \ protection path activation.  For example, protection resources may be\n   pre-selected\
    \ at the level of a TE link, while the selection of the\n   specific component\
    \ link and label occurs during protection path\n   activation.\n   While the coarser\
    \ specification allows some flexibility in the\n   selection of the precise resource\
    \ to activate, it also adds\n   complexity in decision making and signaling during\
    \ the time-critical\n   restoration phase.  Furthermore, the procedures for the\
    \ assignment of\n   bandwidth to protection paths MUST take into account the total\n\
    \   resources in a TE link so that single-failure survivability\n   requirements\

  - "4.  Reversion and Other Administrative Procedures\n   Reversion refers to the\
    \ process of moving an LSP back to the original\n   working path after a failure\
    \ is cleared and the path is repaired.\n   Reversion applies both to local span\
    \ and end-to-end path-protected\n   LSPs.  Reversion is desired for the following\
    \ reasons.  First, the\n   protection path may not be optimal in comparison to\
    \ the working path\n   from a routing and resource consumption point of view.\
    \  Second,\n   moving an LSP to its working path allows the protection resources\
    \ to\n   be used to protect other LSPs.  Reversion has the disadvantage of\n \
    \  causing a second service disruption.  Use of reversion is at the\n   option\
    \ of the operator.  Reversion implies that a working path\n   remains allocated\
    \ to the LSP that was originally routed over it, even\n   after a failure.  It\
    \ is important to have mechanisms that allow\n   reversion to be performed with\
    \ minimal service disruption to the\n   customer.  This can be achieved using\
    \ a \"bridge-and-switch\" approach\n   (often referred to as make-before-break).\n\
    \   The basic steps involved in bridge-and-switch are as follows:\n      1. The\
    \ source node commences the process by \"bridging\" the normal\n         traffic\
    \ onto both the working and the protection paths (or\n         links in the case\
    \ of span protection).\n      2. Once the bridging process is complete, the source\
    \ node sends a\n         Bridge and Switch Request message to the destination,\n\
    \         identifying the LSP and other information necessary to perform\n   \
    \      reversion.  Upon receipt of this message, the destination\n         selects\
    \ the traffic from the working path.  At the same time,\n         it bridges the\
    \ transmitted traffic onto both the working and\n         protection paths.\n\
    \      3. The destination then sends a Bridge and Switch Response message\n  \
    \       to the source confirming the completion of the operation.\n      4. When\
    \ the source receives this message, it switches to receive\n         from the\
    \ working path, and stops transmitting traffic on the\n         protection path.\
    \  The source then sends a Bridge and Switch\n         Completed message to the\
    \ destination confirming that the LSP\n         has been reverted.\n      5. Upon\
    \ receipt of this message, the destination stops\n         transmitting along\
    \ the protection path and de-activates the LSP\n         along this path.  The\
    \ de-activation procedure should remove the\n         crossed connections along\
    \ the protection path (and frees the\n         resources to be used for restoring\
    \ other failures).\n   Administrative procedures other than reversion include\
    \ the ability to\n   force a switchover (from working to protection or vice versa)\
    \ and\n   locking out switchover, i.e., preventing an LSP from moving from\n \
    \  working to protection administratively.  These administrative\n   conditions\
    \ have to be supported by signaling.\n"

- title: 5.1.  LSP Priorities During Protection
  contents:
  - "5.1.  LSP Priorities During Protection\n   Under span protection, a failure event\
    \ could affect more than one\n   working link and there could be fewer protection\
    \ links than the\n   number of failed working links.  Furthermore, a working link\
    \ may\n   contain multiple LSPs of varying priority.  Under this scenario, a\n\
    \   decision must be made as to which working links (and therefore LSPs)\n   should\
    \ be protected.  This decision MAY be based on LSP priorities.\n   In general,\
    \ a node might detect failures sequentially, i.e., all\n   failed working links\
    \ may not be detected simultaneously, but only\n   sequentially.  In this case,\
    \ as per the proposed signaling\n   procedures, LSPs on a working link MAY be\
    \ switched over to a given\n   protection link, but another failure (of a working\
    \ link carrying\n   higher priority LSPs) may be detected soon afterward.  In\
    \ this case,\n   the new LSPs may bump the ones previously switched over the\n\
    \   protection link.\n   In the case of end-to-end shared mesh restoration, priorities\
    \ MAY be\n   implemented for allocating shared link resources under multiple\n\
    \   failure scenarios.  As described in Section 3.3, more than one LSP\n   can\
    \ claim shared resources under multiple failure scenarios.  If such\n   resources\
    \ are first allocated to a lower-priority LSP, they MAY have\n   to be reclaimed\
    \ and allocated to a higher-priority LSP.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of security threats that MAY\
    \ be experienced due to\n   the exchange of messages and information, as detailed\
    \ in this\n   document.  Some examples include interception, spoofing,\n   modification,\
    \ and replay of control messages.  Therefore, the\n   following security requirements\
    \ are applicable to the mechanisms of\n   this document.\n      o  Signaling MUST\
    \ be able to provide authentication, integrity,\n         and protection against\
    \ replay attacks.\n      o  Privacy and confidentiality are not required.  Only\n\
    \         authentication is required to ensure that the signaling\n         messages\
    \ are originating from the right place and have not been\n         modified in\
    \ transit.\n      o  Protection of the identity of the data plane end-points (in\n\
    \         Failure Indication messages) is not required\n   The consequences of\
    \ poorly secured protection may increase the risk\n   of triggering recovery actions\
    \ under false Failure Indication\n   messages, including LSP identifiers that\
    \ are not under failure.  Such\n   information could subsequently trigger the\
    \ initiation of \"false\"\n   recovery actions while there are no reasons to do\
    \ so.  Additionally,\n   if the identification of the LSP is tampered with from\
    \ a Failure\n   Indication message, recovery actions will involve nodes for which\
    \ the\n   LSPs do not indicate any failure condition or for which no Failure\n\
    \   Indication message has been received.  The consequences of such\n   actions\
    \ is unpredictable and MAY lead to de-synchronisation between\n   the control\
    \ and the data plane, as well as increase the risk of\n   misconnections.  Moreover,\
    \ the consequences of poorly applied\n   protection may increase the risk of misconnection.\
    \  In particular,\n   when Extra Traffic is involved, it is easily possible to\
    \ deliver the\n   wrong traffic to the wrong destination.  Similarly, an intrusion\
    \ that\n   sets up what appears to be a valid protection LSP and then causes a\n\
    \   fault may be able to divert traffic.\n   Moreover, tampering with a routing\
    \ information exchange may also have\n   an effect on traffic engineering.  Therefore,\
    \ any mechanisms used for\n   securing and authenticating the transmission of\
    \ routing information\n   SHOULD be applied in the present context.\n"
