- title: 1  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1  Introduction\n   This document is a guide for Internet standard writers. \
    \ It offers\n   guidelines on how to write a standards-track document with clarity,\n\
    \   precision, and completeness.  These guidelines are based on both\n   prior\
    \ successful and unsuccessful IETF specification experiences.\n   These guidelines\
    \ are to be used with RFC 2223, \"Instructions to RFC\n   Authors\", or its update.\
    \  Note that some guidelines may not apply in\n   certain situations.\n   The\
    \ goal is to increase the possibility that multiple implementations\n   of a protocol\
    \ will interoperate.  Writing specifications to these\n   guidelines will not\
    \ guarantee interoperability.  However, a\n   recognized barrier to the creation\
    \ of interoperable protocol\n   implementations is unclear specifications.\n \
    \  Many will benefit from having well-written protocol specifications.\n   Implementers\
    \ will have a better chance to conform to the protocol\n   specification.  Protocol\
    \ testers can use the specification to derive\n   unambiguous testable statements.\
    \  Purchasers and users of the\n   protocol will have a better understanding of\
    \ its capabilities.\n   For further information on the process for standardizing\
    \ protocols\n   and procedures please refer to BCP 9/RFC 2026, \"The Internet\n\
    \   Standards Process -- Revision 3\".  In addition, some considerations\n   for\
    \ protocol design are given in RFC 1958, \"Architectural Principles\n   of the\
    \ Internet\".\n"
- title: 2  General Guidelines
  contents:
  - "2  General Guidelines\n   It is important that multiple readers and implementers\
    \ of a standard\n   have the same understanding of a document.  To this end, information\n\
    \   should be orderly and detailed.  The following are general guidelines\n  \
    \ intended to help in the production of such a document.  The IESG may\n   require\
    \ that all or some of the following sections appear in a\n   standards track document.\n"
- title: 2.1  Discussion of Security
  contents:
  - "2.1  Discussion of Security\n   If the Internet is to achieve its full potential\
    \ in commercial,\n   governmental, and personal affairs, it must assure users\
    \ that their\n   information transfers are free from tampering or compromise.\
    \  Well-\n   written security sections in standards-track documents can help\n\
    \   promote the confidence level required.  Above all, new protocols and\n   practices\
    \ must not worsen overall Internet security.\n   A significant threat to the Internet\
    \ comes from those individuals who\n   are motivated and capable of exploiting\
    \ circumstances, events, or\n   vulnerabilities of the system to cause harm. \
    \ In addition, deliberate\n   or inadvertent user behavior may expose the system\
    \ to attack or\n   exploitation.  The harm could range from disrupting or denying\n\
    \   network service, to damaging user systems.  Additionally, information\n  \
    \ disclosure could provide the means to attack another system, or\n   reveal patterns\
    \ of behavior that could be used to harm an individual,\n   organization, or network.\
    \  This is a particular concern with\n   standards that define a portion of the\
    \ Management Information Base\n   (MIB).\n   Standards authors must accept that\
    \ the protocol they specify will be\n   subject to attack.  They are responsible\
    \ for determining what attacks\n   are possible, and for detailing the nature\
    \ of the attacks in the\n   document.  Otherwise, they must convincingly argue\
    \ that attack is not\n   realistic in a specific environment, and restrict the\
    \ use of the\n   protocol to that environment.\n   After the document has exhaustively\
    \ identified the security risks the\n   protocol is exposed to, the authors must\
    \ formulate and detail a\n   defense against those attacks.  They must discuss\
    \ the applicable\n   countermeasures employed, or the risk the user is accepting\
    \ by using\n   the protocol.  The countermeasures may be provided by a protocol\n\
    \   mechanism or by reliance on external mechanisms.  Authors should be\n   knowledgeable\
    \ of existing security mechanisms, and reuse them if\n   practical.  When a cryptographic\
    \ algorithm is used, the protocol\n   should be written to permit its substitution\
    \ with another algorithm\n   in the future.  Finally, the authors should discuss\
    \ implementation\n   hints or guidelines, e.g., how to deal with untrustworthy\
    \ data or\n   peer systems.\n   Security measures will have an impact within the\
    \ environment that\n   they are used.  Perhaps users will now be constrained on\
    \ what they\n   can do in the Internet, or will experience degradation in the\
    \ speed\n   of service.  The effects the security measures have on the protocol's\n\
    \   use and performance should be discussed.\n   The discussion of security can\
    \ be concentrated in the Security\n   Considerations section of the document,\
    \ or throughout the document\n   where it is relevant to particular parts of the\
    \ specification.  An\n   advantage of the second approach is that it ensures security\
    \ is an\n   integral part of the protocol's development, rather than something\n\
    \   that is a follow-on or secondary effort.  If security is discussed\n   throughout\
    \ the document, the Security Considerations section must\n   summarize and refer\
    \ to the appropriate specification sections.  This\n   will insure that the protocol's\
    \ security measures are emphasized to\n   implementer and user both.\n   Within\
    \ the Security Considerations section, a discussion of the path\n   not taken\
    \ may be appropriate.  There may be several security\n   mechanisms that were\
    \ not selected for a variety of reasons: cost or\n   difficulty of implementation,\
    \ or ineffectiveness for a given network\n   environment.  By listing the mechanisms\
    \ they did not use and the\n   reasons, editors can demonstrate that the protocol's\
    \ WG gave security\n   the necessary thought.  In addition, this gives the protocol's\
    \ users\n   the information they need to consider whether one of the non-selected\n\
    \   mechanisms would be better suited to their particular requirements.\n   A\
    \ document giving further guidance on security topics is in\n   development. \
    \ Authors should obtain a copy of the completed RFC to\n   help them prepare the\
    \ security portion of the standard.\n   Finally, it is no longer acceptable that\
    \ Security Considerations\n   sections consist solely of statements to the effect\
    \ that security was\n   not considered in preparing the standard.\n   Some examples\
    \ of Security Considerations sections are found in STD\n   33/RFC 1350, STD 51/RFC\
    \ 1662, and STD 53/RFC 1939.  RFC 2316, \"Report\n   of the IAB Security Architecture\
    \ Workshop\", provides additional\n   information in this topic area.\n"
- title: 2.2  Protocol Description
  contents:
  - "2.2  Protocol Description\n   Standards track documents must include a description\
    \ of the protocol.\n   This description must address the protocol's purpose, intended\n\
    \   functions, services it provides, and, the arena, circumstances, or\n   any\
    \ special considerations of the protocol's use.\n   The authors of a protocol\
    \ specification will have a great deal of\n   knowledge as to the reason for the\
    \ protocol.  However, the reader is\n   more likely to have general networking\
    \ knowledge and experience,\n   rather than expertise in a particular protocol.\
    \  An explanation of\n   it's purpose and use will give the reader a reference\
    \ point for\n   understanding the protocol, and where it fits in the Internet.\
    \  The\n   STD 54/RFC 2328 was recommended to the STDGUIDE working group as\n\
    \   providing a good example of this in its \"Protocol Overview\" section.\n \
    \  The protocol's general description must also provide information on\n   the\
    \ relationship between the different parties to the protocol. This\n   can be\
    \ done by showing typical packet sequences.\n   This also applies to the algorithms\
    \ used by a protocol.  A detailed\n   description of the algorithms or citation\
    \ of readily available\n   references that give such a description is necessary.\n"
- title: 2.3  Target Audience
  contents:
  - "2.3  Target Audience\n   RFCs have been written with many different purposes,\
    \ ranging from the\n   technical to the administrative.  Those written as standards\
    \ should\n   clearly identify the intended audience, for example, designers,\n\
    \   implementers, testers, help desk personnel, educators, end users, or\n   others.\
    \  If there are multiple audiences being addressed in the\n   document, the section\
    \ for each audience needs to be identified.  The\n   goal is to help the reader\
    \ discover and focus on what they have\n   turned to the document for, and avoid\
    \ what they may find confusing,\n   diverting, or extraneous.\n"
- title: 2.4  Level of Detail
  contents:
  - "2.4  Level of Detail\n   The author should consider what level of descriptive\
    \ detail best\n   conveys the protocol's intent.  Concise text has several advantages.\n\
    \   It makes the document easier to read.  Such text reduces the chance\n   for\
    \ conflict between different portions of the specification.  The\n   reader can\
    \ readily identify the required protocol mechanisms in the\n   standard.  In addition,\
    \ it makes it easier to identify the\n   requirements for protocol implementation.\
    \  A disadvantage of concise\n   descriptions is that a reader may not fully comprehend\
    \ the reasoning\n   behind the protocol, and thus make assumptions that will lead\
    \ to\n   implementation errors.\n   Longer descriptions may be necessary to explain\
    \ purpose, background,\n   rationale, implementation experience, or to provide\
    \ tutorial\n   information.  This helps the reader understand the protocol.  Yet,\n\
    \   several dangers exist with lengthy text.  Finding the protocol\n   requirements\
    \ in the text is difficult or confusing.  The same\n   mechanism may have multiple\
    \ descriptions, which leads to\n   misinterpretation or conflict.  Finally, it\
    \ is more difficult to\n   comprehend, a consideration as English is not the native\
    \ language of\n   the many worldwide readers of IETF standards.\n   One approach\
    \ is to divide the standard into sections: one describing\n   the protocol concisely,\
    \ while another section consists of explanatory\n   text.  The STD 3/RFC 1122/RFC\
    \ 1123 and STD 54/RFC 2328 provides\n   examples of this method.\n"
- title: 2.5  Change Logs
  contents:
  - "2.5  Change Logs\n   As a document moves along the standards track, from Proposed\
    \ to Draft\n   or Draft to Full, or cycles in level, it will undergo changes due\
    \ to\n   better understanding of the protocol or implementation experience. To\n\
    \   help implementers track the changes being made a log showing what has\n  \
    \ changed from the previous version of the specification is required\n   (see\
    \ Appendix).\n"
- title: 2.6  Protocol Versions
  contents:
  - "2.6  Protocol Versions\n   Often the standard is specifying a new version of\
    \ an existing\n   protocol.  In such a case, the authors should detail the differences\n\
    \   between the previous version and the new version.  This should\n   include\
    \ the rationale for the changes, for example, implementation\n   experience, changes\
    \ in technology, responding to user demand, etc.\n"
- title: 2.7  Decision History
  contents:
  - "2.7  Decision History\n   In standards development, reaching consensus requires\
    \ making\n   difficult choices.  These choices are made through working group\n\
    \   discussions or from implementation experience.  By including the\n   basis\
    \ for a contentious decision, the author can prevent future\n   revisiting of\
    \ these disagreements when the original parties have\n   moved on.  In addition,\
    \ the knowledge of the \"why\" is as useful to an\n   implementer as the description\
    \ of \"how\".  For example, the\n   alternative not taken may have been simpler\
    \ to implement, so\n   including the reasons behind the choice may prevent future\n\
    \   implementers from taking nonstandard shortcuts.\n"
- title: 2.8  Response to Out of Specification Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.8  Response to Out of Specification Behavior\n   A detail description of the\
    \ actions taken in case of behavior that is\n   deviant from or exceeds the specification\
    \ is useful.  This is an area\n   where implementers often differ in opinion as\
    \ to the appropriate\n   response.  By specifying a common response, the standard\
    \ author can\n   reduce the risk that different implementations will come in to\n\
    \   conflict.\n   The standard should describe responses to behavior explicitly\n\
    \   forbidden or out of the boundaries defined by the specification.  Two\n  \
    \ possible approaches to such cases are discarding, or invoking error-\n   handling\
    \ mechanisms.  If discarding is chosen, detailing the\n   disposition may be necessary.\
    \  For instance, treat dropped frames as\n   if they were never received, or reset\
    \ an existing connection or\n   adjacency state.\n   The specification should\
    \ describe actions taken when a critical\n   resource or a performance-scaling\
    \ limit is exceeded.  This is\n   necessary for cases where a risk of network\
    \ degradation or\n   operational failure exists.  In such cases, a consistent\
    \ behavior\n   between implementations is necessary.\n"
- title: 2.9  The Liberal/Conservative Rule
  contents:
  - "2.9  The Liberal/Conservative Rule\n   A rule, first stated in STD 5/RFC 791,\
    \ recognized as having benefits\n   in implementation robustness and interoperability\
    \ is:\n                    \"Be liberal in what you accept, and\n            \
    \          conservative in what you send\".\n   Or establish restrictions on what\
    \ a protocol transmits, but be able\n   to deal with every conceivable error received.\
    \  Caution is urged in\n   applying this approach in standards track protocols.\
    \  It has in the\n   past lead to conflicts between vendors when interoperability\
    \ fails.\n   The sender accuses the receiver of failing to be liberal enough,\
    \ and\n   the receiver accuses the sender of not being conservative enough.\n\
    \   Therefore, the author is obligated to provide extensive detail on\n   send\
    \ and receive behavior.\n   To avoid any confusion between the two, recommend\
    \ that standard\n   authors specify send and receive behavior separately.  The\n\
    \   description of reception will require the most detailing.  For\n   implementations\
    \ are expected to continue operating regardless of\n   error received.  Therefore,\
    \ the actions taken to achieve that result,\n   need to be laid out in the protocol\
    \ specification.  Standard authors\n   should concern themselves on achieving\
    \ a level of cooperation that\n   limits network disruption, not just how to survive\
    \ on the network.\n   The appearance of undefined information or conditions must\
    \ not cause\n   a network or host failure.  This requires specification on how\
    \ to\n   attempt acceptance of most of the packets.  Two approaches are\n   available,\
    \ either using as much of the packet's content as possible,\n   or invoking error\
    \ procedures.  The author should specify a dividing\n   line on when to take which\
    \ approach.\n   A case for consideration is that of a routing protocol, where\n\
    \   acceptance of flawed information can cause network failure.  For\n   protocols\
    \ such as this, the specification should identify packets\n   that could have\
    \ different interpretations and mandate that they be\n   rejected completely or\
    \ the nature of the attempt to recover some\n   information from them.  For example,\
    \ routing updates that contain\n   more data than the tuple count shows.  The\
    \ protocol authors should\n   consider whether some trailing data can be accepted\
    \ as additional\n   routes, or to reject the entire packet as suspect because\
    \ it is non-\n   conformant.\n"
- title: 2.10  Handling of Protocol Options
  contents:
  - "2.10  Handling of Protocol Options\n   Specifications with many optional features\
    \ increase the complexity of\n   the implementation and the chance of non-interoperable\n\
    \   implementations.  The danger is that different implementations may\n   specify\
    \ some combination of options that are unable to interoperate\n   with each other.\n\
    \   As the document moves along the standard track, implementation\n   experience\
    \ shall determine the need for each option.  Implementation\n   shall show whether\
    \ the option should be a mandatory part of the\n   protocol or remain an option.\
    \  If an option is not implemented as the\n   document advances, it must be removed\
    \ from the protocol before it\n   reaches draft standard status.\n   Therefore,\
    \ options shall only be present in a protocol to address a\n   real requirement.\
    \  For example, options can support future\n   extensibility of the protocol,\
    \ a particular market, e.g., the\n   financial industry, or a specific network\
    \ environment, e.g., a\n   network constrained by limited bandwidth.  They shall\
    \ not be included\n   as a means to \"buy-off\" a minority opinion.  Omission\
    \ of the optional\n   item shall have no interoperability consequences for the\n\
    \   implementation that does so.\n   One possible approach is to document protocol\
    \ options in a separate\n   specification.  This keeps the main protocol specification\
    \ clean and\n   makes it clear that the options are not required to implement\
    \ the\n   protocol.  Regardless of whether they appear within the specification\n\
    \   or in a separate document, the text shall discuss the full\n   implications\
    \ of either using the option or not, and the case for\n   choosing either course.\
    \  As part of this, the author needs to\n   consider and describe how the options\
    \ are used alongside other\n   protocols.  The text must also specify the default\
    \ conditions of all\n   options.  For security checking options the default condition\
    \ is on\n   or enabled.\n   There are occasions when mutually exclusive options\
    \ appear within the\n   protocol.  That is, the implementation of an optional\
    \ feature\n   precludes the implementation of the other optional feature.  For\n\
    \   clarity, the author needs to state when to implement one or the\n   other,\
    \ what the effect of choosing one over the other is, and what\n   problems the\
    \ implementer or user may face.  The choice of one or the\n   other options shall\
    \ have no interoperability consequences between\n   multiple implementations.\n"
- title: 2.11  Indicating Requirement Levels
  contents:
  - "2.11  Indicating Requirement Levels\n   The BCP 14/RFC 2119, \"Key words for\
    \ use in RFCs to Indicate\n   Requirement Level\", defines several words that\
    \ are necessary for\n   writing a standards track document.  Editors of standards\
    \ track\n   documents must not deviate from the definitions provided as they are\n\
    \   intended to identify interoperability requirements or limit\n   potentially\
    \ harmful behavior.  The capitalization of these words is\n   the accepted norm,\
    \ and can help in identifying an unintentional or\n   unreasonable requirement.\
    \  These words have been used in several RFCs\n   the first instances being STD\
    \ 3/RFC 1122/RFC 1123.\n"
- title: 2.12  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.12  Notational Conventions\n   Formal syntax notations can be used to define\
    \ complicated protocol\n   concepts or data types, and to specify values of these\
    \ data types.\n   This permits the protocol to be written without concern on how\
    \ the\n   implementation is constructed, or how the data type is represented\n\
    \   during transfer.  The specification is simplified because it can be\n   presented\
    \ as \"axioms\" that will be proven by implementation.\n   The formal specification\
    \ of the syntax used should be referenced in\n   the text of the standard.  Any\
    \ extensions, subsets, alterations, or\n   exceptions to that formal syntax should\
    \ be defined within the\n   standard.\n   The STD 11/RFC 822 provides an example\
    \ of this.  In RFC 822 (Section\n   2 and Appendix D) the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)\
    \ meta-language was\n   extended to make its representation smaller and easier\
    \ to understand.\n   Another example is STD 16/RFC 1155 (Section 3.2) where a\
    \ subset of\n   the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is defined.\n   The author\
    \ of a standards track protocol needs to consider several\n   things before they\
    \ use a formal syntax notation.  Is the formal\n   specification language being\

- title: 2.13  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.13  IANA Considerations\n   The common use of the Internet standard track protocols\
    \ by the\n   Internet community requires that unique values be assigned to\n \
    \  parameter fields.  An IETF WG does not have the authority to assign\n   these\
    \ values for the protocol it developed.  The Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority\
    \ (IANA) is the central authority for the assignment\n   of unique parameter values\
    \ for Internet protocols.  The authors of a\n   developing protocol need to coordinate\
    \ with the IANA the rules and\n   procedures to manage the number space.  This\
    \ coordination needs to be\n   completed prior to submitting the Internet Draft\
    \ to the standards\n   track.\n   A document is in preparation that discusses\
    \ issues related to\n   identifier assignment policy and guidelines on specific\
    \ text to task\n   IANA with its administration.  Standard authors should obtain\
    \ a copy\n   of it when it is finalized as an RFC.\n   For further information\
    \ on parameter assignment and current\n   assignments, authors can reference STD\
    \ 2, RFC 1700, \"Assigned\n   Numbers\" (http://www.iana.org).\n"
- title: 2.14  Network Management Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.14  Network Management Considerations\n   When relevant, each standard needs\
    \ to discuss how to manage the\n   protocol being specified.  This management\
    \ process should be\n   compatible with the current IETF Standard management protocol.\
    \  In\n   addition, a MIB must be defined within the standard or in a companion\n\
    \   document.  The MIB must be compatible with current Structure of\n   Management\
    \ Information (SMI) and parseable using a tool such as\n   SMICng.  Where management\
    \ or a MIB is not necessary this section of\n   the standard should explain the\
    \ reason it is not relevant to the\n   protocol.\n"
- title: 2.15  Scalability Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.15  Scalability Considerations\n   The standard should establish the limitations\
    \ on the scale of use,\n   e.g., tens of millions of sessions, gigabits per second,\
    \ etc., and\n   establish limits on the resources used, e.g., round trip time,\n\
    \   computing resources, etc.  This is important because it establishes\n   the\
    \ ability of the network to accommodate the number of users and the\n   complexity\
    \ of their relations.  The STD 53/RFC 1939 has an example of\n   such a section.\
    \  If this is not applicable to the protocol, an\n   explanation of why not should\
    \ be included.\n"
- title: 2.16  Network Stability
  contents:
  - "2.16  Network Stability\n   A standard should discuss the relationship between\
    \ network topology\n   and convergence behavior.  As part of this, any topology\
    \ that would\n   be troublesome for the protocol should be identified.  Additionally,\n\
    \   the specification should address any possible destabilizing events,\n   and\
    \ means by which the protocol resists or recovers from them.  The\n   purpose\
    \ is to insure that the network will stabilize, in a timely\n   fashion, after\
    \ a change, and that a combination of errors or events\n   will not plunge the\
    \ network into chaos.  The STD 34/RFC 1058, as an\n   example, has sections which\
    \ discuss how that protocol handles the\n   affects of changing topology.\n  \
    \ The obvious case this would apply to is a routing protocol.  However,\n   an\
    \ application protocol could also have dynamic behavior that would\n   affect\
    \ the network.  For example, a messaging protocol could suddenly\n   dump a large\
    \ number of messages onto the network.  Therefore, editors\n   of an application\
    \ protocol will have to consider possible impacts to\n   network stability and\
    \ convergence behavior.\n"

    \ should appear on the word's first appearance within the text of the\n   protocol\

- title: 3.2  Summary Tables
  contents:
  - "3.2  Summary Tables\n   The specifications of some protocols are particularly\
    \ lengthy,\n   sometimes covering a hundred pages or more.  In such cases, the\n\
    \   inclusion of a summary table can reduce the risk of conformance\n   failure\
    \ by an implementation through oversight.  A summary table\n   itemizes what in\
    \ a protocol is mandatory, optional, or prohibited.\n   Summary tables do not\
    \ guarantee conformance, but serve to assist an\n   implementer in checking that\
    \ they have addressed all protocol\n   features.\n   The summary table will consist\
    \ of, as a minimum, four (4) columns:\n   Protocol Feature, Section Reference,\
    \ Status, and\n   References/Footnotes.  The author may add columns if they further\n\
    \   explain or clarify the protocol.\n   In the Protocol Feature column, list\
    \ the protocol's characteristics,\n   for example, a command word.  We recommend\
    \ grouping series of related\n   transactions under descriptive headers, for example,\
    \ RECEPTION.\n   Section reference directs the implementer to the section, paragraph,\n\
    \   or page that describes the protocol feature in detail.\n   Status indicates\
    \ whether the feature is mandatory, optional, or\n   prohibited.  The author can\
    \ use either a separate column for each\n   possibility, or a single column with\
    \ appropriate codes.  These codes\n   need to be defined at the start of the summary\
    \ table to avoid\n   confusion.  Possible status codes:\n       M    - must or\

    \ column authors can point to other RFCs\n   that are necessary to consider in\
    \ implementing this protocol feature,\n   or any footnotes necessary to explain\
    \ the implementation further.\n   The STD 3/RFC 1122/RFC 1123 provides examples\
    \ of summary tables.\n"
- title: 3.3  State Machine Descriptions
  contents:
  - "3.3  State Machine Descriptions\n   A convenient method of presenting a protocol's\
    \ behavior is as a\n   state-machine model.  That is, a protocol can be described\
    \ by a\n   series of states resulting from a command, operation, or transaction.\n\
    \   State-machine models define the variables and constants that\n   establish\
    \ a state, the events that cause state transitions and the\n   actions that result\
    \ from those transitions.  Through these models, an\n   understanding of the protocol's\
    \ dynamic operation as sequence of\n   state transitions that occur for any given\
    \ event is possible.  State\n   transitions can be detailed by diagrams, tables,\
    \ or time lines.\n   Note that state-machine models are never to take the place\
    \ of\n   detailed text description of the specification.  They are adjuncts to\n\
    \   the text.  The protocol specification shall always take precedence in\n  \
    \ the case of a conflict.\n   When using a state transition diagram, show each\
    \ possible protocol\n   state as a box connected by state transition arcs.  The\
    \ author should\n   label each arc with the event that causes the transition,\
    \ and, in\n   parentheses, any actions taken during the transition.  The STD 5/RFC\n\
    \   1112 provides an example of such a diagram.  As ASCII text is the\n   preferred\
    \ storage format for RFCs, only simple diagrams are possible.\n   Tables can summarize\
    \ more complex or extensive state transitions.\n   In a state transition table,\
    \ the different events are listed\n   vertically and the different states are\
    \ listed horizontally.  The\n   form, action/new state, represents state transitions\
    \ and actions.\n   Commas separate multiple actions, and succeeding lines are\
    \ used as\n   required.  The authors should present multiple actions in the order\n\
    \   they must be executed, if relevant.  Letters that follow the state\n   indicate\
    \ an explanatory footnote.  The dash ('-') indicates an\n   illegal transition.\
    \  The STD 51/RFC 1661 provides an example of such\n   a state transition table.\
    \  The initial columns and rows of that table\n   follow as an example:\n    \
    \       | State\n           |    0         1         2         3         4   \

    \         -         -       tlf/2     tlf/3\n   The STD 18/RFC 904 also presents\
    \ state transitions in table format.\n   However, it lists transitions in the\
    \ form n/a, where n is the next\n   state and a represents the action.  The method\
    \ in RFC 1661 is\n   preferred as new state logically follows action.  In addition,\
    \ RFC\n   904's Appendix C models transitions as the Cartesian product of two\n\
    \   state machines.  This is a more complex representation that may be\n   difficult\
    \ to comprehend for those readers that are unfamiliar with\n   the format.  We\
    \ recommend that authors present tables as defined in\n   the previous paragraph.\n\
    \   A final method of representing state changes is by a time line.  The\n   two\
    \ sides of the time line represent the machines involved in the\n   exchange.\
    \  The author lists the states the machines enter as time\n   progresses (downward)\
    \ along the outside of time line.  Within the\n   time line, show the actions\
    \ that cause the state transitions.  An\n   example:\n            client     \
    \                                server\n               |                    \

- title: CHANGES FROM DRAFT -06
  contents:
  - "CHANGES FROM DRAFT -06\n   The following changes were made following IESG review:\n\
    \   References to RFC 1543 were changed to RFC 2223 that obsoleted it.\n   In\
    \ section 2.1, \"export control\" was dropped as a valid reason for\n   not selecting\
    \ a security mechanism.  In addition, ambiguous or\n   conflicting sentences were\
    \ removed.\n   In section 2.1 reference made to RFC 2315 as an additional source\
    \ of\n   information.\n   Section 2.5 was changed to highlight the Change Log's\
    \ purpose as\n   assistance to implementers.\n   The IANA Considerations section\
    \ (2.13) was rewritten to highlight\n   that the IANA guidelines document is work\
    \ in progress but should be\n   used when it becomes available.\n   Section 3.4\
    \ Character Sets was deleted and replaced by section 2.17\n   Internationalization.\n\
    \   Spelling and grammar corrections were made.\n"
- title: CHANGES FROM DRAFT -05
  contents:
  - "CHANGES FROM DRAFT -05\n   A sentence pointing to a pending document that further\
    \ addresses IANA\n   considerations was added to section 2.13.  The current draft\
    \ of that\n   document is draft-iesg-iana-considerations-02.txt.  A clause stating\n\
    \   that the IANA established the assignment policies was removed since it\n \
    \  appeared to conflict with the intent of the referenced ID.\n   Placeholders\
    \ for the BCP and RFC number have been added to the text\n   and reference section.\n\
    \   A new section (2.5) requiring change logs as documents progress along\n  \
    \ the standards track was added.\n   References to RFC 2044 were changed to RFC\
    \ 2279 that obsoleted it.\n   Spelling and grammar corrections were made.\n"
- title: CHANGES FROM DRAFT -04
  contents:
  - "CHANGES FROM DRAFT -04\n   A paragraph pointing to a pending document that further\
    \ addresses\n   security was updated.\n"
