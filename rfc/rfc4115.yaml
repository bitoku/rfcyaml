- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The differentiated service defines a quality-of-service\
    \ (QoS)\n   architecture for the Internet [RFC2475].  Two integral components\
    \ of\n   this architecture are traffic metering and marking.  This document\n\
    \   describes a two-rate, three-color metering/marker algorithm that is\n   suitable\
    \ for the differentiated service applications such as IP and\n   L2 VPNs.  This\
    \ algorithm has been in use for data services including\n   Frame Relay Service.\n\
    \   The metering/marker defined here is different from those in [RFC2697]\n  \
    \ and [RFC2698].  It is different from [RFC2697] in that it is a two-\n   rate,\
    \ three-color marker.  In contrast, [RFC2697] is a single-rate\n   marker.  It\
    \ is different from [RFC2698] in the way its parameters are\n   defined, which\
    \ allows a better handling of in-profile traffic for\n   predominant service scenarios\
    \ over a wider range of traffic\n   parameters.\n   Furthermore, the algorithm\
    \ described here eliminates the need for the\n   CE to shape its traffic to a\
    \ certain peak information rate (PIR), as\n   might be the case for the marker\
    \ defined in [RFC2698] when the value\n   for the peak burst size (PBS) is smaller\
    \ than that for the committed\n   burst size (CBS).\n   The marker described here\
    \ operates for both color-blind and color-\n   aware modes, as defined in [RFC2698].\n"
- title: 2.  Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.  Configuration\n   The operation of the marker is described by two rate values.\
    \  The\n   committed information rate (CIR) and the excess information rate\n\
    \   (EIR).  CIR and EIR define the token generation rate of a token\n   bucket\
    \ with size that is equal to committed burst size (CBS) and\n   excess burst size\
    \ (EBS), respectively.\n   The CBS and EBS are measured in bytes and must configure\
    \ to be\n   greater than the expected maximum length of the incoming PDU.  The\n\
    \   CIR and EIR are both measured in bits/s.  The CIR and EIR can be set\n   independently\
    \ of each other.  Alternatively, the CIR and EIR can be\n   linked together by\
    \ defining a burst duration parameter, T, where\n   T=CBS/CIR=EBS/EIR.\n"
- title: 3.  Metering and Marking
  contents:
  - "3.  Metering and Marking\n   The behavior of the meter is defined in terms of\
    \ its mode and two\n   token buckets, C and E, with the rates, CIR and EIR, respectively,\n\
    \   and maximum sizes CBS and EBS.\n   The token buckets C and E are initially\
    \ (at time 0) full; i.e., the\n   token count Tc(0) = CBS and Te(0) = EBS.  Thereafter,\
    \ the token count\n   Tc is incremented by one CIR times per second (up to CBS),\
    \ and the\n   token count Te is incremented by one EIR times per second (up to\n\
    \   EBS).\n   In the color-aware operation, it is assumed that the algorithm can\n\
    \   recognize the color of the incoming packet (green, yellow, or red).\n   The\
    \ color-aware operation of the metering is described below.\n   When a green packet\
    \ of size B arrives at time t, then\n      o  if Tc(t)- B > 0, the packet is green,\
    \ and Tc(t) is decremented\n         by B; else\n      o  if Te(t)- B > 0, the\
    \ packet is yellow, and Te(t) is decremented\n         by B; else\n      o  the\
    \ packet is red.\n   When a yellow packet of size B arrives at time t, then\n\
    \      o  if Te(t)- B > 0, the packet is yellow, and Te(t) is decremented\n  \
    \       by B; else\n      o  the packet is red.\n   Incoming red packets are not\
    \ tested against any of the two token\n   buckets and remain red.\n   In the color-blind\
    \ operation, the meter assumes that all incoming\n   packets are green.  The operation\
    \ of the meter is similar to that in\n   the color-aware operation for green packets.\n\
    \   The salient feature of the algorithm described above is that traffic\n   within\
    \ the defined CIR is colored green directly, without the need to\n   pass additional\
    \ conformance tests.  This feature is the main\n   differentiator of this algorithm\
    \ from that described in [RFC2698],\n   where traffic is marked green after it\
    \ passes two conformance tests\n   (those for PIR and CIR).  In either color-blind\
    \ or color-aware mode,\n   the need to pass two conformance tests could result\
    \ in packets being\n   dropped at the PIR token bucket even though they are perfectly\
    \ within\n   their CIR (in-profile traffic).  Furthermore, in the color-aware\
    \ mode\n   of operation, the need to pass two conformance tests could make\n \
    \  yellow traffic starve incoming in-profile green packets.\n   The operation\
    \ of the algorithm is illustrated in the flow chart\n   below:\n             \

- title: 4.  Service Scenario
  contents:
  - "4.  Service Scenario\n   The described marker can be used to mark an IP packet\
    \ stream in a\n   service where different, decreasing levels of assurances (either\n\
    \   absolute or relative) are given to packets that are green, yellow, or\n  \
    \ red.  For example, a service may discard all red packets because they\n   exceeded\
    \ the service rates, forward yellow packets as best effort,\n   and forward green\
    \ packets with low drop probability.  The marker\n   could also be used for metering\
    \ L2 VPN services such as the emerging\n   Ethernet transport over IP networks.\n"
