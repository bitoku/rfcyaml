  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet is international.\n   With the international\
    \ Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n   interchange data in a multiplicity\
    \ of languages, which in turn\n   utilize a bewildering number of characters.\n\
    \   This document is the current policies being applied by the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) towards the standardization efforts\n   in the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF) in order to help\n   Internet protocols fulfill\
    \ these requirements.\n   The document is very much based upon the recommendations\
    \ of the IAB\n   Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n\
    \   documented in RFC 2130 [WR].  This document attempts to be concise,\n   explicit\
    \ and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged to\n   read RFC 2130.\n\
    \   The document uses the terms 'MUST', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY', and their\n   negatives,\
    \ in the way described in [RFC 2119].  In this case, 'the\n   specification' as\
    \ used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n   protocols being submitted to\
    \ the IETF standards process.\n"
- title: 2.  Where to do internationalization
  contents:
  - "2.  Where to do internationalization\n   Internationalization is for humans.\
    \ This means that protocols are not\n   subject to internationalization; text\
    \ strings are. Where protocol\n   elements look like text tokens, such as in many\
    \ IETF application\n   layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts are\
    \ protocol and\n   which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n   Names are a problem, because\
    \ people feel strongly about them, many of\n   them are mostly for local usage,\
    \ and all of them tend to leak out of\n   the local context at times. RFC 1958\
    \ [RFC 1958] recommends US-ASCII\n   for all globally visible names.\n   This\
    \ document does not mandate a policy on name internationalization,\n   but requires\
    \ that all protocols describe whether names are\n   internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\
    \   NOTE: In the protocol stack for any given application, there is\n   usually\
    \ one or a few layers that need to address these problems.\n   It would, for instance,\
    \ not be appropriate to define language tags\n   for Ethernet frames. But it is\
    \ the responsibility of the WGs to\n   ensure that whenever responsibility for\
    \ internationalization is left\n   to \"another layer\", those responsible for\
    \ that layer are in fact\n   aware that they HAVE that responsibility.\n"
- title: 3.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Terms\n   This document uses the term \"charset\" to mean a\
    \ set of rules for\n   mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of characters,\
    \ such\n   as the combination of a coded character set and a character encoding\n\
    \   scheme; this is also what is used as an identifier in MIME \"charset=\"\n\
    \   parameters, and registered in the IANA charset registry [REG].  (Note\n  \
    \ that this is NOT a term used by other standards bodies, such as ISO).\n   For\
    \ a definition of the term \"coded character set\", refer to the\n   workshop\
    \ report.\n   A \"name\" is an identifier such as a person's name, a hostname,\
    \ a\n   domainname, a filename or an E-mail address; it is often treated as\n\
    \   an identifier rather than as a piece of text, and is often used in\n   protocols\
    \ as an identifier for entities, without surrounding text.\n"
- title: 3.1.  What charset to use
  contents:
  - "3.1.  What charset to use\n   All protocols MUST identify, for all character\
    \ data, which charset is\n   in use.\n   Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8\
    \ charset, which consists of\n   the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with\
    \ the UTF-8 character\n   encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R (published\
    \ in\n   Amendment 2), for all text.\n   Protocols MAY specify, in addition, how\
    \ to use other charsets or\n   other character encoding schemes for ISO 10646,\
    \ such as UTF-16, but\n   lack of an ability to use UTF-8 is a violation of this\
    \ policy; such a\n   violation would need a variance procedure ([BCP9] section\
    \ 9) with\n   clear and solid justification in the protocol specification document\n\
    \   before being entered into or advanced upon the standards track.\n   For existing\
    \ protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n   datastores, support\
    \ of other charsets, or even using a default other\n   than UTF-8, may be a requirement.\
    \ This is acceptable, but UTF-8\n   support MUST be possible.\n   When using other\
    \ charsets than UTF-8, these MUST be registered in the\n   IANA charset registry,\
    \ if necessary by registering them when the\n   protocol is published.\n   (Note:\
    \ ISO 10646 calls the UTF-8 CES a \"Transformation Format\" rather\n   than a\
    \ \"character encoding scheme\", but it fits the charset workshop\n   report definition\
    \ of a character encoding scheme).\n"
- title: 3.2.  How to decide a charset
  contents:
  - "3.2.  How to decide a charset\n   When the protocol allows a choice of multiple\
    \ charsets, someone must\n   make a decision on which charset to use.\n   In some\
    \ cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n   communication between the\
    \ producer and the consumer of data\n   containing text. In such cases, it may\
    \ make sense to negotiate a\n   charset before sending data.\n   In other cases,\
    \ like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n   communication, and the best\
    \ one can do is to make sure the charset is\n   clearly identified with the stored\
    \ data, and choosing a charset that\n   is as widely known as possible.\n   Note\
    \ that a charset is an absolute; text that is encoded in a charset\n   cannot\
    \ be rendered comprehensibly without supporting that charset.\n   (This also applies\
    \ to English texts; charsets like EBCDIC do NOT have\n   ASCII as a proper subset)\n\
    \   Negotiating a charset may be regarded as an interim mechanism that is\n  \
    \ to be supported until support for interchange of UTF-8 is prevalent;\n   however,\
    \ the timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50 years, so\n   there is every\
    \ reason to think of it as permanent in practice.\n"

- title: 4.1.  The need for language information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The need for language information\n   All human-readable text has a language.\n\
    \   Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n   synthesis,\
    \ searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on benefit\n   greatly from access\
    \ to information about the language of a piece of\n   text. [WC 3.1.1.4].\n  \
    \ Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are generally\n   very\
    \ unhappy with being presented text in a language they do not\n   understand;\
    \ this is why negotiation of language is needed.\n   In most cases, machines will\
    \ not be able to deduce the language of a\n   transmitted text by themselves;\
    \ the protocol must specify how to\n   transfer the language information if it\
    \ is to be available at all.\n   The interaction between language and processing\
    \ is complex; for\n   instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"\
    name-of-\n   thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match, while\n\
    \   the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful as a\n   command\
    \ verb.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Requirement for language tagging
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n   Protocols that transfer text MUST\
    \ provide for carrying information\n   about the language of that text.\n   Protocols\
    \ SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n   language of names,\
    \ where appropriate.\n   Note that this does NOT mean that such information must\
    \ always be\n   present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\
    \ wishes\n   to send information about the language of a text, the protocol\n\
    \   provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n"
- title: 4.3.  How to identify a language
  contents:
  - "4.3.  How to identify a language\n   The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment\
    \ the most flexible tool\n   available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD\
    \ use this, or\n   provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\
    \ the\n   document.\n   Note also that a language is distinct from a POSIX locale;\
    \ a POSIX\n   locale identifies a set of cultural conventions, which may imply\
    \ a\n   language (the POSIX or \"C\" locale of course do not), while a language\n\
    \   tag as described in RFC 1766 identifies only a language.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Considerations for language negotiation
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Considerations for language negotiation\n   Protocols where users have\
    \ text presented to them in response to user\n   actions MUST provide for support\
    \ of multiple languages.\n   How this is done will vary between protocols; for\
    \ instance, in some\n   cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\
    \ languages and\n   the server replies with one is appropriate; in other cases,\
    \ a server\n   may choose to send multiple variants of a text and let the client\n\
    \   pick which one to display.\n   Negotiation is useful in the case where one\
    \ side of the protocol\n   exchange is able to present text in multiple languages\
    \ to the other\n   side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\
    \ the most\n   common example is the text part of error responses, or Web pages\
    \ that\n   are available in multiple languages.\n   Negotiating a language should\
    \ be regarded as a permanent requirement\n   of the protocol that will not go\
    \ away at any time in the future.\n   In many cases, it should be possible to\
    \ include it as part of the\n   connection establishment, together with authentication\
    \ and other\n   preferences negotiation.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Default Language
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Default Language\n   When human-readable text must be presented in a context\
    \ where the\n   sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\
    \ (such\n   as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n   negotiation),\
    \ text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n   Default Language is assigned\
    \ the tag \"i-default\" according to the\n   procedures of RFC 1766. It is not\
    \ a specific language, but rather\n   identifies the condition where the language\
    \ preferences of the user\n   cannot be established.\n   Messages in Default Language\
    \ MUST be understandable by an English-\n   speaking person, since English is\
    \ the language which, worldwide, the\n   greatest number of people will be able\
    \ to get adequate help in\n   interpreting when working with computers.\n   Note\
    \ that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n   Default Language\
    \ is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n   situations.\n   In many\
    \ cases, using only English text is reasonable; in some cases,\n   the English\
    \ text may be augumented by text in other languages.\n"
- title: 5.  Locale
  contents:
  - "5.  Locale\n   The POSIX standard [POSIX] defines a concept called a \"locale\"\
    , which\n   includes a lot of information about collating order for sorting, date\n\
    \   format, currency format and so on.\n   In some cases, and especially with\
    \ text where the user is expected to\n   do processing on the text, locale information\
    \ may be usefully\n   attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\
    \ about\n   appropriate rules to follow when processing the document, which the\n\
    \   recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n   This document does not require\
    \ the communication of locale\n   information on all text, but encourages its\
    \ inclusion when\n   appropriate.\n   Note that language and character set information\
    \ will often be\n   present as parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1;\
    \ the\n   language is before the underscore and the character set is after the\n\
    \   dot); care must be taken to define precisely which specification of\n   character\
    \ set and language applies to any one text item.\n   The default locale is the\
    \ \"POSIX\" locale.\n"
- title: 6.  Documenting internationalization decisions
  contents:
  - "6.  Documenting internationalization decisions\n   In documents that deal with\
    \ internationalization issues at all, a\n   synopsis of the approaches chosen\
    \ for internationalization SHOULD be\n   collected into a section called \"Internationalization\n\
    \   considerations\", and placed next to the Security Considerations\n   section.\n\
    \   This provides an easy reference for those who are looking for advice\n   on\
    \ these issues when implementing the protocol.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Apart from the fact that security warnings in\
    \ a foreign language may\n   cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and\
    \ the fact that\n   multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\
    \ between\n   language variants, no security considerations relevant have been\n\
    \   identified.\n"
