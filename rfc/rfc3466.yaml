  - "1. Introduction\n   Content networks are of increasing importance to the overall\n\
    \   architecture of the Web.  This document presents a vocabulary for use\n  \
    \ in developing technology for interconnecting content networks, or\n   \"content\
    \ internetworking\".\n   The accepted name for the technology of interconnecting\
    \ content\n   networks is \"content internetworking\".  For historical reasons,\
    \ we\n   abbreviate this term using the acronym CDI (from \"content\n   distribution\
    \ internetworking\").  Earlier names relied on analogy with\n   peering and interconnection\
    \ of IP networks; thus we had \"content\n   peering\" and \"CDN peering\".  All\
    \ of these other names are now\n   deprecated, and we have worked to establish\
    \ consistent usage of\n   \"content internetworking\" and \"CDI\" throughout the\
    \ documents of the\n   IETF CDI group.\n   The terminology in this document builds\
    \ from the previous taxonomy of\n   web caching and replication in RFC 3040 [3].\
    \  In particular, we have\n   attempted to avoid the use of the common terms \"\
    proxies\" or \"caches\"\n   in favor of more specific terms defined by that document,\
    \ such as\n   \"caching proxy\".\n   Section 2 provides background on content\
    \ networks.  Section 3\n   introduces the terms used for elements of a content\
    \ network and\n   explains how those terms are used.  Section 4 provides additional\n\
    \   background on interconnecting content networks, following which\n   Section\
    \ 5 introduces additional terms and explains how those\n   internetworking terms\
    \ are used.\n"
- title: 2. Content Networks
  contents:
  - "2. Content Networks\n   The past several years have seen the evolution of technologies\n\
    \   centered around \"content\".  Protocols, appliances, and entire markets\n\
    \   have been created exclusively for the location, download, and usage\n   tracking\
    \ of content.  Some sample technologies in this area have\n   included web caching\
    \ proxies, content management tools, intelligent\n   \"web switches\", and advanced\
    \ log analysis tools.\n   When used together, these tools form new types of networks,\
    \ dubbed\n   \"content networks\".  Whereas network infrastructures have\n   traditionally\
    \ processed information at layers 1 through 3 of the OSI\n   stack, content networks\
    \ include network infrastructure that exists in\n   layers 4 through 7.  Whereas\
    \ lower-layer network infrastructures\n   centered on the routing, forwarding,\
    \ and switching of frames and\n   packets, content networks deal with the routing\
    \ and forwarding of\n   requests and responses for content.  The units of transported\
    \ data in\n   content networks, such as images, movies, or songs, are often very\n\
    \   large and may span hundreds or thousands of packets.\n   Alternately, content\
    \ networks can be seen as a new virtual overlay to\n   the OSI stack: a \"content\
    \ layer\", to enable richer services that rely\n   on underlying elements from\
    \ all 7 layers of the stack.  Whereas\n   traditional applications, such as file\
    \ transfer (FTP), relied on\n   underlying protocols such as TCP/IP for transport,\
    \ overlay services\n   in content networks rely on layer 7 protocols such as HTTP\
    \ or RTSP\n   for transport.\n   The proliferation of content networks and content\
    \ networking\n   capabilities gives rise to interest in interconnecting content\n\
    \   networks and finding ways for distinct content networks to cooperate\n   for\
    \ better overall service.\n"
- title: 2.1 Problem Description
  contents:
  - "2.1 Problem Description\n   Content networks typically play some role in solving\
    \ the \"content\n   distribution problem\".  Abstractly, the goal in solving this\
    \ problem\n   is to arrange a rendezvous between a content source at an origin\n\
    \   server and a content sink at a viewer's user agent.  In the trivial\n   case,\
    \ the rendezvous mechanism is that every user agent sends every\n   request directly\
    \ to the origin server named in the host part of the\n   URL identifying the content.\n\
    \   As the audience for the content source grows, so do the demands on\n   the\
    \ origin server.  There are a variety of ways in which the trivial\n   system\
    \ can be modified for better performance.  The apparent single\n   logical server\
    \ may in fact be implemented as a large \"farm\" of server\n   machines behind\
    \ a switch.  Both caching proxies and reverse caching\n   proxies can be deployed\
    \ between the client and server, so that\n   requests can be satisfied by some\
    \ cache instead of by the server.\n   For the sake of background, several sample\
    \ content networks are\n   described in the following sections that each attempt\
    \ to address this\n   problem.\n"
- title: 2.2 Caching Proxies
  contents:
  - "2.2 Caching Proxies\n   A type of content network that has been in use for several\
    \ years is a\n   caching proxy deployment.  Such a network might typically be\
    \ employed\n   by an ISP for the benefit of users accessing the Internet, such\
    \ as\n   through dial or cable modem.\n   In the interest of improving performance\
    \ and reducing bandwidth\n   utilization, caching proxies are deployed close to\
    \ the users.  These\n   users are encouraged to send their web requests through\
    \ the caches\n   rather than directly to origin servers, such as by configuring\
    \ their\n   browsers to do so.  When this configuration is properly done, the\n\
    \   user's entire browsing session goes through a specific caching proxy.\n  \
    \ That caching proxy will therefore contain the \"hot set\" of all\n   Internet\
    \ content being viewed by all of the users of that caching\n   proxy.\n   When\
    \ a request is being handled at a caching proxy on behalf of a\n   user, other\
    \ decisions may be made, such as:\n   o  A provider that deploys caches in many\
    \ geographically diverse\n      locations may also deploy regional parent caches\
    \ to further\n      aggregate user requests and responses.  This may provide\n\
    \      additional performance improvement and bandwidth savings.  When\n     \
    \ parents are included, this is known as hierarchical caching.\n   o  Using rich\
    \ parenting protocols, redundant parents may be deployed\n      such that a failure\
    \ in a primary parent is detected and a backup\n      is used instead.\n   o \
    \ Using similar parenting protocols, requests may be partitioned\n      such that\
    \ requests for certain content domains are sent to a\n      specific primary parent.\
    \  This can help to maximize the efficient\n      use of caching proxy resources.\n\
    \   The following diagram depicts a hierarchical cache deployment as\n   described\
    \ above:\n                     ^        ^\n                     |        |   requests\

    \ --------\n                       |client|\n                       --------\n\
    \   Note that this diagram shows only one possible configuration, but\n   many\
    \ others are also useful.  In particular, the client may be able\n   to communicate\
    \ directly with multiple caching proxies.  RFC 3040 [3]\n   contains additional\
    \ examples of how multiple caching proxies may be\n   used.\n"
- title: 2.3 Server Farms
  contents:
  - "2.3 Server Farms\n   Another type of content network that has been in widespread\
    \ use for\n   several years is a server farm.  A typical server farm makes use\
    \ of a\n   so-called \"intelligent\" or \"content\" switch (i.e., one that uses\n\
    \   information in OSI layers 4-7).  The switch examines content requests\n  \
    \ and dispatches them among a (potentially large) group of servers.\n   Some of\
    \ the goals of a server farm include:\n   o  Creating the impression that the\
    \ group of servers is actually a\n      single origin site.\n   o  Load-balancing\
    \ of requests across all servers in the group.\n   o  Automatic routing of requests\
    \ away from servers that fail.\n   o  Routing all requests for a particular user\
    \ agent's session to the\n      same server, in order to preserve session state.\n\
    \   The following diagram depicts a simple server farm deployment:\n      ---------\

    \ from     request from\n               client A         client B\n   A similar\
    \ style of content network (that is, deployed close to\n   servers) may be constructed\
    \ with surrogates [3] instead of a switch.\n"
- title: 2.4 Content Distribution Networks
  contents:
  - "2.4 Content Distribution Networks\n   Both hierarchical caching and server farms\
    \ are useful techniques, but\n   have limits.  Server farms can improve the scalability\
    \ of the origin\n   server.  However, since the multiple servers and other elements\
    \ are\n   typically deployed near the origin server, they do little to improve\n\
    \   performance problems that are due to network congestion.  Caching\n   proxies\
    \ can improve performance problems due to network congestion\n   (since they are\
    \ situated near the clients) but they cache objects\n   based on client demand.\
    \  Caching based on client demand performs\n   poorly if the requests for a given\
    \ object, while numerous in\n   aggregate, are spread thinly among many different\
    \ caching proxies.\n   (In the worst case, an object could be requested n times\
    \ via n\n   distinct caching proxies, causing n distinct requests to the origin\n\
    \   server -- or exactly the same behavior that would occur without any\n   caching\
    \ proxies in place.)\n   Thus, a content provider with a popular content source\
    \ can find that\n   it has to invest in large server farms, load balancing, and\
    \ high-\n   bandwidth connections to keep up with demand.  Even with those\n \
    \  investments, the user experience may still be relatively poor due to\n   congestion\
    \ in the network as a whole.\n   To address these limitations, another type of\
    \ content network that\n   has been deployed in increasing numbers in recent years\
    \ is the CDN\n   (Content Distribution Network or Content Delivery Network). \
    \ A CDN\n   essentially moves server-farm-like configurations out into network\n\
    \   locations more typically occupied by caching proxies.  A CDN has\n   multiple\
    \ replicas of each content item being hosted.  A request from\n   a browser for\
    \ a single content item is directed to a \"good\" replica,\n   where \"good\"\
    \ usually means that the item is served to the client\n   quickly compared to\
    \ the time it would take fetch it from the origin\n   server, with appropriate\
    \ integrity and consistency.  Static\n   information about geographic locations\
    \ and network connectivity is\n   usually not sufficient to do a good job of choosing\
    \ a replica.\n   Instead, a CDN typically incorporates dynamic information about\n\
    \   network conditions and load on the replicas, directing requests so as\n  \
    \ to balance the load.\n   Compared to using servers and surrogates in a single\
    \ data center, a\n   CDN is a relatively complex system encompassing multiple\
    \ points of\n   presence, in locations that may be geographically far apart.\n\
    \   Operating a CDN is not easy for a content provider, since a content\n   provider\
    \ wants to focus its resources on developing high-value\n   content, not on managing\
    \ network infrastructure.  Instead, a more\n   typical arrangement is that a network\
    \ service provider builds and\n   operates a CDN, offering a content distribution\
    \ service to a number\n   of content providers.\n   A CDN enables a service provider\
    \ to act on behalf of the content\n   provider to deliver copies of origin server\
    \ content to clients from\n   multiple diverse locations.  The increase in number\
    \ and diversity of\n   location is intended to improve download times and thus\
    \ improve the\n   user experience.  A CDN has some combination of a content-delivery\n\
    \   infrastructure, a request-routing infrastructure, a distribution\n   infrastructure,\
    \ and an accounting infrastructure.  The content-\n   delivery infrastructure\
    \ consists of a set of \"surrogate\" servers [3]\n   that deliver copies of content\
    \ to sets of users.  The request-routing\n   infrastructure consists of mechanisms\
    \ that move a client toward a\n   rendezvous with a surrogate.  The distribution\
    \ infrastructure\n   consists of mechanisms that move content from the origin\
    \ server to\n   the surrogates.  Finally, the accounting infrastructure tracks\
    \ and\n   collects data on request-routing, distribution, and delivery\n   functions\
    \ within the CDN.\n   The following diagram depicts a simple CDN as described\
    \ above:\n               ----------          ----------\n               |request-|\

  - "2.4.1 Historic Evolution of CDNs\n   The first important use of CDNs was for\
    \ the distribution of heavily-\n   requested graphic files (such as GIF files\
    \ on the home pages of\n   popular servers).  However, both in principle and increasingly\
    \ in\n   practice, a CDN can support the delivery of any digital content --\n\
    \   including various forms of streaming media.  For a streaming media\n   CDN\
    \ (or media distribution network or MDN), the surrogates may be\n   operating\
    \ as splitters (serving out multiple copies of a stream).\n   The splitter function\
    \ may be instead of, or in addition to, a role as\n   a caching proxy.  However,\

  contents:
  - "2.4.2 Describing CDN Value: Scale and Reach\n   There are two fundamental elements\
    \ that give a CDN value: outsourcing\n   infrastructure and improved content delivery.\
    \  A CDN allows multiple\n   surrogates to act on behalf of an origin server,\
    \ therefore removing\n   the delivery of content from a centralized site to multiple\
    \ and\n   (usually) highly distributed sites.  We refer to increased aggregate\n\
    \   infrastructure size as \"scale\".  In addition, a CDN can be\n   constructed\
    \ with copies of content near to end users, overcoming\n   issues of network size,\
    \ network congestion, and network failures.  We\n   refer to increased diversity\
    \ of content locations as \"reach\".\n   In a typical (non-internetworked) CDN,\
    \ a single service provider\n   operates the request-routers, the surrogates,\
    \ and the content\n   distributors.  In addition, that service provider establishes\n\
    \   (business) relationships with content publishers and acts on behalf\n   of\

    \ CONTINUOUS MEDIA.\n   CONTENT NETWORK\n      An arrangement of CONTENT NETWORK\
    \ ELEMENTS, controlled by a common\n      management in some fashion.\n   CONTENT\
    \ NETWORK ELEMENT\n      A network device that performs at least some of its processing\
    \ by\n      examining CONTENT-related parts of network messages.  In IP-based\n\
    \      networks, a CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENT is a device whose processing\n    \
    \  depends on examining information contained in IP packet bodies;\n      network\
    \ elements (as defined in RFC 3040) examine only the header\n      of an IP packet.\
    \  Note that many CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS do not\n      examine or even see individual\
    \ IP packets, instead receiving the\n      body of one or more packets assembled\
    \ into a message of some\n      higher-level protocol.\n   CONTENT REQUEST\n \
    \     A message identifying a particular item of CONTENT to be\n      delivered.\n\
    \   CONTENT RESPONSE\n      A message containing a particular item of CONTENT,\
    \ identified in a\n      previous CONTENT REQUEST.\n   CONTENT SIGNAL\n      A\
    \ message delivered through a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that specifies\n      information\
    \ about an item of CONTENT.  For example, a CONTENT\n      SIGNAL can indicate\
    \ that the ORIGIN has a new version of some\n      piece of CONTENT.\n   CONTINUOUS\
    \ MEDIA\n      CONTENT where there is a timing relationship between source and\n\
    \      sink; that is, the sink must reproduce the timing relationship\n      that\
    \ existed at the source.  The most common examples of\n      CONTINUOUS MEDIA\
    \ are audio and motion video.  CONTINUOUS MEDIA can\n      be real-time (interactive),\
    \ where there is a \"tight\" timing\n      relationship between source and sink,\
    \ or streaming (playback),\n      where the relationship is less strict.  [Note:\
    \ This definition is\n      essentially identical to the definition of continuous\
    \ media in\n      [2]]\n   DELIVERY\n      The activity of providing a PUBLISHER's\
    \ CONTENT, via CONTENT\n      RESPONSES, to a CLIENT.  Contrast with DISTRIBUTION\
    \ and REQUEST-\n      ROUTING.\n   DISTRIBUTION\n      The activity of moving\
    \ a PUBLISHER's CONTENT from its ORIGIN to\n      one or more SURROGATEs.  DISTRIBUTION\
    \ can happen either in\n      anticipation of a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST\
    \ (pre-positioning)\n      or in response to a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST (fetching\
    \ on\n      demand).  Contrast with DELIVERY and REQUEST-ROUTING.\n   DISTRIBUTION\
    \ SYSTEM\n      A collection of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS that support DISTRIBUTION\n\
    \      for a single CONTENT NETWORK.  The DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM also\n      propagates\
    \ CONTENT SIGNALs.\n   ORIGIN\n      The point at which CONTENT first enters a\
    \ DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.\n      The ORIGIN for any item of CONTENT is the server\
    \ or set of servers\n      at the \"core\" of the distribution, holding the \"\
    master\" or\n      \"authoritative\" copy of that CONTENT.  (Note: We believe\
    \ this\n      definition is compatible with that for \"origin server\" in RFC\
    \ 2616\n      [1] but includes additional constraints useful for CDI.)\n   PUBLISHER\n\
    \      The party that ultimately controls the CONTENT and its\n      distribution.\n\
    \   REACHABLE SURROGATES\n      The collection of SURROGATES that can be contacted\
    \ via a\n      particular DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM or REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM.\n   REQUEST-ROUTING\n\
    \      The activity of steering or directing a CONTENT REQUEST from a\n      USER\
    \ AGENT to a suitable SURROGATE.\n   REQUEST-ROUTING SYSTEM\n      A collection\
    \ of CONTENT NETWORK ELEMENTS that support REQUEST-\n      ROUTING for a single\
    \ CONTENT NETWORK.\n   SERVER\n      A program that accepts CONTENT REQUESTS and\
    \ services them by\n      sending back CONTENT RESPONSES.  Any given program may\
    \ be capable\n      of being both a client and a server; our use of these terms\
    \ refers\n      only to the role being performed by the program.  [Note: this\
    \ is\n      adapted from a similar definition in RFC 2616 [1].]\n   SURROGATE\n\
    \      A delivery server, other than the ORIGIN.  Receives a CONTENT\n      REQUEST\
    \ and delivers the corresponding CONTENT RESPONSE.  [Note:\n      this is a different\
    \ definition from that in RFC 3040 [3], which\n      appears overly elaborate\
    \ for our purposes.  A \"CDI surrogate\" is\n      always an \"RFC 3040 surrogate\"\
    ; we are not sure if the reverse is\n      true.]\n   USER AGENT\n      The CLIENT\
    \ which initiates a REQUEST.  These are often browsers,\n      editors, spiders\
    \ (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.\n      [Note: this definition\
    \ is identical to the one in RFC 2616 [1].]\n"
- title: 4. Content Internetworking
  contents:
  - "4. Content Internetworking\n   There are limits to how large any one network's\
    \ scale and reach can\n   be.  Increasing either scale or reach is ultimately\
    \ limited by the\n   cost of equipment, the space available for deploying equipment,\n\
    \   and/or the demand for that scale/reach of infrastructure.  Sometimes\n   a\
    \ particular audience is tied to a single service provider or a small\n   set\
    \ of providers by constraints of technology, economics, or law.\n   Other times,\
    \ a network provider may be able to manage surrogates and\n   a distribution system,\
    \ but may have no direct relationship with\n   content providers.  Such a provider\
    \ wants to have a means of\n   affiliating their delivery and distribution infrastructure\
    \ with other\n   parties who have content to distribute.\n   Content internetworking\
    \ allows different content networks to share\n   resources so as to provide larger\
    \ scale and/or reach to each\n   participant than they could otherwise achieve.\
    \  By using commonly\n   defined protocols for content internetworking, each content\
    \ network\n   can treat neighboring content networks as \"black boxes\", allowing\n\
    \   them to hide internal details from each other.\n"

  - "5. Content Internetworking Model Terms\n   This section consists of the definitions\
    \ of a number of terms used to\n   refer to roles, participants, and objects involved\
    \ in internetworking\n   content networks.  The purpose of this section is to\
    \ identify common\n   terms and provide short definitions.\n   ACCOUNTING INTERNETWORKING\n\
    \      Interconnection of two or more ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS so as to enable\n   \
    \   the exchange of information between them.  The form of ACCOUNTING\n      INTERNETWORKING\
    \ required may depend on the nature of the\n      NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP between\
    \ the peering parties -- in\n      particular, on the value of the economic exchanges\
    \ anticipated.\n   ADVERTISEMENT\n      Information about resources available\

    \      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CONTENT NETWORK's DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM to\n    \
    \  potential CONTENT SOURCES, describing the capabilities of one or\n      more\
    \ CONTENT DESTINATIONS.  Contrast with AREA ADVERTISEMENT,\n      CONTENT ADVERTISEMENT.\n\
    \   DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING\n      Interconnection of two or more DISTRIBUTION\
    \ SYSTEMS so as to\n      propagate CONTENT SIGNALS and copies of CONTENT to groups\

    \ behalf\n      of another CONTENT NETWORK, or has agreed to provide ACCOUNTING\n\
    \      data to another CONTENT NETWORK.  Contrast with ORIGINATING.\n   INJECTION\n\
    \      A \"send-only\" form of DISTRIBUTION INTERNETWORKING that takes\n     \
    \ place from an ORIGIN to a CONTENT DESTINATION.\n   INTER-\n      Describes activity\
    \ that involves more than one CONTENT NETWORK\n      (e.g., INTER-CDN).  Contrast\
    \ with INTRA-.\n   INTRA-\n      Describes activity within a single CONTENT NETWORK\
    \ (e.g., INTRA-\n      CDN).  Contrast with INTER-.\n   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP\n\
    \      A relationship whose terms and conditions are partially or\n      completely\
    \ established outside the context of CONTENT NETWORK\n      internetworking protocols.\n\
    \   ORIGINATING\n      Describes a CONTENT NETWORK that, as part of a NEGOTIATED\n\
    \      RELATIONSHIP, submits a DISTRIBUTION task to another CONTENT\n      NETWORK,\
    \ asks another CONTENT NETWORK to perform REQUEST-ROUTING\n      on its behalf,\

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This document defines terminology and concepts\
    \ for content\n   internetworking.  The terminology itself does not introduce\
    \ any\n   security-related issues.  The implementation of content\n   internetworking\
    \ concepts does raise some security-related issues,\n   which we identify in broad\
    \ categories below.  Other CDI documents\n   will address their specific security-related\
    \ issues in more detail.\n   Secure relationship establishment: CONTENT INTERNETWORKING\
    \ GATEWAYS\n   must ensure that CONTENT NETWORKS are internetworking only with\
    \ other\n   CONTENT NETWORKS as intended.  It must be possible to prevent\n  \
    \ unauthorized internetworking or spoofing of another CONTENT NETWORK's\n   identity.\n\
    \   Secure content transfer: CONTENT INTERNETWORKING GATEWAYS must\n   support\
    \ CONTENT NETWORK mechanisms that ensure both the integrity of\n   CONTENT and\
    \ the integrity of both DISTRIBUTION and DELIVERY, even\n   when both ORIGINATING\
    \ and ENLISTED networks are involved.  CONTENT\n   INTERNETWORKING GATEWAYS must\
    \ allow for mechanisms to prevent theft\n   or corruption of CONTENT.\n   Secure\
    \ meta-content transfer: CONTENT INTERNETWORKING GATEWAYS must\n   support the\
    \ movement of accurate, reliable, auditable ACCOUNTING\n   information between\
    \ CONTENT NETWORKS.  CONTENT INTERNETWORKING\n   GATEWAYS must allow for mechanisms\
    \ to prevent the diversion or\n   corruption of ACCOUNTING data and similar meta-content.\n"
