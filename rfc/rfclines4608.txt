Abstract IP Multicast group addresses in the 232/8
to 232.255.255.255) range are designated as source specific multicast destination addresses and are reserved for use by source specific multicast applications and protocols.
This document defines operational recommendations to ensure source specific behavior within the 232/8 range.
Introduction Current Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM SM)
[RFC4601] relies on the shared Rendezvous Point (RP) tree to learn about active sources for a group and to support group generic (Any Source Multicast or ASM) data distribution.
The IP Multicast group address range 232/8 has been designated for Source Specific Multicast [RFC3569] applications and protocols [IANA] and SHOULD support source only trees only, precluding the requirement of an RP and a shared tree; active sources in the 232/8 range will be discovered out of band.
PIM Sparse Mode Designated Routers (DR) with local membership are capable of joining the shortest path tree for the source directly using SSM functionality of PIM SM.
Operational best common practices in the 232/8 group address range are necessary to ensure
shortest path source only trees across multiple domains in the Internet [RFC3569], and to prevent data from sources sending to groups in the 232/8 range from arriving via shared trees.
This avoids unwanted data arrival and allows several sources to use the same group address without conflict at the receivers.
Prevent local sources from sending to shared tree  Prevent receivers from joining the shared tree  Prevent RPs as candidates for 232/8  Prevent remote sources from being learned/
joined via Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) [RFC3618] 2.
Operational practices in 232/8 2.1.
Preventing Local Sources from Sending to Shared Tree
In order to eliminate the use of shared trees for groups in 232/8, while maintaining coexistence with ASM in PIM SM, the behavior of the RP and/or the DR needs to be modified.
This can be accomplished by  preventing data for 232/8 groups from being sent encapsulated to the RP by the DR,  preventing the RP from accepting registers for 232/8 groups from the DR, and  preventing the RP from forwarding accepted data down ( ,G) tree for 232/8 groups.
Preventing Remote Sources from Being Learned
/Joined via MSDP SSM does not require active source announcements via MSDP.
All source announcements are received out of band, and the last hop router is responsible for sending (S,G) joins directly to the source.
To prevent propagation of SAs in the 232/8 range, an RP SHOULD  never originate an SA for any 232/8 groups, and  never accept or forward an SA for any 232/8 groups.
Preventing Receivers from Joining the Shared Tree Local PIM domain practices need to be enforced to prevent local receivers from joining the shared tree for 232/8 groups.
This can be accomplished by  preventing DR from sending ( ,G)
joins for 232/8 groups, and  preventing RP from accepting ( ,G) join for 232/8 groups.
However, within a local PIM domain, any last hop router NOT preventing ( ,G) joins may trigger unwanted ( ,G) state toward the RP that intersects an existing (S,G) tree, allowing the receiver on the shared tree to receive the data, which breaks the source specific [RFC3569] service model.
It is therefore recommended that ALL routers in the domain MUST reject AND never originate ( ,G) joins for 232/8 groups.
In those cases in which an ISP is offering its customers (or others) the use of the ISP's RP, the ISP SHOULD NOT allow ( ,G) joins in the 232/8 range.
Preventing RPs as Candidates for 232/8 Because SSM does not require an RP, all RPs SHOULD NOT offer themselves as candidates in the 232/8 range.
This can be accomplished by  preventing RP/BSR from announcing in the 232/8 range,  preventing ALL routers from accepting RP delegations in the 232/8 range, and  precluding RP functionality on RP for the 232/8 range.
Note that in typical practice, RPs announce themselves as candidates for the 224/4 (which obviously includes 232/8).
It is still acceptable to allow the advertisement of 224/4 (or any other superset of 232/8); however, this approach relies on the second point, above; namely, that routers silently ignore the RP delegation in the 232/8 range and prevent sending or receiving using the shared tree, as described previously.
Finally, an RP SHOULD NOT be configured as a candidate RP for 232/8 (or for a more specific range).
This document describes operational practices that introduce no new security issues to PIM SM
[RFC4601] in either or SSM [RFC3569] or ASM operation.
However, in the event that the operational practices described in this document are not adhered to, some problems may surface.
In particular, Section 2.3 describes the effects of non compliance of last hop routers (or, to some degree, rogue hosts sending PIM messages themselves) on the source specific service model.
Creating the ( ,G) state for source specific (S,G) could enable a receiver to receive data it should not get.
This can be mitigated by host side multicast source filtering.
