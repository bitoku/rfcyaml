  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the course of developing Internet standards, the IETF\
    \ needs to\n   communicate extensively with various other peer organizations,\n\
    \   including the following:\n   o  Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)\
    \ such as the\n      Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International\n\
    \      Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) or standardization working groups\n   \
    \   of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (e.g.,\n      IEEE\
    \ 802)\n   o  Consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n   o  Industrial\
    \ forums such as the Global Grid Forum (GGF)\n   These organizations are usually\
    \ concerned with developing related\n   standards and technical specifications,\
    \ so that from time to time\n   issues of coordination and mutual interest may\
    \ arise.  To facilitate\n   communications, the IETF, through the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board\n   (IAB), establishes permanent liaison relationships with appropriate\n\
    \   parts of these organizations according to the processes described in\n   RFC\
    \ 4052 [RFC4052].\n   Whenever the IETF decides to enter into a liaison relationship,\
    \ a\n   liaison manager and possibly some liaison representatives are\n   appointed\
    \ by the IAB to act as a channel between the IETF and the\n   peer organization,\
    \ typically in tandem with counterparts appointed by\n   the peer organization.\n\
    \   Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 3 of RFC 4052 briefly set out the basic\n   functions\
    \ of the tasks of liaison managers and representatives.  Over\n   time, the number\
    \ and importance of liaisons have grown, and the\n   importance of the personal\
    \ role of IETF liaison managers and\n   representatives in maintaining effective\
    \ relationships with peer\n   organizations has grown concomitantly.  This document\
    \ supplements\n   [RFC4052] by providing guidelines for liaison managers and liaison\n\
    \   representatives in maintaining communications to peer organizations.\n"
- title: 2.  IETF Liaison Relationships
  contents:
  - "2.  IETF Liaison Relationships\n   A major goal of the IETF is to develop standards\
    \ for the Internet,\n   enabling the development of interoperable implementations.\
    \  In order\n   to develop Internet standards, it is frequently necessary for\
    \ the\n   IETF to communicate with other organizations that develop standards\n\
    \   for other types of networks, for Internet applications, or for\n   technologies\
    \ that the Internet uses.\n   In some cases, the IETF and peer organizations consider\
    \ it mutually\n   beneficial to have a permanent formal relationship with certain\
    \ rules\n   governing the relationship.  The organizations then enter into a\n\
    \   \"liaison relationship\".  At a high level, both sides agree to\n   undertake\
    \ certain responsibilities with respect to each other.  The\n   most basic liaison\
    \ responsibility is to communicate information as\n   necessary, and to respond\
    \ to requests from peer organizations to\n   which liaisons are maintained.\n\
    \   Decisions on IETF liaison relationships are the responsibility of the\n  \
    \ IAB.  This includes whether or not the IETF should have a liaison\n   relationship\
    \ with a particular organization.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Related Documents
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Related Documents\n   The IETF liaison process is specified in several\
    \ documents.  RFC 4052\n   [RFC4052] specifies how the IAB manages the IETF liaison\n\
    \   relationship; RFC 4053 [RFC4053] specifies how liaison statements\n   should\
    \ be treated.  Organization-specific agreements and documents\n   may also be\
    \ generated in some cases, e.g., RFC 3356 [RFC3356]\n   describes the collaboration\
    \ between the IETF and ITU-T, RFC 3113\n   [RFC3113] describes the relationship\
    \ with the 3rd Generation\n   Partnership Project (3GPP), and RFC 3131 [RFC3131]\
    \ describes the one\n   with the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Liaison Managers and Liaison Representatives
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Liaison Managers and Liaison Representatives\n   Whenever the IETF enters\
    \ into a liaison relationship with another\n   organization, a liaison manager\
    \ (often referred to as \"the IETF\n   liaison\") is appointed by the IAB.  This\
    \ document expands on the\n   mandate of and the expectations, tasks, and responsibilities\
    \ placed\n   on the liaison manager by Section 2.2 of RFC 4052.\n   In some cases,\
    \ it may be necessary to have more than one person\n   handling the liaison relationship\
    \ with a given organization.  For\n   example, the time commitment required may\
    \ be too substantial, or the\n   technical scope of the liaison relationship may\
    \ be too broad to be\n   handled by a single individual.\n   In such cases, the\
    \ IAB may appoint one or more liaison\n   representatives to supplement the work\
    \ of the liaison manager by\n   managing different aspects of the liaison relationship\
    \ between the\n   IETF and the other organization.\n   The value of personal relationships\
    \ between the IETF liaison manager\n   and representatives and members of the\
    \ peer organization is central\n   to the roles.  The IAB will be looking for\
    \ people who have both a\n   good technical understanding of the work being carried\
    \ out and\n   effective personal relationships within the peer organization.\n\
    \   Ongoing face-to-face interactions between the IETF liaisons and\n   members\
    \ of the peer organization are seen as critical to the\n   effective functioning\
    \ of the role.  These interactions should allow\n   the liaisons to keep the IETF\
    \ abreast, and preferably ahead, of\n   matters of mutual interest or potential\
    \ conflict.  When the liaison\n   is working effectively, it should facilitate\
    \ the IETF and the peer\n   organization working synergistically and reduce the\
    \ chance of\n   overlapping or conflicting standards being created.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Written Communications
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Written Communications\n   Aside from the personal contacts between liaisons\
    \ and the peer\n   organization, extensive communication may occur between the\
    \ IETF and\n   the peer organizations through written materials.  Much of this\n\
    \   communication is through liaison statements that typically contain\n   plans,\
    \ new developments, and time schedules of which one party\n   believes that the\
    \ other party should be aware.\n   The liaison manager should be aware of these\
    \ written communications\n   and assist both parties to see that appropriate action\
    \ is taken in\n   relation to liaison statements passing in both directions.\n\
    \   For example, when a liaison organization, such as ITU-T, needs to\n   reference\
    \ material that is under development in the IETF: the final\n   reference in the\
    \ peer organization's document needs the permanent\n   identifier (RFC number)\
    \ that will be assigned to the Internet Draft\n   when it is approved and published.\
    \  To meet the publication schedule\n   of the peer organization, a liaison statement\
    \ is often sent to the\n   IETF requesting that an RFC number be assigned within\
    \ the required\n   timeframe.  In response, the IETF can provide the RFC number\
    \ or\n   explain why it is not possible to provide this within the timeframe\n\
    \   requested.\n   An alternative situation that involves more specific action\
    \ by the\n   liaison manager also involves requests for this kind of expedited\n\
    \   action on RFCs.  For example, 3GPP/3GPP2 and the Open Mobile Alliance\n  \
    \ (OMA) provide the IETF with an updated list of dependencies between\n   their\
    \ documents and IETF documents on a monthly basis, indicating\n   what documents\
    \ are needed and the required timeframe.  In this case,\n   the liaison manager\
    \ tracks the dependency list and, when necessary,\n   conveys the request for\
    \ expedited assignment to the appropriate IETF\n   Area Director (AD).\n"

- title: 3.  Guidelines for Liaison Managers and Representatives
  contents:
  - "3.  Guidelines for Liaison Managers and Representatives\n   Since liaison relationships\
    \ are intended to be mutually beneficial,\n   the IETF liaison to another organization\
    \ must act as a bi-directional\n   communication link between the IETF and the\
    \ other organization.\n   Since the liaison manager has been appointed by the\
    \ IETF, the liaison\n   manager needs to be responsive to the needs and aims of\
    \ the IETF.\n   RFC 4052 lists some of the tasks and expectations relating to\
    \ liaison\n   managers and liaison representatives.  This document expands on\
    \ their\n   mandate, provides more detailed discussion, and describes how the\n\
    \   role is executed.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Mandate
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Mandate\n   The mandate for IETF liaison managers is strictly limited to\n\
    \   conveying IETF consensus to the liaised organization.  The liaison\n   manager\
    \ MUST NOT on their own initiative send liaison statements to a\n   liaised organization\
    \ on behalf of IETF, or any of its areas and\n   working groups.  Liaison statements\
    \ are only sent following the\n   process specified in [RFC4052].  Liaison statements\
    \ are only sent on\n   the initiative of the IETF chair, the IAB chair, IETF Area\
    \ Directors,\n   or IETF working group chairs.\n   In Section 3.3 and Section\
    \ 3.4, responsibilities and tasks are listed\n   that enable the IETF to obtain\
    \ the information to correctly interact\n   with the liaised organizations and\
    \ to develop and clearly communicate\n   IETF consensus.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Speaking for the IETF
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Speaking for the IETF\n   The IETF functions based on rough consensus,\
    \ which means that the\n   right to speak for the IETF cannot be delegated.  The\
    \ liaison manager\n   speaks on behalf of the IETF on the subject matter of the\
    \ liaison,\n   but only after making sure that the IETF consensus is understood.\n\
    \   Some guidelines for understanding IETF consensus are provided above;\n   however,\
    \ the most important requirement is close and detailed\n   coordination/consultation\
    \ with the IETF community.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Expectations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Expectations\n   There are certain expectations placed on liaison managers\
    \ appointed\n   by the IETF.  Examples of these expectations are listed below.\n\
    \   Competences required\n      The key competence needed in the liaison manager\
    \ or representative\n      role is effective management of the liaison process\
    \ according to\n      the rules that have been agreed upon.  The liaison acts\
    \ as a\n      representative of the IETF and not an independent voice with\n \
    \     respect to topics of discussion in the liaison relationship.  The\n    \
    \  liaison must therefore be careful to distinguish his or her own\n      views\
    \ from documented IETF consensus in dealings with the peer\n      organization.\n\
    \      To this end, the liaison manager or representative must be able to\n  \
    \    communicate effectively with members of the peer organization,\n      especially\
    \ in face-to-face situations.  This is important both to\n      communicate the\
    \ IETF's viewpoint and to gather information about\n      the issues in the peer\
    \ organization that the IETF needs to\n      understand.\n      In support of\
    \ the liaison process, a person appointed to act as a\n      liaison manager or\
    \ representative on behalf of the IETF is\n      expected to have a good technical\
    \ understanding of the key issues\n      in the subject area, as well as an understanding\
    \ of the concerns\n      important to stakeholders in both organizations.\n  \
    \    An IETF liaison needs to have knowledge of the IETF's consensus\n      process\
    \ in general, as well as the consensus process(es) applying\n      to the key\
    \ issues within the liaison relationship.\n      The liaison must also have a\
    \ good understanding of the processes\n      used by the peer organization involved.\n\
    \   Perspective\n      Liaison relationships are designed for the mutual benefit\
    \ of the\n      organizations participating in the liaison.  As such, swift\n\
    \      information flow in both directions is a firm requirement.  The\n     \
    \ role of an IETF liaison manager is to promote the interests of the\n      IETF\
    \ with respect to all topics within the scope of the liaison\n      relationship.\
    \  Since the liaison manager \"wears an IETF hat\", it\n      is NOT the task\
    \ of a liaison manager to promote the interests of\n      the liaised organization\
    \ within the IETF.\n   Distance\n      A liaison may not be able to maintain the\
    \ required perspective if\n      he or she is closely involved in the outcome\
    \ of the work in the\n      peer organization.  A conflict of interest might arise\
    \ if the\n      liaison is involved in the management of the relevant part of\
    \ the\n      peer organization, has a close technical involvement in the work\n\
    \      that is the subject of the liaison, or has a close interest in the\n  \
    \    outcome of the work in the peer organization through his or her\n      employment.\
    \  When appointing an appropriate person to manage a\n      liaison relationship,\
    \ the IAB needs to take into account any\n      conflicts of interest that the\
    \ individual being considered might\n      have.  Before a person is appointed\
    \ to manage a liaison\n      relationship, he or she will be asked to explicitly\
    \ state any\n      conflicts of interest.  The IAB will not appoint a person to\
    \ a\n      liaison manager position if there is a strong conflict of\n      interest.\
    \  For example, an individual with an industry or\n      organizational leadership\
    \ position in an organization would\n      typically not be suitable for appointment\
    \ as an IETF liaison to\n      that organization.\n   Commitment and opportunity\n\
    \      A liaison manager needs to be committed to addressing the issues\n    \
    \  relevant to the liaison relationship.  To handle the job properly,\n      it\
    \ is necessary that the liaison be able to allocate sufficient\n      time to\
    \ the task.\n   Timeliness\n      It is expected that a liaison manger will make\
    \ the IETF aware of\n      new developments in the subject area in a timely fashion.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Responsibilities\n   The liaison manager and representatives provide information\
    \ to the\n   IETF community in order to enable the IETF to make decisions based\
    \ on\n   the best possible information regarding the work in the peer\n   organization.\
    \  In turn, information communicated by the IETF liaison\n   to the liaised organization\
    \ MUST be based on the relevant IETF\n   consensus.  The liaison manager works\
    \ with the liaised organization\n   to ensure that communication is clear.  As\
    \ part of this, the liaison\n   must clearly differentiate his or her own independent\
    \ positions from\n   those that represent IETF consensus.\n   It is the responsibility\
    \ of the liaison manager to ensure that the\n   liaised organization communicates\
    \ its requirements to the IETF in a\n   timely fashion and that the IETF consensus\
    \ is clearly understood.\n   This is particularly important in situations where\
    \ the IETF and the\n   liaised organization differ substantially in their positions.\
    \  In\n   this situation, the liaison manager needs to facilitate prompt\n   communication\
    \ so that the IETF and the liaised organization can stay\n   in close communication\
    \ and avoid misunderstandings.\n   The liaison manager and representatives are\
    \ responsible for clearly\n   and correctly communicating the IETF consensus position\
    \ to the\n   liaised organization.  This includes, when specifically instructed,\n\
    \   carrying any messages from the IETF to the peer organization.\n   Generally,\
    \ these communications \"represent the IETF\", and therefore\n   due care and\
    \ consensus must be applied in their construction.\n   The liaison manager and\
    \ representatives are responsible for ensuring\n   that relevant information originating\
    \ from the liaised organization,\n   or other information coming to the attention\
    \ of the liaison, reaches\n   the correct destination within the IETF, in a timely\
    \ and effective\n   way.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Tasks
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Tasks\n   Examples of tasks performed by the liaison manager are provided\n\
    \   below.  Depending on the nature of the liaised organization, the task\n  \
    \ may vary in frequency and relative importance.\n   1.  Attend relevant meetings\
    \ and participate in conference calls and\n       mailing lists within the liaised\
    \ organization to gather\n       information relevant to the liaison relationship.\
    \  Note\n       developments of interest for onward communication to the IETF.\n\
    \       Communicate the point of view of the IETF consensus to the peer\n    \
    \   organization.\n   2.  Communicate information relevant to the liaison relationship\
    \ to\n       the relevant part of the IETF either by written reports or\n    \
    \   verbally; this may involve briefings with a team of IETFers\n       involved\
    \ in the liaised organization and other interested parties\n       within the\
    \ IETF, e.g., working group chairs and ADs.\n   3.  Understand the concerns of\
    \ both the IETF and the peer\n       organization, while ensuring that interests\
    \ of the IETF are\n       maintained; where there appear to be problems to solve\
    \ or\n       conflicts between approaches, work with both parties to encourage\n\
    \       engineers from both organizations to collaborate on solving the\n    \
    \   problem and facilitate the development of engineering solutions\n       in\
    \ the appropriate organization.\n   4.  Prepare reports giving updates on developments\
    \ in the peer\n       organization as requested by the IAB or other interested\
    \ parties\n       in the IETF.  The target for these updates (e.g., the IAB, an\
    \ AD,\n       a WG) will typically be identified upon establishment of the\n \
    \      liaison relationship and/or the appointment of the liaison\n       manager.\n\
    \   5.  Oversee delivery of liaison statements addressed to the IETF.\n      \
    \ This includes ensuring that liaison statements are delivered to\n       the\
    \ appropriate destination within the IETF, as well as\n       shepherding the\
    \ timely creation of responses by the IETF.\n   6.  Work with the liaised organization\
    \ to ensure that the IETF's\n       liaison statements are appropriately directed\
    \ and responded to in\n       a timely fashion.  To accomplish this, the liaison\
    \ needs to build\n       a contact network.\n   7.  Communicate and coordinate\
    \ with other IETF liaison managers where\n       the activities of two or more\
    \ liaised organizations overlap.\n   8.  Assist with the preparation of IETF liaison\
    \ statements based on\n       IETF consensus.\n   9.  From time to time, liaison\
    \ managers and liaison representatives\n       will have to report to the IETF\
    \ on the status of the liaison\n       relationship.  For this purpose, they will\
    \ need to keep track of\n       outstanding issues on behalf of the IETF.  The\
    \ frequency of the\n       reports and the recipients of the reports within the\
    \ IETF will be\n       decided when the liaison relationship is set up and may\
    \ be\n       changed at any time by an IAB decision.  IAB or other parties\n \
    \      within the IETF may probe for liaison reports as needed or at\n       regular\
    \ intervals.\n"

    \   accurately as possible.  This commitment has been one of the key\n   discussion\
    \ points in the past, such as within the (g)mpls change\n   process [GMPLS].\n\
    \   This commitment does not mean that the IETF will uncritically accept\n   the\

  contents:
  - "3.5.3.  Ambiguous Incoming Liaison Statements\n   Sometimes the IETF, an IETF\
    \ area, or an IETF working group receives\n   liaison statements from a liaised\
    \ organization that are sent to the\n   wrong destination.  At other times, the\
    \ liaison statement is sent to\n   working groups that are not chartered to do\
    \ the work that the liaison\n   statement addresses.  In some cases, it might\
    \ be the situation that\n   no working group is chartered to do the work.\n  \
    \ In such cases, the liaison manager should assist in finding the\n   appropriate\
    \ recipient within the IETF that might respond to the\n   incoming liaison statement.\
    \  Sometimes this might require that the\n   intended response is made available\
    \ for review on one of the IETF\n   mailing lists.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.4.  Liaison Managers Representing Peer Organizations\n   Liaised organizations\
    \ may appoint a person to act as a liaison\n   manager for \"their side\" of the\
    \ relationship.  This is the person\n   that will speak authoritatively, within\
    \ the IETF, on the activities\n   performed by the other organization.  The other\
    \ organization needs to\n   make this person known to the IETF.  This person might\
    \ request a slot\n   on a working group agenda to discuss developments and plans\
    \ of the\n   liaised organization.\n   Opinions expressed by a liaison mangers\
    \ of other SDOs, other than\n   reports on work within the liaised organization,\
    \ are given equal\n   weight with opinions expressed by other working group participants.\n\
    \   RFC 3356 [RFC3356] describes this in the context of the relationship\n   between\
    \ the IETF and the ITU-T; however, the same model is applicable\n   to all other\
    \ organizations with which the IETF has a liaison\n   relationship.\n   The mandates\
    \ of liaison managers from other organizations are\n   recognized by the IETF\
    \ to the extent needed to understand the\n   information received from the liaison\
    \ manager.  In all other respects\n   he or she participates in IETF activities\
    \ under the same conditions\n   and rules as any other IETF participant.  It is\
    \ important that the\n   IETF liaison manager understands the extent to which\
    \ the peer liaison\n   manager is mandated or delegated to speak on behalf of\
    \ the peer\n   organization, and to inform the relevant part of the IETF if the\
    \ peer\n   liaison manager appears to be stepping outside the role or stance\n\
    \   given to him or her by the peer organization.\n   IETF liaison managers should\
    \ work to include the liaison manager from\n   the liaised organization within\
    \ their contact network, and to\n   understand the positions being communicated\
    \ by the peer liaison\n   manager.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not specify any protocol or\
    \ \"bits on the wire\".\n   However, since interaction with other standards-making\
    \ organizations\n   often relates to security, the liaison manager can assist\
    \ with\n   security-related issues, resulting in improved security for Internet\n\
    \   protocols.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   There are no requests to the IANA herein.  Note that\
