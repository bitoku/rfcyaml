- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which\n\
    \   packets with IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) are dropped in the Internet\n  \
    \ (as originally measured in August 2014 and later in June 2015, with\n   similar\
    \ results) and where in the network such dropping occurs.  The\n   aforementioned\
    \ results serve as a problem statement that is expected\n   to trigger operational\
    \ advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets\n   carrying IPv6 EHs so that the situation\
    \ improves over time.  This\n   document also explains how the results were obtained,\
    \ such that the\n   corresponding measurements can be reproduced by other members\
    \ of the\n   community and repeated over time to observe changes in the handling\n\
    \   of packets with IPv6 EHs.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of\
    \ the IPv6\n   protocol and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6\n\
    \   fragmentation.  While packets employing IPv6 EHs have been suspected\n   to\
    \ be dropped in some IPv6 deployments, there was not much concrete\n   data on\
    \ the topic.  Some preliminary measurements have been presented\n   in [PMTUD-Blackholes],\
    \ [Gont-IEPG88], and [Gont-Chown-IEPG89],\n   whereas [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90] presents\
    \ more comprehensive results on\n   which this document is based.\n   This document\
    \ presents real-world data regarding the extent to which\n   packets containing\
    \ IPv6 EHs are dropped in the Internet, as measured\n   in August 2014 and later\
    \ in June 2015 with similar results (pending\n   operational advice in this area).\
    \  The results presented in this\n   document indicate that in the scenarios where\
    \ the corresponding\n   measurements were performed, the use of IPv6 EHs can lead\
    \ to packet\n   drops.  We note that, in particular, packet drops occurring at\n\
    \   transit networks are undesirable, and it is hoped and expected that\n   this\
    \ situation will improve over time.\n"
- title: 2.  Support of IPv6 Extension Headers in the Internet
  contents:
  - "2.  Support of IPv6 Extension Headers in the Internet\n   This section summarizes\
    \ the results obtained when measuring the\n   support of IPv6 EHs on the path\
    \ towards different types of public\n   IPv6 servers.  Two sources of information\
    \ were employed for the list\n   of public IPv6 servers: the \"World IPv6 Launch\"\
    \ site\n   <http://www.worldipv6launch.org> and Alexa's list of the Top\n   1-Million\
    \ Web Sites <http://www.alexa.com>.  For each list of domain\n   names, the following\
    \ datasets were obtained:\n   o  Web servers (AAAA records of the aforementioned\
    \ list)\n   o  Mail servers (MX -> AAAA records of the aforementioned list)\n\
    \   o  Name servers (NS -> AAAA records of the aforementioned list)\n   Duplicate\
    \ addresses and IPv6 addresses other than global unicast\n   addresses were eliminated\
    \ from each of those lists prior to obtaining\n   the results included in this\
    \ document.  Additionally, addresses that\n   were found to be unreachable were\
    \ discarded from the dataset (please\n   see Appendix B for further details).\n\
    \   For each of the aforementioned address sets, three different types of\n  \
    \ probes were employed:\n   o  IPv6 packets with a Destination Options header\
    \ of 8 bytes;\n   o  IPv6 packets resulting in two IPv6 fragments of 512 bytes\
    \ each\n      (approximately); and\n   o  IPv6 packets with a Hop-by-Hop Options\
    \ header of 8 bytes.\n   In the case of packets with a Destination Options header\
    \ and the case\n   of packets with a Hop-by-Hop Options header, the desired EH\
    \ size was\n   achieved by means of PadN options [RFC2460].  The upper-layer\n\
    \   protocol of the probe packets was, in all cases, TCP [RFC793] with\n   the\
    \ Destination Port set to the service port [IANA-PORT-NUMBERS] of\n   the corresponding\
    \ dataset.  For example, the probe packets for all\n   the measurements involving\
    \ web servers were TCP segments with the\n   Destination Port set to 80.\n   Besides\
    \ obtaining the packet drop rate when employing the\n   aforementioned IPv6 EHs,\
    \ we tried to identify whether the Autonomous\n   System (AS) dropping the packets\
    \ was the same as the AS of the\n   destination/target address.  This is of particular\
    \ interest since it\n   essentially reveals whether the packet drops are under\
    \ the control of\n   the intended destination of the packets.  Packets dropped\
    \ by the\n   destination AS are less of a concern since the device dropping the\n\
    \   packets is under the control of the same organization as that to\n   which\
    \ the packets are destined (hence, it is probably easier to\n   update the filtering\
    \ policy if deemed necessary).  On the other hand,\n   packets dropped by transit\
    \ ASes are more of a concern since they\n   affect the deployability and usability\
    \ of IPv6 EHs (including IPv6\n   fragmentation) by a third party (the destination\
    \ AS).  In any case,\n   we note that it is impossible to tell whether, in those\
    \ cases where\n   IPv6 packets with EHs get dropped, the packet drops are the\
    \ result of\n   an explicit and intended policy or the result of improper device\n\
    \   configuration defaults, buggy devices, etc.  Thus, packet drops that\n   occur\
    \ at the destination AS might still prove to be problematic.\n   Since there is\
    \ some ambiguity when identifying the AS to which a\n   specific router belongs\
    \ (see Appendix B.2), each of our measurements\n   results in two different values:\
    \ one corresponding to the \"best-case\n   scenario\" and one corresponding to\
    \ the \"worst-case scenario\".  The\n   \"best-case scenario\" is that in which,\
    \ when in doubt, the packets are\n   assumed to be dropped by the destination\
    \ AS, whereas the \"worst-case\n   scenario\" is that in which, when in doubt,\
    \ the packets are assumed to\n   be dropped by a transit AS (please see Appendix\
    \ B.2 for details).  In\n   the following tables, the values shown within parentheses\
    \ represent\n   the possibility that, when a packet is dropped, the packet drop\n\
    \   occurs in an AS other than the destination AS (considering both the\n   best-case\
    \ scenario and the worst-case scenario).\n   +----------+------------------+------------------+------------------+\n\

  contents:
  - "B.1.  Isolating the Dropping Node\n   Let us assume that we find that IPv6 packets\
    \ with EHs are being\n   dropped on their way to the destination system 2001:db8:d::1\
    \ and that\n   the output of running traceroute towards such destination is:\n\
    \      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1\n      2. 2001:db8:2:4000::1\n      3. 2001:db8:3:4000::1\n\
    \      4. 2001:db8:3:1000::1\n      5. 2001:db8:4:4000::1\n      6. 2001:db8:4:1000::1\n\
    \      7. 2001:db8:5:5000::1\n      8. 2001:db8:5:6000::1\n      9. 2001:db8:d::1\n\
    \   Additionally, let us assume that the output of EH-enabled traceroute\n   to\
    \ the same destination is:\n      1. 2001:db8:1:1000::1\n      2. 2001:db8:2:4000::1\n\
    \      3. 2001:db8:3:4000::1\n      4. 2001:db8:3:1000::1\n      5. 2001:db8:4:4000::1\n\
    \   For the sake of brevity, let us refer to the last-responding node in\n   the\
    \ EH-enabled traceroute (\"2001:db8:4:4000::1\" in this case) as \"M\".\n   Assuming\
    \ that packets in both traceroutes employ the same path, we'll\n   refer to \"\
    the node following the last responding node in the\n   EH-enabled traceroute\"\
    \ (\"2001:db8:4:1000::1\" in our case), as \"M+1\",\n   etc.\n   Based on traceroute\
    \ information above, which node is the one actually\n   dropping the EH-enabled\
    \ packets will depend on whether the dropping\n   node filters packets before\
    \ making the forwarding decision or after\n   making the forwarding decision.\
    \  If the former, the dropping node\n   will be M+1.  If the latter, the dropping\
    \ node will be \"M\".\n   Throughout this document (and our measurements), we\
    \ assume that those\n   nodes dropping packets that carry IPv6 EHs apply their\
    \ filtering\n   policy, and only then, if necessary, forward the packets.  Thus,\
    \ in\n   our example above, the last responding node to the EH-enabled\n   traceroute\
    \ (\"M\") is \"2001:db8:4:4000::1\", and we assume the dropping\n   node to be\
    \ \"2001:db8:4:1000::1\" (\"M+1\").\n   Additionally, we note that when isolating\
    \ the dropping node we assume\n   that both the EH-enabled and the EH-free traceroutes\
    \ result in the\n   same paths.  However, this might not be the case.\n"
- title: B.2.  Obtaining the Responsible Organization for the Packet Drops
  contents:
  - "B.2.  Obtaining the Responsible Organization for the Packet Drops\n   In order\
    \ to identify the organization operating the dropping node,\n   one would be tempted\
    \ to lookup the Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)\n   corresponding to the dropping\
    \ node.  However, assuming that M and M+1\n   are two peering routers, any of\
    \ these two organizations could be\n   providing the address space employed for\
    \ such peering.  Or, in the\n   case of an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), the\
    \ address space could\n   correspond to the IXP AS rather than to any of the participating\n\
    \   ASes.  Thus, the organization operating the dropping node (M+1) could\n  \
    \ be the AS for M+1, but it might as well be the AS for M+2.  Only when\n   the\
    \ ASN for M+1 is the same as the ASN for M+2 do we have certainty\n   about who\
    \ the responsible organization for the packet drops is (see\n   slides 21-23 of\
    \ [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90]).\n   In the measurement results presented in Section\
    \ 2, the aforementioned\n   ambiguity results in a \"best-case\" and a \"worst-case\"\
    \ scenario\n   (rather than a single value): the lowest percentage value means\
    \ that,\n   when in doubt, we assume the packet drops occur in the same AS as\
    \ the\n   destination; on the other hand, the highest percentage value means\n\
    \   that, when in doubt, we assume the packet drops occur at a different\n   AS\
    \ than the destination AS.\n   We note that the aforementioned ambiguity should\
    \ also be considered\n   when troubleshooting and reporting IPv6 packet drops\
    \ since\n   identifying the organization responsible for the packet drops might\n\
    \   prove to be a non-trivial task.\n   Finally, we note that a specific organization\
    \ might be operating more\n   than one AS.  However, our measurements assume that\
    \ different ASNs\n   imply different organizations.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Troubleshooting Packet Drops Due to IPv6 Extension Headers\n   Isolating\
    \ IPv6 blackholes essentially involves performing IPv6\n   traceroute for a destination\
    \ system with and without IPv6 EHs.  The\n   EH-free traceroute would provide\
    \ the full working path towards a\n   destination while the EH-enabled traceroute\
    \ would provide the address\n   of the last-responding node for EH-enabled packets\
    \ (say, \"M\").  In\n   principle, one could isolate the dropping node by looking-up\
    \ \"M\" in\n   the EH-free traceroute with the dropping node being \"M+1\" (see\n\
    \   Appendix B.1 for caveats).\n   At the time of this writing, most traceroute\
    \ implementations do not\n   support IPv6 EHs.  However, the path6 tool of [IPv6-Toolkit]\
    \ provides\n   such support.  Additionally, the blackhole6 tool of [IPv6-Toolkit]\n\
    \   automates the troubleshooting process and can readily provide\n   information\
    \ such as: dropping node's IPv6 address, dropping node's\n   AS, etc.\n"
