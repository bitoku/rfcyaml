    \ Capable (FSC).\n   The ITU-T has specified an architecture for the control of\n\
    \   Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON).  This architecture\n   forms\
    \ the basis of many Recommendations within the ITU-T.\n   Because the GMPLS and\
    \ ASON architectures were developed by different\n   people in different standards\
    \ bodies, and because the architectures\n   have very different historic backgrounds\
    \ (the Internet, and transport\n   networks respectively), the terminology used\
    \ is different.\n   This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation\
    \ of GMPLS\n   terminology within the context of the ASON architecture.  This\

    \ Any\n      controller in the TE domain makes a TE link available for its\n \
    \     local path computation if it receives consistent advertisements of\n   \
    \   both TE link ends.  Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as\n      TE\
    \ link advertising -- only TE link end advertising.  TE link end\n      advertising\
    \ may contain information about multiple switching\n      capabilities.  This,\
    \ however, should not be interpreted as\n      advertising of a multi-layer TE\
    \ link end, but rather as joint\n      advertisement of ends of multiple parallel\
    \ TE links, each\n      representing resources in a separate layer.  The advertisement\
    \ may\n      contain attributes shared by all TE links in the group (for\n   \
    \   example, protection capabilities, Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs),\n     \
    \ etc.), separate information related to each TE link (for example,\n      switching\
    \ capability, data encoding, unreserved bandwidth, etc.)\n      as well as information\
    \ related to inter-layer relationships of the\n      advertised resources (for\
    \ example, termination and adaptation\n      capabilities) should the control\
    \ plane decide to use them as the\n      termination points of higher-layer data\
    \ links.  These higher-layer\n      data links, however, are not real yet -- they\
    \ are abstract until\n      the underlying connections are established in the\
    \ lower layers.\n      LSPs created in lower layers for the purpose of providing\
    \ data\n      links (extra network flexibility) in higher layers are called\n\
    \      hierarchical connections or LSPs (H-LSPs), or simply hierarchies.\n   \
    \   LSPs created for the purpose of providing data links in the same\n      layer\
    \ are called stitching segments.  H-LSPs and stitching\n      segments could,\
    \ but do not have to, be advertised as TE links.\n      Naturally, if they are\
    \ advertised as TE links (LSPs advertised as\n      TE links are often referred\
    \ to as TE-LSPs), they are made\n      available for path computations performed\
    \ on any controller within\n      the TE domain into which they are advertised.\
    \  H-LSPs and\n      stitching segments could be advertised either individually\
    \ or in\n      TE bundles.  An H-LSP or a stitching segment could be advertised\n\
    \      as a TE link either into the same or a separate TE domain compared\n  \
    \    to the one within which it was provisioned.\n      A set of H-LSPs that is\
    \ created (or could be created) in a\n      particular layer to provide network\
    \ flexibility (data links) in\n      other layers is called a Virtual Network\
    \ Topology (VNT).  A single\n      H-LSP could provide several (more than one)\
    \ data links (each in a\n      different layer).\n   Forwarding Adjacency (FA)\
    \ <Control Plane> is a TE link that does not\n      require a direct routing adjacency\
    \ (peering) between the\n      controllers managing its ends in order to guarantee\
    \ control plane\n      connectivity (a control channel) between the controllers.\
    \  An\n      example of an FA is an H-LSP or stitching segment advertised as a\n\
    \      TE link into the same TE domain within which it was dynamically\n     \
    \ provisioned.  In such cases, the control plane connectivity\n      between the\
    \ controllers at the ends of the H-LSP/stitching segment\n      is guaranteed\
    \ by the concatenation of control channels\n      interconnecting the ends of\
    \ each of its constituents.  In\n      contrast, an H-LSP or stitching segment\
    \ advertised as a TE link\n      into a TE domain (different than one where it\
    \ was provisioned)\n      generally requires a direct routing adjacency to be\
    \ established\n      within the TE domain where the TE link is advertised in order\
    \ to\n      guarantee control plane connectivity between the TE link ends.\n \
    \     Therefore, is not an FA.\n"

    \ concepts and terms associated with GMPLS\n   into the context of the ITU-T's\
    \ ASON architecture.  Thus, it should\n   help those familiar with ASON to see\
    \ how they may use the features\n   and functions of GMPLS in order to meet the\
    \ requirements of an ASON.\n   For example, service providers wishing to establish\
    \ a protected end-\n   to-end service might read [SEG-PROT] and [E2E-PROT] and\
    \ wish to\n   understand how the GMPLS terms used relate to the ASON architecture\n\
    \   so that they can confirm that they will satisfy their requirements.\n   This\
    \ lexicography should not be used in order to obtain or derive\n   definitive\
    \ definitions of GMPLS terms.  To obtain definitions of\n   GMPLS terms that are\
    \ applicable across all GMPLS architectural\n   models, the reader should refer\
