  - "1.  Introduction\n   The number of incidents in cyber society is growing day\
    \ by day.\n   Incident information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared\n\
    \   among organizations in order to cope with the situation.  IODEF is\n   one\
    \ of the tools already in use that enables such an exchange.\n   To more efficiently\
    \ run security operations, information exchanged\n   between organizations needs\
    \ to be machine readable.  IODEF provides a\n   means to describe the incident\
    \ information, but it often needs to\n   include various non-structured types\
    \ of incident-related data in\n   order to convey more specific details about\
    \ what is occurring.\n   Further structure within IODEF increases the machine-readability\
    \ of\n   the document, thus providing a means for better automating certain\n\
    \   security operations.\n   Within the security community there exist various\
    \ means for\n   specifying structured descriptions of cybersecurity information,\
    \ such\n   as [CAPEC], [CCE], [CCSS], [CEE], [CPE], [CVE], [CVRF], [CVSS],\n \
    \  [CWE], [CWSS], [MAEC], [OCIL], [OVAL], [SCAP], and [XCCDF].  In this\n   context,\
    \ cybersecurity information encompasses a broad range of\n   structured data representation\
    \ types that may be used to assess or\n   report on the security posture of an\
    \ asset or set of assets.  Such\n   structured descriptions facilitate a better\
    \ understanding of an\n   incident while enabling more streamlined automated security\n\
    \   operations.  Because of this, it would be beneficial to embed and\n   convey\
    \ these types of information inside IODEF documents.\n   This document extends\
    \ IODEF to embed and convey various types of\n   structured information.  Since\
    \ IODEF defines a flexible and\n   extensible format and supports a granular level\
    \ of specificity, this\n   document defines an extension to IODEF instead of defining\
    \ a new\n   report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate duplication, only the\n\
    \   additional structures necessary for describing the exchange of such\n   structured\
    \ information are provided.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The terminology used in this document follows the terminology\
    \ defined\n   in RFC 5070 [RFC5070].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   To maintain awareness of the continually changing security\
    \ threat\n   landscape, organizations need to exchange cybersecurity information,\n\
    \   which includes the following information: attack pattern, platform\n   information,\
    \ vulnerability and weakness, countermeasure instruction,\n   computer event logs,\
    \ and severity assessments.  IODEF provides a\n   scheme to describe and exchange\
    \ such information among interested\n   parties.  However, it does not define\
    \ the detailed formats to specify\n   such information.\n   There already exist\
    \ structured and detailed formats for describing\n   these types of information\
    \ that can be used in facilitating such an\n   exchange.  They include [CAPEC],\
    \ [CCE], [CCSS], [CEE], [CPE], [CVE],\n   [CVRF], [CVSS], [CWE], [CWSS], [MAEC],\
    \ [OCIL], [OVAL], [SCAP], and\n   [XCCDF].  By embedding them into the IODEF document,\
    \ the document can\n   convey more detailed context information to the receivers,\
    \ and the\n   document can be easily reused.\n   The use of formats for structured\
    \ information facilitates more\n   advanced security operations on the receiver\
    \ side.  Since the\n   information is machine readable, the data can be processed\
    \ by\n   computers, thus allowing better automation of security operations.\n\
    \   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident\n   wants\
    \ to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  In this case,\n   the sender\
    \ can simply use IODEF, where an XML-based [XML1.0] attack\n   pattern record\
    \ that follows the syntax and vocabulary defined by an\n   industry specification\
    \ is embedded, instead of describing everything\n   in free-form text.  The receiver\
    \ can identify the needed details of\n   the attack pattern by looking up some\
    \ of the XML tags defined by the\n   specification.  The receiver can accumulate\
    \ the attack pattern record\n   in its database and could distribute it to the\
    \ interested parties as\n   needed, all without requiring human intervention.\n\
    \   In another example, an administrator is investigating an incident and\n  \
    \ has detected a configuration problem that he wishes to share with a\n   partner\
    \ organization to prevent the same event from occurring at the\n   partner organization.\
    \  To confirm that the configuration was in fact\n   vulnerable, he uses an internal\
    \ repository to access configuration\n   information that was gathered prior to\
    \ the initial attack and that is\n   specific to a new vulnerability alert.  He\
    \ uses this information to\n   automatically generate an XML-based software configuration\n\
    \   description, embed it in an IODEF document, and send the resulting\n   IODEF\
    \ document to the partner organization.\n"
- title: 4.  Extension Definition
  contents:
  - "4.  Extension Definition\n   This document extends IODEF to embed structured\
    \ information by\n   introducing new classes that can be embedded consistently\
    \ inside an\n   IODEF document as element contents of the AdditionalData and\n\
    \   RecordItem classes [RFC5070].\n"
- title: 4.1.  IANA Table for Structured Cybersecurity Information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IANA Table for Structured Cybersecurity Information\n   This extension\
    \ embeds structured cybersecurity information (SCI)\n   defined by other specifications.\
    \  The list of supported\n   specifications is managed by IANA, and this document\
    \ defines the\n   needed fields for the list's entry.\n   Each entry for each\
    \ specification has the namespace [XMLNames],\n   specification name, version,\
    \ reference URI, and applicable classes.\n   Arbitrary URIs that may help readers\
    \ understand the specification\n   could be embedded inside the Reference URI\
    \ field, but it is\n   recommended that a standard/informational URI describing\
    \ the\n   specification be prepared and embedded here.\n   The initial IANA table\
    \ has only one entry, as follows:\n      Namespace:          urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mile:mmdef:1.2\n\
    \      Specification Name: Malware Metadata Exchange Format\n      Version:  \
    \          1.2\n      Reference URI:      <http://standards.ieee.org/develop\n\
    \                          /indconn/icsg/mmdef.html>,\n                      \
    \    <http://grouper.ieee.org/groups\n                          /malware/malwg/Schema1.2/>\n\
    \      Applicable Classes: AttackPattern\n   Note that the specification was developed\
    \ by The Institute of\n   Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated (IEEE),\
    \ through\n   the Industry Connections Security Group (ICSG) of its Standards\n\
    \   Association.\n   The table is managed by IANA, following the allocation policy\n\
    \   specified in Section 7.\n   The SpecID attributes of extension classes (Section\
    \ 4.5) must allow\n   the values of the specifications' namespace fields, but\n\
    \   implementations are otherwise not required to support all\n   specifications\
    \ of the IANA table and may choose which specifications\n   to support.  However,\
    \ at a minimum, the specification listed in the\n   initial IANA table needs to\
    \ be supported, as described in Section 5.\n   If an implementation received data\
    \ that it does not support, it may\n   expand its functionality by looking up\
    \ the IANA table or notify the\n   sender of its inability to parse the data.\
    \  Note that the lookup\n   could be done manually or automatically, but automatic\
    \ download of\n   data from IANA's website is not recommended, since it is not\
    \ designed\n   for mass retrieval of data by multiple devices.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a format for encoding\
    \ a particular class of\n   security incidents appropriate for exchange across\
    \ organizations.  As\n   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce\
    \ security\n   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances\n\
    \   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,\n   the\
    \ underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure\n   the appropriate\
    \ degree of confidentiality, integrity, and\n   authenticity for the specific\
    \ environment.  Specific security\n   considerations are detailed in the messaging\
    \ and transport documents,\n   where the exchange of formatted information is\
    \ automated; see\n   Sections 9 and 10 of \"Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID)\"\
    \n   [RFC6545] and Section 4 of \"Transport of Real-time Inter-network\n   Defense\
    \ (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS\" [RFC6546] for a detailed\n   overview of security\
    \ requirements and considerations.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that organizations that\
    \ exchange data using this\n   document develop operating procedures that consider,\
    \ at a minimum,\n   the following areas of concern.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns\n   The underlying messaging format, IODEF,\
    \ provides data markers to\n   indicate the sensitivity level of specific classes\
    \ within the\n   structure as well as for the entire XML document.  The \"restriction\"\
    \n   attribute accomplishes this with four attribute values in IODEF\n   [RFC5070].\
    \  These values are RECOMMENDED for use at the application\n   level, prior to\
    \ transport, to protect data as appropriate.  A\n   standard mechanism to apply\
    \ XML encryption using these attribute\n   values as triggers is defined in RID\
    \ [RFC6545], Section 9.1.  This\n   mechanism may be used whether or not the RID\
    \ protocol [RFC6545] and\n   its associated transport binding [RFC6546] are used\
    \ in the exchange\n   to provide object-level security on the data to prevent\
    \ possible\n   intermediary systems or middleboxes from having access to the data\n\
    \   being exchanged.  In areas where transmission security or secrecy is\n   questionable,\
    \ the application of an XML digital signature [XMLDSIG]\n   and/or encryption\
    \ on each report will counteract both of these\n   concerns.  The data markers\
    \ are RECOMMENDED for use by applications\n   for managing access controls; however,\
    \ access controls and management\n   of those controls are out of scope for this\
    \ document.  Options such\n   as the usage of a standard language (e.g., eXtensible\
    \ Access Control\n   Markup Language [XACML]) for the expression of authorization\
    \ policies\n   can be used to enable source and destination systems to better\n\
    \   coordinate and align their respective policy expressions.\n   Any transport\
    \ protocol used to exchange instances of IODEF documents\n   MUST provide appropriate\
    \ guarantees of confidentiality, integrity,\n   and authenticity.  The use of\
    \ a standardized security protocol is\n   encouraged.  The RID protocol [RFC6545]\
    \ and its associated transport\n   binding [RFC6546] provide such security with\
    \ options for mutual\n   authentication session encryption and include application-level\n\
    \   concerns such as policy and workflow.\n   The critical security concerns are\
    \ that structured information may be\n   falsified, accessed by unintended entities,\
    \ or become corrupt during\n   transit.  We expect that each exchanging organization\
    \ will determine\n   the need, and mechanism, for transport protection.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Protection of Sensitive and Private Information
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Protection of Sensitive and Private Information\n   For a complete review\
    \ of privacy considerations when transporting\n   incident-related information,\
    \ please see RID [RFC6545], Section 9.5.\n   Whether or not the RID protocol is\
    \ used, the privacy considerations\n   are important to consider, as incident\
    \ information is often sensitive\n   and may contain privacy-related information\
    \ about individuals/\n   organizations or endpoints involved.  Organizations will\
    \ often\n   require the establishment of legal reviews and formal policies that\n\
    \   outline specific details of what information can be exchanged with\n   specific\
    \ entities.  Typically, identifying information is anonymized\n   where possible\
    \ and appropriate.  In some cases, information brokers\n   are used to further\
    \ anonymize the source of exchanged information so\n   that other entities are\
    \ unaware of the origin of a detected threat,\n   whether or not that threat was\
    \ realized.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that policies and procedures for the exchange\
    \ of\n   cybersecurity information be established prior to participation in\n\
    \   data exchanges.  Policy and workflow procedures for the exchange of\n   cybersecurity\
    \ information often require executive-level approvals and\n   legal reviews to\
    \ appropriately establish limits on what information\n   can be exchanged with\
    \ specific organizations.  RID [RFC6545],\n   Section 9.6 outlines options and\
    \ considerations for application\n   developers to consider for policy and workflow\
    \ design.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Application and Server Security
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Application and Server Security\n   The cybersecurity information extension\
    \ is merely a data format.\n   Applications and transport protocols that store\
    \ or exchange IODEF\n   documents using information that can be represented through\
    \ this\n   extension will be a target for attacks.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n \
    \  systems and applications storing or exchanging this information be\n   properly\
    \ secured, have minimal services enabled, and maintain access\n   controls and\
    \ monitoring procedures.\n"
