  - "Abstract\n   It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access\n\
    \   technologies to gain network connectivity.  Currently there are\n   access-specific\
    \ mechanisms for providing client information to the\n   network for authentication\
    \ and authorization purposes.  In addition\n   to being limited to specific access\
    \ media (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802\n   links), some of these protocols are limited\
    \ to specific network\n   topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links).  The\
    \ goal of this\n   document is to identify the requirements for a link-layer agnostic\n\
    \   protocol that allows a host and a network to authenticate each other\n   for\
    \ network access.  This protocol will run between a client's device\n   and an\
    \ agent in the network where the agent might be a client of the\n   AAA infrastructure.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Secure network access service requires access control based\
    \ on the\n   authentication and authorization of the clients and the access\n\
    \   networks.  Initial and subsequent client-to-network authentication\n   provides\
    \ parameters that are needed to police the traffic flow\n   through the enforcement\
    \ points.  A protocol is needed to carry\n   authentication parameters between\
    \ the client and the access network.\n   See Appendix A for the associated problem\
    \ statement.\n   The protocol design will be limited to defining a messaging protocol\n\
    \   (i.e., a carrier) that will allow authentication payload to be\n   carried\
    \ between the host/client and an agent/server in the access\n   network for authentication\
    \ and authorization purposes regardless of\n   the AAA infrastructure that may\
    \ (or may not) reside on the network.\n   As a network-layer protocol, it will\
    \ be independent of the underlying\n   access technologies and applicable to any\
    \ network topology.\n   The intent is not to invent new security protocols and\
    \ mechanisms but\n   to reuse existing mechanisms such as EAP [RFC3748].  In particular,\n\
    \   the requirements do not mandate the need to define new authentication\n  \
    \ protocols (e.g., EAP-TLS [RFC2716]), key distribution or key\n   agreement protocols,\
    \ or key derivation methods.  The desired protocol\n   can be viewed as the front-end\
    \ of the AAA protocol or any other\n   protocol/mechanisms the network is running\
    \ at the background to\n   authenticate its clients.  It will act as a carrier\
    \ for an already\n   defined security protocol or mechanism.\n   An example of\
    \ a protocol being extended for use in authenticating a\n   host for network access\
    \ is Mobile IPv4.  A Mobile IPv4 registration\n   request message is used as a\
    \ carrier for authentication extensions\n   (MN-FA [RFC3344] or MN-AAA [RFC3012])\
    \ that allows a foreign agent to\n   authenticate mobile nodes before providing\
    \ forwarding service.  The\n   goal of PANA is similar in that it aims to define\
    \ a network-layer\n   transport for authentication information.  However, PANA\
    \ will be\n   decoupled from mobility management and will rely on other\n   specifications\
    \ for the definition of authentication payloads.\n   This document defines common\
    \ terminology and identifies requirements\n   of a protocol for PANA that will\
    \ be used to define and limit the\n   scope of the work to be done in this group.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Authentication of Client\n   PANA MUST enable authentication of PaCs\
    \ for network access.  A PaC's\n   identity can be authenticated by verifying\
    \ the credentials (e.g.,\n   identifier, authenticator) supplied by one of the\
    \ users of the device\n   or the device itself.  PANA MUST only grant network\
    \ access service to\n   the device identified by the DI, rather than separate\
    \ access to\n   multiple simultaneous users of the device.  Once network access\
    \ is\n   granted to the device, methods used by the device on arbitrating\n  \
    \ which user can access the network is outside the scope of PANA.\n   PANA MUST\
    \ NOT define new security protocols or mechanisms.  Instead,\n   it MUST be defined\
    \ as a \"carrier\" for such protocols.  PANA MUST\n   identify which specific\
    \ security protocol(s) or mechanism(s) it can\n   carry (the \"payload\").  EAP\
    \ is a candidate protocol that satisfies\n   many requirements for authentication.\
    \  PANA would be a carrier\n   protocol for EAP.  If the PANA Working Group decides\
    \ that extensions\n   to EAP are needed, it will define requirements for the EAP\
    \ WG instead\n   of designing such extensions.\n   Providing authentication, integrity\
    \ and replay protection for data\n   traffic after a successful PANA exchange\
    \ is outside the scope of this\n   protocol.  In networks where physical layer\
    \ security is not present,\n   link-layer or network-layer ciphering (e.g., IPsec)\
    \ can be used to\n   provide such security.  These mechanisms require the presence\
    \ of\n   cryptographic keying material at PaC and EP.  Although PANA does not\n\
    \   deal with key derivation or distribution, it enables this by carrying\n  \
    \ EAP and allowing appropriate EAP method selection.  Various EAP\n   methods\
    \ are capable of generating basic keying material that cannot\n   be directly\
    \ used with IPsec because it lacks the properties of an\n   IPsec SA (security\
    \ association) including secure cipher suite\n   negotiation, mutual proof of\
    \ possession of keying material, freshness\n   of transient session keys, key\
    \ naming, etc.  These basic (initial)\n   EAP keys can be used with an IPsec key\
    \ management protocol, like IKE,\n   to generate the required security associations.\
    \  A separate protocol,\n   called secure association protocol, is required to\
    \ generate IPsec SAs\n   based on the basic EAP keys.  This protocol MUST be capable\
    \ of\n   enabling IPsec-based access control on the EPs.  IPsec SAs MUST\n   enable\
    \ authentication, integrity and replay protection of data\n   packets as they\
    \ are sent between the EP and PaC.\n   Providing a complete secure network access\
    \ solution by securing\n   router discovery  [RFC1256], neighbor discovery [RFC2461],\
    \ and\n   address resolution protocols [RFC826] is outside the scope as well.\n\
    \   Some access networks might require or allow their clients to get\n   authenticated\
    \ and authorized by the network access provider (NAP) and\n   ISP before the clients\
    \ gain network access.  NAP is the owner of the\n   access network who provides\
    \ physical and link-layer connectivity to\n   the clients.  PANA MUST be capable\
    \ of enabling two independent\n   authentication operations (i.e., execution of\
    \ two separate EAP\n   methods) for the same client.  Determining the authorization\n\
    \   parameters as a result of two separate authentications is an\n   operational\
    \ issue and therefore outside the scope of PANA.\n   Both the PaC and the PAA\
    \ MUST be able to perform mutual\n   authentication for network access.  Providing\
    \ only the capability of\n   a PAA authenticating the PaC is not sufficient. \
    \ Mutual\n   authentication capability is required in some environments but not\
    \ in\n   all of them.  For example, clients might not need to authenticate the\n\
    \   access network when physical security is available (e.g., dial-up\n   networks).\n\
    \   PANA MUST be capable of carrying out both periodic and on-demand re-\n   authentication.\
    \  Both the PaC and the PAA MUST be able to initiate\n   both the initial authentication\
    \ and the re-authentication process.\n   Certain types of service theft are possible\
    \ when the DI is not\n   protected during or after the PANA exchange [RFC4016].\
    \  PANA MUST\n   have the capability to exchange DI securely between the PaC and\
    \ PAA\n   where the network is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.  While\n\
    \   PANA MUST provide such a capability, its utility relies on the use of\n  \
    \ an authentication method that can generate keys for cryptographic\n   computations\
    \ on PaC and PAA.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Authorization, Accounting, and Access Control\n   After a device is authenticated\
    \ by using PANA, it MUST be authorized\n   for \"network access.\" That is, the\
    \ core requirement of PANA is to\n   verify the authorization of a PaC so that\
    \ PaC's device may send and\n   receive any IP packets.  It may also be possible\
    \ to provide finer\n   granularity authorization, such as authorization for QoS\
    \ or\n   individual services (e.g., http vs. ssh).  However, while a backend\n\
    \   authorization infrastructure (e.g., RADIUS or Diameter based AAA\n   infra)\
    \ might provide such indications to the PAA, explicit support\n   for them is\
    \ outside the scope of PANA.  For instance, PANA is not\n   required to carry\
    \ any indication of the services authorized for the\n   authenticated device.\n\
    \   Providing access control functionality in the network is outside the\n   scope\
    \ of PANA.  Client access authentication SHOULD be followed by\n   access control\
    \ to make sure only authenticated and authorized clients\n   can send and receive\
    \ IP packets via the access network.  Access\n   control can involve setting access\
    \ control lists on the EPs.  PANA\n   protocol exchange identifies clients that\
    \ are authorized to access\n   the network.  If IPsec-based access control is\
    \ deployed in an access\n   network, PaC and EPs should have the required IPsec\
    \ SA in place.\n   Generating the IPsec SAs based on EAP keys is outside the scope\
    \ of\n   PANA protocol.  This transformation MUST be handled by a separate\n \
    \  secure association protocol (see section 4.1.1).\n   Carrying accounting data\
    \ is outside the scope of PANA.\n"

    \   a requirement.  When the access network does not rely on an IETF-\n   defined\
    \ AAA protocol (e.g., RADIUS, Diameter), it can still use a\n   proprietary backend\

- title: Appendix A.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Problem Statement\n   Access networks in most cases require some\
    \ form of authentication in\n   order to prevent unauthorized usage.  In the absence\
    \ of physical\n   security (and sometimes in addition to it) a higher layer (L2+)\n\
    \   access authentication mechanism is needed.  Depending on the\n   deployment\
    \ scenarios, a number of features are expected from the\n   authentication mechanism.\
    \  For example, support for various\n   authentication methods (e.g., MD5, TLS,\
    \ SIM, etc.), network roaming,\n   network service provider discovery and selection,\
    \ separate\n   authentication for access (L1+L2) service provider and ISP (L3),\
    \ etc.\n   In the absence of a link-layer authentication mechanism that can\n\
    \   satisfy these needs, operators are forced to either use non-standard\n   ad-hoc\
    \ solutions at layers above the link, insert additional shim\n   layers for authentication,\
    \ or misuse some of the existing protocols\n   in ways that were not intended\
    \ by design.  PANA will be developed to\n   fill this gap by defining a standard\
    \ network-layer access\n   authentication protocol.  As a network-layer access\
    \ authentication\n   protocol, PANA can be used over any link-layer that supports\
    \ IP.\n   DSL networks are a specific example where PANA has the potential for\n\
    \   addressing some of the deployment scenarios.  Some DSL deployments do\n  \
    \ not use PPP [RFC1661] as the access link-layer (IP is carried over\n   ATM and\
    \ the subscriber device is either statically or DHCP-\n   configured).  The operators\
    \ of these networks are left either using\n   an application-layer web-based login\
    \ (captive portal) scheme for\n   subscriber authentication, or providing a best-effort\
    \ service only as\n   they cannot perform subscriber authentication required for\
    \ the\n   differentiated services.  The captive portal scheme is a non-standard\n\
    \   solution that has various limitations and security flaws.\n   PPP-based authentication\
    \ can provide some of the required\n   functionality.  But using PPP only for\
    \ authentication is not a good\n   choice, as it incurs additional messaging during\
    \ the connection setup\n   and extra per-packet processing.  It also forces the\
    \ network topology\n   to a point-to-point model.  Aside from resistance to incorporating\n\
    \   PPP into an architecture unless it is absolutely necessary, there is\n   even\
    \ interest in the community in removing PPP from some of the\n   existing architectures\
    \ and deployments (e.g., 3GPP2, DSL).\n   Using Mobile IPv4 authentication with\
    \ a foreign agent instead of\n   proper network access authentication is an example\
    \ of protocol\n   misuse.  The Registration Required flag allows a foreign agent\
    \ to\n   force authentication even when the agent is not involved in any\n   Mobile\
    \ IPv4 signalling (co-located care-of address case).  This\n   enables the use\
    \ of a mobility-specific protocol for an unrelated\n   functionality.\n   PANA\
    \ will carry EAP above IP in order to enable any authentication\n   method on\
    \ any link-layer.  EAP can already be carried by [IEEE-\n   802.1X] and PPP. \
    \ IEEE 802.1X can only be used on unbridged IEEE 802\n   links, hence it only\
    \ applies to limited link types.  Inserting PPP\n   between IP and a link-layer\
    \ can be perceived as a way to enable EAP\n   over that particular link-layer,\
    \ but using PPP for this reason has\n   the aforementioned drawbacks and is not\
    \ a good choice.  While IEEE\n   802.1X and PPP can continue to be used in their\
    \ own domains, they do\n   not take away the need to have a protocol like PANA.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Usage Scenarios\n   PANA will be applicable to various types of\
    \ networks.  Based on the\n   presence of lower-layer security prior to running\
    \ PANA, the following\n   types cover all possibilities:\n   a) Physically secured\
    \ networks (e.g., DSL networks).  Although data\n      traffic is always carried\
    \ over a physically secured link, the\n      client might need to be authenticated\
    \ and authorized when\n      accessing the IP services.\n   b) Networks where\
    \ L1-L2 is already cryptographically secured before\n      enabling IP (e.g.,\
    \ cdma2000 networks).  Although the client is\n      authenticated on the radio\
    \ link before enabling ciphering, it\n      additionally needs to get authenticated\
    \ and authorized for\n      accessing the IP services.\n   c) No lower-layer security\
    \ present before enabling IP.  PANA is run\n      in an insecure network.  PANA-based\
    \ access authentication is used\n      to bootstrap cryptographic per-packet authentication\
    \ and integrity\n      protection.\n   PANA is applicable to not only large-scale\
    \ operator deployments with\n   full AAA infrastructure, but also to small disconnected\
    \ deployments\n   like home networks and personal area networks.\n   Since PANA\
    \ enables decoupling AAA from the link-layer procedures,\n   network access authentication\
    \ does not have to take place during the\n   link establishment.  This allows\
    \ deferring client authentication\n   until the client attempts to access differentiated\
    \ services (e.g.,\n   high bandwidth, unlimited access, etc.) in some deployments.\n\
    \   Additionally, multiple simultaneous network access sessions over the\n   same\
    \ link-layer connection can occur as well.\n   The following five scenarios capture\
    \ the PANA usage model in\n   different network architectures with reference to\
    \ its placement of\n   logical elements such as the PANA Client (PaC) and the\
    \ PANA\n   Authentication Agent (PAA) with respect to the Enforcement Point (EP)\n\
    \   and the Access Router (AR).  Note that PAA may or may not use AAA\n   infrastructure\
    \ to verify the credentials of PaC in order to authorize\n   network access.\n\
    \   Scenario 1: PAA co-located with EP but separated from AR\n   In this scenario\
    \ (Figure 1), PAA is co-located with the enforcement\n   point on which access\
    \ control is performed.  This might be the case\n   where PAA is co-located with\
    \ the L2 access device (e.g., an IP-\n   capable switch).\n               PaC\

    \ from AR.\n   Scenario 2: PAA co-located with AR but separated from EP\n   In\
    \ this scenario, PAA is not co-located with EPs but is placed on the\n   AR. \
    \ Although we have shown only one AR here, there could be multiple\n   ARs, one\
    \ of which is co-located with the PAA.  Access control\n   parameters have to\
    \ be distributed to the respective enforcement\n   points so that the corresponding\
    \ device on which PaC is authenticated\n   can access the network.  A separate\
    \ protocol is needed between PAA\n   and EP to carry access control parameters.\n\

    \ separated from EP\n   Scenario 3: PAA co-located with EP and AR\n   In this\
    \ scenario (Figure 3), PAA is co-located with the EP and AR on\n   which access\
    \ control and routing are performed.\n              PaC ----- EP/PAA/AR--+\n \
    \                                  |\n                                   +-------(AAA)\n\

    \        Figure 3: PAA co-located with EP and AR.\n   Scenario 4: Separated PAA,\
    \ EP, and AR\n   In this scenario, PAA is neither co-located with EPs nor with\
    \ ARs.\n   It still resides on the same IP link as ARs.  After successful\n  \
    \ authentication, access control parameters will be distributed to\n   respective\
