- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Diameter base protocol specification [2] defines security\n\
    \   protection between neighboring Diameter peers.  Diameter mandates\n   that\
    \ peer connections must be protected by Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS) [6]\
    \ for TCP, by Datagram TLS (DTLS) [7] for the Stream Control\n   Transmission\
    \ Protocol (SCTP), or by security mechanisms that are\n   independent of Diameter\
    \ (such as IPsec [5]).  These security\n   protocols offer a wide range of security\
    \ properties, including entity\n   authentication, data-origin authentication,\
    \ integrity protection,\n   confidentiality protection, and replay protection.\
    \  They also support\n   a large number of cryptographic algorithms, algorithm\
    \ negotiation,\n   and different types of credentials.  It should be understood\
    \ that\n   TLS/DTLS/IPsec in the Diameter context does not provide end-to-end\n\
    \   security unless the Diameter nodes are direct peers, i.e.,\n   neighboring\
    \ Diameter nodes.  The current Diameter security is\n   realized hop by hop.\n\
    \   The need to also offer additional security protection of AVPs between\n  \
    \ non-neighboring Diameter nodes was recognized very early in the work\n   on\
    \ Diameter.  This led to work on Diameter security using the\n   Cryptographic\
    \ Message Syntax (CMS) [3].  However, due to the lack of\n   deployment interest\
    \ at that time (and the complexity of the developed\n   solution), the specification\
    \ was never completed.\n   In the meanwhile, Diameter had received a lot of deployment\
    \ interest\n   from the cellular operator community, and because of the\n   sophistication\
    \ of those deployments, the need for protecting Diameter\n   AVPs between non-neighboring\
    \ nodes resurfaced.  Since the early 2000s\n   (when the work on [3] was discontinued),\
    \ the Internet community has\n   seen advances in cryptographic algorithms (for\
    \ example, authenticated\n   encryption algorithms), and new security building\
    \ blocks have been\n   developed.\n   This document specifies requirements for\
    \ developing a solution to\n   protect Diameter AVPs between non-neighboring Diameter\
    \ nodes.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL\
    \ NOT',\n   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].\n   This document\
    \ reuses terminology from the Diameter base specification\n   [2].\n   In the\
    \ figures below, AVP refers to an unprotected AVP, and {AVP}k\n   refers to an\
    \ AVP that experiences security protection (using key \"k\")\n   without further\
    \ distinguishing between integrity and confidentiality\n   protection.\n   The\
    \ following terms are also used in this document:\n   AAA broker\n      An entity\
    \ that manages Authentication, Authorization, and\n      Accounting (AAA) traffic\
    \ between roaming partner networks.\n   AAA broker network\n      A network operated\
    \ by a AAA broker, which consists of necessary\n      AAA functions to provide\
    \ AAA brokering services for its customer\n      AAA networks.\n   Diameter firewall\n\
    \      A Diameter firewall is a proxy (or a relay) agent that acts\n      similarly\
    \ to conventional IP traffic firewalls but only at the\n      Diameter AVP and\
    \ command level.  A Diameter firewall may, for\n      example, discard AVPs that\
    \ violate security policy, thus\n      preventing them from traversing the firewall.\
    \  The Diameter\n      firewall may even discard entire Diameter messages based\
    \ on the\n      security policy.\n"

    \                   Figure 1: Example Diameter Deployment\n   Eavesdropping: \
    \ Some Diameter applications carry information that is\n      only intended for\
    \ consumption by end points, either by the\n      Diameter client or by the Diameter\
    \ server but not by\n      intermediaries.  As an example, consider the Diameter\
    \ Extensible\n      Authentication Protocol (EAP) application [4] that allows\
    \ the\n      transport of keying material between the Diameter server to the\n\
    \      Diameter client (using the EAP-Master-Session-Key AVP) for the\n      protection\
    \ of the air interface (i.e., the wireless link) between\n      the end device\
    \ (such as a mobile phone; not shown in the figure)\n      and the Network Access\
    \ Server (NAS).  The content of the EAP-\n      Master-Session-Key AVP should\
    \ benefit from protection against\n      eavesdropping by intermediaries.  Other\
    \ AVPs (for example, those\n      listed in Section 13.3 of [2]) might also carry\
    \ sensitive personal\n      data that, when collected by intermediaries, allow\
    \ for traffic\n      analysis.\n      In the context of the deployment shown in\
    \ Figure 1, the adversary\n      could, for example, be in the AAA broker network.\n\
    \   Injection and Manipulation:  The Diameter base protocol specification\n  \
    \    mandates security protection between neighboring nodes, but\n      Diameter\
    \ agents may be compromised or misconfigured and inject or\n      manipulate AVPs.\
    \  To detect such actions, additional security\n      protection needs to be applied\
    \ at the Diameter layer.\n      Nodes that could launch such an attack are any\
    \ Diameter agents\n      along the end-to-end communication path.\n   Impersonation:\
    \  Imagine a case where a Diameter message from\n      Example.net contains information\
    \ claiming to be from Example.org.\n      This would either require strict verification\
    \ at the edge of the\n      AAA broker network or cryptographic assurance at the\
    \ Diameter\n      layer to prevent a successful impersonation attack.\n      Any\
    \ Diameter realm could launch such an attack aiming for\n      financial benefits\
    \ or to disrupt service availability.\n"

- title: 5.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Requirements\n   Requirement #1:  The solution MUST support an extensible\
    \ set of\n      cryptographic algorithms.\n         Motivation: Solutions MUST\
    \ be able to evolve to adapt to\n         evolving cryptographic algorithms and\
    \ security requirements.\n         This may include the provision of a modular\
    \ mechanism to allow\n         cryptographic algorithms to be updated without\
    \ substantial\n         disruption to deployed implementations.\n   Requirement\
    \ #2:  The solution MUST support confidentiality,\n      integrity, and data-origin\
    \ authentication.  Solutions for\n      integrity protection MUST work in a backwards-compatible\
    \ way with\n      existing Diameter applications and therefore be able to traverse\n\
    \      legacy proxy and relay agents.\n   Requirement #3:  The solution MUST support\
    \ replay protection.\n   Requirement #4:  The solution MUST support the ability\
    \ to delegate\n      security functionality to another entity.\n         Motivation:\
    \ As described in Section 4, the ability to let a\n         Diameter proxy perform\
    \ security services on behalf of all\n         clients within the same administrative\
    \ domain is important for\n         incremental deployability.  The same applies\
    \ to the other\n         communication side where a load balancer terminates security\n\
    \         services for the servers it interfaces.\n   Requirement #5:  The solution\
    \ MUST be able to selectively apply its\n      cryptographic protection to certain\
    \ Diameter AVPs.\n         Motivation: Some Diameter applications assume that\
    \ certain AVPs\n         are added, removed, or modified by intermediaries.  As\
    \ such, it\n         must be possible to apply security protection selectively.\n\
    \         Furthermore, there are AVPs that must not be confidentiality\n     \
    \    protected but may still be integrity protected, such as those\n         required\
    \ for Diameter message routing.\n   Requirement #6:  The solution MUST define\
    \ a mandatory-to-implement\n      cryptographic algorithm.\n         Motivation:\
    \ For interoperability purposes, it is beneficial to\n         have a mandatory-to-implement\
    \ cryptographic algorithm specified\n         (unless profiles for specific usage\
    \ environments specify\n         otherwise).\n   Requirement #7:  The solution\
    \ MUST support symmetric keys and\n      asymmetric keys.\n         Motivation:\
    \ Symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms\n         provide different\
    \ security services.  Asymmetric algorithms,\n         for example, allow non-repudiation\
    \ services to be offered.\n   Requirement #8:  A solution for dynamic key management\
    \ MUST be\n      included in the overall solution framework.\n         However,\
    \ it is assumed that no \"new\" key management protocol\n         needs to be\
    \ developed; instead, existing ones are reused, if at\n         all possible.\
    \  Rekeying could be triggered by (a) management\n         actions and (b) expiring\
    \ keying material.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This entire document focuses on the discussion\
    \ of new functionality\n   for securing Diameter AVPs selectively between non-neighboring\
    \ nodes.\n   Various security threats are mitigated by selectively applying\n\
    \   security protection for individual Diameter AVPs.  Without\n   protection,\
    \ there is the possibility for password sniffing,\n   confidentiality violation,\
    \ and AVP insertion, deletion, or\n   modification.  Additionally, applying a\
    \ digital signature offers non-\n   repudiation capabilities, a feature not yet\
    \ available in today's\n   Diameter deployment.  Modification of certain Diameter\
    \ AVPs may not\n   necessarily be the act of malicious behavior but could also\
    \ be the\n   result of misconfiguration.  An over-aggressively configured\n  \
    \ firewalling Diameter proxy may also remove certain AVPs.  In most\n   cases,\
    \ data-origin authentication and integrity protection of AVPs\n   will provide\
    \ the most benefits for existing deployments with minimal\n   overhead and (potentially)\
    \ operate in a full-backwards compatible\n   manner.\n"
