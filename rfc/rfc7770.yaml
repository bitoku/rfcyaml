  - "Abstract\n   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to\n\
    \   know the capabilities of their neighbors and other routers in the\n   routing\
    \ domain.  This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and\n   OSPFv3 for advertising\
    \ optional router capabilities.  The Router\n   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement\
    \ (LSA) is defined for this\n   purpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented\
    \ with an Opaque\n   LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with\
    \ a unique\n   LSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be\n\
    \   advertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or\n   autonomous\
    \ system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by\n   providing a revised specification\
    \ that includes support for\n   advertisement of multiple instances of the RI\
    \ LSA and a TLV for\n   functional capabilities.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFv3]\n\
    \   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other\n   routers\
    \ in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the\n   advertisement and\
    \ discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.\n   Throughout this document, OSPF\
    \ will be used when the specification is\n   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\
    \  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3\n   will be used when the text is protocol specific.\n\
    \   OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise\n   optional\
    \ router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in\n   this field\
    \ have been allocated so additional optional capabilities\n   cannot be advertised.\
    \  This document describes extensions to OSPF to\n   advertise these optional\
    \ capabilities via Opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 and\n   LSAs with a unique type in OSPFv3.\
    \  For existing OSPF capabilities,\n   backwards compatibility issues dictate\
    \ that this advertisement is\n   used primarily for informational purposes.  For\
    \ future OSPF\n   extensions, this advertisement MAY be used as the sole mechanism\
    \ for\n   advertisement and discovery.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by\
    \ providing a revised specification\n   including support for advertisement of\
    \ multiple instances of the RI\n   LSA and a TLV for functional capabilities.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Summary of Changes from RFC 4970
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Summary of Changes from RFC 4970\n   This document includes the following\
    \ changes from RFC 4970 [RFC4970]:\n   1. The main change is that an OSPF router\
    \ will be able to advertise\n      multiple instances of the OSPF Router Information\
    \ LSA.  This\n      change permeates through much of the document.\n   2. Additionally,\
    \ Section 2.6 includes an additional TLV for\n      functional capabilities. \
    \ This is in contrast to the existing TLV\n      that is used to advertise capabilities\
    \ for informational purposes\n      only.\n   3. The IANA allocation policy has\
    \ been changed from \"Standards\n      Action\" to \"IETF Review\" [IANA-GUIDE]\
    \ for the following\n      registries:\n      o  OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes\n \
    \     o  OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs\n      o  OSPF Router Informational\
    \ Capability Bits\n      o  OSPF Router Functional Capability Bits\n   4. Finally,\
    \ references have been updated for documents that have\n      become RFCs and\
    \ RFCs that have been obsoleted since the\n      publication of RFC 4970.\n"

- title: 2.7.  Flooding Scope of the Router Information LSA
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Flooding Scope of the Router Information LSA\n   The flooding scope for\
    \ a Router Information LSA is determined by the\n   LSA type.  For OSPFv2, a type\
    \ 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped),\n   or type 11 (AS-scoped) Opaque LSA\
    \ may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the S1\n   and S2 bits in the LSA type determine\
    \ the flooding scope.  If AS-wide\n   flooding scope is chosen, the originating\
    \ router should also\n   advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby\
    \ Area\n   (NSSA) area(s).  An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities\n\
    \   when both NSSA area-scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are\n   advertised.\
    \  This allows functional capabilities to be limited in\n   scope.  For example,\
    \ a router may be an area border router but only\n   support traffic engineering\
    \ (TE) in a subset of its attached areas.\n   The choice of flooding scope is\
    \ made by the advertising router and is\n   a matter of local policy.  The originating\
    \ router MAY advertise\n   multiple RI LSAs with the same Instance ID as long\
    \ as the flooding\n   scopes differ.  TLV flooding-scope rules will be specified\
    \ on a per-\n   TLV basis and MUST be specified in the accompanying specifications\n\
    \   for future Router Information LSA TLVs.\n"
- title: 3.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.  Backwards Compatibility\n   For backwards compatibility, previously advertised\
    \ Router Information\n   TLVs SHOULD continue to be advertised in the first instance,\
    \ i.e., 0,\n   of the Router Information LSA.  If a Router Information TLV is\n\
    \   advertised in multiple Router Information LSA instances and the\n   multiple\
    \ instance processing is not explicitly specified in the RFC\n   defining that\
    \ Router Information TLV, the Router Instance TLV in the\n   Router Information\
    \ LSA with the numerically smallest Instance ID will\n   be used and subsequent\
    \ instances will be ignored.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes both a generic mechanism\
    \ for advertising\n   router capabilities and TLVs for advertising informational\
    \ and\n   functional capabilities.  The capability TLVs are less critical than\n\
    \   the topology information currently advertised by the base OSPF\n   protocol.\
    \  The security considerations for the generic mechanism are\n   dependent on\
    \ the future application and, as such, should be described\n   as additional capabilities\
    \ are proposed for advertisement.  Security\n   considerations for the base OSPF\
    \ protocol are covered in [OSPF] and\n   [OSPFv3].\n"
