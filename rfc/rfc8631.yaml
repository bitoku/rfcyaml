- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources\
    \ that\n   are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service\n\
    \   provider.  Often, these sets of resources are referred to as \"Web\n   services\"\
    \ or \"Web APIs\".  This specification defines link relations\n   that represent\
    \ relationships from Web services or APIs to resources\n   that provide documentation,\
    \ descriptions, metadata, or status\n   information for these resources.  Documentation\
    \ is primarily intended\n   for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily\
    \ intended for\n   automated consumers.  Metadata provides information about a\
    \ service's\n   context.  This specification also defines a link relation to identify\n\
    \   status resources that are used to represent information about service\n  \
    \ status.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible\
    \ to\n   interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the\n   specifics\
    \ of the resource.  Following the practices described in Web\n   architecture\
    \ [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215] by using URIs, HTTP, and\n   media types, the Web's\
    \ uniform interface allows interactions with\n   resources without the more complex\
    \ binding procedures often necessary\n   with other approaches.\n   Many resources\
    \ on the Web are provided as part of a set of resources\n   that are referred\
    \ to as a \"Web service\" or a \"Web API\".  In many\n   cases, these services\
    \ or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and\n   it may be desirable for\
    \ clients to be able to discover this service\n   information.\n   Service information\
    \ that provides information on how to use service\n   resources can be broadly\
    \ separated into two categories: One category\n   primarily targets human users\
    \ and often uses generic representations\n   for human readable documents, such\
    \ as HTML or PDF.  The other\n   category is structured information that follows\
    \ a more formalized\n   description model and is primarily intended for consumption\
    \ by\n   machines -- for example, tools and code libraries.\n   In the context\
    \ of this memo, the human-oriented variant is referred\n   to as \"documentation\"\
    , and the machine-oriented variant is referred\n   to as \"description\".\n  \
    \ These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as\n   representations\
    \ have been proposed that are intended for both human\n   consumption and interpretation\
    \ by machine clients.  In addition, a\n   typical pattern for service documentation/descriptions\
    \ is that there\n   is human-oriented, high-level documentation that is intended\
    \ to put a\n   service in context and explain the general model, which is\n  \
    \ complemented by machine-level descriptions that are intended as\n   detailed\
    \ technical descriptions of the service.  These two resources\n   could be interlinked,\
    \ but since they are intended for different\n   audiences, it can make sense to\
    \ provide entry points for both of\n   them.\n   In addition, while both documentation\
    \ and descriptions may be\n   provided as part of a Web service, there may be\
    \ other information as\n   well.  Generally speaking, a Web service may have any\
    \ metadata/\n   resources associated with it (with documentation and descriptions\n\
    \   being two specific kinds of resources).  If there is a way in which\n   all\
    \ of these metadata/resources can be represented, then it should be\n   possible\
    \ to find such a resource that provides access to general Web\n   service metadata.\n\
    \   In addition to these resources about mostly static aspects of a Web\n   service,\
    \ this memo also defines a link relation that allows providers\n   of a Web service\
    \ to link to a resource that represents status\n   information about the service.\
    \  This information often represents\n   operational information that allows service\
    \ consumers to retrieve\n   information about \"service health\" and related issues.\n\
    \   This memo places no constraints on the specific representations used\n   for\
    \ all of these resources.  It simply allows providers of a Web\n   service to\
    \ make the documentation, descriptions, metadata, and status\n   of their services\
    \ discoverable and defines link relations that serve\n   that purpose.\n"

- title: 3.  Web Services
  contents:
  - "3.  Web Services\n   \"Web Services\" or \"Web APIs\" (sometimes also referred\
    \ to as \"HTTP\n   API\" or \"REST API\") expose information and services on the\
    \ Web.\n   Following the principles of Web architecture\n   [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215],\
    \ they expose URI-identified resources,\n   which are then accessed and transferred\
    \ using a specific\n   representation.  Many services use representations that\
    \ contain\n   links, and these links are often typed links.\n   Using typed links,\
    \ resources can identify relationship types to other\n   resources.  RFC 8288\
    \ [RFC8288] establishes a framework of registered\n   link relation types, which\
    \ are identified by simple strings and\n   registered in an IANA registry.  Any\
    \ resource that supports typed\n   links according to RFC 8288 can then use these\
    \ identifiers to\n   represent resource relationships on the Web without having\
    \ to\n   reinvent registered relation types.\n   In recent years, Web services,\
    \ as well as their documentation and\n   description languages, have gained popularity\
    \ due to the general\n   popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information\
    \ and\n   services.  However, the design of documentation and description\n  \
    \ languages varies according to a number of factors, such as the\n   general application\
    \ domain, the preferred application data model, and\n   the preferred approach\
    \ for exposing services.\n   This specification allows service providers to use\
    \ a unified method\n   to link to service documentation and/or descriptions. \
    \ This link\n   should not make any assumptions about the provided type of\n \
    \  documentation and/or descriptions, so service providers can choose\n   those\
    \ that best fit their services and needs.\n   This specification also allows service\
    \ providers to link to general\n   service metadata.  One part of the metadata\
    \ may have links to\n   documentation and/or description as well as other information\
    \ about a\n   service, such as deployment or operational information.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Documenting Web Services
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Documenting Web Services\n   In the context of this specification, \"documentation\"\
    \ refers to\n   information that is primarily intended for human consumption.\n\
    \   Typical representations of this kind of documentation are HTML and\n   PDF.\n\
    \   Documentation is often structured, but its structure depends on the\n   structure\
    \ of the service in question as well as the specific way in\n   which the authors\
    \ choose to present it.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Describing Web Services
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Describing Web Services\n   In the context of this specification, \"description\"\
    \ refers to\n   information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.\n\
    \   Typical representations are dictated by the technology underlying the\n  \
    \ service itself, which means that description formats in today's\n   technology\
    \ landscape are based on XML, JSON, Resource Description\n   Framework (RDF),\
    \ and a variety of other structured data models.  In\n   each of those technologies,\
    \ there may be a variety of languages\n   defined to serve the same general purpose\
    \ of describing a Web\n   service.\n   Descriptions are always structured, but\
    \ the structuring principles\n   depend on the nature of the described service.\
    \  For example, one of\n   the earlier service description approaches, the Web\
    \ Services\n   Description Language (WSDL), uses \"operations\" as its core concept,\n\
    \   which are essentially identical to function calls because the\n   underlying\
    \ model is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model.\n   Other description\
    \ languages for non-RPC approaches to services will\n   use different structuring\
    \ approaches, such as structuring service\n   descriptions by URIs and/or URI\
    \ patterns.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Unified Documentation/Description
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Unified Documentation/Description\n   If service providers use an approach\
    \ where there is no distinction\n   between service documentation (Section 3.1)\
    \ and service description\n   (Section 3.2), then they may not feel the need to\
    \ use two separate\n   links.  In such a case, an alternative approach is to use\
    \ the\n   previously defined \"service\" link relation type [RFC5023], which does\n\
    \   not indicate whether it links to documentation or description and\n   thus\
    \ may be a better fit if no such differentiation is required.\n"
- title: 4.  Link Relations for Web Services
  contents:
  - "4.  Link Relations for Web Services\n   In order to allow Web services to represent\
    \ the relation of\n   individual resources to service documentation/description\
    \ and\n   metadata, this specification introduces and registers three new link\n\
    \   relation types.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type\n   The \"service-doc\" link relation\
    \ type is used to represent the fact\n   that a resource or a set of resources\
    \ is documented at a specific\n   URI.  The target resource is expected to provide\
    \ documentation that\n   is primarily intended for human consumption.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type\n   The \"service-desc\" link relation\
    \ type is used to represent the fact\n   that a resource or a set of resources\
    \ is described at a specific URI.\n   The target resource is expected to provide\
    \ a service description that\n   is primarily intended for machine consumption.\
    \  In many cases, it is\n   provided in a representation that is consumed by tools,\
    \ code\n   libraries, or similar components.\n"
- title: 4.3.  The service-meta Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "4.3.  The service-meta Link Relation Type\n   The \"service-meta\" link relation\
    \ type is used to link to available\n   metadata for the service context of a\
    \ resource.  Service metadata is\n   any kind of data that may be of interest\
    \ to existing or potential\n   service users, with documentation/description being\
    \ only two possible\n   facets of service metadata.  The target resource is expected\
    \ to\n   provide a representation that is primarily intended for machine\n   consumption.\
    \  In many cases, it is provided in a representation that\n   is consumed by tools,\
    \ code libraries, or similar components.\n   Since service metadata can have many\
    \ different purposes and use many\n   different representations, it may make sense\
    \ for representations\n   using the \"service-meta\" link relation to offer additional\
    \ hints\n   about the specific kind or format of metadata that is being linked.\n\
    \   This definition of the \"service-meta\" link relation makes no specific\n\
    \   assumptions about how these link hints will be represented, and the\n   specific\
    \ mechanism will depend on the context where the \"service-\n   meta\" link relation\
    \ is being used.\n   One example is that a \"service-desc\" link may identify\
    \ an OpenAPI\n   description, which is supposed to be the machine-readable description\n\
    \   of a Web API.  A \"service-meta\" link may identify a resource that\n   contains\
    \ additional metadata about the Web API, such as labels that\n   classify the\
    \ API according to a labeling scheme and a privacy policy\n   that makes statements\
    \ about how the Web API manages personally\n   identifiable information.\n"
- title: 5.  Web Service Status Resources
  contents:
  - "5.  Web Service Status Resources\n   Web services providing access to one or\
    \ more resources often are\n   hosted and operated in an environment for which\
    \ status information\n   may be available.  This information may be as simple\
    \ as confirming\n   that a service is operational, or it may provide additional\n\
    \   information about different aspects of a service and/or a history of\n   status\
    \ information, possibly listing incidents and their resolution.\n   The \"status\"\
    \ link relation type can be used to link to such a status\n   resource, allowing\
    \ service consumers to retrieve information about a\n   Web service's status.\
    \  Such a link may not be available for and from\n   all resources provided by\
    \ a Web service -- only from key resources\n   such as a Web service's metadata\
    \ resource and/or a service's home\n   resource (i.e., a resource analogous to\
    \ the home page of a Web site).\n   This memo does not restrict the representation\
    \ of a status resource\n   in any way.  It may be primarily focused on human or\
    \ machine\n   consumption or a combination of both.  It may be a simple \"traffic\n\
    \   light\" indicator for service health or a more sophisticated\n   representation\
    \ conveying more detailed information, such as service\n   subsystems and/or a\
    \ status history.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Web service providers should be aware that service\
    \ descriptions and\n   documentation may be used by attackers to gain additional\
    \ information\n   about a service (particularly its implementation) and to test\
    \ for\n   known security issues.  It may thus be advisable to restrict service\n\
    \   descriptions and documentation to aspects of a service that are\n   necessary\
    \ and to exclude any details that are not necessary for using\n   the service.\n\
    \   Another potential security issue for Web service providers is that\n   publishing\
    \ service descriptions and documentation may generally allow\n   clients (both\
    \ malicious and otherwise) more automated and systematic\n   access to a service.\
    \  It may therefore be possible that more of a\n   service's potential vulnerabilities\
    \ are made easier to find and\n   exploit or simply that a service might receive\
    \ more load because it\n   is accessed by automated clients.\n   Web service consumers\
    \ should be aware that service descriptions and\n   documentation can be out of\
    \ sync or simply incorrect.  Blindly\n   trusting service descriptions and documentation\
    \ (particularly when\n   descriptions are retrieved and interpreted programmatically)\
    \ is not a\n   safe practice.  Web service consumers SHOULD always assume that\n\
    \   service descriptions and documentation may be incorrect and SHOULD\n   therefore\
    \ be prepared to handle errors at runtime.\n"
