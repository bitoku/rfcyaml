Abstract RFC 5328 registered the Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace "dvb" for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project.
This document updates RFC 5328 with new registrant information.
Introduction [RFC5328] registered the Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace "dvb" for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project.
Since the publication of that RFC, the registrant contact information has changed; this document updates the registrant information to make it current.
It uses a role based email address to reduce the need for updates in the future.
This replaces the "Registration Information" and "Declared registrant of the namespace" fields in the registration, specified in Section 2 of RFC 5328.
The new information for those fields is as follows:
Registration Information: Version: 2 Date: 2014 08 11
Declared registrant of the namespace:
All other fields in the registration information are unchanged and remain as specified in RFC 5328.
There are no security considerations for this registration update.
In the "Formal URN Namespaces" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn namespaces), IANA has added a reference to this RFC, in addition to RFC 5328, for the "dvb" namespace registration.
The reference field now contains two RFC numbers.
