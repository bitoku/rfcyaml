    \                PREFACE\n   This is the final report of the National Research\
    \ Council Committee\n   on Computer-Computer Communication Protocols.  The committee\
    \ was\n   established in May l983 at the request of the Department of Defense\n\
    \   (DOD) and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), Department of\n   Commerce,\
    \ to develop recommendations and guidelines for resolving\n   differences between\
    \ the two agencies on a data communications\n   transport protocol standard.\n\
    \   Computer-based information and transaction-processing systems are\n   basic\
    \ tools in modern industry and government.  Over the past several\n   years there\
    \ has been a growing demand to transfer and exchange\n   digitized data in these\
    \ systems quickly and accurately.  This demand\n   for data transfer and exchange\
    \ has been both among the terminals and\n   computers within an organization and\
    \ among those in different\n   organizations.\n   Rapid electronic transport of\
    \ digitized data requires electronic\n   communication links that tie the elements\
    \ together.  These links are\n   established, organized, and maintained by means\
    \ of a layered series\n   of procedures performing the many functions inherent\
    \ in the\n   communications process.  The successful movement of digitized data\n\
    \   depends upon the participants using identical or compatible\n   procedures,\
    \ or protocols.\n   The DOD and NBS have each developed and promulgated a transport\n\
    \   protocol as standard.  The two protocols, however, are dissimilar and\n  \
    \ incompatible.  The committee was called to resolve the differences\n   between\
    \ these protocols.\n   The committee held its first meeting in August l983 at\
    \ the National\n   Research Council in Washington, D.C.  Following this two-day\
    \ meeting\n   the committee held five more two-day meetings, a three-day meeting,\n\
    \   and a one-week workshop.\n   The committee was briefed by personnel from both\
    \ agencies.  In\n   addition, the committee heard from Jon Postel, University\
    \ of Southern\n   California's Information Sciences Institute; Dave Oran, Digital\n\
    \   Equipment Corporation; Vinton Cerf, MCI; David Wood, The Mitre\n   Corporation;\
    \ Clair Miller, Honeywell, and Robert Follett, IBM,\n   representing the Computer\
    \ and Business Equipment Manufacturer's\n   Association; and John Newman, Ultimate\
    \ Corporation.  In most cases\n   the briefings were followed by discussion.\n\

    \ and Robert Blanc of the NBS, Institute of Computer Sciences\n"

    \           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n   Computer communication networks have become\
    \ a very important part of\n   military and commercial operations.  Indeed, the\
    \ nation is becoming\n   dependent upon their efficiency and reliability, and\
    \ the recent\n   proliferation of networks and their widespread use have emphasized\n\
    \   the importance of developing uniform conventions, or protocols, for\n   communication\
    \ between computer systems.  The Department of Defense\n   (DOD) and the National\
    \ Bureau of Standards (NBS) have been actively\n   engaged in activities related\
    \ to protocol standardization.  This\n   report is concerned primarily with recommendations\
    \ on protocol\n   standardization within the Department of Defense.\n   Department\
    \ of Defense's Transmission Protocol\n      The DOD's Defense Advanced Research\
    \ Projects Agency (DARPA) has\n      been conducting and supporting research on\
    \ computer networks for\n      over fifteen years (1).  These efforts led to the\
    \ development of\n      modern packet-switched network design concepts.  Transmission\n\
    \      between computers is generally accomplished by packet switching\n     \
    \ using strict protocols for the control and exchange of messages.\n      The\
    \ Advanced Research Projects Agency network (ARPANET),\n      implemented in the\
    \ early 1970s, provided a testing ground for\n      research on communications\
    \ protocols.  In 1978, after four years\n      of development, the DOD promulgated\
    \ versions of its Transmission\n      Control Protocol (TCP) and an Internet Protocol\
    \ (IP) and mandated\n      their use as standards within the DOD.  TCP is now\
    \ widely used and\n      accepted.  These protocols meet the unique operational\
    \ and\n      functional requirements of the DOD, and any changes in the\n    \
    \  protocols are viewed with some trepidation by members of the\n      department.\
    \  DOD representatives have stated that standardizing\n      TCP greatly increased\
    \ the momentum within the DOD toward\n      establishing interoperability between\
    \ networks within the DOD.\n   International Standards Organization's Transport\
    \ Protocol\n      The NBS Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology (ICST),\
    \ in\n      cooperation with the DOD, many industrial firms, and the\n      International\
    \ Standards Organization (ISO), has developed a new\n      international standard\n\
    \      Transport Protocol (TP-4) and a new Internetwork Protocol (2).\n      These\
    \ protocols will soon be available as commercial products.\n      Although in\
    \ part derived from TCP, the new protocols are not\n      compatible with TCP\

    \ unique needs that could be affected by the Transport\n      and Internet Protocol\
    \ layers.  Although all data networks must\n      have some of these capabilities,\
    \ the DOD's needs for operational\n      readiness, mobilization, and war-fighting\
    \ capabilities are\n      extreme.  These needs include the following:\n     \
    \    Survivability--Some networks must function, albeit at reduced\n         performance,\
    \ after many nodes and links have been destroyed.\n         Security--Traffic\
    \ patterns and data must be selectively\n         protected through encryption,\
    \ access control, auditing, and\n         routing.\n         Precedence--Systems\
    \ should adjust the quality of service on the\n         basis of priority of use;\
    \ this includes a capability to preempt\n         services in cases of very high\
    \ priority.\n         Robustness--The system must not fail or suffer much loss\
    \ of\n         capability because of unpredicted situations, unexpected loads,\n\
    \         or misuse.  An international crisis is the strongest test of\n     \
    \    robustness, since the system must operate immediately and with\n        \
    \ virtually full performance when an international situation\n         flares\
    \ up unexpectedly.\n         Availability--Elements of the system needed for operational\n\
    \         readiness or fighting must be continuously available.\n         Interoperability--Different\
    \ elements of the Department must be\n         able to \"talk\" to one another,\
    \ often in unpredicted ways\n         between parties that had not planned to\
    \ interoperate.\n      These operational needs reflect themselves into five technical\
    \ or\n      managerial needs:\n         1.   Functional and operational specifications\
    \ (that is, will\n              the protocol designs meet the operational needs?);\n\
    \         2.   Maximum interoperability;\n         3.   Minimum procurement, development,\
    \ and support costs;\n"

    \ of transition to new protocols; and\n         5.   Manageability and responsiveness\
    \ to changing DOD\n              requirements.\n      These are the criteria against\
    \ which DOD options for using the ISO\n      transport and internet protocols\
    \ should be evaluated.\n      Interoperability is a very important DOD need. \
    \ Ideally, DOD\n      networks would permit operators at any terminal to access\
    \ or be\n      accessed by applications in any computer.  This would provide more\n\
    \      network power for users, integration of independently developed\n     \
    \ systems, better use of resources, and increased survivability.  To\n      increase\
    \ interoperability, the Office of the Secretary of Defense\n      has mandated\
    \ the use of TCP for the Defense Communication System's\n      Defense Data Network\
    \ (DDN), unless waivers are granted.  In\n      addition, the Defense Communication\
    \ Agency (DCA) is establishing\n      standards for three higher-level \"utility\"\
    \ protocols for file\n      transfer, terminal access, and electronic mail.  Partly\
    \ as a\n      result of these actions, it has become clear that there is growing\n\
    \      momentum toward accepting interoperability and a recognition that\n   \
    \   it is an important operational need.\n      It is very important, however,\
    \ to recognize that functional\n      interoperability is only achieved with full\
    \ generality when two\n      communication nodes can interoperate at all protocol\
    \ levels.  For\n      the DOD the relevant levels are as follows:\n         1.\
    \   Internet, using IP;\n         2.   Transport, using TCP;\n         3.   Utility,\
    \ using file, terminal, or mail protocols; and\n         4.   Specific applications\
    \ that use the above protocols for\n              their particular purpose.\n\
    \      Accordingly, if a network is developed using one transport\n      protocol,\
    \ it would generally not be able to interoperate\n      functionally with other\
    \ networks using the same transport protocol\n      unless both networks were\
    \ also using the higher-level utility and\n      application protocols.  In evaluating\
    \ whether or not to convert to\n      TP-4 and in developing a transition plan,\
    \ the following factors\n      must be considered:\n         The DOD contains\
    \ numerous communities of interest whose\n         principal need is to interoperate\
    \ within their own members,\n"

    \ The DOD Intelligence Information System\n         (DODIIS) and the World Wide\
    \ Military Command and Control System\n         (WWMCCS) are examples. Interoperability\
    \ is needed primarily\n         between the higher layer applications programs\
    \ initially unique\n         to each community of interest.\n         There are\
    \ many different kinds of operations needed between\n         communities of interest.\
    \  Examples of such operations are\n         headquarters' need for access to\
    \ several subordinate\n         communities and the communities' need for some\
    \ minimum\n         functional interoperability with each other (such as mail\n\
    \         exchange).\n         The need for functional interoperability can arise,\n\
    \         unexpectedly and urgently, at a time of crisis or when improved\n  \
    \       management opportunities are discovered.  Widespread\n         standardization\
    \ of TP-4 and higher-level protocols can readily\n         help to achieve these\
    \ needs.  Often, special development of\n         additional applications that\
    \ cost time and money will be\n         necessary.\n         The DOD needs functional\
    \ interoperability with many important\n         external agencies that are committed\
    \ to ISO standards:  The\n         North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\
    \ some intelligence\n         and security agencies, and other parts of the federal\n\
    \         government.\n         The same objectives that have prompted the use\
    \ of standardized\n         protocols at higher-level headquarters will lead to\
    \ their use\n         by tactical groups in the field.\n   SOME COMPARISONS\n\
    \      A detailed comparison of the DOD Transmission Control Protocol and\n  \
    \    the ISO Transport Protocol indicates they are functionally\n      equivalent\
    \ and provide essentially similar services.  Because it\n      is clear that a\
    \ great deal of care and experience in protocol\n      development have gone into\
    \ generating the specifications for TP-4,\n      the committee is confident that\
    \ TP-4 will meet military\n      requirements.\n      Although there are differences\
    \ between the two protocols, they do\n      not compromise DOD requirements. \
    \ And, although in several areas,\n      including the data transfer interface,\
    \ flow control, connection\n      establishment, and out-of-band, services are\
    \ provided in different\n      ways by the two protocols, neither seems intrinsically\
    \ superior.\n"

    \ TP-4 is gaining rapidly due to the worldwide support for and\n      acceptance\
    \ of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) international\n      standards.  Experimental\
    \ TCP implementations were completed in\n      1974 at Stanford University and\

    \      Operations have been satisfactory and its use is growing.  A\n      number\
    \ of TCP implementations are also in commercial use in\n      various private\
    \ networks.\n      In contrast, TP-4 has not yet been implemented in any large\n\

    \  and has received endorsement by many commercial vendors worldwide.\n      In\
    \ addition, substantial portions of TP-4 have been demonstrated\n      at the\
    \ National Computer Conference in July 1984.\n      The Internet Protocol (IP)\
    \ part of the standards is not believed\n      to be a problem.  The ISO IP is\
    \ not as far along as TP-4, but it\n      is much less complex.  The ISO IP, based\
    \ very strongly on the DOD\n      IP, became a draft international standard in\
    \ April 1984.\n      The rapidity of the progress in ISO and the results achieved\
    \ over\n      the past two years have surprised even the supporters of\n     \
    \ international standards. The reasons for this progress are\n      twofold: \
    \ strong market demands stemming from the growing\n      integration of communications\
    \ and data processing and the progress\n      in networking technology over the\
    \ past years as the result of ARPA\n      and commercial developments.\n     \
    \ Although the DOD networks have been a model upon which the ISO\n      transport\
    \ standards have been built, the rest of the world is\n      adopting TP-4. Because\
    \ the DOD represents a small fraction of the\n      market and because the United\
    \ States supports the ISO standard, it\n      is not realistic to hope that TP-4\
    \ can be altered to conform with\n      TCP.  This raises the question as to what\
    \ action should be taken\n      by the DOD with respect to the ISO standard.\n"

    \ CONSIDERATIONS\n      The DOD has a large and growing commitment in operational\
    \ TCP\n      networks, and this will increase by 50 to 100 percent in the next\n\
    \      eighteen months.  This rate of investment will probably continue\n    \
    \  for the next five years for new systems and the upgrading of\n      current\
    \ ones.  The current Military Network (MILNET) and Movement\n      Information\
    \ Network (MINET) systems are expanding and will shortly\n      be combined. \
    \ The Strategic Air Command Digital Information\n      Network (SACDIN) and DODIIS\
    \ are undergoing major upgrading.  When\n      these changes are completed, there\
    \ are plans to upgrade the WWMCCS\n      Intercomputer Network (WIN) and to add\
    \ separate SECRET and TOP\n      SECRET networks.  There are plans to combine\
    \ these six networks in\n      the late 1980s, and they will become interoperable\
    \ and multilevel\n      secure using an advanced technology now under development.\
    \  If\n      these plans are implemented on schedule, a delay of several years\n\
    \      in moving to TP-4 would mean that the DOD networks in the late\n      1980s\
    \ would be virtually all TCP-based. Subsequent conversion to\n      international\
    \ standards would be very expensive if hastily\n      attempted in order to maintain\
    \ established DOD interoperability\n      and gain interoperability with a large\
    \ body of users.\n      As the Department of Defense policy recognizes, there\
    \ are\n      significant advantages in using commercial vendor products if they\n\
    \      meet the department's operational needs.  The major advantages are\n  \
    \    as follows:\n         Costs to the DOD for development, production, and maintenance\n\
    \         are significantly lower because (1) vendors spread the cost\n      \
    \   over a much larger user base, (2) commercial vendors are\n         generally\
    \ more efficient in their operations, and (3) vendors\n         look for ways\
    \ to improve their product to meet competition.\n         The department generally\
    \ gets more effective products because\n         vendors integrate the protocol\
    \ functions into their entire\n         software and hardware product line.  Thus\
    \ the DOD may be able\n         eventually to use commercial software products\
    \ that are built\n         on top of, and thereby take advantage of, the transport\n\
    \         protocols.\n         By depending on industry to manage the development\
    \ and\n         maintenance of products, the department can use its scarce\n \
    \        management and technical resources on activities unique to its\n    \
    \     mission.\n      Because the costs of transport and internet protocol development\n\
    \      and maintenance are so intertwined with other factors, it is\n"

    \ commercial products.  Savings will vary in\n      individual cases.  The marginal\
    \ savings should range from 30 to 80\n      percent.\n   RECOMMENDATIONS\n   \
    \   The ISO protocols are now well specified but will not generally be\n     \
    \ commercially available for many months.  Nevertheless, this\n      committee\
    \ believes that the principles on which they are based are\n      well-established,\
    \ and the protocols can be made to satisfy fully\n      DOD's needs.  The committee\
    \ recommends that the DOD move toward\n      adoption of TP-4 as costandard with\
    \ TCP and toward exclusive use\n      of TP-4.\n      Transition to the use of\
    \ the ISO standards, however, must be\n      managed in a manner that will maintain\
    \ DOD's operational\n      capabilities and minimize risks.  The timing of the\
    \ transition is,\n      therefore, a major concern.\n      Descriptions of two\
    \ options that take this requirement into\n      account follow.  A majority of\
    \ the committee recommends the first\n      option, while a minority favors the\
    \ second.  A third option--to\n      defer action--is also described but not recommended.\n\
    \      Option 1\n         The first option is for the DOD to immediately modify\
    \ its\n         current transport policy statement to specify TP-4 as a\n    \
    \     costandard along with TCP.  In addition, the DOD would develop\n       \
    \  a military specification for TP-4 that would also cover DOD\n         requirements\
    \ for discretionary options allowed under the NBS\n         protocol specifications.\
    \  Requests for proposals (RFPs) for new\n         networks or major upgrades\
    \ of existing networks would specify\n         TP-4 as the preferred protocol.\
    \  Contracts for TP-4 systems\n         would be awarded only to contractors providing\
    \ commercial\n         products, except for unique cases.\n         Existing networks\
    \ that use TCP and new networks firmly\n         committed to the use of TCP-based\
    \ systems could continue to\n         acquire implementations of TCP.  The DOD\
    \ should carefully\n         review each case, however, to see whether it would\
    \ be\n         advantageous to delay or modify some of these acquisitions in\n\
    \         order to use commercial TP-4 products.  For each community of\n    \

    \ most advantageous to replace its current or\n         planned systems in order\
    \ to conform to ISO standards without\n         excessively compromising continued\
    \ operations.\n         United States government test facilities would be developed\
    \ to\n         enable validation of TP-4 products (4).  The Department of\n  \
    \       Defense would either require that products be validated using\n      \
    \   these test facilities or that they be certified by the vendor.\n         The\
    \ test facilities could also be used to isolate multivendor\n         protocol\
    \ compatibility problems.  The existing NBS validation\n         tools should\
    \ be used as the base for the DOD test facilities.\n         Because under this\
    \ option networks based on both TCP and TP-4\n         would coexist for some\
    \ time, several capabilities that\n         facilitate interoperability among\
    \ networks would need to be\n         developed.  The Department of Defense generally\
    \ will not find\n         them commercially available.  Examples are gateways\
    \ among\n         networks or specialized hosts that provide services such as\n\
    \         electronic mail.  The department would need to initiate or\n       \
    \  modify development programs to provide these capabilities, and\n         a\
    \ test and demonstration network would be required.\n      Option 2\n        \
    \ Under Option 2 the Department of Defense would immediately\n         announce\
    \ its intention to adopt TP-4 as a transport protocol\n         costandard with\
    \ TCP after a satisfactory demonstration of its\n         suitability for use\
    \ in military networks.  A final commitment\n         would be deferred until\
    \ the demonstration has been evaluated\n         and TP-4 is commercially available.\n\
    \         The demonstration should take at most eighteen months and\n        \
    \ should involve development of TP-4 implementations and their\n         installation.\
    \  This option differs from Option 1 primarily in\n         postponing the adoption\
    \ of a TP-4 standard and, consequently,\n         the issuance of RFPs based on\
    \ TP-4 until successful completion\n         of a demonstration.  The department,\
    \ however, should proceed\n         with those provisions of Option 1 that may\
    \ be completed in\n         parallel with the demonstration.  Early issuance of\
    \ a TP-4\n         military specification, development of validation procedures,\n\
    \         and implementation of means for interoperability would be\n        \
    \ particularly important in this regard.\n"

  - "Executive Summary of the NRC Report Transport on Protocols\n      Option 3\n\
    \         Under the third option the DOD would continue using TCP as the\n   \
    \      accepted transport standard and defer any decision on the use\n       \
    \  of TP-4 indefinitely.  The department would be expected to stay\n         well\
    \ informed on the development and use of the new protocol in\n         the commercial\
    \ and international arena and, with the National\n         Bureau of Standards,\
    \ work on means to transfer data between the\n         two protocol systems. \
    \ Testing and evaluation of TP-4 standards\n         by NBS would continue.  The\
    \ DOD might eventually accommodate\n         both protocol systems in an evolutionary\
    \ conversion to TP-4.\n      Comparison of Options\n         The committee believes\
    \ that all three options equally satisfy\n         the functional objectives of\
    \ the DOD, including matters of\n         security.  It believes the two protocols\
    \ are sufficiently\n         similar and no significant differences in performance\
    \ are to be\n         expected if the chosen protocol implementation is of equal\n\
    \         quality and is optimized for the given environment.\n         The primary\
    \ motivation for recommending Option 1 is to obtain\n         the benefits of\
    \ standard commercial products in the\n         communication protocol area at\
    \ an early date.  Benefits include\n         smaller development, procurement,\
    \ and support costs; more\n         timely updates; and a wider product availability.\
    \ By\n         immediately committing to TP-4 as a costandard for new systems,\n\
    \         Option 1 minimizes the number of systems that have to be\n         converted\
    \ eventually from TCP.  The ability to manage the\n         transition is better\
    \ than with Option 2 since the number of\n         systems changed would be smaller\
    \ and the time duration of mixed\n         TCP and TP-4 operation would be shorter.\
    \ Interoperability with\n         external systems (NATO, government, commercial),\
    \ which\n         presumably will also use TP-4, would be brought about more\n\
    \         quickly. Option 1 involves greater risk, however, since it\n       \
    \  commits to a new approach without as complete a demonstration\n         of\
    \ its viability.\n         As with Option 1, a primary benefit of following Option\
    \ 2 would\n         be obtaining the use of standard commercial products.  Unit\n\
    \         procurement costs probably would be lower than with Option 1\n     \
    \    because the commercial market for TP-4 will have expanded\n         somewhat\
    \ by the time DOD would begin to buy TP-4 products.\n         Risk is smaller,\
    \ compared to Option 1, because testing and\n         demonstration of the suitability\
    \ for military use will have\n         preceded the commitment to the ISO protocols.\
    \  Transition and\n         support costs would be higher than for Option 1, however,\n"

    \ more networks and systems would already have been\n         implemented with\

    \ the largest number of system conversions\n         and the longest interval\
    \ of mixed TCP and TP-4 operations would\n         occur.  In addition, interoperability\

    \         The principal benefit of exercising Option 3 would be the\n        \
    \ elimination of transition cost and the risk of faulty system\n         behavior\
    \ and delay.  It would allow the most rapid achievement\n         of full internal\
    \ interoperability among DOD systems.\n         Manageability should be good because\
    \ only one set of protocols\n         would be in use (one with which the DOD\

    \ most rapid path toward the\n         use of commercial products and interoperability\
    \ with external\n         systems.  Option 2 reduces the risk but involves somewhat\n\

    \ accompanied by penalties of incompatibility with NATO\n         and other external\
    \ systems and higher life-cycle costs.\n   NOTES:\n      (1)  The Advanced Research\
