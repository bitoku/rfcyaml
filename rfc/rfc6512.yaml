  - "Abstract\n   The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and\n\
    \   Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (\"MP LSPs\") contains a\n \
    \  field that identifies the address of a \"root node\".  Intermediate\n   nodes\
    \ are expected to be able to look up that address in their\n   routing tables.\
    \  However, this is not possible if the route to the\n   root node is a BGP route\
    \ and the intermediate nodes are part of a\n   BGP-free core.  This document specifies\
    \ procedures that enable an MP\n   LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.\
    \  In these procedures,\n   the root node address is temporarily replaced by an\
    \ address that is\n   known to the intermediate nodes and is on the path to the\
    \ true root\n   node.\n"

    \ Equivalence Class (FEC) element encodings: \"Point-to-Multipoint\"\n   (P2MP),\
    \ \"Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Upstream\", and \"MP2MP\n   Downstream\"\

    \         Figure 1: mLDP FEC Element Encoding\n   Note that a P2MP or MP2MP Label\
    \ Switched Path (\"MP LSP\") is\n   identified by the combination of a \"root\
    \ node\" and a variable length\n   \"opaque value\".  The root node also plays\
    \ a special role in the mLDP\n   procedures:  mLDP messages that are \"about\"\
    \ a particular MP LSP are\n   forwarded to the LDP adjacency that is the next\
    \ hop on the route to\n   the root node.\n   Sometimes, it is desirable for an\
    \ MP LSP to pass through a part of\n   the network in which there is no route\
    \ to the root node.  For\n   instance, consider the topology of Figure 2.\n  \
    \         CE1----PE1---P1---- ...----P2 ----PE2----CE2----R\n                \
    \                Figure 2\n   In Figure 2, CE1 and CE2 are \"Customer Edge routers\"\
    , R is a customer\n   router at the same VPN site as CE2, and PE1 and PE2 are\
    \ \"Provider\n   Edge routers\".  Suppose that PE1 has a BGP-learned route for\
    \ R, with\n   PE2 as the BGP next hop.  Suppose also that the provider's interior\n\
    \   routers (such as P1 and P2) do not have any BGP-learned routes and,\n   in\
    \ particular, do not have any routes to R.\n   In such an environment, unicast\
    \ data packets from CE1 addressed to R\n   would get encapsulated by PE1, tunneled\
    \ to PE2, decapsulated by PE2,\n   and forwarded to CE2.\n   Suppose now that\
    \ CE1 is trying to set up an MP LSP whose root is R,\n   and the intention is\
    \ that the provider's network will participate in\n   the construction of the\
    \ LSP.  Then, the mLDP messages identifying the\n   LSP must be passed from CE1\
    \ to PE1, from PE1 to P1, ..., from P2 to\n   PE2, from PE2 to CE2, and from CE2\
    \ to R.\n   To begin the process, CE1 creates an MP FEC element with the address\n\
    \   of R as the root node address and passes that FEC element via mLDP to\n  \
    \ PE1.  However, PE1 cannot use this same FEC element to identify the\n   LSP\
    \ in the LDP messages it sends to P1, because P1 does not have a\n   route to\
    \ R.\n   However, PE1 does know that PE2 is the BGP next hop on the path to R.\n\
    \   What is needed is a method whereby:\n   -  PE1 can tell P1 to set up an LSP\
    \ as if the root node were PE2,\n   -  PE2 can determine that the LSP in question\
    \ is really rooted at R,\n      not at PE2 itself, and\n   -  PE2 can determine\
    \ the original FEC element that CE1 passed to PE1,\n      so that PE2 can pass\
    \ it on to CE2.\n   This document defines the procedures that allow CE1 to create\
    \ an LSP\n   rooted at R.  These procedures require PE1 to modify the MP FEC\n\
    \   element before sending an mLDP message to P1.  The modified FEC\n   element\
    \ has PE2 as the root and the original FEC element as the\n   opaque value.  This\
    \ requires a new type of opaque value.  Since the\n   opaque value contains a\
    \ FEC element, we call this a \"Recursive Opaque\n   Value\".  When PE2 sends\
    \ an mLDP message to CE2, it replaces the FEC\n   element with the opaque value,\
    \ thus undoing the recursion.  Details\n   are in Section 2.\n   Section 3 defines\
    \ the \"VPN-Recursive Opaque Value\".  Whereas the\n   \"Recursive Opaque Value\"\
    \ carries the original FEC, the \"VPN-Recursive\n   Opaque Value\" carries the\
    \ original FEC plus a Route Distinguisher\n   (RD).  This is applicable when MP\
    \ LSPs are being used to carry the\n   multicast traffic of a VPN [MVPN].  Details\
    \ are in Section 3.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Procedures\n   In the topology of Figure 2, let us suppose that CE1 sends\
    \ PE1 an MP\n   FEC element whose root node is R and whose opaque value is Q.\
    \  We\n   will refer to this FEC element as \"CE1-FEC\".  We may think of CE1-FEC\n\
    \   as an ordered pair, as follows:\n       CE1-FEC = <root=R, opaque_value=Q>.\n\
    \   PE1 determines that the root node R matches a BGP route, with a BGP\n   next\
    \ hop of PE2.  PE1 also knows by its configuration that the\n   interior routers\
    \ on the path to PE2 are \"BGP-free\" and thus have no\n   route to R.\n   PE1\
    \ therefore creates a new MP FEC element, whose root node address\n   is the address\
    \ of PE2 and whose opaque value is a Recursive Opaque\n   Value whose value field\
    \ contains CE1-FEC.  We refer to this FEC\n   element as PE2-FEC:\n       PE2-FEC\
    \ = <root=PE2, opaque_value=CE1-FEC>, i.e.,\n       PE2-FEC = <root=PE2, opaque_value=<root=R,\n\
    \                                          opaque_value=Q>>\n   PE1 then sends\
    \ this FEC element to P1.\n   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they\
    \ are being\n   requested to build an MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST\
    \ NOT\n   interpret the opaque value at all.\n   When PE2-FEC arrives at PE2,\
    \ PE2 notes that it (PE2) is the\n   identified root node and that the opaque\
    \ value is a Recursive Opaque\n   Value.  Therefore, PE2 MUST replace PE2-FEC\
    \ with the contents of the\n   Recursive Opaque Value (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before\
    \ doing any further\n   processing.  This will result in CE1-FEC being sent on\
    \ to CE2, and\n   further from CE2 to R.  Note that CE1-FEC will contain the LSP\
    \ root\n   node specified by CE1; the presumption is that PE2 has a route to\n\
    \   this root node.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Non-Segmented Inter-AS P-Tunnels\n   Consider the inter-AS (Autonomous\
    \ System) VPN scenario depicted in\n   Figure 5.\n           PE1 --- P1 ---- ASBR1\
    \ ... ASBR2 ---- P2 ---- PE2\n                                Figure 5\n   Suppose\
    \ this is an \"option B\" VPN interconnect ([VPN], Section 10).\n   This means\
    \ that the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) in the\n   first Autonomous\
    \ System (i.e., ASBR1) does not have a route to PE\n   routers in other ASes (such\
    \ as PE2).  Suppose also that the Multicast\n   VPN (MVPN) policy is to instantiate\
    \ Provider Multicast Service\n   Interfaces (PMSIs) [MVPN] using mLDP and that\
    \ \"non-segmented inter-AS\n   P-tunnels\" [MVPN] are being used.\n   In this\
    \ scenario, PE1 may need to join a P2MP or MP2MP LSP whose root\n   is PE2.  P1\
    \ has no route to PE2, and all PE1 knows about the route to\n   PE2 is that ASBR1\
    \ is the BGP next hop.  Since P1 has no root to PE2,\n   PE1 needs to originate\
    \ an mLDP message with a FEC element that\n   identifies ASBR1 as the root.  This\
    \ FEC element must contain enough\n   information to enable ASBR1 to find the\
    \ next hop towards PE2 even\n   though ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2.\n \
    \  Although ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2, it does have a BGP\n   Intra-AS\
    \ Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) auto-discovery (A-D) route [MVPN]\n   whose Network\
    \ Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) contains PE2's IP\n   address together\
    \ with a particular RD.  PE1 also has this Inter-AS\n   I-PMSI A-D route.  The\
    \ LSP needs to be set up along the path\n   established by the Intra-AS I-PMSI\
    \ A-D routes.  Therefore, one must\n   use a Recursive FEC element that contains\
    \ the RD as well as the\n   address of PE2.  The \"VPN-Recursive FEC Element\"\
    \ defined herein is\n   used for this purpose.\n   This enables us to provide\
    \ the same functionality for mLDP P-tunnels\n   that is provided for PIM P-tunnels\
    \ in Section 8.1.3.2 of [MVPN]\n   through the use of the MVPN Join Attribute.\n\
    \   At PE1 in Figure 4, the LSP to be created is associated with a\n   particular\
    \ VPN Routing and Forwarding Table (VRF).  PE1 looks up in\n   that VRF the Intra-AS\
    \ I-PMSI A-D route originated by PE2.  It finds\n   that the BGP next hop of that\
    \ route is ASBR1.  So, it creates a P2MP\n   or MP2MP FEC element whose root is\
    \ ASBR1 and whose opaque value is a\n   VPN-Recursive FEC element.  The VPN-Recursive\
    \ FEC element itself\n   consists of a root, an RD, and an opaque value, set as\
    \ follows:\n   -  The root is PE2.\n   -  The RD is the RD from the NLRI of the\
    \ Intra-AS A-D route\n      originated by PE2.\n   -  The opaque value is chosen\
    \ (by some method outside the scope of\n      this document) so as to be unique\
    \ in the context of PE2.  (For\n      example, it may have been specified in a\
    \ PMSI Tunnel Attribute\n      originated by PE2.)  We will refer to this opaque\
    \ value as \"Q\".\n   The resulting FEC element can be informally represented\
    \ as\n       <root=ASBR1, opaque_value=<root=PE2, RD, opaque_value=Q>>.\n   PE1\
    \ can now begin setting up the LSP by using this FEC element in an\n   LDP Label\
    \ Mapping message sent towards ASBR1.\n   When ASBR1 receives, over a non-VRF\
    \ interface, an mLDP Label Mapping\n   message containing this FEC element, it\
    \ sees that it is the root and\n   that the opaque value is a VPN-Recursive Opaque\
    \ Value.  It parses the\n   VPN-Recursive Opaque value and extracts the root value,\
    \ PE2.\n   If ASBR1 has a route to PE2, it continues setting up the LSP by using\n\
    \   the following FEC element:\n       <root=PE2, opaque_value=Q>\n   However,\
    \ if ASBR1 does not have a route to PE2, it looks for an\n   Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D\
    \ route whose NLRI contains PE2's address along\n   with the specified RD value.\
    \  Say the BGP next hop of that route is\n   ASBR2.  Then ASBR1 continues setting\
    \ up the LSP by using the\n   following FEC element:\n       <root=ASBR2, opaque_value=<root=PE2,\
    \ RD, opaque_value=Q>>.\n   Note that in this case, the root has changed from\
    \ ASBR1 to ASBR2, but\n   the opaque value is the unchanged VPN-Recursive FEC\
    \ element.\n"

    \ a VRF.  Therefore, the FEC element created by PE1 must\n   contain some identifier\
    \ that PE2 can use to find the proper VRF in\n   which to look up the address\
    \ of R.\n   When PE1 looks up the address of R in a VRF, it will find a route\
    \ in\n   the VPN-IP address family.  The next hop will be PE2, but there will\n\
    \   also be a Route Distinguisher (RD) as part of that NLRI of the\n   matching\
    \ route.  In this case, the new FEC element created by PE1 has\n   the address\
    \ of PE2 as the root node address and has a VPN-Recursive\n   Opaque Value.  The\
    \ value field of the VPN-Recursive Opaque Value\n   consists of the 8-octet RD\
    \ followed by CE1-FEC.\n   As far as the interior routers are concerned, they\
    \ are being\n   requested to build an MP LSP whose root node is PE2.  They MUST\
    \ NOT\n   interpret the opaque value at all.\n   When an mLDP Label Mapping message\
    \ containing PE2-FEC arrives at PE2\n   over a VRF interface, PE2 notes that it\
    \ is the identified root node\n   and that the opaque value is a VPN-Recursive\
    \ Opaque Value.\n   Therefore, it MUST replace PE2-FEC with the contents of the\n\
    \   VPN-Recursive Opaque Value (i.e., with CE1-FEC) before doing any\n   further\
    \ processing.  It uses the VRF to look up the path to R.  This\n   will result\
    \ in CE1-FEC being sent on to CE2, and presumably further\n   from CE2 to R.\n\
    \   In this scenario, the RD in the VPN-Recursive Opaque Value also\n   ensures\
    \ uniqueness of the FEC element within the inner carrier's\n   network.\n   This\
    \ way of providing Carrier's Carrier service has limited\n   applicability, as\
    \ it only works under the following conditions:\n   -  Both the inner carrier\
    \ and the outer carrier are using non-\n      segmented mLDP P-tunnels.\n   -\
    \  The inner carrier is not aggregating the P-tunnels of the outer\n      carrier\
    \ but is content to carry each such P-tunnel in a single\n      P-tunnel of its\
    \ own.\n   The Carrier's Carrier scenario can be distinguished from the inter-AS\n\
    \   scenario by the fact that in the former, the mLDP messages are being\n   exchanged\
    \ on VRF interfaces.\n"
