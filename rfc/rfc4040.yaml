  - "1.  Introduction\n   Voice over IP (VoIP) Media Gateways need to carry all possible\
    \ data\n   streams generated by analog terminals or integrated services digital\n\
    \   network (ISDN) terminals via an IP network.  Within this document a\n   VoIP\
    \ Media Gateway is a device that converts a (digital or analog)\n   linear data\
    \ stream to a digital packetized data stream or vice versa.\n   Refer to RFC 2719\
    \ [10] for an introduction into the basic\n   architecture of a Media Gateway\
    \ based network.\n   Usually a VoIP Media Gateway does some processing on the\
    \ data it\n   converts besides packetization or depacketization; i.e. echo\n \
    \  cancellation or dual tone multifrequency (DTMF) detection, and\n   especially\
    \ a coding/decoding.  But there is a class of data streams\n   that does not rely\
    \ on or allow any data processing within the VoIP\n   Media Gateway except for\
    \ packetization or depacketization.  ISDN data\n   terminals i.e. will produce\
    \ data streams that are not compatible with\n   a non-linear encoding as used\
    \ for voice.\n   For such applications, there is a necessity for a transparent\
    \ relay\n   of 64 kbit/s data streams in real-time transport protocol (RTP) [4]\n\
    \   packets.  This mode is often referred to as \"clear-channel data\" or\n  \
    \ \"64 kbit/s unrestricted\".  No encoder/decoder is needed in that case,\n  \
    \ but a unique RTP payload type is necessary and a related MIME type is\n   to\
    \ be registered for signaling purposes.\n   Clearmode is not restricted to the\
    \ examples described above.  It can\n   be used by any application, that does\
    \ not need a special\n   encoding/decoding for transfer via a RTP connection.\n\
    \   This payload format document describes a pseudo-codec called\n   \"Clearmode\"\
    , for sample oriented 64 kbit/s data streams with 8 bits\n   per sample.  It is\
    \ in accordance with RFC 2736 [1], which provides a\n   guideline for the specification\
    \ of new RTP payload formats.\n   Examples for the current use of Clearmode are\
    \ the transfer of \"ISDN 7\n   kHz voice\" and \"ISDN data\" in VoIP Media Gateways.\n\
    \   This document also serves as the MIME type registration according to\n   RFC\
    \ 2045 [2] and RFC 2048 [3], which defines procedures for\n   registration of\
    \ new MIME types within the IETF tree.\n"

- title: 3.  64 kbit/s Data Stream Handling and RTP Header Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.  64 kbit/s Data Stream Handling and RTP Header Parameters\n   Clearmode does\
    \ not use any encoding or decoding.  It just provides\n   packetization.\n   Clearmode\
    \ assumes that the data to be handled is sample oriented with\n   one octet (8bits)\
    \ per sample.  There is no restriction on the number\n   of samples per packet\
    \ other than the 64 kbyte limit imposed by the IP\n   protocol.  The number of\
    \ samples SHOULD be less than the path maximum\n   transmission unit (MTU) minus\
    \ combined packet header length.  If the\n   environment is expected to have tunnels\
    \ or security encapsulation as\n   part of operation, the number of samples SHOULD\
    \ be reduced to allow\n   for the extra header space.\n   The payload packetization/depacketization\
    \ for Clearmode is similar to\n   the Pulse Code Modulation (PCMU or PCMA) handling\
    \ described in RFC\n   3551 [5].  Each Clearmode octet SHALL be octet-aligned\
    \ in an RTP\n   packet.  The sign bit of each octet SHALL correspond to the most\n\
    \   significant bit of the octet in the RTP packet.\n   A sample rate of 8000\
    \ Hz MUST be used.\n   This calculates to a 64 kbit/s transmission rate per channel.\n\
    \   The Timestamp SHALL be set as described in RFC 3550 [4].\n   The marker bit\
    \ is always zero.  Silence suppression is not applicable\n   for Clearmode data\
    \ streams.\n   The payload type is dynamically assigned and is not presented in\
    \ this\n   document.\n   RTP header fields not mentioned here SHALL be used as\
    \ specified in\n   RFC 3550 [4] and any applicable profile.\n   This document\
    \ specifies the use of RTP over unicast and multicast UDP\n   as well as TCP.\
    \  (This does not preclude the use of this definition\n   when RTP is carried\
    \ by other lower-layer protocols.)\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document registers the following MIME subtype:\
    \ audio/clearmode.\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of MIME\
    \ media type audio/clearmode\n   MIME media type name: audio\n   MIME subtype\
    \ name: clearmode\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: ptime,\
    \ maxptime\n             \"ptime\" gives the length of time in milliseconds\n\
    \             represented by the media in a packet, as described in RFC\n    \
    \         2327 [6].\n             \"maxptime\" represents the maximum amount of\
    \ media, which\n             can be encapsulated in each packet, expressed as\
    \ time in\n             milliseconds, as described in RFC 3267 [9].\n   Encoding\
    \ considerations:\n             This type is only defined for transfer via RTP\
    \ [4].\n   Security considerations:\n             See Section 6 of RFC 4040\n\
    \   Interoperability considerations: none\n   Published specification: RFC 4040\n\
    \   Applications, which use this media type:\n             Voice over IP Media\
    \ Gateways, transferring \"ISDN 64 kb/s\n             data\", \"ISDN 7 kHz voice\"\
    , or other 64 kbit/s data streams\n             via an RTP connection\n      \
    \       Note: the choice of the \"audio\" top-level MIME type was\n          \
    \   made because the dominant uses of this pseudo-codec are\n             expected\
    \ to telephony and voice-gateway-related.  The\n             \"audio\" type allows\
    \ the use of sharing of the port in the\n             SDP \"m=\" line with codecs\
    \ such as audio/g711 [6], [7], for\n             one example.  This sharing is\
    \ an important application and\n             would not be possible otherwise.\n\

- title: 5.  Mapping to Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.  Mapping to Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters\n   Parameters are\
    \ mapped to SDP [6] in a standard way.\n       o  The MIME type (audio) goes in\
    \ SDP \"m=\" as the media name.\n       o  The MIME subtype (clearmode) goes in\
    \ SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as the\n          encoding name.\n       o  The optional parameters\
    \ \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" go in the SDP\n          \"a=ptime\" and \"a=maxptime\"\
    \ attributes, respectively.\n   An example mapping is as follows:\n       audio/clearmode;\
    \ ptime=10\n       m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 97\n       a=rtpmap:97 CLEARMODE/8000\n\
    \       a=ptime:10\n   Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in\
    \ the RTP\n   Profile are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly\n\
    \   shown in lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both\n   places.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Implementations using the payload format defined\
    \ in this\n   specification are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in\n   the RFC 3550 [4].  The payload format described in this document does\n\
    \   not specify any different security services.  The primary function of\n  \
    \ this payload format is to add a transparent transport for a 64 kbit/s\n   data\
    \ stream.\n   Confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption,\
    \ for\n   example by application of the Secure RTP profile [11].\n   As with any\
    \ IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may\n   be overloaded simply\
    \ by the receipt of too many packets, either\n   desired or undesired.  Network-layer\
    \ authentication MAY be used to\n   discard packets from undesired sources, but\
    \ the processing cost of\n   the authentication itself may be too high.  Overload\
    \ can also occur,\n   if the sender chooses to use a smaller packetization period,\
    \ than the\n   receiver can process.  The ptime parameter can be used to negotiate\n\
    \   an appropriate packetization during session setup.\n   In general RTP is not\
    \ an appropriate transfer protocol for reliable\n   octet streams.  TCP is better\
    \ in those cases.  Besides that, packet\n   loss due to congestion is as much\
    \ an issue for clearmode, as for\n   other payload formats.  Refer to RFC 3551\
    \ [5], section 2, for a\n   discussion of this issue.\n"
