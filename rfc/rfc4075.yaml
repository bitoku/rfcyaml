  - "4.  Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Servers Option\n   The Simple Network
    Time Protocol servers option provides a list of\n   one or more IPv6 addresses
    of SNTP [3] servers available to the\n   client for synchronization.  The clients
    use these SNTP servers to\n   synchronize their system time to that of the standard
    time servers.\n   Clients MUST treat the list of SNTP servers as an ordered list.
    \ The\n   server MAY list the SNTP servers in decreasing order of preference.\n
    \  The option defined in this document can only be used to configure\n   information
    about SNTP servers that can be reached using IPv6.  The\n   DHCP option to configure
    information about IPv4 SNTP servers can be\n   found in RFC 2132 [4].  Mechanisms
    for configuring IPv4/IPv6 dual-\n   stack applications are being considered, but
    are not specified in\n   this document.\n   The format of the Simple Network Time
    Protocol servers option is as\n   shown below:\n       0                   1                   2

    messages other than the\n   following: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
    Information-\n   Request, and Reply.  If this option appears in messages other
    than\n   those specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.\n   The option
    number for this option MAY appear in the Option Request\n   Option [1] in the
    following messages:  Solicit, Request, Renew,\n   Rebind, Information-Request,
    and Reconfigure.  If this option number\n   appears in the Option Request Option
    in messages other than those\n   specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.\n"
  title: 5.  Appearance of This Option

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The SNTP servers option may be used by an intruder
    DHCPv6 server to\n   cause DHCPv6 clients to contact a rogue SNTP server, resulting
    in\n   invalid synchronization of time in the client, finally leading to\n   time-critical
    applications running inaccurately in the client\n   machine.  Time accuracy can
    be crucial to some security algorithms.\n   For example, expired certificates
    may gain a new life, making the\n   applications running on the client machine
    less secure.  The\n   inaccuracy can even cause clients to set their time incorrectly,\n
    \  making them vulnerable to replay attacks in protocols that use time\n   stamps
    to detect replays.\n   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCPv6 client
    SHOULD use\n   authenticated DHCPv6 (see the \"Authentication of DHCP messages\"\n
    \  section in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).\n"
