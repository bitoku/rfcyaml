  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) syntax specification\
    \ [RFC3986]\n   defined how a literal IPv6 address can be represented in the \"\
    host\"\n   part of a URI.  Two months later, the IPv6 Scoped Address\n   Architecture\
    \ specification [RFC4007] extended the text representation\n   of limited-scope\
    \ IPv6 addresses such that a zone identifier may be\n   concatenated to a literal\
    \ address, for purposes described in that\n   specification.  Zone identifiers\
    \ are especially useful in contexts in\n   which literal addresses are typically\
    \ used, for example, during fault\n   diagnosis, when it may be essential to specify\
    \ which interface is\n   used for sending to a link-local address.  It should\
    \ be noted that\n   zone identifiers have purely local meaning within the node\
    \ in which\n   they are defined, often being the same as IPv6 interface names.\
    \  They\n   are completely meaningless for any other node.  Today, they are\n\
    \   meaningful only when attached to addresses with less than global\n   scope,\
    \ but it is possible that other uses might be defined in the\n   future.\n   The\
    \ IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture specification [RFC4007] does not\n   specify\
    \ how zone identifiers are to be represented in URIs.\n   Practical experience\
    \ has shown that this feature is useful, in\n   particular when using a web browser\
    \ for debugging with link-local\n   addresses, but because it is undefined, it\
    \ is not implemented\n   consistently in URI parsers or in browsers.\n   Some\
    \ versions of some browsers directly accept the IPv6 Scoped\n   Address syntax\
    \ [RFC4007] for scoped IPv6 addresses embedded in URIs,\n   i.e., they have been\
    \ coded to interpret a \"%\" sign following the\n   literal address as introducing\
    \ a zone identifier [RFC4007], instead\n   of introducing two hexadecimal characters\
    \ representing some percent-\n   encoded octet [RFC3986].  Clearly, interpreting\
    \ the \"%\" sign as\n   introducing a zone identifier is very convenient for users,\
    \ although\n   it formally breaches the established URI syntax [RFC3986].  This\n\
    \   document defines an alternative approach that respects and extends\n   the\
    \ rules of URI syntax, and IPv6 literals in general, to be\n   consistent.\n \
    \  Thus, this document updates the URI syntax specification [RFC3986] by\n   adding\
    \ syntax to allow a zone identifier to be included in a literal\n   IPv6 address\
    \ within a URI.\n   It should be noted that in contexts other than a user interface,\
    \ a\n   zone identifier is mapped into a numeric zone index or interface\n   number.\
    \  The MIB textual convention InetZoneIndex [RFC4001] and the\n   socket interface\
    \ [RFC3493] define this as a 32-bit unsigned integer.\n   The mapping between\
    \ the human-readable zone identifier string and the\n   numeric value is a host-specific\
    \ function that varies between\n   operating systems.  The present document is\
    \ concerned only with the\n   human-readable string.\n   Several alternative solutions\
    \ were considered while this document was\n   developed.  Appendix A briefly describes\
    \ the various options and\n   their advantages and disadvantages.\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in \"Key words for use in\n  \
    \ RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\" [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Specification
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification\n   According to IPv6 Scoped Address syntax [RFC4007], a zone\
    \ identifier\n   is attached to the textual representation of an IPv6 address\
    \ by\n   concatenating \"%\" followed by <zone_id>, where <zone_id> is a string\n\
    \   identifying the zone of the address.  However, the IPv6 Scoped\n   Address\
    \ Architecture specification gives no precise definition of the\n   character\
    \ set allowed in <zone_id>.  There are no rules or de facto\n   standards for\
    \ this.  For example, the first Ethernet interface in a\n   host might be called\
    \ %0, %1, %en1, %eth0, or whatever the implementer\n   happened to choose.\n \
    \  In a URI, a literal IPv6 address is always embedded between \"[\" and\n   \"\
    ]\".  This document specifies how a <zone_id> can be appended to the\n   address.\
    \  According to URI syntax [RFC3986], \"%\" is always treated as\n   an escape\
    \ character in a URI, so, according to the established URI\n   syntax [RFC3986]\
    \ any occurrences of literal \"%\" symbols in a URI MUST\n   be percent-encoded\
    \ and represented in the form \"%25\".  Thus, the\n   scoped address fe80::a%en1\
    \ would appear in a URI as\n   http://[fe80::a%25en1].\n   A <zone_id> SHOULD\
    \ contain only ASCII characters classified as\n   \"unreserved\" for use in URIs\
    \ [RFC3986].  This excludes characters\n   such as \"]\" or even \"%\" that would\
    \ complicate parsing.  However, the\n   syntax described below does allow such\
    \ characters to be percent-\n   encoded, for compatibility with existing devices\
    \ that use them.\n   If an operating system uses any other characters in zone\
    \ or interface\n   identifiers that are not in the \"unreserved\" character set,\
    \ they MUST\n   be represented using percent encoding [RFC3986].\n   We now present\
    \ the necessary formal syntax.\n   The URI syntax specification [RFC3986] formally\
    \ defined the IPv6\n   literal format in ABNF [RFC5234] by the following rule:\n\
    \      IP-literal = \"[\" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) \"]\"\n   To provide support\
    \ for a zone identifier, the existing syntax of\n   IPv6address is retained, and\
    \ a zone identifier may be added\n   optionally to any literal address.  This\
    \ syntax allows flexibility\n   for unknown future uses.  The rule quoted above\
    \ from the previous URI\n   syntax specification [RFC3986] is replaced by three\
    \ rules:\n      IP-literal = \"[\" ( IPv6address / IPv6addrz / IPvFuture  ) \"\
    ]\"\n      ZoneID = 1*( unreserved / pct-encoded )\n      IPv6addrz = IPv6address\
    \ \"%25\" ZoneID\n   This syntax fills the gap that is described at the end of\
    \ Section\n   11.7 of the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture specification [RFC4007].\n\
    \   The established rules for textual representation of IPv6 addresses\n   [RFC5952]\
    \ SHOULD be applied in producing URIs.\n   The URI syntax specification [RFC3986]\
    \ states that URIs have a global\n   scope, but that in some cases their interpretation\
    \ depends on the\n   end-user's context.  URIs including a ZoneID are to be interpreted\n\
    \   only in the context of the host at which they originate, since the\n   ZoneID\
    \ is of local significance only.\n   The IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture specification\
    \ [RFC4007] offers\n   guidance on how the ZoneID affects interface/address selection\
    \ inside\n   the IPv6 stack.  Note that the behaviour of an IPv6 stack, if it\
    \ is\n   passed a non-null zone index for an address other than link-local, is\n\
    \   undefined.\n"
- title: 3.  Web Browsers
  contents:
  - "3.  Web Browsers\n   This section discusses how web browsers might handle this\
    \ syntax\n   extension.  Unfortunately, there is no formal distinction between\
    \ the\n   syntax allowed in a browser's input dialogue box and the syntax\n  \
    \ allowed in URIs.  For this reason, no normative statements are made\n   in this\
    \ section.\n   Due to the lack of defined syntax, web browsers have been\n   inconsistent\
    \ in providing for ZoneIDs.  Many have no support, but\n   there are examples\
    \ of ad hoc support.  For example, some versions of\n   Firefox allowed the use\
    \ of a ZoneID preceded by a bare \"%\" character,\n   but this feature was removed\
    \ for consistency with established syntax\n   [RFC3986].  As another example,\
    \ some versions of Internet Explorer\n   allow use of a ZoneID preceded by a \"\
    %\" character encoded as \"%25\",\n   still beyond the syntax allowed by the established\
    \ rules [RFC3986].\n   This syntax extension is in fact used internally in the\
    \ Windows\n   operating system and some of its APIs.\n   It is desirable for all\
    \ browsers to recognise a ZoneID preceded by a\n   percent-encoded \"%\".  In\
    \ the spirit of \"be liberal with what you\n   accept\", we also suggest that\
    \ URI parsers accept bare \"%\" signs when\n   possible (i.e., a \"%\" not followed\
    \ by two valid and meaningful\n   hexadecimal characters).  This would make it\
    \ possible for a user to\n   copy and paste a string such as \"fe80::a%en1\" from\
    \ the output of a\n   \"ping\" command and have it work.  On the other hand, \"\
    %ee1\" would\n   need to be manually rewritten to \"fe80::a%25ee1\" to avoid any\
    \ risk of\n   misinterpretation.\n   Such bare \"%\" signs are for user interface\
    \ convenience, and need to\n   be turned into properly encoded characters (where\
    \ \"%25\" encodes \"%\")\n   before the URI is used in any protocol or HTML document.\
    \  However,\n   URIs including a ZoneID have no meaning outside the originating\
    \ node.\n   It would therefore be highly desirable for a browser to remove the\n\
    \   ZoneID from a URI before including that URI in an HTTP request.\n   The normal\
    \ diagnostic usage for the ZoneID syntax will cause it to be\n   entered in the\
    \ browser's input dialogue box.  Thus, URIs including a\n   ZoneID are unlikely\
    \ to be encountered in HTML documents.  However, if\n   they do (for example,\
    \ in a diagnostic script coded in HTML), it would\n   be appropriate to treat\
    \ them exactly as above.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from the URI syntax\
    \ specification\n   [RFC3986] and the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture specification\n\
    \   [RFC4007] apply.  In particular, this URI format creates a specific\n   pathway\
    \ by which a deceitful zone index might be communicated, as\n   mentioned in the\
    \ final security consideration of the Scoped Address\n   Architecture specification.\
    \  It is emphasised that the format is\n   intended only for debugging purposes,\
    \ but of course this intention\n   does not prevent misuse.\n   To limit this\
    \ risk, implementations MUST NOT allow use of this format\n   except for well-defined\
    \ usages, such as sending to link-local\n   addresses under prefix fe80::/10.\
    \  At the time of writing, this is\n   the only well-defined usage known.\n  \
    \ An HTTP client, proxy, or other intermediary MUST remove any ZoneID\n   attached\
    \ to an outgoing URI, as it has only local significance at the\n   sending host.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Options Considered
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Options Considered\n   The syntax defined above allows a ZoneID\
    \ to be added to any IPv6\n   address.  The 6man WG discussed and rejected an\
    \ alternative in which\n   the existing syntax of IPv6address would be extended\
    \ by an option to\n   add the ZoneID only for the case of link-local addresses.\
    \  It was\n   felt that the solution presented in this document offers more\n\
    \   flexibility for future uses and is more straightforward to implement.\n  \
    \ The various syntax options considered are now briefly described.\n   1.  Leave\
    \ the problem unsolved.\n       This would mean that per-interface diagnostics\
    \ would still have\n       to be performed using ping or ping6:\n       ping fe80::a%en1\n\
    \       Advantage: works today.\n       Disadvantage: less convenient than using\
    \ a browser.\n   2.  Simply use the percent character:\n       http://[fe80::a%en1]\n\
    \       Advantage: allows use of browser; allows cut and paste.\n       Disadvantage:\
    \ invalid syntax under RFC 3986; not acceptable to\n       URI community.\n  \
    \ 3.  Simply use an alternative separator:\n       http://[fe80::a-en1]\n    \
    \   Advantage: allows use of browser; simple syntax.\n       Disadvantage: Requires\
    \ all IPv6 address literal parsers and\n       generators to be updated in order\
    \ to allow simple cut and paste;\n       inconsistent with existing tools and\
    \ practice.\n       Note: The initial proposal for this choice was to use an\n\
    \       underscore as the separator, but it was noted that this becomes\n    \
    \   effectively invisible when a user interface automatically\n       underlines\
    \ URLs.\n   4.  Simply use the \"IPvFuture\" syntax left open in RFC 3986:\n \
    \      http://[v6.fe80::a_en1]\n       Advantage: allows use of browser.\n   \
    \    Disadvantage: ugly and redundant; doesn't allow simple cut and\n       paste.\n\
    \   5.  Retain the percent character already specified for introducing\n     \
    \  zone identifiers for IPv6 Scoped Addresses [RFC4007], and then\n       percent-encode\
    \ it when it appears in a URI, according to the\n       already-established URI\
    \ syntax rules [RFC 3986]:\n       http://[fe80::a%25en1]\n       Advantage: allows\
    \ use of browser; consistent with general URI\n       syntax.\n       Disadvantage:\
    \ somewhat ugly and confusing; doesn't allow simple\n       cut and paste.\n \
    \      This is the option chosen for standardisation.\n"
