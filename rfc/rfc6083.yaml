  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport\
    \ Layer\n   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in [RFC4347], over the Stream\n\
    \   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC4960].\n   DTLS over\
    \ SCTP provides communications privacy for applications that\n   use SCTP as their\
    \ transport protocol and allows client/server\n   applications to communicate\
    \ in a way that is designed to prevent\n   eavesdropping and detect tampering\
    \ or message forgery.\n   Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all\
    \ transport\n   features provided by SCTP and its extensions.\n   TLS, from which\
    \ DTLS was derived, is designed to run on top of a\n   byte-stream-oriented transport\
    \ protocol providing a reliable, in-\n   sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is currently\
    \ mainly being used on top\n   of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as\
    \ defined in [RFC0793].\n   TLS over SCTP as described in [RFC3436] has some serious\
    \ limitations:\n   o  It does not support the unordered delivery of SCTP user\
    \ messages.\n   o  It does not support partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758].\n\
    \   o  It only supports the usage of the same number of streams in both\n    \
    \  directions.\n   o  It uses a TLS connection for every bidirectional stream,\
    \ which\n      requires a substantial amount of resources and message exchanges\n\
    \      if a large number of streams is used.\n   DTLS over SCTP as described in\
    \ this document overcomes these\n   limitations of TLS over SCTP.  In particular,\
    \ DTLS/SCTP supports:\n   o  preservation of message boundaries.\n   o  a large\
    \ number of unidirectional and bidirectional streams.\n   o  ordered and unordered\
    \ delivery of SCTP user messages.\n   o  the partial reliability extension as\
    \ defined in [RFC3758].\n   o  the dynamic address reconfiguration extension as\
    \ defined in\n      [RFC5061].\n   However, the following limitations still apply:\n\
    \   o  The maximum user message size is 2^14 bytes, which is the DTLS\n      limit.\n\
    \   o  The DTLS user cannot perform the SCTP-AUTH key management because\n   \
    \   this is done by the DTLS layer.\n   The method described in this document\
    \ requires that the SCTP\n   implementation supports the optional feature of fragmentation\
    \ of SCTP\n   user messages as defined in [RFC4960] and the SCTP authentication\n\
    \   extension defined in [RFC4895].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Version of DTLS
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Version of DTLS\n   This document is based on [RFC4347], and it is expected\
    \ that DTLS/\n   SCTP as described in this document will work with future versions\
    \ of\n   DTLS.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Message Sizes
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message Sizes\n   DTLS limits the DTLS user message size to the current\
    \ Path MTU minus\n   the header sizes.  For the purposes of running over SCTP,\
    \ the DTLS\n   path MTU MUST be considered to be 2^14.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Replay Detection
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Replay Detection\n   The replay detection of DTLS may result in the DTLS\
    \ layer dropping\n   messages.  Since DTLS/SCTP provides a reliable service if\
    \ requested\n   by the application, replay detection cannot be used.  Therefore,\n\
    \   replay detection of DTLS MUST NOT be used.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Path MTU Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Path MTU Discovery\n   SCTP provides Path MTU discovery and fragmentation/reassembly\
    \ for\n   user messages.  According to Section 3.2, DTLS can send maximum sized\n\
    \   messages.  Therefore, Path MTU discovery of DTLS MUST NOT be used.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Retransmission of Messages
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Retransmission of Messages\n   SCTP provides a reliable and in-sequence\
    \ transport service for DTLS\n   messages that require it.  See Section 4.4. \
    \ Therefore, DTLS\n   procedures for retransmissions MUST NOT be used.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Mapping of DTLS Records
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Mapping of DTLS Records\n   The supported maximum length of SCTP user messages\
    \ MUST be at least\n   2^14 + 2048 + 13 = 18445 bytes (2^14 + 2048 is the maximum\
    \ length of\n   the DTLSCiphertext.fragment, and 13 is the size of the DTLS record\n\
    \   header).  In particular, the SCTP implementation MUST support\n   fragmentation\
    \ of user messages.\n   Every SCTP user message MUST consist of exactly one DTLS\
    \ record.\n"
- title: 4.2.  DTLS Connection Handling
  contents:
  - "4.2.  DTLS Connection Handling\n   Each DTLS connection MUST be established and\
    \ terminated within the\n   same SCTP association.  A DTLS connection MUST NOT\
    \ span multiple SCTP\n   associations.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Payload Protocol Identifier Usage
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Payload Protocol Identifier Usage\n   Application protocols using DTLS\
    \ over SCTP SHOULD register and use a\n   separate payload protocol identifier\
    \ (PPID) and SHOULD NOT reuse the\n   PPID that they registered for running directly\
    \ over SCTP.\n   Using the same PPID does not harm as long as the application\
    \ can\n   determine whether or not DTLS is used.  However, for protocol\n   analyzers,\
    \ for example, it is much easier if a separate PPID is used.\n   This means, in\
    \ particular, that there is no specific PPID for DTLS.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Stream Usage
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Stream Usage\n   All DTLS messages of the ChangeCipherSpec, Alert, or Handshake\n\
    \   protocol MUST be transported on stream 0 with unlimited reliability\n   and\
    \ with the ordered delivery feature.\n   DTLS messages of the ApplicationData\
    \ protocol SHOULD use multiple\n   streams other than stream 0; they MAY use stream\
    \ 0 for everything if\n   they do not care about minimizing head of line blocking.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Chunk Handling
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Chunk Handling\n   DATA chunks of SCTP MUST be sent in an authenticated\
    \ way as described\n   in [RFC4895].  Other chunks MAY be sent in an authenticated\
    \ way.\n   This makes sure that an attacker cannot modify the stream in which\
    \ a\n   message is sent or affect the ordered/unordered delivery of the\n   message.\n\
    \   If PR-SCTP as defined in [RFC3758] is used, FORWARD-TSN chunks MUST\n   also\
    \ be sent in an authenticated way as described in [RFC4895].  This\n   makes sure\
    \ that it is not possible for an attacker to drop messages\n   and use forged\
    \ FORWARD-TSN, SACK, and/or SHUTDOWN chunks to hide this\n   dropping.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Renegotiation
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Renegotiation\n   DTLS supports renegotiation, and therefore this feature\
    \ is also\n   available by DTLS/SCTP.  It is up to the upper layer to use/allow\
    \ it\n   or not.  Application writers should be aware that allowing\n   renegotiations\
    \ may result in changes of security parameters.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Handshake
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Handshake\n   A DTLS implementation discards DTLS messages from older epochs\
    \ after\n   some time, as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4347].  This is not\n\
    \   acceptable when the DTLS user performs a reliable data transfer.  To\n   avoid\
    \ discarding messages, the following procedures are required.\n   Before sending\
    \ a ChangeCipherSpec message, all outstanding SCTP user\n   messages MUST have\
    \ been acknowledged by the SCTP peer and MUST NOT be\n   revoked by the SCTP peer.\n\
    \   Prior to processing a received ChangeCipherSpec, all other received\n   SCTP\
    \ user messages that are buffered in the SCTP layer MUST be read\n   and processed\
    \ by DTLS.\n   User messages that arrive between ChangeCipherSpec and Finished\n\
    \   messages and use the new epoch have probably passed the Finished\n   message\
    \ and MUST be buffered by DTLS until the Finished message is\n   read.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Handling of Endpoint-Pair Shared Secrets
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Handling of Endpoint-Pair Shared Secrets\n   The endpoint-pair shared secret\
    \ for Shared Key Identifier 0 is empty\n   and MUST be used when establishing\
    \ a DTLS connection.  Whenever the\n   master key changes, a 64-byte shared secret\
    \ is derived from every\n   master secret and provided as a new endpoint-pair\
    \ shared secret by\n   using the exporter described in [RFC5705].  The exporter\
    \ MUST use the\n   label given in Section 5 and no context.  The new Shared Key\n\
    \   Identifier MUST be the old Shared Key Identifier incremented by 1.\n   If\
    \ the old one is 65535, the new one MUST be 1.\n   Before sending the Finished\
    \ message, the active SCTP-AUTH key MUST be\n   switched to the new one.\n   Once\
    \ the corresponding Finished message from the peer has been\n   received, the\
    \ old SCTP-AUTH key SHOULD be removed.\n"
- title: 4.9.  Shutdown
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Shutdown\n   To prevent DTLS from discarding DTLS user messages while it\
    \ is\n   shutting down, a CloseNotify message MUST only be sent after all\n  \
    \ outstanding SCTP user messages have been acknowledged by the SCTP\n   peer and\
    \ MUST NOT still be revoked by the SCTP peer.\n   Prior to processing a received\
    \ CloseNotify, all other received SCTP\n   user messages that are buffered in\
    \ the SCTP layer MUST be read and\n   processed by DTLS.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA added a value to the TLS Exporter Label registry\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC5705].  The label is \"EXPORTER_DTLS_OVER_SCTP\".\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations given in [RFC4347],\
    \ [RFC4895], and\n   [RFC4960] also apply to this document.\n   It is possible\
    \ to authenticate DTLS endpoints based on IP addresses\n   in certificates.  SCTP\
    \ associations can use multiple addresses per\n   SCTP endpoint.  Therefore, it\
    \ is possible that DTLS records will be\n   sent from a different IP address than\
    \ that originally authenticated.\n   This is not a problem provided that no security\
    \ decisions are made\n   based on that IP address.  This is a special case of\
    \ a general rule:\n   all decisions should be based on the peer's authenticated\
    \ identity,\n   not on its transport layer identity.\n   For each message, the\
    \ SCTP user also provides a stream identifier, a\n   flag to indicate whether\
    \ the message is sent ordered or unordered,\n   and a payload protocol identifier.\
    \  Although DTLS can be used to\n   provide privacy for the actual user message,\
    \ none of these three are\n   protected by DTLS.  They are sent as clear text,\
    \ because they are\n   part of the SCTP DATA chunk header.\n   DTLS supports cipher\
    \ suites that contain a NULL cipher algorithm.\n   Negotiating a NULL cipher algorithm\
    \ will not provide communications\n   privacy for applications and will not provide\
    \ privacy for user\n   messages.\n"
