- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Although electronic mail is preferable as a means of third-party\n\
    \   communication, in some cases it may be necessary to print\n   information,\
    \ in hard-copy form, at a remote location.  The remote\n   output device may consist\
    \ of a standard line printer, a printer with\n   multiple fonts and faces, a printer\
    \ that can reproduce graphics, or a\n   facsimile device.  Remote output may be\
    \ accompanied by information\n   that identifies the intended recipient.  This\
    \ memo describes a\n   technique for \"remote printing\" using the Internet mail\n\
    \   infrastructure.  In particular, this memo focuses on the case in\n   which\
    \ remote printers are connected to the international telephone\n   network.\n"
- title: 2. Naming, Addressing, and Routing
  contents:
  - "2. Naming, Addressing, and Routing\n   A printer is identified by a telephone\
    \ number which corresponds to a\n   G3-facsimile device connected to the international\
    \ telephone network,\n   e.g.,\n      +1 415 968 2510\n   where \"+1\" indicates\
    \ the IDDD country code, and the remaining string\n   is a telephone number within\
    \ that country.\n"
- title: 2.1 Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.1 Addressing\n   This number is used to construct the address of a remote printer\n\
    \   server, which forms the recipient address for the message, e.g.,\n   either\n\
    \      remote-printer@0.1.5.2.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n      or\n      remote-printer.ATOM@0.1.5.2.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \   where \"ATOM\" is an (optional) RFC 822 atom [1], an opaque string for\n \
    \  use in recipient identification when generating a cover-sheet, and\n   the\
    \ domain-part is constructed by reversing the telephone number,\n   converting\
    \ each digit to a domain-label, and being placed under\n   \"tpc.int.\"\n   Note\
    \ that the mailbox syntax is purposefully restricted in the\n   interests of pragmatism.\
    \  To paraphrase RFC 822, an atom is defined\n   as:\n      atom    = 1*atomchar\n\
    \      atomchar=  <any upper or lowercase alphabetic character\n             \
    \    (A-Z a-z)>\n                / <any digit (0-9)>\n                / \"!\"\
    \ / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\" / \"+\"\n                / \"\
    -\" / \"/\" / \"=\" / \"?\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"{\"\n                /\
    \ \"|\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n   Finally, note that some Internet mail software (especially\
    \ gateways\n   from outside the Internet) impose stringent limitations on the\
    \ size\n   of a mailbox-string.  Thus, originating user agents should take care\n\
    \   in limiting the local-part to no more than 70 or so characters.\n"
- title: 2.2 Routing
  contents:
  - "2.2 Routing\n   The message is routed in exactly the same fashion as all other\n\
    \   electronic mail, i.e., using the MX algorithm [2].  Since a remote\n   printer\
    \ server might be able to access many printers, the wildcarding\n   facilities\
    \ of the DNS [3,4] are used accordingly.  For example, if a\n   remote printer\
    \ server residing at \"dbc.mtview.ca.us\" was willing to\n   access any printer\
    \ with a telephone number prefix of\n      +1 415 968\n   then this resource record\
    \ might be present\n      *.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.    IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n\
    \   Naturally, if several remote printer servers were willing to access\n   any\
    \ printer in that prefix, multiple MX resource records would be\n   present.\n\
    \   It should be noted that the presence of a wildcard RR which matches a\n  \
    \ remote printer server's address does not imply that the corresponding\n   telephone\
    \ number is valid, or, if valid, that a G3-facsimile device\n   is connected at\
    \ the phone number.\n"
- title: 3. Procedure
  contents:
  - "3. Procedure\n   When information is to be remotely printed, the user application\n\
    \   constructs an RFC 822 message, containing a \"Message-ID\" field.\n   If the\
    \ local-part of the address does not contain an opaque string\n   for use in recipient\
    \ identification, then the body must consist\n   \"multipart/mixed\" content [5]\
    \ having at two parts, the first being a\n   \"application/remote-printing\" content-type\
    \ (defined in Appendix A),\n   which will be used to generate a cover-sheet, and\
    \ the second being an\n   arbitrary content-type corresponding to the information\
    \ to be\n   printed.  If the local-part of the address does contain an opaque\n\
    \   string for use in recipient identification, then the body consists of\n  \
    \ an arbitrary content-type corresponding to the information to be\n   printed.\n\
    \   Regardless, the message is then sent to the remote printer server's\n   electronic\
    \ mail address.\n"
- title: 3.1 Content-Types
  contents:
  - "3.1 Content-Types\n   It should be noted that not all content-types have a natural\
    \ printing\n   representation, e.g., an \"audio\" or \"video\" content.  For this\n\
    \   reason, the second part of the \"multipart/mixed\" content should be\n   one\
    \ of the following:\n   text/plain, message/rfc822, application/postscript image/tiff\n\
    \   (defined in Appendix B), any multipart.\n   Note that:\n      (1) With the\
    \ \"text/plain\" content-type, not all character\n          sets may be available\
    \ for printing.\n      (2) With the \"message\" content-type, the subordinate\
    \ content\n          will be processed recursively.\n      (3) With the \"application/postscript\"\
    \ content-type, the\n          remote printer server should evaluate the contents\
    \ in a\n          safe execution environment.\n      (4) With the \"multipart\"\
    \ content-type the subordinate contents\n          will be processed recursively:\
    \ for a \"multipart/mixed\" or\n          \"multipart/digest\" content, each subordinate\
    \ content will\n          start on a new page, whilst for a \"multipart/parallel\"\
    \ content,\n          all subordinate contents will, if possible, start on the\
    \ same\n          page.  Naturally, when processing a \"multipart/alternative\"\
    \n          content, only one subordinate content will be printed.\n"
- title: 3.2 Generating a Cover-Sheet
  contents:
  - "3.2 Generating a Cover-Sheet\n   If the \"application/remote-printing\" content-type\
    \ is present,\n   this contains all the information necessary to generate a\n\
    \   cover-sheet.  Otherwise, the cover-sheet must be generated\n   based on other\
    \ information available.\n   Typically, a cover sheet consists of three sections:\n\
    \      o information identifying the originator;\n      o information identifying\
    \ the recipient; and,\n      o additional information supplied by the remote printer\n\
    \        server.\n   To identify the originator, the remote printer server will\
    \ use the\n   message headers, usually by stripping any trace headers (i.e.,\n\
    \   \"Received\" and \"Return-Path\") and then re-ordering the remaining\n   headers\
    \ starting with the \"From\" header.\n   To identify the recipient, the opaque\
    \ string from the local- part of\n   the remote printer server's address is consulted.\
    \  For example, if\n   the remote printer server's address is\n   remote-printer.Arlington_Hewes/Room_403@0.1.5.2.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \   then the opaque string\n   Arlington_Hewes/Room_403\n   is consulted.  lp\
    \ When generating a cover-sheet using this opaque\n   string, the remote printer\
    \ server will interpret an underscore\n   character (\"_\") as a space, and a\
    \ solidus character (\"/\") as an end-\n   of-line sequence.  A remote printer\
    \ server will interpret two\n   consecutive underscore characters in the opaque\
    \ string as a single\n   underscore, and two consecutive solidus characters as\
    \ a single\n   solidus.  So, the opaque string,\n      Arlington_Hewes/Room_403\n\
    \      might appear on the cover-sheet as\n      To: Arlington Hewes\n      Room\
    \ 403\n"
- title: 3.3 Return Receipt
  contents:
  - "3.3 Return Receipt\n   When the remote printer server finishes its processing,\
    \ a message is\n   returned to the originator, indicating either success (i.e.,\
    \ the\n   message was successfully sent to the facsimile device), or failure,\n\
    \   with an explanation (e.g., after several repeated attempts, there was\n  \
    \ no answer).\n"
