  - "Abstract\n   Network mobility arises when a router connecting a network to the\n\
    \   Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the Internet\n   thereby\
    \ causing the reachability of the said network to be changed in\n   relation to\
    \ the fixed Internet topology.  Such a type of network is\n   referred to as a\
    \ mobile network.  With appropriate mechanisms,\n   sessions established between\
    \ nodes in the mobile network and the\n   global Internet can be maintained after\
    \ the mobile router changes its\n   point of attachment.  This document outlines\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network mobility support (see [1] for the related terminology)\
    \ is\n   concerned with managing the mobility of an entire network, viewed as\n\
    \   a single unit that changes its point of attachment to the Internet\n   and\
    \ thus its reachability in the Internet topology.  Such a network\n   is referred\
    \ to as a mobile network and includes one or more mobile\n   routers (MRs), which\
    \ connect it to the global Internet.  Nodes behind\n   the MR(s) (MNNs) are both\
    \ fixed (LFNs) and mobile (VMNs or LMNs).  In\n   most cases, the internal structure\
    \ of the mobile network will be\n   relatively stable (no dynamic change of the\
    \ topology), but this is\n   not always true.\n   Cases of mobile networks include,\
    \ for instance:\n   o  Networks attached to people (Personal Area Networks or\
    \ PANs): a\n      cell phone with one cellular interface and one Bluetooth interface\n\
    \      together with a Bluetooth-enabled PDA constitute a very simple\n      instance\
    \ of a mobile network.  The cell phone is the mobile router\n      while the PDA\
    \ is used for web browsing or runs a personal web\n      server.\n   o  Networks\
    \ of sensors and computers deployed in vehicles: vehicles\n      are increasingly\
    \ equipped with a number of processing units for\n      safety and ease of driving\
    \ reasons, as advocated by ITS\n      (Intelligent Transportation Systems) applications\
    \ ([4]).\n   o  Access networks deployed in public transportation (buses, trains,\n\
    \      taxis, aircrafts): they provide Internet access to IP devices\n      carried\
    \ by passengers (laptop, camera, mobile phone); host\n      mobility within network\
    \ mobility or PANs; network mobility within\n      network mobility, i.e., nested\
    \ mobility (see [1] for the\n      definition of nested mobility).\n   o  Ad-hoc\
    \ networks connected to the Internet via an MR: for instance,\n      students\
    \ in a train who need to both set up an ad-hoc network\n      among themselves\
    \ and get Internet connectivity through the MR\n      connecting the train to\
    \ the Internet.\n   Mobility of networks does not cause MNNs to change their own\
    \ physical\n   point of attachment; however, they do change their topological\n\
    \   location with respect to the global Internet.  If network mobility is\n  \
    \ not explicitly supported by some mechanisms, the mobility of the MR\n   results\
    \ in MNNs losing Internet access and breaking ongoing sessions\n   between arbitrary\
    \ correspondent nodes (CNs) in the global Internet\n   and those MNNs located\
    \ within the mobile network.  In addition, the\n   communication path between\
    \ MNNs and correspondent nodes becomes sub-\n   optimal, and multiple levels of\
    \ mobility will cause extremely sub-\n   optimal routing.\n   Mobility-related\
    \ terms used in this document are defined in [2],\n   whereas terms specifically\
    \ pertaining to network mobility are defined\n   in [1].  This document is structured\
    \ as follows: in Section 2, we\n   define the rough objectives and methodology\
    \ of the NEMO working group\n   to handle network mobility issues and we emphasize\
    \ the stepwise\n   approach the working group has decided to follow.  A number\
    \ of\n   desirable design goals are listed in Section 3.  Those design goals\n\
    \   then serve as guidelines to define the requirements listed in Section\n  \
    \ 4 for basic network mobility support [3].\n"
- title: 2.  NEMO Working Group Objectives and Methodology
  contents:
  - "2.  NEMO Working Group Objectives and Methodology\n   The mechanisms required\
    \ for handling network mobility issues were\n   lacking within the IETF standards\
    \ when the NEMO working group (WG)\n   was set up at the IETF in 2002.  At that\
    \ time, work conducted on\n   mobility support (particularly in the Mobile IP\
    \ working group) was to\n   provide continuous Internet connectivity and optimal\
    \ routing to\n   mobile hosts only (host mobility support).  Such mechanisms specified\n\
    \   in Mobile IPv6 [5] are unable to support network mobility.  The NEMO\n   working\
    \ group has therefore been set up to deal with issues specific\n   to network\
    \ mobility.\n   The primary objective of the NEMO work is to specify a solution\
    \ that\n   allows mobile network nodes (MNNs) to remain connected to the\n   Internet\
    \ and continuously reachable while the mobile router serving\n   the mobile network\
    \ changes its point of attachment.  The secondary\n   goal of the work is to investigate\
    \ the effects of network mobility on\n   various aspects of Internet communication\
    \ such as routing protocol\n   changes, implications of real-time traffic and\
    \ fast handovers, and\n   optimizations.  This should support the primary goal\
    \ of reachability\n   for mobile network nodes.  Security is an important consideration\n\
    \   too, and efforts should be made to use existing security solutions if\n  \
    \ they are appropriate.  Although a well-designed solution may include\n   security\
    \ inherent in other protocols, mobile networks also introduce\n   new challenges.\n\
    \   To complete these tasks, the NEMO working group has decided to take a\n  \
    \ stepwise approach.  The steps in this approach include standardizing\n   a basic\
    \ solution to preserve session continuity (NEMO Basic Support,\n   see [3]) and\
    \ studying the possible approaches and issues with\n   providing more optimal\
    \ routing with potentially nested mobile\n   networks (NEMO Extended Support,\
    \ see [6] and [7] for a discussion on\n   routing optimization issues and [8]\
    \ for a discussion on multihoming\n   issues).  However, the working group is\
    \ not chartered to actually\n   standardize a solution for Extended Support at\
    \ this point in time.\n   If deemed necessary, the working group will be rechartered\
    \ based on\n   the conclusions of the discussions.\n   For NEMO Basic Support,\
    \ the working group assumes that none of the\n   nodes behind the MR is aware\
    \ of the network's mobility; thus, the\n   network's movement needs to be completely\
    \ transparent to the nodes\n   inside the mobile network.  This assumption accommodates\
    \ nodes inside\n   the network that are not generally aware of mobility.\n   The\
    \ efforts of the Mobile IP working group have resulted in the\n   Mobile IPv4\
    \ and Mobile IPv6 protocols, which have already solved the\n   issue of host mobility\
    \ support.  Since challenges to enabling mobile\n   networks are vastly reduced\
    \ by this work, basic network mobility\n   support has adopted the methods for\
    \ host mobility support used in\n   Mobile IP and has extended them in the simplest\
    \ way possible to\n   achieve its goals.  The Basic Support solution, now defined\
    \ in [3]\n   following the requirements stated in Section 4 of the present\n \
    \  document, is for each MR to have a Home Agent (HA), and use bi-\n   directional\
    \ tunneling between the MR and HA to preserve session\n   continuity while the\
    \ MR moves.  The MR acquires a Care-of Address\n   (CoA) at its attachment point\
    \ much like what is done for mobile hosts\n   (MHs), using Mobile IP.  This approach\
    \ allows nested mobile networks,\n   since each MR will appear to its attachment\
    \ point as a single node.\n"

  - "3.  NEMO Support Design Goals\n   This section details the fundamental design\
    \ goals the solutions will\n   intend to achieve.  Those design goals serve to\
    \ define the issues and\n   to impose a list of requirements for forthcoming solutions.\
    \  Actual\n   requirements for NEMO Basic Support are in Section 4; NEMO Extended\n\
    \   Support is not yet considered at the time of this writing.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Migration Transparency
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Migration Transparency\n   Permanent connectivity to the Internet has to\
    \ be provided to all\n   MNNs, since continuous sessions are expected to be maintained\
    \ as the\n   mobile router changes its point of attachment.  For maintaining those\n\
    \   sessions, MNNs are expected to be reachable via their permanent IP\n   addresses.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Performance Transparency and Seamless Mobility
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Performance Transparency and Seamless Mobility\n   NEMO support is expected\
    \ to be provided with limited signaling\n   overhead and to minimize the impact\
    \ of handovers on applications, in\n   terms of packet loss or delay.  However,\
    \ although variable delays of\n   transmission and losses between MNNs and their\
    \ respective CNs could\n   be perceived as the network is displaced, it would\
    \ not be considered\n   a lack of performance transparency.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Network Mobility Support Transparency
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Network Mobility Support Transparency\n   MNNs behind the MR(s) do not\
    \ change their own physical point of\n   attachment as a result of the mobile\
    \ network's displacement in the\n   Internet topology.  Consequently, NEMO support\
    \ is expected to be\n   performed only by the MR(s).  Specific support functions\
    \ on any node\n   other than the MR(s) would better be avoided.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Operational Transparency
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Operational Transparency\n   NEMO support is to be implemented at the level\
    \ of IP layer.  It is\n   expected to be transparent to upper layers so that any\
    \ upper-layer\n   protocol can run unchanged on top of an IP layer extended with\
    \ NEMO\n   support.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Arbitrary Configurations
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Arbitrary Configurations\n   The formation of a mobile network can occur\
    \ in various levels of\n   complexity.  In the simplest case, a mobile network\
    \ contains just a\n   mobile router and a host.  In the most complicated case,\
    \ a mobile\n   network is multihomed and is itself a multi-level aggregation of\n\
    \   mobile networks with collectively thousands of mobile routers and\n   hosts.\
    \  While the list of potential configurations of mobile networks\n   cannot be\
    \ limited, at least the following ones are desirable:\n   o  Mobile networks of\
    \ any size, ranging from a sole subnet with a few\n      IP devices to a collection\
    \ of subnets with a large number of IP\n      devices.\n   o  Nodes that change\
    \ their point of attachment within the mobile\n      network.\n   o  Foreign mobile\
    \ nodes that attach to the mobile network.\n   o  Multihomed mobile network: either\
    \ when a single MR has multiple\n      attachments to the internet, or when the\
    \ mobile network is\n      attached to the Internet by means of multiple MRs (see\
    \ definition\n      in [1] and the analysis in [8]).\n   o  Nested mobile networks\
    \ (mobile networks attaching to other mobile\n      networks (see definition in\
    \ [1]).  Although the complexity\n      requirements of these nested networks\
    \ are not clear, it is\n      desirable to support arbitrary levels of recursive\
    \ networks.  The\n      solution should only impose restrictions on nesting (e.g.,\
    \ path\n      MTU) when this is impractical and protocol concerns preclude such\n\
    \      support.\n   o  Distinct mobility frequencies (see mobility factor in [2]).\n\
    \   o  Distinct access media.\n   In order to keep complexity minimal, transit\
    \ networks are excluded\n   from this list.  A transit network is one in which\
    \ data would be\n   forwarded between two endpoints outside of the network, so\
    \ that the\n   network itself simply serves as a transitional conduit for packet\n\
    \   forwarding.  A stub network (leaf network), on the other hand, does\n   not\
    \ serve as a data forwarding path.  Data on a stub network is\n   either sent\
    \ by or addressed to a node located within that network.\n"

    \ and horizontal\n   handoffs, and access control mechanisms are desirable to\
    \ achieve this\n   goal.  Such mobility is not expected to be limited for any\n\
    \   consideration other than administrative and security policies.\n"

    \ Internet routing, as\n   well as the dynamic changes in the information that\
    \ is injected into\n   the global routing system.\n   As one example of why this\
    \ is necessary, consider the approach of\n   advertising each mobile network's\
    \ connectivity into BGP and, for\n   every movement, withdrawing old routes and\
    \ injecting new routes.  If\n   there were tens of thousands of mobile networks\
    \ each advertising and\n   withdrawing routes, for example, at the speed that\
    \ an airplane can\n   move from one ground station to another, the potential effect\

- title: 4.  NEMO Basic Support One-Liner Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  NEMO Basic Support One-Liner Requirements\n   For basic network mobility\
    \ support, the NEMO WG is to specify a\n   unified and unique \"Network Mobility\
    \ (NEMO) Basic Support\" solution,\n   hereafter referred to as \"the solution\"\
    .  This solution is to allow\n   all nodes in the mobile network to be reachable\
    \ via permanent IP\n   addresses, as well as maintain ongoing sessions as the\
    \ MR changes its\n   point of attachment to the Internet topology.  This is to\
    \ be done by\n   maintaining a bi-directional tunnel between an MR and its Home\
    \ Agent.\n   The NEMO Working Group, after some investigation of alternatives,\
    \ has\n   decided to reuse and extend the existing Mobile IPv6 [5] mechanisms\n\
    \   for tunnel management.\n   The list of requirements below has been imposed\
    \ on the NEMO Basic\n   Support solution.  The requirements have mostly been met\
    \ by the\n   resulting specification, which can now be found in [3].  Associated\n\
    \   deployment issues are discussed in [9].\n   R01: The solution must be implemented\
    \ at the IP layer level.\n   R02: The solution must set up a bi-directional tunnel\
    \ between a\n        mobile router and its Home Agent (MRHA tunnel).\n   R03:\
    \ All traffic exchanged between an MNN and a CN in the global\n        Internet\
    \ must transit through the bi-directional MRHA tunnel.\n   R04: MNNs must be reachable\
    \ at a permanent IP address and name.\n   R05: The solution must maintain continuous\
    \ sessions (both unicast and\n        multicast) between MNNs and arbitrary CNs\
    \ after IP handover of\n        (one of) the MRs.\n   R06: The solution must not\
    \ require modifications to any node other\n        than MRs and HAs.\n   R07:\
    \ The solution must support fixed nodes, mobile hosts, and mobile\n        routers\
    \ in the mobile network.\n   R08: The solution must allow MIPv6-enabled MNNs to\
    \ use a mobile\n        network link as either a home link or a foreign link.\n\
    \   R09: The solution must ensure backward compatibility with other\n        standards\
    \ defined by the IETF.  In particular, this includes the\n        following:\n\
    \        R09.1: The solution must not prevent the proper operation of\n      \
    \         Mobile IPv6 (i.e., the solution must allow MIPv6-enabled\n         \
    \      MNNs to operate either the CN, HA, or MN operations\n               defined\
    \ in [5]).\n   R10: The solution must be agnostic to the internal configuration.\n\
    \        This means the solution will behave the same way if NEMO is\n       \
    \ nested, comprises one or several subnets, or comprises MNNs that\n        are\
    \ LFNs, VMNs, LFNs or a mixture of them.\n   R11: The solution must support at\
    \ least 2 levels of nested mobile\n        networks, while, in principle, arbitrary\
    \ levels of recursive\n        mobile networks should be supported.\n   R12: The\
    \ solution must function for multihomed MRs and multihomed\n        mobile networks\
    \ as defined in [1].\n   R13: NEMO support signaling over the bi-directional must\
    \ be\n        minimized.\n   R14: Signaling messages between the HA and the MR\
    \ must be secured:\n        R14.1: The receiver must be able to authenticate the\
    \ sender.\n        R14.2: The function performed by the sender must be authorized\n\
    \               for the content carried.\n        R14.3: Anti-replay must be provided.\n\
