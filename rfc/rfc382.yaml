    \ SOFTWARE ON THE ARPA NETWORK\nThere have been several efforts in the past few\
    \ years to develop high\nquality libraries of mathematical and statistical subroutines.\
    \  Some\nof the projects mentioned in the literature include:\n1.  The Bell Laboratories\
    \ numerical mathematics program library project.\n2.  IMSL Inc.:  IMSL Library\
    \ I, mathematical-statistical computer\n    subroutines\n3.  The NATS (National\
    \ Science Foundation,Argonne Laboratories, Stanford\n    and Texas) joint project\
    \ on the Wilkinson linear algebra routines.\nThe ARPA Network could further enhance\
    \ the desirability of such libraries\nas they would become another sharable network\
    \ resource.  Although the\ndiversity of network computing no doubt requires an\
    \ equally diverse set\nof mathematical software, and in spite of the fact everyone\
    \ has their\nown software hangups - not to mention hardware!, it seems everyone\n\
    could benefit from some type of information interchange regarding mathe-\nmatical\
    \ software of interest.\nIn particular I would welcome any information on your\
    \ experiences with\nmathematical and statistical libraries, especially regarding\
    \ those\nmentioned above.\nWe do plan on obtaining the NATS library and with the\
    \ project's cooperation,\nintend to make it available on several Network IBM/360-370's\
    \ and PDP-10's.\nThose interested should send me a message via NIC (ident LM)\
    \ or get in\ntouch with me at (217) 333-8497.\n       [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by\
