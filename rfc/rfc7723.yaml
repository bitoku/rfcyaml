  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) [RFC6887] provides a mechanism
    to\n   control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such\n   as
    Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4\n   Servers
    (NAT64), Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4\n   (NAT44), and IPv6 and
    IPv4 firewall devices.  Furthermore, it\n   provides a mechanism to reduce application
    keepalive traffic\n   [PCP-OPTIMIZE].  The PCP base protocol document [RFC6887]
    specifies\n   the message formats used, but the address to which a client sends
    its\n   request is either assumed to be the default router (which is\n   appropriate
    in a typical single-link residential network) or has to\n   be configured otherwise
    via some external mechanism, such as a\n   configuration file or a DHCP option
    [RFC7291].\n   This document follows a different approach: it establishes two
    well-\n   known anycast addresses for the PCP server, one IPv4 address and one\n
    \  IPv6 address.  PCP clients usually send PCP requests to these well-\n   known
    addresses if no other PCP server addresses are known or after\n   communication
    attempts to such other addresses have failed.  The\n   anycast addresses are allocated
    from pools of special-purpose IP\n   addresses (see Section 4), in accordance
    with Section 3.4 of\n   [RFC4085].  Yet, a means to disable or override these
    well-known\n   addresses (e.g., a configuration file option) should be available
    in\n   implementations.\n   Using an anycast address is particularly useful in
    larger network\n   topologies.  For example, if the PCP-enabled NAT/firewall function
    is\n   not located on the client's default gateway but further upstream in a\n
    \  Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), sending PCP requests to the default\n   gateway's
    IP address will not have the desired effect.  When using a\n   configuration file
    or the DHCP option to learn the PCP server's IP\n   address, this file or the
    DHCP server configuration must reflect the\n   network topology and the router
    and CGN configuration.  This may be\n   cumbersome to achieve and maintain.  If
    there is more than one\n   upstream CGN and traffic is routed using a dynamic
    routing protocol\n   such as OSPF, this approach may not be feasible at all, as
    it cannot\n   provide timely information regarding which CGN to interact with.
    \ In\n   contrast, when using the PCP anycast address, the PCP request will\n
    \  travel through the network like any other packet (i.e., without any\n   special
    support from DNS, DHCP, other routers, or anything else)\n   until it reaches
    the PCP-capable device that receives it, handles it,\n   and sends back a reply.
    \ A further advantage of using an anycast\n   address instead of a DHCP option
    is that the anycast address can be\n   hard-coded into the application.  There
    is no need for an application\n   programming interface that passes the PCP server's
    address from the\n   operating system's DHCP client to the application.  For further\n
    \  discussion of deployment considerations, see Section 3.\n"

    - "2.1.  PCP Discovery Client Behavior\n   PCP clients can add the PCP anycast
      addresses, which are defined in\n   Sections 4.1 and 4.2, after the default
      router list (for IPv4 and\n   IPv6) to the list of PCP server(s) (see step 2
      in Section 8.1 of\n   [RFC6887]).  This list is processed as specified in [RFC7488].\n
      \  Note: If, in some specific scenario, it was desirable to use only the\n   anycast
      address (and not the default router), this could be achieved\n   by putting
      the anycast address into the configuration file or DHCP\n   option.\n"

    - "2.2.  PCP Discovery Server Behavior\n   PCP servers can be configured to listen
      on the anycast addresses for\n   incoming PCP requests.  When a PCP server receives
      a PCP request\n   destined for an anycast address it supports, it sends the\n
      \  corresponding PCP replies using that same anycast address as the\n   source
      address (see the \"How UDP and TCP Use Anycasting\" section of\n   [RFC1546]
      for further discussion).\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Deployment Considerations\n   For general recommendations regarding operation
    of anycast services,\n   see [RFC4786].  Architectural considerations of IP anycast
    are\n   discussed in [RFC7094].\n   In some deployment scenarios, using PCP anycasting
    may have certain\n   limitations that can be overcome by using additional mechanisms
    or by\n   using other PCP server discovery methods instead, such as DHCP\n   [RFC7291]
    or a configuration file.\n   One important example is a network topology in which
    a network is\n   connected to one or more upstream network(s) via several parallel\n
    \  firewalls, each individually controlled by its own PCP server.  Even\n   if
    all of these PCP servers are configured for anycasting, only one\n   will receive
    the messages sent by a given client, depending on the\n   state of the routing
    tables.\n   As long as routing is always symmetric, i.e., all upstream and\n   downstream
    packets from/to that client are routed through this very\n   same firewall, communication
    will be possible as expected.  If there\n   is a routing change, a PCP client
    using PCP anycasting might start\n   interacting with a different PCP server.
    \ From the PCP client's point\n   of view, this would be the same as a PCP server
    reboot and the client\n   could detect it by examining the Epoch field during
    the next PCP\n   response or ANNOUNCE message.  The client would re-establish
    the\n   firewall rules and packet flows could resume.\n   If, however, routing
    is asymmetric, upstream packets from a client\n   traverse a different firewall
    than the downstream packets to that\n   client.  Establishing policy rules in
    only one of these two firewalls\n   by means of PCP anycasting will not have the
    desired result of\n   allowing bidirectional connectivity.  One solution approach
    to\n   overcome this problem is an implementation-specific mechanism to\n   synchronize
    state between all firewalls at the border of a network,\n   i.e., a PEER message
    sent to any of these PCP servers would establish\n   rules in all firewalls.  Another
    approach would be to use a different\n   discovery mechanism (e.g., DHCP or a
    configuration file) that allows\n   a PCP client to acquire a list of all PCP
    servers controlling the\n   parallel firewalls and configure each of them individually.\n
    \  PCP anycast as such allows a PCP client to communicate only with its\n   closest
    upstream PCP server.  However, it may be used in conjunction\n   with the PCP
    proxy function [RFC7648], in order to support scenarios\n   with cascaded PCP-enabled
    NATs or firewalls.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security considerations in
    [RFC6887], [RFC4786],\n   and [RFC7094], two further security issues are considered
    here.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Information Leakage through Anycast\n   In a network without any border
      gateway, NAT, or firewall that is\n   aware of the PCP anycast address, outgoing
      PCP requests could leak\n   out onto the external Internet, possibly revealing
      information about\n   internal devices.\n   Using an IANA-assigned, well-known
      PCP anycast address enables border\n   gateways to block such outgoing packets.
      \ In the default-free zone,\n   routers should be configured to drop such packets.
      \ Such\n   configuration can occur naturally via BGP messages advertising that\n
      \  no route exists to said address.\n   Sensitive clients that do not wish to
      leak information about their\n   presence can set an IP TTL on their PCP requests
      that limits how far\n   they can travel towards the public Internet.  However,
      methods for\n   choosing an appropriate TTL value, e.g., based on the assumed
      radius\n   of the trusted network domain, is beyond the scope of this document.\n
      \  Before sending PCP requests with possibly privacy-sensitive\n   parameters
      (e.g., IP addresses and port numbers) to the PCP anycast\n   addresses, PCP
      clients can send an ANNOUNCE request (without\n   parameters; see Section 14.1
      of [RFC6887]) in order to probe whether\n   a PCP server consumes and processes
      PCP requests sent to that anycast\n   address.\n"
    title: 5.1.  Information Leakage through Anycast
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Hijacking of PCP Messages Sent to Anycast Addresses\n   The anycast addresses
      are treated by normal host operating systems as\n   normal unicast addresses,
      i.e., packets destined for an anycast\n   address are sent to the default router
      for processing and forwarding.\n   Hijacking such packets in the first network
      segment would effectively\n   require the attacker to impersonate the default
      router, e.g., by\n   means of ARP spoofing in an Ethernet network.  Once an
      anycast\n   message is forwarded closer to the core network, routing will likely\n
      \  become subject to dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or BGP.\n   Anycast
      messages could be hijacked by announcing counterfeited\n   messages in these
      routing protocols.  When analyzing the risk and\n   possible consequences of
      such attacks in a given network scenario,\n   the probable impacts on PCP signaling
      need to be put into proportion\n   with probable impacts on other protocols
      such as the actual\n   application protocols.\n   In addition to following best
      current practices in first-hop security\n   and routing-protocol security, PCP
      authentication [RFC7652] may be\n   useful in some scenarios.  However, the
      effort needed for a proper\n   setup of this authentication mechanism (e.g.,
      installing the right\n   shared secrets or cryptographic keys on all involved
      systems) may\n   thwart the goal of fully automatic configuration by using PCP\n
      \  anycast.  Therefore, this approach may be less suitable for scenarios\n   with
      high trust between the operator of the PCP-controlled middlebox\n   and all
      users (e.g., a residential gateway used only by family\n   members) or in scenarios
      in which there is rather limited trust that\n   the middlebox will behave correctly
      (e.g., the Wi-Fi in an airport\n   lounge).  In contrast, this scheme may be
      highly useful in scenarios\n   with many users and a trusted network operator,
      such as a large\n   corporate network or a university campus network, which
      uses several\n   parallel NATs or firewalls to connect to the Internet.  Therefore,
      a\n   thorough analysis of the benefits and costs of using PCP\n   authentication
      in a given network scenario is recommended.\n"
