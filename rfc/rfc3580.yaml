  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE 802.1X enables authenticated access to IEEE 802 media,\
    \ including\n   Ethernet, Token Ring, and 802.11 wireless LANs.  Although Remote\n\
    \   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) support is optional\n   within\
    \ IEEE 802.1X, it is expected that many IEEE 802.1X\n   Authenticators will function\
    \ as RADIUS clients.\n   IEEE 802.1X [IEEE8021X] provides \"network port authentication\"\
    \ for\n   IEEE 802 [IEEE802] media, including Ethernet [IEEE8023], Token Ring\n\
    \   and 802.11 [IEEE80211] wireless LANS.\n   IEEE 802.1X does not require use\
    \ of a backend Authentication Server,\n   and thus can be deployed with stand-alone\
    \ bridges or Access Points,\n   as well as in centrally managed scenarios.\n \
    \  In situations where it is desirable to centrally manage\n   authentication,\
    \ authorization and accounting (AAA) for IEEE 802\n   networks, deployment of\
    \ a backend authentication and accounting\n   server is desirable.  In such situations,\
    \ it is expected that IEEE\n   802.1X Authenticators will function as AAA clients.\n\
    \   This document provides suggestions on RADIUS usage by IEEE 802.1X\n   Authenticators.\
    \  Support for any AAA protocol is optional for IEEE\n   802.1X Authenticators,\
    \ and therefore this specification has been\n   incorporated into a non-normative\
    \ Appendix within the IEEE 802.1X\n   specification.\n"

  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   Access Point\
    \ (AP)\n         A Station that provides access to the distribution services via\n\
    \         the wireless medium for associated Stations.\n   Association\n     \
    \    The service used to establish Access Point/Station mapping and\n        \
    \ enable Station invocation of the distribution system services.\n   Authenticator\n\
    \         An Authenticator is an entity that requires authentication from\n  \
    \       the Supplicant.  The Authenticator may be connected to the\n         Supplicant\
    \ at the other end of a point-to-point LAN segment or\n         802.11 wireless\
    \ link.\n   Authentication Server\n         An Authentication Server is an entity\
    \ that provides an\n         Authentication Service to an Authenticator.  This\
    \ service\n         verifies, from the credentials provided by the Supplicant,\
    \ the\n         claim of identity made by the Supplicant.\n   Port Access Entity\
    \ (PAE)\n         The protocol entity associated with a physical or virtual\n\
    \         (802.11) Port.  A given PAE may support the protocol\n         functionality\
    \ associated with the Authenticator, Supplicant or\n         both.\n   Station\
    \ (STA)\n         Any device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant medium\n\
    \         access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the\n   \
    \      wireless medium (WM).\n   Supplicant\n         A Supplicant is an entity\
    \ that is being authenticated by an\n         Authenticator.  The Supplicant may\
    \ be connected to the\n         Authenticator at one end of a point-to-point LAN\
    \ segment or\n         802.11 wireless link.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Acct-Terminate-Cause\n   This attribute indicates how the session was terminated,\
    \ as described\n   in [RFC2866].  [IEEE8021X] defines the following termination\
    \ cause\n   values, which are shown with their RADIUS equivalents in the table\

    \   notTerminatedYet(999)             N/A\n   When using this attribute, the User\
    \ Request (1) termination cause\n   corresponds to the situation in which the\
    \ session terminated due to\n   an EAPOL-Logoff received from the Supplicant.\
    \  When a session is\n   moved due to roaming, the EAPOL state machines will treat\
    \ this as a\n   Supplicant Logoff.\n   A Lost Carrier (2) termination cause indicates\
    \ session termination\n   due to loss of physical connectivity for reasons other\
    \ than roaming\n   between Access Points.  For example, if the Supplicant disconnects\
    \ a\n   point-to-point LAN connection, or moves out of range of an Access\n  \
    \ Point, this termination cause is used.  Lost Carrier (2) therefore\n   equates\
    \ to a Port Disabled condition in the EAPOL state machines.\n   A Supplicant Restart\
    \ (19) termination cause indicates\n   re-initialization of the Supplicant state\
    \ machines.\n   A Reauthentication Failure (20) termination cause indicates that\
    \ a\n   previously authenticated Supplicant has failed to re-authenticate\n  \
    \ successfully following expiry of the re-authentication timer or\n   explicit\
    \ re-authentication request by management action.\n   Within [IEEE80211], periodic\
    \ re-authentication may be useful in\n   preventing reuse of an initialization\
    \ vector with a given key.  Since\n   successful re-authentication does not result\
    \ in termination of the\n   session, accounting packets are not sent as a result\
    \ of\n   re-authentication unless the status of the session changes.  For\n  \
    \ example:\n   a. The session is terminated due to re-authentication failure.\
    \  In\n      this case the Reauthentication Failure (20) termination cause is\n\
    \      used.\n   b. The authorizations are changed as a result of a successful\n\
    \      re-authentication.  In this case, the Service Unavailable (15)\n      termination\
    \ cause is used.  For accounting purposes, the portion\n      of the session after\
    \ the authorization change is treated as a\n      separate session.\n   Where\
    \ IEEE 802.1X authentication occurs prior to association,\n   accounting packets\
    \ are not sent until an association occurs.\n   An Admin Reset (6) termination\
    \ cause indicates that the Port has been\n   administratively forced into the\
    \ unauthorized state.\n   A Port Reinitialized (21) termination cause indicates\
    \ that the Port's\n   MAC has been reinitialized.\n   A Port Administratively\
    \ Disabled (22) termination cause indicates\n   that the Port has been administratively\
    \ disabled.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Acct-Multi-Session-Id
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Acct-Multi-Session-Id\n   The purpose of this attribute is to make it possible\
    \ to link together\n   multiple related sessions.  While [IEEE8021X] does not\
    \ act on\n   aggregated ports, it is possible for a Supplicant roaming between\n\
    \   Access Points to cause multiple RADIUS accounting packets to be sent\n   by\
    \ different Access Points.\n   Where supported by the Access Points, the Acct-Multi-Session-Id\n\
    \   attribute can be used to link together the multiple related sessions\n   of\
    \ a roaming Supplicant.  In such a situation, if the session context\n   is transferred\
    \ between Access Points, accounting packets MAY be sent\n   without a corresponding\
    \ authentication and authorization exchange,\n   provided that Association has\
    \ occurred.  However, in such a situation\n   it is assumed that the Acct-Multi-Session-Id\
    \ is transferred between\n   the Access Points as part of the Inter-Access Point\
    \ Protocol (IAPP).\n   If the Acct-Multi-Session-Id were not unique between Access\
    \ Points,\n   then it is possible that the chosen Acct-Multi-Session-Id will\n\
    \   overlap with an existing value allocated on that Access Point, and\n   the\
    \ Accounting Server would therefore be unable to distinguish a\n   roaming session\
    \ from a multi-link session.\n   As a result, the Acct-Multi-Session-Id attribute\
    \ is unique among all\n   the bridges or Access Points, Supplicants and sessions.\
    \  In order to\n   provide this uniqueness, it is suggested that the Acct-Multi-\n\
    \   Session-Id be of the form:\n   Original AP MAC Address | Supplicant MAC Address\
    \ | NTP Timestamp\n   Here \"|\" represents concatenation, the original AP MAC\
    \ Address is the\n   MAC address of the bridge or Access Point at which the session\n\
    \   started, and the 64-bit NTP timestamp indicates the beginning of the\n   original\
    \ session.  In order to provide for consistency of the Acct-\n   Multi-Session-Id\
    \ between roaming sessions, the Acct-Multi-Session-Id\n   may be moved between\
    \ Access Points as part of IAPP or another handoff\n   scheme.\n   The use of\
    \ an Acct-Multi-Session-Id of this form guarantees\n   uniqueness among all Access\
    \ Points, Supplicants and sessions.  Since\n   the NTP timestamp does not wrap\
    \ on reboot, there is no possibility\n   that a rebooted Access Point could choose\
    \ an Acct-Multi-Session-Id\n   that could be confused with that of a previous\
    \ session.\n   Since the Acct-Multi-Session-Id is of type String as defined in\n\
    \   [RFC2866], for use with IEEE 802.1X, it is encoded as an ASCII string\n  \
    \ of Hex digits.  Example:  \"00-10-A4-23-19-C0-00-12-B2-\n   14-23-DE-AF-23-83-C0-76-B8-44-E8\"\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  User-Name\n   In IEEE 802.1X, the Supplicant typically provides its identity\
    \ via an\n   EAP-Response/Identity message.  Where available, the Supplicant\n\
    \   identity is included in the User-Name attribute, and included in the\n   RADIUS\
    \ Access-Request and Access-Reply messages as specified in\n   [RFC2865] and [RFC3579].\n\
    \   Alternatively, as discussed in [RFC3579] Section 2.1., the User-Name\n   attribute\

    \ contains the IPv4\n   address of the bridge or Access Point acting as an Authenticator,\
    \ and\n   the NAS-IPv6-Address contains the IPv6 address.  If the IEEE 802.1X\n\
    \   Authenticator has more than one interface, it may be desirable to use\n  \
    \ a loopback address for this purpose so that the Authenticator will\n   still\
    \ be reachable even if one of the interfaces were to fail.\n"
- title: 3.4.  NAS-Port
  contents:
  - "3.4.  NAS-Port\n   For use with IEEE 802.1X the NAS-Port will contain the port\
    \ number of\n   the bridge, if this is available.  While an Access Point does\
    \ not\n   have physical ports, a unique \"association ID\" is assigned to every\n\
    \   mobile Station upon a successful association exchange.  As a result,\n   for\
    \ an Access Point, if the association exchange has been completed\n   prior to\
    \ authentication, the NAS-Port attribute will contain the\n   association ID,\
    \ which is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  Where IEEE\n   802.1X authentication occurs\
    \ prior to association, a unique NAS-Port\n   value may not be available.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Service-Type
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Service-Type\n   For use with IEEE 802.1X, the Framed (2), Authenticate\
    \ Only (8), and\n   Call Check (10) values are most commonly used.\n   A Service-Type\
    \ of Framed indicates that appropriate 802 framing\n   should be used for the\
    \ connection.  A Service-Type of Authenticate\n   Only (8) indicates that no authorization\
    \ information needs to be\n   returned in the Access-Accept.  As described in\
    \ [RFC2865], a\n   Service-Type of Call Check is included in an Access-Request\
    \ packet to\n   request that the RADIUS server accept or reject the connection\n\

- title: 3.31.  Tunnel Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.31.  Tunnel Attributes\n   Reference [RFC2868] defines RADIUS tunnel attributes\
    \ used for\n   authentication and authorization, and [RFC2867] defines tunnel\n\
    \   attributes used for accounting.  Where the IEEE 802.1X Authenticator\n   supports\
    \ tunneling, a compulsory tunnel may be set up for the\n   Supplicant as a result\
    \ of the authentication.\n   In particular, it may be desirable to allow a port\
    \ to be placed into\n   a particular Virtual LAN (VLAN), defined in [IEEE8021Q],\
    \ based on the\n   result of the authentication.  This can be used, for example,\
    \ to\n   allow a wireless host to remain on the same VLAN as it moves within a\n\
    \   campus network.\n   The RADIUS server typically indicates the desired VLAN\
    \ by including\n   tunnel attributes within the Access-Accept.  However, the IEEE\
    \ 802.1X\n   Authenticator may also provide a hint as to the VLAN to be assigned\n\
    \   to the Supplicant by including Tunnel attributes within the Access-\n   Request.\n\
    \   For use in VLAN assignment, the following tunnel attributes are used:\n  \
    \ Tunnel-Type=VLAN (13)\n   Tunnel-Medium-Type=802\n   Tunnel-Private-Group-ID=VLANID\n\
    \   Note that the VLANID is 12-bits, taking a value between 1 and 4094,\n   inclusive.\
    \  Since the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID is of type String as\n   defined in [RFC2868],\
    \ for use with IEEE 802.1X, the VLANID integer\n   value is encoded as a string.\n\
    \   When Tunnel attributes are sent, it is necessary to fill in the Tag\n   field.\
    \  As noted in [RFC2868], section 3.1:\n      The Tag field is one octet in length\
    \ and is intended to provide a\n      means of grouping attributes in the same\
    \ packet which refer to the\n      same tunnel.  Valid values for this field are\
    \ 0x01 through 0x1F,\n      inclusive.  If the Tag field is unused, it MUST be\
    \ zero (0x00).\n   For use with Tunnel-Client-Endpoint, Tunnel-Server-Endpoint,\
    \ Tunnel-\n   Private-Group-ID, Tunnel-Assignment-ID, Tunnel-Client-Auth-ID or\n\
    \   Tunnel-Server-Auth-ID attributes (but not Tunnel-Type, Tunnel-\n   Medium-Type,\
    \ Tunnel-Password, or Tunnel-Preference), a tag field of\n   greater than 0x1F\
    \ is interpreted as the first octet of the following\n   field.\n   Unless alternative\
    \ tunnel types are provided, (e.g. for IEEE 802.1X\n   Authenticators that may\
    \ support tunneling but not VLANs), it is only\n   necessary for tunnel attributes\
    \ to specify a single tunnel.  As a\n   result, where it is only desired to specify\
    \ the VLANID, the tag field\n   SHOULD be set to zero (0x00) in all tunnel attributes.\
    \  Where\n   alternative tunnel types are to be provided, tag values between 0x01\n\
    \   and 0x1F SHOULD be chosen.\n"
- title: 4.  RC4 EAPOL-Key Frame
  contents:
  - "4.  RC4 EAPOL-Key Frame\n   The RC4 EAPOL-Key frame is created and transmitted\
    \ by the\n   Authenticator in order to provide media specific key information.\n\
    \   For example, within 802.11 the RC4 EAPOL-Key frame can be used to\n   distribute\
    \ multicast/broadcast (\"default\") keys, or unicast (\"key\n   mapping\") keys.\
    \  The \"default\" key is the same for all Stations\n   within a broadcast domain.\n\
    \   The RC4 EAPOL-Key frame is not acknowledged and therefore the\n   Authenticator\
    \ does not know whether the Supplicant has received it.\n   If it is lost, then\
    \ the Supplicant and Authenticator will not have\n   the same keying material,\
    \ and communication will fail.  If this\n   occurs, the problem is typically addressed\
    \ by re-running the\n   authentication.\n   The RC4 EAPOL-Key frame is sent from\
    \ the Authenticator to the\n   Supplicant in order to provision the \"default\"\
    \ key, and subsequently\n   in order to refresh the \"default\" key.  It may also\
    \ be used to\n   refresh the key-mapping key.  Rekey is typically only required\
    \ with\n   weak ciphersuites such as WEP, defined in [IEEE80211].\n   Where keys\
    \ are required, an EAP method that derives keys is typically\n   selected.  Therefore\
    \ the initial \"key mapping\" keys can be derived\n   from EAP keying material,\
    \ without requiring the Authenticator to send\n   an RC4 EAPOL-Key frame to the\
    \ Supplicant.  An example of how EAP\n   keying material can be derived and used\

    \ From the Supplicant point of\n      reference, the terms are reversed.  Thus\
    \ the MS-MPPE-Recv-Key on\n      the Supplicant corresponds to the MS-MPPE-Send-Key\
    \ on the\n      Authenticator, and the MS-MPPE-Send-Key on the Supplicant\n  \
    \    corresponds to the MS-MPPE-Recv-Key on the Authenticator.\n   Replay Counter\n\
    \      The Replay Counter field is 8 octets.  It does not repeat within\n    \

    \ The Key Signature field is 16 octets.  It contains an HMAC-MD5\n      message\
    \ integrity check computed over the EAPOL-Key descriptor,\n      starting from\
    \ the Version field, with the Key field filled in if\n      present, but with\
    \ the Key Signature field set to zero.  For the\n      computation, the 32 octet\
    \ (256 bit) MS-MPPE-Send-Key [RFC2548] is\n      used as the HMAC-MD5 key.\n \
    \  Key\n      If Packet Body Length = 44 + Key Length, then the Key Field\n  \
    \    contains the key in encrypted form, of length Key Length.  If\n      Packet\
    \ Body Length = 44, then the Key field is absent, and the\n      least significant\
    \ Key Length octets from the MS-MPPE-Send-Key\n      attribute is used as the\
    \ keying material.  Where the Key field is\n      encrypted using RC4, the RC4\
    \ encryption key used to encrypt this\n      field is formed by concatenating\
    \ the 16 octet (128 bit) Key-IV\n      field with the 32 octet MS-MPPE-Recv-Key\

    \  However, IEEE 802.1X is\n   based on EAP.  As described in [3579], Section\
    \ 3.1.:\n      The Message-Authenticator attribute MUST be used to protect all\n\
    \      Access-Request, Access-Challenge, Access-Accept, and Access-Reject\n  \

- title: 5.3.  Known Plaintext Attacks
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Known Plaintext Attacks\n   Since IEEE 802.1X is based on EAP, which does\
    \ not support PAP, the\n   RADIUS User-Password attribute is not used to carry\
    \ hidden user\n   passwords.  The hiding mechanism utilizes MD5, defined in [RFC1321],\n\
    \   in order to generate a key stream based on the RADIUS shared secret\n   and\
    \ the Request Authenticator.  Where PAP is in use, it is possible\n   to collect\
    \ key streams corresponding to a given Request Authenticator\n   value, by capturing\
    \ RADIUS conversations corresponding to a PAP\n   authentication attempt using\
    \ a known password.  Since the User-\n   Password is known, the key stream corresponding\
    \ to a given Request\n   Authenticator can be determined and stored.\n   The vulnerability\
    \ is described in detail in [RFC3579], Section 4.3.4.\n   Even though IEEE 802.1X\
    \ Authenticators do not support PAP\n   authentication, a security vulnerability\
    \ can still exist where the\n   same RADIUS shared secret is used for hiding User-Password\
    \ as well as\n   other attributes.  This can occur, for example, if the same RADIUS\n\
    \   proxy handles authentication requests for both IEEE 802.1X (which may\n  \
    \ hide the Tunnel-Password, MS-MPPE-Send-Key and MS-MPPE-Recv-Key\n   attributes)\
    \ and GPRS (which may hide the User-Password attribute).\n   The threat can be\
    \ mitigated by protecting RADIUS with IPsec ESP with\n   a non-null transform,\
    \ as described in [RFC3579], Section 4.2.  In\n   addition, the same RADIUS shared\
    \ secret MUST NOT be used for both\n   IEEE 802.1X authentication and PAP authentication.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.4.  Replay\n   As noted in [RFC3579] Section 4.3.5., the RADIUS protocol provides\n\
    \   only limited support for replay protection.  Replay protection for\n   RADIUS\
    \ authentication and accounting can be provided by enabling\n   IPsec replay protection\
    \ with RADIUS, as described in [RFC3579],\n   Section 4.2.\n   As with the Request\

- title: 5.7.  Key Management Issues
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Key Management Issues\n   The EAPOL-Key descriptor described in Section\
    \ 4. is likely to be\n   deprecated in the future, when the IEEE 802.11 enhanced\
    \ security\n   group completes its work.  Known security issues include:\n   [1]\
    \  Default key-only support.  IEEE 802.1X enables the derivation of\n        per-Station\
    \ unicast keys, known in [IEEE80211] as \"key mapping\n        keys.\"  Keys used\
    \ to encrypt multicast/broadcast traffic are\n        known as \"default keys\"\
    .  However, in some 802.11\n        implementations, the unicast keys, derived\
    \ as part of the EAP\n        authentication process, are used solely in order\
    \ to encrypt,\n        authenticate and integrity protect the EAPOL-Key descriptor,\
    \ as\n        described in Section 4.  These implementations only support use\n\
    \        of default keys (ordinarily only used with multicast/broadcast\n    \
    \    traffic) to secure all traffic, unicast or multicast/broadcast,\n       \
    \ resulting in inherent security weaknesses.\n        Where per-Station key-mapping\
    \ keys (e.g. unicast keys) are\n        unsupported, any Station possessing the\
    \ default key can decrypt\n        traffic from other Stations or impersonate\
    \ them.  When used\n        along with a weak cipher (e.g. WEP), implementations\
    \ supporting\n        only default keys provide more material for attacks such\
    \ as\n        those described in [Fluhrer] and [Stubbl].  If in addition, the\n\
    \        default key is not refreshed periodically, IEEE 802.1X dynamic\n    \
    \    key derivation provides little or no security benefit.  For an\n        understanding\
    \ of the issues with WEP, see [Berkeley], [Arbaugh],\n        [Fluhrer], and [Stubbl].\n\
    \   [2]  Reuse of keying material.  The EAPOL-Key descriptor specified in\n  \
    \      section 4 uses the same keying material (MS-MPPE-Recv-Key) both\n     \
    \   to encrypt the Key field within the EAPOL-Key descriptor, and to\n       \
    \ encrypt data passed between the Station and Access Point.\n        Multi-purpose\
    \ keying material is frowned upon, since multiple\n        uses can leak information\
    \ helpful to an attacker.\n   [3]  Weak algorithms.  The algorithm used to encrypt\
    \ the Key field\n        within the EAPOL-Key descriptor is similar to the algorithm\
    \ used\n        in WEP, and as a result, shares some of the same weaknesses. \
    \ As\n        with WEP, the RC4 stream cipher is used to encrypt the key.  As\n\
    \        input to the RC4 engine, the IV and key are concatenated rather\n   \
    \     than being combined within a mixing function.  As with WEP, the\n      \
    \  IV is not a counter, and therefore there is little protection\n        against\
    \ reuse.\n   As a result of these vulnerabilities, implementors intending to use\n\
    \   the EAPOL-Key descriptor described in this document are urged to\n   consult\
    \ the 802.11 enhanced security specification for a more secure\n   alternative.\
    \  It is also advisable to consult the evolving literature\n   on WEP vulnerabilities,\
    \ in order to better understand the risks, as\n   well as to obtain guidance on\
    \ setting an appropriate re-keying\n   interval.\n"
