  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a MIB for use with identifying the users associated\n\
    \   with TCP connections.  It provides functionality approximately\n   equivalent\
    \ to that provided by the protocol defined in RFC 1413 [1].\n   This document\
    \ is a product of the TCP Client Identity Protocol\n   Working Group of the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n"

- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ [2] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 [3] defines a\
    \ more concise description mechanism,\n      which is wholly consistent with the\
    \ SMI.\n      STD 17/RFC 1213 [4] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n\
    \      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 [5]\
    \ which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for\n      network access to managed\
    \ objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n   Managed objects are accessed via\
    \ a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.\
    \  Within a given MIB module,\n   objects are defined using RFC 1212's OBJECT-TYPE\
    \ macro.  At a\n   minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level,\
    \ and an\n   implementation-status.\n   The name is an object identifier, an administratively\
    \ assigned name,\n   which specifies an object type.  The object type together\
    \ with an\n   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation\n\
    \   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,\n  \
    \ termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax\
    \ of an object type defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that\
    \ object type.  The ASN.1 [6] language is used\n   for this purpose.  However,\
    \ RFC 1155 purposely restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These\
    \ restrictions are explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The access-level of\
    \ an object type defines whether it makes \"protocol\n   sense\" to read and/or\
    \ write the value of an instance of the object\n   type.  (This access-level is\
    \ independent of any administrative\n   authorization policy.)\n   The implementation-status\
    \ of an object type indicates whether the\n   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete,\
    \ or deprecated.\n"
- title: 2.  Identification MIB
  contents:
  - "2.  Identification MIB\n   The Identification MIB defines a uniform set of objects\
    \ useful for\n   identifying users associated with TCP connections.  End-systems\
    \ which\n   support TCP may, at their option, implement this MIB.  However,\n\
    \   administrators should read Section 4 (\"Security Considerations\")\n   before\
    \ enabling these MIB objects.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The information available through this MIB is\
    \ at most as trustworthy\n   as the host providing it OR the organization operating\
    \ the host.  For\n   example, a PC in an open lab has few if any controls on it\
    \ to prevent\n   a user from having an SNMP query return any identifier the user\n\
    \   wants.  Likewise, if the host has been compromised the information\n   returned\
    \ may be completely erroneous and misleading.\n   This portion of the MIB space\
    \ should only be used to gain hints as to\n   who \"owns\" a particular TCP connection\
    \ -- information returned should\n   NOT be considered authoritative for at least\
    \ the reasons described\n   above.  At best, this MIB provides some additional\
    \ auditing\n   information with respect to TCP connections.  At worse it can provide\n\
    \   misleading, incorrect or maliciously incorrect information.\n   The use of\
    \ the information contained in this MIB for other than\n   auditing or normal\
    \ network management functions is strongly\n   discouraged.  Specifically, using\
    \ information from this MIB space to\n   make access control decisions - either\
    \ as the primary method (i.e.,\n   no other checks) or as an adjunct to other\
    \ methods may result in a\n   weakening of normal system security.\n   This MIB\
    \ provides access to information about users, entities,\n   objects or processes\
    \ which some systems might normally consider\n   private.  The information accessible\
    \ through this MIB is a rough\n   analog of the CallerID services provided by\
    \ some phone companies and\n   many of the same privacy consideration and arguments\
    \ that apply to\n   CallerID service apply to this MIB space.  If you wouldn't\
    \ run a\n   \"finger\" server [7] due to privacy considerations, you might not\
    \ want\n   to provide access to this MIB space on a general basis.  Access to\n\
    \   this portion of the MIB tree may be controlled under the normal\n   methods\
    \ available through SNMP agent implementations.\n"
