  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower-\n
    \  Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB).  The primary objective of this LE\n   PHB
    is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\n   the default
    PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when\n   resources become
    scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic\n   and may preempt it.  Alternatively,
    packets forwarded by the LE PHB\n   can be associated with a scavenger service
    class, i.e., they scavenge\n   otherwise-unused resources only.  There are numerous
    uses for this\n   PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as
    bulk\n   data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups,\n
    \  larger software updates, web search engines while gathering\n   information
    from web servers and so on.  This document recommends a\n   standard Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE\n   PHB.\n   This specification obsoletes
    RFC 3662 and updates the DSCP\n   recommended in RFCs 4594 and 8325 to use the
    DSCP assigned in this\n   specification.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a Differentiated Services (DS) per-hop
    behavior\n   [RFC2474] called \"Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior\" (LE PHB), which
    is\n   intended for traffic of sufficiently low urgency that all other\n   traffic
    takes precedence over the LE traffic in consumption of\n   network link bandwidth.
    \ Low-urgency traffic has a low priority for\n   timely forwarding; note, however,
    that this does not necessarily\n   imply that it is generally of minor importance.
    \ From this viewpoint,\n   it can be considered as a network equivalent to a background
    priority\n   for processes in an operating system.  There may or may not be memory\n
    \  (buffer) resources allocated for this type of traffic.\n   Some networks carry
    packets that ought to consume network resources\n   only when no other traffic
    is demanding them.  From this point of\n   view, packets forwarded by the LE PHB
    scavenge otherwise-unused\n   resources only; this led to the name \"scavenger
    service\" in early\n   Internet2 deployments (see Appendix A).  Other commonly
    used names\n   for LE PHB types of services are \"Lower than best effort\"\n   [Carlberg-LBE-2001]
    or \"Less than best effort\" [Chown-LBE-2003].  In\n   summary, with the above-mentioned
    feature, the LE PHB has two\n   important properties: it should scavenge residual
    capacity, and it\n   must be preemptable by the default PHB (or other elevated
    PHBs) in\n   case they need more resources.  Consequently, the effect of this
    type\n   of traffic on all other network traffic is strictly limited (the\n   \"no
    harm\" property).  This is distinct from \"Best-Effort\" (BE)\n   traffic, since
    the network makes no commitment to deliver LE packets.\n   In contrast, BE traffic
    receives an implied \"good faith\" commitment\n   of at least some available network
    resources.  This document proposes\n   an LE DS PHB for handling this \"optional\"
    traffic in a DS node.\n"

  - "3.  Applicability\n   An LE PHB is applicable for many applications that otherwise
    use BE\n   delivery.  More specifically, it is suitable for traffic and services\n
    \  that can tolerate strongly varying throughput for their data flows,\n   especially
    periods of very low throughput or even starvation (i.e.,\n   long interruptions
    due to significant or even complete packet loss).\n   Therefore, an application
    sending an LE-marked flow needs to be able\n   to tolerate short or (even very)
    long interruptions due to the\n   presence of severe congestion conditions during
    the transmission of\n   the flow.  Thus, there ought to be an expectation that
    packets of the\n   LE PHB could be excessively delayed or dropped when any other
    traffic\n   is present.  Whether or not a lack of progress is considered to be
    a\n   failure is application dependent (e.g., if a transport connection\n   fails
    due to timing out, the application may try several times to\n   reestablish the
    transport connection in order to resume the\n   application session before finally
    giving up).  The LE PHB is\n   suitable for sending traffic of low urgency across
    a DS domain or DS\n   region.\n   Just like BE traffic, LE traffic SHOULD be congestion
    controlled\n   (i.e., use a congestion controlled transport or implement an\n
    \  appropriate congestion control method [RFC2914] [RFC8085]).  Since LE\n   traffic
    could be starved completely for a longer period of time,\n   transport protocols
    or applications (and their related congestion\n   control mechanisms) SHOULD be
    able to detect and react to such a\n   starvation situation.  An appropriate reaction
    would be to resume the\n   transfer instead of aborting it, i.e., an LE-optimized
    transport\n   ought to use appropriate retry strategies (e.g., exponential back-off\n
    \  with an upper bound) as well as corresponding retry and timeout\n   limits
    in order to avoid the loss of the connection due to the\n   above-mentioned starvation
    periods.  While it is desirable to achieve\n   a quick resumption of the transfer
    as soon as resources become\n   available again, it may be difficult to achieve
    this in practice.  In\n   the case of a lack of a transport protocol and congestion
    control\n   that are adapted to LE, applications can also use existing common\n
    \  transport protocols and implement session resumption by trying to\n   reestablish
    failed connections.  Congestion control is not only\n   useful for letting the
    flows within the LE Behavior Aggregate (BA)\n   adapt to the available bandwidth,
    which may be highly fluctuating; it\n   is also essential if LE traffic is mapped
    to the default PHB in DS\n   domains that do not support LE.  In this case, the
    use of background\n   transport protocols, e.g., similar to Low Extra Delay Background\n
    \  Transport (LEDBAT) [RFC6817], is expedient.\n   The use of the LE PHB might
    assist a network operator in moving\n   certain kinds of traffic or users to off-peak
    times.  Furthermore,\n   packets can be designated for the LE PHB when the goal
    is to protect\n   all other packet traffic from competition with the LE aggregate
    while\n   not completely banning LE traffic from the network.  An LE PHB\n   SHOULD
    NOT be used for a customer's \"normal Internet\" traffic and\n   packets SHOULD
    NOT be \"downgraded\" to the LE PHB instead of being\n   dropped, particularly
    when the packets are unauthorized traffic.  The\n   LE PHB is expected to have
    applicability in networks that have at\n   least some unused capacity during certain
    periods.\n   The LE PHB allows networks to protect themselves from selected types\n
    \  of traffic as a complement to giving preferential treatment to other\n   selected
    traffic aggregates.  LE ought not be used for the general\n   case of downgraded
    traffic, but it could be used by design, e.g., to\n   protect an internal network
    from untrusted external traffic sources.\n   In this case, there is no way for
    attackers to preempt internal\n   (non-LE) traffic by flooding.  Another use case
    in this regard is the\n   forwarding of multicast traffic from untrusted sources.
    \ Multicast\n   forwarding is currently enabled within domains only for specific\n
    \  sources within a domain -- not for sources from anywhere in the\n   Internet.
    \ One major problem is that multicast routing creates\n   traffic sources at (mostly)
    unpredictable branching points within a\n   domain, potentially leading to congestion
    and packet loss.  In the\n   case where multicast traffic packets from untrusted
    sources are\n   forwarded as LE traffic, they will not harm traffic from non-LE
    BAs.\n   A further related use case is mentioned in [RFC3754]: preliminary\n   forwarding
    of non-admitted multicast traffic.\n   There is no intrinsic reason to limit the
    applicability of the LE PHB\n   to any particular application or type of traffic.
    \ It is intended as\n   an additional traffic engineering tool for network administrators.\n
    \  For instance, it can be used to fill protection capacity of\n   transmission
    links that is otherwise unused.  Some network providers\n   keep link utilization
    below 50% to ensure that all traffic is\n   forwarded without loss after rerouting
    caused by a link failure (cf.\n   Section 6 of [RFC3439]).  LE-marked traffic
    can utilize the normally\n   unused capacity and will be preempted automatically
    in the case of\n   link failure when 100% of the link capacity is required for
    all other\n   traffic.  Ideally, applications mark their packets as LE traffic,\n
    \  because they know the urgency of flows.  Since LE traffic may be\n   starved
    for longer periods of time, it is probably less suitable for\n   real-time and
    interactive applications.\n   Example uses for the LE PHB:\n   o  For traffic
    caused by World Wide Web search engines while they\n      gather information from
    web servers.\n   o  For software updates or dissemination of new releases of operating\n
    \     systems.\n   o  For reporting errors or telemetry data from operating systems
    or\n      applications.\n   o  For backup traffic, non-time-critical synchronization,
    or\n      mirroring traffic.\n   o  For content distribution transfers between
    caches.\n   o  For preloading or prefetching objects from web sites.\n   o  For
    network news and other \"bulk mail\" of the Internet.\n   o  For \"downgraded\"
    traffic from some other PHB when this does not\n      violate the operational
    objectives of the other PHB.\n   o  For multicast traffic from untrusted (e.g.,
    non-local) sources.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  PHB Description\n   The LE PHB is defined in relation to the default PHB
    (BE).  A packet\n   forwarded with the LE PHB SHOULD have lower precedence than
    packets\n   forwarded with the default PHB, i.e., in the case of congestion,\n
    \  LE-marked traffic SHOULD be dropped prior to dropping any default PHB\n   traffic.
    \ Ideally, LE packets would be forwarded only when no packet\n   with any other
    PHB is awaiting transmission.  This means that in the\n   case of link resource
    contention LE traffic can be starved\n   completely, which may not always be desired
    by the network operator's\n   policy.  A scheduler used to implement the LE PHB
    may reflect this\n   policy accordingly.\n   A straightforward implementation
    could be a simple priority scheduler\n   serving the default PHB queue with higher
    priority than the LE PHB\n   queue.  Alternative implementations may use scheduling
    algorithms\n   that assign a very small weight to the LE class.  This, however,\n
    \  could sometimes cause better service for LE packets compared to BE\n   packets
    in cases when the BE share is fully utilized and the LE share\n   is not.\n   If
    a dedicated LE queue is not available, an active queue management\n   mechanism
    within a common BE/LE queue could also be used.  This could\n   drop all arriving
    LE packets as soon as certain queue length or\n   sojourn time thresholds are
    exceeded.\n   Since congestion control is also useful within the LE traffic class,\n
    \  Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] SHOULD be used for\n   LE
    packets, too.  More specifically, an LE implementation SHOULD also\n   apply Congestion
    Experienced (CE) marking for ECT-marked packets\n   (\"ECT\" stands for ECN-Capable
    Transport), and transport protocols\n   used for LE SHOULD support and employ
    ECN.  For more information on\n   the benefits of using ECN, see [RFC8087].\n"

  - "5.  Traffic-Conditioning Actions\n   If possible, packets SHOULD be pre-marked
    in DS-aware end systems by\n   applications due to their specific knowledge about
    the particular\n   precedence of packets.  There is no incentive for DS domains
    to\n   distrust this initial marking, because letting LE traffic enter a DS\n
    \  domain causes no harm.  Thus, any policing, such as limiting the rate\n   of
    LE traffic, is not necessary at the DS boundary.\n   As for most other PHBs, an
    initial classification and marking can\n   also be performed at the first DS boundary
    node according to the DS\n   domain's own policies (e.g., as a protection measure
    against\n   untrusted sources).  However, non-LE traffic (e.g., BE traffic)\n
    \  SHOULD NOT be re-marked to LE.  Re-marking traffic from another PHB\n   results
    in that traffic being \"downgraded\".  This changes the way the\n   network treats
    this traffic, and it is important not to violate the\n   operational objectives
    of the original PHB.  See Sections 3 and 8 for\n   notes related to downgrading.\n"

  - "6.  Recommended DSCP\n   The RECOMMENDED codepoint for the LE PHB is '000001'.\n
    \  Earlier specifications (e.g., [RFC4594]) recommended the use of Class\n   Selector
    1 (CS1) as the codepoint (as mentioned in [RFC3662]).  This\n   is problematic,
    since it may cause a priority inversion in Diffserv\n   domains that treat CS1
    as originally proposed in [RFC2474], resulting\n   in forwarding LE packets with
    higher precedence than BE packets.\n   Existing implementations SHOULD transition
    to use the unambiguous LE\n   codepoint '000001' whenever possible.\n   This particular
    codepoint was chosen due to measurements on the\n   currently observable Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP)\n   re-marking behavior in the Internet [IETF99-Secchi].
    \ Since some\n   network domains set the former IP Precedence bits to zero, it
    is\n   possible that some other standardized DSCPs get mapped to the LE PHB\n
    \  DSCP if it were taken from the DSCP Standards Action Pool 1 (xxxxx0)\n   [RFC2474]
    [RFC8436].\n"
  title: 6.  Recommended DSCP
- contents:
  - "7.  Deployment Considerations\n   In order to enable LE support, DS nodes typically
    only need\n   o  A BA classifier (see [RFC2475]) that classifies packets according\n
    \     to the LE DSCP\n   o  A dedicated LE queue\n   o  A suitable scheduling
    discipline, e.g., simple priority queueing\n   Alternatively, implementations
    could use active queue management\n   mechanisms instead of a dedicated LE queue,
    e.g., dropping all\n   arriving LE packets when certain queue length or sojourn
    time\n   thresholds are exceeded.\n   Internet-wide deployment of the LE PHB is
    eased by the following\n   properties:\n   o  No harm to other traffic: since
    the LE PHB has the lowest\n      forwarding priority, it does not consume resources
    from other\n      PHBs.  Deployment across different provider domains with LE\n
    \     support causes no trust issues or attack vectors to existing\n      (non-LE)
    traffic.  Thus, providers can trust LE markings from\n      end systems, i.e.,
    there is no need to police or re-mark incoming\n      LE traffic.\n   o  No PHB
    parameters or configuration of traffic profiles: the LE PHB\n      itself possesses
    no parameters that need to be set or configured.\n      Similarly, since LE traffic
    requires no admission or policing, it\n      is not necessary to configure traffic
    profiles.\n   o  No traffic-conditioning mechanisms: the LE PHB requires no traffic\n
    \     meters, droppers, or shapers.  See also Section 5 for further\n      discussion.\n
    \  Operators of DS domains that cannot or do not want to implement the\n   LE
    PHB (e.g., because there is no separate LE queue available in the\n   corresponding
    nodes) SHOULD NOT drop packets marked with the LE DSCP.\n   They SHOULD map packets
    with this DSCP to the default PHB and SHOULD\n   preserve the LE DSCP marking.
    \ DS domain operators that do not\n   implement the LE PHB should be aware that
    they violate the \"no harm\"\n   property of LE.  See also Section 8 for further
    discussion of\n   forwarding LE traffic with the default PHB instead of the LE
    PHB.\n"
  title: 7.  Deployment Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Re-marking to Other DSCPs/PHBs\n   \"DSCP bleaching\", i.e., setting the
    DSCP to '000000' (default PHB) is\n   NOT RECOMMENDED for this PHB.  This may
    cause effects that are in\n   contrast to the original intent to protect BE traffic
    from LE traffic\n   (the \"no harm\" property).  In the case that a DS domain
    does not\n   support the LE PHB, its nodes SHOULD treat LE-marked packets with
    the\n   default PHB instead (by mapping the LE DSCP to the default PHB), but\n
    \  they SHOULD do so without re-marking to DSCP '000000'.  This is\n   because
    DS domains that are traversed later may then still have the\n   opportunity to
    treat such packets according to the LE PHB.\n   Operators of DS domains that forward
    LE traffic within the BE\n   aggregate need to be aware of the implications, i.e.,
    induced\n   congestion situations and QoS degradation of the original BE traffic.\n
    \  In this case, the LE property of not harming other traffic is no\n   longer
    fulfilled.  To limit the impact in such cases, traffic\n   policing of the LE
    aggregate MAY be used.\n   In the case that LE-marked packets are effectively
    carried with the\n   default PHB (i.e., forwarded as BE traffic), they get a better\n
    \  forwarding treatment than expected.  For some applications and\n   services,
    it is favorable if the transmission is finished earlier\n   than expected.  However,
    in some cases, it may be against the\n   original intention of the LE PHB user
    to strictly send the traffic\n   only if otherwise-unused resources are available.
    \ In the case that\n   LE traffic is mapped to the default PHB, LE traffic may
    compete with\n   BE traffic for the same resources and thus adversely affect the\n
    \  original BE aggregate.  Applications that want to ensure the lower\n   precedence
    compared to BE traffic even in such cases SHOULD\n   additionally use a corresponding
    lower-than-BE transport protocol\n   [RFC6297], e.g., LEDBAT [RFC6817].\n   A
    DS domain that still uses DSCP CS1 for marking LE traffic\n   (including Low-Priority
    Data as defined in [RFC4594] or the old\n   definition in [RFC3662]) SHOULD re-mark
    traffic to the LE DSCP\n   '000001' at the egress to the next DS domain.  This
    increases the\n   probability that the DSCP is preserved end to end, whereas a\n
    \  CS1-marked packet may be re-marked by the default DSCP if the next\n   domain
    is applying Diffserv-Interconnection [RFC8100].\n"
  title: 8.  Re-marking to Other DSCPs/PHBs
- contents:
  - "9.  Multicast Considerations\n   Basically, the multicast considerations in [RFC3754]
    apply.  However,\n   using the LE PHB for multicast requires paying special attention
    to\n   how packets get replicated inside routers.  Due to multicast packet\n   replication,
    resource contention may actually occur even before a\n   packet is forwarded to
    its output port.  In the worst case, these\n   forwarding resources are missing
    for higher-priority multicast or\n   even unicast packets.\n   Several forward
    error correction coding schemes, such as fountain\n   codes (e.g., [RFC5053]),
    allow reliable data delivery even in\n   environments with a potentially high
    amount of packet loss in\n   transmission.  When used, for example, over satellite
    links or other\n   broadcast media, this means that receivers that lose 80% of
    packets\n   in transmission simply need five times longer to receive the complete\n
    \  data than those receivers experiencing no loss (without any receiver\n   feedback
    required).\n   Superficially viewed, it may sound very attractive to use IP\n
    \  multicast with the LE PHB to build this type of opportunistic\n   reliable
    distribution in IP networks, but it can only be usefully\n   deployed with routers
    that do not experience forwarding/replication\n   resource starvation when a large
    amount of packets (virtually) need\n   to be replicated to links where the LE
    queue is full.\n   Thus, a packet replication mechanism for LE-marked packets
    should\n   consider the situation at the respective output links: it is a waste\n
    \  of internal forwarding resources if a packet is replicated to output\n   links
    that have no resources left for LE forwarding.  In those cases,\n   a packet would
    have been replicated just to be dropped immediately\n   after finding a filled
    LE queue at the respective output port.  Such\n   behavior could be avoided --
    for example, by using a conditional\n   internal packet replication: a packet
    would then only be replicated\n   in cases where the output link is not fully
    used.  This conditional\n   replication, however, is probably not widely implemented.\n
    \  While the resource contention problem caused by multicast packet\n   replication
    is also true for other Diffserv PHBs, LE forwarding is\n   special, because often
    it is assumed that LE packets only get\n   forwarded in the case of available
    resources at the output ports.\n   The previously mentioned redundancy data traffic
    could suitably use\n   the varying available residual bandwidth being utilized
    by the LE\n   PHB, but only if the specific requirements stated above for\n   conditional
    replication in the internal implementation of the network\n   devices are considered.\n"

  - "10.  The Updates to RFC 4594\n   [RFC4594] recommended the use of CS1 as the
    codepoint in its\n   Section 4.10, whereas CS1 was defined in [RFC2474] to have
    a higher\n   precedence than CS0, i.e., the default PHB.  Consequently, Diffserv\n

    \  o  This update to RFC 4594 extends the Notes text below Figure 3 that\n      currently
    states \"Notes for Figure 3: Default Forwarding (DF) and\n      Class Selector

    \  o  Section 2.3 of [RFC4594] specifies the following: \"In network\n      segments
    that use IP precedence marking, only one of the two\n      service classes can
    be supported, High-Throughput Data or\n      Low-Priority Data.  We RECOMMEND
    that the DSCP value(s) of the\n      unsupported service class be changed to 000xx1
    on ingress and\n      changed back to original value(s) on egress of the network
    segment\n      that uses precedence marking.  For example, if Low-Priority Data\n
    \     is mapped to Standard service class, then 000001 DSCP marking MAY\n      be
    used to distinguish it from Standard marked packets on egress.\"\n      This document
    removes this recommendation, because by using the LE\n      DSCP defined herein,
    such re-marking is not necessary.  So, even\n      if Low-Priority Data is unsupported
    (i.e., mapped to the default\n      PHB), the LE DSCP should be kept across the
    domain as RECOMMENDED\n      in Section 8.  That removed text is replaced by the
    following: \"In\n      network segments that use IP Precedence marking, the Low-Priority\n
    \     Data service class receives the same Diffserv QoS as the Standard\n      service
    class when the LE DSCP is used for Low-Priority Data\n      traffic.  This is
    acceptable behavior for the Low-Priority Data\n      service class, although it
    is not the preferred behavior.\"\n   o  This document removes the following line
    in Section 4.10 of\n      RFC 4594: \"The RECOMMENDED DSCP marking is CS1 (Class\n
    \     Selector 1).\" and replaces it with the following text:\n      \"The RECOMMENDED
    DSCP marking is LE (Lower Effort), which replaces\n      the prior recommendation
    for CS1 (Class Selector 1) marking.\"\n"

  - "13.  Security Considerations\n   There are no specific security exposures for
    this PHB.  Since it\n   defines a new class that is of low forwarding priority,
    re-marking\n   other traffic as LE traffic may lead to QoS degradation of such\n
    \  traffic.  Thus, any attacker that is able to modify the DSCP of a\n   packet
    to LE may carry out a downgrade attack.  See the general\n   security considerations
    in [RFC2474] and [RFC2475].\n   With respect to privacy, an attacker could use
    the information from\n   the DSCP to infer that the transferred (probably even
    encrypted)\n   content is considered of low priority or low urgency by a user
    if the\n   DSCP was set per the user's request.  On the one hand, this disclosed\n
    \  information is useful only if correlation with metadata (such as the\n   user's
    IP address) and/or other flows reveal a user's identity.  On\n   the other hand,
    it might help an observer (e.g., a state-level actor)\n   who is interested in
    learning about the user's behavior from observed\n   traffic: LE-marked background
    traffic (such as software downloads,\n   operating system updates, or telemetry
    data) may be less interesting\n   for surveillance than general web traffic.  Therefore,
    the LE marking\n   may help the observer to focus on potentially more interesting\n
    \  traffic (however, the user may exploit this particular assumption and\n   deliberately
    hide interesting traffic in the LE aggregate).  Apart\n   from such considerations,
    the impact of disclosed information by the\n   LE DSCP is likely negligible in
    most cases, given the numerous\n   traffic analysis possibilities and general
    privacy threats (e.g., see\n   [RFC6973]).\n"

    suggested by Roland Bless and\n   Klaus Wehrle in September 1999 [Diffserv-LBE-PHB],
    named \"A Lower\n   Than Best-Effort Per-Hop Behavior\".  After some discussion
    in the\n   Diffserv Working Group, Brian Carpenter and Kathie Nichols proposed
    a\n   \"bulk handling\" per-domain behavior and believed a PHB was not\n   necessary.
    \ Eventually, \"Lower Effort\" was specified as per-domain\n   behavior and finally
    became [RFC3662].  More detailed information\n   about its history can be found
