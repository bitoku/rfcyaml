- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain\n\
    \   Name System to support hosts running IP version 6 (IPv6).  The\n   changes\
    \ include a new resource record type to store an IPv6 address,\n   a new domain\
    \ to support lookups based on an IPv6 address, and updated\n   definitions of\
    \ existing query types that return Internet addresses as\n   part of additional\
    \ section processing.  The extensions are designed\n   to be compatible with existing\
    \ applications and, in particular, DNS\n   implementations themselves.\n"
- title: 1. INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   Current support for the storage of Internet addresses in\
    \ the Domain\n   Name System (DNS)[1,2] cannot easily be extended to support IPv6\n\
    \   addresses[3] since applications assume that address queries return\n   32-bit\
    \ IPv4 addresses only.\n   To support the storage of IPv6 addresses we define\
    \ the following\n   extensions:\n      o A new resource record type is defined\
    \ to map a domain name to an\n        IPv6 address.\n      o A new domain is defined\
    \ to support lookups based on address.\n      o Existing queries that perform\
    \ additional section processing to\n        locate IPv4 addresses are redefined\
    \ to perform additional\n        section processing on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\
    \   The changes are designed to be compatible with existing software. The\n  \
    \ existing support for IPv4 addresses is retained. Transition issues\n   related\
    \ to the co-existence of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in DNS\n   are discussed\
    \ in [4].\n"
- title: 2. NEW RESOURCE RECORD DEFINITION AND DOMAIN
  contents:
  - "2. NEW RESOURCE RECORD DEFINITION AND DOMAIN\n   A new record type is defined\
    \ to store a host's IPv6 address. A host\n   that has more than one IPv6 address\
    \ must have more than one such\n   record.\n"
- title: 2.1 AAAA record type
  contents:
  - "2.1 AAAA record type\n   The AAAA resource record type is a new record specific\
    \ to the\n   Internet class that stores a single IPv6 address.\n   The value of\
    \ the type is 28 (decimal).\n"
- title: 2.2 AAAA data format
  contents:
  - "2.2 AAAA data format\n   A 128 bit IPv6 address is encoded in the data portion\
    \ of an AAAA\n   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first).\n"
- title: 2.3 AAAA query
  contents:
  - "2.3 AAAA query\n   An AAAA query for a specified domain name in the Internet\
    \ class\n   returns all associated AAAA resource records in the answer section\
    \ of\n   a response.\n   A type AAAA query does not perform additional section\
    \ processing.\n"
- title: 2.4 Textual format of AAAA records
  contents:
  - "2.4 Textual format of AAAA records\n   The textual representation of the data\
    \ portion of the AAAA resource\n   record used in a master database file is the\
    \ textual representation\n   of a IPv6 address as defined in [3].\n"
- title: 2.5 IP6.INT Domain
  contents:
  - "2.5 IP6.INT Domain\n   A special domain is defined to look up a record given\
    \ an address. The\n   intent of this domain is to provide a way of mapping an\
    \ IPv6 address\n   to a host name, although it may be used for other purposes\
    \ as well.\n   The domain is rooted at IP6.INT.\n   An IPv6 address is represented\
    \ as a name in the IP6.INT domain by a\n   sequence of nibbles separated by dots\
    \ with the suffix \".IP6.INT\". The\n   sequence of nibbles is encoded in reverse\
    \ order, i.e. the low-order\n   nibble is encoded first, followed by the next\
    \ low-order nibble and so\n   on. Each nibble is represented by a hexadecimal\
    \ digit. For example,\n   the inverse lookup domain name corresponding to the\
    \ address\n       4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab\n   would be\n"

  contents:
  - "3. MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING QUERY TYPES\n   All existing query types that perform\
    \ type A additional section\n   processing, i.e. name server (NS), mail exchange\
    \ (MX) and mailbox\n   (MB) query types, must be redefined to perform both type\
    \ A and type\n   AAAA additional section processing. These new definitions mean\
    \ that a\n   name server must add any relevant IPv4 addresses and any relevant\n\
    \   IPv6 addresses available locally to the additional section of a\n   response\
    \ when processing any one of the above queries.\n"
