  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework that\
    \ can\n   help manage 6to4 tunnels operating in an anycast configuration.  The\n\
    \   6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option for operators to\n  \
    \ help improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the\n   network\
    \ may provide sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4\n   operation. 6to4-PMT\
    \ supplies a stable provider prefix and forwarding\n   environment by utilizing\
    \ existing 6to4 relays with an added function\n   of IPv6 Prefix Translation.\
    \  This operation may be particularly\n   important in NAT444 infrastructures\
    \ where a customer endpoint may be\n   assigned a non-RFC1918 address, thus breaking\
    \ the return path for\n   anycast-based 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT has been successfully\
    \ used in\n   a production network, implemented as open source code, and\n   implemented\
    \ by a major routing vendor.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   6to4 [RFC3056] tunneling, along with the anycast operation\
    \ described\n   in [RFC3068], is widely deployed in modern Operating Systems and\n\
    \   off-the-shelf gateways sold throughout retail and Original Equipment\n   Manufacturer\
    \ (OEM) channels.  Anycast-based 6to4 [RFC3068] allows for\n   tunneled IPv6 connectivity\
    \ through IPv4 clouds without explicit\n   configuration of a relay address. \
    \ Since the overall system utilizes\n   anycast forwarding in both directions,\
    \ flow paths are difficult to\n   determine, tend to follow separate paths in\
    \ either direction, and\n   often change based on network conditions.  The return\
    \ path is\n   normally uncontrolled by the local operator and can contribute to\n\
    \   poor performance for IPv6 and can also act as a breakage point.  Many\n  \
    \ of the challenges with 6to4 are described in [RFC6343].  A specific\n   critical\
    \ use case for problematic anycast 6to4 operation is related\n   to conditions\
    \ in which the consumer endpoints are downstream from a\n   northbound Carrier-Grade\
    \ NAT (CGN) [RFC6264] function when assigned\n   non-RFC1918 IPv4 addresses, which\
    \ are not routed on interdomain\n   links.\n   Operators that are actively deploying\
    \ IPv6 networks and operate\n   legacy IPv4 access environments may want to utilize\
    \ the existing 6to4\n   behavior in customer site resident hardware and software\
    \ as an\n   interim option to reach the IPv6 Internet in advance of being able\
    \ to\n   offer full native IPv6.  Operators may also need to address the\n   brokenness\
    \ related to 6to4 operation originating from behind a\n   provider NAT function.\
    \ 6to4-PMT offers an operator the opportunity to\n   utilize IPv6 Prefix Translation\
    \ to enable deterministic traffic flow\n   and an unbroken path to and from the\
    \ Internet for IPv6-based traffic\n   sourced originally from these 6to4 customer\
    \ endpoints.\n   6to4-PMT translates the prefix portion of the IPv6 address from\
    \ the\n   6to4-generated prefix to a provider-assigned prefix that is used to\n\
    \   represent the source.  This translation will then provide a stable\n   forward\
    \ and return path for the 6to4 traffic by allowing the existing\n   IPv6 routing\
    \ and policy environment to control the traffic. 6to4-PMT\n   is primarily intended\
    \ to be used in a stateless manner to maintain\n   many of the elements inherent\
    \ in normal 6to4 operation.\n   Alternatively, 6to4-PMT can be used in a stateful\
    \ translation mode\n   should the operator choose this option.\n"
- title: 2.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation\n   Many operators endeavor to deploy IPv6 as soon as possible\
    \ so as to\n   ensure uninterrupted connectivity to all Internet applications\
    \ and\n   content through the IPv4 to IPv6 transition process.  The IPv6\n   preparations\
    \ within these organizations are often faced with both\n   financial challenges\
    \ and timing issues related to deploying IPv6 to\n   the network edge and related\
    \ transition technologies.  Many of the\n   new technologies available for IPv4\
    \ to IPv6 transition will require\n   the replacement of the organization's Customer\
    \ Premises Equipment\n   (CPE) to support technologies like IPv6 Rapid Deployment\
    \ (6RD)\n   [RFC5969], Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333], and native dual-stack.\n   Operators\
    \ face a number of challenges related to home equipment\n   replacement.  Operator-initiated\
    \ replacement of this equipment will\n   take time due to the nature of mass equipment\
    \ refresh programs or may\n   require the consumer to replace their own gear.\
    \  Replacing consumer\n   owned and operated equipment, compounded by the fact\
    \ that there is\n   also a general unawareness of what IPv6 is, also adds to the\n\
    \   challenges faced by operators.  It is also important to note that\n   6to4\
    \ is present in much of the equipment found in networks today that\n   do not\
    \ as of yet, or will not, support 6RD and/or native IPv6.\n   Operators may still\
    \ be motivated to provide a form of IPv6\n   connectivity to customers and would\
    \ want to mitigate potential issues\n   related to IPv6-only deployments elsewhere\
    \ on the Internet.\n   Operators also need to mitigate issues related to the fact\
    \ that 6to4\n   operation is often on by default, and may be subject to erroneous\n\
    \   behavior.  The undesired behavior may be related to the use of\n   non-RFC1918\
    \ addresses on CPE equipment that operate behind large\n   operator NATs or other\
    \ conditions as described in a general advisory\n   as laid out in [RFC6343].\n\
    \   6to4-PMT allows an operator to help mitigate such challenges by\n   leveraging\
    \ the existing 6to4 deployment base, while maintaining\n   operator control of\
    \ access to the IPv6 Internet.  It is intended for\n   use when better options,\
    \ such as 6RD or native IPv6, are not yet\n   viable.  One of the key objectives\
    \ of 6to4-PMT is to also help\n   reverse the negative impacts of 6to4 in CGN\
    \ environments.  The\n   6to4-PMT operation can also be used immediately with\
    \ the default\n   parameters that are often enough to allow it to operate in a\
    \ 6to4-PMT\n   environment.  Once native IPv6 is available to the endpoint, the\n\
    \   6to4-PMT operation is no longer needed and will cease to be used\n   based\
    \ on correct address selection behaviors in end hosts [RFC6724].\n   6to4-PMT\
    \ thus helps operators remove the impact of 6to4 in CGN\n   environments, deals\
    \ with the fact that 6to4 is often on by default,\n   and allows access to IPv6-only\
    \ endpoints from IPv4-only addressed\n   equipment.  Additionally, it provides\
    \ relief from many challenges\n   related to mis-configurations in other networks\
    \ that control return\n   flows via foreign relays.  Due to the simple nature\
    \ of 6to4-PMT, it\n   can also be implemented in a cost-effective and simple manner,\n\
    \   allowing operators to concentrate their energy on deploying native\n   IPv6.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  6to4 Provider Managed Tunnel Model\n   The 6to4 managed tunnel model behaves\
    \ like a standard 6to4 service\n   between the customer IPv6 host or gateway,\
    \ and the 6to4-PMT Relay\n   (within the provider domain).  The 6to4-PMT Relay\
    \ shares properties\n   with 6RD [RFC5969] by decapsulating and forwarding encapsulated\
    \ IPv6\n   flows within an IPv4 packet to the IPv6 Internet.  The model provides\n\
    \   an additional function that translates the source 6to4 prefix to a\n   provider-assigned\
    \ prefix that is not found in 6RD [RFC5969] or\n   traditional 6to4 operation.\n\

    \ with the 6to4 relay function in an attempt to help\n   simplify its deployment.\
    \  The model can also provide the ability for\n   an operator to forward both\
    \ 6to4-PMT (translated) and normal 6to4\n   flows (untranslated) simultaneously\
    \ based on configured policy.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Prefix Translation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Prefix Translation\n   IPv6 Prefix Translation is a key part of the system\
    \ as a whole.  The\n   6to4-PMT framework is a combination of two concepts: 6to4\
    \ [RFC3056]\n   and IPv6 Prefix Translation.  IPv6 Prefix Translation, as used\
    \ in\n   6to4-PMT, has some similarities to concepts discussed in [RFC6296].\n\
    \   6to4-PMT would provide prefix translation based on specific rules\n   configured\
    \ on the translator that maps the 6to4 2002::/16 prefix to\n   an appropriate\
    \ provider assigned prefix.  In most cases, a ::/32\n   prefix would work best\
    \ in 6to4-PMT that matches common Regional\n   Internet Registry (RIR) prefix\
    \ assignments to operators.\n   The provider can use any prefix mapping strategy\
    \ they so choose, but\n   the simpler the better.  Simple direct bitmapping can\
    \ be used, or\n   more advanced forms of translation should the operator want\
    \ to\n   achieve higher address compression.  More advanced forms of\n   translation\
    \ may require the use of stateful translation.\n   Figure 3 shows a 6to4 Prefix\
    \ with a Subnet-ID of \"0000\" mapped to a\n   provider-assigned, globally unique\
    \ prefix (2001:db8::/32).  With this\n   simple form of translation, there is\
    \ support for only one Subnet-ID\n   per provider-assigned prefix.  In characterization\
    \ of deployed OSs\n   and gateways, a Subnet-ID of \"0000\" is the most common\
    \ default case\n   followed by Subnet-ID \"0001\".  Use of the Subnet-ID can be\
    \ referenced\n   in [RFC4291].  It should be noted that in normal 6to4 operation,\
    \ the\n   endpoint (network) has access to 65,536 (16-bits) Subnet IDs.  In the\n\
    \   6to4-PMT case as described above using the mapping in Figure 3, all\n   but\
    \ the one Subnet-ID used for 6to4-PMT would still operate under\n   normal 6to4\

- title: 3.4.  Translation State
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Translation State\n   It is preferred that the overall system use deterministic\
    \ prefix\n   translation mappings such that stateless operation can be\n   implemented.\
    \  This allows the provider to place N number of relays\n   within the network\
    \ without the need to manage translation state.\n   Deterministic translation\
    \ also allows a customer to employ inward\n   services using the translated (provider\
    \ prefix) address.\n   If stateful operation is chosen, the operator would need\
    \ to validate\n   state and routing requirements particular to that type of deployment.\n\

- title: 4.1.  Customer Opt-Out
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Customer Opt-Out\n   A provider enabling this function should offer a method\
    \ to allow\n   customers to opt-out of such a service should the customer choose\
    \ to\n   maintain normal 6to4 operation irrespective of degraded performance.\n\
    \   In cases where the customer is behind a CGN device, the customer\n   would\
    \ not be advised to opt-out and can be assisted in turning off\n   6to4.\n   Since\
    \ the 6to4-PMT system is targeted at customers who are relatively\n   unaware\
    \ of IPv6 and IPv4, and normally run network equipment with a\n   default configuration,\
    \ an opt-out strategy is recommended.  This\n   method provides 6to4-PMT operation\
    \ for non-IPv6 savvy customers whose\n   equipment may turn on 6to4 automatically\
    \ and allows savvy customers\n   to easily configure their way around the 6to4-PMT\
    \ function.\n   Capable customers can also disable anycast-based 6to4 entirely\
    \ and\n   use traditional 6to4 or other tunneling mechanisms if they are so\n\
    \   inclined.  This is not considered the normal case, and most endpoints\n  \
    \ with auto-6to4 functions will be subject to 6to4-PMT operation since\n   most\
    \ users are unaware of its existence. 6to4-PMT is targeted as an\n   option for\
    \ stable IPv6 connectivity for average consumers.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Shared CGN Space Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Shared CGN Space Considerations\n   6to4-PMT operation can also be used\
    \ to mitigate a known problem with\n   6to4 occurring when shared address space\
    \ [RFC6598] or Global Unicast\n   Addresses (GUA) are used behind a CGN and not\
    \ routed on the Internet.\n   Non-RFC1918, yet unrouted (on interdomain links)\
    \ address space would\n   cause many deployed OSs and network equipment to potentially\n\
    \   auto-enable 6to4 operation even without a valid return path (such as\n   behind\
    \ a CGN function).  The operator's desire to use non-RFC1918\n   addresses, such\
    \ as shared address space [RFC6598], is considered\n   highly likely based on\
    \ real world deployments.\n   Such hosts, in normal cases, would send 6to4 traffic\
    \ to the IPv6\n   Internet via the anycast relay, which would in fact provide\
    \ broken\n   IPv6 connectivity, since the return path flow is built using an IPv4\n\
    \   address that is not routed or assigned to the source network.  The\n   use\
    \ of 6to4-PMT would help reverse these effects by translating the\n   6to4 prefix\
    \ to a provider-assigned prefix, masking this automatic and\n   undesired behavior.\n"
- title: 4.3.  End-to-End Transparency
  contents:
  - "4.3.  End-to-End Transparency\n   The 6to4-PMT mode of operation removes the\
    \ traditional end-to-end\n   transparency of 6to4.  Remote hosts would connect\
    \ to a 6to4-PMT-\n   serviced host using a translated IPv6 address versus the\
    \ original\n   6to4 address based on the 2002::/16 well-known prefix.  This can\
    \ be\n   seen as a disadvantage of the 6to4-PMT system.  This lack of\n   transparency\
    \ should also be contrasted with the normal operating\n   state of 6to4 that provides\
    \ connectivity that is uncontrolled and\n   often prone to high latency.  The\
    \ lack of transparency is, however, a\n   better form of operation when extreme\
    \ poor performance, broken IPv6\n   connectivity, or no IPv6 connectivity is considered\
    \ as the\n   alternative.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Path MTU Discovery Considerations\n   The MTU will be subject to a reduced\
    \ value due to standard 6to4\n   tunneling operation.  Under normal 6to4 operation,\
    \ the 6to4 service\n   agent would send an ICMP Packet Too Big Message as part\
    \ of Path MTU\n   discovery as described in [RFC4443] and [RFC1981], respectively.\
    \  In\n   6to4-PMT operation, the PMT Service agent should be aware of the\n \
    \  reduced 6to4 MTU and send ICMP messages using the translated address\n   accordingly.\n\
    \   It is also possible to pre-constrain the MTU at the upstream router\n   from\

    \ in one of two\n   ways.  The first deployment model is based on the stateless\
    \ 6to4-PMT\n   operational mode.  In this case, checksum modifications are made\n\
    \   using the method described in [RFC3022], Section 4.2.  The checksum\n   is\
    \ modified to match the parameters of the translated address of the\n   source\
    \ 6to4-PMT host.  In the second deployment model in which\n   stateful 6to4-PMT\
    \ translation is used, the vendor can implement\n   checksum-neutral mappings\
    \ as defined in [RFC6296].\n"

  - "4.6.  Application Layer Gateways\n   Vendors can choose to deploy Application\
    \ Layer Gateways (ALGs) on\n   their platforms that perform 6to4-PMT if they so\
    \ choose.  No ALGs\n   were deployed as part of the open source and vendor product\n\
    \   deployments of 6to4-PMT.  In the vendor deployment case, the same\n   rules\
    \ were used as with their NPTv6 [RFC6296] base code.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Routing Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Routing Requirements\n   The provider would need to advertise the well-known\
    \ IP address range\n   used for normal anycast 6to4 [RFC3068] operation within\
    \ the local\n   IPv4 routing environment.  This advertisement would attract the\
    \ 6to4\n   upstream traffic to a local relay.  To control this environment and\n\
    \   make sure all northbound traffic lands on a provider-controlled\n   relay,\
    \ the operator may filter the anycast range from being\n   advertised from customer\
    \ endpoints toward the local network (upstream\n   propagation).\n   The provider\
    \ would not be able to control route advertisements inside\n   the customer domain,\
    \ but that use case is not in scope for this\n   document.  In that case, it is\
    \ likely that the end network/customer\n   understands 6to4 and is maintaining\
    \ their own relay environment and\n   therefore would not be subject to the operators\
    \ 6to4 and/or PMT\n   operation.\n   Within their own network, the provider would\
    \ also likely want to\n   advertise the 2002::/16 range to help bridge traditional\
    \ 6to4 traffic\n   within the network (native IPv6 to 6to4-PMT-based endpoint).\
    \  It\n   would also be advised that the local 6to4-PMT operator not leak the\n\
    \   well-known 6to4 anycast IPv4 prefix to neighboring Autonomous Systems\n  \
    \ to prevent PMT operation for neighboring networks.  Policy\n   configuration\
    \ on the local 6to4-PMT Relay can also be used to\n   disallow PMT operation should\
    \ the local provider service downstream\n   customer networks.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Relay Deployments
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Relay Deployments\n   The 6to4-PMT function can be deployed onto existing\
    \ 6to4 relays (if\n   desired) to help minimize network complexity and cost. 6to4-PMT\
    \ has\n   already been developed on Linux-based platforms that are package\n \
    \  add-ons to the traditional 6to4 code.  The only additional\n   considerations\
    \ beyond normal 6to4 relay operation would include the\n   need to route specific\
    \ IPv6 provider prefix ranges used for 6to4-PMT\n   operation towards peers and\
    \ transit providers.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   6to4-PMT operation would be subject to the same\
    \ security concerns as\n   normal 6to4 operation as described in [RFC6169].  6to4-PMT\
    \ is also\n   not plainly perceptible by external hosts, and local entities appear\n\
    \   as native IPv6 hosts to the external hosts.\n"
