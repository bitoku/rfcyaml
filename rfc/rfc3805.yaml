    - "1.1.  Network Printing Environment\n   The management of producing a printed
      document, in any computer\n   environment, is a complex subject.  Basically,
      the task can be\n   divided into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing
      and\n   the management of the printer.  Printing encompasses the entire\n   process
      of producing a printed document from generation of the file\n   to be printed,
      selection of a printer, choosing printing properties,\n   routing, queuing,
      resource management, scheduling, and final printing\n   including notifying
      the user.  Most of the printing process is\n   outside the scope of the model
      presented here; only the management of\n   the printer is covered.\n              Figure

    - "1.2.  Printer Device Overview\n   A printer is the physical device that takes
      media from an input\n   source, produces marks on that media according to some
      page\n   description or page control language and puts the result in some\n
      \  output destination, possibly with finishing applied.  Printers are\n   complex
      devices that consume supplies, produce waste and may have\n   mechanical problems.
      \ In the management of the physical device the\n   description, status and alert
      information concerning the printer and\n   its various subparts has to be made
      available to the management\n   application so that it can be reported to the
      end user, key operators\n   for the replenishment of supplies or the repair
      or maintenance of the\n   device.  The information needed in the management
      of the physical\n   printer and the management of a printing job overlap highly
      and many\n   of the tasks in each management area require the same or similar\n
      \  information.\n"

    - "1.3.  Categories of Printer Information\n   Information about printers is classified
      into three basic categories:\n   descriptions, status and alerts.\n"
    - contents:
      - "1.3.1.  Descriptions\n   Descriptions convey information about the configuration
        and\n   capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units.  This\n   information
        is largely static information and does not generally\n   change during the
        operation of the system but may change as the\n   printer is repaired, reconfigured
        or upgraded.  The descriptions are\n   one part of the visible state of the
        printer where state means the\n   condition of being of the printer at any
        point in time.\n"
      title: 1.3.1.  Descriptions
    - contents:
      - "1.3.2.  Status\n   Status is the information regarding the current operating
        state of\n   the printer and its various sub-units.  As an example of the
        use of\n   status, a management application must be able to determine if the\n
        \  various sub-units are ready to print or are in some state that\n   prevents
        printing or may prevent printing in the future.\n"
      title: 1.3.2.  Status
    - contents:
      - "1.3.3.  Alerts\n   An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in
        the printer.\n   An event is a change in the state of the printer.  Some of
        those\n   state changes are of interest to a management application and are\n
        \  therefore reportable.  Typically, these are the events that affect\n   the
        printer's ability to print.  Alerts usually occur asynchronously\n   to the
        operation of the computer system(s) to which the printer is\n   attached.
        For convenience below, \"alert\" will be used for both the\n   event caused
        by a change in the printer's state and for the\n   representation of that
        event.\n   Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and
        non-\n   critical.  A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry into
        a\n   state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not continue\n
        \  until the condition that caused the critical alert is eliminated.\n   \"Out
        of paper\", \"toner empty\" and \"output bin full\" are examples of\n   critical
        alerts.  Non-critical alerts are triggered by those events\n   that enter
        a state in which printing is not stopped.  Such a non-\n   critical state
        may, at some future time, lead to a state in which\n   printing may be stopped.
        \ Examples of these kinds of non-critical\n   alerts are \"input media low\",
        \"toner low\" and \"output bin nearly\n   full\".  Or, a non-critical alert
        may simply provide information, such\n   as signaling a configuration changed
        in the printer.\n   Description, status and alert information about the printer
        can be\n   thought of as a database describing the printer.  The management\n
        \  application for a printer will want to view the printer data base\n   differently
        depending on how and for what purposes the information in\n   the database
        is needed.\n"

    - "2.1.  Overview of the Printer Model\n   The model has three basic parts: (1)
      the flow of a print file into an\n   interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the
      flow of media through the\n   marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control
      and facilitate\n   the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data comes through
      a\n   physical connection on which some form of transport protocol stack is\n
      \  running.  The data provided by the transport protocol (interface)\n   appears
      on a channel, which is the input to an interpreter.  The\n   interpreter converts
      the print data into a form suitable for marking\n   on the media.\n   The media
      resides in Input sub-units from which the media is selected\n   and then transported
      via a Media Path first to a Marking sub-unit and\n   then onto an Output sub-unit
      with (optionally) some finishing\n   operations being performed.  The auxiliary
      sub-units facilitate\n   control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator
      panel,\n   reporting of alerts and the adaptation of the printer to various\n
      \  natural languages and characters sets.  All the software sub-units\n   run
      on the System Controller that represents the processor, memory\n   and storage
      systems of the Printer.  Each of the sub-units is\n   discussed in more detail
      below.\n   All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state\n   information,
      either a description or a status.  The Alerts sub-unit\n   reports event information.\n"

          language, country, and\n   character set in which certain character strings
          are expressed in\n   this MIB.  Character sets are identified in this MIB

        on into\n   the printer.  A printer contains one or more input sub-units.
        \ The\n   Input Group in the model represents these.  The model does not\n
        \  distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report\n   when
        a removable tray has been removed.\n   There are as many input sub-units as
        there are distinctly selectable\n   input \"addresses\".  For example, if
        one tray has both a manual and\n   auto feeding option, then this is two input
        sub-units if these two\n   sources can be (must be) separately selected.  However,
        the above\n   would be considered one input sub-unit if putting a sheet in
        the\n   manual feed slot overrides feeding from the contents of the tray.

        of\n   possible media that can be associated with an input.  The Media Group\n
        \  is an extension of the Input Group, which represents media in an\n   input
        sub-unit.  The Media Group only describes the current contents\n   of each

        or more\n   output mechanisms contained by a printer.  The model does not\n
        \  distinguish fixed output bins from removable output bins, except to\n   report
        when a removable bin has been removed.\n   There are as many output sub-units
        as there are distinctly selectable\n   output \"addresses\".  Output sub-units
        can be addressed in two\n   different ways: (1) as a set of \"mailboxes\"

        or a bin name, or (2)\n   as a set of \"slots\" into which multiple copies
        are collated.\n   Sometimes both modes of using the output sub-units can be
        used on the\n   same printer.  All that is important from the viewpoint of
        the model\n   is that the output units can be separately selected.\n"

      - "2.2.5.  Finishers\n   A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations
        on the media\n   other than marking.  The Finisher Group in the model represents
        the\n   finisher sub-units.  Some examples of finishing processes are\n   stapling,
        punching, binding, inserting, or folding.  Finishing\n   processes may have
        supplies associated with the process.  Stapling,\n   binding, and punching
        are examples of processes that have supplies.\n   A printer may have more
        than one finishing sub-unit and each\n   finishing sub-unit may be associated
        with one or more output sub-\n   units. Finishers are described in the companion
        Finisher MIB\n   [RFC3806].\n   The model does not specify the exact interaction
        and sequencing\n   between an output device and its associated finisher.  It
        depends on\n   the type of finishing process and the exact implementation
        of the\n   printer system.  This standard allows for the logical association
        of\n   a finishing process with an output device but does not put any\n   restrictions
        on the exact sequence or interaction with the associated\n   output device.
        \ The output and finisher sub-units may or may not be\n   separate identifiable
        physical mechanisms depending on the exact\n   implementation of a printer.
        \ In addition, a single output device may\n   be associated with multiple
        finishing sub-units and a single\n   finishing sub-unit may be associated
        with multiple output devices.\n"

      - "2.2.6.  Markers\n   A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the
        print media.\n   The Marker Group in the model represents the marker sub-units
        and\n   their associated supplies.  A printer can contain one or more marking\n
        \  mechanisms.  Some examples of multiple marker sub-units are a printer\n
        \  with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an image setter\n
        \  that can output to both a proofing device and final film.  Each\n   marking
        device can have its own set of characteristics associated\n   with it, such
        as marking technology and resolution.\n   In this model the marker sub-unit
        is viewed as very generalized and\n   encompasses all aspects of a marking
        process.  For example, in a\n   xerographic process, the marking process as
        well as the fusing\n   process would be included in the generalized concept
        of the marker.\n   With the generalized concept of a marking process, the
        concept of\n   multiple marking supplies associated with a single marking
        sub-unit\n   results.  For example, in the xerographic process, there is not
        only\n   a supply of toner, but there can also be other supplies such as a\n
        \  fuser supply (e.g., fuser oil) that can be consumed and replaced\n   separately.
        \ In addition there can be multiple supplies of toner for\n   a single marker
        device, as in a color process.\n"

      - "2.2.7.  Media Paths\n   The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer
        that move the\n   media through the printer and connect all other media related
        sub-\n   units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers.  A printer contains\n
        \  one or more media paths.  The Media Path Group in the model\n   represents
        these.  The Media Path group has some objects that apply\n   to all paths
        plus a table of the separate media paths.\n   In general, the design of the
        media paths determines the maximum\n   speed of the printer as well as the
        maximum media size that the\n   printer can handle.  Media paths are complex
        mechanisms and can\n   contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms
        such as media\n   movement devices, media buffers, duplex units and interlocks.
        \ Not\n   all of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.  For\n
        \  example, one media path may provide printing only on one surface of\n   the
        media (a simplex path) and another media path may have a sub-\n   mechanism
        that turns the media over and feeds it a second time\n   through the marker
        sub-unit (a duplex path).  The duplex path may\n   even have a buffer sub-mechanism
        that allows multiple copies of the\n   obverse side to be held before the
        reverse side of all the copies is\n   marked.\n"

        which the software\n   components of the Printer run.  The Host Resources
        MIB [RFC2790]\n   represents the System Controller in the model.  The Host
        Resources\n   MIB allows for the specification of the processor(s), memory,
        disk\n   storage, file system and other underlying sub-mechanisms of the\n
        \  printer.  The controller can range from simple single processor\n   systems
        to multiprocessor systems.  In addition, controllers can have\n   a full range
        of resources such as hard disks.  The printer is modeled\n   to have one system

        \  by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II [RFC1213], [RFC2863].  Some\n   examples

        identify the independent\n   sources of print data (here print data is the
        information that is\n   used to construct printed pages and may have both
        data and control\n   aspects).  A printer may have one or more channels.  The
        channel sub-\n   units are represented by the Print Job Delivery Channel Group
        in the\n   Model.  The electronic path typically identifies each channel and\n
        \  service protocol used to deliver print data to the printer.  A\n   channel
        sub-unit may be independently enabled (allowing print data to\n   flow) or
        disabled (stopping the flow of print data).  It has a\n   current Control
        Language that can be used to specify which\n   interpreter is to be used for
        the print data and to query and change\n   environment variables used by the
        interpreters (and SNMP).  There is\n   also a default interpreter that is

        \  The Interpreter Group in the Model represents the interpreter sub-\n   units.

        console\n   that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.  The\n
        \  console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as\n   complicated
        as full screen displays and keyboards.  There can be at\n   most one such
        console.  The Console Group in the model represents\n   this console sub-unit.
        \ Although most of the information displayed\n   there is also available in
        the state of the printer as represented by\n   the various Groups, it is useful
        to be able to query and modify the\n   operator console remotely.  For example,
        a management application\n   might like to display to its user the current
        message on the operator\n   console of the remote printer or the management
        application user\n   might like to modify the current message on the operators
        console of\n   the remote printer.  As another example, one might have a remote\n
        \  application that puts up a pseudo console on a workstation screen.\n   Since

        versa are not standardized, it is not possible to reproduce\n   the console
        state or the action of console buttons and menus.\n   Therefore, the Console
        Group provides access to the console.  The\n   operator console is usually

        - "2.2.13.2.  Overall Printer Status\n   Of the many states a printer can
          be in, certain states are more\n   \"interesting\" because of the distinct
          actions they are likely to\n   provoke in the administrator.  These states
          may be applied to the\n   printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit
          of the printer.\n   These named states are:\n   Non Critical Alert Active
          - For the printer this means that one or\n   more sub-units have a non-critical
          alert active.  For a sub-unit,\n   this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical
          alert active.\n   Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that
          one or more\n   sub-units have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit,
          this means\n   that the sub-unit has a critical alert active.\n   Unavailable
          - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use (this is\n   the same as
          \"broken\" or \"down\" in other terminology).  A trained\n   service person
          is typically necessary to make it available.\n   Moving on-line or off-line
          - The printer is either off-line, in the\n   process of moving off-line
          or moving back on-line.  For example, on\n   printers with motorized hoppers,
          reloading paper involves a\n   transition to off-line to open the paper
          bin, filling the hopper and,\n   finally, a transition back to on-line as
          the paper bin is\n   repositioned for printing.\n   Standby - The printer
          or sub-unit is not immediately available but\n   can accept new instructions.\n
          \  Available - The printer or subunit is functioning normally.\n   Idle
          - The printer or subunit is immediately available.\n   Active - The printer
          or subunit is performing its primary function.\n   Busy - The printer or
          subunit is performing a function (not\n   necessarily its primary function)
          and is not immediately available\n   for its primary function.\n   The Host
          Resources MIB [RFC2790] provides three status objects that\n   can be used
          to describe the status of a printer: (1) hrDeviceStatus\n   in the entry
          in the hrDeviceTable; (2) hrPrinterStatus in the\n   hrPrinterTable; and
          (3) hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the\n   hrPrinterTable.  These objects
          describe many of the states that a\n   printer can be in.  The following
          table shows how the values of the\n   three printer-related objects in the

          addition, a printer in the Standby state will be\n   represented in the
          Host Resources MIB with a device status of\n   running(2) and a printer

        - "2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables\n   The Alert Group consists of a single table
          in which all active alerts\n   are represented.  This section provides an
          overview of the table and\n   a description of how it is managed.  The basic
          content of the alert\n   table is the severity (critical or non-critical)
          of the alert, the\n   Group and entry where a state change caused the alert,
          additional\n   information about the alert (a more detailed location, an
          alert code,\n   and a description), and an indication of the level of training
          needed\n   to service the alert.\n   The Alert Table contains some information
          that is redundant, for\n   example that an event has occurred, and some
          information that is only\n   represented in the Alert Table, for example
          the additional\n   information.  A single table was used because a single
          entry in a\n   group could cause more than one alert, for example paper
          jams in more\n   than one place in a media path.  Associating the additional\n
          \  information with the entry in the affected group would only allow one\n
          \  report where associating the additional information with the alert\n
          \  makes multiple reports possible.  Every time an alert occurs in the\n
          \  printer, the printer makes one or more entries into the Alert Table.\n
          \  The printer determines if an event is to be classified as critical or\n
          \  non-critical.  If the severity of the Alert is \"critical\", the\n   printer
          sends a trap or event notification to the host indicating\n   that the table
          has changed.  Whether or not a trap is sent, the\n   management application
          is expected to poll the printer on a regular\n   basis and to read and parse
          the table to determine what conditions\n   have changed, in order to provide
          reliable information to the\n   management application user.\n"
        title: 2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables
      - contents:
        - "2.2.13.4.  Alert Table Management\n   The alert tables are sparsely populated
          tables.  This means the\n   tables will only contain entries of the alerts
          that are currently\n   active and the number of rows, or entries in the
          table will be\n   dynamic.  More than one event can be added or removed
          from the event\n   tables at a time depending on the implementation of the
          printer.\n   There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts:
          binary\n   change events and unary change events.  Binary change events
          come in\n   pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing edge event.  The\n
          \  leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one exit;\n
          \  for example, going from running to stopped with a paper jam.  The\n   only
          exit from this state is fixing the paper jam and it is clear\n   when that
          is accomplished.  The trailing edge event exits the state\n   that was entered
          by the leading edge event.  In the example above,\n   fixing the paper jam
          is the trailing edge event.\n   It is relatively straightforward to manage
          binary change events in\n   the Alert Table.  Only the leading edge event
          makes an entry in the\n   alert table.  This entry persists in the Alert
          Table until the\n   trailing edge event occurs at which point this event
          is signaled by\n   the removal of the leading edge event entry in the Alert
          Table.  That\n   is, a trailing edge event does not create an entry; it
          removes the\n   corresponding leading edge event.  Removing the leading
          edge entry\n   may cause the unary change event \"alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry\"
          to\n   be added to the table.  With binary change events it is possible
          to\n   compute the maximum number that can occur at the same time and\n
          \  construct an Alert Table that would hold that many events.  There\n   would
          be no possibility of table overflow and no information about\n   outstanding
          events would be lost.\n   Unfortunately, there are some events that are
          not binary changes.\n   This other category of event, the unary change event,
          is illustrated\n   by the configuration change event.  With this kind of
          event the state\n   of the machine has changed, but to a state which is
          (often) just as\n   valid as the state that was left and from which no return
          is\n   necessary.  For example, an operator may change the paper that is
          in\n   the primary input source from letter to legal.  At some time in the\n
          \  future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it might be\n   changed
          to executive instead.  This is where the problem occurs.  It\n   is not
          obvious how long to keep unary change event entries in the\n   Alert Table.
          \ If they were never removed, the Alert Table would\n   continue to grow
          indefinitely.\n   The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the
          management\n   of the alert table, especially in the face of combinations
          of binary\n   and unary alerts that would overflow the storage capacity
          of the\n   table.  When the table is full and new alerts need to be added,
          an\n   old alert to be deleted should be chosen using the following rules:\n
          \  1. Find a non-critical unary alert and delete it.  If there are\n      multiple
          non-critical unary alerts, it is suggested that the\n      oldest one is
          chosen.  If there are no non-critical unary alerts,\n      then,\n   2.
          Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there are\n      multiple
          non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the\n      oldest one is
          chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary alerts,\n      then,\n   3.
          Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are\n      multiple
          critical alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one be\n      chosen.  Agent
          implementers are encouraged to provide at least\n      enough storage space
          for the maximum number of critical alerts\n      that could occur simultaneously.
          \ Note that all critical alerts\n      are binary.\n   In the event that
          a critical binary alert has been deleted out of the\n   alert table; when
          space allows and the alert condition still exists,\n   the alert should
          be re-added to the alert table even if there was no\n   subsequent transition
          into the associated state.  It is recommended\n   that this be done for
          non-critical binary alerts as well.  Note that\n   the new alert entry will

    - "2.3.  Read-Write Objects\n   Some objects in the printer MIB reflect the existence
      or amount of a\n   given resource within the printer.  Some examples of such
      resources\n   are the size and number of sheets in a paper tray or the existence
      of\n   certain output options.  Some printers have automatic sensors for\n   these
      resources.  Most printers lack sensors for every property of\n   every resource.
      \ The management application is allowed to write into\n   objects that hold
      descriptive or existence values for printers that\n   cannot sense these values.
      \ The ability to change the value of a\n   read- write object may depend on
      the implementation of the agent.\n   Many objects in the MIB are given read-write
      access, but a printer\n   implementation might only permit a management application
      to change\n   the value if the printer can not sense the value itself.  Note
      that\n   even though some objects explicitly state the behavior of conditional\n
      \  ability to change values, any read-write object may act this way.\n   Generally,
      an object is given read-write access in the Printer MIB\n   specification if:\n
      \  1. The object involves installation of a resource that some printers\n      cannot
      themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are needed to\n      inform the
      printer of the installation.  (Here external means\n      include using the
      operator console, or remote management\n      application) and\n   2. The printer
      will behave differently if the installation of the\n      resource is reported
      than the printer would if the installation\n      were not reported; that is,
      the object is not to be used as a\n      place to put information not used by
      the printer, i.e., not a\n      \"sticky-note\". Another way of saying this
      is that the printer\n      believes that information given it and acts as if
      the information\n      were true.  For example, on a printer that cannot sense
      the size,\n      if one paper size is loaded, but another size is set into the\n
      \     paper size object, then the printer will use the size that was set\n      as
      its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.\n   3. The printer
      may get hints that it may not know about the existence\n      or properties
      of certain resources.  For example, a paper tray may\n      be removed and re-inserted.
      \ When this removal and insertion\n      happens, the printer may either assume
      that a property, such as\n      the size of paper in the tray, has not changed
      or the printer may\n      change the value of the associated object to \"unknown\",
      as might\n      be done for the amount of paper in the tray.  As long as the\n
      \     printer acts according to the value in  the object either strategy\n      is
      acceptable.\n   4. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or
      not MIB\n      object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.\n
      \     It is particularly important that the values of the\n      prtMarkerLifeCount
      object persist throughout the lifetime of the\n      printer.  Therefore, if
      the value of any MIB object persists\n      across power cycles, then the prtMarkerLifeCount
      object must also\n      persist.\n"

    - "2.4.  Enumerations\n   Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined
      for use with\n   one or more objects.  Commonly used enumeration sets are assigned
      a\n   symbolic data type name (textual convention), rather than being\n   specified
      in the SYNTAX clause of each individual object definition.\n   Textual conventions
      defined in the Printer MIB or the companion IANA\n   Printer MIB are extensible
      by RFC publication or by Designated Expert\n   Review (see the 'IANA Considerations'
      section of this Printer MIB and\n   the DESCRIPTION clause in MODULE-IDENTITY
      of IANA Printer MIB).  All\n   of these textual conventions are:\n   a) used
      more than once in the Printer MIB itself; or\n   b) imported and used in the
      companion Finisher MIB; or\n   c) imported and used in any other, including
      vendor private, MIB\n      modules.\n   The Printer MIB has also defined the
      following special values for use\n   with objects of the syntax \"Integer32\"
      to define conditions that are\n   outside of the normal numeric range:  other(-1),
      unknown(-2), and\n   partial(-3).  The 'partial' value means that there is some
      supply\n   remaining (but the amount is indeterminate) or there is some capacity\n
      \  remaining (but the amount is indeterminate).  The Integer32 range\n   field
      indicates in which objects these special values are valid.\n"

        \  Type 1 - All of the legal values are defined in the Printer MIB.\n   Additional

    information to allow a printing application to use\n        the channel for data
    submission to the printer.  An application\n        capable of using a specific
    PrtChannelType should be able to\n        use the combined information from the
    prtChannelInformation and\n        other channel and interface group objects to
    'bootstrap' its\n        use of the channel.  prtChannelInformation is not intended
    to\n        provide a general channel description, nor to provide\n        information
    that is available once the channel is in use.\n        The encoding and interpretation
    of the prtChannelInformation\n        object is specific to channel type.  The
    description of each\n        PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation
    is\n        defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation,\n        including
    interaction with other objects.  For channel types\n        that do not specify
    a prtChannelInformation value, its value\n        shall be null (0 length).\n
    \       When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its\n        accompanying
    description must specify the encoding and\n        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation
    value for the\n        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing\n
    \       PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as\n        described
    in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.\n        The prtChannelInformation
    specifies values for a collection of\n        channel attributes, represented
    as text according to the\n        following rules:\n        1. The prtChannelInformation
    is not affected by localization.\n        2. The prtChannelInformation is a list
    of entries representing\n        the attribute values.  Each entry consists of
    the following\n        items, in order:\n        a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic
    characters (A-Z, a-z)\n        represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes,
    that\n        identifies a channel attribute,\n        b. The NVT ASCII code for
    an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to\n        delimit the keyword,\n        c. A data
    value encoded using rules specific to the\n        PrtChannelType to with the
    prtChannelInformation applies which\n        must in no case allow an octet with
    value 10 (the NVT ASCII\n        Line Feed code),\n        d. the NVT ASCII code
    for a Line Feed character (code 10) to\n        delimit the data value.\n        No
    other octets shall be present.\n        Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally,
    keywords are\n        capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword)
    and\n        since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are\n
    \       kept short.\n        3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it
    is\n        represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each\n        specifying
    one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one\n        entry for each attribute.\n
    \       4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are\n        ordering
    constraints for particular entries, these must be\n        specified in their
    definitions.\n        5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of
    text\n        represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes.  However,\n        other
    representations may be specified:\n        a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation
    value contains\n        information not normally coded in textual form, whatever\n
    \       symbolic representation is conventionally used for the\n        information
    should be used for encoding the\n        prtChannelInformation value.  (For instance,
    a binary port value\n        might be represented as a decimal number using NVT
    ASCII\n        codes.)  Such encoding must be specified in the definition of\n
    \       the value.\n        b. The value may contain textual information in a
    character set\n        other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.  (For instance,
    an\n        identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the\n        UTF-8
    encoding scheme.)  Such a character set and its encoding\n        must be specified
    in the definition of the value.\n        6. For each PrtChannelType for which
    prtChannelInformation\n        entries are defined, the descriptive text associated
    with the\n        PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following\n
    \       information for each entry:\n        Title:        Brief description phrase,
    e.g.: 'Port name',\n                      'Service Name', etc.\n        Keyword:
    \     The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service'\n        Syntax:       The
    encoding of the entry value if it cannot be\n                      directly represented
    by NVT ASCII.\n        Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally\n
    \                     Mandatory'\n        Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple'
    to indicate whether the\n                      entry may be present multiple times.\n
    \       Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other\n                      information
    required to complete the definition\n                      (e.g.: ordering constraints,
    interactions between\n                      entries).\n        Applications that
    interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore\n        unrecognized entries, so
    they are not affected if new entry\n        types are added.\"\n     ::= { prtChannelEntry

    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment

    \  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if
    the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there
    is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET
    (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED
    that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3
    framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3
    cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment
    of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED
    to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n   Where the operational capability of the printing
    device are\n   especially vulnerable or difficult to administer, certain objects\n
    \  within this MIB have been tagged as READ-ONLY, preventing\n   modification.
    \ Further, for all READ-WRITE objects within the MIB,\n   the working group has
    included specific conformance guidelines\n   stating that vendors are free to
    implement these objects as READ-\n   ONLY.  This conformance allowance should
    cover cases where specific\n   vendor vulnerabilities may differ from product
    to product.  (See\n   conformance section with regards to MIN-ACCESS clauses).\n"

  - "Appendix A - Glossary of Terms\n   Addressability - On the marker, the number
    of distinct marking units\n   (pels) per unit of addressability unit that can
    be set; for example,\n   300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths
    Of Inches\n   and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers.  Addressability\n
    \  is not resolution because marks that are one addressability position\n   apart
    may not be independently resolvable by the eye due to factors\n   such as gain
    in the area of marks so they overlap or nearly touch.\n   Alert - A reportable
    event for which there is an entry in the alert\n   table.\n   Bin - An output
    sub-unit which may or may not be removable.\n   Binary Change Event - An event
    which comes in pairs; the leading edge\n   event and the trailing edge event.
    \ The leading edge event enters a\n   state from which there is only one exit.
    \ A binary change event may\n   be critical or non-critical. See unary change
    event.\n   Bursting - The process by which continuous media is separated into\n
    \  individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre-formed\n   perforations.\n
    \  Channel - A term used to describe a single source of data which is\n   presented
    to a printer.  The model that we use in describing a\n   printer allows for an
    arbitrary number of channels.  Multiple\n   channels can exist on the same physical
    port.  This is commonly done\n   over Ethernet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP,
    and SPX/IPX protocols\n   can be supplying different data streams simultaneously
    to a single\n   printer on the same physical port.\n   Collation - In multiple
    copy output, placing the pages from separate\n   copies into separate ordered
    sets, ready for binding.\n   Control Language - A data syntax or language for
    controlling the\n   printer through the print data channel.\n   Critical Alert
    - An alert triggered by an event which leads to a\n   state in which printing
    is no longer possible; the printer is\n   stopped.\n   Decollating - The process
    by which the individual parts within a\n   multi-part form are separated and sorted
    into separate stacks for\n   each part.\n   Description - Information about the
    configuration and capabilities of\n   the printer and its various sub-units.\n
    \  DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.  A standard\n   for
    a client server protocol for a print system, including (1)\n   submitting print
    jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler.\n   Event - A state change in
    the printer.\n   Group - A collection of objects that represent a type of sub-unit
    of\n   the printer.\n   Host Resources MIB - See [RFC2790].\n   IANA - Internet
    Assigned Numbers Authority.  See [RFC3232].\n   Idempotent - Idempotence is the
    property of an operation that results\n   in the same state no matter how many
    times it is executed (at least\n   once).  This is a property that is shared by
    true databases in which\n   operations on data items only change the state of
    the data item and\n   do not have other side effects.  Because the SNMP data model
    is that\n   of operations on a database, SNMP MIB objects should be assumed to
    be\n   idempotent.  If a MIB object is defined in a non-idempotent way, the\n
    \  this data model can break in subtle ways when faced with packet loss,\n   multiple
    managers, and other common conditions.\n      In order to fulfill the common need
    for actions to result from\n      SNMP Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be
    modeled such that the\n      change in state from one state to another has the
    side effect of\n      causing an action.  It is important to note that with this
    model,\n      an SNMP operation that sets a value equal to its current value\n
    \     will cause no action.  This retains the idempotence of a single\n      command,
    while allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP SET\n      requests.\n   Input
    - A tray or bin from which instances of the media are obtained\n   and fed into
    the Media Path.\n   Interpreter - The embodiment of an algorithm that processes
    a data\n   stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL) and/or a\n   Control
    Language.\n   Localization - The specification of human language, country, and\n
    \  character set needed to present information to people in their native\n   languages.\n
    \  Management Application (a.k.a. Manager) - A program which queries and\n   controls
    one or more managed nodes.\n   Management Station - A physical computer on which
    one or more\n   management applications can run.\n   Media Path - The mechanisms
    that transport instances of the media\n   from an input, through the marker, possibly
    through media buffers and\n   duplex pathways, out to the output with optional
    finishing applied.\n   The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.\n
    \  Non-critical Alert - An alert triggered by a reportable event which\n   does
    not lead to a state in which printing is no longer possible;\n   such an alert
    may lead to a state from which printing may no longer\n   be possible in the future,
    such as the low toner state or the alert\n   may be pure informational, such as
    a configuration change at the\n   printer.\n   Output - A bin or stacker which
    accepts instances of media that have\n   been processed by a printer.\n   Page
    Description Language (PDL) - A data syntax or language for the\n   electronic
    representation of a document as a sequence of page images.\n   Printer - A physical
    device that takes media from an input source,\n   produces marks on that media
    according to some page description or\n   page control language and puts the result
    in some output destination,\n   possibly with finishing applied.\n   Printing
    - The entire process of producing a printed document from\n   generation of the
    file to be printed, choosing printing properties,\n   selection of a printer,
    routing, queuing, resource management,\n   scheduling, and finally printing including
    notifying the user.\n   Reportable event - An event that is deemed of interest
    to a\n   management station watching the printer.\n   Status - Information regarding
    the current operating state of the\n   printer and its various sub-units.  This
    is an abstraction of the\n   exact physical condition of the printer.\n   Sub-mechanism
    - A distinguishable part of a sub-unit.\n   Sub-unit - A part of the printer which
    may be a physical part, such\n   as one of the input sources or a logical part
    such as an interpreter.\n   Tray - An input sub-unit which is typically removable.\n
    \  Unary Change Event - An event that indicates a change of state of the\n   printer,
    but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the state\n   that was left,
    and from which no return is necessary.  See binary\n   change event.\n   Visible
    state - The portion of the state of the printer that can be\n   examined by a
    management application.\n   Warning - A non-critical alert.  See non-critical
    alert.\n"

  title: Appendix B - Media Size Names
- contents:
  - "Appendix C - Media Names\n   For the convenience of management application developers,
    this\n   appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175\n   Document
    Printing Application (DPA), [ISO10175].  Management\n   applications that present
    a dialogue for choosing media may wish to\n   use these names as an alternative
    to separately specifying, size,\n   color, and/or type.  New names may also be
    created using this format\n   and the names defined in the PWG Standardized Media
    Names\n   specification [PWGMEDIA].\n   Using standard media names will mean that
    a single management\n   application dealing with printers from different vendors
    and under\n   different system mangers will tend to use the same names for the
    same\n   media.  If selection of media by name is used, the attributes (size,\n
    \  type or color) implied by the name must be explicitly mapped to the\n   appropriate
    object (prtInputMediaDimFeedDirDeclared,\n   prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirDeclared,
    prtInputMediaType and\n   prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB.  The object prtInputMediaName
    is\n   intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive.  The\n   value
    in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer so using\n   a standard
    name for this value will not change any of the other media\n   attributes nor
    will it cause an alert if the media in the input sub-\n   unit does not match
    the name.\n   Simple Name                 Descriptor Text\n   other\n   unknown\n

  - "Appendix D - Roles of Users\n   Background\n   The need for \"Role Models\" stemmed
    in large part from the need to\n   understand the importance of any given proposed
    object for the MIB.\n   Many times the real world need for a proposed object would
    be debated\n   within the group; the debate would typically result in the need
    to\n   describe the potential usage of the object in terms of a \"live\"\n   person
    performing some type of printing-related task.\n   Determining the value of a
    proposed object through identification of\n   the associated human users was found
    to be so common that a more\n   formalized model was required for consistent analysis.
    \ The model\n   describing categories of human-oriented tasks is called \"Role
    Models\"\n   in this document.\n   In developing the Role Models it was necessary
    to identify the\n   common, primary tasks that humans typically face when interacting\n
    \  with a printer and its related printing system(s).  It was expected\n   that
    certain kinds of tasks would serve to identify the various Role\n   Models.\n
    \  In presenting the set of Role Models, the set of \"Common Print System\n   Tasks\"
    are first presented, followed by the set of Role Model\n   definitions.  Finally,
    a simple matrix is presented in which Role\n   Models and Tasks are cross-compared.\n
    \  Common Print System Tasks\n   Upon researching the many tasks encountered by
    humans in dealing with\n   printers and printing systems, the following were found
    to be\n   pervasive within any operating environment:\n   Printer job state -
    Determine the status of a job without a printer.\n   Printer capabilities - Determine
    the current capabilities of a\n   printer, for example, the available media sizes,
    two-sided printing,\n   a particular type of interpreter, etc.\n   Printer job
    submission - Submit a print job to a printer.\n   Printer job removal - Remove
    a job from a printer.\n   Notification of events - Receive notification of the
    existence of a\n   defined printer event.  An event can be of many types, including\n
    \  warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., \"job done\"), etc.\n   Printer
    configuration - Query the current configuration of a printer.\n   Printer consumables
    - Determine the current state of any and all\n   consumables within a printer.\n
    \  Print job identification - Determine the identification of a job\n   within
    a printer.\n   Internal printer status - Determine the current status of the\n
    \  printer.\n   Printer identification - Determine the identity of a printer.\n
    \  Printer location - Determine the physical location of a printer.\n   Local
    system configuration - Determine various aspects of the current\n   configuration
    of the local system involved with the operation of a\n   printer.\n   These \"tasks\"
    cover a large spectrum of requirements surrounding the\n   operation of a printer
    in a network environment.  This list serves as\n   the basis for defining the
    various Role Models described below.\n   Proposed Role Models\n   Following is
    the list of \"Role Models\" used to evaluate the\n   requirements for any given
    Printer MIB object.  Note that the keyword\n   enclosed in parentheses represents
    an abbreviation for the particular\n   Role Model in the matrix described later
    in this document.\n   User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print
    jobs to the\n   printer; typically viewed as the \"end user\" within the overall\n
    \  printing environment.\n   Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining
    a printer on a\n   day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty media
    trays,\n   emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges, clearing\n
    \  simple paper jams, etc.\n   Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing
    a\n   malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance,\n   and
    other tasks that typically require advanced training on the\n   printer internals.
    \ An example of a \"technician\" would be a\n   manufacturer's Field Service representative,
    or other person formally\n   trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.\n
    \  System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for configuration and\n   troubleshooting
    of components involved in the overall printing\n   environment, including printers,
    print queues and network\n   connectivity issues.  This person is typically responsible
    for\n   ensuring the overall operational integrity of the print system\n   components,
    and is typically viewed as the central point of\n   coordination among all other
    Role Models.\n   Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users
    in\n   their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting\n   Users'
    printing problems.\n   Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible for managing
    an\n   organization's printing system assets (primarily printers).  Such a\n   person
    needs to be able to identify and track the location of\n   printing assets on
    an ongoing basis.\n   Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person responsible for tracking
    the usage\n   of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of planning\n
    \  printer acquisitions and/or placement of printers based on usage\n   trends.\n
    \  Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for\n   installing
    or configuring printing system components on a local\n   system.\n   Accountant
    \ (ACCT) - A person responsible for tracking the usage of\n   printing resources
    on an ongoing basis for the purpose of charging\n   Users for resources used.\n
    \  Matrix of Common Print System Tasks and Role Models\n   To better understand
    the relationship between the set of defined\n   \"Common Print System Tasks\"
    and the various \"Role Models,\" the\n   following matrix is provided.\n   It
    is important to recognize that many of the tasks will appear to be\n   applicable
    to many of the Role Models.  However, when considering the\n   actual context
    of a task, it is very important to realize that often\n   the actual context of
    a task is such that the Role Model can change.\n   For example, it is obvious
    that a \"System Manager\" must be able to\n   submit print jobs to a printer;
    however, when submitting a print job,\n   a person identified as a \"System Manager\"
    is actually operating in\n   the context of a \"User\" in this case; hence, the
    requirement to\n   submit a print job is not listed as a requirement for a System\n
    \  Manager.\n   Conversely, while a \"User\" must be able to remove a job previously\n
    \  submitted to a printer, an \"Operator\" is often expected to be able to\n   remove
    any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal is a\n   (subtly different)
    requirement for both the \"User\" and \"Operator\"\n   Role Models.\n                           Role
    Models\n                           -----------\n      Requirement Area     USER

  - "Appendix E - Overall Printer Status Table\n   The Status Table establishes a
    convention for the top 25 printer\n   errors.  The table defines a suggested relationship
    between various\n   printer states and the variables Printer hrDeviceStatus,\n
    \  hrPrinterStatus, hrPrinterDetectedErrorState, prtAlertGroup,\n   prtAlertCode
    and various sub-unit status variables (prtInputStatus,\n   prtOutputStatus, prtMarkerStatus,
    prtMediaPathStatus and\n   prtChannelStatus).  This table is the recommended implementation
    of\n   these variables.  It is provided to guide implementors of this MIB\n   and
    users of the MIB by providing a sample set of states and the\n   variable values
    that are expected to be produced as result of that\n   state.  This information
    supplements that provided in Section\n   2.2.13.2 \"Overall Printer Status\".
    \ This is not an exhaustive list\n   rather it is a guideline.\n   The definition
    of PrtSubUnitStatusTC specifies that SubUnitStatus is\n   an integer that is the
    sum of 5 distinct values/states: Availability,\n   Critical, Non-Critical, On-line
    and Transitioning.  Thus when a non-\n   critical alert or alerts are present
    the values for Availability,\n   On-Line and Transitioning will be summed with
    the Non- Critical\n   Alerts (8) value.\n   The table was generated in landscape
    format and is located at\n   ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/pmp/contributions/Top25Errors.pdf.\n"
