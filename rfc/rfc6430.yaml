  - "1.  Introduction\n   In RFC 5965 [RFC5965], an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is
    defined for\n   reporting email abuse.  Currently, two feedback report types are\n
    \  defined that are related to the spam problem and that can be used to\n   report
    abusive or fraudulent email messages:\n   o  abuse: indicates unsolicited email
    or some other kind of email\n      abuse.\n   o  fraud: indicates some kind of
    fraud or phishing activity.\n   This specification defines a new feedback report
    type: \"not-spam\".\n   It can be used to report a message that was mistakenly
    marked as\n   spam.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Discussion\n   In some cases, the email client receives an email message
      that was\n   incorrectly tagged as spam, perhaps by the email system, or\n   accidentally
      by the user.  The email client accepts the end user's\n   \"not-spam\" report
      instruction, retrieves information related to the\n   message, and reports this
      email as not-spam to the email operator.\n   When the email operator receives
      the report, it can determine what\n   action is appropriate for the particular
      message and user.  (The\n   requirement for a not-spam report type is from the
      Open Mobile\n   Alliance (OMA) Spam Report Requirement Document [OMA-SpamRep-RD].)\n
      \  For example, in response to a \"not-spam\" report, the email system can\n
      \  remove the spam tag or otherwise reclassify the message, possibly\n   preventing
      similar email for this user from being marked as spam in\n   the future.  The
      report can be used to adjust the training of an\n   automated classifier.  After
      processing the report, the email\n   operator might send a notification to the
      email client about the\n   processing result (for example, by moving the message
      from one\n   mailbox to another, such as from \"Junk\" to \"Inbox\").\n   In
      most cases, \"not-spam\" reports will probably not be taken on their\n   own,
      but will be considered along with other information, analysis of\n   the message,
      etc.  Because different users have different needs and\n   different views of
      what constitutes spam, reports from one user might\n   or might not be applicable
      to others.  And because users might\n   sometimes press a \"report not spam\"
      button accidentally, immediate\n   strong action, such as marking all similar
      messages as \"good\" based\n   on a single report, is probably not the right
      approach.  Recipients\n   of \"not-spam\" reports need to consider what's right
      in their\n   environments.\n   There are anti-spam systems that use (non-standard)
      \"not spam\"\n   feedback today.  All of them take the reports and mix them
      with other\n   spam reports and other data, using their own algorithms, to determine\n
      \  appropriate action.  In no case do the existing systems use a \"not\n   spam\"
      report as an immediate, automatic override.\n   The feedback types \"abuse\"
      and \"not-spam\" can be taken as opposites.\n   A mistaken \"not-spam\" report
      could be countermanded by a subsequent\n   \"abuse\" report from the same user,
      and an operator could consider\n   collected reports of \"abuse\" and \"not-spam\"
      in making future\n   assessments.\n"

  - "2.  Feedback Report Type: not-spam\n   This document defines a new feedback report
    type, \"not-spam\", which\n   extends the Email Feedback Reports specification
    [RFC5965].\n   In the first MIME part of the feedback report message, the end
    user\n   or the email client can add information to indicate why the message\n
    \  is not considered as spam -- for example, because the originator or\n   its
    domain is well known.\n"

    has\n   received a message about discount pharmaceuticals.  Because that is a\n
    \  frequent subject of spam email, the message has been marked as spam\n   --
    incorrectly, in this case.  Joe has reported it as \"not-spam\", and\n   this
    is an example of the report, shortened (the \"[...etc...]\" part)\n   for presentation
    here.\n   Note that the message has been signed using DomainKeys Identified\n

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   All of the security considerations from the Email
    Feedback Reports\n   specification [RFC5965] are inherited here.  In addition,
    the Email\n   Feedback Reports Applicability Statement [MARF-AS] contains important\n
    \  information about trust relationships and other security- and\n   integrity-related
    aspects of accepting abuse feedback.\n   In particular, not-spam reports will
    likely be used in an attack on a\n   filtering system, reporting true spam as
    \"not-spam\".  Even in absence\n   of malice, some not-spam reports might be made
    in error, or will only\n   apply to the user sending the report.  Operators need
    to be careful\n   in trusting such reports, beyond their applicability to the
    specific\n   user in question.\n"
