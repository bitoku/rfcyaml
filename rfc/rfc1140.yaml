- title: 1.  The Standardization Process
  contents:
  - "1.  The Standardization Process\n   The Internet Activities Board maintains this\
    \ list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite\
    \ (see RFC-1120 for an\n   explanation of the role and organization of the IAB\
    \ and its\n   subsidiary groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and\
    \ the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)).  The IAB provides these\n   standards\
    \ with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the\n   Internet protocols;\
    \ this co-ordination has become quite important as\n   the Internet protocols\
    \ are increasingly in general commercial use.\n   The majority of Internet protocol\
    \ development and standardization\n   activity takes place in the working groups\
    \ of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force.\n   Protocols which are to become\
    \ standards in the Internet go through a\n   series of states (proposed standard,\
    \ draft standard, and standard)\n   involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and\
    \ experimental testing.\n   At each step, the Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG) of the\n   IETF must make a recommendation for advancement of the protocol\
    \ and\n   the IAB must ratify it.  If a recommendation is not ratified, the\n\
    \   protocol is remanded to the IETF for further work.\n   To allow time for the\
    \ Internet community to consider and react to\n   standardization proposals, the\
    \ IAB imposes a minimum delay of 4\n   months before a proposed standard can be\
    \ advanced to a draft standard\n   and 6 months before a draft standard can be\
    \ promoted to standard.\n   It is general IAB practice that no proposed standard\
    \ can be promoted\n   to draft standard without at least two independent implementations\n\
    \   (and the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard\n   to\
    \ standard generally requires operational experience and\n   demonstrated interoperability\
    \ of two or more implementations (and the\n   recommendation of the IESG).\n \
    \  In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decision\n   concerning\
    \ a protocol the IAB may convene a special review committee\n   consisting of\
    \ experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with the\n   purpose of recommending\
    \ an explicit action to the IAB.\n   Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard\
    \ is an important step\n   since it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual\
    \ standardization\n   (it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\").  Advancement\
    \ to\n   draft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unless\n\
    \   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol is\n   likely\
    \ to be advanced to standard in six months.\n   Some protocols have been superseded\
    \ by better ones or are otherwise\n   unused.  Such protocols are still documented\
    \ in this memorandum with\n   the designation \"historic\".\n   Because the IAB\
    \ believes it is useful to document the results of\n   early protocol research\
    \ and development work, some of the RFCs\n   document protocols which are still\
    \ in an experimental condition.  The\n   protocols are designated \"experimental\"\
    \ in this memorandum.  They\n   appear in this report as a convenience to the\
    \ community and not as\n   evidence of their standardization.\n   In addition\
    \ to the working groups of the IETF, protocol development\n   and experimentation\
    \ may take place as a result of the work of the\n   research groups of the Internet\
    \ Research Task Force, or the work of\n   other individuals interested in Internet\
    \ protocol development.  The\n   IAB encourages the documentation of such experimental\
    \ work in the RFC\n   series, but none of this work is considered to be on the\
    \ track for\n   standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation to advance\n\
    \   the protocol to the proposed standard state, and the IAB has approved\n  \
    \ this step.\n   A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without\
    \ the\n   approval of the IESG and the IAB.  For example, some vendor protocols\n\
    \   have become very important to the Internet community even though they\n  \
    \ have not been recommended by the IESG or ratified by the IAB.\n   However, the\
    \ IAB strongly recommends that the IAB standards process\n   be used in the evolution\
    \ of the protocol suite to maximize\n   interoperability (and to prevent incompatible\
    \ protocol requirements\n   from arising).  The IAB reserves the use of the terms\
    \ \"standard\",\n   \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" in any RFC or\
    \ other\n   publication of Internet protocols to only those protocols which the\n\
    \   IAB has approved.\n   In addition to a state (like \"proposed standard\")\
    \ a protocol is also\n   assigned a status, or requirement level.  A protocol\
    \ can be required,\n   meaning that all systems in the Internet must implement\
    \ it.  For\n   example, the Internet Protocol (IP) is required.  A protocol may\
    \ be\n   recommended, meaning that systems should implement this protocol.  A\n\
    \   protocol may be elective, meaning that systems may implement this\n   protocol;\
    \ that is, if (and only if) the functionality of this\n   protocol is needed or\
    \ useful for a system it must use this protocol\n   to provide the functionality.\
    \  A protocol may be termed limited use\n   or even not recommended if it is not\
    \ intended to be generally\n   implemented; for example, experimental or historic\
    \ protocols.\n   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\n\
    \   standard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the\n   status\
    \ is the current status.  However, the IAB will also endeavor to\n   indicate\
    \ the eventual status this protocol will have when the\n   standardization is\
    \ completed.\n   The IAB realizes that a one word label is not sufficient to\n\
    \   characterize the implementation requirements for a protocol in all\n   situations.\
    \  In many cases, an additional paragraph about the status\n   will be provided,\
    \ and in some cases reference will be made to\n   separate requirements documents.\n\
    \   Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems.  This is\n  \
    \ because there is such a variety of possible systems; for example,\n   gateways,\
    \ terminal servers, workstations, multi-user hosts.  It is\n   not necessary for\
    \ a gateway to implement TCP or the protocols that\n   use TCP (though it may\
    \ be useful).  It is expected that general\n   purpose hosts will implement at\
    \ least IP (including ICMP and IGMP),\n   TCP and UDP, Telnet, FTP, NTP, SMTP,\
    \ Mail, and the Domain Name System\n   (DNS).\n"
- title: 2.  The Request for Comments Documents
  contents:
  - "2.  The Request for Comments Documents\n   The documents called Request for Comments\
    \ (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is\
    \ the Internet research\n   and development community.  A document in this series\
    \ may be on\n   essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may\
    \ be\n   anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.\n\
    \   Notice:\n      All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n\
    \      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\
    \  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the\
    \ contact\n   information at the end of this memo).\n   While RFCs are not refereed\
    \ publications, they do receive technical\n   review from the task forces, individual\
    \ technical experts, or the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   The RFC series\
    \ comprises a wide range of documents such as\n   informational documents of general\
    \ interests to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where\
    \ submission is intended\n   to document a proposed standard, draft standard,\
    \ or standard\n   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with\
    \ the\n   approval of both the IESG and the IAB.  For documents describing\n \
    \  experimental work, the RFC Editor will typically request review\n   comments\
    \ from the relevant IETF working group or IRTF research group\n   and provide\
    \ those comments to the author prior to committing to\n   publication.  See Section\
    \ 5.1 for more detail.\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published,\
    \ that RFC is\n   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never\
    \ a\n   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However,\
    \ a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented\
    \ many times in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you\
    \ have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"IAB Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" memo is\n   the reference for determining the correct RFC\
    \ to refer to for the\n   current specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs\
    \ are available from the Network Information Center at SRI\n   International,\
    \ and a number of other sites.  For more information\n   about obtaining RFCs,\
    \ see Sections 7.4 and 7.5.\n"
- title: 3.  Other Reference Documents
  contents:
  - "3.  Other Reference Documents\n   There are four other reference documents of\
    \ interest in checking the\n   current status of protocol specifications and standardization.\
    \  These\n   are the Assigned Numbers, the Annotated Internet Protocols, the\n\
    \   Gateway Requirements, and the Host Requirements.  Note that these\n   documents\
    \ are revised and updated at different times; in case of\n   differences between\
    \ these documents, the most recent must prevail.\n   Also, one should be aware\
    \ of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.  These are\
    \ described in Section 3.5.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Assigned Numbers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   This document lists the assigned values of the parameters\
    \ used in the\n   various protocols.  For example, IP protocol codes, TCP port\
    \ numbers,\n   Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal Type names.\n\
    \   Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as RFC-1060.\n   Another document,\
    \ Internet Numbers, lists the assigned IP network\n   numbers, and the autonomous\
    \ system numbers.  Internet Numbers was\n   most recently issued as RFC-1117.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Annotated Internet Protocols
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Annotated Internet Protocols\n   This document lists the protocols and\
    \ describes any known problems\n   and ongoing experiments.  This document was\

    .\n"
- title: 3.3.  Gateway Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Gateway Requirements\n   This document reviews the specifications that\
    \ apply to gateways and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\

    \   specified by these sets of documents should be reported to DCA and to\n  \
    \ the IAB.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in style\n   and level\
    \ of detail.  It is strongly advised that the two sets of\n   documents be used\
    \ together.\n   The IAB and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP,\

- title: 4.  Explanation of Terms
  contents:
  - "4.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.\
    \  The first is\n   the STATE of standardization which is one of \"standard\"\
    , \"draft\n   standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\"\
    .  The\n   second is the STATUS of this protocol which is one of \"required\"\
    ,\n   \"recommended\", \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n\
    \   The IAB notes that the status or requirement level is difficult to\n   portray\
    \ in a one word label.  These status labels should be\n   considered only as an\
    \ indication, and a further description should be\n   consulted.\n   When a protocol\
    \ is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,\n   it is labeled with a\
    \ current status and when possible, the IAB also\n   notes the status that that\
    \ protocol is expected to have when it\n   reaches the standard state.\n   At\
    \ any given time a protocol is a cell of the following matrix.\n   Protocols are\
    \ likely to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions (indicated by the\
    \ relative number of Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely to start in the (proposed\
    \ standard, elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental, not recommended) cell.\n\

    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \
    \     protocol which types of systems are intended.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Definitions of Protocol State
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Definitions of Protocol State\n   There are two independent categorizations\
    \ of protocols.  The first is\n   the STATE of standardization, which is one of\
    \ \"standard\", \"draft\n   standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\"\
    , or \"historic\".\n   4.1.1.  Standard Protocol\n      The IAB has established\
    \ this as an official standard protocol for\n      the Internet.  These are separated\
    \ into two groups: (1) IP\n      protocol and above, protocols that apply to the\
    \ whole Internet;\n      and (2) network-specific protocols, generally specifications\
    \ of\n      how to do IP on particular types of networks.\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IAB is actively considering this protocol as a possible\n\
    \      Standard Protocol.  Substantial and widespread testing and comment\n  \
    \    are desired.  Comments and test results should be submitted to the\n    \
    \  IAB.  There is a possibility that changes will be made in a Draft\n      Standard\
    \ Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IAB\
    \ for\n      standardization in the future.  Implementation and testing by\n \
    \     several groups is desirable.  Revision of the protocol\n      specification\
    \ is likely.\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n      A system should not implement\
    \ an experimental protocol unless it\n      is participating in the experiment\
    \ and has coordinated its use of\n      the protocol with the developer of the\
    \ protocol.\n      Typically, experimental protocols are those that are developed\
    \ as\n      part of an ongoing research project not related to an operational\n\
    \      service offering.  While they may be proposed as a service\n      protocol\
    \ at a later stage, and thus become proposed standard,\n      draft standard,\
    \ and then standard protocols, the designation of a\n      protocol as experimental\
    \ may sometimes be meant to suggest that\n      the protocol, although perhaps\
    \ mature, is not intended for\n      operational use.\n   4.1.5.  Historic Protocol\n\
    \      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards in\n   \
    \   the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\n      developments\
    \ or due to lack of interest.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status\n      There are two independent categorizations\
    \ of protocols.  The\n      second is the STATUS of this protocol which is one\
    \ of \"required\",\n      \"recommended\", \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"\
    not recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required Protocol\n      A system must implement\
    \ the required protocols.\n   4.2.2.  Recommended Protocol\n      A system should\
    \ implement the recommended protocols.\n   4.2.3.  Elective Protocol\n      A\
    \ system may or may not implement an elective protocol. The\n      general notion\
    \ is that if you are going to do something like this,\n      you must do exactly\
    \ this.  There may be several elective protocols\n      in a general area, for\
    \ example, there are several electronic mail\n      protocols, and several routing\
    \ protocols.\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\n      These protocols are for use\
    \ in limited circumstances.  This may be\n      because of their experimental\
    \ state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality, or historic state.\n\
    \   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols are not recommended\
    \ for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited functionality,\
    \ specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic state.\n"

- title: 5.2.  The Standards Track Diagram
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The Standards Track Diagram\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE\
    \ categorization that is called\n   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes\
    \ of state are\n   significant to the progression along the standards track, though\
    \ the\n   status assignments may be changed as well.\n   The states illustrated\
    \ by single line boxes are temporary states,\n   those illustrated by double line\
    \ boxes are long term states.  A\n   protocol will normally be expected to remain\
    \ in a temporary state for\n   several months (minimum four months for proposed\
    \ standard, minimum\n   six months for draft standard).  A protocol may be in\
    \ a long term\n   state for many years.\n   A protocol may enter the standards\
    \ track only on the recommendation\n   of the IESG and by action of the IAB; and\
    \ may move from one state to\n   another along the track only on the recommendation\
    \ of the IESG and by\n   action of the IAB.  That is, it takes both the IESG and\
    \ the IAB to\n   either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\n \
    \  Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\n   made\
    \ as to the eventual STATUS (elective, recommended, or required)\n   the protocol\
    \ will have, although a somewhat less stringent current\n   status may be assigned,\
    \ and it then is placed in the the proposed\n   standard STATE with that status.\
    \  So the initial placement of a\n   protocol is into state 1.  At any time the\
    \ STATUS decision may be\n   revisited.\n         |\n         +<----------------------------------------------+\n\

  - "Notes:\n   IGMP -- The Internet Activities Board intends to move towards general\n\
    \   adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution than\n   broadcasting\
    \ for many applications.  The host interface has been\n   standardized in RFC-1112;\
    \ however, multicast-routing gateways are in\n   the experimental stage and are\
    \ not widely available.  An Internet\n   host should support all of RFC-1112,\
    \ except for the IGMP protocol\n   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for\
    \ more details.  Even\n   without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide\
    \ an important\n   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing.\
    \  It\n   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and\n  \
    \ gateways at some future date.\n   SMI, MIB, SNMP -- The Internet Activities\
    \ Board recommends that all\n   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.\
    \  This implies\n   implementation of the Internet MIB (RFC-1156) and at least\
    \ one of the\n   two recommended management protocols SNMP (RFC-1157) or CMOT\
    \ (RFC-\n   1095).  It should be noted that, at this time, SNMP is a full\n  \
    \ Internet standard and CMOT is a draft standard.  See also the Host\n   and Gateway\
    \ Requirements RFCs for more specific information on the\n   applicability of\
    \ this standard.\n"

    \  See also the Host and Router\n   Requirements RFCs for more specific information\
    \ on the applicability\n   of this standard.\n   RIP -- The Routing Information\
    \ Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n   and used in the Internet.  However,\
    \ both implementors and users\n   should be aware that RIP has some serious technical\
    \ limitations as a\n   routing protocol.  The IETF is currently developing several\n\
    \   candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol with better\n   properties\
    \ than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community to track\n   these developments,\
    \ and to implement the new protocol when it is\n   standardized; improved Internet\
    \ service will result for many users.\n   TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more\
    \ widely implemented and used,\n   there will be an increasing need to support\
    \ interoperation with the\n   TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force is formulating\n   strategies for interoperation.  RFC-1006 provides one\
    \ interoperation\n   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to\
    \ support OSI\n   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n\
    \   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.\
    \  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will\
    \ support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it\
    \ will then be possible to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using\
    \ full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\n"

  - "Notes:\n   This section is being reviewed by the IESG, which will recommend that\n\
    \   some of these protocols be moved to either the draft standard, or the\n  \
    \ experimental or historic categories.\n   MIB-II -- This memo defines a mandatory\
    \ extension to the base MIB\n   (RFC-1156) and is a Proposed Standard for the\
    \ Internet community.\n   The extensions described here are currently Elective,\
    \ but when they\n   become a standard, they will have the same status as RFC-1156,\
    \ that\n   is, Recommended.  The Internet Activities Board recommends that all\n\
    \   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  This implies\n   implementation\
    \ of the Internet MIB (RFC-1156 and the extensions in\n   RFC-xxxx) and at least\
    \ one of the two recommended management\n   protocols SNMP (RFC-1157) or CMOT\
    \ (RFC-1095).\n   PPP -- Point to Point Protocol is a method of sending IP over\
    \ serial\n   lines, which are a type of physical network.  It is expected that\
    \ a\n   system will support one or more physical networks and for each\n   physical\
    \ network supported the appropriate protocols from the\n   network-specific standard\
    \ protocols (Section 6.3) must be supported.\n   That is, it is elective to support\
    \ any particular type of physical\n   network, and for the physical networks actually\
    \ supported it is\n   required that they be supported exactly according to the\
    \ protocols\n   listed.  It is anticipated that PPP will be advanced to the network-\n\
    \   specific standard protocol state in the future.\n"
