  - ' A "Null MX" No Service Resource Record for Domains That Accept No Mail

  title: __initial_text__

  - "Abstract\n   Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through\n
    \  the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an\n   A/AAAA
    record as a fallback.  Unfortunately, this means that the\n   A/AAAA record is
    taken to be mail server address even when that\n   address does not accept mail.
    \ The No Service MX RR, informally\n   called \"null MX\", formalizes the existing
    mechanism by which a domain\n   announces that it accepts no mail, without having
    to provide a mail\n   server; this permits significant operational efficiencies.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the No Service MX, informally called
    \"null MX\",\n   as a simple mechanism by which a domain can indicate that it
    does not\n   accept email.\n   SMTP clients have a prescribed sequence for identifying
    a server that\n   accepts email for a domain.  Section 5 of [RFC5321] covers this
    in\n   detail; in essence, the SMTP client first looks up a DNS MX RR, and,\n
    \  if that is not found, it falls back to looking up a DNS A or AAAA RR.\n   Hence,
    this overloads a DNS record (that has a different primary\n   mission) with an
    email service semantic.\n   If a domain has no MX records, senders will attempt
    to deliver mail\n   to the hosts at the addresses in the domain's A or AAAA records.
    \ If\n   there are no SMTP listeners at the A/AAAA addresses, message delivery\n
    \  will be attempted repeatedly for a long period, typically a week,\n   before
    the sending Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) gives up.  This will\n   delay notification
    to the sender in the case of misdirected mail and\n   will consume resources at
    the sender.\n   This document defines a null MX that will cause all mail delivery\n
    \  attempts to a domain to fail immediately, without requiring domains\n   to
    create SMTP listeners dedicated to preventing delivery attempts.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described

  title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
- contents:
  - "3.  MX Resource Records Specifying Null MX\n   To indicate that a domain does
    not accept email, it advertises a\n   single MX RR (see Section 3.3.9 of [RFC1035])
    with an RDATA section\n   consisting of preference number 0 and a zero-length
    label, written in\n   master files as \".\", as the exchange domain, to denote
    that there\n   exists no mail exchanger for a domain.  Since \".\" is not a valid
    host\n   name, a null MX record cannot be confused with an ordinary MX record.\n
    \  The use of \".\" as a pseudo-hostname meaning no service available is\n   modeled
    on the SRV RR [RFC2782] where it has a similar meaning.\n   A domain that advertises
    a null MX MUST NOT advertise any other MX\n   RR.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Effects of Null MX\n   The null MX record has a variety of efficiency and
    usability\n   benefits.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  SMTP Server Benefits\n   Mail often has an incorrect address due to user
      error, where the\n   address was mistranscribed or misunderstood, for example,
      to\n   alice@www.example.com, alice@example.org, or alice@examp1e.com rather\n
      \  than alice@example.com.  Null MX allows a mail system to report the\n   delivery
      failure when the user sends the message, rather than hours\n   or days later.\n
      \  Senders of abusive mail often use forged undeliverable return\n   addresses.
      \ Null MX allows Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) and\n   other attempted
      responses to such mail to be disposed of efficiently.\n   The ability to detect
      domains that do not accept email offers\n   resource savings to an SMTP client.
      \ It will discover on the first\n   sending attempt that an address is not deliverable,
      avoiding queuing\n   and retries.\n   When a submission or SMTP relay server
      rejects an envelope recipient\n   due to a domain's null MX record, it SHOULD
      use a 556 reply code\n   [RFC7504] (Requested action not taken: domain does
      not accept mail)\n   and a 5.1.10 enhanced status code (Permanent failure: Recipient\n
      \  address has null MX).\n   A receiving SMTP server that chooses to reject
      email during the SMTP\n   conversation that presents an undeliverable RFC5321.MailFrom
      or\n   RFC5322.From domain can be more confident that for other messages a\n
      \  subsequent attempt to send a DSN or other response will reach a\n   recipient
      SMTP server.\n   SMTP servers that reject mail because a RFC5321.MailFrom or\n
      \  RFC5322.From domain has a null MX record SHOULD use a 550 reply code\n   (Requested
      action not taken: mailbox unavailable) and a 5.7.27\n   enhanced status code
      (Permanent failure: Sender address has null MX).\n"

    - "4.2.  Sending Mail from Domains That Publish Null MX\n   Null MX is primarily
      intended for domains that do not send or receive\n   any mail, but have mail
      sent to them anyway due to mistakes or\n   malice.  Many receiving systems reject
      mail that has an invalid\n   return address.  Return addresses are needed to
      allow the sender to\n   handle message delivery errors.  An invalid return address
      often\n   signals that the message is spam.  Hence, mail systems SHOULD NOT\n
      \  publish a null MX record for domains that they use in\n   RFC5321.MailFrom
      or RFC5322.From addresses.  If a system nonetheless\n   does so, it risks having
      its mail rejected.\n   Operators of domains that do not send mail can publish
      Sender Policy\n   Framework (SPF) \"-all\" policies [RFC7208] to make an explicit\n
      \  declaration that the domains send no mail.\n   Null MX is not intended to
      be a replacement for the null reverse-path\n   described in Section 4.5.5 of
      RFC 5321 and does not change the\n   meaning or use of a null reverse-path.\n"
