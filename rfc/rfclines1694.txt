Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing objects for SMDS access interfaces.
This includes the following access protocols: SIP [13] SIP/DXI [18] and [20] SIP/FR [19] SIP/ATM [24]
This memo replaces RFC 1304 [12], and defines a MIB module which is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI and semantically identical to the existing RFC 1304 based definitions.
This memo also assumes application of the MIB II Interfaces group as defined in [9].
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[6] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
Reference [12] defines the evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB II in terms of extensions and precise applications of the objects.
RFC 1445 [4] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [5] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This specification makes also use of: RFC 1443 [2] which defines textual conventions for the specification of managed objects.
RFC 1444 [3] which defines conformance statements for the specification of managed objects.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI RFC 1442 purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in the SNMPv2 SMI.
Additional managed objects that must be used to manage SMDS interfaces are defined in other MIB modules as indicated in the figure.
This means that these objects have been deprecated from the MIB module defined in RFC 1304, and ifTable is used instead.
No semantical changes have been made to these objects.
Only the object identifiers and object descriptors have been changed to the objects defined in ifTable.
Implementation experience has shown that the objects sipL3UnrecognizedIndividualDAs and sipL3UnrecognizedGAs were not supported.
SIP Level 3 Objects for SIP Level 3 apply to all methods to access SMDS shown in the figures above.
With the improved interpretation of the MIB II interfaces group, most objects can be represented by ifTable.
The appropriate mapping is defined below.
This document does not specify objects for the management of subscription or configuration of Subscriber Network Interfaces (SNIs).
Those objects are defined in Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Subscription [17].
Bellcore requirements on these objects are specified in TR TSV 001062 [16].
For example, SIP Level 3 sublayer of a SNI.
For example, 1.17 Mbps when using SIP based DS1 SNIs, and 1.536 Mbps when using DXI based DS1 DXI SNI.
OCTET STRING of Size 8.
Value is a 16 digit Binary Coded Decimal SMDS address that is assigned to this interface.
The desired administrative status of the SMDS interface.
The current operational status of the SMDS interface.
The elapsed time since the last re initialization of the interface.
The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state.
If the current state was entered prior to the last re initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
For SIP based SNIs, this is the number of sipL2ReceivedCounts multiplied by 44.
The total number of individually addressed SIP Level 3 PDUs received from the remote system across the SNI.
The total includes only unerrored SIP Level 3 PDUs.
[identical to RFC1304: sipL3ReceivedIndividualDAs] ifInDiscards
The number of received SIP Level 3 PDUs discarded.
For SMDS interfaces, this counter will always be zero.
Includes both group addressed SIP Level 3 PDUs and SIP Level 3 PDUs containing an individual destination address.
[identical to RFC1304: sipL3Errors] ifInUnknownProtos
The number of SIP Level 3 PDUs received from the remote system with a Source or Destination Address Type subfields, (the four most significant bits of the 64 bit address field), not equal to the value 1100 or 1110.
Also, an error is considered to have occurred if the Address Type field for a Source Address is equal to 1110 (a group address).
For SIP based SNIs, this is the number of sipL2SentCounts multiplied by 44.
The number of individually addressed SIP Level 3 PDUs that have been sent by this system across the interface.
The number of SIP Level 3 PDUs discarded in the egress direction.
For SMDS interfaces, this counter will always be zero.
The number of SIP Level 3 PDUs discarded in the egress direction, because of errors.
For SMDS interfaces, this counter will always be zero.
If not used, this variable contains a zero length string.
The total number of group addressed SIP Level 3 PDUs received from the remote system across the interface.
The total includes only unerrored SIP Level 3 PDUs.
[identical to RFC1304: sipL3ReceivedGAs] ifInBroadcastPkts
This variable is not applicable for SMDS interfaces.
Therefore, this counter is always zero.
The number of group addressed SIP Level 3 PDUs that have been sent by this system across the interface.
[identical to RFC1304: sipL3SentGAs] ifOutBroadcastPkts
This variable is not applicable for SMDS interfaces.
Therefore, this counter is always zero.
The value of this object is disabled(2) for SIP Level 3 interfaces.
If the user data rate is less than 1 Mbps, then this value is zero.
Consult the Evolution of the Interfaces Group [9] for when to use the HC (High Capacity) counters
(e.g., ifHCInOctets is a 64 bit counter).

"A value which indicates the version(s) of SIP that this interface supports.
The value is a sum.
This sum initially takes the value zero.
For each version, V, that this interface supports, 2 raised to (V 1) is added to the sum.
For example, a port supporting versions 1 and 2 would have a value of (2^(1 1) 2^(2 1)) 3.
The sipL3VersionSupport is effectively a bit mask with Version 1 equal to the least significant bit (LSB)."
SEQUENCE OF SipL2Entry MAX ACCESS
"This table contains SIP L2PDU parameters and state variables, one entry per SIP L2 interface."
"This list contains SIP L2 parameters and state variables.
"The value of this object identifies the SIP interface for which this entry contains management information."
"The number of SIP Level 2 PDUs received from the remote system across the SNI.
The total includes only unerrored L2PDUs."
The receipt of SIP Level 2 PDUs which are BOMs and   for with a MID that is already active will cause   sipL2MidCurrentlyActiveErrors to increment.
Any already accumulated (correct) segmentation   units are discarded.
The sipL2ReceivedCounts   is incremented by 1.
Thus,   sipL2ReceivedCounts defines the number of   correct SIP Level 2 PDUs delivered to the reassembly   process.
"The number of received SIP Level 2 PDUs that had Payload Length errors that fall in the following specifications: SSM L2 PDU payload length field value less than 28 octets or greater than 44 octets, BOM or COM L2 PDU payload length field not equal to 44 octets, EOM L2 PDU payload length field value less than 4 octets or greater than 44 octets."

Although the objects in this group are read only, at the   agent's discretion they may be made read write so that the   management station, when appropriately authorized, may   change the addressing information related to the   configuration of a logical IP subnetwork implemented on   top of SMDS.
This table is necessary to support RFC1209 (IP over SMDS)   and gives information on the Group Addresses and ARP
Addresses used in the Logical IP subnetwork.
One SMDS address may be associated with multiple IP   addresses.
One SNI may be associated with multiple LISs.
SEQUENCE OF IpOverSMDSEntry MAX ACCESS
"The table of addressing information relevant to this entity's IP addresses."
The addressing information for one of this entity's IP addresses.
"The value of this object identifies the interface for which this entry contains management information. "

"The SMDS Individual address of the IP station."
"The SMDS Group Address that has been configured to identify the SMDS Subscriber Network Interfaces (SNIs) of all members of the Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) connected to the network supporting SMDS."
"The SMDS address (individual or group) to which ARP Requests are to be sent."
This group is used as a place holder   for carrier selection objects.
SEQUENCE OF SipL3PDUErrorEntry MAX ACCESS
A table that contains the latest occurrence of the following syntactical SIP L3PDU errors: Destination Address Field Format Error, The following pertains to the 60 least significant bits of the 64 bit address field.
The 60 bits contained in the address subfield can be used to represent addresses up to 15 decimal digits.
Each decimal digit shall be encoded into four bits using Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), with the most significant digit occurring left most.
If not all 15 digits are required, then the remainder of this field shall be padded on the right with bits set to one.
An error is considered to have occurred:
if the first four bits of the address subfield are not BCD, OR b).
if the first four bits of the address subfield are populated with the country code value 0001, AND the 40 bits which follow are not Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) encoded values of the 10 digit addresses, OR the remaining 16 least significant bits are not populated with 1's, OR c).
if the address subfield is not correct according to another numbering plan which is dependent upon the carrier assigning the numbers and offering SMDS.
Source Address Field Format Error, The description of this parameter is the same as the description of the Destination Address Field Format Error.
Invalid BAsize Field Value, An error is considered to have occurred when the BAsize field of an SIP L3PDU contains a value less that 32, greater than 9220 octets without the CRC32 field present, greater than 9224 octets with the CRC32 field present, or not equal to a multiple of 4 octets, Invalid Header Extension Length Field Value, An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension Length field value is not equal 3.
Invalid Header Extension Element Length, An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension Element Length is greater than 12.
Invalid Header Extension Version Element Position, Length, or Value, An error is considered to have occurred when a Version element with Length 3, Type 0, and Value 1 does not appear first within the Header Extension, or an element Type 0 appears somewhere other than within the first three octets in the Header Extension.
Invalid Header Extension Carrier Selection Element Position, Length, Value or Format, An error is considered to have occurred when a Carrier Selection element does not appear second within the Header Extension, if the Element Type does not equal 1, the Element Length does not equal 4, 6, or 8, the Element Value field is not
four BCD encoded decimal digits used in specifying the Carrier Identification Code (CIC), or the identified CIC code is invalid.
An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension PAD is 9 octets in length, or if the Header Extension PAD is greater than zero octets in length and the Header Extension PAD does not follow all Header Extension elements or does not begin with at least one octet of all zeros.
BEtag Mismatch Error, An error is considered to have occurred when the Beginning End Tags in the SIP L3PDU header and trailer are not equal.
BAsize Field not equal to Length Field Error, An error is considered to have occurred when the value of the BAsize Field does not equal the value of the Length Field.
Incorrect Length Error, and An error is considered to have occurred when the the Length field value is not equal to the portion of the SIP L3PDU which extends from the Destination Address field up to and including the CRC32 field (if present) or up to and including the PAD field (if the CRC32 field is not present).
As an optional check, an error is considered to have occurred when the length of a partially received SIP L3PDU exceeds the BAsize value.
An error is considered to have occurred when the elapsed time between receipt of BOM and corresponding EOM exceeds the value of the MRI (Message Receive Interval) for a particular transport signal format.
An entry is indexed by interface number and error type, and contains Source Address, Destination Address and a timestamp.
All these errors are counted in the sipL3Errors counter.
When sipL3PDUErrorTimeStamp is equal to zero, the SipL3PDUErrorEntry does not contain any valid information."
