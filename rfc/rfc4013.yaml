  - "Abstract\n   This document describes how to prepare Unicode strings representing\n\
    \   user names and passwords for comparison.  The document defines the\n   \"\
    SASLprep\" profile of the \"stringprep\" algorithm to be used for both\n   user\
    \ names and passwords.  This profile is intended to be used by\n   Simple Authentication\
    \ and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms (such as\n   PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5),\
    \ as well as other protocols\n   exchanging simple user names and/or passwords.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The use of simple user names and passwords in authentication\
    \ and\n   authorization is pervasive on the Internet.  To increase the\n   likelihood\
    \ that user name and password input and comparison work in\n   ways that make\
    \ sense for typical users throughout the world, this\n   document defines rules\
    \ for preparing internationalized user names and\n   passwords for comparison.\
    \  For simplicity and implementation ease, a\n   single algorithm is defined for\
    \ both user names and passwords.\n   The algorithm assumes all strings are comprised\
    \ of characters from\n   the Unicode [Unicode] character set.\n   This document\
    \ defines the \"SASLprep\" profile of the \"stringprep\"\n   algorithm [StringPrep].\n\
    \   The profile is designed for use in Simple Authentication and Security\n  \
    \ Layer ([SASL]) mechanisms, such as [PLAIN], [CRAM-MD5], and\n   [DIGEST-MD5].\
    \  It may be applicable where simple user names and\n   passwords are used.  This\
    \ profile is not intended for use in\n   preparing identity strings that are not\
    \ simple user names (e.g.,\n   email addresses, domain names, distinguished names),\
    \ or where\n   identity or password strings that are not character data, or require\n\
    \   different handling (e.g., case folding).\n   This document does not alter\
    \ the technical specification of any\n   existing protocols.  Any specification\
    \ that wishes to use the\n   algorithm described in this document needs to explicitly\
    \ incorporate\n   this document and provide precise details as to where and how\
    \ this\n   algorithm is used by implementations of that specification.\n"
- title: 2.  The SASLprep Profile
  contents:
  - "2.  The SASLprep Profile\n   This section defines the \"SASLprep\" profile of\
    \ the \"stringprep\"\n   algorithm [StringPrep].  This profile is intended for\
    \ use in\n   preparing strings representing simple user names and passwords.\n\
    \   This profile uses Unicode 3.2 [Unicode].\n   Character names in this document\
    \ use the notation for code points and\n   names from the Unicode Standard [Unicode].\
    \  For example, the letter\n   \"a\" may be represented as either <U+0061> or\
    \ <LATIN SMALL LETTER A>.\n   In the lists of mappings and the prohibited characters,\
    \ the \"U+\" is\n   left off to make the lists easier to read.  The comments for\n\
    \   character ranges are shown in square brackets (such as \"[CONTROL\n   CHARACTERS]\"\
    ) and do not come from the standard.\n   Note: A glossary of terms used in Unicode\
    \ can be found in [Glossary].\n   Information on the Unicode character encoding\
    \ model can be found in\n   [CharModel].\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This profile is intended to prepare simple user\
    \ name and password\n   strings for comparison or use in cryptographic functions\
    \ (e.g.,\n   message digests).  The preparation algorithm was specifically\n \
    \  designed such that its output is canonical, and it is well-formed.\n   However,\
    \ due to an anomaly [PR29] in the specification of Unicode\n   normalization,\
    \ canonical equivalence is not guaranteed for a select\n   few character sequences.\
    \  These sequences, however, do not appear in\n   well-formed text.  This specification\
    \ was published despite this\n   known technical problem.  It is expected that\
    \ this specification will\n   be revised before further progression on the Standards\
    \ Track (after\n   [Unicode] and/or [StringPrep] specifications have been updated\
    \ to\n   address this problem).\n   It is not intended for preparing identity\
    \ strings that are not simple\n   user names (e.g., distinguished names, domain\
    \ names), nor is the\n   profile intended for use of simple user names that require\
    \ different\n   handling (such as case folding).  Protocols (or applications of\
    \ those\n   protocols) that have application-specific identity forms and/or\n\
    \   comparison algorithms should use mechanisms specifically designed for\n  \
    \ these forms and algorithms.\n   Application of string preparation may have an\
    \ impact upon the\n   feasibility of brute force and dictionary attacks.  While\
    \ the number\n   of possible prepared strings is less than the number of possible\n\
    \   Unicode strings, the number of usable names and passwords is greater\n   than\
    \ as if only ASCII was used.  Though SASLprep eliminates some\n   Unicode code\
    \ point sequences as possible prepared strings, that\n   elimination generally\
    \ makes the (canonical) output forms practicable\n   and prohibits nonsensical\
    \ inputs.\n   User names and passwords should be protected from eavesdropping.\n\
    \   General \"stringprep\" and Unicode security considerations apply.  Both\n\
    \   are discussed in [StringPrep].\n"
