  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   To date, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has used a\n
    \  Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) profile which always\n   required
    at least one complete round trip for an authentication, as\n   it did not support
    an initial client response argument.  This\n   additional round trip at the beginning
    of the session is undesirable,\n   especially when round-trip costs are high.\n
    \  This document defines an extension to IMAP which allows clients and\n   servers
    to avoid this round trip by allowing an initial client\n   response argument to
    the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SASL initial client response extension is present in
    any IMAP\n   [RFC3501] server implementation which returns \"SASL-IR\" as one
    of the\n   supported capabilities in its CAPABILITY response.\n   Servers which
    support this extension will accept an optional initial\n   client response with
    the AUTHENTICATE command for any SASL [RFC4422]\n   mechanisms which support it.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client
    and\n   server, respectively.\n   Formal syntax is defined by [RFC4234] as extended
    by [RFC3501].\n"
  title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
- contents:
  - "3.  IMAP Changes to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE Command\n   This extension adds an
    optional second argument to the AUTHENTICATE\n   command that is defined in Section
    6.2.2 of [RFC3501].  If this\n   second argument is present, it represents the
    contents of the\n   \"initial client response\" defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC4422].\n
    \  As with any other client response, this initial client response MUST\n   be
    encoded as defined in Section 4 of [RFC4648].  It also MUST be\n   transmitted
    outside of a quoted string or literal.  To send a zero-\n   length initial response,
    the client MUST send a single pad character\n   (\"=\").  This indicates that
    the response is present, but is a zero-\n   length string.\n   When decoding the
    BASE64 [RFC4648] data in the initial client\n   response, decoding errors MUST
    be treated as IMAP [RFC3501] would\n   handle them in any normal SASL client response.
    \ In particular, the\n   server should check for any characters not explicitly
    allowed by the\n   BASE64 alphabet, as well as any sequence of BASE64 characters
    that\n   contains the pad character ('=') anywhere other than the end of the\n
    \  string (e.g., \"=AAA\" and \"AAA=BBB\" are not allowed).\n   If the client
    uses an initial response with a SASL mechanism that\n   does not support an initial
    response, the server MUST reject the\n   command with a tagged BAD response.\n
    \  Note: support and use of the initial client response is optional for\n   both
    clients and servers.  Servers that implement this extension MUST\n   support clients
    that omit the initial client response, and clients\n   that implement this extension
    MUST NOT send an initial client\n   response to servers that do not advertise
    the SASL-IR capability.  In\n   such a situation, clients MUST fall back to an
    IMAP [RFC3501]\n   compatible mode.\n   If either the client or the server do
    not support the SASL-IR\n   capability, a mechanism which uses an initial client
    response is\n   negotiated using the challenge/response exchange described in\n
    \  [RFC3501], with an initial zero-length server challenge.\n"

  - "4.  Examples\n   The following is an example authentication using the PLAIN (see\n
    \  [RFC4616]) SASL mechanism (under a TLS protection layer, see\n   [RFC4346])
    and an initial client response:\n            ... client connects to server and
    negotiates a TLS\n           protection layer ...\n        C: C01 CAPABILITY\n
    \       S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN\n        S: C01 OK Completed\n
    \       C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=\n        S: A01 OK Success
    (tls protection)\n   Note that even when a server supports this extension, the
    following\n   negotiation (which does not use the initial response) is still valid\n
    \  and MUST be supported by the server:\n            ... client connects to server
    and negotiates a TLS\n           protection layer ...\n        C: C01 CAPABILITY\n
    \       S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN\n        S: C01 OK Completed\n
    \       C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN\n            (note that there is a space following
    the \"+\" in the\n           following line)\n        S: +\n        C: dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=\n
    \       S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)\n   The following is an example authentication
    using the SASL EXTERNAL\n   mechanism (defined in [RFC4422]) under a TLS protection
    layer (see\n   [RFC4346]) and an empty initial client response:\n            ...
    client connects to server and negotiates a TLS\n           protection layer ...\n
    \       C: C01 CAPABILITY\n        S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
    AUTH=EXTERNAL\n        S: C01 OK Completed\n        C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL
    =\n        S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)\n   This is in contrast with the
    handling of such a situation when an\n   initial response is omitted:\n         ...
    client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection\n           layer ...\n
    \       C: C01 CAPABILITY\n        S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
    AUTH=EXTERNAL\n        S: C01 OK Completed\n        C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL\n
    \           (note that there is a space following the \"+\" in the\n           following
    line)\n        S: +\n        C:\n        S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The extension defined in this document is subject
    to many of the\n   Security Considerations defined in [RFC3501] and [RFC4422].\n
    \  Server implementations MUST treat the omission of an initial client\n   response
    from the AUTHENTICATE command as defined by [RFC3501] (as if\n   this extension
    did not exist).\n   Although [RFC3501] has no express line length limitations,
    some\n   implementations choose to enforce them anyway.  Such implementations\n
    \  MUST be aware that the addition of the initial response parameter to\n   AUTHENTICATE
    may increase the maximum line length that IMAP parsers\n   may expect to support.
    \ Server implementations MUST be able to\n   receive the largest possible initial
    client response that their\n   supported mechanisms might receive.\n"
