- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes considerations for mailing lists\
    \ with the\n   introduction of internationalized email addresses [RFC5335].\n\
    \   Mailing lists are an important part of email usage and collaborative\n   communications.\
    \  The introduction of internationalized email\n   addresses affects mailing lists\
    \ in three main areas: (1) transport\n   (receiving and sending messages), (2)\
    \ message headers of received and\n   retransmitted messages, and (3) mailing\
    \ list operational policies.\n   A mailing list is a mechanism whereby a message\
    \ may be distributed to\n   multiple recipients by sending to one address.  An\
    \ agent (typically\n   not a human being) at that single address receives the\
    \ message and\n   then causes the message to be redistributed to a list of recipients.\n\
    \   This agent sets the envelope return address of the redistributed\n   message\
    \ to a different address from that of the original message.\n   Using a different\
    \ envelope return address (reverse-path) directs\n   error (and other automatically\
    \ generated) messages to an error\n   handling address associated with the mailing\
    \ list. (This avoids\n   having error and other automatic messages go to the original\
    \ sender,\n   who typically doesn't control the list and hence can't do anything\n\
    \   about them.)\n   In most cases, the mailing list agent redistributes a received\n\
    \   message to its subscribers as a new message, that is, conceptually it\n  \
    \ uses message submission [submission] (as did the sender of the\n   original\
    \ message).  The exception, where the mailing list is not a\n   separate agent\
    \ that receives and redistributes messages in separate\n   transactions, but is\
    \ instead an expansion step within an SMTP\n   transaction where one local address\
    \ expands to multiple local or non-\n   local addresses, is out of scope for this\
    \ document.\n   Some mailing lists alter message header fields, while others do\
    \ not.\n   A number of standardized list-related header fields have been\n   defined,\
    \ and many lists add one or more of these header fields.\n   Separate from these\
    \ standardized list-specific header fields, and\n   despite a history of interoperability\
    \ problems from doing so, some\n   lists alter or add header fields in an attempt\
    \ to control where\n   replies are sent.  Such lists typically add or replace\
    \ the \"Reply-To\"\n   field and some add or replace the \"Sender\" field.  Poorly\
    \ behaved\n   lists may alter or replace other fields, including \"From\".\n \
    \  Among these list-specific header fields are those specified in RFC\n   2369\
    \ (\"The Use of URLs as Meta-Syntax for Core Mail List Commands and\n   their\
    \ Transport through Message Header Fields\") [List-*] and RFC 2919\n   (\"List-Id:\
    \  A Structured Field and Namespace for the Identification\n   of Mailing Lists\"\
    ) [List-ID].  For more information, see Section 5.\n   While the mail transport\
    \ protocol does not differ between regular\n   email recipients and mailing list\
    \ recipients, lists have special\n   considerations with internationalized email\
    \ addresses because they\n   retransmit messages composed by other agents to potentially\
    \ many\n   recipients.\n   There are considerations for internationalized email\
    \ addresses in the\n   envelope as well as in header fields of redistributed messages.\
    \  In\n   particular, an internationalized message cannot be downgraded unless\n\
    \   all envelope addresses are available in ASCII (that is, each address\n   either\
    \ is ASCII or has an alt-address [UTF8SMTP]).\n   With mailing lists, there are\
    \ two different types of considerations:\n   first, the purely technical ones\
    \ involving message handling, error\n   cases, downgrades, and the like; and second,\
    \ those that arise from\n   the fact that humans use mailing lists to communicate.\
    \  As an example\n   of the first, mailing lists might choose to reject all messages\
    \ from\n   internationalized addresses that lack an alt-address, or even all\n\
    \   internationalized messages that cannot be downgraded.  As an example\n   of\
    \ the second, a user who sends a message to a list often is unaware\n   of the\
    \ list membership.  In particular, the user often doesn't know\n   if the members\
    \ are UTF-8 mail users or not, and often neither the\n   original sender nor the\
    \ recipients personally know each other.  As a\n   consequence of this, remedies\
    \ that may be readily available for a\n   missed email in one-to-one communications\
    \ might not be appropriate\n   when dealing with mailing lists.  For example,\
    \ if a user sends a\n   message that is undeliverable, normally the telephone,\
    \ instant\n   messaging, or other forms of communication are available to obtain\
    \ a\n   working address.  With mailing lists, the users may not have any\n   recourse.\
    \  Of course, with mailing lists, the original sender usually\n   does not know\
    \ if the message was successfully received by any list\n   members or if it was\
    \ undeliverable to some.\n   Conceptually, a mailing list's internationalization\
    \ can be divided\n   into three capabilities:  First, does it have a UTF-8 submission\
    \ or\n   return-path address?  Second, does it accept subscriptions to UTF-8\n\
    \   addresses?  And third, does it accept [UTF8SMTP] messages?  This is\n   explored\
    \ in Section 4.\n   A brief discussion on a few additional considerations for\
    \ mailing\n   list operation is in Section 6.\n"

- title: 3.  Scenarios Involving Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "3.  Scenarios Involving Mailing Lists\n   Generally (and exclusively within the\
    \ scope of this document), an\n   original message is sent to a mailing list as\
    \ a completely separate\n   and independent transaction from the mailing list\
    \ agent sending the\n   retransmitted message to one or more list recipients.\
    \  In both cases,\n   the message might have only one recipient, or might have\
    \ multiple\n   recipients.  That is, the original message might be sent to\n \
    \  additional recipients as well as the mailing list agent, and the\n   mailing\
    \ list might choose to send the retransmitted message to each\n   list recipient\
    \ in a separate message submission [submission]\n   transaction, or it might choose\
    \ to include multiple recipients per\n   transaction. (Often, mailing lists are\
    \ constructed to work in\n   cooperation with, rather than include the functionality\
    \ of, a message\n   submission server [submission], and hence the list transmits\
    \ to a\n   single submission server one copy of the retransmitted message, with\n\
    \   all list recipients specified in the SMTP envelope.  The submission\n   server\
    \ then decides which recipients to include in which\n   transaction.)\n   The\
    \ retransmitted message sent by the mailing list to its subscribers\n   might\
    \ need to be downgraded [EAI-Downgrade].  In order for a\n   downgrade to be possible,\
    \ the return path set by the mailing list\n   agent must be an ASCII address or\
    \ have an alt-address [UTF8SMTP]\n   specified.  In addition, the recipient addresses\
    \ need to have ASCII\n   addresses available.  It may be advisable for mailing\
    \ list operators\n   to pre-obtain an alt-address for all its internationalized\
    \ member\n   addresses.\n   In the case where a member or non-member with an internationalized\n\
    \   email address is sending to a mailing list, no alt-address [UTF8SMTP]\n  \
    \ is specified, and a downgrade is required, the message cannot be\n   delivered.\
    \  To protect against this, a UTF8SMTP-aware [UTF8SMTP]\n   mailing list might\
    \ prefer to reject submissions from\n   internationalized email addresses that\
    \ lack an alt-address.\n   (Note that this situation is not unique to mailing\
    \ lists.  Mail\n   relays that are UTF8SMTP-aware will potentially encounter the\
    \ same\n   situation.) Further discussions are included in Section 6 of this\n\
    \   document.\n"
- title: 4.  Capabilities and Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Capabilities and Requirements\n   There are three primary internationalization\
    \ capabilities of mailing\n   lists:  First, does it have a UTF-8 submission or\
    \ return-path\n   address?  Second, does it allow subscriptions from UTF-8 addresses?\n\
    \   And third, does it accept [UTF8SMTP] messages?\n   In theory, any list can\
    \ support any combination of these.  In\n   practice, only some offer any benefit.\
    \  For example, neither allowing\n   UTF-8 addresses to subscribe, nor accepting\
    \ UTF8SMTP messages, makes\n   much sense without the other (an all-ASCII address\
    \ might or might not\n   be capable of receiving UTF8SMTP messages, but a UTF-8\
    \ address of\n   necessity needs to accept UTF8SMTP messages).  Likewise, there\
    \ is no\n   real benefit to a list in using a UTF-8 submission address unless\
    \ it\n   also accepts UTF8SMTP messages and permits UTF-8 addresses to\n   subscribe.\n\
    \   However, requirements for lists can be discussed separately for each\n   of\
    \ the three capabilities.\n   1. If the list uses a UTF-8 submission or return-path\
    \ address, it\n      SHOULD specify an alt-address [UTF8SMTP] for it.  Clearly,\
    \ it\n      needs to sit behind a UTF8SMTP-enabled final-delivery SMTP server\n\
    \      [UTF8SMTP] and delivery agent.  Likewise, if a list uses a UTF-8\n    \
    \  return-path address, then its Message Submission Agent (MSA)\n      [submission]\
    \ needs to support UTF8SMTP.\n      The list's return-path address is usually\
    \ separate from its\n      submission address (so that delivery reports and other\n\
    \      automatically generated messages are not sent to the submission\n     \
    \ address).  For reliability in receiving delivery status\n      notifications,\
    \ a list MAY choose to use an all-ASCII return path\n      even if it uses a UTF-8\
    \ submission address.  If the list does use\n      a UTF-8 return path, it MUST\
    \ specify an alt-address [UTF8SMTP] (or\n      else there is a high risk of being\
    \ unable to receive non-delivery\n      reports).\n      There are also implications\
    \ for the List-* header fields (see\n      below).\n   2. If it allows UTF-8 addresses\
    \ to subscribe, it MAY require an alt-\n      address [UTF8SMTP] to be specified\
    \ for each UTF-8 subscriber.\n      Naturally, if it permits UTF-8 addresses to\
    \ subscribe, it needs a\n      mechanism to accept subscription requests from\
    \ such addresses\n      (preferably specified in the form <utf8@utf8 <ascii@ascii>>).\
    \  In\n      order to send email to its subscribers who have UTF-8 addresses,\n\
    \      its MSA needs to support [UTF8SMTP].\n   3. If it accepts UTF8SMTP messages,\
    \ the Message Transfer Agents\n      (MTAs) and Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) in its\
    \ inbound path need to\n      support UTF8SMTP.\n"
- title: 5.  List Header Fields
  contents:
  - "5.  List Header Fields\n   A number of header fields, specifically for mailing\
    \ lists, have been\n   introduced in RFCs 2369 and 2919.  For example, these include:\n\
    \   List-Id: List Header Mailing List <list-header.example.com>\n   List-Help:\
    \ <mailto:list@example.com?subject=help>\n   List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:list@example.com?subject=unsubscribe>\n\
    \   List-Subscribe: <mailto:list@example.com?subject=subscribe>\n   List-Post:\
    \ <mailto:list@example.com>\n   List-Owner: <mailto:listmom@example.com> (Contact\
    \ Person for Help)\n   List-Archive: <mailto:archive@example.com?subject=index%20list>\n\
    \   As described in RFC 2369, \"The contents of the list header fields\n   mostly\
    \ consist of angle-bracket ('<', '>') enclosed URLs, with\n   internal whitespace\
    \ being ignored\" [List-*].  For List-ID, RFC 2919\n   specifies that, \"The list\
    \ identifier will, in most cases, appear like\n   a host name in a domain of the\
    \ list owner\" [List-ID].\n   Except for the List-ID header field, these mailing\
    \ list header fields\n   contain URLs [RFC3986].  The most common schemes are\
    \ generally HTTP,\n   HTTPS, mailto, and FTP.  Schemes that permit both URI and\n\
    \   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [IRI] forms should use\n   the\
    \ URI-encoded form described in [IRI].  Future work may extend\n   these header\
    \ fields or define replacements to directly support non-\n   encoded UTF-8 in\
    \ IRIs (for example, [mailto-bis]), but in the absence\n   of such extension or\
    \ replacement, non-ASCII characters can only\n   appear within when encoded as\
    \ ASCII.  Note that discussion on whether\n   internationalized domain names should\
    \ be percent encoded or puny\n   coded is ongoing; see [IRI-bis].\n   Even without\
    \ these header fields being extended to support UTF-8,\n   some special provisions\
    \ may be helpful when downgrading.  In\n   particular, if a List-* header field\
    \ contains a UTF-8 mailto (even\n   encoded in ASCII) followed by an ASCII mailto,\
    \ it may be advisable\n   not only to copy and preserve the original header field\
    \ as usual\n   (ENCAPSULATION method of [EAI-Downgrade]), but also to edit the\n\
    \   header field to remove the UTF-8 address.  Otherwise, a client might\n   run\
    \ into trouble if the decoded mailto results in a non-ASCII\n   address.\n   When\
    \ mailing lists use a UTF-8 form of a List-* header field, an\n   ASCII form SHOULD\
    \ also be used.  These header fields are vital to\n   good operations and use\
    \ of mailing lists; caution is called for when\n   considering how to form and\
    \ use these header fields in a non-ASCII\n   environment.\n   The most commonly\
    \ used URI schemes in List-* header fields tend to be\n   HTTP and mailto.  The\
    \ current specification for mailto does not\n   permit unencoded UTF-8 characters,\
    \ although work has been proposed to\n   extend or more likely replace mailto\
    \ in order to permit this.  For\n   mailto URIs, a separate consideration is how\
    \ to include an alternate\n   ASCII address (alt-address) [UTF8SMTP] for a UTF-8\
    \ address.  Note\n   that the existing ability to specify multiple URLs within\
    \ each List-*\n   header field provides one solution.\n   [List-*] says:\n   \
    \   A list of multiple, alternate, URLs MAY be specified by a comma-\n      separated\
    \ list of angle-bracket enclosed URLs.  The URLs have\n      order of preference\
    \ from left to right.  The client application\n      should use the left most\
    \ protocol that it supports, or knows how\n      to access by a separate application.\n\
    \   When a UTF-8 mailto is used in a List-* header field, an alt-address\n   [UTF8SMTP],\
    \ if available, SHOULD be supplied.\n   The List-ID header field provides an opaque\
    \ value that uniquely\n   identifies a list.  The intent is that the value of\
    \ this header field\n   remain constant, even if the machine or system used to\
    \ operate or\n   host the list changes.  This header field is often used in various\n\
    \   filters and tests, such as client-side filters, Sieve filters, and so\n  \
    \ forth.  Such filters and tests may not properly compare a non-ASCII\n   value\
    \ that has been encoded into ASCII.  In addition to these\n   comparison considerations,\
    \ it is generally desirable that this header\n   field contain something meaningful\
    \ that users can type in.  However,\n   ASCII encodings of non-ASCII characters\
    \ are unlikely to be meaningful\n   to users or easy for them to accurately type.\n"
- title: 6.  Further Discussion
  contents:
  - "6.  Further Discussion\n   While mailing lists do not create a significant additional\
    \ burden to\n   the deployment of internationalized email address functionalities,\n\
    \   there are some specific areas that need to be considered when the\n   operator\
    \ of a mailing list or of a final delivery MTA that serves a\n   mailing list\
    \ upgrades to internationalized mail.\n   Mailing lists face additional complexity\
    \ since they redistribute\n   messages composed by other agents.  Hence, they\
    \ may be asked to\n   accept a message with non-ASCII header fields composed by\
    \ a UTF8SMTP-\n   aware user agent [UTF8SMTP] and redistribute it to UTF-8 mail\
    \ and\n   all-ASCII mail users via systems that are not UTF8SMTP-aware.\n   1.\
    \ Obtaining Downgrade Information -- for a mailing list, or mail\n      relay\
    \ server for that matter, which is UTF8SMTP-aware, receiving\n      mail from\
    \ an internationalized email address, the alt-address\n      [UTF8SMTP] is not\
    \ required from the sending MTA for the transport\n      to be complete.  When\
    \ the mailing list then retransmits the\n      message to its subscribers, it\
    \ may encounter paths where a\n      downgrade is needed (if a relay or final\
    \ MSA does not supports\n      UTF8SMTP).  In order to mitigate this situation,\
    \ the mailing list\n      might perhaps decide to reject all incoming mail from\
    \ an\n      internationalized email address that lacks an alt-address.\n     \
    \ However, note that in general, downgrades are not expected to be\n      the\
    \ normal case.\n   2. Downgrading Considerations for mailto URLs -- UTF-8 addresses\
    \ in\n      mailto links in List-* header fields will be easier to downgrade\n\
    \      if they contain an alt-address [UTF8SMTP].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Because use of both a UTF-8 address and an alt-address\
    \ for the same\n   entity introduces a potential ambiguity regarding the identity\
    \ of\n   list subscribers and message senders, implementers are advised to\n \
    \  carefully handle authorization decisions regarding subscriptions,\n   sender\
    \ filters, and other common list administration features.  For\n   example, a\
    \ binding between a UTF-8 address and an ASCII alt-address\n   can be used by\
    \ an attacker to deny another person admission to an\n   Email Address Internationalization\
    \ (EAI) mailing list.\n   Other relevant security considerations are discussed\
    \ in the Framework\n   document [EAI-Framework].\n"
