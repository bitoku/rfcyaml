Abstract This specification extends the Internet Message Access Protocol version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) to support UTF 8 encoded international characters in user names, mail addresses, and message headers.
This specification extends IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] to permit UTF 8 [RFC3629] in headers as described in "Internationalized Email Headers" [RFC5335].
It also adds a mechanism to support mailbox names, login names, and passwords using the UTF 8 charset.
This specification creates five new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to advertise these new extensions, along with two new IMAP LIST selection options and a new IMAP LIST return option.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].
The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF)
[RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].
In addition, rules from IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501], UTF 8 [RFC3629], "Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF" [RFC4466], and IMAP4
LIST Command Extensions [RFC5258] are also referenced.
In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server, respectively.
If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol exchange.
The "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability indicates that the server supports UTF 8 quoted strings, the "UTF8" parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE, and UTF 8 responses from the LIST and LSUB commands.
A client MUST use the "ENABLE UTF8 ACCEPT" command (defined in [RFC5161]) to indicate to the server that the client accepts UTF 8 quoted strings.
The "ENABLE UTF8 ACCEPT" command MUST only be used in the authenticated state.
(Note that the "UTF8 ONLY" capability described in Section 7 and the "UTF8 ALL" capability described in Section 6 imply the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability.
See additional information in these sections.)
The IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] base specification forbids the use of 8 bit characters in atoms or quoted strings.
Thus, a UTF 8 string can only be sent as a literal.
This can be inconvenient from a coding standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP4 non synchronizing literals [RFC2088], this requires an extra round trip for each UTF 8 string sent by the client.
" " DQUOTE  UQUOTED CHAR DQUOTE UQUOTED CHAR    QUOTED CHAR / UTF8 2
/ UTF8 3 / UTF8 4 ; UTF8 2, UTF8 3, and UTF8 4 are as defined in RFC 3629
The IMAP server MUST NOT send utf8 quoted syntax to the client unless the client has indicated support for that syntax by using the "ENABLE UTF8 ACCEPT" command.
If the server advertises the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability, the client MAY use utf8 quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string (including astring and nstring).
However, if characters outside the US ASCII repertoire are used in an inappropriate place, the results would be the same as if other syntactically valid but semantically invalid characters were used.
For example, if the client includes UTF 8 characters in the user or password arguments (and the server has not advertised "UTF8 USER"), the LOGIN command will fail as it would with any other invalid user name or password.
Specific cases where UTF 8 characters are permitted or not permitted are described in the following paragraphs.
All IMAP servers that advertise the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability SHOULD accept UTF 8 in mailbox names, and those that also support the "Mailbox International Naming Convention" described in RFC 3501, Section 5.1.3 MUST accept utf8 quoted mailbox names and convert them to the appropriate internal format.
Mailbox names MUST comply with the Net Unicode Definition (Section 2 of [RFC5198]) with the specific exception that they MUST NOT contain control characters (0000 001F, 0080 009F), delete (007F), line separator (2028), or paragraph separator (2029).
An IMAP client MUST NOT issue a SEARCH command that uses a mixture of utf8 quoted syntax and a SEARCH CHARSET other than UTF 8.
If an IMAP server receives such a SEARCH command, it SHOULD reject the command with a BAD response (due to the conflicting charset labels).
UTF8 Parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE The "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability also indicates that the server supports the "UTF8" parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE.
When a mailbox is selected with the "UTF8" parameter, it alters the behavior of all IMAP commands related to message sizes, message headers, and MIME body headers
so they refer to the message with UTF 8 headers.
If the mailstore is not UTF 8 header native and the SELECT or EXAMINE command with UTF
8 header modifier succeeds, then the server MUST return results as if the mailstore were UTF 8 header native with upconversion requirements as described in Section 8.
The server MAY reject the SELECT or EXAMINE command with the [NOT UTF 8] response code, unless the "UTF8 ALL" or "UTF8 ONLY" capability is advertised.
Servers MAY include mailboxes that can only be selected or examined if the "UTF8" parameter is provided.
However, such mailboxes MUST NOT be included in the output of an unextended LIST, LSUB, or equivalent command.
If a client attempts to SELECT or EXAMINE such mailboxes without the "UTF8" parameter, the server MUST reject the command with a [UTF 8 ONLY] response code.
As a result, such mailboxes will not be accessible by IMAP clients written prior to this specification and are discouraged unless the server advertises "UTF8 ONLY" or the server implements IMAP4
a OK SELECT completed C: b FETCH 1 (SIZE ENVELOPE BODY)
UTF 8 header native results
> S: b OK FETCH completed C: c EXAMINE legacymailbox
[NOT UTF 8] Mailbox does not support UTF 8 access C:
SELECT funky new mailbox S:
NO [UTF 8 ONLY] Mailbox requires UTF 8 client 3.3.
UTF 8 LIST and LSUB Responses
After an IMAP client successfully issues an "ENABLE UTF8 ACCEPT" command, the server MUST NOT return in LIST
results any mailbox names to the client following the IMAP4 Mailbox International Naming Convention.
Instead, the server MUST return any mailbox names with characters outside the US ASCII repertoire using utf8 quoted syntax.
(The IMAP4 Mailbox International Naming Convention has proved problematic in the past, so the desire is to make this syntax obsolete as quickly as possible.)
UTF 8 Interaction with IMAP4
When an IMAP server advertises both the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability and the "LIST EXTENDED" [RFC5258] capability, the server MUST support the LIST extensions described in this section.
UTF8 and UTF8ONLY LIST Selection Options
The "UTF8" LIST selection option tells the server to include mailboxes that only support UTF 8 headers in the output of the list command.
The "UTF8ONLY" LIST selection option tells the server to include all mailboxes that support UTF 8 headers and to exclude mailboxes that don't support UTF 8 headers.
Note that "UTF8ONLY" implies "UTF8"
, so it is not necessary for the client to request both.
Use of either selection option will also result in UTF 8 mailbox names in the result as described in Section 3.3 and implies the "UTF8" List return option described in Section 3.4.2.
If the client supplies the "UTF8" LIST return option, then the server MUST include either the "\NoUTF8" or the "\UTF8Only" mailbox attribute as appropriate.
The "\NoUTF8" mailbox attribute indicates that an attempt to SELECT or EXAMINE that mailbox with the "UTF8" parameter will fail with a [NOT UTF 8] response code.
The "\UTF8Only" mailbox attribute indicates that an attempt to SELECT or EXAMINE that mailbox without the "UTF8" parameter will fail with a [UTF 8 ONLY] response code.
Note that computing this information may be expensive on some server implementations
, so this return option should not be used unless necessary.
The ABNF [RFC5234] for these LIST extensions follows:
If the "UTF8 APPEND" capability is advertised, then the server accepts UTF 8 headers in the APPEND command message argument.
A client that sends a message with UTF 8 headers to the server MUST send them using the "UTF8" APPEND data extension.
If the server also advertises the CATENATE capability (as specified in [RFC4469]), the client can use the same data extension to include such a message in a CATENATE message part.
The ABNF for the APPEND data extension and CATENATE extension follows:
Mechanisms for 7 bit downgrading to help comply with the standards are discussed in Downgrading mechanism for Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) [RFC5504].
IMAP servers that do not advertise the "UTF8 APPEND" or "UTF8 ONLY" capability SHOULD reject an APPEND command that includes any 8 bit in the message headers with a "NO" response.
Note that the "UTF8 ONLY" capability described in Section 7 implies the "UTF8 APPEND" capability.
See additional information in that section.
If the "UTF8 USER" capability is advertised, that indicates the server accepts UTF 8 user names and passwords and applies SASLprep [RFC4013] to both arguments of the LOGIN command.
The server MUST reject UTF 8 that fails to comply with the formal syntax in RFC 3629 [RFC3629]
or if it encounters Unicode characters listed in Section 2.3 of SASLprep RFC 4013
The "UTF8 ALL" capability indicates all server mailboxes support UTF 8 headers.
Specifically, SELECT and EXAMINE with the "UTF8" parameter will never fail with a [NOT UTF 8] response code.
Note that the "UTF8 ONLY" capability described in Section 7 implies the "UTF8 ALL" capability.
See additional information in that section.
Note that the "UTF8 ALL" capability implies the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability.
The "UTF8 ONLY" capability permits an IMAP server to advertise that it does not support the international mailbox name convention (modified UTF 7), and does not permit selection or examination of any mailbox unless the "UTF8" parameter is provided.
As this is an incompatible change to IMAP, a clear warning is necessary.
IMAP clients that find implementation of the "UTF8 ONLY" capability problematic are encouraged to at least detect the "UTF8 ONLY" capability and provide an informative error message to the end user.
When an IMAP mailbox internally uses UTF 8 header native storage, the down conversion step is necessary to permit selection or examination of the mailbox in a backwards compatible fashion will become more difficult to support.
Although it is hoped that deployed IMAP servers will not advertise "UTF8 ONLY" for some years, this capability is intended to minimize the disruption when legacy support finally goes away.
The "UTF8 ONLY" capability implies the "UTF8 ACCEPT" capability, the "UTF8 ALL" capability, and the "UTF8 APPEND" capability.
A server that advertises "UTF8 ONLY" need not advertise the three implicit capabilities.
8.  Up Conversion Server Requirements
When an IMAP4 server uses a traditional mailbox format that includes 7 bit headers and it chooses to permit access to that mailbox with the "UTF8" parameter, it MUST support minimal up conversion as described in this section.
The server MUST support up conversion of the following address header fields in the message header: From, Sender, To, CC, Bcc, Resent From, Resent Sender, Resent To, Resent CC, Resent Bcc, and Reply To.
This up conversion MUST include address local parts in fields downgraded according to [RFC5504], address domains encoded according to Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) [RFC3490], and MIME header encoding [RFC2047] of display names and any [RFC5322] comments.
The following charsets MUST be supported for up conversion of MIME header encoding [RFC2047]:
UTF 8, US ASCII, ISO 8859 1, ISO 8859 2, ISO 8859 3, ISO 8859 4, ISO 8859 5, ISO 8859 6, ISO 8859 7, ISO 8859 8, ISO 8859 9, ISO 8859 10, ISO 8859 14, and ISO 8859 15.
If the server supports other charsets in IMAP SEARCH or IMAP CONVERT [RFC5259], it SHOULD also support those charsets in this conversion.
Up conversion of MIME header encoding of the following headers MUST also be implemented: Subject, Date ([RFC5322] comments only), Comments, Keywords, and Content Description.
Server implementations also SHOULD up convert all MIME body headers [RFC2045],
SHOULD up convert or remove the deprecated (and misused)
"name" parameter [RFC1341] on Content Type, and MUST up convert the Content Disposition [
RFC2183] "filename" parameter, except when any of these are contained within a multipart/signed MIME body part (see below).
These parameters can be encoded using the standard MIME parameter encoding [RFC2231] mechanism, or via non standard use of MIME header encoding [RFC2047] in quoted strings.
The IMAP server MUST NOT perform up conversion of headers and content of multipart/signed, as well as Original Recipient and Return Path.
Issues with UTF 8 Header Mailstore
When an IMAP server uses a mailbox format that supports UTF 8 headers and it permits selection or examination of that mailbox without the "UTF8" parameter, it is the responsibility of the server to comply with the IMAP4rev1 base specification [RFC3501] and [RFC5322] with respect to all header information transmitted over the wire.
Mechanisms for 7 bit downgrading to help comply with the standards are discussed in "Downgrading Mechanism for Email Address Internationalization" [RFC5504].
An IMAP server with a mailbox that supports UTF 8 headers MUST comply with the protocol requirements implicit from Section 8.
However, the code necessary for such compliance need not be part of the IMAP server itself in this case.
For example, the minimal required up  conversion
could be performed when a message is inserted into the IMAP accessible mailbox.
This adds five new capabilities ("UTF8 ACCEPT", "UTF8 USER", "UTF8 APPEND", "UTF8 ALL", and "UTF8 ONLY") to the IMAP4rev1 Capabilities registry [RFC3501].
This adds two new IMAP4 list selection options and one new IMAP4 list return option.

The security considerations of UTF 8 [RFC3629] and SASLprep [RFC4013] apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of UTF 8 in user names and passwords.
Otherwise, this is not believed to alter the security considerations of IMAP4rev1.
This non normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the design choices in the above specification.
The basic approach of advertising the ability to access a mailbox in UTF 8 mode is intended to permit graceful upgrade, including servers that support multiple mailbox formats.
In particular, it would be undesirable to force conversion of an entire server mailstore to UTF 8 headers, so being able to phase in support for new mailboxes and gradually migrate old mailboxes is permitted by this design.
UTF8 USER" is optional because many identity systems are US ASCII only, so it's helpful to inform the client up front that UTF 8 won't work. "
UTF8 APPEND" is optional because it effectively requires IMAP server support for down conversion, which is a much more complex operation than up conversion.
The "UTF8 ONLY" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability problems when legacy support goes away.
In the situation where backwards compatibility is broken anyway, just send UTF 8 IMAP has the advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.
However, the difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a just send UTF 8 IMAP mechanism is the reason the "UTF8 ONLY" capability mechanism was chosen.
The up conversion requirements are designed to balance the desire to deprecate and eventually eliminate complicated encodings (like MIME header encodings) without creating a significant deployment burden for servers.
As IMAP4 servers already require a MIME parser, this includes additional server up conversion requirements not present in POP3 Support for UTF 8 [RFC5721].
The set of mandatory charsets comes from two sources: MIME requirements [RFC2049] and IETF Policy on Character Sets [RFC2277].
Including a requirement to up convert widely deployed encoded ideographic charsets to UTF 8 would be reasonable for most scenarios, but may require unacceptable table sizes for some embedded devices.
The open ended recommendation to support widely deployed charsets avoids the political ramifications of attempting to list such charsets.
The authors believe market forces, existing open source software, and public conversion tables are sufficient to deploy the appropriate charsets.
