- title: 1.1.  About Frogans
  contents:
  - "1.1.  About Frogans\n   Frogans is a medium for publishing content and services\
    \ on the\n   Internet.  From its inception in 1999, the medium was designed as\
    \ a\n   generic software layer running on top of the original Internet\n   infrastructure\
    \ (i.e., the TCP and IP protocols and the Domain Name\n   System (DNS)), alongside\
    \ other existing layers such as E-mail or the\n   World Wide Web.\n   As a medium,\
    \ Frogans is not meant for publishing Web sites, but\n   Frogans sites, a kind\
    \ of site founded upon a different format,\n   enabling a different kind of communication\
    \ between end users and\n   publishers of content and services.\n   Frogans is\
    \ intended to be complementary to the World Wide Web; it is\n   not intended to\
    \ be a replacement.  This is analogous to instant\n   messaging, which was not\
    \ intended to and did not replace E-mail.\n   Compared to the World Wide Web,\
    \ Frogans suggests publishing content\n   and services that involve visual rather\
    \ than text-based\n   communication, focused content rather than long pages, and\
    \ natural\n   interaction rather than complex user interfaces.  For further\n\
    \   information on the reasons for introducing Frogans on the Internet,\n   and\
    \ for an in-depth discussion of the similarities and differences\n   between Frogans\
    \ sites and Web sites, see [FSDL], Section 1.4\n   (\"Frogans sites and Web sites\"\
    ).\n   The technology making up the medium, i.e., the Frogans technology,\n  \
    \ includes multiple components such as:\n   o  An XML-based language, called Frogans\
    \ Slide Description Language\n      [FSDL], used to develop Frogans sites.\n \
    \  o  International identifiers, called Frogans addresses [IFAP], used\n     \
    \ to access Frogans sites.  Each Frogans site has its own Frogans\n      address.\n\
    \   o  Browsing software, called Frogans Player, enabling end users to\n     \
    \ browse Frogans sites.  An end user opens a Frogans site by\n      entering its\
    \ Frogans address in Frogans Player.\n   o  A registry, called the Frogans Core\
    \ Registry (FCR), that contains\n      all Frogans addresses registered by Frogans\
    \ site publishers.  The\n      registry operator, called the FCR Operator, ensures\
    \ the resolution\n      of Frogans addresses when end users enter them in Frogans\
    \ Player.\n"
- title: 1.2.  About the OP3FT
  contents:
  - "1.2.  About the OP3FT\n   Created in 2012, the Organization for the Promotion,\
    \ Protection, and\n   Progress of Frogans Technology [OP3FT] is a dedicated, non-profit\n\
    \   organization whose purpose is to hold, promote, protect, and ensure\n   the\
    \ progress of the Frogans technology, in the form of an open\n   standard, available\
    \ to all, free of charge.\n   As part of its mission, the OP3FT develops and releases\
    \ technical\n   specifications, reference implementations (including Frogans Player),\n\
    \   and various policies, which define the rights and responsibilities of\n  \
    \ all stakeholders involved in the technology worldwide.\n"
- title: 2.  The Need for a New URI Scheme and Its Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.  The Need for a New URI Scheme and Its Purpose\n   Generic software layers\
    \ running on top of the original Internet\n   infrastructure offer mechanisms\
    \ that enable end users to easily go\n   from one layer to another, in both directions.\
    \  For example, end\n   users can easily launch their usual Web browser on a given\
    \ Web page\n   from a message in their usual E-mail client; in the other direction,\n\
    \   end users can easily launch their usual E-mail client with a given\n   E-mail\
    \ address from a Web page in their usual Web browser.  This is\n   commonly achieved\
    \ using URIs [RFC3986].\n   As regards Frogans as a medium, in the outgoing direction,\
    \ FSDL\n   enables Frogans site publishers to include way-out buttons in their\n\
    \   Frogans sites.  These buttons enable end users to launch their usual\n   Web\
    \ browser on a given Web page, or to launch their usual E-mail\n   client with\
    \ a given E-mail address.  This is achieved by associating\n   a URI with each\
    \ of those way-out buttons (the scheme of the URI can\n   be any of 'http', 'https',\
    \ or 'mailto').\n   Conversely, in the incoming direction, Web-site publishers\
    \ should\n   have a means to include in their Web pages links that enable end\n\
    \   users to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.  Likewise,\n   people\
    \ writing E-mail messages should have a means to include in\n   their messages\
    \ links that enable recipients to launch Frogans Player\n   on a given Frogans\
    \ site.  More generally, any end-user application\n   should be able to launch\
    \ Frogans Player on a given Frogans site.\n   To achieve this, a new URI scheme,\
    \ containing a Frogans address, is\n   needed.\n   Given that Frogans, as a medium,\
    \ does not enable deep linking for\n   Frogans sites, there is no need for additional\
    \ information in the new\n   URI scheme other than the Frogans address.\n   The\
    \ use of a media type as a means to include on a Web page a link\n   that enables\
    \ end users to launch Frogans Player on a given Frogans\n   site was tested in\
    \ 2006 with the registration of the\n   'vnd.frogans.ltf' media type with IANA\
    \ [LTF].  But use of a media\n   type was determined to be unsatisfactory for\
    \ several reasons.  First,\n   for any such link included on a Web page, the author\
    \ of the Web page\n   had to create and host a .ltf file on the Web server hosting\
    \ that Web\n   page, which was cumbersome.  Furthermore, prior to creating such\n\
    \   links, the author had to ask the server administrator to associate\n   the\
    \ .ltf files with the 'vnd.frogans.ltf' media type on the server.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the author could create a link via a redirection\n   service that would generate\
    \ a .ltf file on the fly while associating\n   it with the 'vnd.frogans.ltf' media\
    \ type.  But that alternative\n   raised privacy concerns and potentially added\
    \ latency for end users.\n   Finally, on the Web browser side, it appeared that\
    \ using a media type\n   from a Web page to launch another application did not\
    \ always work,\n   especially on mobile devices.\n"
- title: 3.  Choice of the Scheme Name
  contents:
  - "3.  Choice of the Scheme Name\n   The name chosen for the new URI scheme is 'leaptofrogans'.\n\
    \   This scheme name was chosen in compliance with [RFC7595], Section 3.8\n  \
    \ (\"Scheme Name Considerations\").\n   The following shorter names were discussed,\
    \ but they were not chosen:\n   o  'ltf': this name, an acronym for \"leap to\
    \ Frogans\", was considered\n      insufficiently descriptive, especially for\
    \ typical end users who\n      have little technical knowledge.\n   o  'leapto':\
    \ this name was considered overly general, and it is not\n      specifically associated\
    \ with Frogans.\n   o  'frogans': this name was rejected because it could create\n\
    \      confusion between URIs based on this scheme and those Frogans\n      addresses\
    \ that start with \"frogans\".\n"
- title: 4.  Scheme Syntax
  contents:
  - "4.  Scheme Syntax\n   Frogans addresses [IFAP] are international identifiers\
    \ made up of\n   Unicode characters.  Thus, a method for encoding non-US-ASCII\n\
    \   characters is necessary when the new scheme is used as a URI.  The\n   new\
    \ scheme can also be useful as an IRI [RFC3987] in contexts where\n   IRIs are\
    \ allowed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  URI Scheme
  contents:
  - "4.1.  URI Scheme\n   The syntax for the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme is:\n    \
    \  leaptofrogans-uri = \"leaptofrogans:\" pct-encoded-frogans-address\n   where\
    \ pct-encoded-frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant with\n   [IFAP] and\
    \ whose Unicode characters are each encoded as follows:\n   o  If the character\
    \ is a US-ASCII character, do not replace it and\n      skip to the next character.\
    \  Note that according to [IFAP], the\n      US-ASCII character cannot be the\
    \ U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character.\n   o  Otherwise, apply steps 1 through 3 below:\n\
    \      1.  Convert the character to a sequence of one or more octets\n       \
    \   using UTF-8 [UTF-8]\n      2.  Convert each octet to %HH, where HH is the\
    \ hexadecimal\n          notation of the octet value.  Note that this is identical\
    \ to\n          the percent-encoding mechanism in Section 2.1 of [RFC3986].\n\
    \      3.  Replace the original character with the resulting character\n     \
    \     sequence (i.e., a sequence of %HH triplets).\n   Examples of 'leaptofrogans'\
    \ URIs:\n   -  if the Frogans address is the string of US-ASCII characters\n \
    \     \"Network-Name*Site-Name\", the URI is as follows:\n        leaptofrogans:Network-Name*Site-Name\n\
    \   -  if the Frogans address is the string of Unicode characters U+7F51,\n  \
    \    U+7EDC, U+540D, U+002A, U+7AD9, U+540D (which is a Chinese\n      translation\
    \ of the Frogans address in the previous example), the\n      URI is as follows:\n\
    \        leaptofrogans:%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%90%8D*%E7%AB%99%E5%90%8D\n"
- title: 4.2.  IRI Usage and Encoding
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IRI Usage and Encoding\n   The syntax for an IRI corresponding to the 'leaptofrogans'\
    \ URI scheme\n   is:\n      leaptofrogans-iri = \"leaptofrogans:\" frogans-address\n\
    \   where frogans-address is a Frogans address compliant with [IFAP] and\n   encoded\
    \ in UTF-8 [UTF-8].\n   In contexts where both URIs and IRIs are allowed, end-user\n\
    \   applications can use either a URI or an IRI based on the\n   'leaptofrogans'\
    \ URI scheme when launching Frogans Player on a given\n   Frogans site.  This\
    \ is because Frogans Player must interpret both\n   URIs and IRIs based on the\
    \ 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme.  If the U+0025\n   PERCENT SIGN character is found\
    \ in the string, then the string will\n   be interpreted by Frogans Player as\
    \ a URI; otherwise, it will be\n   interpreted as an IRI.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The author of a Web page can create a link where\
    \ the true nature of\n   the URI is hidden in the link text that is visible to\
    \ end users.  The\n   same applies for an E-mail message and other end-user applications.\n\
    \   For URIs based on the 'leaptofrogans' URI scheme, the risk of\n   confusion\
    \ is mitigated because Frogans Player must always display the\n   real Frogans\
    \ address contained in the URI, and it must always require\n   confirmation by\
    \ the end user before opening the corresponding Frogans\n   site.\n   Also, an\
    \ end-user application may provide a URI containing a Frogans\n   address that\
    \ is not valid.  This does not represent a risk because,\n   before asking for\
    \ confirmation by the end user, Frogans Player must\n   always verify that the\
    \ Frogans address contained in the URI is\n   compliant with [IFAP], and it must\
    \ always raise an error if the\n   Frogans address is not compliant.\n"
