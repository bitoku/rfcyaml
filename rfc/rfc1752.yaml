  - "1. Summary\n   The IETF started its effort to select a successor to IPv4 in late\n\
    \   1990 when projections indicated that the Internet address space would\n  \
    \ become an increasingly limiting resource.  Several parallel efforts\n   then\
    \ started exploring ways to resolve these address limitations\n   while at the\
    \ same time providing additional functionality.  The IETF\n   formed the IPng\
    \ Area in late 1993 to investigate the various\n   proposals and recommend how\
    \ to proceed.  We developed an IPng\n   technical criteria document and evaluated\
    \ the various proposals\n   against it.  All were found wanting to some degree.\
    \  After this\n   evaluation, a revised proposal was offered by one of the working\n\
    \   groups that resolved many of the problems in the previous proposals.\n   The\
    \ IPng Area Directors recommend that the IETF designate this\n   revised proposal\
    \ as the IPng and focus its energy on bringing a set\n   of documents defining\
    \ the IPng to Proposed Standard status with all\n   deliberate speed.\n   This\
    \ protocol recommendation includes a simplified header with a\n   hierarchical\
    \ address structure that permits rigorous route\n   aggregation and is also large\
    \ enough to meet the needs of the\n   Internet for the foreseeable future. The\
    \ protocol also includes\n   packet-level authentication and encryption along\
    \ with plug and play\n   autoconfiguration.  The design changes the way IP header\
    \ options are\n   encoded to increase the flexibility of introducing new options\
    \ in the\n   future while improving performance. It also includes the ability\
    \ to\n   label traffic flows.\n   Specific recommendations include:\n   * current\
    \ address assignment policies are adequate\n   * there is no current need to reclaim\
    \ underutilized assigned network\n     numbers\n   * there is no current need\
    \ to renumber major portions of the Internet\n   * CIDR-style assignments of parts\
    \ of unassigned Class A address space\n     should be considered\n   * \"Simple\
    \ Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) Spec. (128 bit ver)\"\n     [Deering94b] be adopted\
    \ as the basis for IPng\n   * the documents listed in Appendix C be the foundation\
    \ of the IPng\n     effort\n   * an IPng Working Group be formed, chaired by Steve\
    \ Deering and Ross\n     Callon\n   * Robert Hinden be the document editor for\
    \ the IPng effort\n   * an IPng Reviewer be appointed and that Dave Clark be the\
    \ reviewer\n   * an Address Autoconfiguration Working Group be formed, chaired\
    \ by\n     Dave Katz and Sue Thomson\n   * an IPng Transition Working Group be\
    \ formed, chaired by Bob Gilligan\n     and TBA\n   * the Transition and Coexistence\
    \ Including Testing Working Group be\n     chartered\n   * recommendations about\
    \ the use of non-IPv6 addresses in IPv6\n     environments and IPv6 addresses\
    \ in non-IPv6 environments be\n     developed\n   * the IESG commission a review\
    \ of all IETF standards documents for\n     IPng implications\n   * the IESG task\
    \ current IETF working groups to take IPng into account\n   * the IESG charter\
    \ new working groups where needed to revise old\n     standards documents\n  \
    \ * Informational RFCs be solicited or developed describing a few\n     specific\
    \ IPng APIs\n   * the IPng Area and Area Directorate continue until main documents\n\
    \     are offered as Proposed Standards in late 1994\n   * support for the Authentication\
    \ Header be required\n   * support for a specific authentication algorithm be\
    \ required\n   * support for the Privacy Header be required\n   * support for\
    \ a specific privacy algorithm be required\n   * an \"IPng framework for firewalls\"\
    \ be developed\n"

  - "2. Background\n   Even the most farseeing of the developers of TCP/IP in the\
    \ early\n   1980s did not imagine the dilemma of scale that the Internet faces\n\
    \   today.  1987 estimates projected a need to address as many as 100,000\n  \
    \ networks at some vague point in the future. [Callon87]  We will reach\n   that\
    \ mark by 1996.  There are many realistic projections of many\n   millions of\
    \ interconnected networks in the not too distant future.\n   [Vecchi94, Taylor94]\n\
    \   Further, even though the current 32 bit IPv4 address structure can\n   enumerate\
    \ over 4 billion hosts on as many as 16.7 million networks,\n   the actual address\
    \ assignment efficiency is far less than that, even\n   on a theoretical basis.\
    \ [Huitema94]  This inefficiency is exacerbated\n   by the granularity of assignments\
    \ using Class A, B and C addresses.\n   In August 1990 during the Vancouver IETF\
    \ meeting, Frank Solensky,\n   Phill Gross and Sue Hares projected that the current\
    \ rate of\n   assignment would exhaust the Class B space by March of 1994.\n \
    \  The then obvious remedy of assigning multiple Class C addresses in\n   place\
    \ of Class B addresses introduced its own problem by further\n   expanding the\
    \ size of the routing tables in the backbone routers\n   already growing at an\
    \ alarming rate.\n   We faced the dilemma of choosing between accepting either\
    \ limiting\n   the rate of growth and ultimate size of the Internet, or disrupting\n\
    \   the network by changing to new techniques or technologies.\n   The IETF formed\
    \ the Routing and Addressing (ROAD) group in November\n   1991 at the Santa Fe\
    \ IETF meeting to explore this dilemma and guide\n   the IETF on the issues. \
    \ The ROAD group reported their work in March\n   1992 at the San Diego IETF meeting.\
    \  [Gross92]  The impact of the\n   recommendations ranged from \"immediate\"\
    \ to \"long term\" and included\n   adopting the CIDR route aggregation proposal\
    \ [Fuller93] for reducing\n   the rate of routing table growth and recommending\
    \ a call for\n   proposals \"to form working groups to explore separate approaches\
    \ for\n   bigger Internet addresses.\"\n   In the late spring of 1992 the IAB\
    \ issued \"IP version 7\" [IAB92],\n   concurring in the ROAD group's endorsement\
    \ of CIDR and also\n   recommending \"an immediate IETF effort to prepare a detailed\
    \ and\n   organizational plan for using CLNP as the basis for IPv7.\" After\n\
    \   spirited discussion, the IETF decided to reject the IAB's\n   recommendation\
    \ and issue the call for  proposals recommended by the\n   ROAD group.  This call\
    \ was issued in July 1992 at the Boston IETF\n   meeting and a number of working\
    \ groups were formed in response\n   During the July 1993 Amsterdam IETF meeting\
    \ an IPng (IP Next\n   Generation) Decision Process (ipdecide) BOF was held. \
    \ This BOF \"was\n   intended to help re-focus attention on the very important\
    \ topic of\n   making a decision between the candidates for IPng. The BOF focused\
    \ on\n   the issues of who should take the lead in making the recommendation\n\
    \   to the community and what criteria should be used to reach the\n   recommendation.\"\
    \ [Carpen93]\n"
- title: 3. A Direction for IPng
  contents:
  - "3. A Direction for IPng\n   In September 1993 Phill Gross, chair of the IESG\
    \ issued \"A Direction\n   for IPng\".  [Gross94]  In this memo he summarized\
    \ the results of the\n   ipdecide BOF and open IESG plenary in Amsterdam.\n  \
    \ * The IETF needs to move toward closure on IPng.\n   * The IESG has the responsibility\
    \ for developing an IPng\n     recommendation for the Internet community.\n  \
    \ * The procedures of the recommendation-making process should be open\n     and\
    \ published well in advance by the IESG.\n   * As part of this process, the IPng\
    \ WGs may be given new milestones\n     and other guidance to aid the IESG.\n\
    \   * There should be ample opportunity for community comment prior to\n     final\
    \ IESG recommendation.\n   The memo also announced \"a temporary, ad hoc, 'area'\
    \ to deal\n   specifically with IPng issues.\"  Phill asked two of the current\
    \ IESG\n   members, Allison Mankin (Transport Services Area) and Scott Bradner\n\
    \   (Operational Requirements Area), to act as Directors for the new\n   area.\
    \ The Area Directors were given a specific charge on how to\n   investigate the\
    \ various IPng proposals and how to base their\n   recommendation to the IETF.\
    \  It was also requested that a specific\n   recommendation be made.\n   * Establish\
    \ an IPng directorate.\n   * Ensure that a completely open process is followed.\n\
    \   * Develop an understanding of the level of urgency and the time\n     constraints\
    \ imposed by the rate of address assignment and rate of\n     growth in the routing\
    \ tables.\n   * Recommend the adoption of assignment policy changes if warranted.\n\
    \   * Define the scope of the IPng effort based on the understanding of\n    \
    \ the time constraints.\n   * Develop a clear and concise set of technical requirements\
    \ and\n     decision criteria for IPng.\n   * Develop a recommendation about which\
    \ of the current IPng candidates\n     to accept, if any.\n"

  - "4. IPng Area\n   After the IPng Area was formed, we recruited a directorate.\
    \ (Appendix\n   B) The members of the directorate were chosen both for their general\n\
    \   and specific technical expertise.  The individuals were then asked to\n  \
    \ have their management authorize this participation in the process and\n   confirm\
    \ that they understood the IETF process.\n   We took great care to ensure the\
    \ inclusion of a wide spectrum of\n   knowledge. The directors are experts in\
    \ security, routing, the needs\n   of large users, end system manufacturers, Unix\
    \ and non-Unix\n   platforms, router manufacturers, theoretical researchers, protocol\n\
    \   architecture, and the operating regional, national, and international\n  \
    \ networks.  Additionally, several members of the directorate were\n   deeply\
    \ involved in each of the IPng proposal working groups.\n   The directorate functions\
    \ as a direction-setting and preliminary\n   review body as requested by the charge\
    \ to the area.  The directorate\n   engages in biweekly conference calls, participates\
    \ in an internal\n   mailing list and corresponds actively on the Big-Internet\
    \ mailing\n   list. The directorate held open meetings during the March 1994\n\
    \   Seattle and July 1994 Toronto IETF meetings as well as two additional\n  \
    \ multi-day retreats.  To ensure that the IPng process was as open as\n   possible,\
    \ we took minutes during these meetings and then published\n   them. Additionally,\
    \ we placed the archives of the internal IPng\n   mailing list on an anonymous\
    \ ftp site. (Hsdndev.harvard.edu:\n   pub/ipng.)\n"
- title: 5. ALE Working Group
  contents:
  - "5. ALE Working Group\n   We needed a reasonable estimate of the time remaining\
    \ before we\n   exhausted the IPv4 address space in order to determine the scope\
    \ of\n   the IPng effort.  If the time remaining was about the same needed to\n\
    \   deploy a replacement, then we would have select the IPng which would\n   only\
    \ fix the address limitations since we would not have enough time\n   to develop\
    \ any other features.  If more time seemed available, we\n   could consider additional\
    \ improvements.\n   The IETF formed an Address Lifetime Expectations (ALE) Working\
    \ Group\n   in 1993 \"to develop an estimate for the remaining lifetime of the\n\
    \   IPv4 address space based on currently known and available\n   technologies.\"\
    \ [Solens93a]  Tony Li of Cisco Systems and Frank\n   Solensky of FTP Software\
    \ are the co-chairs.  The IETF also charged\n   the working group to consider\
    \ if developing more stringent address\n   allocation and utilization policies\
    \ might provide more time for the\n   transition.\n"
- title: 5.1 ALE Projections
  contents:
  - "5.1 ALE Projections\n   The ALE Working Group met during the November 1993 Houston,\n\
    \   [Solens93b] March 1994 Seattle [Bos93] and July 1994 Toronto\n   [Solens94]\
    \ IETF meetings.  They projected at the Seattle meeting,\n   later confirmed at\
    \ the Toronto meeting that, using the current\n   allocation statistics, the Internet\
    \ would exhaust the IPv4 address\n   space between 2005 and 2011.\n   Some members\
    \ of the ipv4-ale and big-internet mailing lists called\n   into question the\
    \ reliability of this projection.  It has been\n   criticized as both too optimistic\
    \ and as too pessimistic.\n   Some people pointed out that this type of projection\
    \ makes an\n   assumption of no paradigm shifts in IP usage.  If someone were\
    \ to\n   develop a new 'killer application', (for example cable-TV set top\n \
    \  boxes.)  The resultant rise in the demand for IP addresses could make\n   this\
    \ an over-estimate of the time available.\n   There may also be a problem with\
    \ the data used to make the\n   projection.  The InterNIC allocates IP addresses\
    \ in large chunks to\n   regional Network Information Centers (NICs) and network\
    \ providers.\n   The NICs and the providers then re-allocate addresses to their\n\
    \   customers.  The ALE projections used the InterNIC assignments without\n  \
    \ regard to the actual rate of assignment of addresses to the end\n   users. \
    \ They did the projection this way since the accuracy of the\n   data seems quite\
    \ a bit higher.  While using this once-removed data\n   may add a level of over-estimation\
    \ since it assumes the rate of large\n   block allocation will continue, this\
    \ may not be the case.\n   These factors reduce the reliability of the ALE estimates\
    \ but, in\n   general, they seem to indicate enough time remaining in the IPv4\n\
    \   address space to consider adding features in an IPng besides just\n   expanding\
    \ the address size even when considering time required for\n   development, testing,\
    \ and deployment.\n"
- title: 5.2 Routing Table Size
  contents:
  - "5.2 Routing Table Size\n   Another issue in Internet scaling is the increasing\
    \ size of the\n   routing tables required in the backbone routers.  Adopting the\
    \ CIDR\n   block address assignment and aggregating routes reduced the size of\n\
    \   the tables for awhile but they are now expanding again. Providers now\n  \
    \ need to more aggressively advertise their routes only in aggregates.\n   Providers\
    \ must also advise their new customers to renumber their\n   networks in the best\
    \ interest of the entire Internet community.\n   The problem of exhausting the\
    \ IPv4 address space may be moot if this\n   issue is ignored and if routers cannot\
    \ be found that can keep up with\n   the table size growth.  Before implementing\
    \ CIDR the backbone routing\n   table was growing at a rate about 1.5 times as\
    \ fast as memory\n   technology.\n   We should also note that even though IPng\
    \ addresses are designed with\n   aggregation in mind switching to IPng will not\
    \ solve the routing\n   table size problem unless the addresses are assigned rigorously\
    \ to\n   maximize the affect of such aggregation.  This efficient advertising\n\
    \   of routes can be maintained since IPng includes address\n   autoconfiguration\
    \ mechanisms to allow easy renumbering if a customer\n   decides to switch providers.\
    \  Customers who receive service from more\n   than one provider may limit the\
    \ ultimate efficiency of any route\n   aggregation. [Rekhter94]\n"

  - "5.3 Address Assignment Policy Recommendations\n   The IESG Chair charged the\

    \ significant portions\n   of the Internet. [Gross94]\n   The IPng Area Directors\
    \ endorse the current address assignment\n   policies in view of the ALE projections.\
    \  We do not feel that anyone\n   should take specific efforts to reclaim underutilized\
    \ addresses\n   already assigned or to renumber forcefully major portions of the\n\
    \   Internet.  We do however feel that we should all encourage network\n   service\
    \ providers to assist new customers in renumbering their\n   networks to conform\
    \ to the provider's CIDR assignments.\n   The ALE Working Group recommends that\
    \ we consider assigning CIDR-type\n   address blocks out of the unassigned Class\
    \ A address space.  The IPng\n   Area Directors concur with this recommendation.\n"

  - "6. IPng Technical Requirements\n   The IESG provided an outline in RFC 1380 [Gross92]\
    \ of the type of\n   criteria we should use to determine the suitability of an\
    \ IPng\n   proposal.  The IETF further refined this understanding of the\n   appropriate\
    \ criteria with the recommendations of a Selection Criteria\n   BOF held during\
    \ the November 1992 IETF meeting in Washington D.C.\n   [Almqu92]  We felt we\
    \ needed to get additional input for determining\n   the requirements and issued\
    \ a call for white papers. [Bradner93] This\n   call, issued as RFC 1550, intended\
    \ to reach both inside and outside\n   the traditional IETF constituency to get\
    \ the broadest possible\n   understanding of the requirements for a data networking\
    \ protocol with\n   the broadest possible application.\n   We received twenty\
    \ one white papers in response to the RFC 1550\n   solicitation. ( Appendix E)\
    \  We received responses from the\n   industries that many feel will be the major\
    \ providers of data\n   networking services in the future; the cable TV industry\
    \ [Vecchi94],\n   the cellular industry [Taylor94], and the electric power industry\n\
    \   [Skelton94].  In addition, we received papers that dealt with\n   military\
    \ applications [Adam94, Syming94, Green94], ATM [Brazd94],\n   mobility [Simpson94],\
    \ accounting [Brown94], routing [Estrin94a,\n   Chiappa94], security [Adam94,\
    \ Bell94b, Brit94, Green94, Vecchi94,\n   Flei94], large corporate networking\
    \ [Britt94, Fleisch94], transition\n   [Carpen94a, Heager94], market acceptance\
    \ [Curran94, Britt94], host\n   implementations [Bound94], as well as a number\
    \ of other issues.\n   [Bello94a, Clark94, Ghisel94]\n   These white papers, a\
    \ Next Generation Requirements (ngreq) BOF\n   (chaired by Jon Crowcroft and Frank\
    \ Kastenholz) held during the March\n   1994 Seattle IETF meeting, discussions\
    \ within the IPng Area\n   Directorate and considerable discussion on the big-internet\
    \ mailing\n   list were all used by Frank Kastenholz and Craig Partridge in\n\
    \   revising their earlier criteria draft [Kasten92] to produce\n   \"Technical\
    \ Criteria for Choosing IP The Next Generation (IPng).\"\n   [Kasten94]  This\
    \ document is the \"clear and concise set of technical\n   requirements and decision\
    \ criteria for IPng\" called for in the charge\n   from the IESG Chair.  We used\
    \ this document as the basic guideline\n   while evaluating the IPng proposals.\n"
- title: 6.1 The IPng Technical Criteria document
  contents:
  - "6.1 The IPng Technical Criteria document\n   The criteria described in this document\
    \ include: (from Kasten94)\n   * complete specification - The proposal must completely\
    \ describe the\n     proposed protocol.  We must select an IPng by referencing\
    \ specific\n     documents, not to future work.\n   * architectural simplicity\
    \ - The IP-layer protocol should be as\n     simple as possible with functions\
    \ located elsewhere that are more\n     appropriately performed at protocol layers\
    \ other than the IP layer.\n   * scale - The IPng Protocol must allow identifying\
    \ and addressing at\n     least 10**9 leaf-networks (and preferably much more)\n\
    \   * topological flexibility - The routing architecture and protocols\n     ofIPng\
    \ must allow for many different network topologies.  They must\n     not assume\
    \ that the network's physical structure is a tree.\n   * performance - A state\
    \ of the art, commercial grade router must be\n     able to process and forward\
    \ IPng traffic at speeds capable of fully\n     utilizing common, commercially\
    \ available, high-speed media at the\n     time.\n   * robust service - The network\
    \ service and its associated routing and\n     control protocols must be robust.\n\
    \   * transition -  The protocol must have a straightforward transition\n    \
    \ plan from IPv4.\n   * media independence -  The protocol must work across an\
    \ internetwork\n     of many different LAN, MAN, and WAN media, with individual\
    \ link\n     speeds ranging from a ones-of-bits per second to hundreds of\n  \
    \   gigabits per second.\n   * datagram service - The protocol must support an\
    \ unreliable datagram\n     delivery service.\n   * configuration ease -  The\
    \ protocol must permit easy and largely\n     distributed configuration and operation.\
    \ Automatic configuration of\n     hosts and routers is required.\n   * security\
    \ - IPng must provide a secure network layer.\n   * unique names - IPng must assign\
    \ unique names to all IP-Layer\n     objects in the global, ubiquitous, Internet.\
    \  These names may or\n     may not have any location, topology, or routing significance.\n\
    \   * access to standards -  The protocols that define IPng and its\n     associated\
    \ protocols should be as freely available and\n     redistributable as the IPv4\
    \ and related RFCs.  There must be no\n     specification-related licensing fees\
    \ for implementing or selling\n     IPng software.\n   * multicast support - The\
    \ protocol must support both unicast and\n     multicast packet transmission.\
    \   Dynamic and automatic routing of\n     multicasts is also required.\n   *\
    \ extensibility -  The protocol must be extensible; it must be able\n     to evolve\
    \ to meet the future service needs of the Internet. This\n     evolution must\
    \ be achievable without requiring network-wide\n     software upgrades.\n   *\
    \ service classes - The protocol must allow network devices to\n     associate\
    \ packets with particular service classes and provide them\n     with the  services\
    \ specified by those classes.\n   * mobility - The protocol must support mobile\
    \ hosts, networks and\n     internetworks.\n   * control protocol - The protocol\
    \ must include elementary support for\n     testing and debugging networks. (e.g.,\
    \ ping and traceroute)\n   * tunneling support -  IPng must allow users to build\
    \ private\n     internetworks on top of the basic Internet Infrastructure.  Both\n\
    \     private IP-based internetworks and private non-IP-based (e.g., CLNP\n  \
    \   or AppleTalk) internetworks must be supported.\n"
- title: 7. IPng Proposals
  contents:
  - "7. IPng Proposals\n   By the time that the IPng Area was formed, the IETF had\
    \ already aimed\n   a considerable amount of IETF effort at solving the addressing\
    \ and\n   routing problems of the Internet.  Several proposals had been made\n\
    \   and some of these reached the level of having a working group\n   chartered.\
    \  A number of these groups subsequently merged forming\n   groups with a larger\
    \ consensus.  These efforts represented different\n   views on the issues which\
    \ confront us and sought to optimize\n   different aspects of the possible solutions.\n\
    \   By February 1992 the Internet community developed four separate\n   proposals\
    \ for IPng [Gross92], \"CNAT\" [Callon92a], \"IP Encaps\"\n   [Hinden92a], \"\
    Nimrod\" [Chiappa91], and \"Simple CLNP\" [Callon92b].  By\n   December 1992 three\
    \ more proposals followed; \"The P Internet\n   Protocol\" (PIP) [Tsuchiya92],\
    \ \"The Simple Internet Protocol\" (SIP)\n   [Deering92] and \"TP/IX\" [Ullmann93].\
    \ After the March 1992 San Diego\n   IETF meeting \"Simple CLNP\" evolved into\
    \ \"TCP and UDP with Bigger\n   Addresses\" (TUBA) [Callon92c] and \"IP Encaps\"\
    \ evolved into \"IP\n   Address Encapsulation\" (IPAE) [Hinden92b].\n   By November\
    \ 1993, IPAE merged with SIP while still maintaining the\n   name SIP. This group\
    \ then merged with PIP and the resulting working\n   group called themselves \"\
    Simple Internet Protocol Plus\" (SIPP).  At\n   the same time the TP/IX Working\
    \ Group changed its name to \"Common\n   Architecture for the Internet\" (CATNIP).\n\
    \   None of these proposals were wrong nor were others right.  All of the\n  \
    \ proposals would work in some ways providing a path to overcome the\n   obstacles\
    \ we face as the Internet expands. The task of the IPng Area\n   was to ensure\
    \ that the IETF understand the offered proposals, learn\n   from the proposals\
    \ and provide a recommendation on what path best\n   resolves the basic issues\
    \ while providing the best foundation upon\n   which to build for the future.\n\
    \   The IPng Area evaluated three IPng proposals as they were described\n   in\
    \ their RFC 1550 white papers: CATNIP [McGovern94] , SIPP\n   [Hinden94a] and\
    \ TUBA. [Ford94a]. The IESG viewed Nimrod as too much\n   of a research project\
    \ for consideration as an IPng candidate.  Since\n   Nimrod represents one possible\
    \ future Internet routing strategy we\n   solicited a paper describing any requirements\
    \ Nimrod would put on an\n   IPng to add to the requirements process. [Chiappa94]\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1 CATNIP\n   \"Common Architecture for the Internet (CATNIP) was conceived\
    \ as a\n   convergence protocol. CATNIP integrates CLNP, IP, and IPX. The CATNIP\n\
    \   design provides for any of the transport layer protocols in use, for\n   example\
    \ TP4, CLTP, TCP, UDP, IPX and SPX, to run over any of the\n   network layer protocol\
    \ formats: CLNP, IP (version 4), IPX, and\n   CATNIP.  With some attention paid\
    \ to details, it is possible for a\n   transport layer protocol (such as TCP)\
    \ to operate properly with one\n   end system using one network layer (e.g., IP\
    \ version 4) and the other\n   using some other network protocol, such as CLNP.\"\
    \ [McGovern94]\n   \"The objective is to provide common ground between the Internet,\
    \ OSI,\n   and the Novell protocols, as well as to advance the Internet\n   technology\
    \ to the scale and performance of the next generation of\n   internetwork technology.\"\
    \n   \"CATNIP supports OSI Network Service Access Point (NSAP) format\n   addresses.\
    \  It also uses cache handles to provide both rapid\n   identification of the\
    \ next hop in high performance routing as well as\n   abbreviation of the network\
    \ header by permitting the addresses to be\n   omitted when a valid cache handle\
    \ is available. The fixed part of the\n   network layer header carries the cache\
    \ handles.\" [Sukonnik94]\n"
- title: 7.2 SIPP
  contents:
  - "7.2 SIPP\n   \"Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) is a new version of IP which\
    \ is\n   designed to be an evolutionary step from IPv4.  It is a natural\n   increment\
    \ to IPv4.  It was not a design goal to take a radical step\n   away from IPv4.\
    \  Functions which work in IPv4 were kept in SIPP.\n   Functions which didn't\
    \ work were removed. It can be installed as a\n   normal software upgrade in internet\
    \ devices and is interoperable with\n   the current IPv4.  Its deployment strategy\
    \ was designed to not have\n   any 'flag' days.  SIPP is designed to run well\
    \ on high performance\n   networks (e.g., ATM) and at the same time is still efficient\
    \ for low\n   bandwidth networks (e.g., wireless).  In addition, it provides a\n\
    \   platform for new internet functionality that will be required in the\n   near\
    \ future.\" [Hinden94b]\n   \"SIPP increases the IP address size from 32 bits\
    \ to 64 bits, to\n   support more levels of addressing hierarchy and a much greater\
    \ number\n   of addressable nodes.  SIPP addressing can be further extended, in\n\
    \   units of 64 bits, by a facility equivalent to IPv4's Loose Source and\n  \
    \ Record Route option, in combination with a new address type called\n   'cluster\
    \ addresses' which identify topological regions rather than\n   individual nodes.\"\
    \n   \"SIPP changes in the way IP header options are encoded allows for\n   more\
    \ efficient forwarding, less stringent limits on the length of\n   options, and\
    \ greater flexibility for introducing new options in the\n   future. A new capability\
    \ is added to enable the labeling of packets\n   belonging to particular traffic\
    \ 'flows' for which the sender requests\n   special handling, such as non-default\
    \ quality of service or 'real-\n   time' service.\" [Hinden94a]\n"

  - "7.3 TUBA\n   \"The TCP/UDP Over CLNP-Addressed Networks (TUBA) proposal seeks\
    \ to\n   minimize the risk associated with migration to a new IP address\n   space.\
    \ In addition, this proposal is motivated by the requirement to\n   allow the\
    \ Internet to scale, which implies use of Internet\n   applications in a very\
    \ large ubiquitous worldwide Internet. It is\n   therefore proposed that existing\
    \ Internet transport and application\n   protocols continue to operate unchanged,\
    \ except for the replacement\n   of 32-bit IP addresses with larger addresses.\
    \  TUBA does not mean\n   having to move over to OSI completely. It would mean\
    \ only replacing\n   IP with CLNP. TCP, UDP, and the traditional TCP/IP applications\
    \ would\n   run on top of CLNP.\" [Callon92c]\n   \"The TUBA effort will expand\

    \ the continued\n   use of Internet transport protocols, in particular TCP and\
    \ UDP, but\n   specifies their encapsulation in ISO 8473 (CLNP) packets.  This\
    \ will\n   allow the continued use of Internet application protocols such as\n\
    \   FTP, SMTP, TELNET, etc.   TUBA seeks to upgrade the current system by\n  \
    \ a transition from the use of IPv4 to ISO/IEC 8473 (CLNP) and the\n   corresponding\
    \ large Network Service Access Point (NSAP) address\n   space.\" [Knopper94]\n\

    \ over CLNP) and DNS servers (to return larger addresses).\n   This proposal requires\
    \ routers to be updated to support forwarding of\n   CLNP (in addition to IP).\
    \ However, this proposal does not require\n   encapsulation nor translation of\
    \ packets nor address mapping. IP\n   addresses and NSAP addresses may be assigned\

    \   However, many of the ideas in CATNIP are innovative and a number of\n   reviewers\
    \ felt CATNIP shows the best vision of all of the proposals.\n   The use of Network\

- title: 8.2 SIPP Reviews
  contents:
  - "8.2 SIPP Reviews\n   Most of the reviewers, including those predisposed to other\n\
    \   proposals, felt as one reviewer put it, that SIPP is an\n   \"aesthetically\
    \ beautiful protocol well tailored to compactly satisfy\n   today's known network\
    \ requirements.\"  The SIPP Working Group has been\n   the most dynamic over the\
    \ last year, producing a myriad of\n   documentation detailing almost all of the\
    \ aspects necessary to\n   produce a complete protocol description.\n   The biggest\
    \ problem the reviewers had with SIPP was with IPAE, SIPP's\n   transition plan.\
    \  The overwhelming feeling was that IPAE is fatally\n   flawed and could not\
    \ be made to work reliably in an operational\n   Internet.\n   There was significant\
    \ disagreement about the adequacy of the SIPP 64\n   bit address size.  Although\
    \ you can enumerate 10**15 end nodes in 64\n   bits people have different views\
    \ about how much inefficiency real-\n   world routing plans introduce. [Huitema94]\
    \  The majority felt that 64\n   bit addresses do not provide adequate space for\
    \ the hierarchy\n   required to meet the needs of the future Internet. In addition\
    \ since\n   no one has any experience with extended addressing and routing\n \
    \  concepts of the type proposed in SIPP, the reviewers generally felt\n   quite\
    \ uncomfortable with this methodology.  The reviewers also felt\n   that the design\
    \ introduces some significant security issues.\n   A number of reviewers felt\
    \ that SIPP did not address the routing\n   issue in any useful way.  In particular,\
    \ there has been no serious\n   attempt made at developing ways to abstract topology\
    \ information or\n   to aggregate information about areas of the network.\n  \

- title: 8.3 TUBA Reviews
  contents:
  - "8.3 TUBA Reviews\n   The reviewers generally felt that the most important thing\
    \ that TUBA\n   has offers is that it is based on CLNP and there is significant\n\
    \   deployment of CLNP-capable routers throughout the Internet.  There\n   was\
    \ considerably less agreement that there was significant deployment\n   of CLNP-capable\
    \ hosts or actual networks running CLNP.  Another\n   strong positive for TUBA\
    \ is the potential for convergence of ISO and\n   IETF networking standards. \
    \ A number of reviewers pointed out that,\n   if TUBA were to be based on a changed\
    \ CLNP then the advantage of an\n   existing deployed infrastructure would be\
    \ lost and that the\n   convergence potential would be reduced.\n   A number of\
    \ aspects of CLNP were felt to be a problem by the\n   reviewers including the\
    \ inefficiencies introduced by the lack of any\n   particular word alignment of\
    \ the header fields, CLNP source route,\n   the lack of a flow ID field, the lack\
    \ of a protocol ID field, and the\n   use of CLNP error messages in TUBA. The\
    \ CLNP packet format or\n   procedures would have to be modified to resolve at\
    \ least some of\n   these issues.\n   There seems to be a profound disagreement\
    \ within the TUBA community\n   over the question of the ability of the IETF to\
    \ modify the CLNP\n   standards.  In our presentation in Houston we said that\
    \ we felt that\n   \"clone and run\" was a legitimate process.  This is also what\
    \ the IAB\n   proposed in \"IP version 7\". [IAB92]  The TUBA community has not\n\
    \   reached consensus that this view is reasonable.  While many,\n   including\
    \ a number of the CLNP document authors, are adamant that\n   this is not an issue\
    \ and the IETF can make modifications to the base\n   standards, many others are\
    \ just as adamant that the standards can\n   only be changed through the ISO standards\
    \ process.  Since the\n   overwhelming feeling within the IETF is that the IETF\
    \ must 'own' the\n   standards on which it is basing its future, this disagreement\
    \ within\n   the TUBA community was disquieting.\n   For a number of reasons,\
    \ unfortunately including prejudice in a few\n   cases, the reviews of the TUBA\
    \ proposals were much more mixed than\n   for SIPP or CATNIP. Clearly TUBA meets\
    \ the requirements for the\n   ability to scale to large numbers of hosts, supports\
    \ flexible\n   topologies, is media independent and is a datagram protocol.  To\
    \ the\n   reviewers, it was less clear that TUBA met the other IPng\n   requirements\
    \ and these views varied widely.\n   There was also disagreement over the advisability\
    \ of using NSAPs for\n   routing given the wide variety of NSAP allocation plans.\
    \  The\n   Internet would have to restrict the use of NSAPs to those which are\n\
    \   allocated with the actual underlying network topology in mind if the\n   required\
    \ degree of aggregation of routing information is to be\n   achieved.\n"

    \ its\n   own problems.  Some of these problems would have to be rectified\n \
    \  before either one would be ready to replace IPv4, much less be the\n   vehicle\

  - "9. A Revised Proposal\n   As mentioned above, there was considerable discussion\
    \ of the\n   strengths and weaknesses of the various IPng proposals during the\n\
    \   IPng 'BigTen' retreat on May 19th and 20th 1994. [Knopper94b]  After\n   this\
    \ retreat Steve Deering and Paul Francis, two of the co-chairs of\n   the SIPP\
    \ Working Group, sent a message to the sipp mailing list\n   detailing the discussions\
    \ at the retreat and proposing some changes\n   in SIPP. [Deering94a]\n   The\
    \ message noted \"The recurring (and unsurprising) concerns about\n   SIPP were:\n\
    \   (1) complexity/manageability/feasibility of IPAE, and\n   (2) adequacy/correctness/limitations\
    \ of SIPP's addressing and routing\n       model, especially the use of loose\
    \ source routing to accomplish\n       'extended addressing'\".\n   They \"proposed\
    \ to address these concerns by changing SIPP as follows:\n   * Change address\
    \ size from 8 bytes to 16 bytes (fixed-length).\n   * Specify optional use of\
    \ serverless autoconfiguration of the 16-byte\n     address by using IEEE 802\
    \ address as the low-order (\"node ID\")\n     part.\n   * For higher-layer protocols\
    \ that use internet-layer addresses as\n     part of connection identifiers (e.g.,\
    \ TCP), require that they use\n     the entire 16-byte addresses.\n   * Do *not*\
    \ use Route Header for extended addressing.\"\n   After considerable discussion\
    \ on the sipp and big-internet mailing\n   lists about these proposed changes,\
    \ the SIPP working group published\n   a revised version of SIPP [Deering94b],\
    \ a new addressing architecture\n   [Francis94], and a simplified transition mechanism\
    \ [Gillig94a].\n   These were submitted to the IPng Directorate for their consideration.\n\
    \   This proposal represents a synthesis of multiple IETF efforts with\n   much\
    \ of the basic protocol coming from the SIPP effort, the\n   autoconfiguration\
    \ and transition portions influenced by TUBA, the\n   addressing structure is\
    \ based on the CIDR work and the routing header\n   evolving out of the SDRP deliberations.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.1 Criteria Document and Timing of Recommendation\n   In making the following\
    \ recommendations we are making two assumptions\n   of community consensus; that\
    \ the IPng criteria document represents\n   the reasonable set of requirements\
    \ for an IPng, and that a specific\n   recommendation should be made now and that\
    \ from this point on the\n   IETF should proceed with a single IPng effort.\n\
    \   As described above, the IPng Technical Criteria document [Kasten94]\n   was\
    \ developed in a open manner and was the topic of extensive\n   discussions on\
    \ a number of mailing lists.  We believe that there is a\n   strong consensus\
    \ that this document accurately reflects the\n   community's set of technical\
    \ requirements which an IPng should be\n   able to meet.\n   A prime topic of\
    \ discussion on the big-internet mailing list this\n   spring as well as during\
    \ the open IPng directorate meeting in\n   Seattle, was the need to make a specific\
    \ IPng recommendation at this\n   time.  Some people felt that additional research\
    \ would help resolve\n   some of the issues that are currently unresolved.  While\
    \ others\n   argued that selecting a single protocol to work on would clarify\
    \ the\n   picture for the community, focus the resources of the IETF on\n   finalizing\
    \ its details, and, since the argument that there were open\n   research items\
    \ could be made at any point in history, there might\n   never be a 'right' time.\n\
    \   Our reading of the community is that there is a consensus that a\n   specific\
    \ recommendation should be made now.  This is consistent with\n   the views expressed\
    \ during the ipdecide BOF in Amsterdam [Gross94]\n   and in some of the RFC 1550\
    \ white papers [Carpen94a].\n   There is no particular reason to think that the\
    \ basic recommendation\n   would be significantly different if we waited for another\
    \ six months\n   or a year.  Clearly some details which are currently unresolved\
    \ could\n   be filled in if the recommendation were to be delayed, but the\n \
    \  current fragmentation of the IETF's energies limits the efficiency of\n   this\
    \ type of detail resolution. Concentrating the resources of the\n   IETF behind\
    \ a single effort seems to us to be a more efficient way to\n   proceed.\n"
- title: 10.2 Address Length
  contents:
  - "10.2 Address Length\n   One of the most hotly discussed aspects of the IPng design\n\
    \   possibilities was address size and format.  During the IPng process\n   four\
    \ distinct views were expressed about these issues:\n   1. The view that 8 bytes\
    \ of address are enough to meet the current\n      and future needs of the Internet\
    \ (squaring the size of the IP\n      address space).  More would waste bandwidth,\
    \ promote inefficient\n      assignment, and cause problems in some networks (such\
    \ as mobiles\n      and other low speed links).\n   2. The view that 16 bytes\
    \ is about right.  That length supports easy\n      auto-configuration as well\
    \ as organizations with complex internal\n      routing topologies in conjunction\
    \ with the global routing topology\n      now and well into the future.\n   3.\
    \ The view that 20 byte OSI NSAPs should be used in the interests of\n      global\
    \ harmonization.\n   4. The view that variable length addresses which might be\
    \ smaller or\n      larger than 16 bytes should be used to embrace all the above\n\
    \      options and more, so that the size of the address could be\n      adjusted\
    \ to the demands of the particular environment, and to\n      ensure the ability\
    \ to meet any future networking requirements.\n   Good technical and engineering\
    \ arguments were made for and against\n   all of these views. Unanimity was not\
    \ achieved, but we feel that a\n   clear majority view emerged that the use of\
    \ 16 byte fixed length\n   addresses was the best compromise between efficiency,\
    \ functionality,\n   flexibility, and global applicability. [Mankin94]\n"
- title: 11. IPng Recommendation
  contents:
  - "11. IPng Recommendation\n   After a great deal of discussion in many forums and\
    \ with the\n   consensus of the IPng Directorate, we recommend that the protocol\n\
    \   described in \"Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) Spec. (128 bit\n   ver)\"\
    \ [Deering94b] be adopted as the basis for IPng, the next\n   generation of the\
    \ Internet Protocol.  We also recommend that the\n   other documents listed in\
    \ Appendix C be adopted as the basis of\n   specific features of this protocol.\n\
    \   This proposal resolves most of the perceived problems, particularly\n   in\
    \ the areas of addressing, routing, transition and address\n   autoconfiguration.\
    \  It includes the broad base of the SIPP proposal\n   effort, flexible address\
    \ autoconfiguration features, and a merged\n   transition strategy.  We believe\
    \ that it meets the requirements\n   outlined in the IPng Criteria document and\

- title: 11.1 IPng Criteria Document and IPng
  contents:
  - "11.1 IPng Criteria Document and IPng\n   A detailed review of how IPng meets\
    \ the requirements set down in the\n   IPng Criteria document [Kasten94] will\
    \ soon be published.  Following\n   is our feelings about the extent to which\
    \ IPng is responsive to the\n   criteria.\n   * complete specification - the base\
    \ specifications for IPng are\n     complete but transition and address autoconfiguration\
    \ do remain to\n     be finalized\n   * architectural simplicity - the protocol\
    \ is simple, easy to explain\n     and uses well established paradigms\n   * scale\
    \ - an address size of 128 bits easily meets the need to\n     address 10**9 networks\
    \ even in the face of the inherent\n     inefficiency of address allocation for\
    \ efficient routing\n   * topological flexibility - the IPng design places no\
    \ constraints on\n     network topology except for the limit of 255 hops\n   *\
    \ performance - the simplicity of processing, the alignment of the\n     fields\
    \ in the headers, and the elimination of the header checksum\n     will allow\
    \ for high performance handling of IPng data streams\n   * robust service - IPng\
    \ includes no inhibitors to robust service and\n     the addition of packet-level\
    \ authentication allows the securing of\n     control and routing protocols without\
    \ having to have separate\n     procedures\n   * transition - the IPng transition\
    \ plan is simple and realistically\n     covers the transition methods that will\
    \ be present in the\n     marketplace\n   * media independence - IPng retains\
    \ IPv4's media independence, it may\n     be possible to make use of IPng's Flow\
    \ Label in some connection-\n     oriented media such as ATM\n   * datagram service\
    \ - IPng preserves datagram service as its basic\n     operational mode, it is\
    \ possible that the use of path MTU discovery\n     will complicate the use of\
    \ datagrams in some cases\n   * configuration ease - IPng will have easy and flexible\
    \ address\n     autoconfiguration which will support a wide variety of environments\n\
    \     from nodes on an isolated network to nodes deep in a complex\n     internet\n\
    \   * security - IPng includes specific mechanisms for authentication and\n  \
    \   encryption at the internetwork layer; the security features do rely\n    \
    \ on the presence of a yet to be defined key management system\n   * unique names\
    \ - IPng addresses may be used as globally unique names\n     although they do\
    \ have topological significance\n   * access to standards - all of the IPng standards\
    \ will be published\n     as RFCs with unlimited distribution\n   * multicast\
    \ support - IPng specifically includes multicast support\n   * extensibility -\
    \ the use of extension headers and an expandable\n     header option feature will\
    \ allow the introduction of new features\n     into IPng when needed in a way\
    \ that minimizes the disruption of the\n     existing network\n   * service classes\
    \ - the IPng header includes a Flow Label which may\n     be used to differentiate\
    \ requested service classes\n   * mobility - the proposed IPv4 mobility functions\
    \ will work with IPng\n   * control protocol - IPng includes the familiar IPv4\
    \ control protocol\n     features\n   * tunneling support - encapsulation of IPng\
    \ or other protocols within\n     IPng is a basic capability described in the\
    \ IPng specifications\n"

- title: 12. IPv6 Overview
  contents:
  - "12. IPv6 Overview\n   IPv6 is a new version of the Internet Protocol, it has\
    \ been designed\n   as an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, step from IPv4.\n\
    \   Functions which are generally seen as working in IPv4 were kept in\n   IPv6.\
    \  Functions which don't work or are infrequently used were\n   removed or made\
    \ optional.  A few new features were added where the\n   functionality was felt\
    \ to be necessary.\n   The important features of IPv6 include: [Hinden94c]\n \
    \  * expanded addressing and routing capabilities - The IP address size\n    \
    \ is increased from 32 bits to 128 bits providing support for a much\n     greater\
    \ number of addressable nodes, more levels of addressing\n     hierarchy, and\
    \ simpler auto-configuration of addresses.\n     The scaleability of multicast\
    \ routing is improved by adding a\n     \"scope\" field to multicast addresses.\n\
    \     A new type of address, called a \"cluster address\" is defined to\n    \
    \ identify topological regions rather than individual nodes.  The use\n     of\
    \ cluster addresses in conjunction with the IPv6 source route\n     capability\
    \ allows nodes additional control over the path their\n     traffic takes.\n \
    \  * simplified header format - Some IPv4 header fields have been\n     dropped\
    \ or made optional to reduce the common-case processing cost\n     of packet handling\
    \ and to keep the bandwidth overhead of the IPv6\n     header as low as possible\
    \ in spite of the increased size of the\n     addresses.  Even though the IPv6\
    \ addresses are four time longer\n     than the IPv4 addresses, the IPv6 header\
    \ is only twice the size of\n     the IPv4 header.\n   * support for extension\
    \ headers and options - IPv6 options are placed\n     in separate headers that\
    \ are located in the packet between the IPv6\n     header and the transport-layer\
    \ header.  Since most IPv6 option\n     headers are not examined or processed\
    \ by any router along a\n     packet's delivery path until it arrives at its final\
    \ destination,\n     this organization facilitates a major improvement in router\n\
    \     performance for packets containing options.  Another improvement is\n  \
    \   that unlike IPv4, IPv6 options can be of arbitrary length and not\n     limited\
    \ to 40 bytes. This feature plus the manner in which they are\n     processed,\
    \ permits IPv6 options to be used for functions which were\n     not practical\
    \ in IPv4.\n     A key extensibility feature of IPv6 is the ability to encode,\n\
    \     within an option, the action which a router or host should perform\n   \
    \  if the option is unknown. This permits the incremental deployment\n     of\
    \ additional functionality into an operational network with a\n     minimal danger\
    \ of disruption.\n   * support for authentication and privacy - IPv6 includes\
    \ the\n     definition of an extension which provides support for\n     authentication\
    \ and data integrity. This extension is included as a\n     basic element of IPv6\
    \ and support for it will be required in all\n     implementations.\n     IPv6\
    \ also includes the definition of an extension to support\n     confidentiality\
    \ by means of encryption.  Support for this extension\n     will be strongly encouraged\
    \ in all implementations.\n   * support for autoconfiguration - IPv6 supports\
    \ multiple forms of\n     autoconfiguration, from \"plug and play\" configuration\
    \ of node\n     addresses on an isolated network to the full-featured facilities\n\
    \     offered by DHCP.\n   * support for source routes - IPv6 includes an extended\
    \ function\n     source routing header designed to support the Source Demand Routing\n\
    \     Protocol (SDRP). The purpose of SDRP is to support source-initiated\n  \
    \   selection of routes to complement the route selection provided by\n     existing\
    \ routing protocols for both inter-domain and intra-domain\n     routes. [Estrin94b]\n\
    \   * simple and flexible transition from IPv4 - The IPv6 transition plan\n  \
    \   is aimed at meeting four basic requirements: [Gillig94a]\n     - Incremental\
    \ upgrade.  Existing installed IPv4 hosts and routers\n       may be upgraded\
    \ to IPv6 at any time without being dependent on\n       any other hosts or routers\
    \ being upgraded.\n     - Incremental deployment.  New IPv6 hosts and routers\
    \ can be\n       installed at any time without any prerequisites.\n     - Easy\
    \ Addressing.  When existing installed IPv4 hosts or routers\n       are upgraded\
    \ to IPv6, they may continue to use their existing\n       address.  They do not\
    \ need to be assigned new addresses.\n     - Low start-up costs.  Little or no\
    \ preparation work is needed in\n       order to upgrade existing IPv4 systems\
    \ to IPv6, or to deploy new\n       IPv6 systems.\n   * quality of service capabilities\
    \ - A new capability is added to\n     enable the labeling of packets belonging\
    \ to particular traffic\n     \"flows\" for which the sender has requested special\
    \ handling, such\n     as non-default quality of service or \"real-time\" service.\n"

    \ an\n        incompletely traversed source route), as specified in the Source\n\
    \        Route, the router should not generate an ICMP error message.\n      *\
    \ F flag -  Failure of Source Route Behavior.  If this bit it set\n        to\

    \ forwarding will be based\n        solely on the destination address. If this\
    \ bit is set to 0, it\n        indicates that if a router can not further forward\

    \ - Initialized to zero for transmission; ignored on\n        reception.\n   \
    \   * SrcRouteLen - Source Route Length - Number of source route\n        elements/hops\
    \ in the SDRP Routing header.  Length of SDRP\n        routing header can be calculated\
    \ from this value (length =\n        SrcRouteLen * 16 + 8) This field may not\
    \ exceed a value of 24.\n        (8 bit unsigned integer)\n      * NextHopPtr\
    \ - Next Hop Pointer- Index of next element/hop to be\n        processed; initialized\
    \ to 0 to point to first element/hop in the\n        source route.  When Next\
    \ Hop Pointer is equal to Source Route\n        Length then the Source Route is\
    \ completed.  (8 bit unsigned\n        integer)\n      * Strict/Loose Bit Mask\
    \ - The Strict/Loose Bit Mask is used when\n        making a forwarding decision.\
    \ If the value of the Next Hop\n        Pointer field is N, and the N-th bit in\
    \ the Strict/Loose Bit\n        Mask field is set to 1, it indicates that the\
    \ next hop is a\n        Strict Source Route Hop. If this bit is set to 0, it\
    \ indicates\n        that the next hop is a Loose Source Route Hop. (24 bit\n\
    \        bitpattern)\n      * Source Route - A list of IPv6 addresses indicating\
    \ the path that\n        this packet should follow.  A Source Route can contain\
    \ an\n        arbitrary intermix of unicast and cluster addresses. (integral\n\
    \        multiple of 128 bits)\n   12.2.4 Fragment Header\n      The Fragment\
    \ header is used by an IPv6 source to send payloads\n      larger than would fit\
    \ in the path MTU to their destinations.\n      (Note: unlike IPv4, fragmentation\
    \ in IPv6 is performed only by\n      source nodes, not by routers along a packet's\
    \ delivery path)  The\n      Fragment header is identified by a Next Header value\
    \ of 44 in the\n      immediately preceding header, and has the following format:\n\
    \      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   \
    \   |  Next Header  |   Reserved    |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \ Next Header - Identifies the type of header immediately\n        following the\
    \ Fragment header.  Uses the same values as the IPv4\n        Protocol field.\
    \ (8 bit selector)\n      * Reserved, Res - Initialized to zero for transmission;\
    \ ignored on\n        reception.\n      * Fragment Offset - The offset, in 8-octet\
    \ units, of the following\n        payload, relative to the start of the original,\
    \ unfragmented\n        payload. (13-bit unsigned integer)\n      * M flag - 1\
    \ = more fragments; 0 = last fragment.\n      * Identification - A value assigned\
    \ to the original payload that\n        is different than that of any other fragmented\
    \ payload sent\n        recently with the same IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination\n\
    \        Address, and Fragment Next Header value.  (If a Routing header\n    \
    \    is present, the IPv6 Destination Address is that of the final\n        destination.)\
    \  The Identification value is carried in the\n        Fragment header of all\
    \ of the original payload's fragments, and\n        is used by the destination\
    \ to identify all fragments belonging\n        to the same original payload. \
    \ (32 bit field)\n   12.2.5 Authentication Header\n      The Authentication header\
    \ is used to provide authentication and\n      integrity assurance for IPv6 packets.\
    \  Non-repudiation may be\n      provided by an authentication algorithm used\
    \ with the\n      Authentication header, but it is not provided with all\n   \
    \   authentication algorithms that might be used with this header.\n      The\
    \ Authentication header is identified by a Next Header value of\n      51 in the\
    \ immediately preceding header, and has the following\n      format:\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \      * Next Header - Identifies the type of header immediately\n        following\
    \ the Authentication header.  Uses the same values as\n        the IPv4 Protocol\
    \ field. (8-bit selector)\n      * Auth Data Len - Length of the Authentication\
    \ Data field in 8-\n        octet units. (8-bit unsigned integer)\n      * Reserved\
    \ - Initialized to zero for transmission; ignored on\n        reception.\n   \
    \   * Security Assoc. ID - When combined with the IPv6 Source Address,\n     \
    \   identifies to the receiver(s) the pre-established security\n        association\
    \ to which this packet belongs. (32 bit field)\n      * Authentication Data -\
    \   Algorithm-specific information required\n        to authenticate the source\
    \ of the packet and assure its\n        integrity, as specified for the pre-established\
    \ security\n        association. (Variable-length field, an integer multiple of\
    \ 8\n        octets long.)\n   12.2.6 Privacy Header\n      The Privacy Header\
    \ seeks to provide confidentiality and integrity\n      by encrypting data to\
    \ be protected and placing the encrypted data\n      in the data portion of the\
    \ Privacy Header.  Either a transport-\n      layer (e.g., UDP or TCP) frame may\
    \ be encrypted or an entire IPv6\n      datagram may be encrypted, depending on\
    \ the user's security\n      requirements.  This encapsulating approach is necessary\
    \ to provide\n      confidentiality for the entire original datagram.  If present,\
    \ the\n      Privacy Header is always the last non-encrypted field in a packet.\n\
    \      The Privacy Header works between hosts, between a host and a\n      security\
    \ gateway, or between security gateways.  This support for\n      security gateways\
    \ permits trustworthy networks to exist without\n      the performance  and monetary\
    \ costs of security, while providing\n      security for traffic transiting untrustworthy\
    \ network segments.\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

    \   * Security Association Identifier (SAID) - Identifies the security\n     \
    \   association for this datagram.  If no security association has\n        been\
    \ established, the value of this field shall be 0x0000.  A\n        security \
    \ association is normally one-way. An authenticated\n        communications session\
    \ between two hosts will normally have two\n        SAIDs in use (one in each\
    \ direction).  The receiving host uses\n        the combination of SAID value\
    \ and originating address to\n        distinguish the correct association. (32\
    \ bit value)\n      * Initialization Vector -  This field is optional and its\
    \ value\n        depends on the SAID in use.  For example, the field may contain\n\
    \        cryptographic synchronization data for a block oriented\n        encryption\
    \ algorithm. It may also be used to contain a\n        cryptographic initialization\
    \ vector.  A Privacy Header\n        implementation will normally use the SAID\
    \ value to determine\n        whether this field is present and, if it is, the\
    \ field's size\n        and use. (presence and length dependent on SAID)\n   \
    \   * Next Header - encrypted - Identifies the type of header\n        immediately\
    \ following the Privacy header.  Uses the same values\n        as the IPv4 Protocol\
    \ field. (8 bit selector)\n      * Reserved - encrypted - Ignored on reception.\n\
    \      * Length - encrypted - Length of the Privacy Header in 8-octet\n      \
    \  units, not including the first 8 octets. (8-bit unsigned\n        integer)\n\
    \      * Protected Data - encrypted -  This field may contain an entire\n    \
    \    encapsulated IPv6 datagram, including the IPv6 header, a\n        sequence\
    \ of zero or more IPv6 options, and a transport-layer\n        payload, or it\
    \ may just be a sequence of zero or more IPv6\n        options followed by a transport-layer\
    \ payload.  (variable\n        length)\n      * trailer (Algorithm-dependent Trailer)\
    \ - encrypted - A field\n        present to support some algorithms which need\
    \ to have padding\n        (e.g., to a full cryptographic block size for block-oriented\n\
    \        encryption algorithms) or for storage of authentication data for\n  \
    \      use with a encryption algorithm that provides confidentiality\n       \
    \ without authentication.  It is present only when the algorithm\n        in use\
    \ requires such a field. (presence and length dependent on\n        SAID)\n  \
    \ 12.2.7 End-to-End Option Header\n      The End-to-End Options header is used\
    \ to carry optional\n      information that needs to be examined only by a packet's\n\
    \      destination node(s).  The End-to-End Options header is identified\n   \
    \   by a Next Header value of TBD in the immediately preceding header,\n     \
    \ and has the same format as the Hop-by-Hop Option Header except for\n      the\
    \ ability to exclude an option from the authentication integrity\n      assurance\
    \ computation.\n"

  - "15. Address Autoconfiguration\n   As data networks become more complex the need\
    \ to be able to bypass at\n   least some of the complexity and move towards \"\
    plug and play\" becomes\n   ever more acute.  The user can not be expected to\
    \ be able to\n   understand the details of the network architecture or know how\
    \ to\n   configure the network software in their host.  In the ideal case, a\n\
    \   user should be able to unpack a new computer, plug it into the local\n   network\
    \ and \"just\" have it work without requiring the entering of any\n   special\
    \ information.  Security concerns may restrict the ability to\n   offer this level\
    \ of transparent address autoconfiguration in some\n   environments but the mechanisms\
    \ must be in place to support whatever\n   level of automation which the local\
    \ environment feels comfortable\n   with.\n   The basic requirement of \"plug\
    \ and play\" operation is that a host\n   must be able to acquire an address dynamically,\
    \ either when attaching\n   to a network for the first time or when the host needs\
    \ to be\n   readdressed because the host moved or because the identity of the\n\
    \   network has changed.  There are many other functions required to\n   support\
    \ a full \"plug and play\" environment. [Berk94] Most of these\n   must be addressed\
    \ outside of the IPv6 Area but a focused effort to\n   define a host address autoconfiguration\
    \ protocol is part of the IPv6\n   process.\n   We recommend that a new Address\
    \ Autoconfiguration Working Group\n   (addrconf) be formed with Dave Katz of Cisco\
    \ Systems and Sue Thomson\n   of Bellcore as co-chairs. The purpose of this working\
    \ group is to\n   design and specify a protocol for allocating addresses dynamically\
    \ to\n   IPv6 hosts.  The address configuration protocol must be suitable for\n\
    \   a wide range of network topologies, from a simple isolated network to\n  \
    \ a sophisticated globally connected network. It should also allow for\n   varying\
    \ levels of administrative control, from completely automated\n   operation to\
    \ very tight oversight.\n   The scope of this working group is to propose a host\
    \ address\n   autoconfiguration protocol which supports the full range of\n  \
    \ topological and administrative environments in which IPv6 will be\n   used.\
    \  It is the intention that, together with IPv6 system discovery,\n   the address\
    \ autoconfiguration protocol will provide the minimal\n   bootstrapping information\
    \ necessary to enable hosts to acquire\n   further configuration information (such\
    \ as that provided by DHCP in\n   IPv4). The scope does not include router configuration\
    \ or any other\n   host configuration functions. However, it is within the scope\
    \ of the\n   working group to investigate and document the interactions between\n\
    \   this work and related functions including system discovery, DNS\n   autoregistration,\
    \ service discovery, and broader host configuration\n   issues, to facilitate\
    \ the smooth integration of these functions.\n   [Katz94a]\n   The working group\
    \ is expected to complete its work around the end of\n   1994 and disband at that\
    \ time.  The group will use \"IPv6 Address\n   Autoconfiguration Architecture\"\

    \   some of the basic issues associated with the deployment of new\n   technology\

    \ generic issues of transition and will not limit\n   itself to the upcoming transition\
    \ to IPv6 because, over time,\n   enhancements to IPv6 (IPv6ng) will be developed\

- title: 17. Other Address Families
  contents:
  - "17. Other Address Families\n   There are many environments in which there are\
    \ one or more network\n   protocols already deployed or where a significant planning\
    \ effort has\n   been undertaken to create a comprehensive network addressing\
    \ plan. In\n   such cases there may be a temptation to integrate IPv6 into the\n\
    \   environment by making use of an existing addressing plan to define\n   all\
    \ or part of the IPv6 addresses.  The advantage of doing this is\n   that it permits\
    \ unified management of address space among multiple\n   protocol families.  The\
    \ use of common addresses can help facilitate\n   transition from other protocols\
    \ to IPv6.\n   If the existing addresses are globally unique and assigned with\n\
    \   regard to network topology this may be a reasonable idea.  The IETF\n   should\
    \ work with other organizations to develop algorithms that could\n   be used to\
    \ map addresses between IPv6 and other environments.  The\n   goal for any such\
    \ mapping must be to provide an unambiguous 1 to 1\n   map between individual\
    \ addresses.\n   Suggestions have been made to develop mapping algorithms for\
    \ Novell\n   IPX addresses, some types of OSI NSAPs, E164 addresses and SNA\n\
    \   addresses.  Each of these possibilities should be carefully examined\n   to\
    \ ensure that use of such an algorithm solves more problems than it\n   creates.\
    \  In some cases it may be better to recommend either that a\n   native IPng addressing\

    \ environment. [Carpen94b]\n   We recommend that, in conjunction with other organizations,\n\

- title: 18. Impact on Other IETF Standards
  contents:
  - "18. Impact on Other IETF Standards\n   Many current IETF standards are affected\
    \ by IPv6.  At least 27 of the\n   current 51 full Internet Standards must be\
    \ revised for IPv6, along\n   with at least 6 of the 20 Draft Standards and at\
    \ least 25 of the 130\n   Proposed Standards. [Postel94]\n   In some cases the\
    \ revisions consist of simple changes to the text,\n   for example, in a number\
    \ of RFCs an IP address is referred to in\n   passing as a \"32 bit IP address\"\
    \ even though IP addresses are not\n   directly used in the protocol being defined.\
    \  All of the standards\n   track documents will have to be checked to see if\
    \ they contain such\n   references.\n   In most of the rest of the cases revisions\
    \ to the protocols,\n   including packet formats, will be required.  In many of\
    \ these cases\n   the address is just being carried as a data element and a revised\n\
    \   format with a larger field for the address will have no effect on the\n  \
    \ functional paradigm.\n   In the remaining cases some facet of the operation\
    \ of the protocol\n   will be changed as a result of IPv6.  For example, the security\
    \ and\n   source route mechanisms are fundamentally changed from IPv4 with\n \
    \  IPv6.  Protocols and applications that relied on the IPv4\n   functionality\
    \ will have to be redesigned or rethought to use the\n   equivalent function in\
    \ IPv6.\n   In a few cases this opportunity should be used to determine if some\n\
    \   of the RFCs should be moved to historic, for example EGP [Mills84]\n   and\
    \ IP over ARCNET. [Provan91]\n   The base IPng Working Group will address some\
    \ of these, existing IETF\n   working groups can work on others, while new working\
    \ groups must be\n   formed to deal with a few of them. The IPng Working Group\
    \ will be\n   responsible for defining new versions of ICMP, ARP/RARP, and UDP.\
    \  It\n   will also review RFC 1639, \"FTP Operation Over Big Address Records\n\
    \   (FOOBAR)\" [Piscit94] and RFC 1191 \"Path MTU Discovery\" [Mogul90]\n   Existing\
    \ working groups will examine revisions for some of the\n   routing protocols:\
    \ RIPv2, IS-IS, IDRP and SDRP.  A new working group\n   may be required for OSPF.\n\
    \   The existing DHCP Working Group may be able to revise DHCP and\n   examine\
    \ BOOTP.\n   A TCPng Working Group will be formed soon, and new working groups\n\
    \   will have to be formed to deal with standards such as SNMP, DNS, NTP,\n  \
    \ NETbios, OSI over TCP, Host Requirements, and Kerberos as well as\n   reviewing\
    \ most of the RFCs that define IP usage over various media.\n   In addition to\
    \ the standards track RFCs mentioned above there are\n   many Informational and\
    \ Experimental RFCs which would be affected as\n   well as numerous Internet Drafts\
    \ (and those standards track RFCs that\n   we missed).\n   We recommend that the\
    \ IESG commission a review of all standards track\n   RFCs to ensure that a full\
    \ list of affected documents is compiled. We\n   recommend that the IESG charge\
    \ current IETF working groups with the\n   task of understanding the impact of\
    \ IPv6 on their proposals and,\n   where appropriate, revise the documents to\

    \ feeling is that the IETF should not get involved in attempting to\n   define\

    \ complexity.\n   We feel that this historical tendency for the IETF to avoid\
    \ dealing\n   with APIs should be reexamined in the case of IPv6.  We feel that\
    \ in\n   a few specific cases the prevalence of a particular type of API is\n\
    \   such that  a single common solution for the modifications made\n   necessary\
    \ by IPv6 should be documented.\n   We recommend that Informational RFCs be solicited\
    \ or developed for\n   these few cases.  In particular, the Berkeley-style sockets\n\
    \   interface, the UNIX TLI and XTI interfaces, and the WINSOCK\n   interfaces\

- title: 22. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "22. Security Considerations\n   The security of the Internet has long been questioned.\
    \  It has been\n   the topic of much press coverage, many conferences and workshops.\n\
    \   Almost all of this attention has been negative, pointing out the many\n  \
    \ places where the level of possible security is far less than that\n   deemed\
    \ necessary for the current and future uses of the Internet. A\n   number of the\
    \ RFC 1550 White Papers specifically pointed out the\n   requirement to improve\
    \ the level of security available [Adam94,\n   Bell94b, Brit94, Green94, Vecchi94,\
    \ Flei94] as does \"Realizing the\n   Information Future\". [Nat94]\n   In February\
    \ of 1994, the IAB convened a workshop on security in the\n   Internet architecture.\
    \  The report of this workshop [IAB94] includes\n   an exploration of many of\
    \ the security problem areas and makes a\n   number of recommendations to improve\
    \ the level of security that the\n   Internet offers its users.\n   We feel that\
    \ an improvement in the basic level of security in the\n   Internet is vital to\
    \ its continued success.  Users must be able to\n   assume that their exchanges\
    \ are safe from tampering, diversion and\n   exposure.  Organizations that wish\
    \ to use the Internet to conduct\n   business must be able to have a high level\
    \ of confidence in the\n   identity of their correspondents and in the security\
    \ of their\n   communications.  The goal is to provide strong protection as a\
    \ matter\n   of course throughout the Internet.\n   As the IAB report points out,\
    \ many of the necessary tools are not a\n   function of the internetworking layer\
    \ of the protocol.  These higher\n   level tools could make use of strong security\
    \ features in the\n   internetworking layer if they were present. While we expect\
    \ that\n   there will be a number of special high-level security packages\n  \
    \ available for specific Internet constituencies, support for basic\n   packet-level\
    \ authentication will provide for the adoption of a much\n   needed, widespread,\
    \ security infrastructure throughout the Internet.\n   It is best to separate\
    \ the support for authentication from the\n   support for encryption.  One should\
    \ be able to use the two functions\n   independently.  There are some applications\
    \ in which authentication\n   of a corespondent is sufficient and others where\
    \ the data exchanged\n   must be kept private.\n   It is our recommendation that\
    \ IPv6 support packet authentication as a\n   basic and required function.  Applications\
    \ should be able to rely on\n   support for this feature in every IPv6 implementation.\
    \  Support for a\n   specific authentication algorithm should also be mandated\
    \ while\n   support for additional algorithms should be optional.\n   Thus we\
    \ recommend that support for the Authentication Header be\n   required in all\
    \ compliant IPv6 implementations.\n   We recommend that support for a specific\
    \ authentication algorithm be\n   required.  The specific algorithm should be\
    \ determined by the time\n   the IPv6 documents are offered as Proposed Standards.\n\
    \   We recommend that support for the Privacy Header be required in IPv6\n   implementations.\n\
    \   We recommend that support for a privacy authentication algorithm be\n   required.\
    \ The specific algorithm should be determined by the time the\n   IPv6 documents\
    \ are offered as Proposed Standards.\n   Clearly, a key management infrastructure\
    \ will be required in order to\n   enable the use of the authentication and encryption\
    \ headers.\n   However, defining such an infrastructure is outside the scope of\
    \ the\n   IPv6 effort.  We do note that there are on-going IETF activities in\n\
    \   this area. The IPv6 transition working groups must coordinate with\n   these\
    \ activities.\n   Just as clearly, the use of authentication and encryption may\
    \ add to\n   the cost and impact the performance of systems but the more secure\n\
    \   infrastructure is worth the penalty.  Whatever penalty there is\n   should\
    \ also decrease in time with improved software and hardware\n   assistance.\n\
    \   The use of firewalls is increasing on the Internet.  We hope that the\n  \
    \ presence of the authentication and privacy features in IPv6 will\n   reduce\
    \ the need for firewalls, but we do understand that they will\n   continue to\
    \ be used for the foreseeable future.  In this light, we\n   feel that clear guidance\
    \ should be given to the developers of\n   firewalls on the best ways to design\
    \ and configure them when working\n   in an IPv6 environment.\n   We recommend\
    \ that an \"IPv6 framework for firewalls\" be developed.\n   This framework should\
    \ explore the ways in which the Authentication\n   Header can be used to strengthen\
    \ firewall technology and detail how\n   the IPv6 packet should be analyzed by\
    \ a firewall.\n   Some aspects of security require additional study.  For example,\
    \ it\n   has been pointed out [Vecchi94] that, even in non-military\n   situations,\
    \ there are places where procedures to thwart traffic\n   analysis will be required.\
    \  This could be done by the use of\n   encrypted encapsulation, but this and\
    \ other similar requirements must\n   be addressed on an on-going basis by the\
    \ Security Area of the IETF.\n   The design of IPv6 must be flexible enough to\
    \ support the later\n   addition of such security features.\n   We believe that\
    \ IPv6 with its inherent security features will provide\n   the foundation upon\
    \ which the Internet can continue to expand its\n   functionality and user base.\n"

  - "Appendix A - Summary of Recommendations\n   5.3 Address Assignment Policy Recommendations\n\
    \      changes in address assignment policies are not recommended\n      reclamation\
    \ of underutilized assigned addresses is not currently\n         recommended\n\
    \      efforts to renumber significant portions of the Internet are not\n    \
    \     currently recommended\n      recommend consideration of assigning CIDR-type\
    \ address blocks out\n         of unassigned Class A addressees\n   11. IPng Recommendation\n\
    \      recommend that \"Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) Spec. (128\n    \
    \     bit ver)\" [Deering94b] be adopted as the basis for IPng\n      recommend\
    \ that the documents listed in Appendix C be the basis of\n         IPng\n   13.\
    \ IPng Working Group\n      recommend that an IPng Working Group be formed, chaired\
    \ by Steve\n         Deering and Ross Callon\n      recommend that Robert Hinden\
    \ be the document editor for the IPng\n         effort\n   14. IPng Reviewer\n\
    \      recommend that an IPng Reviewer be appointed and that Dave Clark\n    \
    \     be that reviewer\n   15. Address Autoconfiguration\n      recommend that\
    \ an Address Autoconfiguration Working Group be\n         formed, chaired by Dave\
    \ Katz and Sue Thomson\n   16.1 Transition - Short Term\n      recommend that\
    \ an IPng Transition Working Group be formed, chaired\n         by Bob Gilligan\
    \ and TBA\n   16.2 Transition - Long Term\n      recommend that the Transition\
    \ and Coexistence Including Testing\n         Working Group be chartered\n   17.\
    \ Other Address Families\n      recommend that recommendations about the use of\
    \ non-IPv6 addresses\n         in IPv6 environments and IPv6 addresses in non-IPv6\n\
    \         environments be developed\n   18. Impact on Other IETF Standards\n \
    \     recommend the IESG commission a review of all standards track RFCs\n   \
    \   recommend the IESG charge current IETF working groups with the\n         task\
    \ of understanding the impact of IPng on their proposals\n         and, where\
    \ appropriate, revise the documents to include support\n         for IPng\n  \
    \    recommend the IESG charter new working groups where required to\n       \
    \  revise other standards RFCs\n   20. APIs\n      recommend that Informational\
    \ RFCs be developed or solicited for a\n         few of the common APIs\n   21.\
    \ Future of the IPng Area and Working Groups\n      recommend that the IPng Area\
    \ and Area Directorate continue until\n         main documents are offered as\
    \ Proposed Standards in late 1994\n   22. Security Considerations\n      recommend\
    \ that support for the Authentication Header be required\n      recommend that\
    \ support for a specific authentication algorithm be\n         required\n    \
    \  recommend that support for the Privacy Header be required\n      recommend\
    \ that support for a specific privacy algorithm be\n         required\n      recommend\
    \ that an \"IPng framework for firewalls\" be developed\n"
