- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Throughout its entire history, the Internet has employed\
    \ a central\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the\n\
    \   allocation and assignment of various identifiers needed for the\n   operation\
    \ of the Internet [RFC1174].  In the case of the IPv4 address\n   space, the IANA\
    \ allocates parts of the address space to Regional\n   Internet Registries according\
    \ to their established needs.  These\n   Regional Internet Registries are responsible\
    \ for the assignment of\n   IPv4 addresses to operators and users of the Internet\
    \ within their\n   regions.\n   Minor portions of the IPv4 address space have\
    \ been allocated or\n   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized\n\
    \   purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been documented in\n   a\
    \ variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document is intended to\n   collect\
    \ these scattered references.\n   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated\
    \ by the IETF to make\n   assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process\
    \ [RFC2860].\n   Section 4 of this document describes that assignment process.\n"
- title: 2. Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks
  contents:
  - "2. Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks\n   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this\
    \ block refer to source hosts on \"this\"\n   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may\
    \ be used as a source address for this\n   host on this network; other addresses\
    \ within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to\n   refer to specified hosts on this network\
    \ [RFC1700, page 4].\n   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private\
    \ networks.\n   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within\
    \ this\n   block should not appear on the public Internet.\n   14.0.0.0/8 - This\
    \ block is set aside for assignments to the\n   international system of Public\
    \ Data Networks [RFC1700, page 181]. The\n   registry of assignments within this\
    \ block can be accessed from the\n   \"Public Data Network Numbers\" link on the\
    \ web page at\n   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.  Addresses within this block\
    \ are\n   assigned to users and should be treated as such.\n   24.0.0.0/8 - This\
    \ block was allocated in early 1996 for use in\n   provisioning IP service over\
    \ cable television systems.  Although the\n   IANA initially was involved in making\
    \ assignments to cable operators,\n   this responsibility was transferred to American\
    \ Registry for Internet\n   Numbers (ARIN) in May 2001.  Addresses within this\
    \ block are assigned\n   in the normal manner and should be treated as such.\n\
    \   39.0.0.0/8 - This block was used in the \"Class A Subnet Experiment\"\n  \
    \ that commenced in May 1995, as documented in [RFC1797].  The\n   experiment\
    \ has been completed and this block has been returned to the\n   pool of addresses\
    \ reserved for future allocation or assignment.  This\n   block therefore no longer\
    \ has a special use and is subject to\n   allocation to a Regional Internet Registry\
    \ for assignment in the\n   normal manner.\n   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned\
    \ for use as the Internet host\n   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher\
    \ level protocol to an\n   address anywhere within this block should loop back\
    \ inside the host.\n   This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32\
    \ for loopback,\n   but no addresses within this block should ever appear on any\
    \ network\n   anywhere [RFC1700, page 5].\n   128.0.0.0/16 - This block, corresponding\
    \ to the numerically lowest of\n   the former Class B addresses, was initially\
    \ and is still reserved by\n   the IANA.  Given the present classless nature of\
    \ the IP address\n   space, the basis for the reservation no longer applies and\
    \ addresses\n   in this block are subject to future allocation to a Regional Internet\n\
    \   Registry for assignment in the normal manner.\n   169.254.0.0/16 - This is\
    \ the \"link local\" block.  It is allocated for\n   communication between hosts\
    \ on a single link.  Hosts obtain these\n   addresses by auto-configuration, such\
    \ as when a DHCP server may not\n   be found.\n   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is\
    \ set aside for use in private networks.\n   Its intended use is documented in\
    \ [RFC1918].  Addresses within this\n   block should not appear on the public\
    \ Internet.\n   191.255.0.0/16 - This block, corresponding to the numerically\
    \ highest\n   to the former Class B addresses, was initially and is still reserved\n\
    \   by the IANA.  Given the present classless nature of the IP address\n   space,\
    \ the basis for the reservation no longer applies and addresses\n   in this block\
    \ are subject to future allocation to a Regional Internet\n   Registry for assignment\
    \ in the normal manner.\n   192.0.0.0/24 - This block, corresponding to the numerically\
    \ lowest of\n   the former Class C addresses, was initially and is still reserved\
    \ by\n   the IANA.  Given the present classless nature of the IP address\n   space,\
    \ the basis for the reservation no longer applies and addresses\n   in this block\
    \ are subject to future allocation to a Regional Internet\n   Registry for assignment\
    \ in the normal manner.\n   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as \"TEST-NET\"\
    \ for use in\n   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction\
    \ with\n   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol\n  \
    \ documentation.  Addresses within this block should not appear on the\n   public\
    \ Internet.\n   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay\n\
    \   anycast addresses, according to [RFC3068].\n   192.168.0.0/16 - This block\
    \ is set aside for use in private networks.\n   Its intended use is documented\
    \ in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this\n   block should not appear on the public\
    \ Internet.\n   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark\n\
    \   tests of network interconnect devices.  Its use is documented in\n   [RFC2544].\n\
    \   223.255.255.0/24 - This block, corresponding to the numerically\n   highest\
    \ of the former Class C addresses, was initially and is still\n   reserved by\
    \ the IANA.  Given the present classless nature of the IP\n   address space, the\
    \ basis for the reservation no longer applies and\n   addresses in this block\
    \ are subject to future allocation to a\n   Regional Internet Registry for assignment\
    \ in the normal manner.\n   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class\
    \ D address\n   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.\n\
    \   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in\n   [RFC3171].\n\
    \   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address\n   space,\
    \ is reserved.  The \"limited broadcast\" destination address\n   255.255.255.255\
    \ should never be forwarded outside the (sub-)net of\n   the source.  The remainder\
    \ of this space is reserved for future use.\n   [RFC1700, page 4]\n"

- title: 4. Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses
  contents:
  - "4. Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses\n   The IANA has responsibility\
    \ for making assignments of protocol\n   parameters used in the Internet according\
    \ to the requirements of the\n   \"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the\
    \ Technical Work of the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\" [RFC2860]. \
    \ Among other things,\n   [RFC2860] requires that protocol parameters be assigned\
    \ according to\n   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,\n\
    \   Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice\n   documents,\
    \ and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.\n   The domain name and IP\
    \ address spaces involve policy issues (in\n   addition to technical issues) so\
    \ that the requirements of [RFC2860]\n   do not apply generally to those spaces.\
    \  Nonetheless, the IANA is\n   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses\
    \ as needed in\n   support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion\
    \ of the\n   IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical\n\
    \   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be\n   described\
    \ [RFC2434].  Immediately before the RFC is published, the\n   IANA will, in consultation\
    \ with the Regional Internet Registries,\n   make the necessary assignment and\
    \ notify the RFC Editor of the\n   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.\n\
    \   As required by [RFC2860], the IANA will also make necessary\n   experimental\
    \ assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation with\n   the Regional Internet\
    \ Registries.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The particular assigned values of special-use\
    \ IPv4 addresses\n   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security\
    \ issues.\n   However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse\
    \ of\n   these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from\n\
    \   the 10.0.0.0/8 block originate within your subnet, all border routers\n  \
    \ should filter such packets that originate from elsewhere.  Attacks\n   have\
    \ been mounted that depend on the unexpected use of some of these\n   addresses.\n"
