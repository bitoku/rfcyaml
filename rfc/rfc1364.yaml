    \ designing\n   Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR) that will run BGP [RFC1267]\n\
    \   with other ASBRs external to the AS, and OSPF [RFC1247] as its IGP.\n   This\
    \ document defines how the following fields in OSPF and attributes\n   in BGP\
    \ are to be set when interfacing between BGP and OSPF at an\n   ASBR:\n      OSPF\
    \ cost and type      vs. BGP INTER-AS METRIC\n      OSPF tag                vs.\
    \ BGP ORIGIN and AS_PATH\n      OSPF Forwarding Address vs. BGP NEXT_HOP\n   For\
    \ a more general treatise on routing and route exchange problems,\n   please refer\
    \ to [ROUTE-LEAKING] and [NEXT-HOP] by Philip Almquist.\n   This document uses\
    \ the two terms \"Autonomous System\" and \"Routing\n   Domain\".  The definitions\
    \ for the two are below:\n   The term Autonomous System is the same as is used\
    \ in the BGP-3 RFC\n   [RFC1267], given below:\n      \"The use of the term Autonomous\
    \ System here stresses the fact\n      that, even when multiple IGPs and metrics\
    \ are used, the\n      administration of an AS appears to other ASs to have a\
    \ single\n      coherent interior routing plan and presents a consistent picture\n\
    \      of what networks are reachable through it.  From the standpoint of\n  \
    \    exterior routing, an AS can be viewed as monolithic: reachability\n     \
    \ to networks directly connected to the AS must be equivalent from\n      all\
    \ border gateways of the AS.\"\n   The term Routing Domain was first used in [ROUTE-LEAKING]\
    \ and is\n   given below:\n      \"A Routing Domain is a collection of routers\
    \ which coordinate\n      their routing knowledge using a single (instance of)\
    \ a routing\n      protocol.\"\n"

  - "2.  Route Exchange\n   This section discusses the constraints that must be met\
    \ to exchange\n   routes between an external BGP session with a peer from another\
    \ AS\n   and internal OSPF routes.\n   BGP does not carry subnet information in\
    \ routing updates.  Therefore,\n   when referring to a subnetted network in the\
    \ OSPF routing domain, we\n   consider the equivalent network route in the context\
    \ of BGP.\n   Multiple subnet routes for a subnetted network in OSPF are collapsed\n\
    \   into one network route when exported into BGP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Exporting OSPF routes into BGP
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Exporting OSPF routes into BGP\n  1.   The administrator must be able to\
    \ selectively export routes\n       into BGP via an appropriate filter mechanism.\n\
    \       This filter mechanism must support such control with the\n       granularity\
    \ of a single network.\n       Additionally, the administrator must be able to\
    \ filter based\n       on the OSPF tag and the various sub-fields of the OSPF\
    \ tag.\n       The settings of the tag and the sub-fields are defined in\n   \
    \    section 4 in more detail.\n       o    By default, no routes must be exported\
    \ from OSPF into\n            BGP.  A single mechanism must permit all OSPF inter-area\n\
    \            and intra-area routes to be exported into BGP.\n       OSPF external\
    \ routes of type 1 and type 2 must never be\n       exported into BGP unless they\
    \ are explicitly configured.\n  2.   When configured to export a network, the\
    \ ASBR must advertise\n       a network route for a subnetted network, as long\
    \ as at least\n       one subnet in the subnetted network is reachable via OSPF.\n\
    \  3.   The network administrator must be able to statically\n       configure\
    \ the BGP attribute INTER-AS METRIC to be used for\n       any network route.\n\
    \       o    By default, the INTER_AS METRIC must default to 1.\n       Explanatory\
    \ text: The OSPF cost and the BGP INTER-AS METRIC\n       are of different widths.\
    \  The OSPF cost is a two level\n       metric.  The BGP INTER-AS METRIC is only\
    \ an optional non-\n       transitive attribute.  Hence, a more complex BGP INTER-AS\n\
    \       METRIC-OSPF cost mapping scheme is not necessary.\n   4.   When an ASBR\
    \ is advertising an OSPF route to network Y to\n        external BGP neighbours\
    \ and learns that the route has become\n        unreachable, the ASBR must immediately\
    \ propogate this\n        information to the external BGP neighbours.\n   5. \
    \  An implementation of BGP and OSPF on an ASBR must have a\n        mechanism\
    \ to set up a minimum amount of time that must elapse\n        between the learning\
    \ of a new route via OSPF and subsequent\n        advertisement of the route via\
    \ BGP to the external\n        neighbours.\n        o    The default value for\
    \ this setting must be 0, indicating\n             that the route is to be advertised\
    \ to the neighbour BGP\n             peers instantly.\n             Note that\
    \ [RFC1267] mandates a mechanism to dampen the\n             inbound advertisements\
    \ from adjacent neighbours.\n"

  - "2.2.  Importing BGP routes into OSPF\n   1.   BGP implementations should allow\
    \ an AS to control\n        announcements of BGP-learned routes into OSPF.\n \
    \       Implementations should support such control with the\n        granularity\
    \ of a single network.  Implementations should also\n        support such control\
    \ with the granularity of an autonomous\n        system, where the autonomous\
    \ system may be either the\n        autonomous system that originated the route\
    \ or the autonomous\n        system that advertised the route to the local system\n\
    \        (adjacent autonomous system).\n         o    By default, no routes must\
    \ be imported from BGP into\n              OSPF.  Administrators must configure\
    \ every route they\n              wish to import.\n              A mechanism may\
    \ allow an administrator to configure an\n              ASBR to import all the\
    \ BGP routes into the OSPF routing\n              domain.\n   2.   The administrator\
    \ must be able to configure the OSPF cost and\n        the OSPF metric type of\
    \ every route imported into OSPF.\n        o    The OSPF cost must default to\
    \ 1; the OSPF metric type\n             must default to type 2.\n   3.   Routes\
    \ learned via IBGP must not be imported into OSPF.\n   4.   The ASBR must never\
    \ generate a default route into the OSPF\n        routing domain unless explicitly\
    \ configured to do so.\n        A possible criterion for generating default into\
    \ an IGP is to\n        allow the administrator to specify a set of (network route,\n\
    \        AS_PATH, default route cost, default route type) tuples.  If\n      \
    \  the ASBR learns of the network route for an element of the\n        set, with\
    \ the corresponding AS_PATH, then it generates a\n        default route into the\
    \ OSPF routing domain, with cost\n        \"default route cost\" and type, \"\
    default route type\".  The\n        lowest cost default route will then be injected\
    \ into the OSPF\n        routing domain.\n        This is the recommended method\
    \ for originating default routes\n        in the OSPF routing domain.\n"

    \ RT1 or RT2 to forward\n   packets to network X and hence build the correct AS_PATH\
    \ to advertise\n   to other external speakers.\n   More precisely, RT3 must use\
    \ the AS_PATH of the route announced by\n   the ASBR, whose BGP Identifier is\
    \ the same as the OSPF routerID\n   corresponding to its route for network X.\n\
    \      ii.  It will be convenient for the network administrator looking at\n \
    \          an ASBR to correlate different BGP and OSPF routes based on\n     \
    \      the identifier.\n"

    \ [RFC1247]\n   OSPF imports information from various routing protocols at all\
    \ its\n   ASBRs.  In some instances, it is possible to use protocols other than\n\
    \   EGP or BGP across autonomous systems.  It is important, in BGP, to\n   differentiate\
    \ between routes that are external to the OSPF routing\n   domain but must be\
    \ considered internal to the AS, as opposed to\n   routes that are external to\
    \ the AS.\n   Routes that are internal to the AS and that may or may not be\n\
    \   external to the OSPF routing domain will not come to the various BGP\n   speakers\
    \ via IBGP.  Therefore, ASBRs running BGP must have knowledge\n   of this class\
    \ of routes so that they can advertise these routes to\n   the various external\
    \ AS without waiting for IBGP updates about these\n   routes.\n   Additionally,\
    \ in the specific instance of an AS intermixing routers\n   running EGP and BGP\
    \ as external gateway routing protocols, using OSPF\n   as an IGP, the network\

  - "5.  Setting OSPF Forwarding Address and BGP NEXT_HOP attribute\n   Forwarding\
    \ addresses are used to avoid extra hops between multiple\n   routers that share\
    \ a common network and that speak different routing\n   protocols with each other.\n\
    \   Both BGP and OSPF have equivalents of forwarding addresses.  In BGP,\n   the\
    \ NEXT_HOP attribute is a well-known, mandatory attribute.  OSPF\n   has a Forwarding\
    \ address field.  We will discuss how these are to be\n   filled in various situations.\n\
    \   Consider the 4 router situation below:\n   RT1 and RT2 are in one autonomous\
    \ system, RT3 and RT4 are in another.\n   RT1 and RT3 are talking BGP with each\
    \ other.\n   RT3 and RT4 are talking OSPF with each other.\n           +-----+\

    \ OSPF:\n        Consider an external network X, learnt via BGP from RT1.\n  \
    \      RT3 must always fill the OSPF Forwarding Address with the BGP\n       \
    \ NEXT_HOP attribute for the route to network X.\n   - Exporting network Y to\
    \ BGP:\n        Consider a network Y, internal to the OSPF routing domain,\n \
    \       RT3's route to network Y is via RT4, and network Y is to be\n        exported\
    \ via BGP to RT1.\n        If network Y is not a subnetted network, RT3 must fill\
    \ the\n        NEXT_HOP attribute for network Y with the address of RT4.\n   \
    \     This is to avoid requiring packets to take an extra hop\n        through\
    \ RT3 when traversing the AS boundary.  This is similar\n        to the concept\
    \ of indirect neighbour support in EGP [RFC888,\n        RFC827].\n"
