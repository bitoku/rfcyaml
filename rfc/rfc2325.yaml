  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information\
    \ Base\n   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet\n \
    \  community.  In particular, it defines objects for the management of\n   coffee-brewing\
    \ and maintenance devices.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n           describing\
    \ and naming objects for the purpose of management.\n      o    STD 17, RFC 1213\
    \ [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n           objects for the Internet\
    \ suite of protocols.\n      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative\
    \ and other\n           architectural aspects of the framework.\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network\n           access to managed\
    \ objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named\n   by\
    \ an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The\n   object type\
    \ together with an object instance serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific\
    \ instantiation of the object.  For human\n   convenience, we often use a textual\
    \ string, termed the descriptor, to\n   refer to the object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   The COFFEE POT MIB applies to managed devices that brew, store,\
    \ and\n   deliver heated coffee beverages. The COFFEE POT MIB is mandatory for\n\
    \   all systems that have such a hardware port supporting services\n   managed\
    \ through some other MIB.\n   The MIB contains objects that relate to physical\
    \ connections,\n   configuration, storage levels, availabilty, quality of service,\
    \ and\n   availability.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Relationship to Interface MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Relationship to Interface MIB\n   The COFFEE-POT-MIB is one of many MIBs\
    \ designed for layered use as\n   described in the Interface MIB [5].  In most\
    \ implementations where it\n   is present, it will be in the lowest interface\
    \ sublayer, that is, the\n   COFFEE-POT-MIB represents the physical layer, providing\
    \ service to\n   higher layers such as the Character MIB [6].\n   Although it\
    \ is unlikely that a coffee port will actually be used as a\n   network interface,\
    \ which is the intent of the Interface MIB, the\n   COFFEE-POT-MIB is closely\
    \ connected to the Character MIB, which can\n   share hardware interfaces with\
    \ network operation, and relate to the\n   RS-232 MIB [7].\n   The Interface MIB's\
    \ ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not\n   relevant to the COFFEE-POT-MIB.\n\
    \   The COFFEE-POT-MIB is relevant for ifType values sip(31), and perhaps\n  \
    \ others.\n   The COFFEE-POT-MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup,\n\
    \   and ifFixedLengthGroup.\n   Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends\
    \ on the octet\n   counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.\n"
