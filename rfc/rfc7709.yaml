  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3471]\n\
    \   [RFC3945] includes an architecture and a set of control-plane\n   protocols\
    \ that can be used to operate data networks ranging from\n   packet-switch-capable\
    \ networks, through those networks that use Time\n   Division Multiplexing, to\
    \ WDM networks.  The Path Computation Element\n   (PCE) architecture [RFC4655]\
    \ defines functional components that can\n   be used to compute and suggest appropriate\
    \ paths in connection-\n   oriented traffic-engineered networks.  Additional wavelength\
    \ switched\n   optical networks (WSON) considerations were defined in [RFC6163].\n\
    \   This document refers to the same general framework and technologies,\n   but\
    \ it adds requirements related to expediting LSP setup under heavy\n   connection\
    \ churn scenarios, while achieving low blocking under an\n   overall distributed\
    \ control plane.  This document focuses on a\n   specific problem space -- high-capacity\
    \ and highly dynamic connection\n   request scenarios -- that may require clarification\
    \ and or extensions\n   to current GMPLS protocols and procedures.  In particular,\
    \ the\n   purpose of this document is to address the potential need for\n   protocols\
    \ and procedures that enable expediting the setup of LSPs in\n   high-churn scenarios.\
    \  Both single-domain and multi-domain network\n   scenarios are considered.\n\
    \   This document focuses on the following two topics: 1) the driving\n   applications\
    \ and main characteristics and requirements of this\n   problem space, and 2)\
    \ the key requirements that may be novel with\n   respect to current GMPLS protocols.\n\
    \   This document presents the objectives and related requirements for\n   GMPLS\
    \ to provide the control for networks operating with such\n   performance requirements.\
    \  While specific deployment scenarios are\n   considered part of the presentation\
    \ of objectives, the stated\n   requirements are aimed at ensuring the control\
    \ protocols are not the\n   limiting factor in achieving a particular network's\
    \ performance.\n   Implementation dependencies are out of scope of this document.\n\
    \   Other documents may be needed to define how GMPLS protocols meet the\n   requirements\
    \ laid out in this document.  Such future documents may\n   define extensions\
    \ or simply clarify how existing mechanisms may be\n   used to address the key\
    \ requirements of highly dynamic networks.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Core\
    \ Optical\n   Networks (CORONET) program [Chiu] is an example target environment\n\
    \   that includes IP and optical commercial and government networks, with\n  \
    \ a focus on highly dynamic and resilient multi-terabit core networks.\n   It\
    \ anticipates the need for rapid (sub-second) setup and SONET/SDH-\n   like restoration\
    \ times for high-churn (up to tens of requests per\n   second network wide and\
    \ holding times as short as one second) on-\n   demand wavelength, sub-wavelength,\
    \ and packet services for a variety\n   of applications (e.g., grid computing,\
    \ cloud computing, data\n   visualization, fast data transfer, etc.).  This must\
    \ be done while\n   meeting stringent call-blocking requirements and while minimizing\
    \ the\n   use of resources such as time slots, switch ports, wavelength\n   conversion,\
    \ etc.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   The motivation for this document, and envisioned related future\n\
    \   documents, is two-fold:\n   1.  The anticipated need for rapid setup, while\
    \ maintaining low\n       blocking, of large bandwidth and highly churned on-demand\n\
    \       connections (in the form of sub-wavelengths, e.g., OTN ODUx, and\n   \
    \    wavelengths, e.g., OTN OCh) for a variety of applications\n       including\
    \ grid computing, cloud computing, data visualization,\n       and intra- and\
    \ inter-datacenter communications.\n   2.  The ability to set up circuit-like\
    \ LSPs for large bandwidth flows\n       with low setup delays provides an alternative\
    \ to packet-based\n       solutions implemented over static circuits that may\
    \ require tying\n       up more expensive and power-consuming resources (e.g.,\
    \ router\n       ports).  Reducing the LSP setup delay will reduce the minimum\n\
    \       bandwidth threshold at which a GMPLS circuit approach is\n       preferred\
    \ over a layer 3 (e.g., IP) approach.  Dynamic circuit\n       and virtual circuit\
    \ switching intrinsically provide guaranteed\n       bandwidth, guaranteed low-latency\
    \ and jitter, and faster\n       restoration, all of which are very hard to provide\
    \ in packet-only\n       networks.  Again, a key element in achieving these benefits\
    \ is\n       enabling the fastest possible circuit setup times.\n   Future applications\
    \ are expected to require setup times that are as\n   fast as 100 ms in highly\
    \ dynamic, national-scale network environments\n   while meeting stringent blocking\
    \ requirements and minimizing the use\n   of resources such as switch ports, wavelength\
    \ converters/\n   regenerators, and other network design parameters.  Of course,\
    \ the\n   benefits of low setup delay diminish for connections with long\n   holding\
    \ times.  For some specific applications, a trade-off may be\n   required, as\
    \ the need for rapid setup may be more important than\n   their requirements for\
    \ other features currently provided in GMPLS\n   (e.g., robustness against setup\
    \ errors).\n   With the advent of data centers, cloud computing, video, gaming,\n\
    \   mobile and other broadband applications, it is anticipated that\n   connection\
    \ request rates may increase, even for connections with\n   longer holding times,\
    \ either during limited time periods (such as\n   during the restoration from\
    \ a data center failure) or over the longer\n   term, to the point where the current\
    \ GMPLS procedures of path\n   computation/selection and resource allocation may\
    \ not be timely, thus\n   leading to increased blocking or increased resource\
    \ cost.  Thus,\n   extensions of GMPLS signaling and routing protocols (e.g.,\
    \ OSPF-TE)\n   may also be needed to address heavy churn of connection requests\n\
    \   (i.e., high-connection-request arrival rate) in networks with high-\n   traffic\
    \ loads, even for connections with relatively longer holding\n   times.\n"
- title: 4.  Driving Applications and Their Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Driving Applications and Their Requirements\n   There are several emerging\
    \ applications that fall under the problem\n   space addressed here in several\
    \ service areas such as provided by\n   telecommunication carriers, government\
    \ networks, enterprise networks,\n   content providers, and cloud providers. \
    \ Such applications include\n   research and education networks / grid computing,\
    \ and cloud\n   computing.  Detailing and standardizing protocols to address these\n\
    \   applications will expedite the transition to commercial deployment.\n   In\
    \ the target environment, there are multiple Bandwidth-on-Demand\n   service requests\
    \ per second, such as might arise as cloud services\n   proliferate.  It includes\
    \ dynamic services with connection setup\n   requirements that range from seconds\
    \ to milliseconds.  The aggregate\n   traffic demand, which is composed of both\
    \ packet (IP) and circuit\n   (wavelength and sub-wavelength) services, represents\
    \ a five to\n   twenty-fold increase over today's traffic levels for the largest\
    \ of\n   any individual carrier.  Thus, the aggressive requirements must be\n\
    \   met with solutions that are scalable, cost effective, and power\n   efficient,\
    \ while providing the desired quality of service (QoS).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Key Application Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Key Application Requirements\n   There are two key performance-scaling\
    \ requirements in the target\n   environment that are the main drivers behind\
    \ this document:\n   1.  Connection request rates ranging from a few requests\
    \ per second\n       for high-capacity (e.g., 40 Gb/s, 100 Gb/s) wavelength-based\
    \ LSPs\n       to around 100 requests per second for sub-wavelength LSPs (e.g.,\n\
    \       OTN ODU0, ODU1, and ODU2).\n   2.  Connection setup delay of around 100\
    \ ms across a national or\n       regional network.  To meet this target, assuming\
    \ pipelined cross-\n       connection and worst-case propagation delay and hop\
    \ count, it is\n       estimated that the maximum processing delay per hop is\
    \ around 700\n       microseconds [Lehmen].  Optimal path selection and resource\n\
    \       allocation may require somewhat longer processing (up to 5\n       milliseconds)\
    \ in either the destination or source nodes and\n       possibly tighter processing\
    \ delays (around 500 microseconds) in\n       intermediate nodes.\n   The model\
    \ for a national network is that of the continental US with\n   up to 100 nodes\
    \ and LSPs with distances up to ~3000 km and up to 15\n   hops.\n   A connection\
    \ setup delay is defined here as the time between the\n   arrival of a connection\
    \ request at an ingress edge switch -- or more\n   generally a Label Switch Router\
    \ (LSR) -- and the time at which\n   information can start flowing from that ingress\
    \ switch over that\n   connection.  Note that this definition is more inclusive\
    \ than the LSP\n   setup time defined in [RFC5814] and [RFC6777], which do not\
    \ include\n   PCE path computation delays.\n"
- title: 5.  Requirements for Very Fast Setup of GMPLS LSPs
  contents:
  - "5.  Requirements for Very Fast Setup of GMPLS LSPs\n   This section lists the\
    \ protocol requirements for very fast setup of\n   GMPLS LSPs in order to adequately\
    \ support the service characteristics\n   described in the previous sections.\
    \  These requirements may be the\n   basis for future documents, some of which\
    \ may be simply\n   informational, while others may describe specific GMPLS protocol\n\
    \   extensions.  While some of these requirements may have implications\n   on\
    \ implementations, the intent is for the requirements to apply to\n   GMPLS protocols\
    \ and their standardized mechanisms.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Protocol and Procedure Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Protocol and Procedure Requirements\n   R1  The portion of the LSP establishment\
    \ time related to protocol\n       processing should scale linearly based on the\
    \ number of traversed\n       nodes.\n   R2  End-to-end LSP data path availability\
    \ should be bounded by the\n       worst-case single-node data path establishment\
    \ time.  In other\n       words, pipelined cross-connect processing as discussed\
    \ in\n       [RFC6383] should be enabled.\n   R3  LSP establishment time shall\
    \ depend on the number of nodes\n       supporting an LSP and link propagation\
    \ delays and not on any off\n       (control) path transactions, e.g., PCC-PCE\
    \ and PCC-PCC\n       communications at the time of connection setup, even when\
    \ PCE-\n       based approaches are used.\n   R4  LSP holding times as short as\
    \ one second must be supported.\n   R5  The protocol aspects of LSP signaling\
    \ must not preclude LSP\n       request rates of tens per second.\n   R6  The\
    \ above requirements should be met even when there are failures\n       in connection\
    \ establishment, i.e., LSPs should be established\n       faster than when crank-back\
    \ is used.\n   R7  These requirements are applicable even when an LSP crosses\
    \ one or\n       more administrative domains/boundaries.\n   R8  The above are\
    \ additional requirements and do not replace existing\n       requirements, e.g.,\
    \ alarm-free setup and teardown, recovery, or\n       inter-domain confidentiality.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Being able to support very fast setup and a high-churn\
    \ rate of GMPLS\n   LSPs is not expected to adversely affect the underlying security\n\
    \   issues associated with existing GMPLS signaling.  If encryption that\n   requires\
    \ key exchange is intended to be used on the signaled LSPs,\n   then this requirement\
    \ needs to be included as a part of the protocol\n   design process, as the usual\
    \ extra round-trip time (RTT) for key\n   exchange will have an effect on the\
    \ setup and churn rate of the GMPLS\n   LSPs.  It is possible to amortize the\
    \ costs of key exchange over\n   multiple exchanges (if those occur between the\
    \ same peers) so that\n   some exchanges need not cost a full RTT and operate\
    \ in so-called\n   zero-RTT mode.\n"
