- title: 3.  Short Overview of the Fibre Channel
  contents:
  - "3.  Short Overview of the Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically\
    \ a bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high\
    \ performance capability.  The\n   Fibre Channel provides a general transport\
    \ vehicle for higher level\n   protocols such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface\
    \ (IPI) and Small\n   Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance\n\
    \   Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE\n  \
    \ 802.2, and others.\n   Physically, the Fibre Channel is an interconnection of\
    \ multiple\n   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by\
    \ a\n   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n\
    \   Fibre Channel \"node\" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n  \
    \ consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are\n   switches. \
    \ An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.\
    \  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single\n   port on a switch via an\
    \ \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch port\n   is called an FL_Port, and\
    \ the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n   term Nx_Port refers to either\
    \ an N_Port or an NL_port.  The term\n   Fx_Port refers to either an F_Port or\
    \ an FL_port.  A switch port,\n   which is interconnected to another switch port\
    \ via an Inter Element\n   Link (IEL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects\
    \ a bridge device\n   with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset of\
    \ E_Port\n   functionality.\n   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric,\
    \ each node, and\n   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique\
    \ names\n   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n\
    \   on WWNs can be found in [WWN1] and [WWN2].  WWNs are expected to be\n   persistent\
    \ across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address\
    \ identifiers that identify\n   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each\
    \ FC port has an\n   address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the\
    \ FC\n   address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.\n"
- title: 4.  MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB contains the notion of a Fibre Channel management\
    \ instance,\n   which is defined as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel\n\
    \   functionality.  Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre\n  \
    \ Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for\n   the\
    \ implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single\
    \ SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent\
    \ implementing a different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.  To represent\
    \ such multiple Fibre Channel management\n   instances within the same SNMP context\
    \ (see section 3.3.1 of\n   [RFC3411]), all tables in this MIB are INDEX-ed by\
    \ fcmInstanceIndex,\n   which is defined as an arbitrary integer to uniquely identify\
    \ a\n   particular Fibre Channel management instance.\n   This MIB contains eleven\
    \ MIB groups, as follows.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The fcmInstanceBasicGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The fcmInstanceBasicGroup Group\n   This group contains basic information\
    \ about a Fibre Channel managed\n   instance, including its name and description,\
    \ the Fibre Channel\n   function(s) it performs, and optional pointers to hardware\
    \ and/or\n   software components.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The fcmSwitchBasicGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The fcmSwitchBasicGroup Group\n   This group contains basic information\
    \ about a Fibre Channel switch,\n   including its domain-id and whether it is\
    \ the principal switch of its\n   fabric.\n"
- title: 4.3.  The fcmPortBasicGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.3.  The fcmPortBasicGroup Group\n   This group contains basic information about\
    \ a Fibre Channel port,\n   including its port name (WWN), the name of the node\
    \ (if any) of which\n   it is a part, the type of port, the classes of service\
    \ it supports,\n   its transmitter and connector types, and the higher level protocols\n\
    \   it supports.\n   Each Fibre Channel port is represented by an entry in the\
    \ ifTable\n   (see below).  The tables relating to ports in this MIB are indexed\
    \ by\n   the port's value of ifIndex.\n"
- title: 4.4.  The fcmPortStatsGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.4.  The fcmPortStatsGroup Group\n   This group contains traffic statistics,\
    \ which are not specific to any\n   particular class of service, for Fibre Channel\
    \ ports.\n"
- title: 4.5.  The fcmPortClass23StatsGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.5.  The fcmPortClass23StatsGroup Group\n   This group contains traffic statistics\
    \ that are specific to Class 2\n   or Class 3 traffic on Fibre Channel ports,\
    \ including class-specific\n   frame and octet counters and counters of busy and\
    \ reject frames.\n"
- title: 4.6.  The fcmPortLcStatsGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.6.  The fcmPortLcStatsGroup Group\n   Some of the statistics in the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup\
    \ can increase\n   rapidly enough to warrant them being defined using the Counter64\n\
    \   syntax.  However, some old SNMP systems do not (yet) support\n   Counter64\
    \ objects.  Thus, this group defines low-capacity\n   (Counter32-based) equivalents\
    \ for the Counter64-based statistics in\n   the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup group.\n"
- title: 4.7.  The fcmPortClassFStatsGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.7.  The fcmPortClassFStatsGroup Group\n   This group contains traffic statistics\
    \ that are specific to Class F\n   traffic on the E_Ports of a Fibre Channel switch.\n"
- title: 4.8.  The fcmPortErrorsGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.8.  The fcmPortErrorsGroup Group\n   This group contains counters of various\
    \ error conditions that can\n   occur on Fibre Channel ports.\n"
- title: 4.9.  The fcmSwitchPortGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.9.  The fcmSwitchPortGroup Group\n   This group contains information about\
    \ ports on a Fibre Channel\n   switch.  For an Fx_Port, it includes the port's\
    \ timeout values, its\n   hold-time, and its capabilities in terms of maximum\
    \ and minimum\n   buffer-to-buffer credit allocations, maximum and minimum data\
    \ field\n   sizes, and support for class 2 and class 3 sequenced delivery.  For\n\
    \   an E_Port or B_Port, it includes the buffer-to-buffer credit\n   allocation\
    \ and data field size.\n"
- title: 4.10.  The fcmSwitchLoginGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.10.  The fcmSwitchLoginGroup Group\n   This group contains information, known\
    \ to a Fibre Channel switch,\n   about its attached/logged-in Nx_Ports and the\
    \ service parameters that\n   have been agreed with them.\n"
- title: 4.11.  The fcmLinkBasicGroup Group
  contents:
  - "4.11.  The fcmLinkBasicGroup Group\n   This group contains information known\
    \ to a local Fibre Channel\n   management instance, and concerning Fibre Channel\
    \ links including\n   those which terminate locally.\n"
- title: 5.  Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "5.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB is a replacement for two other MIBs:\
    \  RFC 2837, and the\n   Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB which was originally\n\
    \   submitted as an Internet Draft to the IETF's IPFC Working Group, and\n   is\
    \ now available as [MIB-FA].\n"
- title: 5.1.  The Interfaces Group MIB
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Interfaces Group MIB\n   The Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] contains\
    \ generic information about\n   all lower layer interfaces, i.e., interfaces which\
    \ are (potentially)\n   below the internet layer.  Thus, each Fibre Channel port\
    \ should have\n   its own row in the ifTable, and that row will contain the generic\n\
    \   information about the interface/port.  The Interfaces Group MIB\n   specifies\
    \ that additional information which is specific to a\n   particular type of interface\
    \ media, should be defined in a media-\n   specific MIB.  This MIB is the media-specific\
    \ MIB for Fibre Channel\n   ports/interfaces.\n   Section 4 of [RFC2863] requires\
    \ that a media-specific MIB clarify how\n   the generic definitions apply for\
    \ the particular type of media.  The\n   clarifications for Fibre Channel interfaces\
    \ are as follows.\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  Layering Model
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Layering Model\n   The Interfaces Group MIB permits multiple ifTable\
    \ entries to be\n   defined for interface sub-layers, and for those multiple entries\
    \ to\n   be arranged in a stack.\n   For Fibre Channel interfaces, no sublayers\
    \ are defined and a Fibre\n   Channel interface will typically have no other ifTable\
    \ rows stacked\n   on top of it, nor underneath it.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Virtual Circuits\n   This Fibre Channel MIB does not deal with virtual\
    \ circuits.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.  ifRcvAddressTable
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.  ifRcvAddressTable\n   The ifRcvAddressTable does not apply to Fibre Channel\
    \ interfaces.\n"
- title: 5.1.4.  ifType
  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  ifType\n   The value of ifType for a Fibre Channel interface is 56.\n"
- title: 5.1.5.  ifXxxOctets
  contents:
  - "5.1.5.  ifXxxOctets\n   The definitions of ifInOctets and ifOutOctets (and similarly,\n\
    \   ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets) specify that their values include\n   framing\
    \ characters.  For Fibre Channel interfaces, they include all\n   the octets contained\
    \ in frames between the Start-of-Frame and End-\n   of-Frame delimiters (excluding\
    \ the delimiters).\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write:\n      fcmInstanceTextName\n\
    \      fcmInstanceDescr\n      fcmSwitchDomainId\n      fcmPortAdminType\n   \
    \   fcmPortAdminSpeed\n      fcmISPortClassFCredit\n   Such objects may be considered\
    \ sensitive or vulnerable in some\n   network environments.  For example, the\
    \ ability to change network\n   topology or network speed may afford an attacker\
    \ the ability to\n   obtain better performance at the expense of other network\
    \ users;\n   setting fcmSwitchDomainId to an invalid value could lead to denial\
    \ of\n   service in some configurations.  The support for SET operations in a\n\
    \   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative\n   effect\
    \ on network operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e.,\
    \ objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  In particular, these objects provide\n   information on network topology:\n\
    \      fcmLinkEnd1NodeWwn\n      fcmLinkEnd1PhysPortNumber\n      fcmLinkEnd1PortWwn\n\
    \      fcmLinkEnd2NodeWwn\n      fcmLinkEnd2PhysPortNumber\n      fcmLinkEnd2PortWwn\n\
    \      fcmLinkEnd2AgentAddress\n      fcmLinkEnd2PortType\n      fcmLinkEnd2UnitType\n\
    \      fcmLinkEnd2FcAddressId\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n\
    \   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security\
    \ features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n\
    \   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"

- title: 12.1.  Problems with the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB
  contents:
  - "12.1.  Problems with the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB\n   The Fibre\
    \ Channel Management Integration MIB [MIB-FA] had the\n   following major problems:\n\
    \   -  It wasn't formatted using SMIv2, which is mandatory.\n   -  The MIB seemed\
    \ to have been defined with the notion that it would\n      be the only MIB that\
    \ a Fibre Channel product will require.  The\n      notion of an agent implementing\
    \ just a single MIB was abandoned by\n      the IETF in 1992 as being non-scalable.\
    \  Rather, a Fibre Channel\n      MIB needed to be another MIB in the continuing\
    \ series of MIBs\n      defined by the IETF, and thus, it needed to be consistent\
    \ with its\n      predecessors.  In other words, there are existing MIBs that\
    \ all\n      SNMP agents must support, even if the support of Fibre Channel\n\
    \      interfaces is the only functionality that they have.  Thus, it was\n  \
    \    essential that the Fibre Channel Integration MIB contained only\n      objects\
    \ for information that is specific to Fibre Channel.  All\n      objects relevant\
    \ to non-Fibre Channel environments needed to be\n      removed.  This issue applied\
    \ to a large fraction of the objects\n      defined in the MIB.\n   -  The MIB\
    \ had some but not complete overlap in functionality with\n      RFC 2837.\n \
    \  -  Every SNMP agent must implement the ifTable.  The ifTable counters\n   \
    \   are the MIB objects most well-used by administrators in SNMP\n      management.\
    \  SNMP agents need to implement a row in the ifTable\n      for each of their\
    \ network interfaces, including their Fibre\n      Channel interfaces.  The IF-MIB\
    \ requires a media-specific MIB to\n      specify how that type of interface uses\
    \ the ifTable (see section 4\n      in RFC 2863).  [RFC2837] doesn't do that,\
    \ nor did the Fibre\n      Channel Integration MIB.\n   -  It incorrectly used\
    \ the OCTET STRING syntax (instead of Counter32\n      or Counter64) for counters.\n"

- title: 12.2.10.  FC Management Instance
  contents:
  - "12.2.10.  FC Management Instance\n   The term \"connectivity unit\" was changed\

    \ to the\n   implementor:\n      -  the definition of FcUnitType suggested it\
    \ was functional;\n      -  the definition of uNumber suggested it was physical;\n\
    \      -  the definition of connUnitProduct suggested it was a vendor's\n    \
    \     product;\n      -  etc.\n   The common implementation strategy for the \"\
    connectivity unit\" was\n   which ever grouping provided access to the management\
    \ functionality\n   the easiest.  (One such grouping accommodates a single SNMP\
    \ agent\n   having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, each supporting a\n \
    \  separate implementation of the MIB.)\n   In fact, this scenario is not new;\
    \ in practice, a \"connectivity unit\"\n   will have the same semantics as a management\
    \ \"instance\" in other\n   MIBs, e.g., the IPS WG's own iSCSI MIB.  For this\
    \ MIB, its meaning\n   is: \"a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality\"\
    .\n   Given this definition, the \"FC management instance\" is a better name\n\
