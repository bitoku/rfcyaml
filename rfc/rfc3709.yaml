  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification supplements RFC 3280 [PKIX-1], which
    profiles\n   X.509 [X.509] certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs)\n
    \  for use in the Internet.\n   The basic function of a certificate is to bind
    a public key to the\n   identity of an entity (the subject).  From a strictly
    technical\n   viewpoint, this goal could be achieved by signing the identity of
    the\n   subject together with its public key.  However, the art of Public-Key\n
    \  Infrastructure (PKI) has developed certificates far beyond this\n   functionality
    in order to meet the needs of modern global networks\n   and heterogeneous IT
    structures.\n   Certificate users must be able to determine certificate policies,\n
    \  appropriate key usage, assurance level, and name form constraints.\n   Before
    a relying party can make an informed decision whether a\n   particular certificate
    is trustworthy and relevant for its intended\n   usage, a certificate may be examined
    from several different\n   perspectives.\n   Systematic processing is necessary
    to determine whether a particular\n   certificate meets the predefined prerequisites
    for an intended usage.\n   Much of the information contained in certificates is
    appropriate and\n   effective for machine processing; however, this information
    is not\n   suitable for a corresponding human trust and recognition process.\n
    \  Humans prefer to structure information into categories and symbols.\n   Most
    humans associate complex structures of reality with easily\n   recognizable logotypes
    and marks.  Humans tend to trust things that\n   they recognize from previous
    experiences.  Humans may examine\n   information to confirm their initial reaction.
    \ Very few consumers\n   actually read all terms and conditions they agree to
    in accepting a\n   service, rather they commonly act on trust derived from previous\n
    \  experience and recognition.\n   A big part of this process is branding.  Service
    providers and\n   product vendors invest a lot of money and resources into creating
    a\n   strong relation between positive user experiences and easily\n   recognizable
    trademarks, servicemarks, and logotypes.\n   Branding is also pervasive in identification
    instruments, including\n   identification cards, passports, driver's licenses,
    credit cards,\n   gasoline cards, and loyalty cards.  Identification instruments
    are\n   intended to identify the holder as a particular person or as a member\n
    \  of the community.  The community may represent the subscribers of a\n   service
    or any other group.  Identification instruments, in physical\n   form, commonly
    use logotypes and symbols, solely to enhance human\n   recognition and trust in
    the identification instrument itself.  They\n   may also include a registered
    trademark to allow legal recourse for\n   unauthorized duplication.\n   Since
    certificates play an equivalent role in electronic exchanges,\n   we examine the
    inclusion of logotypes in certificates.  We consider\n   certificate-based identification
    and certificate selection.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Certificate-based Identification\n   The need for human recognition depends
      on the manner in which\n   certificates are used and whether certificates need
      to be visible to\n   human users.  If certificates are to be used in open environments
      and\n   in applications that bring the user in conscious contact with the\n
      \  result of a certificate-based identification process, then human\n   recognition
      is highly relevant, and may be a necessity.\n   Examples of such applications
      include:\n      -  Web server identification where a user identifies the owner
      of\n         the web site.\n      -  Peer e-mail exchange in B2B, B2C, and private
      communications.\n      -  Exchange of medical records, and system for medical\n
      \        prescriptions.\n      -  Unstructured e-business applications (i.e.,
      non-EDI\n         applications).\n      -  Wireless client authenticating to
      a service provider.\n   Most applications provide the human user with an opportunity
      to view\n   the results of a successful certificate-based identification process.\n
      \  When the user takes the steps necessary to view these results, the\n   user
      is presented with a view of a certificate.  This solution has\n   two major
      problems.  First, the function to view a certificate is\n   often rather hard
      to find for a non-technical user.  Second, the\n   presentation of the certificate
      is too technical and is not user\n   friendly.  It contains no graphic symbols
      or logotypes to enhance\n   human recognition.\n   Many investigations have
      shown that users of today's applications do\n   not take the steps necessary
      to view certificates.  This could be due\n   to poor user interfaces.  Further,
      many applications are structured\n   to hide certificates from users.  The application
      designers do not\n   want to expose certificates to users at all.\n"
    title: 1.1.  Certificate-based Identification
  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Selection of Certificates\n   One situation where software applications
      must expose human users to\n   certificates is when the user must select a single
      certificate from a\n   portfolio of certificates.  In some cases, the software
      application\n   can use information within the certificates to filter the list
      for\n   suitability; however, the user must be queried if more than one\n   certificate
      is suitable.  The human user must select one of them.\n   This situation is
      comparable to a person selecting a suitable plastic\n   card from his wallet.
      \ In this situation, substantial assistance is\n   provided by card color, location,
      and branding.\n   In order to provide similar support for certificate selection,
      the\n   users need tools to easily recognize and distinguish certificates.\n
      \  Introduction of logotypes into certificates provides the necessary\n   graphic.\n"
    title: 1.2.  Selection of Certificates
  - contents:
    - "1.3.  Combination of Verification Techniques\n   The use of logotypes will,
      in many cases, affect the users decision\n   to trust and use a certificate.
      \ It is therefore important that there\n   be a distinct and clear architectural
      and functional distinction\n   between the processes and objectives of the automated
      certificate\n   verification and human recognition.\n   Since logotypes are
      only aimed for human interpretation and contain\n   data that is inappropriate
      for computer based verification schemes,\n   the logotype extension MUST NOT
      be an active component in automated\n   certification path validation.\n   Automated
      certification path verification determines whether the\n   end-entity certificate
      can be verified according to defined policy.\n   The algorithm for this verification
      is specified in RFC 3280\n   [PKIX-1].\n   The automated processing provides
      assurance that the certificate is\n   valid.  It does not indicate whether the
      subject is entitled to any\n   particular information, or whether the subject
      ought to be trusted to\n   perform a particular service.  These are access control
      decisions.\n   Automatic processing will make some access control decisions,
      but\n   others, depending on the application context, involve the human user.\n
      \  In some situations, where automated procedures have failed to\n   establish
      the suitability of the certificate to the task, the human\n   user is the final
      arbitrator of the post certificate verification\n   access control decisions.
      \ In the end, the human will decide whether\n   or not to accept an executable
      email attachment, to release personal\n   information, or follow the instructions
      displayed by a web browser.\n   This decision will often be based on recognition
      and previous\n   experience.\n   The distinction between systematic processing
      and human processing is\n   rather straightforward.  They can be complementary.
      \ While the\n   systematic process is focused on certification path construction
      and\n   verification, the human acceptance process is focused on recognition\n
      \  and related previous experience.\n   There are some situations where systematic
      processing and human\n   processing interfere with each other.  These issues
      are discussed in\n   the Security Considerations section.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Different Types of Logotypes in Certificates\n   This specification defines
    the inclusion of three standard logotype\n   types.\n     1) Community logotype\n
    \    2) Issuer organization logotype\n     3) Subject organization logotype\n
    \  The community logotype - is the general mark for a community.  It\n   identifies
    a service concept for entity identification and\n   certificate issuance.  Many
    issuers may use a community logotype to\n   co-brand with a global community in
    order to gain global recognition\n   of its local service provision.  This type
    of community branding is\n   very common in the credit card business, where local
    independent card\n   issuers include a globally recognized brand (such as VISA
    and\n   MasterCard).\n   Issuer organization logotype - is a logotype representing
    the\n   organization identified as part of the issuer name in the\n   certificate.\n
    \  Subject organization logotype - is a logotype representing the\n   organization
    identified in the subject name in the certificate.\n   In addition to the standard
    logotype types, this specification\n   accommodates inclusion of other logotype
    types where each class of\n   logotype is defined by an object identifier.  The
    object identifier\n   can be either locally defined or an identifier defined in
    section 4.2\n   of this document.\n"
  title: 2.  Different Types of Logotypes in Certificates
- contents:
  - "3.  Logotype Data\n   This specification defines two types of logotype data:
    image data and\n   audio data.  Implementations MUST support image data; however,\n
    \  support for audio data is OPTIONAL.\n   There is no need to significantly increase
    the size of the\n   certificate by including image and audio data of logotypes.
    \ Rather,\n   a URI identifying the location to the logotype data and a one-way\n
    \  hash of the referenced data is included in the certificate.\n   Several image
    files, representing the same image in different\n   formats, sizes, and color
    palates, may represent each logotype image.\n   At least one of the image files
    representing a logotype SHOULD\n   contain an image within the size range of 60
    pixels wide by 45 pixels\n   high, and 200 pixels wide by 150 pixels high.\n   Several
    audio files may further represent the same audio sequence in\n   different formats
    and resolutions.  At least one of the audio files\n   representing a logotype
    SHOULD have a play time between 1 and 30\n   seconds.\n   If a logotype of a certain
    type (as defined in section 2) is\n   represented by more than one image file,
    then the image files MUST\n   contain variants of roughly the same image.  Likewise,
    if a logotype\n   of a certain type is represented by more than one audio file,
    then\n   the audio files MUST contain variants of the same audio information.\n
    \  A spoken message in different languages is considered a variation of\n   the
    same audio information.  Compliant applications MUST NOT display\n   more than
    one of the images and MUST NOT play more than one of the\n   audio sequences for
    any logotype type at the same time.\n   A client MAY simultaneously display multiple
    logotypes of different\n   logotype types.  For example, it may display one subject
    organization\n   logotype while also displaying a community logotype, but it MUST
    NOT\n   display multiple image variants of the same community logotype.\n   Each
    logotype present in a certificate MUST be represented by at\n   least one image
    data file.\n   Applications SHOULD enhance processing and off-line functionality
    by\n   caching logotype data.\n"

  - "4.  Logotype Extension\n   This section specifies the syntax and semantics of
    the logotype\n   extension.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Extension Format\n   The logotype extension MAY be included in public
      key certificates\n   [PKIX-1] or attribute certificates [PKIX-AC].  The logotype
      extension\n   MUST be identified by the following object identifier:\n      id-pe-logotype
      \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=\n         { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
      internet(1)\n           security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-pe(1) 12 }\n   This
      extension MUST NOT be marked critical.\n   Logotype data may be referenced through
      either direct or indirect\n   addressing.  Clients MUST support both direct
      and indirect\n   addressing.  Certificate issuing applications MUST support
      direct\n   addressing, and certificate issuing applications SHOULD support\n
      \  indirect addressing.\n   The direct addressing includes information about
      each logotype in the\n   certificate, and URIs point to the image and audio
      data files.\n   Direct addressing supports cases where just one or a few alternative\n
      \  images and audio files are referenced.\n   The indirect addressing includes
      one reference to an external hashed\n   data structure that contains information
      on the type, content, and\n   location of each image and audio file.  Indirect
      addressing supports\n   cases where each logotype is represented by many alternative
      audio or\n   image files.\n   Both direct and indirect addressing accommodate
      alternative URIs to\n   obtain exactly the same item.  This opportunity for
      replication is\n   intended to improve availability.  Therefore, if a client
      is unable\n   to fetch the item from one URI, the client SHOULD try another
      URI in\n   the sequence.  All URIs MUST use either the  HTTP scheme (http://...)\n
      \  or the FTP scheme (ftp://...) [URI].  At least one URI in each\n   sequence
      MUST use the HTTP scheme.  Clients MUST support retrieval of\n   referenced
      LogoTypeData with HTTP/1.1 [HTTP/1.1].  Clients MAY\n   support retrieval using
      FTP [FTP].\n   The logotype extension MUST have the following syntax:\n"

      MUST compute a one-way hash value using one of the\n   identified functions,

      specified, the language tag MUST use the RFC 3066\n   [LANGCODES] syntax.\n
      \  Logotype types defined in this specification are:\n      Community Logotype:
      \ If communityLogos is present, the logotypes\n      MUST represent one or more
      communities with which the certificate\n      issuer is affiliated.  The communityLogos
      MAY be present in an end\n      entity certificate, a CA certificate, or an
      attribute certificate.\n      The communityLogos contains a sequence of Community
      Logotypes,\n      each representing a different community.  If more than one\n
      \     Community logotype is present, they MUST be placed in order of\n      preferred
      appearance.  Some clients MAY choose to display a subset\n      of the present
      community logos; therefore the placement within the\n      sequence aids the
      client selection.  The most preferred logotype\n      MUST be first in the sequence,
      and the least preferred logotype\n      MUST be last in the sequence.\n      Issuer
      Organization Logotype:  If issuerLogo is present, the\n      logotype MUST represent
      the issuer's organization.  The logotype\n      MUST be consistent with, and
      require the presence of, an\n      organization name stored in the organization
      attribute in the\n      issuer field (for either a public key certificate or
      attribute\n      certificate).  The issuerLogo MAY be present in an end entity\n
      \     certificate, a CA certificate, or an attribute certificate.\n      Subject
      Organization Logotype:  If subjectLogo is present, the\n      logotype MUST
      represent the subject's organization.  The logotype\n      MUST be consistent
      with, and require the presence of, an\n      organization name stored in the
      organization attribute in the\n      subject field (for either a public key
      certificate or attribute\n      certificate).  The subjectLogo MAY be present
      in an end entity\n      certificate, a CA certificate, or an attribute certificate.\n
      \  The relationship between the subject organization and the subject\n   organization

  title: 5.  Type of Certificates
- contents:
  - "6.  Use in Clients\n   All PKI implementations require relying party software
    to have some\n   mechanism to determine whether a trusted CA issues a particular\n
    \  certificate.  This is an issue for certification path validation,\n   including
    consistent policy and name checking.\n   After a certification path is successfully
    validated, the replying\n   party trusts the information that the CA includes
    in the certificate,\n   including any certificate extensions.  The client software
    can choose\n   to make use of such information, or the client software can ignore\n
    \  it.  If the client is unable to support a provided logotype, the\n   client
    MUST NOT report an error, rather the client MUST behave as\n   though no logotype
    extension was included in the certificate.\n   Current standards do not provide
    any mechanism for cross-certifying\n   CAs to constrain subordinate CAs from including
    private extensions\n   (see the security considerations section).\n   Consequently,
    if relying party software accepts a CA, then it should\n   be prepared to (unquestioningly)
    display the associated logotypes to\n   its human user, given that it is configured
    to do so.  Information\n   about the logotypes is provided so that the replying
    party software\n   can select the one that will best meet the needs of the human
    user.\n   This choice depends on the abilities of the human user, as well as\n
    \  the capabilities of the platform on which the replaying party\n   software
    is running.  If none of the provided logotypes meets the\n   needs of the human
    user or matches the capabilities of the platform,\n   then the logotypes can be
    ignored.\n   A client MAY, subject to local policy, choose to display none, one,\n
    \  or any number of the logotypes in the logotype extension.\n   In many cases,
    a client will be used in an environment with a good\n   network connection and
    also used in an environment with little or no\n   network connectivity.  For example,
    a laptop computer can be docked\n   with a high-speed LAN connection, or it can
    be disconnected from the\n   network altogether.  In recognition of this situation,
    the client\n   MUST include the ability to disable the fetching of logotypes.\n
    \  However, locally cached logotypes can still be displayed when the\n   user
    disables the fetching of additional logotypes.\n   A client MAY, subject to local
    policy, choose any combination of\n   audio and image presentation for each logotype.
    \ That is, the client\n   MAY display an image with or without playing a sound,
    and it MAY play\n   a sound with or without displaying an image.  A client MUST
    NOT play\n   more than one logotype audio sequence at the same time.\n   The logotype
    is to be displayed in conjunction with other identity\n   information contained
    in the certificate.  The logotype is not a\n   replacement for this identity information.\n
    \  Care is needed when designing replying party software to ensure that\n   an
    appropriate context of logotype information is provided.  This is\n   especially
    difficult with audio logotypes.  It is important that the\n   human user be able
    to recognize the context of the logotype, even if\n   other audio streams are
    being played.\n   If the relying party software is unable to successfully validate
    a\n   particular certificate, then it MUST NOT display any logotype data\n   associated
    with that certificate.\n"
  title: 6.  Use in Clients
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Implementations that simultaneously display multiple
    logotype types\n   (subject organization, issuer, community or other), MUST ensure
    that\n   there is no ambiguity as to the binding between the image and the\n   type
    of logotype that the image represents.  \"Logotype type\" is\n   defined in section
    2, and it refers to the type of entity or\n   affiliation represented by the logotype,
    not the type of binary\n   format.\n   Logotypes are very difficult to securely
    and accurately define.\n   Names are also difficult in this regard, but logotypes
    are even\n   worse.  It is quite difficult to specify what is, and what is not,
    a\n   legitimate logotype of an organization.  There is an entire legal\n   structure
    around this issue, and it will not be repeated here.\n   However, issuers should
    be aware of the implications of including\n   images associated with a trademark
    or servicemark before doing so.\n   As logotypes can be difficult (and sometimes
    expensive) to verify,\n   the possibility of errors related to assigning wrong
    logotypes to\n   organizations is increased.\n   This is not a new issue for electronic
    identification instruments.\n   It is already dealt with in a number of similar
    situations in the\n   physical world, including physical employee identification
    cards.\n   Secondly, there are situations where identification of logotypes is\n
    \  rather simple and straightforward, such as logotypes for well-known\n   industries
    and institutes.  These issues should not stop those\n   service providers who
    want to issue logotypes from doing so, where\n   relevant.\n   It is impossible
    to prevent fraudulent creation of certificates by\n   dishonest or badly performing
    issuers, containing names and logotypes\n   that the issuer has no claim to or
    has failed to check correctly.\n   Such certificates could be created in an attempt
    to socially engineer\n   a user into accepting a certificate.  The premise used
    for the\n   logotype work is thus that logotype graphics in a certificate are\n
    \  trusted only if the certificate is successfully validated within a\n   valid
    path.  It is thus imperative that the representation of any\n   certificate that
    fails to validate is not enhanced in any way by\n   using the logotype graphic.\n
    \  Logotype data is fetched from a server when it is needed.  By\n   watching
    activity on the network, an observer can determine which\n   clients are making
    use of certificates that contain particular\n   logotype data.  This observation
    can potentially introduce privacy\n   issues.  Since clients are expected to locally
    cache logotype data,\n   network traffic to the server containing the logotype
    data will not\n   be generated every time the certificate is used.  In cases where\n
    \  logotype data is not cashed, monitoring would reveal usage frequency.\n   In
    cases where logotype data is cached, monitoring would reveal when\n   a certain
    logotype image or audio sequence is used for the first\n   time.\n   Certification
    paths may also impose name constraints that are\n   systematically checked during
    certification path processing, which,\n   in theory, may be circumvented by logotypes.\n
    \  Certificate path processing as defined in RFC 3280 [PKIX-1] does not\n   constrain
    the inclusion of logotype data in certificates.  A parent\n   CA can constrain
    certification path validation such that subordinate\n   CAs cannot issue valid
    certificates to end-entities outside a limited\n   name space or outside specific
    certificate polices.  A malicious CA\n   can comply with these name and policy
    requirements and still include\n   inappropriate logotypes in the certificates
    that it issues.  These\n   certificates will pass the certification path validation
    algorithm,\n   which means the client will trust the logotypes in the certificates.\n
    \  Since there is no technical mechanism to prevent or control\n   subordinate
    CAs from including the logotype extension or its\n   contents, where appropriate,
    a parent CA could employ a legal\n   agreement to impose a suitable restriction
    on the subordinate CA.\n   This situation is not unique to the logotype extension.\n
    \  The controls available to a parent CA to protect itself from rogue\n   subordinate
    CAs are non-technical.  They include:\n      -  Contractual agreements of suitable
    behavior, including terms of\n         liability in case of material breach.\n
    \     -  Control mechanisms and procedures to monitor and follow-up\n         behavior
    of subordinate CAs.\n      -  Use of certificate policies to declare an assurance
    level of\n         logotype data, as well as to guide applications on how to treat\n
    \        and display logotypes.\n      -  Use of revocation functions to revoke
    any misbehaving CA.\n   There is not a simple, straightforward, and absolute technical\n
    \  solution.  Rather, involved parties must settle some aspects of PKI\n   outside
    the scope of technical controls.  As such, issuers need to\n   clearly identify
    and communicate the associated risks.\n"
