- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2449 [POP3-EXT] defined extended [POP3] response codes,\
    \ to give\n   clients more information about errors so clients can respond more\n\
    \   appropriately.  In addition to the mechanism, two initial response\n   codes\
    \ were defined (IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY), in an attempt to\n   differentiate between\
    \ authentication failures related to user\n   credentials, and other errors.\n\
    \   In practice, these two response codes, while helpful, do not go far\n   enough.\
    \  This memo proposes two additional response codes:  SYS and\n   AUTH, which\
    \ enable clients to unambiguously determine an optimal\n   response to an authentication\
    \ failure.\n   In addition, a new capability (AUTH-RESP-CODE) is defined.\n"

- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   RFC 2449 [POP3-EXT] introduced the IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY\
    \ response\n   codes.  The intent is to allow clients to clearly determine the\n\
    \   underlying cause of a failure in order to respond.  For example,\n   clients\
    \ need to know if the user should be asked for new credentials,\n   or if the\
    \ POP3 session should simply be tried again later.  (Some\n   deployed POP3 clients\
    \ attempt to parse the text of authentication\n   failure errors, looking for\
    \ strings known to be issued by various\n   servers which indicate the mailbox\
    \ is locked.)\n   IN-USE indicates that an exclusive lock could not be obtained\
    \ for the\n   user's mailbox, probably because another POP3 session is in progress.\n\
    \   LOGIN-DELAY informs the client that the user has not waited long\n   enough\
    \ before authenticating again.\n   However, there are other error conditions which\
    \ do not require new\n   credentials, some of which should be brought to the user's\
    \ attention.\n   Despite the IN-USE and LOGIN-DELAY responses, clients cannot\
    \ be sure\n   if any other error requires new user credentials.\n"
- title: 4.  The SYS Response Code
  contents:
  - "4.  The SYS Response Code\n   The SYS response code announces that a failure\
    \ is due to a system\n   error, as opposed to the user's credentials or an external\
    \ condition.\n   It is hierarchical, with two possible second-level codes: TEMP\
    \ and\n   PERM.  (Case is not significant at any level of the hierarchy.)\n  \
    \ SYS/TEMP indicates a problem which is likely to be temporary in\n   nature,\
    \ and therefore there is no need to alarm the user, unless the\n   failure persists.\
    \  Examples might include a central resource which is\n   currently locked or\
    \ otherwise temporarily unavailable, insufficient\n   free disk or memory, etc.\n\
    \   SYS/PERM is used for problems which are unlikely to be resolved\n   without\
    \ intervention.  It is appropriate to alert the user and\n   suggest that the\
    \ organization's support or assistance personnel be\n   contacted.  Examples include\
    \ corrupted mailboxes, system\n   configuration errors, etc.\n   The SYS response\
    \ code is valid with an -ERR response to any command.\n"
- title: 5.  The AUTH Response Code
  contents:
  - "5.  The AUTH Response Code\n   The AUTH response code informs the client that\
    \ there is a problem\n   with the user's credentials.  This might be an incorrect\
    \ password, an\n   unknown user name, an expired account, an attempt to authenticate\
    \ in\n   violation of policy (such as from an invalid location or during an\n\
    \   unauthorized time), or some other problem.\n   The AUTH response code is valid\
    \ with an -ERR response to any\n   authentication command including AUTH, USER\
    \ (see note), PASS, or\n   APOP.\n   Servers which include the AUTH response code\
    \ with any authentication\n   failure SHOULD support the CAPA command [POP3-EXT]\
    \ and SHOULD include\n   the AUTH-RESP-CODE capability in the CAPA response. \
    \ AUTH-RESP-CODE\n   assures the client that only errors with the AUTH code are\
    \ caused by\n   credential problems.\n      NOTE:  Returning the AUTH response\
    \ code to the USER command\n      reveals to the client that the specified user\
    \ exists.  It is\n      strongly RECOMMENDED that the server not issue this response\
    \ code\n      to the USER command.\n"

- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added the AUTH-RESP-CODE capability to the\
    \ list of POP3\n   capabilities (established by RFC 2449 [POP3-EXT]).\n   IANA\
    \ has also added the SYS and AUTH response codes to the list of\n   POP3 response\
