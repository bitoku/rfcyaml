  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  It defines textual conventions to represent STD 66 [RFC3986] URIs,\n   which
    are further described by [RFC3305].\n   Three textual conventions are defined:
    one of unrestricted length,\n   and two of different restricted lengths.  Which
    length is appropriate\n   will depend on tradeoffs made in particular MIB modules.
    \ The purpose\n   of providing standard restricted-length textual conventions
    is to\n   improve compatibility between MIB modules that require restricted-\n
    \  length URIs.\n   If a URI needs to be used as an index object, then the 'Uri'
    TEXTUAL-\n   CONVENTION SHOULD be subtyped to a length appropriate for the Object\n
    \  Identifier (OID) of which it is part.  The description of the 'Uri'\n   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    discusses this case.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
