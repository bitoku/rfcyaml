  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   IEEE Std 1394-1995 (and its amendment) is a standard for\
    \ a High\n   Performance Serial Bus.  IETF IP1394 Working Group has standardized\n\
    \   the method to carry IPv4 datagrams and ARP packets over IEEE1394\n   subnetwork\
    \ [IP1394].\n   This document describes the frame format for transmission of IPv6\n\
    \   [IPV6] packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses\n   and\
    \ statelessly autoconfigured addresses on IEEE1394 networks.  It\n   also describes\
    \ the content of the Source/Target Link-layer Address\n   option used in Neighbor\
    \ Discovery [DISC] when the messages are\n   transmitted on an IEEE1394 network.\n"

- title: 3. IPv6-CAPABLE NODES
  contents:
  - "3. IPv6-CAPABLE NODES\n   An IPv6-capable node MUST fulfill the following minimum\
    \ requirements:\n   -  it MUST implement configuration ROM in the general format\n\
    \      specified by ISO/IEC 13213:1994 and MUST implement the bus\n      information\
    \ block specified by IEEE Std 1394a-2000 [1394a] and a\n      unit directory specified\
    \ by this document;\n   -  the max_rec field in its bus information block MUST\
    \ be at least 8;\n      this indicates an ability to accept block write requests\
    \ and\n      asynchronous stream packets with data payload of 512 octets.  The\n\
    \      same ability MUST also apply to read requests; that is, the node\n    \
    \  MUST be able to transmit a block response packet with a data\n      payload\
    \ of 512 octets;\n   -  it MUST be isochronous resource manager capable, as specified\
    \ by\n      IEEE Std 1394a-2000;\n   -  it MUST support both reception and transmission\
    \ of asynchronous\n      streams as specified by IEEE Std 1394a-2000.\n"
- title: 4. LINK ENCAPSULATION AND FRAGMENTATION
  contents:
  - "4. LINK ENCAPSULATION AND FRAGMENTATION\n   The encapsulation and fragmentation\
    \ mechanism MUST be the same as \"4.\n   LINK ENCAPSULATION AND FRAGMENTATION\"\
    \ of [IP1394].\n      Note: Since there is an ether_type field to discriminate\
    \ protocols\n      and MCAP (multicast channel allocation protocol) is used for\
    \ both\n      IPv4 and IPv6, the version field in GASP (global asynchronous\n\
    \      stream packet) header of IPv6 datagrams is the same value (one) as\n  \
    \    [IP1394].\n   The ether_type value for IPv6 is 0x86dd.\n   The default MTU\
    \ size for IPv6 packets on an IEEE1394 network is 1500\n   octets.  This size\
    \ may be reduced by a Router Advertisement [DISC]\n   containing an MTU option\
    \ which specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual\n   configuration of each node.\
    \  If a Router Advertisement received on an\n   IEEE1394 interface has an MTU\
    \ option specifying an MTU larger than\n   1500, or larger than a manually configured\
    \ value, that MTU option may\n   be logged to system management but MUST be otherwise\
    \ ignored.  The\n   mechanism to extend MTU size between particular two nodes\
    \ is for\n   further study.\n"

    \   - The value for Unit_SW_Version is 0x000002.\n   - The textual descriptor\
    \ for the Unit_SW_Version MUST be \"IPv6\".\n      Note: A dual-stack (IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6) node will have two unit\n      directories for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.\n"
- title: 6. STATELESS AUTOCONFIGURATION
  contents:
  - "6. STATELESS AUTOCONFIGURATION\n   The Interface Identifier [AARCH] for an IEEE1394\
    \ interface is formed\n   from the interface's built-in EUI-64 identifier by complementing\
    \ the\n   \"Universal/Local\" (U/L) bit, which is the next-to-lowest order bit\
    \ of\n   the first octet of the EUI-64 identifier.  Complementing this bit\n \
    \  will generally change a 0 value to a 1, since an interface's built-in\n   EUI-64\
    \ identifier is expected to be from a universally administered\n   address space\
    \ and hence have a globally unique value.  A universally\n   administered EUI-64\
    \ identifier is signified by a 0 in the U/L bit\n   position, while a globally\
    \ unique IPv6 Interface Identifier is\n   signified by a 1 in the corresponding\
    \ position.  For further\n   discussion on this point, see [AARCH].\n   An IPv6\
    \ address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration [ACONF]\n   of an IEEE1394\
    \ interface MUST have a length of 64 bits.\n"

- title: 8. ADDRESS MAPPING FOR UNICAST
  contents:
  - "8. ADDRESS MAPPING FOR UNICAST\n   The procedure for mapping IPv6 unicast addresses\
    \ into IEEE1394 link-\n   layer addresses uses the Neighbor Discovery [DISC].\
    \  Since 1394 link\n   address (node_ID) will not be constant across a 1394 bridge,\
    \ we have\n   chosen not to put it in the Link-layer Address option.  The recipient\n\
    \   of the Neighbor Discovery SHOULD use the source_ID (obtained from\n   either\
    \ the asynchronous packet header or the GASP header) in\n   conjunction with the\
    \ content of the Source link-layer address.  An\n   implementation MAY use some\
    \ other methods to obtain a node_ID of the\n   sender utilizing a mapping table\
    \ between node_unique_ID (EUI-64\n   identifier) and node_ID.  The mechanism to\
    \ make such mapping table is\n   out of scope of this document.\n   The recipient\
    \ of an Neighbor Discovery packet MUST ignore it unless\n   the most significant\
    \ ten bits of the source_ID are equal to either\n   0x3FF or the most significant\
    \ ten bits of the recipient's NODE_IDS\n   register.\n   The Source/Target Link-layer\
    \ Address option has the following form\n   when the link layer is IEEE1394.\n\

    \  node_unique_ID  This field contains the node unique ID of the\n           \

    \ of max_rec\n                   in the node's configuration ROM.\n   spd    \
    \         This field MUST be set to the lesser of the node's\n               \
    \    link speed and PHY speed.  The link speed is the\n                   maximum\
    \ speed at which the link may send or\n                   receive packets; the\
    \ PHY speed is the maximum\n                   speed at which the PHY may send,\
    \ receive or repeat\n                   packets.  The encoding used for spd is\

    \   This field MUST specify the 48-bit offset of the\n                   node's\
    \ FIFO available for the receipt of IPv6\n                   datagrams.  The offset\
    \ of a node's unicast FIFO\n                   MUST NOT change, except as the\
    \ result of a power\n                   reset.\n   reserved        This field\
    \ MUST be set to all zeros by the sender\n                   and ignored by the\
    \ receiver.\n   Note that node_ID may change when 1394 bus-reset occurs.  The\
    \ mapping\n   cache held in the node SHOULD be cleared on 1394 bus-reset.\n  \
    \ According to [1394], the maximum data payload and the transmission\n   speed\
    \ SHOULD be determined based on the sender's capability, the\n   recipient's capability,\
    \ and the PHYs of all intervening nodes.\n"
- title: 9. IPv6 MULTICAST
  contents:
  - "9. IPv6 MULTICAST\n   By default, all best-effort IPv6 multicast MUST use asynchronous\n\
    \   stream packets whose channel number is equal to the channel field\n   from\
    \ the BROADCAST_CHANNEL register.  In particular, datagrams\n   addressed to all-nodes\
    \ multicast addresses, all-routers multicast\n   addresses, and solicited-node\
    \ multicast addresses [AARCH] MUST use\n   the default channel specified by the\
    \ BROADCAST_CHANNEL register.\n   Best-effort IPv6 multicast for other multicast\
    \ group addresses may\n   utilize a different channel number if such a channel\
    \ number is\n   allocated and advertised prior to use, by the multicast channel\n\
    \   allocation protocol (MCAP), as described in [IP1394].\n   When a node wishes\
    \ to receive multicast data addressed to other than\n   all-nodes multicast addresses,\
    \ all-routers multicast addresses, and\n   solicited-node multicast addresses,\
    \ it MUST confirm if the channel\n   mapping between a multicast group address\
    \ and a channel number exists\n   using MCAP, as described in \"9.3 Multicast\
    \ Receive\" in [IP1394].\n   The implementation of MCAP is optional for send-only\
    \ nodes.  A node\n   MAY transmit multicast data addressed to any multicast addresses\
    \ into\n   the default broadcast channel regardless of the existing allocation\n\
    \   of the channel.  If a node wishes to transmit multicast data on other\n  \
    \ than the default channel, it MUST first confirm by MCAP whether or\n   not a\
    \ channel number for the group address has been already\n   allocated.  The implementors\
    \ are encouraged to use this protocol when\n   transmitting high-rate multicast\
    \ streams.\n   The MCAP 'type' value for IPv6 group address descriptor is 2.\n"
