    \  \"FWDR\" is a host\n   name, or nickname for the forwarding host.  Also note\
    \ that for all of\n   these solutions it is assumed that host tables can have\
    \ alternate or\n   nicknames for hosts, e.g., FWDR could map to 86 while ISI also\
    \ maps\n   to 86, although this is not essential.\n   In addition, all these solutions\
    \ provide a single forwarding point\n   from the ARPANET into the destination\
    \ net.\n   All forwarded messages are handled by a routing deamon which lives\
    \ in\n   the FWDR host.\n   Also note that the information shown as the \"outside\"\

    \ into a single\n      mailbox file which the routing deamon examines.  The cheapest\
    \ way\n      to do this is to put all the names of the NSW users in the ARPANET\n\
    \      user forwarding file with the same destination ARPANET mailbox.\n     \
    \ This means the local users of the FWDR host and the users in the\n      destination\
    \ networks share the name space for user names.  The\n      routing deamon has\
    \ to look at the inside header to determine where\n      to forward the messages.\
    \  It has to check the \"To:\" and \"CC:\"\n      lines.\n      This appears to\
    \ be the solution with the minimum change to\n      existing software.  The \"\
    answer\" command works fine.\n      There is a problem with the name space, for\
    \ example, if ISIA\n      serves as FWDR host, then Fred@ISI and Fred@NSW cannot\
    \ co-exist.\n      Further, there is the database update problem.  Every time\
    \ a new\n      user is added to NSW or any of the hosts in any of the nets that\n\
    \      the FWDR host serves the forwarding file at the FWDR host has to\n    \
    \  be updated.  The names added have to be unique so all user names\n      assigned\
    \ in NSW and all the hosts on all the networks served by\n      the same FWDR\
    \ host have to be oked by the \"forwarding file data\n      base administrator\"\
    \ before they can actually be used.  Also note\n      that Fred@NSW and Fred@PRNET\
    \ cannot be routed through the same\n      FWDR host.\n      This doesn't work\
    \ too well, if the sending programs are not\n      changed they will send one\
    \ copy of this message for each NSW user\n      and all these copies will end\
    \ up in the file to be examined by the\n      routing deamon.  If the FTP server\
    \ code is not changed the outside\n      information will be lost and the routing\
    \ deamon will have no idea\n      which NSW user this copy is for.  To do the\
    \ job right with the\n      information available the routing deamon would have\
    \ to keep a\n      substantial record about each message it handled checking to\

    \ solution D is based on the use of strictly \"outside\"\n      information. \
    \ Please note that the existing ARPANET message\n      DELIVERY system is based\
    \ strictly on the use of \"outside\"\n      information only.  Also note that\
    \ the problems that keep coming up\n      in ARPANET message processing & composition\
    \ programs have to do\n      with the different possibilities for syntax (and\
    \ semanitcs) of the\n      \"inside\" information.  This is a major advantage\
    \ of solution D.\n"
