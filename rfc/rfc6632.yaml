  - "1.1.  Scope and Target Audience\n   This document gives an overview of the IETF\
    \ network management\n   standards and summarizes existing and ongoing development\
    \ of IETF\n   Standards Track network management protocols and data models.  The\n\
    \   document refers to other overview documents where they exist and\n   classifies\
    \ the standards for easy orientation.\n   The target audience of the document\
    \ is, on the one hand, IETF working\n   groups, which aim to select appropriate\
    \ standard management protocols\n   and data models to address their needs concerning\
    \ network management.\n   On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview\
    \ and\n   guideline by non-IETF Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)\n \
    \  planning to use IETF management technologies and data models for the\n   realization\
    \ of management applications.  The document can also be\n   used to initiate a\
    \ discussion between the bodies with the goal to\n   gather new requirements and\
    \ to detect possible gaps.  Finally, this\n   document is directed to all interested\
    \ parties that seek to get an\n   overview of the current set of the IETF network\
    \ management protocols\n   such as network administrators or newcomers to the\
    \ IETF.\n   Section 2 gives an overview of the IETF core network management\n\
    \   standards with a special focus on Simple Network Management Protocol\n   (SNMP),\
    \ syslog, IP Flow Information eXport / Packet SAMPling (IPFIX/\n   PSAMP), and\
    \ Network Configuration (NETCONF).  Section 3 discusses\n   IETF management protocols\
    \ and mechanisms with a specific focus, e.g.,\n   IP address management or IP\
    \ performance management.  Section 4\n   discusses IETF data models, such as MIB\
    \ modules, IPFIX Information\n   Elements, Syslog Structured Data Elements, and\
    \ YANG modules designed\n   to address a specific set of management issues and\
    \ provides two\n   complementary overviews for the network management data models\n\
    \   standardized within the IETF.  Section 4.1 focuses on a broader view\n   of\
    \ models classified into categories such as generic and\n   infrastructure data\
    \ models as well as data models matched to\n   different layers.  Whereas Section\
    \ 4.2 structures the data models\n   following the management application view\
    \ and maps them to the\n   network management tasks fault, configuration, accounting,\n\
    \   performance, and security management.\n   Appendix A guides the reader for\
    \ the high-level selection of\n   management standards.  For this, the section\
    \ classifies the protocols\n   according to high-level criteria, such as push\
    \ versus pull\n   mechanisms, passive versus active monitoring, as well as categorizes\n\
    \   the protocols concerning the network management task they address and\n  \
    \ their data model extensibility.  If the reader is interested only in\n   a subset\
    \ of the IETF network management protocols and data models\n   described in this\
    \ document, Appendix A can be used as a dispatcher to\n   the corresponding chapter.\
    \  Appendix B gives an overview of the new\n   work on Energy Management in the\
    \ IETF.\n   This document mainly refers to Proposed, Draft, or Internet Standard\n\
    \   documents from the IETF (see [RFCSEARCH]).  Whenever valuable, Best\n   Current\
    \ Practice (BCP) documents are referenced.  In exceptional\n   cases, and if the\
    \ document provides substantial guideline for\n   standard usage or fills an essential\
    \ gap, Experimental and\n   Informational RFCs are noticed and ongoing work is\
    \ mentioned.\n   Information on active and concluded IETF working groups (e.g.,\
    \ their\n   charters, published or currently active documents, and mail archives)\n\
    \   can be found at [IETF-WGS]).\n   Note that this document does not cover OAM\
    \ technologies on the data-\n   path including MPLS forwarding plane and control\
    \ plane protocols\n   (e.g., OAM of tunnels, MPLS-TP OAM, and pseudowire) as well\
    \ as the\n   corresponding management models and MIB modules.  For a list of\n\
    \   related work, see Section 1.2.\n"

  - "2.1.1.  Architectural Principles of SNMP\n   The SNMPv3 Framework [RFC3410],\
    \ builds upon both the original SNMPv1\n   and SNMPv2 Frameworks.  The basic structure\
    \ and components for the\n   SNMP Framework did not change between its versions\
    \ and comprises the\n   following components:\n   o  managed nodes, each with\
    \ an SNMP entity providing remote access to\n      management instrumentation\
    \ (the agent),\n   o  at least one SNMP entity with management applications (the\n\
    \      manager), and\n   o  a management protocol used to convey management information\n\
    \      between the SNMP entities and management information.\n   During its evolution,\
    \ the fundamental architecture of the SNMP\n   Management Framework remained consistent\
    \ based on a modular\n   architecture, which consists of:\n   o  a generic protocol\
    \ definition independent of the data it is\n      carrying,\n   o  a protocol-independent\
    \ data definition language,\n   o  an information repository containing a data\
    \ set of management\n      information definitions (the Management Information\
    \ Base, or MIB),\n      and\n   o  security and administration.\n   As such, the\

    \   o  the SNMPv3 protocol [STD62],\n   o  the modeling language SMIv2 [STD58],\
    \ and\n   o  the MIB modules for different management issues.\n   The SNMPv3 Framework\
    \ extends the architectural principles of SNMPv1\n   and SNMPv2 by:\n   o  building\
    \ on these three basic architectural components, in some\n      cases, incorporating\
    \ them from the SNMPv2 Framework by reference,\n      and\n   o  by using the\
    \ same layering principles in the definition of new\n      capabilities in the\
    \ security and administration portion of the\n      architecture.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  SNMP and Its Versions
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  SNMP and Its Versions\n   SNMP is based on three conceptual entities:\
    \ Manager, Agent, and the\n   Management Information Base (MIB).  In any configuration,\
    \ at least\n   one manager node runs SNMP management software.  Typically, network\n\
    \   devices, such as bridges, routers, and servers, are equipped with an\n   agent.\
    \  The agent is responsible for providing access to a local MIB\n   of objects\
    \ that reflects the resources and activity at its node.\n   Following the manager-agent\
    \ paradigm, an agent can generate\n   notifications and send them as unsolicited\
    \ messages to the management\n   application.\n   SNMPv2 enhances this basic functionality\
    \ with an Inform PDU, a bulk\n   transfer capability and other functional extensions\
    \ like an\n   administrative model for access control, security extensions, and\n\
    \   Manager-to-Manager communication.  SNMPv2 entities can have a dual\n   role\
    \ as manager and agent.  However, neither SNMPv1 nor SNMPv2 offers\n   sufficient\
    \ security features.  To address the security deficiencies\n   of SNMPv1/v2, SNMPv3\
    \ [STD62] has been issued.\n   \"Coexistence between Version 1, Version 2, and\
    \ Version 3 of the\n   Internet-standard Network Management Framework\" [BCP074]\
    \ gives an\n   overview of the relevant Standard documents on the three SNMP\n\
    \   versions.  The BCP document furthermore describes how to convert MIB\n   modules\
    \ from SMIv1 to SMIv2 format and how to translate notification\n   parameters.\
    \  It also describes the mapping between the message\n   processing and security\
    \ models.\n   SNMP utilizes the MIB, a virtual information store of modules of\n\
    \   managed objects.  Generally, standard MIB modules support common\n   functionality\
    \ in a device.  Operators often define additional MIB\n   modules for their enterprise\
    \ or use the Command Line Interface (CLI)\n   to configure non-standard data in\
    \ managed devices and their\n   interfaces.\n   SNMPv2 Trap and Inform PDUs can\
    \ alert an operator or an application\n   when some aspects of a protocol fail\
    \ or encounter an error condition,\n   and the contents of a notification can\
    \ be used to guide subsequent\n   SNMP polling to gather additional information\
    \ about an event.\n   SNMP is widely used for the monitoring of fault and performance\
    \ data\n   and with its stateless nature, SNMP also works well for status\n  \
    \ polling and determining the operational state of specific\n   functionality.\
    \  The widespread use of counters in standard MIB\n   modules permits the interoperable\
    \ comparison of statistics across\n   devices from different vendors.  Counters\
    \ have been especially useful\n   in monitoring bytes and packets going in and\
    \ out over various\n   protocol interfaces.  SNMP is often used to poll a basic\
    \ parameter of\n   a device (e.g., sysUpTime, which reports the time since the\
    \ last re-\n   initialization of the network management portion of the device)\
    \ to\n   check for operational liveliness and to detect discontinuities in\n \
    \  counters.  Some operators also use SNMP for configuration management\n   in\
    \ their environment (e.g., for systems based on Data Over Cable\n   Service Interface\
    \ Specification (DOCSIS) such as cable modems).\n   SNMPv1 [RFC1157] has been\
    \ declared Historic and its use is not\n   recommended due to its lack of security\
    \ features.  \"Introduction to\n   Community-based SNMPv2\" [RFC1901] is an Experimental\
    \ RFC, which has\n   been declared Historic, and its use is not recommended due\
    \ to its\n   lack of security features.\n   Use of SNMPv3 [STD62] is recommended\
    \ due to its security features,\n   including support for authentication, encryption,\
    \ message timeliness\n   and integrity checking, and fine-grained data access\
    \ controls.  An\n   overview of the SNMPv3 document set is in [RFC3410].\n   Standards\
    \ exist to use SNMP over diverse transport and link-layer\n   protocols, including\
    \ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [STD07],\n   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\

- title: 2.2.  Syslog Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Syslog Protocol\n   Syslog is a mechanism for distribution of logging information\n\
    \   initially used on Unix systems (see [RFC3164] for BSD syslog).  The\n   IETF\
    \ Syslog Protocol [RFC5424] introduces a layered architecture\n   allowing the\
    \ use of any number of transport protocols, including\n   reliable and secure\
    \ transports, for transmission of syslog messages.\n   The Syslog protocol enables\
    \ a machine to send system log messages\n   across networks to event message collectors.\
    \  The protocol is simply\n   designed to transport and distribute these event\
    \ messages.  By\n   default, no acknowledgements of the receipt are made, except\
    \ the\n   reliable delivery extensions specified in [RFC3195] are used.  The\n\
    \   Syslog protocol and process does not require a stringent coordination\n  \
    \ between the transport sender and the receiver.  Indeed, the\n   transmission\
    \ of syslog messages may be started on a device without a\n   receiver being configured,\
    \ or even actually physically present.\n   Conversely, many devices will most\
    \ likely be able to receive messages\n   without explicit configuration or definitions.\n\
    \   BSD syslog had little uniformity for the message format and the\n   content\
    \ of syslog messages.  The body of a BSD syslog message has\n   traditionally\
    \ been unstructured text.  This content is human\n   friendly, but difficult to\
    \ parse for applications.  With the Syslog\n   Protocol [RFC5424], the IETF has\
    \ standardized a new message header\n   format, including timestamp, hostname,\
    \ application, and message ID,\n   to improve filtering, interoperability, and\
    \ correlation between\n   compliant implementations.\n   The Syslog protocol [RFC5424]\
    \ also introduces a mechanism for\n   defining Structured Data Elements (SDEs).\
    \  The SDEs allow vendors to\n   define their own structured data elements to\
    \ supplement standardized\n   elements.  [RFC5675] defines a mapping from SNMP\
    \ notifications to\n   syslog messages.  [RFC5676] defines an SNMP MIB module\
    \ to represent\n   syslog messages for the purpose of sending those syslog messages\
    \ as\n   notifications to SNMP notification receivers.  [RFC5674] defines the\n\
    \   way alarms are sent in syslog, which includes the mapping of ITU-\n   perceived\
    \ severities onto syslog message fields and a number of\n   alarm-specific definitions\
    \ from ITU-T X.733 [ITU-X733] and the IETF\n   Alarm MIB [RFC3877].\n   \"Signed\
    \ Syslog Messages\" [RFC5848] defines a mechanism to add origin\n   authentication,\
    \ message integrity, replay resistance, message\n   sequencing, and detection\
    \ of missing messages to the transmitted\n   syslog messages to be used in conjunction\
    \ with the Syslog protocol.\n   The Syslog protocol's layered architecture provides\
    \ support for a\n   number of transport mappings.  For interoperability purposes\
    \ and\n   especially in managed networks, where the network path has been\n  \
    \ explicitly provisioned for UDP syslog traffic, the Syslog protocol\n   can be\
    \ used over UDP [RFC5426].  However, to support congestion\n   control and reliability,\
    \ [RFC5426] strongly recommends the use of the\n   TLS transport.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the IETF defined the TLS Transport Mapping for syslog in\n   [RFC5425], which\
    \ provides a secure connection for the transport of\n   syslog messages.  [RFC5425]\
    \ describes the security threats to syslog\n   and how TLS can be used to counter\
    \ such threats.  [RFC6012] defines\n   the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\
    \ Transport Mapping for\n   syslog, which can be used if a connectionless transport\
    \ is desired.\n   For information on MIB modules related to syslog, see Section\

    \ the components involved in IP flow\n   measurement and reporting of information\
    \ on IP flows, particularly, a\n   Metering Process generating Flow Records, an\
    \ Exporting Process that\n   sends metered flow information using the IPFIX protocol,\
    \ and a\n   Collecting Process that receives flow information as IPFIX Data\n\
    \   Records.\n   After listing the IPFIX requirements in [RFC3917], NetFlow Version\
    \ 9\n   [RFC3954] was taken as the basis for the IPFIX protocol and the IPFIX\n\
    \   architecture.\n   IPFIX can run over different transport protocols.  The IPFIX\
    \ Protocol\n   [RFC5101] specifies Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\n\
    \   [RFC4960] as the mandatory transport protocol to implement.  Optional\n  \
    \ alternatives are TCP [STD07] and UDP [STD06].\n   SCTP is used with its Partial\
    \ Reliability extension (PR-SCTP)\n   specified in [RFC3758].  [RFC6526] specifies\
    \ an extension to\n   [RFC5101], when using the PR-SCTP [RFC3758].  The extension\
    \ offers\n   several advantages over IPFIX export, e.g., the ability to calculate\n\
    \   Data Record losses for PR-SCTP, immediate reuse of Template IDs\n   within\
    \ an SCTP stream, reduced likelihood of Data Record loss, and\n   reduced demands\
    \ on the Collecting Process.\n   IPFIX transmits IP flow information in Data Records\
    \ containing IPFIX\n   Information Elements (IEs) defined by the IPFIX Information\
    \ Model\n   [RFC5102].  IPFIX IEs are quantities with unit and semantics defined\n\
    \   by the Information Model.  When transmitted over the IPFIX protocol,\n   only\
    \ their values need to be carried in Data Records.  This compact\n   encoding\
    \ allows efficient transport of large numbers of measured flow\n   values.  Remaining\
    \ redundancy in Data Records can be further reduced\n   by the methods described\
    \ in [RFC5473] (for further discussion on\n   IPFIX IEs, see Section 4).\n   The\
    \ IPFIX Information Model is extensible.  New IEs can be registered\n   at IANA\
    \ (see \"IPFIX Information Elements\" in [IANA-PROT]).  IPFIX\n   also supports\
    \ the use of proprietary, i.e., enterprise-specific IEs.\n   The PSAMP protocol\
    \ [RFC5476] extends the IPFIX protocol by means of\n   transferring information\
    \ on individual packets.  [RFC5475] specifies\n   a set of sampling and filtering\
    \ techniques for IP packet selection,\n   based on the PSAMP Framework [RFC5474].\
    \  The PSAMP Information Model\n   [RFC5477] provides a set of basic IEs for reporting\
    \ packet\n   information with the IPFIX/PSAMP protocol.\n   The IPFIX model of\
    \ an IP traffic flow is unidirectional.  [RFC5103]\n   adds means of reporting\
    \ bidirectional flows to IPFIX, for example,\n   both directions of packet flows\
    \ of a TCP connection.\n   When enterprise-specific IEs are transmitted with IPFIX,\
    \ a Collector\n   receiving Data Records may not know the type of received data\
    \ and\n   cannot choose the right format for storing the contained information.\n\
    \   [RFC5610] provides a means of exporting extended type information for\n  \
    \ enterprise-specific Information Elements from an Exporter to a\n   Collector.\n\
    \   Collectors may store received flow information in files.  The IPFIX\n   file\
    \ format [RFC5655] can be used for storing IP flow information in\n   a way that\
    \ facilitates exchange of traffic flow information between\n   different systems\
    \ and applications.\n   In terms of IPFIX and PSAMP configurations, the Metering\
    \ and\n   Exporting Processes are configured out of band.  As the IPFIX\n   protocol\
    \ is a push mechanism only, IPFIX cannot configure the\n   Exporter.  The actual\
    \ configuration of selection processes, caches,\n   Exporting Processes, and Collecting\
    \ Processes of IPFIX- and PSAMP-\n   compliant monitoring devices is executed\
    \ using the NETCONF protocol\n   [RFC6241] (see Section 2.4.1).  The \"Configuration\
    \ Data Model for\n   IPFIX and PSAMP\" (the IPFIX Configuration Data Model) [CONF-MODEL]\n\
    \   has been specified using Unified Modeling Language (UML) class\n   diagrams.\
    \  The data model is formally defined using the YANG modeling\n   language [RFC6020]\
    \ (see Section 2.4.2).\n   At the time of this writing, a framework for IPFIX\
    \ flow mediation is\n   in preparation, which addresses the need for mediation\
    \ of flow\n   information in IPFIX applications in large operator networks, e.g.,\n\
    \   for aggregating huge amounts of flow data and for anonymization of\n   flow\
    \ information (see the problem statement in [RFC5982]).\n   The IPFIX Mediation\
    \ Framework [RFC6183] defines the intermediate\n   device between Exporters and\
    \ Collectors, which provides an IPFIX\n   mediation by receiving a record stream\
    \ from, e.g., a Collecting\n   Process, hosting one or more Intermediate Processes\
    \ to transform this\n   stream, and exporting the transformed record stream into\
    \ IPFIX\n   messages via an Exporting Process.\n   Examples for mediation functions\
    \ are flow aggregation, flow\n   selection, and anonymization of traffic information\
    \ (see [RFC6235]).\n   Privacy, integrity, and authentication of the Exporter\
    \ and Collector\n   are important security requirements for IPFIX [RFC3917].\n\
    \   Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of IPFIX data\n   transferred\
    \ from an Exporting Process to a Collecting Process must be\n   ensured.  The\
    \ IPFIX and PSAMP protocols do not define any new\n   security mechanisms and\
    \ rely on the security mechanism of the\n   underlying transport protocol, such\
    \ as TLS [RFC5246] and DTLS\n   [RFC6347].\n   The primary goal of IPFIX is the\
    \ reporting of the flow accounting for\n   flexible flow definitions and usage-based\
    \ accounting.  As described\n   in the IPFIX Applicability Statement [RFC5472],\
    \ there are also other\n   applications such as traffic profiling, traffic engineering,\n\
    \   intrusion detection, and QoS monitoring, that require flow-based\n   traffic\
    \ measurements and can be realized using IPFIX.  Furthermore,\n   the IPFIX Applicability\
    \ Statement explains the relation of IPFIX to\n   other framework and protocols\
    \ such as PSAMP, RMON (Remote Network\n   Monitoring MIB, Section 4.2.1), and\
    \ IPPM (IP Performance Metrics,\n   Section 3.4)).  Similar flow information could\
    \ be also used for\n   security monitoring.  The addition of Performance Metrics\
    \ in the\n   IPFIX IANA registry [IANA-IPFIX], will extend the IPFIX use case\
    \ to\n   performance management.\n   Note that even if the initial IPFIX focus\
    \ has been around IP flow\n   information exchange, non-IP-related IEs are now\
    \ specified in the\n   IPFIX IANA registration (e.g., MAC (Media Access Control)\
    \ address,\n   MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) labels, etc.).  At the time\
    \ of\n   this writing, there are requests to widen the focus of IPFIX and to\n\
    \   export non-IP related IEs (such as SIP monitoring IEs).\n   The IPFIX structured\
    \ data [RFC6313] is an extension to the IPFIX\n   protocol, which supports hierarchical\
    \ structured data and lists\n   (sequences) of Information Elements in Data Records.\

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)\n   The IAB workshop on Network\
    \ Management [RFC3535] determined advanced\n   requirements for configuration\
    \ management:\n   o  robustness: Minimizing disruptions and maximizing stability,\n\
    \   o  a task-oriented view,\n   o  extensibility for new operations,\n   o  standardized\
    \ error handling,\n   o  clear distinction between configuration data and operational\n\
    \      state,\n   o  distribution of configurations to devices under transactional\n\
    \      constraints,\n   o  single- and multi-system transactions and scalability\
    \ in the\n      number of transactions and managed devices,\n   o  operations\
    \ on selected subsets of management data,\n   o  dumping and reloading a device\
    \ configuration in a textual format\n      in a standard manner across multiple\
    \ vendors and device types,\n   o  a human interface and a programmatic interface,\n\
    \   o  a data modeling language with a human-friendly syntax,\n   o  easy conflict\
    \ detection and configuration validation, and\n   o  secure transport, authentication,\
    \ and robust access control.\n   The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] provides mechanisms\
    \ to install,\n   manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices\
    \ and aims\n   to address the configuration management requirements pointed out\
    \ in\n   the IAB workshop.  It uses an XML-based data encoding for the\n   configuration\
    \ data as well as the protocol messages.  The NETCONF\n   protocol operations\
    \ are realized on top of a simple and reliable\n   Remote Procedure Call (RPC)\
    \ layer.  A key aspect of NETCONF is that\n   it allows the functionality of the\
    \ management protocol to closely\n   mirror the native command-line interface\
    \ of the device.\n   The NETCONF working group developed the NETCONF Event Notifications\n\
    \   Mechanism as an optional capability, which provides an asynchronous\n   message\
    \ notification delivery service for NETCONF [RFC5277].  The\n   NETCONF notification\
    \ mechanism enables using general purpose\n   notification streams, where the\
    \ originator of the notification stream\n   can be any managed device (e.g., SNMP\
    \ notifications).\n   The NETCONF Partial Locking specification introduces fine-grained\n\
    \   locking of the configuration datastore to enhance NETCONF for fine-\n   grained\
    \ transactions on parts of the datastore [RFC5717].\n   The NETCONF working group\
    \ also defined the necessary data model to\n   monitor the NETCONF protocol [RFC6022],\
    \ by using the modeling\n   language YANG [RFC6020] (see Section 2.4.2).  The\
    \ monitoring data\n   model includes information about NETCONF datastores, sessions,\
    \ locks,\n   and statistics, which facilitate the management of a NETCONF server.\n\
    \   NETCONF connections are required to provide authentication, data\n   integrity,\
    \ confidentiality, and replay protection.  NETCONF depends\n   on the underlying\
    \ transport protocol for this capability.  For\n   example, connections can be\
    \ encrypted in TLS or SSH, depending on the\n   underlying protocol.\n   The NETCONF\
    \ working group defined the SSH transport protocol as the\n   mandatory transport\
    \ binding [RFC6242].  Other optional transport\n   bindings are TLS [RFC5539],\
    \ Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol\n   (BEEP) over TLS [RFC4744], and Simple\
    \ Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\n   over HTTP over TLS [RFC4743].\n   The NETCONF\
    \ Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides standard\n   mechanisms to restrict\
    \ protocol access to particular users with a\n   pre-configured subset of operations\
    \ and content.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  YANG - NETCONF Data Modeling Language
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  YANG - NETCONF Data Modeling Language\n   Following the guidelines of\
    \ the IAB management workshop [RFC3535],\n   the NETMOD working group developed\
    \ a data modeling language defining\n   the semantics of operational and configuration\
    \ data, notifications,\n   and operations [RFC6020].  The new data modeling language,\
    \ called\n   YANG, maps directly to XML-encoded content (on the wire) and will\n\
    \   serve as the normative description of NETCONF data models.\n   YANG has the\
    \ following properties addressing specific requirements on\n   a modeling language\
    \ for configuration management:\n   o  YANG provides the means to define hierarchical\
    \ data models.  It\n      supports reusable data types and groupings, i.e., a\
    \ set of schema\n      nodes that can be reused across module boundaries.\n  \
    \ o  YANG supports the distinction between configuration and state\n      data.\
    \  In addition, it provides support for modeling event\n      notifications and\
    \ the specification of operations that extend the\n      base NETCONF operations.\n\
    \   o  YANG allows the expression of constraints on data models by means\n   \
    \   of type restrictions and XML Path Language (XPATH) 1.0 [XPATH]\n      expressions.\
    \  XPATH expressions can also be used to make certain\n      portions of a data\
    \ model conditional.\n   o  YANG supports the integration of standard- and vendor-defined\
    \ data\n      models.  YANG's augmentation mechanism allows the seamless\n   \
    \   augmentation of standard data models with proprietary extensions.\n   o  YANG\
    \ data models can be partitioned into collections of features,\n      allowing\
    \ low-end devices only to implement the core features of a\n      data model while\
    \ high-end devices may choose to support all\n      features.  The supported features\
    \ are announced via the NETCONF\n      capability exchange to management applications.\n\
    \   o  The syntax of the YANG language is compact and optimized for human\n  \
    \    readers.  An associated XML-based syntax called the YANG\n      Independent\
    \ Notation (YIN) [RFC6020] is available to allow the\n      processing of YANG\
    \ data models with XML-based tools.  The mapping\n      rules for the translation\
    \ of YANG data models into Document Schema\n      Definition Languages (DSDL),\
    \ of which RELAX NG is a major\n      component, are defined in [RFC6110].\n \
    \  o  Devices implementing standard data models can document deviations\n    \
    \  from the data model in separate YANG modules.  Applications\n      capable\
    \ of discovering deviations can make allowances that would\n      otherwise not\
    \ be possible.\n   A collection of common data types for IETF-related standards\
    \ is\n   provided in [RFC6021].  This standard data type library has been\n  \
    \ derived to a large extend from common SMIv2 data types, generalizing\n   them\
    \ to a less-constrained NETCONF Framework.\n   The document \"An Architecture\
    \ for Network Management using NETCONF\n   and YANG\" describes how NETCONF and\
    \ YANG can be used to build network\n   management applications that meet the\
    \ needs of network operators\n   [RFC6244].\n   The Experimental RFC [RFC6095]\
    \ specifies extensions for YANG,\n   introducing language abstractions such as\
    \ class inheritance and\n   recursive data structures.\n   [RFC6087] gives guidelines\
    \ for the use of YANG within the IETF and\n   other standardization organizations.\n\
    \   Work is underway to standardize a translation of SMIv2 data models\n   into\
    \ YANG data models preserving investments into SNMP MIB modules,\n   which are\
    \ widely available for monitoring purposes [SMI-YANG].\n   Several independent\
    \ and open source implementations of the YANG data\n   modeling language and associated\
    \ tools are available.\n   While YANG is a relatively recent data modeling language,\
    \ some data\n   models have already been produced.  The specification of the base\n\
    \   NETCONF protocol operations has been revised and uses YANG as the\n   normative\
    \ modeling language to specify its operations [RFC6241].  The\n   IPFIX working\
    \ group prepared the normative model for configuring and\n   monitoring IPFIX-\
    \ and PSAMP-compliant monitoring devices using the\n   YANG modeling language\
    \ [CONF-MODEL].\n   At the time of this writing, the NETMOD working group is developing\n\
    \   core system and interface data models.  Following the example of the\n   IPFIX\
    \ configuration model, IETF working groups will prepare models\n   for their specific\
    \ needs.\n   For information on data models developed using the YANG modeling\n\
    \   language, see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.\n"

    \ Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] provides a\n   framework for passing configuration\
    \ information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n   network and, as such, enables autoconfiguration\
    \ in IP networks.  In\n   addition to IP address management, DHCP can also provide\
    \ other\n   configuration information, such as default routers, the IP addresses\n\
    \   of recursive DNS servers, and the IP addresses of NTP servers.  As\n   described\
    \ in [RFC6272], DHCP can be used for IPv4 and IPv6 Address\n   Allocation and\
    \ Assignment as well as for Service Discovery.\n   There are two versions of DHCP:\
    \ one for IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and\n   one for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315].  DHCPv4\

  - "3.5.  Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)\n   \"Remote Authentication\
    \ Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\" [RFC2865]\n   describes a client/server protocol\
    \ for carrying authentication,\n   authorization, and configuration information\
    \ between a Network Access\n   Server (NAS), which desires to authenticate its\
    \ links, and a shared\n   authentication server.  The companion document \"Radius\
    \ Accounting\"\n   [RFC2866] describes a protocol for carrying accounting information\n\
    \   between a NAS and a shared accounting server.  [RFC2867] adds\n   required\
    \ new RADIUS accounting attributes and new values designed to\n   support the\
    \ provision of tunneling in dial-up networks.\n   The RADIUS protocol is widely\
    \ used in environments like enterprise\n   networks, where a single administrative\
    \ authority manages the network\n   and protects the privacy of user information.\
    \  RADIUS is deployed in\n   the networks of fixed broadband access provider as\
    \ well as cellular\n   broadband operators.\n   RADIUS uses attributes to carry\
    \ the specific authentication,\n   authorization, information, and configuration\
    \ details.  RADIUS is\n   extensible with a known limitation of a maximum of 255\
    \ attribute\n   codes and 253 octets as attribute content length.  RADIUS has\
    \ Vendor-\n   Specific Attributes (VSAs), which have been used both for vendor-\n\
    \   specific purposes (as an addition to standardized attributes) as well\n  \
    \ as to extend the limited attribute code space.\n   The RADIUS protocol uses\
    \ a shared secret along with the MD5 hash\n   algorithm to secure passwords [RFC1321].\
    \  Based on the known threads,\n   additional protection like IPsec tunnels [RFC4301]\
    \ are used to\n   further protect the RADIUS traffic.  However, building and\n\
    \   administering large IPsec-protected networks may become a management\n   burden,\

    \ inter-provider connectivity.  Moving towards TLS-based\n   security solutions\
    \ [RFC5246] and establishing dynamic trust\n   relationships between RADIUS servers\
    \ has become a trend.  Since the\n   introduction of TCP transport for RADIUS\

    \ tunneling, i.e., the tunnel is created without any\n   action from the user\
    \ and without allowing the user any choice in the\n   matter.  In order to provide\
    \ this functionality, specific RADIUS\n   attributes are needed to carry the tunneling\
    \ information from the\n   RADIUS server to the tunnel end points.  \"Signalling\

- title: 3.6.  Diameter Base Protocol (Diameter)
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Diameter Base Protocol (Diameter)\n   Diameter [RFC3588] provides an Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and\n   Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such as network\
    \ access or\n   IP mobility.  Diameter is also intended to work in local AAA and\
    \ in\n   roaming scenarios.  Diameter provides an upgrade path for RADIUS but\n\
    \   is not directly backwards compatible.\n   Diameter is designed to resolve\
    \ a number of known problems with\n   RADIUS.  Diameter supports server failover,\
    \ reliable transport over\n   TCP and SCTP, well-documented functions for proxy,\
    \ redirect and relay\n   agent functions, server-initiated messages, auditability,\
    \ and\n   capability negotiation.  Diameter also provides a larger attribute\n\
    \   space for Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) and identifiers than RADIUS.\n   Diameter\
    \ features make it especially appropriate for environments,\n   where the providers\
    \ of services are in different administrative\n   domains than the maintainer\
    \ (protector) of confidential user\n   information.\n   Other notable differences\
    \ to RADIUS are as follows:\n   o  Network and Transport Layer Security (IPsec\
    \ or TLS),\n   o  Stateful and stateless models,\n   o  Dynamic discovery of peers\
    \ (using DNS Service Record (SRV) and\n      Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR)),\n\
    \   o  Concept of an application that describes how a specific set of\n      commands\
    \ and Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) are treated by diameter\n      nodes.  Each\
    \ application has an IANA-assigned unique identifier,\n   o  Support of application\
    \ layer acknowledgements, failover methods\n      and state machines,\n   o  Basic\
    \ support for user-sessions and accounting,\n   o  Better roaming support,\n \
    \  o  Error notification, and\n   o  Easy extensibility.\n   The Diameter protocol\
    \ is designed to be extensible to support, e.g.,\n   proxies, brokers, mobility\
    \ and roaming, Network Access Servers\n   (NASREQ), and Accounting and Resource\
    \ Management.  Diameter\n   applications extend the Diameter base protocol by\
    \ adding new commands\n   and/or attributes.  Each application is defined by a\
    \ unique IANA-\n   assigned application identifier and can add new command codes\
    \ and/or\n   new mandatory AVPs.\n   The Diameter application identifier space\
    \ has been divided into\n   Standards Track and 'First Come First Served' vendor-specific\n\
    \   applications.  The following are examples of Diameter applications\n   published\
    \ at IETF:\n   o  Diameter Base Protocol Application [RFC3588]: Required support\n\
    \      from all Diameter implementations.\n   o  Diameter Base Accounting Application\
    \ [RFC3588]: A Diameter\n      application using an accounting protocol based\

    \ rendered\n      to a mobile node.\n   o  Diameter Network Access Server Application\
    \ (NASREQ, [RFC4005]): A\n      Diameter application used for AAA services in\
    \ the NAS environment.\n   o  Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol Application\
    \ [RFC4072]:\n      A Diameter application that carries EAP packets between a\
    \ NAS and\n      a back-end authentication server.\n   o  Diameter Credit-Control\
    \ Application [RFC4006]: A Diameter\n      application that can be used to implement\
    \ real-time credit-control\n      for a variety of end-user services such as network\
    \ access, Session\n      Initiation Protocol (SIP) services, messaging services,\
    \ and\n      download services.\n   o  Diameter Session Initiation Protocol Application\
    \ [RFC4740]: A\n      Diameter application designed to be used in conjunction\
    \ with SIP\n      and provides a Diameter client co-located with a SIP server,\
    \ with\n      the ability to request the authentication of users and\n      authorization\
    \ of SIP resources usage from a Diameter server.\n   o  Diameter Quality-of-Service\
    \ Application [RFC5866]: A Diameter\n      application allowing network elements\
    \ to interact with Diameter\n      servers when allocating QoS resources in the\
    \ network.\n   o  Diameter Mobile IPv6 IKE (MIP6I) Application [RFC5778]: A Diameter\n\
    \      application that enables the interaction between a Mobile IP home\n   \
    \   agent and a Diameter server and is used when the mobile node is\n      authenticated\
    \ and authorized using IKEv2 [RFC5996].\n   o  Diameter Mobile IPv6 Auth (MIP6A)\
    \ Application [RFC5778]: A\n      Diameter application that enables the interaction\
    \ between a Mobile\n      IP home agent and a Diameter server and is used when\
    \ the mobile\n      node is authenticated and authorized using the Mobile IPv6\n\
    \      Authentication Protocol [RFC4285].\n   The large majority of Diameter applications\
    \ are vendor-specific and\n   mainly used in various SDOs outside the IETF.  One\
    \ example SDO using\n   diameter extensively is 3GPP (e.g., 3GPP 'IP Multimedia\
    \ Subsystem'\n   (IMS) uses diameter-based interfaces (e.g., Cx) [3GPPIMS]).\n\
    \   Recently, during the standardization of the '3GPP Evolved Packet\n   Core'\
    \ [3GPPEPC], diameter was chosen as the only AAA signaling\n   protocol.\n   One\
    \ part of diameter's extensibility mechanism is an easy and\n   consistent way\
    \ of creating new commands for the need of applications.\n   RFC 3588 proposed\
    \ to define diameter command code allocations with a\n   new RFC.  This policy\
    \ decision caused undesired use and redefinition\n   of existing command codes\
    \ within SDOs.  Diverse RFCs have been\n   published as simple command code allocations\
    \ for other SDO purposes\n   (see [RFC3589], [RFC5224], [RFC5431], and [RFC5516]).\
    \  [RFC5719]\n   changed the command code policy and added a range for vendor-specific\n\
    \   command codes to be allocated on a 'First Come First Served' basis by\n  \
    \ IANA.\n   The implementation and deployment experience of diameter has led to\n\
    \   the ongoing development of an update of the base protocol [DIAMETER],\n  \
    \ which introduces TLS as the preferred security mechanism and\n   deprecates\
    \ the in-band security negotiation for TLS.\n   Some Diameter protocol enhancements\
    \ and clarifications that logically\n   fit better into [DIAMETER], are also needed\
    \ on the existing\n   deployments based on RFC 3588.  Therefore, protocol extensions\n\
    \   specifically usable in large inter-provider roaming network scenarios\n  \
    \ are made available for RFC 3588.  Two currently existing\n   specifications\
    \ are mentioned below:\n   o  \"Clarifications on the Routing of Diameter Requests\
    \ Based on the\n      Username and the Realm\" [RFC5729] defines the behavior\
    \ required\n      for Diameter agents to route requests when the User-Name AVP\n\
    \      contains a NAI formatted with multiple realms.  These multi-realm\n   \
    \   Network Access Identifiers are used in order to force the routing\n      of\
    \ request messages through a predefined list of mediating realms.\n   o  \"Diameter\
    \ Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR)\n      Usage\" [RFC6408]\
    \ describes an improved DNS-based dynamic Diameter\n      agent discovery mechanism\
    \ without having to do diameter capability\n      exchange beforehand with a number\
    \ of agents.\n   There have been a growing number of Diameter Framework documents\
    \ from\n   the IETF that basically are just a collection of AVPs for a specific\n\
    \   purpose or a system architecture with semantic AVP descriptions and a\n  \
    \ logic for \"imaginary\" applications.  From a standardization point of\n   view,\
    \ this practice allows the development of larger system\n   architecture documents\
    \ that do not need to reference AVPs or\n   application logic outside the IETF.\
    \  Below are examples of a few\n   recent AVP and Framework documents:\n   o \
    \ \"Diameter Mobile IPv6: Support for Network Access Server to\n      Diameter\
    \ Server Interaction\" [RFC5447] describes the bootstrapping\n      of the Mobile\
    \ IPv6 framework and the support of interworking with\n      existing AAA infrastructures\
    \ by using the diameter NAS-to-home-AAA\n      server interface.\n   o  \"Traffic\
    \ Classification and Quality of Service (QoS) Attributes\n      for Diameter\"\
    \ [RFC5777] defines a number of Diameter AVPs for\n      traffic classification\
    \ with actions for filtering and QoS\n      treatment.\n   o  \"Diameter Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6: Mobile Access Gateway and Local\n      Mobility Anchor Interaction\
    \ with Diameter Server\" [RFC5779]\n      defines AAA interactions between Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)\n      entities (MAG and LMA) and a AAA server within a\
    \ PMIPv6 Domain.\n   For information on MIB modules related to diameter, see\n\

    \ overviews for the network\n   management data models standardized at IETF. \
    \ The first subsection\n   focuses on a broader view of models classified into\
    \ categories such\n   as generic and infrastructure data models as well as data\
    \ models\n   matched to different layers.  The second subsection is structured\n\
    \   following the management application view and focuses mainly on the\n   data\
    \ models for the network management tasks fault, configuration,\n   accounting,\
    \ performance, and security management (see [FCAPS]).\n   Note that the IETF does\
    \ not use the FCAPS view as an organizing\n   principle for its data models. \
    \ However, the FCAPS view is used\n   widely outside of the IETF for the realization\

    \ well as to\n   maintain and examine error logs.  The data models below can be\n\
    \   utilized to realize a fault management application.\n   [RFC3418], part of\
    \ SNMPv3 standard [STD62], is a MIB module\n   containing objects in the system\
    \ group that are often polled to\n   determine if a device is still operating,\
    \ and sysUpTime can be used\n   to detect if the network management portion of\
    \ the system has\n   restarted and counters have been re-initialized.\n   [RFC3413],\
    \ part of SNMPv3 standard [STD62], is a MIB module including\n   objects designed\
    \ for managing notifications, including tables for\n   addressing, retry parameters,\
    \ security, lists of targets for\n   notifications, and user customization filters.\n\
    \   The Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] builds on the old standard for MIB\n  \
    \ II [STD17] and is used as a primary MIB module for managing and\n   monitoring\
    \ the status of network interfaces.  The Interfaces Group\n   MIB defines a generic\
    \ set of managed objects for network interfaces,\n   and it provides the infrastructure\
    \ for additional managed objects\n   specific to particular types of network interfaces,\
    \ such as Ethernet.\n   [RFC4560] defines a MIB module for performing ping, traceroute,\
    \ and\n   lookup operations at a host.  For troubleshooting purposes, it is\n\
    \   useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or\n   traceroute\
    \ operations when they are performed at a remote host.\n   The RMON (Remote Network\
    \ Monitoring) MIB [STD59] can be configured to\n   recognize conditions on existing\
    \ MIB variables (most notably error\n   conditions) and continuously check for\
    \ them.  When one of these\n   conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and\
    \ management stations\n   may be notified in a number of ways (for further discussion\
    \ on RMON,\n   see Section 4.2.4).\n   DISMAN-EVENT-MIB in [RFC2981] and DISMAN-EXPRESSION-MIB\
    \ in [RFC2982]\n   provide a superset of the capabilities of the RMON alarm and\
    \ event\n   groups.  These modules provide mechanisms for thresholding and\n \
    \  reporting anomalous events to management applications.\n   The Alarm MIB in\
    \ [RFC3877] and the Alarm Reporting Control MIB in\n   [RFC3878] specify mechanisms\
    \ for expressing state transition models\n   for persistent problem states.  Alarm\
    \ MIB defines the following:\n   o  a mechanism for expressing state transition\
    \ models for persistent\n      problem states,\n   o  a mechanism to correlate\
    \ a notification with subsequent state\n      transition notifications about the\
    \ same entity/object, and\n   o  a generic alarm reporting mechanism (extends\
    \ ITU-T work on X.733\n      [ITU-X733]).\n   In particular, [RFC3878] defines\
    \ objects for controlling the\n   reporting of alarm conditions and extends ITU-T\
    \ work on M.3100\n   Amendment 3 [ITU-M3100].\n   Other MIB modules that may be\
    \ applied to fault management with SNMP\n   include:\n   o  NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB\
    \ [RFC3014] describes managed objects used for\n      logging SNMP Notifications.\n\

    \   to provide information about the state of physical entities.\n   o  ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB\
    \ [RFC3433] describes managed objects for\n      extending the Entity MIB to provide\
    \ generalized access to\n      information related to physical sensors, which\
    \ are often found in\n      networking equipment (such as chassis temperature,\
    \ fan RPM, power\n      supply voltage).\n   The Syslog protocol document [RFC5424]\
    \ defines an initial set of SDEs\n   that relate to content time quality, content\
    \ origin, and meta-\n   information about the message, such as language.  Proprietary\
    \ SDEs\n   can be used to supplement the IETF-defined SDEs.\n   The IETF has standardized\
    \ MIB Textual-Conventions for facility and\n   severity labels and codes to encourage\
    \ consistency between syslog and\n   MIB representations of these event properties\
    \ [RFC5427].  The intent\n   is that these textual conventions will be imported\
    \ and used in MIB\n   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.\n\
    \   An IPFIX MIB module [RFC5815] has been defined for monitoring IPFIX\n   Meters,\
    \ Exporters, and Collectors (see Section 2.3).  The ongoing\n   work on the PSAMP\
    \ MIB module extends the IPFIX MIB modules by managed\n   objects for monitoring\
    \ PSAMP implementations [PSAMP-MIB].\n   The NETCONF working group defined the\
    \ data model necessary to monitor\n   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6022] with the\
    \ modeling language YANG.  The\n   monitoring data model includes information\
    \ about NETCONF datastores,\n   sessions, locks, and statistics, which facilitate\
    \ the management of a\n   NETCONF server.  The NETCONF monitoring document also\

- title: 4.2.5.  Security Management
  contents:
  - "4.2.5.  Security Management\n   Security management provides the set of functions\
    \ to protect the\n   network and system from unauthorized access and includes\
    \ functions\n   such as creating, deleting, and controlling security services\
    \ and\n   mechanisms, key management, reporting security-relevant events, and\n\
    \   authorizing user access and privileges.  Based on their support for\n   authentication\
    \ and authorization, RADIUS and diameter are seen as\n   security management protocols.\
    \  The data models below can be used to\n   utilize security management.\n   [RFC3414],\
    \ part of [STD62], specifies the procedures for providing\n   SNMPv3 message-level\
    \ security and includes a MIB module for remotely\n   monitoring and managing\
    \ the configuration parameters for the USM.\n   [RFC3415], part of [STD62], describes\
    \ the procedures for controlling\n   access to management information in the SNMPv3\
    \ architecture and\n   includes a MIB module, which defines managed objects to\
    \ access\n   portions of an SNMP engine's Local Configuration Datastore (LCD).\
    \  As\n   such, this MIB module enables remote management of the configuration\n\
    \   parameters of the VACM.\n   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC6536]\
    \ addresses the need\n   for access control mechanisms for the operation and content\
    \ layers of\n   NETCONF, as defined in [RFC6241].  As such, the NACM proposes\n\
    \   standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for\n   particular\
    \ users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF\n   protocol operations\
    \ and content within a particular server.\n   There are numerous MIB modules defined\
    \ for multiple purposes to use\n   with RADIUS:\n   o  \"RADIUS Authentication\
    \ Client MIB for IPv6\" [RFC4668] defines\n      RADIUS Authentication Client\
    \ MIB objects that support version-\n      neutral IP addressing formats and defines\
    \ a set of extensions for\n      RADIUS authentication client functions.\n   o\
    \  \"RADIUS Authentication Server MIB for IPv6\" [RFC4669] defines\n      RADIUS\
    \ Authentication Server MIB objects that support version-\n      neutral IP addressing\
    \ formats and defines a set of extensions for\n      RADIUS authentication server\
    \ functions.\n   o  \"RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB\" [RFC4672] defines\
    \ the\n      MIB module for entities implementing the client side of the\n   \
    \   Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS [RFC5176].\n   o  \"RADIUS Dynamic\
    \ Authorization Server MIB\" [RFC4673] defines the\n      MIB module for entities\
    \ implementing the server side of the\n      Dynamic Authorization Extensions\
    \ to RADIUS [RFC5176].\n   The MIB Module definitions in [RFC4668], [RFC4669],\
    \ [RFC4672],\n   [RFC4673] are intended to be used only for RADIUS over UDP and\
    \ do not\n   support RADIUS over TCP.  There is also a recommendation that RADIUS\n\
    \   clients and servers implementing RADIUS over TCP should not reuse\n   earlier\
    \ listed MIB modules to perform statistics counting for RADIUS-\n   over-TCP connections.\n\
    \   Currently, there are no standardized MIB modules for diameter\n   applications,\
    \ which can be considered as a lack on the management\n   side of diameter nodes.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  High-Level Classification of Management Protocols and Data\n   \
    \          Models\n   The following subsections aim to guide the reader for the\
    \ fast\n   selection of the management standard in interest and can be used as\
    \ a\n   dispatcher to forward to the appropriate chapter.  The subsections\n \
    \  below classify the protocols on one hand according to high-level\n   criteria\
    \ such as push versus pull mechanism, and passive versus\n   active monitoring.\
    \  On the other hand, the protocols are categorized\n   concerning the network\
    \ management task they address or the data model\n   extensibility they provide.\
    \  Based on the reader's requirements, a\n   reduced set of standard protocols\
    \ and associated data models can be\n   selected for further reading.\n   As an\
    \ example, someone outside of IETF typically would look for the\n   TWAMP protocol\
    \ in the Operations and Management Area working groups\n   as it addresses performance\
    \ management.  However, the protocol TWAMP\n   has been developed by the IPPM\
    \ working group in the Transport Area.\n   Note that not all protocols have been\
    \ listed in all classification\n   sections.  Some of the protocols, especially\
    \ the protocols with\n   specific focus in Section 3 cannot be clearly classified.\
    \  Note also\n   that COPS and COPS-PR are not listed in the tables, as COPS-PR\
    \ is not\n   recommended to use (see Section 3.3).\n"

  - "A.4.  Passive versus Active Monitoring\n   Monitoring can be divided into two\
    \ categories: passive and active\n   monitoring.  Passive monitoring can perform\
    \ the network traffic\n   monitoring, monitoring of a device, or the accounting\
    \ of network\n   resource consumption by users.  Active monitoring, as used in\
    \ this\n   document, focuses mainly on active network monitoring and relies on\n\
    \   the injection of specific traffic (also called \"synthetic traffic\"),\n \
    \  which is then monitored.  The monitoring focus is indicated in the\n   table\
    \ below as \"network\", \"device\", or \"accounting\".\n   This classification\
    \ excludes non-monitoring protocols, such as\n   configuration protocols: Ad hoc\
    \ network autoconfiguration, ANCP, and\n   XCAP.  Note that some of the active\
    \ monitoring protocols, in the\n   context of the data path, e.g., ICMP Ping and\
    \ Traceroute [RFC1470],\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880],\
    \ and PWE3 Virtual\n   Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085] are\

    \ traffic monitoring (e.g., with\n   RMON-MIB) or active monitoring (with IPPM\
    \ MIB) depends on the MIB\n   modules used.  However, the SNMP protocol itself\
    \ does not have\n   operations, which support active monitoring.  NETCONF can\
    \ be used for\n   passive monitoring, e.g., with the NETCONF Monitoring YANG module\n\
    \   [RFC6022] for the monitoring of the NETCONF protocol.  CAPWAP\n   monitors\
    \ the status of a Wireless Termination Point.\n   RADIUS and diameter are considered\
    \ passive monitoring protocols as\n   they perform accounting, i.e., counting\
    \ the number of packets/bytes\n   for a specific user.\n"

- title: B.1.  Energy Management (EMAN)
  contents:
  - "B.1.  Energy Management (EMAN)\n   Energy management is becoming an additional\
    \ requirement for network\n   management systems due to several factors including\
    \ the rising and\n   fluctuating energy costs, the increased awareness of the\
    \ ecological\n   impact of operating networks and devices, and government regulation\n\
    \   on energy consumption and production.\n   The basic objective of energy management\
    \ is operating communication\n   networks and other equipment with a minimal amount\
    \ of energy while\n   still providing sufficient performance to meet service-level\n\
    \   objectives.  Today, most networking and network-attached devices\n   neither\
    \ monitor nor allow controlled energy usage as they are mainly\n   instrumented\
    \ for functions such as fault, configuration, accounting,\n   performance, and\
    \ security management.  These devices are not\n   instrumented to be aware of\
    \ energy consumption.  There are very few\n   means specified in IETF documents\
    \ for energy management, which\n   includes the areas of power monitoring, energy\
    \ monitoring, and power\n   state control.\n   A particular difference between\
    \ energy management and other\n   management tasks is that in some cases energy\
    \ consumption of a device\n   is not measured at the device itself but reported\
    \ by a different\n   place.  For example, at a Power over Ethernet (PoE) sourcing\
    \ device\n   or at a smart power strip, where one device is effectively metering\n\
    \   another remote device.  This requires a clear definition of the\n   relationship\
    \ between the reporting devices and identification of\n   remote devices for which\
    \ monitoring information is provided.  Similar\n   considerations will apply to\
    \ power state control of remote devices,\n   for example, at a PoE sourcing device\
    \ that switches on and off power\n   at its ports.  Another example scenario for\
    \ energy management is a\n   gateway to low resourced and lossy network devices\
    \ in wireless a\n   building network.  Here the energy management system talks\
    \ directly\n   to the gateway but not necessarily to other devices in the building\n\
    \   network.\n   At the time of this writing, the EMAN working group is working\
    \ on the\n   management of energy-aware devices, covered by the following items:\n\
    \   o  The requirements for energy management, specifying energy\n      management\
    \ properties that will allow networks and devices to\n      become energy aware.\
    \  In addition to energy awareness\n      requirements, the need for control functions\
    \ will be discussed.\n      Specifically, the need to monitor and control properties\
    \ of\n      devices that are remote to the reporting device should be\n      discussed.\n\
    \   o  The energy management framework, which will describe extensions to\n  \
    \    the current management framework, required for energy management.\n     \
    \ This includes: power and energy monitoring, power states, power\n      state\
    \ control, and potential power state transitions.  The\n      framework will focus\
    \ on energy management for IP-based network\n      equipment (routers, switches,\
    \ PCs, IP cameras, phones and the\n      like).  Particularly, the relationships\
    \ between reporting devices,\n      remote devices, and monitoring probes (such\
    \ as might be used in\n      low-power and lossy networks) need to be elaborated.\
    \  For the case\n      of a device reporting on behalf of other devices and controlling\n\
    \      those devices, the framework will address the issues of discovery\n   \
    \   and identification of remote devices.\n   o  The Energy-aware Networks and\
    \ Devices MIB document, for monitoring\n      energy-aware networks and devices,\
    \ will address devices\n      identification, context information, and potential\
    \ relationship\n      between reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring\
    \ probes.\n   o  The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB document will document\n\
    \      defining managed objects for the monitoring of power states and\n     \
    \ energy consumption/production.  The monitoring of power states\n      includes\
    \ the following: retrieving power states, properties of\n      power states, current\
    \ power state, power state transitions, and\n      power state statistics.  The\
    \ managed objects will provide means of\n      reporting detailed properties of\
    \ the actual energy rate (power)\n      and of accumulated energy.  Further, they\
    \ will provide information\n      on electrical power quality.\n   o  The Battery\
    \ MIB document will define managed objects for battery\n      monitoring, which\
    \ will provide means of reporting detailed\n      properties of the actual charge,\
    \ age, and state of a battery and\n      of battery statistics.\n   o  The applicability\
    \ statement will describe the variety of\n      applications that can use the\
    \ energy framework and associated MIB\n      modules.  Potential examples are\
    \ building networks, home energy\n      gateway, etc.  Finally, the document will\
    \ also discuss\n      relationships of the framework to other architectures and\n\
    \      frameworks (such as Smart Grid).  The applicability statement will\n  \
    \    explain the relationship between the work in this WG and other\n      existing\
    \ standards, e.g., from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, etc.  Note\n      that the EMAN WG\
    \ will be looking into existing standards such as\n      those from the IEC, ANSI,\
    \ DMTF and others, and reuse existing work\n      as much as possible.\n   The\
    \ documents of the EMAN working group can be found at [EMAN-WG].\n"
