- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP), see [RFC2205],\
    \ has been\n   extended to support the control of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label\n\
    \   Switched Paths (LSPs) for both Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   and\
    \ Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) in, respectively, [RFC3209] and\n   [RFC3473].  In\
    \ all cases, a PathErr message is used to report errors\n   to nodes upstream\
    \ of the error-detecting node.  As defined in\n   [RFC2205] and left unmodified\
    \ by [RFC3209], PathErr messages \"do not\n   change path state in the nodes through\
    \ which they pass\".\n   Notwithstanding this definition, PathErr messages are\
    \ most commonly\n   used to report errors during LSP establishment, i.e., the\
    \ RSVP-TE\n   processing that occurs prior to the ingress receiving a Resv message.\n\
    \   (See [RFC5711] for a broader discussion on PathErr message handling.)\n  \
    \ Support for such usage was enhanced via the introduction of the\n   Path_State_Removed\
    \ flag in [RFC3473], which enables a processing node\n   to free related LSP state\
    \ and resources.  The usage of PathErr\n   messages during LSP establishment was\
    \ further covered in [RFC4920],\n   which describes in detail how a node may indicate\
    \ that it or one of\n   its associated resources should be avoided, i.e., routed\
    \ around,\n   during LSP establishment.\n   PathErr messages can also be used\
    \ to support a number of other cases\n   that can occur after an LSP is established.\
    \  This document focuses on\n   the cases where PathErr messages can be used for\
    \ a node to indicate\n   that it desires an upstream node to reroute an LSP around\
    \ the\n   indicating node or resources associated with the indicating node.\n\
    \   Some examples of such cases are soft-preemption and graceful shutdown\n  \
    \ (see [RFC5712] and [GRACEFUL]).\n   This document uses the terminology \"reroute\
    \ request\" to refer to the\n   indication by a node that an upstream reroute\
    \ should take place.\n   This document describes how a node can initiate a reroute\
    \ request\n   without disrupting LSP data traffic or, when so desired, with the\n\
    \   disruption of data traffic and removal of LSP-associated state and\n   resources.\
    \  The applicability of this document is limited to point-\n   to-point LSPs.\
    \  Support for point-to-multipoint LSPs are for further\n   study.\n   The mechanisms\
    \ used to indicate reroute requests are derived from the\n   mechanisms described\
    \ in [RFC4920] and the error codes defined in\n   [RFC4736].  This document describes\
    \ (1) how a non-disruptive reroute\n   request may be issued and, (2) based on\
    \ an optional \"timeout\" period,\n   how rerouting may be forced by removing\
    \ LSP state and associated\n   resources and signaling such removal.  While this\
    \ document describes\n   how existing protocol definitions can be used to support\
    \ rerouting,\n   it also defines a new reroute-specific error code to allow for\
    \ the\n   future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.\n"

- title: 2.  Reroute Requests
  contents:
  - "2.  Reroute Requests\n   This section describes how a downstream node can indicate\
    \ that it\n   desires a node upstream (along the LSP path) to initiate the\n \
    \  rerouting of an LSP, and how the upstream nodes can respond to such a\n   request.\
    \  Initiating nodes, transit nodes, and ingress nodes are\n   described separately.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Processing at Requesting Node
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Processing at Requesting Node\n   When a transit or egress node desires\
    \ to request the rerouting of an\n   established LSP, it first determines if it\
    \ can act on the reroute\n   request locally.  Such a check MUST be performed\
    \ on the condition\n   that the Explicit Route Object (ERO), see [RFC3209], received\
    \ in the\n   LSP's incoming Path message does not preclude LSP rerouting.\n  \
    \ Examples of requests that may trigger reroutes are avoiding an\n   outgoing\
    \ interface, a component, label resource, or a next hop not\n   explicitly listed\
    \ in the ERO.  In all cases, the actual repair action\n   SHOULD be performed\
    \ after verification that the local policy allows\n   local repair for that LSP/state.\
    \  That is, any traffic-rerouting\n   action (associated to this state) must be\
    \ initiated and completed\n   only as allowed by local node policy.\n   When the\
    \ node cannot act locally, it MUST issue a PathErr message\n   indicating its\
    \ inability to perform local rerouting.  The PathErr\n   message MUST contain\
    \ an ERROR_SPEC object of the format defined in\n   [RFC2205] or [RFC3473].  Such\
    \ a message MUST include one of the\n   following combinations of error codes\
    \ and error values:\n      1. \"Notify/Local node maintenance required\" to support\
    \ backwards\n         compatibility and to reroute around the local node.\n  \
    \    2. \"Notify/Local link maintenance required\" to support backwards\n    \
    \     compatibility and to reroute around a local interface.\n      3. \"Reroute/<any\
    \ Reroute error value>\" for future compatibility\n         and when backwards\
    \ compatibility is not a concern.\n   The rest of the ERROR_SPEC object is constructed\
    \ based on the local\n   rerouting decision and the resource that is to be avoided\
    \ by an\n   upstream node.  It is important to note that the address and TLVs\n\
    \   carried by the ERROR_SPEC object identify the resource to be avoided\n   and\
    \ not the error code and value.\n   When the reroute decision redirects traffic\
    \ around the local node,\n   the local node MUST be indicated in the ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object.\n   Otherwise, i.e., when the reroute decision does not redirect traffic\n\
    \   around the local node, the impacted interface MUST be indicated in\n   the\
    \ ERROR_SPEC object and the IF_ID [RFC3473] ERROR_SPEC object\n   formats SHOULD\
    \ be used to indicate the impacted interface.\n   The IF_ID [RFC3473] ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object format MUST be used to indicate\n   a reroute request that is more specific\
    \ than an interface.  The TLVs\n   defined in [RFC3471], as updated by [RFC3477],\
    \ [RFC4201], and\n   [RFC4920] MAY be used to provide specific, additional reroute\
    \ request\n   information, e.g., reroute around a specific label.  The principles\n\
    \   related to ERROR_SPEC object construction, defined in Section 6.3.1\n   of\
    \ [RFC4920], SHOULD be followed.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Reroute Request Timeouts
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Reroute Request Timeouts\n   Reroute request timeouts are used to remove\
    \ an LSP when there is no\n   response to a reroute request.  A reroute request\
    \ timeout is used\n   when an LSP is to be removed at the expiration of the reroute\
    \ request\n   timeout period.  When such LSP removal is desired, and after\n \
    \  initiating a reroute request, the initiating node MUST initiate a\n   timeout\
    \ during which it expects to receive a response to the reroute\n   request.  Valid\
    \ responses are a PathTear message or a trigger Path\n   message with an ERO,\
    \ avoiding the resource that was indicated in the\n   reroute request.  If either\
    \ type of message is received, the timeout\n   period MUST be canceled and no\
    \ further action is needed.  Note,\n   normal refresh processing is not modified\
    \ by the introduction of\n   reroute request timeouts.  Such processing may result\
    \ in Path state\n   being removed during the timeout period, in which case the\
    \ timeout\n   period MUST also be canceled.\n   If the reroute request timeout\
    \ is reached, the initiating node MUST\n   remove the LSP and its associated state\
    \ and resources.  Removal of\n   LSP state is indicated downstream via a corresponding\
    \ PathTear\n   message.  Removal is indicated upstream via a PathErr message with\n\
    \   the error code of \"Service preempted\".  The Path_State_Removed flag\n  \
    \ MUST be set if supported.  When the Path_State_Removed flag is not\n   supported,\
    \ a corresponding ResvTear MUST also be sent.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Processing at Upstream Node
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Processing at Upstream Node\n   When a transit node's policy permits it\
    \ to support reroute request\n   processing and local repair, the node MUST examine\
    \ incoming PathErr\n   messages to see it the node can perform a requested reroute.\
    \  A\n   reroute request is indicated in a received PathErr message, which\n \
    \  carries one of the error code and value combinations listed above in\n   Section\
    \ 2.1.  Note that a conformant implementation MUST check for\n   any of the three\
    \ combinations listed in Section 2.1.\n   A transit node MAY act on a reroute\
    \ request locally when the ERO\n   received in the LSP's incoming Path message\
    \ does not preclude the\n   reroute.  As before, examples include loosely routed\
    \ LSP next hops.\n   When the reroute request can be processed locally, standard,\
    \ local\n   repair processing MUST be followed.  The node SHOULD limit the number\n\
    \   of local repair attempts.  Again, the expected norm is for local\n   repair,\
    \ and thereby this case, to be precluded due to policy.\n   When the transit node\
    \ supports [RFC4920] and is a boundary node, and\n   Boundary rerouting is allowed,\
    \ it SHOULD use a route request as a\n   trigger to reroute the LSP.  (Per [RFC4920],\
    \ the Flags field of the\n   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object of the initial Path message\
    \ indicates \"Boundary\n   rerouting\".)  In the case the node triggers rerouting,\
    \ it first MUST\n   identify an alternate path within the domain.  When such a\
    \ path is\n   available, the node MUST terminate the PathErr message and issue\
    \ a\n   Path message reflecting the identified alternate path.  Processing\n \
    \  then continues per [RFC4920].  When an alternate path is not\n   available,\
    \ the node cannot act on the reroute request.\n   When a transit node cannot act\
    \ on a reroute request locally, per\n   standard processing, it MUST propagate\
    \ the received PathErr message\n   to the previous hop.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Processing at Ingress
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Processing at Ingress\n   When reroute processing is supported, an ingress\
    \ node MUST check\n   received PathErr messages to identify them as indicating\
    \ reroute\n   requests.  A reroute request is indicated in a received PathErr\n\
    \   message, which carries one of the error code and value combinations\n   listed\
    \ above in Section 2.1.  Note that a conformant implementation\n   MUST check\
    \ for any of the three combinations listed in Section 2.1.\n   Upon receiving\
    \ a reroute request, the ingress MUST attempt to\n   identify an alternate path,\
    \ avoiding the node, interface, resource,\n   etc. identified within the ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object.  When an alternate path\n   cannot be identified, the reroute request\
    \ MUST be discarded.  When an\n   alternate path is identified, a corresponding\
    \ make-before-break LSP\n   SHOULD be initiated and standard make-before-break\
    \ procedures MUST be\n   followed.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Example Reroute Requests\n   This section provides example reroute requests.\
    \  This section is\n   informative rather than prescriptive.  Reroute requests\
    \ are always\n   sent via PathErr messages.  As described above, a PathErr message\
    \ may\n   contain either an [RFC2205] format ERROR_SPEC object, or an IF_ID\n\
    \   [RFC3473] format ERROR_SPEC object; it is the address and TLVs\n   carried\
    \ by the ERROR_SPEC object, and not the error value, that\n   indicates the resource\
