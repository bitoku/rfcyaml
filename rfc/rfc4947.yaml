  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the process of binding/associating\
    \ IPv4/IPv6\n   addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS).  This procedure\
    \ is\n   known as Address Resolution (AR), or Neighbor Discovery (ND).  Such\n\
    \   address resolution complements the higher layer resource discovery\n   tools\
    \ that are used to advertise IP sessions.  The document reviews\n   current methods\
    \ appropriate to a range of technologies (DVB, ATSC,\n   DOCSIS, and variants).\
    \  It also describes the interaction with well-\n   known protocols for address\
    \ management including DHCP, ARP, and the\n   ND protocol.\n   The MPEG-2 TS provides\
    \ a time-division multiplexed (TDM) stream that\n   may contain audio, video,\
    \ and data information, including\n   encapsulated IP Datagrams [RFC4259], defined\
    \ in specification ISO/IEC\n   138181 [ISO-MPEG2].  Each Layer 2 (L2) frame, known\
    \ as a TS Packet,\n   contains a 4 byte header and a 184 byte payload.  Each TS\
    \ Packet is\n   associated with a single TS Logical Channel, identified by a 13-bit\n\
    \   Packet ID (PID) value that is carried in the MPEG-2 TS Packet header.\n  \
    \ The MPEG-2 standard also defines a control plane that may be used to\n   transmit\
    \ control information to Receivers in the form of System\n   Information (SI)\
    \ Tables [ETSI-SI], [ETSI-SI1], or Program Specific\n   Information (PSI) Tables.\n\
    \   To utilize the MPEG-2 TS as a L2 link supporting IP, a sender must\n   associate\
    \ an IP address with a particular Transmission Multiplex, and\n   within the multiplex,\
    \ identify the specific PID to be used.  This\n   document calls this mapping\
    \ an AR function.  In some AR schemes, the\n   MPEG-2 TS address space is subdivided\
    \ into logical contexts known as\n   Platforms [ETSI-DAT].  Each Platform associates\
    \ an IP service\n   provider with a separate context that shares a common MPEG-2\
    \ TS\n   (i.e., uses the same PID value).\n   MPEG-2 Receivers may use a Network\
    \ Point of Attachment (NPA)\n   [RFC4259] to uniquely identify a L2 node within\
    \ an MPEG-2\n   transmission network.  An example of an NPA is the IEEE Medium\
    \ Access\n   Control (MAC) address.  Where such addresses are used, these must\n\
    \   also be signalled by the AR procedure.  Finally, address resolution\n   could\
    \ signal the format of the data being transmitted, for example,\n   the encapsulation,\
    \ with any L2 encryption method and any compression\n   scheme [RFC4259].\n  \
    \ The numbers of Receivers connected via a single MPEG-2 link may be\n   much\
    \ larger than found in other common LAN technologies (e.g.,\n   Ethernet).  This\
    \ has implications on design/configuration of the\n   address resolution mechanisms.\
    \  Current routing protocols and some\n   multicast application protocols also\
    \ do not scale to arbitrarily\n   large numbers of participants.  Such networks\
    \ do not by themselves\n   introduce an appreciable subnetwork round trip delay,\
    \ however many\n   practical MPEG-2 transmission networks are built using links\
    \ that may\n   introduce a significant path delay (satellite links, use of dial-up\n\
    \   modem return, cellular return, etc.).  This higher delay may need to\n   be\
    \ accommodated by address resolution protocols that use this\n   service.\n"

    \         Figure 1: A routed MPEG-2 link\n   Figure 1 shows a routed MPEG-2 link\
    \ feeding three downstream routers\n   (R2-R4).  AR takes place at the Encapsulator\
    \ (R1) to identify each\n   Receiver at Layer 2 within the IP subnetwork (R2,\
    \ etc.).\n   When considering unicast communication from R1 to R2, several L2\n\
    \   addresses are involved:\n   1a is the L2 (sending) interface address of R1\
    \ on the MPEG-2 link.\n   2b is the L2 (receiving) interface address of R2 on\
    \ the MPEG-2 link.\n   2a is the L2 (sending) interface address of R2 on the next\
    \ hop link.\n   AR for the MPEG-2 link allows R1 to determine the L2 address (2b)\n\
    \   corresponding to the next hop Receiver, router R2.\n   Figure 2 shows a bridged\
    \ MPEG-2 link feeding three downstream bridges\n   (B2-B4).  AR takes place at\
    \ the Encapsulator (B1) to identify each\n   Receiver at L2 (B2-B4).  AR also\
    \ takes place across the IP subnetwork\n   allowing the Feed router (R1) to identify\
    \ the downstream Routers at\n   Layer 2 (R2, etc.).  The Encapsulator associates\
    \ a destination\n   MAC/NPA address with each bridged PDU sent on an MPEG-2 link.\
    \  Two\n   methods are defined by ULE (Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation)\n\
    \   [RFC4326]:\n   The simplest method uses the L2 address of the transmitted\
    \ frame.\n   This is the MAC address corresponding to the destination within the\n\
    \   L2 subnetwork (the next hop router, 2b of R2).  This requires each\n   Receiver\
    \ (B2-B4) to associate the receiving MPEG-2 interface with the\n   set of MAC\
    \ addresses that exist on the L2 subnetworks that it feeds.\n   Similar considerations\
    \ apply when IP-based tunnels support L2\n   services (including the use of UDLR\
    \ (Unidirectional Links)\n   [RFC3077]).\n   It is also possible for a bridging\
    \ Encapsulator (B1) to encapsulate a\n   PDU with a link-specific header that\
    \ also contains the MAC/NPA\n   address associated with a Receiver L2 interface\
    \ on the MPEG-2 link\n   (Figure 2).  In this case, the destination MAC/NPA address\
    \ of the\n   encapsulated frame is set to the Receiver MAC/NPA address (y), rather\n\
    \   than the address of the final L2 destination.  At a different level,\n   an\
    \ AR binding is also required for R1 to associate the destination L2\n   address\
    \ 2b with R2.  In a subnetwork using bridging, the systems R1\n   and R2 will\
    \ normally use standard IETF-defined AR mechanisms (e.g.,\n   IPv4 Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP) [RFC826] and the IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery Protocol (ND) [RFC2461])\
    \ edge-to-edge across the IP\n   subnetwork.\n                               \

  - "3.  Address Resolution Requirements\n   The MPEG IP address resolution process\
    \ is independent of the choice\n   of encapsulation and needs to support a set\
    \ of IP over MPEG-2\n   encapsulation formats, including Multi-Protocol Encapsulation\
    \ (MPE)\n   ([ETSI-DAT], [ATSC-A90]) and the IETF-defined Unidirectional\n   Lightweight\
    \ Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326].\n   The general IP over MPEG-2 AR requirements\
    \ are summarized below:\n      - A scalable architecture that may support large\
    \ numbers of\n        systems within the MPEG-2 Network [RFC4259].\n      - A\
    \ protocol version, to indicate the specific AR protocol in use\n        and which\
    \ may include the supported encapsulation method.\n      - A method (e.g., well-known\
    \ L2/L3 address/addresses) to identify\n        the AR Server sourcing the AR\
    \ information.\n      - A method to represent IPv4/IPv6 AR information (including\n\
    \        security mechanisms to authenticate the AR information to\n        protect\
    \ against address masquerading [RFC3756]).\n      - A method to install AR information\
    \ associated with clients at\n        the AR Server (registration).\n      - A\
    \ method for transmission of AR information from an AR Server to\n        clients\

    \ to subnet broadcast).\n      - Incremental update of the AR information held\
    \ by clients.\n      - Procedures for purging clients of stale AR information.\n\
    \   An MPEG-2 transmission network may support multiple IP networks.  If\n   this\
    \ is the case, it is important to recognize the scope within which\n   an address\
    \ is resolved to prevent packets from one addressed scope\n   leaking into other\
    \ scopes [RFC4259].  Examples of overlapping IP\n   address assignments include:\n\
    \      (i)   Private unicast addresses (e.g., in IPv4, 10/8 prefix;\n        \
    \    172.16/12 prefix; and 192.168/16 prefix).  Packets with\n            these\
    \ addresses should be confined to one addressed area.\n            IPv6 also defines\
    \ link-local addresses that must not be\n            forwarded beyond the link\
    \ on which they were first sent.\n      (ii)  Local scope multicast addresses.\
    \  These are only valid\n            within the local area (examples for IPv4\
    \ include:\n            224.0.0/24; 224.0.1/24).  Similar cases exist for some\
    \ IPv6\n            multicast addresses [RFC2375].\n      (iii) Scoped multicast\
    \ addresses [RFC2365] and [RFC2375].\n            Forwarding of these addresses\
    \ is controlled by the scope\n            associated with the address.  The addresses\
    \ are only valid\n            within an addressed area (e.g., the 239/8 [RFC2365]).\n\
    \   Overlapping address assignments may also occur at L2, where the same\n   MAC/NPA\
    \ address is used to identify multiple Receivers [RFC4259]:\n      (i)   An MAC/NPA\
    \ unicast address must be unique within the\n            addressed area.  The\
    \ IEEE-assigned MAC addresses used in\n            Ethernet LANs are globally\
    \ unique.  If the addresses are not\n            globally unique, an address must\
    \ only be re-used by\n            Receivers in different addressed (scoped) areas.\n\
    \      (ii)  The MAC/NPA address broadcast address (a L2 address of all\n    \
    \        ones).  Traffic with this address should be confined to one\n       \
    \     addressed area.\n      (iii) IP and other protocols may view sets of L3\
    \ multicast\n            addresses as link-local.  This may produce unexpected\n\
    \            results if frames with the corresponding multicast L2\n         \
    \   addresses are distributed to systems in a different L3\n            network\
    \ or multicast scope (Sections 3.2 and 5.6).\n   Reception of unicast packets\
    \ destined for another addressed area will\n   lead to an increase in the rate\
    \ of received packets by systems\n   connected via the network.  Reception of\
    \ the additional network\n   traffic may contribute to processing load, but should\
    \ not lead to\n   unexpected protocol behaviour, providing that systems can be\
    \ uniquely\n   addressed at L2.  It does however introduce a potential Denial\
    \ of\n   Service (DoS) opportunity.  When the Receiver operates as an IP\n   router,\
    \ the receipt of such a packet can lead to unexpected protocol\n   behaviour.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Unicast Support
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Unicast Support\n   Unicast address resolution is required at two levels.\n\
    \   At the lower level, the IP (or MAC) address needs to be associated\n   with\
    \ a specific TS Logical Channel (PID value) and the corresponding\n   TS Multiplex\
    \ (Section 4).  Each Encapsulator within an MPEG-2 Network\n   is associated with\
    \ a set of unique TS Logical Channels (PID values)\n   that it sources [ETSI-DAT,\
    \ RFC4259].  Within a specific scope, the\n   same unicast IP address may therefore\
    \ be associated with more than\n   one Stream, and each Stream contributes different\
    \ content (e.g., when\n   several different IP Encapsulators contribute IP flows\
    \ destined to\n   the same Receiver).  MPEG-2 Networks may also replicate IP packets\
    \ to\n   send the same content (Simulcast) to different Receivers or via\n   different\
    \ TS Multiplexes.  The configuration of the MPEG-2 Network\n   must prevent a\
    \ Receiver accepting duplicated copies of the same IP\n   packet.\n   At the upper\
    \ level, the AR procedure needs to associate an IP address\n   with a specific\
    \ MAC/NPA address (Section 5).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Multicast Support
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Multicast Support\n   Multicast is an important application for MPEG-2\
    \ transmission\n   networks, since it exploits the advantages of native support\
    \ for link\n   broadcast.  Multicast address resolution occurs at the network-level\n\
    \   in associating a specific L2 address with an IP Group Destination\n   Address\
    \ (Section 5.6).  In IPv4 and IPv6 over Ethernet, this\n   association is normally\
    \ a direct mapping, and this is the default\n   method also specified in both\
    \ ULE [RFC4326] and MPE [ETSI-DAT].\n   Address resolution must also occur at\
    \ the MPEG-2 level (Section 4).\n   The goal of this multicast address resolution\
    \ is to allow a Receiver\n   to associate an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address with\
    \ a specific TS\n   Logical Channel and the corresponding TS Multiplex [RFC4259].\
    \  This\n   association needs to permit a large number of active multicast\n \
    \  groups, and should minimize the processing load at the Receiver when\n   filtering\
    \ and forwarding IP multicast packets (e.g., by distributing\n   the multicast\
    \ traffic over a number of TS Logical Channels).  Schemes\n   that allow hardware\
    \ filtering can be beneficial, since these may\n   relieve the drivers and operating\
    \ systems from discarding unwanted\n   multicast traffic.\n   There are two specific\
    \ functions required for address resolution in\n   IP multicast over MPEG-2 Networks:\n\
    \   (i)  Mapping IP multicast groups to the underlying MPEG-2 TS Logical\n   \
    \     Channel (PID) and the MPEG-2 TS Multiplex at the Encapsulator.\n   (ii)\
    \ Provide signalling information to allow a Receiver to locate an\n        IP\
    \ multicast flow within an MPEG-2 TS Multiplex.\n   Methods are required to identify\
    \ the scope of an address when an\n   MPEG-2 Network supports several logical\
    \ IP networks and carries\n   groups within different multicast scopes [RFC4259].\n\
    \   Appropriate procedures need to specify the correct action when the\n   same\
    \ multicast group is available on separate TS Logical Channels.\n   This could\
    \ arise when different Encapsulators contribute IP packets\n   with the same IP\
    \ Group Destination Address in the ASM (Any-Source\n   Multicast) address range.\
    \  Another case arises when a Receiver could\n   receive more than one copy of\
    \ the same packet (e.g., when packets are\n   replicated across different TS Logical\
    \ Channels or even different TS\n   Multiplexes, a method known as Simulcasting\
    \ [ETSI-DAT]).  At the IP\n   level, the host/router may be unaware of this duplication\
    \ and this\n   needs to be detected by other means.\n   When the MPEG-2 Network\
    \ is peered to the multicast-enabled Internet,\n   an arbitrarily large number\
    \ of IP multicast group destination\n   addresses may be in use, and the set forwarded\
    \ on the transmission\n   network may be expected to vary significantly with time.\
    \  Some uses\n   of IP multicast employ a range of addresses to support a single\n\
    \   application (e.g., ND [RFC2461], Layered Coding Transport (LCT)\n   [RFC3451],\
    \ and Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC)\n   [RFC3738]).  The current\
    \ set of active addresses may be determined\n   dynamically via a multicast group\
    \ membership protocol (e.g., Internet\n   Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376]\
    \ and Multicast Listener\n   Discovery (MLD) [RFC3810]), via multicast routing\
    \ (e.g., Protocol\n   Independent Multicast (PIM) [RFC4601]) and/or other means\
    \ (e.g.,\n   [RFC3819] and [RFC4605]), however each active address requires a\n\
    \   binding by the AR method.  Therefore, there are advantages in using a\n  \
    \ method that does not need to explicitly advertise an AR binding for\n   each\
    \ IP traffic flow, but is able to distribute traffic across a\n   number of L2\
    \ TS Logical Channels (e.g., using a hash/mapping that\n   resembles the mapping\
    \ from IP addresses to MAC addresses [RFC1112,\n   RFC2464]).  Such methods can\
    \ reduce the volume of AR information that\n   needs to be distributed, and reduce\
    \ the AR processing.\n   Section 5.6 describes the binding of IP multicast addresses\
    \ to\n   MAC/NPA addresses.\n"
- title: 4.  MPEG-2 Address Resolution
  contents:
  - "4.  MPEG-2 Address Resolution\n   The first part of this section describes the\
    \ role of MPEG-2\n   signalling to identify streams (TS Logical Channels [RFC4259])\
    \ within\n   the L2 infrastructure.\n   At L2, the MPEG-2 Transport Stream [ISO-MPEG2]\
    \ identifies the\n   existence and format of a Stream, using a combination of\
    \ two PSI\n   tables: the Program Association Table (PAT) and entries in the\n\
    \   program element loop of a Program Map Table (PMT).  PMT Tables are\n   sent\
    \ infrequently and are typically small in size.  The PAT is sent\n   using the\
    \ well-known PID value of 0X000.  This table provides the\n   correspondence between\
    \ a program_number and a PID value.  (The\n   program_number is the numeric label\
    \ associated with a program).  Each\n   program in the Table is associated with\
    \ a specific PID value, used to\n   identify a TS Logical Channel (i.e., a TS).\
    \  The identified TS is\n   used to send the PMT, which associates a set of PID\
    \ values with the\n   individual components of the program.  This approach de-references\n\
    \   the PID values when the MPEG-2 Network includes multiplexors or re-\n   multiplexors\
    \ that renumber the PID values of the TS Logical Channels\n   that they process.\n\
    \   In addition to signalling the Receiver with the PID value assigned to\n  \
    \ a Stream, PMT entries indicate the presence of Streams using ULE and\n   MPE\
    \ to the variety of devices that may operate in the MPEG-2\n   transmission network\
    \ (multiplexors, remultiplexors, rate shapers,\n   advertisement insertion equipment,\
    \ etc.).\n   A multiplexor or remultiplexor may change the PID values associated\n\
    \   with a Stream during the multiplexing process, the new value being\n   reflected\
    \ in an updated PMT.  TS Packets that carry a PID value that\n   is not associated\
    \ with a PMT entry (an orphan PID), may, and usually\n   will be dropped by ISO\
    \ 13818-1 compliant L2 equipment, resulting in\n   the Stream not being forwarded\
    \ across the transmission network.  In\n   networks that do not employ any intermediate\
    \ devices (e.g., scenarios\n   C,E,F of [RFC4259]), or where devices have other\
    \ means to determine\n   the set of PID values in use, the PMT table may still\
    \ be sent (but is\n   not required for this purpose).\n   Although the basic PMT\
    \ information may be used to identify the\n   existence of IP traffic, it does\
    \ not associate a Stream with an IP\n   prefix/address.  The remainder of the\
    \ section describes IP addresses\n   resolution mechanisms relating to MPEG-2.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Static Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Static Configuration\n   The static mapping option, where IP addresses\
    \ or flows are statically\n   mapped to specific PIDs is the equivalent to signalling\
    \ \"out-of-\n   band\".  The application programmer, installing engineer, or user\n\
    \   receives the mapping via some outside means, not in the MPEG-2 TS.\n   This\
    \ is useful for testing, experimental networks, small subnetworks\n   and closed\
    \ domains.\n   A pre-defined set of IP addresses may be used within an MPEG-2\n\
    \   transmission network.  Prior knowledge of the active set of addresses\n  \
    \ allows appropriate AR records to be constructed for each address, and\n   to\
    \ pre-assign the corresponding PID value (e.g., selected to optimize\n   Receiver\
    \ processing; to group related addresses to the same PID\n   value; and/or to\
    \ reflect a policy for usage of specific ranges of PID\n   values).  This presumes\
    \ that the PID mappings are not modified during\n   transmission (Section 4).\n\
    \   A single \"well-known\" PID is a specialization of this.  This scheme\n  \
    \ is used by current DOCSIS cable modems [DOCSIS], where all IP traffic\n   is\

- title: 4.2.1.  IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) and Its Usage
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  IP/MAC Notification Table (INT) and Its Usage\n   The INT provides a\
    \ set of descriptors to specify addressing in a DVB\n   network.  The use of this\
    \ method is specified for Multiprotocol\n   Encapsulation (MPE) [ETSI-DAT].  It\
    \ provides a method for carrying\n   information about the location of IP/L2 flows\
    \ within a DVB network.\n   A Platform_ID identifies the addressing scope for\
    \ a set of IP/L2\n   streams and/or Receivers.  A Platform may span several Transport\n\
    \   Streams carried by one or multiple TS Multiplexes and represents a\n   single\
    \ IP network with a harmonized address space (scope).  This\n   allows for the\
    \ coexistence of several independent IP/MAC address\n   scopes within an MPEG-2\
    \ Network.\n   The INT allows both fully-specified IP addresses and prefix matching\n\
    \   to reduce the size of the table (and hence enhance signalling\n   efficiency).\
    \  An IPv4/IPv6 \"subnet mask\" may be specified in full\n   form or by using\
    \ a slash notation (e.g., /127).  IP multicast\n   addresses can be specified\
    \ with or without a source (address or\n   range), although if a source address\
    \ is specified, then only the\n   slash notation may be used for prefixes.\n \
    \  In addition, for identification and security descriptors, the\n   following\
    \ descriptors are defined for address binding in INT tables:\n   (i)   target_MAC_address_descriptor:\
    \ A descriptor to describe a\n         single or set of MAC addresses (and their\
    \ mask).\n   (ii)  target_MAC_address_range_descriptor: A descriptor that may\
    \ be\n         used to set filters.\n   (iii) target_IP_address_descriptor: A\
    \ descriptor describing a single\n         or set of IPv4 unicast or multicast\
    \ addresses (and their mask).\n   (iv)  target_IP_slash_descriptor:  Allows definition\
    \ and announcement\n         of an IPv4 prefix.\n   (v)   target_IP_source_slash_descriptor:\
    \ Uses source and destination\n         addresses to target a single or set of\
    \ systems.\n   (vi)  IP/MAC stream_location_descriptor: A descriptor that locates\
    \ an\n         IP/MAC stream in a DVB network.\n   The following descriptors provide\
    \ corresponding functions for IPv6\n   addresses:\n        target_IPv6_address_descriptor\n\
    \        target_IPv6_slash_descriptor\n        and target_IPv6_source_slash_descriptor\n\
    \   The ISP_access_mode_descriptor allows specification of a second\n   address\
    \ descriptor to access an ISP via an alternative non-DVB\n   (possibly non-IP)\
    \ network.\n   One key benefit is that the approach employs MPEG-2 signalling\n\
    \   (Section 4) and is integrated with other signalling information.\n   This\
    \ allows the INT to operate in the presence of (re)multiplexors\n   [RFC4259]\
    \ and to refer to PID values that are carried in different TS\n   Multiplexes.\
    \  This makes it well-suited to a Broadcast TV Scenario\n   [RFC4259].\n   The\
    \ principal drawback is a need for an Encapsulator to introduce\n   associated\
    \ PSI/SI MPEG-2 control information.  This control\n   information needs to be\

- title: 4.3.  IP-Based Address Resolution for TS Logical Channels
  contents:
  - "4.3.  IP-Based Address Resolution for TS Logical Channels\n   As MPEG-2 Networks\
    \ evolve to become multi-service networks, the use\n   of IP protocols is becoming\
    \ more prevalent.  Most MPEG-2 Networks now\n   use some IP protocols for operations\
    \ and control and data delivery.\n   Address resolution information could also\
    \ be sent using IP transport.\n   At the time of writing there is no standards-based\
    \ IP-level AR\n   protocol that supports the MPEG-2 TS.\n   There is an opportunity\
    \ to define an IP-level method that could use\n   an IP multicast protocol over\
    \ a well-known IP multicast address to\n   resolve an IP address to a TS Logical\
    \ Channel (i.e., a Transport\n   Stream).  The advantages of using an IP-based\
    \ address resolution\n   include:\n   (i)   Simplicity:\n         The AR mechanism\
    \ does not require interpretation of L2 tables;\n         this is an advantage\
    \ especially in the growing market share for\n         home network and audio/video\
    \ networked entities.\n   (ii)  Uniformity:\n         An IP-based protocol can\
    \ provide a common method across\n         different network scenarios for both\
    \ IP to MAC address mappings\n         and mapping to TS Logical Channels (PID\
    \ value associated with a\n         Stream).\n   (iii) Extensibility:\n      \
    \   IP-based AR mechanisms allow an independent evolution of the AR\n        \
    \ protocol.  This includes dynamic methods to request address\n         resolution\
    \ and the ability to include other L2 information\n         (e.g., encryption\
    \ keys).\n   (iv)  Integration:\n         The information exchanged by IP-based\
    \ AR protocols can easily\n         be integrated as a part of the IP network\
    \ layer, simplifying\n         support for AAA, policy, Operations and Management\
    \ (OAM),\n         mobility, configuration control, etc., that combine AR with\n\
    \         security.\n   The drawbacks of an IP-based method include:\n   (i) \
    \  It can not operate over an MPEG-2 Network that uses MPEG-2\n         remultiplexors\
    \ [RFC4259] that modify the PID values associated\n         with the TS Logical\
    \ Channels during the multiplexing operation\n         (Section 4).  This makes\
    \ the method unsuitable for use in\n         deployed broadcast TV networks [RFC4259].\n\
    \   (ii)  IP-based methods can introduce concerns about the integrity of\n   \
    \      the information and authentication of the sender [RFC4259].\n         (These\
    \ concerns are also applicable to MPEG-2 Table methods,\n         but in this\
    \ case the information is confined to the L2 network,\n         or parts of the\
    \ network where gateway devices isolate the\n         MPEG-2 devices from the\
    \ larger Internet creating virtual MPEG-2\n         private networks.) IP-based\
    \ solutions should therefore\n         implement security mechanisms that may\
    \ be used to authenticate\n         the sender and verify the integrity of the\
    \ AR information as a\n         part of a larger security framework.\n   An IP-level\
    \ method could use an IP multicast protocol running an AR\n   Server (see also\
    \ Section 5.4) over a well-known (or discovered) IP\n   multicast address.  To\
    \ satisfy the requirement for scalability to\n   networks with a large number\
    \ of systems (Section 1), a single packet\n   needs to transport multiple AR records\
    \ and define the intended scope\n   for each address.  Methods that employ prefix\
    \ matching are desirable\n   (e.g., where a range of source/destination addresses\
    \ are matched to a\n   single entry).  It can also be beneficial to use methods\
    \ that permit\n   a range of IP addresses to be mapped to a set of TS Logical\
    \ Channels\n   (e.g., a hashing technique similar to the mapping of IP Group\n\
    \   Destination Addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses [RFC1112] [RFC2464]).\n"
- title: 5.  Mapping IP Addresses to MAC/NPA Addresses
  contents:
  - "5.  Mapping IP Addresses to MAC/NPA Addresses\n   This section reviews IETF protocols\
    \ that may be used to assign and\n   manage the mapping of IP addresses to/from\
    \ MAC/NPA addresses over\n   MPEG-2 Networks.\n   An IP Encapsulator requires\
    \ AR information to select an appropriate\n   MAC/NPA address in the SNDU header\
    \ [RFC4259] (Section 6).  The\n   information to complete this header may be taken\
    \ directly from a\n   neighbor/ARP cache, or may require the Encapsulator to retrieve\
    \ the\n   information using an AR protocol.  The way in which this information\n\
    \   is collected will depend upon whether the Encapsulator functions as a\n  \
    \ Router (at L3) or a Bridge (at L2) (Section 1.1).\n   Two IETF-defined protocols\
    \ for mapping IP addresses to MAC/NPA\n   addresses are the Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol, ARP [RFC826], and the\n   Neighbor Discovery protocol, ND [RFC2461],\
    \ respectively for IPv4 and\n   IPv6.  Both protocols are normally used in a bidirectional\
    \ mode,\n   although both also permit unsolicited transmission of mappings.  The\n\
    \   IPv6 mapping defined in [RFC2464] can result in a large number of\n   active\
    \ MAC multicast addresses (e.g., one for each end host).\n   ARP requires support\
    \ for L2 broadcast packets.  A large number of\n   Receivers can lead to a proportional\
    \ increase in ARP traffic, a\n   concern for bandwidth-limited networks.  Transmission\
    \ delay can also\n   impact protocol performance.\n   ARP also has a number of\
    \ security vulnerabilities.  ARP spoofing is\n   where a system can be fooled\
    \ by a rogue device that sends a\n   fictitious ARP RESPONSE that includes the\
    \ IP address of a legitimate\n   network system and the MAC of a rogue system.\
    \  This causes legitimate\n   systems on the network to update their ARP tables\
    \ with the false\n   mapping and then send future packets to the rogue system\
    \ instead of\n   the legitimate system.  Using this method, a rogue system can\
    \ see\n   (and modify) packets sent through the network.\n   Secure ARP (SARP)\
    \ uses a secure tunnel (e.g., between each client and\n   a server at a wireless\
    \ access point or router) [RFC4346].  The router\n   ignores any ARP RESPONSEs\
    \ not associated with clients using the\n   secure tunnels.  Therefore, only legitimate\
    \ ARP RESPONSEs are used\n   for updating ARP tables.  SARP requires the installation\
    \ of software\n   at each client.  It suffers from the same scalability issues\
    \ as the\n   standard ARP.\n   The ND protocol uses a set of IP multicast addresses.\
    \  In large\n   networks, many multicast addresses are used, but each client\n\
    \   typically only listens to a restricted set of group destination\n   addresses\
    \ and little traffic is usually sent in each group.\n   Therefore, Layer 2 AR\
    \ for MPEG-2 Networks must support this in a\n   scalable manner.\n   A large\
    \ number of ND messages may cause a large demand for performing\n   asymmetric\
    \ operations.  The base ND protocol limits the rate at which\n   multicast responses\
    \ to solicitations can be sent.  Configurations may\n   need to be tuned when\
    \ operating with large numbers of Receivers.\n   The default parameters specified\
    \ in the ND protocol [RFC2461] can\n   introduce interoperability problems (e.g.,\
    \ a failure to resolve when\n   the link RTT (round-trip time) exceed 3 seconds)\
    \ and performance\n   degradation (duplicate ND messages with a link RTT > 1 second)\
    \ when\n   used in networks where the link RTT is significantly larger than\n\
    \   experienced by Ethernet LANs.  Tuning of the protocol parameters\n   (e.g.,\
    \ RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL) is therefore recommended when using\n   network links\
    \ with appreciable delay (Section 6.3.2 of [RFC2461]).\n   ND has similar security\
    \ vulnerabilities to ARP.  The Secure Neighbor\n   Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971]\
    \ was developed to address known security\n   vulnerabilities in ND [RFC3756].\
    \  It can also reduce the AR traffic\n   compared to ND.  In addition, SEND does\
    \ not require the configuration\n   of per-host keys and can coexist with the\
    \ use of both SEND and\n   insecure ND on the same link.\n   The ND Protocol is\
    \ also used by IPv6 systems to perform other\n   functions beyond address resolution,\
    \ including Router Solicitation /\n   Advertisement, Duplicate Address Detection\
    \ (DAD), Neighbor\n   Unreachability Detection (NUD), and Redirect.  These functions\
    \ are\n   useful for hosts, even when address resolution is not required.\n"

    \   Tunnel Configuration Protocol (DTCP) enables automatic configuration\n   of\

    \ upper layer protocols by providing a L2 tunnelling mechanism\n   that emulates\
    \ a bidirectional broadcast link at L2.  A network using\n   UDLR has a topology\
    \ where a Feed Router and all Receivers form a\n   logical Local Area Network.\
    \  Encapsulating L2 frames allows them to\n   be sent through an Internet Path\
    \ (i.e., bridging).\n   Since many unidirectional links employ wireless technology\
    \ for the\n   forward (Feed) link, there may be an appreciable cost associated\
    \ with\n   forwarding traffic on the Feed link.  Therefore, it is often\n   desirable\
    \ to prevent forwarding unnecessary traffic (e.g., for\n   multicast this implies\
    \ control of which groups are forwarded).  The\n   implications of forwarding\
    \ in the return direction must also be\n   considered (e.g., asymmetric capacity\
    \ and loss [RFC3449]).  This\n   suggests a need to minimize the volume and frequency\
    \ of control\n   messages.\n   Three different AR cases may be identified (each\
    \ considers sending an\n   IP packet to a next-hop IP address that is not currently\
    \ cached by\n   the sender):\n   (i)   A Feed Router needs a Receiver MAC/NPA\
    \ address.\n         This occurs when a Feed Router sends an IP packet using the\n\
    \         Feed UDL to a Receiver whose MAC/NPA address is unknown.  In\n     \
    \    IPv4, the Feed Router sends an ARP REQUEST with the IP address\n        \
    \ of the Receiver.  The Receiver that recognizes its IP address\n         replies\
    \ with an ARP RESPONSE to the MAC/NPA address of the Feed\n         Router (e.g.,\
    \ using a UDLR tunnel).  The Feed Router may then\n         address IP packets\
    \ to the unicast MAC/NPA address associated\n         with the Receiver.  The\
    \ ULE encapsulation format also permits\n         packets to be sent without specifying\
    \ a MAC/NPA address, where\n         this is desirable (Section 6.1 and 6.5).\n\
    \   (ii)  A Receiver needs the Feed Router MAC/NPA address.\n         This occurs\
    \ when a Receiver sends an IP packet to a Feed Router\n         whose MAC/NPA\
    \ address is unknown.  In IPv4, the Receiver sends\n         an ARP REQUEST with\
    \ the IP address of the Feed Router (e.g.,\n         using a UDLR tunnel).  The\
    \ Feed Router replies with an ARP\n         RESPONSE using the Feed UDL.  The\
    \ Receiver may then address IP\n         packets to the MAC/NPA address of the\
    \ recipient.\n   (iii) A Receiver needs another Receiver MAC/NPA address.\n  \
    \       This occurs when a Receiver sends an IP packet to another\n         Receiver\
    \ whose MAC/NPA address is unknown.  In IPv4, the\n         Receiver sends an\
    \ ARP REQUEST with the IP address of the remote\n         Receiver (e.g., using\
    \ a UDLR tunnel to the Feed Router).  The\n         request is forwarded over\
    \ the Feed UDL.  The target Receiver\n         replies with an ARP RESPONSE (e.g.,\
    \ using a UDLR tunnel).  The\n         Feed Router forwards the response on the\
    \ UDL.  The Receiver may\n         then address IP packets to the MAC/NPA address\
    \ of the\n         recipient.\n   These 3 cases allow any system connected to\
    \ the UDL to obtain the\n   MAC/NPA address of any other system.  Similar exchanges\
    \ may be\n   performed using the ND protocol for IPv6.\n   A long round trip delay\
    \ (via the UDL and UDLR tunnel) impacts the\n   performance of the reactive address\
    \ resolution procedures provided by\n   ARP, ND, and SEND.  In contrast to Ethernet,\
    \ during the interval when\n   resolution is taking place, many IP packets may\
    \ be received that are\n   addressed to the AR Target address.  The ARP specification\
    \ allows an\n   interface to discard these packets while awaiting the response\
    \ to the\n   resolution request.  An appropriately sized buffer would however\n\
    \   prevent this loss.\n   In case (iii), the time to complete address resolution\
    \ may be reduced\n   by the use of an AR Server at the Feed (Section 5.4).\n \
    \  Using DHCP requires prior establishment of the L2 connectivity to a\n   DHCP\
    \ Server.  The delay in establishing return connectivity in UDLR\n   networks\
    \ that use DHCP, may make it beneficial to increase the\n   frequency of the DTCP\
    \ HELLO message.  Further information about\n   tuning DHCP is provided in Section\

    \ reduce\n   the time taken for Receivers to discover AR information.\n   The\

    \ may also be sent unsolicited by the AR Server using\n   multicast/broadcast\

    \ requests.  The unsolicited method can\n   improve scaling in large networks.\
    \  Scaling could be further improved\n   by distributing a single broadcast/multicast\

  contents:
  - "5.6.1.  Multicast/Broadcast Addressing for UDLR\n   UDLR is a Layer 2 solution,\

    \ are finally\n   received at the Feed interface of the originating Receiver.\
    \  This\n   multicast forwarding does not include the normal L3 Reverse Path\n\
    \   Forwarding (RPF) check or L2 spanning tree checks, the processing of\n   the\
    \ IP Time To Live (TTL) field or the filtering of administratively\n   scoped\
    \ multicast addresses.  This raises a need to carefully consider\n   multicast\
    \ support.  To avoid forwarding loops, RFC 3077 notes that a\n   Receiver needs\
    \ to be configured with appropriate filter rules to\n   ensure that it discards\
    \ packets that originate from an attached\n   network and are later received over\
    \ the Feed link.\n   When the encapsulation includes an MAC/NPA source address,\
    \ re-\n   broadcast packets may be filtered at the link layer using a filter\n\

    \   both MPE ([ETSI-DAT], [ATSC-A90]) and ULE [RFC4326] encapsulations.\n   [RFC4840]\
    \ describes issues and concerns that may arise when a link\n   can support multiple\
    \ encapsulations.  In particular, it identifies\n   problems that arise when end\
    \ hosts that belong to the same IP network\n   employ different incompatible encapsulation\
    \ methods.  An Encapsulator\n   must therefore use only one method (e.g., ULE\
    \ or MPE) to support a\n   single IP network (i.e., set of IPv4 systems sharing\
    \ the same subnet\n   broadcast address or same IPv6 prefix).  All Receivers in\
    \ an IP\n   network must receive all IP packets that use a broadcast (directed\
    \ to\n   all systems in the IP network) or a local-scope multicast address\n \
    \  (Section 3).  Packets with these addresses are used by many IP-based\n   protocols\
    \ including service discovery, IP AR, and routing protocols.\n   Systems that\
    \ fail to receive these packets can suffer connectivity\n   failure or incorrect\
    \ behaviour (e.g., they may be unable to\n   participate in IP-based discovery,\
    \ configuration, routing, and\n   announcement protocols).  Consistent delivery\
    \ can be ensured by\n   transmitting link-local multicast or broadcast packets\

    \ the source of AR messages and the integrity\n   of the AR information, this\
    \ avoids known security vulnerabilities\n   resulting from insertion of unauthorized\
    \ AR messages within a L2\n   infrastructure.  For IPv6, the SEND protocol [RFC3971]\
    \ may be used in\n   place of ND.  This defines security mechanisms that can protect\
    \ AR.\n   AR protocols can also be protected by the use of L2 security methods\n\
    \   (e.g., Encryption of the ULE SNDU [IPDVB-SEC]).  When these methods\n   are\
    \ used, the security of ARP and ND can be comparable to that of a\n   private\
    \ LAN: A Receiver will only accept ARP or ND transmissions from\n   the set of\
    \ peer senders that share a common group encryption and\n   common group authentication\
    \ key provided by the L2 key management.\n   AR Servers (Section 5.4) are susceptible\
    \ to the same kind of security\n   issues as end hosts using unsecured AR.  These\
    \ issues include\n   hijacking traffic and denial-of-service within the subnet.\
    \  Malicious\n   nodes within the subnet can take advantage of this property,\
    \ and\n   hijack traffic.  In addition, an AR Server is essentially a\n   legitimate\
    \ man-in-the-middle, which implies that there is a need to\n   distinguish such\
    \ proxies from unwanted man-in-the-middle attackers.\n   This document does not\
    \ introduce any new mechanisms for the\n   protection of these AR functions (e.g.,\
    \ authenticating servers, or\n   defining AR Servers that interoperate with the\
    \ SEND protocol\n   [SP-ND]).\n"
