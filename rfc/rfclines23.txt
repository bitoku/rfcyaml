TRANSMISSION OF MULTIPLE CONTROL MESSAGES
The network program at a site must be prepared to send or receive more than one control message in a single control communication.
During the time that the control link is blocked awaiting RFNM, it is possible that a number of control messages to a particular remote host will accumulate.
When the link is unblocked, these should all be sent in a single communication for greatest efficiency.
