  - "Discussion/Purpose\n   This memo documents some experiences with the RFC 1797\
    \ [1] subnet A\n   experiment (performed by the Net39 Test Group (see credits))\
    \ and\n   provides a number of recommendations on future direction for both the\n\
    \   Internet Registries and the Operations community.\n   Not all proposed experiments\
    \ in RFC 1797 were done. Only the \"case\n   one\" type delegations were made.\
    \  Additional experimentation was done\n   within the DNS service, by supporting\
    \ a root nameserver and the\n   primary for the domain from within the subnetted\
    \ address space.  In\n   addition, testing was done on classless delegation [2].\n\
    \   Internet Services offered over the RFC 1797 experiment were:\n         Finger\n\
    \         HTTP\n         Telnet\n         FTP server/client\n         Gopher\n\
    \         kerberos\n         lpr (and its ilk)\n         X\n         DNS\n   F.Root-Servers.Net,\
    \ a root name server had an interface defined as\n   part of the RFC 1797 experiment.\
    \  Attached is a report fragment on\n   it's performance: \"My root server has\
    \ processed 400,000,000 queries\n   in the last 38 days, and well over half of\
    \ them were to the temporary\n   39.13.229.241 address (note that I retained the\
    \ old 192.5.5.241\n   address since I knew a lot of folks would not update their\
    \ root.cache\n   files and I didn't want to create a black hole.)\" - Paul Vixie\n\
    \   Initial predictions [3] seemed to indicate that the safest path for\n   an\
    \ ISP that participates in such a routing system is to have -all- of\n   the ISP\
    \ clients be either:\n                a) singly connected to one upstream ISP\n\
    \        OR\n                b) running a classless interior routing protocol\n\
    \   It is also noted that a network with default route may not notice it\n   has\
    \ potential routing problems until it starts using subnets of\n   traditional\
    \ A's internally.\n"

- title: Operations
  contents:
  - "Operations\n   There were initial problems in at least one RIPE181 [4]\n   implementation.\
    \  It is clear that operators need to register in the\n   Internet Routing Registry\
    \ (IRR) all active aggregates and delegations\n   for any given prefix.  Additionally,\
    \ there need to be methods for\n   determining who is authoritative for announcing\
    \ any given prefix.\n   It is expected that problems identified within the confines\
    \ of this\n   experiment are applicable to some RFC 1597 prefixes or any \"natural\"\
    \n   class \"A\" space.\n   Use of traceroute (LSRR) was critical for network\
    \ troubleshooting\n   during this experiment. In current cisco IOS, coding the\
    \ following\n   statement will disable LSRR and therefore inhibit cross-provider\n\
    \   troubleshooting:\n                no ip source-route\n   We recommend that\
    \ this statement -NOT- be placed in active ISP cisco\n   configurations.\n   In\
    \ general, there are serious weaknesses in the Inter-Provider\n   cooperation\
    \ model and resolution of these problems is outside the\n   scope of this document.\
    \ Perhaps the IEPG or any/all of the national\n   or continental operations bodies\
    \ [5] will take this as an action item\n   for the continued health and viability\
    \ of the Internet.\n"
- title: Routing
  contents:
  - "Routing\n   A classic cisco configuration that has the following statements\n\
    \                ip route 39.1.28.0 255.255.255.0\n                router bgp\
    \ 64000\n                redistribute static\n   will, by default, promote any\
    \ classful subnet route to a full\n   classful route (supernet routes will be\
    \ left alone).  This behaviour\n   can be changed in at least the following two\
    \ ways:\n        1:\n                ip route 39.1.28.0 255.255.255.0\n      \
    \          router bgp 64000\n                no auto-summary\n               \
    \ redistribute static\n        2:\n                ip route 39.1.28.0 255.255.255.0\n\
    \                router bgp 64000\n                network 39.1.28.0 mask 255.255.255.0\n\
    \                redistribute static route-map static-bgp\n                ....\n\
    \                access-list 98 deny 39.1.28.0 0.255.255.255\n               \
    \ access-list 98 permit any\n                ....\n                route-map static-bgp\n\
    \                match ip address 98\n   Users of cisco gear currently need to\
    \ code the following two\n   statements:\n                ip classless\n     \
    \           ip subnet-zero\n   The implication of the first directive is that\
    \ it eliminates the idea\n   that if you know how to talk to a subnet of a network,\
    \ you know how\n   to talk to ALL of the network.\n   The second is needed since\
    \ it is no longer clear where the all-ones\n   or all-zeros networks are [6].\n\
    \   Other infrastructure gear exhibited similar or worse behaviour.\n   Equipment\
    \ that depends on use of a classful routing protocol, such a\n   RIPv1 are prone\
    \ to misconfiguration.  Tested examples are current\n   Ascend and Livingston\
    \ gear, which continue to use RIPv1 as the\n   default/only routing protocol.\
    \  RIPv1 use will create an aggregate\n   announcement.\n   This pernicious use\
    \ of this classful IGP was shown to impact\n   otherwise capable systems.  When\
    \ attempting to communicate between an\n   Ascend and a cisco the promotion problem\
    \ identified above, was\n   manifest. The problem turned out to be that a classful\
    \ IGP (RIPv1)\n   was being used between the Ascends and ciscos. The Ascend was\
    \ told to\n   announce 39.1.28/24, but since RIPv1 can't do this, the Ascend\n\
    \   instead sent 39/8.  We note that RIPv1, as with all classful IGPs\n   should\
    \ be considered historic.\n   This validates the predictions discussed in [3].\n"
- title: Cisco Specific Examples
  contents:
  - "Cisco Specific Examples\n   There are actually three ways to solve the unintended\
    \ aggregation\n   problem, as described with current cisco IOS.  Which of them\
    \ applies\n   will depend on what software version is in the router. Workarounds\n\
    \   can be implemented for ancient (e.g., 8.X) version software.\n        o Preferred\
    \ solution: turn on \"ip classless\" in the\n          routers and use a default\
    \ route inside the AS.\n          The \"ip classless\" command prevents the existence\
    \ of\n          a single \"subnet\" route from blocking access via the\n     \
    \     default route to other subnets of the same old-style network.\n        \
    \  Default only works with single-homed ISPs.\n        o Workaround for 9.1 or\
    \ later software where the\n          \"ip classless\" command is not available:\
    \ install a\n          \"default network route\" like this:\n          \"ip route\
    \ 39.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 <next-hop>\" along the axis\n          the default route\
    \ would normally take.  It appears\n          an ISP can utilize the \"recursive\
    \ route lookups\" so\n          the \"next-hop\" may not actually need to be a\
    \ directly\n          connected neighbour -- the internal router can e.g.,\n \
    \         point to a loopback interface on the border router.\n          This\
    \ can become \"really uncomfortably messy\" and it may\n          be necessary\
    \ to use a distribute-list to prevent\n          the announcement of the shorter\
    \ mask.\n        o Workaround for 9.0 or older software: create a\n          \"\
    default subnet route\": \"ip route 39.x.y.0 <next-hop>\"\n          combined with\
    \ \"ip default-network 39.x.y.0\", otherwise\n          as the 9.1 fix.\n   Both\
    \ of the latter solutions rely on manual configuration, and in the\n   long run\
    \ these will be impossible to maintain.  In some topologies\n   the use of manual\
    \ configuration can be a problem (e.g., if there is\n   more than one possible\
    \ exit point from the AS to choose from).\n"

  - "Recommendations:\n   The RFC 1797 experiment appears to have been a success.\
    \ We believe it\n   safe to start carving up \"Class A\" space, if the spaces\
    \ are delegated\n   according to normal IR conventions [7] and recommend the IANA\n\
    \   consider this for future address delegations.\n"
