  - "Introduction\n   Over the last several years, attendance at Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF) face-to-face meetings has grown phenomenally.  Many of\n\
    \   the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting, and many of those\n   go\
    \ on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were smaller,\n   it was\
    \ relatively easy for a newcomer to get into the swing of\n   things.  Today,\
    \ however, a newcomer meets many more new people, some\n   previously known only\
    \ as the authors of documents or thought-\n   provoking e-mail messages.\n   This\
    \ document describes many aspects of the IETF, with the goal of\n   explaining\
    \ to newcomers how the IETF works.  This will give them a\n   warm, fuzzy feeling\
    \ and enable them to make the meeting and the\n   Working Group discussions more\
    \ productive for everyone.\n   Of course, it's true that many IETF participants\
    \ don't go to the\n   face-to-face meetings at all.  Instead, they're active on\
    \ the mailing\n   list of various IETF Working Groups.  Since the inner workings\
    \ of\n   Working Groups can be hard for newcomers to understand, this FYI\n  \
    \ provides the mundane bits of information that newcomers will need in\n   order\
    \ to become active participants.\n   Many types of IETF documentation are mentioned\
    \ in the Tao, from BCPs\n   to RFCs and FYIs.  (BCPs make recommendations for\
    \ Best Current\n   Practices in the Internet; RFCs are the IETF's main technical\n\
    \   documentation series, politely known as \"Requests for Comments;\" and\n \
    \  FYIs provide topical and technical overviews that are introductory or\n   appeal\
    \ to a broad audience.  See Section 6 for more information.)\n   The acronyms\
    \ and abbreviations used in this document are usually\n   expanded in place, and\
    \ are explained fully in Section 9.\n"

- title: 1. What Is the IETF?
  contents:
  - "1. What Is the IETF?\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized\
    \ group\n   of people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet\n\
    \   technologies.  It is the principal body engaged in the development of\n  \
    \ new Internet standard specifications.  The IETF is unusual in that it\n   exists\
    \ as a collection of happenings, but is not a corporation and\n   has no board\
    \ of directors, no members, and no dues.\n   Its mission includes:\n   -  Identifying,\
    \ and proposing solutions to, pressing operational and\n      technical problems\
    \ in the Internet;\n   -  Specifying the development or usage of protocols and\
    \ the near-term\n      architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet;\n\
    \   -  Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n   \
    \   (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol\n      usage\
    \ in the Internet;\n   -  Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research\
    \ Task\n      Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community; and\n   -  Providing\
    \ a forum for the exchange of information within the\n      Internet community\
    \ between vendors, users, researchers, agency\n      contractors, and network\
    \ managers.\n   The IETF meeting is not a conference, although there are technical\n\
    \   presentations.  The IETF is not a traditional standards organization,\n  \
    \ although many specifications are produced that become standards.  The\n   IETF\
    \ is made up of volunteers, many of whom meet three times a year\n   to fulfill\
    \ the IETF mission.\n   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may register\
    \ for and\n   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being an IETF\n\
    \   member is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists (see\n   Section\
    \ 1.3).  This is where the best information about current IETF\n   activities\
    \ and focus can be found.\n   Of course, no organization can be as successful\
    \ as the IETF is\n   without having some sort of structure.  In the IETF's case,\
    \ that\n   structure is provided by other organizations, as described in BCP 11,\n\
    \   \"The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process.\"  If you\n  \
    \ participate in the IETF and only read one BCP, this is the one you\n   should\
    \ read.\n"
- title: 1.1 Humble Beginnings
  contents:
  - "1.1 Humble Beginnings\n   The first IETF meeting was held in January, 1986, at\
    \ Linkabit in San\n   Diego, with 21 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in\
    \ Menlo Park in\n   October, 1986, was the first that non-government vendors attended.\n\
    \   The concept of Working Groups was introduced at the 5th IETF meeting\n   at\
    \ the NASA Ames Research Center in California in February, 1987.\n   The 7th IETF,\
    \ held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in July, 1987, was\n   the first meeting with\
    \ over 100 attendees.\n   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University\
    \ in July 1989.\n   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.\
    \  The\n   IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture\n  \
    \ Board), which until that time oversaw many \"task forces,\" changed its\n  \
    \ structure to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is\n   tasked\
    \ to consider long-term research problems in the Internet.  The\n   IETF also\
    \ changed at that time.\n   After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January,\
    \ 1992, the\n   IAB proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place\n\
    \   under the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92 in Kobe,\n   Japan,\
    \ the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to\n   reflect the proposed\
    \ relationship.\n   The IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July 1993.\
    \  This was\n   the first IETF meeting held in Europe, and the US/non-US attendee\n\
    \   split was nearly 50/50.  One in five IETF meetings are now held in\n   Europe\
    \ or Asia, and the number of non-US attendees continues to be\n   high -- about\
    \ 50%, even at meetings held in the US.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.1 ISOC (Internet Society)\n   The Internet Society is an international, non-profit,\
    \ membership\n   organization that fosters the expansion of the Internet.  One\
    \ of the\n   ways that ISOC does this is through financial and legal support of\n\
    \   the other \"I\" groups described here, particularly the IETF.  ISOC's\n  \
    \ oversight of the IETF is remarkably hands-off, so many IETF\n   participants\
    \ don't even know about it.  ISOC provides insurance\n   coverage for many of\
    \ the people in the IETF process, and acts as a\n   public relations channel for\
    \ the times that one of the \"I\" groups\n   wants to say something to the press.\
    \  The ISOC is one of the major\n   unsung (and under-funded) heroes of the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.2.2 IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)
  contents:
  - "1.2.2 IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)\n   The IESG is responsible\
    \ for technical management of IETF activities\n   and the Internet standards process.\
    \  It administers the process\n   according to the rules and procedures that have\
    \ been ratified by the\n   ISOC Trustees.  However, the IESG doesn't do much direct\
    \ leadership,\n   such as the kind you will find in many other standards organizations.\n\
    \   The IESG ratifies or corrects the output from the IETF's Working\n   Groups,\
    \ gets WGs started and finished, and makes sure that non-WG\n   drafts that are\
    \ about to become RFCs are correct.\n   The IESG consists of the Area Directors\
    \ (\"ADs\"), who are selected by\n   the Nominations Committee (which is usually\
    \ called \"Nomcom\") and are\n   appointed for two years.  The process for choosing\
    \ the members of the\n   IESG is detailed in BCP 10, \"IAB and IESG Selection,\
    \ Confirmation,\n   and Recall Process:  Operation of the Nominating and Recall\n\
    \   Committees.\"\n   The current areas and abbreviations are:\n   -  Applications\
    \ (APP)   Protocols seen by user programs, such as\n                         \
    \  e-mail and the Web\n   -  General (GEN)        Catch-all for WGs that don't\
    \ fit in other\n                           areas (which is very few)\n   -  Internet\
    \ (INT)       Different ways of moving IP packets and DNS\n                  \
    \         information\n   -  Operations and       Operational aspects, network\

    \ and privacy\n   -  Transport (TSV)      Special services for special packets\n\
    \   -  User Services (USV)  Support for end users and user support\n         \
    \                  organizations\n   Because the IESG has a great deal of influence\
    \ on whether Internet\n   Drafts become RFCs, many people look at the ADs as somewhat\
    \ godlike\n   creatures.  IETF participants sometimes reverently ask an Area\n\
    \   Director for their opinion on a particular subject.  However, most\n   ADs\
    \ are nearly indistinguishable from mere mortals and rarely speak\n   from mountaintops.\
    \  In fact, when asked for specific technical\n   comments, the ADs may often\
    \ defer to members at large whom they feel\n   have more knowledge than they do\
    \ in that area.\n   The ADs for a particular area are expected to know more about\
    \ the\n   combined work of the WGs in that area than anyone else.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, the entire IESG discusses each Internet Draft that is proposed\n   to\
    \ become an RFC.  At least two IESG members must express concerns\n   before a\
    \ draft can be blocked from moving forward.  These checks help\n   ensure that\
    \ an AD's \"pet project\" doesn't make it onto the standards\n   track if it will\
    \ have a negative effect on the rest of the IETF\n   protocols.\n   This is not\
    \ to say that the IESG never wields power.  When the IESG\n   sees a Working Group\
    \ veering from its charter, or when a WG asks the\n   IESG to make the WG's badly\
    \ designed protocol a standard, the IESG\n   will act.  In fact, because of its\
    \ high workload, the IESG usually\n   moves in a reactive fashion.  It approves\
    \ most WG requests for\n   Internet Drafts to become RFCs, and usually only steps\
    \ in when\n   something has gone very wrong.  Another way to think about this\
    \ is\n   that the ADs are selected to think, not to just run the process.  The\n\
    \   quality of the IETF standards comes both from the review they get in\n   the\
    \ Working Groups and the review that the WG review gets from the\n   ADs.\n  \
    \ The IETF is run by rough consensus, and it is the IESG that decides\n   if a\
    \ WG has come up with a result that has a real consensus.  Because\n   of this,\
    \ one of the main reasons that the IESG might block something\n   that was produced\
    \ in a WG is that the result did not really gain\n   consensus in the IETF as\
    \ a whole, that is, among all of the Working\n   Groups in all areas.  For instance,\
    \ the result of one WG might clash\n   with a technology developed in a different\
    \ Working Group.  An\n   important job of the IESG is to watch over the output\
    \ of all the WGs\n   to help prevent IETF protocols that are at odds with each\
    \ other.\n   This is why ADs are supposed to review the drafts coming out of areas\n\
    \   other than their own.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.3 IAB (Internet Architecture Board)\n   The IAB is responsible for keeping\
    \ an eye on the \"big picture\" of the\n   Internet, and focuses on long-range\
    \ planning and coordination among\n   the various areas of IETF activity.  The\
    \ IAB stays informed about\n   important long-term issues in the Internet, and\
    \ brings these topics\n   to the attention of people they think should know about\
    \ them.\n   IAB members pay special attention to emerging activities in the IETF.\n\
    \   When a new IETF working group is proposed, the IAB reviews its\n   charter\
    \ for architectural consistency and integrity.  Even before the\n   group is chartered,\
    \ the IAB members are more than willing to discuss\n   new ideas with the people\
    \ proposing them.\n   The IAB also sponsors and organizes the Internet Research\
    \ Task Force,\n   and convenes invitational workshops that provide in-depth reviews\
    \ of\n   specific Internet architectural issues.  Typically, the workshop\n  \

- title: 1.2.4 IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
  contents:
  - "1.2.4 IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)\n   The core registrar for the\
    \ IETF's activities is the IANA.  Many\n   Internet protocols require that someone\
    \ keep track of protocol items\n   that were added after the protocol came out.\
    \  Typical examples of the\n   kinds of registries needed are for TCP port numbers\
    \ and MIME types.\n   The IAB has designated the IANA organization to perform\
    \ these tasks,\n   and the IANA's activities are financially supported by ICANN,\
    \ the\n   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\n   Five years\
    \ ago, no one would have expected to ever see the IANA\n   mentioned on the front\

    \ that IANA was also the keeper of the\n   root of the domain name system forced\
    \ it to become a much more public\n   entity, one which was badly maligned by\
    \ a variety of people who never\n   looked at what its role was.  Nowadays the\
    \ IETF is generally no\n   longer involved in the IANA's domain name and IP address\

    \ a registrar may not sound interesting, many IETF\n   participants will testify\
    \ to how important IANA has been for the\n   Internet.  Having a stable, long-term\
    \ repository run by careful and\n   conservative operators makes it much easier\
    \ for people to experiment\n   without worrying about messing things up.  IANA's\
    \ founder, Jon\n   Postel, was heavily relied upon to keep things in order while\
    \ the\n   Internet kept growing by leaps and bounds, and he did a fine job of\n\
    \   it until his untimely death in 1998.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3  IETF Mailing Lists\n   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should\
    \ join the IETF\n   announcement mailing list, \"ietf-announce@ietf.org\".  This\
    \ is where\n   all of the meeting information, Internet Draft and RFC announcements,\n\
    \   and IESG Protocol Actions and Last Calls are posted.  People who\n   would\
    \ like to \"get technical\" may also join the IETF discussion list,\n   \"ietf@ietf.org\"\
    .  This is where discussions of cosmic significance\n   are held (Working Groups\
    \ have their own mailing lists for discussions\n   related to their work).\n \
    \  Subscriptions to these and other IETF mailing lists are handled by a\n   program\
    \ called Majordomo.  Majordomo tends to be somewhat finicky\n   about the format\
    \ of subscription messages, and interacts poorly with\n   email programs that\
    \ make all email messages into HTML files.\n   Majordomo will treat you well,\
    \ however, if you format your messages\n   just the way it likes.  To join the\
    \ IETF announcement list, for\n   example, send email to:\n      ietf-announce-request@ietf.org\n\
    \   Enter the word 'subscribe' (without the quotes) in the Subject line\n   of\
    \ the message and in the message body.  To join the IETF discussion\n   list,\
    \ send email to:\n      ietf-request@ietf.org\n   and enter the word 'subscribe'\
    \ as explained above.  If you decide to\n   withdraw from either list, use the\
    \ word 'unsubscribe.' Your messages\n   to Majordomo should have nothing other\
    \ than the commands 'subscribe'\n   or 'unsubscribe' in them.\n   Both lists are\
    \ archived on the IETF web site:\n      http://www.ietf.org/maillist.html\n  \
    \ Do not, ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request\n   to\
    \ join a list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the\n   list don't\
    \ need, or want, to know when a new person joins.\n   Similarly, when changing\
    \ e-mail addresses or leaving a list, send\n   your request only to the \"-request\"\
    \ address, not to the main list.\n   This means you!!\n   The IETF discussion\
    \ list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can\n   express their opinions\
    \ about issues affecting the Internet.  However,\n   it is not a place for companies\
    \ or individuals to solicit or\n   advertise, as noted in \"IETF Discussion List\
    \ Charter,\" RFC 3005.  It\n   is a good idea to read the whole RFC (it's short!)\
    \ before posting to\n   the IETF discussion list.\n   Only the Secretariat can\
    \ send messages to the announcement list.\n   Even though the IETF mailing lists\

- title: 2. IETF Meetings
  contents:
  - "2. IETF Meetings\n   The computer industry is rife with conferences, seminars,\n\
    \   expositions, and all manner of other kinds of meetings.  IETF face-\n   to-face\
    \ meetings are nothing like these.  The meetings, held three\n   times a year,\
    \ are week-long dweebfests whose primary goal is to\n   reinvigorate the WGs to\
    \ get their tasks done, and whose secondary\n   goal is to promote a fair amount\
    \ of mixing between the WGs and the\n   areas.  The cost of the meetings is paid\
    \ by the people attending and\n   by the corporate host for each meeting, although\
    \ ISOC kicks in\n   additional funds for things like the multicast simulcast of\
    \ some\n   Working Group sessions.\n   For many people, IETF meetings are a breath\
    \ of fresh air when\n   compared to the standard computer industry conferences.\
    \  There is no\n   exposition hall, few tutorials, and no big-name industry pundits.\n\
    \   Instead, there is lots of work, as well as a fair amount of time for\n   socializing.\
    \  IETF meetings are of little interest to sales and\n   marketing folks, but\
    \ of high interest to engineers and developers.\n   Most IETF meetings are held\
    \ in North America, because that's where\n   most of the participants are from;\
    \ however, meetings are held on\n   other continents about once every year or\
    \ two.  The past few meetings\n   have had about 2,500 attendees.  There have\
    \ been over 50 IETF\n   meetings so far, and a list of upcoming meetings is available\
    \ on the\n   IETF web pages, http://www.ietf.org/meetings/0mtg-sites.txt.\n  \
    \ Newcomers to IETF face-to-face meetings are often in a bit of shock.\n   They\
    \ expect them to be like other standards bodies, or like computer\n   conferences.\
    \  Fortunately, the shock wears off after a day or two,\n   and many new attendees\
    \ get quite animated about how much fun they are\n   having.  One particularly\
    \ jarring feature of recent IETF meetings is\n   the use of wireless Internet\
    \ connections throughout the meeting\n   space.  It is common to see half the\
    \ people in a WG meeting reading\n   e-mail or perusing the web during presentations\
    \ they find\n   uninteresting.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1 Registration\n   To attend an IETF meeting you have to register and you have\
    \ to pay\n   the registration fee.  The meeting site and advance registration\
    \ are\n   announced about two months ahead of the meeting -- earlier if\n   possible.\
    \  An announcement goes out via e-mail to the IETF-announce\n   mailing list,\
    \ and information is posted on the IETF web site,\n   http://www.ietf.org, that\
    \ same day.\n   To pre-register, you must submit your registration on the Web.\
    \  You\n   may pre-register and pre-pay, pre-register and return to the Web site\n\
    \   later to pay with a credit card, pre-register and pay on-site at the\n   meeting,\
    \ or register and pay on-site.  To get a lower registration\n   fee, you must\
    \ pay by the early registration deadline (about one week\n   before the meeting).\
    \  The registration fee covers all of the week's\n   meetings, the Sunday evening\
    \ reception (cash bar), daily continental\n   breakfasts, and afternoon coffee\
    \ breaks.\n   Credit card payments on the web are encrypted and secure, or, if\
    \ you\n   prefer, you can use PGP to send your payment information to the\n  \
    \ Registrar (ietf-registrar@ietf.org).\n   Registration is open throughout the\
    \ week of the meeting.  However,\n   the Secretariat highly recommends that attendees\
    \ arrive for early\n   registration, beginning at noon on Sunday and continuing\
    \ throughout\n   the 5:00 Sunday evening reception.  The reception is a popular\
    \ event\n   where you can get a bite to eat and socialize with other early\n \
    \  arrivals.\n   Registered attendees (and there aren't any other kind) receive\
    \ a\n   registration packet.  It contains much useful information, including\n\
    \   a general orientation sheet, the most recent agenda, and a name tag.\n   Attendees\
    \ who pre-paid will also find their receipt in their packet.\n   It's worth noting\

  - "2.2 Newcomers' Orientation\n   Newcomers are encouraged to attend the Newcomers'\
    \ Orientation, which\n   is especially designed for first-time attendees.  The\
    \ orientation is\n   organized and conducted by the IETF Secretariat, and is intended\
    \ to\n   provide useful introductory information.  The orientation is\n   typically\
    \ about 30 minutes long and covers what's in the attendee\n   packets, what all\
    \ the dots on name tags mean, the structure of the\n   IETF, and many other essential\
    \ and enlightening topics for new\n   IETFers.\n   Immediately following the Newcomers'\
    \ Orientation is the IETF\n   Standards Process Orientation.  This session demystifies\
    \ much of the\n   standards process by explaining what stages a document has to\
    \ pass\n   through on its way to becoming a standard, and what has to be done\
    \ to\n   advance to the next stage.  The Standards Process Orientation also\n\
    \   lasts about 30 minutes.\n   There is ample time at the end for questions.\
    \  The Secretariat also\n   provides handouts that include an overview of the\
    \ IETF, a list of\n   important files available online, and hard copies of the\
    \ slides of\n   the \"IETF Structure and Internet Standards Process\" presentation.\n\
    \   These very useful slides are also available online at www.ietf.org\n   under\
    \ \"Additional Information\".\n   The orientation is held on Sunday afternoon\
    \ before the 5:00 p.m.\n   reception (check the agenda for exact time and location).\

- title: 2.3 Dress Code
  contents:
  - "2.3 Dress Code\n   Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also\
    \ wear shirts\n   or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously\n\
    \   though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday\n  \
    \ morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing t-\n   shirts,\
    \ jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are\n   those in the\
    \ IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.\n   Fortunately, they are\
    \ well known (for other reasons) so they are\n   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.\
    \  The general rule is \"dress\n   for the weather\" (unless you plan to work\

    \ is the rule!).\n"
- title: 2.4 Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes
  contents:
  - "2.4 Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes\n   Some of the people at the IETF will have\

    \ and points of interest in the area.\n   It is important that newcomers to the\
    \ IETF not be afraid to strike up\n   conversations with people who wear these\
    \ dots.  If the IAB and IESG\n   members and Working Group and BOF chairs didn't\

- title: 2.5 Terminal Room
  contents:
  - "2.5 Terminal Room\n   One of the most important (depending on your point of view)\
    \ things\n   the host does is provide Internet access for the meeting attendees.\n\
    \   In general, wired and wireless connectivity is excellent.  This is\n   entirely\
    \ due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their\n   ability to beg,\
    \ borrow and steal.  The people and companies who\n   donate their equipment,\
    \ services and time are to be heartily\n   congratulated and thanked.\n   While\
    \ preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there\n   may be some\
    \ unavoidable \"last minute\" things that can be accomplished\n   in the terminal\
    \ room.  It may also be useful to people who need to\n   make trip reports or\
    \ status reports while things are still fresh in\n   their minds.  The terminal\
    \ room provides workstations, one or two\n   printers, and ports for laptops.\n"

    \ some people eat\n   very well at the IETF, they find the food on their own;\
    \ lunches and\n   dinners are not included in the registration fee.  The Secretariat\n\
    \   does provide appetizers at the Sunday evening reception (not meant to\n  \
    \ be a replacement for dinner), continental breakfast every morning,\n   and (best\
    \ of all) cookies, brownies and other yummies during\n   afternoon breaks.\n \
    \  If you prefer to get out of the hotel for meals, the local host\n   usually\

  - "2.7 Social Event\n   Another of the most important things organized and managed\
    \ by the\n   host is the IETF social event.  Sometimes, the social event is a\n\
    \   computer or high-tech related event.  At the Boston IETF, for\n   example,\
    \ the social was dinner at the Computer Museum.  Other times,\n   the social might\
    \ be a dinner cruise or a trip to an art gallery.\n   Newcomers to the IETF are\
    \ encouraged to attend the social event.\n   Everyone is encouraged to wear their\
    \ name tags and leave their\n   laptops behind.  The social event is designed\

- title: 2.8 Agenda
  contents:
  - "2.8 Agenda\n   The agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is\

    \   meeting, and is also available on the web.  The agenda for the 50th\n   IETF,\
    \ for example, is at http://www.ietf.org/meetings/agenda_50.html.\n   The final\
    \ agenda is included in the registration packets.  Of course,\n   \"final\" in\
    \ the IETF doesn't mean the same thing as it does elsewhere\n   in the world.\
    \  The final agenda is simply the version that went to\n   the printer.  The Secretariat\
    \ will post agenda changes on the\n   bulletin board near the IETF registration\
    \ desk (not the hotel\n   registration desk).\n   Assignments for breakout rooms\
    \ (where the Working Groups and BOFs\n   meet) and a map showing the room locations\
    \ are also shown on the\n   agenda.  Room assignments can change as the agenda\
    \ changes.  Some\n   Working Groups meet multiple times during a meeting and every\

    \  There are many\n   people who have been very active in the IETF who have never\
    \ attended\n   an IETF meeting.  You should not feel obligated to come to an IETF\n\
    \   meeting just to get a feel for the IETF.  The following guidelines\n   (based\
    \ on stereotypes of people in various industries) might help you\n   decide whether\

- title: 2.9.1  IS Managers
  contents:
  - "2.9.1  IS Managers\n   As discussed throughout this document, an IETF meeting\

    \   bad places to go if your intention is to find out what will be hot in\n  \
    \ the Internet industry next year.  You can safely assume that going to\n   Working\
    \ Group meetings will confuse you more than it will help you\n   understand what\
    \ is happening, or will be happening, in the industry.\n   This is not to say\
    \ that no one from industry should go to IETF\n   meetings.  As an IS manager,\
    \ you might want to consider sending\n   specific people who are responsible for\
    \ technologies that are under\n   development in the IETF.  As these people read\
    \ the current Internet\n   Drafts and the traffic on the relevant Working Group\

    \ is always using\n   the very latest hardware and software, and you are following\
    \ the\n   relevant Working Groups in your copious free time, you might find\n\
    \   attending the IETF meeting valuable.  The closer you are to the\n   bleeding\

  - "2.9.3  Networking Hardware and Software Vendors\n   The image of the IETF being\
    \ mostly ivory tower academics may have\n   been true in the past, but the jobs\
    \ of typical attendees are now in\n   industry.  In most areas of the IETF, employees\
    \ of vendors are the\n   ones writing the protocols and leading the Working Groups,\
    \ so it's\n   completely appropriate for vendors to attend.  If you create Internet\n\
    \   hardware or software, and no one from your company has ever attended\n   an\
    \ IETF meeting, it behooves you to come to a meeting if for no other\n   reason\
    \ than to tell the others how relevant the meeting was or was\n   not to your\
    \ business.\n   This is not to say that companies should close up shop during\
    \ IETF\n   meeting weeks so everyone can go to the meeting.  Marketing folks,\n\
    \   even technical marketing folks, are usually safe in staying away from\n  \
    \ the IETF as long as some of the technical people from the company are\n   at\
    \ the meeting.  Similarly, it isn't required, or likely useful, for\n   everyone\
    \ from a technical department to go, particularly if they are\n   not all reading\
    \ the Internet Drafts and following the Working Group\n   mailing lists.  Many\

- title: 2.11  Other General Things
  contents:
  - "2.11  Other General Things\n   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers in general,\
    \ are very approachable.\n   Never be afraid to approach someone and introduce\
    \ yourself.  Also,\n   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when it comes\
    \ to jargon\n   and acronyms!\n   Hallway conversations are very important.  A\
    \ lot of very good work\n   gets done by people who talk together between meetings\
    \ and over\n   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF can be considered\
    \ work\n   time (much to some people's dismay).\n   A \"bar BOF\" is an unofficial\
    \ get-together, usually in the late\n   evening, during which a lot of work gets\
    \ done over drinks.  Bar BOFs\n   spring up in many different places around an\
    \ IETF meeting, such as\n   restaurants, coffee shops, and (if we are so lucky)\
    \ pools.\n   It's unwise to get between a hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other\n\
    \   kind) and coffee break brownies and cookies, no matter how\n   interesting\
    \ a hallway conversation is.\n   IETFers are fiercely independent.  It's safe\
    \ to question opinions and\n   offer alternatives, but don't expect an IETFer\
    \ to follow orders.\n   The IETF, and the plenary session in particular, are not\
    \ places for\n   vendors to try to sell their wares.  People can certainly answer\n\

  - "3.0 Working Groups\n   The vast majority of the IETF's work is done in many \"\
    Working\n   Groups;\" at the time of this writing, there are about 115 different\n\
    \   WGs.  (The term \"Working Group\" is often seen capitalized, but\n   probably\
    \ not for a very good reason.)  BCP 25, \"IETF Working Group\n   Guidelines and\
    \ Procedures,\" is an excellent resource for anyone\n   participating in WG discussions.\n\
    \   A WG is really just a mailing list with a bit of adult supervision.\n   You\
    \ \"join\" the WG by subscribing to the mailing list; all mailing\n   lists are\
    \ open to anyone.  Some IETF WG mailing lists only let\n   subscribers to the\
    \ mailing list post to the mailing list, while\n   others let anyone post.  Each\
    \ Working Group has one or two chairs.\n   More importantly, each WG has a charter\
    \ that the WG is supposed to\n   follow.  The charter states the scope of discussion\
    \ for the Working\n   Group, as well as its goals.  The WG's mailing list and\
    \ face-to-face\n   meetings are supposed to focus on just what is in the charter,\
    \ and\n   not to wander off on other \"interesting\" topics.  Of course, looking\n\
    \   a bit outside the scope of the WG is occasionally useful, but the\n   large\
    \ majority of the discussion should be on the topics listed in\n   the charter.\
    \  In fact, some WG charters actually specify what the WG\n   will not do, particularly\
    \ if there were some attractive but nebulous\n   topics brought up during the\
    \ drafting of the charter.  The list of\n   all WG charters makes interesting\
    \ reading for folks who want to know\n   what the different Working Groups are\
    \ supposed to be doing.\n"
- title: 3.1 Working Group Chairs
  contents:
  - "3.1 Working Group Chairs\n   The role of the WG chairs is described in both BCP\
    \ 11 and BCP 25.\n   Basically, their job is to keep the discussion moving forward\
    \ towards\n   the milestones in the WG charter -- usually publication of one or\n\
    \   more RFCs.  They are not meant to be taskmasters, but are responsible\n  \
    \ for assuring positive forward motion and preventing random wandering.\n   As\
    \ you can imagine, some Working Group chairs are much better at\n   their jobs\
    \ than others.  When a WG has fulfilled its charter, it is\n   supposed to cease\
    \ operations.  (Most WG mailing lists continue on\n   after a WG is closed, still\
    \ discussing the same topics as the Working\n   Group did.)  In the IETF, it is\
    \ a mark of success that the WG closes\n   up because it fulfilled its charter.\
    \  This is one of the aspects of\n   the IETF that newcomers who have experience\
    \ with other standards\n   bodies have a hard time understanding.  However, some\
    \ WG chairs never\n   manage to get their WG to finish, or keep adding new tasks\
    \ to the\n   charter so that the Working Group drags on for many years.  The\n\
    \   output of these aging WGs is often not nearly as useful as the\n   earlier\
    \ products, and the messy results are sometimes called\n   \"degenerative Working\
    \ Group syndrome.\"\n   One important role of the chair is to decide which Internet\
    \ Drafts\n   get published as \"official\" Working Group drafts, and which don't.\n\
    \   In practice, there is actually not much procedural difference between\n  \
    \ WG drafts and independent drafts; for example, many WG mailing lists\n   also\
    \ discuss independent drafts (at the discretion of the WG chair).\n   Procedures\
    \ for Internet Drafts are covered in much more detail later\n   in this document.\n\
    \   WG chairs are strongly advised to go to the new chairs' training\n   lunch\
    \ the first day of the IETF meeting.  If you're interested in\n   what they hear\
    \ there, take a look at the slides at\n   http://www.ietf.org/wgchair/index.htm.\n"
- title: 3.2  Getting Things Done in a Working Group
  contents:
  - "3.2  Getting Things Done in a Working Group\n   One fact that confuses many novices\
    \ is that the face-to-face WG\n   meetings are much less important in the IETF\
    \ than they are in most\n   other organizations.  Any decision made at a face-to-face\
    \ meeting\n   must also gain consensus on the WG mailing list.  There are numerous\n\
    \   examples of important decisions made in WG meetings that are later\n   overturned\
    \ on the mailing list, often because someone who couldn't\n   attend the meeting\
    \ pointed out a serious flaw in the logic used to\n   come to the decision.\n\
    \   Another aspect of Working Groups that confounds many people is the\n   fact\
    \ that there is no formal voting.  The general rule on disputed\n   topics is\
    \ that the Working Group has to come to \"rough consensus,\"\n   meaning that\
    \ a very large majority of those who care must agree.  The\n   exact method of\
    \ determining rough consensus varies from Working Group\n   to Working Group.\
    \  The lack of voting has caused some very long\n   delays for some proposals,\
    \ but most IETF participants who have\n   witnessed rough consensus after acrimonious\
    \ debates feel that the\n   delays often result in better protocols.  (And, if\
    \ you think about\n   it, how could you have \"voting\" in a group that anyone\
    \ can join, and\n   when it's impossible to count the participants?)\n"
- title: 3.3  Preparing for Working Group Meetings
  contents:
  - "3.3  Preparing for Working Group Meetings\n   The most important thing that everyone\
    \ (newcomers and seasoned\n   experts) should do before coming to a face-to-face\
    \ meeting is to read\n   the Internet Drafts and RFCs beforehand.  WG meetings\
    \ are explicitly\n   not for education:  they are for developing the group's documents.\n\
    \   Even if you do not plan to say anything in the meeting, you should\n   read\
    \ the group's documents before attending so you can understand\n   what is being\
    \ said.\n   It's up to the WG chair to set the meeting agenda, usually a few\n\
    \   weeks in advance.  If you want something discussed at the meeting, be\n  \
    \ sure to let the chair know about it.  The agendas for all the WG\n   meetings\
    \ are available in advance (see\n   http://www.ietf.org/meetings/wg_agenda_xx.html,\
    \ where 'xx' is the\n   meeting number), but many WG chairs are lax (if not totally\n\
    \   negligent) about turning them in.\n   The Secretariat only schedules WG meetings\
    \ a few weeks in advance,\n   and the schedule often changes as little as a week\
    \ before the first\n   day.  If you are only coming for one WG meeting, you may\
    \ have a hard\n   time booking your flight with such little notice, particularly\
    \ if the\n   Working Group's meeting changes schedule.  Be sure to keep track\
    \ of\n   the current agenda so you can schedule flights and hotels.  But, when\n\
    \   it comes down to it, you probably shouldn't be coming for just one WG\n  \
    \ meeting.  It's likely that your knowledge could be valuable in a few\n   WGs,\
    \ assuming that you've read the drafts and RFCs for those groups.\n   If you're\
    \ giving a presentation at a face-to-face meeting, you should\n   probably come\
    \ with a few slides prepared.  Projectors for laptop-\n   based presentations\
    \ are available in all the meeting rooms.  And\n   here's a tip for your slides:\
    \  don't put your company's logo on every\n   one, even though it's common practice\
    \ outside the IETF.  The IETF\n   frowns on this kind of corporate advertising,\
    \ and most presenters\n   don't even put their logo on their opening slide.  The\
    \ IETF is about\n   technical content, not company boosterism.\n"
- title: 3.4  Working Group Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "3.4  Working Group Mailing Lists\n   As we mentioned earlier, the IETF announcement\
    \ and discussion mailing\n   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.\
    \  However,\n   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For\n\
    \   example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In\n   addition,\
    \ there are some long-term technical debates that have been\n   moved off of the\
    \ IETF list onto lists created specifically for those\n   topics.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that everybody follow the\n   discussions on the mailing lists of\
    \ the Working Groups that they wish\n   to attend.  The more work that is done\
    \ on the mailing lists, the less\n   work that will need to be done at the meeting,\
    \ leaving time for cross\n   pollination (i.e., attending Working Groups outside\
    \ one's primary\n   area of interest in order to broaden one's perspective).\n\
    \   The mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,\n   or\
    \ contribute to, the Working Groups' efforts, but can't attend the\n   IETF meetings.\n\
    \   Most IETF discussion lists use Majordomo and have a \"-request\"\n   address\
    \ which handles the administrative details of joining and\n   leaving the list.\
    \  (See Section 1.3 for more information on\n   Majordomo.)  It is generally frowned\
    \ upon when such administrivia\n   appears on the discussion mailing list.\n \

- title: 4. BOFs
  contents:
  - "4. BOFs\n   In order to form a Working Group, you need a charter and someone\
    \ who\n   is able to be chair.  In order to get those things, you need to get\n\
    \   people interested so that they can help focus the charter and\n   convince\
    \ an Area Director that the project is worthwhile.  A face-\n   to-face meeting\
    \ is useful for this.  In fact, very few WGs get\n   started by an Area Director;\
    \ most start after a face-to-face BOF\n   because attendees have expressed interest\
    \ in the topic.\n   A BOF meeting has to be approved by the Area Director in the\
    \ relevant\n   area before it can be scheduled.  If you think you really need\
    \ a new\n   WG, approach an AD informally with your proposal and see what they\n\
    \   think.  The next step is to request a meeting slot at the next face-\n   to-face\
    \ meeting.  Of course, you don't need to wait for that meeting\n   to get some\
    \ work done, such as setting up a mailing list and starting\n   to discuss a charter.\n\
    \   BOF meetings have a very different tone than WG meetings.  The\n   purpose\
    \ of a BOF is to make sure that a good charter with good\n   milestones can be\
    \ created, and that there are enough people willing\n   to do the work needed\
    \ in order to create standards.  Some BOFs have\n   Internet Drafts already in\
    \ process, while others start from scratch.\n   An advantage of having a draft\
    \ before the BOF is to help focus the\n   discussion.  On the other hand, having\
    \ a draft might tend to limit\n   what the other folks in the BOF want to do in\
    \ the charter.  It's\n   important to remember that most BOFs are held in order\
    \ to get support\n   for an eventual Working Group, not to get support for a particular\n\
    \   document.\n   Many BOFs don't turn into WGs for a variety of reasons.  A common\n\
    \   problem is that not enough people can agree on a focus for the work.\n   Another\
    \ typical reason is that the work wouldn't end up being a\n   standard -- if,\
    \ for example, the document authors don't really want\n   to relinquish change\
    \ control to a WG.  (We'll discuss change control\n   later in this document.)\
    \  Only two meetings of a BOF can be scheduled\n   on a particular subject; either\
    \ a WG has to form, or the topic should\n   be dropped.\n"

- title: 6.1 Getting a Standard Published
  contents:
  - "6.1 Getting a Standard Published\n   One of the most common questions seasoned\
    \ IETFers hear from newcomers\n   is, \"How do I get an IETF standard published?\"\
    \  A much better\n   question is, \"Should I write an IETF standard?\" since the\
    \ answer is\n   not always \"yes.\"  If you do decide to try to write a document\
    \ that\n   becomes an IETF standard, be warned that the overall process may be\n\
    \   arduous, even if the individual steps are fairly straightforward.\n   Lots\
    \ of people get through the process unscathed, though, and there's\n   plenty\
    \ of written guidance that helps authors emerge with their ego\n   more or less\
    \ intact.\n   Every IETF standard is published as an RFC (a \"Request For Comments,\"\
    \n   but everyone just calls them RFCs), and every RFC starts out as an\n   Internet\
    \ Draft (often called an \"I-D\").  The basic steps for getting\n   something\
    \ published as an IETF standard are:\n      1. Publish the document as an Internet\
    \ Draft\n      2. Receive comments on the draft\n      3. Edit your draft based\
    \ on the comments\n      4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 a few times\n      5. Ask\
    \ an Area Director to take the draft to the IESG (if it's an\n         individual\
    \ submission).  If the draft is an official Working\n         Group product, the\
    \ WG chair asks the AD to take it to the IESG.\n      6. Make any changes deemed\
    \ necessary by the IESG (this might\n         include giving up on becoming a\
    \ standard)\n      7. Wait for the document to be published by the RFC Editor\n\
    \   A much more complete explanation of these steps is contained in BCP\n   9,\
    \ \"The Internet Standards Process.\"  Anyone who writes a draft that\n   they\
    \ hope will become an IETF standard must read BCP 9 so that they\n   can follow\
    \ the path of their document through the process.  BCP 9\n   goes into great detail\
    \ on a topic that is very often misunderstood,\n   even by seasoned IETF participants:\
    \  different types of RFCs go\n   through different processes and have different\
    \ rankings.  There are\n   six kinds of RFCs:\n      -  Proposed standards\n \
    \     -  Draft standards\n      -  Internet standards (sometimes called \"full\
    \ standards\")\n      -  Experimental protocols\n      -  Informational documents\n\
    \      -  Historic standards\n   Only the first three (proposed, draft, and full)\
    \ are standards within\n   the IETF.  A good summary of this can be found in the\
    \ aptly titled\n   RFC 1796, \"Not All RFCs are Standards.\"\n   There are also\
    \ three sub-series of RFCs, known as FYIs, BCPs, and\n   STDs.  The For Your Information\
    \ RFC sub-series was created to\n   document overviews and topics which are introductory\
    \ or appeal to a\n   broad audience.  Frequently, FYIs are created by groups within\
    \ the\n   IETF User Services Area.  Best Current Practice documents describe\n\
    \   the application of various technologies in the Internet.  The STD RFC\n  \
    \ sub-series was created to identify RFCs that do in fact specify\n   Internet\
    \ standards.  Some STDs are actually sets of more than one\n   RFC, and the \"\
    standard\" designation applies to the whole set of\n   documents.\n"
- title: 6.2 Letting Go Gracefully
  contents:
  - "6.2 Letting Go Gracefully\n   The biggest reason some people do not want their\
    \ documents put on the\n   IETF standards track is that they must give up change\
    \ control of the\n   protocol.  That is, as soon as you propose that your protocol\
    \ become\n   an IETF standard, you must fully relinquish control of the protocol.\n\
    \   If there is general agreement, parts of the protocol can be\n   completely\
    \ changed, whole sections can be ripped out, new things can\n   be added, and\
    \ the name can be changed.\n   Some authors find it very hard to give up control\
    \ of their pet\n   protocol.  If you are one of those people, don't even think\
    \ about\n   trying to get your protocol to become an IETF standard.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, if your goal is the best standard possible with the widest\n   implementation,\
    \ then you might find the IETF process to your liking.\n   Incidentally, the change\
    \ control on Internet standards doesn't end\n   when the protocol is put on the\
    \ standards track.  The protocol itself\n   can be changed later for a number\
    \ of reasons, the most common of\n   which is that implementors discover a problem\
    \ as they implement the\n   standard.  These later changes are also under the\
    \ control of the\n   IETF, not the editors of the standards document.\n   IETF\
    \ standards exist so that people will use them to write Internet\n   programs\
    \ that interoperate.  They don't exist to document the\n   (possibly wonderful)\
    \ ideas of their authors, nor do they exist so\n   that a company can say \"we\
    \ have an IETF standard.\"  If a standards-\n   track RFC only has one implementation\
    \ (whereas two are required for\n   it to advance on the standards track), it\
    \ was probably a mistake to\n   put it on the standards track in the first place.\n"
- title: 6.3 Internet Drafts
  contents:
  - "6.3 Internet Drafts\n   First things first.  Every document that ends up in the\
    \ RFC\n   repository starts life as an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are\n\
    \   tentative documents -- they're meant for readers to comment on, so\n   authors\
    \ can mull over those comments and decide which ones to\n   incorporate in the\
    \ draft.  In order to remind folks of their\n   tentativeness, Internet Drafts\
    \ are automatically removed from the\n   online directories after six months.\
    \  They are most definitely not\n   standards or even specifications.  As BCP\
    \ 9 says:\n      An Internet Draft is NOT a means of \"publishing\" a specification;\n\
    \      specifications are published through the RFC mechanism ...\n      Internet\
    \ Drafts have no formal status, and are subject to change\n      or removal at\

    \ understand the IETF (or is\n   intentionally trying to fool people) when they\
    \ brag about having\n   published an Internet Draft; it takes no significant effort.\n\
    \   An I-D should have approximately the same format as an RFC.  Contrary\n  \
    \ to many people's beliefs, an I-D does not need to look exactly like\n   an RFC,\
    \ but if you can use the same formatting procedures used by the\n   RFC Editor\
    \ when you create your I-Ds, it will simplify the RFC\n   Editor's work when your\
    \ draft is published as an RFC.  RFC 2223,\n   \"Instructions to RFC Authors,\"\

- title: 6.4 Standards-Track RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.4 Standards-Track RFCs\n   The procedure for creating and advancing a standard\
    \ is described in\n   BCP 9.  After an Internet Draft has been sufficiently discussed\
    \ and\n   there is rough consensus that what it says would be a useful\n   standard,\
    \ it is presented to the IESG for consideration.  If the\n   draft is an official\
    \ WG draft, the WG chair sends it to the\n   appropriate Area Director after it\
    \ has gone through Working Group\n   last call.  If the draft is an individual\
    \ submission, the draft's\n   author or editor submits it to the appropriate Area\
    \ Director.  BCP 9\n   also describes the appeals process for people who feel\
    \ that a Working\n   Group chair, an AD, or the IESG has made the wrong decision\
    \ in\n   considering the creation or advancement of a standard.\n   After it is\
    \ submitted to the IESG, the IESG announces an IETF-wide\n   last call.  This\
    \ helps get the attention of people who weren't\n   following the progress of\
    \ the draft, and can sometimes cause further\n   changes to the draft.  It is\
    \ also a time when people in the WG who\n   feel that they weren't heard can make\
    \ their comments to everyone.\n   The IETF last call is two weeks for drafts coming\
    \ from WGs and four\n   weeks for individual submissions.\n   If the IESG approves\
    \ the draft to become an Internet Standard, they\n   ask the RFC Editor to publish\
    \ it as a Proposed Standard.  After it\n   has been a Proposed Standard for at\
    \ least six months, the RFC's\n   author (or the appropriate WG chair) can ask\
    \ for it to become a Draft\n   Standard.  Before that happens, however, someone\
    \ needs to convince\n   the appropriate Area Director that there are at least\
    \ two\n   independent, interoperable implementations of each part of the\n   standard.\
    \  This is a good test of the usefulness of the standard as a\n   whole, as well\
    \ as an excellent way to check if the standard was\n   really readable.\n   A\
    \ few things typically happen at this point.  First, it's common to\n   find that\
    \ some of the specifications in the standard need to be\n   reworded because one\
    \ implementor thought they meant one thing while\n   another implementor thought\
    \ they meant something else.  Another\n   common occurrence is that none of the\
    \ implementations actually tried\n   to implement a few of the features of the\
    \ standard; these features\n   get removed not just because no one tested them,\
    \ but also because\n   they weren't needed.\n   Don't be surprised if a particular\
    \ standard doesn't progress from\n   Proposed to Draft.  In fact, most of the\
    \ standards in common use are\n   Proposed Standards and never move forward. \
    \ This may be because no\n   one took the time to try to get them to Draft, or\
    \ some of the\n   normative references in the standard are still at Proposed Standard,\n\
    \   or it may be that everyone found more important things to do.\n   A few years\
    \ after a document has been a Draft Standard, it can become\n   an Internet Standard,\
    \ also known as \"full standard.\"  This doesn't\n   happen often, and is usually\
    \ reserved for protocols that are\n   absolutely required for the Internet to\
    \ function.  The IESG goes over\n   the document with a fine-tooth comb before\
    \ making a Draft Standard an\n   Internet Standard.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.4.1 Telling It Like It Is -- Using MUST and SHOULD and MAY\n   Writing specifications\
    \ that get implemented the way you want is a bit\n   of an art.  You can keep\
    \ the specification very short, with just a\n   list of requirements, but that\
    \ tends to cause implementors to take\n   too much leeway.  If you instead make\
    \ the specification very wordy\n   with lots of suggestions, implementors tend\
    \ to miss the requirements\n   (and often disagree with your suggestions anyway).\
    \  An optimal\n   specification is somewhere in between.\n   One way to make it\
    \ more likely that developers will create\n   interoperable implementations of\
    \ standards is to be clear about\n   what's being mandated in a specification.\
    \  Early RFCs used all kinds\n   of expressions to explain what was needed, so\
    \ implementors didn't\n   always know which parts were suggestions and which were\
    \ requirements.\n   As a result, standards writers in the IETF generally agreed\
    \ to limit\n   their wording to a few specific words with a few specific meanings.\n\
    \   RFC 1123, \"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and\n   Support,\"\
    \ written way back in 1989, had a short list of words that\n   had appeared to\
    \ be useful, namely \"must\", \"should\", and \"may\".  These\n   definitions\
    \ were updated and further refined in BCP 14, \"Key words\n   for use in RFCs\
    \ to Indicate Requirement Levels,\" which is widely\n   referenced in current\
    \ Internet standards.  BCP 14 also specifically\n   defines \"must not\" and \"\
    should not\", and lists a few synonyms for the\n   words defined.\n   In a standard,\
    \ in order to make it clear that you're using the\n   definitions from BCP 14,\
    \ you should do two things.  First, refer to\n   BCP 14 (although most people\
    \ refer to it as RFC 2119, because that's\n   what BCP 14 tells you to do), so\
    \ that the reader knows how you're\n   defining your words.  Second, you should\
    \ point out which instances of\n   the words you are using come from BCP 14. \
    \ The accepted practice for\n   this is to capitalize the words.  That is why\
    \ you see \"MUST\" and\n   \"SHOULD\" capitalized in IETF standards.\n   BCP 14\
    \ is a short document, and should be read by everyone who is\n   reading or writing\
    \ IETF standards.  Although the definitions of\n   \"must\" and \"must not\" are\
    \ fairly clear, the definitions of \"should\"\n   and \"should not\" cause a great\
    \ deal of discussion in many WGs.  When\n   reviewing an Internet Draft, the question\
    \ is often raised, \"should\n   that sentence have a MUST or a SHOULD in it?\"\
    \  This is, indeed, a\n   very good question, because specifications shouldn't\
    \ have gratuitous\n   MUSTs, but also should not have SHOULDs where a MUST is\
    \ needed for\n   interoperability.  This goes to the crux of the question of over-\n\
    \   specifying and under-specifying requirements in standards.\n"
- title: 6.4.2 Normative References in Standards
  contents:
  - "6.4.2 Normative References in Standards\n   One aspect of writing IETF standards\
    \ that trips up many novices (and\n   quite a few long-time IETF folk) is the\
    \ rule about how to make\n   \"normative references\" to non-IETF documents or\
    \ to other RFCs in a\n   standard.  A normative reference is a reference to a\
    \ document that\n   must be followed in order to implement the standard.  A non-normative\n\
    \   reference is one that is helpful to an implementor but is not needed.\n  \
    \ As we noted above, a \"MUST\" specification would certainly be\n   normative,\
    \ so any reference needed to implement the \"MUST\" would be\n   normative.  A\
    \ \"SHOULD\" or \"MAY\" specification is not necessarily\n   normative, but it\
    \ could be normative based on what is being required.\n   There is definitely\
    \ room for debate here!\n   An IETF standard may make a normative reference to\
    \ any other\n   standards-track RFC that is at the same standards level or higher,\
    \ or\n   to any \"open standard\" that has been developed outside the IETF.  The\n\
    \   \"same level or higher\" rule means that before a standard can move\n   from\
    \ Proposed to Draft, all of the RFCs for which there is a\n   normative reference\
    \ must also be at Draft or Internet Standard.  This\n   rule gives implementors\
    \ assurance that everything in a Draft Standard\n   or Internet Standard is quite\
    \ stable, even the things referenced\n   outside the standard.  This can also\
    \ delay the publication of the\n   Draft or Internet Standard by many months (sometimes\
    \ even years)\n   while the other documents catch up.\n   There is no hard and\
    \ fast rule about what is an \"open standard,\" but\n   generally this means a\
    \ stable standard that anyone can get a copy of\n   (although they might have\
    \ to pay for it) and that was made by a\n   generally recognized standards group.\
    \  If the external standard\n   changes, you have to reference the particular\
    \ instantiation of that\n   standard in your specification, as with a designation\
    \ of the date of\n   the standard.  Some external standards bodies don't make\
    \ old\n   standards available, which is a problem for IETF standards that need\n\
    \   to be used in the future.  When in doubt, a draft author should ask\n   the\
    \ WG chair or appropriate Area Director if a particular external\n   standard\
    \ can be used in an IETF standard.\n"
- title: 6.4.3 IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.4.3 IANA Considerations\n   More and more IETF standards require the registration\
    \ of various\n   protocol parameters, such as named options in the protocol. \
    \ As we\n   noted in Section 1.2.4, the main registry for all IETF standards has\n\
    \   long been IANA.  Because of the large and diverse kinds of registries\n  \
    \ that standards require, IANA needs to have specific information about\n   how\
    \ to register parameters, what not to register, who (if anyone)\n   will decide\
    \ what is to be registered, and so on.\n   Anyone writing an Internet standard\
    \ that may need an IANA registry\n   needs to read BCP 26, \"Guidelines for Writing\
    \ an IANA Considerations\n   Section in RFCs,\" which describes how RFC authors\
    \ should properly ask\n   for IANA to start or take over a registry.  IANA also\

    \ vulnerabilities of\n   the protocol, possible threats, and mechanisms or strategies\
    \ to\n   address them.  Don't gloss over this section -- in particular, don't\n\
    \   say \"here's our protocol, if you want security, just use IPSEC\".\n   This\
    \ won't do at all, because it doesn't answer the question of how\n   IPSEC interacts\
    \ with your protocol, and vice versa.  Be sure to check\n   with your Working\
    \ Group chair if you're not sure how to handle this\n   section in your draft.\n"
- title: 6.4.5 Patents in IETF Standards
  contents:
  - "6.4.5 Patents in IETF Standards\n   The problems of intellectual property have\
    \ cropped up more and more\n   often in the past few years, particularly with\
    \ respect to patents.\n   The goal of the IETF is to have its standards widely\
    \ used and\n   validated in the marketplace.  If creating a product that uses\
    \ a\n   standard requires getting a license for a patent, people are less\n  \
    \ likely to implement the standard.  Not surprisingly, then, the\n   general rule\
    \ has been \"use good non-patented technology where\n   possible.\"\n   Of course,\
    \ this isn't always possible.  Sometimes patents appear\n   after a standard has\
    \ been established.  Sometimes there's a patent on\n   something that is so valuable\
    \ that there isn't a non-patented\n   equivalent.  Sometimes, the patent holder\
    \ is generous and promises to\n   give all implementors of a standard a royalty-free\
    \ license to the\n   patent, thereby making it almost as easy to implement as\
    \ it would\n   have been if no patent existed.\n   The IETF's methods for dealing\
    \ with patents in standards are a\n   subject of much debate.  You can read about\
    \ the official rules in BCP\n   9, but you should assume that the application\
    \ of those rules is\n   flexible and depends on the type of patent, the patent\
    \ holder, and\n   the availability of alternate technologies that are not encumbered\
    \ by\n   patents.\n   Patent holders who freely allow their patents to be used\
    \ by people\n   implementing IETF standards often get a great deal of good will\
    \ from\n   the folks in the IETF.  Such generosity is more common than you might\n\
    \   think.  For example, RFC 1822 is a license from IBM for one of its\n   security\
    \ patents, and the security community has responded very\n   favorably to IBM\
    \ for this (whereas a number of other companies have\n   made themselves pariahs\
    \ for their intractability on their security\n   patents).\n   If you are writing\
    \ an Internet Draft and you know of a patent that\n   applies to the technology\
    \ you're writing about, don't list the patent\n   in the document.  Instead, send\
    \ a note to the IETF Secretariat\n   (ietf-secretariat@ietf.org) about the patent\
    \ or other intellectual\n   property rights.  The note will be published on the\
    \ IETF IPR web page\n   (http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html).  Intellectual property\
    \ rights aren't\n   mentioned in RFCs because RFCs never change after they are\
    \ published,\n   but knowledge of IPR can change at any time.  Therefore, an IPR\
    \ list\n   in a RFC could be incomplete and mislead the reader.  BCP 9 provides\n\
    \   specific text that should be added to RFCs where the author knows of\n   IPR\
    \ issues.\n"
- title: 6.5 Informational and Experimental RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.5 Informational and Experimental RFCs\n   As we noted earlier, not all RFCs\
    \ are standards.  In fact, plenty of\n   important RFCs are not on the standards\
    \ track at all.  Currently,\n   there are two designations for RFCs that are not\
    \ meant to be\n   standards:  Informational, like the Tao, and Experimental. \
    \ (There is\n   actually a third designation, Historical, but that is reserved\
    \ for\n   documents that were on the standards track and have been removed due\n\
    \   to lack of current use, or that more recent thinking indicates the\n   technology\
    \ is actually harmful to the Internet.)\n   The role of Informational RFCs is\
    \ often debated in the IETF.  Many\n   people like having them, particularly for\
    \ specifications that were\n   created outside the IETF but are referenced by\
    \ IETF documents.  They\n   are also useful for specifications that are the precursors\
    \ for work\n   being done by IETF Working Groups.  On the other hand, some people\n\
    \   refer to Informational RFCs as \"standards\" even though the RFCs are\n  \
    \ not standards, usually to fool the gullible public about something\n   that\
    \ the person is selling or supporting.  When this happens, the\n   debate about\
    \ Informational RFCs is renewed.\n   Experimental RFCs are for specifications\
    \ that may be interesting, but\n   for which it is unclear if there will be much\
    \ interest in\n   implementing them.  That is, a specification might solve a problem,\n\
    \   but if it is not clear many people think that the problem is\n   important,\
    \ or think that they will bother fixing the problem with the\n   specification,\
    \ the specification might be labeled an Experimental\n   RFC.  If, later, the\
    \ specification becomes popular, it can be re-\n   issued as a standards-track\
    \ RFC.  Experimental RFCs are also used to\n   get people to experiment with a\

    \ the status of Internet Drafts, quotes from people\n   who are unrelated to the\
    \ IETF work, and so on.\n   Major press errors fall into two categories: saying\
    \ that the IETF is\n   considering something when in fact there is just an Internet\
    \ Draft in\n   a Working Group, and saying that the IETF approved something when\
    \ all\n   that happened was that an Informational RFC was published.  In both\n\
    \   cases, the press is not fully to blame for the problem, since they\n   are\
    \ usually alerted to the story by a company trying to get publicity\n   for a\
    \ protocol that they developed or at least support.  Of course, a\n   bit of research\
    \ by the reporter would probably get them in contact\n   with someone who could\
    \ straighten them out, such as a WG chair or an\n   Area Director.  The official\
    \ press contact for the IETF is the IETF\n   Secretariat.\n   The fact that those\
    \ reporters who've gotten it wrong once come back\n   to IETF meetings shows that\
    \ it is possible to get it right\n   eventually.  However, IETF meetings are definitely\
    \ not for reporters\n   who are naive about the IETF process (although if you\
    \ are a reporter\n   the fact that you are reading this document is a very good\
    \ sign!).\n   Further, if you think that you'll get a hot story from attending\
    \ an\n   IETF meeting, you are likely to be disappointed.\n   Considering all\
    \ this, it's not surprising that some IETFers would\n   prefer to have the press\
    \ stay as far away from meetings as possible.\n   Having a bit of press publicity\
    \ for protocols that are almost near\n   completion and will become significant\
    \ in the industry in the next\n   year can be a good thing.  However, it is the\
    \ rare reporter who can\n   resist over-hyping a nascent protocol as the next\
    \ savior for the\n   Internet.  Such stories do much more harm than good, both\
    \ for the\n   readers of the article and for the IETF.\n   The main reason why\
    \ a reporter might want to attend an IETF meeting\n   is not to cover hot technologies\
    \ (since that can be done in the\n   comfort of your office by reading the mailing\
    \ lists), but to meet\n   people face to face.  Unfortunately, the most interesting\
    \ people are\n   the ones who are also the busiest during the IETF meeting, and\
    \ some\n   folks have a tendency to run away when they see a press badge.\n  \
    \ However, IETF meetings are excellent places to meet and speak with\n   document\
    \ authors and Working Group chairs; this can be quite valuable\n   for reporters\
    \ who are covering the progress of protocols.\n   Reporters who want to find out\
    \ about \"what the IETF is doing\" on a\n   particular topic would be well-advised\
    \ to talk to more than one\n   person who is active on that topic in the IETF,\
    \ and should probably\n   try to talk to the WG chair in any case.  It's impossible\
    \ to\n   determine what will happen with a draft by looking at the draft or\n\
    \   talking to the draft's author.  Fortunately, all WGs have archives\n   that\
    \ a reporter can look through for recent indications about what\n   the progress\
    \ of a draft is; unfortunately, few reporters have the\n   time or inclination\
    \ to do this kind of research.  Because the IETF\n   doesn't have a press liaison,\
    \ a magazine or newspaper that runs a\n   story with errors won't hear directly\
    \ from the IETF and therefore\n   often won't know what they did wrong, so they\
    \ might easily do it\n   again later.\n"
