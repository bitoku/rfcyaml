  - "Abstract\n   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) defines a new Mobility header that is used by\n\
    \   mobile nodes, correspondent nodes, and home agents in all messaging\n   related\
    \ to the creation and management of bindings.  Mobile IPv6\n   nodes need the\
    \ capability to identify themselves using an identity\n   other than the default\
    \ home IP address.  Some examples of identifiers\n   include Network Access Identifier\
    \ (NAI), Fully Qualified Domain Name\n   (FQDN), International Mobile Station\
    \ Identifier (IMSI), and Mobile\n   Subscriber Number (MSISDN).  This document\
    \ defines a new mobility\n   option that can be used by Mobile IPv6 entities to\
    \ identify\n   themselves in messages containing a mobility header.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base specification of Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] identifies\
    \ mobility\n   entities using an IPv6 address.  It is essential to have a mechanism\n\
    \   wherein mobility entities can be identified using other identifiers\n   (for\
    \ example, a Network Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282],\n   International Mobile\
    \ Station Identifier (IMSI), or an application/\n   deployment specific opaque\
    \ identifier).\n   The capability to identify a mobility entity via identifiers\
    \ other\n   than the IPv6 address can be leveraged for performing various\n  \
    \ functions, for example,\n   o  authentication and authorization using an existing\
    \ AAA\n      (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) infrastructure or\n\
    \      via an HLR/AuC (Home Location Register/Authentication Center)\n   o  dynamic\
    \ allocation of a mobility anchor point\n   o  dynamic allocation of a home address\n\
    \   This document defines an option with a subtype number that denotes a\n   specific\
    \ type of identifier.  One instance of subtype, the NAI, is\n   defined in Section\
    \ 3.1.  It is anticipated that other identifiers\n   will be defined for use in\
    \ the mobility header in the future.\n   This option SHOULD be used when Internet\
    \ Key Exchange (IKE)/IPsec is\n   not used for protecting binding updates or binding\
    \ acknowledgements\n   as specified in [RFC3775].  It is typically used with the\n\
    \   authentication option [RFC4285].  But this option may be used\n   independently.\
    \  For example, the identifier can provide accounting\n   and billing services.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Mobile Node Identifier Option\n   The Mobile Node Identifier option is a\
    \ new optional data field that\n   is carried in the Mobile IPv6-defined messages\
    \ that includes the\n   Mobility header.  Various forms of identifiers can be\
    \ used to\n   identify a Mobile Node (MN).  Two examples are a Network Access\n\
    \   Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282] and an opaque identifier applicable to a\n   particular\
    \ application.  The Subtype field in the option defines the\n   specific type\
    \ of identifier.\n   This option can be used in mobility messages containing a\
    \ mobility\n   header.  The subtype field in the option is used to interpret the\n\
    \   specific type of identifier.\n       0                   1               \

- title: 3.1.  MN-NAI Mobility Option
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MN-NAI Mobility Option\n   The MN-NAI mobility option uses the general\
    \ format of the Mobile Node\n   Identifier option as defined in Section 3.  This\
    \ option uses the\n   subtype value of 1.  The MN-NAI mobility option is used\
    \ to identify\n   the mobile node.\n   The MN-NAI mobility option uses an identifier\
    \ of the form user@realm\n   [RFC4282].  This option MUST be implemented by the\
    \ entities\n   implementing this specification.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Processing Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Processing Considerations\n   The location of the MN Identifier option\
    \ is as follows: When present,\n   this option MUST appear before any authentication-related\
    \ option in a\n   message containing a Mobility header.\n"

- title: 4.1.  General Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Considerations\n   Mobile IPv6 already contains one mechanism for\
    \ identifying mobile\n   nodes, the Home Address option [RFC3775].  As a result,\
    \ the\n   vulnerabilities of the new option defined in this document are\n   similar\
    \ to those that already exist for Mobile IPv6.  In particular,\n   the use of\
    \ a permanent, stable identifier may compromise the privacy\n   of the user, making\
    \ it possible to track a particular device or user\n   as it moves through different\
    \ locations.\n"
- title: 4.2.  MN-NAI Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2.  MN-NAI Considerations\n   Since the Mobile Node Identifier option described\
    \ in Section 3\n   reveals the home affiliation of a user, it may assist an attacker\
    \ in\n   determining the identity of the user, help the attacker in targeting\n\
    \   specific victims, or assist in further probing of the username space.\n  \
    \ These vulnerabilities can be addressed through various mechanisms,\n   such\
    \ as those discussed below:\n   o  Encrypting traffic at the link layer, such\
    \ that other users on the\n      same link do not see the identifiers.  This mechanism\
    \ does not\n      help against attackers on the rest of the path between the mobile\n\
    \      node and its home agent.\n   o  Encrypting the whole packet, such as when\
    \ using IPsec to protect\n      the communications with the home agent [RFC3776].\n\
    \   o  Using an authentication mechanism that enables the use of privacy\n   \
    \   NAIs [RFC4282] or temporary, changing \"pseudonyms\" as identifiers.\n   In\
    \ any case, it should be noted that as the identifier option is only\n   needed\
    \ on the first registration at the home agent and subsequent\n   registrations\
    \ can use the home address, the window of privacy\n   vulnerability in this document\
    \ is reduced as compared to [RFC3775].\n   In addition, this document is a part\
    \ of a solution to allow dynamic\n   home addresses to be used.  This is an improvement\
    \ to privacy as\n   well, and it affects both communications with the home agent\
    \ and the\n   correspondent nodes, both of which have to be told the home address.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   The values for new mobility options must be assigned\
    \ from the Mobile\n   IPv6 [RFC3775] numbering space.\n   The IANA has assigned\
    \ the value 8 for the MN-ID-OPTION-TYPE.\n   In addition, IANA has created a new\
    \ namespace for the subtype field\n   of the Mobile Node Identifier option.  The\
    \ currently allocated values\n   are as follows:\n   NAI (defined in [RFC4282]).\n\
    \   New values for this namespace can be allocated using Standards Action\n  \
    \ [RFC2434].\n"
