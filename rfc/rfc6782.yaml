  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or\n\
    \   deploying IPv6 in their networks.  These operators often face\n   difficult\
    \ challenges related to IPv6 introduction, along with those\n   related to IPv4\
    \ run-out.  Operators will need to meet the\n   simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity\
    \ and continue support for IPv4\n   connectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant\
    \ supply of IPv4\n   addresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from\
    \ an IPv4-\n   only environment to an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition\n\
    \   periods varying by operator.  This document helps provide a framework\n  \
    \ for wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of\n   introducing\
    \ IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4\n   connectivity, utilizing\
    \ well-defined and commercially available IPv6\n   transition technologies.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document sets out to help wireline operators in planning\
    \ their\n   IPv6 deployments while ensuring continued support for IPv6-incapable\n\
    \   consumer devices and applications.  This document identifies which\n   technologies\
    \ can be used incrementally to transition from IPv4-only\n   to an IPv6-dominant\
    \ environment with support for Dual Stack\n   operation.  The end state or goal\
    \ for most operators will be\n   IPv6-only, but the path to this final state will\
    \ depend heavily on\n   the amount of legacy equipment resident in end networks\
    \ and\n   management of long-tail IPv4-only content.  Although no single plan\n\
    \   will work for all operators, options listed herein provide a baseline\n  \
    \ that can be included in many plans.\n   This document is intended for wireline\
    \ environments that include\n   cable, DSL, and/or fiber as the access method\
    \ to the end consumer.\n   This document attempts to follow the principles laid\
    \ out in\n   [RFC6180], which provides guidance on using IPv6 transition\n   mechanisms.\
    \  This document will focus on technologies that enable and\n   mature IPv6 within\
    \ the operator's network, but it will also include a\n   cursory view of IPv4\
    \ connectivity continuance.  This document will\n   focus on transition technologies\
    \ that are readily available in\n   off-the-shelf Customer Premises Equipment\
    \ (CPE) devices and\n   commercially available network equipment.\n"
- title: 2.  Operator Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2.  Operator Assumptions\n   For the purposes of this document, the authors assume\
    \ the following:\n   -  The operator is considering deploying IPv6 or is in the\
    \ process of\n      deploying IPv6.\n   -  The operator has a legacy IPv4 subscriber\
    \ base that will continue\n      to exist for a period of time.\n   -  The operator\
    \ will want to minimize the level of disruption to the\n      existing and new\
    \ subscribers.\n   -  The operator may also want to minimize the number of technologies\n\
    \      and functions that are needed to mediate any given set of\n      subscribers'\
    \ flows (overall preference for native IP flows).\n   -  The operator is able\
    \ to run Dual Stack in its own core network and\n      is able to transition its\
    \ own services to support IPv6.\n   Based on these assumptions, an operator will\
    \ want to utilize\n   technologies that minimize the need to tunnel, translate,\
    \ or mediate\n   flows to help optimize traffic flow and lower the cost impacts\
    \ of\n   transition technologies.  Transition technology selections should be\n\
    \   made to mediate the non-dominant IP family flows and allow native\n   routing\
    \ (IPv4 and/or IPv6) to forward the dominant traffic whenever\n   possible.  This\
    \ allows the operator to minimize the cost of IPv6\n   transition technologies\
    \ by minimizing the transition technology\n   deployment size.\n   An operator\
    \ may also choose to prefer more IPv6-focused models where\n   the use of transition\
    \ technologies is based on an effort to enable\n   IPv6 at the base layer as soon\
    \ as possible.  Some operators may want\n   to promote IPv6 early on in the deployment\
    \ and have IPv6 traffic\n   perform optimally from the outset.  This desire would\
    \ need to be\n   weighed against the cost and support impacts of such a choice\
    \ and the\n   quality of experience offered to subscribers.\n"
- title: 3.  Reasons and Considerations for a Phased Approach
  contents:
  - "3.  Reasons and Considerations for a Phased Approach\n   When faced with the\
    \ challenges described in the introduction,\n   operators may want to consider\
    \ a phased approach when adding IPv6 to\n   an existing subscriber base.  A phased\
    \ approach allows the operator\n   to add in IPv6 while not ignoring legacy IPv4\
    \ connection\n   requirements.  Some of the main challenges the operator will\
    \ face\n   include the following:\n   -  IPv4 exhaustion may occur long before\
    \ all traffic is able to be\n      delivered over IPv6, necessitating IPv4 address\
    \ sharing.\n   -  IPv6 will pose operational challenges, since some of the software\n\
    \      is quite new and has had short run time in large production\n      environments\
    \ and organizations are also not acclimatized to\n      supporting IPv6 as a service.\n\
    \   -  Connectivity modes will move from IPv4-only to Dual Stack in the\n    \
    \  home, changing functional behaviors in the consumer network and\n      increasing\
    \ support requirements for the operator.\n   -  Although IPv6 support on CPEs\
    \ is a newer phenomenon, there is a\n      strong push by operators and the industry\
    \ as a whole to enable\n      IPv6 on devices.  As demand grows, IPv6 enablement\
    \ will no longer\n      be optional but will be necessary on CPEs.  Documents\
    \ like\n      [RFC6540] provide useful tools in the short term to help vendors\n\
    \      and implementors understand what \"IPv6 support\" means.\n   These challenges\
    \ will occur over a period of time, which means that\n   the operator's plans\
    \ need to address the ever-changing requirements\n   of the network and subscriber\
    \ demand.  Although phases will be\n   presented in this document, not all operators\
    \ may need to enable each\n   discrete phase.  It is possible that characteristics\
    \ in individual\n   networks may allow certain operators to skip or jump to various\n\
    \   phases.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Relevance of IPv6 and IPv4
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Relevance of IPv6 and IPv4\n   The delivery of high-quality unencumbered\
    \ Internet service should be\n   the primary goal for operators.  With the imminent\
    \ exhaustion of\n   IPv4, IPv6 will offer the highest quality of experience in\
    \ the long\n   term.  Even though the operator may be focused on IPv6 delivery,\
    \ it\n   should be aware that both IPv4 and IPv6 will play a role in the\n   Internet\
    \ experience during transition.  The Internet is made of many\n   interconnecting\
    \ systems, networks, hardware, software, and content\n   sources -- all of which\
    \ will support IPv6 at different rates.\n   Many subscribers use older operating\
    \ systems and hardware that\n   support IPv4-only operation.  Internet subscribers\
    \ don't buy IPv4 or\n   IPv6 connections; they buy Internet connections, which\
    \ demand the\n   need to support both IPv4 and IPv6 for as long as the subscriber's\n\
    \   home network demands such support.  The operator may be able to\n   leverage\
    \ one or the other protocol to help bridge connectivity on the\n   operator's\
    \ network, but the home network will likely demand both IPv4\n   and IPv6 for\
    \ some time.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IPv4 Resource Challenges
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IPv4 Resource Challenges\n   Since connectivity to IPv4-only endpoints\
    \ and/or content will remain\n   common, IPv4 resource challenges are of key concern\
    \ to operators.\n   The lack of new IPv4 addresses for additional devices means\
    \ that\n   meeting the growth in demand of IPv4 connections in some networks\n\
    \   will require address sharing.\n   Networks are growing at different rates,\
    \ including those in emerging\n   markets and established networks based on the\
    \ proliferation of\n   Internet-based services and devices.  IPv4 address constraints\
    \ will\n   likely affect many, if not most, operators at some point, increasing\n\
    \   the benefits of IPv6.  IPv4 address exhaustion is a consideration\n   when\
    \ selecting technologies that rely on IPv4 to supply IPv6\n   services, such as\
    \ 6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures)\n   [RFC5969].  Additionally,\
    \ if native Dual Stack is considered by the\n   operator, challenges related to\
    \ IPv4 address exhaustion remain a\n   concern.\n   Some operators may be able\
    \ to reclaim small amounts of IPv4 addresses\n   through addressing efficiencies\
    \ in the network, although this will\n   have few lasting benefits to the network\
    \ and will not meet longer-\n   term connectivity needs.  Secondary markets for\
    \ IPv4 addresses have\n   also begun to arise, but it's not well understood how\
    \ this will\n   complement overall demand for Internet growth.  Address transfers\n\
    \   will also be subject to market prices and transfer rules governed by\n   the\
    \ Regional Registries.\n   The lack of new global IPv4 address allocations will\
    \ therefore force\n   operators to support some form of IPv4 address sharing and\
    \ may impact\n   technological options for transition once the operator runs out\
    \ of\n   new IPv4 addresses for assignment.\n"
- title: 3.3.  IPv6 Introduction and Operational Maturity
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IPv6 Introduction and Operational Maturity\n   The introduction of IPv6\
    \ will require new operational practices.  The\n   IPv4 environment we have today\
    \ was built over many years and matured\n   by experience.  Although many of these\
    \ experiences are transferable\n   from IPv4 to IPv6, new experience and practices\
    \ specific to IPv6 will\n   be needed.\n   Engineering and operational staff will\
    \ need to develop experience\n   with IPv6.  Inexperience may lead to early IPv6\
    \ deployment\n   instability, and operators should consider this when selecting\n\
    \   technologies for initial transition.  Operators may not want to\n   subject\
    \ their mature IPv4 service to a \"new IPv6\" path initially\n   while it may\
    \ be going through growing pains.  Dual Stack Lite\n   (DS-Lite) [RFC6333] and\
    \ NAT64 [RFC6146] are both technologies that\n   require IPv6 to support connectivity\
    \ to IPv4 endpoints or content\n   over an IPv6-only access network.\n   Further,\
    \ some of these transition technologies are new and require\n   refinement within\
    \ running code.  Deployment experience is required to\n   expose bugs and stabilize\
    \ software in production environments.  Many\n   supporting systems are also under\
    \ development and have newly\n   developed IPv6 functionality, including vendor\
    \ implementations of\n   DHCPv6, management tools, monitoring systems, diagnostic\
    \ systems, and\n   logging, along with other elements.\n   Although the base technological\
    \ capabilities exist to enable and run\n   IPv6 in most environments, organizational\
    \ experience is low.  Until\n   such time as each key technical member of an operator's\
    \ organization\n   can identify IPv6 and can understand its relevance to the IP\
    \ service\n   offering, how it operates, and how to troubleshoot it, the deployment\n\
    \   needs to mature and may be subject to events that impact subscribers.\n  \
    \ This fact should not incline operators to delay their IPv6 deployment\n   but\
    \ should drive them to deploy IPv6 sooner, to gain much-needed\n   experience\
    \ before IPv6 is the only viable way to connect new hosts to\n   the network.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that although many transition technologies\n   may\
    \ be new, and some code related to access environments may be new,\n   there is\
    \ a large segment of the networking fabric that has had IPv6\n   available for\
    \ a long period of time and has had extended exposure in\n   production.  Operators\
    \ may use this to their advantage by first\n   enabling IPv6 in the core network\
    \ and then working outward towards\n   the subscriber edge.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Service Management
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Service Management\n   Services are managed within most networks and are\
    \ often based on the\n   gleaning and monitoring of IPv4 addresses assigned to\
    \ endpoints.\n   Operators will need to address such management tools, troubleshooting\n\
    \   methods, and storage facilities (such as databases) to deal with not\n   only\
    \ new address types containing 128-bit IPv6 addresses [RFC2460]\n   but often\
    \ both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.  Examination of\n   address types, and\
    \ recording delegated prefixes along with single\n   address assignments, will\
    \ likely require additional development.\n   With any Dual Stack service -- whether\
    \ native, 6rd-based, DS-Lite,\n   NAT64, or some other service -- two address\
    \ families may need to be\n   managed simultaneously to help provide the full\
    \ Internet experience.\n   This would indicate that IPv6 management is not just\
    \ a simple add-in\n   but needs to be well integrated into the service management\n\
    \   infrastructure.  In the early transition phases, it's quite likely\n   that\
    \ many systems will be missed, and that IPv6 services will go\n   unmonitored\
    \ and impairments will go undetected.\n   These issues may be worthy of consideration\
    \ when selecting\n   technologies that require IPv6 as the base protocol to deliver\
    \ IPv4\n   connectivity.  Instability of the IPv6 service in such a case would\n\
    \   impact IPv4 services.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Suboptimal Operation of Transition Technologies
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Suboptimal Operation of Transition Technologies\n   Native delivery of\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 provides a solid foundation for\n   delivery of Internet services\
    \ to subscribers, since native IP paths\n   are well understood and networks are\
    \ often optimized to send such\n   traffic efficiently.  Transition technologies,\
    \ however, may alter the\n   normal path of traffic or reduce the path MTU, removing\
    \ many network\n   efficiencies built for native IP flows.  Tunneling and translation\n\
    \   devices may not be located on the most optimal path in line with the\n   natural\
    \ traffic flow (based on route computation) and therefore may\n   increase latency.\
    \  These paths may also introduce additional points\n   of failure.\n   Generally,\
    \ the operator will want to deliver native IPv6 as soon as\n   possible and utilize\
    \ transition technologies only when required.\n   Transition technologies may\
    \ be used to provide continued access to\n   IPv4 via tunneling and/or translation\
    \ or may be used to deliver IPv6\n   connectivity.  The delivery of Internet or\
    \ internal services should\n   be considered by the operator, since supplying\
    \ connections using a\n   transition technology will reduce overall performance\
    \ for the\n   subscriber.\n   When choosing between various transition technologies,\
    \ operators\n   should consider the benefits and drawbacks of each option.  Some\n\
    \   technologies, like Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)/NAT444, utilize many\n   existing\
    \ addressing and management practices.  Other options, such as\n   DS-Lite and\
    \ NAT64, remove the IPv4 addressing requirement to the\n   subscriber premises\
    \ device but require IPv6 to be operational and\n   well supported.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Future IPv6 Network
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Future IPv6 Network\n   An operator should also be aware that longer-term\
    \ plans may include\n   IPv6-only operation in all or much of the network.  The\
    \ IPv6-only\n   operation may be complemented by technologies such as NAT64 for\
    \ long-\n   tail IPv4 content reach.  This longer-term view may be distant to\n\
    \   some but should be considered when planning out networks, addressing,\n  \
    \ and services.  The needs and costs of maintaining two IP stacks will\n   eventually\
    \ become burdensome, and simplification will be desirable.\n   Operators should\
    \ plan for this state and not make IPv6 inherently\n   dependent on IPv4, as this\
    \ would unnecessarily constrain the network.\n   Other design considerations and\
    \ guidelines for running an IPv6\n   network should also be considered by the\
    \ operator.  Guidance on\n   designing an IPv6 network can be found in [IPv6-DESIGN]\

- title: 4.1.  Automatic Tunneling Using 6to4 and Teredo
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Automatic Tunneling Using 6to4 and Teredo\n   Even when operators may not\
    \ be actively deploying IPv6, automatic\n   mechanisms exist on subscriber operating\
    \ systems and CPE hardware.\n   Such technologies include 6to4 [RFC3056], which\
    \ is most commonly used\n   with anycast relays [RFC3068].  Teredo [RFC4380] is\
    \ also used widely\n   by many Internet hosts.\n   Documents such as [RFC6343]\
    \ have been written to help operators\n   understand observed problems with 6to4\
    \ deployments and provide\n   guidelines on how to improve their performance.\
    \  An operator may want\n   to provide local relays for 6to4 and/or Teredo to\
    \ help improve the\n   protocol's performance for ambient traffic utilizing these\
    \ IPv6\n   connectivity methods.  Experiences such as those described in\n   [COMCAST-IPv6-EXPERIENCES]\
    \ show that local relays have proved\n   beneficial to 6to4 protocol performance.\n\
    \   Operators should also be aware of breakage cases for 6to4 if\n   non-[RFC1918]\
    \ addresses are used within CGN/NAT444 zones.  Many\n   off-the-shelf CPEs and\

    \ [RFC1918] is used,\n   including Shared Address Space [RFC6598] or space registered\
    \ to\n   another organization (squat space).  The operator can use 6to4\n   Provider\
    \ Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) [RFC6732] or attempt to block\n   6to4 operation\
    \ entirely by blocking the anycast ranges associated\n   with [RFC3068].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  6rd\n   6rd [RFC5969] provides a way of offering IPv6 connectivity to\n\
    \   subscriber endpoints when native IPv6 addressing on the access\n   network\
    \ is not yet possible.  6rd provides tunneled connectivity for\n   IPv6 over the\
    \ existing IPv4 path.  As the access edge is upgraded and\n   subscriber premises\
    \ equipment is replaced, 6rd can be replaced by\n   native IPv6 connectivity.\
    \  6rd can be delivered on top of a CGN/\n   NAT444 deployment, but this would\
    \ cause all traffic to be subject to\n   some type of transition technology.\n\
    \   6rd may also be advantageous during the early transition period while\n  \
    \ IPv6 traffic volumes are low.  During this period, the operator can\n   gain\
    \ experience with IPv6 in the core network and improve the\n   operator's peering\
    \ framework to match those of the IPv4 service.  6rd\n   scales by adding relays\
    \ to the operator's network.  Another advantage\n   of 6rd is that the operator\
    \ does not need a DHCPv6 address assignment\n   infrastructure and does not need\
    \ to support IPv6 routing to the CPE\n   to support a delegated prefix (as it's\
    \ derived from the IPv4 address\n   and other configuration parameters).\n   Client\
    \ support is required for 6rd operation and may not be available\n   on deployed\
    \ hardware.  6rd deployments may require the subscriber or\n   operator to replace\
    \ the CPE.  6rd will also require parameter\n   configuration that can be powered\
    \ by the operator through DHCPv4,\n   manually provisioned on the CPE, or automatically\
    \ provisioned through\n   some other means.  Manual provisioning would likely\
    \ limit deployment\n   scale.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Native Dual Stack\n   Native Dual Stack is often referred to as the \"\
    gold standard\" of IPv6\n   and IPv4 delivery.  It is a method of service delivery\
    \ that is\n   already used in many existing IPv6 deployments.  Native Dual Stack\n\
    \   does, however, require that native IPv6 be delivered through the\n   access\

    \ in many cases and can be used immediately if the access\n   network and subscriber\
    \ premises equipment support native IPv6.\n   An operator who runs out of IPv4\
    \ addresses to assign to subscribers\n   will not be able to provide traditional\
    \ native Dual Stack\n   connectivity for new subscribers.  In Dual Stack deployments\
    \ where\n   sufficient IPv4 addresses are not available, CGN/NAT444 can be used\n\
    \   on the IPv4 path.\n   Delivering native Dual Stack would require the operator's\

  contents:
  - "4.5.  DS-Lite\n   DS-Lite [RFC6333] is based on a native IPv6 connection model\
    \ where\n   IPv4 services are supported.  DS-Lite provides tunneled connectivity\n\
    \   for IPv4 over the IPv6 path between the subscriber's network device\n   and\
    \ a provider-managed gateway (Address Family Transition Router\n   (AFTR)).\n\
    \   DS-Lite can only be used where there is a native IPv6 connection\n   between\
    \ the AFTR and the CPE.  This may mean that the technology's\n   use may not be\
    \ viable during early transition if the core or access\n   network lacks IPv6\
    \ support.  During the early transition period, a\n   significant amount of content\
    \ and services may by IPv4-only.\n   Operators may be sensitive to this and may\
    \ not want the newer IPv6\n   path to be the only bridge to IPv4 at that time,\
    \ given the potential\n   impact.  The operator may also want to make sure that\
    \ most of its\n   internal services and a significant amount of external content\
    \ are\n   available over IPv6 before deploying DS-Lite.  The availability of\n\
    \   services on IPv6 would help lower the demand on the AFTRs.\n   By sharing\
    \ IPv4 addresses among multiple endpoints, like CGN/NAT444,\n   DS-Lite can facilitate\
    \ continued support of legacy IPv4 services even\n   after IPv4 address run-out.\
    \  There are some functional considerations\n   to take into account with DS-Lite,\
    \ such as those described in\n   [NAT444-IMPACTS] and in [DSLITE-DEPLOYMENT].\n\
    \   DS-Lite requires client support on the CPE to function.  The ability\n   to\

    \  During\n   this period of time, tunneled access to IPv6 is a viable alternative\n\
    \   to native IPv6.  It is also possible that operators may be rolling\n   out\
    \ IPv6 natively to the subscriber edge, but the time involved may\n   be long,\
    \ due to logistics and other factors.  Even while carefully\n   rolling out native\
    \ IPv6, operators can deploy relays for automatic\n   tunneling technologies like\
    \ 6to4 and Teredo.  Where native IPv6 to\n   the access edge is a longer-term\
    \ project, operators can consider 6rd\n   [RFC5969] as an option to offer in-home\

- title: 5.2.1.  6rd Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  6rd Deployment Considerations\n   Deploying 6rd can greatly speed up\
    \ an operator's ability to support\n   IPv6 to the subscriber network if native\
    \ IPv6 connectivity cannot be\n   supplied.  The speed at which 6rd can be deployed\
    \ is highlighted in\n   [RFC5569].\n   The first core consideration is deployment\
    \ models.  6rd requires the\n   CPE (6rd client) to send traffic to a 6rd relay.\
    \  These relays can\n   share a common anycast address or can use unique addresses.\
    \  Using an\n   anycast model, the operator can deploy all the 6rd relays using\
    \ the\n   same IPv4 interior service address.  As the load increases on the\n\
    \   deployed relays, the operator can deploy more relays into the\n   network.\
    \  The one drawback is that it may be difficult to manage the\n   traffic volume\
    \ among additional relays, since all 6rd traffic will\n   find the nearest (in\
    \ terms of IGP cost) relay.  The use of multiple\n   relay addresses can help\
    \ provide more control but has the\n   disadvantage of being more complex to provision.\
    \  Subsets of CPEs\n   across the network will require and contain different relay\n\
    \   information.  An alternative approach is to use a hybrid model using\n   multiple\
    \ anycast service IP addresses for clusters of 6rd relays,\n   should the operator\
    \ anticipate massive scaling of the environment.\n   Thus, the operator has multiple\

  - "5.5.3.  NAT64 Deployment Considerations\n   The deployment of NAT64 assumes that\
    \ the network assigns an IPv6\n   address to a network endpoint that is translated\
    \ to an IPv4 address\n   to provide connectivity to IPv4 Internet services and\
    \ content.\n   Experiments such as the one described in [RFC6586] highlight issues\n\
    \   related to IPv6-only deployments due to legacy IPv4 APIs and IPv4\n   literals.\
    \  Many of these issues will be resolved by the eventual\n   removal of this undesirable\
    \ legacy behavior.  Operational deployment\n   models, considerations, and experiences\
    \ related to NAT64 have been\n   documented in [NAT64-EXPERIENCE].\n         \

    \       Figure 10: NAT64/DNS64 Basic Model\n   To navigate some of the limitations\
    \ of NAT64 when dealing with legacy\n   IPv4 applications, the operator may choose\
    \ to implement 464XLAT\n   [464XLAT] if possible.  As support for IPv6 on subscriber\
    \ equipment\n   and content increases, the efficiency of NAT64 increases by reducing\n\
    \   the need to translate traffic.  NAT64 deployments would see an\n   overall\
    \ decline in translator usage as more traffic is promoted to\n   IPv6-to-IPv6\
    \ native communication.  NAT64 may play an important part\n   in an operator's\
    \ late-stage transition, as it removes the need to\n   support IPv4 on the access\
    \ network and provides a solid go-forward\n   networking model.\n   It should\
    \ be noted, as with any technology that utilizes address\n   sharing, that the\
    \ IPv4 public pool sizes (IPv4 transport addresses\n   per [RFC6146]) can pose\
    \ limits to IPv4 server connectivity for the\n   subscriber base.  Operators should\
    \ be aware that some IPv4 growth in\n   the near term is possible, so IPv4 translation\
    \ pools need to be\n   monitored.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Operators should review the documentation related\
    \ to the technologies\n   selected for IPv6 transition.  In those reviews, operators\
    \ should\n   understand what security considerations are applicable to the chosen\n\
    \   technologies.  As an example, [RFC6169] should be reviewed to\n   understand\
    \ security considerations related to tunneling technologies.\n"
