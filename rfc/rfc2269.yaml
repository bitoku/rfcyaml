- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Initially developed for IP over ATM, the RFC 2022 (MARS) model is\n\
    \   also applicable to other NBMA networks that provide the equivalent of\n  \
    \ switched, point to multipoint connections. This short document is\n   intended\
    \ to state the obvious equivalences, and explain the less\n   obvious implications.\
    \ No changes to the MARS model per se are\n   suggested or required. RFC 2022\
    \ is not required over NBMA networks\n   that offer Ethernet-like group addressing\
    \ functionality.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Most network layer models, like the one described in STD\
    \ 5, RFC 1112\n   [1] for IP multicasting, assume sources may send their packets\
    \ to an\n   abstract 'multicast group addresses'.  Link layer support for such\
    \ an\n   abstraction is assumed to exist, and is provided by technologies such\n\
    \   as Ethernet.\n   Some NBMA networks (e.g. ATM using UNI3.0 or UNI3.1 signaling\
    \ [4,5])\n   do not support a multicast (or group) address abstraction. In these\n\
    \   environments multicasting is typically supported through point to\n   multipoint\
    \ calls (or emulated with multiple point to point calls).\n   The MARS model (RFC\
    \ 2022) [2] was originally developed by the IP over\n   ATM working group, and\
    \ so uses ATM-centric descriptive language.  For\n   completeness this memo explains\
    \ how RFC 2022 can be applied to other\n   NBMA technologies.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC 2022's basic assumptions.
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC 2022's basic assumptions.\n   Section 3 of [2] describes the basic assumptions\
    \ that the MARS model\n   makes about the services available from the link layer\
    \ network (using\n   ATM as the specific case).  In summary these are:\n     \
    \ The ATM model broadly describes an 'AAL User' as any entity that\n      establishes\
    \ and manages VCs and underlying AAL services to\n      exchange data.  An IP\
    \ over ATM interface is a form of 'AAL User'\n      The most fundamental limitations\
    \ of UNI 3.0/3.1's multicast\n      support are:\n         Only point to multipoint,\
    \ unidirectional VCs may be\n         established.\n         Only the root (source)\
    \ node of a given VC may add or remove\n         leaf nodes.\n      Leaf nodes\
    \ are identified by their unicast ATM addresses.\n   Given this point to multipoint\
    \ call service, the MARS document goes\n   on to describe two architectures for\
    \ emulating multipoint to\n   multipoint IP multicasting - the VC Mesh, and the\
    \ Multicast Server.\n   In either case it was assumed that IP/ATM interfaces (whether\
    \ in\n   routers or hosts) are allowed to originate and manage outgoing point\n\
    \   to multipoint calls without network operator intervention or manual\n   provisioning.\n\
    \   The MARS document also specifies that AAL5 be used for all SVCs,\n   implying\
    \ a requirement that the underlying link service supports the\n   atomic exchange\
    \ of PDUs.\n"
- title: 3.  Generalising the MARS model.
  contents:
  - "3.  Generalising the MARS model.\n   Any NBMA service that offers an equivalent\
    \ to (or superset of) the\n   ATM point to multipoint call service can use the\
    \ MARS model directly.\n   It must be possible to transmit atomic data units bi-directionally\n\
    \   with point to point calls, and unidirectionally (from root to leaves)\n  \
    \ on point to multipoint calls.\n   A MARS is an entity known by its NBMA address.\n\
    \   A MARS Client is an entity known by its NBMA address.\n   An MCS (where needed)\
    \ is an entity known by its NBMA address.\n   The MARS control messages defined\
    \ in sections 4 onwards of the MARS\n   document are shown carrying ATM addresses.\
    \  Using different mar$afn\n   (Address Family) values in the fixed header of\
    \ MARS control messages\n   allows MARS entities to indicate they are carrying\
    \ other types of\n   NBMA addresses (as done in NHRP [3]).  As for NHRP, the\n\
    \   interpretation of the 'sub-address' fields shall be in the context of\n  \
    \ the address family selected (which means it will often simply be\n   null).\n\
    \   In all cases where {IP, ATM.1, ATM.2, ...} mappings are referred to,\n   they\
    \ may be interpreted as {IP, NBMA.1, NBMA.2, ...} in the context\n   of whatever\
    \ NBMA network you are deploying MARS.\n   The MARS Cluster is defined in [2]\
    \ as:\n      The set of ATM interfaces chosing to participate in direct ATM\n\
    \      connections to achieve multicasting of AAL_SDUs between\n      themselves.\n\
    \   It is trivial to observe that the cluster definition is independent\n   of\
    \ the underlying link layer technology. A revised definition\n   becomes:\n  \
    \    The set of NBMA interfaces chosing to participate in direct NBMA\n      connections\
    \ to achieve multicasting of packets between themselves.\n   The term 'Cluster\
    \ Member' continues to refer to an endpoint that is\n   currently using a specific\
    \ MARS for multicast support.  The potential\n   scope of a cluster may be the\
    \ entire membership of a LIS, while the\n   actual scope of a cluster depends\
    \ on which LIS members are actually\n   registered with the cluster's MARS at\
    \ any given time.\n   Section 3.4 of [2] provided a set of mneumonics for the\
    \ signalling\n   functions available to AAL Users. These mneumonics are then used\
    \ in\n   the remainder of [2] to indicate link layer events to which MARS\n  \
    \ entities might react. Recast from the perspective of an NBMA based\n   MARS\
    \ entity, the descriptions would now read:\n      The following generic signalling\
    \ functions are presumed to be\n      available to local MARS entities:\n    \
    \  L_CALL_RQ     Establish a pt-pt call to a specific endpoint.\n      L_MULTI_RQ\
    \    Establish pt-mpt call to a specific endpoint.\n      L_MULTI_ADD   Add new\
    \ leaf node to previously established pt-mpt\n                    call.\n    \
    \  L_MULTI_DROP  Remove specific leaf node from established pt-mpt\n         \
    \           call.\n      L_RELEASE     Release pt-pt call, or all Leaves of a\
    \ pt-mpt call.\n      The signalling exchanges and local information passed between\
    \ MARS\n      entity and NBMA signalling entity with these functions are outside\n\
    \      the scope of this document.\n      The following indications are assumed\
    \ to be available to MARS\n      entities, generated by by the local NBMA signalling\
    \ entity:\n      L_ACK           Succesful completion of a local request.\n  \
    \    L_REMOTE_CALL   A new call has been established to the MARS\n           \
    \           entity.\n      ERR_L_RQFAILED  A remote NBMA endpoint rejected an\
    \ L_CALL_RQ,\n                      L_MULTI_RQ, or L_MULTI_ADD.\n      ERR_L_DROP\
    \      A remote NBMA endpoint dropped off an existing\n                      call.\n\
    \      ERR_L_RELEASE   An existing call was terminated.\n      The signalling\
    \ exchanges and local information passed between MARS\n      entity and NBMA signalling\
    \ entity with these functions are outside\n      the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Open Issues.
  contents:
  - "4.  Open Issues.\n   The trade offs between VC Mesh and Multicast Server modes\
    \ may look\n   quite different for each NBMA technology. This will be especially\n\
    \   true in the area of VC (or equivalent) resource consumption in the\n   NICs\
    \ of hosts, routers, and endpoints supporting MARSs or MCSs. The\n   use of VC\
    \ mesh mode is most vulnerable to NBMA technologies that are\n   signalling intensive\
    \ or resource challenged.\n   Sizing of Clusters (and hence LISes) will also be\
    \ affected by a given\n   NBMA network's ability to support lots of pt-mpt calls.\n\
    \   Additionally, you cannot have more members in a cluster than you can\n   have\
    \ leaf nodes on a pt-mpt call, without hacking the MARS model [6].\n   On going\
    \ developments in server synchronisation protocols for\n   distributed RFC 2022\
    \ implementations are expected to be applicable to\n   non-ATM NBMA networks.\n\
    \   Quality of service considerations are outside the scope of this\n   document.\
    \ They will be very specific to each NBMA technology's\n   capabilities. Related\
    \ work is being pursued outside the ION Working\n   Group.\n   If the NBMA network\
    \ offers some sort of native multipoint to\n   multipoint service then use of\
    \ the MARS model may not be optimal.\n   Such situations require further analysis.\n"

    \   characteristics are discussed. Should enhancements to security be\n   required,\
    \ they shall be added as an extension to the base\n   architecture in RFC 2022,\
    \ or described in documents explicitly\n   proposing use of RFC 2022 over specific\
    \ NBMA technologies.\n"
