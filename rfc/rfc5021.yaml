  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Kerberos V5 [3] specification, in section 7.2.2, reserves\
    \ the\n   high order bit in the initial length field for TCP transport for\n \
    \  future expansion.  This document updates [3] to describe the\n   behaviour\
    \ when that bit is set.  This mechanism is intended for\n   extensions that are\
    \ specific for the TCP transport.\n"

- title: 3.  Extension Mechanism for TCP Transport
  contents:
  - "3.  Extension Mechanism for TCP Transport\n   The reserved high bit of the request\
    \ length field is used to signal\n   the use of this extension mechanism.  When\
    \ the reserved high bit is\n   set in the length field, the remaining 31 bits\
    \ of the initial 4\n   octets are interpreted as a bitmap.  Each bit in the bitmask\
    \ can be\n   used to request a particular extension.  The 31 bits form the\n \
    \  \"extension bitmask\".  It is expected that other documents will\n   describe\
    \ the details associated with particular bits.\n   A 4-octet value with only the\
    \ high bit set, and thus the extension\n   bitmask all zeros, is called a PROBE.\
    \  A client may send a probe to\n   find out which extensions a KDC supports.\
    \  A client may also set\n   particular bits in the extension bitmask directly,\
    \ if it does not\n   need to query the KDC for available extensions before deciding\
    \ which\n   extension to request.\n   Note that clients are not forced to use\
    \ this extension mechanism, and\n   further, clients are expected to only use\
    \ it when they wish to\n   negotiate a particular extension.\n   The protocol\
    \ is as follows.  The client MUST begin by sending a\n   4-octet value with the\
    \ high bit set.  The packet is thus either a\n   PROBE or a specific request for\
    \ some extension(s).  The client MUST\n   NOT send additional data before the\
    \ server has responded.\n   If a KDC receives a request for a set of extensions\
    \ that it supports,\n   it MUST respond by sending a 4-octet zero value, i.e.,\
    \ 0x00000000.\n   The KDC MAY directly send additional data after the zero value,\n\
    \   without waiting for the client to respond, as specified by the\n   particular\
    \ negotiated extension.  (Note: A 4-octet zero value can\n   never be sent by\
    \ an implementation that conforms to RFC 4120 and that\n   does not support this\
    \ extension mechanism, because a KRB-ERROR is\n   always of non-zero size.)\n\
    \   If a KDC receives a PROBE, or if a KDC does not support all\n   extensions\
    \ corresponding to set bits in the extension bitmask, the\n   KDC MUST return\
    \ 4 octets with the high bit set, and with the\n   remaining bitmask indicating\
    \ which extensions it supports.  The KDC\n   then MUST wait, and the client MUST\
    \ send a second 4-octet value with\n   the high bit set.  If the second 4-octet\
    \ value is a PROBE or an\n   unsupported extension, the KDC MUST close the connection.\
    \  This can\n   be used by the client to shut down a session when the KDC did\
    \ not\n   support an extension that is required by the client.  If the second\n\
    \   4-octet value is a supported extension, the KDC MUST respond by\n   sending\
    \ a 4-octet zero value, i.e., 0x00000000.  The KDC MAY directly\n   send additional\
    \ data after the zero value, as specified by the\n   particular negotiated extension.\n\
    \   The client and KDC SHOULD wait for the other side to respond\n   according\
    \ to this protocol, and the client and KDC SHOULD NOT close\n   the connection\
    \ prematurely.  Resource availability considerations may\n   influence whether,\
    \ and for how long, the client and KDC will wait for\n   the other side to respond\
    \ to a request.\n   The KDC MUST NOT support the extension mechanism if it does\
    \ not\n   support any extensions.  If no extensions are supported, the KDC MUST\n\
    \   return a KRB-ERROR message with the error KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG and\n   MUST\
    \ close the TCP stream, similar to what an implementation that\n   does not understand\
    \ this extension mechanism would do.\n   The behaviour when more than one non-high\
    \ bit is set depends on the\n   particular extension mechanisms.  If a requested\
    \ extension (bit X)\n   does not specify how it interacts with another requested\
    \ extension\n   (bit Y), the KDC MUST treat the request as a PROBE or unsupported\n\
    \   extension, and proceed as above.\n   Each extension MUST describe the structure\
    \ of protocol data beyond\n   the length field, and the behaviour of the client\
    \ and KDC.  In\n   particular, the structure may be a protocol with its own message\n\
    \   framing.  If an extension mechanism reserves multiple bits, it MUST\n   describe\
    \ how they interact.\n"
- title: 4.  Interoperability Consideration
  contents:
  - "4.  Interoperability Consideration\n   Implementations with support for TCP that\
    \ do not claim to conform to\n   RFC 4120 may not handle the high bit correctly.\
    \  The KDC behaviour\n   may include closing the TCP connection without any response,\
    \ and\n   logging an error message in the KDC log.  When this was written, this\n\
    \   problem existed in modern versions of popular KDC implementations.\n   Implementations\
    \ experiencing trouble getting the expected responses\n   from a KDC might assume\
    \ that the KDC does not support this extension\n   mechanism.  A client might\
    \ remember this semi-permanently, to avoid\n   triggering the same problematic\
    \ behaviour on the KDC every time.\n   Care should be taken to avoid unexpected\
    \ behaviour for the user when\n   the KDC is eventually upgraded.  Implementations\
    \ might also provide a\n   way to enable and disable this extension on a per-realm\
    \ basis.  How\n   to handle these backwards compatibility quirks are in general\
    \ left\n   unspecified.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Because the initial length field is not protected,\
    \ it is possible for\n   an active attacker (i.e., one that is able to modify\
    \ traffic between\n   the client and the KDC) to make it appear to the client\
    \ that the\n   server does not support this extension mechanism (a downgrade\n\
    \   attack).  Further, active attackers can also interfere with the\n   negotiation\
    \ of which extensions are supported, which may also result\n   in a downgrade\
    \ attack.  This problem can be solved by having a policy\n   in the clients and\
    \ in the KDC to reject connections that do not have\n   the desired properties.\
    \  The problem can also be mitigated by having\n   the negotiated extension send\
    \ a cryptographic checksum of the offered\n   extensions.\n"
