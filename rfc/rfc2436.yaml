- title: 2 Introduction
  contents:
  - "2 Introduction\n   The telecommunication industry is faced with an explosion\
    \ in growth\n   of the Internet and other IP (Internet Protocol) based networks.\n\
    \   Operators, manufacturers and software/application providers alike are\n  \
    \ reconsidering their business directions and Standards Development\n   Organizations\
    \ and Forums and Consortia are facing an immense\n   challenge to address this\
    \ situation.  These challenges were\n   considered by TSAG at its meeting in Geneva,\
    \ 7-11 September 1998,\n   where it recognized that although the ITU-T and ISOC/IETF\
    \ are already\n   collaborating in a number of areas, this collaboration must\
    \ be\n   strengthened within the context of changes in work emphasis and\n   direction\
    \ within the ITU-T on studies related to IP based networks.\n   For example, many\
    \ Study Groups (e.g., 7, 8 & 16) already address\n   several the aspects of IP\
    \ based networks.  Further, new IP related\n   work activities are starting in\
    \ other Study Groups (e.g., 4, 11 &\n   13).  There are many potential areas of\
    \ interest to ITU-T Study\n   Groups in the IP area that should be investigated\
    \ (e.g., signaling,\n   routing, security, numbering & addressing, integrated\
    \ management,\n   performance, IP - telecom interworking, access).  Since many\
    \ of these\n   areas are also being investigated by the IETF, there is a requirement\n\
    \   for close collaboration.\n   Recommendations A.4, A.5 and A.6 already document\
    \ the process for\n   working with other organizations and their documents.  Since\
    \ there\n   are no specific guidelines on the process of collaboration with the\n\
    \   IETF, this liaison is meant to provide that information.  The current\n  \
    \ level of cooperation between the ITU-T and the IETF should be built\n   upon\
    \ to ensure that the competence and experience of each\n   organization is brought\
    \ to bear in the most effective manner and in\n   collaboration with the other.\n"
- title: 3 Guidance on Collaboration
  contents:
  - "3 Guidance on Collaboration\n   TSAG has been made aware of several instances\
    \ of existing successful\n   collaboration between the ITU-T and ISOC/IETF.  This\
    \ section builds\n   on this existing process and details some of the more important\n\
    \   guidance points that Study Groups should be aware of in their\n   collaboration\
    \ with ISOC/IETF.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1  How to interact on ITU-T or IETF work items.\n   Study Groups that have\
    \ identified work topics that are Internet\n   related should evaluate the relationship\
    \ with topics defined in the\n   IETF.  Current IETF Working Groups and their\
    \ charters (IETF\n   definition of the scope of work) are listed in the IETF archives\
    \ (see\n   section 3.5).  A Study Group may decide that development of a\n   Recommendation\
    \ on a particular topic may benefit from collaboration\n   with the IETF.\n  \
    \ The Study Group should identify this collaboration in its work plan\n   (specifically\
    \ in that of each Question involved), describing the goal\n   of the collaboration\
    \ and its expected outcome.  It is anticipated\n   that an IETF Working Group\
    \ would also evaluate and identify areas of\n   relationship with the ITU-T and\
    \ document the collaboration with the\n   ITU-T Study Group in its charter.\n\
    \   The following sections outline a process that can be used to enable\n   each\
    \ group to learn about the others new work items.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1  How the ITU-T learns about existing IETF work items\n   The responsibility\
    \ is on individual Study Groups to review the\n   current IETF Working Groups\
    \ to determine if there are any topics of\n   mutual interest.  Should a Study\
    \ Group believe that there is an\n   opportunity for collaboration on a topic\
    \ of mutual interest it should\n   contact both the IETF Working Group Chair and\
    \ the Area Director\n   responsible.\n"
- title: 3.1.2  How the ITU-T learns about proposed new IETF work items
  contents:
  - "3.1.2  How the ITU-T learns about proposed new IETF work items\n   The IETF maintains\
    \ a mailing list for the distribution and discussion\n   of proposed new Working\
    \ Group charters amongst the management team.\n   To add or change a subscription\
    \ to this list, send a message to\n   iesg-secretary@ietf.org indicating who you\
    \ are and that you would\n   like to subscribe to the New Work mailing list. \
    \ Details on the list\n   process will be emailed to each subscriber.\n   It is\
    \ recommended that each Study Group chairman (or a delegate)\n   subscribe to\
    \ this list and monitor the new work items for possible\n   overlap or interest\
    \ to their Study Group.  It is expected that this\n   mailing list will see one\
    \ or two messages per month. Chairmen should\n   identify their comments on these\
    \ charters by responding to the IESG\n   mailing list at iesg@ietf.org clearly\
    \ indicating their ITU-T position\n   and the nature of their concern.  It should\
    \ be noted that the IETF\n   turnaround time for new Working Group charters is\
    \ one week.  As a\n   result, the mailing list should be consistently monitored.\n"

    \ to the\n   appropriate IETF interested individuals and will be copied to all\n\
    \   ITU-T Study Group Chairmen.  The intention is for Study Groups to\n   forward\
    \ updates to the Vice President of Standards for ISOC as they\n   occur.\n   It\
    \ is expected that any IETF Working Group interest with the topics\n   being covered\
    \ by the ITU-T will be forwarded to individual Study\n   Group Chairmen (or the\
    \ lead Study Group Chairman) by the Vice\n   President of Standards for ISOC.\n"

    \ ITU-T Study Group participants (see 3.2.1).  Conversely, ITU-T\n   delegates\
    \ may participate in the work of the IETF as individuals or\n   be recognized\
    \ as ITU-T delegates (see 3.2.2).  To promote\n   collaboration it is useful to\

    \  The\n   Study Group Chairman communicates the ITU-T list of delegates by\n\
    \   email to the Vice President of Standards for ISOC and also to the\n   Study\
    \ Group.  The email address of the Vice President of Standards\n   for ISOC is\

- title: 3.2.3 Communication contacts
  contents:
  - "3.2.3 Communication contacts\n   To foster ongoing communication between the\
    \ ITU-T and ISOC/IETF, it\n   is important to identify and establish contact points\
    \ within ITU-T\n   Study Groups for specific IETF topics of mutual interest. It\
    \ is\n   beneficial to identify these contact points early and in some cases\n\
    \   the contact point identified by each organization may be the same\n   individual.\
    \  It is responsibility of a Study Group to establish the\n   contact points with\
    \ the IETF and maintain the list on its web page.\n   An example of communication\
    \ contacts that is suggested to Study\n   Groups has both a high level and a working\
    \ level:\n   1. ITU-T Study Group Chairman and IETF Area Director\n      An IETF\
    \ Area Director is the individual responsible for overseeing\n      a major focus\
    \ of activity with a scope similar to that of an ITU-T\n      Study Group Chairman.\
    \ These positions are both relatively long-\n      term (of several years) and\
    \ offer the stability of contact points\n      between the two organizations for\
    \ a given topic.\n   2. ITU-T Rapporteur and IETF Working Group Chair\n      An\
    \ IETF Working Group Chair is an individual who is assigned to\n      lead the\
    \ work on a specific task within one particular area with a\n      scope similar\
    \ to that of an ITU-T Rapporteur.  These positions are\n      working positions\
    \ (of a year or more) that typically end when the\n      work on a specific topic\
    \ ends.  Collaboration here is very\n      beneficial to ensure the actual work\
    \ gets done. Note that the\n      current IETF Area Directors and Working Group\
    \ chairs can be found\n      in the IETF Working Group charters.  The current\
    \ ITU-T Study Group\n      chairmen and Rapporteurs are listed on the ITU-T web\
    \ page.\n   Both the ITU-T and IETF may assign their contact point function(s)\
    \ to\n   other individuals than those suggested as it deems appropriate.\n"
- title: 3.2.4  Communication
  contents:
  - "3.2.4  Communication\n   Informal communication between contact points and experts\
    \ of both\n   organizations is encouraged.  However, note that formal communication\n\
    \   from an ITU-T Study Group, Working Party or Rapporteur to an\n   associated\
    \ IETF contact point must be explicitly approved and\n   identified as coming\
    \ from the Study Group, Working Party or\n   Rapporteur Group, respectively. \
    \ Conversely, formal communication\n   from an IETF Working Group or Area Director\
    \ must also be explicitly\n   approved and identified before forwarding to any\
    \ ITU-T contact.\n   Formal communication is intended to allow the sharing of\
    \ positions\n   between the IETF and the ITU-T outside of actual documents (as\n\
    \   described in 3.3).  This would cover such things as comments on\n   documents\
    \ and requests for input.  The approved communication is\n   simply emailed from\
    \ one body contact to another (the appropriate\n   mailing lists, as described\
    \ in 3.2.5 may be copied).\n"
- title: 3.2.5  Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "3.2.5  Mailing Lists\n   All IETF Working Groups and all ITU-T Study Group Questions\
    \ have\n   associated mailing lists.\n   In the IETF, the mailing list is the\
    \ primary vehicle for discussion\n   and decision making.  It is recommended the\
    \ ITU-T experts interested\n   in particular IETF working group topics subscribe\
    \ to and participate\n   in these lists. The IETF Working Group mailing list subscription\
    \ and\n   archive information are noted in each Working Group's charter. In the\n\
    \   ITU-T, the TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions, Working\n  \
    \ Parties and other topics within Study Groups (more detail can be\n   found on\
    \ the ITU website.).  These mailing lists are typically used\n   for discussion\
    \ of ITU-T contributions.  Note that individual\n   subscribers to this list must\
    \ be affiliated with an ITU-T member (at\n   this time, there is no blanket inclusion\
    \ of all IETF participants as\n   members, however, as a member ISOC may designate\
    \ representatives to\n   subscribe).  Alternatively, ITU-T members operate personal\
    \ mailing\n   lists on various topics with no restrictions on membership (e.g.,\n\
    \   IETF participants are welcome).\n"
- title: 3.3     Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "3.3     Document Sharing\n   During the course of ITU-T and IETF collaboration\
    \ it is important to\n   share working drafts and documents among the technical\
    \ working\n   groups.  Initial proposed concepts and specifications typically\
    \ can\n   be circulated by email (often just repeating the concept and not\n \
    \  including the details of the specification) on both the IETF and\n   ITU-T\
    \ mailing lists.  In addition, working texts (or URLs) of draft\n   Recommendations\
    \ or RFCs (Internet Drafts) may also be sent between\n   the organizations as\
    \ described below.\n"

  - "3.3.1  IETF to ITU-T\n   IETF documents (e.g., Internet Drafts) can be submitted\
    \ to a Study\n   Group as a Contribution from ISOC.  In order to ensure that the\
    \ IETF\n   has properly authorized this,  the IETF Working Group must agree that\n\
    \   the specific drafts are of mutual interest and that there is a\n   benefit\
    \ in forwarding them to the ITU-T for review, comment and\n   potential use. \
    \ Once agreed, the Vice President Standards for ISOC\n   would review the Working\
    \ Group request and give approval.  The\n   contributions would then be forwarded\

  contents:
  - "PART I - Developed by TSAG at its January 1998 Meeting\n   The following guidelines\
    \ should be used in conjunction with the\n   relevant provisions of Recommendations\
    \ A.3, A.4, A.5 and A.23.\n   1. Ownership/Change Control\n      - When considering\
    \ using material from other organizations it is\n         preferable to only include\
    \ references to other standards,\n         rather than incorporate text from a\
    \ standard in the body of a\n         Recommendation. Exceptionally, full text\
    \ incorporation is\n         necessary rather than a reference where Recommendations\
    \ having\n         regulatory connotations are concerned.\n      - Reference should\
    \ be made to the particular issue of a standard.\n         In this way the ITU-T\
    \ is in control of what is actually\n         referenced even if the source organization\
    \ updates the\n         standard.\n      - References to standards from other\
    \ organizations should only be\n         made where those organizations continue\
    \ to provide public\n         access to the version referenced even when updated\
    \ versions are\n         issued.\n      - When a draft Recommendation is being\
    \ prepared and the intention\n         is to reference a standard from another\
    \ organization, that\n         organization should be advised by the TSB of the\
    \ ITU-T's\n         intention and should be requested to notify the ITU-T of any\n\
    \         impending changes to the standard and of any reissues of the\n     \
    \    standard. (This request may be part of the correspondence\n         described\
    \ in Recommendation A.5, section 2.4.) It is however\n         the responsibility\
    \ of the Study Group to regularly review its\n         Recommendations and check\
    \ if the references are correct and if\n         necessary to reissue the Recommendation\
    \ with revised references\n         (and where necessary make changes in the body\
    \ of the\n         Recommendation where the reference is made.).\n      - Should\
    \ an organization intend to remove completely an earlier\n         version of\
    \ a standard the ITU-T should be advised so that it\n         can either incorporate\
    \ the text in the Recommendation or change\n         the reference to a later\
    \ version.\n   2. Access\n      - The objective is to have referenced standards\
    \ freely available\n         via the Web so that people purchasing a Recommendation\
    \ may get\n         access to the references.  A warning should be given to\n\
    \         purchasers of ITU-T Recommendations that they may have to\n        \
    \ additionally purchase the referenced standards. This could be\n         done\
    \ by including a note to such effect in the introduction to\n         Recommendations\
    \ where references are included.\n      - When developing a Recommendation where\
    \ consideration is being\n         given to using references to other standards\
    \ the Study Group\n         should investigate with the TSB whether the referenced\
    \ text\n         will be available free of charge or if a payment will be\n  \
    \       required. This should be taken into account by the Study Group\n     \
    \    as it may influence the decision to use the reference.\n   3. IPR\n     \
    \ - In principle, if the IPR policy of the organization owning a\n         referenced\
    \ standard is more stringent than that of the ITU-T\n         then there should\
    \ not be any IPR problems with including the\n         reference. However, this\
    \ may not be the case with all\n         organizations. Further guidelines are\
    \ being prepared by the\n         Director of the TSB.\n   4. Approval\n     \
    \ - The approval procedures in Resolution 1 have to be followed for\n        \
    \ Recommendations containing references (wholly or in part) to\n         standards\
    \ from other bodies even in the case where the\n         Recommendation is just\
    \ a reference to another standard.\n"

  - "PART II - Developed by TSAG at its September 1998 Meeting\n   The following guidelines\
    \ should be used in conjunction with\n   Recommendation A.5.\n   1. Nested References\n\
    \      Issue: RFCs often contain references to related RFCs and ITU-T\n      Recommendations\
    \ which, in turn, may contain references to other\n      RFCs and Recommendations.\
    \ It is unclear how to handle these nested\n      references in the context of\
    \ A.5.\n      Guideline: Each time an RFC is referenced within an ITU-T\n    \
    \  Recommendation, all references within that RFC should be listed in\n      the\
    \ report documenting the decision of the Study Group. No further\n      treatment\
    \ is necessary, although the Study Group may wish to\n      investigate those\
    \ references further on a case-by-case basis. The\n      same guidelines apply\
    \ when referencing the documents of other\n      organizations.\n   2. Subsequent\
    \ Referencing of the Same Document\n      Issue: It is possible that the same\
    \ RFC may be considered for\n      referencing in multiple Recommendations. It\
    \ is unclear what\n      evaluation is required in subsequent references.\n  \
    \    Guideline: The justification for referencing the same document in\n     \
    \ different Recommendations is likely to be different. Consequently,\n      it\
    \ is important that separate evaluations be made each time the\n      document\
    \ is referenced.  However, only items 1 - 8 in Appendix I\n      (and Annex A)\
    \ of Recommendation A.5 need to be completed if the\n      referenced organization\
    \ has already been qualified per Section 3\n      of A.5. Since items 9 and 10\
    \ are dependent on the organization and\n      not on the document, they need\
    \ to be completed only the first time\n      a document from that organization\
    \ is being considered for\n      referencing and only if such information has\
    \ not been documented\n      already.\n   3. Availability of Referenced Document\n\
    \      Issue: Paragraph 2.2.10 of A.5 requires that the contributing\n      Study\
    \ Group member provide a full copy of the existing document.\n      It is unclear\
    \ whether paper copies are mandatory or whether\n      electronic availability,\
    \ for example, on a Web site, is\n      sufficient.\n      Guideline: The objective\
    \ is to have referenced documents available\n      via the Web at no cost so that\
    \ the Study Group members may proceed\n      with their evaluation. Accordingly,\
    \ if a referenced document is\n      available in this manner, it is sufficient\
    \ for the contributing\n      member to provide its exact location on the Web.\
    \ On the other\n      hand, if the document is not available in this manner, a\
    \ full copy\n      must be provided (in electronic format if permissible by the\n\
    \      referenced organization, otherwise in paper format).\n   4. Referencing\
    \ of IETF Documents\n      Issue: It is unclear whether or not it is appropriate\
    \ to reference\n      RFCs that are not on the standards track (the \"Informational\"\
    \ and\n      \"Experimental\" RFCs) or those that are at the first level of\n\
    \      standardization (the \"Proposed Standard\" RFCs).\n      Guideline: Some\
    \ outputs of organizations may not be appropriate\n      for normative referencing,\
    \ others may not be appropriate for any\n      referencing, normative or informative.\
    \ In the case of the IETF, it\n      is not appropriate to make any references\
    \ to \"Internet Drafts\" or\n      to \"Historic\" RFCs as noted in A.5. In addition,\
    \ it is not\n      appropriate to make normative references to RFCs that are\n\
    \      considered \"Informational\" or \"Experimental\". References to RFCs\n\
    \      that have the status of \"Proposed Standards\" should be made with\n  \
    \    caution and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis because\n      such\
    \ standards are considered immature in the sense that they may\n      change if\
    \ problems are found in real implementations or if better\n      solutions are\
    \ identified.\n   5. IETF Address Changes\n      The electronic address of the\
    \ IETF archives has changed.\n      Accordingly the addresses in items 4 and 9.8\
    \ of Annex A should be\n      changed, respectively to:\n         http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html\
    \ - for the IPR archive\n         http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc.html - for the\
    \ RFC archive\n"
