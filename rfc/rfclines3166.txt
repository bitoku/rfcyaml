Abstract RFC 1403, "BGP OSPF Interaction", describes technology which is no longer used.
This document requests that RFC 1403 be moved to Historic status.
Details During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it became apparent that BGP OSPF interaction, as described in RFC 1403, is not common usage (if at all), and requires significant implementation complexity.
Since this mechanism has not been in use in the public internet for many years (if ever), it is proposed to reclassify it to Historic. 2.
Security Considerations Moving RFC 1403 to Historic has no known effect on the security of the internet.
