  - "                Announcement of a Mail Facility at UCSB\n   There now exists\
    \ a server program at UCSB, resident under socket 3,\n   which supports that subset\
    \ of the File Transfer Protocol necessary\n   for mail delivery.  Only the MAIL\
    \ and BYE commands are implemented at\n   this time.\n   Mail may be sent to an\
    \ individual at UCSB by specifying his local\n   user name in the MAIL command.\
    \  The following is a list of those\n   individuals currently defined as valid\
    \ recipients of Network mail,\n   each with their respective user name:  Ed Faeh\
    \ (FAEH), Jim Guyton\n   (GUYTON), Mark Krilanovich (KRILANOV), Curtis Mosso (MOSSO),\
    \ John\n   Pickens (PICKENS), and Ron Stoughton (STOUGHTN).  In addition, any\n\
    \   general comments or complaints about UCSB services may be sent to\n   user\
    \ name GRIPE.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
    \ ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Dave Bachmann 1/98 ]\n"
