  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3668 [RFC3668] documents the current IETF policies and\n\
    \   obligations with respect to disclosure of patents and patent\n   applications.\
    \  It also documents the information requested in\n   licensing declarations for\
    \ IETF specifications.  In the interest of\n   making these patent disclosure\
    \ and licensing declaration processes\n   simpler, this document proposes a patent\
    \ disclosure and licensing\n   declaration template that may be optionally used\
    \ as one method for\n   IETF participants and patent holders to comply with patent\
    \ disclosure\n   requirements and licensing declaration provisions under RFC 3668.\n\
    \   This proposal also may be optionally used as a model by the IETF\n   Secretariat\
    \ for Web-based disclosure and licensing declaration tools;\n   however, the intent\
    \ of this document is informational and is not\n   meant to suggest that this\
    \ is the only method that could be used by\n   IETF participants for disclosure\
    \ of patents or for licensing\n   declarations.  For the latest information on\
    \ how to submit a patent\n   disclosure or licensing declaration, please see\n\
    \   http://www.ietf.org/ipr-instructions.\n   IPR disclosures should be submitted\
    \ in English, since this is the\n   working language of the IETF.  Names of persons\
    \ and companies should\n   be presented in the way they are usually presented\
    \ in an English-\n   speaking context.\n"

    \   This document is an IETF Patent Disclosure and Licensing Declaration\n   Template\
    \ and is submitted to inform the IETF of a) patent information\n   regarding the\
    \ IETF document or contribution listed in Section IV, and\n   b) a Patent Holder's\
    \ intention with respect to the licensing of its\n   necessary patent claims.\
    \  No actual license is implied by submission\n   of this template.  Please complete\
    \ and submit a separate template for\n   each IETF document or contribution to\
    \ which the disclosed patent\n   information relates.\n   I. Patent Holder/Applicant\

    \ represents and warrants\n   that he or she is authorized by the Patent Holder\
    \ to agree to the\n   above-selected licensing declaration.\n   VII. Contact Information\

  - "3.  Commentary on Terms Used in the Template\n   Section III requests contact\
    \ information for the Patent Holder's IETF\n   participant whose personal belief\
    \ that necessary patent claims are\n   implicated by an IETF document or contribution\
    \ caused this template\n   to be filed.  This is an optional section.  However,\
    \ if Section III\n   is not completed, then Section VII must be completed.  Even\
    \ if\n   Section III is completed, Section VII must still be completed if the\n\
    \   submitter of this template is different from the IETF participant\n   identified\
    \ in Section III.\n   The \"Other Designations\" field in Section IV may be used\
    \ to identify\n   an IETF contribution (oral or written) other than an Internet-Draft\n\
    \   or RFC to which a disclosure is related.\n   Here is an explanation of the\
    \ licensing declaration options in\n   Section VI of the template:\n   a) No License\
    \ Required for Implementers: The Patent Holder does not\n      require parties\
    \ to acquire any license to its Necessary Patent\n      Claims in order to make,\
    \ have made, use, import, offer to sell,\n      sell, or distribute technology\
    \ that implements such an IETF\n      specification.\n   b) Royalty-Free, Reasonable,\
    \ and Non-Discriminatory License to All\n      Implementers: The Patent Holder\
    \ is willing, upon request, to grant\n      a license to its Necessary Patent\
    \ Claims to all persons on a\n      royalty-free basis (i.e., no royalty or other\
    \ fee) and under other\n      reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions,\
    \ to make,\n      have made, use, import, offer to sell, sell, and distribute\n\
    \      technology that implements such an IETF specification.\n   c) Reasonable\
    \ and Non-Discriminatory License to All Implementers with\n      Possible Royalty/Fee:\
    \ The Patent Holder is willing, upon request,\n      to grant a license to its\
    \ Necessary Patent Claims to all persons\n      under reasonable and non-discriminatory\
    \ terms and conditions\n      (which may include a royalty/fee), to make, have\
    \ made, use,\n      import, offer to sell, sell, and distribute technology that\n\
    \      implements such an IETF specification.\n   d) Licensing Declaration to\
    \ be Provided Later: The Patent Holder is\n      willing to commit to the provisions\
    \ of a), b), or c) above, but\n      wants to defer its specific selection of\
    \ one of these licensing\n      declaration options until a later point in time\
    \ (or when asked for\n      this information by the IESG).  This option may not\
    \ be selected if\n      the Patent Holder is unwilling to commit to the provisions\
    \ of a),\n      b), or c) above.  In that case, the Patent Holder must select\n\
    \      licensing declaration option e) - \"Unwilling to Commit to the\n      Provisions\
    \ of a), b), or c) Above.\"\n   e) Unwilling to Commit to the Provisions of a),\
    \ b), or c) Above: The\n      Patent Holder indicates an unwillingness to commit\
    \ to the\n      provisions of any of options a), b), or c) described above.\n\
    \   Options a), b), and c) above also allow the Patent Holder to indicate\n  \
    \ (with a check) whether its licensing declaration is limited solely to\n   standards-track\
    \ RFCs.  If left unchecked, the Patent Holder's\n   licensing declaration will\
    \ be deemed to apply to any implementation\n   of the relevant IETF specification,\
    \ including non-standards-track\n   documents and Internet-Drafts.  However, the\
    \ Patent Holder may list\n   other conditions or restrictions on its commitment\
    \ to forego a\n   license (option a)) or on its commitment to license (options\
    \ b) and\n   c)) in Section VIII - \"Other Notes.\"  This standards-track qualifier\n\
    \   is not relevant to licensing declaration options d) and e), because\n   under\
    \ d) the Patent Holder has not yet indicated its specific\n   licensing intention\
    \ and under e) the Patent Holder has indicated a\n   general refusal to commit\
    \ to the provisions of any of options a), b),\n   or c) above.\n   Section VIII\
    \ in the template, \"Other Notes,\" may be used for any\n   additional information\
    \ a discloser or Patent Holder wishes to\n   provide.  For example, a Patent Holder\
    \ may use the \"Other Notes\"\n   Section to indicate any other conditions or\
    \ restrictions on the\n   licensing declaration option selected in Section VI\
    \ (e.g., 1)\n   reciprocity, or 2) that a license will only be made available\
    \ for\n   implementations of any RFC (standards-track or non-standards-track),\n\
    \   but not for implementations of Internet-Drafts or other documents).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document relates to the IETF process, not\
    \ any particular\n   technology.  There are security considerations when adopting\
    \ any\n   particular technology, regardless of whether patent or patent\n   application\
    \ disclosures or licensing declarations are implicated by\n   such technology.\
    \  A working group should take those security\n   considerations into account\
    \ as one part of evaluating the technology,\n   but there are no security considerations\
    \ per se with these IETF\n   processes.\n"
