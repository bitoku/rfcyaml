- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   The PWE3 MIB modules architecture provides a layered modular\
    \ model\n   into which any supported emulated service can be connected to any\n\
    \   supported PSN type.  This specific MIB module provides the glue for\n   mapping\
    \ between the emulated service onto the native PSN service.  As\n   such, the\
    \ defining of a PW emulated service requires the use of at\n   least three types\
    \ of MIB modules.\n   Starting from the emulated service, the first type is a\
    \ service-\n   specific module, which is dependent on the emulated signal type.\n\
    \   These modules are defined in other documents.\n   The second type is this\
    \ module, the PW-STD-MIB module, which\n   configures general parameters of the\
    \ PW that are common to all types\n   of emulated services and PSN types.\n  \
    \ The third type of module is a PSN-specific module.  There is a\n   different\
    \ module for each type of PSN.  These modules associate the\n   PW with one or\
    \ more \"tunnels\" that carry the service over the PSN.\n   These modules are\
    \ defined in other documents.\n"
- title: 5.  Structure of the MIB Module
  contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MIB Module\n   The MIB module consists of six tables:\n\
    \   - The generic configuration and status monitoring objects that are\n     common\
    \ to all service types and PSN types (pwTable).\n   - The PW Performance Current\
    \ Table (pwPerfCurrentTable) contains PW\n     statistics for the current 15-minute\
    \ period.\n   - The PW Performance Interval Table (pwPerfIntervalTable) contains\
    \ PW\n     statistics for historical intervals (usually 96 15-minute entries\n\
    \     to cover a 24-hour period).\n   - The PW Performance 1-day Interval Table\
    \ (pwPerf1DayIntervalTable)\n     contains PW statistics for historical intervals\
    \ accumulated per\n     day.  Usually 30 1-day entries to cover a monthly period.\n\
    \   - The mapping table (pwIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse mapping\n  \
    \   of the unique PWid parameters [peer IP, PW type, and PW ID] and the\n    \
    \ pwIndex.\n   - The mapping table (pwGenFecIndexMappingTable) enables the reverse\n\
    \     mapping of unique PWid parameters used in genFecSignaling\n     [pwGroupAttachmentID,\
    \ pwLocalAttachmentID, and pwPeerAttachmentID]\n     and the pwIndex.\n   This\
    \ MIB module uses Textual Conventions from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],\n   [RFC2580],\
    \ [RFC2863], [RFC3411], [RFC3593], [RFC3705], [RFC4001], and\n   [RFC5542], and\
    \ references [RFC3413], [RFC4623], and [RFC4720].\n"
- title: 6.  PW-STD-MIB Module Usage
  contents:
  - "6.  PW-STD-MIB Module Usage\n   An entry in the PW table (pwTable) MUST exist\
    \ for all PW types (ATM,\n   FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.).  This table holds generic\
    \ parameters\n   related to the PW creation and monitoring.\n   A conceptual row\
    \ can be created in the pwTable in one of the\n   following ways:\n   1) The operator\
    \ creates a row in the pwTable when configuring the\n      node for a new service.\
    \  This mode MUST be supported by the agent,\n      and MUST be used when creating\
    \ a non-signaled (manually assigned)\n      PW.\n   2) The agent MAY create a\
    \ row in the pwTable if a signaling message\n      has been received from a peer\
    \ node with signaling identification\n      parameters that are not already known\
    \ to the local node (i.e.,\n      there is no related entry created by the operator\
    \ with matching\n      parameters).  This mode is OPTIONAL.\n   3) The agent MAY\
    \ create a row in the pwTable automatically due to\n      some auto-discovery\
    \ application, or based on configuration that is\n      done through non-SNMP\
    \ applications.  This mode is OPTIONAL.\n      - The agent then creates the rows\
    \ in the (locally supported)\n        performance tables and reverse-mapping tables\
    \ in PW-STD-MIB\n        module.\n"
- title: 7.  Relations to Other PWE3 MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "7.  Relations to Other PWE3 MIB Modules\n   - Based on the PSN type defined for\
    \ the PW, a row is created in the\n     PSN-specific module (for example, [RFC5602])\
    \ and associated to the\n     PW table by the common pwIndex.\n   - Based on the\
    \ PW type defined for the PW, a row is created in the\n     service-specific module\
    \ (for example, [CEPMIB]) and associated to\n     the PW table by the common pwIndex.\n\
    \   - Unless all the necessary entries in the applicable tables have been\n  \
    \   created and all the parameters have been consistently configured in\n    \
    \ those tables, signaling cannot be performed from the local node,\n     and the\
    \ pwVcOperStatus should report 'notPresent'.\n"
- title: 8.  Relations to the IF-MIB
  contents:
  - "8.  Relations to the IF-MIB\n   The PW in general is not an ifIndex [RFC2863]\
    \ on its own, for agent\n   scalability reasons.  The PW is typically associated\
    \ via the PWE3 MIB\n   modules to an ifIndex the PW is emulating.  This ifIndex\
    \ may\n   represent a physical entity -- for example, a PW emulating a SONET\n\
    \   path as in Circuit Emulation Service over Packet (CEP).  In that\n   case,\
    \ the PW itself is not an ifIndex; however, the PW-STD-CEP-MIB\n   module associates\
    \ the PW to the ifIndex of the path to be emulated.\n   In some cases, the PW\
    \ will be associated to an ifIndex representing a\n   virtual interface.  An example\
    \ is Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\n   where the PW emulates a logical interface\
    \ of a (logical) bridge.  The\n   physical ports' association to the VPLS instance\
    \ is defined in the\n   non-PW MIB modules in this case.\n   Exception to the\
    \ above MAY exist in some implementations where it is\n   convenient to manage\
    \ the PW as an ifIndex in the ifTable.  A special\n   ifType to represent a PW\
    \ virtual interface (246) will be used in the\n   ifTable in this case.\n   When\
    \ the PW is managed as an ifIndex, by default it SHOULD NOT be\n   stacked, i.e.,\
    \ this ifIndex SHOULD NOT be layered above the\n   respective PSN tunnel ifIndex\
    \ or the attachment circuit ifIndex or\n   the interface carrying the attachment\
    \ circuit.\n   Note that the ifIndex that carries the PW toward/from the PSN is\
    \ not\n   explicitly configured via PWE3 MIB modules except in rare cases.  In\n\
    \   most cases, the PW is carried inside a PSN tunnel, and the interfaces\n  \
    \ carrying the tunnel are specified in the related MIB modules that\n   control\
    \ the PSN tunnels.\n"
- title: 9.  PW Notifications
  contents:
  - "9.  PW Notifications\n   This MIB module includes notifications for PW entering\
    \ the up or down\n   state, in accordance with the guidelines for interface notifications\n\
    \   as described in [RFC2863].  Implementers should be aware that in many\n  \
    \ systems, it is desired to correlate notifications, such that\n   notifications\
    \ will not be emitted if notifications from a higher\n   level (such as ports\
    \ or tunnels) are already in effect.  Specifically\n   for PWs, it is anticipated\
    \ that most network's equipment failures\n   turn into lowerLayerDown state at\
    \ the PW level, where a notification\n   has already been emitted from a higher\
    \ level.\n   When a PW is represented as an ifIndex, it is RECOMMENDED that PW\n\
    \   notifications be turned off, to avoid duplication with the ifIndex\n   status\
    \ change notifications.\n"
- title: 10.  Example of the PW MIB Modules Usage
  contents:
  - "10.  Example of the PW MIB Modules Usage\n   In this section, we provide an example\
    \ of using the MIB objects\n   described in section 7 to set up a CEP PW over\
    \ Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS) PSN.  While this example is not meant\
    \ to illustrate\n   every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to\n\
    \   understanding some of the key concepts.  It is meant to be read after\n  \
    \ going through the MIB itself.\n   In this example, a PW service for CEP is configured\
    \ over an MPLS PSN\n   (MPLS-TE tunnel).  It uses LDP as in [RFC4447] for service\
    \ setup.\n   For the operation in the service-specific MIB modules and the PSN-\n\
    \   specific MIB modules, see the specific MIB module memo.  This example\n  \
    \ is continued in the memo describing the PW-CEP-STD-MIB module (for\n   example,\

    \          \"A row in this table represents a pseudowire (PW) virtual\n      \
    \     connection across a packet network.  It is indexed by\n           pwIndex,\
    \ which uniquely identifies a singular\n           connection.\n           A row\
    \ can be created by an operator command from a\n           management plan of\
    \ a PE, by signaling, or due to auto-\n           discovery process.  An operator's\
    \ command can be issued via\n           a non-SNMP application; in such case,\
    \ a row will be created\n           implicitly by the agent.\n           The read-create\
    \ objects in this table are divided into\n           three categories:\n     \
    \      1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation.\n           \
    \   These are objects that define basic properties of the\n              PW (for\
    \ example type, destination, etc.).\n           2) Objects that MAY be changed\
    \ when the PW is\n              defined as not active.  A change of these objects\
    \ involves\n              re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting.\n\
    \              PW not active is defined as one of the following\n            \
    \  conditions:\n                  a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2).\n   \
    \               b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3).\n                  c) The pwAdminStatus\
    \ is down(2).\n           If the operator needs to change one of the values for\
    \ an\n           active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to\n\
    \           notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2).\n           Signaling\
    \ (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting\n           the pwRowStatus to\
    \ active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus\n           to up(1) or testing(3), respectively.\n\
    \           3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time.\n           A PW MAY have\
    \ an entry in the ifTable in addition to the\n           entry in this table.\
    \  In this case, a special ifType for PW\n           will be set in the ifTable,\
    \ and the ifIndex in the ifTable\n           of the PW will be set in the pwIfIndex\
    \ object in this table.\n           By default, all the read-create objects MUST\
    \ NOT be\n           changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated\n\
    \           in the individual object description.\n           Manual entries in\
    \ this table SHOULD be preserved after a\n           reboot; the agent MUST ensure\
    \ the integrity of those\n           entries.  If the set of entries of a specific\
    \ row are found\n           to be inconsistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus\
    \ MUST\n           be declared as notPresent(5).\n           \"\n     INDEX  {\

- title: 13.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "13.  Security Considerations\n   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially\
    \ useful for monitoring\n   PW-capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used\
    \ for configuration\n   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured\
    \ can be\n   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.\n  \
    \ There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\n   with\
    \ a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may\
    \ be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.  The\
    \ support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper protection\
    \ can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  These are the tables\
    \ and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  the pwTable contains\
    \ objects to configure PW parameters on a\n      Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized\
    \ access to objects in this\n      table could result in disruption of traffic\
    \ on the network.  The\n      objects pwUpDownNotifEnable and pwNotifRate control\
    \ the reports\n      from the network element to the EMS.  Unauthorized access\
    \ to these\n      objects could result in disruption of configuration and status\n\
    \      change reporting, resulting mis-view of the network conditions.\n     \
    \ The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be\n      considered\
    \ where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST\n      be used with\
    \ any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.\n      Administrators should consider\
    \ whether read access to these\n      objects should be allowed, since read access\
    \ may be undesirable\n      under certain circumstances.\n   Some of the readable\
    \ objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  the pwTable, pwPerfCurrentTable, pwPerfIntervalTable,\n\
    \      pwPerf1DayIntervalTable, pwIndexMappingTable, pwPeerMappingTable,\n   \
    \   and pwGenFecIndexMappingTable collectively show the pseudowire\n      connectivity\
    \ topology and its performance characteristics.  If an\n      administrator does\
    \ not want to reveal this information, then these\n      tables should be considered\
    \ sensitive/vulnerable.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate\
    \ security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n\
    \   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed\
    \ to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB\
    \ module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features\
    \ as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including\
    \ full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
