    \   (ULE) is a low-power air interface technology that is proposed by the\n  \
    \ DECT Forum and is defined and specified by ETSI.\n   The DECT air interface\
    \ technology has been used worldwide in\n   communication devices for more than\
    \ 20 years.  It has primarily been\n   used to carry voice for cordless telephony\

    \ recent addition to the DECT interface primarily\n   intended for low-bandwidth,\
    \ low-power applications such as sensor\n   devices, smart meters, home automation,\
    \ etc.  As the DECT ULE\n   interface inherits many of the capabilities from DECT,\
    \ it benefits\n   from operation that is long-range and interference-free, worldwide-\n\
    \   reserved frequency band, low silicon prices, and maturity.  There is\n   an\
    \ added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE,\n   such\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) is a\
    \ standard\n   series [EN300.175-part1-7] specified by ETSI, and CAT-iq (Cordless\n\
    \   Advanced Technology - internet and quality) is a set of product\n   certification\
    \ and interoperability profiles [CAT-iq] defined by DECT\n   Forum.  DECT Ultra\
    \ Low Energy (DECT ULE or just ULE) is an air\n   interface technology building\
    \ on the key fundamentals of traditional\n   DECT/CAT-iq but with specific changes\
    \ to significantly reduce the\n   power consumption at the expense of data throughput.\
    \  DECT ULE\n   devices with requirements on power consumption, as specified by\
    \ ETSI\n   in [TS102.939-1] and [TS102.939-2], will operate on special power-\n\
    \   optimized silicon but can connect to a DECT Gateway supporting\n   traditional\
    \ DECT/CAT-iq for cordless telephony and data as well as\n   the ULE extensions.\n\
    \   DECT terminology has two major role definitions: the Portable Part\n   (PP)\
    \ is the power-constrained device while the Fixed Part (FP) is the\n   Gateway\
    \ or base station.  This FP may be connected to the Internet.\n   An example of\
    \ a use case for DECT ULE is a home-security sensor\n   transmitting small amounts\
    \ of data (few bytes) at periodic intervals\n   through the FP but that is able\
    \ to wake up upon an external event\n   (e.g., a break-in) and communicate with\
    \ the FP.  Another example\n   incorporating both DECT ULE and traditional CAT-iq\
    \ telephony would be\n   a pendant (brooch) for the elderly that generally transmits\
    \ periodic\n   status messages to a care provider using very little battery, but\
    \ in\n   the event of an emergency, the elderly person can establish a voice\n\
    \   connection through the pendant to an alarm service.  It is expected\n   that\
    \ DECT ULE will be integrated into many residential gateways, as\n   many of these\
    \ already implement DECT CAT-iq for cordless telephony.\n   DECT ULE can be added\
    \ as a software option for the FP.\n   It is desirable to consider IPv6 for DECT\
    \ ULE devices due to the\n   large address space and well-known infrastructure.\
    \  This document\n   describes how IPv6 is used on DECT ULE links to optimize\
    \ power while\n   maintaining the many benefits of IPv6 transmission.  [RFC4944],\n\
    \   [RFC6282], and [RFC6775] specify the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE\n   802.15.4.\
    \  DECT ULE has many characteristics similar to those of IEEE\n   802.15.4, but\
    \ it also has differences.  A subset of mechanisms\n   defined for transmission\
    \ of IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 can be applied to\n   the transmission of IPv6 on\
    \ DECT ULE links.\n   This document specifies how to map IPv6 over DECT ULE inspired\
    \ by\n   [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775], and [RFC7668].\n"

    \ that is designed to\n   support both circuit-switched services, such as voice\
    \ communication,\n   and packet-mode data services at a modest data rate.  This\
    \ document\n   is only addressing the packet-mode data service of DECT ULE.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The DECT ULE Protocol Stack
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The DECT ULE Protocol Stack\n   The DECT ULE Protocol Stack contains a\
    \ PHY layer operating at\n   frequencies in the 1880 - 1920 MHz frequency band\
    \ depending on the\n   region and uses a symbol rate of 1.152 Mbaud.  Radio bearers\
    \ are\n   allocated by use of FDMA/TDMA/TDD techniques.\n   In its generic network\
    \ topology, DECT is defined as a cellular\n   network technology.  However, the\
    \ most common configuration is a star\n   network with a single FP defining the\
    \ network with a number of PPs\n   attached.  The MAC layer supports both traditional\
    \ DECT circuit mode\n   operation, as this is used for services like discovery,\
    \ pairing,\n   security features, etc., and it supports new ULE packet-mode\n\
    \   operation.  The circuit-mode features have been reused from DECT.\n   The\
    \ DECT ULE device can switch to the ULE mode of operation,\n   utilizing the new\
    \ ULE MAC layer features.  The DECT ULE Data Link\n   Control (DLC) provides multiplexing\
    \ as well as segmentation and\n   reassembly for larger packets from layers above.\
    \  The DECT ULE layer\n   also implements per-message authentication and encryption.\
    \  The DLC\n   layer ensures packet integrity and preserves packet order, but\n\
    \   delivery is based on best effort.\n   The current DECT ULE MAC layer standard\
    \ supports low-bandwidth data\n   broadcast.  However, this document is not considering\
    \ usage of the\n   DECT ULE MAC layer broadcast service for IPv6 over DECT ULE.\n\
    \   In general, communication sessions can be initiated from both the FP\n   side\
    \ and the PP side.  Depending on power-down modes employed in the\n   PP, latency\
    \ may occur when initiating sessions from the FP side.  MAC\n   layer communication\
    \ can take place using either connection-oriented\n   packet transfer with low\
    \ overhead for short sessions or connection-\n   oriented bearers including media\
    \ reservation.  The MAC layer\n   autonomously selects the radio-spectrum positions\
    \ that are available\n   within the band and can rearrange these to avoid interference.\
    \  The\n   MAC layer has built-in retransmission procedures in order to improve\n\
    \   transmission reliability.\n   The DECT ULE device will typically incorporate\
    \ an Application\n   Programming Interface (API), as well as common elements known\
    \ as\n   Generic Access Profiles (GAPs), for enrolling into the network.  The\n\
    \   DECT ULE Stack establishes a Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) for the\n   application\
    \ layers and provides support for a range of different\n   application protocols.\
    \  The application protocol is negotiated\n   between the PP and FP when the PVC\
    \ communication service is\n   established.  [TS102.939-1] defines this negotiation\
    \ and specifies an\n   Application Protocol Identifier set to 0x06 for 6LoWPAN.\
    \  This\n   document defines the behavior of that application protocol.\n    \

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Link Layer Roles and Topology\n   An FP is assumed to be less constrained\
    \ than a PP.  Hence, in the\n   primary scenario, the FP and PP will act as 6LBR\
    \ and a 6LN,\n   respectively.  This document only addresses this primary scenario,\n\
    \   and all other scenarios with different roles of an FP and PP are out\n   of\
    \ scope.\n   In DECT ULE, at the link layer, the communication only takes place\n\
    \   between an FP and a PP.  An FP is able to handle multiple\n   simultaneous\
    \ connections with a number of PPs.  Hence, in a DECT ULE\n   network using IPv6,\
    \ a radio hop is equivalent to an IPv6 link and\n   vice versa (see Section 3.3).\n\

- title: 2.3.  Addressing Model
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Addressing Model\n   Each DECT PP is assigned an IPEI during manufacturing.\
    \  This identity\n   has the size of 40 bits and is globally unique within DECT\
    \ addressing\n   space and can be used to constitute the MAC address used to derive\n\
    \   the IID for link-local address.\n   During a DECT location registration procedure,\
    \ the FP assigns a\n   20-bit TPUI to a PP.  The FP creates a unique mapping between\
    \ the\n   assigned TPUI and the IPEI of each PP.  This TPUI is used for\n   addressing\
    \ (Layer 2) in messages between the FP and PP.  Although the\n   TPUI is temporary\
    \ by definition, many implementations assign the same\n   value repeatedly to\
    \ any given PP, hence it seems not suitable for\n   construction of the IID (see\
    \ [RFC8065]).\n   Each DECT FP is assigned an RFPI during manufacturing.  This\
    \ identity\n   has the size of 40 bits and is globally unique within DECT addressing\n\
    \   space and can be used to constitute the MAC address used to derive\n   the\
    \ IID for link-local address.\n   Optionally, each DECT PP and DECT FP can be\
    \ assigned a unique (IEEE)\n   MAC-48 address in addition to the DECT identities\
    \ to be used by the\n   6LoWPAN.  During the address registration of non-link-local\
    \ addresses\n   as specified by this document, the FP and PP can use such MAC-48\
    \ to\n   construct the IID.  However, as these addresses are considered as\n \
    \  being permanent, such a scheme is NOT RECOMMENDED as per [RFC8065].\n"
- title: 2.4.  MTU Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.4.  MTU Considerations\n   Ideally, the DECT ULE FP and PP may generate data\
    \ that fits into a\n   single MAC layer packet (38 octets) for periodically transferred\n\
    \   information, depending on application.  However, IP packets may be\n   much\
    \ larger.  The DECT ULE DLC procedures natively support\n   segmentation and reassembly\
    \ and provide any MTU size below 65536\n   octets.  The default MTU size defined\
    \ in DECT ULE [TS102.939-1] is\n   500 octets.  In order to support complete IPv6\
    \ packets, the DLC layer\n   of DECT ULE SHALL, per this specification, be configured\
    \ with an MTU\n   size of 1280 octets, hence [RFC4944] fragmentation/reassembly\
    \ is not\n   required.\n   It is important to realize that the usage of larger\
    \ packets will be\n   at the expense of battery life, as a large packet inside\
    \ the DECT ULE\n   Stack will be fragmented into several or many MAC layer packets,\
    \ each\n   consuming power to transmit/receive.  The increased MTU size does not\n\
    \   change the MAC layer packet and PDU size.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Additional Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Additional Considerations\n   The DECT ULE standard allows the PP to be\
    \ DECT-registered (bound) to\n   multiple FP and to roam between them.  These\
    \ FP and their 6LBR\n   functionalities can operate either individually or connected\
    \ through\n   a Backbone Router as per [BACKBONE-ROUTER].\n"
- title: 3.  Specification of IPv6 over DECT ULE
  contents:
  - "3.  Specification of IPv6 over DECT ULE\n   Before any IP-layer communications\
    \ can take place over DECT ULE,\n   DECT-ULE-enabled nodes such as 6LNs and 6LBRs\
    \ have to find each other\n   and establish a suitable link layer connection.\
    \  The obtain-access-\n   rights registration and location registration procedures\
    \ are\n   documented by ETSI in the specifications [EN300.175-part1-7],\n   [TS102.939-1],\
    \ and [TS102.939-2].\n   DECT ULE technology sets strict requirements for low\
    \ power\n   consumption and, thus, limits the allowed protocol overhead. 6LoWPAN\n\
    \   standards [RFC4944], [RFC6775], and [RFC6282] provide useful\n   functionality\
    \ for reducing overhead that can be applied to DECT ULE.\n   This functionality\
    \ comprises link-local IPv6 addresses and stateless\n   IPv6 address autoconfiguration,\
    \ Neighbor Discovery, and header\n   compression.\n   The ULE 6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer can run directly on this U-plane DLC\n   layer.  Figure 3 illustrates\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Link Model\n   The general model is that IPv6 is Layer 3 and DECT ULE MAC\
    \ and DECT\n   ULE DLC are Layer 2.  DECT ULE already implements fragmentation\
    \ and\n   reassembly functionality; hence, the fragmentation and reassembly\n\
    \   function described in [RFC4944] MUST NOT be used.\n   After the FPs and PPs\
    \ have connected at the DECT ULE level, the link\n   can be considered up and\
    \ IPv6 address configuration and transmission\n   can begin.  The 6LBR ensures\
    \ address collisions do not occur.\n   Per this specification, the IPv6 header\
    \ compression format specified\n   in [RFC6282] MUST be used.  The IPv6 payload\
    \ length can be derived\n   from the ULE DLC packet length.  The possibly elided\
    \ IPv6 address can\n   be reconstructed from the lower layer address (see Section\
    \ 3.2.4).\n   Due to the DECT ULE star topology (see Section 2.2), each PP has\
    \ a\n   separate link to the FP; thus, the PPs cannot directly hear one\n   another\
    \ and cannot talk to one another.  As discussed in [RFC4903],\n   conventional\
    \ usage of IPv6 anticipates IPv6 subnets spanning a single\n   link at the link\
    \ layer.  In order to avoid the complexity of\n   implementing a separate subnet\
    \ for each DECT ULE link, a Multi-Link\n   Subnet model [RFC4903] has been chosen,\
    \ specifically Non-Broadcast\n   Multi-Access (NBMA) at Layer 2.  Because of this,\
    \ link-local\n   multicast communications can happen only within a single DECT\
    \ ULE\n   connection; thus, 6LN-to-6LN communications using link-local\n   addresses\
    \ are not possible. 6LNs connected to the same 6LBR have to\n   communicate with\
    \ each other utilizing the shared prefix used on the\n   subnet.  The 6LBR forwards\
    \ packets sent by one 6LN to another.\n"

    \ (see\n   Section 2.3) that were used for establishing the underlying DECT ULE\n\

    \ the\n   IPv6 link-local 64-bit Interface Identifiers (IIDs) for 6LN and 6LBR,\n\
    \   respectively.\n   The rule for deriving IIDs from DECT device addresses is\
    \ as follows:\n   the DECT device addresses that consist of 40 bits each MUST\
    \ be\n   expanded with leading zero bits to form 48-bit intermediate\n   addresses.\
    \  The most significant bit in this newly formed 48-bit\n   intermediate address\
    \ is set to one for addresses derived from the\n   RFPI and set to zero for addresses\
    \ derived from the IPEI. 64-bit IIDs\n   are derived from these intermediate 48-bit\
    \ addresses following the\n   guidance in Appendix A of [RFC4291].  However, because\
    \ DECT and IEEE\n   address spaces are different, this intermediate address cannot\
    \ be\n   considered to be unique within an IEEE address space.  In the derived\n\
    \   IIDs, the Universal/Local (U/L) bit (7th bit) will be zero, which\n   indicates\
    \ that derived IIDs are not globally unique, see [RFC7136].\n   For example, from\
    \ RFPI=11.22.33.44.55, the derived IID is\n   80:11:22:ff:fe:33:44:55; from IPEI=01.23.45.67.89,\

    \ outside the subnet domain.\n   As defined in [RFC4291], the IPv6 link-local\

    \ be renewed regularly.  The generated\n   security keys (UAK and session security\
    \ keys) are individual for each\n   FP-PP binding; hence, all PPs in a system\
    \ have different security\n   keys.  DECT ULE PPs do not use any shared encryption\
    \ key.\n   Even though DECT ULE offers link layer security, it is still\n   recommended\
    \ to use secure transport or application protocols above\n   6LoWPAN.\n   From\
    \ the privacy point of view, the IPv6 link-local address\n   configuration described\
    \ in Section 3.2.1 only reveals information\n   about the 6LN to the 6LBR that\
    \ the 6LBR already knows from the link\n   layer connection.  For non-link-local\
    \ IPv6 addresses, by default, a\n   6LN SHOULD use a randomly generated IID, for\
    \ example, as discussed in\n   [RFC8064], or use alternative schemes such as Cryptographically\n\
    \   Generated Addresses (CGAs) [RFC3972], privacy extensions [RFC4941],\n   Hash-Based\
    \ Addresses (HBAs, [RFC5535]), or static, semantically\n   opaque addresses [RFC7217].\n"

  - "6.  ETSI Considerations\n   ETSI is standardizing a list of known application-layer\
    \ protocols\n   that can use the DECT ULE permanent virtual circuit packet data\n\
    \   service.  Each protocol is identified by a unique known identifier,\n   which\
    \ is exchanged in the service-change procedure as defined in\n   [TS102.939-1].\
    \  The IPv6/6LoWPAN as described in this document is\n   considered to be an application-layer\
    \ protocol on top of DECT ULE.\n   In order to provide interoperability between\
    \ 6LoWPAN / DECT ULE\n   devices, a common protocol identifier for 6LoWPAN is\
    \ standardized by\n   ETSI.\n   The ETSI DECT ULE Application Protocol Identifier\
    \ is set to 0x06 for\n   6LoWPAN [TS102.939-1].\n"
