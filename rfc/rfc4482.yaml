  - "1.  Introduction\n   Presence information facilitates communication; its usefulness
    can be\n   enhanced by providing basic information about a presentity or\n   contact.
    \ This specification describes a basic set of information\n   elements that allow
    a watcher to retrieve additional information\n   about a presentity or contact.\n
    \  This specification defines extensions to the PIDF [9] Extensible\n   Markup
    Language [7][8][10] (XML) document format.\n   We describe elements for providing
    a \"business card\", references to\n   the homepage, map, representative sound,
    display name, and an icon.\n   This additional presence information can be used
    in PIDF [9]\n   documents, together with Rich Presence Information Data format
    [11]\n   (RPID), future-status [12], and other PIDF extensions.\n   All elements
    extend the <person> or, less commonly, <tuple> element\n   in the presence data
    model [13].  The <tuple> element is only\n   extended with Contact Information
    for the Presence Information Data\n   format (CIPID) elements if the information
    describes a service\n   referring to another person that is marked by an RPID
    <relationship>\n   element with a value other than 'self'.  All elements described
    in\n   this document are optional.\n   RPID and CIPID both provide \"rich\" presence
    that goes beyond the\n   basic 'open' and 'closed' status information in PIDF.
    \ The presence\n   information described in these two documents can be supplied\n
    \  independently, although in practice, both will often appear in the\n   same
    PIDF document.  CIPID elements describe the more static aspects\n   of somebody's
    presence information, while RPID focuses on elements\n   that will likely change
    throughout the day.  Thus, CIPID information\n   can often be statically configured
    by the user through the graphical\n   user interface of a presence client; this
    is less likely to be\n   sufficient for RPID.\n   The namespace URI for these
    elements defined by this specification is\n   a URN [2], using the namespace identifier
    'ietf' defined by [4] and\n   extended by [6]:\n      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid\n"

  - "2.  Terminology and Conventions\n   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT,\n   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted\n
    \  as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology and Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.  CIPID Elements\n   Unless otherwise noted below, each element may only appear
    at most\n   once.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Card Element\n   The <card> element includes a URI pointing to a business
      card, e.g.,\n   in LDAP Data Interchange Format [15] (LDIF) or vCard [14] format.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Card Element
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Display-Name Element\n   The <display-name> element includes the name
      identifying the tuple or\n   person that the presentity suggests should be shown
      by the watcher\n   user interface.  It is left to the watcher user interface
      design to\n   choose whether to heed this suggestion or to use some other suitable\n
      \  string.  The CIPID information MAY contain multiple display names,\n   but
      only if they are labeled with different 'xml:lang' attributes.\n   This allows
      a Korean-speaking presentity to convey its display name\n   in different languages,
      Latin and Hangul, for example.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Display-Name Element
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Homepage Element\n   The <homepage> element provides a URI pointing to
      general information\n   about the tuple or person, typically a web home page.\n"
    title: 3.3.  Homepage Element
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Icon Element\n   The <icon> element provides a URI pointing to an image
      (icon)\n   representing the tuple or person.  The watcher can use this\n   information
      to represent the tuple or person in a graphical user\n   interface.  Presentities
      SHOULD provide images of sizes and aspect\n   ratios that are appropriate for
      rendering as an icon.  Support for\n   JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats is REQUIRED.\n"
    title: 3.4.  Icon Element
  - contents:
    - "3.5.  Map Element\n   The <map> element provides a URI pointing to a map related
      to the\n   tuple or person.  The watcher can use this information to represent\n
      \  the tuple or person in a graphical user interface.  The map may be\n   either
      an image, an HTML client-side image map, or a geographical\n   information system
      (GIS) document, e.g., encoded as GML.  Support for\n   images formatted as PNG
      and GIF is REQUIRED.\n"
    title: 3.5.  Map Element
  - contents:
    - "3.6.  Sound Element\n   The <sound> element provides a URI pointing to a sound
      related to the\n   tuple or person.  The watcher MAY use the sound object, such
      as a\n   MIDI or MP3 file, referenced by the URL to inform the watcher that\n
      \  the presentity has assumed the status OPEN.  Implementors are advised\n   to
      create user interfaces that provide the watcher with the\n   opportunity to
      choose whether to play such sounds.  Support for\n   sounds coded as MPEG-2
      Layer 3 (MP3) is RECOMMENDED.  The sound\n   object might also be used to indicate
      how to pronounce the\n   presentity's name.\n"

  - "7.  Internationalization Considerations\n   CIPID delivers only URLs, except
    for the <display-name> element.  The\n   resolution of the URLs can negotiate
    appropriate language and\n   character sets within the URL-designated protocol.\n
    \  For the display name and to handle Internationalized Resource\n   Identifiers
    (IRIs) [16], since CIPID is represented in XML, it\n   provides native support
    for encoding information using the Unicode\n   character set and its more compact
    representations including UTF-8.\n   Conformant XML processors recognize both
    UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though\n   XML includes provisions to identify and use other
    character encodings\n   through use of an \"encoding\" attribute in an <?xml?>
    declaration, use\n   of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED in environments where parser encoding
    support\n   incompatibility exists.\n   The XML 'xml:lang' attribute can be used
    to identify the language and\n   script for the <display-name> element.  The specification
    allows\n   multiple occurrences of this element so that the presentity can\n   convey
    display names in multiple scripts and languages.  If no 'xml:\n   lang' attribute
    is provided, the default value is \"i-default\" [3].\n"
  title: 7.  Internationalization Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security issues are similar to those for
    RPID [11].  Watchers\n   need to restrict which content types of content pointed
    to by <icon>,\n   <homepage>, <map>, <sound>, and <vcard> elements they render.\n
    \  Also, when a watcher accesses these URIs, the presentity may deduce\n   that
    the watcher is currently using the presence application.  Thus,\n   a presence
    application concerned about leaking this information may\n   want to cache these
    objects for later use.  (A presentity could\n   easily customize the URLs for
    each watcher, so that it can tell who\n   is referencing the objects.)  This caching
    behavior may cause the\n   information to become stale, out-of-sync with the current
    data until\n   the cache is refreshed.  Fortunately, the elements in CIPID are\n
    \  expected to retain the same content for periods measured in days, so\n   that
    privacy-conscious applications may well decide to perform\n   caching over durations
    that reveal little current activity\n   information.  Presentities need to keep
    in mind that clients may\n   cache the content referenced by URIs for long periods
    as they use\n   their presence system to construct presence documents using this\n
    \  extension.  If the referenced content needs to change frequently, the\n   presentity
    could, for example, update the presence document with a\n   new URI to encourage
    clients to notice.\n   Icons and other URIs in this document could be used as
    a covert\n   channel to convey messages to the watcher, outside the content\n
    \  monitoring that might be in place for instant messages or other\n   communications
    channels.  Thus, entities that worry about such\n   channels may want to prohibit
    the usage of URLs pointing to resources\n   outside their domain, for example.\n
    \  Implementors must take care to adhere to the mechanisms for verifying\n   the
    identity in the referenced server's certificate against the URI.\n   For instance,
    if the URI scheme is https, the requirements of RFC\n   2818 [5], section 3.1,
    must be met.  In particular, the domain\n   represented in the URI must match
    the subjectAltName in the\n   certificate presented by the referenced server.
    \ If this identity\n   check fails, the referenced content SHOULD NOT be retrieved
    and MUST\n   NOT be used.\n"
