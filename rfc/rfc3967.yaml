- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may\
    \ not\n   have a normative reference to another standards track document at a\n\
    \   lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other\n  \
    \ than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a\n   standards\
    \ track document may not have a normative reference to an\n   informational RFC.\
    \  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as\n   the IETF uses informational\
    \ RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or\n   IETF-specific modes of use of such\
    \ standards.  This document\n   clarifies and updates the procedure used in these\
    \ circumstances.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Standards Process [RFC2026] Section 4.2.4 specifies\
    \ the\n   following:\n      Standards track specifications normally must not depend\
    \ on other\n      standards track specifications which are at a lower maturity\
    \ level\n      or on non standards track specifications other than referenced\n\
    \      specifications from other standards bodies.\n   One intent is to avoid\
    \ creating a perception that a standard is more\n   mature than it actually is.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that Best Current Practice documents\n   [RFC1818]\
    \ have generally been considered similar to Standards Track\n   documents in terms\
    \ of what they can reference.  For example, a\n   normative reference to an Experimental\
    \ RFC has been considered an\n   improper reference per [RFC2026].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Normative References
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Normative References\n   Within an RFC, references to other documents fall\
    \ into two general\n   categories: \"normative\" and \"informative\".  Broadly\
    \ speaking, a\n   normative reference specifies a document that must be read to\
    \ fully\n   understand or implement the subject matter in the new RFC, or whose\n\
    \   contents are effectively part of the new RFC, as its omission would\n   leave\
    \ the new RFC incompletely specified.  An informative reference\n   is not normative;\
    \ rather, it provides only additional background\n   information.\n   An exact\
    \ and precise definition of what is (and is not) a normative\n   reference has\
    \ proven challenging in practice, as the details and\n   implications can be subtle.\
    \  Moreover, whether a reference needs to\n   be normative can depend on the context\
    \ in which a particular RFC is\n   being published in the first place.  For example,\
    \ in the context of\n   an IETF Standard, it is important that all dependent pieces\
    \ be\n   clearly specified and available in an archival form so that there is\n\
    \   no disagreement over what constitutes a standard.  This is not always\n  \
    \ the case for other documents.\n   The rest of this section provides guidance\
    \ on what might (and might\n   not) be considered normative in the context of\
    \ the IETF standards\n   process.\n   In the IETF, it is a basic assumption that\
    \ implementors must have a\n   clear understanding of what they need to implement\
    \ in order to be\n   fully compliant with a standard and to be able to interoperate\
    \ with\n   other implementations of that standard.  For documents that are\n \
    \  referenced, any document that includes key information an implementer\n   needs\
    \ would be normative.  For example, if one needs to understand a\n   packet format\
    \ defined in another document in order to fully implement\n   a specification,\
    \ the reference to that format would be normative.\n   Likewise, if a reference\
    \ to a required algorithm is made, the\n   reference would be normative.\n   Some\
    \ specific examples:\n   -  If a protocol relies on IPsec to provide security,\
    \ one cannot\n      fully implement the protocol unless the specification for\
    \ IPsec is\n      available; hence, the reference would be normative.\n      The\
    \ referenced specification would likely include details about\n      specific\
    \ key management requirements, which transforms are\n      required and which\
    \ are optional, etc.\n   -  In MIB documents, an IMPORTS clause by definition\
    \ is a normative\n      reference.\n   -  When a reference to an example is made,\
    \ such a reference need not\n      be normative.  For example, text such as \"\
    an algorithm such as the\n      one specified in [RFCxxxx] would be acceptable\"\
    \ indicates an\n      informative reference, since that cited algorithm is just\
    \ one of\n      several possible algorithms that could be used.\n"
- title: 2.  The Need for Downward References
  contents:
  - "2.  The Need for Downward References\n   There are a number of circumstances\
    \ in which an IETF document may\n   need to make a normative reference to a document\
    \ at a lower maturity\n   level, but such a reference conflicts with Section 4.2.4\
    \ of\n   [RFC2026].  For example:\n   o  A standards track document may need to\
    \ refer to a protocol or\n      algorithm developed by an external body but modified,\
    \ adapted, or\n      profiled by an IETF informational RFC, for example, MD5 [RFC1321]\n\
    \      and HMAC [RFC2104].  Note that this does not override the IETF's\n    \
    \  duty to see that the specification is indeed sufficiently clear to\n      enable\
    \ creation of interoperable implementations.\n   o  A standards document may need\
    \ to refer to a proprietary protocol,\n      and the IETF normally documents proprietary\
    \ protocols using\n      informational RFCs.\n   o  A migration or co-existence\
    \ document may need to define a\n      standards track mechanism for migration\
    \ from, and/or co-existence\n      with, an historic protocol, a proprietary protocol,\
    \ or possibly a\n      non-standards track protocol.\n   o  There are exceptional\
    \ procedural or legal reasons that force the\n      target of the normative reference\
    \ to be an informational or\n      historical RFC or to be at a lower standards\
    \ level than the\n      referring document.\n   o  A BCP document may want to\
    \ describe best current practices for\n      experimental or informational specifications.\n"
- title: 3.  The Procedure to Be Used
  contents:
  - "3.  The Procedure to Be Used\n   For Standards Track or BCP documents requiring\
    \ normative reference to\n   documents of lower maturity, the normal IETF Last\
    \ Call procedure will\n   be issued, with the need for the downward reference\
    \ explicitly\n   documented in the Last Call itself.  Any community comments on\
    \ the\n   appropriateness of downward references will be considered by the IESG\n\
    \   as part of its deliberations.\n   Once a specific down reference to a particular\
    \ document has been\n   accepted by the community (e.g., has been mentioned in\
    \ several Last\n   Calls), an Area Director may waive subsequent notices in the\
    \ Last\n   Call of down references to it.  This should only occur when the same\n\
    \   document (and version) are being referenced and when the AD believes\n   that\
    \ the document's use is an accepted part of the community's\n   understanding\
    \ of the relevant technical area.  For example, the use\n   of MD5 [RFC1321] and\
    \ HMAC [RFC2104] is well known among\n   cryptographers.\n   This procedure should\
    \ not be used if the proper step is to move the\n   document to which the reference\
    \ is being made into the appropriate\n   category.  It is not intended as an easy\
    \ way out of normal process.\n   Rather, the procedure is intended for dealing\
    \ with specific cases\n   where putting particular documents into the required\
    \ category is\n   problematic and unlikely ever to happen.\n"
