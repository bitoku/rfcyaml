  - "1.  Introduction\n   Sometimes an IP Multicast Distribution Tree (MDT) traverses
    both\n   MPLS-enabled and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network.  Typically,\n
    \  the MDT begins and ends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an\n   MPLS
    region.  In such cases, it can be useful to begin building the\n   MDT as a pure
    IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label\n   Switched Path (LSP) when
    it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then\n   convert it back to a pure IP MDT
    when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled\n   region.  Other documents specify the procedures
    for building such a\n   hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
    in the non-\n   MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution\n
    \  Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends the\n   procedures
    from [RFC6826] to handle the case where the link\n   connecting the two regions
    is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)\n   table link, as defined in the \"BGP
    IP/MPLS VPN\" specification\n   [RFC6513].  However, this document is primarily
    aimed at particular\n   use cases where VRFs are used to support multicast applications
    other\n   than multicast VPN.\n   In PIM, a tree is identified by a source address
    (or in the case of\n   bidirectional trees [RFC5015], a rendezvous point address
    or \"RPA\")\n   and a group address.  The tree is built from the leaves up, by\n
    \  sending PIM control messages in the direction of the source address\n   or
    the RPA.  In mLDP, a tree is identified by a root address and an\n   \"opaque
    value\", and is built by sending mLDP control messages in the\n   direction of
    the root.  The procedures of [RFC6826] explain how to\n   convert a PIM <source
    address or RPA, group address> pair into an\n   mLDP <root node, opaque value>
    pair and how to convert the mLDP <root\n   node, opaque value> pair back into
    the original PIM <source address\n   or RPA, group address> pair.\n   However,
    the procedures in [RFC6826] assume that the routers doing\n   the PIM/mLDP conversion
    have routes to the source address or RPA in\n   their global routing tables.  Thus,
    the procedures cannot be applied\n   exactly as specified when the interfaces
    connecting the non-MPLS-\n   enabled region to the MPLS-enabled region are interfaces
    that belong\n   to a VRF as described in [RFC4364].  This specification extends
    the\n   procedures of [RFC6826] so that they may be applied in the VRF\n   context.\n
    \  As in [RFC6826], the scope of this document is limited to the case\n   where
    the multicast content is distributed in the non-MPLS-enabled\n   regions via PIM-created
    source-specific or bidirectional trees.\n   Bidirectional trees are always mapped
    onto multipoint-to-multipoint\n   LSPs, and source-specific trees are always mapped
    onto point-to-\n   multipoint LSPs.\n   Note that the procedures described herein
    do not support non-\n   bidirectional PIM Any-Source Multicast (ASM) groups, do
    not support\n   the use of multicast trees other than mLDP multipoint LSPs in
    the\n   core, and do not provide the capability to aggregate multiple PIM\n   trees
    onto a single multipoint LSP.  If any of those features are\n   needed, they can
    be provided by the procedures of [RFC6513] and\n   [RFC6514].  However, there
    are cases where multicast services are\n   offered through interfaces associated
    with a VRF, and where mLDP is\n   used in the core, but where aggregation is not
    desired.  For example,\n   some service providers offer multicast content to their
    customers,\n   but have chosen to use VRFs to isolate the various customers and\n
    \  services.  This is a simpler scenario than one in which the customers\n   provide
    their own multicast content, out of the control of the\n   service provider, and
    can be handled with a simpler solution.  Also,\n   when PIM trees are mapped one-to-one
    to multipoint LSPs, it is\n   helpful for troubleshooting purposes to have the
    PIM source/group\n   addresses encoded into the mLDP FEC (Forwarding Equivalence
    Class)\n   element in what this document terms \"mLDP in-band signaling\".\n   In
    order to use the mLDP in-band signaling procedures for a\n   particular group
    address in the context of a particular set of VRFs,\n   those VRFs MUST be configured
    with a range of multicast group\n   addresses for which mLDP in-band signaling
    is to be enabled.  This\n   configuration is per VRF defined in [RFC4364]).  For
    those groups,\n   and those groups only, the procedures of this document are used.
    \ For\n   other groups, the general-purpose multicast VPN procedures MAY be\n
    \  used, although it is more likely this VRF is dedicated to mLDP in-\n   band
    signaling procedures and all other groups are discarded.  The\n   configuration
    MUST be present in all PE routers that attach to sites\n   containing senders
    or receivers for the given set of group addresses.\n   Note that because the provider
    most likely owns the multicast content\n   and the method of transportation across
    the network, which are both\n   transparent to the end user, no coordination needs
    to happen between\n   the end user and the provider.\n"

  - "2.  VRF In-Band Signaling for MP LSPs\n   Suppose that a PE router, PE1, receives
    a PIM Join(S,G) message over\n   one of its interfaces that is associated with
    a VRF.  Following the\n   procedure of Section 5.1 of [RFC6513], PE1 determines
    the \"upstream\n   RD\", the \"upstream PE\", and the \"upstream multicast hop\"
    (UMH) for\n   the source address S.\n   In order to transport the multicast tree
    via a multipoint (MP) LSP\n   using VRF in-band signaling, an mLDP Label Mapping
    message is sent by\n   PE1.  This message will contain either a P2MP FEC or an
    MP2MP FEC\n   (see [RFC6388]), depending upon whether the PIM tree being\n   transported
    is a source-specific tree, or a bidirectional tree,\n   respectively.  The FEC
    contains a \"root\" and an \"opaque value\".\n   If the UMH and the upstream PE
    have the same IP address (i.e., the\n   upstream PE is the UMH), then the root
    of the multipoint FEC is set\n   to the IP address of the upstream PE.  If, in
    the context of this\n   VPN, (S,G) refers to a source-specific MDT, then the values
    of S, G,\n   and the upstream RD are encoded into the opaque value.  If, in the\n
    \  context of this VPN, G is a bidirectional group address, then S is\n   replaced
    with the value of the RPA associated with G.\n   The encoding details are specified
    in Section 3.  Conceptually, the\n   multipoint FEC can be thought of as an ordered
    pair:\n   {root=<Upstream-PE>; opaque_value=<S or RPA , G, Upstream-RD>}.  The\n
    \  mLDP Label Mapping message is then sent by PE1 on its LDP session to\n   the
    \"next hop\" on the message's path to the upstream PE.  The \"next\n   hop\" is
    usually the directly connected next hop, but see [RFC7060]\n   for cases in which
    the next hop is not directly connected.\n   If the UMH and the upstream PE do
    not have the same IP address, the\n   procedures of Section 2 of [RFC6512] should
    be applied.  The root\n   node of the multipoint FEC is set to the UMH.  The recursive
    opaque\n   value is then set as follows: the root node is set to the upstream\n
    \  PE, and the opaque value is set to the multipoint FEC described in\n   the
    previous paragraph.  That is, the multipoint FEC can be thought\n   of as the
    following recursive ordered pair: {root=<UMH>;\n   opaque_value=<root=Upstream-PE,
    opaque_value=<S or RPA, G,\n   Upstream-RD>>}.\n   The encoding of the multipoint
    FEC also specifies the \"type\" of PIM\n   MDT being spliced onto the multipoint
    LSP.  Four opaque encodings are\n   defined in [RFC6826]: IPv4 source-specific
    tree, IPv6 source-specific\n   tree, IPv4 bidirectional tree, and IPv6 bidirectional
    tree.\n   When a PE router receives an mLDP message with a P2MP or MP2MP FEC,\n
    \  where the PE router itself is the root node, and the opaque value is\n   one
    of the types defined in Section 3, then it uses the RD encoded in\n   the opaque
    value field to determine the VRF context.  (This RD will\n   be associated with
    one of the PEs VRFs.)  Then, in the context of\n   that VRF, the PE follows the
    procedure specified in section 2 of\n   [RFC6826].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The same security considerations apply as for
    the base LDP\n   specification, described in [RFC5036], and the base mLDP\n   specification,
    described in [RFC6388].\n   Operators MUST configure packet filters to ensure
    that the mechanism\n   described in this memo does not cause non-global-scoped
    IPv6\n   multicast packets to be tunneled outside of their intended scope.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   [RFC6388] defines a registry for the \"LDP MP Opaque
    Value Element\n   basic type\".  IANA has assigned four new code points in this\n
    \  registry:\n      Transit VPNv4 Source TLV type - 250\n      Transit VPNv6 Source
    TLV type - 251\n      Transit VPNv4 Bidir TLV type - 9\n      Transit VPNv6 Bidir
