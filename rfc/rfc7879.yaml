  - "1.1.  Overview\n   [RFC5763] describes how the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n\
    \   [RFC3261] can be used to establish a Secure Real-time Transport\n   Protocol\
    \ (SRTP) [RFC3711] security context with the Datagram\n   Transport Layer Security\
    \ (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347].  It describes a\n   mechanism for transporting a\
    \ certificate fingerprint using the\n   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].\
    \  The fingerprint\n   identifies the certificate that will be presented during\
    \ the DTLS\n   handshake.  DTLS-SRTP is currently defined for point-to-point media\n\
    \   sessions, in which there are exactly two participants.  Each DTLS-\n   SRTP\
    \ session (described in Section 3 of [RFC5764]) contains a single\n   DTLS connection\
    \ (if RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) are\n   multiplexed) or two DTLS connections\
    \ (if RTP and RTCP are not\n   multiplexed), and either two SRTP contexts (if\
    \ media traffic is\n   flowing in both directions on the same 5-tuple) or one\
    \ SRTP context\n   (if media traffic is only flowing in one direction).\n   In\
    \ many SIP deployments, SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUA)\n   entities exist\
    \ on the SIP-signaling path between the endpoints.  As\n   described in [RFC7092],\
    \ these B2BUAs can modify SIP and SDP\n   information.  For example, as described\
    \ in Section 3.1.3 of\n   [RFC7092], SDP-modifying signaling-only B2BUAs can potentially\
    \ modify\n   the SDP.  B2BUAs can also be present on the media path, in which\
    \ case\n   they modify parts of the SDP information (like IP address, port) and\n\
    \   subsequently modify the RTP headers as well.  Such B2BUAs are\n   referred\
    \ to as \"media-plane B2BUAs\".  [RFC7092] describes two\n   different categories\
    \ of media-plane B2BUAs, according to the level of\n   activities performed on\
    \ the media plane.\n   When B2BUAs are present in a call between two SIP User\
    \ Agents (UAs),\n   they often make end-to-end DTLS-SRTP sessions impossible.\
    \  An \"end-\n   to-end DTLS-SRTP session\" means that man-in-the-middle devices\
    \ cannot\n   break the DTLS-SRTP session between the endpoints.  In other words,\n\
    \   the man-in-the-middle device cannot create a separate DTLS-SRTP\n   session\
    \ between the client and the middle device on one side, and the\n   middle device\
    \ and the remote peer on the other side.  B2BUAs may be\n   deployed for address\
    \ hiding or media latching [RFC7362], although\n   Traversal Using Relays around\
    \ NAT (TURN) and Interactive Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE) are expected\
    \ to be used more often for this\n   purpose as it provides better security properties.\
    \  Such B2BUAs are\n   able to perform their functions without requiring termination\
    \ of\n   DTLS-SRTP sessions, i.e., these B2BUAs need not act as DTLS proxy and\n\
    \   decrypt the RTP payload.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Goals and Scope of this Document
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Goals and Scope of this Document\n   A B2BUA could be deployed for address\
    \ hiding or media latching as\n   described in [RFC7362].  Such B2BUAs only terminate\
    \ the media plane\n   at the IP and transport (UDP/TCP) layers and may inspect\
    \ the RTP\n   headers or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets.  The goal of this\n\
    \   specification is to provide guidance on how such B2BUAs function\n   without\
    \ breaking the end-to-end DTLS-SRTP session.  A B2BUA could\n   also terminate\
    \ the media, or modify the RTP headers or RTP Control\n   Protocol (RTCP) packets.\
    \  Such B2BUAs will not allow end-to-end DTLS-\n   SRTP.  The recommendations\
    \ made in this document are not expected to\n   be applied by B2BUAs terminating\
    \ DTLS-SRTP sessions given deployment\n   reality.\n   This specification assumes\
    \ that a B2BUA is not providing identity\n   assurance and is not authorized to\
    \ terminate the DTLS-SRTP session.\n   A B2BUA that provides identity assurance\
    \ on behalf of endpoints\n   behind it can modify any portion of SIP and SDP before\
    \ it generates\n   the identity signature.  As the B2BUA is generating the identity\n\
    \   signature, it is not possible to detect if a B2BUA has terminated the\n  \
    \ DTLS-SRTP session.  B2BUAs providing identity assurance and\n   terminating\
    \ DTLS-SRTP sessions are out of scope of this document.\n   The following sections\
    \ describe the behavior B2BUAs can follow to\n   avoid breaking end-to-end DTLS-SRTP\
    \ sessions.\n"

- title: 3.  B2BUAs Procedures to Allow End-to-End DTLS-SRTP
  contents:
  - "3.  B2BUAs Procedures to Allow End-to-End DTLS-SRTP\n   A B2BUA MUST follow the\
    \ rules mentioned below to allow end-to-end\n   DTLS-SRTP sessions.\n   1.  B2BUAs\
    \ MUST forward the certificate fingerprint and SDP setup\n       attribute it\
    \ receives from one endpoint unmodified towards the\n       other endpoint and\
    \ vice versa.\n   2.  The enhancements described in [RFC4474] provide a means\
    \ for\n       signing portions of SIP requests in order to provide identity\n\
    \       assurance and certificate pinning by providing an identity\n       signature\
    \ over the SDP that carries the fingerprint of keying for\n       DTLS-SRTP [RFC5763].\
    \  B2BUAs can identify that the enhancements\n       in [RFC4474] are used for\
    \ identity assurance if the SIP request\n       contains both Identity and Identity-Info\
    \ headers.  In cases where\n       endpoints use [RFC4474], B2BUAs MUST ensure\
    \ that it does not\n       modify any of the information used to construct the\
    \ identity\n       signature.  This includes the entire SDP body and portions\
    \ of the\n       SIP header as described in [RFC4474].  In this case, a B2BUA\n\
    \       cannot act as a media-relay B2BUA.\n   3.  [SIP-ID] is introduced to overcome\
    \ the limitations of [RFC4474]\n       (discussed in Section 1 of [SIP-ID]). \
    \ Unlike [RFC4474], [SIP-ID]\n       does not generate an identity signature over\
    \ material that\n       intermediaries in the field commonly alter.  In this case,\
    \ a\n       B2BUA can act as a media-relay B2BUA.  B2BUAs can identify that\n\
    \       [SIP-ID] is used for identity assurance if the SIP request\n       contains\
    \ an Identity header but does not include an Identity-Info\n       header.  The\
    \ Identity-Info header is deprecated in [SIP-ID].  A\n       B2BUA MUST ensure\
    \ that it does not modify any of the headers used\n       to construct the identity\
    \ signature.\n   4.  Both media relays and media-aware relays MUST NOT modify\
    \ the\n       authenticated portion of RTP and RTCP packets, and MUST NOT\n  \
    \     modify the authentication tag in the RTP and RTCP packets.\n"

    \ in Section 3.\n"

    \ to\n   perform their function and still allow end-to-end DTLS-SRTP sessions\n\

    \ modified.\n"

    \  Such B2BUAs are likely to violate\n   rule 2 or rule 3 in Section 3.  Depending\
    \ upon the application\n   requirements, such a B2BUA may be able to limit modification\

    \ Figure 1: INVITE with SDP Call Flow for Media-Relay B2BUA\n   Note: For brevity,\
    \ the entire value of the SDP fingerprint attribute\n   is not shown.  The example\
    \ here shows only one DTLS connection for\n   the sake of simplicity.  In reality,\
    \ depending on whether the RTP and\n   RTCP flows are multiplexed or demultiplexed,\
    \ there will be one or two\n   DTLS connections.\n   If RTP and RTCP traffic is\
    \ multiplexed on a single port as described\n   in [RFC5761], then only a single\
    \ DTLS connection is required between\n   the peers.  If RTP and RTCP are not\
    \ multiplexed, then the peers would\n   have to establish two DTLS connections.\
    \  In this case, after\n   receiving an INVITE request, Bob triggers the establishment\
    \ of a DTLS\n   connection.  Note that the DTLS handshake and the sending of the\n\
    \   INVITE response can happen in parallel; thus, the B2BUA has to be\n   prepared\
    \ to receive DTLS, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN),\n   and media on\
    \ the ports it advertised to Bob in the SDP offer before\n   it receives an SDP\
    \ answer from Bob. Since a media-relay B2BUA does\n   not differentiate between\
    \ a DTLS message, RTP, or any packet it\n   receives, it only changes the transport\
    \ layer (UDP/TCP) and IP\n   headers and forwards the packet towards the other\
    \ endpoint.  The\n   B2BUA cannot decrypt the RTP payload, as the payload is encrypted\n\
    \   using the SRTP keys derived from the DTLS connection setup between\n   Alice\
    \ and Bob.\n   If the endpoints use [RFC4474], a B2BUA cannot function as a media-\n\
    \   relay without violating rule 2 in Section 3.  If [SIP-ID] is used, a\n   B2BUA\

    \ is aware of the type\n   of media traffic it is receiving.  There are two types\
    \ of media-aware\n   relays, those that merely inspect the RTP headers and unencrypted\n\
    \   portions of RTCP packets, and those that inspect and modify the RTP\n   headers\

    \ terminate the DTLS-SRTP\n   session, and decrypt/re-encrypt RTP packets.  If\
    \ a B2BUA modifies\n   unencrypted or encrypted portions of the RTP or RTCP packets,\
    \ then\n   the integrity check will fail and the packet will be dropped by the\n\

    \ are integrity protected using the HMAC algorithm negotiated\n   during the DTLS\
    \ handshake (discussed in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5764]).\n   B2BUAs have to follow\

  contents:
  - "6.  Forking Considerations\n   Due to forking [RFC3261], a SIP request carrying\
    \ an SDP offer sent by\n   an endpoint (offerer) can reach multiple remote endpoints.\
    \  As a\n   result, multiple DTLS-SRTP sessions can be established, one between\n\
    \   the endpoint that sent the SIP request and each of the remote\n   endpoints\
    \ that received the request.  B2BUAs have to follow rule 1 in\n   Section 3 while\
    \ handling offer/answer and forward the certificate\n   fingerprints and SDP setup\
    \ attributes it received in the SDP answer\n   from each endpoint (answerer) unmodified\
    \ towards the offerer.  Since\n   each DTLS connection is set up on a unique 5-tuple,\
    \ B2BUA replaces\n   the answerer's transport addresses in each answer with its\
    \ unique\n   transport addresses so that the offerer can establish a DTLS\n  \
    \ connection with each answerer.  The B2BUA, acting as a media relay\n   here,\
    \ follows rule 4 mentioned in Section 3.\n                                   \

    \ transport\n   addresses in each answer, as shown in Figure 2, where XXX and\
    \ YYY\n   represent different DTLS-SRTP sessions.  The B2BUA replaces Bob's\n\
    \   transport address (192.0.2.1:6666) in the answer with its transport\n   address\
    \ (192.0.2.3:7777) and Charlie's transport address\n   (192.0.2.2:6666) in the\
    \ answer with its transport address\n   (192.0.2.3:8888).  The B2BUA tracks the\
    \ remote sources (Bob and\n   Charlie) and associates them to the local sources\
    \ that are used to\n   send packets to Alice.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes the behavior B2BUAs must\
    \ follow to avoid\n   breaking end-to-end DTLS-SRTP.  Media relays that modify\
    \ RTP or RTCP,\n   or modify SIP header fields or SDP fields that are protected\
    \ by the\n   identity signature, are incompatible with end-to-end DTLS-SRTP. \
    \ Such\n   relays are out of scope for this document.  Security considerations\n\
    \   discussed in [RFC5763] are also applicable to this document.  In\n   addition,\
    \ the B2BUA behaviors outlined in this document do not impact\n   the security\
    \ and integrity of a DTLS-SRTP session or the data\n   exchanged over it.  A malicious\
    \ B2BUA can try to break into the DTLS\n   connection, but such an attack can\
    \ be prevented using the identity\n   validation mechanism discussed in [RFC4474]\
    \ or [SIP-ID].  Either the\n   endpoints or the authentication service proxies\
    \ involved in the call\n   can use the identity validation mechanisms discussed\
    \ in [RFC4474] or\n   [SIP-ID] to validate the identity of peers and detect malicious\n\
    \   B2BUAs that can attempt to terminate the DTLS connection to decrypt\n   the\
    \ RTP payload.\n"
