  - "Abstract\n   There are ongoing activities in the networking community to develop\n\
    \   solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous\n   wired\

    \  Intelligent access selection, taking into account link-layer\n   attributes,\

    \ protocol requirements for this\n   signalling have both transport and security\
    \ issues that must be\n   considered.  The signalling must not be constrained\
    \ to specific link\n   types, so there is at least a common component to the signalling\n\
    \   problem, which is within the scope of the IETF.  This document\n   presents\
    \ a problem statement for this core problem.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides a problem statement for the exchange\
    \ of\n   information to support handover in heterogeneous link environments\n\
    \   [1].  This mobility support service allows more sophisticated\n   handover\
    \ operations by making available information about network\n   characteristics,\
    \ neighboring networks and associated characteristics,\n   indications that a\
    \ handover should take place, and suggestions for\n   suitable target networks\
    \ to which to handover.  The mobility support\n   services are complementary to\
    \ IP mobility mechanisms [4], [5], [6],\n   [7], [8], [9] to enhance the overall\
    \ performance and usability\n   perception.\n   There are two key attributes to\
    \ the handover support service problem\n   for inter-technology handovers:\n \
    \  1. The Information: the information elements being exchanged.  The\n      \
    \ messages could be of a different nature, such as information,\n       commands\
    \ to perform an action, or events informing of a change,\n       potentially being\
    \ defined following a common structure.\n   2. The Underlying Transport: the transport\
    \ mechanism to support\n       exchange of the information elements mentioned\
    \ above.  This\n       transport mechanism includes information transport, discovery\
    \ of\n       peers, and the securing of this information over the network.\n \
    \  The initial requirement for this protocol comes from the need to\n   provide\
    \ a transport for the Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol\n   being defined\
    \ by IEEE 802.21 [1], which is not bound to any specific\n   link layer and can\
    \ operate over more that one network-layer hop.  The\n   solution should be flexible\
    \ to accommodate evolution in the MIH\n   standard, and should also be applicable\
    \ for other new mobility\n   signalling protocols that have similar message patterns\
    \ and discovery\n   and transport requirements.\n   The structure of this document\
    \ is as follows.  Section 3 defines\n   Mobility Services.  Section 4 provides\
    \ a simple model for the\n   protocol entities involved in the signalling and\
    \ their possible\n   relationships.  Section 5 describes a decomposition of the\
    \ signalling\n   problem into service-specific parts and a generic transport part.\n\
    \   Section 5.2 describes more detailed requirements for the transport\n   component.\
    \  Section 6 provides security considerations.  Section 7\n   summarizes the conclusions\
    \ and open issues.\n"

- title: 3.  Definition of Mobility Services
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Mobility Services\n   As mentioned in the Introduction, mobility\
    \ (handover) support in\n   heterogeneous wireless environments requires functional\
    \ components\n   located either in the mobile terminal or in the network to exchange\n\
    \   information and eventually to make decisions upon this information\n   exchange.\
    \  For instance, traditional host-based handover solutions\n   could be complemented\
    \ with more sophisticated network-centric\n   solutions.  Also, neighborhood discovery,\
    \ potentially a complex\n   operation in heterogeneous wireless scenarios, can\
    \ result in a\n   simpler step if implemented with a unified interface towards\
    \ the\n   access network.\n   In this document, the different supporting functions\
    \ for Media\n   Independent Handover (MIH) management are generally referred to\
    \ as\n   Mobility Services (MoS) that have different requirements for the\n  \
    \ transport protocol.  These requirements and associated\n   functionalities are\
    \ the focus of this document.  Speaking 802.21\n   terminology, MoS can be regarded\
    \ as Information Services (IS), Event\n   Services (ES), and Command Service (CS).\n"

    \ the following sections.\n      Note: while MN-to-MN signalling exchanges are\
    \ theoretically\n      possible, these are not currently being considered.\n \
    \  The following scenarios are discussed for understanding the overall\n   problem\
    \ of transporting MIH protocol.  Although these are all\n   possible scenarios\
    \ and MIH services can be delivered through\n   link-layer specific solutions\
    \ and/or through a \"layer 3 or above\"\n   protocol, this problem statement focuses\
    \ on the delivery of\n   information for Mobility Services only for the latter\
    \ case.\n"

- title: 5.2.  Requirements on the Mobility Service Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Requirements on the Mobility Service Transport Layer\n   The following\
    \ section outlines some of the general transport\n   requirements that should\
    \ be supported by the Mobility Service\n   Transport Protocol.  Analysis has suggested\
    \ that at least the\n   following need to be taken into account:\n   Discovery:\
    \  MNs need the ability to either discover nodes that\n      support certain services\
    \ or discover services provided by a\n      certain node.  The service discovery\
    \ can be dealt with using\n      messages as defined in [1].  This section refers\
    \ to node-discovery\n      in either scenario.  There are no assumptions about\
    \ the location\n      of these Mobility Service nodes within the network.  Therefore,\n\
    \      the discovery mechanism needs to operate across administrative\n      boundaries.\
    \  Issues such as speed of discovery, protection against\n      spoofing, when\
    \ discovery needs to take place, and the length of\n      time over which the\
    \ discovery information may remain valid; all\n      need to be considered.  Approaches\
    \ include:\n      *  Hard coding information into the MN, indicating either the\
    \ IP\n         address of the NN, or information about the NN that can be\n  \
    \       resolved onto an IP address.  The configuration information\n        \
    \ could be managed dynamically, but assumes that the NN is\n         independent\
    \ of the access network to which the MN is currently\n         attached.\n   \
    \   *  Pushing information to the MN, where the information is\n         delivered\
    \ to the MN as part of other configuration operations,\n         for example,\
    \ via DHCP or Router Discovery exchange.  The\n         benefit of this approach\
    \ is that no additional exchanges with\n         the network would be required,\
    \ but the limitations associated\n         with modifying these protocols may\
    \ limit applicability of the\n         solution.\n      *  MN dynamically requesting\
    \ information about a node, which may\n         require both MN and NN support\
    \ for a particular service\n         discovery mechanism.  This may require additional\
    \ support by\n         the access network (e.g., multicast or anycast) even when\
    \ it\n         may not be supporting the service directly itself.\n      Numerous\
    \ directory and configuration services already exist, and\n      reuse of these\
    \ mechanisms may be appropriate.  There is an open\n      question about whether\
    \ multiple methods of discovery would be\n      needed, and whether NNs would\
    \ also need to discover other NNs.\n      The definition of a service also needs\
    \ to be determined, including\n      the granularity of the description.  For\
    \ example, IEEE 802.21\n      specifies three different types of Mobility Services\
    \ (Information\n      Services, Command Services, and Event Services) that can\
    \ be\n      located in different portions of the network.  An MN could\n     \
    \ therefore run a discovery procedure of any service running in the\n      (home\
    \ or visited) network or could run a discovery procedure for a\n      specific\
    \ service.\n   Information from a trusted source:  The MN uses the Mobility Service\n\
    \      information to make decisions about what steps to take next.  It\n    \
    \  is essential that there is some way to ensure that the information\n      received\
    \ is from a trustworthy source.  This requirement should\n      reuse trust relationships\
    \ that have already been established in\n      the network, for example, on the\
    \ relationships established by the\n      Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\
    \ (AAA) infrastructure\n      after a mutual authentication, or on the certificate\n\
    \      infrastructure required to support SEND [10].  Section 6 provides\n   \
    \   a more complete analysis.\n   Security association management:  A common security\
    \ association\n      negotiation method, independent of any specific MSTP user,\
    \ should\n      be implemented between the endpoints of the MSTP.  The solution\n\
    \      must also work in the case of MN mobility.\n   Secure delivery:  The Mobility\
    \ Service information must be delivered\n      securely (integrity and confidentiality)\
    \ between trusted peers,\n      where the transport may pass though untrusted\
    \ intermediate nodes\n      and networks.  The Mobility Service information should\
    \ also be\n      protected against replay attacks and denial-of-service attacks.\n\
    \   Low latency:  Some of the Mobility Services generate time-sensitive\n    \
    \  information.  Therefore, there is a need to deliver the\n      information\
    \ over quite short timescales, and the required lifetime\n      of a connection\
    \ might be quite short-lived.  As an example, the\n      frequency of messages\
    \ defined in [1] varies according to the MIH\n      service type.  It is expected\
    \ that Events and Commands messages\n      arrive at an interval of hundreds of\
    \ milliseconds in order to\n      capture quick changes in the environment and/or\
    \ process handover\n      commands.  On the other hand, Information Service messages\
    \ are\n      mainly exchanged each time a new network is visited that may be in\n\
    \      the order of hours or days.  For reliable delivery, short-lived\n     \
    \ connections could be set up as needed, although there is a\n      connection\
    \ setup latency associated with this approach.\n      Alternatively, a long-lived\
    \ connection could be used, but this\n      requires advanced warning of being\
    \ needed and some way to maintain\n      the state associated with the connection.\
    \  It also assumes that\n      the relationships between devices supporting the\
    \ mobility service\n      are fairly stable.  Another alternative is connectionless\n\
    \      operation, but this has interactions with other requirements, such\n  \
    \    as reliable delivery.\n   Reliability:  Reliable delivery for some of the\
    \ Mobility Services may\n      be essential, but it is difficult to trade this\
    \ off against the\n      low latency requirement.  It is also quite difficult\
    \ to design a\n      robust, high-performance mechanism that can operate in\n\
    \      heterogeneous environments, especially one where the link\n      characteristics\
    \ can vary quite dramatically.  There are two main\n      approaches that could\
    \ be adopted:\n      1. Assume the transport cannot be guaranteed to support reliable\n\
    \         delivery.  In this case, the Mobility Support Service itself\n     \
    \    will have to provide a reliability mechanism (at the MIH level)\n       \
    \  to allow communicating endpoints to acknowledge receipt of\n         information.\n\
    \      2. Assume the underlying transport will provide reliable delivery.\n  \
    \       There is no need in this case to provide reliability at the MIH\n    \
    \     level.\n      Guidelines provided in [3] are being considered while writing\
    \ this\n      document.\n   Congestion Control:  A Mobility Service may wish to\
    \ transfer small or\n      large amounts of data, placing different requirements\
    \ for\n      congestion control in the transport.  As an example, the MIH\n  \
    \    message [1] size varies widely from about 30 bytes (for a\n      broadcast\
    \ capability discovery request) to be normally less than\n      64 KB, but may\
    \ be greater than 64KB (for an IS MIH_Get_Information\n      response primitive).\
    \  A typical MIH message size for the Events\n      and Commands Services service\
    \ ranges between 50 to 100 bytes.  The\n      solution should consider different\
    \ congestion control mechanisms\n      depending on the amount of data generated\
    \ by the application (MIH)\n      as suggested in [3].\n   Fragmentation and reassembly:\
    \  ES and CS messages are small in\n      nature, are sent frequently, and may\
    \ wish trade reliability in\n      order to satisfy the tight latency requirements.\
    \  On the other\n      hand, IS messages are more resilient in terms of latency\n\
    \      constraints, and some long IS messages could exceed the MTU of the\n  \
    \    path to the destination.  Depending on the choice of the transport\n    \
    \  protocol, different fragmentation and reassembly strategies are\n      required.\n\
    \   Multihoming:  For some Information Services exchanged with the MN,\n     \
    \ there is a possibility that the request and response messages\n      could be\
    \ carried over two different links.  For example, a\n      handover command request\
    \ is on the current link while the response\n      could be delivered on the new\
    \ link.  It is expected that the\n      transport protocol is capable of receiving\
    \ information via\n      multiple links.  It is also expected that the MSTP user\
    \ combines\n      information belonging to the same session/transaction.  When\n\
    \      mobility is applied, the underlying IP mobility mechanism should\n    \
    \  provide session continuity when required.\n   IPv4 and IPv6 support:  The MSTP\
    \ must support both IPv4 and IPv6\n      including NAT traversal for IPv4 networks\
    \ and firewall\n      pass-through for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Network-supported Mobility Services aim at improving\
    \ decision making\n   and management of dynamically connected hosts.\n   Information\
    \ Services may not require authorization of the client, but\n   both Event and\
    \ Command Services may authenticate message sources,\n   particularly if they\
    \ are mobile.  Network-side service entities will\n   typically need to provide\
    \ proof of authority to serve visiting\n   devices.  Where signalling or radio\
    \ operations can result from\n   received messages, significant disruption may\
    \ result from processing\n   bogus or modified messages.  The effect of processing\
    \ bogus messages\n   depends largely upon the content of the message payload,\
    \ which is\n   handled by the handover services application.  Regardless of the\n\
    \   variation in effect, message delivery mechanisms need to provide\n   protection\
    \ against tampering, spoofing, and replay attacks.\n   Sensitive and identifying\
    \ information about a mobile device may be\n   exchanged during handover-service\
    \ message exchange.  Since handover\n   decisions are to be made based upon message\
    \ exchanges, it may be\n   possible to trace a user's movement between cells,\
    \ or predict future\n   movements, by inspecting handover service messages.  In\
    \ order to\n   prevent such tracking, message confidentiality and message integrity\n\
    \   should be available.  This is particularly important because many\n   mobile\
    \ devices are associated with only one user, since divulging of\n   such information\
    \ may violate the user's privacy.  Additionally,\n   identifying information may\
    \ be exchanged during security association\n   construction.  As this information\
    \ may be used to trace users across\n   cell boundaries, identity protection should\
    \ be available, if\n   possible, when establishing source addresses (SAs).\n \
    \  In addition, the user should not have to disclose its identity to the\n   network\
    \ (anymore than it needed to during authentication) in order to\n   access the\
    \ Mobility Support Services.  For example, if the local\n   network is just aware\
    \ that an anonymous user with a subscription to\n   \"example.com\" is accessing\
    \ the network, the user should not have to\n   divulge their true identity in\
    \ order to access the Mobility Support\n   Services available locally.\n   Finally,\
    \ the NNs themselves will potentially be subject to\n   denial-of-service attacks\
    \ from MNs, and these problems will be\n   exacerbated if operation of the Mobility\
    \ Service protocols imposes a\n   heavy computational load on the NNs.  The overall\
    \ design has to\n   consider at what stage (e.g., discovery, transport layer\n\
    \   establishment, and service-specific protocol exchange) denial-of-\n   service\
    \ prevention or mitigation should be built in.\n"
- title: 7.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "7.  Conclusions\n   This document outlined a broad problem statement for the\
    \ signalling\n   of information elements across a network to support Mobility\n\
    \   Services.  In order to enable this type of signalling service, a need\n  \
    \ for a generic transport solution with certain transport and security\n   properties\
    \ was outlined.  Whilst the motivation for considering this\n   problem has come\
    \ from work within IEEE 802.21, a desirable goal is to\n   ensure that solutions\
    \ to this problem are applicable to a wider range\n   of Mobility Services.\n\
    \   It would be valuable to establish realistic performance goals for the\n  \
    \ solution to this common problem (i.e., transport and security\n   aspects) using\
    \ experience from previous IETF work in this area and\n   knowledge about feasible\
    \ deployment scenarios.  This information\n   could then be used as an input to\
    \ other standards bodies in assisting\n   them to design Mobility Services with\
    \ feasible performance\n   requirements.\n   Much of the functionality required\
    \ for this problem is available from\n   existing IETF protocols or combination\
    \ thereof.  This document takes\n   no position on whether an existing protocol\
    \ can be adapted for the\n   solution or whether new protocol development is required.\
    \  In either\n   case, we believe that the appropriate skills for development\
    \ of\n   protocols in this area lie in the IETF.\n"
