  - "                   \"But my NCP costs $500 a day...\"\nNow that networking is\
    \ becoming commonplace, people are beginning to measure \nthe cost of their network\
    \ software and network use.  A not insignificant \nportion of this use turns out\
    \ to be random prodding and poking of one system\nby another.  An example of this\
    \ is the \"Survey\" mechanism that many sites are\nconstructing to see \"who's\
    \ up.\"  Several systems have noted that this one\nmechanism alone accounts for\
    \ a log of their overhead, and is not chargeable to\nany given user.\nIn response\
    \ to this particular problem, MIT-DMCG and UCLA-NMC, who have both\nbeen doing\
    \ surveys for some time, have agreed upon a standard format for host\nsurvey data\
    \ and will make it available to the network community.  They will be\njoined by\
    \ a third site, and will provide a standard socket to obtain this\ninformation.\
    \  The data will be a concise character stream so as to be both\nhuman and machine\
    \ readable.\nThe exact format of the data and the socket number will be forthcoming.\n\
    The intent of all this is for all other sites to stop surveying on their own\n\
    and get this data from one of the participating \"Official Surveyors\" either\n\
    prompted by a user's request or on a periodic basis, whatever they wish.\nThis\
    \ should, itself, help considerably to eliminate a lot of the network\n'noise\
    \ factor.'  But, in addition, we should all try to be more aware of the\ncost\
    \ of this type of traffic and try to avoid repeated interactions with a\ngiven\
    \ Host without some expressed consent - be it an account number of some\nspecific\
    \ experiment.\n"
