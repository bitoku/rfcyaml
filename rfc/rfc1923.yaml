- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RIP Version 1 [RFC-1058] has been declared an historic document.\n\
    \   This Applicability statement provides the supporting motivation for\n   that\
    \ declaration.  The primary reason, as described below, is the\n   Classful nature\
    \ of RIPv1.\n"
- title: 1.0 Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.0 Introduction\n   RIP version 1 (RIPv1) (as defined by RFC 1058) was one of\
    \ the first\n   dynamic routing protocols used in the internet.  It was developed\
    \ as\n   a technique for passing around network reachability information for\n\
    \   what we now consider relatively simple topologies.\n   The Internet has changed\
    \ significantly since RIPv1 was defined,\n   particularly with the introduction\
    \ and use of subnets and CIDR.\n   While RIPv1 is widely used in private networks,\
    \ it can no longer be\n   considered applicable for use in the global Internet.\n"
- title: 2.0 RIPv1 restrictions
  contents:
  - "2.0 RIPv1 restrictions\n   RIPv1 has a number of restrictions and behaviors which\
    \ restrict its\n   useability in the global Internet.\n"
- title: 2.1 Classfulness
  contents:
  - "2.1 Classfulness\n   Chief among these is that it is a classful routing protocol.\
    \  RIP\n   packets do not carry prefix masks.  The prefix length is inferred\n\
    \   from the address.  For non-local addresses, the prefix is always the\n   \"\
    natural\" (classful) length. (e.g., 24 bits for a \"Class C\" network\n   address.)\
    \  For networks to which a local interface exists, if the\n   interface is subnetted\
    \ with some specific mask, then RIPv1 assumes\n   that the mask used locally is\
    \ the correct mask to apply for all\n   subnets of that network.\n   This has\
    \ a number of effects.\n   1) RIPv1 can not be used with variable length subnetting.\
    \  In the\n      presence of variable length subnetting it will consistently\n\
    \      misinterpret prefix lengths.\n   2) RIPv1 is difficult to use with supernetting.\
    \  All CIDR supernets\n      must be exploded and advertised to RIPv1 as individual\
    \ \"natural\"\n      classful advertisements.\n   3) Even when the networks running\
    \ RIPv1 are themselves only subnetted\n      in fixed ways, if the remainder of\
    \ the network has variable\n      subnetting then one must carefully make sure\
    \ that RIPv1 does not\n      destroy the mask information when it passes through\
    \ those subnets\n      running RIPv1.  Put another way, co-existence with mutual\n\
    \      information exchange between RIPv1 and more advanced routing\n      protocols\
    \ is problematic at best.  Note that this applies even when\n      the other routing\
    \ protocol is RIPv2.\n   4) The Internet will soon be making use of addresses\
    \ which appear to\n      RIPv1 to be parts of Class A networks. Networks using\
    \ RIPv1 may not\n      be able to reach all sites assigned the subsections of\
    \ a single A.\n"
- title: 2.2 Simple Distance Vector
  contents:
  - "2.2 Simple Distance Vector\n   RIPv1 is a simple distance vector protocol.  It\
    \ has been enhanced\n   with various techniques, including Split Horizon and Poison\
    \ Reverse\n   in order to enable it to perform better in somewhat complicated\n\
    \   networks.\n   However, being a simple distance vector protocol, it will run\
    \ into\n   difficulty. First and foremost, it will occasionally have to count\
    \ to\n   infinity in order to purge bad routes.  This delays the convergence\n\
    \   of routing.  In order to keep this short, RIPv1 defines infinity as\n   16\
    \ hops.  That means that networks with diameters larger than that\n   can not\
    \ use RIP.  Even getting close to that limit can cause\n   confusion for some\
    \ implementations.\n"
- title: 3.0 Conclusion
  contents:
  - "3.0 Conclusion\n   The recommendation of this Applicability statement is that\
    \ if there\n   is reason to run RIP in a network environment, one should use RIPv2\n\
    \   (RFC 1723).\n   RIPv1 itself should only be used in simple topologies, with\
    \ simple\n   reachability. It may be used by any site which uses fixed subnetting\n\
    \   internally, and either uses a default route to deal with external\n   traffic\
    \ or is not connected to the global Internet or to other\n   organizations.\n\
    \   RIPv1 may also be used as a local advertising technology if the\n   information\
    \ to be used fits within its capabilities.\n"
- title: 4.0 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.0 Security Considerations\n   RIPv1 includes no security functions.  RIPv2\
    \ includes a mechanism for\n   authenticating the sender of the routing information.\
    \  Sites which\n   are worried about the vulnerability of their routing infrastructure\n\
    \   and which feel they must run a RIP-like protocol should use RIPv2.\n"
