- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The OSPFv2 protocol specifies a Shortest Path First (SPF)\
    \ algorithm\n   that identifies transit vertices based on their adjacencies.\n\
    \   Therefore, OSPFv2 does not have a mechanism to prevent traffic\n   transiting\
    \ a participating node if it is a transit vertex in the only\n   existing or shortest\
    \ path to the destination.  The use of metrics to\n   make the node undesirable\
    \ can help to repel traffic only if an\n   alternative better route exists.\n\
    \   A mechanism to move traffic away from the shortest path is\n   particularly\
    \ useful for a number of use cases:\n   1.  Graceful isolation of a router, to\
    \ avoid blackhole scenarios when\n       there is a reload and possible long reconvergence\
    \ times.\n   2.  Closet switches that are not usually used for transit traffic\
    \ but\n       need to participate in the topology.\n   3.  Overloaded routers\
    \ that could use such a capability to\n       temporarily repel traffic until\
    \ they stabilize.\n   4.  BGP route reflectors, known as virtual Route Reflectors,\
    \ that are\n       not in the forwarding path but are in central locations such\
    \ as\n       data centers.  Such route reflectors are typically used for route\n\
    \       distribution and are not capable of forwarding transit traffic.\n    \
    \   However, they need to learn the OSPF topology to perform SPF\n       computation\
    \ for optimal routes and reachability resolution for\n       their clients [BGP-ORR].\n\
    \   This document describes the functionality provided by the Host-bit\n   (H-bit);\
    \ this functionality prevents other OSPFv2 routers from using\n   the host router\
    \ by excluding it in path calculations for transit\n   traffic in OSPFv2 routing\
    \ domains.  If the H-bit is set, then the\n   calculation of the shortest-path\
    \ tree for an area, as described in\n   Section 16.1 of [RFC2328], is modified\
    \ by including a check to verify\n   that transit vertices DO NOT have the H-bit\
    \ set (see Section 4).\n   Furthermore, in order to repel traffic effectively,\
    \ this document\n   updates [RFC6987] so that Type 2 External and Not-So-Stubby\
    \ Area\n   (NSSA) Link State Advertisements (LSAs) [RFC3101] are advertised with\n\
    \   a high cost (see Section 6).  OSPFv3 [RFC5340] defines an option bit,\n  \
    \ known as the R-bit, for router-LSAs; the H-bit supports similar\n   functionality.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Host-Bit Support\n   This document defines a new router-LSA bit, known as\
    \ the Host-bit or\n   the H-bit.  An OSPFv2 router advertising a router-LSA with\
    \ the H-bit\n   set indicates that it MUST NOT be used as a transit router (see\n\
    \   Section 4) by other OSPFv2 routers in the area that support the H-bit\n  \
    \ functionality.\n   If the H-bit is not set, then backward compatibility is achieved,\
    \ as\n   the behavior will be the same as in [RFC2328].\n      0             \

    \ 6 7\n                   Figure 2: OSPF Router-LSA Option Bits\n   When the H-bit\
    \ is set, the OSPFv2 router is a host (non-transit)\n   router and is incapable\
    \ of forwarding transit traffic.  In this mode,\n   the other OSPFv2 routers in\
    \ the area MUST NOT use the host router for\n   transit traffic but may send traffic\
    \ to its local destinations.\n   An OSPFv2 router originating a router-LSA with\
    \ the H-bit set MUST\n   advertise all its non-stub links with a link cost of\
    \ MaxLinkMetric\n   [RFC6987].\n   When the H-bit is set, an Area Border Router\
    \ (ABR) MUST advertise the\n   same H-bit setting in its self-originated router-LSAs\
    \ for all\n   attached areas.  The consistency of the setting will prevent\n \
    \  inter-area traffic transiting through the router by suppressing\n   advertisements\
    \ of prefixes from other routers in the area in its\n   summary-LSAs.  Only IPv4\
    \ prefixes associated with its local\n   interfaces MUST be advertised in summary-LSAs\
    \ to provide reachability\n   to end hosts attached to a router with the H-bit\
    \ set.\n   When the H-bit is set, the host router cannot act as an Autonomous\n\
    \   System Border Router (ASBR).  Indeed, ASBRs are transit routers to\n   prefixes\
    \ that are typically imported through redistribution of\n   prefixes from other\
    \ routing protocols.  Therefore, non-local IPv4\n   prefixes, e.g., those imported\
    \ from other routing protocols, SHOULD\n   NOT be advertised in AS-external-LSAs\
    \ if the H-bit is set.  Some use\n   cases, such as an overloaded router or a\
    \ router being gracefully\n   isolated, may benefit from continued advertisements\
    \ of non-local\n   prefixes.  In these cases, the Type 2 metric in AS-external-LSAs\
    \ MUST\n   be set to LSInfinity [RFC2328] to repel traffic (see Section 6 of\n\
    \   this document).\n"
- title: 4.  SPF Modifications
  contents:
  - "4.  SPF Modifications\n   The SPF calculation described in Section 16.1 of [RFC2328]\
    \ is\n   modified to ensure that the routers originating router-LSAs with the\n\
    \   H-bit set will not be used for transit traffic.  Step (2) is modified\n  \
    \ to include a check on the H-bit, as shown below.  (Please note that\n   all\
    \ of the sub-procedures of Step (2) remain unchanged and are not\n   included\
    \ in the excerpt below.)\n      (2)  Call the vertex just added to the tree \"\
    vertex V\".  Examine\n           the LSA associated with vertex V.  This is a\
    \ lookup in\n           Area A's link state database based on the Vertex ID. \
    \ If this\n           is a router-LSA, and the H-bit of the router-LSA is set,\
    \ and\n           vertex V is not the root, then the router should not be used\n\
    \           for transit and Step (3) should be executed immediately.  If\n   \
    \        this is a router-LSA and bit V of the router-LSA (see\n           Appendix\
    \ A.4.2) is set, set Area A's TransitCapability to\n           TRUE.  In any case,\
    \ each link described by the LSA gives the\n           cost to an adjacent vertex.\
    \  For each described link (say it\n           joins vertex V to vertex W):\n"
- title: 5.  Autodiscovery and Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Autodiscovery and Backward Compatibility\n   To reduce the possibility of\
    \ any routing loops due to partial\n   deployment, this document defines an OSPF\
    \ Router Information (RI) LSA\n   capability bit [RFC7770].  See Section 7 (Table\
    \ 2).\n   The RI LSA MUST be area-scoped.\n   Autodiscovery via announcement of\
    \ the OSPF Host Router capability\n   (Section 7) ensures that the H-bit functionality\
    \ and its associated\n   SPF changes MUST only take effect if all the routers\
    \ in a given OSPF\n   area support this functionality.\n   In normal operation,\
    \ it is possible that the RI LSA will fail to\n   reach all routers in an area\
    \ in a timely manner.  For example, if a\n   new router without H-bit support\
    \ joins an area that previously had\n   only H-bit-capable routers with the H-bit\
    \ set, then it may take some\n   time for the RI LSA to propagate to all routers.\
    \  While it is\n   propagating, the routers in the area will gradually detect\
    \ the\n   presence of a router that does not support the capability and will\n\
    \   revert back to the normal SPF calculation.  During the propagation\n   time,\
    \ the area as a whole is unsure of the status of the new router;\n   this type\
    \ of situation can cause temporary transient loops.\n   The following recommendations\
    \ will mitigate transient routing loops:\n   *  Implementations are RECOMMENDED\
    \ to provide a configuration\n      parameter to manually override enforcement\
    \ of the H-bit\n      functionality in partial deployments where the topology\
    \ guarantees\n      that OSPFv2 routers not supporting the H-bit do not compute\
    \ routes\n      resulting in routing loops.\n   *  All routers with the H-bit\
    \ set MUST advertise all of the router's\n      non-stub links with a metric equal\
    \ to MaxLinkMetric [RFC6987] in\n      its LSAs in order to prevent OSPFv2 routers\
    \ (unless a last-resort\n      path) that do not support the H-bit from attempting\
    \ to use the\n      non-stub links for transit traffic.\n   *  All routers supporting\
    \ the H-bit MUST check the RI LSAs of all\n      nodes in the area to verify that\
    \ all nodes support the H-bit\n      before actively using the H-bit feature.\
    \  If any router does not\n      advertise the OSPF Host Router capability (Section\
    \ 7), then the\n      SPF modifications described in Section 4 MUST NOT be used\
    \ in the\n      area.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  OSPF AS-External-LSAs / NSSA-LSAs with Type 2 Metrics\n   When calculating\
    \ the path to a prefix in an OSPF AS-external-LSA or\n   NSSA-LSA [RFC3101] with\
    \ a Type 2 metric, the advertised Type 2 metric\n   is taken as more significant\
    \ than the OSPF intra-area or inter-area\n   path.  Hence, advertising the links\
    \ with MaxLinkMetric as specified\n   in [RFC6987] does not discourage transit\
    \ traffic when calculating AS-\n   external or NSSA routes with Type 2 metrics.\n\
    \   Consequently, this document updates [RFC6987] so that the Type 2\n   metric\
    \ in any self-originated AS-external-LSAs or NSSA-LSAs is\n   advertised as LSInfinity-1\
    \ [RFC2328].  If the H-bit is set, then the\n   Type 2 metric MUST be set to LSInfinity.\n"

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces the H-bit, which is\
    \ a capability feature\n   that restricts the use of a router for transit, while\
    \ only its local\n   destinations are reachable.  This is a subset of the operations\
    \ of a\n   normal router and therefore should not introduce new security\n   considerations\
    \ beyond those already known in OSPFv2 [RFC2328].  The\n   feature introduces\
    \ the advertisement of host router capability\n   information to all OSPFv2 routers\
    \ in an area.  This information can\n   be leveraged for discovery and verification\
    \ that all routers in the\n   area support the capability before the feature is\
    \ turned on.  In the\n   event that a rogue or buggy router incorrectly advertises\
    \ its\n   capability, possible scenarios are as follows:\n   *  The router does\
    \ not have the capability but sends the H-bit set in\n      its LSAs.  In this\
    \ case, a routing loop is possible.  However,\n      this is mitigated by the\
    \ fact that this router should be avoided\n      anyway.  Moreover, the link metrics\
    \ cost (MaxLinkMetric) of this\n      router will mitigate this situation.  In\
    \ any case, a router\n      advertising the H-bit capability without its link\
    \ metrics cost\n      equal to MaxLinkMetric could be a rogue router and should\
    \ be\n      avoided.\n   *  The router has the capability but sends the H-bit\
    \ clear in its\n      LSAs.  In this case, the router merely prevents the support\
    \ of\n      other H-bit routers in the area and prevents all the routers from\n\
    \      running the modified SPF.  Any impacts are also mitigated in this\n   \
    \   scenario, as other H-bit routers in the area also advertise the\n      MaxLinkMetric\
    \ cost, so they will still be avoided unless they are\n      the last-resort path.\n\
    \   *  The rogue router is on the only transit path for some destinations\n  \
    \    and sends the H-bit set (for no good/valid reason) in its LSAs,\n      and\
    \ effectively partitions the network.  This case is\n      indistinguishable from\
    \ the normal case where an operator may\n      consciously decide to set the H-bit\
    \ to perform maintenance on a\n      router that is on the only transit path.\
    \  The OSPF protocol will\n      continue to function within the partitioned domains.\n"
