  - "Abstract\n   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers\n\
    \   only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with\n   routable\
    \ IP addresses, which are advertised in Link State\n   Advertisements (LSAs) but\
    \ are not needed for data traffic.  In\n   addition, remote attacks can be launched\
    \ against routers by sending\n   packets to these transit-only networks.  This\
    \ document presents a\n   mechanism to hide transit-only networks to speed up\
    \ network\n   convergence and reduce vulnerability to remote attacks.\n   In the\
    \ context of this document, 'hiding' implies that the prefixes\n   are not installed\
    \ in the routing tables on OSPF routers.  In some\n   cases, IP addresses may\
    \ still be visible when using OSPFv2.\n   This document updates RFCs 2328 and\
    \ 5340.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting\
    \ routers\n   only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with\n\
    \   routable IP addresses, which are advertised in LSAs but not needed\n   for\
    \ data traffic.  In addition, remote attacks can be launched\n   against routers\
    \ by sending packets to these transit-only networks.\n   This document presents\
    \ a mechanism to hide transit-only networks to\n   speed up network convergence\
    \ and reduce vulnerability to remote\n   attacks.\n   Hiding transit-only networks\
    \ will not impact reachability to the end\n   hosts.\n   In the context of this\
    \ document, 'hiding' implies that the prefixes\n   are not installed in the routing\
    \ tables on OSPF routers.  In\n   [OSPFv2], the IPv4 interface addresses are still\
    \ visible in the\n   Router-LSA links and the network-LSA Link-State ID (LSID).\
    \  In\n   [OSPFv3], the router-LSAs and network-LSAs do not contain IPv6\n   addresses\
    \ and are not visible.\n   This document updates [OSPFv2] and [OSPFv3] by specifying\
    \ a mechanism\n   that can be used to hide transit-only networks.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Hiding IPv6 Transit-Only Networks in OSPFv3\n   In [OSPFv3], addressing semantics\
    \ have been removed from the OSPF\n   protocol packets and the main LSA types,\
    \ leaving a network-protocol-\n   independent core.\n   More specifically, router-LSAs\
    \ and network-LSAs no longer contain\n   network addresses but simply express\
    \ topology information.  Instead,\n   two new LSA types, link-LSA and intra-area-prefix-LSA,\
    \ have been\n   introduced.  A link-LSA associates a list of IPv6 addresses to\
    \ a link\n   and has local-link flooding scope, and an intra-area-prefix-LSA\n\
    \   either associates a list of IPv6 addresses with a router by\n   referencing\
    \ a router-LSA or associates a list of IPv6 addresses with\n   a broadcast/NBMA\
    \ network by referencing a network-LSA.  In the latter\n   case, the prefixes\
    \ in the link-LSAs from adjacent neighbors are\n   copied into the intra-area-prefix-LSA\
    \ by the Designated Router.\n   To hide a transit-only network in [OSPFv3], the\
    \ IPv6 address prefixes\n   are omitted from the router-LSA.  Consequently, when\
    \ a Designated\n   Router builds an intra-area-prefix-LSA referencing a network-LSA,\n\
    \   these IPv6 address prefixes will be omitted.\n   In addition, when a router\
    \ builds an intra-area-prefix-LSA that is\n   referencing a router-LSA, the associated\
    \ IPv6 address prefixes from\n   the transit-only network MUST also be omitted\
    \ from the intra-area-\n   prefix-LSA.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Hiding AF-Enabled Transit-Only Networks in OSPFv3
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Hiding AF-Enabled Transit-Only Networks in OSPFv3\n   [OSPF-AF] supports\
    \ multiple Address Families (AFs) by mapping each AF\n   to a separate Instance\
    \ ID and OSPFv3 instance.\n   In the meantime, each prefix advertised in OSPFv3\
    \ has a prefix length\n   field [OSPFv3], which facilitates advertising prefixes\
    \ of different\n   lengths in different AFs.  The existing LSAs defined in [OSPFv3]\
    \ are\n   used for prefix advertising, and there is no need to define new LSAs.\n\
    \   In other words, as link-LSAs and intra-area-prefix-LSAs are still\n   being\
    \ used, the same mechanism explained in Section 3 can be used to\n   hide those\
    \ AF-enabled transit-only networks as well.\n"
- title: 4.  Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Considerations\n   By eliminating the ability to reach transit-only\
    \ networks, the\n   ability to manage these interfaces may be reduced.  In order\
    \ not to\n   reduce the functionality and capability of the overall network, it\
    \ is\n   recommended that extensions such as [UNNUMBERED] also be implemented.\n\
    \   Note that the extension defined in [UNNUMBERED] may provide the user\n   with\
    \ the IP address of an interface.  If that address was hidden, as\n   specified\
    \ in this document, then even though the address is assigned\n   to the interface,\
    \ it will not be reachable.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Forwarding Address
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Forwarding Address\n   A non-zero forwarding address can be advertised\
    \ in AS-external-LSAs\n   and Not-So-Stubby Area LSAs (NSSA-LSAs) [NSSA] to achieve\
    \ optimal\n   routing to Autonomous System (AS) external routes.  The matching\n\
    \   routing table entry for the forwarding address must exist to\n   facilitate\
    \ the SPF calculation.\n   In other words, when prefix-hiding is configured on\
    \ the next-hop\n   interface, the next-hop address MUST NOT be advertised as a\n\
    \   forwarding address.\n   Consequently, sub-optimal routing to these AS external\
    \ routes may\n   exist when prefix-hiding is configured.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Virtual Links
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Virtual Links\n   Virtual links are used to connect physically separate\
    \ components of\n   the backbone.  The virtual link's viability is determined\
    \ by the\n   existence of an intra-area path between two endpoints.  The matching\n\
    \   routing table entries of the endpoints must exist to ensure the\n   virtual\
    \ link's operation.\n   In other words, if prefix-hiding is configured on an interface,\
    \ the\n   virtual link endpoint MUST NOT use that interface's IP address as the\n\
    \   virtual interface's IP address.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Unnumbered Interfaces
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Unnumbered Interfaces\n   Note that no host route is generated for, and\
    \ no IP packets can be\n   addressed to, interfaces to unnumbered point-to-point\
    \ networks\n   [OSPFv2].  In other words, these addresses are already hidden.\n\
    \   However, for manageability purposes, it may be common practice to\n   manually\
    \ include the numbered interface (for example, a loopback\n   interface to which\
    \ the unnumbered interface points) in routing\n   updates.  If needed, the numbered\
    \ interface's address can be hidden\n   by using the mechanisms described in this\
    \ document or by simply not\n   advertising it.\n   Before deciding to hide (or\
    \ suppress the advertisement of) a numbered\n   interface, it is very important\
    \ to consider other uses that interface\n   may have.  Examples of common uses\
    \ may include virtual link endpoint,\n   inter-domain routing peering point, etc.\
    \  In other words, it may not\n   be possible to hide the address associated to\
    \ an unnumbered interface\n   due to other applications in the network.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   One motivation for this document is to reduce\
    \ vulnerability to remote\n   attacks by hiding transit-only networks.  The result\
    \ should then be\n   that fewer OSPF core networks will be exposed.\n   The mechanisms\
    \ described above result in reachability information\n   from transit-only networks\
    \ not being installed in the routers'\n   forwarding tables.  The effect is that\
    \ even if the address of a\n   transit-only network is known, the forwarding information\
    \ is not\n   present in the routers to reach the destination.  Also, in some\n\
    \   cases, the address information is completely omitted from the LSA.\n   Some\
    \ information in the LSA (such as the OSPF Router ID) cannot be\n   omitted. \
    \ Even though the Router ID may be taken from an IPv4 address\n   on the router,\
    \ the configuration can be easily changed.  Note again\n   that having an address\
    \ doesn't guarantee reachability if the\n   information is hidden from the forwarding\
    \ tables.\n   While the steps described in this document are meant to be applied\n\
    \   only to transit-only networks, they could be used to hide other\n   networks\
    \ as well.  It is expected that the same care that users put\n   into the configuration\
    \ of other routing protocol parameters is used\n   in the configuration of this\
    \ extension.\n"
