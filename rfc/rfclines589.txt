If CCN refuses an ICP to a NETRJS socket, it means either that there is no free core within the NCP region, or that CCN's software is crashing.
Once ICP is completed, CCN might send the user one of the fol  lowing messages and close the Telnet connections:
This may be expected occasionally; frequent occurrance should be reported to CCN User Relations (825 7548), or to BELL@CCN.
RJS NOT UP, TRY LATER 3.
Normally, however, the user will receive a READY message:
If the user sends no operator input for 3 minutes, CCN will send: NRJ308R SIGNON TIMEOUT EXCEEDED NRJ205R NETRJS SESSION TERMINATED and close the Telnet connection.
If he sends an invalid SIG  NON command, he will receive the message: NRJ307R INVALID SIGNON, RE ENTER 7
Finally, a valid signon will be acknowledged by RJS with the message: RJS750I TERMINAL  termid
If the user terminates the session by entering a SIGNOFF com  mand, NETRJS will wait until all data transfer has completed before sending the message:
NRJ205R NETRJS SESSION TERMINATED and closing the Telnet connection.

During data transfer, the user must be reasonably responsive.
If not, CCN will close the data transfer connection and send the remote operator message:
NRJ504I DATA TRANSFER TIMEOUT FOR THE  device ,
if  device  is PRINTER or PUNCH, user site stopped accepting bits (sending "allocates") for over 5 minutes.
if  device  is READER, user site left reader connection open without sending any bits for 5 minutes.
During data transfer on the CR connection, CCN may detect an incorrect header or record, presumably due to user site software or Network transmission error.
The following mes  sages beginning with the word "BAD" will follow an NRJ512I message containing the faulty header in hex: NRJ505I BAD HEADER SEQUENCE FOR NETRJS READER Sequence number in transaction header does not match internal counter of records passed.
NRJ506I BAD HEADER LENGTH FOR NETRJS READER Length
given in header exceeds 880 bytes.
NRJ507I BAD HEADER TYPE FOR NETRJS READER Type code in header is not X'FF'
NRJ511I BAD FILL BIT COUNT FOR NETRJS
The filler bit count in header is not a multiple of 8.
If the header is correct but a data record is faulty, the fol  lowing message will be sent to a remote user:
NRJ602I line STREAM ERROR READER,  code
A protocol error was detected in the READER stream.
CCN will close the stream and ready it to be reo  pened so the remote user may retry the data transfer operation.
id byte has high bit off.
In compressed text, string control byte has high bit off.
In compressed text, duplicate blank string extends line longer than 255 bytes.
In compressed text, duplicate character string extends line longer than 255 bytes.
In compressed text, character string extends line longer than 255 bytes.
Finally, if the user aborts his data transfer, he receives the message:
DATA TRANSFER ABORTED BY USER  termid .

The CCN operator can cancel a NETRJS session, aborting any open data transfer streams and sending the message:
NRJ204I NETRJS SESSION ABORTED BY CENTRAL OPERATOR,
Any of the following messages indicate a serious CCN Network software problem, and will cause the session to be aborted:
NRJ201A NETRJS DT SOCKET ERROR
PROGRAM CHECK IN  device , code ccc
NRJ209A NETRJS LOAD FAILED FOR  device , code xx NRJ304I
RJS LINE HANDLER DEAD NRJ401I
Any of these should be reported to CCN.
Besides global catastrophes like these above, the user might encounter a failure of a particular data transfer process.
These do not terminate the session, only cause the data con  nection to be refused or terminated; the user can try again to open the data connection.
Repeated failure should be reported to CCN.
NO CORE FOR DATA TRANSFER BUFFER  device
NO CORE FOR DATA TRANSFER
NO CORE FOR device DATA TRANSFER
Due to core memory limitations in CCN's NCP,  device  cannot be started now.
The data transfer connection indicated by  device  will be refused.
This may happen occasionally during active periods, but repeated occurrences should be reported to CCN.
NRJ510I  device  DATA TRANSFER DEAD NRJ602I line STREAM ERROR PRINTER,  code  NRJ602I line STREAM ERROR PUNCH,
CCN data transfer failed, but recovery may be possi  ble.
