Abstract This specification defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
In particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for both IPv4 and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798.
This memo obsoletes RFC 2787.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This specification defines a portion of the MIB for use with SNMP  based network management.
In particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Version 3 (VRRPv3) for both IPv4 and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798 [RFC5798].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document obsoletes RFC 2787
The major changes in this document reflect changes in the VRRP protocol between RFC 2338 [RFC2338] and RFC 5798 [RFC5798].
This document is also updated to conform to current MIB conventions.
Relation to Interface Group (IF MIB)
Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in the VRRP MIB.
This MIB module imports ifIndex from the IF MIB.
At this time, the latest version of the IF MIB is from RFC 2863
This MIB module is designed to support multi stack implementations that run VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6.
The IP version, Virtual Router Identifier (VRID), and ifIndex are used to uniquely identify rows in a multi stack implementation.
Interpretation of RFC 5798 During the review of this document, it emerged that there are different possible interpretations of [RFC5798].
The authors of that document and the VRRP working group were unable to reach consensus as to which interpretation is correct.
This document makes the following assumption: IPv4 and IPv6 virtual routers are treated as two separate logical entities and represented as two separate entries in the vrrpv3OperationsTable.
This is required due to the undefined behavior of the protocol in [RFC5798] in a multi stack scenario.
VRRP MIB Structure and Design
This MIB module contains three tables:
(1)  The vrrpv3OperationsTable contains objects that define the operational characteristics of a VRRP router.
Rows in this table correspond to instances of virtual routers.
The vrrpv3StatisticsTable contains the operating statistics for a VRRP router.
The vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable contains the addresses of the virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.
Tables are indexed on ifIndex, VRID, and the IP version to uniquely identify a VRRP router.
Notifications in this MIB module are controlled using the mechanisms defined in [RFC3413].
The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in this MIB are instantiated.
The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP routers, VR1 & VR2, configured with two virtual routers.
A, B, and C are IPv4 addresses, and X, Y, and Z are IPv6 addresses.
In the diagram, "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF MIB.
In the vrrpv3OperationsTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address is native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner").
This MIB module makes reference to the following documents [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], and [RFC4001].

The value of the Virtual Router Identifier noted as (VRID) in RFC 5798.
This, along with interface index (ifIndex) and IP version, serves to uniquely identify a virtual router on a given VRRP router.
REFERENCE "RFC 5798 (Sections 3 and 5.2.3)
An entry in the vrrpv3OperationsTable containing the operational characteristics of a virtual router.
On a VRRP router, a given virtual router is identified by a combination of ifIndex, VRID, and the IP version.
ifIndex represents an interface of the router.
A row must be created with vrrpv3OperationsStatus set to initialize(1) and cannot transition to backup(2) or master(3) until vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus is transitioned to active(1).
The information in this table is persistent and when written the entity SHOULD save the change to non  volatile storage.
SEQUENCE { vrrpv3OperationsVrId Vrrpv3VrIdTC, vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType InetAddressType, vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr InetAddress, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr InetAddress, vrrpv3OperationsVirtualMacAddr MacAddress, vrrpv3OperationsStatus INTEGER,
TruthValue, vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode TruthValue, vrrpv3OperationsUpTime TimeTicks,
vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus RowStatus } vrrpv3OperationsVrId OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
This object contains the Virtual Router Identifier (VRID).
This value determines the type for vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr, and vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrAddress.
ipv4(1) and ipv6(2) are the only two values supported in this MIB module.
The master router would set this address to vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr while transitioning to master state.
For backup routers, this is the IP address listed as the source in the VRRP advertisement last received by this virtual router."
In the case where there is more than one IP Address (associated IP addresses) for a given 'ifIndex', this object is used to specify the IP address that will become the vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr', should the virtual router transition from backup state to master."
The virtual MAC address of the virtual router.
Although this object can be derived from the 'vrrpv3OperationsVrId' object, it is defined so that it is easily obtainable by a management application and can be included in VRRP related SNMP notifications."
The current state of the virtual router.
This object has three defined values: 'initialize', which indicates that the virtual router is waiting for a startup event. 'backup', which indicates that the virtual router is monitoring the availability of the master router. '
master', which indicates that the virtual router is forwarding packets for IP addresses that are associated with this router."
"This object specifies the priority to be used for the virtual router master election process; higher values imply higher priority.
A priority of '0', although not settable, is sent by the master router to indicate that this router has ceased to participate in VRRP, and a backup virtual router should transition to become a new master.
A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the associated IP address(es) for VRRP over IPv4 and hence is not settable.
Setting the values of this object to 0 or 255 should be rejected by the agents implementing this MIB module.
For example, an SNMP agent would return 'badValue(3)' when a user tries to set the values 0 or 255 for this object."
"The number of IP addresses that are associated with this virtual router.
This number is equal to the number of rows in the vrrpv3AssociatedAddrTable that correspond to a given ifIndex/VRID/IP version."
"The time interval, in centiseconds, between sending advertisement messages.
Only the master router sends VRRP advertisements.
} vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"Controls whether a virtual router in master state will accept packets addressed to the address owner's IPv6 address as its own if it is not the IPv6 address owner.
This object is not relevant for rows representing VRRP over IPv4 and should be set to false(2)."
"This value represents the amount of time, in TimeTicks (hundredth of a second), since this virtual router (i.e., the 'vrrpv3OperationsStatus') transitioned out of 'initialize'.
The RowStatus variable should be used in accordance to installation and removal conventions for conceptual rows.
To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the 'vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).
In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active(1) until (minimally)
the corresponding instance of vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType, vrrpv3OperationsVrId, and vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr has been set, and there is at least one active row in the 'vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable' defining an associated IP address.
notInService(2) should be used to administratively bring the row down.
A typical order of operation to add a row is: 1.
Create a row in vrrpv3OperationsTable with createAndWait(5).
Create one or more corresponding rows in vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable.
A typical order of operation to delete an entry is: 1.
Set the corresponding rows in vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable to destroy(6) to delete the entry.
Set vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus to destroy(6) to delete the entry."
The table of addresses associated with each virtual router."
An entry in the table contains an IP address that is associated with a virtual router.
The number of rows for a given IP version, VrID, and ifIndex will equal the number of IP addresses associated (e.g., backed up) by the virtual router (equivalent to 'vrrpv3OperationsIpAddrCount').
Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value of 'vrrpv3OperationsStatus' for the corresponding entry in the vrrpv3OperationsTable has transitioned to initialize(1).
The information in this table is persistent and when written the entity SHOULD save the change to non  volatile storage.
SEQUENCE { vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrAddress InetAddress, vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus RowStatus } vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrAddress
The assigned IP addresses that a virtual router is responsible for backing up.
The IP address type is determined by the value of vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType in the index of this row."
1 } vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
Setting this object to active(1) results in the addition of an associated address for a virtual router.
Setting this object to notInService(2) results in administratively bringing down the row.
Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6) removes the associated address from the virtual router.
The use of other values is implementation dependent.
Implementations should not allow deletion of the last row corresponding to an active row in vrrpv3OperationsTable.
Refer to the description of vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus for typical row creation and deletion scenarios."

"The VRRP MIB Notification Group."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr, vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval, vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode, vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus, and vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read create attribute.
Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation of a virtual router.
Examples of how these objects could adversely affect the operation of a virtual router include: An unauthorized change to vrrpv3OperationsPriority can affect the priority used in master election, resulting in this router either becoming master when it should not, or in some other router being elected by preference.
While this will disrupt the operator's plans, it will only replicate the unfortunate failure of multiple routers, and any router that does become master will be capable of filling that role.
Modification of vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr would cause the configured router to take on an incorrect IP address if it becomes master, which would be potentially very disruptive to the network operation.
A malicious change to vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval could either result in the configured router flooding the network with advertisements when it becomes master, or the new master not advertising frequently enough such that some routers do not learn about the new master.
controls whether this router will preempt another master router.
Setting it inappropriately will at worse cause one router to be master against the operator's plans, but that router will still be qualified to operate as a master.
Setting the vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode could prevent an IPv6 capable VRRP router from accepting packets addressed to the address owner's IPv6 address as its own even if it is not the IPv6 address owner.
Although the default for this object is false(2), unauthorized setting of this object to false might restrict the function of some parts of the network.
The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object that could be used to disable a virtual router.
While there are other columns that, if changed, could disrupt operations, they cannot be changed without first changing the RowStatus object.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 207 vrrpv3MIB VRRPV3 MIB } This document obsoletes RFC 2787.
Therefore, IANA has deprecated value 68 under 'mib 2', which is assigned to VRRP MIB.
