  - "1.  Definitions\n   In this document, the following definitions will be used.\n\
    \   Switching Element - A device that switches packets (e.g., an ATM\n      switch\
    \ or MPLS LSR) and whose resources can be divided into\n      partitions, each\
    \ of which can be independently controlled by a\n      different controller.\n\
    \   Partition - A partition is a set of switching element (SE)\n      resources.\
    \  Partitions are also referred to as virtual SEs.\n   Active Partition - An active\
    \ partition is a partition in which the\n      resources are in use; either under\
    \ the direct control of a\n      separate controller or under internal policy-based\
    \ control.\n   Controller - The entity responsible for controlling the operations\n\
    \      of an active partition.\n   Static Partitioning - In static partitioning,\
    \ no changes can be made\n      to any active partition's resources without requiring\
    \ a restart of\n      that partition.  Instances of repartitioning in which connections\n\
    \      to controllers are disconnected before resources can be\n      reallocated\
    \ therefore fall into this category.\n   Dynamic Partitioning - In dynamic partitioning,\
    \ an active\n      partition's resources can be reapportioned without requiring\
    \ a\n      restart of the partition.\n   Frozen Partition - A frozen partition\
    \ is an active partition that is\n      in the process of being shutdown.  A frozen\
    \ partition's unused\n      resources are relinquished, but all current connections\
    \ are\n      allowed to remain until removed by the controller.  As connections\n\
    \      close, the resources are returned to the SE.\n   Deterministic Partitioning\
    \ - In deterministic partitioning, each\n      active partition is given an allotted\
    \ quantity of each resource.\n      The usage of resources in one active partition\
    \ does not influence\n      the resources available to another active partition.\
    \  All\n      discussions in these requirements presuppose the use of\n      deterministic\
    \ partitioning.\n   Statistical Partitioning - In statistical partitioning, some\
    \ or all\n      resources are pooled among the active partitions, and allocations\n\
    \      may be based on percentages or on some other metric.  Discussion\n    \
    \  of statistical partitions is outside the scope of these\n      requirements.\n\
    \   Proactive Notification - A proactive notification is a message sent\n    \
    \  from a SE to its controller at the time an event occurs.\n      Specifically,\
    \ if a SE asynchronously sends the controller a\n      message when it is dynamically\
    \ partitioned, we say that the SE has\n      proactively notified its controller\
    \ of the resource\n      reapportionment.\n   Explicit Reactive Notification -\
    \ In explicit reactive notification,\n      the SE does not asynchronously send\
    \ a message when dynamic\n      partitioning occurs.  Instead, the SE includes\
    \ an explicit,\n      resources-reassigned error code in the response to a subsequent\n\
    \      request by the controller for an unavailable resource.\n   Implicit Reactive\
    \ Notification - This is similar to an Explicit\n      Reactive Notification except\
    \ that the protocol does not contain\n      any explicit resources-reassigned\
    \ error codes.  In this case, all\n      that the SE can do is to indicate that\
    \ some general, unknown error\n      or generic resource error (i.e., some resource\
    \ error problem has\n      occurred but the exact cause is not specified) has\
    \ occurred when\n      the controller attempts to use unavailable resources. \
    \ In such\n      cases, the controller may attempt to determine whether a resource\n\
    \      shortfall caused the error by using whatever messages are\n      available\
    \ through the control protocol to query available\n      resources.\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   This document identifies the logical entities involved in\
    \ the\n   partitioning of switching elements.  Furthermore, this document\n  \
    \ provides a set of requirements for the behavior of these logical\n   entities\
    \ as well as the protocols used by these logical entities to\n   communicate with\
    \ one another.  A primary goal of the requirements\n   specified herein is to\
    \ allow the resources allocated to a partition\n   to be increased or decreased\
    \ while the partition is currently active\n   (i.e., it has an active connection\
    \ with a controller).  This document\n   is primarily intended to facilitate the\
    \ partitioning of GSMP\n   switches.  However, while we believe that the logical\
    \ entities and\n   requirements specified here are necessary for the partitioning\
    \ of\n   non-GSMP switches and (longest prefix match) forwarders (e.g.,\n   routers),\
    \ we do not believe that these requirements are necessarily\n   sufficient for\
    \ the partitioning of those devices.\n   Three logical entities are involved in\
    \ the partitioning and control\n   of a SE.  First, a switching element (for the\
    \ purposes of this\n   document) is a device that \"switches\" packets, whose\
    \ resources can be\n   partitioned and whose partitions can each be controlled\
    \ by a single\n   controller.  This partitioning also implies the ability to enforce\n\
    \   this division of resources between competing partitions.  Second, the\n  \
    \ partition manager (PM) is a management entity that specifies the\n   number\
    \ of virtual SEs into which the SE should be partitioned and the\n   resources\
    \ to be allocated to each virtual SE.  Lastly, a controller\n   directs the use\
    \ of the resources of one or more partitions to provide\n   a set of services.\n\
    \   In the rest of this document, we will deal exclusively with logical\n   entities\
    \ although it is worth noting here that there are many\n   possible mappings of\
    \ logical entities to physical entities.  For\n   example, there may be multiple\
    \ logical controllers running on a\n   single physical processor (and for convenience\
    \ we may refer to this\n   processor as a physical controller).  Conversely, a\
    \ single logical\n   controller could consist of processes running on multiple\
    \ physical\n   processors collaborating to provide proper control.  Likewise,\
    \ there\n   may be multiple partition managers running on a single management\n\
    \   workstation.  A switching element may consist of one or more whole or\n  \
    \ fractional physical elements.  For example, a SE may be a single\n   whole physical\
    \ switch (e.g., blade in a chassis), multiple whole\n   physical switches (e.g.,\
    \ two blades in a chassis made to appear as a\n   single logical entity), a single\
    \ fraction of a physical switch (which\n   would enable nested partitions), or\
    \ multiple fractions of either the\n   same or different physical switches (e.g.,\
    \ ports 1-3 on blade 1 and\n   ports 2-4 on blade 2).  Finally, any combination\
    \ of these logical\n   entities could theoretically be co-located on the same\
    \ physical\n   resources.\n   However, for many reasons, the physical realm often\
    \ reflects this\n   logical division of functionality.  To facilitate this division,\n\
    \   several protocols, such as MEGACO [RFC3015] and GSMP [RFC3292], exist\n  \
    \ that allow control functionality to be physically separated from\n   switching\
    \ functionality.  Recently, some regulatory environments have\n   mandated multi-provider\
    \ access to a single physical infrastructure.\n   To satisfy these regulations,\
    \ a common use of partitioning will be\n   for the owner of the SE to partition\
    \ the SE into several virtual SEs\n   and then to lease these to third parties.\
    \ In this case, the PM will\n   likely be physically separate from all of the\
    \ controllers.  For\n   locality (and therefore ease) of management, SEs will\
    \ be remotely\n   configurable and thus the PM will be physically separated from\
    \ the\n   SE.  The following illustration depicts this arrangement.  The dashed\n\
    \   lines indicate interactions between the entities and are labeled with\n  \
    \ the cardinality of the relationship between the entities.\n           ------------------\

    \   Interaction A is one in which the PM partitions the SE and allocates\n   resources\
    \ to the partitions it creates.  There is a one-to-many\n   relationship between\
    \ PMs and SEs.  In order to support dynamic\n   partitioning, this document will\
    \ place certain requirements on\n   proposed (or new) solutions in this space.\n\
    \   Interaction B is one in which the controller configures and manages\n   an\
    \ active partition.  Current protocols implementing this interaction\n   include\
    \ GSMP [RFC3292] and MEGACO [RFC3015].  These protocols allow a\n   many-to-many\
    \ relationship between controller and partition.\n   Interaction C is one by which\
    \ a PM and a controller could communicate\n   to alter the nature of an active\
    \ partition.  There is a many-to-many\n   relationship between PMs and controllers.\
    \  For example, there are\n   multiple PMs per controller in the case where a\
    \ controller is\n   managing two partitions from different SEs and there are multiple\n\
    \   controllers per PM in the case where a SE has two partitions each\n   managed\
    \ by a different controller.  Possible types of interactions\n   between PM and\
    \ controller include:\n   -  A controller could request that the resources of\
    \ one of its active\n      partitions be altered; either increased or decreased.\n\
    \   -  The PM could respond to a controller request for altered resource\n   \
    \   levels.\n   -  The PM could request that a controller release resources currently\n\
    \      allocated to one of its active partitions.  This could involve the\n  \
    \    following types of request:\n      -  A request to relinquish allocated,\
    \ but currently unused\n         resources.  That is to put a freeze on additional\
    \ use of the\n         specified resources.\n      -  A request to relinquish\
    \ used resources.\n      -  A request to relinquish an active partition.  That\
    \ is a request\n         that a controller release control of an active partition.\n\
    \      -  The controller's response to a PM request.\n   As far as the authors\
    \ know, no proposed standard solutions currently\n   exist for interactions of\
    \ type C.\n"
- title: 3.  Dynamic Partitioning
  contents:
  - "3.  Dynamic Partitioning\n   Static repartitioning of a SE can be a costly and\
    \ inefficient\n   process.  First, before static repartitioning can take place,\
    \ all\n   existing connections with controllers for the affected partitions\n\
    \   must be severed.  (This severing must always occur even if the\n   resources\
    \ to be reapportioned are not currently in use.)  When this\n   happens, the SE\
    \ will typically release all the state configured by\n   the controller.  Then,\
    \ the virtual SE must be placed in the \"down\"\n   state while the repartitioning\
    \ takes place.  Once the repartitioning\n   is completed, the partitions are placed\
    \ in the \"up\" state and the\n   controllers are allowed to reconnect to the\
    \ partitions.  Then, the\n   controllers can reestablish state in those partitions.\
    \  Thus, static\n   repartitioning results in a period of downtime and a period\
    \ in which\n   the controllers are reestablishing state for affected partitions.\n\
    \   Partitions of a SE that are not affected by a static resource\n   reallocation\
    \ need not be transitioned to the down state nor would\n   controllers have to\
    \ reestablish state with unaffected partitions.\n   Therefore, dynamic partitioning\
    \ is to be preferred to static\n   partitioning since it avoids the downtime and\
    \ loss of state\n   associated with static partitioning.  However, a different\
    \ set of\n   potential problems exists for dynamic partitioning.  Some questions\n\
    \   to be answered include the following:\n   -  How is the controller notified\
    \ of an increase or decrease in\n      resources?\n   -  What should happen when\
    \ the PM would like to decrease the\n      resources allocated to a partition\
    \ but those resources are in use?\n"
- title: 4.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements\n   This document does not attempt to answer the preceding questions\
    \ but\n   instead defines a set of requirements that any solution to these\n \
    \  problems MUST satisfy.\n   1.  There MUST be a mechanism by which a PM can\
    \ create virtual SEs on\n       the SE and allocate SE resources to those virtual\
    \ SEs.\n   2.  SEs MUST ensure that controllers do not use more resources than\n\
    \       those currently allocated to each virtual SE.  Therefore, each\n     \
    \  control protocol MUST provide either an explicit reactive\n       notification\
    \ or an implicit reactive notification to indicate\n       resource exhaustion.\n\
    \   3.  Furthermore, there MUST be a mechanism by which a PM can\n       partition\
    \ all resources discoverable through GSMP (e.g., label\n       tables). Partitioning\
    \ of resources used by GSMP indirectly (e.g.,\n       CPU), resources used by\
    \ non-GSMP switches, or resources (e.g.,\n       forwarding table entries) used\
    \ by forwarding-based network\n       elements MAY be supported.\n   4.  If a\
    \ PM instructs a SE to release resources allocated to an\n       active partition\
    \ and if any of those resources are currently in\n       use, the SE MUST deny\
    \ the PM's request.  (Requirement #8\n       addresses the potential starvation\
    \ issues raised by this\n       requirement.)\n   5.  Subsequent to a resource\
    \ reallocation failure, the PM SHOULD make\n       use of one or both of the capabilities\
    \ described in requirements\n       6 and 7.\n   6.  A PM SHOULD be able to tell\
    \ a SE to make an active partition into\n       a frozen partition.\n   7.  A\
    \ PM SHOULD be able to contact the controller to ask it to reduce\n       its\
    \ resource utilization.\n   8.  The PM MUST be able to exercise \"power on/off\"\
    \ type control of\n       the virtual SEs that it has created.  When the virtual\
    \ power to\n       an active partition is turned off, the partition becomes inactive\n\
    \       and any controllers associated with that partition are\n       disconnected.\
    \ This capability allows a PM to resort to static\n       partitioning when a\
    \ controller is uncooperative about releasing\n       resources.  This requirement\
    \ allows permanent starvation as a\n       result of requirement #4 to be avoided.\n\
    \   9.  During dynamic repartitioning, a SE MUST maintain all existing\n     \
    \  state associated with the partitions being modified.\n   10. Control protocols\
    \ SHOULD NOT include any mechanism by which a SE\n       can ask its controller\
    \ to reduce its resource usage.\n   11. Control protocols MAY contain proactive\
    \ resource notification\n       messages by which a SE could instantaneously inform\
    \ the\n       controller of an increase or decrease in resources.  (We do not\n\
    \       specifically require control protocols to contain proactive\n       notifications\
    \ because all control protocols must already have\n       explicit or implicit\
    \ reactive notifications as mentioned in\n       requirement #2).\n   12. A PM\
    \ MAY directly inform a controller of a change in virtual SE\n       resources\
    \ rather than rely on the implicit resource exhaustion\n       mechanism of the\
    \ control protocol.\n   13. SEs MAY inform the PM of resource exhaustion on a\
    \ particular\n       partition.\n   14. A controller MAY ask the PM for further\
    \ resources or a reduction\n       in existing resources.\n   15. To support the\
    \ automation of interaction between the PM and\n       attached controllers, the\
    \ PM MUST be able to determine from the\n       SE the addresses of the controllers\
    \ that are currently attached\n       to a virtual SE.  Additionally, the SE MAY\
    \ allow the PM to\n       determine which control protocol (and version thereof)\
    \ is\n       currently managing each active partition.\n   16. A SE MAY support\
    \ the ability to have one virtual SE provide a\n       service to another virtual\
    \ SE within the same physical SE.  For\n       example, a SE may be configured\
    \ to provide a virtual link between\n       two virtual SEs.  Furthermore:\n \
    \     a. There MUST be a mechanism by which the SE can inform the PM\n       \
    \  which of these partition-to-partition services are provided by\n         the\
    \ SE.\n      b. There MUST be a mechanism by which the PM can configure the\n\
    \         available partition-to-partition services.\n      c. If the configuration\
    \ of a partition-to-partition service\n         results in a virtual port being\
    \ added/removed from a virtual\n         SE, the SE MUST notify all controllers\
    \ attached to that virtual\n         SE (assuming that the corresponding control\
    \ protocol supports\n         such notifications).\n   17. There MUST be a mechanism\
    \ by which a PM can query a SE to\n       determine the resources of that SE,\
    \ the partitions currently\n       configured on that SE and the resources allocated\
    \ to each\n       partition.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Only authorized PMs MUST be allowed to dynamically\
    \ repartition a SE.\n   Therefore, SEs MUST use a secure process by which an authorized\n\
    \   entity may instruct the SE as to which PM should control it.  This\n   instruction\
    \ MAY specify the PM explicitly or MAY specify the use of a\n   (discovery) protocol\
    \ to dynamically locate the PM.  Similarly, only\n   the PM (or an authorized\
    \ agent of the PM) that is authorized to\n   partition a SE MUST be allowed to\
    \ contact controllers to request that\n   they decrease their resources or inform\
    \ them that their resources\n   have been increased.  Likewise, the PM MUST verify\
    \ and authenticate\n   that any requests for additional/fewer resources for a\
    \ virtual SE\n   have come from a controller authorized to control the specified\n\
    \   virtual SE.\n"
