  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the transition scenarios in 3GPP\
    \ packet data\n   networks that might come up in the deployment phase of IPv6.\
    \  The\n   main purpose of this document is to identify and to document those\n\
    \   scenarios for further discussion and study them in the v6ops working\n   group.\n\
    \   Just a brief overview of the 3GPP packet data network, GPRS, is given\n  \
    \ to help the reader to better understand the transition scenarios.  A\n   better\
    \ overview of the 3GPP specified GPRS can be found for example\n   from [6]. \
    \ The GPRS architecture is defined in [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Scope of the Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope of the Document\n   The scope is to describe the possible transition\
    \ scenarios in the\n   3GPP defined GPRS network where a UE connects to, or is\
    \ contacted\n   from, the Internet or another UE.  The document describes scenarios\n\
    \   with and without the usage of the SIP-based (Session Initiation\n   Protocol\
    \ [5]) IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS).  The 3GPP\n   releases 1999,\
    \ 4, and 5 are considered as the basis.\n   Out of scope are scenarios inside\
    \ the GPRS network, i.e., on the\n   different interfaces of the GPRS network.\
    \  This document neither\n   changes 3GPP specifications, nor proposes changes\
    \ to the current\n   specifications.\n   In addition, the possible transition\
    \ scenarios are described.  The\n   solutions will be documented in a separate\
    \ document.\n   All the possible scenarios are listed here.  Further analysis\
    \ may\n   show that some of the scenarios are not actually relevant in this\n\
    \   context.\n"

  - "3.1.  GPRS Architecture Basics\n   This section gives an overview to the most\
    \ important concepts of the\n   3GPP packet architecture.  For more detailed description,\
    \ please see\n   [1].\n   From the point of view of this document, the most relevant\
    \ 3GPP\n   architectural elements are the User Equipment (UE), and the Gateway\n\
    \   GPRS Support Node (GGSN).  A simplified picture of the architecture\n   is\
    \ shown in Figure 1.\n   The UE is the mobile phone.  It can either be an integrated\
    \ device\n   comprising a combined GPRS part, and the IP stack, or it might be\
    \ a\n   separate GPRS device, and separate equipment with the IP stack, e.g.,\n\
    \   a laptop.\n   The GGSN serves as an anchor-point for the GPRS mobility management.\n\
    \   It also serves as the default router for the UE.\n   The Peer node mentioned\
    \ in the picture refers to a node with which\n   the UE is communicating.\n  \

    \  ---------\n            Figure 1:  Simplified GPRS Architecture\n   There is\
    \ a dedicated link between the UE and the GGSN called the\n   Packet Data Protocol\
    \ (PDP) Context.  This link is created through the\n   PDP Context activation\
    \ process.  During the activation the UE is\n   configured with its IP address\
    \ and other information needed to\n   maintain IP access, e.g., DNS server address.\
    \  There are three\n   different types of PDP Contexts: IPv4, IPv6, and Point-to-Point\n\
    \   Protocol (PPP).\n   A UE can have one or more simultaneous PDP Contexts open\
    \ to the same\n   or to different GGSNs.  The PDP Context can be either of the\
    \ same or\n   different types.\n"

  - "3.2.  IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS)\n   IP Multimedia Core Network\
    \ Subsystem (IMS) is an architecture for\n   supporting multimedia services via\
    \ a SIP infrastructure.  It is\n   specified in 3GPP Release 5.  This section\
    \ provides an overview of\n   the 3GPP IMS and is not intended to be comprehensive.\
    \  A more\n   detailed description can be found in [2], [3] and [4].\n   The IMS\
    \ comprises a set of SIP proxies, servers, and registrars.  In\n   addition, there\
    \ are Media Gateways (MGWs) that offer connections to\n   non-IP networks such\
    \ as the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN).\n   A simplified overview of\

    \ the 3GPP IMS architecture\n   The SIP proxies, servers, and registrars shown\
    \ in Figure 2 are as\n   follows.\n     - P-CSCF (Proxy-Call Session Control Function)\
    \ is the first\n       contact point within the IMS for the subscriber.\n    \
    \ - I-CSCF (Interrogating-CSCF) is the contact point within an\n       operator's\
    \ network for all connections destined to a subscriber\n       of that network\
    \ operator, or a roaming subscriber currently\n       located within that network\
    \ operator's service area.\n     - S-CSCF (Serving-CSCF) performs the session\
    \ control services for\n       the subscriber.  It also acts as a SIP Registrar.\n\
    \   IMS capable UEs utilize the GPRS network as an access network for\n   accessing\
    \ the IMS.  Thus, a UE has to have an activated PDP Context\n   to the IMS before\
    \ it can proceed to use the IMS services.  The PDP\n   Context activation is explained\
    \ briefly in section 3.1.\n   The IMS is exclusively IPv6.  Thus, the activated\
    \ PDP Context is of\n   PDP Type IPv6.  This means that a 3GPP IP Multimedia terminal\
    \ uses\n   exclusively IPv6 to access the IMS, and the IMS SIP server and proxy\n\
    \   support exclusively IPv6.  Hence, all the traffic going to the IMS is\n  \
    \ IPv6, even if the UE is dual stack capable - this comprises both\n   signaling\
    \ and user traffic.\n   This, of course, does not prevent the usage of other unrelated\n\
    \   services (e.g., corporate access) on IPv4.\n"

  - "4.1.  GPRS Scenarios\n   This section describes the scenarios that might occur\
    \ when a GPRS UE\n   contacts services, or nodes outside the GPRS network, e.g.,\
    \ web-\n   server in the Internet.\n   Transition scenarios of the GPRS internal\
    \ interfaces are outside of\n   the scope of this document.\n   The following\
    \ scenarios are described here.  In all of the scenarios,\n   the UE is part of\
    \ a network where there is at least one router of the\n   same IP version, i.e.,\
    \ GGSN, and it is connecting to a node in a\n   different network.\n   The scenarios\
    \ here apply also for PDP Context type Point-to-Point\n   Protocol (PPP) where\
    \ PPP is terminated at the GGSN.  On the other\n   hand, where the PPP PDP Context\
    \ is terminated e.g., at an external\n   ISP, the environment is the same as for\
    \ general ISP cases.\n      1) Dual Stack UE connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 nodes\n\

    \ 1) Dual Stack UE connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 nodes\n      The GPRS system has\
    \ been designed in a manner that there is the\n      possibility to have simultaneous\
    \ IPv4, and IPv6 PDP Contexts open.\n      Thus, in cases where the UE is dual\
    \ stack capable, and in the\n      network there is a GGSN (or separate GGSNs)\
    \ that supports both\n      connections to IPv4 and IPv6 networks, it is possible\
    \ to connect\n      to both at the same time.  Figure 3 depicts this scenario.\n\

    \    Figure 3: Dual-Stack Case\n      However, the IPv4 addresses may be a scarce\
    \ resource for the\n      mobile operator or an ISP.  In that case, it might not\
    \ be possible\n      for the UE to have a globally unique IPv4 address allocated\
    \ all\n      the time.  Hence, the UE could either activate the IPv4 PDP\n   \
    \   Context only when needed, or be allocated an IPv4 address from a\n      private\
    \ address space.\n   2) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv6 node through an IPv4 network\n\
    \      Especially in the initial stages of IPv6 deployment, there are\n      cases\
    \ where an IPv6 node would need to connect to the IPv6\n      Internet through\
    \ a network that is IPv4.  For instance, this can\n      be seen in current fixed\
    \ networks, where the access is provided\n      via IPv4 only, but there is an\
    \ IPv6 network deeper in the\n      Internet.  This scenario is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\n        +------+                  +------+\n        |      |           \

    \                Figure 4: IPv6 nodes communicating over IPv4\n      In this case,\
    \ in the GPRS system, the UE would be IPv6 capable,\n      and the GPRS network\
    \ would provide an IPv6 capable GGSN in the\n      network.  However, there is\
    \ an IPv4 network between the GGSN, and\n      the peer node.\n   3) IPv4 UE connecting\
    \ to an IPv4 node through an IPv6 network\n      Further in the future, there\
    \ are cases where the legacy UEs are\n      still IPv4 only, capable of connecting\
    \ only to the legacy IPv4\n      Internet.  However, the GPRS operator network\
    \ has already been\n      upgraded to IPv6.  Figure 5 represents this scenario.\n\

    \ provide an IPv4 capable\n      GGSN, and a connection through the IPv6 network\
    \ to the IPv4\n      Internet.\n   4) IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv4 node\n   \
    \   In this scenario, an IPv6 UE connects to an IPv4 node in the IPv4\n      Internet.\
    \  As an example, an IPv6 UE connects to an IPv4 web\n      server in the legacy\

    \      This is similar to the case above, but in the opposite direction.\n   \
    \   Here an IPv4 UE connects to an IPv6 node in the IPv6 Internet.  As\n     \
