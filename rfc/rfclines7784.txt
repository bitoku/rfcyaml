Abstract This document specifies the MIB for the OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) objects for IETF TRILL (
Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links).
Introduction Overall, TRILL OAM meets the requirements given in [RFC6905].
The general framework for TRILL OAM is specified in [RFC7174].
The details of the Fault Management (FM) solution, conforming to that framework, are presented in [RFC7455].
The solution leverages the message format defined in Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
[802.1Q] as the basis for the TRILL OAM message channel.
This document uses the CFM MIB modules defined in [802.1Q] as the basis for TRILL OAM MIB and augments the existing tables to add new TRILL managed objects required by TRILL.
This document further specifies a new table with associated managed objects for TRILL OAM  specific capabilities.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Abbreviations used in the document include the following: CCM   Continuity Check Message [802.1Q]
EMS   Element Management System [Q.840.1]
MIP   Maintenance Intermediate Point [RFC7174]
Multi destination Tree Verification Message [RFC7455]
Multi destination Tree Verification Reply [
NMS   Network Management System [Q.840.1] PTM   Path Trace Message [RFC7455] PTR   Path Trace Reply [RFC7455] 4.
The TRILL OAM MIB module provides an overall framework for managing TRILL OAM.
It leverages the IEEE8021 CFM MIB and IEEE8021
CFM V2 MIB modules defined in [802.1Q], and it augments the Maintenance End Point (MEP) and MEP Db entries.
It also adds a new table for messages specific to TRILL OAM.
Structure of the MIB Module Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees.
Each subtree is organized as a set of related objects.
The various subtrees are shown below, supplemented with the required elements of the IEEE8021 CFM MIB module.
Textual Conventions Textual conventions are defined to represent object types relevant to the TRILL OAM MIB.
The TRILL OAM MIB tree described below consists of trilloamNotifications (Traps) and trillOamMibObjects.
The trilloamNotifications are sent to the management entity whenever a MEP loses/restores contact with its peer flow MEPs.
The TRILL OAM MIB per MEP Objects are defined in the trillOamMepTable.
The trillOamMepTable augments the dot1agCfmMepEntry (please see Section 6.1) defined in IEEE8021 CFM MIB.
It includes objects that are locally defined for an individual MEP and its associated flow.
The Notifications Subtree Notifications (fault alarms) are sent to the management entity with the OID of the MEP that has detected the fault.
Notifications are generated whenever MEP loses/restores contact with its peer flow MEPs.
The TRILL OAM MIB per MEP Objects are defined in the trillOamMepTable.
The trillOamMepTable augments the dot1agCfmMepEntry (please see Section 6.1) defined in IEEE8021 CFM MIB.
It includes objects that are locally defined for an individual MEP and its associated flow.
This table is an extension of the dot1agCfmMepTable.
Rows are automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepTable.
This table represents the local MEP TRILL OAM configuration table.
The primary purpose of this table is provide local parameters for the TRILL OAM function found in [RFC7455] and instantiated at a MEP.
Each row in this table represents a Flow Configuration Entry for the associated MEP.
This table uses four indices.
The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MANET, and MEP tables.
The fourth index is the specific Flow Configuration Entry on the selected MEP.
Some writable objects in this table are only applicable in certain cases (as described under each object below), and attempts to write values for them in other cases will be ignored.
Each row in this table represents a Path Trace Reply Entry for the Defined MEP and Transaction.
This table uses four indices.
The first three indices identify the MEP and the fourth index specifies the Transaction Identifier.
This Transaction Identifier uniquely identifies the response for a MEP, which can have multiple flows.
This table includes managed objects for the Multi destination Reply.
Each row in the table represents a Multi destination Reply Entry for the defined MEP and Transaction.
This table uses the following five indices: 1)
Maintenance Domain, 2) MANET, 3) MEP tables, 4)
Transaction Identifier of selected MEP, and 5) receive order of Multi destination replies.
Some writable objects in this table are only applicable in certain cases (as described under each object below), and attempts to write a value for them in other cases will be ignored.
This table is an augmentation of the dot1agCfmMepDbTable, and rows are automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepDbTable.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
The IEEE8021 CFM MIB [IEEE8021 CFM MIB] and [LLDP MIB] contain objects that are relevant to the TRILL OAM MIB.
Management objects contained in these modules are not duplicated here, to reduce overlap to the extent possible.
From the IEEE8021 CFM MIB, the following objects are imported: dot1agCfmMdIndex dot1agCfmMaIndex dot1agCfmMepIdentifier dot1agCfmMepEntry dot1agCfmMepDbEntry Dot1agCfmIngressActionFieldValue Dot1agCfmEgressActionFieldValue
From the [LLDP MIB], the following objects are imported: LldpChassisId LldpChassisIdSubtype LldpPortId 6.1.
In TRILL, traffic labeling can be done using either a 12 bit VLAN or a 24 bit Fine Grained Label (FGL)
The IEEE8021 TC MIB definition of IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType includes the following two values:
1 representing a vlanId, and 2 representing a 24 bit isid We have chosen to use value 2 for TRILL's FGL.
As such, TRILL OAM MIB will import IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType, IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone, and IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue from IEEE8021 TC MIB.
Relationship to the IEEE8021 CFM MIB trillOamMepTable augments dot1agCfmMepEntry.
Implementation of IEEE8021 CFM MIB is required as we are augmenting the IEEE CFM MIB Table.
Objects/Tables that are not applicable to a TRILL implementation have to be handled by the TRILL implementation backend, and appropriate default values, as described in IEEE8021 CFM MIB, have to be returned.
The TRILL OAM implementation doesn't support the Link Trace Message or Link Trace Reply, since, as described in RFC 7455, the Path Trace Message and Reply for unicast traffic and Multi destination Tree verification Message and Reply for multicast traffic have been substituted for them.
Statistics for these messages should default as per IEEE8021 CFM MIB.

This MIB relates to a system that will provide network connectivity and packet forwarding services.
As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
There are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The following table and objects in the TRILL OAM MIB can be manipulated to interfere with the operation of RBridges by causing CPU use spikes:
trillOamMepTransmitLbmReplyIp allows the reply from a Loopback message to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV, thus allowing replies to be sent to any system to cause denial of service.
trillOamMepTransmitPtmReplyIp allows the reply from a Path Trace message to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV, thus allowing replies to be sent to any system to cause denial of service.
trillOamMepTxPtmMessages allows the generation of PTMs and can be used to generate lots of CPU driven traffic.
trillOamMepTransmitMtvmReplyIp allows a from reply from an MTVM to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV, thus allowing replies to be sent to any system to cause denial of service.
trillOamMepTxMtvmMessages allows the generation of MTVMs and can be used to generate lots of CPU driven traffic.
The following objects in the TRILL OAM MIB are read create and can be manipulated to interfere with the OAM operations of RBridges.
If the number of OAM frames generated in the network is high, this can cause a CPU spike on destination RBridges if control plane policing is not properly implemented or configured on destination RBridges.
trillOamMepTxLbmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop Count for the LBM.
As OAM frames don't leak out of the TRILL network, it has no side effects.
trillOamMepTxLbmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply is in or out of band.
This object's vulnerability is covered as part of trillOamMepTransmitLbmReplyIp.
trillOamMepTxLbmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow and find the exact path in the network.
The creation of valid flows is its intended purpose.
If invalid flows are created on vulnerable system, they will be dropped in forwarding.
trillOamMepTxLbmDestRName is read create, but it's not vulnerable as invalid name routes won't be present and will be rejected by the OAM application as part of normal processing.
trillOamMepTxPtmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop Count for the PTM.
As OAM frames don't leak out of the TRILL network, it has no side effect.
trillOamMepTxPtmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply is in or out of band.
This object's vulnerability is covered as part of trillOamMepTransmitPtmReplyIp.
trillOamMepTxPtmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow and find the exact path in the network.
Creation of valid flows is its intended purpose.
If invalid flows are created on vulnerable systems, they will be dropped in forwarding.
trillOamMepTxPtmDestRName is read create, but it's not vulnerable as invalid name routes won't be present and will be rejected by the OAM application as part of normal processing.
trillOamMepTxPtmStatus is required for normal PTM operation.
trillOamMepTxPtmResultOK is required for normal PTM operation.
trillOamMepTxPtmSeqNumber is required for normal PTM operation.
trillOamMepTxPtmMessages is required for normal PTM operation.
trillOamMepTxMtvmTree is required for normal MTVM operation.
trillOamMepTxMtvmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop Count for the MTVM.
As OAM frames don't leak out of the TRILL network, it has no side effect  trillOamMepTxMtvmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply is in or out of band.
This object's vulnerability is covered as part of trillOamMepTransmitMtmReplyIp
trillOamMepTxMtvmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow and find the exact path in the network.
Creation of valid flows is its intended purpose.
If invalid flows are created on vulnerable systems, they will be dropped in forwarding.
trillOamMepTxMtvmStatus is required for normal MTVM operation.
trillOamMepTxMtvmResultOK, trillOamMepTxMtvmMessages, trillOamMepTxMtvmSeqNumber, and trillOamMepTxMtvmScopeList are required for normal MTVM operation.
and trillOamMepTransmitMtvmReplyIp allow setting of the IP address to which reports are sent; thus, it can be used for denial of service for that IP.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
For example, Path Trace messages expose the unicast topology of the network and Multi destination Tree Verification Messages expose the multicast tree topology of the network.
This information should not be available to all users of the network.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementation should provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give only those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
