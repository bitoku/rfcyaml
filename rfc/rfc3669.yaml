- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo lays out a conceptual framework and rules of thumb\
    \ to\n   assist working groups dealing with IPR issues.  The goal is to\n   achieve\
    \ a balance between the needs of IPR claimants and the\n   implementers of IETF\
    \ standards which is appropriate to current times.\n   As part of trying to distill\
    \ out principles for dealing with IPR in\n   IETF working groups, it provides\
    \ case studies of working group IPR\n   treatment.  In other words, it documents\
    \ the running code of the IETF\n   process.\n   This memo does not describe IPR\
    \ procedures for document authors or\n   IPR claimants.  Those are covered in\
    \ two other memos, on submission\n   rights [5] and IPR in the IETF [6].  Rather,\
    \ this memo is for working\n   groups that are trying to decide what to do about\
    \ technology\n   contributions which have associated IPR claims.\n"
- title: 2.  The Problem
  contents:
  - "2.  The Problem\n   Traditionally the IETF has tried to avoid technologies which\
    \ were\n   \"protected\" through IPR claims.  However, compromises have been made\n\
    \   since before the IETF was born.  The \"common knowledge\" of the IETF,\n \
    \  that IPR-impacted technology was anathema, has never recognized that\n   the\
    \ Internet has run on IPR-impacted technologies from the beginning.\n   Nowadays\
    \ the majority of the useful technologies brought to the IETF\n   have some sort\
    \ of IPR claim associated with them.\n   It will always be better for the Internet\
    \ to develop standards based\n   on technology which can be used without concern\
    \ about selective or\n   costly licensing.  However, increasingly, choosing a\
    \ technology which\n   is not impacted by IPR over an alternative that is may\
    \ produce a\n   weaker Internet.  Sometimes there simply isn't any technology\
    \ in an\n   area that is not IPR-impacted.  It is not always the wrong decision\n\
    \   to select IPR-impacted technology, if the choice is made knowingly,\n   after\
    \ considering the alternatives and taking the IPR issues into\n   account.\n \
    \  The IETF is not a membership organization.  Other standards-making\n   bodies\
    \ may have membership agreements that member organizations must\n   sign and adhere\
    \ to in order to participate.  Membership agreements\n   may include strict procedures\
    \ for dealing with IPR, or perhaps a\n   requirement that technology must be licensed\
    \ royalty-free.  This is\n   currently not possible in the IETF.\n   Even if the\
    \ IETF had membership agreements, they would be difficult\n   to formulate in\
    \ a way that covered IPR issues, because the IETF's\n   work includes technology\
    \ from other sources and because the IETF\n   collaborates with organizations\
    \ that work with different approaches\n   to intellectual property.  The IETF\
    \ can encounter four different IPR\n   situations, at almost any time during the\
    \ life of a document:\n   o  A document submitter notes their (or their represented\n\
    \      organization's) IPR claim regarding the contents of the document.\n   o\
    \  A non-submitter IETF participant claims that the contents of a\n      document\
    \ are covered by their (or their represented\n      organization's) own IPR.\n\
    \   o  An IETF participant notes IPR that is claimed by an individual or\n   \
    \   organization with which neither an author of the document, nor the\n     \
    \ participant noting the IPR, have an affiliation.\n   o  An individual or organization\
    \ that does not participate in the\n      IETF, but that monitors its activities,\
    \ discovers that a document\n      intersects that individual's or organization's\
    \ established or\n      pending intellectual property claims.  It may come forward\
    \ right\n      away, or wait and let the IETF work progress.\n   In working group\
    \ activities, the IETF does not have detailed rules\n   for each situation.  Working\
    \ groups have essentially only one rule\n   they can invoke -- about individuals\
    \ not participating in activities\n   related to a technology if they do not disclose\
    \ known IPR.  Beyond\n   that a working group can only make recommendations and\
    \ requests.\n   Since every case is unique, and there are close to no general\
    \ rules,\n   working groups need a great deal of freedom in dealing with IPR\n\
    \   issues.  However, some amount of consistency is important so that\n   both\
    \ contributors and users of eventual standards can know what to\n   expect.\n"
- title: 3.  The Approach
  contents:
  - "3.  The Approach\n   The goal of this memo is not to make rules.  The goal is\
    \ to give\n   working groups as much information as possible to make informed\n\
    \   decisions, and then step out of the way.  The other IPR working group\n  \
    \ memos [5][6] lay out what needs to be done once a particular piece of\n   technology\
    \ is selected as a working group draft.  However, this\n   doesn't help when a\
    \ working group is trying to decide whether or not\n   to select a technology\
    \ in the first place.  This third memo is\n   written to help in making that decision.\
    \  We want to build a\n   conceptual framework, a new set of \"common knowledge\"\
    , to make it\n   easier for working groups to deal with intellectual property\
    \ issues.\n   To do so, we first present \"case studies\" in Section 4 -- real\
    \ events\n   that have happened in recent years, and how different working groups\n\
    \   dealt with them -- plus notes on possible lessons to be learned.  In\n   Section\
    \ 5, we expand on these lessons and try to extract general\n   principles.\n"
- title: 4.  Case Studies
  contents:
  - "4.  Case Studies\n   The best way to know what works in dealing with IPR is to\
    \ look at\n   past attempts to do so.  The following are selected as cases from\n\
    \   which general lessons might be extracted.  Other lessons might be\n   extracted\
    \ from other cases, but the cases below cover the important\n   ones.\n"
- title: 4.1.  PPP CCP and ECP
  contents:
  - "4.1.  PPP CCP and ECP\n   The PPP Working Group adopted technology for PPP's\
    \ Connection Control\n   Protocol and Encryption Control Protocol about which\
    \ an IPR\n   disclosure had been received.  They indicated to the IESG that they\n\
    \   believed the patented technology was the best approach, and was\n   better\
    \ than no standards at all.\n   At that time, under the policies documented in\
    \ RFC 1602 [1] (the\n   precursor to RFC 2026), progress on any standard was to\
    \ stop at the\n   Proposed Standard phase until specific assurances about licensing\n\
    \   terms could be obtained from all IPR claimants.  However, as\n   described\
    \ in RFC 1915 [3], in the case of PPP ECP and CCP, the IPR\n   claimant balked\
    \ at the requirement for specific assurances.\n   In the end, with support from\
    \ the working group, the variance\n   procedure described in RFC 1871 [2] was\
    \ followed to grant an\n   exception to the RFC 1602 requirements.  If it had\
    \ not been granted,\n   the ECP and CCP standards could have been blocked permanently.\n\
    \   Lessons:\n   o  IPR claimants, even when their intentions are good, may strongly\n\
    \      resist being forced to make specific public statements about\n      licensing\
    \ terms.  If explicit statements of licensing terms are\n      required, then\
    \ the publicly stated terms will probably be\n      \"worst-case\", which would\
    \ provide little useful information.\n"
- title: 4.2.  IPS WG (IP Storage)
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IPS WG (IP Storage)\n   The IPS (IP Storage) Working Group evaluated technology\
    \ developed\n   outside of the working group, \"secure remote password\" (SRP,\
    \ RFC 2945\n   [7]).  At the time, there was one known IPR claim, and the proposed\n\
    \   licensing terms were apparently reasonable.  SRP had become a\n   proposed\
    \ standard without going through any working group, so IETF\n   participants may\
    \ have been less likely to notice it in order to make\n   statements about IPR.\
    \  In any case, two more possible IPR claims were\n   uncovered after the IPS\
    \ working group had already decided to make SRP\n   required.  One of the possible\
    \ IPR claimants did not make a strong\n   IPR claim itself, and did not want to\
    \ take the time to determine\n   whether it actually had a claim, though it acknowledged\
    \ it might have\n   a claim.  In both cases it was difficult to obtain concrete\n\
    \   information on possible licensing terms, even though words like\n   \"reasonable\"\
    \ and \"non-discriminatory\" were used in the IPR\n   statements.  Rumors of what\
    \ they might be like did not sound good.\n   The working group participants took\
    \ the claims, potential and\n   otherwise, very seriously, and decided not to\
    \ use SRP after all, even\n   though they had already chosen it based on other\
    \ criteria.\n   Lessons:\n   o  IPR claims may appear at any time in the standards\
    \ process.\n   o  Take impreciseness seriously.  Attempt to get clarification\
    \ on\n      both IPR claims and licensing terms.\n"
- title: 4.3.  PEM and PKI issues
  contents:
  - "4.3.  PEM and PKI issues\n   The PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) Working Group wanted\
    \ to use public\n   key technology.  In the mid-90s, the basic principles of public\
    \ key\n   infrastructure had been patented for years.  The patent holder had\n\
    \   shown a tendency to actively enforce its rights, and to prefer\n   software\
    \ sales to licensing.  This was seen as a significant\n   potential issue, one\
    \ which could possibly interfere with the easy\n   deployment of Internet technology.\
    \  However, there was no alternative\n   technology that came close to its capabilities.\
    \  Adopting an\n   alternative would have damaged the standard's usefulness even\
    \ more\n   than adopting a technology with IPR claims.  The case was so\n   compelling\
    \ that the working group participants decided to move\n   forward on standardizing\
    \ it and even requiring it.\n   One factor which was noted was that the patents\
    \ were mature, and\n   would expire within a few years.  That meant that although\
    \ the\n   patents might be significant to start with, they would not be in the\n\
    \   long run.  This lowered the perceived risk of using the IPR-impacted\n   technology.\n\
    \   Lessons:\n   o  IPR is just one issue in deciding whether to adopt a technology.\n\
    \   o  IPR is not an all-or-nothing issue.  There are different types and\n  \
    \    levels of IPR protection.\n   o  The IPR's lifecycle phase can be a consideration.\n"
- title: 4.4.  VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
  contents:
  - "4.4.  VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)\n   The working group was standardizing\
    \ VRRP based on a protocol\n   developed outside the IETF.  The IPR claimant supported\
    \ that protocol\n   and stated that it would license its IPR for that protocol\
    \ if it\n   became the standard, but not for the similar protocol the working\n\
    \   group was developing.  The working group participants decided to go\n   ahead\
    \ and standardize the protocol developed in the working group\n   anyway.  The\
    \ IPR claimant has only claimed its patent when someone\n   else claimed a patent\
    \ against it.  There is no evidence that the\n   working group participants actually\
    \ thought about the implications of\n   the IPR claim when they went ahead with\
    \ their choice of protocol.\n   Lessons:\n   o  IPR claims should never be disregarded\
    \ without good cause.  Due\n      diligence should be done to understand the consequences\
    \ of each\n      claim.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Secure Shell (SecSH)
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Secure Shell (SecSH)\n   This is primarily an unfinished trademark issue,\
    \ not a patent issue,\n   since the patent issue has been worked out outside of\
    \ the IETF.  The\n   holder of a trademark wants the IETF to stop using \"SSH\"\
    \ in the names\n   and bodies of its proposed standards.  The working group participants\n\
    \   have thought through the details of the claims, and possible\n   implications\
    \ and risks, and decided to go ahead and continue using\n   the names as they\
    \ are now.\n   Lessons:\n   o  Working group participants can evaluate IPR claims\
    \ not only for\n      their possible validity, but also for the risk of misjudging\
    \ that\n      validity.  The impact of honoring the IPR claim may be major or\n\
    \      minor.\n"
- title: 4.6.  IDN (Internationalized Domain Name)
  contents:
  - "4.6.  IDN (Internationalized Domain Name)\n   The IDN Working Group dealt with\
    \ a number of IPR claims.  Several\n   were made which did not overlap with the\
    \ technology -- the IPR\n   claimants said the patents were being announced just\
    \ in case the\n   working group decided to go that way.  In one case, even though\
    \ a\n   patent was announced as purely defensive, many working group\n   participants\
    \ investigated the claims themselves.  They concluded that\n   it did not overlap.\n\
    \   In one case, an IPR claimant asserted that the working group's\n   documents,\
    \ and in fact the IETF as a whole, were infringing on its\n   rights.  Individual\
    \ working group participants consulted with their\n   legal advisers, concluded\
    \ that the claims would not overlap the\n   working group's developing technology,\
    \ and decided that they need not\n   be concerned about the claims.  This was\
    \ reflected in the direction\n   the group as a whole decided to take.\n   In\
    \ another case, patent claims were asserted that appeared to be\n   derived from\
    \ working group discussion, rather than vice versa (or\n   independent discovery).\
    \  The claimants were known to be following the\n   working group's work when\
    \ the ideas were proposed, and their patent\n   filing was considerably subsequent\
    \ to that time.\n   In 2000 the IDN Working Group discovered a patent that some\n\
    \   participants thought might apply to one of their main drafts.  If it\n   did,\
    \ it could affect their work profoundly -- to the extent that some\n   suggested\
    \ that if they could not work out reasonable licensing terms\n   with the IPR\
    \ claimant they might just disband.  As a group and\n   individually, participants\
    \ corresponded with the IPR claimant in\n   order to get an explicit statement\
    \ of licensing terms, preferably\n   royalty-free.  By doing so they gained a\
    \ better understanding of just\n   which working group activities were seen as\
    \ infringing on the patent,\n   and at least some understanding of the IPR claimant's\
    \ intentions and\n   philosophy.  Since the patent holder seemed to have an interest\
    \ in\n   using the patent for profit, the group discussed the issues on its\n\
    \   mailing list.  They overtly talked about how they could change their\n   proposed\
    \ technology to avoid having to contest the patent, and the\n   extent to which\
    \ the patent might be countered by claims of prior art.\n   Meanwhile, individually\
    \ they were talking to their legal advisors.\n   Gradually, a collective opinion\
    \ formed that the working group\n   documents did not infringe on the patent.\
    \  Since then, the patent has\n   been ignored.  However, they are keeping a watchful\
    \ eye out for\n   continuation patents which might have already been submitted.\n\
    \   Lessons:\n   o  It's sometimes beneficial to push IPR claimants to find out\
    \ what\n      they think their claims cover and what their licensing terms are.\n\
    \   o  Possibilities of prior art should be considered.\n   o  It's all right,\
    \ and sometimes beneficial, to discuss IPR claims\n      and gather information\
    \ about possible prior art on the group list.\n      The results of such discussion\
    \ can be considered when deciding\n      whether to develop a technology (but\
    \ remember that neither the\n      IETF nor any working group takes a stand on\
    \ such claims as a body,\n      and the group is not the best place to get legal\
    \ advice).\n"
- title: 5.  General Principles
  contents:
  - "5.  General Principles\n   Given the case studies above, there are a few principles\
    \ that working\n   groups can start with in dealing with IPR.  Every working group\
    \ needs\n   to develop and follow its own consensus, and actual treatments will\n\
    \   vary as much as they have in the past.  However, every working group\n   also\
    \ needs to take IPR seriously, and consider the needs of the\n   Internet community\
    \ and the public at large, including possible future\n   implementers and users\
    \ who will not have participated in the working\n   group process when the standardization\
    \ is taking place.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Types of IPR
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Types of IPR\n   A primer on the different types of IPR would be large,\
    \ unreliable,\n   and redundant with other Working Group documents [4][5][6].\
    \  For\n   informal exploration, see those documents and other relevant sources\n\
    \   on the web.  Readers with more serious concerns should consult their\n   legal\
    \ advisors.  In the United States, briefly:\n   o  Trademarks indicate the sources\
    \ of goods.  Service marks indicate\n      the sources of services.  They protect\
    \ the use of particular marks\n      or similar marks.\n   o  Copyrights protect\
    \ the expressions of ideas (not the ideas\n      themselves), in almost any form,\
    \ and allow \"fair use\".  Copyrights\n      expire but they can be renewed.\n\
    \   o  Patents protect \"inventions\".  They expire (utility patents expire\n\
    \      after 20 years), but follow-on patents can cover similar\n      technologies\
    \ and can have nearly the same implications for use in\n      the Internet as\
    \ the original patents.\n"
- title: 5.2.  When to Think About IPR
  contents:
  - "5.2.  When to Think About IPR\n   This memo does not describe IPR procedures\
    \ for document authors or\n   IPR claimants.  Rather, this memo is for working\
    \ group participants\n   who are trying to decide what to do about IPR claims\
    \ related to their\n   work.  A working group as a whole needs to think about\
    \ IPR issues:\n   o  when examining a technology, and deciding whether to initiate\
    \ work\n      on it.\n   o  when deciding whether to adopt a draft as a working\
    \ group\n      document.\n   o  when choosing between two or more working group\
    \ drafts that use\n      different technologies.\n   o  when deciding whether\
    \ to depend on a technology developed outside\n      the working group.\n   o\
    \  when comparing different kinds of IPR protection.\n   At each of these times,\
    \ the working group is strongly encouraged to\n   solicit disclosure of IPR claims\
    \ and licensing terms.  A working\n   group's job will be a lot easier if IPR\
    \ details are discovered early,\n   but it should realize that IPR claims may\
    \ appear at any time.\n   Working groups should anticipate that an IPR claimant\
    \ might choose\n   not to participate in the IETF, but instead to monitor from\
    \ a\n   distance while the relevant technology is being discussed and\n   evaluated.\
    \  A working group's knowledge of IPR claims may therefore\n   depend upon when\
    \ a claimant steps forward during the course of a\n   working group's deliberations.\n"
- title: 5.3.  IPR as a Technology Evaluation Factor
  contents:
  - "5.3.  IPR as a Technology Evaluation Factor\n   How do you weigh IPR claims against\
    \ other issues when deciding\n   whether to adopt a technology?\n   The ultimate\
    \ goal of the IETF is to promote the overall health,\n   robustness, flexibility,\
    \ and utility of the Internet infrastructure.\n   We base architectural decisions\
    \ on our long-term extrapolations of\n   requirements by thinking in these terms.\
    \  When considering a\n   particular technology, we compare it with other technologies\
    \ not just\n   for its elegance of design in and of itself, but also for how it\
    \ fits\n   in the bigger picture.  This is done at multiple levels.  It is\n \
    \  examined for how it fits into the overall design of the working\n   group's\
    \ output, how it fits into the particular Internet\n   infrastructure area, how\
    \ it fits with work going on in other areas,\n   and how it fits in the long view\
    \ of the Internet architecture.\n   Similarly, when evaluating a technology, working\
    \ group participants\n   consider IPR claims on it (including possible copyright\
    \ issues with\n   text describing it).  The issue is not whether a particular\
    \ piece of\n   technology is IPR-impacted -- we use IPR-impacted technology every\n\
    \   minute.  The question is how much the IPR protection will limit the\n   technology's\
    \ usefulness in building a robust, highly useful Internet.\n   Thus, the only\
    \ significant questions are: is the IPR claim relevant,\n   and what are the terms\
    \ under which the technology can be used?  When\n   technology is free from IPR\
    \ protection the answer is easy.  When it\n   is IPR-impacted, some licensing\
    \ terms make the IPR issues\n   insignificant compared to the engineering issues.\
    \  Other terms can\n   make a technology unusable even if it is perfect otherwise.\n\
    \   The problem with IPR as a technology evaluation factor is that it is\n   unlikely\
    \ that a working group, as an entity, can ever claim to have\n   reached consensus\
    \ on most IPR issues.  The IETF as a whole, and a\n   working group as a whole,\
    \ takes no stance on the validity of any IPR\n   claim.  It would be inappropriate\
    \ for a working group chair to\n   declare that consensus had been reached that,\
    \ for example, a\n   company's patent was invalid.  Individual participants will\
    \ need to\n   use whatever legal advice resources they have access to in order\
    \ to\n   form their own individual opinions.  Discussions about the validity\n\
    \   of IPR may take place under the auspices of the working group, in\n   particular\
    \ about relative risks of technology choices.  Individual\n   participants may\
    \ take these discussions into account.  The working\n   group as a body may not\
    \ take a stance on validity, but it may make\n   choices based on perceived risk.\n"

  - "5.4.  Patents versus Pending Patents Applied For\n   The IETF does not (cannot)\
    \ expect IPR claimants to tell a working\n   group specifically how they think\
    \ a particular patent applies.  If a\n   patent has already been granted, the\
    \ IETF can reasonably expect\n   disclosure of the patent number and possibly\
    \ the relevant IETF\n   document sections, which will allow working group participants\
    \ to\n   explore details of the claims.  If a patent has not yet been granted\n\
    \   (or if knowledge of the patent is restricted, e.g., for security\n   reasons),\
    \ significantly less information is available.  In most\n   countries patent applications\
    \ are published 18 months after they are\n   filed, but in the USA that can be\
    \ avoided if the applicant does not\n   also file outside the USA.  In some countries\
    \ applications are a\n   matter of public record, but details of pending claims\
    \ can be\n   modified at any time by the claim submitter before the patent is\n\
    \   granted.  It is not known before then what rights will actually be\n   granted.\
    \  Finally, rights can be contested in court, and nothing is\n   final until the\
    \ courts decide -- perhaps not even then.  All the IETF\n   can expect regarding\
    \ a pending patent is disclosure that it exists,\n   the related IETF documents,\
    \ and possibly the relevant IETF document\n   sections and some statement about\
    \ licensing terms.\n"
- title: '5.5.  Applicability: It''s Hard to Prove a Negative'
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Applicability: It's Hard to Prove a Negative\n   Working group participants\
    \ must make their own decisions about what\n   level of confidence they need as\
    \ to whether IPR is applicable.\n   However, perfect knowledge is not a worthwhile\
    \ goal.\n   In general, a working group should strive to find out about all IPR\n\
    \   claims related to technologies it is considering, and at least the\n   general\
    \ facts about licensing terms for each case -- for example\n   whether the terms\
    \ will be royalty-free, or perhaps \"reasonable and\n   non-discriminatory\".\
    \  Working group participants should also\n   investigate possibilities of prior\
    \ art which would counter the IPR\n   claims.  However, even if the working group\
    \ participants do\n   exhaustive searches, both externally and internally to their\n\
    \   employers, it is impossible to prove that a particular technology is\n   not\
    \ covered by a particular IPR claim, let alone prove that it is not\n   covered\
    \ by any IPR claim.  Anything a working group adopts may, in\n   the future, turn\
    \ out to be IPR-impacted, although the IPR claim may\n   not be discovered until\
    \ years later.  Claims are open to\n   interpretation even after rights are granted.\
    \  Drafts can be very\n   fluid, even up to the time of last call, and IPR issues\
    \ may\n   unknowingly be taken on at any time.  Absolute certainty about IPR\n\
    \   claims is rare.\n   However, the level of confidence needed to consider IPR\
    \ when\n   evaluating a technology is often not hard to get to.  There are cases\n\
    \   where risk is high (e.g., where licensing terms may be onerous) and\n   thus\
    \ a high level of confidence about applicability is needed, but\n   history shows\
    \ that most of the time \"rough\" confidence is good\n   enough.\n   In all cases,\
    \ licensing terms are a more significant consideration\n   than the validity of\
    \ the IPR claims.  Licensing terms often do not\n   limit the usefulness of the\
    \ technology.  It is difficult to be sure\n   about the validity of IPR claims.\
    \  If the licensing terms can be\n   determined to be reasonable, then the IPR\
    \ claims become much less\n   important.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Licensing Terms
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Licensing Terms\n   Licensing terms vary across a range from no license\
    \ required at all\n   to prohibitive.  In general, working groups show a preference\
    \ for\n   technologies with IPR considerations in approximately the following\n\
    \   order.  This list does not constitute a rule, and every working group\n  \
    \ needs to take its own circumstances into account.\n   o  License not required.\n\
    \   o  IPR licensed with no restrictions.\n   o  IPR licensed with no material\
    \ restrictions, e.g., no trademark\n      license required.\n   o  IPR licensed\
    \ for a particular field of use but with no other\n      material restrictions,\
    \ e.g., licensed solely for implementations\n      complying with a standard.\n\
    \   o  IPR licensed under royalty-free terms and reasonable and\n      non-discriminatory\
    \ restrictions.\n   o  IPR licensed under reasonable and non-discriminatory restrictions.\n\
    \      This may include payment of a royalty.\n   o  IPR which is otherwise licensable.\n\
    \   o  IPR which is not licensable, i.e., which is only available as an\n    \
    \  implementation.\n   o  IPR which is not available under any conditions.\n \
    \  Many IPR claimants do not like to publish specific terms under which\n   they\
    \ will issue licenses.  They may use standard terms for many\n   licensees, but\
    \ they prefer to negotiate terms for some.  Therefore,\n   do not expect any IPR\
    \ disclosure statement to lay out detailed\n   blanket terms for licensing.\n\
    \   If an IPR disclosure statement lists only vague terms, that doesn't\n   mean\
    \ the terms that will be offered in individual licenses will be\n   any worse\
    \ than those offered if an IPR disclosure makes very specific\n   statements.\
    \  Obviously, if an IPR claimant refuses to suggest any\n   terms at all, the\
    \ working group is going to have trouble evaluating\n   the future utility of\
    \ the technology.\n   There is a class of restriction which involves \"reciprocity\"\
    , in\n   which intellectual property may be licensed if the licensee is\n   willing\
    \ to license its intellectual property in return.  The\n   specificity of such\
    \ agreements can vary, and the same or similar\n   terms may be required.  Another\
    \ potential licensing restriction is\n   defensive suspension, where a licensor\
    \ may revoke or suspend the\n   license if the licensee asserts a patent claim\
    \ against the licensor.\n   For interpretation of any particular reciprocity or\
    \ related issue,\n   consult your legal adviser.\n   Words such as \"reasonable\"\
    , \"fair\", and \"non-discriminatory\" have no\n   objective legal or financial\
    \ definition.  The actual licensing terms\n   can vary tremendously.  Also, IPR\
    \ claimants have occasionally\n   asserted that there were already sufficient\
    \ licenses for a particular\n   technology to meet \"reasonable\" multisource\
    \ and competitiveness\n   requirements and, hence, that refusing to grant any\
    \ licenses to new\n   applicants was both fair and non-discriminatory.  The best\
    \ way to\n   find out what an IPR claimant really means by those terms is to ask,\n\
    \   explicitly.  It also helps to gather knowledge about licenses\n   actually\
    \ issued, for that technology or for others, and about other\n   experiences with\
    \ the IPR claimant.\n   Despite the fact that IPR claimants often don't like to\
    \ publish\n   explicit terms, there are levels of vagueness, and individuals and\n\
    \   even working groups can sometimes successfully push an IPR claimant\n   toward\
    \ less vagueness.  Many employers of IETF participants know that\n   the IETF\
    \ prefers explicit terms, and do feel pressure to produce\n   them.\n   If working\
    \ group participants are dissatisfied with the confidence\n   level they can obtain\
    \ directly about licensing terms for a particular\n   technology, they can possibly\
    \ extrapolate from history.  In order for\n   licensed technology to become a\
    \ draft standard, at least two\n   independent licenses need to have been issued.\
    \  If the IPR claimant\n   for the technology the working group is considering\
    \ has licensed\n   other technology in the past, there is a record of the sorts\
    \ of terms\n   they are willing to grant, at least in those specific cases.  This\n\
    \   sort of thing is weak but everything counts, and it may be of some\n   help.\n\
    \   In many jurisdictions that issue patents, inventors are required to\n   file\
    \ patent applications within 12 months of public disclosure or use\n   of a novel\
    \ method or process.  Since many of these jurisdictions also\n   provide for publication\
    \ of pending patent applications 18 months\n   after a patent application is filed,\
    \ the ability to determine whether\n   or not claims have been made at all relating\
    \ to a particular\n   technology increases 30 months (12 + 18) after the public\
    \ disclosure\n   or use of that technology.\n"
- title: 5.7.  Third-Party Disclosure of IPR Claims
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Third-Party Disclosure of IPR Claims\n   It is good to notify the IETF\
    \ of relevant IPR claims even when they\n   are not one's own, and [6] says to\
    \ do so \"as soon as possible\".\n   However, anyone considering such a disclosure\
    \ should do some\n   preliminary exploration with the affected working group(s)\
    \ beforehand\n   (see Section 5.7.1).  Third-party disclosure is a potential denial\
    \ of\n   service threat to the working group, and therefore it is good form to\n\
    \   proceed slowly at first.\n   Working group participants should be aware that\
    \ third-party\n   disclosure can be used, knowingly or unknowingly, to defocus\
    \ and\n   distract the working group and hinder its progress.  They should\n \
    \  evaluate third-party disclosures accordingly.  Working group chairs\n   should\
    \ be willing and able to discipline those they think are using\n   the third-party\
    \ disclosure system inappropriately.  Those who think\n   they are being unfairly\
    \ blocked may take the matter up with the Area\n   Directors and/or the IESG.\n\
    \   All of the criteria for evaluating IPR claims discussed in the\n   sections\
    \ above apply in the case of third-party disclosures as well,\n   to the extent\
    \ they can be practiced.\n"
- title: 5.7.1.  Third-Party Disclosure Advice
  contents:
  - "5.7.1.  Third-Party Disclosure Advice\n   This subsection provides advice to\
    \ those considering making\n   third-party disclosures.  While not required, the\
    \ actions described\n   here are encouraged to aid working groups in dealing with\
    \ the\n   possible implications of third-party disclosures.  In evaluating what\n\
    \   (if anything) to do in response to a third-party disclosure, a\n   working\
    \ group may consider the extent to which the discloser has\n   followed this advice\
    \ (for example, in considering whether a\n   disclosure is intended primarily\
    \ to defocus and distract the working\n   group).\n   In general a potential discloser\
    \ should exchange mail with the\n   working group chair(s) first, to open the\
    \ way for discussion.  Also,\n   if the potential discloser is not sure if the\
    \ IPR claim applies, this\n   is the time to reach some kind of agreement with\
    \ the working group\n   chair(s) before saying anything publicly.  After discussion\
    \ with the\n   working group chair(s), the potential discloser should bring the\n\
    \   issue to the attention of the working group, and to the attention of\n   the\
    \ IPR claimant if doing so is not too difficult.  Such discussion\n   should help\
    \ the potential discloser to become more sure, one way or\n   the other.  If the\
    \ potential discloser is sure the discovered IPR\n   claim applies, and the IPR\
    \ claimant does not submit a first-party\n   disclosure itself, then the potential\
    \ discloser is encouraged to\n   submit a third-party disclosure.\n   Intellectual\
    \ property often applies to more than one working group.\n   A person thinking\
    \ of making a third-party disclosure should consider\n   what other working groups\
    \ might be affected, and communicate with\n   them in the same manner.\n   Don't\
    \ bring up IPR issues that are unrelated to the areas where the\n   working group\
    \ is focusing at that time.  Don't bring IPR claims to\n   the working group's\
    \ attention just in case they might be relevant in\n   a few months, but only\
    \ if they have implications for current work.\n   Messages to the working group\
    \ list should be substantive, and a\n   single message should focus on a specific\
    \ issue.  They can reference\n   multiple claims or patents related to that issue.\n"
