  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DHCPv4 [RFC2131] publicly defined options range, options\
    \ 1 - 127,\n   is nearly used up.  Efforts such as [RFC3679] help extend the life\
    \ of\n   this space, but ultimately the space will be exhausted.\n   This document\
    \ reclassifies much of the site-specific option range,\n   which has not been\
    \ widely used for its original intended purpose, to\n   extend the publicly defined\
    \ options space.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Notation\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   The DHCP option space (0 - 255) is divided into two ranges\
    \ [RFC2132]:\n   1. 1 - 127 are publicly defined options, now allocated in accordance\n\
    \      with [RFC2939].\n   2. 128 - 254 are site-specific options.\n   Options\
    \ 0 (pad) and 255 (end) are special and defined in [RFC2131].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Publicly Defined Options Range
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Publicly Defined Options Range\n   The publicly defined options space (1\
    \ - 127) is nearly exhausted.\n   Recent work [RFC3679] will buy more time, as\
    \ several allocated but\n   unused option codes have been reclaimed.  A review\
    \ could be made from\n   time to time to determine whether there are other option\
    \ codes that\n   can be reclaimed.\n   A longer-term solution to the eventual\
    \ exhaustion of the publicly\n   defined options space is desired.  The DHC WG\
    \ evaluated several\n   solutions:\n   1. Using options 126 and 127 to carry 16-bit\
    \ options as originally\n      proposed by Ralph Droms in late 1996.  However,\
    \ this significantly\n      penalizes the first option assigned to this new space,\
    \ as it\n      requires implementing the 16-bit option support.  Because of this,\n\
    \      options 126 and 127 have been reclaimed [RFC3679].\n   2. Using a new magic\
    \ cookie and 16-bit option code format.  However,\n      this proposal\n     \
    \ *  penalizes the first option assigned to this new space, as it\n         requires\
    \ significant changes to clients, servers, and relay\n         agents,\n     \
    \ *  could adversely impact existing clients, servers, and relay\n         agents\
    \ that fail to properly check the magic cookie value,\n      *  requires support\
    \ of both message formats for the foreseeable\n         future, and\n      * \
    \ requires clients to send multiple DHCPDISCOVER messages -- one\n         for\
    \ each magic cookie.\n   3. Reclassifying a portion of the site-specific option\
    \ codes as\n      publicly defined.  The impact is minimal, as only those sites\n\
    \      presently using options in the reclassified range need to renumber\n  \
    \    their options.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Site-Specific Options Range
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Site-Specific Options Range\n   The site-specific option range is rather\
    \ large (127 options in all)\n   and little used.  The original intent of the\
    \ site-specific option\n   range was to support local (to a site) configuration\
    \ options, and it\n   is difficult to believe a site would need 127 options for\
    \ this\n   purpose.  Further, many DHCP client implementations do not provide\
    \ a\n   well documented means to request site-specific options from a server\n\
    \   or to allow applications to extract the returned option values.\n   Some vendors\
    \ have made use of site-specific option codes that violate\n   the intent of the\
    \ site-specific options, as the options are used to\n   configure features of\
    \ their products and thus are specific to many\n   sites.  This usage could potentially\
    \ cause problems if a site that\n   has been using the same site-specific option\
    \ codes for other purposes\n   deploys products from one of the vendors, or if\
    \ two vendors pick the\n   same site-specific options.\n"
- title: 4.  Reclassifying Options
  contents:
  - "4.  Reclassifying Options\n   The site-specific option codes 128 to 223 are hereby\
    \ reclassified as\n   publicly defined options.  This leaves 31 site-specific\
    \ options, 224\n   to 254.\n   To allow vendors that have made use of site-specific\
    \ options within\n   the reclassified range to publish their option usage and\
    \ to request\n   an official assignment of the option number to that usage, the\n\
    \   following procedure will be used to reclassify these options:\n   1. The reclassified\
    \ options (128 to 223) will be placed in the\n      \"Unavailable\" state by IANA.\
    \  These options are not yet available\n      for assignment to publicly defined\
    \ options.\n   2. Vendors that currently use one or more of the reclassified options\n\
    \      have 6 months following this RFC's publication date to notify the\n   \
    \   DHC WG and IANA that they are using particular options numbers and\n     \
    \ agree to document that usage in an RFC.  IANA will move these\n      options\
    \ from the \"Unavailable\" to \"Tentatively Assigned\" state.\n      Vendors have\
    \ 18 months from this RFC's publication date to start\n      the documentation\
    \ process by submitting an Internet-Draft.\n      NOTE: If multiple vendors of\
    \ an option number come forward and can\n      demonstrate that their usage is\
    \ in reasonably wide use, none of\n      the vendors will be allowed to keep the\
    \ current option number, and\n      they MUST go through the normal process of\
    \ getting a publicly\n      assigned option [RFC2939].\n   3. Any options still\
    \ classified as \"Unavailable\" 6 months after the\n      RFC publication date\
    \ will be moved to the \"Unassigned\" state by\n      IANA.  These options may\
    \ then be assigned to any new publicly\n      defined options in accordance with\
    \ [RFC2939].\n   4. For those options in the \"Tentatively Assigned\" state, vendors\n\
    \      have 18 months following this RFC's publication date to submit an\n   \
    \   Internet-Draft documenting the option.  The documented usage MUST\n      be\
    \ consistent with the existing usage.  When the option usage is\n      published\
    \ as an RFC, IANA will move the option to the \"Assigned\"\n      state.\n   \
    \   If no Internet-Draft is published within the 18 months or should\n      one\
    \ of these Internet-Drafts expire after the 18 months, IANA will\n      move the\
    \ option to the \"Unassigned\" state, and the option may then\n      be assigned\
    \ to any new publicly defined options in accordance with\n      [RFC2939].\n \
    \  Sites presently using site-specific option codes within the\n   reclassified\
    \ range SHOULD take steps to renumber these options to\n   values within the remaining\
    \ range.  If a site needs more than 31\n   site-specific options, the site must\
    \ switch to using suboptions, as\n   has been done for other options, such as\
    \ the Relay Agent Information\n   Option [RFC3046].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document in and by itself provides no security,\
    \ nor does it\n   impact existing DCHP security as described in [RFC2131].\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   IANA is requested to\n   1. expand the publicly defined\
    \ DHCPv4 options space from 1 - 127 to 1\n      - 223.  The new options (128 -\
    \ 223) are to be listed as\n      \"Unavailable\" and MUST NOT be assigned to\
    \ any publicly defined\n      options.\n   2. receive notices from vendors that\
    \ have been using one or more of\n      the options in the 128-223 range that\
    \ they are using the option\n      and are willing to document that usage.  IANA\
    \ will list these\n      options as \"Tentatively Assigned\".\n   3. change the\
    \ listing of any options listed as \"Unavailable\" to\n      \"Available\" 6 months\
    \ from this RFC's publication date.  These\n      options may now be assigned\
    \ in accordance with [RFC2939].\n   4. change the listing of any options listed\
    \ as \"Tentatively-Assigned\"\n      to \"Unavailable\" 18 months from this RFC's\
    \ publication date and\n      periodically thereafter as long as there is an option\
    \ listed as\n      \"Tentatively-Assigned\", if no un-expired Internet-Draft exists\n\
    \      documenting the usage.\n"
