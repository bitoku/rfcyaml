  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private\
    \ hosts\n   all over the world for over 30 years.  However, due to the success\
    \ of\n   the Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking,\n\
    \   billions of hosts are now connected via the Internet and require\n   unique\
    \ addressing.  This demand has led to the exhaustion of the IANA\n   global pool\
    \ of unique IPv4 addresses [IANA-EXHAUST], and will be\n   followed by the exhaustion\
    \ of the free pools for each Regional\n   Internet Registry (RIR), the first of\
    \ which is APNIC [APNIC-EXHAUST].\n   While transition technologies and other\
    \ means to extend the lifespan\n   of IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come with\
    \ trade-offs that\n   prevent them from being optimal long-term solutions when\
    \ compared\n   with deployment of IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow continued\n\
    \   growth on the Internet.  See [RFC6269] and [NAT444-IMPACTS] for some\n   discussion\
    \ on this topic.\n   IPv6 [RFC1883] was proposed in 1995 as, among other things,\
    \ a\n   solution to the limitations on globally unique addressing that IPv4's\n\
    \   32-bit addressing space represented, and has been under continuous\n   refinement\
    \ (e.g., [RFC2460]) and deployment ever since.  The\n   exhaustion of IPv4 and\
    \ the continued growth of the Internet worldwide\n   have created the driver for\
    \ widespread IPv6 deployment.\n   However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce\
    \ reliance on IPv4 has\n   been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and\
    \ software support\n   throughout the industry.  Many vendors, especially in the\
    \ consumer\n   space, have continued to view IPv6 support as optional.  Even today,\n\
    \   they are still selling \"IP-capable\" or \"Internet-Capable\" devices\n  \
    \ that are not IPv6-capable, which has continued to push out the point\n   at\
    \ which the natural hardware refresh cycle will significantly\n   increase IPv6\
    \ support in the average home or enterprise network.\n   They are also choosing\
    \ not to update existing software to enable IPv6\n   support on software-updatable\
    \ devices, which is a problem because it\n   is not realistic to expect that the\
    \ hardware refresh cycle will\n   single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices from\
    \ the active network in a\n   reasonable amount of time.  This is a significant\
    \ problem, especially\n   in the consumer space, where the network operator often\
    \ has no\n   control over the hardware the consumer chooses to use.  For the same\n\
    \   reason that the average consumer is not making a purchasing decision\n   based\
    \ on the presence of IPv6 support in their Internet-capable\n   devices and services,\
    \ consumers are unlikely to replace their still-\n   functional Internet-capable\
    \ devices simply to add IPv6 support --\n   they don't know or don't care about\
    \ IPv6; they simply want their\n   devices to work as advertised.\n   This lack\
    \ of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition\n   considerably more difficult,\
    \ and drives the need for expensive and\n   complicated transition technologies\
    \ to extend the life of IPv4-only\n   devices as well as to eventually interwork\
    \ IPv4-only and IPv6-only\n   hosts.  While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the\
    \ Internet with IPv6\n   for many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant\
    \ Internet\n   Protocol version towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol\n\
    \   version will need to occur.  The sooner the majority of devices\n   support\
    \ IPv6, the less protracted this transition period will be.\n"
- title: 2.  Clarifications and Recommendation
  contents:
  - "2.  Clarifications and Recommendation\n   To ensure interoperability and proper\
    \ function after IPv4 exhaustion,\n   support for IPv6 is virtually a requirement.\
    \  Rather than update the\n   existing IPv4 protocol specification standards to\
    \ include IPv6, the\n   IETF has defined a completely separate set of standalone\
    \ documents\n   that cover IPv6.  Therefore, implementers are cautioned that a\n\
    \   distinction must be made between IPv4 and IPv6 in some IETF documents\n  \
    \ where the term \"IP\" is used generically.  Current requirements for\n   IPv6\
    \ support can be found in [RFC6204] and [RFC6434].  Each of these\n   documents\
    \ contains specific information, requirements, and references\n   to other Draft\
    \ and Proposed Standards governing many aspects of IPv6\n   implementation.\n\
    \   Many of the IETF's early documents use the generic term \"IP\"\n   synonymously\
    \ with the more specific \"IPv4\".  Some examples of this\n   potential confusion\
    \ can be found in [RFC1812], especially in\n   Sections 1, 2, and 4.  Since RFC\
    \ 1812 is an IPv4 router\n   specification, the generic use of IP in this standard\
    \ may cause\n   confusion as the term \"IP\" can now be interpreted to mean\n\
    \   IPv4 + IPv6, IPv6-only, or IPv4-only.  Additionally, [RFC1122] is no\n   longer\
    \ a complete definition of \"IP\" or the Internet Protocol suite\n   by itself,\
    \ because it does not include IPv6.  For example,\n   Section 3.1 does not contain\
    \ references to the equivalent standards\n   for IPv6 for the Internet layer,\
    \ Section 3.2 is a protocol\n   walk-through for IPv4 only, and Section 3.2.1.1\
    \ explicitly requires\n   that an IP datagram whose version number is not 4 be\
    \ discarded, which\n   would be detrimental to IPv6 forwarding.  Additional instances\
    \ of\n   this type of problem exist that are not discussed here.  Since\n   existing\
    \ RFCs say \"IP\" in places where they may mean IPv4,\n   implementers are cautioned\
    \ to ensure that they know whether a given\n   standard is inclusive or exclusive\
    \ of IPv6.  To ensure\n   interoperability, implementers building IP nodes will\
    \ need to support\n   both IPv4 and IPv6.  If the standard does not include an\
    \ integral\n   definition of both IPv4 and IPv6, implementers need to use the\
    \ other\n   informative references in this document as companion guidelines for\n\
    \   proper IPv6 implementations.\n   To ensure interoperability and flexibility,\
    \ the best practices are as\n   follows:\n   o  New IP implementations must support\
    \ IPv6.\n   o  Updates to current IP implementations should support IPv6.\n  \
    \ o  IPv6 support must be equivalent or better in quality and\n      functionality\
    \ when compared to IPv4 support in a new or updated IP\n      implementation.\n\
    \   o  New and updated IP networking implementations should support IPv4\n   \
    \   and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but must not require IPv4 for\n      proper\
    \ and complete function.\n   o  Implementers are encouraged to update existing\
    \ hardware and\n      software to enable IPv6 wherever technically feasible.\n"
