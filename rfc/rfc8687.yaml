    \  This issue is solved by advertising cross-\n   address family (X-AF) OSPF TE\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   TE extensions to OSPFv2 [RFC3630] and OSPFv3 [RFC5329] have\
    \ been\n   described to support intra-area TE in IPv4 and IPv6 networks,\n   respectively.\
    \  In both cases, the TE database provides a tight\n   coupling between the routed\
    \ protocol and advertised TE signaling\n   information.  In other words, any use\
    \ of the TE database is limited\n   to IPv4 for OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and IPv6 for\
    \ OSPFv3 [RFC5340].\n   In a dual-stack network, it may be desirable to set up\
    \ common MPLS TE\n   LSPs to carry traffic destined to addresses from different\
    \ address\n   families on a router.  The use of common LSPs eases potential\n\
    \   scalability and management concerns by halving the number of LSPs in\n   the\
    \ network.  Besides, it allows operators to group traffic based on\n   business\
    \ characteristics, class of service, and/or applications; the\n   operators are\
    \ not constrained by the network protocol used.\n   For example, an LSP created\
    \ based on MPLS TE information propagated\n   by an OSPFv2 instance can be used\
    \ to transport both IPv4 and IPv6\n   traffic, as opposed to using both OSPFv2\
    \ and OSPFv3 to provision a\n   separate LSP for each address family.  Even if,\
    \ in some cases, the\n   address-family-specific traffic is to be separated, calculation\
    \ from\n   a common TE database may prove to be operationally beneficial.\n  \
    \ During the SPF calculation on the TE tunnel head-end router, OSPF\n   computes\
    \ shortcut routes using TE tunnels.  A commonly used algorithm\n   for computing\
    \ shortcuts is defined in [RFC3906].  For that or any\n   similar algorithm to\
    \ work with a common MPLS TE infrastructure in a\n   dual-stack network, a requirement\
    \ is to reliably map the X-AF\n   addresses to the corresponding tail-end router.\
    \  This mapping is a\n   challenge because the Link State Advertisements (LSAs)\
    \ containing the\n   routing information are carried in one OSPF instance, while\
    \ the TE\n   calculations may be done using a TE database from a different OSPF\n\
    \   instance.\n   A simple solution to this problem is to rely on the Router ID\
    \ to\n   identify a node in the corresponding OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Link State\n \
    \  Databases (LSDBs).  This solution would mandate both instances on the\n   same\
    \ router to be configured with the same Router ID.  However,\n   relying on the\
    \ correctness of configuration puts additional burden\n   and cost on the operation\
    \ of the network.  The network becomes even\n   more difficult to manage if OSPFv2\
    \ and OSPFv3 topologies do not match\n   exactly, for example, if area borders\
    \ are chosen differently in the\n   two protocols.  Also, if the routing processes\
    \ do fall out of sync\n   (e.g., having different Router IDs for local administrative\
    \ reasons),\n   there is no defined way for other routers to discover such\n \
    \  misalignment and to take corrective measures (such as to avoid\n   routing\
    \ traffic through affected TE tunnels or alerting the network\n   administrators).\
    \  The use of misaligned Router IDs may result in\n   delivering the traffic to\
    \ the wrong tail-end router, which could lead\n   to suboptimal routing or even\
    \ traffic loops.\n   This document describes an update to [RFC5786] that allows\
    \ for the\n   easy identification of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.  [RFC5786]\n\
    \   defined the Node IPv4 Local Address and Node IPv6 Local Address sub-\n   TLVs\
    \ of the Node Attribute TLV for a router to advertise additional\n   local IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 addresses.  However, [RFC5786] did not describe\n   the advertisement\
    \ and usage of these sub-TLVs when the address family\n   of the advertised local\
    \ address differed from the address family of\n   the OSPF traffic engineering\
    \ protocol.\n   This document updates [RFC5786] so that a router can also announce\n\
    \   one or more local X-AF addresses using the corresponding Local\n   Address\
    \ sub-TLV.  Routers using the Node Attribute TLV [RFC5786] can\n   include non-TE-enabled\
    \ interface addresses in their OSPF TE\n   advertisements and also use the same\
    \ sub-TLVs to carry X-AF\n   information, facilitating the mapping described above.\n\
    \   The method specified in this document can also be used to compute the\n  \
    \ X-AF mapping of the egress Label Switching Router (LSR) for sub-LSPs\n   of\
    \ a Point-to-Multipoint LSP [RFC4461].  Considerations of using\n   Point-to-Multipoint\
    \ MPLS TE for X-AF traffic forwarding is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"

- title: 3.  Operation
  contents:
  - "3.  Operation\n   To implement the X-AF routing technique described in this document,\n\
    \   OSPFv2 will advertise the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV and OSPFv3\n   will\
    \ advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV, possibly in\n   addition to advertising\
    \ other IP addresses as documented by\n   [RFC5786].\n   Multiple instances of\
    \ OSPFv3 are needed if it is used for both IPv4\n   and IPv6 [RFC5838].  The operation\
    \ in this section is described with\n   OSPFv2 as the protocol used for IPv4;\
    \ that is the most common case.\n   The case of OSPFv3 being used for IPv4 follows\
    \ the same procedure as\n   what is indicated for OSPFv2 below.\n   On a node\
    \ that implements X-AF routing, each OSPF instance\n   advertises, using the Node\
    \ Local Address sub-TLV, all X-AF IPv6 (for\n   OSPFv2 instance) or IPv4 (for\
    \ OSPFv3) addresses local to the router\n   that can be used by the Constrained\
    \ Shortest Path First (CSPF) to\n   calculate MPLS TE LSPs:\n   *  The OSPF instance\
    \ MUST advertise the IP address listed in the\n      Router Address TLV [RFC3630]\
    \ [RFC5329] of the X-AF instance\n      maintaining the TE database.\n   *  The\
    \ OSPF instance SHOULD include additional local addresses\n      advertised by\
    \ the X-AF OSPF instance in its Node Local Address\n      sub-TLVs.\n   *  An\
    \ implementation MAY advertise other local X-AF addresses.\n   When TE information\
    \ is advertised in an OSPF instance, both natively\n   (i.e., as per RFC [RFC3630]\
    \ or [RFC5329]) and as X-AF Node Attribute\n   TLV, it is left to local configuration\
    \ to determine which TE database\n   is used to compute routes for the OSPF instance.\n\
    \   On Area Border Routers (ABRs), each advertised X-AF IP address MUST\n   be\
    \ advertised into, at most, one area.  If OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 ABRs\n   coincide\
    \ (i.e., the areas for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 interfaces are\n   the same), then\
    \ the X-AF addresses MUST be advertised into the same\n   area in both instances.\
    \  This allows other ABRs connected to the same\n   set of areas to know with\
    \ which area to associate computed MPLS TE\n   tunnels.\n   During the X-AF routing\
    \ calculation, X-AF IP addresses are used to\n   map locally created LSPs to tail-end\
    \ routers in the LSDB.  The\n   mapping algorithm can be described as:\n     \
    \ Walk the list of all MPLS TE tunnels for which the computing\n      router is\
    \ a head end.  For each MPLS TE tunnel T:\n      1.  If T's destination address\
    \ is from the same address family as\n          the OSPF instance associated with\
    \ the LSDB, then the\n          extensions defined in this document do not apply.\n\
    \      2.  Otherwise, it is a X-AF MPLS TE tunnel.  Note the tunnel's\n      \
    \    destination IP address.\n      3.  Walk the X-AF IP addresses in the LSDBs\
    \ of all connected\n          areas.  If a matching IP address is found, advertised\
    \ by\n          router R in area A, then mark the tunnel T as belonging to\n \
    \         area A and terminating on tail-end router R.  Assign the\n         \
    \ intra-area SPF cost to reach router R within area A as the IGP\n          cost\
    \ of tunnel T.\n   After completing this calculation, each TE tunnel is associated\
    \ with\n   an area and tail-end router in terms of the routing LSDB of the\n \
    \  computing OSPF instance and has a cost.\n   The algorithm described above is\
    \ to be used only if the Node Local\n   Address sub-TLV includes X-AF information.\n\
    \   Note that, for clarity of description, the mapping algorithm is\n   specified\
    \ as a single calculation.  Implementations may choose to\n   support equivalent\
    \ mapping functionality without implementing the\n   algorithm as described.\n\
    \   As an example, consider a router in a dual-stack network using OSPFv2\n  \
    \ and OSPFv3 for IPv4 and IPv6 routing, respectively.  Suppose the\n   OSPFv2\
    \ instance is used to propagate MPLS TE information and the\n   router is configured\
    \ to accept TE LSPs terminating at local addresses\n   198.51.100.1 and 198.51.100.2.\
    \  The router advertises in OSPFv2 the\n   IPv4 address 198.51.100.1 in the Router\
    \ Address TLV, the additional\n   local IPv4 address 198.51.100.2 in the Node\
    \ IPv4 Local Address sub-\n   TLV, and other TE TLVs as required by [RFC3630].\
    \  If the OSPFv3\n   instance in the network is enabled for X-AF TE routing (that\
    \ is, to\n   use MPLS TE LSPs computed by OSPFv2 for IPv6 routing), then the\n\
    \   OSPFv3 instance of the router will advertise the Node IPv4 Local\n   Address\
    \ sub-TLV listing the local IPv4 addresses 198.51.100.1 and\n   198.51.100.2.\
    \  Other routers in the OSPFv3 network will use this\n   information to reliably\
    \ identify this router as the egress LSR for\n   MPLS TE LSPs terminating at either\
    \ 198.51.100.1 or 198.51.100.2.\n"

  - "4.  Backward Compatibility\n   Only routers that serve as endpoints for one or\

    \   *  Tunnel tail-end routers advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-\n  \
    \    TLV and/or the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV.\n   *  Tunnel head-end routers\
    \ perform the X-AF routing calculation.\n   Both the endpoints MUST be upgraded\
    \ before the tail end starts\n   advertising the X-AF information.  Other routers\
    \ in the network do\n   not need to support X-AF procedures.\n"

    \ reachability.  The\n   implication is that if the Local TE Router ID sub-TLV\
    \ is present in\n   the Node Attribute TLV, then the procedures in [RFC6827] apply,\n\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes the use of the Local\
    \ Address sub-TLVs to\n   provide X-AF information.  The advertisement of these\
    \ sub-TLVs, in\n   any OSPF instance, is not precluded by [RFC5786].  As such,\
    \ no new\n   security threats are introduced beyond the considerations in OSPFv2\n\
    \   [RFC2328], OSPFv3 [RFC5340], and [RFC5786].\n   The X-AF information is not\
    \ used for SPF computation or normal\n   routing, so the mechanism specified here\
    \ has no effect on IP routing.\n   However, generating incorrect information or\
    \ tampering with the sub-\n   TLVs may have an effect on traffic engineering computations.\n\
    \   Specifically, TE traffic may be delivered to the wrong tail-end\n   router,\
    \ which could lead to suboptimal routing, traffic loops, or\n   exposing the traffic\
    \ to attacker inspection or modification.  These\n   threats are already present\
    \ in other TE-related specifications, and\n   their considerations apply here\
    \ as well, including [RFC3630] and\n   [RFC5329].\n"
