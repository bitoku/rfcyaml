  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in enterprise\
    \ networks\n   focusing on IP Layer 3.  These networks are characterized as having\n\
    \   multiple internal links, and one or more router connections to one or\n  \
    \ more Providers, and as being managed by a network operations entity.\n   The\
    \ analysis focuses on a base set of transition notational networks\n   and requirements\
    \ expanded from a previous document on enterprise\n   scenarios.  Discussion is\
    \ provided on a focused set of transition\n   analysis required for the enterprise\
    \ to transition to IPv6, assuming\n   a Dual-IP layer (IPv4 and IPv6) network\
    \ and node environment within\n   the enterprise.  Then, a set of transition mechanisms\
    \ are recommended\n   for each notational network.\n   The audience for this document\
    \ is the enterprise network team\n   considering deployment of IPv6.  The document\
    \ will be useful for\n   enterprise teams that have to determine the IPv6 transition\
    \ strategy\n   for their enterprise.  It is expected that those teams include\n\
    \   members from management, network operations, and engineering.  The\n   analysis\
    \ and notational networks presented provide an example set of\n   cases the enterprise\
    \ can use to build an IPv6 transition strategy.\n   The enterprise analysis begins\
    \ by describing a matrix as a tool to be\n   used to portray the different IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 possibilities for\n   deployment.  The document will then provide analysis\
    \ to support\n   enterprise-wide Dual-IP layer deployment strategy, to provide\
    \ the\n   reader with a view of how that can be planned and what options are\n\
    \   available.  The document then discusses the deployment of sparse IPv6\n  \
    \ nodes within the enterprise and the requirements that need to be\n   considered\
    \ and implemented when the enterprise remains with an IPv4-\n   only routing infrastructure\
    \ for some time.  The next discussion\n   focuses on the use of IPv6 when it is\
    \ determined to be dominant\n   across or within parts of the enterprise network.\n\
    \   The document then discusses the general issues and applicability from\n  \
    \ the previous analysis.  The document concludes by providing a set of\n   current\
    \ transition mechanism recommendations for the notational\n   network scenarios\
    \ to support an enterprise that is planning to deploy\n   IPv6.\n   As stated,\
    \ this document focuses only on the deployment cases where a\n   Dual-IP Layer\
    \ 3 is supported across the network and on the nodes in\n   the enterprise.  Additional\
    \ deployment transition analysis will be\n   required from the effects of an IPv6-only\
    \ node or Provider\n   deployments, and is beyond the scope of this document.\
    \  In addition,\n   this document does not attempt to define or discuss any use\
    \ with\n   network address translation [NATPT] or Provider Independent address\n\
    \   space.\n   The following specific topics are currently out of scope for this\n\
    \   document:\n    - Multihoming\n    - Application transition/porting (see [APPS]).\n\
    \    - IPv6 VPN, firewall, or intrusion detection deployment.\n    - IPv6 network\
    \ management and QoS deployment.\n    - Detailed IT Department requirements.\n\
    \    - Deployment of novel IPv6 services, e.g., Mobile IPv6.\n    - Requirements\
    \ or Transition at the Providers' network.\n    - Transport protocol selection\
    \ for applications with IPv6.\n    - Application layer and configuration issues.\n\
    \    - IPv6 only future deployment scenarios.\n   This document focuses on IP\
    \ Layer 3 deployment in the same way as the\n   other IPv6 deployment analysis\
    \ works have done [UMAN] [ISPA] [3GPA].\n   This document covers deployment of\
    \ IPv6 \"on the wire\", including\n   address management and DNS services.\n \
    \  We are also assuming that the enterprise deployment is being\n   undertaken\
    \ by the network administration team, i.e., this document\n   does not discuss\
    \ the case of an individual user gaining IPv6\n   connectivity (to some external\
    \ IPv6 provider) from within an\n   enterprise network.  Much of the analysis\
    \ is applicable to wireless\n   networks, but there are additional considerations\
    \ for wireless\n   networks not contained within this document.\n   In Section\
    \ 2, we introduce the terminology used in this document.  In\n   Section 3, we\
    \ introduce and define a tools matrix and define the IP\n   Layer 3 connectivity\
    \ requirements.  In Section 4, we discuss wide\n   scale Dual-IP layer use within\
    \ an enterprise.  In Section 5, we\n   discuss sparse Dual-IP layer deployment\
    \ within an enterprise.  In\n   Section 6, we discuss IPv6-dominant network deployment\
    \ within the\n   enterprise.  In Section 7, we discuss general issues and\n  \
    \ applicability.  In Section 8, a set of transition mechanisms that can\n   support\
    \ the deployment of IPv6 with an enterprise are recommended.\n   This document\
    \ then provides Appendix A for readers depicting a Crisis\n   Management enterprise\
    \ network to demonstrate an enterprise network\n   example that requires all the\
    \ properties as analyzed in Sections 3,\n   4, 5, 6, and 7.  In addition, we recommend\
    \ that readers of this\n   document also read another use-case document to support\
    \ an IPv6\n   Transition for a Campus Network [CAMP].\n   Readers should also\
    \ be aware that a parallel effort for an enterprise\n   to transition to IPv6\
    \ is training, but out of scope for this\n   document.\n"

- title: 3.  Enterprise Matrix Analysis for Transition
  contents:
  - "3.  Enterprise Matrix Analysis for Transition\n   In order to identify the best-suited\
    \ transition mechanisms for an\n   enterprise, it is recommended that the enterprise\
    \ have an in-depth\n   up-to-date understanding of its current IT environment.\
    \  This\n   understanding will help choose the best-suited transition mechanisms.\n\
    \   It is important to note that one size does not fit all.  Selection of\n  \
    \ mechanisms that reduce the impact on the existing environment is\n   suggested.\
    \  When selecting a transition mechanism, one must consider\n   the functionality\
    \ required, its scalability characteristic, and the\n   security implications\
    \ of each mechanism.\n   To provide context for an analysis of the transitioning\
    \ enterprise at\n   Layer 3, we have provided a matrix that describes various\
    \ scenarios\n   which might be encountered during an IPv6 transition.  The notional\n\
    \   enterprise network is comprised of hosts attached to an enterprise-\n   owned\
    \ intranet(s) at two different global locations separated by the\n   Internet.\
    \  The enterprise owns, operates, and maintains its own\n   intranetworks, but\
    \ relies on an external provider organization that\n   offers Internet Service.\
    \  Both local and destination intranetworks\n   are operated by different organizations\
    \ within the same enterprise\n   and consequently could have different IP-capability\
    \ than other\n   intranetworks at certain times in the transition period.\n  \
    \ Addressing every possible combination of network IP-capability in\n   this notional\
    \ enterprise network is impractical; therefore, trivial\n   notional networks\
    \ (i.e., pure IPv4, pure IPv6, and ubiquitous Dual-\n   IP) are not considered.\
    \  In addition, the authors could not conceive\n   of any scenarios involving\
    \ IPv6-only ISPs or IPv6-only nodes in the\n   near term and consequently have\
    \ not addressed scenarios with IPv6-\n   only ISPs or IPv6-only nodes.  We assume\
    \ all nodes that host IPv6\n   applications are Dual-IP.  The matrix does not\
    \ assume or suggest that\n   network address translation is used.  The authors\
    \ recommend that\n   network address translation not be used in these notional\
    \ cases.\n   Future enterprise transitions that support IPv6-only nodes and IPv6-\n\
    \   only ISPs will require separate analysis, which is beyond the scope\n   of\
    \ this document.\n   Table 1 below is a matrix of ten possible Transition Implementations\n\
    \   that, being encountered in an enterprise, may require analysis and\n   the\
    \ selection of an IPv6 transition mechanism for that notional\n   network.  Each\
    \ possible implementation is represented by the rows of\n   the matrix.  The matrix\
    \ describes a set of notional networks as\n   follows:\n      - The first column\
    \ represents the protocol used by the application\n        and, below, the IP-capability\
    \ of the node originating the IP\n        packets.\n        (Application/Host\
    \ 1 OS)\n      - The second column represents the IP-capability of the host\n\
    \        network wherein the node originated the packet.\n        (Host 1 Network)\n\
    \      - The third column represents the IP-capability of the service\n      \
    \  provider network.\n        (Service Provider)\n      - The fourth column represents\
    \ the IP-capability of the\n        destination network wherein the originating\
    \ IP packets are\n        received.\n        (Host 2 Network)\n      - The fifth\
    \ column represents the protocol used by the application\n        and, below,\
    \ the IP-capability of the destination node receiving\n        the originating\
    \ IP packets.\n        (Application/Host 2 OS)\n   As an example, notional network\
    \ 1 is an IPv6 application residing on\n   a Dual-IP layer host trying to establish\
    \ a communications exchange\n   with a destination IPv6 application.  To complete\
    \ the information\n   exchange, the packets must first traverse the host's originating\
    \ IPv4\n   network (intranet), then the service provider's and destination\n \
    \  host's Dual-IP network.\n   Obviously, Table 1 does not describe every possible\
    \ scenario.\n   Trivial notional networks (such as pure IPv4, pure IPv6, and\n\
    \   ubiquitous Dual-IP) are not addressed.  However, the authors feel\n   these\
    \ ten scenarios represent the vast majority of transitional\n   situations likely\
    \ to be encountered in today's enterprise.\n   Therefore, we will use these ten\
    \ to address the analysis for\n   enterprise deployment.\n     Table 1 - Enterprise\

    \   The reader should note that Scenarios A-C in Table 1 are variations\n   of\
    \ compatible hosts communicating across largely (but not entirely)\n   homogenous\
    \ networks.  In each of the first three scenarios, the\n   packet must traverse\
    \ at least one incompatible network component.\n   For example, Scenario B represents\
    \ an enterprise that wishes to use\n   IPv6 applications, but has yet to transition\
    \ its internal networks;\n   its Service Provider also lags, offering only a v4\
    \ IP-service.\n   Conversely, Scenario C represents an enterprise that has completed\n\
    \   transition to IPv6 in its core networks (as has its Service\n   Provider),\
    \ but continues to require a legacy IPv4-based application.\n   Scenario D represents\
    \ the unusual situation where the enterprise has\n   transitioned its core intranetworks\
    \ to IPv6, but (like Scenario B)\n   it's ISP provider has yet to transition.\
    \  In addition, this\n   enterprise continues to retain critical legacy IPv4-based\n\
    \   applications that must communicate over this heterogeneous network\n   environment.\n\
    \   Scenarios E-J represent transitional situations wherein the\n   enterprise\
    \ has both IPv4 and IPv6 based instantiations of the same\n   application that\
    \ must continue to interoperate.  In addition, these\n   scenarios show that the\
    \ enterprise has not completed transition to\n   IPv6 in all its organic and/or\
    \ Service Provider networks.  Instead,\n   it maintains a variety of heterogeneous\
    \ network segments between the\n   communicating applications.  Scenarios E and\
    \ J represent distinctly\n   different extremes on either end of the spectrum.\
    \  In Scenario E, the\n   enterprise has largely transitioned to IPv6 in both\
    \ its applications\n   and networks.  However, Scenario E shows that a few legacy\
    \ IPv4-based\n   applications may still be found in the enterprise.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, Scenario J shows an enterprise that has begun its transition in\n  \
    \ a very disjointed manner and, in which IPv6-based applications and\n   network\
    \ segments are relatively rare.\n"

    \ and requirements are driven from\n   the [BSCN] text.  This analysis further\
    \ corresponds to Scenario A in\n   Section 3 above (although Scenario A shows\
    \ a transitional situation\n   wherein the enterprise has one network segment\
    \ still lagging on\n   transition to Dual-IP).\n   Within these IPv6 deployment\
    \ scenarios the enterprise network\n   administrator would introduce IPv6 by enabling\
    \ IPv6 on the wire\n   (i.e., within the network infrastructure) in a structured\
    \ fashion\n   with the existing IPv4 infrastructure.  In such scenarios, a number\n\
    \   of the existing IPv4 routers (and thus subnets) will be made Dual-IP,\n  \
    \ such that communications can run over either protocol.\n   Nodes on the Dual-IP\
    \ links may themselves be IPv4-only or IPv6-\n   capable.  The driver for deploying\
    \ IPv6 on the wire may not be for\n   immediate wide-scale usage of IPv6, but\
    \ rather to prepare an existing\n   IPv4 infrastructure to support IPv6-capable\
    \ nodes.  Thus, while IPv6\n   is not used, Dual-IP nodes exist, and the enterprise\
    \ can be\n   transitioned to IPv6 on demand.\n   Analyzing this scenario against\
    \ existing transition mechanisms for\n   their applicability suggests a staged\
    \ approach for IPv6 deployment in\n   the enterprise.\n"

    \ and requirements are\n   driven from the [BSCN] text.  Within this document,\
    \ this situation is\n   captured in Scenario C of Table 1.\n   Some enterprise\
    \ networks may wish to employ an IPv6-dominant network\n   deployment strategy.\
    \  What this means essentially is that the network\n   or specific sites within\
    \ the enterprise network will transition to\n   IPv6 using only IPv6 routing to\
    \ transfer both IPv4 and IPv6 packets\n   over the network, even though the network\
    \ may be Dual-IP capable.\n   IPv4 routing would not be turned on within an IPv6-dominant\
    \ network,\n   except if required to support edge IPv4 networks.\n   Under this\
    \ scenario, communications between IPv6 nodes will use IPv6.\n   When IPv6-capable\
    \ nodes in the IPv6-dominant network need to\n   communicate with IPv4 nodes,\
    \ the IPv6 nodes will use their Dual-IP\n   implementation to tunnel IPv4 packets\
    \ in IPv6 [V6TUN].  An edge\n   router within the IPv6-dominant network will decapsulate\
    \ the IPv4\n   packet and route to the path of the IPv4 node on the network. \
    \ This\n   permits Dual-IP layer nodes to communicate with legacy IPv4 nodes\n\
    \   within an IPv6-dominant network.\n   Scenarios E and F from Table 1 depict\
    \ additional cases where an\n   IPv6-dominant deployment strategy could be in\
    \ place.  In Scenario E,\n   the entire network could be IPv6-dominant, but the\
    \ Host OS 2 system\n   is running an IPv4 application.  In Scenario F, the Host\
    \ OS 1 system\n   network could be IPv6-dominant, but the rest of the networks\
    \ are all\n   IPv4.\n   In each case, communicating with an IPv4 end host or over\
    \ an IPv4\n   network requires that a transition point exist within the network\
    \ to\n   support that operation.  Furthermore, the node in the IPv6-dominant\n\
    \   network must acquire an IPv4 address (to interoperate with the IPv4\n   end\
    \ host), and locate a tunnel endpoint on their network which\n   permits the IPv4\
    \ packet to be tunneled to the next-hop IPv6 router\n   and eventually to a destination\
    \ Dual-IP router.\n   While retaining interoperability with IPv4 is a noble goal\
    \ for\n   enterprise architects, it is an unfortunate fact that maintaining\n\
    \   IPv4 services in an IPv6-dominant network slows and may even impede\n   your\
    \ ability to reap the maximum benefits of IPv6.\n   The decision whether or not\
    \ to use an IPv6-dominant network\n   deployment strategy is completely driven\
    \ by the enterprise's business\n   and operational objectives and guided by the\

    \ deployment, the site will need to decide whether it\n   wishes to deploy IPv6\
    \ links to be congruent with existing IPv4\n   subnets.  In this case, nodes will\
    \ fall into the same links or\n   subnets for both protocols.  Such a scheme could\
    \ be followed, with\n   IPv6 prefix allocations being made such that room for\
    \ topological\n   growth is provisioned (reducing the potential requirement for\
    \ future\n   renumbering due to restructuring).\n   A beneficial property of IPv6\
    \ is that an administrator will not need\n   to invest as much effort in address\
    \ conservation.  With IPv4, a site\n   will likely allocate IPv4 subnets to be\
    \ as small as possible for the\n   number of hosts currently in the subnet (e.g.,\
    \ a /26 for 50 nodes)\n   because IPv4 address conservation is required.  This\
    \ creates problems\n   when the number of nodes on a subnet grows, larger IPv4\
    \ prefixes are\n   then required, and potentially time-consuming and disruptive\n\
    \   renumbering events will follow.\n   With IPv6, a link can in effect have any\
    \ number of nodes, allowing\n   link growth without the need to adjust prefix\
    \ allocations with the\n   associated renumbering requirement.  The size of the\
    \ initial site\n   allocation (currently recommended to be a /48) also is likely\
    \ to\n   allow room for site growth without a need to return to the\n   connectivity\
    \ provider to obtain more, potentially non-sequential,\n   address space (as is\
    \ the case for IPv4 today, with the associated\n   paperwork and probable delays).\n\
    \   At the time of writing, best practice in IPv6 site address planning\n   is\
    \ restricted due to limited wide-scale deployments.  Administrators\n   should\
    \ allocate /64 size prefixes for subnets, and do so in a way\n   that has scope\
    \ for growth within a site.  The site should utilize a\n   plan that reserves\
    \ space for topological growth in the site, given\n   that its initial IPv6 prefix\

    \ out to the wider\n   enterprise.  This involves putting IPv6 on the wire in\
    \ the desired\n   links, and enabling applications and other services to begin\
    \ using an\n   IPv6 transport.\n   In the Dual-IP deployment case, this means\
    \ enabling IPv6 on existing\n   IPv4 subnets.  As described in Section 7.4.4,\
    \ above, it is likely\n   that IPv6 links will be congruent with IPv4 subnets\
    \ because IPv4\n   subnets tend to be created for geographic, policy, or administrative\n\
    \   reasons that would be IP version-independent.\n   While the use of IPv6 by\
    \ some applications can be administratively\n   controlled (e.g., in the case\
    \ of open source software by compiling\n   the application without IPv6 support\
    \ enabled), the use of IPv6\n   transport, and preference over IPv4 transport,\
    \ will vary per\n   application based on the developer/author's implementation.\n\
    \   A Dual-IP deployment will often be made by sites wishing to support\n   use\
    \ of IPv6 within a site, even if IPv6 transport is not preferred by\n   all applications.\
    \  Putting support for IPv6 in all site\n   infrastructure (DNS, email transport,\
    \ etc.) allows IPv6 usage to be\n   phased in over time.  As nodes become IPv6\
    \ capable, and applications\n   and services IPv6 enabled, the IPv6 capable infrastructure\
    \ can be\n   leveraged.  For most networks, Dual-IP will be at the very least\
    \ a\n   medium-term transition towards an IPv6-dominant future.  However, the\n\
    \   introduction of IPv6 support, with the potential benefits of globally\n  \
    \ aggregatable public address usage (with [NAP]) and other new IPv6\n   capabilities,\
    \ can bring more immediate benefits for the site.\n"

- title: 8.1.  Recognizing Incompatible Network Touchpoints
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Recognizing Incompatible Network Touchpoints\n   Mapping your specific\
    \ situation into one of the ten scenarios of\n   Table 1 is far less important\
    \ than recognizing the critical\n   touchpoints within the enterprise networks\
    \ where incompatible\n   networks interface.  Unless a transition mechanism is\
    \ being offered\n   by the enterprise as a service, it is at these touchpoints\
    \ that a\n   mechanism must be considered.\n   A quick review of Table 1 reveals\
    \ that the ten scenarios can be\n   boiled down to variations of four major themes.\
    \  The simplest, but\n   also most favored (due to its flexibility), is widespread\
    \ Dual-IP\n   with compatible hosts at either end.  This situation is illustrated\n\
    \   in Scenario A, and transition mechanism considerations have already\n   been\
    \ described in some detail in Section 4.\n   In the second common theme (depicted\
    \ in Scenarios B-D of Table 1),\n   the enterprise is comprised of compatible\
    \ hosts, with one or more\n   incompatible network touchpoints in between.  As\
    \ described in Section\n   4.2.2.1, tunneling can be used to \"bypass\" the incompatible\
    \ network\n   segments.  One tunneling option, manually configured tunnels [BCNF]\n\
    \   could be used by the enterprise, but as the name implies, this\n   mechanism\
    \ provides no automated tunnel configuration.\n   \"Connection of IPv6 Domains\
    \ via IPv4 Clouds\" [6TO4] can be used to\n   support enterprises that do not\
    \ have an assigned IPv6 prefix address.\n   Identifying the responsible device\
    \ to perform the tunneling is driven\n   by the position of the incompatible touchpoint.\
    \  If a local network\n   is incompatible, then host tunneling is appropriate.\
    \  If the backbone\n   (provider) network is incompatible, then gateway-to-gateway\
    \ tunneling\n   might be a better choice.  By working to ensure tunnel endpoints\
    \ are\n   always configured at Dual-IP devices, end-to-end communication or\n\
    \   services (IPv4 or IPv6) can be preserved.\n   Readers should review the current\
    \ work regarding tunnels within the\n   IETF Softwire working group and problem\
    \ statement [SOFTW].\n   Having IPv6 applications on a Dual-IP host on a v4-only\
    \ network\n   requires some form of tunneling.  Where configured tunnels are not\n\
    \   sufficient, a more automatic solution may be appropriate.  Available\n   solutions\
    \ include the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol\n   (ISATAP) [ISTP]\
    \ or Teredo [TRDO] to tunnel to a v6 end service.\n   ISATAP [ISTP] can be used\
    \ to provide end-node IPv6 connectivity from\n   nodes on an isolated IPv4 network,\
    \ through the use of automatic\n   tunneling of IPv6 in IPv4.  Teredo [TRDO] can\
    \ be used when the\n   enterprise network is behind a NAT.\n   Enterprise architects\
    \ should consider providing a Tunnel Broker\n   [TBRK] [TSPB] as a cost-effective\
    \ service to local users or\n   applications.  Tunnel Brokers can be used to provide\
    \ tunnel setup for\n   an enterprise using manually configured tunnels and 6TO4\
    \ [6TO4].\n   Tunnel Brokers can automate the use of tunnels across an enterprise\n\
    \   deploying IPv6.\n   Later in the transition process, after the enterprise\
    \ has\n   transitioned to a predominately IPv6 infrastructure, the architect\n\
    \   will need to determine a network transition strategy to tunnel IPv4\n   within\
    \ IPv6 [V6TUN] across IPv6-dominant links, or the enterprise\n   Intranet.  Or\
    \ in the case of early deployment of IPv6-dominant\n   networks, the architect\
    \ will need to address this from the beginning\n   of the required transition\
    \ planning.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Recognizing Application Incompatibilities
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Recognizing Application Incompatibilities\n   Having recognized incompatible\
    \ network touchpoints, it is also\n   incumbent on the architect to identify application\
    \ incompatibilities.\n   During the transition period, particularly for large\
    \ enterprises, it\n   is to be expected that an application hosted at one location\
    \ may lead\n   (or lag) the IPv6-compatibility of its peer (or server) at some\
    \ other\n   location.\n   This leads us to the third theme (represented by Scenarios\
    \ E and G):\n   incompatible applications communicating across a homogenous network.\n\
    \   Translation is an obvious solution, but not recommended except for\n   legacy\
    \ devices that are at the network edge and cannot or never will\n   be upgraded\
    \ to IPv6.  A more scalable solution would be to use an\n   Application Layer\
    \ Gateway (ALG) between the incompatible hosts.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.3.  Using Multiple Mechanisms to Support IPv6 Transition\n   Inevitably, during\
    \ the course of transitioning a large enterprise to\n   IPv6, the architect will\
    \ be faced with both incompatible hosts and\n   simultaneously (at different parts\
    \ of the enterprise) incompatible\n   networks.  These highly complex situations\
    \ represent the fourth\n   common theme in Table 1 (specifically depicted by Scenarios\
    \ F, H, I,\n   and J).  Maintaining IP interoperability in these situations requires\n\
    \   additional planning and may require multiple or even nested use of\n   diverse\
    \ transition mechanisms.  For example, an ALG collocated with\n   the application\
    \ server may be required to service both IPv4 and IPv6\n   data streams that are\
    \ simultaneously tunneled through incompatible\n   network segment(s).\n"

  - "A.1.  Introduction\n   This appendix first describes different scenarios for\
    \ the\n   introduction of IPv6 into a crisis management network for emergency\n\
    \   services, defense, or security forces that are currently running IPv4\n  \
    \ service.  Then, the scenarios for introducing IPv6 are analyzed, and\n   the\
    \ relevance of already defined transition mechanisms are evaluated.\n   Known\
    \ challenges are also identified.\n   When a crisis management enterprise deploys\
    \ IPv6, its goal is to\n   provide IPv6 connectivity on its institutional fixed\
    \ networks and on\n   the mobile wireless services that are deployed to a crisis\
    \ area.  The\n   new IPv6 service must be added to an already existing IPv4 service,\n\
    \   the introduction of IPv6 must not interrupt this IPv4 service, and\n   the\
    \ IPv6 services must be interoperable with existing IPv4 services.\n   Crisis\
    \ management enterprises accessing IPv4 service across mobile\n   ground networks,\
    \ airborne networks, and satellites will find\n   different ways to add IPv6 to\
    \ this service based on their network\n   architecture, funding, and institutional\
    \ goals.  This document\n   discusses a small set of scenarios representing the\

    \ during the\n   next decade.  This document evaluates the relevance of the existing\n\
    \   transition mechanisms in the context of these deployment scenarios,\n   and\
    \ points out the lack of essential functionality within these\n   methods for\
    \ a provider to support IPv6 services for these scenarios.\n   The document focuses\
    \ on services that include both IPv6 and IPv4 and\n   does cover issues surrounding\

  - "A.2.  Scenarios for IPv6 Deployment in Crisis Management Networks\n   Scenario\
    \ 1:  Limited IPv6 Deployment Network\n   Sparse IPv6 dual-stack deployment in\
    \ an existing IPv4 network\n   infrastructure.  Enterprise with an existing IPv4\
    \ network wants to\n   deploy a set of particular IPv6 \"applications\" and have\
    \ some ability\n   to interoperate with other institutions that are using IPv6\
    \ services.\n   The IPv6 deployment is limited to the minimum required to operate\n\
    \   this set of applications.\n   Assumptions:  IPv6 software/hardware components\
    \ for the application\n   are available, and platforms for the application are\
    \ IPv6 capable.\n   Requirements: Do not disrupt IPv4 infrastructure.\n   Scenario\
    \ 2:    Dual-Stack Network\n   Wide-scale/total dual-stack deployment of IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 capable hosts\n   and network infrastructure.  Enterprise with an existing\
    \ IPv4 network\n   wants to deploy IPv6 in conjunction with their IPv4 network\
    \ in order\n   to take advantage of emerging IPv6 network-centric capabilities\
    \ and\n   to be interoperable with other agencies, international partners, and\n\
    \   commercial enterprises that are deploying an IPv6 architecture.\n   Assumptions:\
    \  The IPv4 network infrastructure used has an equivalent\n   capability in IPv6.\n\
    \   Requirements: Do not disrupt existing IPv4 network infrastructure\n   with\
    \ IPv6.  IPv6 should be equivalent or \"better\" than the network\n   infrastructure\
    \ in IPv4.  It may not be feasible to deploy IPv6 on all\n   parts of the network\
    \ immediately.  Dual-stacked defense enterprise\n   network must be interoperable\
    \ with both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and\n   applications.\n   Scenario 3: IPv6-Dominant\
    \ Network\n   Enterprise has some limited IPv4-capable/only nodes/applications\n\
    \   needing to communicate over the IPv6 infrastructure.  Crisis\n   management\
    \ enterprise re-structuring an existing network, decides to\n   pursue aggressive\
    \ IPv6 transition as an enabler for network-centric\n   services and wants to\
    \ run some native IPv6-only networks to eliminate\n   cost/complexity of supporting\
    \ a dual stack.  Some legacy IPv4 capable\n   nodes/applications within the enterprise\
    \ will have slow technical\n   refresh/replacement paths and will need to communicate\
    \ over the IPv6\n   dominant infrastructure for years until they are replaced.\
    \  The\n   IPv6-dominant enterprise network will need to be interoperable with\n\
    \   its own legacy networks, commercial networks, and the legacy networks\n  \
    \ of similar organizations that will remain IPv4-dominant during a long\n   transition\
    \ period.  Reserve units, contractors, other agencies, and\n   international partners\
    \ may need IPv4 service across this enterprise's\n   IPv6-dominant backbone.\n\
    \   Assumptions: Required IPv6 network infrastructure is available, or\n   available\
    \ over some defined timeline, supporting the aggressive\n   transition plan.\n\
    \   Requirements: Reduce operation and maintenance requirements and\n   increase\
    \ net-centricity through aggressive IPv6 transition.\n   Interoperation and coexistence\
    \ with legacy IPv4 networks and\n   applications is required.  Legacy IPv4 nodes/applications/networks\n\
    \   will need to be able to operate across the IPv6 backbone and need to\n   be\

  - "A.4.  Stages of IPv6 Deployment\n   The stages are derived from the generic description\
    \ of scenarios for\n   crisis management networks in Section 2.  Combinations\
    \ of different\n   building blocks that constitute a crisis network environment\
    \ lead to\n   a number of scenarios from which the network engineers can choose.\n\
    \   The scenarios most relevant to this document are those that maximize\n   the\
    \ network's ability to offer IPv6 to its customers in the most\n   efficient and\
    \ feasible way.  In the first three stages, the goal is\n   to offer both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 to the customer, and it is assumed that\n   in the distant future,\
    \ all IPv4 services will be eventually switched\n   to IPv6.  This document will\
    \ cover engineering the first four stages.\n   The four most probable stages are:\n\
    \         o Stage 1      Limited Launch\n         o Stage 2      Dual-Stack Dominance\n\
    \         o Stage 3      IPv6 Dominance\n         o Stage 4      IPv6 Transition\
    \ Complete\n   Generally, a crisis management network is able to entirely upgrade\
    \ a\n   current IPv4 network to provide IPv6 services via a dual-stack\n   network\
    \ in Stage 2 and then slowly progress to Stages 3 and 4 as\n   indicated in Figure\
    \ 2.  During Stage 2, when most applications are\n   IPv6 dominant, operational\
    \ and maintenance costs can be reduced on\n   some networks by moving to Stage\
    \ 3 and running backbone networks\n   entirely on IPv6, while adding IPv4 backwards\
    \ compatibility via v4 in\n   v6 tunneling or translation mechanisms to the existing\
    \ configuration\n   from Stage 2.  When designing a new network, if a new IPv6-only\n\
    \   service is required, it can be implemented at a lower cost by jumping\n  \
    \ directly to Stage 3/4 if there are only limited or no legacy\n   concerns.\n\
    \   Stage 1: Limited Launch\n   The first stage begins with an IPv4-only network\
    \ and IPv4 customers.\n   This is the most common case today and the natural starting\
    \ point for\n   the introduction of IPv6.  During this stage, the enterprise begins\n\
    \   to connect individual IPv6 applications run on dual-stacked hosts\n   through\
    \ host-based tunneling using Tunnel Broker, ISATAP, or Teredo.\n   Some early\
    \ adopter networks are created for pilot studies and\n   networked together through\
    \ configured tunnels and 6to4.\n   The immediate first step consists of obtaining\
    \ a prefix allocation\n   (typically a /32) from the appropriate RIR (e.g., AfriNIC,\
    \ APNIC,\n   ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE) according to allocation procedures.\n   The crisis\
    \ management enterprise will also need to establish IPv6\n   connectivity between\
    \ its home base networks and mobile wireless\n   networks over its backbone. \
    \ It will need to negotiate IPv6 service\n   with its service providers and with\
    \ peer organizations; it is of\n   utmost importance to require IPv6 capability\
    \ or an upgrade plan when\n   negotiating purchases of network applications and\
    \ infrastructure.  In\n   the short term, network connections, especially legacy\
    \ wireless\n   networks that cannot provide IPv6 services, can provide IPv6 services\n\
    \   through the use of tunnels.  However, the longer-term goal must be\n   requiring\
    \ and obtaining IPv6 native connectivity from the transit\n   networks.  Otherwise,\
    \ the quality of IPv6 connectivity will likely be\n   poor and the transition\
    \ to Stage 2 will be delayed.\n   Stage 2: Dual-Stack Dominance\n   Stage 2 occurs\
    \ when most applications, local networks, and network\n   backbones become dual-stacked\
    \ so that native IPv6 connections are\n   enabled.  At this point there is a mix\
    \ of IPv4 and IPv6 applications\n   and services in use across the enterprise.\
    \  The enterprise may be\n   made IPv6-capable through either software upgrades,\
    \ hardware\n   upgrades, or a combination of both.  Generally IPv6 is added during\n\
    \   normal technical refresh as the enterprise buys new equipment that is\n  \
    \ IPv6 ready.\n   Specialty legacy applications and wireless/satellite networks\
    \ may be\n   especially slow to transition to IPv6 capability due to upgrade\n\
    \   costs, so plans must be made for backwards compatibility for these\n   systems.\
    \  Since some new IPv6 services cannot be provided through\n   IPv4, and some\
    \ legacy network connections may not yet be upgraded,\n   tunneling mechanisms\
    \ have to be provided on the backbone to provide\n   IPv6 connectivity through\
    \ to customer IPv6 applications still relying\n   on legacy IPv4-only networks.\
    \  The tunnels may provide host-based\n   tunneling for individual customers or\
    \ site-to-site tunnels to connect\n   small IPv6 domains through IPv4-only networks.\
    \  If any new\n   applications are IPv6-only rather than dual-stacked, and need\
    \ to\n   interact with IPv4-only legacy applications, translators will be used\n\
    \   as a transition mechanism of last resort during this stage.\n   Stage 3: IPv6\
    \ Dominance\n   Applications are deployed specifically to use IPv6 as benefit;\
    \ thus,\n   network backbone and nodes use IPv6 and not IPv4, except where IPv4\n\
    \   is legacy.\n"
