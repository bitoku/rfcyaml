  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131]\
    \ provides a\n   mechanism for host configuration.  [RFC2132] and [RFC2937] allow\
    \ DHCP\n   servers to pass name service configuration information to DHCP\n  \
    \ clients.  In some circumstances, it is useful for the DHCP client to\n   be\
    \ configured with the domain search list.  This document defines a\n   new DHCP\
    \ option which is passed from the DHCP Server to the DHCP\n   Client to specify\
    \ the domain search list used when resolving\n   hostnames with DNS.  This option\
    \ applies only to DNS and does not\n   apply to other name resolution mechanisms.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   DHCP client\n\
    \         A DHCP client or \"client\" is an Internet host using DHCP to\n    \
    \     obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.\n   DHCP server\n\
    \         A DHCP server or \"server\" is an Internet host that returns\n     \
    \    configuration parameters to DHCP clients.\n"

- title: 2.  Domain Search Option Format
  contents:
  - "2.  Domain Search Option Format\n   The code for this option is 119.\n    0 \
    \                  1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5\
    \ 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |     119       |     Len       |         Searchstring...\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |                     Searchstring...\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   In the above diagram, Searchstring is a string specifying the\n   searchlist.\
    \  If the length of the searchlist exceeds the maximum\n   permissible within\
    \ a single option (255 octets), then multiple\n   options MAY be used, as described\
    \ in \"Encoding Long Options in the\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4)\"\
    \ [RFC3396].\n   To enable the searchlist to be encoded compactly, searchstrings\
    \ in\n   the searchlist MUST be concatenated and encoded using the technique\n\
    \   described in section 4.1.4 of \"Domain Names - Implementation And\n   Specification\"\
    \ [RFC1035].  In this scheme, an entire domain name or a\n   list of labels at\
    \ the end of a domain name is replaced with a pointer\n   to a prior occurrence\
    \ of the same name.  Despite its complexity, this\n   technique is valuable since\
    \ the space available for encoding DHCP\n   options is limited, and it is likely\
    \ that a domain searchstring will\n   contain repeated instances of the same domain\
    \ name.  Thus the DNS\n   name compression is both useful and likely to be effective.\n\
    \   For use in this specification, the pointer refers to the offset\n   within\
    \ the data portion of the DHCP option (not including the\n   preceding DHCP option\
    \ code byte or DHCP option length byte).\n   If multiple Domain Search Options\
    \ are present, then the data portions\n   of all the Domain Search Options are\
    \ concatenated together as\n   specified in \"Encoding Long DHCP Options in the\
    \ Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4)\" [RFC3396] and the pointer\
    \ indicates\n   an offset within the complete aggregate block of data.\n"
- title: 3.  Example
  contents:
  - "3.  Example\n   Below is an example encoding of a search list consisting of\n\
    \   \"eng.apple.com.\" and \"marketing.apple.com.\":\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\
    \   |119| 9 | 3 |'e'|'n'|'g'| 5 |'a'|'p'|'p'|'l'|\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\
    \   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n   |119| 9 |'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'|\
    \ 0 | 9 |'m'|'a'|\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\
    \   |119| 9 |'r'|'k'|'e'|'t'|'i'|'n'|'g'|xC0|x04|\n   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\
    \   Note:\n   i.    The encoding has been split (for this example) into three\n\
    \         Domain Search Options.  All Domain Search Options are logically\n  \
    \       concatenated into one block of data before being interpreted by\n    \
    \     the client.\n   ii.   The encoding of \"eng.apple.com.\" ends with a zero,\
    \ the null\n         root label, to mark the end of the name, as required by RFC\n\
    \         1035.\n   iii.  The encoding of \"marketing\" (for \"marketing.apple.com.\"\
    ) ends\n         with the two-octet compression pointer C004 (hex), which points\n\
    \         to offset 4 in the complete aggregated block of Domain Search\n    \
    \     Option data, where another validly encoded domain name can be\n        \
    \ found to complete the name (\"apple.com.\").\n   Every search domain name must\
    \ end either with a zero or with a two-\n   octet compression pointer.  If the\
    \ receiver is part-way through\n   decoding a search domain name when it reaches\
    \ the end of the complete\n   aggregated block of the searchlist option data,\
    \ without finding a\n   zero or a valid two-octet compression pointer, then the\
    \ partially\n   read name MUST be discarded as invalid.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Potential attacks on DHCP are discussed in section\
    \ 7 of the DHCP\n   protocol specification [RFC2131], as well as in the DHCP\n\
    \   authentication specification [RFC3118].  In particular, using the\n   domain\
    \ search option, a rogue DHCP server might be able to redirect\n   traffic to\
    \ another site.\n   For example, a user requesting a connection to \"myhost\"\
    , expecting to\n   reach \"myhost.bigco.com\" might instead be directed to\n \
    \  \"myhost.roguedomain.com\".  Note that support for DNSSEC [RFC2535]\n   will\
    \ not avert this attack, since the resource records for\n   \"myhost.roguedomain.com\"\
    \ might be legitimately signed.  This makes\n   the domain search option a more\
    \ fruitful avenue of attack for a rogue\n   DHCP server than providing an illegitimate\
    \ DNS server option\n   (described in [RFC2132]).\n   The degree to which a host\
    \ is vulnerable to attack via an invalid\n   domain search option is determined\
    \ in part by DNS resolver behavior.\n   [RFC1535] discusses security weaknesses\
    \ related to implicit as well\n   as explicit domain searchlists, and provides\
    \ recommendations relating\n   to resolver searchlist processing.  [RFC1536] section\
    \ 6 also\n   addresses this vulnerability, and recommends that resolvers:\n  \
    \ [1]   Use searchlists only when explicitly specified; no implicit\n        \
    \ searchlists should be used.\n   [2]   Resolve a name that contains any dots\
    \ by first trying it as an\n         FQDN and if that fails, with the local domain\
    \ name (or\n         searchlist if specified) appended.\n   [3]   Resolve a name\
    \ containing no dots by appending with the\n         searchlist right away, but\
    \ once again, no implicit searchlists\n         should be used.\n   In order to\
    \ minimize potential vulnerabilities it is recommended\n   that:\n   [a]   Hosts\
    \ implementing the domain search option SHOULD also\n         implement the searchlist\
    \ recommendations of [RFC1536], section\n         6.\n   [b]   Where DNS parameters\
    \ such as the domain searchlist or DNS\n         servers have been manually configured,\
    \ these parameters SHOULD\n         NOT be overridden by DHCP.\n   [c]   Domain\
    \ search option implementations MAY require DHCP\n         authentication [RFC3118]\
    \ prior to accepting a domain search\n         option.\n"
