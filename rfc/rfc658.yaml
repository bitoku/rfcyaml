    \ as described in \n   the NAOL and NAOP Telnet Options.\n      IAC DO NAOLFD\
    \ \n         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about output\n  \
    \       linefeed disposition with the data receiver.  In the case where\n    \
    \     agreement has been reached and in the absence of further\n         subnegotiations,\
    \ the data receiver is assumed to be handling output\n         linefeed considerations.\n\
    \      IAC DON'T NAOLFD \n         The data sender refuses to negotiate about\

    \   The data receiver requests or agrees to negotiate about output\n         linefeed\

  - "3. Default\n   DON'T NAOLFD/WON'T NAOLFD.\n      In the default absence of negotiations\
    \ concerning which party, data\n      under or data receiver, is handling output\
    \ linefeed considerations,\n      neither party is required nor prohibited from\
    \ handling linefeeds; but\n      it is appropriate if at least the data receiver\
    \ handles them, albeit\n      primitively.\n   and DR SB commands as follows:\n\
    \      8-bit value         Meaning\n      0            Command sender suggests\
    \ that he alone will handle  \n                   linefeeds, for the connection.\
    \                     \n      1 to 250     Command sender suggests that the other\
    \ party alone \n                   should handle linefeeds, but suggests that\
    \ a delay \n                   of the indicated value be used.  The value is the\
    \   \n                   number of character-times to wait or number of     \n\
    \                   NULs to insert in the data stream before sending   \n    \
    \               the next data character.  (See qualifications, below.)\n     \
    \ 251          Not allowed, in order to be compatible with        \n         \
    \          related Telnet options.                            \n      252    \
    \      Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n                 \
    \  handle linefeeds, but suggests that they be discarded.\n      253         \
    \ Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n                   should\
    \ handle linefeeds, but suggests that\n                   linefeeds be simulated.\
    \                            \n      254          Command sender suggests that\
    \ the other party alone \n                   should handle output linefeeds but\
    \ suggests        \n                   waiting for a character to be transmitted\
    \ (on the  \n                   other simplex connection) before sending more\
    \      \n                   data.  (See qualifications, below.) Note that, due\
    \  \n                   to the assynchrony of the two simplex connections, \n\
    \                   phase problems can occur with this option.         \n    \
    \  255          Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n        \
    \           should handle output linefeeds and suggests        \n            \
    \       nothing about how it should be done.               \n   The guiding rules\
    \ are that: \n      1) if neither data receiver nor data sender wants to handle\
    \ output \n      linefeeds, the data receiver must do it, and\n      2) if both\
    \ data receiver and data sender want to handle output linefeed \n      disposition,\
    \ the data sender gets to do it. \n   The reasoning for the former rule is that\
    \ if neither wants to do it, then\n   the default in the NAOLFD option dominates.\
    \  If both want to do it, the\n   sender, who is presumed to have special knowledge\
    \ about the data, should\n   be allowed to do it, taking into account any suggestions\
    \ the receiver may\n   make.  Simulation is defined as the replacement of the\
    \ linefeed character\n   by new-line (see following) and enough blanks to move\
    \ the print head (or\n   line pointer) to the same lateral position it occupied\
    \ just prior to\n   receiving the linefeed.  To avoid infinite recursion, such\
    \ simulation is\n   allowed only for linefeed characters that are not immediately\
    \ preceded by\n   carriage-returns (that is, part of a Telnet new-line combination).\
    \  It is\n   assumed that linefeed simulation will be necessary for printers that\
    \ do\n   not have a separate linefeed (like the IBM 2741); in this case,\n   due\
    \ to the assynchrony of network transmissions.  Additionally, due to\n   the presence\
    \ of the Telnet end-of-line convention, it may be necessary to\n   add carriage-return\
    \ padding or delay after the associated linefeed (see\n   NAOCRD Telnet option).\
    \  As with all option negotiations, neither party\n   should suggest a state already\
    \ in effect except to refuse to negotiate;\n   changes should be acknowledged;\
    \ and once refused, an option should not be\n"
