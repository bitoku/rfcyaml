  - "Abstract\n   RFC 4379 defines the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping/Traceroute\n
    \  mechanism in which the Router Alert Option (RAO) MUST be set in the\n   IP
    header of the MPLS Echo Request messages and may conditionally be\n   set in the
    IP header of the MPLS Echo Reply messages depending on the\n   Reply Mode used.
    \ While a generic \"Router shall examine packet\"\n   Option Value is used for
    the IPv4 RAO, there is no generic RAO value\n   defined for IPv6 that can be used.
    \ This document allocates a new,\n   generic IPv6 RAO value that can be used by
    MPLS Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tools, including the
    MPLS Echo\n   Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS in IPv6 environments.\n
    \  Consequently, it updates RFC 4379.\n   The initial motivation to request an
    IPv6 RAO value for MPLS OAM\n   comes from the MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute.  However,
    this value is\n   applicable to all MPLS OAM and not limited to MPLS LSP Ping/\n
    \  Traceroute.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A commonly deployed MPLS OAM tool is specified in [RFC4379],\n
    \  \"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures\",\n   which
    is used to diagnose MPLS network data planes.  This\n   specification, often referred
    to as \"MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute\"\n   [RFC4379], requires the use of the Router
    Alert Option (RAO) in the\n   IP header.  For example, Section 4.3 of [RFC4379]
    states that the IP\n   RAO MUST be set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo Request
    message.\n   Similarly, Section 4.5 of [RFC4379] states that the IP RAO MUST be\n
    \  set in the IP header of an MPLS Echo Reply message if the Reply Mode\n   in
    the Echo Request is set to \"Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with\n   Router
    Alert\".\n   [RFC2113] defines a generic Option Value 0x0 for IPv4 RAO that is\n
    \  used in LSP Ping and LSP Traceroute for MPLS in IPv4 environments.\n   This
    IPv4 RAO value of 0x0 is assigned to \"Router shall examine\n   packet\".  However,
    currently there is no generic IPV6 RAO value\n   defined that can be used in LSP
    Ping and LSP Traceroute for MPLS in\n   IPv6 environments.  Specifically, [RFC2711]
    defined the Router Alert\n   for a general IPv6 purpose but required the Value
    field in the RAO to\n   indicate a specific reason for using the RAO.  Because
    there is no\n   defined value for MPLS LSP Ping/Traceroute use or for general
    use, it\n   is not possible for MPLS OAM tools to use the IPv6 Router Alert\n
    \  mechanism.\n   As vendors are starting to implement MPLS on the IPv6 control
    plane\n   (e.g., [LDP-IPV6]), there is a need to define and allocate such an\n
    \  Option Value for IPv6 in order to comply with [RFC4379].  This\n   document
    defines a new IPv6 RAO value that can be used by MPLS OAM\n   tools, including
    the MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages\n   for MPLS in IPv6 environments.\n
    \  This document closes the gap discussed in the third paragraph of\n   Section
    3.4.2 in [RFC7439].\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  IPv6 RAO Value for MPLS OAM\n   This document defines a new Option Value
    (69) for the IPv6 RAO to\n   alert transit routers to examine the packet more
    closely for MPLS OAM\n   purposes.  This Option Value is used by any MPLS OAM
    application that\n   requires their packets to be examined by a transit router.\n
    \  In the scope of this document, this Option Value will be used by the\n   MPLS
    Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply for its IPv6 messages, as is\n   required by
    [RFC4379].\n"

  - "4.  Updates to RFC 4379\n   [RFC4379] specifies the use of the RAO in the IP
    header.  Sections\n   4.3 and 4.5 of [RFC4379] are updated as follows:\n   For
    every time in which the \"Router Alert IP Option\" is used, the\n   following
    text is appended:\n      In case of an IPv4 header, the generic IPv4 RAO value
    0x0\n      [RFC2113] SHOULD be used.  In case of an IPv6 header, the IPv6 RAO\n
    \     value (69) allocated through this document for MPLS OAM MUST be\n      used.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new value (69) for the IPv6
    RAO to alert\n   transit routers to examine the packet more closely for MPLS OAM\n
    \  purposes.  IANA has assigned a new code point under its \"IPv6 Router\n   Alert
    Option Values\" registry defined by [RFC2711], updated by\n   [RFC5350], and maintained
    in [IANA-IPv6-RAO].  The new code point is\n   as follows:\n      Value   Description
    \                      Reference\n      -----   -------------------------------
    \  ---------------\n         69   MPLS OAM                          RFC 7506\n"
  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces no new security concerns
    in addition to what\n   have already been captured in [RFC4379] and [RFC6398],
    the latter of\n   which expands the security considerations of [RFC2113] and [RFC2711].\n
    \  IPv6 packets containing the MPLS OAM RAO are encapsulated with an\n   MPLS
    header and are not expected to be inspected by every label\n   switched hop within
    an MPLS LSP.  Consequently, this value of the RAO\n   will be processed by the
    appropriate router and is not subject to the\n   problem of being ignored, as
    described in Section 2.2 of [RFC7045].\n"
