    \ Working Group will be held in Atlantic\nCity, New Jersey coincident with the\
    \ SJCC. The Wicker Room of the Dennis\nHotel has been reserved from Sunday, May\
    \ 16 at 8:00 pm. through\nThursday, May 20 at 6:00 pm.\nSince it is not possible\

    \ should contact my\nsecretary Mrs. Marybelle Goodson, 703-893-3500 Ext. 2316.\n\
