- title: 1.  Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management\n\
    \   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in\n   TCP/IP-based\
    \ internets.  In particular, this memo defines managed\n   objects used for managing\
    \ subnetworks which use the IEEE 802.5 Token\n   Ring technology described in\
    \ 802.5 Token Ring Access Method and\n   Physical Layer Specifications, IEEE Standard\
    \ 802.5-1989.\n"
- title: 2.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 which\
    \ defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n      the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an\n      evolution of MIB-I based\
    \ on implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n    \
    \  RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access\
    \ to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for\
    \ the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.  Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 5 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [9,10].\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   This memo defines three tables: the 802.5 Interface Table, which\n\
    \   contains state and parameter information which is specific to 802.5\n   interfaces,\
    \ the 802.5 Statistics Table, which contains 802.5\n   interface statistics, and\
    \ the 802.5 Timer Table, which contains the\n   values of 802.5-defined timers.\
    \ A managed system will have one entry\n   in the 802.5 Interface Table and one\
    \ entry in the 802.5 Statistics\n   Table for each of its 802.5 interfaces.  Implementation\
    \ of the 802.5\n   Timer Table is optional.\n   This memo also defines OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIERs, some to identify 802.5\n   tests, for use with the ifExtnsTestTable\
    \ defined in [11], and some to\n   identify Token Ring interface Chip Sets, for\
    \ use with the\n   ifExtnsChipSet object defined in [11].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Scope of Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Scope of Definitions\n   All objects defined in this memo are registered\
    \ in a single subtree\n   within the experimental namespace [3], and are for use\
    \ with every\n   interface which conforms to the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring Access\
    \ Method\n   and Physical Layer Specifications [10].  At present, this applies\
    \ to\n   interfaces for which the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB\n\
    \   [4,6] has the value:\n              iso88025-tokenRing(9)\n   For these interfaces,\
    \ the value of the ifSpecific variable in the\n   MIB-II [6] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ value:\n               dot5    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { experimental 4 }\n  \
    \ as defined below.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Textual Conventions\n   A new datatype, MacAddress, is introduced as a\
    \ textual convention in\n   this document.  This textual convention has NO effect\
    \ on either the\n   syntax nor the semantics of any managed object. Objects defined\
    \ using\n   this convention are always encoded by means of the rules that define\n\
    \   their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are\n   necessary\
    \ to accommodate this textual convention which is adopted\n   merely for the convenience\
    \ of readers.\n"
