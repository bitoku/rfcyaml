- title: 2.1.1.  Direct Delegation
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Direct Delegation\n   The AS112 project currently uses an approach whereby\
    \ zones whose\n   traffic should be directed towards an AS112 sink should be directly\n\
    \   delegated to AS112 nameservers.  Correspondingly, each AS112 node is\n   manually\
    \ configured to answer appropriately for those zones.\n   The guidance in this\
    \ document describes this capability for the zones\n   that were originally delegated\
    \ in this fashion.  AS112 nodes that\n   were implemented in accordance with the\
    \ guidance found here will\n   continue to provide service for those zones.\n"

  - "3.1.  Useful Background Knowledge\n   Installation of an AS112 node is relatively\
    \ straightforward.\n   However, experience in the following general areas may\
    \ prove useful:\n   o  inter-domain routing with BGP [RFC4271];\n   o  DNS authoritative\
    \ server operations; and\n   o  anycast [RFC4786] distribution of DNS services.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Topological Location
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Topological Location\n   AS112 nodes may be located anywhere on the Internet.\
    \  For nodes that\n   are intended to provide a public service to the Internet\
    \ community\n   (as opposed to private use), it may well be advantageous to choose\
    \ a\n   location that is easily (and cheaply) reachable by multiple\n   providers,\
    \ such as an Internet Exchange Point.\n   AS112 nodes may advertise their service\
    \ prefix to BGP peers for local\n   use (analogous to a conventional peering relationship\
    \ between two\n   providers) or for global use (analogous to a customer relationship\n\
    \   with one or more providers).\n   It is good operational practice to notify\
    \ the community of users that\n   may fall within the reach of a new AS112 node\
    \ before it is installed.\n   At an Internet Exchange, local mailing lists usually\
    \ exist to\n   facilitate such announcements.  For nodes that are intended to\
    \ be\n   globally reachable, coordination with other AS112 operators is highly\n\
    \   recommended.  See also Section 5.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operating System and Host Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operating System and Host Considerations\n   Examples in this document\
    \ are based on UNIX and UNIX-like operating\n   systems, but other operating systems\
    \ exist that are suitable for use\n   in construction of an AS112 node.\n   The\
    \ chosen platform should include either support for cloned loopback\n   interfaces\
    \ or the capability to bind multiple addresses to a single\n   loopback interface.\
    \  The addresses of the nameservers listed in\n   Section 2.3 will be configured\
    \ on these interfaces in order that the\n   DNS software can respond to queries\
    \ properly.\n   A host that is configured to act as an AS112 anycast node should\
    \ be\n   dedicated to that purpose and should not be used to simultaneously\n\
    \   provide other services.  This guidance is provided due to the\n   unpredictable\
    \ (and occasionally high) traffic levels that AS112 nodes\n   have been seen to\
    \ attract.\n   System startup scripts should be arranged such that the various\n\
    \   AS112-related components start automatically following a system\n   reboot.\
    \  The order in which interfaces are configured and software\n   components started\
    \ should be arranged such that routing software\n   startup follows DNS software\
    \ startup, and DNS software startup\n   follows loopback interface configuration.\n\
    \   Wrapper scripts or other arrangements should be employed to ensure\n   that\
    \ the anycast service prefix for AS112 is not advertised while\n   either the\
    \ anycast addresses are not configured or the DNS software\n   is not running.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Routing Software
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Routing Software\n   AS112 nodes signal the availability of AS112 nameservers\
    \ to the\n   Internet using BGP [RFC4271]: each AS112 node is a BGP speaker and\n\
    \   announces the prefixes 192.175.48.0/24 and 2620:4f:8000::/48 to the\n   Internet\
    \ with origin AS 112 (see also Section 2.3).\n   The examples in this document\
    \ are based on the Quagga Routing Suite\n   <http://www.quagga.net> running on\
    \ Linux, but other software packages\n   exist that also provide suitable BGP\
    \ support for AS112 nodes.\n   The \"bgpd.conf\" file is used by Quagga's bgpd\
    \ daemon, which provides\n   BGP support.  The router ID in this example is 203.0.113.1;\
    \ the AS112\n   node peers with external peers 192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2, 2001:db8::1,\
    \ and\n   2001:db8::2.  Note that the local AS number is 112, and the service\n\
    \   prefixes originated from the AS112 node to support Direct Delegation\n   service\
    \ are 192.175.48.0/24 and 2620:4f:8000::/48; the IPv4 prefix\n   192.31.196.0/24\
    \ and the IPv6 prefix 2001:4:112::/48 support DNAME\n   redirection.\n   For clarity,\
    \ an IPv4-only AS112 node need not configure any of the\n   IPv6 elements that\
    \ follow; similarly, an IPv6-only AS112 node need\n   not configure any of the\
    \ IPv4 elements.  Such single-stack hosts can\n   still contribute usefully to\

  - "3.5.  DNS Software\n   Although the queries received by AS112 nodes are definitively\n\
    \   misdirected, it is important that they be answered in a manner that\n   is\
    \ accurate and consistent.  For this reason, AS112 nodes operate as\n   fully\
    \ functional and standards-compliant DNS authoritative servers\n   [RFC1034],\
    \ and hence require appropriate DNS software.\n   Examples in this document are\
    \ based on ISC BIND9\n   <http://www.isc.org/software/BIND/>, but other DNS software\
    \ exists\n   that is suitable for use in construction of an AS112 node.\n   The\
    \ following is a sample BIND9 \"named.conf\" file for a dedicated\n   AS112 server.\
    \  Note that the nameserver is configured to act as an\n   authoritative-only\
    \ server (i.e., recursion is disabled).  The\n   nameserver is also configured\
    \ to listen on the various AS112 anycast\n   nameserver addresses, as well as\
    \ its local addresses.\n   A basic logging example is included in the sample as\
    \ well.  AS112\n   operators may exercise discretion at the amount of logging\
    \ detail\n   they desire or the type of logging they may use in the maintenance\
    \ of\n   their node.  The detail of information can then be used to single out\n\
    \   bad implementors or badly managed nameservers, or it can be used for\n   simple\

  contents:
  - "6.  On the Future of AS112 Nodes\n   It is recommended practice for the operators\
    \ of recursive nameservers\n   to answer queries for zones served by AS112 nodes\
    \ locally, such that\n   queries never have an opportunity to reach AS112 servers\
    \ [RFC6303].\n   Operational experience with AS112 nodes does not currently indicate\n\
    \   an observable trend towards compliance with those recommendations,\n   however.\n\
    \   It is expected that some DNS software vendors will include default\n   configuration\
    \ that will implement measures such as those described in\n   [RFC6303].  If such\
    \ software is widely deployed, it is reasonable to\n   assume that the query load\
    \ received by AS112 nodes will decrease;\n   however, it is safe to assume that\
    \ the query load will not decrease\n   to zero, and consequently that AS112 nodes\
    \ will continue to provide a\n   useful service for the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   The use of DNAME redirection to provide AS112 service is new and\n   hence\
    \ is informed by minimal operational experience.  The use of\n   DNAME means that\
    \ queries for many source zones could be redirected to\n   AS112 infrastructure\
    \ with no real opportunity for coordination.\n   If the DNAME redirection approach\
    \ is successful, and in the absence\n   of any operational concerns, the community\
    \ might well recommend the\n   retirement of the original Direct Delegation AS112\
    \ service.  This\n   document makes no such recommendation, however.\n"

    \ and this could present a security risk.  Additionally, AS112\n   operators may\
    \ log this information, making it further subject to\n   whatever security and\
    \ privacy risks that might entail.  These risks\n   are orthogonal to the presence\
    \ or absence of authoritative servers\n   for these zones in the public DNS infrastructure,\
    \ however.\n   Queries that are answered by AS112 servers are usually unintentional;\n\
    \   it follows that the responses from AS112 servers are usually\n   unexpected.\
    \  Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger intrusion\n   detection systems or alerts\
    \ by firewalls.  Operators of AS112 servers\n   should be prepared to be contacted\
    \ by operators of remote\n   infrastructure who believe their security has been\
    \ violated.  Advice\n   to those who mistakenly believe that responses from AS112\
    \ nodes\n   constitute an attack on their infrastructure can be found in\n   [RFC6305].\n\
    \   The deployment of AS112 nodes is very loosely coordinated compared to\n  \
    \ other services distributed using anycast.  The malicious compromise\n   of an\
    \ AS112 node and subversion of the data served by the node are\n   hence more\
    \ difficult to detect due to the lack of central management.\n   Since it is conceivable\
    \ that changing the responses to queries\n   received by AS112 nodes might influence\
    \ the behaviour of the hosts\n   sending the queries, such a compromise might\
    \ be used as an attack\n   vector against private infrastructure.\n   Operators\
    \ of AS112 should take appropriate measures to ensure that\n   AS112 nodes are\
    \ appropriately protected from compromise, such as\n   would normally be employed\
    \ for production nameserver or network\n   infrastructure.  The guidance provided\
    \ for root nameservers in\n   [RFC2870] may be instructive.\n   The zones hosted\
    \ by AS112 servers are not signed with DNSSEC\n   [RFC4033].  Given the distributed\
    \ and loosely coordinated structure\n   of the AS112 service, the zones concerned\
    \ could only be signed if the\n   private key material used was effectively public,\
    \ obviating any\n   security benefit resulting from the use of those keys.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  A Brief History of AS112
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  A Brief History of AS112\n   Widespread use of the private address\
    \ blocks listed in [RFC1918]\n   followed that document's publication in 1996.\
    \  At that time, the\n   IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was served by root servers.\n   The\
    \ idea of offloading IN-ADDR.ARPA queries relating to [RFC1918]\n   addresses\
    \ from the root nameservers was first proposed by Bill\n   Manning and John Brown.\n\
    \   The use of anycast for distributing authoritative DNS service for\n   [RFC1918]\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA zones was subsequently proposed at a private\n   meeting of root\
    \ server operators.\n   ARIN provided an IPv4 prefix for the anycast service and\
    \ also the\n   autonomous system number 112 for use in originating that prefix.\n\
    \   This assignment gave the project its name.\n   In 2002, the first AS112 anycast\
    \ nodes were deployed.\n   In 2011, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone was redelegated from\
    \ the root servers\n   to a new set of servers operated independently by AfriNIC,\
    \ APNIC,\n   ARIN, ICANN, LACNIC, and the RIPE NCC and named according to\n  \
    \ [RFC5855].\n   [RFC6304], the precursor to this document, was published in\n\
    \   July 2011.\n   The use of anycast nameservers in the AS112 project contributed\
    \ to\n   the operational experience of anycast DNS services, and it can be\n \
    \  seen as a precursor to the anycast distribution of other\n   authoritative\
    \ DNS servers in subsequent years (e.g., various root\n   servers).\n"
