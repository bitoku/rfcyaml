    \   (LDAP) Assertion Control, which allows a client to specify that a\n   directory\

- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) [RFC4510] assertion control.  The assertion control allows the\n  \
    \ client to specify a condition that must be true for the operation to\n   be\
    \ processed normally.  Otherwise, the operation is not performed.\n   For instance,\
    \ the control can be used with the Modify operation\n   [RFC4511] to perform atomic\
    \ \"test and set\" and \"test and clear\"\n   operations.\n   The control may\
    \ be attached to any update operation to support\n   conditional addition, deletion,\
    \ modification, and renaming of the\n   target object.  The asserted condition\
    \ is evaluated as an integral\n   part the operation.\n   The control may also\
    \ be used with the search operation.  Here, the\n   assertion is applied to the\
    \ base object of the search before\n   searching for objects that match the search\
    \ scope and filter.\n   The control may also be used with the compare operation.\
    \  Here, it\n   extends the compare operation to allow a more complex assertion.\n"
- title: 2. Terminology
  contents:
  - "2. Terminology\n   Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit\n\
    \   tags.  The term \"BER-encoded\" means the element is to be encoded\n   using\
    \ the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions\n   detailed in Section\
    \ 5.1 of [RFC4511].\n   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).\n \
    \  DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in BCP 14\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  The Assertion Control
  contents:
  - "3.  The Assertion Control\n   The assertion control is an LDAP Control [RFC4511]\
    \ whose controlType\n   is 1.3.6.1.1.12 and whose controlValue is a BER-encoded\
    \ Filter\n   [Protocol, Section 4.5.1].  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.\n\
    \   There is no corresponding response control.\n   The control is appropriate\
    \ for both LDAP interrogation and update\n   operations [RFC4511], including Add,\
    \ Compare, Delete, Modify,\n   ModifyDN (rename), and Search.  It is inappropriate\
    \ for Abandon,\n   Bind, Unbind, and StartTLS operations.\n   When the control\
    \ is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of\n   the request is conditional\
    \ on the evaluation of the Filter as applied\n   against the target of the operation.\
    \  If the Filter evaluates to\n   TRUE, then the request is processed normally.\
    \  If the Filter\n   evaluates to FALSE or Undefined, then assertionFailed (122)\n\
    \   resultCode is returned, and no further processing is performed.\n   For Add,\
    \ Compare, and ModifyDN operations, the target is indicated by\n   the entry field\
    \ in the request.  For Modify operations, the target is\n   indicated by the object\
    \ field.  For Delete operations, the target is\n   indicated by the DelRequest\
    \ type.  For Compare operations and all\n   update operations, the evaluation\
    \ of the assertion MUST be performed\n   as an integral part of the operation.\
    \  That is, the evaluation of the\n   assertion and the normal processing of the\
    \ operation SHALL be done as\n   one atomic action.\n   For Search operations,\
    \ the target is indicated by the baseObject\n   field, and the evaluation is done\
    \ after \"finding\" but before\n   \"searching\" [RFC4511].  Hence, no entries\
    \ or continuations references\n   are returned if the assertion fails.\n   Servers\
    \ implementing this technical specification SHOULD publish the\n   object identifier\
    \ 1.3.6.1.1.12 as a value of the 'supportedControl'\n   attribute [RFC4512] in\
    \ their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to\n   advertise this extension only when\
    \ the client is authorized to use\n   it.\n   Other documents may specify how\
    \ this control applies to other LDAP\n   operations.  In doing so, they must state\
    \ how the target entry is\n   determined.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The filter may, like other components of the\
    \ request, contain\n   sensitive information.  When it does, this information\
    \ should be\n   appropriately protected.\n   As with any general assertion mechanism,\
    \ the mechanism can be used to\n   determine directory content.  Hence, this mechanism\
    \ SHOULD be subject\n   to appropriate access controls.\n   Some assertions may\
    \ be very complex, requiring significant time and\n   resources to evaluate. \
    \ Hence, this mechanism SHOULD be subject to\n   appropriate administrative controls.\n\
    \   Security considerations for the base operations [RFC4511] extended by\n  \
    \ this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations\n   [RFC4510],\
    \ generally apply to implementation and use of this\n   extension.\n"
