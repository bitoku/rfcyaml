    \ this extension adds an optional parameter on the IMAP\n   CREATE command, allowing\

    \ may choose to support this part\n   of the extension, but are not required to.\n"

- title: 2.  New Mailbox Attributes Identifying Special-Use Mailboxes
  contents:
  - "2.  New Mailbox Attributes Identifying Special-Use Mailboxes\n   An IMAP server\
    \ that supports this extension MAY include any or all of\n   the following attributes\
    \ in responses to the non-extended IMAP LIST\n   command.  The new attributes\
    \ are included along with existing\n   attributes, such as \"\\Marked\" and \"\
    \\Noselect\".  A given mailbox may\n   have none, one, or more than one of these\
    \ attributes.  In some cases,\n   a special use is advice to a client about what\
    \ to put in that\n   mailbox.  In other cases, it's advice to a client about what\
    \ to\n   expect to find there.  There is no capability string related to the\n\
    \   support of special-use attributes on the non-extended LIST command.\n   For\
    \ the extended list command [RFC5258], this extension adds a new\n   capability\
    \ string, a new selection option, and a new return option,\n   all called \"SPECIAL-USE\"\
    .  Supporting implementations MUST include\n   the \"SPECIAL-USE\" capability\
    \ string in response to an IMAP CAPABILITY\n   command.  If the client specifies\
    \ the \"SPECIAL-USE\" selection option,\n   the LIST command MUST return only\
    \ those mailboxes that have a\n   special-use attribute set.  If the client specifies\
    \ the \"SPECIAL-USE\"\n   return option, the LIST command MUST return the new\
    \ special-use\n   attributes on those mailboxes that have them set.  The \"SPECIAL-USE\"\
    \n   return option is implied by the \"SPECIAL-USE\" selection option.  The\n\
    \   extended LIST command MAY return SPECIAL-USE attributes even if the\n   client\
    \ does not specify the return option.\n   The new attributes defined here are\
    \ as follows:\n   \\All\n        This mailbox presents all messages in the user's\
    \ message store.\n        Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps,\
    \ those\n        in \\Trash and \\Junk.  When this special use is supported, it\
    \ is\n        almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.\n   \\Archive\n \
    \       This mailbox is used to archive messages.  The meaning of an\n       \
    \ \"archival\" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be\n        used\
    \ to get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them\n        out of the\
    \ user's way, while still making them accessible.\n   \\Drafts\n        This mailbox\
    \ is used to hold draft messages -- typically,\n        messages that are being\
    \ composed but have not yet been sent.  In\n        some server implementations,\
    \ this might be a virtual mailbox,\n        containing messages from other mailboxes\
    \ that are marked with\n        the \"\\Draft\" message flag.  Alternatively,\
    \ this might just be\n        advice that a client put drafts here.\n   \\Flagged\n\
    \        This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as\n        \"\
    important\".  When this special use is supported, it is likely\n        to represent\
    \ a virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other\n        mailboxes) that are\
    \ marked with the \"\\Flagged\" message flag.\n   \\Junk\n        This mailbox\
    \ is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.\n        Some server implementations\
    \ might put messages here\n        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just\
    \ be advice to a\n        client-side spam filter.\n   \\Sent\n        This mailbox\
    \ is used to hold copies of messages that have been\n        sent.  Some server\
    \ implementations might put messages here\n        automatically.  Alternatively,\
    \ this might just be advice that a\n        client save sent messages here.\n\
    \   \\Trash\n        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted\
    \ or\n        marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might\n\
    \        be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes\n    \
    \    that are marked with the \"\\Deleted\" message flag.\n        Alternatively,\
    \ this might just be advice that a client that\n        chooses not to use the\
    \ IMAP \"\\Deleted\" model should use this as\n        its trash location.  In\
    \ server implementations that strictly\n        expect the IMAP \"\\Deleted\"\
    \ model, this special use is likely not\n        to be supported.\n   All of the\
    \ above attributes are OPTIONAL, and any given server or\n   message store may\
    \ support any combination of the attributes, or none\n   at all.  In most cases,\
    \ there will likely be at most one mailbox with\n   a given attribute for a given\
    \ user, but in some server or message\n   store implementations it might be possible\
    \ for multiple mailboxes to\n   have the same special-use attribute.\n   Special-use\
    \ attributes are likely to be user-specific.  User Adam\n   might share his \\\
    Sent mailbox with user Barb, but that mailbox is\n   unlikely to also serve as\
    \ Barb's \\Sent mailbox.  It's certainly\n   possible for Adam and Barb to each\
    \ set the \\Sent use on the same\n   mailbox, but that would be done by specific\
    \ action (see the sections\n   below).\n"
- title: 3.  Extension to IMAP CREATE Command to Set Special-Use Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.  Extension to IMAP CREATE Command to Set Special-Use Attributes\n   As an\
    \ OPTIONAL feature, a server MAY allow clients to designate a\n   mailbox, at\
    \ creation, as having one or more special uses.  This\n   extension defines the\
    \ \"USE\" parameter to the IMAP CREATE command for\n   that purpose (using the\
    \ syntax defined in RFC 4466 section 2.2\n   [RFC4466]).  The new OPTIONAL \"\
    USE\" parameter is followed by a\n   parenthesized list of zero or more special-use\
    \ attributes, as defined\n   above.\n   In some server implementations, some special\
    \ uses may imply automatic\n   action by the server.  For example, creation of\
    \ a \"\\Junk\" mailbox\n   might cause the server to start placing messages that\
    \ have been\n   evaluated as spam into the mailbox.\n   In some server implementations,\
    \ some special uses may result in a\n   mailbox with unusual characteristics or\
    \ side effects.  For example,\n   creation of an \"\\All\" mailbox might cause\
    \ the server to create a\n   virtual mailbox, rather than a standard one, and\
    \ that mailbox might\n   behave in unexpected ways (COPY into it might fail, for\
    \ example).\n   Servers MAY allow the creation of a special-use mailbox even if\
    \ one\n   so designated already exists.  This might have the effect of moving\n\
    \   the special use from the old mailbox to the new one, or might create\n   multiple\
    \ mailboxes with the same special use.  Alternatively, servers\n   MAY refuse\
    \ the creation, considering the designation to be a\n   conflict.\n   If the server\
    \ cannot create a mailbox with the designated special use\n   defined, for whatever\
    \ reason, it MUST NOT create the mailbox, and\n   MUST respond to the CREATE command\
    \ with a tagged NO response.  If the\n   reason for the failure is related to\
    \ the special-use attribute (the\n   specified special use is not supported or\
    \ cannot be assigned to the\n   specified mailbox), the server SHOULD include\
    \ the new \"USEATTR\"\n   response code in the tagged response (see Section 5.3\
    \ for an\n   example).\n   An IMAP server that supports this OPTIONAL feature\
    \ will advertise the\n   \"CREATE-SPECIAL-USE\" capability string.  Clients MUST\
    \ NOT use the\n   \"USE\" parameter unless the server advertises the capability.\
    \  Note\n   that this capability string is different from the \"SPECIAL-USE\"\n\
    \   string defined above, and a server that supports both functions MUST\n   advertise\
    \ both capability strings.\n"
- title: 4.  IMAP METADATA Entry for Special-Use Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.  IMAP METADATA Entry for Special-Use Attributes\n   If a server supports this\
    \ extension and the METADATA extension\n   [RFC5464], it SHOULD tie the special-use\
    \ attributes for a mailbox to\n   its metadata entry \"/private/specialuse\".\
    \  The value of /private/\n   specialuse is either NIL (if there are no special-use\
    \ attributes for\n   that mailbox) or a space-separated list of special-use attributes,\n\
    \   presented the same way they would be presented in the LIST command\n   response.\n\
    \   Such a server MAY allow the setting of special-use attributes through\n  \
    \ the METADATA mechanisms, thereby allowing clients to change the\n   special\
    \ uses of existing mailboxes.  These changes might have side\n   effects, as the\
    \ server automatically adjusts the special uses\n   accordingly, just as it might\
    \ do with CREATE USE, above.  See\n   Section 5.4 for an example.\n   A server\
    \ that supports this MUST check the validity of changes to the\n   special-use\
    \ attributes that are done through the metadata in the same\n   way that it checks\
    \ validity for the CREATE command and for any\n   internal mechanisms for setting\
    \ special uses on mailboxes.  It MUST\n   NOT just blindly accept setting of these\
    \ metadata by clients, which\n   might result in the setting of special uses that\
    \ the implementation\n   does not support, multiple mailboxes with the same special\
    \ use, or\n   other situations that the implementation considers invalid.\n"

    \   Example: If a user is allowed to give the \"\\Junk\" attribute to a\n   shared\
    \ mailbox, legitimate mail that's misclassified as junk (false\n   positives)\
    \ will be put into that shared mailbox, exposing the user's\n   private mail to\
    \ others.  The server might warn a user of that\n   possibility, or might refuse\
    \ to allow the specification to be made on\n   a shared mailbox.  (Note that this\
    \ problem exists independent of this\n   specification, if the server allows a\
    \ user to share a mailbox that's\n   already in use for such a function.)\n"
