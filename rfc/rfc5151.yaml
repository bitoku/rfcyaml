  - "2.  Signaling Overview\n   The RSVP-TE signaling of a TE LSP within a single
    domain is described\n   in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  Inter-domain TE LSPs can
    be supported by\n   one of three options as described in [RFC4726] and set out
    in the\n   next section:\n   - contiguous LSPs\n   - nested LSPs\n   - stitched
    LSPs.\n   In fact, as pointed out in [RFC4726], any combination of these three\n
    \  options may be used in the course of an end-to-end inter-domain LSP.\n   That
    is, the options should be considered as per-domain transit\n   options so that
    an end-to-end inter-domain LSP that starts in domain\n   A, transits domains B,
    C, and D, and ends in domain E might use an\n   LSP that runs contiguously from
    the ingress in domain A, through\n   domain B to the border with domain C.  Domain
    C might be transited\n   using the nested LSP option to reach the border with
    domain D, and\n   domain D might be transited using the stitched LSP option to
    reach\n   the border with domain E, from where a normal LSP runs to the egress.\n
    \  This document describes the RSVP-TE signaling extensions required to\n   select
    and control which of the three signaling mechanisms is used.\n   The specific
    protocol extensions required to signal each LSP type are\n   described in other
    documents and are out of scope for this document.\n   Similarly, the routing extensions
    and path computation techniques\n   necessary for the establishment of inter-domain
    LSPs are out of\n   scope.  An implementation of a transit LSR is unaware of the
    options\n   for inter-domain TE LSPs since it sees only TE LSPs.  An\n   implementation
    of a domain border LSR has to decide what mechanisms\n   of inter-domain TE LSP
    support to include, but must in any case\n   support contiguous inter-domain TE
    LSPs since this is the default\n   mode of operation for RSVP-TE.  Failure to
    support either or both of\n   nested LSPs or stitched LSPs, restricts the operators
    options, but\n   does not prevent the establishment of inter-domain TE LSPs.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Signaling Options\n   There are three ways in which an RSVP-TE LSP could
      be signaled across\n   multiple domains:\n   Contiguous\n      A contiguous
      TE LSP is a single TE LSP that is set up across\n      multiple domains using
      RSVP-TE signaling procedures described in\n      [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  No
      additional TE LSPs are required to\n      create a contiguous TE LSP, and the
      same RSVP-TE information for\n      the TE LSP is maintained along the entire
      LSP path.  In\n      particular, the TE LSP has the same RSVP-TE session and
      LSP ID at\n      every LSR along its path.\n   Nested\n      One or more TE
      LSPs may be nested within another TE LSP as\n      described in [RFC4206].  This
      technique can be used to nest one or\n      more inter-domain TE LSPs into an
      intra-domain hierarchical LSP\n      (H-LSP).  The label stacking construct
      is used to achieve nesting\n      in packet networks.  In the rest of this document,
      the term H-LSP\n      is used to refer to an LSP that allows other LSPs to be
      nested\n      within it.  An H-LSP may be advertised as a TE link within the\n
      \     same instance of the routing protocol as was used to advertise the\n      TE
      links from which it was created, in which case it is a\n      Forwarding Adjacency
      (FA) [RFC4206].\n   Stitched\n      The concept of LSP stitching as well as
      the required signaling\n      procedures are described in [RFC5150].  This technique
      can be used\n      to stitch together shorter LSPs (LSP segments) to create
      a single,\n      longer LSP.  The LSP segments of an inter-domain LSP may be\n
      \     intra-domain LSPs or inter-domain LSPs.\n      The process of stitching
      in the data plane results in a single,\n      end-to-end contiguous LSP.  But
      in the control plane, each segment\n      is signaled as a separate LSP (with
      distinct RSVP sessions) and\n      the end-to-end LSP is signaled as yet another
      LSP with its own\n      RSVP session.  Thus, the control plane operation for
      LSP stitching\n      is very similar to that for nesting.\n   An end-to-end
      inter-domain TE LSP may be achieved using one or more\n   of the signaling techniques
      described.  The choice is a matter of\n   policy for the node requesting LSP
      setup (the ingress) and policy for\n   each successive domain border node.  On
      receipt of an LSP setup\n   request (RSVP-TE Path message) for an inter-domain
      TE LSP, the\n   decision of whether to signal the LSP contiguously or whether
      to nest\n   or stitch it to another TE LSP depends on the parameters signaled\n
      \  from the ingress node and on the configuration of the local node.\n   The
      stitching segment LSP or H-LSP used to cross a domain may be\n   pre-established
      or signaled dynamically based on the demand caused by\n   the arrival of the
      inter-domain TE LSP setup request.\n"

  title: 2.  Signaling Overview
- contents:
  - "3.  Procedures on the Domain Border Node\n   Whether an inter-domain TE LSP is
    contiguous, nested, or stitched is\n   limited by the signaling methods supported
    by or configured on the\n   intermediate nodes.  It is usually the domain border
    nodes where this\n   restriction applies since other transit nodes are oblivious
    to the\n   mechanism in use.  The ingress of the LSP may further restrict the\n
    \  choice by setting parameters in the Path message when it is signaled.\n   When
    a domain border node receives the RSVP Path message for an\n   inter-domain TE
    LSP setup, it MUST carry out the following procedures\n   before it can forward
    the Path message to the next node along the\n   path:\n      1.  Apply policies
    for the domain and the domain border node.\n          These policies may restrict
    the establishment of inter-domain\n          TE LSPs.  In case of a policy failure,
    the node SHOULD fail\n          the setup and send a PathErr message with error
    code \"Policy\n          control failure\"/ \"Inter-domain policy failure\".\n
    \     2.  Determine the signaling method to be used to cross the domain.\n          If
    the ingress node of the inter-domain TE LSP has specified\n          restrictions
    on the methods to be used, these MUST be adhered\n          to.  Within the freedom
    allowed by the ingress node, the\n          domain border node MAY choose any
    method according to local\n          configuration and policies.  If no resultant
    signaling method\n          is available or allowed, the domain border node MUST
    send a\n          PathErr message with an error code as described in Section\n
    \         4.1.\n          Thus, for example, an ingress may request a contiguous
    LSP\n          because it wishes to exert maximal control over the LSP's path\n
    \         and to control when reoptimization takes place.  But the\n          operator
    of a transit domain may decide (for example) that\n          only LSP stitching
    is allowed for exactly the reason that it\n          gives the operator the chance
    to reoptimize their own domain\n          under their own control.  In this case,
    the policy applied at\n          the entry to the transit domain will result in
    the return of a\n          PathErr message and the ingress has a choice to:\n
    \         - find another path avoiding the transit domain,\n          - relax
    his requirements, or\n          - fail to provide the service.\n      3.  Carry
    out ERO procedures as described in Section 3 in addition\n          to the procedures
    in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].\n      4.  Perform any path computations as required
    to determine the\n          path across the domain and potentially to select the
    exit\n          point from the domain.\n          The path computation procedure
    is outside the scope of this\n          document.  A path computation option is
    specified in\n          [RFC5152], and another option is to use a Path Computation\n
    \         Element (PCE) [RFC4655].\n         4a.  In the case of nesting or stitching,
    either find an\n              existing intra-domain TE LSP to carry the inter-domain
    TE\n              LSP or signal a new one, depending on local policy.\n          In
    the event of a path computation failure, a PathErr message\n          SHOULD be
    sent with error code \"Routing Problem\" using an\n          error value selected
    according to the reason for computation\n          failure.  A domain border node
    MAY opt to silently discard the\n          Path message in this case as described
    in Section 8.\n   In the event of the receipt of a PathErr message reporting signaling\n
    \  failure from within the domain or reported from a downstream domain,\n   the
    domain border node MAY apply crankback procedures as described in\n   Section
    3.2.  If crankback is not applied, or is exhausted, the\n   border node MUST continue
    with PathErr processing as described in\n   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].\n   In the
    event of successful processing of a Path or Resv message, the\n   domain border
    node MUST carry out RRO procedures as described in\n   Section 3.3.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Rules on ERO Processing\n   The ERO that a domain border node receives
      in the Path message was\n   supplied by the ingress node of the TE LSP and may
      have been updated\n   by other nodes (for example, other domain border nodes)
      as the Path\n   message was propagated.  The content of the ERO depends on several\n
      \  factors including:\n   - the path computation techniques used,\n   - the
      degree of TE visibility available to the nodes performing path\n     computation,
      and\n   - the policy at the nodes creating/modifying the ERO.\n   In general,
      H-LSPs and LSP segments are used between domain border\n   nodes, but there
      is no restriction on the use of such LSPs to span\n   multiple hops entirely
      within a domain.  Therefore, the discussion\n   that follows may be equally
      applied to any node within a domain\n   although the term \"domain border node\"
      continues to be used for\n   clarity.\n   When a Path message reaches the domain
      border node, the following\n   rules apply for ERO processing and for further
      signaling.\n      1.  If there are any policies related to ERO processing for
      the\n          LSP, they MUST be applied and corresponding actions MUST be\n
      \         taken.  For example, there might be a policy to reject EROs\n          that
      identify nodes within the domain.  In case of\n          inter-domain LSP setup
      failures due to policy failures related\n          to ERO processing, the node
      SHOULD issue a PathErr with error\n          code \"Policy control failure\"/\"Inter-domain
      explicit route\n          rejected\", but MAY be configured to silently discard
      the Path\n          message or to return a different error code for security\n
      \         reasons.\n      2.  Section 8.2 of [RFC4206] describes how a node
      at the edge of a\n          region processes the ERO in the incoming Path message
      and uses\n          this ERO, to either find an existing H-LSP or signal a new\n
      \         H-LSP using the ERO hops.  This process includes adjusting the\n          ERO
      before sending the Path message to the next hop.  These\n          procedures
      MUST be followed for nesting or stitching of\n          inter-domain TE LSPs.\n
      \     3.  If an ERO subobject identifies a TE link formed by the\n          advertisement
      of an H-LSP or LSP segment (whether numbered or\n          unnumbered), contiguous
      signaling MUST NOT be used.  The node\n          MUST use either nesting or
      stitching according to the\n          capabilities of the LSP that forms the
      TE link, the parameters\n          signaled in the Path message, and local policy.
      \ If there is a\n          conflict between the capabilities of the LSP that
      forms the TE\n          link indicated in the ERO and the parameters on the
      Path\n          message, the domain border node SHOULD send a PathErr with\n
      \         error code \"Routing Problem\"/\"ERO conflicts with inter-domain\n
      \         signaling method\", but MAY be configured to silently discard\n          the
      Path message or to return a different error code for\n          security reasons.\n
      \     4.  An ERO in a Path message received by a domain border node may\n          have
      a loose hop as the next hop.  This may be an IP address\n          or an AS
      number.  In such cases, the ERO MUST be expanded to\n          determine the
      path to the next hop using some form of path\n          computation that may,
      itself, generate loose hops.\n      5.  In the absence of any ERO subobjects
      beyond the local domain\n          border node, the LSP egress (the destination
      encoded in the\n          RSVP Session object) MUST be considered as the next
      loose hop\n          and rule 4 applied.\n      6.  In the event of any other
      failures processing the ERO, a\n          PathErr message SHOULD be sent as
      described in [RFC3209] or\n          [RFC3473], but a domain border router MAY
      be configured to\n          silently discard the Path message or to return a
      different\n          error code for security reasons.\n"

    - "3.2.  LSP Setup Failure and Crankback\n   When an error occurs during LSP setup,
      a PathErr message is sent back\n   towards the LSP ingress node to report the
      problem.  If the LSP\n   traverses multiple domains, this PathErr will be seen
      successively by\n   each domain border node.\n   Domain border nodes MAY apply
      local policies to restrict the\n   propagation of information about the contents
      of the domain.  For\n   example, a domain border node MAY replace the information
      in a\n   PathErr message that indicates a specific failure at a specific node\n
      \  with information that reports a more general error with the entire\n   domain.
      \ These procedures are similar to those described for the\n   borders of overlay
      networks in [RFC4208].\n   However:\n   - A domain border node MUST NOT suppress
      the propagation of a PathErr\n     message except to attempt rerouting as described
      below.\n   - Nodes other than domain border nodes SHOULD NOT modify the contents\n
      \    of a PathErr message.\n   - Domain border nodes SHOULD NOT modify the contents
      of a PathErr\n     message unless domain confidentiality is a specific requirement.\n
      \  Domain border nodes provide an opportunity for crankback rerouting\n   [RFC4920].
      \ On receipt of a PathErr message generated because of an\n   LSP setup failure,
      a domain border node MAY hold the PathErr and make\n   further attempts to establish
      the LSP if allowed by local policy and\n   by the parameters signaled on the
      Path message for the LSP.  Such\n   attempts might involve the computation of
      alternate routes through\n   the domain, or the selection of different downstream
      domains.  If a\n   subsequent attempt is successful, the domain border router
      MUST\n   discard the held PathErr message, but if all subsequent attempts are\n
      \  unsuccessful, the domain border router MUST send the PathErr upstream\n   toward
      the ingress node.  In this latter case, the domain border\n   router MAY change
      the information in the PathErr message to provide\n   further crankback details
      and information aggregation as described in\n   [RFC4920].\n   Crankback rerouting
      MAY also be used to handle the failure of LSPs\n   after they have been established
      [RFC4920].\n"

    - "3.3.  RRO Processing across Domains\n   [RFC3209] defines the RRO as an optional
      object used for loop\n   detection and for providing information about the hops
      traversed by\n   LSPs.\n   As described for overlay networks in [RFC4208], a
      domain border node\n   MAY filter or modify the information provided in an RRO
      for\n   confidentiality reasons according to local policy.  For example, a\n
      \  series of identifiers of hops within a domain MAY be replaced with\n   the
      domain identifier (such as the AS number) or be removed entirely\n   leaving
      just the domain border nodes.\n   Note that a domain border router MUST NOT
      mask its own presence, and\n   MUST include itself in the RRO.\n   Such filtering
      of RRO information does not hamper the working of the\n   signaling protocol,
      but the subsequent information loss may render\n   management diagnostic procedures
      inoperable or at least make them\n   more complicated, requiring the coordination
      of administrators of\n   multiple domains.\n   Similarly, protocol procedures
      that depend on the presence of RRO\n   information may become inefficient.  For
      example, the Fast Reroute\n   procedures defined in [RFC4090] use information
      in the RRO to\n   determine the labels to use and the downstream MP.\n"

      \ They may be sent direct\n   rather than hop-by-hop, and so may speed the propagation
      of error\n   information.  If a domain border router is interested in seeing
      such\n   messages (for example, to enable it to provide protection switching),\n
      \  it is RECOMMENDED that the domain border router update the Notify\n   Request
      objects in the Path and Resv messages to show its own address\n   following
      the procedures of [RFC3473].\n   Note that the replacement of a Notify Recipient
      in the Notify Request\n   object means that some Notify messages (for example,
      those intended\n   for delivery to the ingress LSR) may need to be examined,
      processed,\n   and forwarded at domain borders.  This is an obvious trade-off
      issue\n   as the ability to handle notifiable events locally (i.e., within the\n
      \  domain) may or may not outweigh the cost of processing and forwarding\n   Notify
      messages beyond the domain.  Observe that the cost increases\n   linearly with
      the number of domains in use.\n   Also note that, as described in Section 8,
      a domain administrator may\n   wish to filter or modify Notify messages that
      are generated within a\n   domain in order to preserve security or confidentiality

      there may be a network-wide policy that\n   determines which one of the three
      inter-domain LSP techniques is\n   used.  In these cases, no protocol extensions
      are required.\n   However, in environments that support more than one technique,
      an\n   ingress node may wish to constrain the choice made by domain border\n
      \  nodes for each inter-domain TE LSP that it originates.\n   [RFC4420] defines
      the LSP_Attributes object that can be used to\n   signal required attributes
      of an LSP.  The Attributes Flags TLV\n   includes Boolean flags that define
      individual attributes.\n   This document defines a new bit in the TLV that can
      be set by the\n   ingress node of an inter-domain TE LSP to restrict the intermediate\n
      \  nodes to using contiguous signaling:\n      Contiguous LSP bit (bit number
      assignment in Section 9.1)\n   This flag is set by the ingress node that originates
      a Path message\n   to set up an inter-domain TE LSP if it requires that the
      contiguous\n   LSP technique is used.  This flag bit is only to be used in the\n
      \  Attributes Flags TLV.\n   When a domain border LSR receives a Path message
      containing this bit\n   set (one), the node MUST NOT perform stitching or nesting
      in support\n   of the inter-domain TE LSP being set up.  When this bit is clear\n
      \  (zero), a domain border LSR MAY perform stitching or nesting\n   according
      to local policy.\n   This bit MUST NOT be modified by any transit node.\n   An
      intermediate node that supports the LSP_Attributes object and the\n   Attributes
      Flags TLV, and also recognizes the \"Contiguous LSP\" bit,\n   but cannot support
      contiguous TE LSPs, MUST send a Path Error message\n   with an error code \"Routing
      Problem\"/\"Contiguous LSP type not\n   supported\" if it receives a Path message
      with this bit set.\n   If an intermediate node receiving a Path message with
      the \"Contiguous\n   LSP\" bit set in the Flags field of the LSP_Attributes,
      recognizes the\n   object, the TLV, and the bit and also supports the desired
      contiguous\n   LSP behavior, then it MUST signal a contiguous LSP.  If the node
      is a\n   domain border node, or if the node expands a loose hop in the ERO,
      it\n   MUST include an RRO Attributes subobject in the RRO of the\n   corresponding
      Resv message (if such an object is present) with the\n   \"Contiguous LSP\"
      bit set to report its behavior.\n   Domain border LSRs MUST support and act
      on the setting of the\n   \"Contiguous LSP\" flag.\n   However, if the intermediate
      node supports the LSP_Attributes object\n   but does not recognize the Attributes
      Flags TLV, or supports the TLV\n   but does not recognize this \"Contiguous
      LSP\" bit, then it MUST\n   forward the object unmodified.\n   The choice of
      action by an ingress node that receives a PathErr when\n   requesting the use
      of a contiguous LSP is out of the scope of this\n   document, but may include
      the computation of an alternate path.\n"

    \ This means that\n   these LSPs will also be subjected to ERO processing, policies,

        \ If the domain border falls on a\n   link as described in the previous section,
        the border node at either\n   end of the link may fail.  Alternatively, if
        the border falls on a\n   border node (as is the case with IGP areas), that
        single border node\n   may fail.\n   It can be seen that if stitching or nesting
        is used, the failed node\n   will be the start or end (or both) of a stitching
        segment LSP or\n   H-LSP, in which case protection must be provided to the
        far end of\n   the stitching segment or H-LSP.  Thus, where one of these two\n
        \  techniques is in use, the PLR will be the upstream domain entry point\n

        \  border node, both cases will apply.\n   If the contiguous LSP mechanism
        is in use, normal selection of the\n   PLR and MP can be applied, and any
        node within the domains may be\n   used to fill these roles.\n   As before,
        selection of a suitable backup tunnel (in this case, an\n   NNHOP backup)
        must consider the paths of the backed-up LSPs and the\n   available NNHOP
        tunnels by examination of their RROs.\n   Note that where the PLR is not immediately
        upstream of the failed\n   node, error propagation time may be delayed unless
        some mechanism\n   such as [BFD-MPLS] is implemented or unless direct reporting,

  - "6.  Reoptimization of Inter-Domain TE LSPs\n   Reoptimization of a TE LSP is
    the process of moving the LSP from the\n   current path to a more preferred path.
    \ This involves the\n   determination of the preferred path and make-before-break
    signaling\n   procedures [RFC3209] to minimize traffic disruption.\n   Reoptimization
    of an inter-domain TE LSP may require a new path in\n   more than one domain.\n
    \  The nature of the inter-domain LSP setup mechanism defines how\n   reoptimization
    can be applied.  If the LSP is contiguous, then the\n   signaling of the make-before-break
    process MUST be initiated by the\n   ingress node as defined in [RFC3209].  But
    if the reoptimization is\n   limited to a change in path within one domain (that
    is, if there is\n   no change to the domain border nodes) and nesting or stitching
    is in\n   use, the H-LSP or stitching segment may be independently reoptimized\n
    \  within the domain without impacting the end-to-end LSP.\n   In all cases, however,
    the ingress LSR may wish to exert control and\n   coordination over the reoptimization
    process.  For example, a transit\n   domain may be aware of the potential for
    reoptimization, but not\n   bother because it is not worried by the level of service
    being\n   provided across the domain.  But the cumulative effect on the\n   end-to-end
    LSP may cause the head-end to worry and trigger an\n   end-to-end reoptimization
    request (of course, the transit domain may\n   choose to ignore the request).\n
    \  Another benefit of end-to-end reoptimization over per-domain\n   reoptimization
    for non-contiguous inter-domain LSPs is that\n   per-domain reoptimization is
    restricted to preserve the domain entry\n   and exit points (since to do otherwise
    would break the LSP!).  But\n   end-to-end reoptimization is more flexible and
    can select new domain\n   border LSRs.\n   There may be different cost-benefit
    analysis considerations between\n   end-to-end reoptimization and per-domain reoptimization.
    \ The greater\n   the number of hops involved in the reoptimization, the higher
    the\n   risk of traffic disruption.  The shorter the segment reoptimized, the\n
    \  lower the chance of making a substantial improvement on the quality\n   of
    the end-to-end LSP.  Administrative policies should be applied in\n   this area
    with care.\n   [RFC4736] describes mechanisms that allow:\n   - The ingress node
    to request each node with a loose next hop to\n     re-evaluate the current path
    in order to search for a more optimal\n     path.\n   - A node with a loose next
    hop to inform the ingress node that a\n     better path exists.\n   These mechanisms
    SHOULD be used for reoptimization of a contiguous\n   inter-domain TE LSP.\n   Note
    that end-to-end reoptimization may involve a non-local\n   modification that might
    select new entry / exit points.  In this\n   case, we can observe that local reoptimization
    is more easily and\n   flexibly achieved using nesting or stitching.  Further,
    the \"locality\n   principle\" (i.e., the idea of keeping information only where
    it is\n   needed) is best achieved using stitching or nesting.  That said, a\n
    \  contiguous LSP can easily be modified to take advantage of local\n   reoptimizations
    (as defined in [RFC4736]) even if this would require\n   the dissemination of
    information and the invocation of signaling\n   outside the local domain.\n"

    key management.\n   [RFC4107] states a requirement for mandatory automated key
    management\n   under certain situations.  There is work starting in the IETF to\n
    \  define improved authentication including automated key management for\n   RSVP.
    \ Implementations and deployments of RSVP should pay attention\n   to any capabilities
    and requirements that are outputs from this\n   ongoing work.\n   A separate document
    is being prepared to examine the security aspects\n   of RSVP-TE signaling with
    special reference to multi-domain scenarios\n   [MPLS-SEC].  [RFC4726] provides
    an overview of the requirements for\n   security in an MPLS-TE or GMPLS multi-domain
    environment.\n   Before electing to utilize inter-domain signaling for MPLS-TE,
    the\n   administrators of neighboring domains MUST satisfy themselves as to\n
    \  the existence of a suitable trust relationship between the domains.\n   In
    the absence of such a relationship, the administrators SHOULD\n   decide not to
    deploy inter-domain signaling, and SHOULD disable\n   RSVP-TE on any inter-domain
    interfaces.\n   When signaling an inter-domain RSVP-TE LSP, an operator MAY make
    use\n   of the security features already defined for RSVP-TE [RFC3209].  This\n
    \  may require some coordination between the domains to share the keys\n   (see
    [RFC2747] and [RFC3097]), and care is required to ensure that\n   the keys are
    changed sufficiently frequently.  Note that this may\n   involve additional synchronization,
    should the domain border nodes be\n   protected with FRR, since the MP and PLR
    should also share the key.\n   For an inter-domain TE LSP, especially when it
    traverses different\n   administrative or trust domains, the following mechanisms
    SHOULD be\n   provided to an operator (also see [RFC4216]):\n   1) A way to enforce
    policies and filters at the domain borders to\n      process the incoming inter-domain
    TE LSP setup requests (Path\n      messages) based on certain agreed trust and
    service\n      levels/contracts between domains.  Various LSP attributes such
    as\n      bandwidth, priority, etc. could be part of such a contract.\n   2) A
    way for the operator to rate-limit LSP setup requests or error\n      notifications
    from a particular domain.\n   3) A mechanism to allow policy-based outbound RSVP
    message processing\n      at the domain border node, which may involve filtering
    or\n      modification of certain addresses in RSVP objects and messages.\n   Additionally,
    an operator may wish to reduce the signaling\n   interactions between domains
    to improve security.  For example, the\n   operator might not trust the neighboring
    domain to supply correct or\n   trustable restart information [RFC5063] and might
    ensure that the\n   availability of restart function is not configured in the
    Hello\n   message exchange across the domain border.  Thus, suitable\n   configuration
    MUST be provided in an RSVP-TE implementation to enable\n   the operator to control
    optional protocol features that may be\n   considered a security risk.\n   Some
    examples of the policies described above are as follows:\n     A) An operator
    may choose to implement some kind of ERO filtering\n        policy on the domain
    border node to disallow or ignore hops\n        within the domain from being identified
    in the ERO of an\n        incoming Path message.  That is, the policy is that
    a node\n        outside the domain cannot specify the path of the LSP inside the\n
    \       domain.  The domain border LSR can make implement this policy in\n        one
    of two ways:\n          - It can reject the Path message.\n          - It can
    ignore the hops in the ERO that lie within the\n            domain.\n     B) In
    order to preserve confidentiality of network topology, an\n        operator may
    choose to disallow recording of hops within the\n        domain in the RRO or
    may choose to filter out certain recorded\n        RRO addresses at the domain
    border node.\n     C) An operator may require the border node to modify the addresses\n
    \       of certain messages like PathErr or Notify originated from hops\n        within
    the domain.\n     D) In the event of a path computation failure, an operator may\n
    \       require the border node to silently discard the Path message\n        instead
    of returning a PathErr.  This is because a Path message\n        could be interpreted
    as a network probe, and a PathErr provides\n        information about the network
    capabilities and policies.\n   Note that the detailed specification of such policies
    and their\n   implementation are outside the scope of this document.\n   Operations,
    Administration, and Management (OAM) mechanisms including\n   [BFD-MPLS] and [RFC4379]
    are commonly used to verify the connectivity\n   of end-to-end LSPs and to trace
    their paths.  Where the LSPs are\n   inter-domain LSPs, such OAM techniques MAY
    require that OAM messages\n   are intercepted or modified at domain borders, or
    are passed\n   transparently across domains.  Further discussion of this topic
    can\n   be found in [INTERAS-PING] and [MPLS-SEC].\n"

    - "9.2.  New Error Codes\n   New RSVP error codes/values have been allocated from
      the \"Error Codes\n   and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes\" sub-registry
      of the \"RSVP\n   Parameters\" registry.\n   For the existing error code \"Policy
      control failure\" (value 2), two\n   new error values have been registered as
      follows:\n      103 = Inter-domain policy failure\n      104 = Inter-domain
      explicit route rejected\n   For the existing error code \"Routing Problem\"
      (value 24), two new\n   error values have been registered as follows:\n      28
      = Contiguous LSP type not supported\n      29 = ERO conflicts with inter-domain
      signaling method\n"
