  - "Abstract\n   This document presents examples and inspiration for operator\n \
    \  application of BGP Large Communities.  Based on operational\n   experience\
    \ with BGP Communities, this document suggests logical\n   categories of BGP Large\
    \ Communities and demonstrates an orderly\n   manner of organizing community values\
    \ within them to achieve typical\n   goals in routing policy.  Any operator can\
    \ consider using the\n   concepts presented as the basis for their own BGP Large\
    \ Communities\n   repertoire.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP Large Communities [RFC8092] provide a mechanism to signal\
    \ opaque\n   information between and within Autonomous Systems (ASes).  In very\n\
    \   much the same way that [RFC1998] provides a concrete real-world\n   application\
    \ for BGP Communities [RFC1997], this document presents\n   examples of how operators\
    \ might utilize BGP Large Communities to\n   achieve various goals.  This document\
    \ draws on the experience of\n   operator communities such as the North American\
    \ Network Operators'\n   Group (NANOG) <https://www.nanog.org/> and the Netherlands\
    \ Network\n   Operator Group (NLNOG) <https://nlnog.net/>.\n"
- title: 2.  The Design Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  The Design Overview\n   BGP Large Communities are composed of three 4-octet\
    \ fields.  The\n   first is the Global Administrator (GA) field, whose value is\
    \ the\n   Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the AS that has defined the meaning\n\
    \   of the remaining two 4-octet fields, known as \"Local Data Part 1\" and\n\
    \   \"Local Data Part 2\".  This document describes an approach where the\n  \
    \ \"Local Data Part 1\" field contains a function identifier and the\n   \"Local\
    \ Data Part 2\" contains a parameter value.  Using the canonical\n   notation\
    \ this format can be summarized as \"ASN:Function:Parameter\".\n             \

    \                          Table 1: Field Mapping\n   The table above shows a\
    \ mapping table between the fields in BGP Large\n   Communities [RFC8092] and\
    \ this document.\n   In contemporary deployments of both BGP Communities [RFC1997]\
    \ and BGP\n   Large Communities [RFC8092], the function of a community can be\n\
    \   divided into two categories:\n   o  Informational Communities\n   o  Action\
    \ Communities\n   Throughout the document, a topology of four ASes is used to\n\
    \   illustrate the use of communities in the following configuration:\n      \
    \     AS 65551\n               |\n               ^\n               |\n       \
    \    AS 64497\n             /  \\\n            ^    \\\n           /      ^\n\
    \      AS 64498     \\\n          |        |\n          `<->- AS 64499\n   AS\
    \ 64497 obtains transit services from (is a customer of) AS 65551, a\n   4-octet\
    \ ASN.  AS 64497 provides transit services to both AS 64498 and\n   AS 64499.\
    \  AS 64498 and AS 64499 maintain a peering relationship in\n   which they only\
    \ exchange their customer routes.\n   The opaque nature of BGP Large Communities\
    \ allows for rapid\n   deployment of new features or changes to their routing\
    \ policy that\n   perform an action.  Operators are encouraged to publicly publish\
    \ and\n   maintain documentation on the purpose of each BGP Large Community,\n\
    \   both Informational and Action, that they support or that are visible\n   in\
    \ BGP RIBs.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Informational Communities
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Informational Communities\n   Informational Communities are labels for\
    \ attributes such as the\n   origin of the route announcement, the nature of the\
    \ relation with an\n   External BGP (EBGP) neighbor, or the intended propagation\
    \ audience.\n   Informational Communities can also assist in providing valuable\n\
    \   information for day-to-day network operations such as debugging or\n   capacity\
    \ planning.\n   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN of the network\
    \ that\n   tags the routes with the Informational Communities.  For example, AS\n\
    \   64497 might add a community with the GA 64497 to a route accepted\n   from\
    \ an Internal BGP (IBGP) or EBGP neighbor as a means of signaling\n   that it\
    \ was imported in a certain geographical region.\n   In general, the intended\
    \ audiences of Informational Communities are\n   downstream networks and the GA\
    \ itself, but any AS could benefit from\n   receiving these communities.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Action Communities
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Action Communities\n   Action Communities are added as labels to request\
    \ that a route be\n   treated in a particular way within an AS.  The operator\
    \ of the AS\n   defines a routing policy that adjusts path attributes based on\
    \ the\n   community.  For example, the route's propagation characteristics, the\n\
    \   LOCAL_PREF (local preference), the next hop, or the number of AS_PATH\n  \
    \ prepends to be added when it is received or propagated can be\n   changed.\n\
    \   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN that has defined the\n  \
    \ functionality of that BGP Large Community and is the ASN that is\n   expected\
    \ to perform the action.  For example, AS 64499 might label a\n   route with a\
    \ BGP Large Community containing GA 64497 to request that\n   AS 64497 perform\
    \ a predefined action on that route.\n   In general, the intended audience of\
    \ Action Communities are transit\n   providers taking action on behalf of a customer\
    \ or the GA itself, but\n   any AS could take action if they choose and any AS\
    \ could add an\n   Action Community with the GA of a non-adjacent ASN.  However,\
    \ note\n   that an Action Community could also be Informational.  Its presence\n\
    \   is an indicator that the GA may have performed the action and that an\n  \
    \ AS in the AS_PATH requested it.\n   Operators are recommended to publish the\
    \ relative order in which\n   Action Communities (both BGP Communities and BGP\
    \ Large Communities)\n   are processed in their routing policy.\n"

    \ AS 64497 and AS 64498, AS 64497 might\n   expose BGP traffic-engineering functions\
    \ to AS 64498.  One such BGP\n   traffic-engineering function might allow AS 64498\
    \ to manipulate the\n   value of the LOCAL_PREF attribute of routes learned from\
    \ AS 64498\n   within AS 64497, even though the LOCAL_PREF attribute is\n   non-transitive\
    \ and is not propagated to EBGP neighbors.\n   The LOCAL_PREF value of routes\
    \ are locally significant within each AS\n   and are impossible to list in this\

- title: 4.4.  Route Server Prefix Distribution Control
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Route Server Prefix Distribution Control\n   Route servers [RFC7947] use\
    \ BGP to broker network reachability\n   information among their clients.  As\
    \ not all route server clients may\n   wish to interconnect with each other, the\
    \ route server operator will\n   usually implement a mechanism to allow each client\
    \ to control the\n   route server's export routing policy, as described in Section\
    \ 4.6 of\n   [RFC7948].  One widely used mechanism is an adaption of \"ASN-Based\n\
    \   Selective NO_EXPORT\" (Section 4.1.1) that is specific to route\n   servers.\n\
    \   An example BGP Large Communities policy that enables client-\n   controlled\
    \ prefix distribution for a route server operating as AS\n   64511 is outlined\
    \ as follows:\n   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n\

    \        Table 12: Action: Route Server Prefix Distribution Control\n   Multiple\
    \ BGP Large Community values can be used together to implement\n   fine-grained\
    \ route distribution control.  For example, route server\n   client AS 64500 might\
    \ wish to use a route server for interconnecting\n   to all other clients except\
    \ AS 64509.  In this case, they would label\n   all their outbound routes to the\
    \ route server with 64511:1:0 (to\n   announce to all clients by default) and\
    \ 64511:0:64509 (to prevent\n   announcement to AS 64509).\n   Alternatively,\
    \ route server client AS 64501 may have a selective\n   routing policy and may\
    \ wish to interconnect with only AS 64505 and AS\n   64506.  This could be implemented\
    \ by announcing routes labeled with\n   64511:0:0 (blocking all distribution by\
    \ default) and 64511:1:64505,\n   64511:1:64506 to instruct the route server to\
    \ force announcement to\n   those two ASNs.\n"
