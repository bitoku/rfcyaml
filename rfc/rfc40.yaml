  - "               More Comments on the Forthcoming Protocol\nWe have recently discussed\
    \ NWG/RFC Nos. 36 and 39 with Steve Crocker,\nUCLA.  Steve has asked that we elaborate\
    \ on the errors, queries, and\nHOST status that were mentioned in NWG/RFC #39.\n\
    Please voice your opinions soon in order to affect the forthcoming\nprotocol specifications.\n\
    ERROR MESSAGES\n     <ERR> <Code> <Command length> <Command in error>\n<Code>\
    \ is an eight-bit field that specifies the error type.  The\nassigned codes are\
    \ shown below.  <Command length> is a 16-bit integer\nthat indicates the length\
    \ of the <Command in error> in bits.  The\n<Command in error> is the spurious\
    \ command.\nThe ranges of <Code> are shown below in hexidecimal.\n     00    \
    \ Unspecified error types\n     10-0F  Resource errors\n     10-1F  Status errors\n\
    \     20-2F  Content errors\n     30-3F  Unused\nSpecific values of <Code> are\
    \ shown below with their meaning.\n     <Code> value   Semantics\n         00\
    \         Unspecified errors.\n         01         Request for an invalid resource.\n\
    \         02         Request for an exhausted resource, try later.\n        03-0F\
    \       Unused.\n         10         Invalid <RSM>, i.e., link connected but unblocked.\n\
    \         11         Invalid <SPD>.\n         12         Invalid <ASG>, i.e.,\
    \ connected but no <RDY>\n                      received.\n         13       \
    \  Message received on blocked link.\n        14-1F       Unused.\n         20\
    \         Unknown command code.\n         21         Message received on unconnected\
    \ link.\n         22         Invalid <RFC>.\n         23         Invalid <CLS>.\n\
    \         24         Invalid <RSM>, i.e., link not connected.\n         25   \
    \      Invalid <FND>.\n         26         Invalid <END>.\n         27       \
    \  Invalid <RDY>.\n         28         Invalid <ASG>, i.e., not connected.\n \
    \       29-2F       Unused.\n        30-FF       Unused.\nQUERIES\n     <QRY>\
    \ <My Socket>\nor   <RPY> <Your Socket> <Text>\nThe <QRY> is the query indicated\
    \ in NWG/RFC #39 and <RPY> is the reply.\nThe format of <Text> is shown below;\
    \ also refer to NWG/RFC #36, p. 3.\n<Text>::= <16 bit count of relevant connection\
    \ table entries>\n          <relevant connection table entries>\n<relevant connection\
    \ table entries>::=\n                                     <relevant connection\

    \ table entry>\n                                     <a relevant connection table\
    \ entry>\n<a relevant connection table entry>::= <local socket> <foreign socket>\n\
    \                                       <link> <connection state>\n          \
    \                             <flow state and buffer control>\n              \
    \                         <reconnection control state>\n     <NOP>\nAn NCP may\
    \ be up, down, pending, etc.  When an NCP changes its\nstate to UP it should send\
    \ a <NOP> to each remote NCP which\nindicates the NCP is available.  The sending\
    \ NCP can then\nconstruct a vector of HOST status from the RFNMs it receives.\
    \  An\nNCP receiving a <NOP> can update the availability of the sending\nNCP in\
    \ its HOST status vector.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Richard Ames 6/97 ]\n"
