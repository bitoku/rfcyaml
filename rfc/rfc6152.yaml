  - "1.  Introduction\n   Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, various extensions\n
    \  have been requested by parts of the Internet community.  In\n   particular,
    a significant portion of the Internet community wishes to\n   exchange messages
    in which the content body consists of a MIME\n   message [RFC2045][RFC2046][RFC5322]
    containing arbitrary octet-\n   aligned material.  This memo uses the mechanism
    described in the SMTP\n   specification [RFC5321] to define an extension to the
    SMTP service\n   whereby such contents may be exchanged.  Note that this extension\n
    \  does NOT eliminate the possibility of an SMTP server limiting line\n   length;
    servers are free to implement this extension but nevertheless\n   set a line length
    limit no lower than 1000 octets.  Given that this\n   restriction still applies,
    this extension does NOT provide a means\n   for transferring unencoded binary
    via SMTP.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Framework for the 8-bit MIME Transport Extension\n   The 8-bit MIME transport
    extension is laid out as follows:\n   1.  the name of the SMTP service extension
    defined here is\n       8bit-MIMEtransport;\n   2.  the EHLO keyword value associated
    with the extension is 8BITMIME;\n   3.  no parameter is used with the 8BITMIME
    EHLO keyword;\n   4.  one optional parameter using the keyword BODY is added to
    the\n       MAIL command.  The value associated with this parameter is a\n       keyword
    indicating whether a 7-bit message (in strict compliance\n       with [RFC5321])
    or a MIME message (in strict compliance with\n       [RFC2046] and [RFC2045])
    with arbitrary octet content is being\n       sent.  The syntax of the value is
    as follows, using the ABNF\n       notation of [RFC5234]:\n       body-value =
    \"7BIT\" / \"8BITMIME\"\n   5.  no additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension;
    and\n   6.  the next section specifies how support for the extension affects\n
    \      the behavior of a server and client SMTP.\n"
  title: 2.  Framework for the 8-bit MIME Transport Extension
- contents:
  - "3.  The 8bit-MIMEtransport Service Extension\n   When a client SMTP wishes to
    submit (using the MAIL command) a\n   content body consisting of a MIME message
    containing arbitrary lines\n   of octet-aligned material, it first issues the
    EHLO command to the\n   server SMTP.  If the server SMTP responds with code 250
    to the EHLO\n   command, and the response includes the EHLO keyword value 8BITMIME,\n
    \  then the server SMTP is indicating that it supports the extended MAIL\n   command
    and will accept MIME messages containing arbitrary octet-\n   aligned material.\n
    \  The extended MAIL command is issued by a client SMTP when it wishes\n   to
    transmit a content body consisting of a MIME message containing\n   arbitrary
    lines of octet-aligned material.  The syntax for this\n   command is identical
    to the MAIL command in RFC 5321, except that a\n   BODY parameter must appear
    after the address.  Only one BODY\n   parameter may be used in a single MAIL command.\n
    \  The complete syntax of this extended command is defined in RFC 5321.\n   The
    esmtp-keyword is BODY, and the syntax for esmtp-value is given by\n   the syntax
    for body-value shown above.\n   The value associated with the BODY parameter indicates
    whether the\n   content body that will be passed using the DATA command consists
    of a\n   MIME message containing some arbitrary octet-aligned material\n   (\"8BITMIME\")
    or is encoded entirely in accordance with RFC 5321\n   (\"7BIT\").\n   A server
    that supports the 8-bit MIME transport service extension\n   shall preserve all
    bits in each octet passed using the DATA command.\n   Naturally, the usual SMTP
    data-stuffing algorithm applies, so that a\n   content that contains the five-character
    sequence of\n   <CR> <LF> <DOT> <CR> <LF>\n   or a content that begins with the
    three-character sequence of\n   <DOT> <CR> <LF>\n   does not prematurely terminate
    the transfer of the content.  Further,\n   it should be noted that the CR-LF pair
    immediately preceding the\n   final dot is considered part of the content.  Finally,
    although the\n   content body contains arbitrary lines of octet-aligned material,
    the\n   length of each line (number of octets between two CR-LF pairs) is\n   still
    subject to SMTP server line length restrictions (which can\n   allow as few as
    1000 octets, inclusive of the CR-LF pair, on a single\n   line).  This restriction
    means that this extension provides the\n   necessary facilities for transferring
    a MIME object with the 8BIT\n   content-transfer-encoding, it DOES NOT provide
    a means of\n   transferring an object with the BINARY content-transfer-encoding.\n
    \  Once a server SMTP supporting the 8bit-MIMEtransport service\n   extension
    accepts a content body containing octets with the high-\n   order (8th) bit set,
    the server SMTP must deliver or relay the\n   content in such a way as to preserve
    all bits in each octet.\n   If a server SMTP does not support the 8-bit MIME transport
    extension\n   (either by not responding with code 250 to the EHLO command, or
    by\n   not including the EHLO keyword value 8BITMIME in its response), then\n
    \  the client SMTP must not, under any circumstances, attempt to\n   transfer
    a content that contains characters outside of the US-ASCII\n   octet range (hex
    00-7F).\n   A client SMTP has two options in this case: first, it may implement
    a\n   gateway transformation to convert the message into valid 7-bit MIME,\n   or
    second, it may treat the barrier to 8-bit as a permanent error and\n   handle
    it in the usual manner for delivery failures.  The specifics\n   of the transformation
    from 8-bit MIME to 7-bit MIME are not described\n   by this RFC; the conversion
    is nevertheless constrained in the\n   following ways:\n   1.  it must cause no
    loss of information; MIME transport encodings\n       must be employed as needed
    to insure this is the case, and\n   2.  the resulting message must be valid 7-bit
    MIME.\n"

    Sender and 8BITMIME ok\n   C: RCPT TO:<mrose@dbc.mtview.ca.us>\n   S: 250 <mrose@dbc.mtview.ca.us>...

    is not believed to\n   raise any security issues not already endemic in electronic
    mail and\n   present in fully conforming implementations of RFC 5321, including\n
    \  attacks facilitated by the presence of an option negotiation\n   mechanism.
    \ Since MIME semantics are transport-neutral, the 8BITMIME\n   option provides
    no more added capability to disseminate malware than\n   is provided by unextended
    7-bit SMTP.\n"
