    \ OF THE NEW IMP SYSTEM (2600)\n        We have still not managed to get the new\
    \ IMP system up.\n     To recapitulate:\n     We tried the first time May 15;\
    \ but, completely under- estimating\nthe difficulty of distributing the new system\
    \ to over twenty-five\nsites, we never even got around to debugging the system.\n\
    \     We developed a suitable distribution mechanism and tried again\nMay 31.\
    \  This time we got to debug the new IMP system and found a\nnumber of problems\
    \ which precluded leaving the new system up.\n     Trying again June 6, we got\
    \ the new IMP system up and working\nquite well, but the version of the TIP system\
    \ which runs with the new\nIMP system wouldn't work hardly at all.  So we put\
    \ the old systems\nback up again.\n     The day before yesterday, June 20, we\
    \ tried again.  The IMPs and\nTIPs loaded and seemed to fly quite well, so we\
    \ left the new systems\nup.  But by yesterday, June 21, afternoon, with crashes\
    \ happening in\nTIPs at the rate of about one per hour, we backed off again and\
    \ put\nthe old systems back up.  (One TIP crash per hour in the network means\n\
    there is about one crash every eight or ten hours debugging with one\nTIP which\
    \ makes it nasty to debug.)\n     We plan to skip Tuesday, June 27, and Tuesday,\
    \ July 4, and to try\nagain Thursday, July 6 (1972), and if necessary, again on\
    \ Tuesday,\nJuly 18, and following Tuesdays, as per RFC #343.\nDCW/jm\n      \
