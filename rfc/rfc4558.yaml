- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RSVP Hello message exchange was introduced in [RFC3209].\
    \  The\n   usage of RSVP Hello has been extended in [RFC3473] to support RSVP\n\
    \   Graceful Restart (GR) procedures.\n   More specifically, [RFC3473] specifies\
    \ the use of the RSVP Hello\n   messages for GR procedures for Generalized MPLS\
    \ (GMPLS).  GMPLS\n   introduces the notion of control plane and data plane separation.\
    \  In\n   other words, in GMPLS networks, the control plane information is\n \
    \  carried over a control network whose end-points are IP capable and\n   that\
    \ may be physically or logically disjoint from the data bearer\n   links it controls.\
    \  One of the consequences of separation of data\n   bearer links from control\
    \ channels is that RSVP Hello messages are\n   not terminated on data bearer links'\
    \ interfaces even if (some of)\n   those are numbered.  Instead, RSVP Hello messages\
    \ are terminated at\n   the control channel (IP-capable) end-points.  The latter\
    \ MAY be\n   identified by the value assigned to the node hosting these control\n\
    \   channels, i.e., Node-ID.  Consequently, the use of RSVP Hello\n   messages\
    \ for GR applications introduces a need for clarifying the\n   behavior and usage\
    \ of Node-ID based Hello sessions.\n   Even in the case of packet switching capable\
    \ interfaces, when link\n   failure detection is performed by some means other\
    \ than RSVP Hello\n   messages (e.g., [BFD]), the use of Node-ID based Hello sessions\
    \ is\n   also optimal for detection of signaling adjacency failures for\n   GMPLS-RSVP-TE\
    \ and RSVP-TE when there is more than one link between a\n   pair of nodes.  Similarly,\
    \ when all TE links between neighbor nodes\n   are unnumbered, it is implied that\
    \ the nodes will exchange Node-ID\n   based Hello messages for detection of signaling\
    \ adjacency failures.\n   This document also clarifies the use of Node-ID based\
    \ Hello message\n   exchanges when all or a sub-set of TE links are unnumbered.\n"

- title: 3.  Node-ID Based RSVP Hello Messages
  contents:
  - "3.  Node-ID Based RSVP Hello Messages\n   A Node-ID based Hello session is established\
    \ through the exchange of\n   RSVP Hello messages such that local and remote Node-IDs\
    \ are\n   respectively used in the source and destination fields of Hello\n  \
    \ packets.  Here, for IPv4, Node-ID refers to the TE router-id as\n   defined\
    \ in the Router Address TLV for OSPF [OSPF-TE] and the Traffic\n   Engineering\
    \ router ID TLV for ISIS [ISIS-TE].  For IPv6, the Node-ID\n   refers to the Router_IPv6_Address\
    \ for OSPFv3 [OSPFv3-TE] and the IPv6\n   TE Router_ID for IS-IS [IS-ISv6-TE].\
    \  This section formalizes a\n   procedure for establishing Node-ID based Hello\
    \ sessions.\n   If a node wishes to establish a Node-ID based RSVP Hello session\
    \ with\n   its neighbor, it sends a Hello message with its Node-ID in the source\n\
    \   IP address field of the Hello packet.  Furthermore, the node also\n   puts\
    \ the neighbor's Node-ID in the destination address field of the\n   IP packet.\n\
    \   When a node receives a Hello packet where the destination IP address\n   is\
    \ its local Node-ID as advertised in the IGP-TE topology, the node\n   MUST use\
    \ its Node-ID in replying to the Hello message.  In other\n   words, nodes MUST\
    \ ensure that the Node-IDs used in RSVP Hello\n   messages are those derived/contained\
    \ in the IGP-TE topology.\n   Furthermore, a node can only run one Node-ID based\
    \ RSVP Hello session\n   per IGP instance (i.e., per Node-ID pair) with its neighbor.\n\
    \   Even in the case of packet switching capable interfaces, when link\n   failure\
    \ detection is performed by some means other than exchanging\n   RSVP Hello messages,\
    \ use of Node-ID based Hello sessions is also\n   optimal in detecting signaling\
    \ adjacency failures for GMPLS-RSVP-TE\n   and RSVP-TE when there is more than\
    \ one link between a pair of nodes.\n   Similarly, if all interfaces between a\
    \ pair of nodes are unnumbered,\n   the optimal way to use RSVP to detect signaling\
    \ adjacency failure is\n   to run Node-ID based Hello sessions.  Furthermore,\
    \ in the case of an\n   optical network with single or multiple numbered or unnumbered\n\
    \   control channels, use of Node-ID based Hello messages for detecting\n   signaling\
    \ adjacency failure is also optimal.  Therefore, when link\n   failure detection\
    \ is performed by some means other than exchanging\n   RSVP Hello messages, or\
    \ if all interfaces between a pair of nodes are\n   unnumbered, or in a GMPLS\
    \ network with data and control plane\n   separation, a node MUST run Node-ID\
    \ based Hello sessions for\n   detection of signaling adjacency failure for RSVP-TE.\
    \  Nonetheless,\n   if it is desirable to distinguish between signaling adjacency\
    \ and\n   link failures, Node-ID based Hello sessions can co-exist with the\n\
    \   exchange of interface bound Hellos messages.  Similarly, if a pair of\n  \
    \ nodes share numbered and unnumbered TE links, Node-ID and interface\n   based\
    \ Hello sessions can co-exist.\n"
- title: 4.  Backward Compatibility Note
  contents:
  - "4.  Backward Compatibility Note\n   The procedure presented in this document\
    \ is backward compatible with\n   both [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].\n   Per [RFC3209],\
    \ the Hello mechanism is intended for use between\n   immediate neighbors, and\
    \ Hello messages are by default sent between\n   direct RSVP neighbors.  This\
    \ document does not modify this behavior,\n   as it uses as \"local node_id\"\
    \ the IPv4/IPv6 source address of the\n   sending node and as \"remote node_id\"\
    \ the IPv4/IPv6 destination\n   address of the neighbor node.  TTL/Hop Limit setting\
    \ and processing\n   are also left unchanged.\n   Moreover, this document does\
    \ not modify the use of Hello Processing\n   for State Recovery as defined in\
    \ Section 9.3 of [RFC3473] (including\n   definition and processing of the RESTART_CAP\
    \ object).\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As this document does not modify or extend the\
    \ RSVP Hello messages\n   exchange between immediate RSVP neighbors, it does not\
    \ introduce new\n   security considerations.\n   The security considerations pertaining\
    \ to the original [RFC3209]\n   remain relevant.  RSVP message security is described\
    \ in [RFC2747] and\n   provides Hello message integrity and authentication of\
    \ the Node-ID\n   ownership.\n"
