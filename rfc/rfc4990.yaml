- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   As described in [RFC3945], the components of a GMPLS network\
    \ may be\n   separated into a data plane and a control plane.  The control plane\n\
    \   may be further split into signaling components and routing\n   components.\n\
    \   A data plane switch or router is called a data plane entity.  It is a\n  \
    \ node on the data plane topology graph.  A data plane resource is a\n   facility\
    \ available in the data plane, such as a data plane entity\n   (node), data link\
    \ (edge), or data label (such as a lambda).\n   In the control plane, there are\
    \ protocol speakers that are software\n   implementations that communicate using\
    \ signaling or routing\n   protocols.  These are control plane entities, and may\
    \ be physically\n   located separately from the data plane entities that they\
    \ control.\n   Further, there may be separate routing entities and signaling\n\
    \   entities.\n   GMPLS supports a control plane entity that is responsible for\
    \ one or\n   more data plane entities, and supports the separation of signaling\n\
    \   and routing control plane entities.  For the purposes of this\n   document,\
    \ it is assumed that there is a one-to-one correspondence\n   between control\
    \ plane and data plane entities.  That is, each data\n   plane switch has a unique\
    \ control plane entity responsible for\n   participating in the GMPLS signaling\
    \ and routing protocols, and that\n   each such control plane presence is responsible\
    \ for a single data\n   plane switch.\n   The combination of control plane and\
    \ data plane entities is referred\n   to as a Label Switching Router (LSR).\n\
    \   Note that the term 'Router ID' is used in two contexts within GMPLS.\n   It\
    \ may refer to an identifier of a participant in a routing protocol,\n   or it\
    \ may be an identifier for an LSR that participates in TE\n   routing.  These\
    \ could be considered as the control plane and data\n   plane contexts.\n   In\
    \ this document, the contexts are distinguished by the following\n   definitions.\n\
    \   o  Loopback address: A loopback address is a stable IP address of the\n  \
    \    advertising router that is always reachable if there is any IP\n      connectivity\
    \ to it [RFC3477], [RFC3630].  Thus, for example, an\n      IPv4 127/24 address\
    \ is excluded from this definition.\n   o  TE Router ID: A stable IP address of\
    \ an LSR that is always\n      reachable in the control plane if there is any\
    \ IP connectivity to\n      the LSR, e.g., a loopback address.  The most important\
    \ requirement\n      is that the address does not become unusable if an interface\
    \ on\n      the LSR is down [RFC3477], [RFC3630].\n   o  Router ID: The OSPF protocol\
    \ version 2 [RFC2328] defines the\n      Router ID to be a 32-bit network-unique\
    \ number assigned to each\n      router running OSPF.  IS-IS [RFC1195] includes\
    \ a similar concept\n      in the System ID.  This document describes both concepts\
    \ as the\n      \"Router ID\" of the router running the routing protocol.  The\n\
    \      Router ID is not required to be a reachable IP address, although\n    \
    \  an operator may set it to a reachable IP address on the same node.\n   o  TE\
    \ link: \"A TE link is a representation in the IS-IS/OSPF Link\n      State advertisements\
    \ and in the link state database of certain\n      physical resources, and their\
    \ properties, between two GMPLS nodes\"\n      [RFC3945].\n   o  Data plane node:\
    \ A vertex on the TE graph.  It is a data plane\n      switch or router.  Data\
    \ plane nodes are connected by TE links that\n      are constructed from physical\
    \ data links.  A data plane node is\n      controlled through some combination\
    \ of management and control\n      plane actions.  A data plane node may be under\
    \ full or partial\n      control of a control plane node.\n   o  Control plane\
    \ node: A GMPLS protocol speaker.  It may be part of a\n      data plane switch\
    \ or may be a separate computer.  Control plane\n      nodes are connected by\
    \ control channels that are logical\n      connection-less or connection-oriented\
    \ paths in the control plane.\n      A control plane node is responsible for controlling\
    \ zero, one, or\n      more data plane nodes.\n   o  Interface ID: The Interface\
    \ ID is defined in [RFC3477] and in\n      Section 9.1 of [RFC3471].\n   o  Data\
    \ Plane Address: This document refers to a data plane address\n      in the context\
    \ of GMPLS.  It does not refer to addresses such as\n      E.164 SAPI in Synchronous\
    \ Digital Hierarchy (SDH).\n   o  Control Plane Address: An address used to identify\
    \ a control plane\n      resource including, and restricted to, control plane\
    \ nodes and\n      control channels.\n   o  IP Time to Live (TTL): The IPv4 TTL\
    \ field or the IPv6 Hop Limit\n      field, whichever is applicable.\n   o  TED:\
    \ Traffic Engineering Database.\n   o  LSR: Label Switching Router.\n   o  FA:\
    \ Forwarding Adjacency.\n   o  IGP: Interior Gateway Protocol.\n"
- title: 3.  Support of Numbered and Unnumbered Links
  contents:
  - "3.  Support of Numbered and Unnumbered Links\n   The links in the control and\
    \ data planes may be numbered or\n   unnumbered [RFC3945].  That is, their end\
    \ points may be assigned IP\n   addresses, or may be assigned link IDs specific\
    \ to the control plane\n   or data plane entity at the end of the link.  Implementations\
    \ may\n   decide to support numbered and/or unnumbered addressing.\n   The argument\
    \ for numbered addressing is that it simplifies\n   troubleshooting.  The argument\
    \ for unnumbered addressing is to save\n   on IP address resources.\n   An LSR\
    \ may choose to only support its own links being configured as\n   numbered, or\
    \ may only support its own links being configured as\n   unnumbered.  But an LSR\
    \ must not restrict the choice of other LSRs to\n   use numbered or unnumbered\
    \ links since this might lead to\n   interoperablity issues.  Thus, a node should\
    \ be able to accept and\n   process link advertisements containing both numbered\
    \ and unnumbered\n   addresses.\n   Numbered and unnumbered addressing is described\
    \ in Sections 4 and 5\n   of this document, respectively.\n"

    \ defined\n   in [RFC3630], [RFC3784], [RFC4202], [RFC4203], and [RFC4205].\n"

    \ header.  Note that an IP\n   hop must not decrement the TTL of the received\
