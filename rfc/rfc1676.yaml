- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This white paper is sent by INFN network team, the Italian National\n\
    \   Institute for nuclear physics, whose network, named INFNet, is a\n   nationwide\
    \ network founded to provide the access to existing national\n   and international\
    \ HEP laboratory and to facilitate communications\n   between the researchers.\
    \  With this paper we would like to emphasize\n   the key points that we would\
    \ to consider if charged with IPng plan.\n   We do not really expect to add original\
    \ items to the selection, but\n   we think that it could be useful to submit the\
    \ opinions and ideas\n   that come from our network experience.\n"
- title: 1. General Requirements
  contents:
  - "1. General Requirements\n   The problems that are to be solved in IP internet\
    \ are mainly three:\n      1. address exhaustion\n      2. flat address space\n\
    \      3. routing efficiency, flexibility and capacity.\n   The aim of IPng study\
    \ should be to define a plan that solves all\n   these problems as a whole and\
    \ not each of them separately.\n   The general requirements that we underline\
    \ for this transition are:\n      - transparency to the final user: user applications\
    \ should not be\n        influenced.\n      - flexibility: Simplify the suitability\
    \ to new communication\n        technology and to topology changes due to new\
    \ services provided\n        or to different users needs.\n"
- title: 2. Application and Transport Level
  contents:
  - "2. Application and Transport Level\n   Starting from the top of the OSI model,\
    \ we think that the users\n   applications should not be influenced by the migration\
    \ plan.  It\n   means that the TCP (the transport layer) must maintain the same\n\
    \   interfaces and services to the upper layers.  Anyway, it is also\n   necessary\
    \ to foresee the use of a different transport services. The\n   possibility to\
    \ use different transport should be offered to the\n   applications.  Therefore\
    \ a transport selector field is needed.\n"
- title: '3. Network layer: service and address'
  contents:
  - "3. Network layer: service and address\n   We assume that the network layer must\
    \ continue to provide the same\n   datagram service as IP does.  CLNS could be\
    \ a solution and a reliable\n   starting point for the IPng.  The main advantage\
    \ is that this\n   solution has been profitable tested and it is already available\
    \ on\n   many systems.  It is not, of course, deployed as widely as IPv4 is,\n\
    \   since it is a newer technology, but it is widely configured and and\n   there\
    \ is already operational experience.  The corresponding address,\n   the NSAP,\
    \ is 20 bytes long.  It is long enough to scale the future\n   data network environment.\
    \  Its hierarchical format can be organized\n   in a really flexible way, satisfying\
    \ hierarchical routing and policy\n   based routing needs and simplifying the\
    \ distributed administration\n   and management.  A lot of work has been already\
    \ done in the majority\n   of the countries in order to define NSAP formats satisfying\
    \ both the\n   requirements of administrative delegation and routing performances.\n"
- title: 4. Routing protocols
  contents:
  - "4. Routing protocols\n   We don't consider the decision about the routing protocol\
    \ to be\n   adopted for the IPng to be fundamental.  Even if this choice is very\n\
    \   important to obtain good performances, the routing protocols can be\n   changed\
    \ or improved at any time, because there is no influence into\n   the End Systems\
    \ configuration.  Relationships between NSAP\n   aggregation, hierarchical topology\
    \ and hierarchical routing algorithm\n   must be taken into account in IPng plan.\
    \  These issues could improve\n   administration and topological flexibility of\
    \ the IPng and solve the\n   flat problem of the IPv4.  The IPng routing protocols\
    \ should include\n   policy-based features.  The IPv4 network topology is very\
    \ complex and\n   it will continue to enlarge during the transition. It would\
    \ be very\n   difficult or impossible to manage it without the \"policy\" tools.\
    \  The\n   multicast capability as well as any other new features that fit in\
    \ a\n   datagram network should be supported.  Regarding the Source Routing\n\
    \   feature, since we think that it deeply modifies the aim and the\n   \"philosophy\"\
    \ of a connectionless network and it also introduces an\n   heavy complication\
    \ in the end nodes and routers software, we don't\n   consider it a major issue.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. Layer 2 or communication infrastructure media support.\n   This is an open\
    \ field, rapidly changing, then it must be left open to\n   any evolution. What\
    \ it should be recommended is to be compatible with\n   the above network layer.\n"
- title: 6. Transition and Deployment
  contents:
  - "6. Transition and Deployment\n   We faced the problem of the transition of the\
    \ DECNET global network\n   to DECNET/OSI over CLNS. This activity is now proceeding\
    \ to the last\n   step and based on this experience we would underline some points\
    \ that\n   we found important during the transition deployment.  The transitions\n\
    \   must be planned and developed in a distributed way.  This means that\n   every\
    \ organization should have the possibility to plan and start\n   their network\
    \ migration without loosing connectivity with the\n   existing global internet.\
    \  Of course, the compatibility with the IPv4\n   world must be maintained, this\
    \ mean that a new generation system must\n   interwork with both the IPv4 and\
    \ IPng nodes, using the same\n   applications.\n   However, it is important to\
    \ define a deadline for the backward\n   compatibility in order to avoid huge\
    \ software maintenance in the user\n   systems and a \"multi-topology\" management.\
    \  We think that a dual\n   stack approach could simplify very much the transition,\
    \ whereas a\n   translation mechanism would need a widely and deep coordination\
    \ in\n   order to maintain the global connectivity during the transition\n   period.\
    \  The dual stack is simpler and could be easily developed, but\n   it is important\
    \ to push in order to have pure IPng with global\n   connectivity as soon as possible;\
    \ this could happen when there are no\n   more \"IPv4 only\" hosts.\n   Indeed,\
    \ the drawback of the dual stack configuration is that you\n   continue to suffer\
    \ for the IPv4 address space exhaustion and that you\n   must continue to support\
    \ the IPv4 routing protocols and\n   infrastructure.  We don't think that the\
    \ tunnel solution to\n   interconnect the IPv4 isle could give good performances\
    \ to the users.\n   Then, it is important to maintain the IPv4 connectivity and\
    \ the dual\n   stack software support in the End System software in a determined\n\
    \   timeframe, or the transition will never end.\n"
