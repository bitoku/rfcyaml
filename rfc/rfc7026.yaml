- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization\
    \ of\n   the applicability of the pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header\n\
    \   (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be\n   carried\
    \ in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between\n   the fixed header\
    \ fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called\n   ACH TLVs\n   No Associated\
    \ Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,\n   it is believed that\
    \ handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant\n   problems to the fast path,\
    \ and since G-ACh messages are intended to\n   be processed substantially in hardware,\
    \ the use of ACH TLVs is\n   undesirable.\n   This document updates RFC 5586 by\
    \ retiring ACH TLVs and removing the\n   associated registry.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction and Scope
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   RFC 4385 [RFC4385] says that if the first nibble\
    \ of a PW packet\n   carried over an MPLS network has a value of 1, then the packet\
    \ starts\n   with a specific header format called the Pseudowire Associated\n\
    \   Channel Header (PWACH) or more generally known as the ACH.  This\n   mechanism\
    \ creates an Associated Channel that is a message channel\n   associated with\
    \ a specific pseudowire (PW).\n   The applicability of the ACH is generalized\
    \ in RFC 5586 [RFC5586] to\n   define the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).\
    \  This creates a\n   common encapsulation header for control channel messages\
    \ associated\n   with MPLS Sections, Label Switching Paths (LSPs), and PWs.\n\
    \   As part of making the ACH fully generic, RFC 5586 defines ACH TLV\n   constructs.\
    \  According to RFC 5586:\n     In some applications of the generalized associated\
    \ control channel,\n     it is necessary to include one or more ACH TLVs to provide\n\
    \     additional context information to the G-ACh packet.\n   RFC 5586 goes on\
    \ to say:\n     If the G-ACh message MAY be preceded by one or more ACH TLVs,\
    \ then\n     this MUST be explicitly specified in the definition of an ACH\n \
    \    Channel Type.\n   However, at the time of writing, of the 18 ACH Channel\
    \ Types defined,\n   none allows the use of ACH TLVs [IANA-ACH].  At the time\
    \ of writing,\n   there are no unexpired Internet-Drafts that utilize ACH TLVs.\n\
    \   Furthermore, G-ACh packets are intended to be substantially processed\n  \
    \ in hardware; however, processing TLVs in hardware can be difficult\n   because\
    \ of the unpredictable formats and lengths that they introduce\n   to the normal\
    \ ACH format.\n   This document states that ACH TLVs, as specified in RFC 5586,\
    \ are not\n   useful and might be harmful.  It updates RFC 5586 by deprecating\
    \ the\n   ACH TLV and updating the associated IANA registries as described in\n\
    \   Section 4 of this document.  This document makes no comment about the\n  \
    \ use of TLVs in other places.  In particular, proposals to use TLVs\n   within\
    \ ACH messages or as an appendage to ACH messages, are not in\n   scope of this\
    \ document.\n"

- title: 5.  Manageability Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Manageability Considerations\n     This document will have no impact on network\
    \ or device\n     manageability because there are no ACH Types that allow the\
    \ use of\n     TLVs.  The document removes a feature that might have been used\
    \ to\n     enhance management messages, and especially Operations, Management,\n\
    \     and Administration (OAM) messages.  However, given the considerable\n  \
    \   experience in defining MPLS OAM messages in the last few years, it\n     would\
    \ appear that this feature is not useful.\n     It is possible that packet sniffers\
    \ that have already been\n     implemented will look for ACH TLVs.  The deletion\
    \ of the construct\n     will not have a negative impact.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n     Deleting the ACH TLV has a marginal positive\
    \ effect on security\n     because it removes a feature that might have been used\
    \ as an attack\n     vector to carry false information or to bloat G-ACh messages.\n\
    \     On the other hand, it had been suggested that the ACH TLV could\n     have\
    \ been used to carry security parameters to secure the messages\n     on the G-ACh\
    \ in a generic way.  However, no mechanisms have been\n     proposed at the time\
    \ of writing, and it has generally been\n     considered that it is the responsibility\
    \ of the specification that\n     defines G-ACh messages to consider the security\
    \ requirements of\n     those messages that may be different for the different\n\
    \     applications.\n     Otherwise, this document has no implications for security.\n"
