  - "Abstract\n   L2TP protocol is a virtual extension of PPP across IP network\n\
    \   infrastructure. L2TP makes possible for an access concentrator (LAC)\n   to\
    \ be near remote clients, while allowing PPP termination server\n   (LNS) to be\
    \ located in enterprise premises. L2TP allows an enterprise\n   to retain control\
    \ of RADIUS data base, which is used to control\n   Authentication, Authorization\
    \ and Accountability (AAA) of dial-in\n   users. The objective of this document\
    \ is to extend security\n   characteristics of IPsec to remote access users, as\
    \ they dial-in\n   through the Internet. This is accomplished without creating\
    \ new\n   protocols and using the existing practices of Remote Access and\n  \
    \ IPsec. Specifically, the document proposes three new RADIUS\n   parameters for\
    \ use by the LNS node, acting as Secure Remote Access\n   Server (SRAS) to mandate\
    \ network level security between remote\n   clients and the enterprise. The document\
    \ also discusses limitations\n   of the approach.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction and Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction and Overview\n   Now-a-days, it is common practice for employees\
    \ to dial-in to their\n   enterprise over the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone\
    \ Network) and\n   perform day-to-day operations just as they would if they were\
    \ in\n   corporate premises. This includes people who dial-in from their home\n\
    \   and road warriors, who cannot be at the corporate premises. As the\n   Internet\
    \ has become ubiquitous, it is appealing to dial-in through\n   the Internet to\
    \ save on phone charges and save the dedicated voice\n   lines from being clogged\
    \ with data traffic.\n   The document suggests an approach by which remote access\
    \ over the\n   Internet could become a reality. The approach is founded on the\n\
    \   well-known techniques and protocols already in place. Remote Access\n   extensions\
    \ based on L2TP, when combined with the security offered by\n   IPSec can make\
    \ remote access over the Internet a reality. The\n   approach does not require\
    \ inventing new protocol(s).\n   The trust model of remote access discussed in\
    \ this document is viewed\n   principally from the perspective of an enterprise\
    \ into which remote\n   access clients dial-in. A remote access client may or\
    \ may not want to\n   enforce end-to-end IPsec from his/her end to the enterprise.\n\
    \   However, it is in the interest of the enterprise to mandate security\n   of\
    \ every packet that it accepts from the Internet into the\n   enterprise.  Independently,\
    \ remote users may also pursue end-to-end\n   IPsec, if they choose to do so.\
    \ That would be in addition to the\n   security requirement imposed by the enterprise\
    \ edge device.\n   Section 2 has reference to the terminology used throughout\
    \ the\n   document. Also mentioned are the limited scope in which some of these\n\
    \   terms may be used in this document. Section 3 has a brief description\n  \
    \ of what constitutes remote access. Section 4 describes what\n   constitutes\
    \ network security from an enterprise perspective.  Section\n   5 describes the\
    \ model of secure remote access as a viable solution to\n   enterprises. The solution\
    \ presented in section 5 has some\n   limitations. These limitations are listed\
    \ in section 6.  Section 7 is\n   devoted to describing new RADIUS attributes\
    \ that may be configured to\n   turn a NAS device into Secure Remote Access Server.\n"
- title: 2. Terminology and scope
  contents:
  - "2. Terminology and scope\n   Definition of terms used in this document may be\
    \ found in one of (a)\n   L2TP Protocol document [Ref 1], (b) IP security Architecture\
    \ document\n   [Ref 5], or (c) Internet Key Exchange (IKE) document [Ref 8].\n\
    \   Note, the terms Network Access Server (NAS) and  Remote Access\n   Server(RAS)\
    \ are used interchangeably throughout the document.  While\n   PPP may be used\
    \ to carry a variety of network layer packets, the\n   focus of this document\
    \ is limited to carrying IP datagrams only.\n   \"Secure Remote Access Server\"\
    \ (SRAS) defined in this document refers\n   to a NAS that supports tunnel-mode\
    \ IPsec with its remote clients.\n   Specifically, LNS is the NAS that is referred.\
    \ Further, involuntary\n   tunneling is assumed for L2TP tunnel setup, in that\
    \ remote clients\n   initiating PPP session and the LAC that tunnels the PPP sessions\
    \ are\n   presumed to be distinct physical entities.\n   Lastly, there are a variety\
    \ of transport mediums by which to tunnel\n   PPP packets between a LAC and LNS.\
    \ Examples include Frame Relay or\n   ATM cloud and IP network infrastructure.\
    \ For simplicity, the document\n   assumes a public IP infrastructure as the medium\
    \ to transport PPP\n   packets between LAC and LNS. Security of IP packets (embedded\
    \ within\n   PPP) in a trusted private transport medium is less of a concern for\n\
    \   the purposes of this document.\n"
- title: 3. Remote Access operation
  contents:
  - "3. Remote Access operation\n   Remote access is more than mere authentication\
    \ of remote clients by a\n   Network Access Server(NAS). Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ Accounting\n   and routing are integral to remote access. A client must first\
    \ pass\n   the authentication test before being granted link access to the\n \
    \  network. Network level services (such as IP) are granted based on the\n   authorization\
    \ characteristics specified for the user in RADIUS.\n   Network Access Servers\
    \ use RADIUS to scale for large numbers of users\n   supported. NAS also monitors\
    \ the link status of the remote access\n   clients.\n   There are a variety of\
    \ techniques by which remote access users are\n   connected to their enterprise\
    \ and the Internet. At a link level, the\n   access techniques include ISDN digital\
    \ lines, analog plain-old-\n   telephone-service lines, xDSL lines, cable and\
    \ wireless to name a\n   few. PPP is the most common Layer-2 (L2)protocol used\
    \ for carrying\n   network layer packets over these remote access links. PPP may\
    \ be used\n   to carry a variety of network layer datagrams including IP, IPX\
    \ and\n   AppleTalk. The focus of this document is however limited to IP\n   datagrams\
    \ only.\n   L2TP is a logical extension of PPP over an IP infrastructure. While\
    \ a\n   LAC provides termination of Layer 2 links,  LNS provides the logical\n\
    \   termination of PPP. As a result, LNS becomes the focal point for (a)\n   performing\
    \ the AAA operations for the remote users, (b) assigning IP\n   address and monitoring\
    \ the logical link status (i.e., the status of\n   LAC-to-LNS tunnel and the link\
    \ between remote user and LAC), and (c)\n   maintaining host-route to remote user\
    \ network and providing routing\n   infrastructure into the enterprise.\n   L2TP\
    \ uses control messages to establish, terminate and monitor the\n   status of\
    \ the logical PPP sessions (from remote user to LNS). These\n   are independent\
    \ of the data messages. L2TP data messages contain an\n   L2TP header, followed\
    \ by PPP packets. The L2TP header identifies the\n   PPP session (amongst other\
    \ things) to which the PPP packet belongs.\n   The IP packets exchanged from/to\
    \ the remote user are carried within\n   the PPP packets.  The L2TP data messages,\
    \ carrying end-to-end IP\n   packets in an IP transport medium may be described\
    \ as follows. The\n   exact details of L2TP protocol may be found in [Ref 1].\n\

  - "4. Requirements of an enterprise Security Gateway\n   Today's enterprises are\
    \ aware of the various benefits of connecting\n   to the Internet. Internet is\
    \ a vast source of Information and a means\n   to disseminate information and\
    \ make available certain resources to\n   the external world. However, enterprises\
    \ are also aware that security\n   breaches (by being connected to the Internet)\
    \ can severely jeopardize\n   internal network.\n   As a result, most enterprises\
    \ restrict access to a pre-defined set of\n   resources for external users. Typically,\
    \ enterprises employ a\n   firewall to restrict access to internal resources and\
    \ place\n   externally accessible servers in the DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ), in\n\
    \   front of the firewall, as described below in Figure 1.\n                 \

    \                (_________________ )\n         Figure 1: Security model of an\
    \ Enterprise using Firewall\n   Network Access Servers used to allow direct dial-in\
    \ access (through\n   the PSTN) to employees are placed within the private enterprise\n\
    \   network so as to avoid access restrictions imposed by a firewall.\n   With\
    \ the above model, private resources of an enterprise are\n   restricted for access\
    \ from the Internet. Firewall may be configured\n   to occasionally permit access\
    \ to a certain resource or service but is\n   not recommended on an operational\
    \ basis as that could constitute a\n   security threat to the enterprise. It is\
    \ of interest to note that\n   even when the firewall is configured to permit\
    \ access to internal\n   resources from pre-defined external node(s), many internal\
    \ servers,\n   such as NFS, enforce address based authentication and do not co-\n\
    \   operate when the IP address of the external node is not in corporate\n   IP\
    \ address domain. In other words, with the above security model, it\n   becomes\
    \ very difficult to allow employees to access corporate\n   resources, via the\
    \ Internet, even if you are willing to forego\n   security over the Internet.\n\
    \   With the advent of IPsec, it is possible to secure corporate data\n   across\
    \ the Internet by employing a Security Gateway within the\n   enterprise. Firewall\
    \ may be configured to allow IKE and IPsec packets\n   directed to a specific\
    \  Security Gateway behind the firewall. It then\n   becomes the responsibility\
    \ of the Security Gateway to employ the\n   right access list for external connections\
    \ seeking entry into the\n   enterprise. Essentially, the access control functionality\
    \ for IPsec\n   secure packets would be shifted to the Security Gateway (while\
    \ the\n   access control for clear packets is retained with the firewall). The\n\
    \   following figure illustrates the model where a combination of\n   Firewall\
    \ and Security Gateway control access to internal resources.\n               \

    \                         (_________________ )\n     Figure 2: Security Model\
    \ based on Firewall and Security Gateway\n   In order to allow employee dial-in\
    \ over the Internet, an LNS may be\n   placed behind a firewall, and the firewall\
    \ may be configured to allow\n   UDP access to the LNS from the Internet. Note,\
    \ it may not be possible\n   to know all the IP addresses of the LACs located\
    \ on the Internet at\n   configuration time. Hence, the need to allow UDP access\
    \ from any node\n   on the Internet. The LNS may be configured to process only\
    \ the L2TP\n   packets and drop any UDP packets that are not L2TP.\n   Such a\
    \ configuration allows remote access over the Internet. However,\n   the above\
    \ setup is prone to a variety of security attacks over the\n   Internet. It is\
    \ easy for someone on the Internet to steal a remote\n   access session and gain\
    \  access to precious resources of the\n   enterprise. Hence it is important that\
    \ all packets are preserved with\n   IPsec to a security Gateway (SGW) behind\
    \ the LNS, so the Security\n   Gateway will not allow IP packets into corporate\
    \ network unless it\n   can authenticate the same.\n   The trust model of secure\
    \ remote access assumes that the enterprise\n   and the end user are trusted domains.\
    \ Everything in between is not\n   trusted. Any examination of the end-to-end\
    \ packets by the nodes\n   enroute would violate this trust model. From this perspective,\
    \ even\n   the LAC node enroute must not be trusted with the end-to-end IP\n \
    \  packets. Hence, location and operation of LAC is not relevant for the\n   discussion\
    \ on security. On the other hand, location and operation of\n   LNS and the Security\
    \ Gateway (SGW) are precisely the basis for\n   discussion.\n   Having security\
    \ processing done on an independent Security gateway\n   has the following shortcomings.\n\
    \   1. Given the trust model for remote access, the SGW must be\n      configured\
    \ with a set of security profiles, access control lists\n      and IKE authentication\
    \ parameters for each user. This mandates an\n      independent provisioning of\
    \ security parameters on a per-user\n      basis. This may not be able to take\
    \ advantage of the user-centric\n      provisioning on RADIUS, used by the LNS\
    \ node.\n   2. Unlike the LNS, SGW may not be in the routing path of remote\n\
    \      access packets. I.e., there is no guarantee that the egress IP\n      packets\
    \ will go through the chain of SGW and LNS before they are\n      delivered to\
    \ remote user. As a result, packets may be subject to\n      IPSec in one direction,\
    \ but not in the other. This can be a\n      significant threat to the remote\
    \ access trust model.\n   3. Lastly, the SGW node does not have a way to know\
    \ when a remote\n      user node(s) simply died or the LAC-LNS tunnel failed.\
    \ Being\n      unable to delete the SAs for users that no longer exist could\n\
    \      drain the resources of the SGW. Further, the LNS cannot even\n      communicate\
    \ the user going away to the SGW because, the SGW\n      maintains its peer nodes\
    \ based on IKE user ID, which could be\n      different the user IDs employed\
    \ by the LNS node.\n"

  - "5. Secure Remote Access\n   Combining the functions of IPsec Security Gateway\
    \ and LNS into a\n   single system promises to offer a viable solution for secure\
    \ remote\n   access. By doing this, remote access clients will use a single node\n\
    \   as both (a) PPP termination point providing NAS service, and (b) the\n   Security\
    \ gateway node into the enterprise. We will refer this node as\n   \"Secure Remote\
    \ Access Server\" (SRAS).\n   The SRAS can benefit greatly from the confluence\
    \ of PPP session and\n   IPsec tunnel end points. PPP session monitoring capability\
    \ of L2TP\n   directly translates to being able to monitor IPsec tunnels. Radius\n\
    \   based user authorization ability could be used to configure the\n   security\
    \ characteristics for IPsec tunnel. This includes setting\n   access control filters\
    \ and security preferences specific to each\n   user. This may also be extended\
    \ to configuring IKE authentication and\n   other negotiation parameters, when\
    \ automated key exchange is\n   solicited. Security attributes that may be defined\
    \ in Radius are\n   discussed in detail in section 7. Needless to say, the centralized\n\
    \   provisioning capability and scalability of Radius helps in the\n   configuration\
    \ of IPsec.\n   As for remote access, the benefit is one of IPsec security as\n\
    \   befitting the trust model solicited by enterprises for the end-to-end\n  \
    \ IP packets traversing the Internet. You may use simply AH where there\n   is\
    \ no fear of external eaves-dropping, but you simply need to\n   authenticate\
    \ packet data, including the source of packet. You may use\n   ESP (including\
    \ ESP-authentication), where there is no trust of the\n   network and you do not\
    \ want to permit eaves-dropping on corporate\n   activities.\n   Operation of\
    \ SRAS requires that the firewall be configured to permit\n   UDP traffic into\
    \ the SRAS node. The SRAS node in turn will process\n   just the L2TP packets\
    \ and drop the rest. Further, the SRAS will\n   require all IP packets embedded\
    \ within PPP to be one of AH and ESP\n   packets, directed to itself. In addition,\
    \ the SRAS will also permit\n   IKE UDP packets (with source and destination ports\
    \ sets to 500)\n   directed to itself in order to perform IKE negotiation and\
    \ generate\n   IPsec keys dynamically. All other IP packets embedded within PPP\
    \ will\n   be dropped. This enforces the security policy for the enterprise by\n\
    \   permitting only the secure remote access packets into the enterprise.\n  \
    \ When a PPP session is dropped, the IPsec and ISAKMP SAs associated\n   with\
    \ the remote access user are dropped from the SRAS. All the\n   shortcomings listed\
    \ in the previous section with LNS and SGW on two\n   systems disappear withe\

    \ Access Server operation in an Enterprise\n   The following is an illustration\
    \ of secure remote access data flow as\n   end-to-end IP packets traverse the\
    \ Internet and the SRAS. The example\n   shows IP packet tunneling and IPsec transformation\
    \ as packets are\n   exchanged between a remote Access host (RA-Host) and a host\
    \ within\n   the enterprise (say, Ent-Host).\n   Note, the IP packets originating\
    \ from or directed to RA-Host are\n   shown within PPP encapsulation, whereas,\
    \ all other packets are shown\n   simply as IP packets.  It is done this way to\
    \ highlight the PPP\n   packets encapsulated within L2TP tunnel. The PPP headers\
    \ below are\n   identified by their logical source and destination in parenthesis.\n\
    \   Note, however, the source and recipient information of the PPP data\n   is\
    \ not a part of PPP header. This is described thus, just for\n   clarity. In the\
    \ case of an L2TP tunnel, the L2TP header carries the\n   PPP session ID, which\
    \ indirectly identifies the PPP end points to the\n   LAC and the LNS. Lastly,\
    \ the IPsec Headers section below include the\n   tunneling overhead and the AH/ESP\
    \ headers that are attached to the\n   tunnel.\n   RA-Host to Ent-Host Packet\

- title: 6. Limitations to Secure Remote Access using L2TP
  contents:
  - "6. Limitations to Secure Remote Access using L2TP\n   The SRAS model described\
    \ is not without its limitations. Below is a\n   list of the limitations.\n  \
    \ 1. Tunneling overhead: There is considerable tunneling overhead on\n      the\
    \ end-to-end IP packet. Arguably, there is overlap of\n      information between\
    \ tunneling headers. This overhead will undercut\n      packet throughput.\n \
    \     The overhead is particularly apparent at the LAC and SRAS nodes.\n     \
    \ Specifically, the SRAS has the additional computational overhead\n      of IPsec\
    \ processing on all IP packets exchanged with remote users.\n      This can be\
    \ a significant bottleneck in the ability of SRAS to\n      scale for large numbers\
    \ of remote users.\n   2. Fragmentation and reassembly: Large IP packets may be\
    \ required to\n      undergo Fragmentation and reassembly at the LAC or the LNS\
    \ as a\n      result of multiple tunnel overhead tagged to the packet.\n     \
    \ Fragmentation and reassembly can havoc on packet throughput and\n      latency.\
    \ However, it is possible to avoid the overhead by reducing\n      the MTU permitted\
    \ within PPP frames.\n   3. Multiple identity and authentication requirement:\
    \ Remote Access\n      users are required to authenticate themselves to the SRAS\
    \ in order\n      to be obtain access to the link. Further, when they require\
    \ the\n      use of IKE to automate IPsec key exchange, they will need to\n  \
    \    authenticate once again with the same or different ID and a\n      distinct\
    \ authentication approach. The authentication requirements\n      of IKE phase\
    \ 1 [Ref 8] and LCP [Ref 3] are different.\n      However, it is possible to have\
    \ a single authentication approach\n      (i.e., a single ID and authentication\
    \ mechanism) that can be\n      shared between LCP and IKE phase 1.  The Extended\
    \ Authentication\n      Protocol(EAP) [Ref 4] may be used as the base to transport\
    \ IKE\n      authentication mechanism into PPP. Note, the configuration\n    \
    \  overhead is not a drag on the functionality perse.\n   4. Weak security of\
    \ Link level authentication: As LCP packets\n      traverse the Internet, the\
    \ Identity of the remote user and the\n      password (if a password is used)\
    \ is sent in the clear. This makes\n      it a target for someone on the net to\
    \ steal the information and\n      masquerade as remote user. Note, however, this\
    \ type of password\n      stealing will not jeopardize the security of the enterprise\
    \ per\n      se, but could result in denial of service to remote users. An\n \
    \     intruder can collect the password data and simply steal the link,\n    \
    \  but will not be able to run any IP applications subsequently, as\n      the\
    \ SRAS will fail non-IPsec packet data.\n      A better approach would be to employ\
    \ Extended Authentication\n      Protocol (EAP) [Ref 4] and select an authentication\
    \ technique that\n      is not prone to stealing over the Internet. Alternately,\
    \ the LAC\n      and the SRAS may be independently configured to use IPsec to\n\
    \      secure all LCP traffic exchanged between themselves.\n"

  contents:
  - "7. Configuring RADIUS to support Secure Remote Access.\n   A centralized RADIUS\
    \ database is used by enterprises to maintain the\n   authentication and authorization\
    \ requirements of the dial-in Users.\n   It is also believed that direct dial-in\
    \ access (e.g., through the\n   PSTN network is) safe and trusted and does not\
    \ need any scrutiny\n   outside of the link level authentication enforced in LCP.\
    \ This belief\n   is certainly not shared with the dial-in access through the\
    \ Internet.\n   So, while the same RADIUS database may be used for a user directly\n\
    \   dialing-in or dialing in through the Internet, the security\n   requirements\
    \ may vary. The following RADIUS attributes may be used to\n   mandate IPsec for\
    \ the users dialing-in through the Internet.  The\n   exact values for the attributes\
