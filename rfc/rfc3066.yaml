  - "1. Introduction\n   Human beings on our planet have, past and present, used a\
    \ number of\n   languages.  There are many reasons why one would want to identify\
    \ the\n   language used when presenting information.\n   In some contexts, it\
    \ is possible to have information available in\n   more than one language, or\
    \ it might be possible to provide tools\n   (such as dictionaries) to assist in\
    \ the understanding of a language.\n   Also, many types of information processing\
    \ require knowledge of the\n   language in which information is expressed in order\
    \ for that process\n   to be performed on the information; for example spell-checking,\n\
    \   computer-synthesized speech, Braille, or high-quality print\n   renderings.\n\
    \   One means of indicating the language used is by labeling the\n   information\
    \ content with an identifier for the language that is used\n   in this information\
    \ content.\n   This document specifies an identifier mechanism, a registration\n\
    \   function for values to be used with that identifier mechanism, and a\n   construct\
    \ for matching against those values.\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",\
    \ \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC 2119].\n"

- title: 2.1 Language tag syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1 Language tag syntax\n   The language tag is composed of one or more parts:\
    \ A primary language\n   subtag and a (possibly empty) series of subsequent subtags.\n\
    \   The syntax of this tag in ABNF [RFC 2234] is:\n    Language-Tag = Primary-subtag\
    \ *( \"-\" Subtag )\n    Primary-subtag = 1*8ALPHA\n    Subtag = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT)\n\
    \   The productions ALPHA and DIGIT are imported from RFC 2234; they\n   denote\
    \ respectively the characters A to Z in upper or lower case and\n   the digits\
    \ from 0 to 9.  The character \"-\" is HYPHEN-MINUS (ABNF:\n   %x2D).\n   All\
    \ tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist\n   conventions for\
    \ capitalization of some of them, but these should not\n   be taken to carry meaning.\
    \  For instance, [ISO 3166] recommends that\n   country codes are capitalized\
    \ (MN Mongolia), while [ISO 639]\n   recommends that language codes are written\
    \ in lower case (mn\n   Mongolian).\n"
- title: 2.2 Language tag sources
  contents:
  - "2.2 Language tag sources\n   The namespace of language tags is administered by\
    \ the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [RFC 2860] according to the\
    \ rules\n   in section 3 of this document.\n   The following rules apply to the\
    \ primary subtag:\n   - All 2-letter subtags are interpreted according to assignments\
    \ found\n     in ISO standard 639, \"Code for the representation of names of\n\
    \     languages\" [ISO 639], or assignments subsequently made by the ISO\n   \
    \  639 part 1 maintenance agency or governing standardization bodies.\n     (Note:\
    \ A revision is underway, and is expected to be released as\n     ISO 639-1:2000)\n\
    \   - All 3-letter subtags are interpreted according to assignments found\n  \
    \   in ISO 639 part 2, \"Codes for the representation of names of\n     languages\
    \ -- Part 2: Alpha-3 code [ISO 639-2]\", or assignments\n     subsequently made\
    \ by the ISO 639 part 2 maintenance agency or\n     governing standardization\
    \ bodies.\n   - The value \"i\" is reserved for IANA-defined registrations\n \
    \  - The value \"x\" is reserved for private use.  Subtags of \"x\" shall\n  \
    \   not be registered by the IANA.\n   - Other values shall not be assigned except\
    \ by revision of this\n     standard.\n   The reason for reserving all other tags\
    \ is to be open towards new\n   revisions of ISO 639; the use of \"i\" and \"\
    x\" is the minimum we can do\n   here to be able to extend the mechanism to meet\
    \ our immediate\n   requirements.\n   The following rules apply to the second\
    \ subtag:\n   - All 2-letter subtags are interpreted as ISO 3166 alpha-2 country\n\
    \     codes from [ISO 3166], or subsequently assigned by the ISO 3166\n     maintenance\
    \ agency or governing standardization bodies, denoting\n     the area to which\
    \ this language variant relates.\n   - Tags with second subtags of 3 to 8 letters\
    \ may be registered with\n     IANA, according to the rules in chapter 5 of this\
    \ document.\n   - Tags with 1-letter second subtags may not be assigned except\
    \ after\n     revision of this standard.\n   There are no rules apart from the\
    \ syntactic ones for the third and\n   subsequent subtags.\n   Tags constructed\
    \ wholly from the codes that are assigned\n   interpretations by this chapter\
    \ do not need to be registered with\n   IANA before use.\n   The information in\
    \ a subtag may for instance be:\n   - Country identification, such as en-US (this\
    \ usage is described in\n     ISO 639)\n   - Dialect or variant information, such\
    \ as en-scouse\n   - Languages not listed in ISO 639 that are not variants of\
    \ any listed\n     language, which can be registered with the i-prefix, such as\
    \ i-\n     tsolyani\n   - Region identification, such as sgn-US-MA (Martha's Vineyard\
    \ Sign\n     Language, which is found in the state of Massachusetts, US)\n   This\
    \ document leaves the decision on what tags are appropriate or not\n   to the\
    \ registration process described in section 3.\n   ISO 639 defines a maintenance\

- title: 2.3 Choice of language tag
  contents:
  - "2.3 Choice of language tag\n   One may occasionally be faced with several possible\
    \ tags for the same\n   body of text.\n   Interoperability is best served if all\
    \ users send the same tag, and\n   use the same tag for the same language for\
    \ all documents.  If an\n   application has requirements that make the rules here\
    \ inapplicable,\n   the application protocol specification MUST specify how the\
    \ procedure\n   varies from the one given here.\n   The text below is based on\
    \ the set of tags known to the tagging\n   entity.\n   1. Use the most precise\
    \ tagging known to the sender that can be\n      ascertained and is useful within\
    \ the application context.\n   2. When a language has both an ISO 639-1 2-character\
    \ code and an ISO\n      639-2 3-character code, you MUST use the tag derived\
    \ from the ISO\n      639-1 2-character code.\n   3. When a language has no ISO\
    \ 639-1 2-character code, and the ISO\n      639-2/T (Terminology) code and the\
    \ ISO 639-2/B (Bibliographic)\n      code differ, you MUST use the Terminology\
    \ code.  NOTE: At present,\n      all languages for which there is a difference\
    \ have 2-character\n      codes, and the displeasure of developers about the existence\
    \ of 2\n      code sets has been adequately communicated to ISO.  So this\n  \
    \    situation will hopefully not arise.\n   4. When a language has both an IANA-registered\
    \ tag (i-something) and\n      a tag derived from an ISO registered code, you\
    \ MUST use the ISO\n      tag.  NOTE: When such a situation is discovered, the\
    \ IANA-\n      registered tag SHOULD be deprecated as soon as possible.\n   5.\
    \ You SHOULD NOT use the UND (Undetermined) code unless the protocol\n      in\
    \ use forces you to give a value for the language tag, even if\n      the language\
    \ is unknown.  Omitting the tag is preferred.\n   6. You SHOULD NOT use the MUL\
    \ (Multiple) tag if the protocol allows\n      you to use multiple languages,\
    \ as is the case for the Content-\n      Language:  header.\n   NOTE: In order\
    \ to avoid versioning difficulties in applications such\n   as that of RFC 1766,\
    \ the ISO 639 Registration Authority Joint\n   Advisory Committee (RA-JAC) has\
    \ agreed on the following policy\n   statement:\n     \"After the publication\
    \ of ISO/DIS 639-1 as an International\n     Standard, no new 2-letter code shall\
    \ be added to ISO 639-1 unless a\n     3-letter code is also added at the same\
    \ time to ISO 639-2.  In\n     addition, no language with a 3-letter code available\
    \ at the time of\n     publication of ISO 639-1 which at that time had no 2-letter\
    \ code\n     shall be subsequently given a 2-letter code.\"\n   This will ensure\
    \ that, for example, a user who implements \"hwi\"\n   (Hawaiian), which currently\
    \ has no 2-letter code, will not find his\n   or her data invalidated by eventual\
    \ addition of a 2-letter code for\n   that language.\"\n"
- title: 2.4 Meaning of the language tag
  contents:
  - "2.4 Meaning of the language tag\n   The language tag always defines a language\
    \ as spoken (or written,\n   signed or otherwise signaled) by human beings for\
    \ communication of\n   information to other human beings.  Computer languages\
    \ such as\n   programming languages are explicitly excluded.  There is no\n  \
    \ guaranteed relationship between languages whose tags begin with the\n   same\
    \ series of subtags; specifically, they are NOT guaranteed to be\n   mutually\
    \ intelligible, although it will sometimes be the case that\n   they are.\n  \
    \ The relationship between the tag and the information it relates to is\n   defined\
    \ by the standard describing the context in which it appears.\n   Accordingly,\
    \ this section can only give possible examples of its\n   usage.\n   - For a single\
    \ information object, it could be taken as the set of\n     languages that is\
    \ required for a complete comprehension of the\n     complete object.\n     Example:\
    \ Plain text documents.\n   - For an aggregation of information objects, it should\
    \ be taken as\n     the set of languages used inside components of that aggregation.\n\
    \     Examples: Document stores and libraries.\n   - For information objects whose\
    \ purpose is to provide alternatives,\n     the set of tags associated with it\
    \ should be regarded as a hint\n     that the content is provided in several languages,\
    \ and that one has\n     to inspect each of the alternatives in order to find\
    \ its language\n     or languages.  In this case, a tag with multiple languages\
    \ does not\n     mean that one needs to be multi-lingual to get complete\n   \
    \  understanding of the document.\n     Example: MIME multipart/alternative.\n\
    \   - In markup languages, such as HTML and XML, language information can\n  \
    \   be added to each part of the document identified by the markup\n     structure\
    \ (including the whole document itself).  For example, one\n     could write <span\
    \ lang=\"FR\">C'est la vie.</span> inside a Norwegian\n     document; the Norwegian-speaking\
    \ user could then access a French-\n     Norwegian dictionary to find out what\
    \ the marked section meant.  If\n     the user were listening to that document\
    \ through a speech synthesis\n     interface, this formation could be used to\
    \ signal the synthesizer\n     to appropriately apply French text-to-speech pronunciation\
    \ rules to\n     that span of text, instead of misapplying the Norwegian rules.\n"
- title: 2.5 Language-range
  contents:
  - "2.5 Language-range\n   Since the publication of RFC 1766, it has become apparent\
    \ that there\n   is a need to define a term for a set of languages whose tags\
    \ all\n   begin with the same sequence of subtags.\n   The following definition\
    \ of language-range is derived from HTTP/1.1\n   [RFC 2616].\n             language-range\
    \  = language-tag / \"*\"\n   That is, a language-range has the same syntax as\
    \ a language-tag, or\n   is the single character \"*\".\n   A language-range matches\
    \ a language-tag if it exactly equals the tag,\n   or if it exactly equals a prefix\
    \ of the tag such that the first\n   character following the prefix is \"-\".\n\
    \   The special range \"*\" matches any tag.  A protocol which uses\n   language\
    \ ranges may specify additional rules about the semantics of\n   \"*\"; for instance,\
    \ HTTP/1.1 specifies that the range \"*\" matches only\n   languages not matched\
    \ by any other range within an \"Accept-Language:\"\n   header.\n   NOTE: This\
    \ use of a prefix matching rule does not imply that language\n   tags are assigned\
    \ to languages in such a way that it is always true\n   that if a user understands\
    \ a language with a certain tag, then this\n   user will also understand all languages\
    \ with tags for which this tag\n   is a prefix.  The prefix rule simply allows\
    \ the use of prefix tags if\n   this is the case.\n"
- title: 3. IANA registration procedure for language tags
  contents:
  - "3. IANA registration procedure for language tags\n   The procedure given here\
    \ MUST be used by anyone who wants to use a\n   language tag not given an interpretation\
    \ in chapter 2.2 of this\n   document or previously registered with IANA.\n  \
    \ This procedure MAY also be used to register information with the IANA\n   about\
    \ a tag defined by this document, for instance if one wishes to\n   make publicly\
    \ available a reference to the definition for a language\n   such as sgn-US (American\
    \ Sign Language).\n   Tags with a first subtag of \"x\" need not, and cannot,\
    \ be registered.\n   The process starts by filling out the registration form reproduced\n\
    \   below.\n   ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   LANGUAGE TAG REGISTRATION FORM\n   Name of requester          :\n   E-mail\
    \ address of requester:\n   Tag to be registered       :\n   English name of language\
    \   :\n   Native name of language (transcribed into ASCII):\n   Reference to published\
    \ description of the language (book or article):\n   Any other relevant information:\n\
    \   ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \
    \  The language form must be sent to <ietf-languages@iana.org> for a 2-\n   week\
    \ review period before it can be submitted to IANA.  (This is an\n   open list.\
    \  Requests to be added should be sent to <ietf-languages-\n   request@iana.org>.)\n\
    \   When the two week period has passed, the language tag reviewer, who\n   is\
    \ appointed by the IETF Applications Area Director, either forwards\n   the request\
    \ to IANA@IANA.ORG, or rejects it because of significant\n   objections raised\
    \ on the list.  Note that the reviewer can raise\n   objections on the list himself,\
    \ if he so desires.  The important\n   thing is that the objection must be made\
    \ publicly.\n   The applicant is free to modify a rejected application with\n\
    \   additional information and submit it again; this restarts the 2-week\n   comment\
    \ period.\n   Decisions made by the reviewer may be appealed to the IESG [RFC\
    \ 2028]\n   under the same rules as other IETF decisions [RFC 2026].  All\n  \
    \ registered forms are available online in the directory\n   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html\
    \ under \"languages\".\n   Updates of registrations follow the same procedure\
    \ as registrations.\n   The language tag reviewer decides whether to allow a new\
    \ registrant\n   to update a registration made by someone else; in the normal\
    \ case,\n   objections by the original registrant would carry extra weight in\n\
    \   such a decision.\n   There is no deletion of registrations; when some registered\
    \ tag\n   should not be used any more, for instance because a corresponding ISO\n\
    \   639 code has been registered, the registration should be amended by\n   adding\
    \ a remark like \"DEPRECATED: use <new code> instead\" to the\n   \"other relevant\
    \ information\" section.\n   Note: The purpose of the \"published description\"\
    \ is intended as an\n   aid to people trying to verify whether a language is registered,\
    \ or\n   what language a particular tag refers to.  In most cases, reference\n\
    \   to an authoritative grammar or dictionary of the language will be\n   useful;\
    \ in cases where no such work exists, other well known works\n   describing that\
    \ language or in that language may be appropriate.  The\n   language tag reviewer\
    \ decides what constitutes a \"good enough\"\n   reference material.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The only security issue that has been raised with\
    \ language tags since\n   the publication of RFC 1766, which stated that \"Security\
    \ issues are\n   believed to be irrelevant to this memo\", is a concern with language\n\
    \   ranges used in content negotiation - that they may be used to infer\n   the\
    \ nationality of the sender, and thus identify potential targets\n   for surveillance.\n\
    \   This is a special case of the general problem that anything you send\n   is\
    \ visible to the receiving party; it is useful to be aware that such\n   concerns\
    \ can exist in some cases.\n   The evaluation of the exact magnitude of the threat,\
    \ and any possible\n   countermeasures, is left to each application protocol.\n"
- title: 5. Character set considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Character set considerations\n   Language tags may always be presented using\
    \ the characters A-Z, a-z,\n   0-9 and HYPHEN-MINUS, which are present in most\
    \ character sets, so\n   presentation of language tags should not have any character\
    \ set\n   issues.\n   The issue of deciding upon the rendering of a character\
    \ set based on\n   the language tag is not addressed in this memo; however, it\
    \ is\n   thought impossible to make such a decision correctly for all cases\n\
    \   unless means of switching language in the middle of a text are\n   defined\
    \ (for example, a rendering engine that decides font based on\n   Japanese or\
    \ Chinese language may produce suboptimal output when a\n   mixed Japanese-Chinese\
    \ text is encountered)\n"
