Abstract This specification describes the configuration of proactive MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions for a given Label Switched Path (LSP) using a set of TLVs that are carried by the GMPLS RSVP TE protocol based on the OAM Configuration Framework for GMPLS RSVP TE.
This document describes the configuration of proactive MPLS TP OAM functions for a given LSP using TLVs that use GMPLS RSVP TE [RFC3473].
[RFC7260] defines use of GMPLS RSVP TE for the configuration of OAM functions in a technology agnostic way.
This document specifies the additional mechanisms necessary to establish MPLS TP OAM entities at the maintenance points for monitoring and performing measurements on an LSP, as well as defining information elements and procedures to configure proactive MPLS TP OAM functions running between Label Edge Routers (LERs).
Initialization and control of on demand MPLS TP OAM functions are expected to be carried out by directly accessing network nodes via a management interface; hence, configuration and control of on demand OAM functions are out of scope for this document.
MPLS TP, the Transport Profile of MPLS, must, by definition [RFC5654], be capable of operating without a control plane.
Therefore, there are several options for configuring MPLS TP OAM without a control plane by using either a Network Management System (NMS), an LSP Ping, or signaling protocols such as RSVP TE in the control plane.
MPLS TP describes a profile of MPLS that enables operational models typical in transport networks while providing additional OAM survivability and other maintenance functions not currently supported by MPLS.
[RFC5860] defines the requirements for the OAM functionality of MPLS TP.
Proactive MPLS TP OAM is performed by three different protocols: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC6428] for Continuity Check / Connectivity Verification, the Delay Measurement (DM) protocol [RFC6374] for delay and delay variation (jitter) measurements, and the Loss Measurement (LM) protocol [RFC6374] for packet loss and throughput measurements.
Additionally, there are a number of Fault Management signals that can be configured [RFC6427].
BFD is a protocol that provides low overhead, fast detection of failures in the path between two forwarding engines, including the interfaces, data link(s), and (to the extent possible)
BFD can be used to track the liveliness and to detect the data plane failures of MPLS TP point to point and might also be extended to support point to multipoint connections.
The delay and loss measurement protocols [RFC6374] use a simple query/response model for performing bidirectional measurements that allows the originating node to measure packet loss and delay in both directions.
By timestamping and/or writing current packet counters to the measurement packets four times
(Tx and Rx in both directions), current delays and packet losses can be calculated.
By performing successive delay measurements, the delay variation (jitter) can be calculated.
Current throughput can be calculated from the packet loss measurements by dividing the number of packets sent/received with the time it took to perform the measurement, given by the timestamp in LM header.
Combined with a packet generator, the throughput measurement can be used to measure the maximum capacity of a particular LSP.
It should be noted that here we are not configuring on demand throughput estimates based on saturating the connection as defined in [RFC6371].
Rather, we only enable the estimation of the current throughput based on loss measurements.

Overview of MPLS OAM for Transport Applications [RFC6371] describes how MPLS TP OAM mechanisms are operated to meet transport requirements outlined in [RFC5860].
[RFC6428] specifies two BFD operation modes: 1) "CC mode", which uses periodic BFD message exchanges with symmetric timer settings supporting Continuity Check, and 2) "CV/CC mode", which sends unique maintenance entity identifiers in the periodic BFD messages supporting CV as well as CC.
[RFC6374] specifies mechanisms for Performance Monitoring of LSPs, in particular it specifies loss and delay measurement OAM functions.
[RFC6427] specifies fault management signals with which a server LSP can notify client LSPs about various fault conditions to suppress alarms or to be used as triggers for actions in the client LSPs.
The following signals are defined: Alarm Indication Signal (AIS), Link Down Indication (LDI), and Lock Report (LKR).
[RFC6371] describes the mapping of fault conditions to consequent actions.
Some of these mappings may be configured by the operator depending on the application of the LSP.
The following defects are identified: Loss Of Continuity (LOC), Misconnectivity, MEP Misconfiguration, and Period Misconfiguration.
Out of these defect conditions, the following consequent actions may be configurable: 1) whether or not the LOC defect should result in blocking the outgoing data traffic; 2) whether or not the "Period Misconfiguration defect" should result in a signal fail condition.
MPLS TP OAM Configuration Operation Overview GMPLS RSVP TE, or alternatively LSP Ping [LSP PING CONF], can be used to simply enable the different OAM functions by setting the corresponding flags in the
OAM Function Flags Sub TLV [RFC7260].
For a more detailed configuration, one may include sub TLVs for the different OAM functions in order to specify various parameters in detail.
Typically, intermediate nodes SHOULD NOT process or modify any of the OAM Configuration TLVs but simply forward them to the end node.
There is one exception to this and that is if
the MPLS OAM FMS Sub
This sub TLV MUST be examined even by intermediate nodes that support these extensions but only acted upon by nodes capable of transmitting FMS signals into the LSP being established.
The sub TLV MAY be present when the FMS flag is set in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV.
If this sub TLV is present, then the "OAM MIP entities desired" and "OAM MEP entities desired" flags (described in [RFC7260]) in the LSP Attribute Flags TLV MUST be set and the entire OAM Configuration TLV placed either in the LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object or in the LSP ATTRIBUTES object in order to ensure that capable intermediate nodes process the configuration.
If placed in the LSP ATTRIBUTES object, nodes that are not able to process the OAM Configuration TLV will forward the message without generating an error.
If the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV has been placed in the LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object, a node that supports RFC 7260 but does not support the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV MUST generate a PathErr message with "OAM Problem/Configuration Error" [RFC7260].
Otherwise, if the node doesn't support RFC 7260, it will not raise any errors as described in the Section 4.1 of [RFC7260].
Finally, if the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV is not included, only the "OAM MEP entities desired" flag is set and the OAM Configuration TLV may be placed in either LSP ATTRIBUTES or LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES.
Configuration of BFD Sessions For this specification
, BFD MUST be run in either one of the two modes:  Asynchronous mode, where both sides should be in active mode; or  Unidirectional mode.
In the simplest scenario, RSVP TE (or alternatively LSP Ping [LSP PING CONF]), is used only to bootstrap a BFD session for an LSP without any timer negotiation.
Timer negotiation can be performed either in subsequent BFD Control messages (in this case the operation is similar to LSP Ping based bootstrapping described in [RFC5884]) or directly in the RSVP TE signaling messages.
When BFD Control packets are transported in the G ACh, they are not protected by any end to end checksum; only lower layers are providing error detection/correction.
A single bit error, e.g., a flipped bit in the BFD State field, could cause the receiving end to wrongly conclude that the link is down and, in turn, trigger protection switching.
To prevent this from happening, the BFD Configuration Sub TLV has an Integrity flag that, when set, enables BFD Authentication using Keyed SHA1 with an empty key (all 0s) [RFC5880].
This would ensure that every BFD Control packet carries a SHA1 hash of itself that can be used to detect errors.
If BFD Authentication using a pre shared key / password is desired (i.e., authentication and not only error detection), the BFD Authentication Sub TLV MUST be included in the BFD Configuration Sub  TLV.
The BFD Authentication Sub TLV is used to specify which authentication method should be used and which pre shared key / password should be used for this particular session.
How the key exchange is performed is out of scope of this document.
It is possible to configure Performance Monitoring functionalities such as Loss, Delay, Delay variation (jitter), and Throughput, as described in [RFC6374].
When configuring Performance Monitoring functionalities, it is possible to choose either the default configuration (by only setting the respective flags in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV) or a customized configuration.
To customize the configuration, one would set the respective flags and include the respective Loss and/or Delay sub TLVs.
By setting the PM/Loss flag in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV and by including the MPLS OAM PM Loss Sub TLV, one can configure the measurement interval and loss threshold values for triggering protection.
Delay measurements are configured by setting the PM/Delay flag in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV; by including the MPLS OAM PM Loss Sub  TLV, one can configure the measurement interval and the delay threshold values for triggering protection.
Configuration of Fault Management Signals To configure Fault Management signals and their refresh time, the FMS flag in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV MUST be set and the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV included.
When configuring Fault Management signals, an implementation can enable the default configuration by setting the FMS flag in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV.
In order to modify the default configuration, the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV MUST be included.
If an intermediate point is intended to originate fault management signal messages, this means that such an intermediate point is associated with a server MEP through a co located MPLS TP client/ server adaptation function, and the "Fault Management subscription" flag in the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV has been set as an indication of the request to create the association at each intermediate node of the client LSP.
The corresponding server MEP needs to be configured by its own RSVP TE session (or, alternatively, via an NMS or LSP Ping).
The OAM Configuration TLV, defined in [RFC7260], specifies the OAM functions that are used for the LSP.
This document extends the OAM Configuration TLV by defining a new OAM Type: "MPLS OAM" (3).
The MPLS OAM type is set to request the establishment of OAM functions for MPLS TP LSPs.
The specific OAM functions are specified in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV as depicted in [RFC7260].
When an egress LSR receives an OAM Configuration TLV indicating the MPLS OAM type, the LSR will first process any present OAM Function Flags Sub TLV, and then it MUST process technology specific configuration TLVs.
This document defines a sub TLV, the MPLS OAM Configuration Sub TLV, which is carried in the OAM Configuration
OAM Configuration Sub TLV Format Type: 33, the MPLS OAM Configuration Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the total length in octets, including sub TLVs as well as the Type and Length fields.
The following MPLS OAM specific sub TLVs MAY be included in the MPLS OAM Configuration
BFD Configuration Sub TLV MUST be included if either the CC, the CV, or both OAM Function flags are being set in the
OAM Function Flags Sub TLV [RFC7260].
This sub TLV carries additional sub  TLVs; failure to include the correct sub TLVs MUST result in an error being generated: "OAM Problem/Configuration Error".
Sub TLV MUST always be included.
Sub TLV MUST be included if the N flag is not set.
TLV MAY be included if the I flag is set.
Performance Monitoring Sub TLV, which MUST be included if any of the PM/Delay, PM/Loss, or PM/Throughput flags are set in the OAM Function Flag Sub TLV [RFC7260].
TLV MAY be included if the PM/Loss OAM Function flag is set.
If the MPLS OAM PM Loss Sub TLV is not included, default configuration values are used.
TLV MAY also be included in case the PM/Throughput OAM Function flag is set and there is the need to specify measurement intervals different from the default ones.
Since throughput measurements use the same tool as loss measurements, the same TLV is used.
Delay Sub TLV MAY be included if the PM/Delay OAM Function flag is set.
If the MPLS OAM PM Delay Sub TLV is not included, default configuration values are used.
OAM FMS Sub TLV MAY be included if the FMS OAM Function flag is set.
If the MPLS OAM FMS Sub TLV is not included, default configuration values are used.
The following are some additional rules of processing the MPLS OAM Configuration Sub TLV:  The MPLS OAM Configuration
Sub TLV MAY be empty, i.e., have no Value.
If so, then its Length MUST be 8.
Then, all OAM functions that have their corresponding flags set in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV MUST be assigned their default values or left disabled.
A sub TLV that doesn't have a corresponding flag set MUST be silently ignored.
If multiple copies of a sub TLV are present, then only the first sub TLV MUST be used and the remaining sub TLVs MUST be silently ignored.
However, not all the values can be derived from the standard RSVP TE objects, in particular the locally assigned Tunnel ID at the egress cannot be derived by the ingress node.
Therefore, the full LSP MEP  ID used by the ingress has to be carried in the BFD Identifiers
Sub  TLV in the Path message and the egress LSP MEP ID in the same way in the Resv message.
CV Flag Rules of Use
If the CV flag is set in the
OAM Function Flags Sub TLV [RFC7260], then the CC flag MUST be set as well because performing Connectivity Verification implies performing Continuity Check as well.
The format of an MPLS TP CV/CC message is shown in [RFC6428].
In order to perform Connectivity Verification, the CV/CC message MUST contain the "LSP MEP ID" in addition to the BFD Control packet information.
The "LSP MEP ID" contains four identifiers:
MPLS TP Global ID MPLS TP Node Identifier Tunnel Num LSP Num
These values need to be correctly set by both ingress and egress when transmitting a CV packet, and both ingress and egress need to know what to expect when receiving a CV packet.
Most of these values can be derived from the Path and Resv messages [RFC3473], which use a 5 tuple to uniquely identify an LSP within an operator's network.
This tuple is composed of a Tunnel Sender Address, Tunnel Endpoint Address, Tunnel ID, Extended Tunnel ID, and (GMPLS) LSP ID.
The BFD Configuration Sub TLV (depicted below) is defined for BFD  OAM specific configuration parameters.
The BFD Configuration Sub TLV is carried as a sub TLV of the MPLS OAM Configuration Sub TLV.
This TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries sub  TLVs. 0
N S I G U B

BFD Configuration Sub TLV Format Type: 1, the BFD Configuration Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the total length in octets, including sub TLVs as well as the Type and Length fields.
Identifies the BFD protocol version.
If the egress LSR does not support the version, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/ Unsupported BFD Version".
BFD Negotiation (N): If set timer negotiation/re negotiation via BFD Control messages is enabled, when cleared it is disabled.
Symmetric Session (S): If set, the BFD session MUST use symmetric timing values.
Integrity (I): If set, BFD Authentication MUST be enabled.
If the BFD Configuration Sub TLV does not include a BFD Authentication Sub  TLV, the authentication MUST use Keyed SHA1 with an empty pre shared key (all 0s).
If the egress LSR does not support BFD Authentication, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/BFD Authentication unsupported".
Encapsulation Capability (G): If set, it shows the capability of encapsulating BFD messages into The G Ach channel.
If both the G bit and U bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.
If the egress LSR does not support any of the ingress LSR Encapsulation Capabilities, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD Encapsulation format".
Encapsulation Capability (U): If set, it shows the capability of encapsulating BFD messages into UDP packets.
If both the G bit and U bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.
If the egress LSR does not support any of the ingress LSR Encapsulation Capabilities, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD Encapsulation Format".
: If set, it configures BFD in the Bidirectional mode.
If it is not set, it configures BFD in unidirectional mode.
In the second case, the source node does not expect any Discriminator values back from the destination node.
Reserved for future specifications; set to 0 on transmission and ignored when received.
The BFD Configuration Sub TLV MUST include the following sub TLVs in the Path message:  BFD Identifiers Sub TLV; and  Negotiation Timer Parameters
Sub TLV if the N flag is cleared.
The BFD Configuration Sub TLV MUST include the following sub TLVs in the Resv message:  BFD Identifiers Sub TLV; and  Negotiation Timer Parameters
the Negotiation Timer Parameters Sub TLV received by the egress
In this case, an updated Negotiation Timer Parameters Sub TLV containing values supported by the egress LSR MUST be returned to the ingress.
The BFD Identifiers Sub TLV is carried as a sub TLV of the BFD Configuration Sub TLV and is depicted below.
BFD Identifiers Sub TLV Format Type: 1, the BFD Identifiers Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the TLV total length in octets, including the Type and Length fields (20).
A unique, non zero discriminator value generated by the transmitting system and referring to itself; it is used to de  multiplex multiple BFD sessions between the same pair of systems as defined in [RFC5880].
MPLS TP Global ID, Node Identifier, Tunnel Num, and LSP Num:
All set as defined in [RFC6370].
The Negotiation Timer Parameters Sub TLV is carried as a sub TLV of the BFD Configuration Sub TLV and is depicted below.
Parameters Sub TLV Format Type: 2,
the Negotiation Timer Parameters Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the TLV total length in octets, including Type and Length fields (16).
Asynchronous TX interval: If the S flag is set in the BFD Configuration Sub TLV, it expresses the desired time interval (in microseconds) at which the ingress LER intends to both transmit and receive BFD periodic control packets.
If the egress LSR cannot support the value, it SHOULD reply with a supported interval.
If the S flag is cleared in the BFD Configuration Sub TLV, this field expresses the desired time interval (in microseconds) at which the ingress LSR intends to transmit BFD periodic control packets.
Asynchronous RX interval: If the S flag is set in the BFD Configuration Sub TLV, this field MUST be set equal to "Acceptable Min.
Asynchronous TX interval" on transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt since it has no additional meaning with respect to the one described for "Acceptable Min.
If the S flag is cleared in the BFD Configuration Sub TLV, it expresses the minimum time interval (in microseconds) at which the ingress/egress LSRs can receive periodic BFD Control packets.
If this value is greater than the "Acceptable Min.
Asynchronous TX interval" received from the ingress/egress LSR, the receiving LSR MUST adopt the interval expressed in the "Acceptable Min.
The minimum interval (in microseconds) between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in Section 6.8.9 of [RFC5880].
This value is also an indication for the receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo packets.
If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.
If the LSR node cannot support this value, it SHOULD reply with a supported value (which may be zero if Echo is not supported).
The BFD Authentication Sub TLV is carried as a sub TLV of the BFD Configuration Sub TLV and is depicted below.
BFD Authentication Sub TLV Format Type: 3, the BFD Authentication Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the TLV total length in octets, including Type and Length fields (8).

The same values are used as are defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC5880].
If the egress LSR does not support this type, an "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD Authentication Type" error MUST be generated.
Indicates which authentication key or password (depending on Auth Type) should be used.
How the key exchange is performed is out of scope of this document.
If the egress LSR does not support this Auth Key ID, an "OAM Problem/Mismatch of BFD Authentication Key ID" error MUST be generated.
Reserved for future specifications; set to 0 on transmission and ignored when received.

Traffic Class Sub TLV Format Type: 4, the Traffic Class Sub TLV.
Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets (4).
Identifies the TC [RFC5462] for periodic continuity monitoring messages or packets with fault management information.
If the Traffic Class Sub TLV is present, then the value of the TC field MUST be used as the value of the TC field of an MPLS label stack entry.
If the Traffic Class Sub TLV is absent from BFD Configuration Sub TLV or Fault Management Signal Sub TLV, then selection of the TC value is a local decision.
If the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV has either the PM/Loss, PM/Delay, or PM/Throughput flag set, the Performance Monitoring Sub TLV MUST be present in the MPLS OAM Configuration Sub TLV.
Failure to include the correct sub TLVs MUST result in an "OAM Problem/Configuration Error" message being generated.
The Performance Monitoring Sub TLV provides the configuration information mentioned in Section 7 of [RFC6374].
It includes support for the configuration of quality thresholds and, as described in [RFC6374], "the crossing of which will trigger warnings or alarms, and result reporting and exception notification will be integrated into the system wide network management and reporting framework.
In case the values need to be different than the default ones, the Performance Monitoring Sub TLV includes the following sub TLVs:
MPLS OAM PM Loss Sub TLV if the PM/Loss and/or PM/Throughput flag is set in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV; and  MPLS
OAM PM Delay Sub TLV
if the PM/Delay flag is set in the OAM Function Flags Sub TLV.

Values from this new sub registry are to be allocated through IETF Review except for the "Reserved for Experimental Use" range.
Performance Monitoring Sub TLV Types 5.6.
New RSVP TE Error Codes
MPLS OAM Configuration Error Codes
The "Sub Codes 40 OAM Problem" sub registry is located in the "Error Codes and Globally Defined Error Value Sub Codes" registry.
The signaling of OAM related parameters and the automatic establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].
In particular, a network element could be overloaded if an attacker were to request high frequency liveliness monitoring of a large number of LSPs, targeting a single network element as discussed in [RFC7260] and [RFC6060].
Additional discussion of security for MPLS and GMPLS protocols can be found in [RFC5920].
