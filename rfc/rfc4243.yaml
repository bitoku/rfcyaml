  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCP (RFC 2131 [2]) provides IP addresses and configuration\n\
    \   information for IPv4 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability,\n   in\
    \ which processes within the network infrastructure receive\n   broadcast messages\
    \ from clients and forward them to DHCP servers as\n   unicast messages.  In network\
    \ environments like DOCSIS data-over-\n   cable and xDSL, for example, it has\
    \ proven useful for the relay agent\n   to add information to the DHCP message\
    \ before forwarding it, using\n   the relay agent information option (RFC 3046\
    \ [3]).\n   Servers that recognize the relay agent option echo it back in their\n\
    \   replies, and some of the information that relays add may be used to\n   help\
    \ an edge device efficiently return replies to clients.  The\n   information that\
    \ relays supply can also be used in the server's\n   decision making about the\
    \ addresses and configuration parameters that\n   the client should receive.\n\
    \   In many environments, it's desirable to associate some vendor- or\n   provider-specific\
    \ information with the clients' DHCP messages.  This\n   is often done using the\
    \ relay agent information option.  RFC 3046\n   defines Remote-ID and Circuit-ID\
    \ sub-options that are used to carry\n   such information.  The values of those\
    \ suboptions, however, are\n   usually based on some network resource, such as\
    \ an IP address of a\n   network access device, an ATM Virtual Circuit identifier,\
    \ or a DOCSIS\n   cable-modem identifier.  As a result, the values carried in\
    \ these\n   suboptions are dependent on the physical network configuration.  The\n\
    \   Vendor-Specific suboption allows administrators to associate other\n   useful\
    \ data with relayed DHCP messages.\n"

    \ Suboption Data is an opaque sequence of bytes.\n   The Vendor-Specific suboption\
    \ includes at least one Enterprise Number\n   and carries opaque data defined\
    \ by the organization identified by the\n   Enterprise Number.  A relay may include\
    \ data associated with more\n   than one vendor's Enterprise Number within a single\
    \ instance of the\n   Suboption.\n   Of course, the Vendor-Specific data are vendor-specific.\
    \  This\n   specification does not establish any requirements on the data in the\n\
    \   suboption.  Vendors who make use of this suboption are encouraged to\n   document\
    \ their usage in order to make interoperability possible.\n"

  - "4.  Relay Agent Behavior\n   DHCP relay agents MAY be configured to include Vendor-Specific\n\
    \   suboptions if they include a relay agent information option in\n   relayed\
    \ DHCP messages.  The suboptions' types and data are assigned\n   and configured\
    \ through mechanisms that are outside the scope of this\n   memo.\n   Relay implementors\
    \ are encouraged to offer their administrators a\n   means of configuring what\
    \ data can be included in this suboption, and\n   to document what they are capable\
    \ of.\n"
- title: 5.  DHCP Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "5.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   This suboption provides additional information to\
    \ the DHCP server.\n   The DHCP server, if it is configured to support this suboption,\
    \ may\n   use this information, in addition to other relay agent option data\n\
    \   and other options included in the DHCP client messages, in order to\n   assign\
    \ an IP address and/or other configuration parameters to the\n   client.  There\
    \ is no special additional processing for this\n   suboption.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain\
    \ use, where the out-\n   of-band exchange of a shared secret is feasible, is\
    \ defined in RFC\n   3118 [5].  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in\
    \ section 7\n   of the DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131 [2].\n   The DHCP\
    \ relay agent option depends on a trusted relationship between\n   the DHCP relay\
    \ agent and the server, as described in section 5 of RFC\n   3046.  Fraudulent\
    \ relay agent option data could potentially lead to\n   theft-of-service or exhaustion\
    \ of limited resources (like IP\n   addresses) by unauthorized clients.  A host\
    \ that tampered with relay\n   agent data associated with another host's DHCP\
    \ messages could deny\n   service to that host, or interfere with its operation\
    \ by leading the\n   DHCP server to assign it inappropriate configuration parameters.\n\
    \   While the introduction of fraudulent relay agent options can be\n   prevented\
    \ by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless the\n   relay agent\
    \ is trusted, a deeper defense using authentication for\n   relay agent options\
    \ via the Authentication Suboption [6] SHOULD be\n   deployed as well.\n   There\
    \ are several data in a DHCP message that convey information that\n   may identify\
    \ an individual host on the network.  These include the\n   chaddr, the client-id\
    \ option, and the hostname and client-fqdn\n   options.  Depending on the type\
    \ of data included, the Vendor-Specific\n   suboption may also convey information\
    \ that identifies a specific host\n   or a specific user on the network.  In practice,\
    \ this information\n   isn't exposed outside the internal service-provider network,\
    \ where\n   DHCP messages are usually confined.  Administrators who configure\n\
    \   data that will be used in DHCP Vendor-Specific suboptions should be\n   careful\
    \ to use data that are appropriate for the types of networks\n   they administer.\
    \  If DHCP messages travel outside the service-\n   provider's own network, or\
    \ if the suboption values may become visible\n   to other users, it may raise\
    \ privacy concerns for the access provider\n   or service provider.\n"
