- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets\n  \
    \ containing non-IPv4-translatable addresses as the source.  These\n   packets\
    \ should be passed across the translator as ICMP packets\n   directed to the IPv4\
    \ destination.  This document presents\n   recommendations for source address\
    \ translation in ICMPv6 headers to\n   handle such cases.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 5.3 of \"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\" [RFC6145]\
    \ states that\n   \"the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header may not be IPv4-translatable\n\
    \   addresses and there will be no corresponding IPv4 addresses\n   representing\
    \ this IPv6 address.  In this case, the translator can do\n   stateful translation.\
    \  A mechanism by which the translator can\n   instead do stateless translation\
    \ of this address is left for future\n   work.\"  This document, \"Stateless Source\
    \ Address Mapping for ICMPv6\n   Packets\", provides recommendations for this\
    \ case.\n   For the purposes of this document, the term \"IPv4-translatable IPv6\n\
    \   address\" is as defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC6052].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,\
    \ SHALL NOT, SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they\
    \ appear in this\n   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Problem Statement and Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement and Considerations\n   When a stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator\
    \ receives an ICMPv6 message\n   [RFC4443] (for example, \"Packet Too Big\") sourced\
    \ from a non-IPv4-\n   translatable IPv6 address and bound for an IPv4-translatable\
    \ IPv6\n   address, the translator needs to pick a source address with which to\n\
    \   generate an ICMP message.  For the reasons discussed below, this\n   choice\
    \ is problematic.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Considerations\n   The source address used SHOULD NOT cause the ICMP packet\
    \ to be\n   discarded.  It SHOULD NOT be drawn from [RFC1918] or [RFC6598]\n \
    \  address space, because that address space is likely to be subject to\n   unicast\
    \ Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704] filtering.\n   IPv4/IPv6 translation\
    \ is intended for use in contexts where IPv4\n   addresses may not be readily\
    \ available.  Therefore, it is not\n   considered appropriate to assign IPv4-translatable\
    \ IPv6 addresses for\n   all internal points in the IPv6 network that may originate\
    \ ICMPv6\n   messages.\n   Another consideration for source selection is that\
    \ it should be\n   possible for the IPv4 recipients of the ICMP message to be\
    \ able to\n   distinguish between different IPv6 network origination of ICMPv6\n\
    \   messages (for example, to support a traceroute diagnostic utility\n   that\
    \ provides some limited network-level visibility across the IPv4/\n   IPv6 translator).\
    \  This consideration implies that an IPv4/IPv6\n   translator needs to have a\
    \ pool of IPv4 addresses for mapping the\n   source address of ICMPv6 packets\
    \ generated from different origins, or\n   to include the IPv6 source address\
    \ information for mapping the source\n   address by others means.  Currently,\
    \ the TRACEROUTE and MTR [MTR] are\n   the only consumers of translated ICMPv6\
    \ messages that care about the\n   ICMPv6 source address.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Recommendations\n   The recommended approach to source selection is to\
    \ use a single (or\n   small pool of) public IPv4 address as the source address\
    \ of the\n   translated ICMP message and leverage the ICMP extension [RFC5837]\
    \ to\n   include the IPv6 address as an Interface IP Address Sub-Object.\n"
- title: 4.  ICMP Extension
  contents:
  - "4.  ICMP Extension\n   In the case of either a single public IPv4 address (the\
    \ IPv4\n   interface address or loopback address of the translator) or a pool\
    \ of\n   public IPv4 addresses, the translator SHOULD implement the ICMP\n   extension\
    \ defined by [RFC5837].  The ICMP message SHOULD include the\n   Interface IP\
    \ Address Sub-Object and specify the source IPv6 addresses\n   of the original\
    \ ICMPv6.  When an enhanced traceroute application is\n   used, it can derive\
    \ the real IPv6 source addresses that generated the\n   ICMPv6 messages.  Therefore,\
    \ it would be able improve on visibility\n   towards the origin rather than simply\
    \ blackholing at or beyond the\n   translator.  In the future, a new ICMP extension\
    \ whose presence\n   indicates that the packet has been translated and that the\
    \ source\n   address belongs to the translator, not the originating node, can\
    \ also\n   be considered.\n"
- title: 5.  Stateless Address Mapping Algorithm
  contents:
  - "5.  Stateless Address Mapping Algorithm\n   If a pool of public IPv4 addresses\
    \ is configured on the translator,\n   it is RECOMMENDED to randomly select the\
    \ IPv4 source address from the\n   pool.  Random selection reduces the probability\
    \ that two ICMP\n   messages elicited by the same TRACEROUTE might specify the\
    \ same\n   source address and, therefore, erroneously present the appearance of\n\
    \   a routing loop.\n   [RFC5837] extensions and an enhanced traceroute application,\
    \ if used,\n   will reveal the IPv6 source addresses that generated the original\n\
    \   ICMPv6 messages.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document recommends the generation of IPv4\
    \ ICMP messages from\n   IPv6 ICMP messages.  These messages would otherwise have\
    \ been\n   discarded.  New considerations are not expected to result from this\n\
    \   change.  As with a number of ICMP messages, a spoofed source address\n   may\
    \ result in replies arriving at hosts that did not expect them\n   using the facility\
    \ of the translator.\n"
