  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification describes a runtime assignment of a local\
    \ mobility\n   anchor (LMA) for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] protocol.\n\
    \   The runtime LMA assignment takes place during a Proxy Binding Update\n   (PBU)\
    \ and a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message exchange\n   between a mobile\
    \ access gateway (MAG) and a LMA.  The runtime LMA\n   assignment functionality\
    \ defined in this specification can be used,\n   for example, for load-balancing\
    \ purposes.  MAGs and LMAs can also\n   implement other load-balancing mechanisms\
    \ that are completely\n   transparent at the PMIPv6 protocol level and do not\
    \ depend on the\n   functionality defined in this specification.\n   The runtime\
    \ LMA assignment functionality does not depend on the\n   Domain Name System (DNS)\
    \ or the Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting (AAA) infrastructure\
    \ for the assignment of the LMA to\n   which the mobile node (MN) is anchored.\
    \  All MAGs and LMAs (either\n   rfLMAs or r2LMAs; see Section 2.2) have to belong\
    \ to the same PMIPv6\n   domain.\n   There are a number of reasons why the runtime\
    \ LMA assignment is a\n   useful addition to the PMIPv6 protocol.  A few are identified\
    \ below:\n   o  LMAs with multiple IP addresses: a cluster of LMAs or a blade\n\
    \      architecture LMA may appear to the routing system as multiple LMAs\n  \
    \    with separate unicast IP addresses.  A MAG can initially select\n      any\
    \ of the LMAs as the serving LMA using, for example, DNS- and\n      AAA-based\
    \ solutions.  However, MAG's initial selection may be\n      suboptimal from the\
    \ LMA point of view and immediate runtime\n      assignment to a \"proper LMA\"\
    \ would be needed.  The LMA could use a\n      [RFC5142]-based approach, but that\
    \ would imply unnecessary setting\n      up of a mobility session in a \"wrong\
    \ LMA\" with associated back-end\n      support system interactions, additional\
    \ signaling between the MAG\n      and the LMA, and re-establishing a mobility\
    \ session to the new LMA\n      again with associated signaling.\n   o  Bypassing\
    \ a load-balancer: a cluster of LMAs or a blade\n      architecture LMA may have\
    \ a load-balancer in front of them or\n      integrated in one of the LMAs.  The\
    \ load-balancer would represent\n      multiple LMAs during the LMA discovery\
    \ phase and only its IP\n      address would be exposed to the MAG thus hiding\
    \ possible\n      individual LMA or LMA blade IP addresses from the MAG.  However,\n\
    \      if all traffic must always go through the load-balancer, it\n      quickly\
    \ becomes a bottleneck.  Therefore, a PMIPv6 protocol-level\n      support for\
    \ bypassing the load-balancer after the initial PBU/PBA\n      exchange would\
    \ greatly help scalability.  Also, bypassing the\n      load-balancer as soon\
    \ as possible allows implementing load-\n      balancers that do not maintain\
    \ any MN-specific state information.\n   o  Independence from DNS: DNS-based load-balancing\
    \ is a common\n      practice.  However, keeping MAGs up to date with LMA load\
    \ status\n      using DNS is hard, e.g., due to caching and unpredictable zone\n\
    \      update delays [RFC6097].  Generally, LMAs constantly updating the\n   \
    \   [RFC2136] zone's master DNS server might not feasible in a large\n      PMIPv6\
    \ domain due to increased load on the master DNS server and\n      additional\
    \ background signaling.  Furthermore, MAGs may perform\n      (LMA) destination\
    \ address selection decisions that are not in line\n      with what the DNS administrator\
    \ actually wanted [RFC3484].\n   o  Independence from AAA: AAA-based solutions\
    \ have basically the same\n      arguments as DNS-based solutions above.  It is\
    \ also typical that\n      AAA-based solutions offload the initial LMA selection\
    \ to the DNS\n      infrastructure [RFC5779].  The AAA infrastructure does not\
    \ return\n      an IP address or a Fully Qualified domain Name (FQDN) to a single\n\
    \      LMA; rather, it returns a FQDN representing a group of LMAs.\n   o  Support\
    \ for IPv6 anycast addressing [RFC4291]: the current PMIPv6\n      specification\
    \ does not specify how the PMIPv6 protocol should\n      treat anycast addresses\
    \ assigned to mobility agents.  For example,\n      a blade architecture LMA may\
    \ have a unique unicast IP address for\n      each blade and a single anycast\
    \ address for all blades.  A MAG\n      could then initially send a PBU to an\
    \ anycast LMA address and\n      receive a PBA from an anycast LMA address.  Once\
    \ the MAG receives\n      the unicast address of the runtime-assigned LMA blade\
    \ through the\n      initial PBU/PBA exchange, the subsequent communication continues\n\
    \      using the unicast address.\n   As a summary, the DNS/AAA-based approaches\
    \ cannot be used to select\n   an \"appropriate\" LMA at runtime.  Therefore,\
    \ this specification\n   defines a solution that is applicable for LMA implementations\
    \ where\n   the IP address known to the MAG is not the best LMA of choice at\n\
    \   runtime.\n"

    \ the runtime LMA\n   assignment.\n   Each LMA and MAG participating in the runtime\
    \ LMA assignment is\n   assumed to have required Security Associations (SAs) pre-established.\n\
    \   Dynamic negotiation of the SAs using, e.g., IKEv2 [RFC5996], SHOULD\n   be\
    \ supported but is out of scope of this specification.\n"

    \ a MAG sends a PBU to an LMA;\n   this results in creation of a Binding Cache\
    \ Entry (BCE) at the LMA\n   and the LMA sending a PBA sent back to the MAG. \
    \ The MAG in turn\n   creates a corresponding Binding Update List Entry (BULE).\
    \  This\n   specification extends the base protocol with the runtime LMA\n   assignment\
    \ functionality.\n   If the MAG supports the runtime LMA assignment and the functionality\n\
    \   is also enabled (see the EnableLMARedirectFunction configuration\n   variable\
    \ in Section 7), then the MAG includes the Redirect-Capability\n   mobility option\
    \ in a PBU that establishes a new mobility session\n   (i.e., Handoff Indicator\
    \ Option in the PBU has the value of 1).  The\n   Redirect-Capability mobility\
    \ option in the PBU is also an indication\n   to an LMA that the MAG supports\
    \ the runtime LMA assignment\n   functionality and is prepared to be assigned\
    \ with a different LMA.\n   The runtime LMA assignment concerns always one mobility\
    \ session at a\n   time.\n   If the MAG receives a PBA that contains the Redirect\
    \ mobility option\n   without first including the Redirect-Capability mobility\
    \ option in\n   the corresponding PBU, then the MAG MUST ignore the option and\n\
    \   process the PBA as described in RFC 5213.\n   If the MAG receives a PBA that\

    \ mobility option in\n   the corresponding PBU, then the MAG MUST perform the\
    \ following steps\n   in addition to the normal [RFC5213] PBA processing:\n  \
    \ o  The MAG updates its BULE to contain the r2LMA address included in\n     \
    \ the received Redirect mobility option.\n   o  If there is no SA between the\
    \ MAG and the r2LMA, the MAG SHOULD\n      initiate a dynamic creation of the\
    \ SA between the MAG and the\n      r2LMA as described in Section 4 of RFC 5213.\
    \  If the dynamic SA\n      creation fails, the MAG SHOULD log the event.  The\
    \ MAG MAY retry\n      the dynamic creation of the SA, and if those also fail,\
    \ the newly\n      created BULE (and also the BUL in the r2LMA) will eventually\n\
    \      timeout.  If the failure is persistent, it can be regarded as a\n     \
    \ system-level configuration error.\n   The MAG is not required to send a fresh\
    \ PBU to the r2LMA after a\n   successful runtime assignment.  The mobility session\
    \ has already been\n   established in the r2LMA.  The MAG MUST send all user traffic\
    \ to the\n   r2LMA address.  The MAG MUST send subsequent binding refresh PBUs\n\
    \   (e.g., lifetime extension, handoff, etc.) to the r2LMA address.  If\n   there\

    \ the rfLMA and the r2LMA are two isolated\n   functions, and may even be physically\
    \ separate networking nodes.  The\n   r2LMA can be any [RFC5213]- or [RFC5844]-compliant\
    \ LMA that doesn't\n   have any knowledge of this specification when IPv6 transport\
    \ is used.\n   In case of IPv4 transport, the [RFC5844]-compliant LMA MUST also\n\
    \   implement the Alternate IPv4 Care-of Address option (see\n   Section 4.4).\
    \  Figure 3 illustrates example signaling flows for the\n   solution.\n   The\
    \ rfLMA is actually a non-transparent 'proxy-MAG' that shows up as\n   an LMA\
    \ implementing this specification towards the MAG, and as a base\n   [RFC5213]-compliant\
    \ MAG to the r2LMA.  (See [RFC2616] for a generic\n   definition of a non-transparent\
    \ proxy; although it's for HTTP, the\n   idea also applies here.)  This type of\
    \ operation is also referred to\n   as 'chaining' in other contexts.  The protocol\
    \ between the 'proxy-\n   MAG' and the r2LMA is the base [RFC5213] PMIPv6 protocol.\n\
    \   The MAG-LMA SA is between the MAG and the rfLMA, and [RFC5213] SA\n   considerations\
    \ apply fully.  The MAG has no knowledge of the 'proxy-\n   MAG'-r2LMA SA.  [RFC5213]\
    \ considerations regarding the SA between the\n   'proxy-MAG' and the r2LMA apply\
    \ fully.  It is also possible that\n   'proxy-MAG'-r2LMA security is arranged\
    \ using other means than IPsec,\n   for example, using layer-2 VPNs.\n   When\
    \ the rfLMA receives a PBU, and the PBU contains the Redirect-\n   Capability\

    \ PBU using the procedures described in RFC 5213\n      except that no mobility\
    \ session gets created.  Instead, the rfLMA\n      creates a proxy state based\
    \ on the received PBU.\n   o  Assigns a r2LMA to the MAG.\n   o  Creates a new\
    \ PBU', which includes all non-security related\n      mobility options from the\
    \ original PBU and an Alternate Care-of\n      Address (ACoA) option containing\
    \ the Proxy Care-of Address of the\n      original MAG.  If the original PBU already\
    \ included an ACoA\n      option, then the content of the ACoA option in the PBU'\
    \ MUST be\n      the same as in the original PBU.\n      Note, in case of IPv4\
    \ transport [RFC5844], the Alternate IPv4\n      Care-of Address (A4CoA) option\
    \ MUST be used and contain the IPv4\n      Proxy Care-of Address of the original\
    \ MAG.\n   o  Sends the new PBU' sourced from its 'proxy-MAG' IPv6 or IPv4 Proxy\n\
    \      Care-of Address and destined to the r2LMA address using the\n      procedures\
    \ described in RFC 5213 (or RFC 5844 in case of IPv4\n      transport).\n   The\
    \ r2LMA processes the received PBU' using the procedures described\n   in RFC\
    \ 5213 or RFC 5844.  In case of IPv4 transport, the r2LMA uses\n   the IPv4 Proxy\
    \ Care-of Address from the Alternate IPv4 Care-of\n   Address option for the tunnel\
    \ setup and the creation of the BCE.  The\n   reply PBA' MUST be destined to the\
    \ source address of the received\n   PBU', i.e., the Care-of Address the 'proxy-MAG'.\n\
    \   Once the rfLMA in a 'proxy-MAG' role receives a reply PBA' from the\n   r2LMA\
    \ and the mobility session creation succeeded in the r2LMA, the\n   rfLMA sends\
    \ a PBA to the original MAG.  The PBA is sourced from the\n   rfLMA address and\
    \ destined to the MAG (IPv6 or IPv4) Proxy Care-of\n   Address.  The PBA MUST\
    \ contain the r2LMA (IPv6 or IPv4) unicast\n   address in the Redirect mobility\
    \ option.  Other non-security-related\n   mobility options (including the Load\
    \ Information option) are copied\n   from the PBA' to the PBA as such.\n   If\
    \ one of these errors occurs:\n   o  the PBA' Status Value indicates that the\
    \ mobility session creation\n      failed in the r2LMA.  For example, the Status\
    \ Value in the PBA' is\n      set to 130 (Insufficient resources), or\n   o  there\
    \ was no PBA' response from the r2LMA, or\n   o  the PBA' did not include the\
    \ Alternate IPv4 Care-of Address option\n      although it was included in the\
    \ corresponding PBU' (when using\n      IPv4 transport),\n   then the rfLMA SHOULD\

- title: 6.  Handoff and Multi-Homing Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Handoff and Multi-Homing Considerations\n   A MN can be multi-homed, i.e.,\
    \ have network connectivity over\n   multiple interfaces connected to one or more\
    \ accesses.  If PMIPv6-\n   based handovers between multiple interfaces or accesses\
    \ are desired,\n   then a single LMA should have a control over all possible multi-homed\n\
    \   mobility sessions the MN has.  Once the MN has established one\n   mobility\
    \ session with one LMA, the subsequent mobility sessions of\n   the same MN would\
    \ be anchored to the LMA that was initially assigned.\n   If each mobility session\
    \ over a different interface (and possibly a\n   MAG) has no requirements for\
    \ PMIPv6-based handovers between accesses\n   or interfaces, then the rest of\
    \ the considerations in this section do\n   not apply.\n   One possible solution\
    \ already supported by this specification is\n   applying the runtime LMA assignment\
    \ only for the very first initial\n   attach a multi-homed MN does towards a PMIPv6\
    \ domain.  After the\n   initial attach, the assigned r2LMA address has been stored\
    \ in the\n   policy profile.  For the subsequent mobility sessions of the multi-\n\
    \   homed MN, the same assigned r2LMA address would be used and there is\n   no\
    \ need to contact the rfLMA.  Ensuring the discovery of the same\n   r2LMA each\
    \ time relies on the MN having an identity that can always\n   point to the same\
    \ policy profile, independent of the access that is\n   used.\n   MAGs have a\
    \ control over selectively enabling and disabling the\n   runtime assignment of\
    \ the LMA.  If the multi-homed MN is attached to\n   a PMIPv6 domain via multiple\
    \ MAGs, the assigned r2LMA address should\n   be stored in the remote policy store\
    \ and downloaded as a part of the\n   policy profile download to a MAG.  Alternatively,\
    \ MAGs can share\n   policy profile information using other means.  In both cases,\
    \ the\n   actual implementation of the policy profile information sharing is\n\
    \   specific to a PMIPv6 deployment and out of scope of this\n   specification.\n"
- title: 7.  Protocol Configuration Variables
  contents:
  - "7.  Protocol Configuration Variables\n   This specification defines two configuration\
    \ variables that control\n   the runtime LMA assignment functionality within a\
    \ PMIPv6 domain.\n   EnableLMARedirectFunction\n      This configuration variable\
    \ is available in both a MAG and in a\n      rfLMA.  When set to TRUE (i.e., enabled),\
    \ the PMIPv6 node enables\n      the runtime LMA assignment functionality.  The\
    \ default value is\n      FALSE (i.e., disabled).\n   EnableLMARedirectAcceptFunction\n\
    \      This configuration variable is available in a r2LMA.  When set to\n   \
    \   TRUE (i.e., enabled), the r2LMA is able to accept runtime LMA\n      assignment\
    \ mobility sessions from a rfLMA.  The default value is\n      FALSE (i.e., disabled).\n\
    \   Note that the MAG and LMA configuration variables from Sections 9.1\n   and\
    \ 9.2 of [RFC5213] do not apply for an LMA when it is in an rfLMA\n   role.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of PMIPv6 signaling\
    \ described in RFC 5213\n   apply to this document.  An incorrectly configured\
    \ LMA may cause\n   unwanted runtime LMA assignment attempts to non-existing LMAs\
    \ or to\n   other LMAs that do not have and will not have an SA with the MAG.\n\
    \   Consequently, the MAG will experience failed binding updates or\n   unsuccessful\
    \ creation of mobility sessions.  An incorrectly\n   configured LMA may also cause\
    \ biased load distribution within a\n   PMIPv6 domain.  This document also assumes\
    \ that the LMAs that\n   participate in runtime LMA assignment have adequate prior\
    \ agreement\n   and trust relationships between each other.\n   If the SAs between\
    \ MAGs and LMAs are manually keyed (as may be needed\n   by the scenario described\
    \ in Section 5), then the anti-replay service\n   of ESP-protected PMIPv6 traffic\
    \ cannot typically be provided.  This\n   is, however, deployment specific to\
    \ a PMIPv6 domain.\n   If a PMIPv6 domain deployment with a runtime LMA assignment\
    \ requires\n   that a rfLMA has to modify a PBU/PBA in any way, e.g., by changing\n\
    \   the source and destination IP address or any other field of the\n   encapsulating\
    \ IP packet, then the security mechanism (such as\n   possible authentication\
    \ options) used to protect the PBU/PBA MUST NOT\n   cover the outer IP packet\
    \ on those parts that might get modified.\n   Alternatively, the rfLMA can do\
    \ all required security processing on\n   the PBU/PBA, and the communication between\
    \ the rfLMA and the r2LMA\n   would be unprotected at the PMIPv6 protocol level.\
    \  In this case, the\n   runtime assignment domain MUST implement an adequate\
    \ level of\n   security using other means, such as layer-2 VPNs.\n"
