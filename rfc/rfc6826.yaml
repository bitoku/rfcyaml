- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Consider an IP multicast tree, constructed by Protocol Independent\n\
    \   Multicast (PIM), that needs to pass through an MPLS domain in which\n   Multipoint\
    \ LDP (mLDP) point-to-multipoint and/or multipoint-to-\n   multipoint Labels Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs) can be created.  The part of\n   the IP multicast tree that traverses\
    \ the MPLS domain can be\n   instantiated as a multipoint LSP.  When a PIM Join\
    \ message is\n   received at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that\n\
    \   message is encoded into mLDP messages.  When the mLDP messages reach\n   the\
    \ border of the next IP domain, the encoded information is used to\n   generate\
    \ PIM messages that can be sent through the IP domain.  The\n   result is an IP\
    \ multicast tree consisting of a set of IP multicast\n   sub-trees that are spliced\
    \ together with a multipoint LSP.  This\n   document describes procedures regarding\
    \ how IP multicast trees are\n   spliced together with multipoint LSPs.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The mLDP (Multipoint LDP) [RFC6388] specification describes\n\
    \   mechanisms for creating point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-\n  \
    \ multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs (Label Switched Paths).  These LSPs are\n   typically\
    \ used for transporting end-user multicast packets.  However,\n   the mLDP specification\
    \ does not provide any rules for associating\n   particular end-user multicast\
    \ packets with any particular LSP.  Other\n   documents, like [RFC6513], describe\
    \ applications in which out-of-band\n   signaling protocols, such as PIM and BGP,\
    \ are used to establish the\n   mapping between an LSP and the multicast packets\
    \ that need to be\n   forwarded over the LSP.\n   This document describes an application\
    \ in which the information\n   needed to establish the mapping between an LSP\
    \ and the set of\n   multicast packets to be forwarded over it is carried in the\
    \ \"opaque\n   value\" field of an mLDP FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class) element.\n\
    \   When an IP multicast tree (either a source-specific tree or a\n   bidirectional\
    \ tree) enters the MPLS network, the (S,G) or (*,G)\n   information from the IP\
    \ multicast control-plane state is carried in\n   the opaque value field of the\
    \ mLDP FEC message.  As the tree leaves\n   the MPLS network, this information\
    \ is extracted from the FEC Element\n   and used to build the IP multicast control\
    \ plane.  PIM messages can\n   be sent outside the MPLS domain.  Note that although\
    \ the PIM control\n   messages are sent periodically, the mLDP messages are not.\n\
    \   Each IP multicast tree is mapped one-to-one to a P2MP or MP2MP LSP in\n  \
    \ the MPLS network.  A network operator should expect to see as many\n   LSPs\
    \ in the MPLS network as there are IP multicast trees.  A network\n   operator\
    \ should be aware how IP multicast state is created in the\n   network to ensure\
    \ that it does not exceed the scalability numbers of\n   the protocol, either\
    \ PIM or mLDP.\n"

    \ Nodes A and B are IP-multicast-capable routers and connect to a\n   Source/RP\
    \ and a Receiver, respectively.  Nodes U, C, and D are MPLS\n   Label Switched\
    \ Routers (LSRs).\n   LSR D is attached to a network that is capable of MPLS multicast\
    \ and\n   IP multicast (see figure 1), and D is required to create a IP\n   multicast\
    \ tree due to a certain IP multicast event, like a PIM Join,\n   MSDP Source Announcement\
    \ (SA) [RFC3618], BGP Source Active auto-\n   discovery route [SM-MLDP], or Rendezvous\
    \ Point (RP) discovery.\n   Suppose that D can determine that the IP multicast\
    \ tree needs to\n   travel through the MPLS network until it reaches LSR U.  For\n\
    \   instance, when D looks up the route to the Source or RP [RFC4601] of\n   the\
    \ IP multicast tree, it may discover that the route is a BGP route\n   with U\
    \ as the BGP next hop.  Then D may choose to set up a P2MP or an\n   MP2MP LSP,\
    \ with U as root, and to make that LSP become part of the IP\n   multicast distribution\
    \ tree.  Note that other methods are possible to\n   determine that an IP multicast\
    \ tree is to be transported across an\n   MPLS network using P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.\
    \  However, these methods are\n   outside the scope of this document.\n   In order\
    \ to establish a multicast tree via a P2MP or MP2MP LSP using\n   \"in-band signaling\"\
    , LSR D encodes a P2MP or MP2MP FEC Element, with\n   the IP address of LSR U\
    \ as the \"Root Node Address\" and with the\n   source and the group encoded into\
    \ the \"opaque value\" ([RFC6388],\n   Sections 2.2 and 3.2).  Several different\
    \ opaque value types are\n   defined in this document.  LSR D MUST NOT use a particular\
    \ opaque\n   value type unless it knows (through provisioning or through some\n\
    \   other means outside the scope of this document) that LSR U supports\n   the\
    \ root node procedures for that opaque value type.\n   The particular type of\
    \ FEC Element and opaque value used depends on\n   the IP address family being\
    \ used, and on whether the multicast tree\n   being established is a source-specific\
    \ or a bidirectional multicast\n   tree.\n   When an LSR receives a label mapping\
    \ or withdraw whose FEC Element\n   contains one of the opaque value types defined\
    \ in this document, and\n   that LSR is not the one identified by the \"Root Node\
    \ Address\" field\n   of that FEC Element, the LSR follows the procedures provided\
    \ in RFC\n   6388.\n   When an LSR receives a label mapping or withdraw whose\
    \ FEC Element\n   contains one of the opaque value types defined in this document,\
    \ and\n   that LSR is the one identified by the Root Node Address field of that\n\
    \   FEC Element, then the following procedure is executed.  The multicast\n  \
    \ source and group are extracted and passed to the multicast code.  If\n   a label\
    \ mapping is being processed, the multicast code will add the\n   downstream LDP\
    \ neighbor to the olist of the corresponding (S,G) or\n   (*,G) state, creating\
    \ such state if it does not already exist.  If a\n   label withdraw is being processed,\
    \ the multicast code will remove the\n   downstream LDP neighbor from the olist\
    \ of the corresponding (S,G) or\n   (*,G) state.  From this point on, normal PIM\
    \ processing will occur.\n   Note that if the LSR identified by the Root Node\
    \ Address field does\n   not recognize the opaque value type, the MP LSP will\
    \ be established,\n   but the root node will not send any multicast data packets\
    \ on it.\n   Source or RP addresses that are reachable in a VPN context are\n\
    \   outside the scope of this document.\n   Multicast groups that operate in PIM\

    \ from the shared tree without\n   the use of an additional out-of-band signaling\

  - "2.2.  Transiting IP Multicast Source Trees\n   IP multicast source trees can\
    \ be created via PIM operating in either\n   SSM mode [RFC4607] or ASM mode [RFC4601].\
    \  When PIM-SM is used in ASM\n   mode, the usual means of discovering active\

    \ not provide any\n   method of establishing a sparse-mode shared tree across\

    \   mode, there must be some other means of discovering the active\n   sources.\
    \  One possible means is the use of MSDP [RFC3618].  Another\n   possible means\
    \ is to use BGP Source Active auto-discovery routes, as\n   documented in [SM-MLDP].\
    \  However, the method of discovering the\n   active sources is outside the scope\

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Transiting IP Multicast Bidirectional Trees\n   If a bidirectional IP multicast\
    \ tree [RFC5015] has to be transported\n   over an MPLS network using in-band\
    \ signaling, as described in this\n   document, it MUST be transported using an\
    \ MP2MP LSPs.  A\n   bidirectional tree does not have a specific source address;\
    \ the group\n   address, subnet mask, and RP are relevant for multicast forwarding.\n\
    \   This document does not provide procedures to discover RP-to-group\n   mappings\
    \ dynamically across an MPLS network and assumes the RP is\n   statically defined.\
    \  Support of dynamic RP mappings in combination\n   with in-band signaling is\
    \ outside the scope of this document.\n   The RP for the group is used to select\
    \ the ingress LSR and the root\n   of the LSP.  The group address is encoded according\
    \ to the rules of\n   Sections 3.3 or 3.4, depending on the IP version.  The subnet\
    \ mask\n   associated with the bidirectional group is encoded in the Transit\n\
    \   TLV.  There are two types of bidirectional states in IP multicast,\n   the\
    \ group specific state and the RP state.  The first type is\n   typically created\
    \ when a PIM Join has been received and has a subnet\n   mask of 32 for IPv4 and\
    \ 128 for IPv6.  The RP state is typically\n   created via the static RP mapping\
    \ and has a variable subnet mask.\n   The RP state is used to build a tree to\
    \ the RP and is used for\n   sender-only branches.  Each state (group specific\
    \ and RP state) will\n   result in a separate MP2MP LSP.  The merging of the two\
    \ MP2MP LSPs\n   will be done by PIM on the root LSR.  No special procedures are\n\
    \   necessary for PIM to merge the two LSPs.  Each LSP is effectively\n   treated\
    \ as a PIM-enabled interface.  Please see [RFC5015] for more\n   details.\n  \
    \ For transporting the packets of a sender-only branch, we create a\n   MP2MP\
    \ LSP.  Other sender-only branches will receive these packets and\n   will not\
    \ forward them because there are no receivers.  These packets\n   will be dropped.\
    \  If that effect is undesirable, some other means of\n   transport has to be\
    \ established to forward packets to the root of the\n   tree, for example, a multipoint-to-point\
    \ LSP for example.  A\n   technique to unicast packets to the root of a P2MP or\
    \ MP2MP LSP is\n   documented in Section 3.2.2.1 of [MVPN-MSPMSI].\n"
