  - "1.  INTRODUCTION\n   1.1  Internet Standards\n      This memo documents the process\
    \ currently used for the\n      standardization of Internet protocols and procedures.\n\
    \      The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration of\n    \
    \  autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host-to-host\n      communication\
    \ through voluntary adherence to open protocols and\n      procedures defined\
    \ by Internet Standards.  There are also many\n      isolated internets, i.e.,\
    \ sets of interconnected networks, that\n      are not connected to the Internet\
    \ but use the Internet Standards.\n      The architecture and technical specifications\
    \ of the Internet are\n      the result of numerous research and development activities\n\
    \      conducted over a period of two decades, performed by the network\n    \
    \  R&D community, by service and equipment vendors, and by government\n      agencies\
    \ around the world.\n      In general, an Internet Standard is a specification\
    \ that is stable\n      and well-understood, is technically competent, has multiple,\n\
    \      independent, and interoperable implementations with operational\n     \
    \ experience, enjoys significant public support, and is recognizably\n      useful\
    \ in some or all parts of the Internet.\n      The principal set of Internet Standards\
    \ is commonly known as the\n      \"TCP/IP protocol suite\".  As the Internet\
    \ evolves, new protocols\n      and services, in particular those for Open Systems\
    \ Interconnection\n      (OSI), have been and will be deployed in traditional\
    \ TCP/IP\n      environments, leading to an Internet that supports multiple\n\
    \      protocol suites.  This document concerns all protocols,\n      procedures,\
    \ and conventions used in the Internet, not just the\n      TCP/IP protocols.\n\
    \      In outline, the process of creating an Internet Standard is\n      straightforward:\
    \ a specification undergoes a period of development\n      and several iterations\
    \ of review by the Internet community and\n      perhaps revision based upon experience,\
    \ is adopted as a Standard\n      by the appropriate body (see below), and is\
    \ published.\n      In practice, the process is somewhat more complicated, due\
    \ to (1)\n      the number and type of possible sources for specifications; (2)\n\
    \      the need to prepare and revise a specification in a manner that\n     \
    \ preserves the interests of all of the affected parties;  (3) the\n      importance\
    \ of establishing widespread community agreement on its\n      technical content;\
    \ and (4) the difficulty of evaluating the\n      utility of a particular specification\
    \ for the Internet community.\n      Some specifications that are candidates for\
    \ Internet\n      standardization are the result of organized efforts directly\n\
    \      within the Internet community; others are the result of work that\n   \
    \   was not originally organized as an Internet effort, but which was\n      later\
    \ adopted by the Internet community.\n      From its inception, the Internet has\
    \ been, and is expected to\n      remain, an evolving system whose participants\
    \ regularly factor new\n      requirements and technology into the design and\
    \ implementation of\n      the global Internet.  Users of the Internet and providers\
    \ of the\n      equipment, software, and services that support it should\n   \
    \   anticipate and embrace this adaptability as a major tenet of\n      Internet\
    \ philosophy.\n      The procedures described in this document are the result\
    \ of three\n      years of evolution, driven both by the needs of the growing\
    \ and\n      increasingly diverse Internet community, and by experience.\n   \
    \   Comments and suggestions are invited for improvement in these\n      procedures.\n\
    \   1.2  Organization\n      The Internet Activities Board (IAB) is the primary\
    \ coordinating\n      committee for Internet design, engineering, and management\
    \ [1].\n      The IAB has delegated to its Internet Engineering Task Force\n \
    \     (IETF) the primary responsibility for the development and review\n     \
    \ of potential Internet Standards from all sources.  The IETF forms\n      Working\
    \ Groups to pursue specific technical issues, frequently\n      resulting in the\
    \ development of one or more specifications that\n      are proposed for adoption\
    \ as Internet Standards.\n      Final decisions on Internet standardization are\
    \ made by the IAB,\n      based upon recommendations from the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering\n      Group (IESG), the leadership body of the IETF.  IETF Working\n\
    \      Groups are organized into areas, and each area is coordinated by\n    \
    \  an Area Director.  The Area Directors and the IETF Chairman are\n      included\
    \ in the IESG.\n      Any member of the Internet community with the time and interest\
    \ is\n      urged to attend IETF meetings and to participate actively in one\n\
    \      or more IETF Working Groups.  Participation is by individual\n      technical\
    \ contributors, rather than formal representatives of\n      organizations.  The\
    \ process works because the IETF Working Groups\n      display a spirit of cooperation\
    \ as well as a high degree of\n      technical maturity; most IETF members agree\
    \ that the greatest\n      benefit for all members of the Internet community results\
    \ from\n      cooperative development of technically superior protocols and\n\
    \      services.\n      A second body under the IAB, the Internet Research Task\
    \ Force\n      (IRTF), investigates topics considered to be too uncertain, too\n\
    \      advanced, or insufficiently well-understood to be the subject of\n    \
    \  Internet standardization.  When an IRTF activity generates a\n      specification\
    \ that is sufficiently stable to be considered for\n      Internet standardization,\
    \ it is processed through the IETF.\n      Section 2 of this document describes\
    \ the process and rules for\n      Internet standardization.  Section 3 presents\
    \ the nomenclature for\n      different kinds and levels of Internet standard\
    \ technical\n      specifications and their applicability.  Section 4 defines\
    \ how\n      relevant externally-sponsored specifications and practices that\n\
    \      are developed and controlled by other bodies or by vendors are\n      handled\
    \ in the Internet standardization process.  Section 5\n      presents the requirement\
    \ for prior disclosure of the existence of\n      intellectual property rights.\
    \  Section 6 describes the rules for\n      Internet Standards that involve patents.\n"

  - "2.  THE INTERNET STANDARDS PROCESS\n   2.1. Introduction\n      The procedures\
    \ described in this document are intended to provide\n      a clear, open, and\
    \ objective basis for developing, evaluating, and\n      adopting Internet Standards\
    \ for protocols and services.  The\n      procedures provide ample opportunity\
    \ for participation and comment\n      by all interested parties.  Before an Internet\
    \ Standard is\n      adopted, it is repeatedly discussed (and perhaps debated)\
    \ in open\n      open meetings and/or public electronic mailing lists, and it\
    \ is\n      available for review via world-wide on-line directories.\n      These\
    \ procedures are explicitly aimed at developing and adopting\n      generally-accepted\
    \ practices.  Thus, a candidate for Internet\n      standardization is implemented\
    \ and tested for correct operation\n      and interoperability by multiple, independent\
    \ parties, and\n      utilized in increasingly demanding environments, before\
    \ it can be\n      adopted as an Internet Standard.\n      The procedures that\
    \ are described here provide a great deal of\n      flexibility to adapt to the\
    \ wide variety of circumstances that\n      occur in the Internet standardization\
    \ process.  Experience has\n      shown this flexibility to be vital in achieving\
    \ the following\n      goals for Internet standardization:\n      *    high quality,\n\
    \      *    prior implementation and testing,\n      *    openness and fairness,\
    \ and\n      *    timeliness.\n   2.2.  The Internet Standards Track\n      Specifications\
    \ that are destined to become Internet Standards\n      evolve through a set of\
    \ maturity levels known as the \"standards\n      track\".  These maturity levels\
    \ -- \"Proposed Standard\", \"Draft\n      Standard\", and \"Standard\" -- are\
    \ defined and discussed below in\n      Section 3.2.\n      Even after a specification\
    \ has been adopted as an Internet\n      Standard, further evolution often occurs\
    \ based on experience and\n      the recognition of new requirements.  The nomenclature\
    \ and\n      procedures of Internet standardization provide for the replacement\n\
    \      of old Internet Standards with new ones, and the assignment of\n      descriptive\
    \ labels to indicate the status of \"retired\" Internet\n      Standards.  A set\
    \ of maturity levels is defined in Section 3.3 to\n      cover these and other\
    \ \"off-track\" specifications.\n   2.3.  Requests for Comments (RFCs)\n     \
    \ Each distinct version of a specification is published as part of\n      the\
    \ \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) document series.\n      RFCs form a series of\
    \ publications of networking technical\n      documents, begun in 1969 as part\
    \ of the original DARPA wide-area\n      networking (ARPANET) project (see Appendix\
    \ A for glossary of\n      acronyms).  RFCs cover a wide range of topics, from\
    \ early\n      discussion of new research concepts to status memos about the\n\
    \      Internet.  The IAB views the RFC publication process to be\n      sufficiently\
    \ important to warrant including the RFC Editor in the\n      IAB membership.\n\
    \      The status of specifications on the Internet standards track is\n     \
    \ summarized periodically in a summary RFC entitled \"IAB Official\n      Protocol\
    \ Standards\" [2].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and\n      other helpful\
    \ information for each Internet protocol or service\n      specification.\n  \
    \           ********************************************************\n       \
    \      *   The \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" RFC is the   *\n          \
    \   *   authoritative statement of the status of any       *\n             * \
    \  particular Internet specification,                 *\n             ********************************************************\n\
    \      and it is the \"Publication of Record\" with respect to Internet\n    \
    \  standardization.\n      The STD documents form a subseries of the RFC series.\
    \  When a\n      specification has been adopted as a Standard, its RFC is labeled\n\
    \      with a STDxxx number [9] in addition to its RFC number.\n      Not all\
    \ specifications of protocols or services for the Internet\n      should or will\
    \ become Internet Standards.  Such non-standards\n      track specifications are\
    \ not subject to the rules for Internet\n      standardization; generally, they\
    \ will be published directly as\n      RFCs at the discretion of the RFC editor.\
    \  These RFCs will be\n      marked as \"Experimental\" or \"Informational\" (see\
    \ section 3.3).\n             ********************************************************\n\
    \             *   It is important to remember that not all RFCs      *\n     \
    \        *   are standards track documents, and that not all    *\n          \
    \   *   standards track documents reach the level of       *\n             * \
    \  Standard.                                          *\n             ********************************************************\n\
    \   2.4.  Internet Drafts\n      During the development of a specification, draft\
    \ versions of the\n      document are made available for informal review and comment\
    \ by\n      placing them in the IETF's \"Internet Drafts\" directory, which is\n\
    \      replicated on a number of Internet hosts.  This makes an evolving\n   \
    \   working document readily available to a wide audience,\n      facilitating\
    \ the process of review and revision.\n      After completion to the satisfaction\
    \ of its author and the\n      cognizant Working Group, a document that is expected\
    \ to enter or\n      advance in the Internet standardization process shall be\
    \ made\n      available as an Internet Draft.  It shall remain as an Internet\n\
    \      Draft for a period of time that permits useful community review,\n    \
    \  at least two weeks, before submission to the IESG.\n      An Internet Draft\
    \ that is published as an RFC is removed from the\n      Internet Draft directory.\
    \  A document that has remained unchanged\n      in the Internet Drafts directory\
    \ for more than six months without\n      being recommended by the IESG for publication\
    \ as an RFC is simply\n      removed from the Internet Draft directory.  At any\
    \ time, an\n      Internet Draft may be replace by a more recent version of the\
    \ same\n      specification, restarting the six-month timeout period.\n      An\
    \ Internet Draft is NOT a means of \"publishing\" a specification;\n      specifications\
    \ are published through the RFC mechanism described\n      in the next section.\
    \  Internet Drafts have no formal status, and\n      are not part of the permanent\
    \ archival record of Internet\n      activity, and they are subject to change\
    \ or removal at any time.\n      Under no circumstances should an Internet Draft\
    \ be referenced by\n      any paper, report, or Request for Proposal.\n   2.5.\
    \  Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA)\n      Many protocol specifications\
    \ include numbers, keywords, and other\n      parameters that must be uniquely\
    \ assigned.  Examples include\n      version numbers, protocol numbers, port numbers,\
    \ and MIB numbers.\n      The IAB has delegated to the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority\n      (IANA) the task of assigning such protocol parameters for the\n\
    \      Internet.  The IANA publishes tables of all currently assigned\n      numbers\
    \ and parameters in RFCs titled \"Assigned Numbers\" [8].\n      Each category\
    \ of assigned numbers typically arises from some\n      protocol that is on the\
    \ standards track or is an Internet\n      Standard.  For example, TCP port numbers\
    \ are assigned because TCP\n      is a Standard.  A particular value within a\
    \ category may be\n      assigned in a variety of circumstances; the specification\n\
    \      requiring the parameter may be in the standards track, it may be\n    \
    \  Experimental, or it may be private.\n      Chaos could result from accidental\
    \ conflicts of parameter values,\n      so we urge that every protocol parameter,\
    \ for either public or\n      private usage, be explicitly assigned by the IANA.\
    \  Private\n      protocols often become public.  Programmers are often tempted\
    \ to\n      choose a \"random\" value, or guess the next unassigned value of a\n\
    \      parameter; both are hazardous.\n      The IANA is tasked to avoid frivolous\
    \ assignments and to\n      distinguish different assignments uniquely.  The IANA\
    \ accomplishes\n      both goals by requiring a technical description of each\
    \ protocol\n      or service to which a value is to be assigned.  Judgment on\
    \ the\n      adequacy of the description resides with the IANA.  In the case of\n\
    \      a standards track or Experimental protocol, the corresponding\n      technical\
    \ specifications provide the required documentation for\n      IANA.  For a proprietary\
    \ protocol, the IANA will keep confidential\n      any writeup that is supplied,\
    \ but at least a short (2 page)\n      writeup is still required for an assignment.\n\
    \      To contact the IANA for information or to request a number,\n      keyword\
    \ or parameter assignment send an email message to\n      \"iana@isi.edu\".\n\
    \   2.6.  Review and Approval\n      A standards action -- entering a particular\
    \ specification into, or\n      advancing it within, the standards track -- shall\
    \ be recommended\n      to the appropriate IETF Area Director, or to the Chairman\
    \ of the\n      IETF, by the individual or group that is responsible for the\n\
    \      specification.  Usually, the recommendation will come from an IETF\n  \
    \    Working Group.  The Area Director or IETF chairman, in\n      consultation\
    \ with the IESG, shall determine if an independent\n      technical review of\
    \ the specification is required, and shall\n      commission one if necessary.\n\
    \      When a specification is sufficiently important in terms of its\n      potential\
    \ impact on the Internet or on the suite of Internet\n      protocols, the IESG\
    \ shall form a special review and analysis\n      committee to prepare an evaluation\
    \ of the specification.  Such a\n      committee is commissioned to provide an\
    \ objective basis for\n      agreement within the Internet community that the\
    \ specification is\n      ready for advancement.  Furthermore, when the criteria\
    \ for\n      advancement along the standards track for an important class of\n\
    \      specifications (e.g., routing protocols [6]) are not universally\n    \
    \  recognized, the IESG shall commission the development and\n      publication\
    \ of category-specific acceptance criteria.\n      The IESG shall determine whether\
    \ a specification satisfies the\n      applicable criteria for the recommended\
    \ action (see Sections 3.2\n      and 3.3 of this document) and shall communicate\
    \ its findings to\n      the IETF to permit a final review by the general Internet\n\
    \      community.  This IETF notification shall be via electronic mail to\n  \
    \    the IETF mailing list; in addition, there will often be a\n      presentation\
    \ or statement by the appropriate working group or Area\n      Director during\
    \ an IETF plenary meeting.  Any significant issues\n      that have not been resolved\
    \ satisfactorily during the development\n      of the specification may be raised\
    \ at this time for final\n      resolution by the IESG.\n      The IESG shall\
    \ communicate to the IAB its recommendation for\n      action, with a citation\
    \ to the most current version of the\n      document.  The IETF shall be notified\
    \ by email of any such\n      recommendation.  If the IAB finds a significant\
    \ problem, or needs\n      clarification on a particular point, it shall resolve\
    \ the matter\n      with the Working Group and its chairperson and/or the document\n\
    \      author, with the assistance and concurrence of the IESG and the\n     \
    \ relevant IETF Area Director.\n      Following IAB approval and any necessary\
    \ editorial work, the RFC\n      Editor shall publish the specification as an\
    \ RFC.  The\n      specification shall then be removed from the Internet Drafts\n\
    \      directory.\n   2.7.  Entering the Standards Track\n      A specification\
    \ that is potentially an Internet Standard may\n      originate from:\n      (a)\
    \  an IAB-sponsored effort (typically an IETF Working Group),\n      (b)  independent\
    \ activity by individuals, or\n      (c)  an external organization.\n      In\
    \ cases (b) and (c), the work might be tightly integrated with\n      the work\
    \ of an existing IETF Working Group, or it might be offered\n      for standardization\
    \ without prior IETF involvement.  In most\n      cases, a specification resulting\
    \ from an effort that took place\n      outside of an IETF Working Group context\
    \ will be submitted to an\n      appropriate Working Group for evaluation and\
    \ refinement; if\n      necessary, an appropriate Working Group will be created.\n\
    \      For externally-developed specifications that are well-integrated\n    \
    \  with existing Working Group efforts, a Working Group is assumed to\n      afford\
    \ adequate community review of the accuracy and applicability\n      of the specification.\
    \  If a Working Group is unable to resolve all\n      technical and usage questions,\
    \ additional independent review may\n      be necessary.  Such reviews may be\
    \ done within a Working Group\n      context, or by an ad hoc review committee\
    \ established specifically\n      for that purpose.  It is the responsibility\
    \ of the appropriate\n      IETF Area Director to determine what, if any, review\
    \ of an\n      external specification is needed and how it shall be conducted.\n\
    \   2.8.  Advancing in the Standards Track\n      A specification shall remain\
    \ at the Proposed Standard level for at\n      least 6 months and at the Draft\
    \ Standard level for at least 4\n      months.\n      A specification may be (indeed,\
    \ is likely to be) revised as it\n      advances through the standards track.\
    \  At each stage, the IESG\n      shall determine the scope and significance of\
    \ the revision to the\n      specification, and, if necessary and appropriate,\
    \ modify the\n      recommended action.  Minor revisions are expected, and they\
    \ will\n      not affect advancement through the standards track.  A significant\n\
    \      revision may require that the specification accumulate more\n      experience\
    \ at its current maturity level before progressing.\n      Finally, if the specification\
    \ has been changed very significantly,\n      the IESG may decide to treat the\
    \ revision as if it were a new\n      document, re-entering the standards track\
    \ at the beginning.\n      A specification that has not reached the maturity level\
    \ of\n      Standard within twenty-four months of first becoming a Proposed\n\
    \      Standard shall be reviewed for viability by the IESG, which shall\n   \
    \   recommend either termination or continuation of the development\n      effort\
    \ to the IAB.  Such a recommendation shall be communicated to\n      the IETF\
    \ via electronic mail to the IETF mailing list, to allow\n      the Internet community\
    \ an opportunity to comment.  This provision\n      is not intended to threaten\
    \ legitimate and active Working Group\n      efforts, but rather to provide an\
    \ administrative mechanism for\n      terminating a moribund effort.\n   2.9.\
    \  Revising a Standard\n      A recommendation to revise an established Internet\
    \ Standard shall\n      be evaluated by the IESG with respect to the operational\
    \ impact of\n      introducing a new version while the previous version is still\
    \ in\n      use.  If the IESG accepts the recommendation, the new version must\n\
    \      progress through the full Internet standardization process as if\n    \
    \  it were a completely new specification.\n      Once the new version has reached\
    \ the Standard level, it may\n      immediately replace the previous version.\
    \  In some cases, both\n      versions may remain as Internet Standards to honor\
    \ the\n      requirements of an installed base; however, the relationship\n  \
    \    between the previous and the new versions must be explicitly\n      stated\

  - "3.  NOMENCLATURE\n   3.1.  Types of Specifications\n      The specifications\
    \ subject to the Internet standardization process\n      fall into two categories:\
    \  Technical Specifications (TS) and\n      Applicability Statements (AS).\n \
    \     3.1.1.  Technical Specification (TS)\n         A Technical Specification\
    \ is any description of a protocol,\n         service, procedure, convention,\
    \ or format.  It may completely\n         describe all of the relevant aspects\
    \ of its subject, or it may\n         leave one or more parameters or options\
    \ unspecified.  A TS may\n         be completely self-contained, or it may incorporate\
    \ material\n         from other specifications by reference to other documents\n\
    \         (which may or may not be Internet Standards).\n         A TS shall include\
    \ a statement of its scope and the general\n         intent for its use (domain\
    \ of applicability).  Thus, a TS that\n         is inherently specific to a particular\
    \ context shall contain a\n         statement to that effect.  However, a TS does\
    \ not specify\n         requirements for its use within the Internet; these\n\
    \         requirements, which depend on the particular context in which\n    \
    \     the TS is incorporated by different system configurations, is\n        \
    \ defined by an Applicability Statement.\n      3.1.2.  Applicability Statement\
    \ (AS)\n         An Applicability Statement specifies how, and under what\n  \
    \       circumstances, one or more TSs are to be applied to support a\n      \
    \   particular Internet capability. An AS may specify uses for TSs\n         that\
    \ are not Internet Standards, as discussed in Section 4.\n         An AS identifies\
    \ the relevant TSs and the specific way in which\n         they are to be combined,\
    \ and may also specify particular values\n         or ranges of TS parameters\
    \ or subfunctions of a TS protocol\n         that must be implemented.  An AS\
    \ also specifies the\n         circumstances in which the use of a particular\
    \ TS is required,\n         recommended, or elective.\n         An AS may describe\
    \ particular methods of using a TS in a\n         restricted \"domain of applicability\"\
    , such as Internet routers,\n         terminal servers, Internet systems that\
    \ interface to Ethernets,\n         or datagram-based database servers.\n    \
    \     The broadest type of AS is a comprehensive conformance\n         specification,\
    \ commonly called a \"requirements document\", for a\n         particular class\
    \ of Internet systems [3,4,5], such as Internet\n         routers or Internet\
    \ hosts.\n         An AS may not have a higher maturity level in the standards\n\
    \         track than any TS to which the AS applies.  For example, a TS\n    \
    \     at Draft Standard level may be referenced by an AS at the\n         Proposed\
    \ Standard or Draft Standard level, but not an AS at the\n         Standard level.\
    \  Like a TS, an AS does not come into effect\n         until it reaches Standard\
    \ level.\n      Although TSs and ASs are conceptually separate, in practice an\n\
    \      Internet Standard RFC may include elements of both an AS and one\n    \
    \  or more TSs in a single document.  For example, Technical\n      Specifications\
    \ that are developed specifically and exclusively for\n      some particular domain\
    \ of applicability, e.g., for mail server\n      hosts, often contain within a\
    \ single specification all of the\n      relevant AS and TS information.  In such\
    \ cases, no useful purpose\n      would be served by deliberately distributing\
    \ the information among\n      several documents just to preserve the formal AS/TS\
    \ distinction.\n      However, a TS that is likely to apply to more than one domain\
    \ of\n      applicability should be developed in a modular fashion, to\n     \
    \ facilitate its incorporation by multiple ASs.\n   3.2.  Standards Track Maturity\
    \ Levels\n      ASs and TSs go through stages of development, testing, and\n \
    \     acceptance.  Within the Internet standards process, these stages\n     \
    \ are formally labeled \"maturity levels\".\n      This section describes the\
    \ maturity levels and the expected\n      characteristics of specifications at\
    \ each level.  The general\n      procedures for developing a specification and\
    \ processing it\n      through the maturity levels along the standards track were\n\
    \      discussed in Section 2 above.\n      3.2.1. Proposed Standard\n       \
    \  The entry-level maturity for the standards track is \"Proposed\n         Standard\"\
    .  A Proposed Standard specification is generally\n         stable, has resolved\
    \ known design choices, is believed to be\n         well-understood, has received\
    \ significant community review, and\n         appears to enjoy enough community\
    \ interest to be considered\n         valuable.\n         Usually, neither implementation\
    \ nor operational experience is\n         required for the designation of a specification\
    \ as a Proposed\n         Standard.  However, such experience is highly desirable,\
    \ and\n         will usually represent a strong argument in favor of a Proposed\n\
    \         Standard designation.  Furthermore, the IAB may require\n         implementation\
    \ and/or operational experience prior to granting\n         Proposed Standard\
    \ status to a specification that materially\n         affects the core Internet\
    \ protocols or that specifies behavior\n         that may have significant operational\
    \ impact on the Internet.\n         Typically, such a specification will be published\
    \ initially in\n         the Experimental state (see below), which is not part\
    \ of the\n         standards track, and moved to the standards track only after\n\
    \         sufficient implementation or operational experience has been\n     \
    \    obtained.\n         A Proposed Standard should have no known technical omissions\n\
    \         with respect to the requirements placed upon it.  In some\n        \
    \ cases, the IESG may recommend that the requirements be\n         explicitly\
    \ reduced in order to allow a protocol to advance into\n         the Proposed\
    \ Standard state.  This can happen if the\n         specification is considered\
    \ to be useful and necessary (and\n         timely), even absent the missing features.\
    \  For example, some\n         protocols have been advanced by explicitly deciding\
    \ to omit\n         security features at the Proposed Standard level, since an\n\
    \         overall security architecture was still under development.\n      3.2.2.\
    \ Draft Standard\n         A specification from which at least two independent\
    \ and\n         interoperable implementations have been developed, and for\n \
    \        which adequate operational experience has been obtained, may be\n   \
    \      elevated to the \"Draft Standard\" level.  This is a major\n         advance\
    \ in status, indicating a strong belief that the\n         specification is mature\
    \ and will be useful.\n         A Draft Standard must be well-understood and known\
    \ to be quite\n         stable, both in its semantics and as a basis for developing\
    \ an\n         implementation.  A Draft Standard may still require additional\n\
    \         or more widespread field experience, since it is possible for\n    \
    \     implementations based on Draft Standard specifications to\n         demonstrate\
    \ unforeseen behavior when subjected to large-scale\n         use in production\
    \ environments.\n      3.2.3. Standard\n         A specification for which significant\
    \ implementation and\n         operational experience has been obtained may be\
    \ elevated to the\n         Standard level.  A Standard is characterized by a\
    \ high degree\n         of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that\
    \ the\n         specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to\n\
    \         the Internet community.\n   3.3. Non-Standards Track Maturity Levels\n\
    \      Not every TS or AS is on the standards track.  A TS may not be\n      intended\
    \ to be an Internet Standard, or it may be intended for\n      eventual standardization\
    \ but not yet ready to enter the standards\n      track.  A TS or AS may have\
    \ been superseded by more recent\n      Internet Standards, or have otherwise\
    \ fallen into disuse or\n      disfavor.  Such specifications are labeled with\
    \ one of three\n      \"non-standards track\" maturity levels: \"Historic\", \"\
    Experimental\",\n      and \"Informational\".\n      3.3.1. Historic\n       \
    \  A TS or AS that has been superseded by a more recent\n         specification\
    \ or is for any other reason considered to be\n         obsolete is assigned to\
    \ the \"Historic\" level.  (Purists have\n         suggested that the word should\
    \ be \"Historical\"; however, at\n         this point the use of \"Historic\"\
    \ is historical.)\n      3.3.2. Experimental\n         The \"Experimental\" designation\
    \ on a TS permits widespread\n         dissemination (through publication according\
    \ to the procedures\n         defined by this document) with explicit caveats:\
    \  it may\n         specify behavior that has not been thoroughly analyzed or\
    \ is\n         poorly understood;  it may be subject to considerable change;\n\
    \         it may never be a candidate for the formal standards track;\n      \
    \   and it may be discarded in favor of some other proposal.\n         Any TS\
    \ that is not an immediate candidate for Internet\n         standardization is\
    \ appropriate for publication as Experimental.\n         Interested parties are\
    \ thereby given the opportunity to gain\n         experience with implementations\
    \ and to report their findings to\n         the community of interest, but the\
    \ specification is explicitly\n         not recommended for general production\
    \ use.\n      3.3.3. Informational\n         An \"Informational\" specification\
    \ is published for the general\n         information of the Internet community,\
    \ and does not represent\n         an Internet community consensus or recommendation.\n\
    \         Specifications that have been prepared outside of the Internet\n   \
    \      community and are not incorporated into the Internet standards\n      \
    \   process by any of the provisions of Section 4 may be published\n         as\
    \ Informational RFCs, with the permission of the owner.  Such\n         a document\
    \ is not an Internet Standard in any sense.\n   3.4.  Requirement Levels\n   \
    \   An AS may apply one of the following \"requirement levels\" to each\n    \
    \  of the TSs to which it refers:\n      (a)  Required:  Implementation of the\
    \ referenced TS, as specified\n           by the AS, is required to achieve minimal\
    \ conformance.  For\n           example, IP and ICMP must be implemented by all\
    \ Internet\n           systems using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.\n      (b)  Recommended:\
    \  Implementation of the referenced TS is not\n           required for minimal\
    \ conformance, but experience and/or\n           generally accepted technical\
    \ wisdom suggest its desirability\n           in the domain of applicability of\
    \ the AS.  Vendors are\n           strongly encouraged to include the functions,\
    \ features, and\n           protocols of Recommended TSs in their products, and\
    \ should\n           omit them only if the omission is justified by some special\n\
    \           circumstance.\n      (c)  Elective:  Implementation of the referenced\
    \ TS is optional\n           within the domain of applicability of the AS; that\
    \ is, the AS\n           creates no explicit necessity to apply the TS.  However,\
    \ a\n           particular vendor may decide to implement it, or a particular\n\
    \           user may decide that it is a necessity in a specific\n           environment.\n\
    \      As noted in Section 2.5, there are TSs that are not in the\n      standards\
    \ track or that have been retired from the standards\n      track, and are therefore\
    \ not required, recommended, or elective.\n      Two additional \"requirement\
    \ level\" designations are available for\n      such TSs:\n      (d)  Limited\
    \ Use:  The TS is considered appropriate for use only\n           in limited or\
    \ unique circumstances.  For example, the usage\n           of a protocol with\
    \ the \"Experimental\" designation should\n           generally be limited to\
    \ those actively involved with the\n           experiment.\n      (e)  Not Recommended:\
    \  A TS that is considered to be inappropriate\n           for general use is\
    \ labeled \"Not Recommended\".  This may be\n           because of its limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n           historic status.\n      The\
    \ \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" RFC lists a general\n      requirement level\
    \ for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in\n      this section.  In many\
    \ cases, more detailed descriptions of the\n      requirement levels of particular\
    \ protocols and of individual\n      features of the protocols will be found in\
    \ appropriate ASs.\n"
- title: 4.  EXTERNAL STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
  contents:
  - "4.  EXTERNAL STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS\n   Many de facto and de jure standards\
    \ groups other than the IAB/IETF\n   create and publish standards documents for\
    \ network protocols and\n   services.  When these external specifications play\
    \ an important role\n   in the Internet, it is desirable to reach common agreements\
    \ on their\n   usage -- i.e., to establish Internet Standards relating to these\n\
    \   external specifications.\n   There are two categories of external specifications:\n\
    \   (1)  Open Standards\n        Accredited national and international standards\
    \ bodies, such as\n        ANSI, ISO, IEEE, and CCITT, develop a variety of protocol\
    \ and\n        service specifications that are similar to Technical\n        Specifications\
    \ (see glossary in Appendix A).  These\n        specifications are generally de\
    \ jure standards.  Similarly,\n        national and international groups publish\
    \ \"implementors'\n        agreements\" that are analogous to Applicability Statements,\n\
    \        capturing a body of implementation-specific detail concerned\n      \
    \  with the practical application of their standards.\n   (2)  Vendor Specifications\n\
    \        A vendor-specific specification that has come to be widely used\n   \
    \     in the Internet may be treated by the Internet community as a de\n     \
    \   facto \"standard\".  Such a specification is not generally\n        developed\
    \ in an open fashion, is typically proprietary, and is\n        controlled by\
    \ the vendor or vendors that produced it.\n   To avoid conflict between competing\
    \ versions of a specification, the\n   Internet community will not standardize\
    \ a TS or AS that is simply an\n   \"Internet version\" of an existing external\
    \ specification, unless an\n   explicit cooperative arrangement to do so has been\
    \ made.  There are,\n   however, several ways in which an external specification\
    \ that is\n   important for the operation and/or evolution of the Internet may\
    \ be\n   adopted for Internet use:\n   (a)  Incorporation of an Open Standard\n\
    \        An Internet Standard TS or AS may incorporate an open external\n    \
    \    standard by reference.  The reference must be to a specific\n        version\
    \ of the external standard, e.g., by publication date or\n        by edition number,\
    \ according to the prevailing convention of the\n        organization that is\
    \ responsible for the specification.\n        For example, many Internet Standards\
    \ incorporate by reference\n        the ANSI standard character set \"ASCII\"\
    \ [7].\n   (b)  Incorporation of a Vendor Specification\n        Vendor-proprietary\
    \ specifications may also be incorporated, by\n        reference to a specific\
    \ version of the vendor standard.  If the\n        vendor-proprietary specification\
    \ is not widely and readily\n        available, the IAB may request that it be\
    \ published as an\n        Informational RFC.\n        In order for a vendor-proprietary\
    \ specification to be\n        incorporated within the Internet standards process,\
    \ the\n        proprietor must agree in writing to the IAB that \"right to use\"\
    \n        licenses will be available on a non-discriminatory basis and at\n  \
    \      a reasonable cost.  See also Sections 5 and 6.\n        In addition, the\
    \ IAB/IETF will generally not favor a particular\n        vendor's proprietary\
    \ specification over the technically\n        equivalent and competing specifications\
    \ of other vendors by\n        making it \"required\" or \"recommended\".\n  \
    \ (c)  Assumption\n        An IETF Working Group may start with a vendor's (or\
    \ other\n        body's) voluntarily contributed specification, and independently\n\
    \        evolve the specification into a TS or AS.  Here \"independently\"\n \
    \       means that the IETF work is not constrained by conditions\n        imposed\
    \ by the owner of the original specification;  however,\n        the continued\
    \ participation of the original owner in the IETF\n        work is likely to be\
    \ valuable, and is encouraged.  The IAB must\n        receive a formal delegation\
    \ of responsibility from the original\n        owner that gives the IAB/IETF responsibility\
    \ for evolution of\n        the specification.\n   As provided by section 3.1.2,\
    \ an AS that specifies how an external\n   technical specification should be applied\
    \ in the Internet,\n   incorporating the external specification by reference,\
    \ may become an\n   Internet Standard.\n"

  - "APPENDIX B: FUTURE ISSUES\n   This memo resulted from an effort to document the\
    \ current standards\n   procedures in the Internet community.  At the time of\
    \ publication,\n   Sections 5 and 6 are still undergoing legal review.  In addition,\n\
    \   there are important issues under consideration of how to handle\n   copyrights\
    \ and other issues of intellectual property.  This memo is\n   being published\
    \ with these matters unresolved, due to its importance.\n   Pre-publication review\
    \ of this document resulted in a number of\n   useful suggestions from members\
    \ of the Internet community, and opened\n   up several new issues.  The IAB and\
    \ IESG will continue to consider\n   these questions and attempt to resolve these\
    \ issues; the results will\n   be be incorporated in future versions of this memo.\n\
    \   For future reference, this appendix records the outstanding\n   suggestions\
    \ and issues.\n   It has been suggested that additional procedures in the following\n\
    \   areas should be considered.\n   o    Appeals Procedure\n        Should there\
    \ be some formal appeals procedure for correcting\n        abuses or procedural\
    \ failures, at each decision point in the\n        process?\n   o    Tracking\
    \ Procedure\n        Should there be a formal procedure for tracking problems\
    \ and\n        change requests, as a specification moves through the standards\n\
    \        track?  Such a procedure might include written responses, which\n   \
    \     were cataloged and disseminated, or simply a database that\n        listed\
    \ changes between versions.\n   o    Rationale Documentation\n        Should the\
    \ procedures require written documentation of the\n        rationale for the design\
    \ decisions behind each specification at\n        the Draft Standard and Standard\
    \ levels?\n   o    Application-Layer Standards\n        Should there be some way\
    \ to \"standardize\" application-layer\n        protocols that are not going to\
    \ become Internet Standards?\n   There were suggestions for fine-tuning of the\
    \ existing procedures:\n   o    Increase minimum time in Internet Draft directory\
    \ from 2 weeks\n        to 1 month.\n   o    Place explicit time limit, on IESG\
    \ and IAB action on suggested\n        standards changes.  Limits suggested: three\
    \ months.\n        If it were necessary to extend the time for some reason, the\n\
    \        IETF would have to be explicitly notified.\n   o    Change minimum time\
    \ at Draft Standard from 4 to 5 months, to\n        ensure that an IETF meeting\
    \ will intervene.\n   o    There were differing suggestions on how to balance\
    \ between early\n        implementation of specifications available only as Internet\n\
    \        Drafts, and ensuring that everyone is clear that such an\n        Internet\
    \ Draft has no official status and is subject to change\n        at any time.\
    \  One suggestion was that vendors should not claim\n        compliance with an\
    \ Internet Draft.\n   Finally, there were suggestions for improvements in the\
    \ documentation\n   of the standards procedures.\n   o    Discuss the impact,\
    \ if any, of export control laws on the\n        Internet standardization process.\n\
    \        It was observed that the Requirements RFCs contain \"negative\"\n   \
    \     requirement levels: MUST NOT and SHOULD NOT.  Such levels are\n        not\
    \ recognized in this Procedures document.\n   o    Document needs to more clearly\
    \ explain the criteria for choosing\n        the Experimental vs. Informational\
    \ category for an off-track\n        specification.  Ref. sections 3.3.2, 3.3.4.\n\
    \   o    Develop recommended wording for citations to Internet Drafts,\n     \
    \   which makes clear the provisional, unofficial nature of that\n        document.\n\
    \   o    Consider changing the name attached to a fully-adopted standard\n   \
    \     from \"Standard\" to some qualified term like \"Full Standard\".\n   o \
    \   It has been suggested that the document should more strongly\n        encourage\
    \ the use of specifications from other standards bodies,\n        with Internet-specific\
    \ changes to be made only for compelling\n        reasons.  Further, the justification\
    \ of the compelling\n        requirement would be subject to special review.\n"
