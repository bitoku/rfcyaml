  - "3.0 IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format\n   This document proposes\
    \ assignment rules for the TLA ID and NLA ID\n   fields in the IPv6 Aggregatable\
    \ Global Unicast Address Format.  This\n   address format is designed to support\
    \ both the current provider-based\n   aggregation and a new type of exchange-based\
    \ aggregation.  The\n   combination will allow efficient routing aggregation for\
    \ sites that\n   connect directly to providers and for sites that connect to\n\
    \   exchanges.  Sites will have the choice to connect to either type of\n   aggregation\
    \ entity.\n   While this address format is designed to support exchange-based\n\
    \   aggregation (in addition to current provider-based aggregation) it is\n  \
    \ not dependent on exchanges for its overall route aggregation\n   properties.\
    \  It will provide efficient route aggregation with only\n   provider-based aggregation.\n\

- title: 4.0 Technical Motivation
  contents:
  - "4.0 Technical Motivation\n   The design choices for the size of the fields in\
    \ the aggregatable\n   address format were based on the need to meet a number\
    \ of technical\n   requirements that are described in [AGGR].  An extract of the\n\
    \   technical requirements from [AGGR] is as follows:\n      The size of the Top-Level\
    \ Aggregation Identifier is 13 bits.  This\n      allows for 8,192 TLA ID's. \
    \ This size was chosen to insure that\n      the default-free routing table in\
    \ top level routers in the\n      Internet is kept within the limits, with a reasonable\
    \ margin, of\n      the current routing technology.  The margin is important because\n\
    \      default-free routers will also carry a significant number of\n      longer\
    \ (i.e., more-specific) prefixes for optimizing paths\n      internal to a TLA\
    \ and between TLAs.\n      The important issue is not only the size of the default-free\n\
    \      routing table, but the complexity of the topology that determines\n   \
    \   the number of copies of the default-free routes that a router must\n     \
    \ examine while computing a forwarding table.  In current practice\n      with\
    \ IPv4, it is common to see a prefix announced fifteen times\n      via different\
    \ paths.  The complexity of Internet topology is very\n      likely to increase\
    \ in the future.  It is important that IPv6\n      default-free routing support\
    \ additional complexity as well as a\n      considerably larger internet.\n  \
    \    It should be noted for comparison that the current IPv4 default-\n      free\
    \ routing table is approximately 50,000 prefixes.  While this\n      shows that\
    \ it is possible to support more routes than 8,192 it is\n      matter of debate\
    \ if the number of prefixes supported today in IPv4\n      is already too high\
    \ for current routing technology.  There are\n      serious issues of route stability\
    \ as well as cases of providers\n      not supporting all top level prefixes.\
    \  The technical requirement\n      was to pick a TLA ID size that was below,\
    \ with a reasonable\n      margin, what was being done with IPv4.\n      The choice\
    \ of 13 bits for the TLA field was an engineering\n      compromise.  Fewer bits\
    \ would have been too small by not\n      supporting enough top level organizations.\
    \  More bits would have\n      exceeded what can be reasonably accommodated, with\
    \ a reasonable\n      margin, with current routing technology in order to deal\
    \ with the\n      issues described in the previous paragraphs.\n      If in the\
    \ future, routing technology improves to support a larger\n      number of top\
    \ level routes in the default-free routing tables\n      there are two choices\
    \ on how to increase the number TLA\n      identifiers.  The first is to expand\
    \ the TLA ID field into the\n      reserved field.  This would increase the number\
    \ of TLA ID's to\n      approximately 2 million.  The second approach is to allocate\n\
    \      another format prefix (FP) for use with this address format.\n      Either\
    \ or a combination of these approaches allows the number of\n      TLA ID's to\
    \ increase significantly.\n      The size of the Reserved field is 8 bits.  This\
    \ size was chosen to\n      allow significant growth of either the TLA ID and/or\
    \ the NLA ID\n      fields.\n      The size of the Next-Level Aggregation Identifier\
    \ field is 24\n      bits.  This allows for approximately sixteen million NLA\
    \ ID's if\n      used in a flat manner.  Used hierarchically it allows for a\n\
    \      complexity roughly equivalent to the IPv4 address space (assuming\n   \
    \   an average network size of 254 interfaces).  If in the future\n      additional\
    \ room for complexity is needed in the NLA ID, this may\n      be accommodated\
    \ by extending the NLA ID into the Reserved field.\n      The size of the Site-Level\
    \ Aggregation Identifier field is 16\n      bits.  This supports 65,535 individual\
    \ subnets per site.  The\n      design goal for the size of this field was to\
    \ be sufficient for\n      all but the largest of organizations.  Organizations\
    \ which need\n      additional subnets can arrange with the organization they\
    \ are\n      obtaining Internet service from to obtain additional site\n     \
    \ identifiers and use this to create additional subnets.\n      The Site-Level\
    \ Aggregation Identifier field was given a fixed size\n      in order to force\
    \ the length of all prefixes identifying a\n      particular site to be the same\
    \ length (i.e., 48 bits).  This\n      facilitates movement of sites in the topology\
    \ (e.g., changing\n      service providers and multi-homing to multiple service\
    \ providers).\n      The Interface ID Interface Identifier field is 64 bits. \
    \ This size\n      was chosen to meet the requirement specified in [ARCH] to support\n\
    \      EUI-64 based Interface Identifiers.\n   The proposed TLA/NLA assignment\
    \ rules described in this document are\n   consistent with these technical requirements.\n\
    \   The specific technical motivation for the proposed TLA/NLA assignment\n  \
    \ rules described in this document is as follows:\n    - Limit the number of top\
    \ level prefixes in the Internet to a\n      manageable size.  This is important\
    \ to insure that the default-\n      free routing table in the top level routers\
    \ in the Internet is\n      kept within the limits, with a reasonable margin,\
    \ of current\n      routing technology.\n    - Only assign top level prefixes\
    \ to transit providers, not to leaf\n      sites even if they are multiply homed.\
    \  The aggregation address\n      format is designed to have a clear separation\
    \ between transit\n      providers and leaf sites.  Sites which wish to be multihomed\
    \ to\n      multiple transit providers have in IPv6 a number of alternatives\n\
    \      to having a top level prefix.\n    - Only assign top level prefixes to\
    \ organizations who are capable\n      and intend to provide operational IPv6\
    \ transit services within\n      three months of assignment.  The goal is to not\
    \ assign top level\n      prefixes to organizations who only want a prefix in\
    \ case they\n      might provide service sometime in the future.  The assignment\
    \ of\n      prefixes is intended to closely match the operational IPv6\n     \
    \ Internet and to be consistent with the current practice of\n      registries\
    \ making assignments when addresses are actually used.\n    - Organizations assigned\
    \ TLA ID's are required to make all the\n      assignments publically available.\
    \  This is necessary in order for\n      the registries to have accurate information\
    \ on assignments and to\n      enable trouble shooting Internet problems.\n  \
    \  - Allocation of prefixes that are consistent with the address format\n    \
    \  in [AGGR].  Specifically the allocation prefixes that are not\n      longer\
    \ than 48 bits as to not infringe into the SLA and Interface\n      Identifier\
    \ fields.  This is to facilitate movement of sites in the\n      topology (e.g.,\
    \ changing service providers and multi-homing to\n      multiple service providers).\n"

  - "5.1 Proposed TLA Allocation Stages\n   TLA allocations will be done in two stages.\
    \  The first stage is to\n   allocate a Sub-TLA ID.  When the recipient has demonstrated\

  - "5.2 Proposed Assignment Requirements\n   The proposed assignment requirements\
    \ are intended as input from the\n   IPng working group to the IANA and Registries.\
    \  It is not intended\n   for any official IETF status.\n   Registries enforce\
    \ the following requirements for organizations\n   assigned Sub-TLA and TLA ID's:\n\
    \   1) Must have a plan to offer native IPv6 service within 3 months from\n  \
    \    assignment.  The plan must include NLA ID allocation and\n      registration\
    \ procedures.  NLA ID allocation and registration may\n      be subcontracted\
    \ to other organizations such as a registry.\n      Native IPv6 service is defined\
    \ as providing IPv6 service as\n      defined in the appropriate \"IPv6 over <link>\"\
    \ specification such\n      as \"IPv6 over Ethernet\" [ETHER], \"IPv6 over FDDI\"\
    \ [FDDI], etc.,\n      for the link at the boundary of the organization.  This\
    \ should\n      include running Neighbor Discovery (as appropriate) and exchanging\n\
    \      IPv6 routing information.  The method the organization uses to\n      carry\
    \ IPv6 traffic across its network is independent of this\n      definition and\
    \ is a local issue for the organization.\n   2) Must have a verifiable track record\
    \ of providing Internet transit\n      to other organizations.  Sub-TLA and/or\
    \ TLA ID's must not be\n      assigned to organizations that are only providing\
    \ leaf service\n      even if multihomed.\n      Verification of an organization's\
    \ track record in providing\n      Internet transit service must be verified by\
    \ techniques such as\n      traceroute, BGP advertisements, etc.\n   3) Payment\
    \ of a registration fee to the Internet Assigned Numbers\n      Authority (IANA).\
    \  Registries may also charge some fee for\n      services rendered, generally\
    \ in relation to the cost of providing\n      those services.  All payment of\
    \ registration and service fees must\n      be made prior to the actual Sub-TLA\
    \ ID and/or TLA ID assignment.\n   4) Must provide registry services for the NLA\
    \ ID address space it is\n      responsible for under its Sub-TLA ID and/or TLA\
    \ ID.  This must\n      include both sites and next level providers.  The database\
    \ of NLA\n      assignments must be public and made available to the registries.\n\
    \   5) Periodically (interval set by registry) provide to registry\n      utilization\
    \ statistics of the Sub-TLA ID and/or TLA ID it has\n      custody of.  The organization\
    \ must also show evidence of carrying\n      TLA routing and transit traffic.\
    \  This can be in the form of\n      traffic statistics, traceroutes, routing\
    \ table dumps, or similar\n      means.\n   6) Organizations requesting another\
    \ Sub-TLA and/or TLA ID must show\n      evidence to the registries that they\
    \ have assigned more than 90%\n      of the NLA ID space in their previous allocations.\n\
    \   Organizations which are given custody of a Sub-TLA ID and/or TLA ID,\n   and\
    \ fail to continue to meet all the above requirements may have the\n   Sub-TLA\
    \ ID and/or TLA ID custody revoked.\n"
