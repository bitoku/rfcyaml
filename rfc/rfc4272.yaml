  - "1.  Introduction\n   The inter-domain routing protocol BGP was created when the\
    \ Internet\n   environment had not yet reached the present, contentious state.\n\
    \   Consequently, the BGP design did not include protections against\n   deliberate\
    \ or accidental errors that could cause disruptions of\n   routing behavior.\n\
    \   This document discusses the vulnerabilities of BGP, based on the BGP\n   specification\
    \ [RFC4271].  Readers are expected to be familiar with\n   the BGP RFC and the\
    \ behavior of BGP.\n   It is clear that the Internet is vulnerable to attack through\
    \ its\n   routing protocols and BGP is no exception.  Faulty, misconfigured, or\n\
    \   deliberately malicious sources can disrupt overall Internet behavior\n   by\
    \ injecting bogus routing information into the BGP-distributed\n   routing database\
    \ (by modifying, forging, or replaying BGP packets).\n   The same methods can\
    \ also be used to disrupt local and overall\n   network behavior by breaking the\
    \ distributed communication of\n   information between BGP peers.  The sources\
    \ of bogus information can\n   be either outsiders or true BGP peers.\n   Cryptographic\
    \ authentication of peer-peer communication is not an\n   integral part of BGP.\
    \  As a TCP/IP protocol, BGP is subject to all\n   TCP/IP attacks, e.g., IP spoofing,\
    \ session stealing, etc.  Any\n   outsider can inject believable BGP messages\
    \ into the communication\n   between BGP peers, and thereby inject bogus routing\
    \ information or\n   break the peer-peer connection.  Any break in the peer-peer\n\
    \   communication has a ripple effect on routing that can be widespread.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ outsider sources can also disrupt communications between\n   BGP peers by breaking\
    \ their TCP connection with spoofed packets.\n   Outsider sources of bogus BGP\
    \ information can reside anywhere in the\n   world.\n   Consequently, the current\
    \ BGP specification requires that a BGP\n   implementation must support the authentication\
    \ mechanism specified in\n   [TCPMD5].  However, the requirement for support of\
    \ that\n   authentication mechanism cannot ensure that the mechanism is\n   configured\
    \ for use.  The mechanism of [TCPMD5] is based on a pre-\n   installed, shared\
    \ secret; it does not have the capability of IPsec\n   [IPsec] to agree on a shared\
    \ secret dynamically.  Consequently, the\n   use of [TCPMD5] must be a deliberate\
    \ decision, not an automatic\n   feature or a default.\n   The current BGP specification\
    \ also allows for implementations that\n   would accept connections from \"unconfigured\
    \ peers\" ([RFC4271] Section\n   8).  However, the specification is not clear\
    \ as to what an\n   unconfigured peer might be, or how the protections of [TCPMD5]\
    \ would\n   apply in such a case.  Therefore, it is not possible to include an\n\
    \   analysis of the security issues of this feature.  When a\n   specification\
    \ that describes this feature more fully is released, a\n   security analysis\
    \ should be part of that specification.\n   BGP speakers themselves can inject\
    \ bogus routing information, either\n   by masquerading as any other legitimate\
    \ BGP speaker, or by\n   distributing unauthorized routing information as themselves.\n\
    \   Historically, misconfigured and faulty routers have been responsible\n   for\
    \ widespread disruptions in the Internet.  The legitimate BGP peers\n   have the\
    \ context and information to produce believable, yet bogus,\n   routing information,\
    \ and therefore have the opportunity to cause\n   great damage.  The cryptographic\
    \ protections of [TCPMD5] and\n   operational protections cannot exclude the bogus\
    \ information arising\n   from a legitimate peer.  The risk of disruptions caused\
    \ by legitimate\n   BGP speakers is real and cannot be ignored.\n   Bogus routing\
    \ information can have many different effects on routing\n   behavior.  If the\
    \ bogus information removes routing information for a\n   particular network,\
    \ that network can become unreachable for the\n   portion of the Internet that\
    \ accepts the bogus information.  If the\n   bogus information changes the route\
    \ to a network, then packets\n   destined for that network may be forwarded by\
    \ a sub-optimal path, or\n   by a path that does not follow the expected policy,\
    \ or by a path that\n   will not forward the traffic.  Consequently, traffic to\
    \ that network\n   could be delayed by a path that is longer than necessary. \
    \ The\n   network could become unreachable from areas where the bogus\n   information\
    \ is accepted.  Traffic might also be forwarded along a\n   path that permits\
    \ some adversary to view or modify the data.  If the\n   bogus information makes\
    \ it appear that an autonomous system\n   originates a network when it does not,\
    \ then packets for that network\n   may not be deliverable for the portion of\
    \ the Internet that accepts\n   the bogus information.  A false announcement that\
    \ an autonomous\n   systems originates a network may also fragment aggregated\
    \ address\n   blocks in other parts of the Internet and cause routing problems\
    \ for\n   other networks.\n   The damages that might result from these attacks\
    \ include:\n      starvation: Data traffic destined for a node is forwarded to\
    \ a\n      part of the network that cannot deliver it.\n      network congestion:\
    \ More data traffic is forwarded through some\n      portion of the network than\
    \ would otherwise need to carry the\n      traffic.\n      blackhole: Large amounts\
    \ of traffic are directed to be forwarded\n      through one router that cannot\
    \ handle the increased level of\n      traffic and drops many/most/all packets.\n\
    \      delay: Data traffic destined for a node is forwarded along a path\n   \
    \   that is in some way inferior to the path it would otherwise take.\n      looping:\
    \ Data traffic is forwarded along a path that loops, so\n      that the data is\
    \ never delivered.\n      eavesdrop: Data traffic is forwarded through some router\
    \ or\n      network that would otherwise not see the traffic, affording an\n \
    \     opportunity to see the data.\n      partition: Some portion of the network\
    \ believes that it is\n      partitioned from the rest of the network, when, in\
    \ fact, it is\n      not.\n      cut: Some portion of the network believes that\
    \ it has no route to\n      some network to which it is, in fact, connected.\n\
    \      churn: The forwarding in the network changes at a rapid pace,\n      resulting\
    \ in large variations in the data delivery patterns (and\n      adversely affecting\
    \ congestion control techniques).\n      instability: BGP becomes unstable in\
    \ such a way that convergence\n      on a global forwarding state is not achieved.\n\
    \      overload: The BGP messages themselves become a significant portion\n  \
    \    of the traffic the network carries.\n      resource exhaustion: The BGP messages\
    \ themselves cause exhaustion\n      of critical router resources, such as table\
    \ space.\n      address-spoofing: Data traffic is forwarded through some router\
    \ or\n      network that is spoofing the legitimate address, thus enabling an\n\
    \      active attack by affording the opportunity to modify the data.\n   These\
    \ consequences can fall exclusively on one end-system prefix or\n   may effect\
    \ the operation of the network as a whole.\n"

- title: 2.  Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.  Attacks\n   BGP, in and of itself, is subject to the following attacks. \
    \ (The\n   list is taken from the IAB RFC that provides guidelines for the\n \
    \  \"Security Considerations\" section of RFCs [SecCons].)\n      confidentiality\
    \ violations:  The routing data carried in BGP is\n      carried in cleartext,\
    \ so eavesdropping is a possible attack\n      against routing data confidentiality.\
    \  (Routing data\n      confidentiality is not a common requirement.)\n      replay:\
    \  BGP does not provide for replay protection of its\n      messages.\n      message\
    \ insertion:  BGP does not provide protection against\n      insertion of messages.\
    \  However, because BGP uses TCP, when the\n      connection is fully established,\
    \ message insertion by an outsider\n      would require accurate sequence number\
    \ prediction (not entirely\n      out of the question, but more difficult with\
    \ mature TCP\n      implementations) or session-stealing attacks.\n      message\
    \ deletion:  BGP does not provide protection against\n      deletion of messages.\
    \  Again, this attack is more difficult\n      against a mature TCP implementation,\
    \ but is not entirely out of\n      the question.\n      message modification:\
    \  BGP does not provide protection against\n      modification of messages.  A\
    \ modification that was syntactically\n      correct and did not change the length\
    \ of the TCP payload would in\n      general not be detectable.\n      man-in-the-middle:\
    \  BGP does not provide protection against man-\n      in-the-middle attacks.\
    \  As BGP does not perform peer entity\n      authentication, a man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack is child's play.\n      denial of service:  While bogus routing data\
    \ can present a denial\n      of service attack on the end systems that are trying\
    \ to transmit\n      data through the network and on the network infrastructure\
    \ itself,\n      certain bogus information can represent a denial of service on\
    \ the\n      BGP routing protocol.  For example, advertising large numbers of\n\
    \      more specific routes (i.e., longer prefixes) can cause BGP traffic\n  \
    \    and router table size to increase, even explode.\n   The mandatory-to-support\
    \ mechanism of [TCPMD5] will counter message\n   insertion, deletion, and modification,\
    \ man-in-the-middle and denial\n   of service attacks from outsiders.  The use\
    \ of [TCPMD5] does not\n   protect against eavesdropping attacks, but routing\
    \ data\n   confidentiality is not a goal of BGP.  The mechanism of [TCPMD5] does\n\
    \   not protect against replay attacks, so the only protection against\n   replay\
    \ is provided by the TCP sequence number processing.  Therefore,\n   a replay\
    \ attack could be mounted against a BGP connection protected\n   with [TCPMD5]\
    \ but only in very carefully timed circumstances.  The\n   mechanism of [TCPMD5]\
    \ cannot protect against bogus routing\n   information that originates from an\
    \ insider.\n"
- title: 3.  Vulnerabilities and Risks
  contents:
  - "3.  Vulnerabilities and Risks\n   The risks in BGP arise from three fundamental\
    \ vulnerabilities:\n   (1)  BGP has no internal mechanism that provides strong\
    \ protection of\n        the integrity, freshness, and peer entity authenticity\
    \ of the\n        messages in peer-peer BGP communications.\n   (2)  no mechanism\
    \ has been specified within BGP to validate the\n        authority of an AS to\
    \ announce NLRI information.\n   (3)  no mechanism has been specified within BGP\
    \ to ensure the\n        authenticity of the path attributes announced by an AS.\n\
    \   The first fundamental vulnerability motivated the mandated support of\n  \
    \ [TCPMD5] in the BGP specification.  When the support of [TCPMD5] is\n   employed,\
    \ message integrity and peer entity authentication are\n   provided.  The mechanism\
    \ of [TCPMD5] assumes that the MD5 algorithm\n   is secure and that the shared\
    \ secret is protected and chosen to be\n   difficult to guess.\n   In the discussion\
    \ that follows, the vulnerabilities are described in\n   terms of the BGP Finite\

- title: 3.1.  Vulnerabilities in BGP Messages
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Vulnerabilities in BGP Messages\n   There are four different BGP message\
    \ types - OPEN, KEEPALIVE,\n   NOTIFICATION, and UPDATE.  This section contains\
    \ a discussion of the\n   vulnerabilities arising from each message and the ability\
    \ of\n   outsiders or BGP peers to exploit the vulnerabilities.  To summarize,\n\
    \   outsiders can use bogus OPEN, KEEPALIVE, NOTIFICATION, or UPDATE\n   messages\
    \ to disrupt the BGP peer-peer connections.  They can use\n   bogus UPDATE messages\
    \ to disrupt routing without breaking the peer-\n   peer connection.  Outsiders\
    \ can also disrupt BGP peer-peer\n   connections by inserting bogus TCP packets\
    \ that disrupt the TCP\n   connection processing.  In general, the ability of\
    \ outsiders to use\n   bogus BGP and TCP messages is limited, but not eliminated,\
    \ by the TCP\n   sequence number processing.  The use of [TCPMD5] can counter\
    \ these\n   outsider attacks.  BGP peers themselves are permitted to break peer-\n\
    \   peer connections, at any time, using NOTIFICATION messages.  Thus,\n   there\
    \ is no additional risk of broken connections through their use\n   of OPEN, KEEPALIVE,\
    \ or UPDATE messages.  However, BGP peers can\n   disrupt routing (in impermissible\
    \ ways) by issuing UPDATE messages\n   that contain bogus routing information.\
    \  In particular, bogus\n   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE, NEXT_HOP and AS_PATH attributes\
    \ and bogus NLRI in\n   UPDATE messages can disrupt routing.  The use of [TCPMD5]\
    \ will not\n   counter these attacks from BGP peers.\n   Each message introduces\
    \ certain vulnerabilities and risks, which are\n   discussed in the following\
    \ sections.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Message Header
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Message Header\n   Event 21:  Each BGP message starts with a standard\
    \ header.  In all\n   cases, syntactic errors in the message header will cause\
    \ the BGP\n   speaker to close the connection, release all associated BGP\n  \
    \ resources, delete all routes learned through that connection, run its\n   decision\
    \ process to decide on new routes, and cause the state to\n   return to Idle.\
    \  Also, optionally, an implementation-specific peer\n   oscillation damping may\
    \ be performed.  The peer oscillation damping\n   process can affect how soon\
    \ the connection can be restarted.  An\n   outsider who could spoof messages with\
    \ message header errors could\n   cause disruptions in routing over a wide area.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  OPEN
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  OPEN\n   Event 19:  Receipt of an OPEN message in states Connect or Active\n\
    \   will cause the BGP speaker to bring down the connection, release all\n   associated\
    \ BGP resources, delete all associated routes, run its\n   decision process, and\
    \ cause the state to return to Idle.  The\n   deletion of routes can cause a cascading\
    \ effect in which routing\n   changes propagate through other peers.  Also, optionally,\
    \ an\n   implementation-specific peer oscillation damping may be performed.\n\
    \   The peer oscillation damping process can affect how soon the\n   connection\
    \ can be restarted.\n   In state OpenConfirm or Established, the arrival of an\
    \ OPEN may\n   indicate a connection collision has occurred.  If this connection\
    \ is\n   to be dropped, then Event 23 will be issued.  (Event 23, discussed\n\
    \   below, results in the same set of disruptive actions as mentioned\n   above\
    \ for states Connect or Active.)\n   In state OpenSent, the arrival of an OPEN\
    \ message will cause the BGP\n   speaker to transition to the OpenConfirm state.\
    \  If an outsider was\n   able to spoof an OPEN message (requiring very careful\
    \ timing), then\n   the later arrival of the legitimate peer's OPEN message might\
    \ lead\n   the BGP speaker to declare a connection collision.  The collision\n\
    \   detection procedure may cause the legitimate connection to be\n   dropped.\n\
    \   Consequently, the ability of an outsider to spoof this message can\n   lead\
    \ to a severe disruption of routing over a wide area.\n   Event 20:  If an OPEN\
    \ message arrives when the DelayOpen timer is\n   running when the connection\
    \ is in state OpenSent, OpenConfirm or\n   Established, the BGP speaker will bring\
    \ down the connection, release\n   all associated BGP resources, delete all associated\
    \ routes, run its\n   decision process, and cause the state to return to Idle.\
    \  The\n   deletion of routes can cause a cascading effect in which routing\n\
    \   changes propagate through other peers.  Also, optionally, an\n   implementation-specific\
    \ peer oscillation damping may be performed.\n   The peer oscillation damping\
    \ process can affect how soon the\n   connection can be restarted.  However, because\
    \ the OpenDelay timer\n   should never be running in these states, this effect\
    \ could only be\n   caused by an error in the implementation (a NOTIFICATION is\
    \ sent with\n   the error code \"Finite State Machine Error\").  It would be difficult,\n\
    \   if not impossible, for an outsider to induce this Finite State\n   Machine\
    \ error.\n   In states Connect and Active, this event will cause a transition\
    \ to\n   the OpenConfirm state.  As in Event 19, if an outsider were able to\n\
    \   spoof an OPEN, which arrived while the DelayOpen timer was running,\n   then\
    \ a later arriving OPEN (from the legitimate peer) might be\n   considered a connection\
    \ collision and the legitimate connection could\n   be dropped.\n   Consequently,\
    \ the ability of an outsider to spoof this message can\n   lead to a severe disruption\
    \ of routing over a wide area.\n   Event 22:  Errors in the OPEN message (e.g.,\
    \ unacceptable Hold state,\n   malformed Optional Parameter, unsupported version,\
    \ etc.) will cause\n   the BGP speaker to bring down the connection, release all\
    \ associated\n   BGP resources, delete all associated routes, run its decision\n\
    \   process, and cause the state to return to Idle.  The deletion of\n   routes\
    \ can cause a cascading effect in which routing changes\n   propagate through\
    \ other peers.  Also, optionally, an implementation-\n   specific peer oscillation\
    \ damping may be performed.  The peer\n   oscillation damping process can affect\
    \ how soon the connection can be\n   restarted.  Consequently, the ability of\

- title: 3.1.5.3.  Path Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.1.5.3.  Path Attributes\n   The path attributes present many different vulnerabilities\
    \ and risks.\n   o  Attribute Flags, Attribute Type Codes, Attribute Length\n\
    \      A BGP peer or an outsider could modify the attribute length or\n      attribute\
    \ type (flags and type codes) not to reflect the attribute\n      values that\
    \ followed.  If the flags were modified, the flags and\n      type code could\
    \ become incompatible (i.e., a mandatory attribute\n      marked as partial),\
    \ or an optional attribute could be interpreted\n      as a mandatory attribute\
    \ or vice versa.  If the type code were\n      modified, the attribute value could\
    \ be interpreted as if it were\n      the data type and value of a different attribute.\n\
    \      The most likely result from modifying the attribute length, flags,\n  \
    \    or type code would be a parse error of the UPDATE message.  A\n      parse\
    \ error would cause the transmission of a NOTIFICATION message\n      and the\
    \ close of the connection (see Event 28, above).  As a true\n      BGP speaker\
    \ is able to close a connection at any time, this\n      vulnerability represents\
    \ an additional risk only when the source\n      is an outsider, i.e., it presents\
    \ no additional risk from a BGP\n      peer.\n   o  ORIGIN\n      This field indicates\
    \ whether the information was learned from IGP\n      or EGP information.  This\
    \ field is used in making routing\n      decisions, so there is some small vulnerability\
    \ of being able to\n      affect the receiving BGP speaker's routing decision\
    \ by modifying\n      this field.\n   o  AS_PATH\n      A BGP peer or outsider\
    \ could announce an AS_PATH that was not\n      accurate for the associated NLRI.\n\
    \      Because a BGP peer might not verify that a received AS_PATH begins\n  \
    \    with the AS number of its peer, a malicious BGP peer could\n      announce\
    \ a path that begins with the AS of any BGP speaker, with\n      little impact\
    \ on itself.  This could affect the receiving BGP\n      speaker's decision procedure\
    \ and choice of installed route.  The\n      malicious peer could considerably\
    \ shorten the AS_PATH, which will\n      increase that route's chances of being\
    \ chosen, possibly giving the\n      malicious peer access to traffic it would\
    \ otherwise not receive.\n      The shortened AS_PATH also could result in routing\
    \ loops, as it\n      does not contain the information needed to prevent loops.\n\
    \      It is possible for a BGP speaker to be configured to accept routes\n  \
    \    with its own AS number in the AS path.  Such operational\n      considerations\
    \ are defined to be \"outside the scope\" of the BGP\n      specification.  But\
    \ because AS_PATHs can legitimately have loops,\n      implementations cannot\
    \ automatically reject routes with loops.\n      Each BGP speaker verifies only\
    \ that its own AS number does not\n      appear in the AS_PATH.\n      Coupled\
    \ with the ability to use any value for the NEXT_HOP, this\n      provides a malicious\
    \ BGP speaker considerable control over the\n      path traffic will take.\n \
    \  o  Originating Routes\n      A special case of announcing a false AS_PATH occurs\
    \ when the\n      AS_PATH advertises a direct connection to a specific network\n\
    \      address.  A BGP peer or outsider could disrupt routing to the\n      network(s)\
    \ listed in the NLRI field by falsely advertising a\n      direct connection to\
    \ the network.  The NLRI would become\n      unreachable to the portion of the\
    \ network that accepted this false\n      route, unless the ultimate AS on the\
    \ AS_PATH undertook to tunnel\n      the packets it was forwarded for this NLRI\
    \ toward their true\n      destination AS by a valid path.  But even when the\
    \ packets are\n      tunneled to the correct destination AS, the route followed\
    \ may not\n      be optimal, or may not follow the intended policy.  Additionally,\n\
    \      routing for other networks in the Internet could be affected if\n     \
    \ the false advertisement fragmented an aggregated address block,\n      forcing\
    \ the routers to handle (issue UPDATES, store, manage) the\n      multiple fragments\
    \ rather than the single aggregate.  False\n      originations for multiple addresses\
    \ can result in routers and\n      transit networks along the announced route\
    \ to become flooded with\n      misdirected traffic.\n   o  NEXT_HOP\n      The\
    \ NEXT_HOP attribute defines the IP address of the border router\n      that should\
    \ be used as the next hop when forwarding the NLRI\n      listed in the UPDATE\
    \ message.  If the recipient is an external\n      peer, then the recipient and\
    \ the NEXT_HOP address must share a\n      subnet.  It is clear that an outsider\
    \ who modified this field\n      could disrupt the forwarding of traffic between\
    \ the two ASes.\n      If the recipient of the message is an external peer of\
    \ an AS and\n      the route was learned from another peer AS (this is one of\
    \ two\n      forms of \"third party\" NEXT_HOP), then the BGP speaker advertising\n\
    \      the route has the opportunity to direct the recipient to forward\n    \
    \  traffic to a BGP speaker at the NEXT_HOP address.  This affords\n      the\
    \ opportunity to direct traffic at a router that may not be able\n      to continue\
    \ forwarding the traffic.  A malicious BGP speaker can\n      also use this technique\
    \ to force another AS to carry traffic it\n      would otherwise not have to carry.\
    \  In some cases, this could be\n      to the malicious BGP speaker's benefit,\
    \ as it could cause traffic\n      to be carried long-haul by the victim AS to\
    \ some other peering\n      point it shared with the victim.\n   o  MULTI_EXIT_DISC\n\
    \      The MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute is used in UPDATE messages\n      transmitted\
    \ between inter-AS BGP peers.  While the MULTI_EXIT_DISC\n      received from\
    \ an inter-AS peer may be propagated within an AS, it\n      may not be propagated\
    \ to other ASes.  Consequently, this field is\n      only used in making routing\
    \ decisions internal to one AS.\n      Modifying this field, whether by an outsider\
    \ or a BGP peer, could\n      influence routing within an AS to be sub-optimal,\
    \ but the effect\n      should be limited in scope.\n   o  LOCAL_PREF\n      The\
    \ LOCAL_PREF attribute must be included in all messages with\n      internal peers,\
    \ and excluded from messages with external peers.\n      Consequently, modification\
    \ of the LOCAL_PREF could effect the\n      routing process within the AS only.\
    \  Note that there is no\n      requirement in the BGP RFC that the LOCAL_PREF\
    \ be consistent among\n      the internal BGP speakers of an AS.  Because BGP\
    \ peers are free to\n      choose the LOCAL_PREF, modification of this field is\
    \ a\n      vulnerability with respect to outsiders only.\n   o  ATOMIC_AGGREGATE\n\
    \      The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE field indicates that an AS somewhere along\n     \
    \ the way has aggregated several routes and advertised the aggregate\n      NLRI\
    \ without the AS_SET being formed as usual from the ASes in the\n      aggregated\
    \ routes' AS_PATHs.  BGP speakers receiving a route with\n      ATOMIC_AGGREGATE\
    \ are restricted from making the NLRI any more\n      specific.  Removing the\
    \ ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute would remove\n      the restriction, possibly causing\
    \ traffic intended for the more\n      specific NLRI to be routed incorrectly.\
    \  Adding the\n      ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute, when no aggregation was done,\
    \ would\n      have little effect beyond restricting the un-aggregated NLRI from\n\
    \      being made more specific.  This vulnerability exists whether the\n    \
    \  source is a BGP peer or an outsider.\n   o  AGGREGATOR\n      This field may\
    \ be included by a BGP speaker who has computed the\n      routes represented\
    \ in the UPDATE message by aggregating other\n      routes.  The field contains\
    \ the AS number and IP address of the\n      last aggregator of the route.  It\
    \ is not used in making any\n      routing decisions, so it does not represent\
    \ a vulnerability.\n"

  - "4.2.  Operational Protections\n   BGP is primarily used as a means to provide\
    \ reachability information\n   to Autonomous Systems (AS) and to distribute external\
    \ reachability\n   internally within an AS.  BGP is the routing protocol used\
    \ to\n   distribute global routing information in the Internet.  Therefore,\n\
    \   BGP is used by all major Internet Service Providers (ISP), as well as\n  \
    \ many smaller providers and other organizations.\n   BGP's role in the Internet\
    \ puts BGP implementations in unique\n   conditions, and places unique security\
    \ requirements on BGP.  BGP is\n   operated over interprovider interfaces in which\
    \ traffic levels push\n   the state of the art in specialized packet forwarding\
    \ hardware and\n   exceed the performance capabilities of hardware implementation\
    \ of\n   decryption by many orders of magnitude.  The capability of an\n   attacker\
    \ using a single workstation with high speed interface to\n   generate false traffic\
    \ for denial of service (DoS) far exceeds the\n   capability of software-based\
    \ decryption or appropriately-priced\n   cryptographic hardware to detect the\
    \ false traffic.  Under such\n   conditions, one means to protect the network\
    \ elements from DoS\n   attacks is to use packet-based filtering techniques based\
    \ on\n   relatively simple inspections of packets.  As a result, for an ISP\n\
    \   carrying large volumes of traffic, the ability to packet filter on\n   the\
    \ basis of port numbers is an important protection against DoS\n   attacks, and\
    \ a necessary adjunct to cryptographic strength in\n   encapsulation.\n   Current\
    \ practice in ISP operation is to use certain common filtering\n   techniques\
    \ to reduce the exposure to attacks from outside the ISP.\n   To protect Internal\
    \ BGP (IBGP) sessions, filters are applied at all\n   borders to an ISP network.\
    \  This removes all traffic destined for\n   network elements' internal addresses\
    \ (typically contained within a\n   single prefix) and the BGP port number (179).\
    \  If the BGP port number\n   is found, packets from within an ISP are not forwarded\
    \ from an\n   internal interface to the BGP speaker's address (on which External\n\
    \   BGP (EBGP) sessions are supported), or to a peer's EBGP address.\n   Appropriate\
    \ router design can limit the risk of compromise when a BGP\n   peer fails to\
    \ provide adequate filtering.  The risk can be limited to\n   the peering session\
    \ on which filtering is not performed by the peer,\n   or to the interface or\
    \ line card on which the peering is supported.\n   There is substantial motivation,\
    \ and little effort is required, for\n   ISPs to maintain such filters.\n   These\
    \ operational practices can considerably raise the difficulty for\n   an outsider\
    \ to launch a DoS attack against an ISP.  Prevented from\n   injecting sufficient\
    \ traffic from outside a network to effect a DoS\n   attack, the attacker would\
    \ have to undertake more difficult tasks,\n   such as compromising the ISP network\
    \ elements or undetected tapping\n   into physical media.\n"
