    \ and other factors, some of the entries\n   in this catalog may be out of date.\
    \  The reader is urged to consult\n   the on-line service to obtain the most up-to-date\
    \ information.\n   The index provided in this document reflects the current contents\
    \ of\n   the on-line documentation.\n   The NOCtools2 Working Group of the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) has compiled this revised catalog.  Future\
    \ revisions will be\n   incorporated into the on-line NOCtools catalog.  The reader\
    \ is\n   encouraged to submit new or revised entries for (near-immediate)\n  \
    \ electronic publication.\n   The tools described in this catalog are in no way\
    \ endorsed by the\n   IETF.  For the most part, we have neither evaluated the\
    \ tools in this\n   catalog, nor validated their descriptions.  Most of the descriptions\n\
    \   of commercial tools have been provided by vendors.  Caveat Emptor.\n"

- title: Keywords
  contents:
  - "Keywords\n   This catalog uses \"keywords\" for terse characterizations of the\n\
    \   tools.  Keywords are abbreviated attributes of a tool or its use.  To\n  \
    \ allow cross-comparison of tools, uniform keyword definitions have\n   been developed,\
    \ and are given below.  Following the definitions,\n   there is an index of catalog\
    \ entries by keyword.\n"

  - "Tool Descriptions\n   This section is an updated collection of brief descriptions\
    \ of tools\n   for managing TCP/IP internets.  These entries are in alphabetical\n\
    \   order, by tool name.\n   The entries all follow a standard format.  Immediately\
    \ after the NAME\n   of a tool are its associated KEYWORDS.  Keywords are terse\n\
    \   descriptions of the purposes or attributes of a tool.  A more\n   detailed\
    \ description of a tool's purpose and characteristics is given\n   in the ABSTRACT\
    \ section.  The MECHANISM section describes how a tool\n   works.  In CAVEATS,\
    \ warnings about tool use are given.  In BUGS,\n   known bugs or bug-report procedures\
    \ are given.  LIMITATIONS describes\n   the boundaries of a tool's capabilities.\
    \  HARDWARE REQUIRED and\n   SOFTWARE REQUIRED relate the operational environment\
    \ a tool needs.\n   Finally, in AVAILABILITY, pointers to vendors, online repositories,\n\
    \   or other sources for a tool are given.\n   Where tool names conflict, the\
    \ vendor name is used as well.  For\n   example, MITRE, and SNMP Research each\
    \ submitted an updated\n   description of a tool called, \"NETMON\".  These tools\
    \ were\n   independently developed, are functionally different, and run in\n \
    \  different environments.  MITRE's tool is listed as \"NETMON_MITRE,\"\n   and\
    \ the tool from SNMP Research as \"NETMON_WINDOWS_SNMP_RESEARCH\".\n        Internet\

    \        ABSTRACT\n                Tekelec's ChameLAN 100 is a portable diagnostic\
    \ system\n                for monitoring and simulation of FDDI, Ethernet and\n\
    \                Token Ring networks -- simultaneously.  Protocol\n          \
    \      analysis of multiple topologies, as well as mixed\n                topoloies\
    \ simultaneously, is a key feature of\n                the product family.  Tekelec's\
    \ proprietary FDDI\n                hardware guarantees complete real-time analysis\
    \ of\n                networks and network components at the full ring\n     \
    \           bandwidth of 125 Mbps.  It passively connects to the\n           \
    \     network and captures 100 percent of the data, measures\n               \
    \ performance and isolates real-time problems.\n                The simulation\
    \ option offers full bandwidth load\n                generation that allows you\
    \ to create and simulate any\n                network condition.  It gives you\
    \ the ability to inject\n                errors and misformed frames.  A set of\n\
    \                confidence tests allow simple evaluation of new\n           \
    \     equipment.  A ring map feature displays network\n                topology\
    \ and status of all nodes via the SMT\n                process.\n            \
    \    Monitoring of FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring allows the\n                user\
    \ to: view network status in real time; view\n                network, node, or\
    \ node pair statistics; capture\n                frames; control capture using\
    \ trigger and filter\n                capabilities; view real-time statistics;\
    \ view captured\n                frames in decoded format; and view the last frame\n\
    \                transmitted by each station.\n                The following Real-Time\
    \ Network Statistics of FDDI,\n                Ethernet and Token Ring networks\
    \ is displayed: frame\n                rate, runts, byte rate, jabbers, CRC/align\
    \ errors, and\n                collisions.\n                Product developers\
    \ can use the ChameLAN 100 to observe\n                and control various events\
    \ to help debug their FDDI,\n                Ethernet and Token Ring products.\
    \  End users can\n                perform real-time monitoring to test and\n \
    \               diagnose problems that may occur when developing,\n          \
    \      installing or managing FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring\n                networks\
    \ and network products.  End users can use the\n                ChameLAN 100 to\
    \ aid in the installation and\n                maintenance of Ethernet and Token\
    \ Ring networks.  To\n                isolate specific network trouble spots the\
    \ ChameLAN\n                100 uses filtering and triggering techniques for data\n\
    \                capture.  Higher level protocol decode includes\n           \
    \     TCP/IP, OSI and DECnet protocol suites.  Protocol\n                decode\
    \ of IPX, SNMP, XTP, and AppleTalk are also\n                supported.  Development\
    \ of additional protocol decodes\n                is also under development. \
    \ The ChameLAN 100 family\n                also offers a Protocol Management Development\
    \ System\n                (PMDS) that enables users to develop custom protocol\n\
    \                decode suites.\n                The FDDI, Ethernet and Token\
    \ Ring hardware interfaces\n                feature independent processing power.\
    \  Real-time data\n                is monitored unobtrusively at full bandwidth\
    \ without\n                affecting network activity.  Real-time data may also\n\
    \                be saved to a 120MB or optional 200MB hard disk drive\n     \
    \           for later analysis.  FDDI data is captured at 125 megabits\n     \
    \           per second (Mbps), Ethernet at 10 Mbps and Token Ring\n          \
    \      at 4 or 16 Mbps.\n        MECHANISM\n                This portable, standalone\
    \ unit incorporates the power\n                of UNIX, X-Windows and Motif. \
    \ Its UNIX-based\n                programming interface facilitates development\
    \ of\n                customized monitoring and simulation applications.  The\n\
    \                ChameLAN 100 may connect to the network at any\n            \
    \    location using standard equipment.  Standard graphical\n                Motif/X-Windows\
    \ and TCP/IP allow remote control\n                through Ethernet and 10Base\
    \ T interfaces.  Tekelec\n                also offers a rackmounted model -- ChameLAN\
    \ 100-X.\n                Both models can be controlled via a Sun Workstation\n\

    \ ques-\n               tions divided up in thirteen sections.  The program\n\
    \               presents the questions to the user and records their\n       \
    \        responses.  After answering the questions in one of the\n           \
    \    thirteen sections, the user can generate a report from\n               the\
    \ questions and the user's answers.  The thirteen\n               sections are:\
    \ telecommunications security, physical\n               access security, personnel\
    \ security, systems develop-\n               ment security, security awareness\

    \          The EMANATE system provides a run-time extensible SNMP\n          \
    \      agent that dynamically reconfigures an agent's MIB\n                without\
    \ having to recompile, relink, or restart the\n                agent.  An EMANATE\
    \ capable SNMP agent can support zero,\n                one, or many subagents\
    \ and dynamically reconfigure to\n                connect or disconnect those\
    \ subagents' MIBs.\n                The EMANATE system consists of several logically\n\
    \                independent components and subsystems:\n                o Master\
    \ SNMP agent which contains an API to communicate\n                  with subagents.\n\
    \                o Subagents which implement various MIBS.\n                o\
    \ Subagent Developer's Kit which contains tools to assist\n                  in\
    \ the implementation of subagents.\n                o EMANATE libraries which\
    \ provide the API for the\n                  subagent.\n        MECHANISM\n  \
    \              A concise API allows a standard means of communication\n      \
    \          between the master and subagents.  System dependent\n             \
    \   mechanisms are employed for transfer of information\n                between\
    \ the master and subagents.\n        CAVEATS\n                None.\n        BUGS\n\

    \ NFS; eavesdrop; UNIX.\n          ABSTRACT\n               Etherfind examines\
    \ the packets that traverse a network\n               interface, and outputs a\
    \ text file describing the\n               traffic.  In the file, a single line\
    \ of text describes\n               a single packet: it contains values such as\
    \ protocol\n               type, length, source, and destination.  Etherfind can\n\
    \               print out all packet traffic on the ethernet, or\n           \
    \    traffic for the local host.  Further packet filtering\n               can\
    \ be done on the basis of protocol: IP, ARP, RARP,\n               ICMP, UDP,\
    \ ND, TCP, and filtering can also be done\n               based on the source,\
    \ destination addresses as well as\n               TCP and UDP port numbers.\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               In usual operations, and by default, etherfind\
    \ puts the\n               interface in promiscuous mode.  In 4.3BSD UNIX and\n\
    \               related OSs, it uses a Network Interface Tap (NIT) to\n      \
    \         obtain a copy of traffic on an ethernet interface.\n          CAVEATS\n\

    \       The Generic Managed System (GMS) implements the\n                functions\
    \ that would be common to any OSI managed\n                system. These include\
    \ the parseing of CMIS requests,\n                selection of managed objects\
    \ according to the scoping\n                and filtering rules, handling of notifications\
    \ and\n                event forwarding discriminators etc. The intention is\n\
    \                that the implementors should use the GMS as a basis\n       \
    \         for their own managed object implementations. A\n                support\
    \ environment is provided to assist with this.\n        MECHANISM\n          \
    \      The GMS uses the UCL CMIP library plus a library of\n                C++\
    \ objects representing common managed objects and\n                attribute types.\n\

    \           Getethers runs through all addresses on an ethernet\n            \
    \    segment (a.b.c.1 to a.b.c.254) and pings each address,\n                and\
    \ then determines the ethernet address for that\n                host.  It produces\
    \ a list, in either plain ASCII, the\n                file format for the Excelan\
    \ Lanalyzer, or the file\n                format for the Network General Sniffer,\
    \ of\n                hostname/ethernet address pairs for all hosts on the\n \
    \               local nework.  The plain ASCII list optionally\n             \
    \   includes the vendor name of the ethernet card in\n                each system,\
    \ to aid in the determination of the\n                identity of unknown systems.\n\
    \        MECHANISM\n                Getethers uses a raw IP socket to generate\
    \ ICMP echo\n                requests and receive ICMP echo replies, and then\n\
    \                examines the kernel ARP table to determine the\n            \
    \    ethernet address of each responding system.\n        CAVEATS\n          \
    \      Assumes that the ethernet it is looking at is either\n                a\

    \ values\n               of one or several MIB variables (RFC1066) using the\n\
    \               SNMP (RFC1098).  Getone and getmany retrieve arbitrary\n     \
    \          MIB variables; getroute, getarp, getaddr, and getif\n             \
    \  retrieve and display tabular information (routing\n               tables, ARP\
    \ table, interface configuration, etc.), and\n               getid retrieves and\
    \ displays system name, identifica-\n               tion and boot time.\n    \
    \           Getone <target> <mibvariable> retrieves and displays\n           \
    \    the value of the designated MIB variable from the\n               specified\
    \ target system.  The SNMP community name to be\n               used for the retrieval\
    \ can also be specified.  Getmany\n               works similarly for groups of\
    \ MIB variables rather than\n               individual values.  The name of each\
    \ variable, its\n               value and its data type is displayed.  Getroute\
    \ returns\n               information from the ipRoutingTable MIB structure,\n\
    \               displaying the retrieved information in an accessible\n      \
    \         format.  Getarp behaves similarly for the address\n               translation\
    \ table; getaddr for the ipAddressTable; and\n               getif displays information\
    \ from the interfaces table,\n               supplemented with information from\
    \ the ipAddressTable.\n               Getid displays the system name, identification,\
    \ ipFor-\n               warding state, and the boot time and date.  All take\
    \ a\n               system name or IP address as an argument and can\n       \
    \        specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One SNMP\n            \

    \          ABSTRACT\n               Hammer and Anvil are the benchmarking programs\
    \ for IP\n               routers.  Using these tools, gateways have been tested\n\
    \               for per-packet delay, router-generated traffic over-\n       \
    \        head, maximum sustained throughput, etc.\n          MECHANISM\n     \
    \          Tests are performed on a gateway in an isolated\n               testbed.\
    \  Hammer generates packets at controlled rates.\n               It can set the\
    \ length and interpacket interval of a\n               packet stream.  Anvil counts\
    \ packet arrivals.\n          CAVEATS\n               Hammer should not be run\
    \ on a live network.\n          BUGS\n               None reported.\n        \
    \  LIMITATIONS\n               Early versions of hammer could not produce inter-packet\n\
    \               intervals shorter than 55 usec.\n          HARDWARE REQUIRED\n\
    \               Hammer runs on a PC/AT or compatible, and anvil\n            \
    \   requires a PC or clone.  Both use a Micom Interlan\n               NI5210\

    \ traceroute\n               but is for use on IBM PC compatibles that have ethernet\n\
    \               connections.  Hopcheck is part of a larger TCP/IP pack-\n    \
    \           age that is known as ka9q that is for use with packet\n          \
    \     radio.  Ka9q can coexist on a PC with other TCP/IP\n               packages\
    \ such as FTP Inc's PC/TCP, but must be used\n               independently of\
    \ other packages.  Ka9q was written by\n               Phil Karn.  Hopcheck was\
    \ added by Katie Stevens,\n               dkstevens@ucdavis.edu.  Unlike traceroute,\
    \ which\n               requires a UNIX kernel mod, hopcheck will run on the\n\

    \ Rover is a prototype network monitor that uses\n               multiple protocol\
    \ \"modules\" to test network functional-\n               ity.  This package consists\
    \ of two primary pieces of\n               code: the data collector and the problem\
    \ display.\n               There is one data collector that performs a series\
    \ of\n               network tests, and maintains a list of problems with\n  \
    \             the network.  There can be many display processes all\n        \
    \       displaying the current list of problems which is useful\n            \
    \   in a multi-operator NOC.\n               The display task uses curses, allowing\
    \ many terminal\n               types to display the problem file either locally\
    \ or\n               from a remote site.  Full source is provided.  The data\n\
    \               collector is easily configured and extensible.  Contri-\n    \
    \           butions such as additional protocol modules, and shell\n         \
    \      script extensions are welcome.\n          MECHANISM\n               A configuration\
    \ file contains a list of nodes,\n               addresses, NodeUp? protocol test\
    \ (ping in most cases),\n               and a list of further tests to be performed\
    \ if the node\n               is in fact up.  Modules are included to test TELNET,\n\
    \               FTP, and SMTP.  If the configuration contains a test\n       \
    \        that isn't recognized, a generic test is assumed, and a\n           \
    \    filename is checked for existence.  This way users can\n               create\
    \ scripts that create a file if there is a prob-\n               lem, and the\
    \ data collector simply checks the existence\n               of that file to determine\
    \ if there is problem.\n          CAVEATS\n               None.\n          BUGS\n\
    \               None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n               This tool does\
    \ not yet have the capability to  perform\n               actions based on the\
    \ result of the test.  Rather, it is\n               intended for a multi-operator\
    \ environment,  and  simply\n               displays a list of what is wrong with\

    \      Software to assess the sequential file I/O capability\n               \
    \ of a system.  May be useful as reference to compare\n                against\
    \ results obtained when files are accessed via\n                NFS, Andrew, etc.\n\
    \        MECHANISM\n                This test writes a X MEGABYTE sequential file\
    \ in Y\n                byte chunks, then rewinds it and reads it back.\n    \
    \            [The size of the file should be big enough to factor\n          \
    \      out the effect of any disk cache.].  Finally,\n                IOZONE deletes\
    \ the temporary file.  Options allow one to\n                vary X and Y.  In\
    \ addition, 'auto test' runs IOZONE\n                repeatedly using record sizes\
    \ from 512 to 8192 bytes\n                (adjustable), and file sizes from 1\
    \ to 16 megabytes\n                (adjustable).  It creates a table of results.\n\
    \        CAVEATS\n                The file is written (filling any cache buffers),\
    \ and\n                then read.  If the cache is >= X MB, then most if not\n\
    \                all the reads will be satisfied from the cache.\n           \
    \     However, if it is less than or equal to\n                .5X MB, then NONE\
    \ of the reads will be satisfied from\n                the cache.  This is becase\
    \ after the file is written,\n                a .5X MB cache will contain the\
    \ upper .5 MB of the\n                test file, but we will start reading\n \
    \               from the beginning of the file (data which is no\n           \
    \     longer in the cache).\n                In order for this to be a fair test,\
    \ the length of the\n                test file must be AT LEAST 2X the amount\
    \ of disk cache\n                memory for your system.  If not, you are really\n\
    \                testing the speed at which your CPU\n                can read\
    \ blocks out of the cache (not a fair test).\n        BUGS\n                none\
    \ known at this time.\n        LIMITATIONS\n                IOZONE does not normally\
    \ test the raw I/O speed of\n                your disk or system-em.  It tests\
    \ the speed of\n                sequential I/O to actual files.\n            \
    \    Therefore, this measurement factors in the efficiency\n                of\
    \ you  machines file system, operating system, C\n                compiler, and\
    \ C runtime library.  It produces a\n                measurement which is the\
    \ number of bytes\n                per second that your system can read or write\
    \ to a file.\n        HARDWARE REQUIRED\n                This program has been\
    \ ported and tested on the\n                following computer operating systems:\n"

    \  LAN Patrol is a full-featured network analyzer that\n               provides\
    \ essential information for effective fault and\n               performance management.\
    \  It allows network managers to\n               easily monitor user activity,\
    \ find traffic overloads,\n               plan for growth, test cable, uncover\
    \ intruders, balance\n               network services, and so on.  LAN Patrol\
    \ uses state of\n               the art data collection techniques to monitor\
    \ all\n               activity on a network, giving an accurate picture of\n \
    \              how it is performing.\n               LAN Patrol's reports can\
    \ be saved as ASCII files to\n               disk, and imported into spreadsheet\

    \               The LAN Patrol interface driver programs a standard\n        \
    \       interface card to capture all traffic on a network seg-\n            \
    \   ment.  The driver operates from the background of a\n               standard\
    \ PC, maintaining statistics for each station on\n               the network.\
    \  The information can be viewed on the PC's\n               screen, or as a user-defined\

    \    None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n               LAN Patrol can monitor\
    \ up to 10,000 packets/sec on an\n               AT class PC, and is limited to\
    \ monitoring a maximum of\n               1024 stations for intervals of up to\
    \ 30 days.\n               Because LAN Patrol operates at the physical level,\

    \ family of protocol and statistical\n            analyzers provide the tools\
    \ to troubleshoot an Ethernet and\n            Token Ring 4/16Mbps network.  LANVista\
    \ lets you capture\n            frames to RAM and or disk, generate traffic for\
    \ stress\n            testing, test your network cable for fault isolation, and\n\
    \            decode all 7 layers of many popular protocol stacks.\n          \
    \  LANVista's 100 family offers exceptional price/performance\n            and\
    \ a wide range of options. Combined with an\n            integrated upgrade path\
    \ to the fully distributed LANVista\n            200 system, the 100 line provides\
    \ a  reasonably priced\n            entry into LAN management and protocol analysis.\n\
    \            All LANVista models are fully operable under Microsoft\n        \
    \    Windows. Under Windows, LANVista can be operated in\n            the background,\
    \ gathering data and alarms as other\n            tasks are completed. Displayed\
    \ data may easily be\n            cut from LANVista and pasted into other Windows\n\
    \            applications such as Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Harvard\n            Graphics,\
    \ etc.\n            The versatile LANVista family can also be remotely\n     \
    \       controlled through the use of PC Anywhere, Commute,\n            Carbon\
    \ Copy, or other PC remote control packages.\n            This feature allows\
    \ the use of \"co-pilot\" mode which\n            enables an operator at the central\
    \ site to guide and\n            train a remote operator through network management\
    \ or\n            analysis tasks.\n            All LANVista models provide features\
    \ vital to effective\n            network management and troubleshooting.  Basic\n\
    \            capabilities include: Network database, statistics\n            based\

    \          ABSTRACT\n               The LanProbe distributed monitoring system\
    \ performs\n               remote and local monitoring of ethernet LANs in a pro-\n\
    \               tocol and vendor independent manner.\n               LanProbe\
    \ discovers each active node on a segment and\n               displays it on a\
    \ map with its adapter card vendor name,\n               ethernet address, and\
    \ IP address.  Additional informa-\n               tion about the nodes, such\
    \ as equipment type and physi-\n               cal location can be entered in\
    \ to the data base by the\n               user.\n               When the NodeLocator\
    \ option is used, data on the actual\n               location of nodes is automatically\
    \ entered and the map\n               becomes an accurate representation of the\
    \ physical lay-\n               out of the segment.  Thereafter when a new node\
    \ is\n               installed and becomes active, or when a node is moved\n \
    \              or becomes inactive, the change is detected and shown\n       \
    \        on the map in real time.  The system also provides the\n            \
    \   network manager with precise cable fault information\n               displayed\
    \ on the map.\n               Traffic statistics are gathered and displayed and\
    \ can\n               be exported in (comma delimited) CSV format for further\n\
    \               analysis.  Alerts can be set on user defined thres-\n        \
    \       holds.\n               Trace provides a remote protocol analyzer capability\n\
    \               with decodes for common protocols.\n               Significant\
    \ events (like power failure, cable breaks,\n               new node on network,\
    \ broadcast IP source address seen,\n               etc.) are tracked in a log\
    \ that is uploaded to Pro-\n               beView periodically.\n            \
    \   ProbeView generates reports that can be manipulated by\n               MSDOS\

    \  The LanProbe segment monitor attaches to the\n               end of an ethernet\
    \ segment and monitors all traffic.\n               Attachment can be direct to\
    \ a thin or thick coax cable,\n               or via an external transceiver to\
    \ fiber optic or twist-\n               ed pair cabling.  Network data relating\
    \ to the segment\n               is transferred to a workstation running ProbeView\
    \ via\n               RS-232, ethernet, or a modem connection.\n             \

    \ sourcelib.\n          ABSTRACT\n               LANWatch 2.0 is an inexpensive,\
    \ powerful and flexible\n               network analyzer that runs under DOS on\
    \ personal com-\n               puters and requires no hardware modifications\
    \ to either\n               the host or the network.  LANWatch is an invaluable\n\
    \               tool for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring\n       \
    \        local area networks, and for developing and debugging\n             \
    \  new protocols.  Network managers using LANWatch can\n               inspect\
    \ network traffic patterns and packet errors to\n               isolate performance\
    \ problems and bottlenecks.  Protocol\n               developers can use LANWatch\
    \ to inspect and verify\n               proper protocol handling.  Since LANWatch\
    \ is a\n               software-only package which installs easily in existing\n\
    \               PCs, network technicians and field service engineers\n       \
    \        can carry LANWatch in their briefcase for convenient\n              \
    \ network analysis at remote sites.\n               LANWatch has two operating\
    \ modes: Display and Examine.\n               In Display Mode, LANWatch traces\
    \ network traffic by\n               displaying captured packets in real time.\
    \  Examine Mode\n               allows you to scroll back through stored packets\
    \ to\n               inspect them in detail.  To select a subset of packets\n\
    \               for display, storage or retrieval, there is an exten-\n      \
    \         sive set of built-in filters.  Using filters, LANWatch\n           \
    \    collects only packets of interest, saving the user from\n               having\
    \ to sort through all network traffic to isolate\n               specific packets.\
    \  The built-in filters include alarm,\n               trigger, capture, load,\
    \ save and search.  They can be\n               controlled separately to match\
    \ on source or destination\n               address, protocol, or packet contents\
    \ at the hardware\n               and transport layers.  LANWatch also includes\
    \ suffi-\n               cient source code so users can modify the existing\n\
    \               filters and parsers or add new ones.\n               The LANWatch\
    \ distribution includes executables and\n               source for several post-processors:\
    \ a TCP protocol\n               analyzer, a node-by-node traffic analyzer and\
    \ a dump\n               file listing tool.\n          MECHANISM\n           \
    \    Uses many common PC network interfaces by placing them\n               in\
    \ promiscuous mode and capturing traffic.\n          CAVEATS\n               Most\
    \ PC network interfaces will not capture 100% of the\n               traffic on\
    \ a fully-loaded network (primarily missing\n               back-to-back packets).\n\

    \  traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop; VMS; free.\n          ABSTRACT\n        \
    \       ENTM is a screen-oriented utility that runs under\n               VAX/VMS.\
    \  It monitors local ethernet traffic and\n               displays either a real\
    \ time or cumulative, histogram\n               showing a percent breakdown of\
    \ traffic by ethernet pro-\n               tocol type.  The information in the\
    \ display can be\n               reported based on packet count or byte count.\
    \  The per-\n               cent of broadcast, multicast and approximate lost\
    \ pack-\n               ets is reported as well.  The screen display is updated\n\
    \               every three seconds.  Additionally, a real time, slid-\n     \
    \          ing history window may be displayed showing ethernet\n            \
    \   traffic patterns for the last five minutes.\n               ENTM can also\
    \ report IP traffic statistics by packet\n               count or byte count.\
    \  The IP histograms reflect infor-\n               mation collected at the TCP\
    \ and UDP port level, includ-\n               ing ICMP type/code combinations.\
    \  Both the ethernet and\n               IP histograms may be sorted by ASCII\
    \ protocol/port name\n               or by percent-value.  All screen displays\
    \ can be saved\n               in a file for printing later.\n          MECHANISM\n\
    \               This utility simply places the ethernet controller in\n      \
    \         promiscuous mode and monitors the local area network\n             \
    \  traffic.  It preallocates 10 receive buffers and\n               attempts to\
    \ keep 22 reads pending on the ethernet dev-\n               ice.\n          CAVEATS\n\
    \               Placing the ethernet controller in promiscuous mode may\n    \
    \           severly slow down a VAX system.  Depending on the speed\n        \
    \       of the VAX system and the amount of traffic on the  lo-\n            \
    \   cal  ethernet,  a large amount of CPU time may be spent\n               on\
    \ the Interrupt Stack.  Running this code on any  pro-\n               duction\
    \ system during operational hours is discouraged.\n          BUGS\n          \
    \     Due to a bug in the VAX/VMS ethernet/802 device driver,\n              \
    \ IEEE  802 format packets may not always be detected.  A\n               simple\
    \ test is performed to \"guess\" which  packets  are\n               in  IEEE\
    \  802  format (DSAP equal to SSAP).  Thus, some\n               DSAP/SSAP pairs\
    \ may be reported as  an  ethernet  type,\n               while  valid ethernet\
    \ types may be reported as IEEE 802\n               packets.\n               In\
    \ some hardware configurations, placing an ethernet\n               controller\
    \ in promiscuous mode with automatic-restart\n               enabled will hang\
    \ the controller.  Our VAX 8650 hangs\n               running this code, while\

    \ to manage and control\n               SNMP-based networking products from any\
    \ vendor including\n               those from Hughes LAN Systems.\n          \
    \     A comprehensive relational database manages the data and\n             \
    \  ensures easy access and control of resources throughout\n               the\
    \ network.\n               Monet provides multivendor management through its\n\
    \               advanced Mib master MIB parser that allows the parsing\n     \
    \          of enterprise MIBs (ASN.1 format per RFC1212) directly\n          \
    \     into the RDBMS for use by Monet's applications.\n               Major features\
    \ include:\n               Remote access with X:\n                    Use of the\
    \ X/Motif user-interface, enabling remote\n                    access to the all\
    \ applications.\n               Database Management\n                    Stores\
    \ and retrieves the information required to\n                    administer and\
    \ configure the network.  It can be\n                    used to:\n          \
    \               - Store and recall configuration data for all\n              \
    \             devices.\n                         - Provide availability history\
    \ for devices.\n                         - Assign new internet addresses.\n  \

    \ as \"dynamic\" icons in\n                     heirarchical maps.  The network\
    \ is represented by\n                     these heirarchical maps.  Though there\
    \ is a\n                     library of device icons, cities and geographical\n\
    \                     maps included, the user has access to a\n              \
    \       graphics editor that allows customizing and the\n                    \
    \ creation of new icons and maps.\n                    A Device's icon may be\

    \   KEYWORDS\n               routing, status; DECnet, IP; curses, ping; UNIX,\
    \ VMS;\n               free, sourcelib.\n          ABSTRACT\n               Net_monitor\
    \ uses ICMP echo (and DECnet reachability\n               information on VAX/VMS)\
    \ to monitor a network.  The mon-\n               itoring is very simplistic,\
    \ but has proved useful.  It\n               periodically tests whether hosts\
    \ are reachable and\n               reports the results in a full-screen display.\
    \  It\n               groups hosts together in common sets.  If all hosts in\n\
    \               a set become unreachable, it makes a lot of racket with\n    \
    \           bells, since it assumes that this means that some com-\n         \
    \      mon piece of hardware that supports that set has\n               failed.\
    \  The periodicity of the tests, hosts to test,\n               and groupings\
    \ of hosts are controlled with a single\n               configuration file.\n\
    \               The idea for this program came from the PC/IP monitor\n      \
    \         facility, but is an entirely different program with\n              \
    \ different functionality.\n          MECHANISM\n               Reachability is\
    \ tested using ICMP echo facilities for\n               TCP/IP hosts (and DECnet\
    \ reachability information on\n               VAX/VMS).  A DECnet node is considered\
    \ reachable if it\n               appears in the list of hosts in a \"show network\"\
    \ com-\n               mand issued on a routing node.\n          CAVEATS\n   \
    \            This facility has been found to be most useful when run\n       \
    \        in a window on a workstation rather than on a terminal\n            \
    \   connected to a host.  It could be useful if ported to a\n               PC\
    \ (looks easy using FTP Software's programming\n               libraries), but\
    \ this has not been done.  Curses is very\n               slow and cpu intensive\
    \ on VMS, but the tool has been\n               run in a window on a VAXstation\
    \ 2000.  Just don't try\n               to run it on a terminal connected to a\
    \ 11/750.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n\

    \ Manager provides management of TCP/IP\n               networks using both SNMP\
    \ and CMOT protoocls.  Such\n               management can be initiated either\

    \ or\n               through OSI Network Management (CMIP) commands.  The\n  \
    \             Dual Manager provides for configuration, fault, secu-\n        \
    \       rity and performance management.  It provides extensive\n            \
    \   map management features, including scanned maps in the\n               background.\
    \  It provides simple mechanisms to extend\n               the MIB and assign\
    \ specific lists of objects to\n               specific network elements, thereby\
    \ providing for the\n               management of all vendors' specific MIB extensions.\

    \          ABSTRACT\n               Netlabs' SNMP code debuted in Interop 89,\
    \ where it\n               showed interoperation of the code with several imple-\n\
    \               mentations on the show floor.  The SNMP code comes with\n    \
    \           an Extensible MIB, which allows users to add new MIB\n           \
    \    variables.  The code currently supports all the MIB\n               variables\
    \ in RFC 1066 via the data types in RFC 1065,\n               as well as the emerging\
    \ MIB-II, which is currently in\n               experimental stage.  The SNMP\
    \ has been benchmarked at\n               200 Management Operations per Second\
    \ (MOPS) for a 1-\n               MIPS machine.\n          MECHANISM\n       \

    \            You can answer questions such as: Which sources are\n           \
    \     generating most of the load on the network when it is\n                most\

    \ bridges and\n                routers be located to optimally partition the network?\n\
    \                How much load do applications, like the X Windows\n         \

    \ a\n               user-level network monitoring or management program.\n   \
    \            Iptrace is a program interfacing to NETMON which logs\n         \
    \      TCP-IP traffic for performance measurement and gateway\n              \
    \ monitoring. It is easy to build other NETMON-based\n               tools using\
    \ iptrace as a model.\n               NETMON resides in the 4.3BSD UNIX kernel.\
    \  It is\n               independent of hardware-specific code in UNIX.  It is\n\
    \               transparent to protocol and network type, having no\n        \
    \       internal assumptions about the network protocols being\n             \
    \  recorded.  It is installed in BSD-like kernels by\n               adding a\
    \ standard function call (probe) to a few points\n               in the input\
    \ and output routines of the protocols to be\n               logged.\n       \
    \        NETMON is analogous to Sun Microsystems' NIT, but the\n             \
    \  interface tap function is extended by recording more\n               context\
    \ information.  Aside from the timestamp, the\n               choice of information\
    \ recorded is up to the installer\n               of the probes.  The NETMON probes\
    \ added to the BSD IP\n               code supplied with the distribution include\
    \ as context:\n               input and output queue lengths, identification of\
    \ the\n               network interface, and event codes labeling packet dis-\n\
    \               cards.  (The NETMON distribution is geared towards\n         \
    \      measuring the performance of BSD networking protocols\n               in\
    \ an IP gateway).\n               NETMON is designed so that it can reside within\
    \ the\n               monitored system with minimal interference to the net-\n\
    \               work processing.  The estimated and measured overhead\n      \
    \         is around five percent of packet processing.\n               The user-level\
    \ tool \"iptrace\" is provided with NETMON.\n               This program logs\
    \ IP traffic, either at IP-level only,\n               or as it passes through\
    \ the network interface drivers\n               as well.  As a separate function,\
    \ iptrace produces a\n               host traffic matrix output.  Its third type\
    \ of output\n               is abbreviated sampling, in which only a pre-set number\n\
    \               of packets from each new host pair is logged.  The\n         \
    \      three output types are configured dynamically, in any\n               combination.\n\
    \               OSITRACE, another logging tool with a NETMON interface,\n    \
    \           is available separately (and documented in a separate\n          \
    \     entry in this catalog).\n          MECHANISM\n               Access to the\
    \ information logged by NETMON is through a\n               UNIX special file,\
    \ /dev/netmon.  User reads are blocked\n               until the buffer reaches\
    \ a configurable level of full-\n               ness.\n               Several\
    \ other parameters of NETMON can be tuned at com-\n               pile time. \

    \     The NETscout family of distributed LAN Analyzer\n                devices\
    \ are intended to provide network users with a\n                comprehensive\
    \ capability to identify and isolate fault\n                conditions in data\
    \ communications networks.\n                NETscout has the capability to collect\
    \ wide ranging\n                statistical data, to display selectively captured\
    \ and\n                fully decoded network traffic, to set user-defined\n  \
    \              alarm conditions, and to obtain real-time updates\n           \
    \     from all segments of a widely dispersed internetwork\n                from\
    \ a centralized SNMP-compatible network management\n                console.\n\
    \                The NETscout family is based on standards so that\n         \
    \       operation may be realized in heterogeneous networks\n                which\
    \ constitute a multi-protocol, multi-topology,\n                multi-vendor environment.\
    \  The fundamental standards\n                upon which NETscout is based are\
    \ the Simple Network\n                Management Protocol (SNMP), which defines\
    \ the protocol\n                for all inter-communications between NETscout\
    \ devices,\n                and the Remote Monitoring Management Information Base\n\
    \                (RMON-MIB), which defines the type of information\n         \
    \       which is to be gathered and made available to the\n                user\
    \ for each network segment.\n                NETscout clients provide a full array\
    \ of monitoring\n                and analysis features including intelligent seven\n\
    \                level decoding of all majorprotocol stacks:\n               \
    \ DOD including TCP/IP    XNS       Novell\n                DECNET including LAT\
    \    ISO       APPLETALK\n                IBM Token Ring          Vines     NETBIOS/SMB\n\
    \                SNMP including RMON-MIB SUN-NFS   SMT\n                NETscout\
    \ agents support all nine groups of the\n                RMON-MIB standard.  NETscout\
    \ agents can work with any\n                SNMP-based network management system\
    \ and currently\n                support Ethernet and Token Ring.\n        MECHANISM\n\
    \                The operation of the NETscout family is divided into\n      \
    \          two distinct subcategories.  The first is the \"Client\"\n        \
    \        which is the user console from which operational\n                commands\
    \ are issued and where all results and\n                diagnostic information\
    \ are displayed. In a NETscout\n                topology it is feasible to have\
    \ multiple clients\n                active simultaneously within a single network.\
    \  The\n                second category is the \"Agent\", a hardware/software\n\
    \                device which is attached to a specific network\n            \
    \    segment and which gathers statistical information for\n                that\
    \ segment as well as providing a window into that\n                segment where\
    \ network traffic may be observed and\n                gathered for more detailed\
    \ user analysis.  A\n                typical network will have multiple segments\
    \ and\n                multiple agents up to the point of having one agent\n \
    \               for each logical network segment.\n                NETscout Model\
    \ 9210 is a software package which, when\n                combined in a Sun SPARCstation\
    \ in conjunction with\n                SunNet Manager running under Open Windows,\
    \ implements\n                the NETscout client function.  SunNet Manager provides\n\
    \                the background operational tools for client operation\n     \
    \           while the NETscout software provides\n                application-specific\
    \ functions related to RMON-MIB\n                support as well as all software\
    \ necessary to\n                perform the protocol decode function.\n      \
    \          SunNet Manager also implements a network map file\n               \
    \ which includes a topographical display of the entire\n                network\
    \ and is the mechanism for selecting\n                network elements to perform\
    \ operations.\n                NETscout Model 9215 is a software package that\n\
    \                operates in conjunction with SunNet Manager and\n           \
    \     implements the statistics monitoring function only.\n                That\
    \ is, it does not include the protocol\n                decode function or the\
    \ mechanism to retrieve actual\n                data from a remote agent.  It\
    \ does, however, include\n                complete statistics gathering and event\
    \ and alarm\n                generation.\n                Frontier NETscout Models\
    \ 9510 and 9515, and Model 9610\n                and 9615 are agent software packages\
    \ that implement\n                selected network diagnostic functions when loaded\
    \ into\n                a Sun SPARCstation (9510, 9515) or a SynOptics\n     \
    \           LattisNet Hub (9610, 9615) respectively which is\n               \
    \ connected to an Ethernet network segment\n                using conventional\
    \ network interface hardware.  Models\n                9510 and 9610 support all\
    \ nine RMON-MIB groups\n                including \"filters\" and \"packet capture\"\
    \ and thus\n                provide for complete protocol monitoring and decode\n\
    \                when used with a client\n                equipped with protocol\
    \ decode software.  Models 9515\n                an 9615 include support for seven\
    \ RMON-MIB groups\n                which excludes \"filters\" and \"data capture\"\
    \ and\n                therefore perform network monitoring only through\n   \
    \             collection and presentation of network statistics,\n           \
    \     events, and alarms.  All models also support the MIB2\n                system\
    \ and interface groups.\n                Frontier NETscout Models 9520 and 9525,\

    \               This tool monitors traffic on network segments.  All\n       \
    \        information is dumped to either a log file or, for\n               real-time\
    \ viewing, to a command tool window.  Data is\n               time-stamped according\
    \ to date and time.  Logging can\n               continue for up to 24 hours.\n\
    \               The tool is flexible in data collection and presenta-\n      \
    \         tion.  Traffic filters can be specified according to\n             \
    \  header values of numerous protocols, including those\n               used by\
    \ Apple, DEC, Sun, HP, and Apollo.  Bandwidth\n               utilization can\
    \ be monitored, as well as actual load\n               and peak throughput.  Additionally,\
    \ the Network\n               Integrator can analyze a network's topology, and\
    \ record\n               the location of all operational nodes on a network.\n\
    \               Data can be displayed in six separate formats of bar\n       \
    \        graphs.  In addition, there are several routines for\n              \
    \ producing statistical summaries of the data collected.\n          MECHANISM\n\
    \               The tools work through RPC and XDR calls.\n          CAVEATS\n\
    \               Although the tool adds only little traffic to a net-\n       \
    \        work, generation of statistics from captured files\n               requires\

    \ ethernet traffic to an\n                NFS file server and divides it into\
    \ several\n                categories.  The number and percentage of packets\n\
    \                received in each category is displayed on\n                the\
    \ screen in a continuously updated display.\n                By default, nfswatch\
    \ monitors all packets destined for\n                the local host over a single\
    \ network interface.\n                Options are provided to specify the specific\
    \ interface\n                to be monitored, or all interfaces at once.  NFS\n\
    \                traffic to the local host, to a remote host, from a\n       \
    \         specific host, between two hosts, or all NFS traffic\n             \
    \   on the network may be monitored.\n                Categories of packets monitored\
    \ and counted include:\n                ND Read, ND Write, NFS Read, NFS Write,\
    \ NFS Mount,\n                Yellow Pages (NIS), RPC Authorization, Other RPC,\

    \               Other.\n                Packets are also tallied either by file\
    \ system or file\n                (specific files may be watched as an option),\
    \ NFS\n                procedure name (RPC call), or NFS client hostname.\n  \
    \              Facilities for taking \"snapshots\" of the screen, as\n       \
    \         well as saving data to a log file for later analysis\n             \
    \   (the analysis tool is included) are also available.\n        MECHANISM\n \
    \               Nfswatch uses the Network Interface Tap, nit(4) under\n      \
    \          SunOS 4.x, and the Packet Filter, packetfilter(4),\n              \
    \  under Ultrix 4.x, to place the ethernet interface into\n                promiscuous\
    \ mode.  It filters out NFS packets, and\n                decodes the file handles\
    \ in order to determine how to\n                count the packet.\n        CAVEATS\n\
    \                Because the NFS file handle is a non-standard (server\n     \
    \           private) piece of data, nfswatch must be modified to\n           \
    \     understand file handles used by various\n                implementations.\
    \  It currently knows\n                about the SunOS 4.x and Ultrix file handle\

    \ is a collection of programs that provides an\n               internet statistic\
    \ collecting capability.  The NNStat\n               strategy for statistic collection\
    \ is to collect traffic\n               statistics via a promiscuous ethernet\
    \ tap on the local\n               networks, versus instrumenting the gateways.\
    \  If all\n               traffic entering or leaving a network or set of net-\n\
    \               works traverses a local ethernet, then by stationing a\n     \
    \          statistic gathering agent on each local network a pro-\n          \
    \     file of network traffic can be gathered.  Statistical\n               data\
    \ is retrieved from the local agents by a global\n               manager.\n  \
    \             A program called \"statspy\" performs the data gathering\n     \
    \          function.  Essentially, statspy reads all packets on an\n         \
    \      ethernet interface and records all information of\n               interest.\
    \  Information of interest is gathered by exa-\n               mining each packet\
    \ and determining if the source or\n               destination IP address is one\
    \ that is being monitored,\n               typically a gateway address.  If so\
    \ then the contents\n               of the packet are examined to see if they\
    \ match further\n               criteria.\n               A program called \"\
    collect\" performs global data collec-\n               tion.  It periodically\
    \ polls various statspy processes\n               in the domain of interest to\
    \ retrieve locally logged\n               statistical data.\n               The\
    \ NNSTAT distribution comes with several sample awk\n               programs which\
    \ process the logged output of the collect\n               program.\n        \
    \  MECHANISM\n               Local agents (statspy processes) collect raw traffic\n\
    \               data via a promiscuous ethernet tap.  Statistical, fil-\n    \

    \ - network monitoring tools for an IP network\n          SYNOPSIS\n         \
    \      This is an overview of the NOCOL software.\n          DESCRIPTION\n   \
    \            NOCOL (Network Operations Center On-Line) is a\n               collection\
    \ of network monitoring programs that run on\n               Unix systems.  The\
    \ software consists of a number of\n               monitoring agents that poll\
    \ various parameters from any\n               system and put it in a format suitable\
    \ for\n               post-processing. The post-processors can be a display\n\
    \               agent, an automated troubleshooting program, an\n            \
    \   event logging program, etc.  Presently, monitors for\n               tracking\
    \ reachability, SNMP traps, data throughput\n               rate, and nameservers\
    \ have been developed and are in\n               use.  Addition of more monitoring\
    \ agents is easy and\n               they will be added as necessary.  A display\
    \ agent-\n               nocol(1) using curses has already been developed. Work\n\
    \               on an \"intelligent\" module is currently in progress for\n  \
    \             event logging and some automatic troubleshooting.\n            \
    \   All data collected by the monitoring agents follows a\n               fixed\
    \ (non-readable) format. Each data entry is termed\n               an event in\
    \ NOCOL, and each event has certain flags and\n               severity associated\
    \ with it. The display agent\n               nocol(1), displays the output of\
    \ these monitoring\n               agents depending on the severity of the event.\
    \ There\n               can be multiple displays running simultanously and\n \
    \              all process the same set of monitored data.\n               There\
    \ are four levels of severity associated with an\n               event- CRITICAL,\
    \ ERROR, WARNING and INFO. The severity\n               level is controlled independently\
    \ by the monitoring\n               agents, and the decision to raise or set an\
    \ event's\n               severity to any level depends on the logic imbedded\
    \ in\n               the monitoring agent.\n               As an example, for\
    \ the pingmon(8) monitor, if a site is\n               unreachable via ping, it\
    \ would be assigned a severity\n               of WARNING by pingmon, which would\
    \ then elevate to\n               CRITICAL if the site is still unreachable after\
    \ some\n               time. In the case of trapmon(8), an SNMP trap message\n\
    \               of EGP neighbor lost would be directly assigned a\n          \
    \     severity level of CRITICAL, while an Warm Start trap is\n              \
    \ assigned a severity of WARNING.\n               The display agent (and other\
    \ data post-processors)\n               would use this event severity to decide\
    \ whether to\n               display it (or troubleshoot/log it) depending on\
    \ the\n               user selected display severity level.\n               The\
    \ software is very flexible and allows enhancements\n               and development\
    \ with a minimum amount of effort. The\n               display module processes\
    \ all the files present in the\n               data directory, and displays them\
    \ sequentially. This\n               allows new monitoring programs to simply\
    \ start\n               generating data in the data directory and the display\n\
    \               module will automatically start displaying the new\n         \
    \      data. The monitoring tools can be changed, and the only\n             \
    \  element that has to remain common between all the\n               modules is\
    \ the EVENT data structure.\n          CURRENT MODULES\n               NOCOL presently\
    \ consists of the following modules:\n          nocol\n               which simply\
    \ displays the data collected by the\n               monitoring agents.  It uses\
    \ the curses screen\n               management system to support a wide variety\
    \ of terminal\n               types. The criterion for displaying an event is:\n\
    \               1. Severity level of the event is higher than the\n          \
    \        severity level set in the display.\n               2. The display filter\
    \ (if set) matches some string in\n                  the event line.\n       \
    \        The display can be in regular 80 column mode or in\n               extended\
    \ 132 column mode.  Critical events are\n               displayed in reverse video\
    \ (if the terminal type\n               supports it). Additional features like\
    \ displaying\n               informational messages in a part of the window,\n\
    \               automatic resizing window sizes, operator\n               acknowledgement\
    \ via a bell when a new event goes\n               critical are also available.\n\
    \          ippingmon\n               which monitors the reachability of a site\
    \ via \"ICMP\"\n               ping packets (ICMP was preferred over SNMP for\
    \ many\n               obvious reasons). This program can use the default out-\n\
    \               put from the system's ping program, but an accompanying\n    \
    \           program ( multiping) can ping multiple IP sites at the\n         \
    \      same time and is preferable for monitoring a large list\n             \
    \  of sites.  A site is marked unreachable if a certain\n               number\
    \ of packets is lost, and the severity level is\n               increased each\
    \ time that the site tests unreachable.\n          osipingmon\n              \
    \ which is similar to the ippingmon module but uses the\n               OSI ping\
    \ program instead. No multiple ping program for\n               OSI sites has\
    \ been developed at this time.  The only\n               requirement is that the\
    \ system's ping program output\n               match the typical BSD IP ping program's\
    \ output.\n          nsmon\n               which monitors the nameservers (named)\
    \ on the list of\n               specified hosts. It periodically sends an SOA\
    \ query for\n               the default domain and if the queried nameservers\n\
    \               cannot resolve the query, then the site is elevated to\n     \

    \ throughput (kbits per second) to a\n               list of hosts.  The program\
    \ connects to the discard\n               socket on the remote machine (using\
    \  a  STREAM  socket)\n               and sends large packets for a small amount\
    \ of time to\n               evaluate the effective throughput. It elevates a\
    \ site\n               to WARNING level if the throughput drops below a\n    \
    \           certain threshold (set in the configuration file).\n          trapmon\n\
    \               Converts all SNMP traps into a format suitable for\n         \
    \      displaying using NOCOL.  The severity of the various\n               traps\
    \ is preset (and can be changed during compilation\n               time).\n  \
    \   PLATFORM\n          Any Unix system with the curses screen management library\n\
    \          and IP (Internet Protocol) programming facility. It has been\n    \
    \      tested on Sun Sparc 4.1.1, Ultrix, and NeXT systems. Porting\n        \
    \  to other platforms might require minor adjustments depending\n          on\
    \ the vagaries of the different vendors (mostly in the\n          include files).\n\
    \     AVAILABILITY\n          NOCOL was developed at JvNCnet and has been in use\
    \ for\n          monitoring the JvNCnet wide area network since 1989.\n      \
    \    It is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.jvnc.net under\n          pub/jvncnet-packages/nocol.tar.Z.\
    \  The system running at\n          JvNCet can be viewed by logging into the host\
    \ nocol.jvnc.net\n          with username nocol (an rlogin instead of telnet will\
    \ handle\n          your X window terminal types better).\n          To be added\

    \      NAME\n               NPRV -- IP Node/Protocol Reachability Verifier\n \
    \         KEYWORDS\n               map, routing, status; IP; ping; VMS; free.\n\
    \          ABSTRACT\n               NPRV is a full-screen, keypad-oriented utility\
    \ that\n               runs under VAX/VMS.  It allows the user to quickly scan\n\
    \               through a user-defined list of IP addresses (or domain\n     \
    \          names) and verify a node's reachability.  The node's\n            \
    \   reachability is determined by performing an ICMP echo,\n               UDP\
    \ echo and a TCP echo at alternating three second\n               intervals. \
    \ The total number of packets sent and\n               received are displayed,\
    \ as well as the minimum, average\n               and maximum round-trip times\
    \ (in milliseconds) for each\n               type of echo.  Additionally, a \"\
    trace route\" function\n               is performed to determine the path from\
    \ the local sys-\n               tem to the remote host.  Once all of the trace\
    \ route\n               information has filled the screen, a \"snapshot\" of the\n\
    \               screen can be written to a text file.  Upon exiting the\n    \
    \           utility, these text files can be used to generate a\n            \
    \   logical network map showing host and gateway intercon-\n               nectivity.\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               The ICMP echo is performed by sending ICMP\
    \ ECHO REQUEST\n               packets.  The UDP and TCP echoes are performed\
    \ by con-\n               necting to the UDP/TCP echo ports (port number 7). \
    \ The\n               trace route information is compiled by sending alter-\n\
    \               nating ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets and UDP packets with\n      \
    \         very large destination UDP port numbers (in two\n               passes).\
    \  Each packet is initially sent with a TTL\n               (time to live) of\
    \ 1.  This should cause an ICMP TIME\n               EXCEEDED error to be generated\
    \ by the first routing\n               gateway.  Then each packet is sent with\
    \ a TTL of 2.\n               This should cause an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED error to\
    \ be\n               generated by the second routing gateway.  Then each\n   \
    \            packet is sent with a TTL of 3, and so on.  This pro-\n         \
    \      cess continues until an ICMP ECHO REPLY or UDP PORT\n               UNREACHABLE\
    \ is received.  This indicates that the\n               remote host has been reached\
    \ and that the trace route\n               information is complete.\n        \
    \  CAVEATS\n               This utility sends one echo packet per second (ICMP,\n\
    \               UDP or TCP), as well as sending out one trace route\n        \
    \       packet per second.  If a transmitted trace route packet\n            \
    \   is returned in less than one second, another trace\n               route packet\
    \ is sent in 100 milliseconds.  This could\n               cause a significant\
    \ amount of contention on the local\n               network.\n          BUGS\n\

    \ status; IP; ping; DOS, UNIX, VMS; free.\n          ABSTRACT\n              \
    \ Ping is perhaps the most basic tool for internet\n               management.\
    \  It verifies that a remote IP implementa-\n               tion and the intervening\
    \ networks and interfaces are\n               functional.  It can be used to measure\
    \ round trip\n               delay.  Numerous versions of the ping program exist.\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               Ping is based on the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST message.\n\
    \          CAVEATS\n               If run repeatedly, ping could generate high\
    \ system\n               loads.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n\
    \          LIMITATIONS\n               PC/TCP's ping is the only implementation\
    \ known support\n               both loose and strict source routing.  Though\
    \ some ping\n               implementations support the ICMP \"record route\"\n\
    \               feature, the usefulness of this option for debugging\n       \
    \        routes is limited by the fact that many gateways do not\n           \
    \    correctly implement it.\n          HARDWARE REQUIRED\n               No restrictions.\n\

    \      NAME\n               Sniffer\n          KEYWORDS\n               analyzer,\
    \ generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet, IP,\n               NFS, OSI, ring, SMTP,\
    \ star; eavesdrop; standalone.\n          ABSTRACT\n               The Network\
    \ General Sniffer is a protocol analyzer for\n               performing LAN diagnostics,\
    \ monitoring, traffic genera-\n               tion, and troubleshooting.  The\
    \ Sniffer protocol\n               analyzer has the capability of capturing every\
    \ packet\n               on a network and of decoding all seven layers of the\n\
    \               OSI protocol model.  Capture frame selection is based\n      \
    \         on several different filters: protocol content at lower\n          \
    \     levels; node addresses; pattern matching (up to 8\n               logically-related\
    \ patterns of 32 bytes each); and des-\n               tination class.  Users\
    \ may extend the protocol\n               interpretation capability of the Sniffer\
    \ by writing\n               their own customized protocol interpreters and linking\n\
    \               them to the Sniffer software.\n               The Sniffer displays\
    \ network traffic information and\n               performance statistics in real\
    \ time, in user-selectable\n               formats.  Numeric station addresses\
    \ are translated to\n               symbolic names or manufacturer ID names. \
    \ Network\n               activities measured include frames accepted, Kbytes\n\
    \               accepted, and buffer use.  Each network version has\n        \
    \       additional counters for activities specific to that\n               network.\
    \  Network activity is expressed as\n               frames/second, Kbytes/second,\
    \ or per cent of network\n               bandwidth utilization.\n            \
    \   Data collection by the Sniffer may be output to printer\n               or\
    \ stored to disk in either print-file or spread-sheet\n               format.\n\
    \               Protocol suites understood by the Sniffer include:\n         \
    \      Banyan Vines, IBM Token-Ring, Novell Netware, XNS/MS-\n               Net\
    \ (3Com 3+), DECnet, TCP/IP (including SNMP and\n               applications-layer\
    \ protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and\n               TELNET), X Windows (for X version\
    \ 11), NFS, and several\n               SUN proprietary protocols (including mount,\
    \ pmap, RPC,\n               and YP).  Supported LANs include: ethernet, Token-ring\n\
    \               (4Mb and 16Mb versions), ARCNET, StarLAN, IBM PC Net-\n      \
    \         work (Broadband), and Apple Localtalk Network.\n          MECHANISM\n\
    \               The Sniffer is a self-contained, portable protocol\n         \
    \      analyzer that require only AC line power and connection\n             \
    \  to a network to operate.  Normally passive (except when\n               in\
    \ Traffic Generator mode), it captures images of all\n               or of selected\
    \ frames in a working buffer, ready for\n               immediate analysis and\
    \ display.\n               The Sniffer is a standalone device.  Two platforms\
    \ are\n               available: one for use with single network topologies,\n\
    \               the other for use with multi-network topologies.  Both\n     \
    \          include Sniffer core software, a modified network\n               interface\
    \ card (or multiple cards), and optional proto-\n               col interpreter\
    \ suites.\n               All Sniffer functions may be remotely controlled from\
    \ a\n               modem-connected PC.  Output from the Sniffer can be\n    \
    \           imported to database or spreadsheet packages.\n          CAVEATS\n\
    \               In normal use, the Sniffer is a passive device, and so\n     \
    \          will not adversely effect network performance.  Perfor-\n         \
    \      mance degradation will be observed, of course, if the\n               Sniffer\
    \ is set to Traffic Generator mode and connected\n               to an active\
    \ network.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n\
    \               None reported.\n          HARDWARE REQUIRED\n               None.\
    \  The Sniffer is a self-contained unit, and\n               includes its own\
    \ interface card.  It installs into a\n               network as would any normal\

    \               The SNMP Development Kit comprises C Language source\n       \
    \        code for a programming library that facilitates access\n            \
    \   to the management services of the SNMP (RFC 1098).\n               Sources\
    \ are also included for a few simple client\n               applications whose\
    \ main purpose is to illustrate the\n               use of the library.  Example\
    \ client applications query\n               remote SNMP agents in a variety of\
    \ modes, and generate\n               or collect SNMP traps.  Code for an example\
    \ SNMP agent\n               that supports a subset of the Internet MIB (RFC 1066)\n\
    \               is also included.\n          MECHANISM\n               The Development\
    \ Kit facilitates development of SNMP-\n               based management applications\
    \ -- both clients and\n               agents.  Example applications execute SNMP\

    \             None reported.\n          HARDWARE REQUIRED\n               The\
    \ SNMP library source code is highly portable and\n               runs on a wide\
    \ range of platforms.\n          SOFTWARE REQUIRED\n               The SNMP library\
    \ source code has almost no operating\n               system dependencies and\
    \ runs in a wide range of\n               environments.  Certain portions of the\
    \ example SNMP\n               agent code are specific to the 4.3BSD implementation\
    \ of\n               the UNIX system for the DEC MicroVAX.\n          AVAILABILITY\n\

    \        ABSTRACT\n                The SNMP Libraries and Utilities serve two\
    \ purposes:\n                1)   to act as building blocks for the construction\
    \ of\n                     SNMP-based agent and manager applications; and\n  \
    \              2)   to act as network management tools for network\n         \
    \            fire fighting and report generation.\n                The libraries\
    \ perform ASN.1 parsing and generation tasks\n                for both network\
    \ management station applications and\n                network management agent\
    \ applications.  These libraries\n                hide the details of ASN.1 parsing\
    \ and generation from\n                application writers and make it unnecessary\
    \ for them to\n                be expert in these areas.  The libraries are very\
    \ robust\n                with considerable error checking designed in.  The\n\
    \                several command line utilities include applications for\n   \
    \             retrieving one or many variables, retrieving tables, or\n      \
    \          effecting commands via the setting of remote network\n            \
    \    management variables.\n        MECHANISM\n                The parsing is\
    \ performed via recursive descent methods.\n                Messages are passed\

    \          Internet Tool Catalog                          SPIDERMONITOR\n    \
    \      NAME\n               SpiderMonitor P220, K220 and\n               SpiderAnalyzer\
    \ P320, K320\n          KEYWORDS\n               alarm, analyzer, generator, traffic;\
    \ DECnet, ethernet,\n               IP, OSI; eavesdrop; standalone; sourcelib.\n\
    \          ABSTRACT\n               The SpiderMonitor and SpiderAnalyzer are protocol\n\
    \               analyzers for performing ethernet LAN diagnostics, mon-\n    \
    \           itoring, traffic generation, and troubleshooting.  The\n         \
    \      SpiderMonitor has the capability of capturing every\n               packet\
    \ on a network and of decoding the first four\n               layers of the OSI\
    \ protocol model.  The SpiderAnalyzer\n               has additional software\
    \ for decoding higher protocol\n               layers.  Protocol suites understood:\
    \ TCP/IP (including\n               SNMP and applications-layer protocols), OSI,\
    \ XNS, DEC-\n               net and IPX.  User-definable decodes can be written\
    \ in\n               'C' with the Microsoft version 5.0 'C' compiler.  A\n   \
    \            decode guide is provided.\n               The SpiderAnalyzer supports\
    \ multiple simultaneous\n               filters for capturing packets using predefined\
    \ patterns\n               and error states.  Filter patterns can also trigger\
    \ on\n               NOT matching 1 or more filters, an alarm, or a speci-\n \
    \              fied time.\n               The SpiderAnalyzer can also employ TDR\
    \ (Time Domain\n               Reflectometry) to find media faults, open or short\
    \ cir-\n               cuits, or transceiver faults.  It can transmit OSI,\n \
    \              XNS, and Xerox link-level echo packets to user-\n             \
    \  specified stations, performs loop round tests.\n               In traffic generation\
    \ mode, the SpiderAnalyzer has the\n               ability to generate packets\
    \ at random intervals of ran-\n               dom lengths or any combination of\
    \ random or fixed\n               interval or length, generation of packets with\
    \ CRC\n               errors, or packets that are too short, or packets that\n\
    \               are too long.\n               Output from the SpiderMonitor/Analyzer\
    \ can be imported\n               to database or spreadsheet packages.\n     \
    \     MECHANISM\n               The SpiderMonitor and Spider Analyzer are available\
    \ as\n               stand-alone, IBM PC compatible packages based upon a\n  \
    \             Compaq III portable system, or as a plug-in boards for\n       \
    \        any IBM XT/AT compatible machine.  The model 220 (Spi-\n            \
    \   derMonitor) systems provide a functional base suited\n               for most\
    \ network management needs.  The model 320 (Spi-\n               derAnalyzer)\
    \ systems provide extended functionality in\n               the development mode\
    \ and traffic generation mode as\n               well more filtering capabilities\
    \ than the 220 models.\n          CAVEATS\n               Traffic generation will\
    \ congest an operational ether-\n               net.\n          BUGS\n       \
    \        None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n               Monitoring of up to\
    \ 1024 stations and buffering of up\n               to 1500 packets.  The model\
    \ 220 provides for 3 filters\n               with a filter depth of 46 bytes.\
    \  The model 320 pro-\n               vides for 4 filters and a second level of\
    \ filtering\n               with a filter depth of 64 bytes.\n          HARDWARE\
    \ REQUIRED\n               PX20s are self contained, the KX20s require an IBM\n\
    \               PC/XT-AT compatible machine with 5 megabytes of hard\n       \
    \        disk storage and the spare slot into which the board\n              \
    \ kit is plugged.\n          SOFTWARE REQUIRED\n               None.  The SpiderAnalyzer\
    \ requires the Microsoft 'C'\n               Compiler, Version 5.0 for writing\
    \ user defined decodes.\n          AVAILABILITY\n               The SpiderMonitor/Analyzer\

    \             SPIMS is used to measure the performance of protocol\n         \
    \       and \"protocol-like\" services including response time\n             \
    \   (two-way delay), throughput and the time to open and\n                close\
    \ connections.  It has been used to:\n                o    benchmark alternative\
    \ protocol implementations,\n                o    observe how performance varies\
    \ when parameters in\n                        specific implementations have been\
    \ varied (i.e.,\n                        to tune parameters).\n              \
    \  SPIMS currently has interfaces to the DoD Internet Pro-\n                tocols:\
    \ UDP, TCP, FTP, SunRPC, the OSI protocols from\n                the ISODE 4.0\
    \ distribution package: FTAM, ROSE, ISO TP0\n                and to Sunlink 5.2\
    \ ISO TP4 as well as Stanford's VMTP.\n                Also available are a rudimentary\
    \ set of benchmarks,\n                stubs for new protocol interfaces and a\
    \ user manual.\n                For an example of the use of SPIMS to tune protocols,\n\

    \         SPIMS runs as user processes and uses a TCP connection\n           \
    \     for measurement set-up.  Measurements take place\n                between\
    \ processes over the measured protocol.  SPIMS\n                generates messages\
    \ and transfers them via the measured\n                protocol service according\
    \ to a user-supplied specifi-\n                cation.  SPIMS has a unique measurement\
    \ specification\n                language that is used to specify a measurement\
    \ session.\n                In the language there are constructs for different\n\
    \                application types (e.g., bulk data transfer), for\n         \
    \       specifying frequency and sequence of messages, for dis-\n            \
    \    tribution over message sizes and for combining basic\n                specifications.\
    \  These specifications are independent\n                of both protocols and\
    \ protocol implementations and can\n                be used for benchmarking.\

    \              software.  Tcplogger records timestamped information\n        \
    \       from TCP and IP packets that are sent and received on a\n            \
    \   specified connection.  For each TCP packet, information\n               such\
    \ as sequence number, acknowledgement sequence\n               number, packet\
    \ size, and header flags is recorded.  For\n               an IP packet, header\
    \ length, packet length and TTL\n               values are recorded.  Customized\

    \         traceroute\n          KEYWORDS\n               routing; IP; ping; UNIX,\
    \ VMS; free.\n          ABSTRACT\n               Traceroute is a tool that allows\
    \ the route taken by\n               packets from source to destination to be\
    \ discovered.\n               It can be used for situations where the IP record\
    \ route\n               option would fail, such as intermediate gateways dis-\n\
    \               carding packets, routes that exceed the capacity of an\n     \
    \          datagram, or intermediate IP implementations that don't\n         \
    \      support record route.  Round trip delays between the\n               source\
    \ and intermediate gateways are also reported\n               allowing the determination\
    \ of individual gateways con-\n               tribution to end-to-end delay.\n\
    \               Enhanced versions of traceroute have been developed\n        \
    \       that allow specification of loose source routes for\n               datagrams.\
    \  This allows one to investigate the return\n               path from remote\
    \ machines back to the local host.\n          MECHANISM\n               Traceroute\
    \ relies on the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED error\n               reporting mechanism.\
    \  When an IP packet is received by\n               an gateway with a time-to-live\
    \ value of 0, an ICMP\n               packet is sent to the host which generated\
    \ the packet.\n               By sending packets to a destination with a TTL of\
    \ 0,\n               the next hop can be identified as the source of the\n   \
    \            ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message.  By incrementing the TTL\n          \
    \     field the subsequent hops can be identified.  Each\n               packet\
    \ sent out is also time stamped.  The time stamp\n               is returned as\
    \ part of the ICMP packet so a round trip\n               delay can be calculated.\n\
    \          CAVEATS\n               Some IP implementations forward packets with\
    \ a TTL of\n               0, thus escaping identification.  Others use the TTL\n\
    \               field in the arriving packet as the TTL for the ICMP\n       \
    \        error reply, which delays identification.\n               Sending datagrams\
    \ with the source route option will\n               cause some gateways to crash.\
    \  It is considered poor\n               form to repeat this behavior.\n     \
    \     BUGS\n               None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n              \

    \   alarm, control, manager, security, status;\n                ethernet, FDDI,\
    \ IP; X; UNIX.\n          ABSTRACT\n                The Paramax Network Security\
    \ Server (NSS) is a\n                security officer's tool for centralized security\n\
    \                management of TCP/IP-based networks.  The NSS provides\n    \
    \            capability for collection, on-line storage,\n                maintenance,\
    \ and correlation of audit data from hosts,\n                workstations, servers,\
    \ and network devices.  Through\n                the X window based user interface,\
    \ a security officer\n                can review and analyze this audit data at\
    \ the NSS,\n                select and request filtered portions of host audit\n\
    \                data, and receive and analyze security alerts from\n        \
    \        across the network.  The NSS supports centralized\n                access\
    \ control of network resources through its\n                capability to create\
    \ and update user and host access\n                permissions data.  The user\
    \ access permissions data\n                identifies network addresses that each\
    \ user is\n                permitted to access.  The host access permissions data\n\
    \                identifies network addresses between which\n                communication\
    \ is permitted.  The NSS supports\n                centralized management of user\
    \ authentication data\n                (user IDs and passwords) and other user\
    \ data for use\n                by hosts, workstations, and servers in the network.\n\
    \                It generates pseudo-random pronounceable passwords for\n    \
    \            selection and assignment to users by the security officer.\n    \
    \            The NSS deadman timer locks the NSS screen or logs the\n        \
    \        security officer off the NSS after periods of\n                inactivity.\
    \  A biometric authentication device is\n                optional for rigorous\
    \ fingerprint authentication of\n                users at the NSS, and logins\
    \ to the NSS itself are\n                permitted only at the console.  The NSS\
    \ currently\n                provides centralized security management for a System\
    \ High\n                Network.  It is being upgraded for a Compartmented Mode\n\
    \                environment.\n          MECHANISM\n                The NSS uses\
    \ the Audit Information Transfer Protocol\n                (AITP) for the transfer\
    \ of security alerts and audit\n                data.  AITP is NOT proprietary,\
    \ and the specification\n                is available from the address listed\
    \ below.  Access to\n                the NSS audit database is provided via the\
    \ Structured\n                Query Language (SQL).\n          CAVEATS\n     \

    \       ABSTRACT\n                Xnetdb is a network monitoring tool based on\
    \ X Windows\n                and SNMP which also has integrated database and\n\
    \                statistic viewing capabilities.  Xnetdb will determine\n    \
    \            and display the status of routers and circuits it has\n         \
    \       been told to monitor by querying the designated sites\n              \
    \  and displaying the result.  It can also query the\n                status of\
    \ certain designated SNMP variables, such as a\n                default route\
    \ for an important router.  Additionally,\n                it also has integrated\
    \ database functionality in that\n                it can display additional information\
    \ about a site or\n                circuit such as the equipment at the site,\
    \ the contact\n                person(s) for the site, and other useful information.\n\
    \                Finally it can gather designated statistical\n              \
    \  information about a circuit and display it on demand.\n        MECHANISM\n\
    \                Xnetdb uses SNMP or ping to monitor things which its\n      \
    \          configured to monitor.  It dynamically builds a\n                network\
    \ map on its display by querying entities and\n                obtaining IP addresses\
    \ and subnet masks.  A\n                configuration file tells xnetdb which\
    \ IP hosts you\n                want to monitor.\n        CAVEATS\n          \
    \      While \"ping\" can be used to monitor hosts, more useful\n            \
    \    results are obtained using SNMP.\n        BUGS\n                Bugs and\

    \ X window system.\n                XNETMON's network management tools for configuration,\n\
    \                performance, security, and fault management have been\n     \
    \           used successfully with a wide assortment of wide- and\n          \
    \      local-area-network topologies and medias.\n                Multiprotocol\
    \ devices are supported\n                including those using TCP/IP, DECnet,\
    \ and OSI\n                protocols.\n        Some features of XNETMON's network\
    \ management tools include:\n                o Fault management tool displays\
    \ a map of the network\n                  configuration with node and link state\
    \ indicated\n                  in one of several colors to indicate current status;\n\
    \                o Configuration management tool may be used to edit the\n   \
    \               network management information base stored in the\n          \
    \        NMS to reflect changes occurring in the network;\n                o Graphs\
    \ and tabular tools for use in fault and performance\n                  management\

    \         for generating and parsing SNMP messages.\n        MECHANISM\n     \
    \           XNETMON is based on the Simple Network Management\n              \
    \  Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is performed via the\n                powerful SNMP\
    \ get-next operator and the SNMP get\n                operator.  Trap-directed\
    \ polling is used to regulate\n                        focus and intensity of\
    \ the polling.\n        CAVEATS\n                None.\n        BUGS\n       \

    \         xnetmon, xpmon\n          KEYWORDS\n               alarm, manager, map,\
    \ status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.\n          ABSTRACT\n               Xnetmon and\
    \ xpmon provide graphical representation of\n               performance and status\
    \ of SNMP-capable network ele-\n               ments.  Xnetmon presents a schematic\
    \ network map\n               representing the up/down status of network elements;\n\
    \               xpmon draws a pen plot style graph of the change over\n      \
    \         time of any arbitrary MIB object (RFC1066).  Both xnet-\n          \
    \     mon and xpmon use the SNMP (RFC1098) for retrieving\n               status\
    \ and performance data.\n          MECHANISM\n               Xnetmon polls network\
    \ elements for the status of their\n               interfaces on a controllable\
    \ polling interval.  Pop-up\n               windows displaying the values of any\
    \ MIB variable are\n               supported by separate polls.  When SNMP traps\
    \ are\n               received from a network element, that element and all\n\
    \               adjacent elements are immediately re-polled to update\n      \
    \         their status.  The layout of the network map is stati-\n           \
    \    cally configured.  Xpmon repeatedly polls (using SNMP)\n               the\
    \ designated network element for the value of the\n               designated MIB\
    \ variable on the user-specified interval.\n               The change in the variable\
    \ is then plotted on the strip\n               chart.  The strip chart regularly\
    \ adjusts its scale to\n               the current maximum value on the graph.\n\
    \          CAVEATS\n               Polling intervals should be chosen with care\
    \ so as not\n               to affect system performance adversely.\n        \

    \ is a XNETMON tool used to produce plots of\n                SNMP variables in\
    \ graphical displays.  The manager may\n                easily customize the labels,\
    \ step size, update interval,\n                and variables to be plotted to\
    \ produce graphs for fault\n                and performance management.  Scales\
    \ automatically adjust\n                whenever a point to be plotted would go\
    \ off scale.\n        MECHANISM\n                The xnetperfmon application communicates\
    \ with remote\n                agents or proxy agents via the Simple Network Management\n\
    \                Protocol (SNMP).\n        CAVEATS\n                All plots\
    \ for a single invocation of xnetperfmon must be\n                for variables\
    \ provided by a single network management\n                agent.  However, multiple\
    \ invocations of xnetperfmon may\n                be active on a single display\
    \ simultaneously or proxy\n                agents may be used to summarize information\
    \ at a common\n                point.\n        BUGS\n                None known.\n\

  - "NFSTRACE\n   This is the rpcspy/nfstrace package.\n   It is described in detail\
    \ in the paper \"NFS Tracing by Passive\n   Network Monitoring\", which appeared\
    \ in the January, 1992 USENIX\n   conference.\n   You'll need either a DEC machine\
    \ running ULTRIX (with the\n   packetfilter installed in the kernel) or a Sun\
    \ running SunOS 4.x\n   (with NIT).  Or you'll need to do a bit of hacking.\n\
    \   The package differs slightly from the version in the paper:\n   - The handle->name\
    \ translation facility has been removed.  It's\n     just too fragile to include\
    \ in the general release.  If you need it,\n     contact me directly and I'll\
    \ be happy to mail you the code.\n   - The output format is a wee-bit different.\n\
    \   - The IBM-RT Enet filter version is also not included, since I seem to\n \
    \    be the only person in the world running it.  RTs are really too slow\n  \
    \   for this anyway.\n   To configure the package, edit the makefile in the obvious\
    \ (to me at\n   least) way.\n   Note that the not all versions of SunOS NIT have\
    \ working versions of\n   the packet timestamp mechanism.  Try to set the -DSTAMPS\
    \ option in\n   the makefile, and if that doesn't work, take it out.\n   If you\
    \ are actually going to use this to gather traces, I'd like to\n   hear from you!\

  - "NETTEST\n     nettest, nettestd - Performs client and server functions for\n\
    \     timing data throughput\n     The nettest and nettestd commands invoke client\
    \  and  server\n     programs that are used for timing data throughput of various\n\
    \     methods of interprocess communication.  For TCP and OSI con-\n     nections,\
    \  the nettest program establishes a connection with\n     the nettestd program,\
    \ and then it does count writes of  size\n     bytes,  followed by count reads\
    \ of size bytes.  For UDP, the\n     nettest program performs only writes;  reads\
    \  are  not  per-\n     formed.  The nettestd program, if used with UDP connections,\n\
    \     reads the data packets and prints a message  for  each  data\n     packet\
    \  it  receives.   The number and size of the reads and\n     writes may not correlate\
    \ with the number  and  size  of  the\n     actual  data packets that are transferred;\
    \ it depends on the\n     protocol that is chosen.  If you append an optional\
    \ k (or K)\n     to  the  size, count, or bufsize value, the number specified\n\
    \     is multiplied by 1024.\n   This source for nettest and nettestd are provided\
    \ on an \"as is\"\n   basis.  Cray Research does not provide any support for this\
    \ code\n   (unless you are a customer who has purchased the UNICOS operating\n\
    \   system).\n   We will gladly take bug reports for nettest/nettestd.  Suggested\n\
    \   fixes are prefered to just bug reports.  Changes to allow\n   nettest/nettestd\
    \ to run on other architectures are also welcomed.  We\n   will try to incorporate\
    \ bugfixes and update the publicly available\n   code, but we can make no guarantees.\n\

    \   Availability:\n           ftp sgi.com:/sgi/src/nettest\n   ETHERCK\n   etherck\
    \ is a simple program that displays Sun ethernet statistics.\n   If you have a\
    \ high percents of input errors that are due to \"out of\n   buffers\", then you\
    \ can run the \"iepatch\" script to patch a kernel\n   that uses the Intel ethernet\
    \ chip (\"ie\").  A back of the envelope\n   calculation shows that a .25% input\
    \ error rate gives about a 10%\n   degradation of NFS performance if 8k packets\
    \ are being used.\n   In our environment at Legato, patching the ie buffer allocation\
    \ made\n   the input error rate drop more than 2 orders of magnitude.  This was\n\
    \   after we had applied other networking fixes (e.g., using Prestoserve,\n  \
    \ going from thin wire to twisted pair) and pushed a higher load on the\n   server.\n\
    \   Note that both etherck and iepatch must be run by root (or you can\n   make\
    \ etherck setgid kmem).\n   Availability:\n           send EMAIL to:         \
    \ request@legato.com\n           with a Subject line:    send unsupported etherck\n\
    \   The following is part of the 'help' file from the Legato Email\n   Server:\n\
    \   This message comes to you from the request server at Legato.COM,\n   request@Legato.COM.\
    \  It received a message from you asking for help.\n   The request server is a\
    \ mail-response program.  That means that you\n   mail it a request, and it mails\
    \ back the response.\n   The request server is a very dumb program.  It does not\
    \ have much\n   error checking.  If you don't send it the commands that it\n \
    \  understands, it will just answer \"I don't understand you\".\n   The request\
    \ server has 4 commands.  Each command must be the first\n   word on a line. \
    \ The request server reads your entire message before\n   it does anything, so\
    \ you can have several different commands in a\n   single message.  The request\
    \ server treats the \"Subject:\" header line\n   just like any other line of the\
    \ message.  You can use any combination\n   of upper and lower case letters in\
    \ the commands.\n   The request server's files are organized into a series of\
    \ directories\n   and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each\n\
    \   subdirectory has an index.  The top-level index gives you an overview\n  \
    \ of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory\n   tells\
    \ you what is in it.\n   The server has 4 commands:\n   \"help\" command: The\
    \ command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to\n           send you\
    \ the help file.  You already know this, of course,\n           because you are\
    \ reading the help file.  No other commands are\n           honored in a message\
    \ that asks for help (the server figures\n           that you had better read\
    \ the help message before you do\n           anything else).\n   SEND a request\
    \ to Legato to get the rest of the help file!\n   NETCK\n   netck is a shar file\
    \ that contains the sources to build \"netck\", a\n   network checker that uses\
    \ the rstat(3R) protocol to gather and print\n   statistics from machines on the\
    \ network.  netck is useful to help\n   understand what part of what machines\
    \ are potential NFS bottlenecks.\n   To get this file, send email to the request\
    \ server with the command\n   \"send unsupported netck\".\n   Availability:\n\
    \           same as ETHERCK (send email To: request@legato.com; subject:\n   \
    \        HELP)\n"
