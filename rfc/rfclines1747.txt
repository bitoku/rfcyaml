Abstract This specification defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with SNMP based network management.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and control of data link controls in an SNA environment.
This draft identifies managed objects for SNA Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) links only.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
This memo identifies the proposed set of objects for configuring, monitoring, and controlling SDLC ports and link stations.
Tables Defined in the SNADLC SDLC MIB
The SNADLC MIB is composed of two managed entities with three tables each.
Considering the above combinations, the following are the actual tables found in this MIB: 1)   Port Administration Table, 2)   Port Operation Table, 3)
Port Statistics Table, 4)   Link Station Administration Table, 5)   Link Station Operation Table, 6)   Link Station Statistics Table.
All variables in this MIB relate to SDLC ports and link stations only.
Any variable relating to higher layer entities in SNA such as Physical Units (PU) and Logical Units (LU) are found in the SNA NAU MIB [4].
Row Creation Mechanism Row creation mechanism for the sdlcLSAdminTable is based on the use of the RowStatus object.
It follows the rules for the use in SNMPv1 context proposed in the memo "Row creation with SNMPv1" [5].
Before accepting the destroy value for an entry, an agent has to verify the operational state of the corresponding entry in the sdlcLSOperTable entry.
Relationship to the Interfaces Group
This memo shall conform to the recommendations of [6].
The SDLC layer of each SDLC Port shall be modeled by a row in the ifTable with an ifType using the IANA assigned number for SDLC (17).
Each SDLC port interface must comply with the following conformance groups in [6]:
An implementation may optionally comply with the ifTestGroup defined in that memo to execute vendor specific tests.
An example of this would be to perform LPDA test functions.
The SDLC port's relation with its physical, or lower layer interface (i.e., RS 232, V.35, etc.) shall be modeled by a row in the ifStackTable with the ifStackHigherLayer pointing to the SDLC port ifTable instance and the ifStackLowerLayer pointing to the physical media specific ifTable instance.
The media specific objects of these lower layer interfaces will, of course, be described in their respective MIBs (i.e., [1]).
The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for all the interface group objects listed in the conformance tables above.
Each SDLC port is represented by an ifEntry.
All SDLC port tables shall be indexed by ifIndex.
This object shall reflect the value of the corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associated lower layer interface.
A string denoting the physical location of the SDLC port within its node.
This shall have unique significance within each implementing node.
This object shall reflect the value of the corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associated lower layer interface.
This object shall reflect the value of the corresponding object in the ifEntry of the associated lower layer interface.
This object shall count packets received from a specific SDLC poll address.
Packets for the SDLC broadcast address of x'FF' are not counted.
Specific counters for these errors are kept in the sdlcPortStatsTable.
This counter shall return zero for SDLC ports.
This object shall count packets transmitted to a specific SDLC poll address (not x'FF').
Specific counters for these errors are kept in the sdlcPortStatsTable.
The value is 0 (not applicable to the SDLC layer).
This object shall count packets received on this interface addressed to the SDLC broadcast address (x'FF').
Only point to point ports supporting a secondary switched station should return non zero values.
The value is 0 (not applicable to the SDLC layer).
This object shall count packets transmitted on this interface which were addressed to the SDLC broadcast address (x'FF').
Only point to point ports supporting a primary switched station should return non zero values.
Should return false if this interface receives only packets addressed to its SDLC poll address(es).
However, in certain implementations, the lower layer interface shall present all frames to the SDLC port regardless of the poll address.
Such frames may be the result of a misconfigured peer or the secondary end of a multipoint connection.
Such implementations should return true for this object.
For each SDLC port there will be an ifStackEntry
with this object's value referring to the ifIndex of the SDLC port's ifEntry for the SDLC layer.
For each SDLC port there will be an ifStackEntry
with this object's value referring to the ifIndex of the physical layer interface's ifEntry for that SDLC port.

A link station comprises procedures and control information that coordinate the transfer of data between two nodes joined by a link connection.
All traffic over the link connection is from the primary link station to one or more secondary link stations, or from a secondary link station to the primary link station.
The link station instance on a link connection that is responsible for the control of the data link.
There must be only one primary link station on a link connection.
The primary link station issues commands to one or more secondary link stations.
secondary link station The link station instance on a link connection that receives commands from the primary link station and issues responses to it.
switched line A telecommunications line in which the connection is established by dialing.
For switched lines, the SDLC startup sequence typically begins with a null exchange identifier (null XID).
leased line A telecommunications line on which connections do not have to be established by dialing.
For leased lines, the SDLC startup sequence may or may not begin with an exchange identifer (XID).
While there are interface (e.g., RS.232) differences between leased and switched lines, those interface differences do not map one to one with differences in the SDLC startup protocol (i.e., the interface and the SDLC protocol are independent from one another).
A link that connects the single primary link station to single secondary link station.
A point to point link may be either switched or leased.
A link that connects the single primary link station to several secondary link stations.
A multipoint link may be either switched or leased.
Note: The physical interface signals for a multipoint link are different than for a point to point link.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
