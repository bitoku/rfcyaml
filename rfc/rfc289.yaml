  - "What We Hope Is An Official List of Host Names   Richard W. Watson\n   The enclosed\
    \ is what we hope will be accepted as a list of\n   official formal host names\
    \ and nicknames.  As no other subject\n   worked on by the NWG has generated so\
    \ much comment, it is\n   worthwhile to review briefly how this list came into\
    \ being.\n   The need for some standard set of names recognized by NCP's and\n\
    \   Telnets and usable on hardcopy to designate a persons affiliation\n   had\
    \ been recognized for some time and several sets of names were\n   in use.\n \
    \  Peggy Karp issued the first formal proposal of a set of standard\n   names\
    \ in RFC 226, NIC 7625.  This proposal was answered by a\n   number of counter\
    \ proposals and culminated in RFC 247, NIC 7688.\n   People still were not happy\
    \ with this proposal as names normally\n   associated with hosts or projects were\
    \ not used.\n   At the last NWG meeting a number of people discussed the name\n\
    \   problem and agreed that the only reasonable compromise solution\n   was to\
    \ have both formal names and nicknames and to let the people\n   at the hosts\
    \ choose their own names within the guideline which the\n   previous dialog had\
    \ seemed to agree on.\n   The guidelines were summarized in RFC 273, NIC 7837\
    \ and the NIC\n   agreed to collect and publish the names that the people at each\n\
    \   host indicated they desired.  A number of names were received and\n   a tentative\
    \ list was published as RFC 280, NIC 8060.  More people\n   responded with their\
    \ desired names or changed the ones in the\n   above list.\n   Almost all sites\
    \ have since responded and the following list\n   resulted.\n   I think people\
    \ should feel free to change their host name when\n   ever the situation warrants.\n\
