Abstract This document describes a type length value (TLV) for use in the IS  IS routing protocol that allows for the proper use of the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.
There exist certain scenarios in which IS IS will not react appropriately to a BFD detected forwarding plane failure without use of either this TLV or some other method.
The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [RFC5880] is a protocol that allows for detection of a forwarding plane failure between two routers.
A router can use [RFC5880] to validate that a peer router's forwarding ability is functioning.
One specific application of BFD as described in [RFC5882] is to verify the forwarding ability of an IS IS [RFC1195]
router's adjacencies; however, the method described in [RFC5882] does not allow for certain failure scenarios.
We will define a TLV that will allow for proper response to the detection of all forwarding failures where the use of BFD is employed with IS IS.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The Problem We observe that, in order to allow for mixed use (i.e., some routers running BFD and some not), [RFC5882] does not require a BFD session be established prior to the establishment of an IS IS adjacency.
Thus, if a router A has neighbors B and C, and B does not support BFD, A would still form adjacencies with B and C, and it would only establish a BFD session with C.
The problem with this solution is that it assumes that the transmission and receipt of IS IS Hellos (IIHs) shares fate with forwarded data packets.
This is not a fair assumption to make given that the primary use of BFD is to protect IPv4 (and IPv6) forwarding, and IS IS does not utilize IPv4 or IPv6 for sending or receiving its hellos.
Thus, if we consider our previous example, and if C is currently experiencing an IPv4 forwarding failure that allows for IIHs to be sent and received, when A first starts (or restarts), A will assume that C simply does not support BFD, will form an adjacency with C, and may incorrectly forward IPv4 traffic through C. 3.
A simple solution to this problem is for an IS IS router to advertise that it has BFD enabled on a given interface.
It can do this through the inclusion of a TLV in its IIHs as described in this document.
When sending an IIH on a BFD enabled interface, a router that supports this extension MUST include the BFD enabled TLV in its IIH.
The contents of the TLV MUST indicate what topologies/protocols [RFC5120] have been enabled for BFD by including the appropriate Multi Topology Identifier (MTID)/ Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) pairs.
When sending an IIH on an interface on which BFD is NOT enabled, a router MUST NOT include the BFD enabled TLV.
The following definitions apply to each IS IS neighbor: For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an "ISIS TOPO NLPID BFD REQUIRED" variable is assigned.
If BFD is supported by both the local system and the neighbor of the MTID/ NLPID, this variable is set to "TRUE".
Otherwise, the variable is set to "FALSE".
For each locally supported MTID, an "ISIS TOPO BFD REQUIRED" variable is set to the logical "OR" of all "ISIS TOPO NLPID BFD REQUIRED" variables associated with that MTID.
An "ISIS BFD REQUIRED" variable is set to the logical "AND" of all "ISIS TOPO BFD REQUIRED" variables.
For each locally supported MTID/NLPID pair, an "ISIS TOPO NLPID STATE" variable is assigned.
If "ISIS TOPO NLPID BFD REQUIRED" is "TRUE", this variable follows the BFD session state for that MTID/NLPID ("UP   TRUE").
Otherwise, the variable is set to "TRUE".
For each locally supported topology (MTID), an "ISIS TOPO USEABLE" variable is set to the logical "AND" of the set of "ISIS TOPO NLPID STATE" variables associated with that MTID.
An "ISIS NEIGHBOR USEABLE" variable is set to the logical "OR" of all
Whenever "ISIS BFD REQUIRED" is "TRUE", the following extensions to the rules for adjacency establishment and maintenance MUST apply:  "ISIS NEIGHBOR
before the adjacency can transition from "INIT" to "UP" state.
When the IS IS adjacency is "UP" and "ISIS
USEABLE" becomes "FALSE", the IS IS adjacency
On a Point to Point circuit whenever "ISIS NEIGHBOR USEABLE" is "FALSE", the Three Way adjacency state MUST be set to "DOWN" in the Point
to Point Three Way Adjacency TLV [RFC5303] in all transmitted IIHs.
On a LAN circuit whenever "ISIS NEIGHBOR USEABLE" is "FALSE", the IS Neighbors TLV advertising
the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the neighbor MUST be omitted in all transmitted IIHs.
Advertisement of Topology Specific IS Neighbors
The advertisement of a topology specific IS neighbor (as well as the use of the neighbor in the topology specific decision process) is determined by the value of "ISIS TOPO USEABLE" for each topology.
If "ISIS TOPO USEABLE" is "TRUE", then the topology specific neighbor is advertised.
If "ISIS TOPO USEABLE" is "FALSE", then the topology  specific neighbor is not advertised.
To allow for a non disruptive transition to the use of BFD, some amount of time should be allowed before bringing down an "UP" adjacency on a BFD enabled interface when the value of "ISIS BFD REQUIRED" becomes "TRUE" as a result of the introduction of the BFD TLV or the modification (by adding a new supported MTID/ NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH.
A simple way to do this is to not update the adjacency hold time when receiving such an IIH from a neighbor with whom we have an "UP" adjacency until "ISIS NEIGHBOR USEABLE" becomes "TRUE".
If the value of "ISIS BFD REQUIRED" becomes "FALSE" as a result of the removal the BFD TLV or the modification (by removing a supported MTID/NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH, then BFD session establishment is no longer required to maintain the adjacency or transition the adjacency to the "UP" state.
If a BFD session is administratively shut down [RFC5880] and the BFD session state change impacts the value of "ISIS NEIGHBOR USEABLE", then IS IS SHOULD allow time for the corresponding MTID/NLPID to be removed from the neighbor's BFD TLV by not updating the adjacency hold time until "ISIS BFD REQUIRED" becomes "FALSE".
Note that while this allows a non disruptive transition, it still enforces consistency between the administrative state of the BFD session and the MTID/NLPID(s) advertised in the BFD TLV.
This is necessary to provide consistent behavior regardless of whether the BFD AdminDown state is introduced before or after an IS IS adjacency "UP" state has been achieved.
This section describes IS IS implementation considerations when both IS IS graceful restart [RFC5306] and BFD are co deployed.
In cases where BFD shares fate with the control plane, it can be expected that BFD session failure may occur in conjunction with the control plane restart.
In such cases, premature abort of IS IS graceful restart as a result of BFD session failure is undesirable.
Therefore, some mechanism to ignore the BFD session failure for a limited period of time would be beneficial.
The issue of the interaction between graceful restart and BFD is described at length in RFC 5882.
The implementation of this interaction is outside the scope of this document.
The BFD enabled TLV is formatted as shown below.
The TLV SHALL only be included in an IIH and only when BFD is enabled for one or more supported MTID/protocols on the interface over which the IIH is being sent.
The NLPIDs encoded in the TLV are defined in [ISO9577].
Type   148 Length # of octets in the value field (3 to 255)
Value  3 octets specifying the MTID/NLPID for each topology/data protocol for which BFD support is enabled No. of octets
The TLV defined within this document describes an addition to the IS IS Hello protocol.
Inappropriate use of this TLV could prevent an IS IS adjacency from forming or lead to failure to detect bidirectional forwarding failures   each of which is a form of denial of service.
However, a party who can manipulate the contents of this TLV is already in a position to create such a denial of service by disrupting IS IS routing in other ways.
Note that the introduction of this TLV has no impact on the use/ non use of authentication either by IS IS or by BFD.
The following IS IS TLV type is defined by this document.
The IS IS TLV Codepoint registry has been updated accordingly.
