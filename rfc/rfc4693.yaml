  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a new document series, called the\
    \ IETF\n   Operational Notes, or IONs.\n   This document series is intended to\
    \ capture the set of procedures\n   that the IETF follows, but for which the RFC\
    \ process is an\n   inappropriate documentation vehicle.\n   The document series\
    \ defined here does not modify the IETF process\n   rules that are defined in\
    \ currently valid BCP documents.\n   The document series is a process experiment\
    \ according to RFC 3933\n   [RFC3933].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Properties of an ION
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Properties of an ION\n   An ION is a document with a certain set of attributes\
    \ (\"front page\n   matter\").  This specification does not place any limits on\
    \ what else\n   an ION can contain.\n   An ION has the following attributes:\n\
    \   o  A name, which is usable as the filename of the document\n   o  A title\n\
    \   o  A date of approval\n   o  An identification of the body that approved this\
    \ version\n   The format of the document is not restricted by this document. \
    \ It's\n   suggested that there be an ION that describes expectations for ION\n\
    \   formats.\n   An ION is a versioned document.  When a new ION is issued with\
    \ the\n   same name, it obsoletes the previous version.  When one desires to\n\
    \   retire an ION, one issues an ION saying \"This document name is now\n   obsolete\"\
    .\n   The ION name + the approval date forms a stable identifier for one\n   particular\
    \ version of an ION; once it is published, it shall never be\n   changed, although\
    \ it may be withdrawn (see below).\n   The properties list does not include a\
    \ \"category\"; while the set of\n   documents that might be IONs is extremely\
    \ wide, we do not know yet\n   which categories could make sense.  The question\
    \ of categories might\n   get revisited at the end of the experiment period.\n\
    \   Procedurally, an ION has the formal authority of a statement from its\n  \
    \ approving body.  This means that an ION cannot change those\n   procedures of\
    \ the IETF that are documented via the BCP series, since\n   the BCP series represents\
    \ a determination of IETF consensus.\n"
- title: 2.2.  ION Approval
  contents:
  - "2.2.  ION Approval\n   An ION is always approved by some body.  The IESG is granted\n\
    \   authority by this document over the practical management of the\n   series\
    \ and the definition of detailed processes and rules associated\n   with it.\n\
    \   The IESG, the IAB, and IAOC are given the right to approve IONs by\n   this\
    \ document.  The IESG, IAB, or IAOC may decide that other groups\n   or roles\
    \ should be given the right to approve IONs.\n   The ION-approving groups are\
    \ expected to issue IONs related to their\n   own areas of responsibility, and\
    \ to use common sense when IONs are\n   needed where it isn't obvious who's responsible\
    \ for them.\n   An updated ION will normally be approved by the same body that\n\
    \   approved the previous version, or by another body with the approval\n   of\
    \ the previously-approving body.  In case of conflict, or when the\n   previous\
    \ body no longer exists, the IESG will decide who gets to\n   approve an updated\
    \ ION.\n   A decision by any other body than the IESG to approve an ION can be\n\
    \   appealed to the IESG, in which case the IESG can nullify the\n   approval.\
    \  A decision of the IESG can be appealed using the common\n   IETF appeals procedure,\
    \ except that an IESG decision to nullify an\n   IAB decision to approve an ION\
    \ cannot be appealed to the IAB.\n   In the case that the IESG ceases to exist,\
    \ its successors or\n   assignees will take over the tasks given to the IESG in\
    \ this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Draft IONs
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Draft IONs\n   There is no requirement that an ION will be published as\
    \ a draft\n   before publication.  This will, however, be desirable in many cases,\n\
    \   and thus, this document describes the properties and procedures for\n   handling\
    \ draft IONs.\n   Draft IONs shall have, instead of an approval date and an\n\
    \   identification of the body that approved it, information about:\n   o  The\
    \ word \"DRAFT\", prominently displayed\n   o  The publication date and time\n\
    \   o  The approval date of the document it is intended to update (if\n      any)\n\
    \   o  The body that is intended to approve this version\n   o  The appropriate\
    \ forum for discussion of this draft (if any)\n"
- title: 2.4.  The ION Store
  contents:
  - "2.4.  The ION Store\n   All approved IONs are archived, in all their versions,\
    \ and made\n   publicly available from resources operated by the IETF secretariat.\n\
    \   The store should be reachable by common methods like HTTP and FTP,\n   and\
    \ should offer both easy access to the \"current\" version of all\n   IONs and\
    \ bulk download of all IONs, all versions.\n   This document does not constrain\
    \ the form of the ION Store, but\n   mandates that there be a public one.\n  \
    \ Public draft IONs are published separately from the approved IONs.\n   Old versions\
    \ may be published in the draft store and must be kept in\n   a version management\
    \ system for the duration of the experiment.\n   Experience will show what the\
    \ best policy for draft retention is if\n   the series is made permanent.\n"
- title: 3.  Proposed Initial IONs
  contents:
  - "3.  Proposed Initial IONs\n   The following IONs should be created as soon as\
    \ possible after this\n   document is published, to give the details of the maintenance\
    \ of the\n   ION series, in order to bootstrap the process:\n   o  The ION Format\
    \ Guide\n   o  The ION Store Description\n   The following list of documents,\
    \ some of which currently exist,\n   provides examples of documents that could\
    \ be converted to IONs.  This\n   is not a binding recommendation, but gives examples\
    \ of what IONs can\n   be good for.\n   o  The I-D publishing procedure\n   o\
    \  The checklist for I-D submission to the IESG (formerly known as\n      id-nits)\n\
    \   o  Procedures for spam control on IETF mailing lists\n   o  Procedures for\
    \ requesting a WG meeting slot\n   o  Procedures for IETF minutes\n   o  Procedures\
    \ for IESG meeting minutes\n   Once the ION series is permanent, the existence\
    \ of the ION series may\n   cause the following documents to be split into a \"\
    policy and\n   principles\" BCP and a \"procedures and boilerplate\" document\
    \ published\n   as ION:\n   o  IETF Rights in Documents (currently BCP 78) RFC\
    \ 3978 [RFC3978]\n   o  IETF Rights in Technology (currently BCP 79) RFC 3979\
    \ [RFC3979]\n   o  IETF mailing list management (currently RFC 3005 [RFC3005],\
    \ BCP\n      45, RFC 3683 [RFC3683], BCP 83, and RFC 3934 [RFC3934], BCP 94)\n\
    \   If someone wishes to do such a split while the experiment is running,\n  \
    \ the BCPs cannot refer to the \"procedures\" documents as IONs, since\n   the\
    \ concept of an ION may go away.  In that case, any procedures\n   removed from\
    \ a BCP must either be reinstated or otherwise stored as a\n   permanently available\
    \ reference.\n"
- title: 4.  Success Criteria and Sunset Period
  contents:
  - "4.  Success Criteria and Sunset Period\n   This experiment is expected to run\
    \ for a period of 12 months,\n   starting from the date of the first ION published\
    \ using this\n   mechanism.  At the end of the period, the IESG should issue a\
    \ call\n   for comments from the community, asking for people to state their\n\
    \   agreement to one of the following statements (or a suitable\n   reformulation\
    \ thereof):\n   1.  This document series has proved useful, and should be made\n\
    \       permanent\n   2.  This document series is less useful than the equivalent\n\
    \       information in RFCs and informal Web pages, and should be\n       abandoned\n\
    \   3.  We cannot decide yet; the experiment should continue\n   The author believes\
    \ that establishing objective metrics for the\n   success or failure of this experiment\
    \ is not a worthwhile exercise;\n   the success or failure will be readily apparent\
    \ in the community's\n   attitudes towards the series.\n   If the feedback reveals\
    \ a community consensus for keeping the series,\n   the IESG may choose to create\
    \ a new BCP RFC containing the\n   information herein, suitably modified by experience.\n\
    \   If the IESG decides that the feedback warrants terminating the\n   series,\
    \ the repository will be closed for new documents, and the\n   existing ION documents\
    \ will be returned to having the same status as\n   any other Web page or file\
    \ on the IETF servers -- this situation will\n   closely resemble the situation\
    \ before the experiment started.\n"
- title: 5.  Background and Motivation
  contents:
  - "5.  Background and Motivation\n   The IETF is an open organization, which means\
    \ (among other things)\n   that there are always newcomers coming in to learn\
    \ how to perform\n   work; this places a requirement on the organization to document\
    \ its\n   processes and procedures in an accessible manner.\n   The IETF is also\
    \ a large organization, which means that when\n   procedures change, there are\
    \ a number of people who will like to know\n   of the change, to figure out what\
    \ has changed, and possibly to\n   protest or appeal the change if they disagree\
    \ with it.\n   At the present time (spring 2006), there are three kinds of documents\n\
    \   used for IETF documentation of its operations and procedures:\n   o  BCP and\
    \ Informational RFCs, which require an IETF consensus call\n      for BCP, approval\
    \ by the IESG, and usually a great deal of debate\n      and effort to change,\
    \ and which bind up editing resources in the\n      final edit stage, as well\
    \ as being limited (in practice) to ASCII.\n      The BCP number forms a means\
    \ of having a stable reference for new\n      versions of a document, but an updated\
    \ Info RFC has a completely\n      different identifier from the RFC that it updates;\
    \ \"updates/\n      obsoletes\" links can give some of the same information, but\
    \ can\n      also be quite confusing to follow.\n   o  Web pages, which can be\
    \ changed without notice, provide very\n      little ability to track changes,\
    \ and have no formal standing --\n      confusion is often seen about who has\
    \ the right to update them,\n      what the process for updating them is, and\
    \ so on.  It is hard when\n      looking at a Web page to see whether this is\
    \ a current procedure,\n      a procedure introduced and abandoned, or a draft\
    \ of a future\n      procedure.  For certain procedures, their informal documentation\n\
    \      in the \"IESG Guide\" wiki has partially clarified this situation\n   \
    \   but has no official status.\n   o  \"floating\" Internet-Drafts, which are\
    \ frequently updated, in a\n      trackable manner, but have no approval mechanism,\
    \ are limited (in\n      practice) to ASCII format, and whose use as semi-permanent\n\
    \      documents clutters up their use as 6-month temporary working\n      documents.\n\
    \   This note introduces a new series that seems to fulfil the\n   requirements\
    \ for \"something in between\":\n   o  Unlike RFCs, they can be produced without\
    \ a post-editing stage,\n      they can be in any format the controllers of the\
    \ series choose\n      (allowing web pages with hyperlinks, which is an advantage\
    \ for\n      newcomers).\n   o  Also unlike RFCs, they can be produced by any\
    \ body that the IESG\n      gives the right to use the mechanism; this allows\
    \ certain\n      procedures to be updated without having to wait for the IESG\n\
    \      approval cycle.\n   o  Unlike Internet-Drafts, they have an explicit approval\
    \ step --\n      this allows a reader to easily see the difference between an\
    \ idea\n      and an operational procedure.\n   o  Unlike Web pages, there is\
    \ an explicit mechanism for finding \"all\n      current versions\", and a mechanism\
    \ for tracking the history of a\n      document.\n   The \"author\" attribute\
    \ has quite deliberately been omitted from the\n   required property list.  While\
    \ there may be many cases where\n   identifying an author is a Good Thing, the\
    \ responsibility for an\n   approved ION rests with the approving body.\n   Note:\
    \ This proposal is NOT intended to affect the standards track in\n   any way --\
    \ a side effect may be to reduce the number of \"process\n   BCPs\" emitted, but\
    \ this has no direct bearing on the IETF's technical\n   specifications.  It is\
    \ therefore not within the scope of the NEWTRK\n   working group.\n"
