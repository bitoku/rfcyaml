Abstract This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support the ARIA encryption algorithm as a block cipher.
This document specifies cipher suites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
[RFC5246] protocol to support the ARIA [
RFC5794] encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.
The cipher suites include variants using the SHA 2 family of cryptographic hash functions and ARIA Galois counter mode.
Elliptic curve cipher suites and pre shared key (PSK) cipher suites are also defined.
The cipher suites with SHA 1 are not included in this document.
Due to recent analytic work on SHA 1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away from SHA 1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.
ARIA ARIA is a general purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean cryptographers in 2003.
It is an iterated block cipher with 128 , 192 , and 256 bit keys and encrypts 128 bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16 rounds, depending on the key size.
It is secure and suitable for most software and hardware implementations on 32 bit and 8 bit processors.
It was established as a Korean standard block cipher algorithm in 2004
[ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea, especially for government to public services.
It was included in PKCS #11 in 2007
The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in [RFC5794].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The first twenty cipher suites use ARIA [RFC5794] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a SHA 2 family Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).
Eight out of twenty use elliptic curves.

; CipherSuite TLS DHE RSA WITH ARIA 256
CipherSuite TLS DH anon WITH ARIA 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH ARIA
The next twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric algorithms as those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption modes defined in TLS 1.2 with the ARIA in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].

; CipherSuite TLS DH anon WITH ARIA 128 GCM
The next fourteen cipher suites describe PSK cipher suites.
Eight cipher suites use an HMAC and six cipher suites use the ARIA Galois Counter Mode.
CipherSuite TLS PSK WITH ARIA 128
The RSA, DHE RSA, DH RSA, DHE DSS, DH DSS, DH anon, ECDH, and ECDHE key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC5246].
The ARIA 128 CBC cipher suites use ARIA [RFC5794] in CBC mode with a 128 bit key and 128 bit Initialization Vector (IV); the ARIA 256 CBC cipher suites use a 256 bit key and 128 bit IV.
encryption with additional data algorithms, AEAD AES 128 GCM, and AEAD AES 256 GCM are described in [RFC5116].
AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are described in [RFC5288].
AES and ARIA share common characteristics, including key sizes and block length.
ARIA 128 GCM and ARIA 256 GCM are defined according to those characteristics of AES.
The pseudorandom functions (PRFs) SHALL be as follows:
For cipher suites ending with  SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] using SHA 256 as the hash function.
For cipher suites ending with  SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] using SHA 384 as the hash function.
PSK Cipher Suites Pre shared key cipher suites for TLS are described in [RFC4279], [RFC4785], [RFC5487], and [RFC5489].
At the time of writing this document, no security problems have been found on ARIA (see [YWL]).
The security considerations in the following RFCs apply to this document as well:
