  - "                     STRUCTURE OF THE MAY NWG MTG.\nIn order to use our time\
    \ in Atlantic City more effectively, I would\nlike to organize the meetings around\
    \ discussions of advertised topics,\nwith published status reports and position\
    \ papers.  I envision our\ntime being divided into three phases.\nPhase one is\
    \ for status reports from each of the sites and for the\nintroductions of new\
    \ sites or agencies.  Each existing site should\nplan to report on its state of\
    \ software and hardware development, and\non its use of the network.  New sites\
    \ will introduce themselves and\npresent their plans for attachment to and use\
    \ of the network.  In\naddition, work on the ILLIAC IV, the List machine, and\
    \ the terminal\nIMP will be reviewed.  I will assume that each site needs 5-10\
    \ minutes\nunless I am notified otherwise.  A short written status report is also\n\
    explected.\nPhase two is for discussion of current network-wide topics such as\
    \ the\nNIC, the Form Machine Telnet, and Logger Protocol.  Suggestions for\nthese\
    \ topics should be made to me.  Committees should plan to prepare\nthese reports\
    \ and discuss their work.  Points of view not represented\nby existing committees\
    \ should be explicated in position papers.\nPhase three is consideration of new\
    \ topcs.  Som eof the topics I have\nin mind are what the long range goals of\
    \ the NWG should be, what\noperational goals the NWG should set for the next six\
    \ months, and\nneither the NWG should have more or less structure.  Suggestions\
    \ for\nnew topics are particularly encouraged, and these are best opened up\n\
    with an introductory position paper.\nA major factor in the effiectiveness of\
    \ this meeting will be the\nwritten material available before the meeting.  As\
    \ far as possible,\nreports and position papers should be published in RFC form\
    \ by 1 May 71.\nThe agenda will be composed from suggestions made to me; please\
    \ call\nme at (213) 825-2368.  I will publish an agenda and schedule of\nmeetings\
    \ about 1 May.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
    \ ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Josh Elliott 1/98 ]\n"
