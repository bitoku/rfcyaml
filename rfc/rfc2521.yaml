  - "1.  Introduction\n   This mechanism is intended for use with the Internet Security\n\
    \   Protocols [RFC-1825 et sequitur] for authentication and privacy.  For\n  \
    \ statically configured Security Associations, these messages indicate\n   that\
    \ the operator needs to manually reconfigure, or is attempting an\n   unauthorized\
    \ operation.  These messages may also be used to trigger\n   automated session-key\
    \ management.\n   The datagram format and basic facilities are already defined\
    \ for ICMP\n   [RFC-792].\n   Up-to-date values of the ICMP Type field are specified\
    \ in the most\n   recent \"Assigned Numbers\" [RFC-1700].  This document concerns\
    \ the\n   following values:\n       40  Security Failures\n"

    \ sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Bad SPI
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Bad SPI\n   Indicates that a received datagram includes a Security Parameters\n\
    \   Index (SPI) that is invalid or has expired.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Authentication Failed
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Authentication Failed\n   Indicates that a received datagram failed the\
    \ authenticity or\n   integrity check for a given SPI.\n   Note that the SPI may\
    \ indicate an outer Encapsulating Security\n   Protocol when a separate Authentication\
    \ Header SPI is hidden inside.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Decompression Failed
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Decompression Failed\n   Indicates that a received datagram failed a decompression\
    \ check for a\n   given SPI.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Decryption Failed
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Decryption Failed\n   Indicates that a received datagram failed a decryption\
    \ check for a\n   given SPI.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Need Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Need Authentication\n   Indicates that a received datagram will not be\
    \ accepted without\n   additional authentication.\n   In this case, either no\
    \ SPI is present, or an unsuitable SPI is\n   present.  For example, an encryption\
    \ SPI without integrity arrives\n   from a secure operating system with mutually\
    \ suspicious users.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Need Authorization
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Need Authorization\n   Indicates that a received datagram will not be accepted\
    \ because it\n   has insufficient authorization.\n   In this case, an authentication\
    \ SPI is present that is inappropriate\n   for the target transport or application.\
    \  The principle party denoted\n   by the SPI does not have proper authorization\
    \ for the facilities used\n   by the datagram.  For example, the party is authorized\
    \ for Telnet\n   access, but not for FTP access.\n"
- title: 3.  Error Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  Error Procedures\n   As is usual with ICMP messages, upon receipt of one\
    \ of these error\n   messages that is uninterpretable or otherwise contains an\
    \ error, no\n   ICMP error message is sent in response.  Instead, the message\
    \ is\n   silently discarded.  However, for diagnosis of problems, a node\n   SHOULD\
    \ provide the capability of logging the error, including the\n   contents of the\
    \ silently discarded datagram, and SHOULD record the\n   event in a statistics\
    \ counter.\n   On receipt, special care MUST be taken that the ICMP message actually\n\
    \   includes information that matches a previously sent IP datagram.\n   Otherwise,\
    \ this might provide an opportunity for a denial of service\n   attack.\n   The\
    \ sending implementation MUST be able to limit the rate at which\n   these messages\
    \ are generated.  The rate limit parameters SHOULD be\n   configurable.  How the\
    \ limits are applied (such as, by destination or\n   per interface) is left to\
    \ the implementor's discretion.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   When a prior Security Association between the parties\
    \ has not\n   expired, these messages SHOULD be sent with authentication.\n  \
    \ However, the node MUST NOT dynamically establish a new Security\n   Association\
    \ for the sole purpose of authenticating these messages.\n   Automated key management\
    \ is computationally intensive.  This could be\n   used for a very serious denial\
    \ of service attack.  It would be very\n   easy to swamp a target with bogus SPIs\
    \ from random IP Sources, and\n   have it start up numerous useless key management\
    \ sessions to\n   authentically inform the putative sender.\n   In the event of\
    \ loss of state (such as a system crash), the node will\n   need to send failure\
    \ messages to all parties that attempt subsequent\n   communication.  In this\
    \ case, the node may have lost the key\n   management technique that was used\
    \ to establish the Security\n   Association.\n   Much better to simply let the\
    \ peers know that there was a failure,\n   and let them request key management\
    \ as needed (at their staggered\n   timeouts).  They'll remember the previous\
    \ key management technique,\n   and restart gracefully.  This distributes the\
    \ restart burden among\n   systems, and helps allow the recently failed node to\
    \ manage its\n   computational resources.\n   In addition, these messages inform\
    \ the recipient when the ICMP sender\n   is under attack.  Unlike other ICMP error\
    \ messages, the messages\n   provide sufficient data to determine that these messages\
    \ are in\n   response to previously sent messages.\n   Therefore, it is imperative\
    \ that the recipient accept both\n   authenticated and unauthenticated failure\
    \ messages.  The recipient's\n   log SHOULD indicate when the ICMP messages are\
    \ not validated, and\n   when the ICMP messages are not in response to a valid\
    \ previous\n   message.\n   There is some concern that sending these messages\
    \ may result in the\n   leak of security information.  For example, an attacker\
    \ might use\n   these messages to test or verify potential forged keys.  However,\n\
    \   this information is already available through the simple expedient of\n  \
    \ using Echo facilities, or waiting for a TCP 3-way handshake.\n   The rate limiting\
    \ mechanism also limits this form of leak, as many\n   messages will not result\
    \ in an error indication.  At the very least,\n   this will lengthen the time\
    \ factor for verifying such information.\n"
