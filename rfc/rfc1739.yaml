- title: 2. A Beginner's Guide to TCP/IP-based Utilities and Applications
  contents:
  - "2. A Beginner's Guide to TCP/IP-based Utilities and Applications\n   This section\
    \ provides descriptions and detailed examples of several\n   TCP/IP utilities\
    \ and applications, including actual sessions using\n   these utilities (with\
    \ some extraneous information removed).  Each\n   section below describes a single\
    \ TCP/IP-based tool, it's application,\n   and, in some cases, how it works. \
    \ The text description is followed\n   by an actual sample session.\n   The sample\
    \ dialogues shown below were made using the Multinet TCP/IP\n   software for VAX/VMS\
    \ or DOS versions of FTP Software's PC/TCP.  While\n   the examples below can\
    \ be used as a guide to using and learning about\n   the capabilities of these\
    \ tools, the reader should understand that\n   not all of these utilities may\
    \ be found at all TCP/IP hosts nor in\n   all commercial software packages.  Furthermore,\
    \ the user interface\n   for different packages will be different and the actual\
    \ command line\n   may appear differently than shown here; this will be particularly\n\
    \   true for graphical user interfaces running over Windows, X-Windows,\n   OS/2,\
    \ or Macintosh systems.  The Internet has many exciting things to\n   offer but\
    \ standardized interfaces to the protocols is not yet one of\n   them!  This guide\
    \ will not provide any detail or motivation about the\n   Internet Protocol Suite;\
    \ more information about the TCP/IP protocols\n   and related issues may be found\
    \ in RFC 1180 [18], Comer [22], Feit\n   [23], and Kessler [30].\n   In the commands\
    \ shown in the descriptions below, any item appearing\n   in square brackets ([])\
    \ is optional and the vertical-bar (|) means\n   \"or\"; parameters appearing\
    \ with no brackets or within curly brackets\n   ({}) are mandatory.  In the sample\
    \ dialogues, most user input is in\n   capital letters (only where allowed) and\
    \ lines containing user input\n   are designated with a \"**\" in the far-left\
    \ margin.\n   AUTHOR'S NOTE: The sample dialogues are easier to read in the\n\
    \   secondary, Postscript version of this RFC.\n"
- title: 2.1. NSLOOKUP
  contents:
  - "2.1. NSLOOKUP\n   NSLOOKUP is the name server lookup program that comes with\
    \ many\n   TCP/IP software packages.  A user can use NSLOOKUP to examine entries\n\
    \   in the Domain Name System (DNS) database that pertain to a particular\n  \
    \ host or domain; one common use is to determine a host system's IP\n   address\
    \ from its name or the host's name from its IP address.  The\n   general form\
    \ of the command to make a single query is:\n        NSLOOKUP  [IP_address | host_name]\n\
    \   If the program is started without any parameters, the user will be\n   prompted\
    \ for input; the user can enter either an IP address or host\n   name at that\
    \ time, and the program will respond with the name and\n   address of the default\
    \ name sever, the name server actually used to\n   resolve each request, and the\
    \ IP address and host name that was\n   queried.  \"Exit\" is used to quit the\
    \ NSLOOKUP application.\n   Three simple queries are shown in the example below:\n\
    \  1. Requests the address of the host named \"emily.uvm.edu\", a system at\n\
    \     the University of Vermont (UVM).  As it turns out, this is not the\n   \
    \  true name of the host, but a shortened version of the name that is\n     accepted\
    \ as an alias by the network.  The full name of the host and\n     the IP address\
    \ are listed by NSLOOKUP.\n  2. Requests the address of host \"emily.emba.uvm.edu\"\
    , which is the\n     same host as in the first query.  Note that NSLOOKUP provides\
    \ a\n     \"non-authoritative\" answer.  Since NSLOOKUP just queried this same\n\
    \     address, the information is still in its cache memory.  Rather than\n  \
    \   send additional messages to the name server, the answer is one that\n    \
    \ it remembers from before; the server didn't look up the information\n     again,\
    \ however, so it is not guaranteed to still be accurate\n     (because the information\
    \ might have changed within the last few\n     milliseconds!).\n  3. Requests\
    \ the name of the host with the given IP address.  The\n     result points to\
    \ the Internet gateway to Australia,\n     \"munnari.oz.au\".\n   One additional\
    \ query is shown in the dialogue below.  NSLOOKUP\n   examines information that\
    \ is stored by the DNS.  The default NSLOOKUP\n   queries examine basic address\
    \ records (called \"A records\") to\n   reconcile the host name and IP address,\
    \ although other information is\n   also available.  In the final query below,\
    \ for example, the user\n   wants to know where electronic mail addressed to the\
    \ \"uvm.edu\" domain\n   actually gets delivered, since \"uvm.edu\" is not the\
    \ name of an actual\n   host.  This is accomplished by changing the query type\
    \ to look for\n   mail exchange (MX) records by issuing a \"set type\" command\
    \ (which\n   must be in lower case).  The query shows that mail addressed to\n\
    \   \"uvm.edu\" is handled though a mail server called \"moose.uvm.edu\". The\n\
    \   DNS is beyond the scope of this introduction, although more\n   information\
    \ about the concepts and structure of the DNS can be found\n   in STD 13/RFC 1034\
    \ [12] and RFC 1591 [13].  The \"help\" command can be\n   issued at the program\
    \ prompt for information about NSLOOKUP's more\n   advanced commands.\n   TECHNICAL\
    \ NOTE: There are other tools that might be available on your\n   system or with\
    \ your software for examining the DNS.  Alternatives to\n   NSLOOKUP include HOST\
    \ and DIG.\n      ==================================================================\n\

- title: 2.2. PING
  contents:
  - "2.2. PING\n   Ping is one of the most widely available tools bundled with TCP/IP\n\
    \   software packages.  Ping uses a series of Internet Control Message\n   Protocol\
    \ (ICMP) Echo messages to determine if a remote host is active\n   or inactive,\
    \ and to determine the round-trip delay in communicating\n   with it.  The Ping\
    \ command, referred to as the Packet Internetwork\n   Groper in some references,\
    \ has the following general format:\n        PING [-s] {IP_address | host_name}\

    \ contains no optional parameters.\n   In the second test, the \"-s\" parameter\
    \ tells the system to send an\n   ICMP Echo message every second.  The optional\
    \ \"size\" parameter\n   specifies that each message should be 64 bytes in length\
    \ (which is\n   the default size); the optional \"quantity\" parameter indicates\
    \ that\n   this test will only send 12 messages (the default is to run the test\n\
    \   continuously until interrupted).  The results of the second test\n   displays\

- title: 2.4. TRACEROUTE
  contents:
  - "2.4. TRACEROUTE\n   Traceroute is another common TCP/IP tool, this one allowing\
    \ users to\n   learn about the route that packets take from their local host to\
    \ a\n   remote host.  Although used often by network and system managers as a\n\
    \   simple, yet powerful, debugging aid, traceroute can be used by end\n   users\
    \ to learn something about the structure of the Internet.\n   The Traceroute command\
    \ has the following general format (where \"#\"\n   represents a positive integer\
    \ value associated with the qualifier):\n      TRACEROUTE [-m #] [-q #] [-w #]\
    \ [-p #] {IP_address | host_name}\n   where  -m   is the maximum allowable TTL\
    \ value, measured as the\n                number of hops allowed before the program\
    \ terminates\n               (default = 30)\n          -q   is the number of UDP\
    \ packets that will be sent with each\n               time-to-live setting (default\
    \ = 3)\n          -w   is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for an answer\n\
    \               from a particular router before giving up (default = 5)\n    \
    \      -p   is the invalid port address at the remote host (default =\n      \
    \         33434)\n   The Traceroute example below shows the route between a host\
    \ at St.\n   Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont (smcvax.smcvt.edu) and a\n\
    \   host at Bellcore in Red Bank, New Jersey (thumper.bellcore.com).  The\n  \
    \ output has some interesting points:\n   1. NEARnet, the New England Academic\
    \ and Research Network, is a\n      regional network serving the northeastern\
    \ U.S.  The packets' route\n      runs from St. Mike's NEARnet gateway (smc-gw)\
    \ to the University of\n      Vermont (uvm-gw), etc.  Note that some intermediate\
    \ systems (see\n      lines 4 and 16) do not have names associated with them.\n\
    \   2. From NEARnet (lines 1-6), the packets travel on the National\n      Science\
    \ Foundation Network (NSFNET) T3 backbone (lines 7-11).  The\n      NSFNET backbone\
    \ nodes are identified as \"ans.net\" since the NSFNET\n      is operated by Advanced\
    \ Networks and Services, Inc. (ANS).  The\n      packets travel within ANS' network\
    \ on their core nodal switching\n      subsystems (\"cnss\") until ready to jump\
    \ off the backbone; line 11\n      indicates an ANS exterior nodal switching subsystem\
    \ (\"enss\").  The\n      datagrams are then carried on the JvNCnet (lines 12-16),\
    \ a regional\n      network in New Jersey (note the use of SMDS!).  Finally, the\n\
    \      datagrams are placed on Bellcore's internal network (lines 17 and\n   \
    \   18) for final delivery.\n   3. Note that not all of the datagrams take the\
    \ same route.  In\n      particular, only two of the datagrams go through the\
    \ ANS gateway\n      referred to at line 10.  Note also line 17; here, the first\
    \ two\n      datagrams go through one router at Bellcore, while the third\n  \
    \    datagram goes through a companion router.\n   TECHNICAL NOTE: Traceroute\
    \ works by sending a sequence of User\n   Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams to\
    \ an invalid port address at the\n   remote host.  Using the default settings,\
    \ three datagrams are sent,\n   each with a Time-To-Live (TTL) field value set\
    \ to one.  The TTL value\n   of 1 causes the datagram to \"timeout\" as soon as\
    \ it hits the first\n   router in the path; this router will then respond with\
    \ an ICMP Time\n   Exceeded Message (TEM) indicating that the datagram has expired.\n\
    \   Another three UDP messages are now sent, each with the TTL value set\n   to\
    \ 2, which causes the second router to return ICMP TEMs.  This\n   process continues\
    \ until the packets actually reach the other\n   destination.  Since these datagrams\
    \ are trying to access an invalid\n   port at the destination host, ICMP Destination\
    \ Unreachable Messages\n   are returned indicating an unreachable port; this event\
    \ signals the\n   Traceroute program that it is finished!  The Traceroute program\n\
    \   displays the round-trip delay associated with each of the attempts.\n   As\
    \ an interesting aside, Traceroute did not begin life as a general-\n   purpose\
    \ utility, but as a quick-and-dirty debugging aid used to find\n   a routing problem.\
    \  The code (complete with comments!) is available\n   by anonymous FTP in the\
    \ file \"traceroute.tar.Z\" from the host\n   \"ftp.ee.lbl.gov\".  (See Section\
    \ 2.5 for a discussion of anonymous\n   FTP.)\n   ==================================================================\n"

  - "2.5. FTP\n   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [16] is one of the most useful\
    \ and\n   powerful TCP/IP utilities for the general user.  FTP allows users to\n\
    \   upload and download files between local and remote hosts.  Anonymous\n   FTP,\
    \ in particular, is commonly available at file archive sites to\n   allow users\
    \ to access files without having to pre-establish an\n   account at the remote\
    \ host.  The general form of the FTP command is:\n        FTP [IP_address | host_name]\n\
    \   As shown, FTP can be initiated in several ways.  In the example shown\n  \
    \ below, an FTP control connection is initiated to a host by supplying\n   a host\
    \ name with the FTP command; optionally, the host's IP address\n   in dotted decimal\
    \ form could be used.  If neither host name nor IP\n   address are supplied in\
    \ the command line, a connection to a host can\n   be initiated by typing \"OPEN\
    \ host_name\" or \"OPEN IP_address\" once the\n   FTP application has been started.\n\
    \   The remote host will now ask for a username and password.  If a\n   legitimate,\
    \ registered user of this host supplies a valid username\n   and password, then\
    \ the user will have access to any files and\n   directories to which this username\
    \ has privilege.  For anonymous FTP\n   access, the username \"anonymous\" is\
    \ used and the password (not shown\n   in actual use) is \"guest\" (although an\
    \ increasing number of systems\n   ask that anonymous FTP users supply their Internet\
    \ address as the\n   password).\n   The first command issued in the example below\
    \ is \"help ?\", used to\n   obtain a list of available FTP commands and help\
    \ topics.  Although\n   not always shown, nearly all TCP/IP applications have\
    \ a help command.\n   An example of the help for FTP's \"type\" command is shown\
    \ in the\n   sample dialogue.  This command is very important one, by the way;\
    \ if\n   transferring a binary or executable file, be sure to set the type to\n\
    \   \"image\" (or \"binary\" on some systems).\n   The \"dir\" command provides\
    \ a directory listing of the files in the\n   current directory at the remote\
    \ host; the UNIX \"ls\" command may also\n   usually be used.  Note that an FTP\
    \ data transfer connection is\n   established for the transfer of the directory\
    \ information to the\n   local host.  The output from the \"dir\" command will\
    \ show a file\n   listing that is consistent with the native operating system\
    \ of the\n   remote host.  Although the TCP/IP suite is often associated with\n\
    \   UNIX, it can (and does) run with nearly all common operating systems.\n  \
    \ The directory information shown in the sample dialogue happens to be\n   in\
    \ UNIX format and includes the following information:\n   o File attributes. \
    \ The first character identifies this as a\n     directory (d), link (l), or individual\
    \ file (-).  The next nine\n     characters list the access permissions for three\
    \ groups, namely,\n     the owner, the owner's group, and all other users.  Three\
    \ access\n     privileges may be assigned to each file for each of these groups:\n\
    \     read (r), write (w), execute (x), and/or search (s).\n   o File owner and\
    \ owner's group.\n   o File size, in bytes.\n   o Date of last modification. \
    \ If the date is followed by a timestamp,\n     then the date is from the current\
    \ year.\n   o File name.\n   After the directory information has been transferred,\
    \ FTP closes the\n   data transfer connection.\n   The command \"cd\" is used\
    \ to change to another directory, in this case\n   the \"Gov\" directory (note\
    \ that file and directory names may be case-\n   sensitive).  As in DOS, \"cd\
    \ ..\" will change to the parent of the\n   current directory.  The \"CWD command\
    \ successful\" is the only\n   indication that the user's \"cd\" command was correctly\
    \ executed; the\n   \"show-directory\" (may be truncated to fewer characters,\
    \ as shown)\n   command, if available, may be used to see which directory you\
    \ are in.\n   Another \"dir\" command is used to find all files ending with the\n\
    \   characters \".act\"; note the use of the \"*\" wildcard character.  We\n \
    \  can now copy (download) the file of choice (The Fair Credit Reporting\n   Act,\
    \ 1992) by using the \"get\" (or \"receive\") command, which has the\n   following\
    \ general format:\n      GET  remote_file_name  local_file_name\n   FTP opens\
    \ another data transfer connection for this file transfer\n   purpose; note that\
    \ the effective data transfer rate is 39.98 kbps.\n   FTP's \"put\" (or \"send\"\
    ) command allows uploading from the local host\n   to the remote.  \"Put\" is\
    \ often not available when using anonymous\n   FTP.\n   Finally, we terminate\
    \ the FTP connection by using the \"close\"\n   command.  The user can initiate\
    \ another FTP connection using the\n   \"open\" command or can leave FTP by issuing\
    \ a \"quit\" command.  \"Quit\"\n   can also be used to close a connection and\
    \ terminate a session.\n   TECHNICAL NOTE: It is important to note that different\
    \ FTP packages\n   have different commands available and even those with similar\
    \ names\n   may act differently.  In the example shown here (using MultiNet for\n\
    \   VMS), the \"show\" command will display the current directory; in\n   another\
    \ package (e.g., FTP Software's PC/TCP), \"show\" will display a\n   file from\
    \ the remote host at the local host.  Some packages have\n   nothing equivalent\
    \ to either of these commands!\n      ==================================================================\n\

- title: 2.6. TELNET

  - "2.6. TELNET\n   TELNET [17] is TCP/IP's virtual terminal protocol.  Using TELNET,\
    \ a\n   user connected to one host can login to another host, appearing like\n\
    \   a directly-attached terminal at the remote system; this is TCP/IP's\n   definition\
    \ of a \"virtual terminal.\"  The general form of the TELNET\n   command is:\n\
    \        TELNET  [IP_address | host_name]  [port]\n   As shown, a TELNET connection\
    \ is initiated when the user enters the\n   \"TELNET\" command and supplies either\
    \ a \"host_name\" or \"IP_address\";\n   if neither are given, TELNET will ask\
    \ for one once the application\n   begins.\n   In the example below, a user logged\
    \ onto a PC on a LAN will use\n   TELNET to attach to the remote host \"smcvax.smcvt.edu\"\
    .   Once logged\n   in via TELNET, the user can do anything on the remote host\
    \ that they\n   could do if they were on a directly-connected terminal or had\
    \ dialed-\n   up by modem.  The commands that are used are those available on\
    \ the\n   remote system to which the user is attached.  In the sample dialogue\n\
    \   below, the user attached to SMCVAX will use basic VAX/VMS commands:\n   o\
    \  The \"dir\" command lists the files having a \"COM\" file extension.\n   o\
    \  The \"mail\" command enters the MAIL system (there are no messages).\n   o\
    \  \"Pinging\" the home host shows that it is alive!\n   When finished, \"logout\"\
    \ logs the user off the remote host; TELNET\n   automatically closes the connection\
    \ to the remote host and returns\n   control to the local system.\n   It is important\
    \ to note that TELNET is a very powerful tool, one that\n   may provide users\
    \ with access to many Internet utilities and services\n   that might not be otherwise\
    \ available.  Many of these features are\n   accessed by specifying a port number\
    \ with the TELNET command, in\n   addition to a host's address, and knowledge\
    \ of port numbers provides\n   another mechanism for users to access information\
    \ with Telnet.\n   This guide discusses several TCP/IP and Internet utilities\
    \ that\n   require local client software, such as Finger, Whois, Archie, and\n\
    \   Gopher.  But what if your software does not include a needed client?\n   In\
    \ some cases, Telnet may be used to access a remote client and\n   provide the\
    \ same functionality.\n   This is done by specifying a port number with the TELNET\
    \ command.\n   Just as TCP/IP hosts have a unique IP address, applications on\
    \ the\n   host are associated with an address, called a \"port\".  Finger, for\n\
    \   example, is associated with the well-known port number 79.  In the\n   absence\
    \ of a Finger client, TELNETing to port 79 at a remote host may\n   provide the\
    \ same information.  You can \"finger\" another host with\n   TELNET by using\
    \ a command like:\n                              TELNET host_name 79\n   Other\
    \ well-known TCP/IP port numbers include 20 (FTP data transfer),\n   21 (FTP control),\
    \ 25 (SMTP), 43 (whois), 70 (Gopher), and 185\n   (KNOWBOT).\n   Some services\
    \ are available on the Internet using TELNET and special\n   port numbers.  A\
    \ geographical information database, for example, may\n   be accessed by TELNETing\
    \ to port 3000 at host\n   \"martini.eecs.umich.edu\"; current weather information\
    \ is available at\n   port 3000 at hosts \"downwind.sprl.umich.edu\" and\n   \"\
    wind.atmos.uah.edu\".\n   ==================================================================\n"

  contents:
  - "2.7.1. WHOIS/NICNAME\n   WHOIS and NICNAME are TCP/IP applications that search\
    \ databases to\n   find the name of network and system administrators, RFC authors,\n\
    \   system and network points-of-contact, and other individuals who are\n   registered\
    \ in appropriate databases.  The original NICNAME/WHOIS\n   protocol is described\
    \ in RFC 954 [4].\n   WHOIS may be accessed by TELNETing to an appropriate WHOIS\
    \ server and\n   logging in as \"WHOIS\" (no password is required); the most common\n\
    \   Internet name server is located at the Internet Network Information\n   Center\
    \ (InterNIC) at \"rs.internic.net\".  This specific database, in\n   particular,\
    \ only contains INTERNET domains, IP network numbers, and\n   points of contact;\
    \ policies governing the InterNIC database are\n   described in RFC 1400 [19].\
    \  The MILNET database resides at\n   \"nic.ddn.mil\" and PSI's White Pages pilot\
    \ service is located at\n   \"psi.com\".\n   Many software packages contain a\
    \ WHOIS/NICNAME client that\n   automatically establishes the TELNET connection\
    \ to a default name\n   server database, although users can usually specify any\
    \ name server\n   database that they want.\n   The accompanying dialogues shows\
    \ several types of WHOIS/NICNAME\n   information queries.  In the session below,\
    \ we request information\n   about an individual (Denis Stratford) by using WHOIS\
    \ locally, a\n   specific domain (hill.com) by using NICNAME locally, and a high-level\n\
    \   domain (edu) using TELNET to a WHOIS server.\n      ==================================================================\n\

    \ to find any user on any host without relying on databases.\n   For NETFIND to\
    \ be successful, however, the system manager of existing\n   systems must set\

  contents:
  - "2.8.1. ARCHIE\n   Archie is a tool for locating files on the Internet, originally\n\
    \   developed at the Computer Science Department at McGill University in\n   Montreal.\
    \  Archie allows users to find software, data, and other\n   information files\
    \ that reside at anonymous FTP archive sites across\n   the Internet; the name\
    \ of the program, reportedly, is derived from\n   the word \"archive\" and not\
    \ from the comic book character.  Archie\n   tracks the contents of over 1,000\
    \ anonymous FTP archive sites\n   containing over 2 million files.  The Archie\
    \ server automatically\n   updates the information from each registered site about\
    \ once a month,\n   providing relatively up-to-date information without unduly\
    \ stressing\n   the network.\n   Before using Archie, you must identify a server\
    \ address.  The sites\n   below all support Archie; most (but not all) Archie\
    \ sites support the\n   \"servers\" command which lists all known Archie servers.\
    \  Due to the\n   popularity of Archie and its high processing demands, many sites\n\
    \   limit access to non-peak hours and/or limit the number of\n   simultaneous\
    \ Archie users.  Available Archie sites include:\n      archie.au            \

    \ may be accessed using TELNET.  When TELNETing to an\n   Archie site, login as\
    \ \"archie\" (you MUST use lower case); just hit\n   <ENTER> if a password is\
    \ requested.\n   Once connected, the \"help\" command assists users in obtaining\
    \ more\n   information about using Archie.  Two more useful Archie commands are\n\
    \   \"prog\", used to search for files in the database, and \"whatis\", which\n\
    \   searches for keywords in the program descriptions.\n   In the accompanying\
    \ dialogue, the \"set maxhits\" command is used to\n   limit the number of responses\
    \ to any following \"prog\" commands; if\n   this is not done, the user may get\
    \ an enormous amount of information!\n   In this example, the user issues a request\
    \ to find entries related to\n   \"mpeg\", ISO's Moving Pictures Experts Group\
    \ video compression\n   standard.  Armed with this information, a user can use\
    \ anonymous FTP\n   to examine these directories and files.\n   The next request\
    \ is for files with \"security\" as a keyword\n   descriptor.  These responses\
    \ can be used for subsequent \"prog\"\n   commands.\n   Exit archie using the\
    \ \"exit\" command.  At this point, TELNET closes\n   the connection and control\
    \ returns to the local host.\n   Additional information about Archie can be obtained\

- title: 2.8.2. GOPHER
  contents:
  - "2.8.2. GOPHER\n   The Internet Gopher protocol was developed at the University\
    \ of\n   Minnesota's Microcomputer Center in 1991, as a distributed\n   information\
    \ search and retrieval tool for the Internet.  Gopher is\n   described in RFC\
    \ 1436 [1]; the name derives from the University's\n   mascot.\n   Gopher provides\
    \ a tool so that publicly available information at a\n   host can be organized\
    \ in a hierarchical fashion, allowing it to be\n   perused using a simple menu\
    \ system.  Gopher allows a user to view a\n   file on demand without requiring\
    \ additional file transfer protocols.\n   Gopher also has the capability to \"\
    link\" gophers on the Internet, so\n   that each Gopher site can be used as a\
    \ stepping stone to access other\n   sites and reducing the amount of duplicate\
    \ information and effort on\n   the network.\n   In many cases, users can access\
    \ Gopher by TELNETing to a valid Gopher\n   location; if the site provides a remote\
    \ Gopher client, the user will\n   see a text-based, menu interface.  The number\
    \ of Gopher sites is\n   growing rapidly; as the dialogue below shows, most Gopher\
    \ sites have\n   a menu item that will allow you to identify other Gopher sites.\
    \  If\n   using TELNET, login with the username \"gopher\" (this MUST be in\n\
    \   lowercase); no password is required.  Note that not all Gopher sites\n   provide\
    \ a remote Gopher client; users may need local Gopher client\n   software on their\
    \ system.\n   The Gopher server at \"ds.internic.net\" has a tremendous amount\
    \ of\n   information for the new user, including lists of frequently asked\n \
    \  questions and pointers to various Internet discussion lists.  In the\n   sample\
    \ dialogue below, the remote Gopher client is accessed by\n   TELNETing to the\
    \ host.  With the menu interface shown here, the user\n   merely follows the prompts.\
    \  Initially, the main menu will appear;\n   selecting item 2 causes Gopher to\
    \ seize and display the \"InterNIC\n   Information Services\" menu.  Move to the\
    \ desired menu item by typing\n   the item number or by moving the \"pointer\"\
    \ (-->) down to the desired\n   entry using the <DOWN-ARROW> key on the keyboard,\
    \ and then hitting\n   <ENTER>.  To quit the program at any time, press \"q\"\
    \ (quit); \"?\" and\n   \"u\" will provide help or go back up to the previous\
    \ menu,\n   respectively.  Users may also search for strings within files using\n\
    \   the \"/\" command or download the file being interrogated using the \"D\"\n\
    \   command.\n   Menu item 7 (selected in the dialogue shown here) is titled\n\
    \   \"Beginners: Start Here\", an excellent place for new users to obtain\n  \
    \ information about the Internet, available tools, terms and concepts,\n   and,\
    \ perhaps most importantly, some of the cultural aspects of the\n   Internet community.\n\
    \   Further information about Gopher can be obtained by contacting the\n   Internet\
    \ Gopher Team at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis\n   (gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu).\
    \  This is also the site of the first\n   Gopher server (consultant.micro.umn.edu).\
    \  A Gopher-related\n   discussion list is maintained at gopher-news@boombox.micro.umn.edu\n\
    \   (see Section 3.1 for information on subscribing to Internet\n   discussion\
    \ lists).  More information on Gopher clients can be found\n   in the Gopher Frequently\
    \ Asked Questions (FAQ) file, which can be\n   downloaded using anonymous FTP\
    \ in file\n   \"/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq\" at the host \"rtfm.mit.edu\"\
    ;\n   this FAQ also lists sources for a number of Gopher clients for a wide\n\

- title: 2.8.3. Other Information Servers
  contents:
  - "2.8.3. Other Information Servers\n   There are a number of other information\
    \ servers that are growing in\n   popularity and use.  The problem with being\
    \ blessed with so much\n   information from Archie, Gopher, and other sources\
    \ is exactly that -\n   too much information.  To make it easier for users to\
    \ locate the\n   system on which their desired information resides, a number of\
    \ other\n   tools have been created.\n   Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide\
    \ Index to Computerized\n   Archives) was developed at the University of Nevada\
    \ in Reno as an\n   adjunct to Gopher.  As the number of Gopher sites continues\
    \ to grow,\n   it has become increasingly harder to find information in\n   \"\
    Gopherspace\" since Gopher is designed to search a single database at\n   a time.\
    \  Veronica maintains an index of titles of Gopher items and\n   performs a keyword\
    \ search on all of the Gopher sites that it has\n   knowledge of and access to,\
    \ obviating the need for the user to\n   perform a menu-by-menu, site-by-site\
    \ search for information.  When a\n   user selects an item from the menu of a\
    \ Veronica search, \"sessions\"\n   are automatically established with the appropriate\
    \ Gopher servers,\n   and a list of data items is returned to the originating\
    \ Gopher client\n   in the form of a Gopher menu so that the user can access the\
    \ files.\n   Veronica is available as an option on many Gopher servers, including\n\
    \   \"internic.net\".\n   Another Gopher-adjunct is Jughead (Jonzy's Universal\
    \ Gopher Hierarchy\n   Excavation And Display).  Jughead supports key word searches\
    \ and the\n   use of logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT).  The result of a Jughead\n\
    \   search is a display of all menu items which match the search string\n   which\
    \ are located in the University of Manchester and UMIST\n   Information Server,\
    \ working from a static database that is re-created\n   every day.  Jughead is\
    \ available from many Gopher sites (including\n   \"internic.net\"), although\
    \ Veronica may be a better tool for global\n   searches.\n   Archie and Gopher\
    \ are primarily used for the indexing of text-based\n   files.  The World Wide\
    \ Web (WWW or W3) Project, initiated by the CERN\n   Institute for Particle Physics\
    \ in Geneva, Switzerland, is designed to\n   combine aspects of information retrieval\
    \ with multimedia\n   communications.  The WWW Project is intended to allow users\
    \ to access\n   information in many different types of formats, including text,\n\
    \   sound, image, and video.  WWW treats all searchable Internet files as\n  \
    \ hypertext documents.  \"Hypertext\" is a new term which merely refers\n   to\
    \ text that contains pointers to other text, allowing a user reading\n   one document\
    \ to jump to another document for more information on a\n   given topic, and then\
    \ return to the same location in the original\n   document.  The original WWW\
    \ site is at CERN and may be accessed via\n   Telnet at \"nxoc01.cern.ch\".  The\
    \ user will be automatically logged in\n   and a help menu can be displayed by\
    \ entering the \"h\" command.\n   To generally access WWW servers, users must\
    \ run client software\n   called a \"browser\".  The browser reads documents from\
    \ WWW servers and\n   can access files by FTP, gopher, and other methods.  WWW\
    \ can also\n   handle hypermedia documents; \"hypermedia\" is another new term,\n\
    \   referring to a file using any medium that contains pointers to\n   another\
    \ medium.  WWW browsers, then, are able to display images,\n   sound, or animations\
    \ in addition to text.  WWW sources and additional\n   information may be accessed\
    \ via anonymous FTP from the \"/pub/WWW\"\n   directory at \"info.cern.ch\" or\
    \ the \"/Web\" directory at\n   \"ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\".\n   The most commonly used\
    \ WWW browser is Mosaic, developed at the\n   National Center for Supercomputer\
    \ Applications (NCSA) at the\n   University of Illinois.  Mosaic provides a uniform\
    \ mechanism for\n   finding the location of information, as well as determining\
    \ the data\n   type, presentation method, and linkages to other information. \
    \ A\n   large number of shareware Mosaic clients are available at\n   \"ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\"\
    .  It should be noted that commercial versions of\n   Mosaic will also become\
    \ available for a variety of platforms after\n   the summer of 1994.\n   The Wide\
    \ Area Information Server (WAIS, pronounced \"ways\") was\n   initiated jointly\
    \ by Apple Computer, Dow Jones, KMPG Peat Marwick,\n   and Thinking Machines Corp.\
    \  It is a set of free-ware, share-ware,\n   and commercial software products\
    \ for a wide variety of\n   hardware/software platforms, which work together to\
    \ help users find\n   information on the Internet.  WAIS provides a single interface\n\
    \   through which a user can access many different information databases.\n  \
    \ The user interface allow a query to be formulated in English and the\n   WAIS\
    \ server will automatically choose the appropriate databases to\n   search.  Further\
    \ information about WAIS can be obtained by reading\n   the WAIS FAQ, from host\
    \ \"rtfm.mit.edu\" in file\n   \"/pub/usenet/news.answers/wais-faq\".\n"
- title: 2.9.  Uniform Resource Locator Format
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Uniform Resource Locator Format\n   As more and more protocols have become\
    \ available to identify files,\n   archive and server sites, news lists, and other\
    \ information resources\n   on the Internet, it was inevitable that some shorthand\
    \ would arise to\n   make it a little easier to designate these sources.  The\
    \ common\n   shorthand that is employed is called the Uniform Resource Locator\n\
    \   (URL) format.\n   The list below provides information on how the URL format\
    \ should be\n   interpreted for the protocols and resources that have been discussed\n\
    \   in this document.  A complete description of the URL format may be\n   found\
    \ in [2].\n   file://\"host\"/\"directory\"/\"file-name\"\n     Used to identify\
    \ a specific file.  E.g., the file \"htmlasst\" in the\n     \"edu\" directory\
    \ at host \"ftp.cs.da\" would be denoted with URL as:\n     <URL:file://ftp.cs.da/edu/htmlasst>\n\
    \   ftp://\"user\":\"password\"@\"host\":\"port\"/\"directory\"/\"file-name\"\n\
    \     Used to identify an FTP site.  E.g.:\n     <URL:ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/*>\n\
    \   gopher://\"host\":\"port\"/\"gopher-path\"\n     Used to identify a Gopher\

    \   http://\"host\":\"port\"/\"directory\"/\"file-name\"?\"searchpart\"\n    \
    \ Used to identify a WWW server location.  \"http\" refers to the\n     HyperText\
    \ Transport Protocol; file names commonly use the \".html\"\n     extension, indicating\
    \ use of the HyperText Markup Language.  E.g.:\n     <URL:http://info.isoc.org/home.html>\n\
    \   mailto:\"e-mail address\"\n     Identifies an individual Internet mail address.\
    \  E.g.:\n     <URL:mailto:sds@hill.com>\n   telnet://\"user\":\"password\"@\"\
    host\":\"port\"/\n     Identifies a TELNET site (the trailing \"/\" is optional).\

- title: 3. Discussion Lists
  contents:
  - "3. Discussion Lists\n   Among the most useful features of the Internet are the\
    \ discussion\n   lists that have become available to allow individuals to discuss\n\
    \   topics of mutual concern.  Discussion list topics range from SCUBA\n   diving\
    \ and home brewing of beer to AIDS research and foreign policy.\n   Several, naturally,\
    \ deal specifically with the Internet, TCP/IP\n   protocols, and the impact of\
    \ new technologies.\n   Most of the discussion lists accessible from the Internet\
    \ are\n   \"unmoderated\", meaning that anyone can send a message to the list's\n\
    \   central repository and the message will then be automatically\n   forwarded\
    \ to all subscribers of the list.  These lists provide very\n   fast turn-around\
    \ between submission of a message and delivery, but\n   often result in a lot\
    \ of messages (including inappropriate \"junk\n   mail\").  A \"moderated\" list\
    \ has an extra step; a human list moderator\n   examines all messages before they\
    \ are forwarded to ensure that the\n   messages are appropriate to the list and\
    \ not needlessly inflammatory!\n   Users should be warned that some lists generate\
    \ a significant amount\n   of messages each day.  Before subscribing to too many\
    \ lists, be sure\n   that you are aware of local policies and/or charges governing\
    \ access\n   to discussion lists and e-mail storage.\n"

    \ Information\n   Services\" | \"Using the Internet\" | \"Basic Internet Services\"\
    \ |\n   \"Electronic Mail\" | \"Mailing Lists\" to find the 8-part list of lists.\n\
    \   Be careful if you download these files; the list is nearly 1.5 MB in\n   size,\

- title: 3.2. Usenet
  contents:
  - "3.2. Usenet\n   Usenet, also known as NETNEWS or Usenet news, is another information\n\
    \   source with its own set of special interest mailing lists organized\n   into\
    \ \"newsgroups\".  Usenet originated on UNIX systems but has\n   migrated to many\
    \ other types of hosts, although most Usenet servers\n   are still UNIX-based.\
    \  Usenet clients, called \"newsreaders\", are\n   available for virtually any\
    \ operating system.\n   While Usenet newsgroups are usually accessible at Internet\
    \ sites, a\n   prospective Usenet client host must have appropriate newsreader\n\
    \   software to be able to read news.  Users will have to check with\n   their\
    \ local host or network administrator to find out what Usenet\n   newsgroups are\
    \ locally available, as well as the local policies for\n   using them.\n   Usenet\
    \ newsgroup names are hierarchical in nature.  The first part of\n   the name,\
    \ called the \"hierarchy\", provides an indication about the\n   general subject\
    \ area.  There are two types of hierarchies, called\n   \"mainstream\" and \"\
    alternative\"; the total number of newsgroups is in\n   the thousands.  The \"\
    news.announce.newusers\" newsgroup is a good\n   place for new Usenet users to\
    \ find a detailed introduction to the use\n   of Usenet, as well as an introduction\
    \ to its culture.\n   Usenet mainstream hierarchies are established by a process\
    \ that\n   requires the approval of a majority of Usenet members.  Most sites\n\
    \   that receive a NETNEWS feed receive all of these hierarchies, which\n   include:\n\

- title: 4.1. Request for Comments (RFCs)
  contents:
  - "4.1. Request for Comments (RFCs)\n   RFCs are the body of literature comprising\
    \ Internet protocols,\n   standards, research questions, hot topics, humor (especially\
    \ those\n   dated 1 April), and general information.  Each RFC is uniquely issued\n\
    \   a number which is never reused or reissued; if a document is revised,\n  \
    \ it is given a new RFC number and the old RFC is said to be\n   \"obsoleted.\"\
    \  Announcements are sent to the RFC-DIST mailing list\n   whenever a new RFC\
    \ is issued; anyone may join this list by sending e-\n   mail to \"rfc-request@nic.ddn.mil\"\
    .\n   RFCs may be obtained through the mail (i.e., postal service), but it\n \
    \  is easier and faster to get them on-line.  One easy way to obtain\n   RFCs\
    \ on-line is to use RFC-INFO, an e-mail-based service to help\n   users locate\
    \ and retrieve RFCs and other Internet documents.  To use\n   the service, send\
    \ e-mail to \"rfc-info@isi.edu\" and leave the\n   \"Subject:\" field blank; commands\
    \ that may go in the main body of the\n   message include:\n     HELP        \
    \               (Help file)\n     HELP: ways_to_get_rfcs     (Help file on how\
    \ to get RFCs)\n     RETRIEVE: RFC\n        Doc-ID: RFCxxxx         (Retrieve\

    \       OBSOLETES: RFCxxxx        (List RFCs obsoleting RFC xxxx)\n   An alternative\
    \ way to obtain RFCs by e-mail is to send an e-mail\n   message to \"service@nic.ddn.mil\"\
    , leaving the \"Subject:\" field blank.\n   In the main body of the message, use\
    \ one or more of the following\n   commands.  The RFC index, or a specific reference\
    \ to an RFC, will\n   indicate whether the RFC is available in ASCII text or PostScript\n\
    \   format.  By convention, all RFCs are available in ASCII while some\n   are\
    \ also available in PostScript where use of graphics and/or\n   different fonts\
    \ adds more information or clarity.  The instructions\n   below show how to get\
    \ the index; be aware that this file is very\n   large, containing the citing\
    \ for over 1,700 documents.  Note that not\n   all RFCs numbered below 698 (July\
    \ 1975) are available on-line:\n      SEND HELP                  (Help file)\n\

  - "4.2. Internet Standards\n   RFCs describe many aspects of the Internet.  By the\
    \ early 1990s,\n   however, so many specifications of various protocols had been\
    \ written\n   that it was not always clear as to which documents represented\n\
    \   standards for the Internet.  For that reason, a subset of RFCs have\n   been\
    \ designated as STDs to identify them as Internet standards.\n   Unlike RFC numbers\
    \ that are never reused, STD numbers always refer to\n   the latest version of\
    \ the standard.  UDP, for example, would be\n   completely identified as \"STD-6/RFC-768.\"\
    \  Note that STD numbers\n   refer to a standard, which is not necessarily a single\
    \ document; an\n   STD, therefore, might refer to several RFCs.  STD 19, for example,\
    \ is\n   the NetBIOS Service Protocols standard and comprises RFCs 1001 and\n\
    \   1002; a complete citation for this standard would be \"STD-19/RFC-\n   1001/RFC-1002.\"\
    \n   The availability of new STDs is announced on the RFC-DIST mailing\n   list.\
    \  STD-1 [14] always refers to the latest list of \"Internet\n   Official Protocol\
    \ Standards\".  The Internet standards process is\n   described in RFC 1602 [6]\
    \ and STD notes are explained in RFC 1311\n   [15].\n   STDs can be obtained as\
    \ RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC\n   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites\
    \ (such as \"nic.ddn.mil\")\n   provide an STD directory so that STD documents\
    \ can be found in the\n   path \"/STD/xx.TXT\", where \"xx\" refers to the STD\
    \ number.\n   STD documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described\
    \ in\n   Section 4.1.  STDs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using\n\
    \   the \"RETRIEVE: STD\" and \"Doc-ID: STDxxxx\" commands.  Also, check out\n\
    \   the path \"STD's (Standard RFC's)\" under the documentation root path\n  \
