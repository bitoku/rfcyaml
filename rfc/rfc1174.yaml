    \ The\n   first is a \"Recommended Policy on Distributing Internet Identifier\n\
    \   Assignment\", that is, a suggestion to distribute the function of\n   assigning\
    \ network and autonomous system numbers.  The second is a\n   \"Recommended Policy\
    \ Change to Internet 'Connected' Status\", that is,\n   a suggestion to drop the\
    \ notion of connected status in favor of\n   recording the acceptable use policy\
    \ and traffic access policy for\n   each network.  Included in this second recommendation\
    \ is the explict\n   suggestion that any registered network may be entered into\

- title: 1.1.  Summary
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Summary\n   This document recommends procedures for distributing assignment\
    \ of\n   Internet identifiers (network and autonomous system numbers).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Introduction\n   Throughout its entire history, the Internet system has\
    \ employed a\n   central Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for the allocation\n\
    \   and assignment of various numeric identifiers needed for the\n   operation\
    \ of the Internet.  The IANA function is performed by USC\n   Information Sciences\
    \ Institute.  The IANA has the discretionary\n   authority to delegate portions\
    \ of this responsibility and, with\n   respect to numeric network and autonomous\
    \ system identifiers, has\n   lodged this responsibility with an Internet Registry\
    \ (IR).  This\n   function is performed by SRI International at its Network Information\n\
    \   Center (DDN-NIC).\n   With the rapid escalation of the number of networks\
    \ in the Internet\n   and its concurrent internationalization, it is timely to\
    \ consider\n   further delegation of assignment and registration authority on\
    \ an\n   international basis.  It is also essential to take into consideration\n\
    \   that such identifiers, particularly network identifiers of class A\n   and\
    \ B type, will become an increasingly scarce commodity whose\n   allocation must\
    \ be handled with thoughtful care.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Proposed Method of Operation
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Proposed Method of Operation\n   It is proposed to retain the centralized\
    \ IANA and IR functions.\n   The IR would continue to be the principal registry\
    \ for all network\n   and autonomous system numbers.  It would also continue to\
    \ maintain\n   the list of root Domain Name System servers and a database of\n\
    \   registered nets and autonomous systems.\n   In addition, however, the IR would\
    \ also allocate to organizations\n   approved by the Coordinating Committee for\
    \ Intercontinental Research\n   Networking (CCIRN) blocks of network and autonomous\
    \ system numbers,\n   as needed, and delegate to them further assignment authority.\n\
    \   It is recommended that, at least initially, the IR serve as the\n   default\
    \ registry in cases where no delegated registration authority\n   has been identified.\n\
    \   Copies of the aggregate Internet registration database(s) should be\n   maintained\
    \ by the IR and copies provided to each delegated registry\n   to improve redundancy\
    \ and access to this information.  Updates to the\n   database, however, would\
    \ still be centralized at the IR with complete\n   copies redistributed by file\
    \ transfer or other means on a timely\n   basis.\n   It is recommended that candidate\
    \ delegated registries meet with the\n   IANA and IR to review operational procedures\
    \ and requirements and to\n   produce documentation to be issued as RFCs describing\
    \ the details of\n   the proposed distributed mode of operation.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that host Domain Name registration continue in its\n   present form which already\
    \ accommodates distribution of this\n   function.\n"

- title: 2.2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Introduction\n   In the following, the term Internet Assigned Number Authority\

    \  This function is presently performed by USC Information\n   Sciences Institute.\
    \  The term Internet Registry (IR) refers to the\n   organization which has the\
    \ responsibility for gathering and\n   registering information about networks\
    \ to which identifiers (network\n   numbers, autonomous system numbers) have been\
    \ assigned by the IR.  At\n   present, SRI International serves as the IR.\n \
    \  Attachments (1) and (2) outline the rationale for and implications of\n   changing\
    \ the current policy for associating \"connected\" status with\n   only a subset\
    \ of networks which have been assigned Internet\n   identifiers.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Recommendations\n   The following actions are recommended:\n      1. The\
    \ Internet Registry should be instructed to drop all\n      reference to \"connected\"\
    \ status in its databases and in its forms\n      for Internet network and autonomous\
    \ system registration.\n      2. The Internet Registry should be instructed to\
    \ request brief\n      statements of acceptable network usage, access and transit\
    \ policy\n      for external traffic (i.e., traffic entering from or exiting to\n\
    \      other networks) from each applicant for a network or autonomous\n     \
    \ system identifier.  For example, some networks conform to the\n      National\
    \ Science Foundation acceptable use guidelines; other\n      networks will carry\
    \ any traffic (e.g., common carriers); others\n      may prohibit transit use.\
    \  Retrospective statements should be\n      gathered by the IR for networks already\
    \ registered.  Such\n      statements should be made available on-line and widely\
    \ publicized.\n      3. The Internet Registry should be instructed to allow any\n\
    \      registered networks to be entered into the Domain Name Server\n      database\
    \ without regard to \"connected\" status.\n   Attachment: (1) Recommendation for\
    \ replacement of \"Connected\" Status\n               (2) Recommendation on DNS\
    \ and Connectivity\n"

- title: 2.a.1.2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.a.1.2.  Background\n   With the demise of the ARPANET and the growth of a global\
    \ Internet,\n   the administration and registration of Internet network numbers\
    \ has\n   outgrown its initially conceived client base: military, government\n\
    \   and government-sponsored research organizations.  Since the\n   international\
    \ growth has extended the Internet community to industry\n   and a broad range\
    \ of academic and research institutions, we must re-\n   evaluate some of the\
    \ criteria for assignment and use of Internet\n   network numbers.\n   In the\
    \ early phases of the Internet research project, numbers were\n   assigned only\
    \ to networks of organizations that were participating in\n   the research effort.\
    \  Later, as the system became more stable and\n   expanded into a widespread\
    \ infrastructure, other organizations with\n   networks were assigned network\
    \ numbers and allowed to interconnect if\n   they were parts of the U.S. Government\
    \ or sponsored by a Government\n   organization.  To ensure global uniqueness,\
    \ a single Internet\n   Registry (IR) was designated: the Defense Data Net Network\n\
    \   Information Center (DDN-NIC) at SRI International.\n   As the Internet protocols\
    \ became popular in the commercial\n   marketplace, many organizations purchased\
    \ and installed private\n   networks that needed network number assignments but\
    \ were not intended\n   to be connected to the federally-sponsored system.  The\
    \ IR adopted a\n   policy of assigning network numbers to all who requested them,\
    \ while\n   distinguishing networks permitted to link to the global Internet by\n\
    \   assigning them \"connected\" status.  Essentially, this meant that the\n \
    \  network to which the number was assigned had the sanction of a U.S.\n   Government\
    \ sponsoring organization to link to the Internet.\n   The present day Internet\
    \ encompasses networks that serve as\n   intermediaries to access the federally-sponsored\
    \ backbones.  Many of\n   these intermediate networks were initiated under the\
    \ sponsorship of\n   the National Science Foundation.  Some have been founded\
    \ without\n   federal assistance as consortia of using organizations.  The\n \
    \  Government has expressed a desire that all such networks be self-\n   supporting,\
    \ without the need for federal subsidy.  To achieve this\n   goal, it has been\
    \ essential for the intermediate networks to support\n   an increasingly varied\
    \ range of users.  A great many industrial\n   participants can be found on the\
    \ intermediate level networks.  Their\n   use of the federally-sponsored backbones\
    \ is premised on the basis\n   that the traffic is in support of academic, scholarly\
    \ or other\n   research work.  The criteria for use of the intermediate level\n\
    \   networks alone is sometimes more relaxed and, in the cases of the\n   newly-formed\
    \ commercial networks, there are no restrictions at all.\n   In essence, each\
    \ network needs to be able to determine, on the basis\n   of its own criteria,\
    \ with which networks it will interconnect and for\n   which networks it will\
    \ support transit service.  There is no longer a\n   simple binary correlation\
    \ between \"connected\" status and acceptable\n   use policy.  The matter becomes\
    \ even more complex as we contemplate\n   the large and growing number of non-U.S.\
    \ networks joining the global\n   Internet.  It is inappropriate to require that\
    \ all of these networks\n   adhere to U.S. access and use criteria; rather, it\
    \ can only be\n   required that the traffic they send through the federally-sponsored\n\
    \   networks be consistent with the federal criteria.\n"
- title: 2.a.1.3.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "2.a.1.3.  Recommendation\n   Since the concept of a single, global \"connected\"\
    \ status is no longer\n   meaningful, it is recommended that it be retired and\
    \ to define new\n   characteristics that could be used by networks within the\
    \ Internet to\n   determine a specific network's eligibility to communicate with\
    \ other\n   networks.\n   Some attributes which might be useful to track and could\
    \ be used as\n   criteria to determine the acceptability of Internet traffic for\n\
    \   routing purposes include:\n       1) Country codes\n       2) Conformance\
    \ to acceptable use policy for:\n             NSFNET, MILNET, NSI, ESnet, NORDUnet,\
    \ ...\n   To implement this idea, the IR would update the current Internet-\n\
    \   Number-Template to query applicants for the necessary information.\n   This\
    \ information would then be collected in a database containing,\n   for instance,\
    \ a matrix of network numbers over policies.  Note that\n   the policies might\
    \ be presented in narrative form.  In addition, the\n   usage policies of the\
    \ various networks must be publicly available so\n   that applicants and other\
    \ interested parties can be advised of policy\n   issues as they relate to various\
    \ networks.\n   Under this proposal, the IR would be charged with the registration\n\
    \   and administration of the Internet number space but not with the\n   enforcement\
    \ of policy.  The IR should collect enough information to\n   permit network administrators\
    \ to make intelligent decisions as to the\n   acceptability of traffic destined\
    \ to or from each and every\n   legitimate Internet number.  Enforcement of policies\
    \ is discussed\n   below.\n   At a later step, we anticipate that it will be desirable\
    \ to\n   distribute the IR function among multiple centers, e.g., with centers\n\
    \   on different continents.  This should be straight-forward once the IR\n  \
    \ function is divorced from policy enforcement.\n"
- title: 2.a.1.4.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "2.a.1.4.  Discussion\n   It is already true in the current Internet that there\
    \ are\n   restrictions on certain traffic on particular networks.  For example,\n\
    \   two intermediate level networks that are willing to carry arbitrary\n   traffic\
    \ can link with each other but are barred from passing\n   commercial traffic\
    \ or any other traffic that is not for academic or\n   scholarly purposes across\
    \ the federally-sponsored backbones.\n   Routing of traffic based upon acceptable-use\
    \ policies requires a\n   technical ability known as \"policy-based routing\"\
    \ (PBR).  At the\n   present time, the PBR mechanism available in the Internet\
    \ operates as\n   the level of an entire network; all users and hosts on a network\
    \ are\n   subject to the same routes for a given destination.  Using this PBR\n\
    \   mechanism, a network maintains routes (and provides transit services)\n  \
    \ only for networks with compatible use policies.  For an intermediate\n   level\
    \ network, for example, the routing decisions must be made on the\n   basis of\
    \ the network numbers assigned to the organizations; some\n   might be considered\
    \ to have traffic conformant with federal use\n   policies and some might not.\n\
    \   Although it is much more fine-grained than the current \"on or off\"\n   rule\
    \ of connected status, the use of PBR based on networks is still a\n   very coarse\
    \ measure of control.  Since the decision on acceptability\n   is made at the\
    \ network level, one has to assign a set of\n   characteristics to all traffic\
    \ emanating from or entering into a\n   given network to make this access control\
    \ strategy work.  Strict\n   application of such controls could prevent a commercial\
    \ organization\n   from legitimately sending research or scholarly data across\
    \ the\n   federal backbone (e.g., IBM needs to communicate with MCI and MERIT\n\
    \   about NSFNET, but other parts of IBM may need to communicate on\n   commercial\
    \ matters). Organizations with a variety of uses might have\n   to artificially\
    \ define several networks with which to associate\n   different use policies.\n\
    \   The practical result is that in order to support desirable usage\n   patterns,\
    \ government-sponsored networks will sometimes have to depend\n   upon self-policing\
    \ by traffic sources, rather than upon strict\n   mechanical enforcement of acceptable\
    \ use policies.  Higher certainty\n   on usage will have a cost in terms of limiting\
    \ desirable access.\n   An important project now underway in the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF) is developing a more general mechanism for PBR that will\n\
    \   allow control at the level of individual hosts and possibly even\n   user.\
    \  It will give an end host or user the ability to select routes,\n   taking into\
    \ consideration issues such as cost, performance and\n   reliability of the transit\
    \ networks.\n"

- title: IAB Policy Recommendation on DNS and Connectivity
  contents:
  - "IAB Policy Recommendation on DNS and Connectivity\n   The Internet Domain Name\
    \ system (DNS) is an essential part of the\n   networking infrastructure.  It\
    \ establishes a global distributed\n   database for mapping host names into IP\
    \ addresses and for delivering\n   electronic mail.  Its efficient and reliable\
    \ functioning is vital to\n   nearly all Internet users.\n   Some DNS operations\
    \ depend upon the existence of a complete database\n   at certain \"root\" servers,\
    \ in particular at the Internet Registry\n   (IP) located at the Defense Data\
    \ Net Network Information Center at\n   SRI International (DDN-NIC).  The past\
    \ policy has been to tie\n   inclusion in this database to approval of Internet\
    \ interconnection by\n   a U.S. Government agency.  This \"connected\" status\
    \ restriction is no\n   longer viable, and recommendations for its replacement\
    \ have been put\n   forward.\n   In any case, we believe that the DNS database\
    \ is not the proper\n   architectural level for enforcement of administrative\
    \ access\n   restrictions, e.g., controls over the announcement of networks in\
    \ the\n   routing protocols.\n   The Internet Activities Board (IAB) therefore\
    \ strongly endorses the\n   following recommendation from the Federal Engineering\
    \ Planning Group\n   to the Federal Networking Council, to provide DNS service\
    \ regardless\n   of access control policies:\n      \"There has been a great deal\
    \ of discussion about domain\n      nameservers, the IN-ADDR domain, and \"connected\"\
    \ status as the\n      Internet has grown to include many more nations than just\
    \ the\n      United States.  As we move to a more global Internet, it seems\n\
    \      like it would be a good idea to re-evaluate some of the rules that\n  \
    \    have governed the naming and registration policies that exist.\n      The\
    \ naming and routing should be completely decoupled.  In\n      particular, it\
    \ should be possible to register both a name/domain,\n      as well as address\
    \ servers within the IN-ADDR domain, independent\n      of whether the client\
    \ has \"connected\" status or not.  This should\n      be implemented immediately\
    \ by the IR at the DDN-NIC.  No U.S.\n      Government sponsor should be required\
    \ for domain name/address\n      registration.\"\n"
