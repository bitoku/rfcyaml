- title: 2. VPIM Scope
  contents:
  - "2. VPIM Scope\n   The VPIM specification defines a restricted profile of the\
    \ Internet\n   multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing\n\
    \   platforms.  These platforms have historically been special-purpose\n   computers\
    \ and often do not have the same facilities normally\n   associated with a traditional\
    \ Internet Email-capable computer.  As a\n   result, VPIM also specifies additional\
    \ functionality as it is needed.\n   The profile is intended to specify the minimum\
    \ common set of features\n   to allow interworking between compliant systems.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"\
    \ in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].\n"

- title: 3.1 multipart/voice-message
  contents:
  - "3.1 multipart/voice-message\n   The MIME sub-type multipart/voice-message is\
    \ defined to hold specific\n   media contents that are interchanged in messages\
    \ between voice\n   messaging systems described in [VPIM2].  Essentially, the\
    \ sub-type\n   provides a simple wrapper that easily identifies the entire content\n\
    \   as being the components of a single voice message.  The sub-type is\n   identical\
    \ in semantics and syntax to multipart/mixed, as defined in\n   [MIME2].  As such,\
    \ it may be safely interpreted as a multipart/mixed\n   by systems that do not\
    \ understand the sub-type (only the\n   identification as a voice message would\
    \ be lost).\n   This mechanism allows the insertion of an explanatory preamble\
    \ (e.g.\n   VPIM voice message attached) for recipients who read the message with\n\
    \   pre-MIME software, since the preamble will be ignored by MIME-\n   compliant\
    \ software.\n   In addition to the MIME required boundary parameter, a version\n\
    \   parameter is also required for this sub-type.  This is to\n   distinguish,\
    \ this refinement of the sub-type from the previous\n   definition in [VPIM1].\
    \  The value of the version parameter is \"2.0\"\n   if the content conforms to\
    \ the requirements of [VPIM2].  Should there\n   be further revisions of this\
    \ content type, there MUST be backwards\n   compatibility (i.e. systems implementing\
    \ version n can read version\n   2, and systems implementing version 2 can read\
    \ version 2 contents\n   within a version n).  The default version value (when\
    \ the parameter\n   is missing) is 1, indicating the content conforms to the requirements\n\
    \   of [VPIM1].\n   [VPIM2] describes the restriction that only specific media\
    \ types,\n   applicable to voice messaging, are valid `next-level' contents of\n\
    \   this sub-type (when version=2.0).  They are: audio/*, image/*,\n   message/rfc822\
    \ and application/directory.  The multipart provides for\n   the packaging of\
    \ as many of these contents as is necessary.\n"
- title: 3.2 VPIM v2 Usage
  contents:
  - "3.2 VPIM v2 Usage\n   The multipart/voice-message sub-type is a primary component\
    \ of the\n   VPIM specification [VPIM2].  All VPIM Messages MUST contain this\n\
    \   sub-type to identify the wrapping of a voice message.  The contents\n   of\
    \ this wrapper can vary from only one audio/32KADPCM content to a\n   complex\
    \ set of related and nested contents.\n   Typically, if more than one audio segment\
    \ is present, the first is\n   the spoken name of the originator, the second is\
    \ the spoken subject,\n   and the third is the voice message itself.  This order,\
    \ however, MUST\n   NOT be assumed in any case.  Further, the order that the contents\n\
    \   appear SHOULD be the order in which they are presented to the user.\n   The\
    \ spoken name segment, if available, shall contain the name of the\n   message\
    \ sender in the voice of the sender.  The length of the spoken\n   name segment\
    \ must not exceed 12 seconds.\n   The spoken subject segment, if available, shall\
    \ contain the subject\n   of the message sender in the voice of the sender.  The\
    \ length of the\n   spoken subject segment must not exceed 20 seconds.\n   The\
    \ directory information part, if present, will contain information\n   specific\
    \ to the orginator of the voice message.\n   Refer to the VPIM v2 Specification\
    \ for details on proper usage.\n"
