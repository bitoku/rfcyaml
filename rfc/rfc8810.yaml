- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration\n\
    \   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range\n   formerly\
    \ designated \"Private Use\" is divided into three new ranges:\n   \"First Come\
    \ First Served\", \"Experimental Use\", and \"Reserved\".\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Border Gateway Protocol uses a mechanism called \"Capability\n\
    \   Advertisement\" [RFC5492] to enable BGP peers to tell one another\n   about\
    \ their optional protocol extensions.  These so-called\n   \"Capabilities\" are\
    \ signaled using code points called \"Capability\n   Codes\".\n   [RFC5492] designates\
    \ the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as\n   \"Private Use\".  Subsequent experience\
    \ has shown this to be not only\n   useless, but actively confusing to implementors.\n\
    \   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for\n   the\
    \ range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in\n   [RFC8126]:\n\
    \   128-238:  First Come First Served\n   239-254:  Experimental Use\n   255:\
    \      Reserved\n   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,\n\
    \   remaining \"IETF Review\" and \"First Come First Served\", respectively.\n\
    \   The full range for \"First Come First Served\" is now 64-238.\n"
- title: 2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "2.  Discussion\n   The reason for providing an \"Experimental Use\" range is\
    \ to preserve a\n   range for use during early development.  Although there are\
    \ few\n   practical differences between \"Experimental Use\" and \"Private Use\"\
    ,\n   the change both makes it clear that code points from this space\n   should\
    \ not be used long term or in shipping products and reduces the\n   consumption\
    \ of the scarce Capability Codes space expended for this\n   purpose.  Once classified\
    \ as \"Experimental Use\", it should be\n   considered difficult to reclassify\
    \ the space for some other purpose\n   in the future.\n   The reason for reserving\
    \ the maximum value is that it may be useful\n   in the future if extension of\
    \ the number space is needed.\n   Since the range 128-255 was formerly designated\
    \ \"Private Use\",\n   implementors may have chosen to use code points within\
    \ that range\n   prior to publication of this document.  For this reason, a survey\
    \ was\n   conducted beginning August 14, 2015 (version 01 of the individual\n\
    \   draft [SCUDDER]) to find any such uses.  A number were contributed\n   and\
    \ were used to seed Table 2.  Of course, there can be no guarantee\n   that all\
    \ uses were discovered; however, the likelihood seems high\n   that remaining\
    \ uses, if any, genuinely do fall under the intended use\n   of \"Private Use\"\
    \ and are restricted to some special deployment and\n   are not in wide use. \
    \ Furthermore, any remaining uses would be no\n   worse than any other code point\
    \ collision, such as occasionally\n   occurs with code point \"squatting\", and\
    \ could be dealt with in the\n   same manner.\n"
