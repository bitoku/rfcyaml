    \   Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n   Release\
    \ 5.  This document does not pass judgment on the usage of\n   these command codes.\
    \  Further more, these command codes are for use\n   for Release 5.  For future\
    \ releases, these codes cannot be reused,\n   but must be allocated according\
    \ to the Diameter Base specification.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining\
    \ the\n   Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of their Release 5\n   architecture.\
    \  As part of this architecture, they have defined a\n   Diameter application\
    \ [29.229] and [29.329] which requires the use of\n   new Diameter Command Codes\
    \ [DIAM].\n"

- title: 2.  Command Code Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.  Command Code Allocation\n   The IANA has allocated Diameter Command Codes\
    \ 300 through 313, for\n   use in 3GPP Release 5.  The protocols defined by these\
    \ command codes\n   have not been carefully reviewed by the IETF community and\
    \ are not\n   considered to be general mechanisms appropriate for broad usage.\n\
    \   More work is needed to develop general mechanisms and may become a\n   work\
    \ item of an IETF Working Group.  These command codes are intended\n   to be used\
    \ for 3GPP Release 5 only [29.228], [29.229].  Future 3GPP\n   releases are expected\
    \ to make use of alternate mechanisms.\n   Command codes for 3GPP Release 6 are\
    \ expected to be allocated from\n   the standard command space, with IETF documentation.\
    \  The current\n   intent as agreed with 3GPP is to develop a standards track\n\
    \   application addressing the needs of AAA for SIP/SDP and encompassing\n   the\
    \ requirements of the cellular community.\n"
