  - "               NIC DISTRIBUTION OF MANUALS AND HANDBOOKS\nThe Network Information\
    \ Center asks that whenever basic manuals or\nhandbooks are produced by Network\
    \ participants, a sufficient\nquantity be made to supply NIC with copies for distribution.\
    \  For\ngood Network communication, NIC now plans to distribute such\ndocuments\
    \ to all Station Agents for use as reference copies, to\nLiaisons for their own\
    \ use, and, when desirable, to outside\nparticipants for understanding of the\
    \ Network.\nThe number of Network participants receiving such distribution is\n\
    now approaching 80, and with the usual need for additions and\nreplacements, NIC\
    \ now makes 100 copies of most documents. NIC\ntherefore requests that Network\
    \ members issuing manuals and other\nlarge working documents assist by providing\
    \ the necessary 100 copies\nat the time of issuance.\n   [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n   [ into the online RFC archives by BBN\
    \ Corp. under the   ]\n   [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96\
    \   ]\n"
