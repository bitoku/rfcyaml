- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the exact documents that make up the complete\n\
    \   Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).  DDDS is an abstract\n   algorithm\
    \ for applying dynamically retrieved string transformation\n   rules to an application-unique\
    \ string.\n   This document along with RFC 3402, RFC 3403 and RFC 3404 obsolete\
    \ RFC\n   2168 and RFC 2915, as well as updates RFC 2276.\n"
- title: 1. Intended Audience
  contents:
  - "1. Intended Audience\n   This document and the documents that it references are\
    \ intended for\n   anyone attempting to implement or understand the generic DDDS\n\
    \   algorithm, URI Resolution, ENUM telephone number to URI resolution,\n   and\
    \ the NAPTR DNS resource record.  The reader is warned that reading\n   one of\
    \ the documents in this series without reading the others will\n   probably lead\
    \ to misunderstandings and interoperability problems.\n"
- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Delegation Discovery System is used to implement\
    \ lazy\n   binding of strings to data, in order to support dynamically\n   configured\
    \ delegation systems.  The DDDS functions by mapping some\n   unique string to\
    \ data stored within a DDDS Database by iteratively\n   applying string transformation\
    \ rules until a terminal condition is\n   reached.  This document defines the\
    \ entire DDDS by listing the\n   documents that make up the complete specification\
    \ at this time.\n   This document along with RFC 3402, RFC 3403 and RFC 3404 obsoletes\n\
    \   RFC 2168 [8] and RFC 2915 [6], as well as updates RFC 2276 [5].  This\n  \
    \ document will be updated and or obsoleted when changes are made to\n   the DDDS\
    \ specifications.  Thus the reader is strongly encouraged to\n   check the IETF\
    \ RFC repository for any documents that obsoletes or\n   updates this one.\n"
- title: 3. The Algorithm
  contents:
  - "3. The Algorithm\n   The DDDS algorithm is defined by RFC 3402 [1].  That document\
    \ defines\n   the following DDDS concepts:\n   o  The basic DDDS vocabulary.\n\
    \   o  The algorithm.\n   o  The requirements on applications using the algorithm.\n\
    \   o  The requirements on databases that store DDDS rules.\n   RFC 3402 is the\
    \ actual DDDS Algorithm specification.  But the\n   specification by itself is\
    \ useless without some additional document\n   that defines how and why the algorithm\
    \ is used.  These documents are\n   called Applications and do not actually make\
    \ up part of the DDDS core\n   specification.  Applications require databases\
    \ in which to store\n   their Rules.  These databases are called DDDS Databases\
    \ and are\n   usually specified in separate documents.  But again, these Database\n\
    \   specifications are not included in the DDDS core specification\n   itself.\n"
- title: 4. DDDS Applications
  contents:
  - "4. DDDS Applications\n   No implementation can begin without an Application specification,\
    \ as\n   this is what provides the concrete instantiation details for the DDDS\n\
    \   Algorithm.  Without them the DDDS is nothing more than a general\n   algorithm.\
    \  Application documents define the following:\n   o  the Application Unique String\
    \ (the thing the delegation rules act\n      on).\n   o  the First Well Known\
    \ Rule (the Rule that says where the process\n      starts).\n   o  the list of\
    \ valid Databases (you can't just use any Database).\n   o  the final expected\
    \ output.\n   Some sample Applications are documented in:\n   o  \"E.164 number\
    \ and DNS\" (RFC 2916) [7].  This Application uses the\n      DDDS to map a telephone\
    \ number to service endpoints such as SIP or\n      email.\n   o  \"Dynamic Delegation\
    \ Discovery System (DDDS) Part Four: The Uniform\n      Resource Identifiers (URI)\
    \ Resolution Application\" (RFC 3404) [3].\n      This Application uses the DDDS\
    \ to resolve any URI to a set of\n      endpoints or 'resolvers' that can give\
    \ additional information\n      about the URI independent of its particular URI\
    \ scheme.\n"
- title: 5. Currently Standardized Databases
  contents:
  - "5. Currently Standardized Databases\n   Any DDDS Application must use some type\
    \ of DDDS Database.  Database\n   documents define the following:\n   o  the general\
    \ spec for how the Database works.\n   o  formats for Keys.\n   o  formats for\
    \ Rules.\n   o  Key lookup process.\n   o  rule insertion procedures.\n   o  collision\
    \ avoidance measures.\n   A Database cannot be used on its own; there must be\
    \ at least one\n   Application that uses it.  Multiple Databases and Applications\
    \ are\n   defined, and some Databases will support multiple Applications.\n  \
    \ However, not every Application uses each Database, and vice versa.\n   Thus,\
    \ compliance is defined by the combination of a Database and\n   Application specification.\n\
    \   One sample Database specification is documented in:\n   o  \"Dynamic Delegation\
    \ Discovery System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain\n      Name System (DNS) Database\"\
    \ (RFC 3402) [1].  (This document is the\n      official specification for the\
    \ NAPTR DNS Resource Record.)\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Any known security issues that arise from the\
    \ use of algorithms and\n   databases must be specified in the respective specifications.\
    \  They\n   must be completely and fully described.  It is not required that the\n\
    \   database and algorithms be secure or that it be free from risks, but\n   that\
    \ the known risks be identified.  Publication of a new database\n   type or algorithm\
    \ does require a security review, and the security\n   considerations section\
    \ should be subject to continuing evaluation.\n   Additional security considerations\
    \ should be addressed by publishing\n   revised versions of the database and algorithm\
    \ specifications.\n"
- title: 7. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. IANA Considerations\n   While this document itself does not create any new\
    \ requirements for\n   the IANA, the documents in this series create many varied\n\
    \   requirements.  The IANA Considerations sections in those documents\n   should\
    \ be reviewed by the IANA to determine the complete set of new\n   registries\
    \ and requirements.  Any new algorithms, databases or\n   applications should\
    \ take great care in what they require the IANA to\n   do in the future.\n"
