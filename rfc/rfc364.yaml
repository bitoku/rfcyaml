- title: Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "Problem Statement\n   Second only to the unavailability of the serving host,\
    \ the most\n   vexing problem encountered in attempting to use the service hosts\
    \ on\n   the NET has been the inadequacy of administrative procedure and\n   information\
    \ dissemination for remote users. This paper explores the\n   problem and proposes\
    \ solutions.\n   When computer systems begin to service remote users, some of\
    \ the\n   operating procedures which produced a functioning environment for\n\
    \   local users may not be satisfactory for those who are off-site. It\n   may\
    \ be that these procedures were already inadequate, but the local\n   community\
    \ developed a set of informal procedures to augment the\n   formal ones. It may\
    \ also be true that the established formal\n   procedures were completely satisfactory\
    \ for local users, but failed\n   when an attempt was made to extend them to the\
    \ remote user. In either\n   case, this paper asserts that a problem exists and\
    \ offers a set of\n   suggestions for its amelioration.\n"
- title: Existing Information
  contents:
  - "Existing Information\n   Having used (or attempted to use) the information currently\n\
    \   available, I should first summarize the existing sources and indicate\n  \
    \ that they don't meet total needs. There is the resource notebook\n   index.\
    \ The index is an ordered list of attributes which refer one to\n   the appropriate\
    \ main entry for hosts exhibiting that attribute. When\n   the index is completed,\
    \ it will reference the main entries in the\n   resource notebook, to which we\
    \ now turn out attention. On the whole,\n   the main entry contains a summary\
    \ of the hardware and software\n   services available. At this site, these entries\
    \ serve as a \"shopping\n   list\" from which we may select the service center\
    \ hosts which may be\n   suitable for the computing we wish to undertake. Some\
    \ administrative\n   information is also provided. Using the outline of a host-site\n\
    \   subsection, this information consists of: I. Personnel; V.B.  Rate\n   structure;\
    \ V.D. Long-term storage; VII. Login; VIII. Operator\n   Communication; IX. Miscellaneous;\
    \ and X. Programs. The discussion\n   under \"IX. Miscellaneous\" included a statement\
    \ of intention to\n   include an elaborated documentation section in a future\
    \ revision of\n   the resource book. This is most urgently required. This paper\n\
    \   contains a proposal which might constitute the outline for that\n   section.\n\
    \   Another source of information concerning serving hosts is the NIC.\n   Some\
    \ sites have submitted existing documentation to the NIC; some\n   have even written\
    \ special documents to assist network users. There\n   are several problems however:\
    \ It may be difficult to learn about said\n   documents, especially for someone\
    \ new to the ARPANET and/or the NIC.\n   NIC policy is to lend the documents,\
    \ which is fine for browsing but\n   unacceptable for reference.\n"

  - "Information Required\n   Employing a questionnaire format, I will now present\
    \ additional\n   outline entries which might be used to supplement NIC 6801.\n\
    \   XI.  Administrative Procedures relating to Financial Arrangements\n      \
    \  Who does a prospective user contact?\n        Is there a way to sample using\
    \ the system (gratis)?\n        How does one open an account for computer services?\n\

    \    Is there a \"beginners pocket\"? Does it contain examples?\n        Is there\
    \ a list of documents available? Where?\n        Where are published documents\
    \ sold?\n        How does the remote user obtain these documents?\n        May\

    \ becoming a subscriber? For obtaining back issues?\n        Is there a \"message\
    \ of the day\" automatically presented?\n        How does an irregular user keep\
    \ informed of past \"messages of\n        the day\"?\n        Is there an on-line\
    \ information service like a newspaper? How\n        does one obtain \"back issues\"\
    \ of the \"newspaper\"?\n        B.  User Assistance\n        Is there a (required)\
    \ single point of contact for remote users?\n        What is his level of technical\
    \ competence?\n        What is his level of administrative responsibility?\n \
    \       When the contact person cannot answer a question will he follow\n    \
    \    it up with the appropriate in-house person? Will the remote user\n      \
    \  be referred to the in-house person?\n        To what extent will a remote user\
    \ be permitted or denied access\n        to technical and administrative staff?\n\
    \        What priority does the local user have relative to the remote\n     \
    \   user?\n        Is there a telephone service for answering questions?\n   \
    \     Is INWATS or equivalent provided?\n        What are the service hours?\n\
    \        Is there an on-line assistance mechanism? How does it work?\n       \
    \ Is there a mechanism for sending messages to an off-line user\n        consultant?\n\

    \ of system capabilities?\n           1. Communications\n              How do\
    \ you log in (or whatever it is called)?\n              What device assumptions\
    \ are made concerning lines per\n              page, columns per line, (seperate)\
    \ line feed, (seperate)\n              carriage return, (combined) carriage return\
    \ line feed,\n              horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, and back\
    \ space?\n              Have any of the non-printing ASCII characters been\n \
    \             assigned non-standard functions?\n           2. Command language\n\
    \              What is the minimum set of control statements required?\n     \
    \         Where are the control statements documented?\n              What are\

    \ that\n              is required in order to use the editor(s) and language\n\
    \              processors?\n              Are names divided into adjectival qualifiers?\
    \ What are\n              these called? Are there restrictions? Defaults?\n  \
    \            Describe the editor(s) characteristics. What documentation\n    \
    \          is available?\n              Are there in-line editing features (e.g.,\
    \ erase\n              immediately preceding character, erase entire line)?\n\

    \    Can a remote user direct printing, punched cards, plotting, etc.\n      \
    \  to an on-site device? How does he get his output mailed to him?\n        What\
    \ off-line secondary storage is available? How is it used?\n        What does\
    \ it cost?\n        How does the remote user request, renew, release, mount and\n\
    \        demount tapes and disk packs?\n        What arrangements are there for\
    \ mailing off-line storage media?\n        Is the operating staff aware that there\
    \ are remote users?\n        Are there services available to local users not available\
    \ to\n        remote users; and conversely?\n        Is there on-line file storage?\
    \ What does it cost? What limits\n        are imposed?  How often is it backed-up?\n\
    \        Does the announced operating schedule consider users in\n        different\
    \ time zones?\n        Is the announced schedule closely followed?\n        How\
    \ are remote users notified of changes in the schedule?\n"

  - "Implementation\n   Much of the information suggested herein as being beneficial\
    \ for\n   remote user would also apply to local users. Perhaps much of it\n  \
    \ already exists in local documentation. I assert that the remote user\n   is\
    \ usually unable to easily find the information, especially when he\n   works\
    \ with several remote hosts. Presenting the information in a\n   format that followed\
    \ a standard outline would certainly be a service.\n   I also recognize that preparation\
    \ of this information might involve a\n   duplication of effort, and would possibly\
    \ produce two documents which\n   had to be updated when changes occurred. One\
    \ solution is to follow\n   the outline in producing a guide to the literature\
    \ available from the\n   host site.\n            [ This RFC was put into machine\
