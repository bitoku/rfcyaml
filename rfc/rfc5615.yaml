- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Since the initial development of H.248/MEGACO, a number\
    \ of\n   organizations have made use of the H.248/MEGACO protocol Package\n  \
    \ mechanism in order to allow a certain function to be controlled by\n   H.248/MEGACO.\
    \  The H.248/MEGACO Package mechanism was introduced, in\n   part, to allow organizations\
    \ who had an in-depth knowledge in a\n   particular functional area to independently\
    \ produce a Package on this\n   functionality.  This acknowledged the fact that\
    \ neither the IETF\n   MEGACO Working Group nor the ITU-T Study Group 16 possessed\
    \ in-depth\n   knowledge in all areas.  Whilst this approach has been successful\
    \ in\n   the number and range of Packages produced, in some cases these\n   Packages\
    \ were/are not fully aligned with H.248/MEGACO principles.\n   Once a Package\
    \ has been published and registered, it is problematic\n   to rectify any issues.\n\
    \   The introduction of problems/inconsistencies was caused, in part, by\n   the\
    \ fact that the Packages were not fully reviewed by H.248/MEGACO\n   experts.\
    \  In fact, the IANA H.248/MEGACO registration process did not\n   actually specify\
    \ that an in-depth review should take place.\n   The current H.248/MEGACO Package\
    \ registration process was defined\n   when the ITU-T Study Group 16 and the IETF\
    \ MEGACO Working Groups were\n   both active in H.248/MEGACO standardization and\
    \ produced nearly all\n   the registered Packages.  Packages were reviewed in\
    \ the IETF MEGACO\n   Working Group and the Working Group chair was the IESG-appointed\n\
    \   expert in charge of the review of the requests for H.248 Package\n   registration.\
    \  This meant that H.248 Packages underwent an informal\n   review before being\
    \ registered.  However, this has changed.\n   The current situation is that now\
    \ the IETF MEGACO Working Group is\n   disbanded and new H.248/MEGACO development\
    \ typically occurs through\n   Question 3 of ITU-T Study Group 16 (notwithstanding\
    \ email discussion\n   on the IETF MEGACO mailing list).  This move to ITU-T-defined\n\
    \   Recommendations is discussed in [RFC5125].\n   Given this situation, it is\
    \ appropriate that the H.248/Package\n   definition and IANA registration rules\
    \ are updated to introduce a\n   formal review step before the Package registration\
    \ process is\n   completed and, ideally, before the Package is published.  This\n\
    \   process will only be applicable to public Packages.\n   As part of the Package\
    \ development process, Package developers are\n   encouraged to send their Package\
    \ for review to the ITU-T Study Group\n   Question Rapporteur responsible for\
    \ the H.248 sub-series of\n   Recommendations (ITU-T Question 3 of Study Group\
    \ 16 at the time of\n   writing).  When registering the Package with IANA, Package\
    \ developers\n   are required to send a copy of the Package for review by the\
    \ IESG-\n   appointed expert.  It is recommended to register the Package before\n\
    \   final approval by the group in question, in order to solicit feedback\n  \
    \ on the quality of their Package.  Wherever possible, this review will\n   be\
    \ done in conjunction with other H.248/MEGACO experts (e.g., in\n   ITU-T Q.3/16\
    \ and/or the MEGACO mailing list).\n   The existing IANA Package registration\
    \ process is a two-step process.\n   When Packages are first registered, they\
    \ receive the status of \"In\n   Progress (IP)\".  This allows Package developers\
    \ to request a\n   PackageID before the document is fully approved.  When the\
    \ document\n   is approved, then a change of status to \"Final\" may be requested.\n\
    \   The new procedure introduces the step that the IESG-appointed expert\n   is\
    \ consulted before a change of status is made.  If the Package has\n   been reviewed\
    \ and is acceptable, then the status may be changed to\n   \"Final\".  However,\
    \ if the Package has not been provided for review or\n   has outstanding comments,\
    \ then the status SHALL remain at \"IP\".\n   The goal of the updated text is\
    \ to define a process that provides a\n   timely technical review of Packages\
    \ to ensure that H.248/MEGACO\n   Packages are of good quality and to minimize\
    \ duplication.\n   The \"Error Code\", \"ServiceChange Reason\", and \"Profile\
    \ Name\"\n   registration procedures have been included for completeness and to\n\
    \   make explicit the role of the IESG reviewer.  These procedures align\n   with\
    \ the considerations documented in [H248amm1] and with [RFC3525]\n   (with the\
    \ exception of Profile Names, which did not appear in the\n   [RFC3525] version).\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Updating the IANA H.248/MEGACO Package registration\
    \ procedures has no\n   additional security implications.  Security for the H.248/MEGACO\n\
    \   protocol over IP transports is discussed in H.248.1 Section 10\n   [H248amm1].\n\
    \   As of this date, there have been no recorded security issues arising\n   out\
    \ of the registration or use of Packages.  Whilst Packages may\n   define extra\
    \ procedures and code points, these are done within the\n   framework of the core\
    \ H.248.1 specification.  It is not possible to\n   update the H.248.1 core protocol\
    \ through a Package specification.\n   The use of the H.248.1 core protocol is\
    \ agreed upon between a Media\n   Gateway Controller (MGC) and a Media Gateway\
    \ (MG).  H.248\n   ServiceChange procedures establish a H.248 control association\n\
    \   between the MGC and MG.  To establish an association, there must be a\n  \
    \ level of trust between the MGC and MG.  In the context of this\n   control (and\
    \ trust) association, the elements\n   (properties/signals/events/statistics)\
    \ from the Packages are conveyed\n   between the MGC and MG.  An MGC or MG will\
    \ only act upon elements\n   that it knows.  If it does not understand a PackageID\
    \ or Package\n   element, then an error response is returned only in the context\
    \ of\n   the control association.\n   If a malicious Package specification is\
    \ implemented in an MGC or MG,\n   it would be unlikely to cause problems.  As\
    \ H.248 is a master slave\n   protocol, if the malicious Package was implemented\
    \ in the MGC and not\n   the MG, there would be no action because the MG would\
    \ not understand\n   the PackageID (and elements).  If the malicious Package was\n\
    \   implemented on the MG, there would be no effect because the MGC would\n  \
    \ never command the MG to use it.  If the malicious Package was\n   implemented\
    \ in both the MGC and MG, then there's a wider, non-H.248\n   issue in that someone\
    \ has managed to install software on both the MGC\n   and the MG.  It is highly\
    \ unlikely for such a person to ask IANA for\n   a PackageID when they could use\
    \ any one they want.\n   Therefore, it is in this respect that updates to the\
    \ IANA\n   H.248/MEGACO Package registration procedures are deemed to have no\n\
    \   additional security impacts.\n   Requesters and the Expert Reviewer should\
    \ ensure that the Package\n   does not introduce any additional security issues.\
    \  Requesters for\n   public Packages for a particular standards development organization\n\
    \   must be authorized by that organization to request a Package\n   registration.\n"

    \ that\n   identification of the IESG expert be done in consultation with the\n\
    \   ITU-T Question/Study Group responsible for the H.248 sub-series of\n   Recommendations\

- title: 5.2.  Package Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Package Registration Procedure\n   Package requesters are encouraged to\
    \ review their work against\n   H.248.1 Section 12 [H248amm1], \"Package Definition\"\
    , and are\n   encouraged to use the \"Package Definition Template\" provided in\n\
    \   H.248.1 Appendix II.\n   The process for registering a public Package is deemed\
    \ to be\n   \"specification required\" as per [RFC5226].  As such, once the initial\n\
    \   checks occur, Package requesters for public Packages under\n   development\
    \ shall send the Package text to IANA.  They are also\n   encouraged to send the\
    \ package to the ITU-T Question/Study Group\n   responsible for the H.248 sub-series\
    \ of Recommendations (ITU-T Q.3/16\n   at the time of writing) for review.  Updated\
    \ contact information can\n   be found in the latest version of the H.248 Sub-series\
    \ Implementors'\n   Guide.  This should occur as soon as practicable after the\
    \ rough\n   draft of the definition is completed and at least before the Package\n\
    \   is approved, in order to ensure the Package is consistent with H.248\n   methodologies\
    \ and Package-design principles.\n   In order to register private Packages, a\
    \ specification is not\n   required but is encouraged.\n   Package requesters\
    \ are encouraged to request registration as early as\n   practicable in the design\
    \ process, to reserve a binary ID.  Binary\n   IDs shall be published in the document\
    \ defining the Package.\n   Once the initial or final request for a Package registration\
    \ is\n   received by IANA, it will be forwarded to the IESG-appointed expert\n\
    \   for review.  During the review, the input Package and details will be\n  \
    \ compared to the Package template for completeness, as well as being\n   compared\
    \ against protocol syntax and procedures.  It will be compared\n   against existing\
    \ work to see that it does not duplicate existing\n   functionality.  It will\
    \ be reviewed to see that any potential\n   security issues are addressed.  The\
    \ Expert Reviewer will then work\n   towards a resolution of any issues with the\
    \ Package requester.  The\n   IESG-appointed expert may complete the review in\
    \ consultation with\n   other H.248 experts (i.e., currently Question 3 of ITU-T\
    \ Study Group\n   16 and via email to IETF MEGACO email list).  If the Package\
    \ is\n   deemed suitable, the IESG-appointed expert shall issue a statement\n\
    \   indicating approval, copied to IANA.\n   The IESG Expert Reviewer will ensure\
    \ the following considerations are\n   met to register a Package with the IANA:\n\
    \   1) A unique string name, unique serial number and version number are\n   \
    \   registered for each Package.  The string name is used as the\n      PackageID\
    \ for text encoding.  The serial number is used as the\n      PackageID for binary\
    \ encoding.  Public Packages MUST be given\n      serial numbers in the range\
    \ 0x0001 to 0x7fff.  Private Packages\n      MUST be given serial numbers in the\
    \ range 0x8000 to 0xffff.\n      Serial number 0 is reserved.  The unique string\
    \ name and unique\n      serial number MAY either be requested by the Package\
    \ requester or,\n      if not requested, assigned by the IANA.\n   2) The Package\
    \ requester shall provide a contact name and an email\n      and postal address\
    \ for that contact.  The contact information\n      shall be updated by the defining\
    \ organization as necessary.\n   3) The public Package requester shall provide\
    \ a reference to a\n      document that describes the Package, which should be\
    \ public:\n      a) The document shall specify the version of the Package that\
    \ it\n         describes.\n      b) If the document is public, it should be located\
    \ on a public web\n         server and should have a stable URL.  The site should\
    \ provide a\n         mechanism to provide comments and appropriate responses\
    \ should\n         be returned.\n      c) If the document is not public, it must\
    \ be made available for\n         review by the IESG-appointed expert (without\
    \ requiring a non-\n         disclosure agreement (NDA)) at the time of the application.\n\
    \      Note: The document does not have to be publicly available at the\n    \
    \  time of the registration request; however, the document shall be\n      provided\
    \ and available for review by the IESG-appointed expert.\n      Once approved\
    \ by a standards body, the Package SHOULD be made\n      publicly available, however\
    \ the Package MAY remain not public.\n      For private Packages, a contact email\
    \ address for the Package\n      registration shall be provided.\n   4) Packages\
    \ registered by other than recognized standards bodies\n      shall have a minimum\
    \ Package name length of 8 characters.\n   5) Package names are allocated on a\
    \ first-come, first-served basis if\n      all other conditions are met.\n   Status\
    \ - \"In Progress\" indicates that the Package has not been fully\n   reviewed\
    \ and approved and, therefore, may contain errors or may not\n   be consistent\
    \ with H.248 principles.  \"Final\" indicates that the\n   Package has been reviewed\
    \ and approved and is stable.  New Packages\n   shall be registered with a status\
    \ of \"IP\".  Once the Package has been\n   finalized (i.e., approved according\
    \ to the procedures of the Package\n   requester's organization), they should\
    \ contact IANA in order to\n   update the status to \"Final\".\n   Once the IESG-appointed\
    \ expert has determined that the registration\n   is appropriate, they will advise\
    \ the IANA to register the Package.\n   The IANA will assign a serial number to\
    \ each Package meeting the\n   conditions of registration (except for an update\
    \ of an existing\n   Package, which retains the serial number of the Package it\
    \ is\n   updating), in consecutive order of registration.\n"
