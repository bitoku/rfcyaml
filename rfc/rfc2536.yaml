- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global hierarchical replicated\n\
    \   distributed database system for Internet addressing, mail proxy, and\n   other\
    \ information. The DNS has been extended to include digital\n   signatures and\
    \ cryptographic keys as described in [RFC 2535].  Thus\n   the DNS can now be\
    \ secured and can be used for secure key\n   distribution.\n   This document describes\
    \ how to store US Government Digital Signature\n   Algorithm (DSA) keys and signatures\
    \ in the DNS.  Familiarity with the\n   US Digital Signature Algorithm is assumed\
    \ [Schneier].  Implementation\n   of DSA is mandatory for DNS security.\n"
- title: 2. DSA KEY Resource Records
  contents:
  - "2. DSA KEY Resource Records\n   DSA public keys are stored in the DNS as KEY\
    \ RRs using algorithm\n   number 3 [RFC 2535].  The structure of the algorithm\
    \ specific portion\n   of the RDATA part of this RR is as shown below.  These\
    \ fields, from Q\n   through Y are the \"public key\" part of the DSA KEY RR.\n\
    \   The period of key validity is not in the KEY RR but is indicated by\n   the\
    \ SIG RR(s) which signs and authenticates the KEY RR(s) at that\n   domain name.\n\
    \           Field     Size\n           -----     ----\n            T         1\
    \  octet\n            Q        20  octets\n            P        64 + T*8  octets\n\
    \            G        64 + T*8  octets\n            Y        64 + T*8  octets\n\
    \   As described in [FIPS 186] and [Schneier]: T is a key size parameter\n   chosen\
    \ such that 0 <= T <= 8.  (The meaning for algorithm 3 if the T\n   octet is greater\
    \ than 8 is reserved and the remainder of the RDATA\n   portion may have a different\
    \ format in that case.)  Q is a prime\n   number selected at key generation time\
    \ such that 2**159 < Q < 2**160\n   so Q is always 20 octets long and, as with\
    \ all other fields, is\n   stored in \"big-endian\" network order.  P, G, and\
    \ Y are calculated as\n   directed by the FIPS 186 key generation algorithm [Schneier].\
    \  P is\n   in the range 2**(511+64T) < P < 2**(512+64T) and so is 64 + 8*T\n\
    \   octets long.  G and Y are quantities modulus P and so can be up to\n   the\
    \ same length as P and are allocated fixed size fields with the\n   same number\
    \ of octets as P.\n   During the key generation process, a random number X must\
    \ be\n   generated such that 1 <= X <= Q-1.  X is the private key and is used\n\
    \   in the final step of public key generation where Y is computed as\n      \
    \       Y = G**X mod P\n"
- title: 3. DSA SIG Resource Records
  contents:
  - "3. DSA SIG Resource Records\n   The signature portion of the SIG RR RDATA area,\
    \ when using the US\n   Digital Signature Algorithm, is shown below with fields\
    \ in the order\n   they occur.  See [RFC 2535] for fields in the SIG RR RDATA\
    \ which\n   precede the signature itself.\n           Field     Size\n       \
    \    -----     ----\n            T         1 octet\n            R        20 octets\n\
    \            S        20 octets\n   The data signed is determined as specified\
    \ in [RFC 2535].  Then the\n   following steps are taken, as specified in [FIPS\
    \ 186], where Q, P, G,\n   and Y are as specified in the public key [Schneier]:\n\
    \           hash = SHA-1 ( data )\n           Generate a random K such that 0\
    \ < K < Q.\n           R = ( G**K mod P ) mod Q\n           S = ( K**(-1) * (hash\
    \ + X*R) ) mod Q\n   Since Q is 160 bits long, R and S can not be larger than\
    \ 20 octets,\n   which is the space allocated.\n   T is copied from the public\
    \ key.  It is not logically necessary in\n   the SIG but is present so that values\
    \ of T > 8 can more conveniently\n   be used as an escape for extended versions\
    \ of DSA or other algorithms\n   as later specified.\n"
- title: 4. Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Performance Considerations\n   General signature generation speeds are roughly\
    \ the same for RSA [RFC\n   2537] and DSA.  With sufficient pre-computation, signature\
    \ generation\n   with DSA is faster than RSA.  Key generation is also faster for\
    \ DSA.\n   However, signature verification is an order of magnitude slower than\n\
    \   RSA when the RSA public exponent is chosen to be small as is\n   recommended\
    \ for KEY RRs used in domain name system (DNS) data\n   authentication.\n   Current\
    \ DNS implementations are optimized for small transfers,\n   typically less than\
    \ 512 bytes including overhead.  While larger\n   transfers will perform correctly\
    \ and work is underway to make larger\n   transfers more efficient, it is still\
    \ advisable at this time to make\n   reasonable efforts to minimize the size of\
    \ KEY RR sets stored within\n   the DNS consistent with adequate security.  Keep\
    \ in mind that in a\n   secure zone, at least one authenticating SIG RR will also\
    \ be\n   returned.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Many of the general security consideration in\
    \ [RFC 2535] apply.  Keys\n   retrieved from the DNS should not be trusted unless\
    \ (1) they have\n   been securely obtained from a secure resolver or independently\n\
    \   verified by the user and (2) this secure resolver and secure\n   obtainment\
    \ or independent verification conform to security policies\n   acceptable to the\
    \ user.  As with all cryptographic algorithms,\n   evaluating the necessary strength\
    \ of the key is essential and\n   dependent on local policy.\n   The key size\
    \ limitation of a maximum of 1024 bits ( T = 8 ) in the\n   current DSA standard\
    \ may limit the security of DSA.  For particularly\n   critical applications,\
    \ implementors are encouraged to consider the\n   range of available algorithms\
    \ and key sizes.\n   DSA assumes the ability to frequently generate high quality\
    \ random\n   numbers.  See [RFC 1750] for guidance.  DSA is designed so that if\n\
    \   manipulated rather than random numbers are used, very high bandwidth\n   covert\
    \ channels are possible.  See [Schneier] and more recent\n   research.  The leakage\
    \ of an entire DSA private key in only two DSA\n   signatures has been demonstrated.\
    \  DSA provides security only if\n   trusted implementations, including trusted\
    \ random number generation,\n   are used.\n"
