  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher\n
    \  algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining Mode, with an explicit\n   Initialization
    Vector, as a confidentiality mechanism within the\n   context of the IPsec Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP).\n   Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic
    primitive by the\n   EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity
    and\n   Encryption) project [NESSIE] and was included in the list of\n   cryptographic
    techniques for Japanese e-Government systems that was\n   selected by the Japan
    CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research, Evaluation\n   Committees) [CRYPTREC].  Camellia
    has been submitted to several other\n   standardization bodies, such as ISO (ISO/IEC
    18033) and the IETF\n   S/MIME Mail Security Working Group [Camellia-CMS].\n   Camellia
    supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key\n   lengths, i.e.,
    the same interface specifications as the Advanced\n   Encryption Standard (AES)
    [AES].\n   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camillia\n
    \  was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in\n   2000.
    \ It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,\n   and it has
    been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.\n   Camellia is suitable
    for implementation in software and hardware,\n   offering encryption speed in
    software and hardware implementations\n   that is comparable to AES.\n   The Camellia
    homepage [Camellia-Web] contains a wealth of information\n   about camellia, including
    detailed specification, security analysis,\n   performance figures, reference
    implementation, test vectors, and\n   intellectual property information.\n   The
    remainder of this document specifies the use of Camellia within\n   the context
    of IPsec ESP.  For further information on how the various\n   pieces of ESP fit
    together to provide security services, please refer\n   to [ARCH], [ESP], and
    [ROAD].\n"

    title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  The Camellia Cipher Algorithm\n   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share
    common characteristics\n   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys,
    block size, and\n   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the
    relevant\n   characteristics of Camellia.\n   The algorithm specification and
    object identifiers are described in\n   [Camellia-Desc].\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Mode\n   NIST has defined five modes of operation for AES and other FIPS-\n
      \  approved ciphers [SP800-38a]: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), ECB\n   (Electronic
      CodeBook), CFB (Cipher FeedBack), OFB (Output FeedBack),\n   and CTR (Counter).
      \ The CBC mode is well defined and well understood\n   for symmetric ciphers,
      and it is currently required for all other ESP\n   ciphers.  This document specifies
      the use of the Camellia cipher in\n   CBC mode within ESP.  This mode requires
      an Initialization Vector\n   (IV) size that is the same as the block size.  Use
      of a randomly\n   generated IV prevents generation of identical cipher text
      from\n   packets that have identical data spanning the first block of the\n
      \  cipher algorithm's block size.\n   The CBC IV is XOR'd with the first plaintext
      block before it is\n   encrypted.  Then, for successive blocks, the previous
      cipher text\n   block is XOR'd with the current plain text before it is encrypted.\n
      \  More information on CBC mode can be obtained in [SP800-38a,\n   CRYPTO-S].\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Key Size\n   Camellia supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and
      256 bits.\n   The default key size is 128 bits, and all implementations MUST\n
      \  support this key size.  Implementations MAY also support key sizes of\n   192
      bits and 256 bits.\n   Camellia uses a different number of rounds for each of
      the defined\n   key sizes.  When a 128-bit key is used, implementations MUST
      use 18\n   rounds.  When a 192-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24\n
      \  rounds.  When a 256-bit key is used, implementations MUST use 24\n   rounds.\n"

    - "2.3.  Weak Keys\n   At the time of writing this document, there are no known
      weak keys\n   for Camellia.\n"
    title: 2.3.  Weak Keys
  - contents:
    - "2.4.  Block Size and Padding\n   Camellia uses a block size of sixteen octets
      (128 bits).\n   Padding is required by the algorithms to maintain a 16-octet\n
      \  (128-bit) block size.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in [ESP],\n   such
      that the data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad Length\n   and Next
      Header fields) is a multiple of 16 octets.\n   Because of the algorithm-specific
      padding requirement, no additional\n   padding is required to ensure that the
      ciphertext terminates on a\n   4-octet boundary.  That is, maintaining a 16-octet
      block size\n   guarantees that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will
      be\n   right-aligned within a 4-octet word).  Additional padding MAY be\n   included,
      as specified in [ESP], as long as the 16-octet block size\n   is maintained.\n"

      \  This web site also includes performance comparison with the AES\n   cipher
      and other AES finalists.  The NESSIE project [NESSIE] has\n   reported performance
      of Optimized Implementations independently.\n"

  - "3.  ESP Payload\n   The ESP payload is made up of the IV followed by raw cipher-text.\n
    \  Thus, the payload field, as defined in [ESP], is broken down\n   according
    to the following diagram:\n   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\n
    \  |                                                               |\n   +               Initialization
    Vector (16 octets)               +\n   |                                                               |\n
    \  +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\n   |                                                               |\n
    \  ~ Encrypted Payload (variable length, a multiple of 16 octets)  ~\n   |                                                               |\n
    \  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n   The IV
    field MUST be the same size as the block size of the cipher\n   algorithm being
    used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random, and MUST be\n   unpredictable.\n   Including
    the IV in each datagram ensures that each received datagram\n   can be decrypted,
    even when some datagrams are dropped or re-ordered\n   in transit.\n   To avoid
    CBC encryption of very similar plaintext blocks in different\n   packets, implementations
    MUST NOT use a counter or other low\n   Hamming-distance source for IVs.\n"

    to interaction with IKE\n   is the same as that of the AES cipher.  Details can

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Implementations are encouraged to use the largest
    key sizes they can,\n   taking into account performance considerations for their
    particular\n   hardware and software configuration.  Note that encryption\n   necessarily
    affects both sides of a secure channel, so such\n   consideration must take into
    account not only the client side, but\n   also the server.  However, a key size
    of 128 bits is considered\n   secure for the foreseeable future.\n   No security
    problem has been found on Camellia [CRYPTREC][NESSIE].\n"
