- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes how MPLS-PLDM [RFC6374] out-of-band\
    \ Responses\n   can be delivered to the querier using UDP/IP.\n   The use of UDP\
    \ may be required to support data-path management such\n   as passage through\
    \ firewalls or to provide the necessary multiplexing\n   needed in bistatic operation\
    \ where the querier and the collector are\n   not co-located and the collector\
    \ is gathering the Response\n   information for a number of responders.  In a\
    \ highly scaled system,\n   some MPLS-PLDM sessions may be off-loaded to a specific\
    \ node within\n   the distributed system that comprises the Label Switching Router\n\
    \   (LSR) as a whole.  In such systems, the Response may arrive via any\n   interface\
    \ in the LSR and needs to be forwarded internally to the\n   processor tasked\
    \ with handling the particular MPLS-PLDM measurement.\n   Currently, the MPLS-PLDM\
    \ protocol does not have any mechanism to\n   deliver the PLDM Response message\
    \ to a particular node within a\n   multi-CPU LSR.\n   The procedure described\
    \ in this specification describes how the\n   querier requests delivery of the\
    \ MPLS-PLDM Response over IP to a\n   dynamic UDP port.  It makes no other changes\
    \ to the protocol and thus\n   does not affect the case where the Response is\
    \ delivered over an MPLS\n   Associated Channel [RFC5586].\n"

- title: 3.  Solution Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   This document specifies that, unless configured otherwise,\
    \ if a UDP\n   Return Object (URO) is present in an MPLS-PLDM Query, the responder\n\
    \   SHOULD use the IP address and UDP port in the URO to reply back to\n   the\
    \ querier.  The querier MAY include multiple UROs in an MPLS-PLDM\n   Query indicating\
    \ to the responder that an identical Response SHOULD\n   be sent to each address-port\
    \ pair.  A responder MAY be designed or\n   configured to only transmit a single\
    \ Response, in which case the\n   Response MUST be sent using the parameters specified\
    \ in the first URO\n   in the Query packet that it is able to use (see Section\
    \ 4.3).\n   The procedures defined in this document may be applied to both\n \
    \  unidirectional and bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  In\n   this\
    \ document, the term \"bidirectional LSP\" includes the co-routed\n   bidirectional\
    \ LSP defined in [RFC3945] and the associated\n   bidirectional LSP that is constructed\
    \ from a pair of unidirectional\n   LSPs (one for each direction) that are associated\
    \ with one another at\n   the LSP's ingress/egress points [RFC5654].  The mechanisms\
    \ defined in\n   this document can apply to both IP/MPLS and to the MPLS Transport\n\
    \   Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5654] [RFC5921].\n"
- title: 3.1.  UDP Return Object
  contents:
  - "3.1.  UDP Return Object\n   The format of the UDP Return Object (URO) is as follows:\n\
    \       0                   1                   2                   3\n      \
    \ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \      | URO Type      | Length={6,18} |    UDP-Destination-Port       |\n   \
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n      ~\
    \                           Address                             ~\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   The Type and Length fields are each 8 bits long.  The Length field\n   indicates\
    \ the size in bytes of the remainder of the object (i.e., it\n   is the size of\
    \ the address in bytes plus 2).  When the address is\n   IPv4, the Length field\
    \ is thus 6; when the address is IPv6, the\n   Length field is thus 18.  The Length\
    \ field therefore acts as both the\n   TLV parsing parameter and the address family\
    \ type indicator.\n   The UDP Return Object Type (URO Type) has a value of 131.\n\
    \   The UDP-Destination-Port is a UDP destination port as specified in\n   [RFC768].\n\
    \   The Address is either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.\n   The URO MUST NOT appear\
    \ in a Response and MUST be ignored if it is\n   found to be present.\n   To prevent\
    \ any ambiguity as to which address the responder needs to\n   reply to, an MPLS-PLDM\
    \ Query message containing a URO MUST NOT\n   include an RFC 6374 Return Address\
    \ TLV (TLV 1).  Additionally, the\n   method of constructing the return address\
    \ from the Source Address TLV\n   (TLV 130) described in Section 3.5.2 of [RFC6374]\
    \ MUST NOT be used to\n   construct a Response to a Query message that contains\
    \ a URO.\n"
- title: 4.  Theory of Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Theory of Operation\n   This document defines the UDP Return Object to enable\
    \ the MPLS-PLDM\n   querier to specify the return path for the MPLS-PLDM reply\
    \ using UDP/\n   IP encapsulation.\n   When the MPLS-PLDM Response is requested\
    \ out-of-band by setting the\n   Control Code of the MPLS-PLDM Query to \"Out-of-band\
    \ Response\n   Requested\", and the URO is present, the responder SHOULD send\
    \ the\n   Response back to querier on the specified destination UDP port at the\n\
    \   specified destination IP address contained in the URO.\n   If the URO is expected\
    \ but is not present in a Query message and an\n   MPLS-PLDM Response is requested\
    \ out-of-band, the Query message MUST\n   NOT be processed further, and if possible,\
    \ an \"Error - Invalid\n   Message\" ([RFC6374], Section 3.1) SHOULD be sent to\
    \ the querier and\n   the operator notified via the management system (see Section\
    \ 4.2 for\n   further details).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Sending an MPLS-PLDM Query
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Sending an MPLS-PLDM Query\n   When sending an MPLS-PLDM Query message,\
    \ in addition to the rules and\n   procedures defined in [RFC6374], the Control\
    \ Code of the MPLS-PLDM\n   Query MUST be set to \"Out-of-band Response Requested\"\
    , and a URO MUST\n   be carried in the MPLS-PLDM Query message.\n   If the querier\
    \ uses the UDP port to de-multiplex the Response for a\n   different measurement\
    \ type, there MUST be a different UDP port for\n   each measurement type (delay,\
    \ loss, and delay-loss combined).\n   An implementation MAY use multiple UDP ports\
    \ for the same measurement\n   type to direct the Response to the correct management\
    \ process in the\n   LSR.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Receiving an MPLS-PLDM Query Request
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Receiving an MPLS-PLDM Query Request\n   The processing of MPLS-PLDM Query\
    \ messages as defined in [RFC6374]\n   applies in this document.  In addition,\
    \ when an MPLS-PLDM Query\n   message is received, with the Control Code of the\
    \ MPLS-PLDM Query set\n   to \"Out-of-band Response Requested\" with a URO present,\
    \ then the\n   responder SHOULD use that IP address and UDP port to send an MPLS-\n\
    \   PLDM Response back to the querier.\n   If an out-of-band Response is requested\
    \ and the URO is missing, the\n   Query SHOULD be dropped in the case of a unidirectional\
    \ LSP.  If the\n   TLV is missing on a bidirectional LSP, the Control Code of\
    \ the\n   Response message SHOULD set to 0x1C indicating \"Error - Invalid\n \
    \  Message\" ([RFC6374], Section 3.1), and the Response SHOULD be sent\n   over\
    \ the reverse LSP.  The receipt of such a malformed request SHOULD\n   be reported\
    \ to the operator through the management system, with\n   normal precautions taken\
    \ in respect to the prevention of overload of\n   the error-reporting system.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Sending an MPLS-PLDM Response
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Sending an MPLS-PLDM Response\n   As specified in [RFC6374], the MPLS-PLDM\
    \ Response can be sent either\n   over the reverse MPLS LSP for a bidirectional\
    \ LSP or over an IP path.\n   It MUST NOT be sent other than in Response to an\
    \ MPLS-PLDM Query\n   message.\n   When the requested return path is an IP forwarding\
    \ path and this\n   method is in use, the destination IP address and UDP port\
    \ are copied\n   from the URO.  The source IP address and the source UDP port\
    \ of the\n   Response packet are left to the discretion of the responder, subject\n\
    \   to the normal management and security considerations.  If the querier\n  \
    \ has included URO(s) for only one IP address family and a return path\n   of\
    \ that type is not available, then the Query message MUST be\n   discarded, and\

    \ packet per three\n   seconds need to ensure that the MPLS path being monitored\
    \ and any IP\n   path that may be used to carry the Response are provisioned such\
    \ that\n   there is a negligible chance of this protocol causing congestion.\n\
    \   Additionally, if a significant number of Response packets are lost,\n   the\
    \ querier MUST reduce the sending rate to a point where there is a\n   negligible\
    \ chance that this protocol is contributing to network\n   congestion.  The operator\
    \ should also take precautions that Response\n   packets do not leak out of the\
    \ network domain being used and cause\n   congestion elsewhere.  If a default\
