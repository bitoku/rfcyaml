  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)\n\
    \   [RFC4119] is an object format for carrying geographical information\n   on\
    \ the Internet.  PIDF-LO can contain civic address information and\n   supports\
    \ a range of \"civic address types\" (CAtypes) to hold the\n   individual attributes\
    \ of such addresses (see Section 2.2.1 of\n   [RFC4119] and Section 3.1 of [RFC5139]).\n\
    \   In many use cases, PIDF-LOs are populated with data from long-\n   established\
    \ sources, like postal and governmental building registers,\n   line information\
    \ databases and yellow/white pages of infrastructure\n   providers, or official\
    \ residents registers.  The structure and format\n   of data from such sources\
    \ is almost always different from PIDF-LO's\n   CAtypes definition -- additionally,\
    \ the structure and format of those\n   sources differ from country to country.\n\
    \   To make use of such existing data sources, transposing that data into\n  \
    \ PIDF-LO format is required.  With no guidelines available on how to\n   map\
    \ source Fields into CAtype Elements, different creators of PIDF-LO\n   documents\
    \ might end up with different results, even when using the\n   same data source,\
    \ which reduces interoperability and increases the\n   risk of misinterpretation\
    \ by recipients.\n   Therefore, civic address considerations are necessary to\
    \ ensure\n   uniform usage of PIDF-LO Elements for such data sources.  [RFC4776]\n\
    \   explicitly requests such documents to be provided, but defines\n   neither\
    \ their structure nor a way to publish them.  This memo\n   provides documentation\
    \ on how to create such civic address\n   considerations, and IANA has created\
    \ a registry to store references\n   to such documents.  Furthermore, civic address\
    \ considerations for\n   Austria are provided in Appendix A and have been registered\
    \ in the\n   IANA registry.\n   Section 3.4 of [RFC4776] contains some example\
    \ considerations\n   regarding the use of administrative subdivision Elements\
    \ for Canada,\n   Germany, Japan, Korea, and the United States.  This document\n\
    \   registers these examples with IANA as \"obsolete\" (see Section 6.3).\n  \
    \ Section 3.4 of [RFC4776] also contains instructions on the creation\n   of civic\
    \ address considerations documents on page 8.  This document\n   updates that\
    \ section and replaces said instructions with Sections 4\n   and 5 of this memo.\n\
    \   The guidelines in this document have been created with a focus on\n   formal\
    \ application of PIDF-LO (such as conveying location during an\n   emergency call).\
    \  It is not intended to forbid other, more informal\n   uses of PIDF-LO that\
    \ may not follow any formal mapping\n   specifications.  An example use case of\
    \ such informal usage may be\n   the transmission of PIDF-LO documents during\
    \ an instant-messaging\n   session between humans.  Such use may, however, imply\
    \ some drawbacks,\n   like prohibiting automatic processing of civic addresses\
    \ from such a\n   PIDF-LO.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In addition, this document uses \"Field\" to refer to a\
    \ field of a\n   civic address data source, and \"Element\" to refer to a CAtype\
    \ Element\n   of a PIDF-LO.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   The following requirements apply to defining civic-address\
    \ mapping\n   considerations:\n   o  The considerations document MUST identify\
    \ the data source to which\n      the definitions apply.  A brief description\
    \ of its structure\n      SHOULD be provided as well.\n   o  For any data source,\
    \ just one active mapping definition should\n      exist in order to reduce the\
    \ risk of ambiguous interpretation.\n   o  The document MUST include instructions\
    \ for any Field that occurs\n      in the data.  For any of the Fields, the document\
    \ MUST describe\n      whether the Field is required, optional, or must not be\
    \ used in\n      the mapping procedure.\n   o  Instructions MUST be included for\
    \ any CAtype Element that is\n      registered by the time the document is created.\
    \  Those\n      instructions MUST include information regarding whether an Element\n\
    \      is required, optional, or must not be used in that mapping.  In\n     \
    \ case the set of CAtypes is revised by the IETF, the address\n      considerations\
    \ document SHOULD be updated.  Until an update is\n      approved, the existing\
    \ mapping procedure MUST be used.\n   o  Address mapping procedures SHOULD be\
    \ reversible so that location\n      recipients can identify the corresponding\
    \ record in the original\n      data source (given they have access to that source).\n\
    \   o  For any source data Field that is required or optional, at least\n    \
    \  one example mapping MUST be provided.\n   o  In many cases, data sources used\
    \ in the mapping process might be\n      subject to access restrictions.  Such\
    \ restrictions (as imposed on\n      the original data) MUST also be imposed on\
    \ the resulting PIDF-LO\n      documents.  The considerations document SHOULD\
    \ note such\n      restrictions in its Security Considerations section.\n   Although\
    \ the mapping is defined in a national way and the actual\n   meaning of several\
    \ PIDF-LO Elements may not be clear to an outsider,\n   at least the country Element\
    \ tells in what context this PIDF-LO was\n   created.  In case of emergency calls,\
    \ a PIDF-LO would just be passed\n   to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)\
    \ in the same country as the\n   location generator anyway.  However, in a border\
    \ region there might\n   be exceptions and the PIDF-LO could be sent to a neighboring\
    \ country.\n   The PIDF-LO can still be passed on to a PSAP in the right country\n\
    \   (based on the country Element), or the PSAP might be aware of the\n   mapping\
    \ scheme used in the neighboring country.\n   A consistent mapping is also very\
    \ important for checking if two PIDF-\n   LO documents describe the same location.\
    \  When civic address Fields\n   are put into different PIDF-LO Elements, it may\
    \ be difficult to\n   identify whether or not two PIDF-LOs describe identical\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 4.  Specifying PIDF-LO Element Usage
  contents:
  - "4.  Specifying PIDF-LO Element Usage\n   The purpose of the civic address considerations\
    \ for an individual\n   data source is to create interoperability by specifying\
    \ a common list\n   of PIDF-LO Elements to be used and by defining the mapping\
    \ between\n   these Elements and the Fields of the respective data source.\n"
- title: 4.1.  General Considerations and Workflow
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Considerations and Workflow\n   The workflow for creating an address\
    \ considerations document is as\n   follows:\n   1.  Describe the data source\
    \ to which the address considerations\n       document applies.\n   2.  Identify\
    \ all Fields from the data source and decide, for each of\n       the Fields,\
    \ whether or not it is to be used for the purpose of\n       creating PIDF-LO\
    \ documents.  The considerations document must\n       list all Fields (or at\
    \ least state which Fields are considered in\n       the mapping and clearly state\
    \ that the other Fields MUST NOT be\n       used).\n   3.  For each of the Fields\
    \ that are required or optional, specify a\n       clear mapping instruction according\
    \ to the guidelines below.\n   4.  Provide a list of all CAtypes registered and\
    \ describe their level\n       of usage in this mapping (or combine it with the\
    \ list of Fields\n       above and clearly list which Elements are not used for\
    \ the\n       mapping procedure).  For Elements that are not described in\n  \
    \     detail, state whether they MUST NOT be used at all or whether\n       they\
    \ may be used without further restriction.\n   5.  Provide examples of source\
    \ data and mapping results.\n   Civic address Elements are designed to be generic\
    \ containers.  In\n   some cases, Fields clearly correspond to such a container;\
    \ however,\n   in some other cases, identifying the correct container might require\n\
    \   some approximation.  For example, in some countries the RD (road)\n   Element\
    \ might also be appropriate for other thoroughfares, like\n   waterways or tunnels.\n\
    \   Fields that are identified to have the same meaning as one of the\n   CAtypes\
    \ SHOULD be directly mapped to that CAtype Element.\n   Where CAtype usage diverges\
    \ from the original specification, the\n   mapping definition of Fields that are\
    \ mapped to that Element SHOULD\n   include a discussion of the differences.\n\
    \   Fields that do not fit into an existing CAtype:\n      Even though the list\
    \ of CAtypes could be extended, it is not\n      feasible to add new Elements\
    \ for every new Field in every data\n      source in every country.  Therefore,\
    \ unless new generic CAtypes\n      are specified by the IETF, only existing Elements\
    \ can be used,\n      which leaves the following options:\n      1.  Concatenate\
    \ several civic address Fields into a single PIDF-LO\n          Element (define\
    \ delimiters if applicable and make sure the\n          separate civic address\
    \ parts can be retrieved again).\n      2.  Use a PIDF-LO Element that is unused\
    \ so far.\n      Note: Obviously, the first option is required if the number of\n\
    \      Fields that are used in the mapping procedure is greater than the\n   \
    \   number of existing CAtype Elements.\n   Note that the xml:lang attribute should\
    \ be present in PIDF-LO XML\n   [W3C.REC-xml-20060816] documents, according to\
    \ RFC 5139.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Guidelines for Individual Elements
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Guidelines for Individual Elements\n   The following sections discuss individual\
    \ PIDF-LO Elements and\n   describe what to consider for each Element when defining\
    \ civic\n   address considerations.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow a similar\n \
    \  structure for considerations documents.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Country
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Country\n   The country Element must hold the alpha-2 codes from ISO\
    \ 3166-1\n   [ISO3166-1] in uppercase characters, as clarified in Section 3.3\
    \ of\n   RFC 5139 [RFC5139].\n   This Element cannot be redefined on a national\
    \ basis since it\n   identifies the country itself.  This Element is used to identify\n\
    \   which national mapping for civic addresses has been used in a\n   specific\
    \ PIDF-LO.\n   Example for Austria: <country>AT</country>\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Country Subdivisions A1-A6
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Country Subdivisions A1-A6\n   The Elements A1 to A6 are used to hold\
    \ national subdivision\n   identifiers, with A1 holding the top-level subdivision\
    \ identifier.\n   A1 may either contain the second part of ISO 3166-2 [ISO3166-2]\
    \ (see\n   Section 3.4 of RFC 5139 [RFC5139]) or other values as described in\n\
    \   the particular address considerations document.  Elements \"A2\" to\n   \"\
    A6\" may contain additional levels of subdivisions (see Section 2.2.1\n   of RFC\
    \ 4119).\n   For A1, an address considerations document MUST state whether ISO\n\
    \   3166-2 codes are to be used exclusively; alternatively, it should\n   define\
    \ a list of values to be used (for example, subdivision names).\n   In either\
    \ case, A1 MUST NOT be redefined for any other use than\n   describing top-level\
    \ subdivisions.\n   For each of the A2 - A6 Elements that are required or optional,\
    \ the\n   document SHOULD define the set of allowed values, either by listing\n\
    \   them or by referring to such a list.\n   Example for Austria:\n   A1 province\
    \ (Bundesland)\n   A2 political district (politischer Bezirk) name or identifier\n\
    \   A3 commune (Gemeinde) name or identifier\n   A4 village (Ortschaft) name or\
    \ identifier\n   A5 cadastral municipality (Katastralgemeinde) name or identifier\n\
    \   A6 must not be used.  For more details, see the example in Appendix\n   A.4.2.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Road and Street Names
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Road and Street Names\n   PIDF-LO contains the following Elements related\
    \ to road names: RD,\n   RDSEC, RDBR, RDSUBADDR, PRM, POM (Sections 3.1 and 3.2\
    \ of RFC 5139\n   [RFC5139]) and PRD, POD, STS (Sections 3.4 of [RFC4776]).  Note:\
    \ the\n   use of the A6 Element for street names is not valid any more (Section\n\
    \   3.2 of RFC 5139 [RFC5139]).\n   Besides the basic specification of which of\
    \ those Elements are\n   required, optional, or not to be used, an address considerations\n\
    \   document may also describe more complicated dependencies (for\n   example,\
    \ \"RD is optional, but required if any other road name Element\n   is used\"\
    ).\n   For any required or optional Element, the relation of those Elements\n\
    \   to Fields of the data source used MUST be described, as should\n   special\
    \ considerations (like concatenation of Fields into an\n   Element), if they apply.\
    \  The usage of the Element STS (street\n   suffix) SHOULD be consistent.  In\
    \ case no suffixes are known in a\n   data source, or it is common to write the\
    \ street name and the suffix\n   together, the STS Element SHOULD be left out\
    \ completely.  If suffixes\n   may be abbreviated, the common abbreviations SHOULD\
    \ be defined.\n   Example for Austria:\n   RD: street name\n   All other road\
    \ Elements must not be used.  Street suffixes are\n   already included in the\
    \ \"street name\" Field and must not be\n   abbreviated.\n"
- title: 4.2.4.  House Numbers
  contents:
  - "4.2.4.  House Numbers\n   PIDF-LO specifies two Elements related to house numbers:\
    \ HNO (\"house\n   number\", numeric part only) and HNS (\"house number suffix\"\
    ) (see\n   Section 3.4 of RFC 4776).  However, in many countries house numbers\n\
    \   have a more complex format.  In any case, a clear definition is\n   REQUIRED\
    \ to minimize the potential for confusion.\n   An address considerations document\
    \ should provide the following\n   information with regards to house numbers:\
    \ if the structure of house\n   numbers fits the HNO/HNS structure, the document\
    \ MUST mandate to use\n   those Elements as described in RFC 4776.  If the structure\
    \ of house\n   numbers does not directly fit into those two Elements, the document\n\
    \   MUST define strategies on how to map source Fields into Elements.\n   Besides\
    \ HNO and HNS, LOC and BLD could be considered for carrying\n   house number information.\n\
    \   The document SHOULD describe whether or not abbreviations of house\n   number\
    \ information is valid.  If abbreviations are used, they MUST be\n   clearly defined.\
    \  If house numbers consist of more than one number,\n   or if multiple prefixes\
    \ and suffixes may coexist, a delimiter symbol\n   and a clear rule on how to\
    \ concatenate all this data into the HNO and\n   HNS Element might be necessary.\
    \  Whenever concatenating data into one\n   Element, keep in mind that the location\
    \ recipient might want to\n   separate the data again.\n   Example from Austria:\n\
    \   HNO: concatenate all the data Fields of Austrian house numbers into\n    \
    \    this single PIDF-LO Element in a defined order with delimiter\n        symbols\
    \ (see Appendix A.4.4 for the complete definition).\n   HNS: usage not allowed\
    \ since there may be multiple suffixes for the\n        different parts of the\
    \ house number.\n   LOC and BLD are not to be used to reflect house number information.\n"
- title: 4.2.5.  Local Names
  contents:
  - "4.2.5.  Local Names\n   PIDF-LO contains three Elements to reflect local names:\
    \ LMK, LOC, and\n   NAM (Section 3.4 of RFC 4776).  Such local names may be of\
    \ importance\n   for the identification of a location and may either coexist with\
    \ a\n   valid civic address or (in some cases) have no address assigned, in\n\
    \   which case the local name, itself, identifies the location.  In rural\n  \
    \ regions, for example, a farm name may be more common than a street\n   address\
    \ to identify a location.  Landmarks typically don't have any\n   civic address\
    \ information assigned.  Therefore, local names may\n   assist in finding a \"\
    street name\" type address, but they might also\n   be the authoritative (and\
    \ only) civic location information.\n   For any required or optional Element out\
    \ of LMK, LOC, or NAM, the\n   considerations document should state potential\
    \ values (source data)\n   for the Element.  In the case that multiple values\
    \ for an Element may\n   occur, a concatenation/selection strategy should be described.\n\
    \   Concatenation using \";\" as a separator is recommended, unless this\n   character\
    \ also appears in the source Fields.\n   If local name information and \"common\"\
    \ address information is both\n   available and used, the document SHOULD discuss\
    \ the relationship\n   between those two address information types and the expected\
    \ behavior\n   of location recipients.\n   Example from Austria:\n   NAM: contains\
    \ the \"Vulgoname\" (local name); multiple local names are\n        separated\
    \ by a semicolon (if applicable).\n   LMK: contains the farm name (just one name\
    \ possible) (if applicable).\n   LOC: can be used without restriction for additional\
    \ location\n        information (as per RFC 4119).\n   The \"Vulgoname\" is useful\
    \ to identify the location within its\n   locality, since official addresses (especially\
    \ in rural regions)\n   might not be well known.\n"
- title: 4.2.6.  Floors
  contents:
  - "4.2.6.  Floors\n   PIDF-LO defines the Element FLR to hold floor information\
    \ but does\n   not further specify its content.  Section 2.1 of RFC 3825 provides\n\
    \   guidance about floor numbering but is not directly related to PIDF-\n   LO.\n\
    \   An address considerations document SHOULD clearly specify how to\n   express\
    \ floors using the FLR Element.  Following the above-mentioned\n   guidance is\
    \ RECOMMENDED; however, local nomenclature might require a\n   completely different\
    \ system.  The document SHOULD specify whether\n   only numbers, text, or both\
    \ are allowed in the FLR Element.  If there\n   are standard values for certain\
    \ floors, they SHOULD be listed.\n   Abbreviations SHOULD be avoided, unless they\
    \ are the primary (well-\n   known) way of identifying floors.\n   Example from\
    \ Austria:\n   If floor numbers are to be mapped, the FLR Element MUST be used.\n\
    \   Numbers and text are both allowed.  The first floor (<FLR>1</FLR>) is\n  \
    \ the first \"full\" floor above the floor at street level.  The floor at\n  \
    \ street level is <FLR>EG</FLR> or <FLR>0</FLR>.  There might be\n   intermediate\
    \ floors, especially between the floor at street level and\n   the \"first floor\"\
    .  Such intermediate floors have names like\n   \"Mezzanine\", \"Erster Halbstock\"\
    \ (\"first half floor\"), or \"Zweiter\n   Halbstock\" (\"second half floor\"\
    ), and have local meanings.\n"
- title: 4.2.7.  Address Codes
  contents:
  - "4.2.7.  Address Codes\n   Address codes are available in several countries in\
    \ different forms\n   (for estates, buildings, or usable units for example). \
    \ These codes\n   identify an address record and MAY be placed in the ADDCODE\
    \ Element\n   in PIDF-LO.  Address codes can help the location recipient to\n\
    \   determine the location and to identify the original record in the\n   data\
    \ source.  Depending on the type of code, the code alone (without\n   any other\
    \ Elements) may even be sufficient to fully identify an\n   address within a country.\n\
    \   In such cases, a PIDF-LO containing just the country and ADDCODE\n   Elements\
    \ might provide enough information to retrieve a civic\n   address, given the\
    \ location recipient has access to the respective\n   source database.\n   A civic\
    \ address considerations document SHOULD specify whether and in\n   which applications\
    \ the use of the ADDCODE Element is allowed.  If\n   ADDCODE is used, its relation\
    \ to the remaining Elements MUST be\n   clearly stated.  If several namespaces\
    \ for address codes exist in a\n   country, a mechanism to distinguish the different\
    \ code spaces MUST be\n   described.\n   Examples from Austria:\n   Statistik\
    \ Austria provides 4 codes: Adresscode (AdrCD), Adresssubcode\n   (AdrsubCD),\
    \ Objektnummer (ObjNr), and Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer\n   (NtzLnr).\n   The\
    \ following format SHOULD be used:\n        <ADDCODE>AdrCD=1234567;AdrsubCD=123;\n\
    \        ObjNr=2333211;NtzLnr=0001</ADDCODE>\n"
- title: 4.2.8.  Other Elements
  contents:
  - "4.2.8.  Other Elements\n   This section lists all PIDF-LO Elements that have\
    \ not been discussed\n   so far.\n   To specify the location inside a building,\
    \ the following Elements can\n   be useful:\n   o  UNIT\n   o  ROOM\n   o  SEAT\n\
    \   The following Elements are to be used for the representation of\n   postal\
    \ codes:\n   o  PC\n   o  PCN\n   o  POBOX\n   To describe the place-type or the\
    \ building, the following Elements\n   are available:\n   o  PLC - Place-type\
    \ (for allowed values, refer to the IANA registry\n      defined in [RFC4589])\n\
    \   o  BLD - Building (structure)\n   For any of those Elements that are required\
    \ or optional in a mapping,\n   the semantics of its contents must be described\
    \ if it differs from\n   the definition in the PIDF-LO base documents.\n   It\
    \ is RECOMMENDED that the Elements SEAT, UNIT, and ROOM remain to be\n   used\
    \ for identifying a location inside a building.  They MAY be used\n   by the owner\
    \ of the respective building if a considerations document\n   does not restrict\
    \ their use.  For example, an airport could decide to\n   place the gate number\
    \ in the UNIT Element and a location recipient\n   could identify that PIDF-LO\
    \ by the value of the PLC Element.  The\n   name of the airport could be placed\
    \ in NAM.\n"

    \         Table 3: Additional Civic Address Fields for Usable Units\n   Note:\
    \ \"floors\" in Austria (as in most parts of Europe) are counted\n   differently\
    \ compared to the US.  The \"1st floor\" in Austria is\n   actually the floor\
    \ above the floor at street level (2nd floor in US)\n   -- not considering the\
    \ fact that, in old buildings, there might be\n   even more floors between street\
    \ level and 1st floor, like \"mezzanine\"\n   and \"2nd mezzanine\".  So, an Austrian\
    \ \"1st floor\" could well be the\n   \"4th floor\" according to US nomenclature.\n\
    \   According to Statistik Austria [adrwarten], 81.5% of Austrian\n   addresses\
    \ are of the simple type Musterstrasse 1 (Musterstrasse is an\n   example street\
    \ name). 5% of all addresses have an additional\n   character, like Musterstrasse\
    \ 1b. 1% of Austrian addresses look like\n   Musterstrasse 21A - 23A.  For 8%\
    \ of addresses, an additional\n   separator is necessary -- like Musterstrasse\
    \ 10 Haus 1 Stiege 2, or\n   Musterstrasse 20 Gruppe A Reihe 1 Parzelle 13, or\
    \ Musterstrasse 30\n   Weg 1 Parzelle 10.  Very seldom, there are so-called special\n\
    \   addresses (0.03%) -- for example, Musterstrasse gegenueber 3A,\n   meaning\
    \ this address is actually opposite of house number 3A.  Rather\n   surprisingly,\
    \ 4.47% of Austrian addresses contain the identifier of\n   the estate since no\
    \ house number is assigned at all -- for example,\n   Musterstrasse GNR 1234,\
    \ or Musterstrasse GNR .12/4 Kirche (this type\n   of addresses is common for\
    \ churches), or a real example in Stockerau:\n   Kolomaniwoerth GNR 1583.  This\
    \ identifier is stored by Statistik\n   Austria as Hausnummerntext.  Otherwise,\
    \ one could misinterpret this\n   number as a house number, which would be definitely\
    \ wrong.\n"

- title: A.3.  Address Codes in Austria
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Address Codes in Austria\n   Statistik Austria registers 4 codes: Adresscode,\
    \ Adresssubcode,\n   Objektnummer, and the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  The Adresscode\
    \ (7\n   digits) is a unique code for an address in Austria.  The\n   Adressregister\
    \ maps the Adresscode to the civic address.  If there is\n   a building located\
    \ at an address, there is also an Adresssubcode (3\n   digits) assigned.  Every\
    \ building at an address has its own\n   Adresssubcode (assigned sequentially\
    \ starting with 001, 002, 003, and\n   so on) in order to distinguish between\
    \ buildings at the same address.\n   Furthermore, every building located in Austria\
    \ has its own unique\n   code, the Objektnummer (7 digits).  This code identifies\
    \ the building\n   independent of the Adresscode.  That's because addresses are\
    \ subject\n   to change while the building may persist.  To differentiate multiple\n\
    \   usable units inside a building, the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer (4\n   digits)\
    \ is used.  This code is also assigned in sequential order for\n   each building.\n\
    \   Besides, every address and building is geocoded by Statistik Austria.\n  \
    \ Hence, if every PIDF-LO would carry data in the format of Statistik\n   Austria\
    \ and if every PSAP would use the database of Statistik Austria\n   for mapping,\
    \ a time-saving, definite mapping without irregularities\n   could be achieved.\n\
    \   Besides these codes, Statistik Austria maintains reference numbers\n   for\
    \ communes, localities, or streets, to mention just a few.\n"

- title: A.4.4.  House Numbers
  contents:
  - "A.4.4.  House Numbers\n   Statistik Austria lists 14 data Fields related to the\
    \ house number of\n   a building plus another 5 Fields for distinction of different\
    \ usable\n   units inside a building (including the floor, which has a separate\n\
    \   Element in PIDF-LO).  Unfortunately, PIDF-LO only defines a single\n   house\
    \ number Element (HNO, numeric part only) and house number suffix\n   Element\
    \ (HNS).  Therefore, this section defines a mapping in order to\n   accommodate\
    \ all data: all house number data is concatenated into a\n   single HNO Element,\
    \ even though it is expected to hold numeric part\n   only.\n   In order to allow\
    \ automatic procession of the HNO Element, it is\n   necessary to use a semicolon\
    \ as a delimiter symbol (Austrian house\n   numbers do not contain semicolons).\
    \  The house number parts MUST be\n   provided in the order in which they are\
    \ listed by the Statistik\n   Austria document [merkmalskatalog].  For user-interface\n\
    \   representation, the semicolon-separated format can be transformed by\n   replacing\
    \ semicolons by spaces (multiple spaces should be combined)\n   and no space should\
    \ be present between a numeric part of a house\n   number and its related character.\n\
    \   It is not allowed to use the HNS Element for Austrian addresses,\n   since\
    \ there are addresses that do not have just a single suffix.\n   The house number\
    \ \"vor 1 - 1A\" (consisting of a house number text\n   \"vor\", first part of\
    \ the house number numeric \"1\", \"-\" as the link of\n   the first and Bis part,\
    \ \"1\" as house number Bis part numeric, \"A\" as\n   character of the Bis part)\

- title: A.4.7.  Additional Code Element
  contents:
  - "A.4.7.  Additional Code Element\n   The Element additional code may be used to\
    \ hold the codes provided by\n   Statistik Austria.  There is an Adresscode, Adresssubcode,\n\
    \   Objektnummer, and a Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  These unique codes\n   identify\
    \ the location.  Actually, these codes alone would be enough\n   but require that\
    \ the location recipient has access to the database of\n   Statistik Austria.\n\
    \   If the additional code in a PIDF-LO document is going to hold the\n   codes\
    \ from Statistik Austria, the following format should be used:\n   <ADDCODE>AdrCD=1234567;AdrsubCD=123;\n\
    \   ObjNr=2333211;NtzLnr=0001</ADDCODE>\n   It is not necessary to provide all\
    \ codes, but there are some\n   restrictions: the Adresssubcode cannot be used\
    \ without an Adresscode.\n   More restrictions are defined by Statistik Austria.\
    \  By setting the\n   country Element to AT (see Section 4.2.1), indicating an\
    \ Austrian\n   address, the Additional Code Element is expected to hold codes\
    \ from\n   Statistik Austria only.  When creating PIDF-LO documents using\n  \
