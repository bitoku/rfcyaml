  - "1.  Background\n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Virtual Circuit\n\
    \   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5885] defines the CV Types for\n   BFD\
    \ using VCCV, protocol operation, and the required packet\n   encapsulation formats.\
    \  This document extends those procedures and\n   CV Type values to enable Seamless\
    \ BFD (S-BFD) [RFC7880] operation\n   for VCCV.\n   The new S-BFD CV Types are\
    \ Pseudowire (PW) demultiplexer agnostic and\n   hence are applicable for both\
    \ MPLS and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol\n   version 3 (L2TPv3) PW demultiplexers.\
    \  This document concerns itself\n   with the S-BFD VCCV operation over Single-Segment\
    \ PWs (SS-PWs).  The\n   scope of this document is as follows:\n   o  This specification\
    \ describes procedures for S-BFD asynchronous\n      mode only.\n   o  S-BFD Echo\
    \ mode is outside the scope of this specification.\n   o  S-BFD operation for\
    \ fault detection and status signaling is\n      outside the scope of this specification.\n\
    \   This document specifies the use of a single S-BFD Discriminator per\n   PW.\
    \  There are cases where multiple S-BFD Discriminators per PW can\n   be useful.\
    \  One such case involves using different S-BFD\n   Discriminators per Flow within\
    \ a Flow-Aware Transport (FAT) PW\n   [RFC6391]; however, the mapping between\
    \ Flows and discriminators is a\n   prerequisite.  FAT PWs can be supported as\
    \ described in Section 7 of\n   [RFC6391], which details Operations, Administration,\
    \ and Maintenance\n   (OAM) considerations for FAT PWs.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.  S-BFD Connectivity Verification\n   The S-BFD protocol provides continuity\

  contents:

    \ using that\n   signaling protocol.  When static PWs are in use, the target\n\
    \   discriminator of S-BFD needs to be provisioned on the S-BFD\n   initiator\
    \ nodes.\n   All point-to-point PWs are bidirectional; the S-BFD reflector\n \
    \  therefore reflects the S-BFD packet back to the initiator using the\n   VCCV\
    \ channel of the reverse direction of the PW on which it was\n   received.\n \
    \  The reflector has enough information to reflect the S-BFD Async\n   packet\
    \ received by it back to the S-BFD initiator using the PW\n   context (e.g., fields\
    \ of the L2TPv3 headers).\n   The S-BFD reflector operation for BFD protocol fields\
