Baseline Privacy Interface Management Information Base for DOCSIS Compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems Status of this Memo
This memo provides information for the Internet community.
It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP  based (Simple Network Management Protocol) management of the Baseline Privacy Interface (BPI), which provides data privacy for DOCSIS 1.0
(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications)
compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
This MIB is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Radio Frequency Interface MIB, RFC 2670.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SMIv2
(Structure of Management Information Version 2).
The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
CableLabs requires the implementation of this MIB in DOCSIS 1.0 cable modems that implement the Baseline Privacy Interface, as a prerequisite for DOCSIS 1.0 certification.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [24].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification process.
A key used to derive a key encryption key (used to encrypt TEKs), and to derive message authentication keys.
When the CMTS communicates the authorization key to the CM, it encrypts the authorization key using the RSA public key of the CM [22].
Privacy Interface A term referring to the DOCSIS specification [18] for enabling simple data privacy in the DOCSIS 1.0 system.
Management of the BPI is the focus of this document.
BPI  Baseline Privacy Plus Interface
A term referring to the DOCSIS specification [21] for enabling CM authentication and data privacy in the DOCSIS 1.1 system.
Management of the BPI  is not addressed in this document.
CATV Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals to a community.
A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
CMTS Cable Modem Termination System
A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head end.
A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.
DOCSIS "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications".
A term referring to the ITU T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [19].
The direction from the head end towards the subscriber.
Head end The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video signals.
Generally also the location of the CMTS equipment.
MAC Packet A DOCSIS PDU. 2.11.
MCNS "Multimedia Cable Network System".
Generally replaced in usage by DOCSIS.
The SID identifies a particular upstream bandwidth allocation and class of service management for DOCSIS, and identifies a particular bidirectional security association for BPI.
Key Traffic Encryption Key, which is used for DES encryption of upstream and downstream traffic.
When the CMTS communicates the TEK to the CM, it encrypts the TEK using the key encryption key derived from the authorization key.
The direction from the subscriber towards the head end.
This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of the Baseline Privacy Interface for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).
This MIB specification is derived from the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Interface specification [18], which is an extension to the DOCSIS Radio Frequency Interface specification [19].
Please note that this MIB specification is not sufficient for the management of the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy Plus Interface specification [21].
The working group expects to issue a MIB for the management of BPI  at a later time.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [23].
This MIB consists of one group of CM only objects (docsBpiCmGroup), and one group of CMTS only objects (docsBpiCmtsGroup).
The CM only objects are organized into two tables:
The docsBpiCmBaseTable contains objects for managing basic Baseline Privacy parameters and counters, and for managing the Authorization finite state machine.
The docsBpiCmTEKTable contains objects for managing the Traffic Encryption Key (TEK
) finite state machine per SID.
The CMTS only objects are organized into four sub groups:
The docsBpiCmtsBaseTable contains objects for managing basic Baseline Privacy parameters and counters.
The docsBpiCmtsAuthTable contains objects for managing the Authorization association information per cable modem.
The docsBpiCmtsTEKTable contains objects for managing the TEK association information per SID.
The docsBpiMulticastControl consists of two tables.
The docsBpiIpMulticastMapTable controls the mapping of downstream IP multicast data traffic to downstream multicast SID values.
The docsBpiMulticastAuthTable controls which CMs are authorized to receive downstream traffic transmitted over particular multicast SIDs; a CM will receive TEKs corresponding to the multicast SIDs for which it is authorized.
The combination of these two tables will limit the distribution of downstream IP multicast data traffic to authorized CMs.
Management requirements The Baseline Privacy Interface specification is documented in [18], and is an extension to the Radio Frequency Interface specification documented in [19].
In addition to the explicit requirements in this specification, the CM and CMTS enabled for Baseline Privacy MUST support all applicable DOCSIS and IETF requirements and MIB objects.
Specifications that identify relevant requirements and MIB objects include the IETF Radio Frequency MIB [16], the IETF Cable Device MIB [17], and the DOCSIS OSSI Specification [20].
The explicit management requirements of the Baseline Privacy Interface, which motivate the development of the MIB in this document, are detailed below:  The CM and CMTS MUST support viewing relevant RSA public keys, for future subscriber authentication applications.
The Baseline Privacy management interface needs to support operator configuration of Authorization and TEK Finite State Machine (FSM) parameters, for performance tuning and security incident handling.
The CMTS MUST support viewing (and configuring if possible)
all FSM related parameters, including baseline privacy status (enabled or disabled), key lifetimes, key grace times, and state timeout values.
The CM MUST support viewing these parameters where possible.
The management interface needs to support operator analysis and override of FSM behavior, for fault management, subscriber service de provisioning, and security incident handling.
The CM MUST support viewing the current FSM states.
The CM and CMTS MUST support viewing message error codes and message error strings, and counters for invalid KEK and TEK events, for key expirations and renewals, and for duplicate messages.
The CM and CMTS MUST support viewing current authorization key sequence numbers and key expiration times for failure diagnosis.
The management interface needs to support dynamic control of the distribution of IP multicast data traffic.
This control includes forwarding IP multicast traffic to the correct multicast group (SID), and managing the membership lists of each multicast group (SID).
The CMTS MUST support configuring and viewing all IP multicast forwarding state, and all multicast group memberships, within the MAC domains of the CMTS.
Textual convention CableLabs has required the implementation of prior versions of this MIB in DOCSIS 1.0 cable modems that implement the Baseline Privacy Interface, as a prerequisite for DOCSIS 1.0 certification.
The Baseline Privacy Interface MIB contains eight MIB objects defined with the (now obsolete)
DisplayString textual convention, and one MIB object defined with the (now undesirable) IpAddress textual convention.
In the judgment of the working group, it is preferable to keep these less than desirable textual conventions, in order to maintain backward compatibility and interoperability with DOCSIS 1.0 cable modems that implemented previous versions of this MIB.

The Baseline Privacy Interface provides data encryption for DOCSIS data over cable services.
Baseline Privacy capable cable modems have RSA private/public key pairs installed by manufacturers.
The public key is used to encrypt an Authorization key, and the Authorization key is used to encrypt one or more Traffic Encryption Keys (TEKs).
The TEKs are used to encrypt both upstream and downstream data traffic.
Please refer to [18] to obtain further information on the Baseline Privacy specification.
In particular, the Baseline Privacy Interface does not provide an authentication service.
CMTS implementors are encouraged not to rely on the MAC address of the CM for service authorization   in particular, for the docsBpiMulticastAuthTable in this MIB.
The Baseline Privacy Plus Interface does provide a CM authentication service, and the working group expects to issue a MIB for the management of BPI  at a later time.
This MIB specification contains a number of read write objects, that should be protected from unauthorized modification to prevent denial of service and theft of service attacks: in particular, objects that reset state machines (ex. docsBpiCmAuthReset), change key lifetimes (ex. docsBpiCmtsDefaultAuthLifetime), change rekeying grace times (ex. docsBpiCmtsDefaultAuthGraceTime), and control multicast traffic (ex.
most objects in the docsBpiMulticastControl group).
The desired means to protect these objects from unwarranted access is to implement the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model [12] and the View based Access Control Model [15] is recommended.
Weaker methods to protect CMs from unauthorized access include using the docsDevNmAccessTable from the Cable Device MIB [17] to disallow configuration changes from unauthorized network management stations, and using the SNMP MIB Object and SNMP Write Access Control configuration file options from the Radio Frequency Interface [19] to set MIB object values and disable SNMP SET operations at cable modem boot time.
Note that these mechanisms may be vulnerable to an unauthorized network management station "spoofing" the source address of a legitimate network management station.
