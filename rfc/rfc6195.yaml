  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed\
    \ secure\n   hierarchical databases that store \"resource records\" (RRs) under\n\
    \   domain names.  DNS data is structured into CLASSes and zones that can\n  \
    \ be independently maintained.  Familiarity with  [RFC1034], [RFC1035],\n   [RFC2136],\
    \ [RFC2181], and [RFC4033] is assumed.\n   This document provides, either directly\
    \ or by reference, the general\n   IANA parameter assignment considerations that\
    \ apply across DNS query\n   and response headers and all RRs.  There may be additional\
    \ IANA\n   considerations that apply to only a particular RRTYPE or\n   query/response\
    \ OpCode.  See the specific RFC defining that RRTYPE or\n   query/response OpCode\
    \ for such considerations if they have been\n   defined, except for AFSDB RR considerations\
    \ [RFC1183], which are\n   included herein.  This RFC obsoletes [RFC5395]; however,\
    \ the only\n   significant change is the change to the public review mailing list\
    \ to\n   dnsext@ietf.org.\n   IANA currently maintains a web page of DNS parameters\
    \ available from\n   http://www.iana.org.\n"

    \   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so\n   they\
    \ can be matched.\n   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or\
    \ a response.\n   The AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful\n\
    \   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  However,\n  \
    \ some DNS implementations copy the query header as the initial value\n   of the\
    \ response header without clearing bits.  Thus, any attempt to\n   use a \"query\"\
    \ bit with a different meaning in a response or to define\n   a query meaning\
    \ for a \"response\" bit is dangerous, given existing\n   implementation.  Such\
    \ meanings may only be assigned by a Standards\n   Action.\n   The unsigned integer\
    \ fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count\n   (ANCOUNT), authority count (NSCOUNT),\
    \ and additional information\n   count (ARCOUNT) express the number of records\
    \ in each section for all\n   OpCodes except Update [RFC2136].  These fields have\
    \ the same\n   structure and data type for Update but are instead the counts for\
    \ the\n   zone (ZOCOUNT), prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT), and\n   additional\
    \ information (ARCOUNT) sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.  One Spare Bit?
  contents:
  - "2.1.  One Spare Bit?\n   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which\
    \ the Z bit being\n   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary\
    \ server for\n   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS\n   implementations\
    \ ignore this bit.\n   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires a Standards Action.\n"

- title: 2.3.  RCODE Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.3.  RCODE Assignment\n      It would appear from the DNS header above that\
    \ only four bits of\n      RCODE, or response/error code, are available.  However,\
    \ RCODEs can\n      appear not only at the top level of a DNS response but also\
    \ inside\n      OPT RRs [RFC2671], TSIG RRs [RFC2845], and TKEY RRs [RFC2930].\n\
    \      The OPT RR provides an 8-bit extension resulting in a 12-bit RCODE\n  \
    \    field, and the TSIG and TKEY RRs have a 16-bit RCODE field.\n      Error\
    \ codes appearing in the DNS header and in these three RR\n      types all refer\
    \ to the same error code space with the single\n      exception of error code\

    \ section processing,\n      provided such processing is optional.\n   After the\
    \ applicant posts their formal application with their\n   template as specified\
    \ in Appendix A, IANA appoints an Expert and the\n   template is posted, with\
    \ an indication that it is a formal\n   application, to the dnsext@ietf.org mailing\

    \   accepting or rejecting the application, to IANA, dnsext@ietf.org, and\n  \
    \ the email address provided by the applicant.  If the Expert does not\n   post\

    \ to monitor discussion of\n   the proposed RRTYPE, which may occur on the dnsext@ietf.org\
    \ mailing\n   list, and may consult with other technical experts as necessary.\
    \  The\n   Expert should normally reject any RRTYPE allocation request that\n\
    \   meets one or more of the following criteria:\n   1.  Was documented in a manner\
    \ that was not sufficiently clear to\n       evaluate or implement.\n   2.  The\
    \ proposed RRTYPE or RRTYPEs affect DNS processing and do not\n       meet the\
    \ criteria in point 2 of Section 3.1.1 above.\n   3.  The documentation of the\
    \ proposed RRTYPE or RRTYPEs is\n       incomplete.  (Additional documentation\
    \ can be provided during the\n       public comment period or by the Expert.)\n\
    \   4.  Application use as documented makes incorrect assumptions about\n    \
    \   DNS protocol behavior, such as wild cards, CNAME, DNAME, etc.\n   5.  An excessive\
    \ number of RRTYPE values is being requested when the\n       purpose could be\
    \ met with a smaller number or with Private Use\n       values.\n"

    \ IANA considerations are\n    specified in [RFC2671].  Its primary purpose is\
    \ to extend the\n    effective field size of various DNS fields including RCODE,\
    \ label\n    type, OpCode, flag bits, and RDATA size.  In particular, for\n  \

  contents:
  - "3.2.  RR CLASS IANA Considerations\n   There are currently two subcategories\
    \ of DNS CLASSes: normal, data-\n   containing classes and QCLASSes that are only\
    \ meaningful in queries\n   or updates.\n   DNS CLASSes have been little used\
    \ but constitute another dimension of\n   the DNS distributed database.  In particular,\
    \ there is no necessary\n   relationship between the name space or root servers\
    \ for one data\n   CLASS and those for another data CLASS.  The same DNS NAME\
    \ can have\n   completely different meanings in different CLASSes.  The label\
    \ types\n   are the same, and the null label is usable only as root in every\n\
    \   CLASS.  As global networking and DNS have evolved, the IN, or\n   Internet,\
    \ CLASS has dominated DNS use.\n   As yet, there has not been a requirement for\
    \ \"meta-CLASSes\".  That\n   would be a CLASS to designate transient data associated\
    \ with a\n   particular DNS message, which might be usable in queries.  However,\n\
    \   it is possible that there might be a future requirement for one or\n   more\
    \ \"meta-CLASSes\".\n   CLASSes have mnemonics that must be completely disjoint\
    \ from the\n   mnemonics used for RRTYPEs and that must match the following regular\n\

    \   shorten the wire encoding of NAMEs.\n   The two existing data label types\
    \ are sometimes referred to as Text\n   and Binary.  Text labels can, in fact,\
    \ include any octet value\n   including zero-value octets, but many current uses\
    \ involve only\n   [US-ASCII].  For retrieval, Text labels are defined to treat\
    \ ASCII\n   upper and lower case letter codes as matching [RFC4343].  Binary\n\
    \   labels are bit sequences [RFC2673].  The Binary label type is\n   Experimental\

    \ use.  The IN, or\n   Internet, CLASS is thus the only DNS CLASS in global use\
