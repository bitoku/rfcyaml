  - "1.  Introduction\n   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) are constructed\
    \ from\n   subsystems that include Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) links,\n\
    \   tunable transmitters and receivers, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop\n   Multiplexers\
    \ (ROADMs), wavelength converters, and electro-optical\n   network elements. \
    \ A WSON is a WDM-based optical network in which\n   switching is performed selectively\
    \ based on the center wavelength of\n   an optical signal.\n   WSONs can differ\
    \ from other types of GMPLS networks in that many\n   types of WSON nodes are\
    \ highly asymmetric with respect to their\n   switching capabilities, compatibility\
    \ of signal types and network\n   elements may need to be considered, and label\
    \ assignment can be non-\n   local.  In order to provision an optical connection\
    \ (an optical path)\n   through a WSON certain wavelength continuity and resource\n\
    \   availability constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal\n   paths\
    \ through the WSON.  The determination of paths is known as\n   Routing and Wavelength\
    \ Assignment (RWA).\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945]\
    \ includes\n   an architecture and a set of control plane protocols that can be\
    \ used\n   to operate data networks ranging from packet-switch-capable networks,\n\
    \   through those networks that use Time Division Multiplexing, to WDM\n   networks.\
    \  The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture [RFC4655]\n   defines functional\
    \ components that can be used to compute and suggest\n   appropriate paths in\
    \ connection-oriented traffic-engineered networks.\n   This document provides\
    \ a framework for applying the GMPLS\n   architecture and protocols [RFC3945]\
    \ and the PCE architecture\n   [RFC4655] to the control and operation of WSONs.\
    \  To aid in this\n   process, this document also provides an overview of the\
    \ subsystems\n   and processes that comprise WSONs and describes RWA so that the\n\
    \   information requirements, both static and dynamic, can be identified\n   to\
    \ explain how the information can be modeled for use by GMPLS and\n   PCE systems.\
    \  This work will facilitate the development of protocol\n   solution models and\
    \ protocol extensions within the GMPLS and PCE\n   protocol families.\n   Different\
    \ WSONs such as access, metro, and long haul may apply\n   different techniques\
    \ for dealing with optical impairments; hence,\n   this document does not address\
    \ optical impairments in any depth.\n   Note that this document focuses on the\
    \ generic properties of links,\n   switches, and path selection constraints that\
    \ occur in many types of\n   WSONs.  See [WSON-Imp] for more information on optical\
    \ impairments\n   and GMPLS.\n"

- title: 3.1.  WDM and CWDM Links
  contents:
  - "3.1.  WDM and CWDM Links\n   WDM and CWDM links run over optical fibers, and\
    \ optical fibers come\n   in a wide range of types that tend to be optimized for\
    \ various\n   applications.  Examples include access networks, metro, long haul,\n\
    \   and submarine links.  International Telecommunication Union -\n   Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector (ITU-T) standards exist for\n   various types of fibers.\
    \  Although fiber can be categorized into\n   Single-Mode Fibers (SMFs) and Multi-Mode\
    \ Fibers (MMFs), the latter\n   are typically used for short-reach campus and\
    \ premise applications.\n   SMFs are used for longer-reach applications and are\
    \ therefore the\n   primary concern of this document.  The following SMF types\
    \ are\n   typically encountered in optical networks:\n      ITU-T Standard | \
    \ Common Name\n      ------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \      G.652 [G.652]  |  Standard SMF                              |\n      G.653\

    \ dispersion shifted SMF  |\n      ------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Typically, WDM links operate in one or more of the approximately\n   defined\
    \ optical bands [G.Sup39]:\n      Band     Range (nm)     Common Name    Raw Bandwidth\
    \ (THz)\n      O-band   1260-1360      Original       17.5\n      E-band   1360-1460\

    \ Not all of a band may be usable; for example, in many fibers that\n   support\
    \ E-band, there is significant attenuation due to a water\n   absorption peak\
    \ at 1383 nm.  Hence, a discontinuous acceptable\n   wavelength range for a particular\
    \ link may be needed and is modeled.\n   Also, some systems will utilize more\
    \ than one band.  This is\n   particularly true for CWDM systems.\n   Current\
    \ technology subdivides the bandwidth capacity of fibers into\n   distinct channels\
    \ based on either wavelength or frequency.  There are\n   two standards covering\
    \ wavelengths and channel spacing.  ITU-T\n   Recommendation G.694.1, \"Spectral\
    \ grids for WDM applications: DWDM\n   frequency grid\" [G.694.1], describes a\
    \ DWDM grid defined in terms of\n   frequency grids of 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz,\
    \ 100 GHz, and other\n   multiples of 100 GHz around a 193.1 THz center frequency.\
    \  At the\n   narrowest channel spacing, this provides less than 4800 channels\n\
    \   across the O through U bands.  ITU-T Recommendation G.694.2,\n   \"Spectral\
    \ grids for WDM applications: CWDM wavelength grid\"\n   [G.694.2], describes\
    \ a CWDM grid defined in terms of wavelength\n   increments of 20 nm running from\
    \ 1271 nm to 1611 nm for 18 or so\n   channels.  The number of channels is significantly\
    \ smaller than the\n   32-bit GMPLS Label space defined for GMPLS (see [RFC3471]).\
    \  A label\n   representation for these ITU-T grids is given in [RFC6205] and\n\
    \   provides a common label format to be used in signaling optical paths.\n  \
    \ Further, these ITU-T grid-based labels can also be used to describe\n   WDM\
    \ links, ROADM ports, and wavelength converters for the purposes of\n   path selection.\n\
    \   Many WDM links are designed to take advantage of particular fiber\n   characteristics\
    \ or to try to avoid undesirable properties.  For\n   example, dispersion-shifted\
    \ SMF [G.653] was originally designed for\n   good long-distance performance in\
    \ single-channel systems; however,\n   putting WDM over this type of fiber requires\
    \ significant system\n   engineering and a fairly limited range of wavelengths.\
    \  Hence, the\n   following information is needed as parameters to perform basic,\n\
    \   impairment-unaware modeling of a WDM link:\n   o  Wavelength range(s): Given\
    \ a mapping between labels and the ITU-T\n      grids, each range could be expressed\
    \ in terms of a tuple,\n      (lambda1, lambda2) or (freq1, freq2), where the\
    \ lambdas or\n      frequencies can be represented by 32-bit integers.\n   o \
    \ Channel spacing: Currently, there are five channel spacings used\n      in DWDM\
    \ systems and a single channel spacing defined for CWDM\n      systems.\n   For\
    \ a particular link, this information is relatively static, as\n   changes to\
    \ these properties generally require hardware upgrades.\n   Such information may\
    \ be used locally during wavelength assignment via\n   signaling, similar to label\
    \ restrictions in MPLS, or used by a PCE in\n   providing combined RWA.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Optical Transmitters and Receivers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Optical Transmitters and Receivers\n   WDM optical systems make use of\
    \ optical transmitters and receivers\n   utilizing different wavelengths (frequencies).\
    \  Some transmitters are\n   manufactured for a specific wavelength of operation;\
    \ that is, the\n   manufactured frequency cannot be changed.  First introduced\
    \ to reduce\n   inventory costs, tunable optical transmitters and receivers are\n\
    \   deployed in some systems and allow flexibility in the wavelength used\n  \
    \ for optical transmission/reception.  Such tunable optics aid in path\n   selection.\n\
    \   Fundamental modeling parameters for optical transmitters and\n   receivers\
    \ from the control plane perspective are:\n   o  Tunable: Do the transmitters\
    \ and receivers operate at variable or\n      fixed wavelength?\n   o  Tuning\
    \ range: This is the frequency or wavelength range over which\n      the optics\
    \ can be tuned.  With the fixed mapping of labels to\n      lambdas as proposed\
    \ in [RFC6205], this can be expressed as a\n      tuple, (lambda1, lambda2) or\
    \ (freq1, freq2), where lambda1 and\n      lambda2 or freq1 and freq2 are the\
    \ labels representing the lower\n      and upper bounds in wavelength.\n   o \
    \ Tuning time: Tuning times highly depend on the technology used.\n      Thermal-drift-based\
    \ tuning may take seconds to stabilize, whilst\n      electronic tuning might\
    \ provide sub-ms tuning times.  Depending on\n      the application, this might\
    \ be critical.  For example, thermal\n      drift might not be usable for fast\
    \ protection applications.\n   o  Spectral characteristics and stability: The\
    \ spectral shape of a\n      laser's emissions and its frequency stability put\
    \ limits on\n      various properties of the overall WDM system.  One constraint\
    \ that\n      is relatively easy to characterize is the closest channel spacing\n\
    \      with which the transmitter can be used.\n   Note that ITU-T recommendations\
    \ specify many aspects of an optical\n   transmitter.  Many of these parameters,\
    \ such as spectral\n   characteristics and stability, are used in the design of\
    \ WDM\n   subsystems consisting of transmitters, WDM links, and receivers.\n \
    \  However, they do not furnish additional information that will\n   influence\
    \ the Label Switched Path (LSP) provisioning in a properly\n   designed system.\n\
    \   Also, note that optical components can degrade and fail over time.\n   This\
    \ presents the possibility of the failure of an LSP (optical path)\n   without\
    \ either a node or link failure.  Hence, additional mechanisms\n   may be necessary\
    \ to detect and differentiate this failure from the\n   others; for example, one\
    \ does not want to initiate mesh restoration\n   if the source transmitter has\
    \ failed since the optical transmitter\n   will still be failed on the alternate\
    \ optical path.\n"

    \ [G.698.2], and\n   [G.959.1] all use the concept of an optical tributary signal,\
    \ which\n   is defined as \"a single channel signal that is placed within an\n\
    \   optical channel for transport across the optical network\".  Note the\n  \
    \ use of the qualifier \"tributary\" to indicate that this is a single-\n   channel\
    \ entity and not a multi-channel optical signal.\n   There are currently a number\
    \ of different types of optical tributary\n   signals, which are known as \"optical\
    \ tributary signal classes\".\n   These are currently characterized by a modulation\
    \ format and bitrate\n   range [G.959.1]:\n   (a)  Optical tributary signal class\

    \   Note that, with advances in technology, more optical tributary signal\n  \
    \ classes may be added and that this is currently an active area for\n   development\
    \ and standardization.  In particular, at the 40G rate,\n   there are a number\

    \ specify the bitrate\n   of the optical tributary signal.  Hence, modulation\

    \ ROADM\n   The key feature across all ROADM types is their highly asymmetric\n\
    \   switching capability.  In the ROADM of Figure 1, signals introduced\n   via\
    \ the add ports can only be sent on the line side output port and\n   not on any\
    \ of the drop ports.  The term \"degree\" is used to refer to\n   the number of\
    \ line side ports (input and output) of a ROADM and does\n   not include the number\
    \ of \"add\" or \"drop\" ports.  The add and drop\n   ports are sometimes also\
    \ called tributary ports.  As the degree of\n   the ROADM increases beyond two,\
    \ it can have properties of both a\n   switch (OXC) and a multiplexer; hence,\
    \ it is necessary to know the\n   switched connectivity offered by such a network\
    \ element to\n   effectively utilize it.  A straightforward way to represent this\
    \ is\n   via a \"switched connectivity\" matrix A where Amn = 0 or 1, depending\n\
    \   upon whether a wavelength on input port m can be connected to output\n   port\
    \ n [Imajuku].  For the ROADM shown in Figure 1, the switched\n   connectivity\
    \ matrix can be expressed as:\n             Input    Output Port\n           \
    \  Port     #1 #2 #3 #4 #5\n                      --------------\n           \

    \  Single wavelength, fixed lambda port\n   o  Multiple wavelengths, reduced range\
    \ port (for example wave band\n      switching)\n   To model these restrictions,\

    \ not a specific bitrate).\n   Finally, 3R regenerators apply to a single channel,\
    \ are dependent\n   upon the modulation format, and are generally sensitive to\
    \ the\n   bitrate of digital signal, i.e., either are designed to only handle\
    \ a\n   specific bitrate or need to be programmed to accept and regenerate a\n\
    \   specific bitrate.  In all these types of regenerators, the digital\n   bitstream\

    \   Table 2 shows that frame alignment, signal identification, and FEC\n   are\
    \ supported.  By omission, Table 2 also shows that no switching or\n   multiplexing\
    \ occurs at this layer.  This is a significant\n   simplification for the control\
    \ plane since control plane standards\n   require a multi-layer approach when\
    \ there are multiple switching\n   layers but do not require the \"layering\"\
    \ to provide the management\n   functions shown in Table 2.  That is, many existing\
    \ technologies\n   covered by GMPLS contain extra management-related layers that\
    \ are\n   essentially ignored by the control plane (though not by the\n   management\
    \ plane).  Hence, the approach here is to include\n   regenerators and other devices\
    \ at the WSON layer unless they provide\n   higher layer switching; then, a multi-layer\
    \ or multi-region approach\n   [RFC5212] is called for.  However, this can result\
    \ in regenerators\n   having a dependence on the client signal type.\n   Hence,\
    \ depending upon the regenerator technology, the constraints\n   listed in Table\
    \ 3 may be imposed by a regenerator device:\n     Table 3.  Regenerator Compatibility\

- title: 3.6.  Wavelength Converters
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Wavelength Converters\n   Wavelength converters take an input optical signal\
    \ at one wavelength\n   and emit an equivalent content optical signal at another\
    \ wavelength\n   on output.  There are multiple approaches to building wavelength\n\
    \   converters.  One approach is based on OEO conversion with fixed or\n   tunable\
    \ optics on output.  This approach can be dependent upon the\n   signal rate and\
    \ format; that is, this is basically an electrical\n   regenerator combined with\
    \ a laser/receiver.  Hence, this type of\n   wavelength converter has signal-processing\
    \ restrictions that are\n   essentially the same as those described for regenerators\
    \ in Table 3\n   of Section 3.5.1.\n   Another approach performs the wavelength\
    \ conversion optically via\n   non-linear optical effects, similar in spirit to\
    \ the familiar\n   frequency mixing used in radio frequency systems but significantly\n\
    \   harder to implement.  Such processes/effects may place limits on the\n   range\
    \ of achievable conversion.  These may depend on the wavelength\n   of the input\
    \ signal and the properties of the converter as opposed to\n   only the properties\
    \ of the converter in the OEO case.  Different WSON\n   system designs may choose\
    \ to utilize this component to varying\n   degrees or not at all.\n   Current\
    \ or envisioned contexts for wavelength converters are:\n   1.  Wavelength conversion\
    \ associated with OEO switches and fixed or\n       tunable optics.  In this case,\
    \ there are typically multiple\n       converters available since each use of\
    \ an OEO switch can be\n       thought of as a potential wavelength converter.\n\
    \   2.  Wavelength conversion associated with ROADMs/OXCs.  In this case,\n  \
    \     there may be a limited pool of wavelength converters available.\n      \
    \ Conversion could be either all optical or via an OEO method.\n   3.  Wavelength\
    \ conversion associated with fixed devices such as\n       FOADMs.  In this case,\
    \ there may be a limited amount of\n       conversion.  Also, the conversion may\
    \ be used as part of optical\n       path routing.\n   Based on the above considerations,\
    \ wavelength converters are modeled\n   as follows:\n   1.  Wavelength converters\
    \ can always be modeled as associated with\n       network elements.  This includes\
    \ fixed wavelength routing\n       elements.\n   2.  A network element may have\
    \ full wavelength conversion capability\n       (i.e., any input port and wavelength)\
    \ or a limited number of\n       wavelengths and ports.  On a box with a limited\
    \ number of\n       converters, there also may exist restrictions on which ports\
    \ can\n       reach the converters.  Hence, regardless of where the converters\n\
    \       actually are, they can be associated with input ports.\n   3.  Wavelength\
    \ converters have range restrictions that are either\n       independent or dependent\
    \ upon the input wavelength.\n   In WSONs where wavelength converters are sparse,\
    \ an optical path may\n   appear to loop or \"backtrack\" upon itself in order\
    \ to reach a\n   wavelength converter prior to continuing on to its destination.\
    \  The\n   lambda used on input to the wavelength converter would be different\n\
    \   from the lambda coming back from the wavelength converter.\n   A model for\
    \ an individual OEO wavelength converter would consist of:\n   o  Input lambda\
    \ or frequency range\n   o  Output lambda or frequency range\n"
- title: 3.6.1.  Wavelength Converter Pool Modeling
  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  Wavelength Converter Pool Modeling\n   A WSON node may include multiple\
    \ wavelength converters.  These are\n   usually arranged into some type of pool\
    \ to promote resource sharing.\n   There are a number of different approaches\
    \ used in the design of\n   switches with converter pools.  However, from the\
    \ point of view of\n   path computation, it is necessary to know the following:\n\
    \   1.  The nodes that support wavelength conversion\n   2.  The accessibility\
    \ and availability of a wavelength converter to\n       convert from a given input\
    \ wavelength on a particular input port\n       to a desired output wavelength\
    \ on a particular output port\n   3.  Limitations on the types of signals that\
    \ can be converted and the\n       conversions that can be performed\n   To model\
    \ point 2 above, a technique similar to that used to model\n   ROADMs and optical\
    \ switches can be used, i.e., matrices to indicate\n   possible connectivity along\
    \ with wavelength constraints for\n   links/ports.  Since wavelength converters\
    \ are considered a scarce\n   resource, it is desirable to include, at a minimum,\
    \ the usage state\n   of individual wavelength converters in the pool.\n   A three\
    \ stage model is used as shown schematically in Figure 3.  This\n   model represents\
    \ N input ports (fibers), P wavelength converters, and\n   M output ports (fibers).\
    \  Since not all input ports can necessarily\n   reach the converter pool, the\
    \ model starts with a wavelength pool\n   input matrix WI(i,p) = {0,1}, where\
    \ input port i can potentially\n   reach wavelength converter p.\n   Since not\
    \ all wavelengths can necessarily reach all the converters or\n   the converters\
    \ may have a limited input wavelength range, there is a\n   set of input port\
    \ constraints for each wavelength converter.\n   Currently, it is assumed that\
    \ a wavelength converter can only take a\n   single wavelength on input.  Each\
    \ wavelength converter input port\n   constraint can be modeled via a wavelength\
    \ set mechanism.\n   Next, there is a state vector WC(j) = {0,1} dependent upon\
    \ whether\n   wavelength converter j in the pool is in use.  This is the only\
    \ state\n   kept in the converter pool model.  This state is not necessary for\n\
    \   modeling \"fixed\" transponder system, i.e., systems where there is no\n \
    \  sharing.  In addition, this state information may be encoded in a\n   much\
    \ more compact form depending on the overall connectivity\n   structure [Gen-Encode].\n\
    \   After that, a set of wavelength converter output wavelength\n   constraints\
    \ is used.  These constraints indicate what wavelengths a\n   particular wavelength\
    \ converter can generate or are restricted to\n   generating due to internal switch\
    \ structure.\n   Finally, a wavelength pool output matrix WE(p,k) = {0,1} indicates\n\
    \   whether the output from wavelength converter p can reach output port\n   k.\
    \  Examples of this method being used to model wavelength converter\n   pools\
    \ for several switch architectures are given in [Gen-Encode].\n      I1   +-------------+\

    \ locking circuitry.  To account for these different cases, item 5 has\n   been\
    \ added, which describes the device's configurability.\n   Note that such input\

  contents:
  - "4.  Routing and Wavelength Assignment and the Control Plane\n   From a control\
    \ plane perspective, a wavelength-convertible network\n   with full wavelength-conversion\
    \ capability at each node can be\n   controlled much like a packet MPLS-labeled\
    \ network or a circuit-\n   switched Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) network\
    \ with full-time slot\n   interchange capability is controlled.  In this case,\
    \ the path\n   selection process needs to identify the Traffic Engineered (TE)\
    \ links\n   to be used by an optical path, and wavelength assignment can be made\n\
    \   on a hop-by-hop basis.\n   However, in the case of an optical network without\
    \ wavelength\n   converters, an optical path needs to be routed from source to\n\
    \   destination and must use a single wavelength that is available along\n   that\
    \ path without \"colliding\" with a wavelength used by any other\n   optical path\
    \ that may share an optical fiber.  This is sometimes\n   referred to as a \"\
    wavelength continuity constraint\".\n   In the general case of limited or no wavelength\
    \ converters, the\n   computation of both the links and wavelengths is known as\
    \ RWA.\n   The inputs to basic RWA are the requested optical path's source and\n\
    \   destination, the network topology, the locations and capabilities of\n   any\
    \ wavelength converters, and the wavelengths available on each\n   optical link.\
    \  The output from an algorithm providing RWA is an\n   explicit route through\
    \ ROADMs, a wavelength for optical transmitter,\n   and a set of locations (generally\
    \ associated with ROADMs or switches)\n   where wavelength conversion is to occur\
    \ and the new wavelength to be\n   used on each component link after that point\
    \ in the route.\n   It is to be noted that the choice of a specific RWA algorithm\
    \ is out\n   of the scope of this document.  However, there are a number of\n\

    \ of a\n   list of potential wavelengths used to ensure conformance with the\n\
    \   wavelength continuity constraint.\n   As currently specified, the GMPLS protocol\
    \ suite signaling protocol\n   can accommodate such an approach.  GMPLS, per [RFC3471],\
    \ includes\n   support for the communication of the set of labels (wavelengths)\
    \ that\n   may be used between nodes via a Label Set.  When conversion is not\n\
    \   performed at an intermediate node, a hop generates the Label Set it\n   sends\
    \ to the next hop based on the intersection of the Label Set\n   received from\
    \ the previous hop and the wavelengths available on the\n   node's switch and\
    \ ongoing interface.  The generation of the outgoing\n   Label Set is up to the\
    \ node local policy (even if one expects a\n   consistent policy configuration\
    \ throughout a given transparency\n   domain).  When wavelength conversion is\
    \ performed at an intermediate\n   node, a new Label Set is generated.  The egress\
    \ node selects one\n   label in the Label Set that it received; additionally,\
    \ the node can\n   apply local policy during label selection.  GMPLS also provides\n\
    \   support for the signaling of bidirectional optical paths.\n   Depending on\
    \ these policies, a wavelength assignment may not be\n   found, or one may be\
    \ found that consumes too many conversion\n   resources relative to what a dedicated\
    \ wavelength assignment policy\n   would have achieved.  Hence, this approach\
    \ may generate higher\n   blocking probabilities in a heavily loaded network.\n\
    \   This solution may be facilitated via signaling extensions that ease\n   its\
    \ functioning and possibly enhance its performance with respect to\n   blocking\
    \ probability.  Note that this approach requires less\n   information dissemination\
    \ than the other techniques described.\n   The first entity may be a PCE or the\

    \ viewed as\n   either relatively static, i.e., changing with hardware changes\n\
    \   (including possibly failures), or relatively dynamic, i.e., those\n   that\
    \ can change with optical path provisioning.  The time requirement\n   in which\

    \ and is\n   not optional; that is, all signals traversing the link or node will\n\
    \   be regenerated.  This includes OEO switches since they provide\n   regeneration\
    \ on every port.\n   There may be input constraints and output constraints on\
    \ the\n   regenerators.  Hence, the path selection process will need to know\n\
    \   the regenerator constraints from routing or other means so that it\n   can\
    \ choose a compatible path.  For impairment-aware routing and\n   wavelength assignment\
    \ (IA-RWA), the path selection process will also\n   need to know which links/nodes\
    \ provide regeneration.  Even for\n   \"regular\" RWA, this regeneration information\
    \ is useful since\n   wavelength converters typically perform regeneration, and\
    \ the\n   wavelength continuity constraint can be relaxed at such a point.\n \

    \ are occupied if a combined RWA\n   process or separate WA process is run as\
    \ discussed in Sections 4.1.1\n   and 4.1.2.  This is currently not possible with\
    \ GMPLS routing.\n   In the routing extensions for GMPLS [RFC4202], requirements\
