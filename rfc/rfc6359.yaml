  - "Abstract\n   This document captures the requirements for integrating IANA and\
    \ RFC\n   Editor state information into the Datatracker to provide the\n   community\
    \ with a unified tool to track the status of their document\n   as it progresses\
    \ from Internet-Draft (I-D) version -00 to RFC.\n   Extending the Datatracker\
    \ to hold document data from I-D version -00\n   to RFC allows for increased automation\
    \ between the Datatracker, IANA,\n   and RFC Editor, thus reducing manual labor,\
    \ processing errors, and\n   potential delay.  Therefore, this document also describes\
    \ the\n   requirements to make such automation possible.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Datatracker is a web-based system for managing\
    \ information\n   about Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs, IPR disclosures, liaison\n\
    \   statements, and several other important aspects of the document\n   process\
    \ [IDTRACKER].  In this document, the term \"IETF Datatracker\"\n   is used as\
    \ a generic name for the existing tool used to track state\n   changes as Internet-Drafts\
    \ are processed.  The word \"IETF\" in the\n   name \"IETF Datatracker\" is not\
    \ meant to limit use of the tool to the\n   IETF document stream; this document\
    \ expands use of the tool to the\n   other streams described in [RFC4844].\n \
    \  The Datatracker is used to report on the status of I-Ds that have\n   been\
    \ submitted to the IESG for evaluation and publication.  The\n   Datatracker will\
    \ be extended, according to the requirements defined\n   in [RFC6174] and [RFC6322],\
    \ to include tracking information about a\n   document during its progression\
    \ from version -00 to it being\n   requested for IESG evaluation.  However, the\
    \ Datatracker, ICANN\n   (performing the IANA function), and RFC Editor operate\
    \ on separate\n   systems with varying degrees of visibility into the processing\
    \ that\n   takes place once the stream managers have approved a document for\n\
    \   publication as an RFC.  This document defines the requirements for\n   extending\
    \ the Datatracker to include increased IANA and RFC Editor\n   state information,\
    \ so that the Datatracker covers the lifetime of an\n   I-D from version -00 to\
    \ RFC publication.\n   Additionally, this document lists the processes between\
    \ the IANA, RFC\n   Editor, and Secretariat (via the Datatracker) that should\
    \ be\n   automated for accuracy and timely processing.  While this document\n\
    \   includes some details of the IANA, RFC Editor, and Secretariat\n   process,\
    \ this document does not define any of the processes.  The\n   processes are continually\
    \ reviewed for process optimization and need\n   to remain flexible to adapt to\
    \ new changes in policy and environment.\n   Processes are defined and set by\
    \ each of the entities respectively.\n   The IANA and RFC Editor are functions\
    \ independent of the IETF.  When\n   an Internet-Draft enters the IANA queue,\
    \ IANA retains ownership of\n   its own data, state names, and tracking systems.\
    \  Similarly, when an\n   Internet-Draft enters the RFC Editor's queue, the RFC\
    \ Editor retains\n   ownership of its own data, state names, and tracking systems.\
    \  This\n   document discusses how the data from the IANA and RFC Editor queues\n\
    \   can be better reflected in the Datatracker to help inform the IETF\n   community\
    \ what the state of a document is throughout its lifetime.\n   Prior to when an\
    \ Internet-Draft is approved for publication as an\n   RFC, the Datatracker is\
    \ the definitive source for tracking IANA\n   status information, and the IANA\
    \ data is editable (by IANA and the\n   Secretariat) in the Datatracker.  After\
    \ an Internet-Draft is approved\n   for publication as an RFC, the IANA tracking\
    \ system becomes the\n   definitive source for tracking IANA status information,\
    \ and the data\n   can no longer be edited in the Datatracker.  At that point,\
    \ the data\n   in the Datatracker is only a reflection of the data in the IANA\n\
    \   tracking system.  If there is a discrepancy between the two after\n   this\
    \ point, the data in the IANA tracking system is assumed to be\n   correct.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor's tracking system is always the definitive source for\n   tracking\
    \ the RFC Editor status of a document.  RFC Editor data is not\n   editable via\
    \ the Datatracker.  The information in the Datatracker is\n   always a reflection\
    \ of the information in the RFC Editor's tracking\n   system.\n"

- title: 2.1.  IANA Information to Be Added to the Datatracker
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IANA Information to Be Added to the Datatracker\n   Currently, IANA reviews\
    \ and touches IETF stream documents at 4\n   different stages in the process from\
    \ I-D to RFC: IETF Last Call, IESG\n   Review, Document Approval (for publication),\
    \ and RFC Publication.\n   Most of these state changes and issues are not captured\
    \ in the\n   Datatracker.  For the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force) and\n \
    \  Independent streams, the IANA review process begins when IESG Review\n   is\
    \ requested.  For the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) stream,\n   review would\
    \ begin upon request for publication as an RFC.\n   This section specifies the\
    \ requirements for including additional IANA\n   information in the Datatracker.\n\
    \   -  IETF Last Call Comments\n      Currently, IANA reviews I-Ds that have been\
    \ sent to IETF Last\n      Call, inputs comments in their data system, and then\
    \ emails their\n      comments to authors, WG chairs, and then to the IESG.  These\n\
    \      comments are also manually entered into the Datatracker for the\n     \
    \ public record.  However, it is difficult to determine whether the\n      IANA\
    \ issues have been resolved.  To help facilitate tracking of\n      IANA issues,\
    \ a display is needed to show 5 new IANA substates, in\n      a similar fashion\
    \ to how RFC Editor State is currently shown in\n      the Datatracker (see the\
    \ example, later in this section, of how\n      IANA state information could appear\
    \ in the Datatracker for\n      draft-example-00).\n      1) IANA Review Needed\n\
    \         This substate will allow the community, Secretariat, and IANA\n    \
    \     to easily track which documents have or have not been reviewed\n       \
    \  by IANA.  If this substate is NOT set to \"IANA Not OK\", \"IANA\n        \
    \ OK -- Actions Needed\", or \"IANA OK -- No Actions Needed\", the\n         substate\
    \ should be set to \"IANA Review Needed\" by default (this\n         is the first\
    \ substate for tracking IANA data).  For documents\n         that originate from\
    \ a non-IETF stream, the default will be\n         used.\n      2) IANA OK --\
    \ Actions Needed\n         This substate covers documents that require IANA actions,\
    \ and\n         the IANA Considerations section indicates the details of the\n\
    \         actions correctly.\n      3) IANA OK -- No Actions Needed\n        \
    \ This substate covers documents that require no IANA actions,\n         and the\
    \ IANA Considerations section indicates this correctly.\n      Note: The substate\
    \ will be set to \"IANA OK -- Action Needed\" or\n      \"IANA OK -- No Actions\
    \ Needed\" (from \"IANA Not OK\") once any\n      outstanding issues have been\
    \ resolved.  The comments section will\n      be used to provide details in the\
    \ History log about whether there\n      are no IANA actions, the text is OK,\
    \ or the issues have been\n      resolved.\n      4) IANA Not OK\n         If\
    \ IANA has issues with the text of the IANA Considerations\n         section of\
    \ a document, the substate should be set to \"IANA Not\n         OK\", and the\
    \ comment field should be populated with a\n         description of the issues\
    \ and questions.  In addition to any\n         questions IANA may have, IANA will\
    \ also include in the comments\n         field whether expert review is required,\
    \ if the document is\n         dependent on another document (e.g., document B\
    \ registers\n         values in a registry created by document A, which hasn't\
    \ been\n         published yet), and if there is a registry expert appointment\n\
    \         required.\n      5) Version Changed -- Review Needed\n         This\
    \ substate will allow the community, Secretariat, and IANA\n         to easily\
    \ track which documents have been reviewed and\n         subsequently when a version\
    \ of an Internet-Draft in Last Call\n         has changed, therefore requiring\
    \ a second review of the\n         document by IANA to ensure that either the\
    \ IANA considerations\n         have not changed, or any changes made to the document\
    \ affecting\n         IANA actions are clear.  This substate applies to I-Ds that\
    \ are\n         in any substate except \"IANA Review Needed\" and \"Version\n\
    \         Changed -- Review Needed\".\n         When new versions are available,\
    \ the Datatracker will\n         automatically set the IANA substate to \"Version\
    \ Changed --\n         Review Needed\".\n   Information providing the status of\
    \ the IANA review (one of the 5\n   substates listed above) should be included\
    \ as part of the evaluation\n   message (sent to the IESG) so that IANA can determine\
    \ if, and what,\n   further action is required.\n   All comments will be recorded\
    \ in the History log.  However, to reduce\n   redundancy and manual effort, the\
    \ Datatracker should provide the\n   ability to receive state information and\
    \ related comments from the\n   IANA tracking system.  There should be a notification\
    \ that comments\n   have been entered in the IANA-maintained system, and entry\
    \ of those\n   comments into the Datatracker and distribution of those comments\
    \ to\n   the authors should be automated.\n   - IESG Evaluation\n      As not\
    \ all documents receive an IETF Last Call, this state is\n      sometimes the\
    \ first time that IANA reviews a document.  For a\n      document that wasn't\
    \ IETF Last Called, IANA reviews the document,\n      enters comments in their\
    \ own tracking system, distributes email to\n      authors and other interested\
    \ parties (e.g., WG chairs, ISE\n      (Independent Submissions Editor)), and\
    \ then enters those same\n      comments into the Datatracker, where they are\
    \ recorded in the\n      History log.  In cases where a document was IETF Last\
    \ Called, IANA\n      checks for and reviews version changes and re-reviews documents\
    \ to\n      ensure that any identified IANA issues have been resolved.\n     \
    \ Comments will continue to be recorded in the History log.\n      However, to\
    \ reduce redundancy and manual effort, the Datatracker\n      should provide the\
    \ ability for IANA to enter substate information\n      and related comments into\
    \ the IANA tracking system, and\n      distribution of those comments to the authors\
    \ and entry into the\n      Datatracker should be automated.\n      Ideally, the\
    \ authors will have responded to and resolved any IANA\n      issues prior to\
    \ the document being slated for an IESG telechat.\n      However, if any document\
    \ continues to have an \"IANA Not OK\",\n      \"Version Changed -- Review Needed\"\
    , or \"IANA Review Needed\"\n      substate and is slated for the IESG telechat,\
    \ it should be called\n      out in the Agenda Package.  For example, it could\
    \ appear as\n      follows:\n       o draft-example-00\n         Title of Internet-Draft\n\
    \         Note: John Doe (jdoe@example.com) is the document shepherd.\n      \
    \   Token: Jane Doe\n         IANA: IANA Not OK\n      This will ensure that IANA\
    \ and the Area Directors (ADs) are aware\n      that there are still IANA issues\
    \ to be addressed prior to\n      publication, or that initial or follow-up IANA\
    \ review is required\n      and not yet completed (in cases where the substate\
    \ is listed as\n      \"IANA Review Needed\" or \"Version Changed -- Review Needed\"\
    ).\n   -  Document Approved for Publication\n      Once a document has been approved\
    \ for publication, the document\n      enters the IANA queue and is tracked using\
    \ IANA-defined states.\n      This state information is not currently available\
    \ via the\n      Datatracker.  In order for the community to view the IANA\n \
    \     processing states without being redirected to the IANA queue, the\n    \
    \  Datatracker should be extended to include IANA state information\n      as\
    \ defined by IANA.  For example, IANA state information could\n      appear in\
    \ the metadata portion of the document as follows:\n      Document type:     \
    \     Active Internet-Draft (FOO WG document)\n      Last updated:           2010-09-20\n\

    \    Proposed Standard\n      IANA state-change information will link to the IANA\
    \ queue, and\n      will be captured as a line item in the History log.  IANA\
    \ will\n      notify the Datatracker when changes are made in the IANA queue.\n\
    \      Once the IANA actions have been completed, the Datatracker History\n  \
    \    log will be updated to include the actions completed by IANA\n      (i.e.,\
    \ the author-approved actions).  This information will\n      include the same\
    \ information that is sent to the RFC Editor upon\n      completion of IANA actions.\n\
    \      The IANA State field may be any of the states defined by IANA.\n      The\
    \ list of IANA state names in use at the time this document was\n      published\
    \ is provided in Appendix A; however, IANA states are\n      defined by IANA and\
    \ are subject to change.  If there are any\n      discrepancies between the state\
    \ names listed in this document and\n      those listed on the IANA queue page\n\
    \      (http://www.iana.org/about/performance/ietf-draft-status/), the\n     \
    \ IANA queue is definitive.  States may be added or removed by IANA;\n      IANA\
    \ will work with the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee\n      (IAOC) to\
    \ update the Datatracker as necessary.\n   -  RFC Publication\n      References\
    \ to the I-D are updated to refer to the RFC once it is\n      published, and\
    \ minor updates may be made to match the published\n      RFC.  This data will\
    \ be tracked in the Datatracker to show when\n      the references in the IANA\
    \ registries were updated to include the\n      newly assigned RFC number.\n"

    \ links to AUTH48 pages\n      AUTH48 pages provide information about which authors\
    \ have approved\n      the document for publication, whether AD approval is required,\
    \ and\n      sometimes a summary of issues that need to be resolved before the\n\
    \      document can move forward.\n   2) links to the cluster pages\n      Clusters\
    \ are defined as documents with normative reference\n      dependencies, and documents\
    \ that have been requested for\n      simultaneous publication.  (For more information,\
    \ see\n      http://www.rfc-editor.org/cluster_def.html.)   The cluster pages\n\
    \      provide a view of the entire set of state information for\n      clustered\
    \ documents.\n      Note: The RFC Editor has been working with the cluster data\
    \ to\n      provide the community with accurate state information at the\n   \
    \   appropriate level of detail.  The RFC Editor database may require\n      significant\
    \ updates before this data can be integrated with the\n      Datatracker.\n  \
    \ 3) RFC metadata upon publication\n      The RFC Editor will notify the Datatracker\
    \ when a new RFC has been\n      published, and the Datatracker should have the\
    \ ability to\n      automatically update the relevant fields with data related\
    \ to the\n      published RFC.  In particular, the RFC number will be recorded\
    \ in\n      the Datatracker.  However, note that all fields are subject to\n \
    \     change during editing and should be updated; for example, the\n      document\
    \ title and the list of authors are sometimes changed, and\n      character counts\
    \ and page counts are always changed.\n   4) notation when documents are withdrawn\
    \ from the RFC Editor queue\n      If a document is to be removed from the RFC\
    \ Editor / IANA queues,\n      the responsible party (e.g., AD or Secretariat)\
    \ should change the\n      state of the document in the Datatracker to something\
    \ other than\n      \"RFC Ed Queue\".  The Datatracker should provide a text box\
    \ to\n      allow the responsible party to record details about the state\n  \
    \    change.  The state change and the related details will be recorded\n    \
    \  in the History log.  The state change in the Datatracker will\n      trigger\
    \ an email message to the RFC Editor and IANA as\n      notification that the\
    \ state of the document has been set to the\n      newly assigned state, with\
    \ the details provided in the text box.\n      The RFC Editor and IANA will update\
    \ their queues accordingly, and\n      the document will disappear from their\
    \ respective queues.\n"

    \ IANA and the RFC\n   Editor that would allow for increased automation, thus\
    \ reducing the\n   potential for delays and processing errors.  This section defines\n\

    \ <email>\n      -  IANA Actions Required\n   \"Consensus\" is as used in [RFC5741];\
    \ it determines the appropriate\n   Status of This Memo text to be applied to\
    \ IETF and IRTF documents.\n   The Consensus field should be set by the responsible\
    \ individuals, and\n   it should be listed in the Agenda Package provided before\
    \ an IESG\n   telechat so that the Area Directors can quickly review the status\
    \ of\n   the documents under review and correct the field if Consensus was not\n\
    \   received.\n   Additionally, the Agenda Package provided before an IESG telechat\n\
    \   should show the expiration date of the IETF Last Call.  This will be\n   helpful\
    \ for the ADs and the Secretariat to track the IETF Last Call\n   timeline.\n\
    \   When a document has been added to the RFC Editor queue (i.e., shows\n   an\
    \ RFC Editor state in the Datatracker), an automated note should be\n   sent to\

    \ should notify the RFC Editor and IANA\n   when the state of an I-D has been\
    \ moved to something other than \"RFC\n   Ed Queue\" or \"RFC Published\" -- that\
    \ is, when it should be removed\n   from the RFC Editor and IANA processing queues.\

- title: 4.2.2.  Datatracker Extensions for Alternate Streams
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Datatracker Extensions for Alternate Streams\n   Once the Datatracker\
    \ has been updated for the alternate streams\n   [RFC6322], the Datatracker should\
    \ be updated so that the following\n   are automated:\n   -  The Datatracker should\
    \ not expire any I-Ds that are under review\n      for publication.\n   -  The\
    \ Datatracker should automatically notify the approving body\n      when an I-D\
    \ that is under review has been updated (i.e., a new\n      version has been made\
    \ available).\n   -  The Datatracker should be updated so that the Agenda package\
    \ lists\n      I-Ds according to the stream that requested publication.  This\n\
    \      should help provide additional clarity during IESG Reviews, as\n      there\
    \ will be a clear indication of from which stream a document\n      originates.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.1.  Publication Requests
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.1.  Publication Requests\n   RFC 6322 [RFC6322] lists the requirements\
    \ for extending the\n   Datatracker to account for alternate-stream states and\
    \ annotations.\n   In particular, the document introduces the \"Sent to the RFC\
    \ Editor\"\n   state, which means the document is complete and has been sent to\
    \ the\n   RFC Editor for publication.\n   The Datatracker will provide a means\
    \ for the alternate streams to\n   generate a uniform publication request.  Using\
    \ the Datatracker, the\n   stream managers should be able to generate a publication\
    \ request that\n   contains the relevant information for any approved I-D.\n \
    \  Additionally, the Datatracker will provide the data (the same data\n   provided\
    \ for any IETF publication request -- see Section 4.2) in a\n   machine-readable\
    \ format.  This data will be available to the IANA and\n   RFC Editor, so that\
    \ data entry into the IANA and RFC Editor systems\n   can be automated.\n   This\
    \ update will allow the IANA and RFC Editor to handle documents in\n   a similar\
    \ manner, regardless of the document's stream.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Reporting Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Reporting Requirements\n   The Datatracker should have a \"Show Discrepancies\"\
    \ feature.  It\n   should show all records in the Datatracker that fit certain\
    \ criteria\n   (that seem to be a discrepancy).  In addition to showing data on\n\
    \   screen, it should send an email to defined interested parties at\n   regular\
    \ intervals (e.g., weekly).  This feature will only be\n   available to a subset\
    \ of individuals (namely, IANA, RFC Editor, and\n   the Secretariat), to ensure\
    \ that their queues are in sync.  This will\n   be especially helpful as the Datatracker\
    \ is extended (now and in the\n   future), to ensure that all parties are receiving\
    \ the correct\n   messages/data.\n   An initial set of discrepancies should be\
    \ defined, and additional\n   discrepancies could be defined over time.  For example,\
    \ the initial\n   set of discrepancies could include the following:\n   -  Show\
    \ drafts that have passed through the state \"Approved\n      Announcement sent\"\
    \ but do not have an RFC Editor state.\n   -  Show drafts that have IANA state\
    \ \"In Progress\", but RFC Editor\n      State is not equal to \"IANA\" or does\
    \ not contain \"*A\" (see\n      Appendix B).\n   -  Show drafts that have IANA\
    \ state \"Waiting on RFC Editor\" or\n      \"RFC-Ed-Ack\", but RFC Editor State\
    \ is \"IANA\" or contains \"*A\"\n      (see Appendix B).\n   -  Show drafts that\
    \ have a state of something other than \"RFC Ed\n      Queue\" or \"RFC Published\"\
