- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n\
    \   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.\n   In\
    \ particular, it defines objects for managing routes in the IP\n   Internet.\n\
    \   It is proposed that the ipRouteTable defined by MIB-II (RFC 1213) be\n   deprecated\
    \ and replaced with this table.  This adds the ability to\n   set or display multi-path\
    \ routes, and varying routes by network\n   management policy.\n"

- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n   RFC 1155 which defines\
    \ the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n   and naming objects for the purpose\
    \ of management.  RFC 1212 defines a\n   more concise description mechanism, which\
    \ is wholly consistent with\n   the SMI.\n   RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the\
    \ core set of managed objects for the\n   Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213\
    \ defines MIB-II, an evolution\n   of MIB-I based on implementation experience\
    \ and new operational\n   requirements.\n   RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the\
    \ protocol used for network access\n   to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits\
    \ new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [9].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Structure of MIB\n   The IP Forwarding Table is quite analogous to the\
    \ older ipRoute\n   Table.  The principal differences are:\n      (1)  It is somewhat\
    \ re-organized, for aesthetic reasons,\n      (2)  It has the Next Hop Autonomous\
    \ System Number, useful\n           primarily to the administrators of regional\
    \ networks,\n      (3)  It is instanced by Policy and Next Hop as well as by\n\
    \           ultimate destination.  Thus, multiple multipath routes\n         \
    \  can be managed, not just a single route, along with the\n           circumstances\
    \ under which the any given route might be\n           chosen.\n"
