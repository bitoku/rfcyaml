  - "1.  Introduction\n   Bandwidth demand continues to grow worldwide, stimulated\
    \ by the\n   accelerating growth and penetration of new packet-based services\
    \ and\n   multimedia applications:\n   o  Packet-based services such as Ethernet,\
    \ Voice over IP (VoIP),\n      Layer 2 (L2) / Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private Networks\
    \ (VPNs), IP\n      television (IPTV), Radio Access Network (RAN) backhauling,\
    \ etc.\n   o  Applications with various bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS)\n\
    \      requirements.\n   This growth in demand has resulted in dramatic increases\
    \ in access\n   rates that are, in turn, driving dramatic increases in metro and\
    \ core\n   network bandwidth requirements.\n   Over the past two decades, the\
    \ evolving optical transport\n   infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking\
    \ (SONET) / Synchronous\n   Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network\
    \ (OTN)) has\n   provided carriers with a high benchmark for reliability and\n\
    \   operational simplicity.\n   With the movement towards packet-based services,\
    \ the transport\n   network has to evolve to encompass the provision of packet-aware\n\
    \   capabilities while enabling carriers to leverage their installed, as\n   well\
    \ as planned, transport infrastructure investments.\n   Carriers are in need of\
    \ technologies capable of efficiently\n   supporting packet-based services and\
    \ applications on their transport\n   networks with guaranteed Service Level Agreements\
    \ (SLAs).  The need\n   to increase their revenue while remaining competitive\
    \ forces\n   operators to look for the lowest network Total Cost of Ownership\n\
    \   (TCO).  Investment in equipment and facilities (Capital Expenditure\n   (CAPEX))\
    \ and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) should be minimized.\n   There are a number\
    \ of technology options for carriers to meet the\n   challenge of increased service\
    \ sophistication and transport\n   efficiency, with increasing usage of hybrid\
    \ packet-transport and\n   circuit-transport technology solutions.  To realize\
    \ these goals, it\n   is essential that packet-transport technology be available\
    \ that can\n   support the same high benchmarks for reliability and operational\n\
    \   simplicity set by SDH/SONET and OTN technologies.\n   Furthermore, for carriers\
    \ it is important that operation of such\n   packet transport networks should\
    \ preserve the look-and-feel to which\n   carriers have become accustomed in deploying\
    \ their optical transport\n   networks, while providing common, multi-layer operations,\
    \ resiliency,\n   control, and multi-technology management.\n   Transport carriers\
    \ require control and deterministic usage of network\n   resources.  They need\
    \ end-to-end control to engineer network paths\n   and to efficiently utilize\
    \ network resources.  They require\n   capabilities to support static (management-plane-based)\
    \ or dynamic\n   (control-plane-based) provisioning of deterministic, protected,\
    \ and\n   secured services and their associated resources.\n   It is also important\
    \ to ensure smooth interworking of the packet\n   transport network with other\
    \ existing/legacy packet networks, and\n   provide mappings to enable packet transport\
    \ carriage over a variety\n   of transport network infrastructures.  The latter\
    \ has been termed\n   vertical interworking, and is also known as client/server\
    \ or network\n   interworking.  The former has been termed horizontal interworking,\n\
    \   and is also known as peer-partition or service interworking.  For\n   more\
    \ details on interworking and some of the issues that may arise\n   (especially\
    \ with horizontal interworking), see G.805 [ITU.G805.2000]\n   and Y.1401 [ITU.Y1401.2008].\n\
    \   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a maturing packet technology\n  \
    \ and it is already playing an important role in transport networks and\n   services.\
    \  However, not all of MPLS's capabilities and mechanisms are\n   needed and/or\
    \ consistent with transport network operations.  There\n   are also transport\
    \ technology characteristics that are not currently\n   reflected in MPLS.  Therefore,\
    \ there is the need to define an MPLS\n   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) that supports\
    \ the capabilities and\n   functionalities needed for packet-transport network\
    \ services and\n   operations through combining the packet experience of MPLS\
    \ with the\n   operational experience and practices of existing transport networks.\n\
    \   MPLS-TP will enable the deployment of packet-based transport networks\n  \
    \ that will efficiently scale to support packet services in a simple\n   and cost-effective\
    \ way.  MPLS-TP needs to combine the necessary\n   existing capabilities of MPLS\
    \ with additional minimal mechanisms in\n   order that it can be used in a transport\
    \ role.\n   This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile\n\
    \   (MPLS-TP).  The requirements are for the behavior of the protocol\n   mechanisms\
    \ and procedures that constitute building blocks out of\n   which the MPLS Transport\
    \ Profile is constructed.  That is, the\n   requirements indicate what features\
    \ are to be available in the MPLS\n   toolkit for use by MPLS-TP.  The requirements\
    \ in this document do not\n   describe what functions an MPLS-TP implementation\
    \ supports.  The\n   purpose of this document is to identify the toolkit and any\
    \ new\n   protocol work that is required.\n   This document is a product of a\
    \ joint ITU-T and IETF effort to\n   include an MPLS Transport Profile within\
    \ the IETF MPLS and PWE3\n   architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\
    \ of a\n   packet transport network as defined by ITU-T.  The document is a\n\
    \   requirements specification, but is presented on the Standards Track\n   so\
    \ that it can be more easily cited as a normative reference from\n   within the\
    \ work of the ITU-T.\n   This work is based on two sources of requirements, MPLS\
    \ and PWE3\n   architectures as defined by IETF and packet transport networks\
    \ as\n   defined by ITU-T.  The requirements of MPLS-TP are provided below.\n\
    \   The relevant functions of MPLS and PWE3 are included in MPLS-TP,\n   except\
    \ where explicitly excluded.  Any new functionality that is\n   defined to fulfill\
    \ the requirements for MPLS-TP must be agreed within\n   the IETF through the\
    \ IETF consensus process as per [RFC4929].\n   MPLS-TP transport paths may be\
    \ established using static or dynamic\n   configuration.  It should be noted that\
    \ the MPLS-TP network and its\n   transport paths can always be operated fully\
    \ (including OAM and\n   protection capabilities) in the absence of any control\
    \ plane.\n"

- title: 1.2.2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  Definitions\n   Note: The definition of \"segment\" in a GMPLS/ASON context\
    \ (i.e., as\n   defined in RFC4397 [RFC4397]) encompasses both \"segment\" and\n\
    \   \"concatenated segment\" as defined in this document.\n   Associated bidirectional\
    \ path: A path that supports traffic flow in\n   both directions but that is constructed\
    \ from a pair of unidirectional\n   paths (one for each direction) that are associated\
    \ with one another\n   at the path's ingress/egress points.  The forward and backward\n\
    \   directions are setup, monitored, and protected independently.  As a\n   consequence,\
    \ they may or may not follow the same route (links and\n   nodes) across the network.\n\
    \   Client layer network: In a client/server relationship (see G.805\n   [ITU.G805.2000]),\
    \ the client layer network receives a (transport)\n   service from the lower server\
    \ layer network (usually the layer\n   network under consideration).\n   Concatenated\
    \ Segment: A serial-compound link connection as defined in\n   G.805 [ITU.G805.2000].\
    \  A concatenated segment is a contiguous part\n   of an LSP or multi-segment\
    \ PW that comprises a set of segments and\n   their interconnecting nodes in sequence.\
    \  See also \"Segment\".\n   Control Plane: Within the scope of this document,\
    \ the control plane\n   performs transport path control functions.  Through signalling,\
    \ the\n   control plane sets up, modifies and releases transport paths, and may\n\
    \   recover a transport path in case of a failure.  The control plane\n   also\
    \ performs other functions in support of transport path control,\n   such as routing\
    \ information dissemination.\n   Co-routed Bidirectional path: A path where the\
    \ forward and backward\n   directions follow the same route (links and nodes)\
    \ across the\n   network.  Both directions are setup, monitored and protected\
    \ as a\n   single entity.  A transport network path is typically co-routed.\n\
    \   Domain: A domain represents a collection of entities (for example\n   network\
    \ elements) that are grouped for a particular purpose, examples\n   of which are\
    \ administrative and/or managerial responsibilities, trust\n   relationships,\
    \ addressing schemes, infrastructure capabilities,\n   aggregation, survivability\
    \ techniques, distributions of control\n   functionality, etc.  Examples of such\
    \ domains include IGP areas and\n   Autonomous Systems.\n   Layer network: Layer\
    \ network is defined in G.805 [ITU.G805.2000].  A\n   layer network provides for\
    \ the transfer of client information and\n   independent operation of the client\
    \ OAM.  A layer network may be\n   described in a service context as follows:\
    \ one layer network may\n   provide a (transport) service to a higher client layer\
    \ network and\n   may, in turn, be a client to a lower-layer network.  A layer\
    \ network\n   is a logical construction somewhat independent of arrangement or\n\
    \   composition of physical network elements.  A particular physical\n   network\
    \ element may topologically belong to more than one layer\n   network, depending\
    \ on the actions it takes on the encapsulation\n   associated with the logical\
    \ layers (e.g., the label stack), and thus\n   could be modeled as multiple logical\
    \ elements.  A layer network may\n   consist of one or more sublayers.  Section\
    \ 1.4 provides a more\n   detailed overview of what constitutes a layer network.\
    \  For\n   additional explanation of how layer networks relate to the OSI\n  \
    \ concept of layering, see Appendix I of Y.2611 [ITU.Y2611.2006].\n   Link: A\
    \ physical or logical connection between a pair of LSRs that\n   are adjacent\
    \ at the (sub)layer network under consideration.  A link\n   may carry zero, one,\
    \ or more LSPs or PWs.  A packet entering a link\n   will emerge with the same\
    \ label-stack entry values.\n   MPLS-TP Logical Ring: An MPLS-TP logical ring\
    \ is constructed from a\n   set of LSRs and logical data links (such as MPLS-TP\
    \ LSP tunnels or\n   MPLS-TP pseudowires) and physical data links that form a\
    \ ring\n   topology.\n   Path: See Transport Path.\n   MPLS-TP Physical Ring:\
    \ An MPLS-TP physical ring is constructed from a\n   set of LSRs and physical\
    \ data links that form a ring topology.\n   MPLS-TP Ring Topology: In an MPLS-TP\
    \ ring topology, each LSR is\n   connected to exactly two other LSRs, each via\
    \ a single point-to-point\n   bidirectional MPLS-TP capable link.  A ring may\
    \ also be constructed\n   from only two LSRs where there are also exactly two\
    \ links.  Rings may\n   be connected to other LSRs to form a larger network. \
    \ Traffic\n   originating or terminating outside the ring may be carried over\
    \ the\n   ring.  Client network nodes (such as CEs) may be connected directly\n\
    \   to an LSR in the ring.\n   Section Layer Network: A section layer is a server\
    \ layer (which may\n   be MPLS-TP or a different technology) that provides for\
    \ the transfer\n   of the section-layer client information between adjacent nodes\
    \ in the\n   transport-path layer or transport-service layer.  A section layer\
    \ may\n   provide for aggregation of multiple MPLS-TP clients.  Note that G.805\n\
    \   [ITU.G805.2000] defines the section layer as one of the two layer\n   networks\
    \ in a transmission-media layer network.  The other layer\n   network is the physical-media\
    \ layer network.\n   Segment: A link connection as defined in G.805 [ITU.G805.2000].\
    \  A\n   segment is the part of an LSP that traverses a single link or the\n \
    \  part of a PW that traverses a single link (i.e., that connects a pair\n   of\
    \ adjacent {Switching|Terminating} Provider Edges).  See also\n   \"Concatenated\
    \ Segment\".\n   Server Layer Network: In a client/server relationship (see G.805\n\
    \   [ITU.G805.2000]), the server layer network provides a (transport)\n   service\
    \ to the higher client layer network (usually the layer network\n   under consideration).\n\
    \   Sublayer: Sublayer is defined in G.805 [ITU.G805.2000].  The\n   distinction\
    \ between a layer network and a sublayer is that a sublayer\n   is not directly\
    \ accessible to clients outside of its encapsulating\n   layer network and offers\
    \ no direct transport service for a higher\n   layer (client) network.\n   Switching\
    \ Provider Edge (S-PE): See [MS-PW-ARCH].\n   Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE):\
    \ See [MS-PW-ARCH].\n   Transport Path: A network connection as defined in G.805\n\
    \   [ITU.G805.2000].  In an MPLS-TP environment, a transport path\n   corresponds\
    \ to an LSP or a PW.\n   Transport Path Layer: A (sub)layer network that provides\
    \ point-to-\n   point or point-to-multipoint transport paths.  It provides OAM\
    \ that\n   is independent of the clients that it is transporting.\n   Transport\
    \ Service Layer: A layer network in which transport paths are\n   used to carry\
    \ a customer's (individual or bundled) service (may be\n   point-to-point, point-to-multipoint,\
    \ or multipoint-to-multipoint\n   services).\n   Transmission Media Layer: A layer\
    \ network, consisting of a section\n   layer network and a physical layer network\
    \ as defined in G.805\n   [ITU.G805.2000], that provides sections (two-port point-to-point\n\
    \   connections) to carry the aggregate of network-transport path or\n   network-service\
    \ layers on various physical media.\n   Unidirectional Path: A path that supports\
    \ traffic flow in only one\n   direction.\n"

  - "1.3.  Transport Network Overview\n   The connectivity service is the basic service\
    \ provided by a transport\n   network.  The purpose of a transport network is\
    \ to carry its customer\n   traffic (i.e., the stream of customer PDUs or customer\
    \ bits,\n   including overhead) between end points in the transport network\n\
    \   (typically over several intermediate nodes).  The connectivity\n   services\
    \ offered to customers are typically aggregated into large\n   transport paths\
    \ with long holding times and OAM that is independent\n   (of the client OAM),\
    \ which contribute to enabling the efficient and\n   reliable operation of the\
    \ transport network.  These transport paths\n   are modified infrequently.\n \
    \  Quality-of-service mechanisms are required in the packet transport\n   network\
    \ to ensure the prioritization of critical services, to\n   guarantee bandwidth,\
    \ and to control jitter and delay.  A transport\n   network must provide the means\
    \ to meet the quality-of-service\n   objectives of its clients.  This is achieved\
    \ by providing a mechanism\n   for client network service demarcation for the\
    \ network path together\n   with an associated network resiliency mechanism.\n\
    \   Aggregation is beneficial for achieving scalability and security\n   since:\n\
    \   1.  It reduces the number of provisioning and forwarding states in\n     \
    \  the network core.\n   2.  It reduces load and the cost of implementing service\
    \ assurance\n       and fault management.\n   3.  Customer traffic is encapsulated\
    \ and layer-associated OAM\n       overhead is added.  This allows complete isolation\
    \ of customer\n       traffic and its management from carrier operations.\n  \
    \ An important attribute of a transport network is that it is able to\n   function\
    \ regardless of which clients are using its connection service\n   or over which\
    \ transmission media it is running.  From a functional\n   and operational point\
    \ of view, the client, transport network, and\n   server layers are independent\
    \ layer networks.  Another key\n   characteristic of transport networks is the\
    \ capability to maintain\n   the integrity of the client across the transport\
    \ network.  A\n   transport network must also provide a method of service monitoring\
    \ in\n   order to verify the delivery of an agreed quality of service.  This\n\
    \   is enabled by means of carrier-grade OAM tools.\n   Customer traffic is first\
    \ encapsulated within the transport-service\n   layer network.  The transport\
    \ service layer network signals may then\n   be aggregated into a transport-path\
    \ layer network for transport\n   through the network in order to optimize network\
    \ management.\n   Transport-service layer network OAM is used to monitor the transport\n\
    \   integrity of the customer traffic, and transport-path layer network\n   OAM\
    \ is used to monitor the transport integrity of the aggregates.  At\n   any hop,\
    \ the aggregated signals may be further aggregated in lower-\n   layer transport\
    \ network paths for transport across intermediate\n   shared links.  The transport\
    \ service layer network signals are\n   extracted at the edges of aggregation\
    \ domains, and are either\n   delivered to the customer or forwarded to another\
    \ domain.  In the\n   core of the network, only the transport path layer network\
    \ signals\n   are monitored at intermediate points; individual transport service\n\
    \   layer network signals are monitored at the network boundary.\n   Although\
    \ the connectivity of the transport-service layer network may\n   be point-to-point,\
    \ point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-to-multipoint,\n   the transport-path layer\
    \ network only provides point-to-point or\n   point-to-multipoint transport paths,\
    \ which are used to carry\n   aggregates of transport service layer network traffic.\n"

  - "1.4.  Layer Network Overview\n   A layer network provides its clients with a\
    \ transport service and the\n   operation of the layer network is independent\
    \ of whatever client\n   happens to use the layer network.  Information that passes\
    \ between\n   any client to the layer network is common to all clients and is\
    \ the\n   minimum needed to be consistent with the definition of the transport\n\
    \   service offered.  The client layer network can be connectionless,\n   connection-oriented\
    \ packet switched, or circuit switched.  The\n   transport service transfers a\
    \ payload such that the client can\n   populate the payload without affecting\
    \ any operation within the\n   serving layer network.  Here, payload means:\n\
    \   o  an individual packet payload (for connectionless networks),\n   o  a sequence\
    \ of packet payloads (for connection-oriented packet-\n      switched networks),\
    \ or\n   o  a deterministic schedule of payloads (for circuit-switched\n     \
    \ networks).\n   The operations within a layer network that are independent of\
    \ its\n   clients include the control of forwarding, the control of resource\n\
    \   reservation, the control of traffic de-merging, and the OAM and\n   recovery\
    \ of the transport service.  All of these operations are\n   internal to a layer\
    \ network.  By definition, a layer network does not\n   rely on any client information\
    \ to perform these operations, and\n   therefore all information required to perform\
    \ these operations is\n   independent of whatever client is using the layer network.\n\
    \   A layer network will have consistent features in order to support the\n  \
    \ control of forwarding, resource reservation, OAM, and recovery.  For\n   example,\
    \ a layer network will have a common addressing scheme for the\n   end points\
    \ of the transport service and a common set of transport\n   descriptors for the\
    \ transport service.  However, a client may use a\n   different addressing scheme\
    \ or different traffic descriptors\n   (consistent with performance inheritance).\n\
    \   It is sometimes useful to independently monitor a smaller domain\n   within\
    \ a layer network (or the transport services that traverse this\n   smaller domain),\
    \ but the control of forwarding or the control of\n   resource reservation involved\
    \ retain their common elements.  These\n   smaller monitored domains are sublayers.\n\
    \   It is sometimes useful to independently control forwarding in a\n   smaller\
    \ domain within a layer network, but the control of resource\n   reservation and\
    \ OAM retain their common elements.  These smaller\n   domains are partitions\
    \ of the layer network.\n"

- title: 2.5.6.1.  Ring Protection
  contents:
  - "2.5.6.1.  Ring Protection\n   Several service providers have expressed a high\
    \ level of interest in\n   operating MPLS-TP in ring topologies and require a\
    \ high level of\n   survivability function in these topologies.  The requirements\
    \ listed\n   below have been collected from these service providers and from the\n\
    \   ITU-T.\n   The main objective in considering a specific topology (such as\
    \ a\n   ring) is to determine whether it is possible to optimize any\n   mechanisms\
    \ such that the performance of those mechanisms within the\n   topology is significantly\
    \ better than the performance of the generic\n   mechanisms in the same topology.\
    \  The benefits of such optimizations\n   are traded against the costs of developing,\
    \ implementing, deploying,\n   and operating the additional optimized mechanisms\
    \ noting that the\n   generic mechanisms MUST continue to be supported.\n   Within\
    \ the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks, the optimization\n   criteria considered\
    \ in ring topologies are as follows:\n   a.  Minimize the number of OAM entities\
    \ that are needed to trigger\n       the recovery operation, such that it is less\
    \ than is required by\n       other recovery mechanisms.\n   b.  Minimize the\
    \ number of elements of recovery in the ring, such\n       that it is less than\
    \ is required by other recovery mechanisms.\n   c.  Minimize the number of labels\
    \ required for the protection paths\n       across the ring, such that it is less\
    \ than is required by other\n       recovery mechanisms.\n   d.  Minimize the\
    \ amount of control and management-plane transactions\n       during a maintenance\
    \ operation (e.g., ring upgrade), such that it\n       is less than the amount\
    \ required by other recovery mechanisms.\n   e.  When a control plane is supported,\
    \ minimize the impact on\n       signaling and routing information exchange during\
    \ protection,\n       such that it is less than the impact caused by other recovery\n\
    \       mechanisms.\n   It may be observed that the requirements in Section 2.5.6.1\
    \ are fully\n   compatible with the generic requirements expressed in Section\
    \ 2.5\n   through Section 2.5.6 inclusive, and that no requirements that are\n\
    \   specific to ring topologies have been identified.\n   92   MPLS-TP MUST include\
    \ recovery mechanisms that operate in any\n        single ring supported in MPLS-TP,\
    \ and continue to operate within\n        the single rings even when the rings\
    \ are interconnected.\n   93   When a network is constructed from interconnected\
    \ rings, MPLS-TP\n        MUST support recovery mechanisms that protect user data\
    \ that\n        traverses more than one ring.  This includes the possibility of\n\
    \        failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links.\n   94   MPLS-TP recovery\
    \ in a ring MUST protect unidirectional and\n        bidirectional P2P transport\
    \ paths.\n   95   MPLS-TP recovery in a ring MUST protect unidirectional P2MP\n\
    \        transport paths.\n   96   MPLS-TP 1+1 and 1:1 protection in a ring MUST\
    \ support switching\n        time within 50 ms from the moment of fault detection\
    \ in a\n        network with a 16-node ring with less than 1200 km of fiber.\n\
    \   97   The protection switching time in a ring MUST be independent of\n    \
    \    the number of LSPs crossing the ring.\n   98   The configuration and operation\
    \ of recovery mechanisms in a ring\n        MUST scale well with:\n        A.\
    \  the number of transport paths (MUST be better than linear\n            scaling)\n\
    \        B.  the number of nodes on the ring (MUST be at least as good as\n  \
    \          linear scaling)\n        C.  the number of ring interconnects (MUST\
    \ be at least as good\n            as linear scaling)\n   99   Recovery techniques\
    \ used in a ring MUST NOT prevent the ring\n        from being connected to a\
    \ general MPLS-TP network in any\n        arbitrary way, and MUST NOT prevent\
    \ the operation of recovery\n        techniques in the rest of the network.\n\
    \   100  Recovery techniques in a ring SHOULD be identical (or as similar\n  \
    \      as possible) to those in general transport networks to simplify\n     \
    \   implementation and operations.  However, this MUST NOT override\n        any\
    \ other requirement.\n   101  Recovery techniques in logical and physical rings\
    \ SHOULD be\n        identical to simplify implementation and operation.  However,\n\
    \        this MUST NOT override any other requirement.\n   102  The default recovery\
    \ scheme in a ring MUST be bidirectional\n        recovery in order to simplify\
    \ the recovery operation.\n   103  The recovery mechanism in a ring MUST support\
    \ revertive\n        switching, which MUST be the default behavior.  This allows\n\
    \        optimization of the use of the ring resources, and restores the\n   \
    \     preferred quality conditions for normal traffic (e.g., delay)\n        when\
    \ the recovery mechanism is no longer needed.\n   104  The recovery mechanisms\
    \ in a ring MUST support ways to\n        distinguish administrative protection-switching\
    \ from protection-\n        switching initiated by other triggers.\n   105  It\
    \ MUST be possible to lockout (disable) protection mechanisms\n        on selected\
    \ links (spans) in a ring (depending on the operator's\n        need).  This may\
    \ require lockout mechanisms to be applied to\n        intermediate nodes within\
    \ a transport path.\n   106  MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms in a ring:\n        A.\
    \  MUST include a mechanism to allow an implementation to\n            handle\
    \ and coordinate coexisting requests or triggers for\n            protection-switching\
    \ based on priority.  (For example, this\n            includes multiple requests\
    \ that are not necessarily arriving\n            simultaneously and that are located\
    \ anywhere in the ring.)\n            Note that such coordination of the ring\
    \ is equivalent to the\n            use of shared protection groups.\n       \
    \ B.  SHOULD protect against multiple failures\n   107  MPLS-TP recovery and reversion\
    \ mechanisms in a ring MUST offer a\n        way to prevent frequent operation\
    \ of recovery in the event of an\n        intermittent defect.\n   108  MPLS-TP\
    \ MUST support the sharing of protection bandwidth in a\n        ring by allowing\
    \ best-effort traffic.\n   109  MPLS-TP MUST support sharing of ring protection\
    \ resources such\n        that protection paths that are known not to be required\n\
