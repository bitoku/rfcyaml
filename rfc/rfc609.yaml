    \ NIC/NLS Services\nWithin the next few weeks we will be transferring computer\
    \ services for\nour ROME, ARPA, and NIC users from the ARC/NIC system to a new\
    \ system we\nare installing at TYMSHARE in Cupertino, Ca.  The name of this system\
    \ is\nOFFICE-1 and is site 53 (oct) when talking to TELNET or site 43 (dec)\n\
    when talking to a TIP. Currently we are experiencing hardware\ndifficulties on\
    \ this system, but we and the staff at TYMSHARE are\nworking diligently to solve\
    \ the problems. Once the hardware is solid and\nreliable, the above users will\
    \ have their directories transferred to the\nOFFICE-1 facility, and receive their\
    \ NLS power from that site. Watch for\nupcoming announcements as to the exact\
    \ date when your directory will be\nmoved to OFFICE-1.\n       [ This RFC was\
    \ put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives\
