  - "1.  Introduction\n   During discussions on how to add DNS-Based Authentication\
    \ of Named\n   Entities (DANE) [RFC6698] technology to new protocols and services,\n\
    \   people were repeatedly confused as to what the numeric values stood\n   for\
    \ and even the order of the fields of a TLSA record (note that TLSA\n   is not\
    \ an acronym but a name).  This document updates the IANA\n   registry definition\
    \ for the TLSA record to add a column containing an\n   acronym for each specified\
    \ field, in order to reduce confusion.  This\n   document does not change the\
    \ DANE protocol in any way.\n   It is expected that DANE parsers in applications\
    \ and DNS software can\n   adopt parsing the acronyms for each field.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This document applies to the \"DNS-Based Authentication\
    \ of Named\n   Entities (DANE) Parameters\" registry located at <http://www.iana.org/\n\
    \   assignments/dane-parameters>.  IANA has added a column with an\n   acronym\
    \ to each of the sub-registries.\n   [RFC6698] and this document are the referenced\
    \ documents for the\n   three sub-registries.\n   As these acronyms are offered\
    \ for human consumption, case does not\n   matter; it is expected that software\
    \ that parses TLSA records will\n   handle upper-, mixed-, or lower-case characters\
    \ as input.\n"
