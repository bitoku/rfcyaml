- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP [RFC4271] implementations typically support a routing\
    \ policy\n   language to control the distribution of routing information.  Network\n\
    \   operators attach BGP communities to routes to associate particular\n   properties\
    \ with these routes.  These properties may include\n   information such as the\
    \ route origin location, or specification of a\n   routing policy action to be\
    \ taken, or one that has been taken, and is\n   applied to all routes contained\
    \ in a BGP Update Message where the\n   Communities Attribute is included.  Because\
    \ BGP communities are\n   optional transitive BGP attributes, BGP communities\
    \ may be acted upon\n   or otherwise used by routing policies in other Autonomous\
    \ Systems\n   (ASes) on the Internet.\n   A BGP Communities attribute is a variable-length\
    \ attribute consisting\n   of a set of one or more four-octet values, each of\
    \ which specify a\n   community [RFC1997].  Common use of the individual values\
    \ of this\n   attribute type split this single 32-bit value into two 16-bit values.\n\
    \   The most significant word is interpreted as an Autonomous System\n   Number\
    \ (ASN), and the least significant word is a locally defined\n   value whose meaning\
    \ is assigned by the operator of the AS in the most\n   significant word.\n  \
    \ Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs [RFC6793], the BGP Communities\n   attribute\
    \ can no longer accommodate the above encoding, as a two-\n   octet word cannot\
    \ fit a four-octet ASN.  The BGP Extended Communities\n   attribute [RFC4360]\
    \ is also unsuitable.  The six-octet length of the\n   Extended Community value\
    \ precludes the common operational practice of\n   encoding four-octet ASNs in\
    \ both the Global Administrator and the\n   Local Administrator sub-fields.\n\
    \   To address these shortcomings, this document defines a BGP Large\n   Communities\
    \ attribute encoded as an unordered set of one or more\n   twelve-octet values,\
    \ each consisting of a four-octet Global\n   Administrator field and two four-octet\
    \ operator-defined fields, each\n   of which can be used to denote properties\
    \ or actions significant to\n   the operator of the AS assigning the values.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  BGP Large Communities Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.  BGP Large Communities Attribute\n   This document defines the BGP Large Communities\
    \ attribute as an\n   optional transitive path attribute of variable length. \
    \ All routes\n   with the BGP Large Communities attribute belong to the communities\n\
    \   specified in the attribute.\n   Each BGP Large Community value is encoded\
    \ as a 12-octet quantity, as\n   follows:\n    0                   1         \
    \          2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\
    \ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |                      Global Administrator                     |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |                       Local Data Part 1                       |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |                       Local Data Part 2                       |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.\n   Local Data Part\
    \ 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.\n   Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet\
    \ operator-defined value.\n   The Global Administrator field is intended to allow\
    \ different ASes to\n   define BGP Large Communities without collision.  This\
    \ field SHOULD be\n   an ASN, in which case the Local Data Parts are to be interpreted\
    \ as\n   defined by the owner of the ASN.  The use of Reserved ASNs (0\n   [RFC7607],\
    \ 65535 and 4294967295 [RFC7300]) is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   There is no significance\
    \ to the order in which twelve-octet Large\n   Community Attribute values are\
    \ encoded in a Large Communities\n   attribute, A BGP speaker can transmit them\
    \ in any order.\n   Duplicate BGP Large Community values MUST NOT be transmitted.\
    \  A\n   receiving speaker MUST silently remove redundant BGP Large Community\n\
    \   values from a BGP Large Community attribute.\n"
- title: 4.  Aggregation
  contents:
  - "4.  Aggregation\n   If a range of routes is aggregated, then the resulting aggregate\n\
    \   should have a BGP Large Communities attribute that contains all of\n   the\
    \ BGP Large Communities attributes from all of the aggregated\n   routes.\n"
- title: 5.  Canonical Representation
  contents:
  - "5.  Canonical Representation\n   The canonical representation of BGP Large Communities\
    \ is three\n   separate unsigned integers in decimal notation in the following\n\
    \   order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers\n   MUST\
    \ NOT contain leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented with\n   a single\
    \ zero.  Each number is separated from the next by a single\n   colon.  For example:\
    \ 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0.\n   BGP Large Communities SHOULD be represented\
    \ in the canonical\n   representation.\n"
- title: 6.  Error Handling
  contents:
  - "6.  Error Handling\n   The error handling of BGP Large Communities is as follows:\n\
    \   o  A BGP Large Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed if\n  \
    \    the length of the BGP Large Communities Attribute value, expressed\n    \
    \  in octets, is not a non-zero multiple of 12.\n   o  A BGP Large Communities\
    \ attribute SHALL NOT be considered\n      malformed due to presence of duplicate\
    \ Large Community values.\n   o  A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed BGP Large\
    \ Communities\n      attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of \"treat-as-\n\
    \      withdraw\" as described in Section 2 of [RFC7606].\n   The BGP Large Communities\
    \ Global Administrator field may contain any\n   value, and a BGP Large Communities\
    \ attribute MUST NOT be considered\n   malformed if the Global Administrator field\
    \ contains an unallocated,\n   unassigned, or reserved ASN.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not change any underlying\
    \ security issues\n   associated with any other BGP Communities mechanism.  Specifically,\n\
    \   an AS relying on the BGP Large Communities attribute carried in BGP\n   must\
    \ have trust in every other AS in the path, as any intermediate AS\n   in the\
    \ path may have added, deleted, or altered the BGP Large\n   Communities attribute.\
    \  Specifying the mechanism to provide such\n   trust is beyond the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   BGP Large Communities do not protect the integrity of each community\n\
    \   value.  Operators should be aware that it is possible for a BGP\n   speaker\
    \ to alter BGP Large Community Attribute values in a BGP Update\n   Message. \
    \ Protecting the integrity of the transitive handling of BGP\n   Large Community\
    \ attributes in a manner consistent with the intent of\n   expressed BGP routing\
    \ policies falls within the broader scope of\n   securing BGP, and is not specifically\
    \ addressed here.\n   Network administrators should note the recommendations in\
    \ Section 11\n   of \"BGP Operations and Security\" [RFC7454].\n"
