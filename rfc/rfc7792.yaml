  - "1.  Introduction\n   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (DWDM)\n   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)\n   applications.
    \ A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies\n   used to denote allowed
    nominal central frequencies that may be used\n   for defining applications that
    utilize WDM transmission.  The channel\n   spacing is the frequency spacing between
    two allowed nominal central\n   frequencies.  All of the wavelengths on a fiber
    use different central\n   frequencies and occupy a designated range of frequencies.\n
    \  Fixed-grid channel spacing is selected from 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz,\n   100
    GHz, and integer multiples of 100 GHz.  Additionally, [G.694.1]\n   defines \"flexible
    grids\", also known as \"flexi-grid\".  The terms\n   \"frequency slot\" (i.e.,
    the frequency range allocated to a specific\n   channel and unavailable to other
    channels within a flexible grid) and\n   \"slot width\" (i.e., the full width
    of a frequency slot in a flexible\n   grid) are introduced in [G.694.1] to define
    a flexible grid.\n   [RFC7698] defines a framework and the associated control-plane\n
    \  requirements for the GMPLS-based [RFC3945] control of flexi-grid DWDM\n   networks.\n
    \  [RFC6163] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element\n   (PCE)
    control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs), and\n   [RFC7689] describes
    the requirements and protocol extensions for\n   signaling to set up Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) in WSONs.\n   This document describes the additional requirements
    and protocol\n   extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering\n
    \  (RSVP-TE) [RFC3473] to set up LSPs in networks that support the\n   flexi-grid.\n"

  - "3.  Requirements for Flexible-Grid Signaling\n   The architecture for establishing
    LSPs in a flexi-grid network is\n   described in [RFC7698].\n   An optical-spectrum
    LSP occupies a specific frequency slot, i.e., a\n   range of frequencies.  The
    process of computing a route and the\n   allocation of a frequency slot is referred
    to as \"Routing and\n   Spectrum Assignment\" (RSA).  [RFC7698] describes three
    architectural\n   approaches to RSA: combined RSA, separated RSA, and distributed
    SA.\n   The first two approaches are referred to as \"centralized SA\", because\n
    \  routing (i.e., path determination) and spectrum assignment (i.e.,\n   selection
    of frequency slots) are both performed by a centralized\n   entity prior to the
    signaling procedure.\n   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency
    slot is\n   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during LSP setup.  In the case\n
    \  of distributed SA, the slot width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified\n   in
    the Path message, allowing the network elements to select the\n   frequency slot
    to be used when they process the RSVP-TE messages.\n   If the capability to switch
    or convert the whole optical spectrum\n   allocated to an optical-spectrum LSP
    is not available at some nodes\n   along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject
    to the Optical\n   \"spectrum continuity constraint\" as described in [RFC7698].\n
    \  The remainder of this section states the additional requirements for\n   signaling
    in a flexi-grid network.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Slot Width\n   The slot width is an end-to-end parameter representing
      how much\n   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-grid LSP.  It is the\n
      \  equivalent of optical bandwidth, although the amount of bandwidth\n   associated
      with a slot width will depend on the signal encoding.\n   Different LSPs may
      request different amounts of frequency resource in\n   flexible-grid networks,
      so the slot width MUST be carried in the\n   signaling message during LSP establishment.
      \ This enables the nodes\n   along the LSP to know how much frequency resource
      has been requested\n   (in a Path message) and how much has been allocated (by
      a\n   Resv message) for the LSP.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Slot Width
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Frequency Slot\n   The frequency slot information identifies which part
      of the frequency\n   spectrum is allocated on each link for an LSP in a flexi-grid\n
      \  network.\n   This information MUST be present in a Resv message to indicate,\n
      \  hop by hop, the central frequency of the allocated resource.  In\n   combination
      with the slot width indicated in a Resv message (see\n   Section 3.1), the central
      frequency carried in a Resv message\n   identifies the resources reserved for
      the LSP (known as the\n   frequency slot).\n   The frequency slot can be represented
      by two parameters, as follows:\n      Frequency slot = [(central frequency)
      - (slot width)/2] ~\n                       [(central frequency) + (slot width)/2]\n
      \  As is common with other resource identifiers (i.e., labels) in GMPLS\n   signaling,
      it must be possible for the head-end node, when sending a\n   Path message,
      to suggest or require the central frequency to be used\n   for the LSP.  Furthermore,
      for bidirectional LSPs, the Path message\n   MUST be able to specify the central
      frequency to be used for\n   reverse-direction traffic.\n   As described in
      [G.694.1], the allowed frequency slots for the\n   flexible DWDM grid have a
      nominal central frequency (in THz),\n   defined by:\n      193.1 + n * 0.00625\n
      \     where n is zero or a positive or negative integer.\n   The slot width
      (in GHz) is defined as:\n      12.5 * m\n      where m is a positive integer.\n
      \  It is possible that an implementation supports only a subset of the\n   possible
      slot widths and central frequencies.  For example, an\n   implementation can
      be built that is\n   1. limited to have a nominal central frequency granularity
      of\n      12.5 GHz, by only allowing values of n that are even, and\n   2. further
      limited to only support slot widths of 25 GHz, by only\n      allowing values
      of m that are even.\n   Further details can be found in [RFC7698].\n"

    - "4.1.  Traffic Parameters\n   In RSVP-TE, the SENDER_TSPEC object in the Path
      message indicates the\n   requested resource reservation.  The FLOWSPEC object
      in the Resv\n   message indicates the actual resource reservation.  As described
      in\n   Section 3.1, the slot width represents how much frequency resource is\n
      \  requested for a flexi-grid LSP.  That is, it describes the end-to-end\n   traffic
      profile of the LSP.  Therefore, the traffic parameters for a\n   flexi-grid
      LSP encode the slot width.\n   This document defines new Class Types (C-Types)
      for the SENDER_TSPEC\n   and FLOWSPEC objects to carry Spectrum-Switched Optical
      Network\n   (SSON) traffic parameters:\n      SSON SENDER_TSPEC: Class = 12,

      GHz.\n   The Reserved bits MUST be set to zero and ignored upon receipt.\n"

      - "4.1.1.  Applicability to Fixed-Grid Networks\n   Note that the slot width
        (i.e., traffic parameters) of a fixed grid\n   defined in [G.694.1] can also
        be specified by using the SSON traffic\n   parameters.  The fixed-grid channel
        spacings (12.5 GHz, 25 GHz,\n   50 GHz, 100 GHz, and integer multiples of
        100 GHz) are also the\n   multiples of 12.5 GHz, so the m parameter can be
        used to represent\n   these slot widths.\n   Therefore, it is possible to
        consider using the new traffic parameter\n   object types in common signaling
        messages for flexi-grid and legacy\n   DWDM networks.\n"

      in any\n   RSVP-TE object or sub-object that can carry a label.\n   As noted
      in Section 4.2 of [RFC7699], the m parameter forms part of\n   the label as
      well as part of the traffic parameters.\n   As described in Section 4.3 of [RFC7699],
      a \"compound label\",\n   constructed from a concatenation of the flexi-grid
      labels, is used\n   when signaling an LSP that uses multiple flexi-grid slots.\n"
