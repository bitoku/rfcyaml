Abstract This document describes the set of Microsoft vendor specific RADIUS attributes.
These attributes are designed to support Microsoft proprietary dial up protocols and/or provide support for features which is not provided by the standard RADIUS attribute set [3].
It is expected that this memo will be updated whenever Microsoft defines a new vendor specific attribute, since its primary purpose is to provide an open, easily accessible reference for third parties wishing to interoperate with Microsoft products.
In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional", "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" are to be interpreted as described in [2].
The following sections describe sub attributes which may be transmitted in one or more RADIUS attributes of type Vendor Specific [3].
More than one sub attribute MAY be transmitted in a single Vendor Specific Attribute; if this is done, the sub attributes SHOULD be packed as a sequence of Vendor Type/Vendor Length/Value triples following the inital Type, Length and Vendor ID fields.
The Length field of the Vendor Specific Attribute MUST be set equal to the sum of the Vendor Length fields of the sub attributes contained in the Vendor Specific Attribute, plus six.
The Vendor ID field of the Vendor Specific Attribute(s) MUST be set to decimal 311 (Microsoft).
Attributes for Support of MS CHAP Version 1 2.1.1.
Introduction Microsoft created Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS CHAP) [4] to authenticate remote Windows workstations, providing the functionality to which LAN based users are accustomed.
Where possible, MS CHAP is consistent with standard CHAP [5], and the differences are easily modularized.
Briefly, the differences between MS CHAP and standard CHAP are:
MS CHAP is enabled by negotiating CHAP Algorithm 0x80 in LCP option 3, Authentication Protocol.
The MS CHAP Response packet is in a format designed for compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0, Microsoft Windows95, and Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x networking products.
The MS CHAP format does not require the authenticator to store a clear text or reversibly encrypted password.
MS CHAP provides an authenticator controlled authentication retry mechanism.
MS CHAP provides an authenticator controlled password changing mechanism.
MS CHAP defines an extended  set of reason for failure codes, returned in the Failure packet Message field.
The attributes defined in this section reflect these differences.
This Attribute contains the challenge sent by a NAS to a Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS CHAP) user.
It MAY be used in both Access Request and Access Challenge packets.

Attributes for Support of MS CHAP Version 2 2.3.1.
This section describes RADIUS attributes supporting version two of Microsoft's PPP CHAP dialect (MS CHAP V2)
MS CHAP V2 is similar to, but incompatible with, MS CHAP version one (MS CHAP V1) [4].
Certain protocol fields have been deleted or reused but with different semantics.
Where possible, MS CHAP V2 is consistent with both MS CHAP V1 and standard CHAP [1].
Briefly, the differences between MS CHAP V2 and MS CHAP V1 are:
MS CHAP V2 is enabled by negotiating CHAP Algorithm 0x81 in LCP option 3, Authentication Protocol.
MS CHAP V2 provides mutual authentication between peers by piggybacking a peer challenge on the Response packet and an authenticator response on the Success packet.
The calculation of the "Windows NT compatible challenge response" sub field in the Response packet has been changed to include the peer challenge and the user name.
In MS CHAP V1, the "LAN Manager compatible challenge response" sub field was always sent in the Response packet.
This field has been replaced in MS CHAP V2 by the Peer Challenge field.
The format of the Message field in the Failure packet has been changed.
The Change Password (version 1) and Change Password (version 2)
packets are no longer supported.
They have been replaced with a single Change Password packet.
The attributes defined in this section reflect these differences.

This section describes a set of Attributes designed to support the use of Microsoft Point to Point Encryption (MPPE) [6] in dial up networks.
MPPE is a means of representing Point to Point Protocol (PPP)
[7] packets in a encrypted form.
MPPE uses the RSA RC4 [8] algorithm for encryption.
The length of the session key to be used for initializing encryption tables can be negotiated; MPPE currently supports 40 bit and 128 bit session keys.
MPPE is negotiated within option 18 in the PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)[9], [10].

The Keys field consists of two logical sub fields: the LM Key and the NT Key.
The LM Key is eight octets in length and contains the first eight bytes of the output of the function LmPasswordHash(P, This hash is constructed as follows:
let the plain text password be represented by P. The NT Key sub field is sixteen octets in length and contains the first sixteen octets of the hashed Windows NT password.
The format of the plaintext Keys field is illustrated in the following diagram:
The Keys field MUST be encrypted by the RADIUS server using the same method defined for the User Password Attribute [3].
Padding is required because the method referenced above requires the field to be encrypted to be a multiple of sixteen octets in length.
This attribute should only be returned in response to an Access Request packet containing MS CHAP attributes.
MS MPPE Send Key Description
The MS MPPE Send Key Attribute contains a session key for use by the Microsoft Point to Point Encryption Protocol (MPPE).
As the name implies, this key is intended for encrypting packets sent from the NAS to the remote host.

The fields are transmitted left to right. 0
3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
Vendor Type 16 for MS MPPE Send Key.
The Salt field is two octets in length and is used to ensure the uniqueness of the keys used to encrypt each of the encrypted attributes occurring in a given Access Accept packet.
The most significant bit (leftmost) of the Salt field MUST be set (1).
The contents of each Salt field in a given Access Accept packet MUST be unique.
The plaintext String field consists of three logical sub fields: the Key Length and Key sub fields (both of which are required), and the optional Padding sub field.
The Key Length sub field is one octet in length and contains the length of the unencrypted Key sub field.
The Key sub field contains the actual encryption key.
If the combined length (in octets) of the unencrypted Key Length and Key sub fields is not an even multiple of 16, then the Padding sub field MUST be present.
If it is present, the length of the Padding sub field is variable, between 1 and 15 octets.
The String field MUST be encrypted as follows, prior to transmission: Construct a plaintext version of the String field by concate  nating the Key Length and Key sub fields.
If necessary, pad the resulting string until its length (in octets) is an even multiple of 16.
It is recommended that zero octets (0x00) be used for padding.
the shared secret S, the pseudo random 128 bit Request Authenticator (from the corresponding Access Request packet) R, and the contents of the Salt field A.  Break P into 16 octet chunks p(1), p(2)...p(i), where i
Call the ciphertext blocks c(1), c(2)...c(i) and the final ciphertext C. Intermediate values b(1), b(2)...c(i) are required.
The   resulting   encrypted   String   field    will    contain c(1)
On receipt, the process is reversed to yield the plaintext String.
It is possible that the length of the key returned may be larger than needed for the encryption scheme in use.
In this case, the RADIUS client is responsible for performing any necessary truncation.
This attribute MAY be used to pass a key from an external (e.g., EAP [15]) server to the RADIUS server.
In this case, it may be impossible for the external server to correctly encrypt the key,
since the RADIUS shared secret might be unavailable.
The external server SHOULD, however, return the attribute as defined above; the Salt field SHOULD be zero filled and padding of the String field SHOULD be done.
When the RADIUS server receives the attribute from the external server, it MUST correctly set the Salt field and encrypt the String field before transmitting it to the RADIUS client.
If the channel used to communicate the MS MPPE Send Key attribute is not secure from eavesdropping, the attribute MUST be cryptographically protected.

If the combined length (in octets) of the unencrypted Key Length and Key sub fields is not an even multiple of 16, then the Padding sub field MUST be present.
If it is present, the length of the Padding sub field is variable, between 1 and 15 octets.
The String field MUST be encrypted as follows, prior to transmission: Construct a plaintext version of the String field by concatenating the Key Length and Key sub fields.
If necessary, pad the resulting string until its length (in octets) is an even multiple of 16.
It is recommended that zero octets (0x00) be used for padding.
the shared secret S, the pseudo random 128 bit Request Authenticator (from the corresponding Access Request packet) R, and the contents of the Salt field A.  Break P into 16 octet chunks p(1), p(2)...p(i), where i
Call the ciphertext blocks c(1), c(2)...c(i) and the final ciphertext C. Intermediate values b(1), b(2)...c(i) are required.
On receipt, the process is reversed to yield the plaintext String.
It is possible that the length of the key returned may be larger than needed for the encryption scheme in use.

Security Considerations MS CHAP, like PPP CHAP, is susceptible to dictionary attacks.
User passwords should be chosen with care, and be of sufficient length to deter easy guessing.
Although the scheme used to protect the Keys field of the MS CHAP  MPPE Keys, MS MPPE Send Key and MS MPPE Recv Key Attributes is believed to be relatively secure on the wire, RADIUS proxies will decrypt and re encrypt the field for forwarding.
Therefore, these attributes SHOULD NOT be used on networks where untrusted RADIUS proxies reside.
