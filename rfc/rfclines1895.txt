Abstract This memorandum provides guidelines for using the United States Department of Defense Military Standard MIL STD 1840, "Automated Interchange of Technical Information," with the Internet electronic mail standards, RFC 822 and RFC 1521.
Electronic mail provides a more convenient mechanism that delivery via physical media for certain types and quantities of data.
Software already exists to support data exchanges based on MIL STD 1840 and it can continue to be used in conjunction with electronic mail exchanges defined in this document.
This document defines a new media type and a MIME message structure for exchanging data in conformance with MIL STD 1840.
The United States Department of Defense (DOD) has defined a standard, MIL STD 1840 [1840], for the exchange of digital data.
Most applications of that standard use 9 track tape as the transport medium.
The Application/CALS 1840 media type is proposed to facilitate such exchanges using the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [MIME] and network based transport media, i.e. electronic mail [822].
This memo has been reviewed and authorized by the Continuous Acquistion and Life cycle Support (CALS)
CALS is a US DOD initiative for the use and exchange of digital data.
The Industry Steering Group, which consists of members drawn from government and industry, guides the development of CALS standards such as [1840].
An [1840] exchange consists of a set of files with well defined file names (see below).
Each set consists of a declaration file and one or more data files.
The data files, in turn, consist of header records immediately followed by the data.
The data itself may be formatted in accordance with a published specification or a contractual agreement.
MIL STD 1840 encodes the file's data type in the file name.
It might seem appropriate to transform the 1840 headers into MIME headers and use the appropriate media type, essentially transforming the 1840 files into MIME body parts.
There are three reasons for not doing that.
First, not all of the "types" used in [1840] are registered MIME types.
Second, there exists an installed base of software capable of reading the 1840 formatted files and processing the data appropriately.
Finally the three existing revisions to the standard have maintained the same file structure.
Consequently, a processor for the data may be able to handle any one of the standard's revisions.
Thus, a single Application/CALS 1840 is being proposed and its body part body contains headers and data in the [1840] format.
A set of related files constitutes a "transfer unit" in 1840 and each transfer unit shall correspond to a Multipart/Mixed MIME entity.
Included in each transfer unit is a declaration file which shall be the first body part in the Multipart/Mixed entity.
Several transfer units may be included in a single MIME message.
The following form is copied from RFC 1590, Appendix A for the purpose of registering this media type.
Any valid MIME encodings my be used Security considerations:

The filename parameter gives the transfer unit filename as defined by [1840].
The parameter's value, called <1840 name>, has the syntax given by the grammer below.
limited to the set defined in ; the appropriate version of ; [1840, Table III]
1840 tuseq :  1840 seq 1840 dfseq :
1840 seq 1840 seq   :
alphnum alphnum alphnum alphanum   :
/ "9" / All Application/CALS 1840 body parts in a single Multipart/Mixed MIME entity shall have the same <1840 tuseq>.
Within a single message all filename values shall be unique.
Tuseq and dfseq correspond to transfer unit sequence number and data file sequence number respectively.
The filename for a declaration file has the form "D" 1840 tuseq and for data files, the form "D" 1840 tuseq <letter> 1840 dfseq.
The specversion parameter's value shall indicate the particular version of MIL STD 1840 to which the data conforms.
Valid values are: MIL STD 1840C, 0, 199XXXXX MIL STD 1840B, 0, 19921103 MIL STD 1840A, 0,
The value "199XXXXX" is to be replaced with the actual issue date for MIL STD 1840C. (2)
In the example below a single transfer unit is provided.
It consists of three data files, the declaration, a contract defined file and an IGES file.
The headers and data are in accordance with MIL STD  1840B.
The content transfer encoding perserves the data file's fixed record length.

Security Considerations None of the body parts, as constitued, represent executable data.
When the 1840 file format is processed the resultant data may be executable.
Processing will be under the control of the process associated with Application/CALS 1840.
