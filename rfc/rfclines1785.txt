Abstract The TFTP option negotiation mechanism, proposed in [1], is a backward compatible extension to the TFTP protocol, defined in [2].
It allows file transfer options to be negotiated prior to the transfer using a mechanism which is consistent with TFTP's Request Packet format.
The mechanism is kept simple by enforcing a request
respond acknowledge sequence, similar to the lock step approach taken by TFTP itself.
This document was written to allay concerns that the presence of options in a TFTP Request packet might cause pathological behavior on servers which do not support TFTP option negotiation.
A TFTP client, modified to send TFTP options, was tested against five unmodified servers:
DEC   DEC 3000/400 alpha   OSF1
Model 320    AIX 3.4 SUN
In each case, the servers ignored the option information in the Request packet and the transfer proceeded as though no option negotiation had been attempted.
In addition, the standard BSD4.3 source for TFTPD, the starting point for many implementations, was examined.
The code clearly ignores any extraneous information in Request packets.
From these results and examinations, it is clear that the TFTP option negotiation mechanism is fully backward compatible with unmodified TFTP servers.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
