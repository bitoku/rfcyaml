  - "Abstract\n   In some instances, Service Providers (SPs) have a legal logging\n\
    \   requirement to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the\n   address\
    \ used on the public Internet (e.g., for abuse response).\n   Unfortunately, many\
    \ logging solutions for Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs)\n   require active logging of\
    \ dynamic translations.  CGN port assignments\n   are often per connection, but\
    \ they could optionally use port ranges.\n   Research indicates that per-connection\
    \ logging is not scalable in\n   many residential broadband services.  This document\
    \ suggests a way to\n   manage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly\
    \ reduce the\n   amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse\n\
    \   response.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred solution.  While\n   deployment\
    \ is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives to\n   maintain support\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain new IPv4\
    \ address\n   assignments from Regional/Local Internet Registries due to depleting\n\
    \   supplies of unallocated IPv4 address space.  To meet the growing\n   demand\
    \ for Internet connectivity from new subscribers, devices, and\n   service types,\
    \ some operators will be forced to share a single public\n   IPv4 address among\
    \ multiple subscribers using techniques such as\n   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) [RFC6264]\
    \ (e.g., NAT444 [NAT444], Dual-Stack\n   Lite (DS-Lite) [RFC6333], NAT64 [RFC6146],\
    \ etc.).  However, address\n   sharing poses additional challenges to operators\
    \ when considering how\n   they manage service entitlement, public safety requests,\
    \ or\n   attack/abuse/fraud reports [RFC6269].  In order to identify a\n   specific\
    \ user associated with an IP address in response to such a\n   request or for\
    \ service entitlement, an operator will need to map a\n   subscriber's internal\
    \ source IP address and source port with the\n   global public IP address and\
    \ source port provided by the CGN for\n   every connection initiated by the user.\n\
    \   CGN connection logging satisfies the need to identify attackers and\n   respond\
    \ to abuse/public safety requests, but it imposes significant\n   operational\
    \ challenges to operators.  In lab testing, we have\n   observed CGN log messages\
    \ to be approximately 150 bytes long for\n   NAT444 [NAT444] and 175 bytes for\
    \ DS-Lite [RFC6333] (individual log\n   messages vary somewhat in size).  Although\
    \ we are not aware of\n   definitive studies of connection rates per subscriber,\
    \ reports from\n   several operators in the US sets the average number of connections\n\
    \   per household at approximately 33,000 connections per day.  If each\n   connection\
    \ is individually logged, this translates to a data volume\n   of approximately\
    \ 5 MB per subscriber per day, or about 150 MB per\n   subscriber per month; however,\
    \ specific data volumes may vary across\n   different operators based on myriad\
    \ factors.  Based on available\n   data, a 1-million-subscriber SP will generate\
    \ approximately 150\n   terabytes of log data per month, or 1.8 petabytes per\
    \ year.  Note\n   that many SPs compress log data after collection; compression\
    \ factors\n   of 2:1 or 3:1 are common.\n   The volume of log data poses a problem\
    \ for both operators and the\n   public safety community.  On the operator side,\
    \ it requires a\n   significant infrastructure investment by operators implementing\
    \ CGN.\n   It also requires updated operational practices to maintain the\n  \
    \ logging infrastructure, and requires approximately 23 Mbps of\n   bandwidth\
    \ between the CGN devices and the logging infrastructure per\n   50,000 users.\
    \  On the public safety side, it increases the time\n   required for an operator\
    \ to search the logs in response to an abuse\n   report, and it could delay investigations.\
    \  Accordingly, an\n   international group of operators and public safety officials\n\
    \   approached the authors to identify a way to reduce this impact while\n   improving\
    \ abuse response.\n   The volume of CGN logging can be reduced by assigning port\
    \ ranges\n   instead of individual ports.  Using this method, only the assignment\n\
    \   of a new port range is logged.  This may massively reduce logging\n   volume.\
    \  The log reduction may vary depending on the length of the\n   assigned port\
    \ range, whether the port range is static or dynamic,\n   etc.  This has been\
    \ acknowledged in [RFC6269], which recommends the\n   logging of source ports\
    \ at the server and/or destination logging at\n   the CGN, and [NAT-LOGGING],\
    \ which describes information to be logged\n   at a NAT.\n   However, the existing\
    \ solutions still pose an impact on operators and\n   public safety officials\
    \ for logging and searching.  Instead, CGNs\n   could be designed and/or configured\
    \ to deterministically map internal\n   addresses to {external address + port\
    \ range} in such a way as to be\n   able to algorithmically calculate the mapping.\
    \  Only inputs and\n   configuration of the algorithm need to be logged.  This\
    \ approach\n   reduces both logging volume and subscriber identification times.\
    \  In\n   some cases, when full deterministic allocation is used, this approach\n\
    \   can eliminate the need for translation logging.\n   This document describes\
    \ a method for such CGN address mapping,\n   combined with block port reservations,\
    \ that significantly reduces the\n   burden on operators while offering the ability\
    \ to map a subscriber's\n   inside IP address with an outside address and external\
    \ port number\n   observed on the Internet.\n   The activation of the proposed\
    \ port range allocation scheme is\n   compliant with BEHAVE requirements such\
    \ as the support of\n   Application-specific functions (APP).\n"

- title: 2.  Deterministic Port Ranges
  contents:
  - "2.  Deterministic Port Ranges\n   While a subscriber uses thousands of connections\
    \ per day, most\n   subscribers use far fewer resources at any given time.  When\
    \ the\n   compression ratio (see Appendix B of RFC 6269 [RFC6269]) is low\n  \
    \ (e.g., the ratio of the number of subscribers to the number of public\n   IPv4\
    \ addresses allocated to a CGN is closer to 10:1 than 1000:1),\n   each subscriber\
    \ could expect to have access to thousands of TCP/UDP\n   ports at any given time.\
    \  Thus, as an alternative to logging each\n   connection, CGNs could deterministically\
    \ map customer private\n   addresses (received on the customer-facing interface\
    \ of the CGN,\n   a.k.a., internal side) to public addresses extended with port\
    \ ranges\n   (used on the Internet-facing interface of the CGN, a.k.a., external\n\
    \   side).  This algorithm allows an operator to identify a subscriber\n   internal\
    \ IP address when provided the public side IP and port number\n   without having\
    \ to examine the CGN translation logs.  This prevents an\n   operator from having\
    \ to transport and store massive amounts of\n   session data from the CGN and\
    \ then process it to identify a\n   subscriber.\n   The algorithmic mapping can\
    \ be expressed as:\n   (External IP Address, Port Range) = function 1 (Internal\
    \ IP Address)\n   Internal IP Address = function 2 (External IP Address, Port\
    \ Number)\n   The CGN SHOULD provide a method for administrators to test both\n\
    \   mapping functions (e.g., enter an External IP Address + Port Number\n   and\
    \ receive the corresponding Internal IP Address).\n   Deterministic Port Range\
    \ allocation requires configuration of the\n   following variables:\n   o  Inside\
    \ IPv4/IPv6 address range (I);\n   o  Outside IPv4 address range (O);\n   o  Compression\
    \ ratio (e.g., inside IP addresses I / outside IP\n      addresses O) (C);\n \
    \  o  Dynamic address pool factor (D), to be added to the compression\n      ratio\
    \ in order to create an overflow address pool;\n   o  Maximum ports per user (M);\n\
    \   o  Address assignment algorithm (A) (see below); and\n   o  Reserved TCP/UDP\
    \ port list (R)\n   Note: The inside address range (I) will be an IPv4 range in\
    \ NAT444\n   operation (NAT444 [NAT444]) and an IPv6 range in DS-Lite operation\n\
    \   (DS-Lite [RFC6333]).\n   A subscriber is identified by an internal IPv4 address\
    \ (e.g., NAT44)\n   or an IPv6 prefix (e.g., DS-Lite or NAT64).\n   The algorithm\
    \ may be generalized to L2-aware NAT [L2NAT], but this\n   requires the configuration\
    \ of the Internal interface identifiers\n   (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC)\
    \ addresses).\n   The algorithm is not designed to retrieve an internal host among\n\
    \   those sharing the same internal IP address (e.g., in a DS-Lite\n   context,\
    \ only an IPv6 address/prefix can be retrieved using the\n   algorithm while the\
    \ internal IPv4 address used for the encapsulated\n   IPv4 datagram is lost).\n\
    \   Several address-assignment algorithms are possible.  Using predefined\n  \
    \ algorithms, such as those that follow, simplifies the process of\n   reversing\
    \ the algorithm when needed.  However, the CGN MAY support\n   additional algorithms.\
    \  Also, the CGN is not required to support all\n   of the algorithms described\
    \ below.  Subscribers could be restricted\n   to ports from a single IPv4 address\
    \ or could be allocated ports\n   across all addresses in a pool, for example.\
    \  The following\n   algorithms and corresponding values of A are as follows:\n\
    \   0: Sequential (e.g., the first block goes to address 1, the second\n     \
    \ block to address 2, etc.).\n   1: Staggered (e.g., for every n between 0 and\
    \ ((65536-R)/(C+D))-1 ,\n      address 1 receives ports n*C+R, address 2 receives\
    \ ports\n      (1+n)*C+R, etc.).\n   2: Round robin (e.g., the subscriber receives\
    \ the same port number\n      across a pool of external IP addresses.  If the\
    \ subscriber is to\n      be assigned more ports than there are in the external\
    \ IP pool, the\n      subscriber receives the next highest port across the IP\
    \ pool, and\n      so on.  Thus, if there are 10 IP addresses in a pool and a\n\
    \      subscriber is assigned 1000 ports, the subscriber would receive a\n   \
    \   range such as ports 2000-2099 across all 10 external IP\n      addresses).\n\
    \   3: Interlaced horizontally (e.g., each address receives every Cth\n      port\
    \ spread across a pool of external IP addresses).\n   4: Cryptographically random\
    \ port assignment (Section 2.2 of RFC6431\n      [RFC6431]).  If this algorithm\
    \ is used, the SP needs to retain the\n      keying material and specific cryptographic\
    \ function to support\n      reversibility.\n   5: Vendor-specific.  Other vendor-specific\
    \ algorithms may also be\n      supported.\n   The assigned range of ports MAY\
    \ also be used when translating ICMP\n   requests (when rewriting the Identifier\
    \ field).\n   The CGN then reserves ports as follows:\n   1.  The CGN removes\
    \ reserved ports (R) from the port candidate list\n       (e.g., 0-1023 for TCP\
    \ and UDP).  At a minimum, the CGN SHOULD\n       remove system ports [RFC6335]\
    \ from the port candidate list\n       reserved for deterministic assignment.\n\
    \   2.  The CGN calculates the total compression ratio (C+D), and\n       allocates\
    \ 1/(C+D) of the available ports to each internal IP\n       address.  Specific\
    \ port allocation is determined by the algorithm\n       (A) configured on the\
    \ CGN.  Any remaining ports are allocated to\n       the dynamic pool.\n     \
    \  Note: Setting D to 0 disables the dynamic pool.  This option\n       eliminates\
    \ the need for per-subscriber logging at the expense of\n       limiting the number\
    \ of concurrent connections that 'power users'\n       can initiate.\n   3.  When\
    \ a subscriber initiates a connection, the CGN creates a\n       translation mapping\
    \ between the subscriber's inside local IP\n       address/port and the CGN outside\
    \ global IP address/port.  The CGN\n       MUST use one of the ports allocated\
    \ in step 2 for the translation\n       as long as such ports are available. \
    \ The CGN SHOULD allocate\n       ports randomly within the port range assigned\
    \ by the\n       deterministic algorithm.  This is to increase subscriber privacy.\n\
    \       The CGN MUST use the pre-allocated port range from step 2 for\n      \
    \ Port Control Protocol (PCP, [RFC6887]) reservations as long as\n       such\
    \ ports are available.  While the CGN maintains its mapping\n       table, it\
    \ need not generate a log entry for translation mappings\n       created in this\
    \ step.\n   4.  If D>0, the CGN will have a pool of ports left for dynamic\n \
    \      assignment.  If a subscriber uses more than the range of ports\n      \
    \ allocated in step 2 (but fewer than the configured maximum ports\n       M),\
    \ the CGN assigns a block of ports from the dynamic assignment\n       range for\
    \ such a connection or for PCP reservations.  The CGN\n       MUST log dynamically\
    \ assigned port blocks to facilitate\n       subscriber-to-address mapping.  The\
    \ CGN SHOULD manage dynamic\n       ports as described in [LOG-REDUCTION].\n \
    \  5.  Configuration of reserved ports (e.g., system ports) is left to\n     \
    \  operator configuration.\n   Thus, the CGN will maintain translation mapping\
    \ information for all\n   connections within its internal translation tables;\
    \ however, it only\n   needs to externally log translations for dynamically assigned\
    \ ports.\n"

    \ external geolocation\n   providers to recalibrate their mappings.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Deterministic CGN Example
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Deterministic CGN Example\n   To illustrate the use of deterministic NAT,\
    \ let's consider a simple\n   example.  The operator configures an inside address\
    \ range (I) of\n   198.51.100.0/28 [RFC6598] and outside address (O) of 192.0.2.1.\
    \  The\n   dynamic address pool factor (D) is set to '2'.  Thus, the total\n \
    \  compression ratio is 1:(14+2) = 1:16.  Only the system ports (e.g.,\n   ports\
    \ < 1024) are reserved (R).  This configuration causes the CGN to\n   pre-allocate\
    \ ((65536-1024)/16 =) 4032 TCP and 4032 UDP ports per\n   inside IPv4 address.\
    \  For the purposes of this example, let's assume\n   that they are allocated\
    \ sequentially, where 198.51.100.1 maps to\n   192.0.2.1 ports 1024-5055, 198.51.100.2\
    \ maps to 192.0.2.1 ports\n   5056-9087, etc.  The dynamic port range thus contains\
    \ ports\n   57472-65535 (port allocation illustrated in the table below).\n  \

    \   58100-58199, 58200-58299, ..., 58900-58999.\n   In order to identify a subscriber\
    \ behind a CGN (regardless of port\n   allocation method), public safety agencies\
    \ need to collect source\n   address and port information from content provider\
    \ log files.  Thus,\n   content providers are advised to log source address, source\
    \ port, and\n   timestamp for all log entries, per [RFC6302].  If a public safety\n\
    \   agency collects such information from a content provider and reports\n   abuse\
    \ from 192.0.2.1, port 2001, the operator can reverse the mapping\n   algorithm\
    \ to determine that the internal IP address subscriber 1 has\n   been assigned\
    \ generated the traffic without consulting CGN logs (by\n   correlating the internal\
    \ IP address with DHCP/PPP lease connection\n   records).  If a second abuse report\
    \ comes in for 192.0.2.1, port\n   58204, the operator will determine that port\
    \ 58204 is within the\n   dynamic pool range, consult the log file, correlate\
    \ with connection\n   records, and determine that subscriber 2 generated the traffic\n\
    \   (assuming that the public safety timestamp matches the operator\n   timestamp.\
    \  As noted in RFC 6292 [RFC6292], accurate timekeeping\n   (e.g., use of NTP\
    \ or Simple NTP) is vital).\n   In this example, there are no log entries for\
    \ the majority of\n   subscribers, who only use pre-allocated ports.  Only minimal\
    \ logging\n   would be needed for those few subscribers who exceed their pre-\n\
    \   allocated ports and obtain extra bulk port assignments from the\n   dynamic\
    \ pool.  Logging data for those users will include inside\n   address, outside\
    \ address, outside port range, and timestamp.\n   Note that in a production environment,\
    \ operators are encouraged to\n   consider [RFC6598] for assigning inside addresses.\n"

  - "3.  Additional Logging Considerations\n   In order to be able to identify a subscriber\
    \ based on observed\n   external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp, an operator\
    \ needs to know\n   how the CGN was configured with regard to internal and external\
    \ IP\n   addresses, dynamic address pool factor, maximum ports per user, and\n\
    \   reserved port range at any given time.  Therefore, the CGN MUST\n   generate\
    \ a record any time such variables are changed.  The CGN\n   SHOULD generate a\
    \ log message any time such variables are changed.\n   The CGN MAY keep such a\
    \ record in the form of a router configuration\n   file.  If the CGN does not\
    \ generate a log message, it would be up to\n   the operator to maintain version\
    \ control of router config changes.\n   Also, the CGN SHOULD generate such a log\
    \ message once per day to\n   facilitate quick identification of the relevant\
    \ configuration in the\n   event of an abuse notification.\n   Such a log message\
    \ MUST, at minimum, include the timestamp, inside\n   prefix I, inside mask, outside\
    \ prefix O, outside mask, D, M, A, and\n   reserved port list R; for example:\n\
    \   [Wed Oct 11 14:32:52\n   2000]:198.51.100.0:28:192.0.2.0:32:2:5040:0:1-1023,5004,5060.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Failover Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Failover Considerations\n   Due to the deterministic nature of algorithmically\
    \ assigned\n   translations, no additional logging is required during failover\n\
    \   conditions provided that inside address ranges are unique within a\n   given\
    \ failover domain.  Even when directed to a different CGN server,\n   translations\
    \ within the deterministic port range on either the\n   primary or secondary server\
    \ can be algorithmically reversed, provided\n   the algorithm is known.  Thus,\
    \ if 198.51.100.1 port 3456 maps to\n   192.0.2.1 port 1000 on CGN 1 and 198.51.100.1\
    \ port 1000 on Failover\n   CGN 2, an operator can identify the subscriber based\
    \ on outside\n   source address and port information.\n   Similarly, assignments\
    \ made from the dynamic overflow pool need to be\n   logged as described above,\
    \ whether translations are performed on the\n   primary or failover CGN.\n"
- title: 4.  Impact on the IPv6 Transition
  contents:
  - "4.  Impact on the IPv6 Transition\n   The solution described in this document\
    \ is applicable to CGN\n   transition technologies (e.g., NAT444, DS-Lite, and\
    \ NAT64).  As\n   discussed in [RFC7021], the authors acknowledge that native\
    \ IPv6 will\n   offer subscribers a better experience than CGN.  However, many\n\
    \   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices only support IPv4.\n   Likewise,\
    \ as of October 2014, only approximately 5.2% of the top 1\n   million websites\
    \ were available using IPv6.  Accordingly,\n   Deterministic CGN should in no\
    \ way be understood as making CGN a\n   replacement for IPv6 service; however,\
    \ until such time as IPv6\n   content and devices are widely available, Deterministic\
    \ CGN will\n   provide operators with the ability to quickly respond to public\n\
    \   safety requests without requiring excessive infrastructure,\n   operations,\
    \ and bandwidth to support per-connection logging.\n"
- title: 5.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Privacy Considerations\n   The algorithm described above makes it easier\
    \ for SPs and public\n   safety officials to identify the IP address of a subscriber\
    \ through a\n   CGN system.  This is the equivalent level of privacy users could\n\
    \   expect when they are assigned a public IP address and their traffic\n   is\
    \ not translated.  However, this algorithm could be used by other\n   actors on\
    \ the Internet to map multiple transactions to a single\n   subscriber, particularly\
    \ if ports are distributed sequentially.\n   While still preserving traceability,\
    \ subscriber privacy can be\n   increased by using one of the other values of\
    \ the Address Assignment\n   Algorithm (A), which would require interested parties\
    \ to know more\n   about the Service Provider's CGN configuration to be able to\
    \ tie\n   multiple connections to a particular subscriber.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations applicable to NAT\
    \ operation for various\n   protocols as documented in, for example, RFC 4787\
    \ [RFC4787] and RFC\n   5382 [RFC5382] also apply to this document.\n   Note that,\
    \ with the possible exception of cryptographically based\n   port allocations,\
    \ attackers could reverse-engineer algorithmically\n   derived port allocations\
    \ to either target a specific subscriber or to\n   spoof traffic to make it appear\
    \ to have been generated by a specific\n   subscriber.  However, this is exactly\
    \ the same level of security that\n   the subscriber would experience in the absence\
    \ of CGN.  CGN is not\n   intended to provide additional security by obscurity.\n"
