- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety\
    \ of\n   consumer electronic devices, such as television sets and television\n\
    \   set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving television programming\n   from\
    \ either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, or cable. In\n   this context\
    \ there is a need to reference television broadcasts using\n   the URI format\
    \ described in [RFC 2396]. This document describes a\n   widely-implemented URI\
    \ scheme to refer to such broadcasts.\n"
- title: 2. Television URI
  contents:
  - "2. Television URI\n   The basic structure of a television URI is:\n        tv:<broadcast>\n\
    \   where broadcast is a description of the data source. The description\n   takes\
    \ the form of a DNS-style identifier for a particular broadcaster\n   or television\
    \ network. For example:\n        tv:wqed.org           the WQED station\n    \
    \    tv:nbc.com            the NBC network\n"
- title: 3.1. Scheme-only form
  contents:
  - "3.1. Scheme-only form\n   A simplest form of the \"tv:\" URI scheme is used to\
    \ refer to the\n   \"current\" or \"default\" channel:\n        tv:\n   This URI\
    \ refers to whichever television broadcast is currently being\n   received by\
    \ the device. It is often used in combination with HTML\n   content that is actually\
    \ being broadcast along with the audio and\n   video, where the meaning of \"\
    current broadcast\" is quite unambiguous\n   (because it is the broadcast along\
    \ with which the content containing\n   the URI was received). This is in fact\
    \ the most common usage of the\n   \"tv:\" scheme today, and is explicitly referenced\
    \ by the recently\n   published specification of the Advanced Television Enhancement\
    \ Forum\n   [ATVEF 1.1].\n"
- title: 3.2 DNS-style identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.2 DNS-style identifiers\n   Television broadcasts traditionally have been identified\
    \ in a variety\n   of ways.  All terrestrial television broadcasters are assigned\
    \ call\n   signs (such as \"KDKA\" or \"WQED\") to identify their signal. These\
    \ are\n   generally assigned by national authorities (such as the Federal\n  \
    \ Communications Commission in the United States) and are world unique.\n   The\
    \ global namespace is managed by the International\n   Telecommunications Union,\
    \ which assigns portions to member countries\n   (see [ITU RR]).\n   Many modern\
    \ television networks are not broadcasted over-the-air, but\n   available only\
    \ through cable or satellite subscriptions.  The\n   identifiers for these networks\
    \ (such as the familiar \"CNN\" and \"HBO\")\n   are not regulated at this time.\
    \  In some countries, even over-the-air\n   broadcasters use these sorts of identifiers,\
    \ rather than call signs.\n   Unfortunately, these two namespaces overlap, with\
    \ most network\n   identifiers also being valid call signs.  Furthermore, network\n\
    \   identifiers are not world unique, and many cases exist of name\n   collisions.\
    \  (For example, both the Australian Broadcast Corporation\n   and the American\
    \ Broadcasting Company identify themselves as \"ABC\".)\n   In order to ensure\
    \ uniqueness, the \"tv:\" scheme uses DNS-style\n   identifiers for all broadcast\
    \ streams.  Because these build on the\n   existing registration system for DNS\
    \ hostname, all name collisions\n   can be resolved through the existing DNS dispute\
    \ resolution\n   processes.\n   In the simplest form, domain names themselves\
    \ are used as broadcast\n   identifiers.  For example:\n          tv:abc.com \
    \         the American Broadcast Company\n          tv:abc.co.au        the Australian\
    \ Broadcast Corporation\n   In some cases, networks have multiple broadcast streams\
    \ that need to\n   be distinguished.  This is also handled in DNS style:\n   \
    \       tv:east.hbo.com     HBO East\n          tv:west.hbo.com     HBO West\n\
    \   It is important to note that these DNS-style identifiers need not\n   match\
    \ real hostnames; they should not be resolved to IP addresses\n   using DNS. \
    \ Thus, using the terms as defined in RFC 2396, the \"tv:\"\n   scheme is a Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifier and not a Uniform Resource\n   Locator.\n   In order to\
    \ support these identifiers in a \"tv:\" URI, a receiver must\n   implement a\
    \ means to map known identifiers to frequencies. The nature\n   of this map and\
    \ the way in which it is used are currently browser-\n   and device-specific and\
    \ are beyond the scope of this document. In\n   this way, the \"tv:\" scheme is\
    \ somewhat analogous to the \"news:\" and\n   \"file:\" schemes in [1]: it merely\
    \ names a television broadcast signal\n   but assumes that the local browser has\
    \ some means for actually\n   retrieving that signal on the local device.  A variety\
    \ of software\n   systems currently provide device-specific mappings from such\n\
    \   identifiers to specific channel numbers or directly to frequencies.\n   These\
    \ systems can be incorporated into television sets or set-top\n   boxes to facilitate\
    \ the interpretation of television URIs by the\n   client device.\n"
- title: 3.3 Obsolete forms
  contents:
  - "3.3 Obsolete forms\n   Previous drafts of this specification allowed broadcasts\
    \ to be\n   identified by channel numbers, such as \"tv:4\", and this form is\n\
    \   currently supported by several independent platforms.  The channel\n   numbers\
    \ generally correspond to tuning frequencies in the various\n   national broadcast\
    \ frequency standards; for example, \"tv:4\" in the\n   United states would be\
    \ found at 66 MHz.  However, because this\n   mapping of channel numbers to frequencies\
    \ varies from country to\n   country, this form is particularly ill-suited to\
    \ use on the Internet.\n   Previous drafts also allowed network identifiers and\
    \ call signs to be\n   used directly as broadcast identifiers, as in \"tv:abc\"\
    \ and \"tv:kron\".\n   These forms should not be used because of the name collision\
    \ issues\n   described in the previous section.\n"
- title: 4. BNF for Television URIs
  contents:
  - "4. BNF for Television URIs\n   The following is a formal specification for the\
    \ new URIs:\n      tvuri          = \"tv:\" [ broadcast ]\n      broadcast   \
    \   = dns-identifier\n      dns-identifier = *( domainlabel \".\" ) toplabel [\
    \ \".\" ]\n      domainlabel    = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | \"-\" ) alphanum\n\
    \      toplabel       = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | \"-\" ) alphanum\n   The definitions\
    \ of alpha and alphanum are from [RFC 2396].\n   Furthermore, the definition of\
    \ dns-identifier is identical to the\n   definition of hostname in RFC 2396, and\
    \ is case-insensitive.\n"

  - "5. Acknowledgments\n   Many of the ideas in this document came out of conversations\
    \ with\n   Andrew Lochart. Other people who supplied valuable input include Matt\n\

    \ developed while the author was at Wink Communications.  More\n   recent suggestions\
    \ have come from Lee Acton, Jonathan Boltax, Dean\n   Blackketter, Michael Dolan,\
    \ Iain Hackett, Jim Helman, Sean McDowell,\n   David Mott, Scott Watson, and others\
    \ in the ATVEF Technical Working\n   Group (which the authors co-chaired), and\

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This new URI scheme is subject to the same security\
    \ implications as\n   the general URI scheme described in [RFC 2396]. It is possible\
    \ that\n   the mere act of viewing a television broadcast signal may cause costs\n\
    \   to be incurred to the viewer in some instances (e.g., \"pay-per-view\"\n \
    \  movies and events). Any software that uses this URI scheme to allow\n   automatic\
    \ tuning of a client device to a particular television\n   broadcast signal should\
    \ alert users before performing actions that\n   may incur costs to the user.\n"
