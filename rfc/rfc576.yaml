  - "                     Proposal for Modifying Linking\n   We plan to modify the\
    \ link jsys in TENEX to work in a little bit\n   better way in terms of the user\
    \ interface.  Conversations with BBN\n   indicate that they have no complaints\
    \ with the current\n   implementation.  However, if after we have gained experience\
    \ with our\n   new implementation, we will let them know about it and they will\n\
    \   review the new implementation and possibly accept it as part of\n   standard\
    \ TENEX.\n   I would appreciate feedback in the next couple of days so that I\
    \ can\n   go ahead and implement this proposal (or a modified proposal or\n  \
    \ nothing...).  (I estimate that it will only take a couple of hours to\n   implement!)\n\
    \   (Note that by modifying the jsys, the proposed changes as specified\n   will\
    \ be in effect at the user level in the exec.)\n   The default state for all users\
    \ will remain as it currently is, i.e.\n   RECEIVE LINKS.\n   Now, consider users\
    \ A, B, and C.\n   If A and B link to each other they are now holding a conversation.\n\
    \   After establishing a conversation, all members of the conversation\n   will\
    \ be placed in the REFUSE LINKS state.\n   If user C (or any other user) now tries\
    \ to link to user A (or B), the\n   bell will ring on users A (or B) and C terminals\
    \ indicating that A\n   (or B) is in a REFUSE LINKS state.\n      If A ignores\
    \ the bell then C is not admitted to the conversation\n      and A and B can continue\
    \ their conversation as if C had never\n      tried to enter the conversation.\n\
    \      However, if A does a RECEIVE LINKS while the bell is ringing (the\n   \
    \   bell rings for approximately 15 seconds), then C will be linked\n      into\
    \ the conversation and not to just user A.  Thus A and B will\n      be linked,\
    \ A and C will be linked, and B and C will be linked,\n      i.e., a three way\
    \ conversation.  Also, users A, B, and C will be\n      in the REFUSE LINKS state.\n\
    \   Whenever a user leaves a conversation, his state will be set\n   automatically\
    \ to RECEIVE LINKS.\n      Thus, when user C does a break links the resulting\
    \ states will be:\n         A and B will be linked and both will be in REFUSE\
    \ LINKS\n         C will be out of the conversation and will be in RECEIVE LINKS\n\
    \      Now, when A or B does a BREAK LINKS there will no longer be a\n      conversation\
    \ and both A and B will be in the RECEIVE LINKS state.\n   To summarize:\n   \
    \   After any conversation is established, all members of the\n      conversation\
    \ are placed in the REFUSED LINKS state.\n      When a user links to a terminal\
    \ or a user, he is in fact linking\n      into a conversation if one exists or\
    \ to an individual if no\n      conversation is taking place.\n      When a user\
    \ leaves a conversation, she is placed in the RECEIVE\n      LINKS state.\n  \
    \ Changes to the TLINK jsys will be necessary to implement the above.\n   No changes\
    \ are required in the EXEC.  In addition to the above\n   changes, we will add\
    \ a new jsys that will return the link and advise\n   status for a passed terminal,\
    \ i.e., you will be able to tell which\n   lines are linked to the passed terminal,\
    \ which lines the passed\n   terminal is linked to, which line the passed terminal\
    \ is advising,\n   and/or which line is advising the passed terminal.  This information\n\
    \   will probably be incorporated into the systat printout, the where is\n   printout,\
    \ and will probably be used within NLS for shared screen\n   work.\n         \
