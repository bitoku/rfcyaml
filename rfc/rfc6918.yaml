  - "Abstract\n   A number of ICMPv4 message types have become obsolete in practice,\n\
    \   but have never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates\n   such\
    \ ICMPv4 message types, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA\n   registry.\
    \  Additionally, it updates RFC 792 and RFC 950, obsoletes\n   RFC 1788, and requests\
    \ the RFC Editor to change the status of RFC\n   1788 to Historic.\n"
