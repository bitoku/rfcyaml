Abstract The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) search operation provides mechanisms for clients to request all user application attributes, all operational attributes, and/or attributes selected by their description.
This document extends LDAP to support a mechanism that LDAP clients may use to request the return of all attributes of an object class.
In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[RFC4510], the search operation [RFC4511]
supports requesting the return of a set of attributes.
This set is determined by a list of attribute descriptions.
However, there is no convenient mechanism for requesting pre defined sets of attributes such as the set of attributes used to represent a particular class of object.
This document extends LDAP to allow an object class identifier to be specified in attributes lists, such as in Search requests, to request the return of all attributes belonging to an object class.
For example, the attribute list of "@country" is equivalent to the attribute list of 'c', 'searchGuide', 'description', and 'objectClass'.
This object class is described in [RFC4519].
This extension is intended primarily to be used where the user is in direct control of the parameters of the LDAP search operation, for instance when entering an LDAP URL [RFC4516] into a web browser, such as <ldap:///dc example,dc com?@organization?base>. 2.
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
DSE stands for DSA specific Entry.
Return of All Attributes of an Object Class
This extension allows object class identifiers to be provided in the attributes field of the LDAP SearchRequest [RFC4511] or other request values of the AttributeSelection data type (e.g., attributes field in pre/post read controls [ReadEntry])
and/or <attributeSelector> production (e.g., attributes of an LDAP URL [RFC4516]).
For each object class identified in the attributes field, the request is to be treated as if each attribute allowed by that class (by "MUST" or "MAY", directly or by "SUP"erior) [RFC4512] were itself listed.
This extension extends the <attributeSelector>
[RFC4511] production as indicated by the following ABNF [RFC4234]: attributeSelector  / objectclassdescription objectclassdescription
> productions are as defined in [RFC4512].
The <oid> component of an <objectclassdescription> production identifies the object class by short name (descr) or object identifier (numericoid).
If the value of the <oid> component is unrecognized or does not refer to an object class, the object class description is to be treated as an unrecognized attribute description.
The <options> production is included in the grammar for extensibility purposes.
An object class description with an unrecognized or inappropriate option is to be treated as unrecognized.
Although object class description options and attribute description options share the same syntax, they are not semantically related.
This document does not define any object description option.
Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the object identifier (OID)
as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' [RFC4512] attribute in the root DSE.
Clients supporting this feature SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they know that the server supports it.
This extension provides a shorthand for requesting all attributes of an object class.
Because these attributes could have been listed individually, introduction of this shorthand is not believed to raise additional security considerations.
Implementors of this LDAP extension should be familiar with security considerations applicable to the LDAP search operation [RFC4511], as well as with general LDAP security considerations [RFC4510].
IANA Considerations Registration of the LDAP Protocol Mechanism [RFC4520] defined in this document has been completed.
