- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   Supporting MPLS TE over unnumbered links (i.e., links that do\
    \ not\n   have IP addresses) involves two components: (a) the ability to carry\n\
    \   (TE) information about unnumbered links in IGP TE extensions (ISIS or\n  \
    \ OSPF), and (b) the ability to specify unnumbered links in MPLS TE\n   signalling.\
    \  The former is covered in [GMPLS-ISIS, GMPLS-OSPF].  The\n   focus of this document\
    \ is on the latter.\n   Current signalling used by MPLS TE does not provide support\
    \ for\n   unnumbered links because the current signalling does not provide a\n\
    \   way to indicate an unnumbered link in its Explicit Route and Record\n   Route\
    \ Objects.  This document proposes simple procedures and\n   extensions that allow\
    \ RSVP-TE signalling [RFC3473] to be used with\n   unnumbered links.\n"
- title: 2. Link Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2. Link Identifiers\n   An unnumbered link has to be a point-to-point link. \
    \ An LSR at each\n   end of an unnumbered link assigns an identifier to that link.\
    \  This\n   identifier is a non-zero 32-bit number that is unique within the\n\
    \   scope of the LSR that assigns it.  If one is using OSPF or ISIS as\n   the\
    \ IGP in support of traffic engineering, then the IS-IS and/or OSPF\n   and RSVP\
    \ modules on an LSR must agree on the identifiers.\n   There is no a priori relationship\
    \ between the identifiers assigned to\n   a link by the LSRs at each end of that\
    \ link.\n   LSRs at the two end points of an unnumbered link exchange with each\n\
    \   other the identifiers they assign to the link.  Exchanging the\n   identifiers\
    \ may be accomplished by configuration, by means of a\n   protocol such as LMP\
    \ ([LMP]), by means of RSVP/CR-LDP (especially in\n   the case where a link is\
    \ a Forwarding Adjacency, see below), or by\n   means of IS-IS or OSPF extensions\
    \ ([ISIS-GMPLS], [OSPF-GMPLS]).\n   Consider an (unnumbered) link between LSRs\
    \ A and B.  LSR A chooses an\n   identifier for that link.  So does LSR B.  From\
    \ A's perspective, we\n   refer to the identifier that A assigned to the link\
    \ as the \"link\n   local identifier\" (or just \"local identifier\"), and to\
    \ the identifier\n   that B assigned to the link as the \"link remote identifier\"\
    \ (or just\n   \"remote identifier\").  Likewise, from B's perspective, the identifier\n\
    \   that B assigned to the link is the local identifier, and the\n   identifier\
    \ that A assigned to the link is the remote identifier.\n   In the context of\
    \ this document the term \"Router ID\" means a stable\n   IP address of an LSR\
    \ that is always reachable if there is any\n   connectivity to the LSR.  This\
    \ is typically implemented as a\n   \"loopback address\"; the key attribute is\
    \ that the address does not\n   become unusable if an interface on the LSR is\
    \ down.  In some cases\n   this value will need to be configured.  If one is using\
    \ the OSPF or\n   ISIS as the IGP in support of traffic engineering, then it is\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED for the Router ID to be set to the \"Router Address\" as\n   defined\
    \ in [OSPF-TE], or \"Traffic Engineering Router ID\" as defined\n   in [ISIS-TE].\n\
    \   This section is equally applicable to the case of unnumbered\n   component\
    \ links (see [LINK-BUNDLE]).\n"
- title: 3. Unnumbered Forwarding Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "3. Unnumbered Forwarding Adjacencies\n   If an LSR that originates an LSP advertises\
    \ this LSP as an unnumbered\n   Forwarding Adjacency in IS-IS or OSPF (see [LSP-HIER]),\
    \ or the LSR\n   uses the Forwarding Adjacency formed by this LSP as an unnumbered\n\
    \   component link of a bundled link (see [LINK-BUNDLE]), the LSR MUST\n   allocate\
    \ an identifier to that Forwarding Adjacency (just like for\n   any other unnumbered\
    \ link).  Moreover, the Path message used for\n   establishing the LSP that forms\
    \ the Forwarding Adjacency MUST contain\n   the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object\
    \ (described below), with the LSR's\n   Router ID set to the head end's Router\
    \ ID, and the Interface ID set\n   to the identifier that the LSR allocated to\
    \ the Forwarding Adjacency.\n   If the Path message contains the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID\
    \ object, then\n   the tail-end LSR MUST allocate an identifier to that Forwarding\n\
    \   Adjacency (just like for any other unnumbered link).  Furthermore,\n   the\
    \ Resv message for the LSP MUST contain an LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID\n   object,\
    \ with the LSR's Router ID set to the tail-end's Router ID, and\n   the Interface\
    \ ID set to the identifier allocated by the tail-end LSR.\n   For the purpose\
    \ of processing the ERO and the IF_ID RSVP_HOP objects,\n   an unnumbered Forwarding\
    \ Adjacency is treated as an unnumbered (TE)\n   link or an unnumbered component\
    \ link as follows.  The LSR that\n   originates the Adjacency sets the link local\
    \ identifier for that link\n   to the value that the LSR allocates to that Forwarding\
    \ Adjacency, and\n   the link remote identifier to the value carried in the Interface\
    \ ID\n   field of the Reverse Interface ID object.  The LSR that is a tail-end\n\
    \   of that Forwarding Adjacency sets the link local identifier for that\n   link\
    \ to the value that the LSR allocates to that Forwarding\n   Adjacency, and the\
    \ link remote identifier to the value carried in the\n   Interface ID field of\
    \ the Forward Interface ID object.\n"

- title: 4.1. Processing the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object
  contents:
  - "4.1. Processing the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object\n   When an LSR receives a Path message\
    \ containing the IF_ID RSVP_HOP\n   object (see [RFC3473], [RFC3471]) with the\
    \ IF_INDEX TLV, the LSR\n   processes this TLV as follows.  The LSR must have\
    \ information about\n   the identifiers assigned by its neighbors to the unnumbered\
    \ links\n   between the neighbors and the LSR.  The LSR uses this information\
    \ to\n   find a link with tuple <Router ID, local identifier> matching the\n \
    \  tuple <IP Address, Interface ID> carried in the IF_INDEX TLV.  If the\n   matching\
    \ tuple is found, the match identifies the link for which the\n   LSR has to perform\
    \ label allocation.\n   Otherwise, the LSR SHOULD return an error using the IF_ID\
