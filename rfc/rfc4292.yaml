    \ Base\n   (MIB) for use in managing objects related to the forwarding of\n  \

    \ be noted that the MIB definition described herein does not\n   support multiple\

    \ an instance of the MIB per address family.\n"

- title: 3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   The MIB consists of one current table and two current global\
    \ objects.\n      1. The object inetCidrRouteNumber indicates the number of current\n\
    \         routes.  This is primarily to avoid having to read the table in\n  \
    \       order to determine this number.\n      2. The object inetCidrRouteDiscards\
    \ counts the number of valid\n         routes that were discarded from inetCidrRouteTable\
    \ for any\n         reason.  This object replaces the ipRoutingDiscards and\n\
    \         ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects.\n      3. The inetCidrRouteTable provides\
    \ the ability to display IP\n         version-independent multipath CIDR routes.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB definition contains several deprecated\
    \ and obsolete tables\n   and objects.  The following subsections describe the\
    \ relationship\n   between these objects and other MIB modules.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  RFC 1213
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  RFC 1213\n   The ipRouteTable object was originally defined in RFC 1213\
    \ [RFC1213].\n   It was updated by ipForwardTable in RFC 1354 [RFC1354].\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  RFC 1354
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  RFC 1354\n   The ipForwardTable object replaced the ipRouteTable object\
    \ from RFC\n   1213.  It was in turn obsoleted by the ipCidrRouteTable defined\
    \ in\n   RFC 2096 [RFC2096].\n   In addition, RFC 1354 introduced ipForwardNumber.\
    \  This object\n   reflects the number of entries found in ipForwardTable.  It\
    \ was\n   obsoleted by ipCidrRouteNumber, defined in RFC 2096.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  RFC 2096
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  RFC 2096\n   In RFC 2096, the ipCidrRouteTable and ipCidrRouteNumber\
    \ were\n   introduced.  The ipCidrRouteTable object supports multipath IP routes\n\
    \   having the same network number but differing network masks.  The\n   number\
    \ of entries in that table is reflected in ipCidrRouteNumber.\n   These objects\
    \ are deprecated by the definitions contained in this MIB\n   definition.\n"
- title: 4.1.4.  RFC 2011 and 2465
  contents:
  - "4.1.4.  RFC 2011 and 2465\n   RFC 2011 [RFC2011] contains the ipRoutingDiscards\
    \ object, which\n   counts the number of valid routes that have been removed from\
    \ the\n   ipCidrRouteTable object.  The corresponding ipv6DiscardedRoutes\n  \
    \ object is defined in RFC 2465 [RFC2465].  These objects are\n   deprecated in\
    \ favor of the version-independent object\n   inetCidrRouteDiscards defined in\
    \ this MIB.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \      1. The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding\n         information\
    \ that is critical to the operation of the network\n         node (especially\
    \ routers).  Allowing unauthenticated write\n         access to this table can\
    \ compromise the validity of the\n         forwarding information.\n   Some of\
    \ the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS\
    \ other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in\
    \ some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or\
    \ NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of\
    \ these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the\
    \ tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      1. The inetCidrRouteTable\
    \ contains routing and forwarding\n         information that can be used to compromise\
    \ a network.\n         Specifically, this table can be used to construct a map\
    \ of the\n         network in preparation for a denial-of-service attack on the\n\
    \         network infrastructure.\n      2. The inetCidrRouteProto object identifies\
    \ the routing protocols\n         in use within a network.  This information can\
    \ be used to\n         determine how a denial-of-service attack should be launched.\n\
    \   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even\
    \ if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then,\
    \ there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access\
    \ and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n  \
    \ provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full\
    \ support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and\
    \ privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"

  - "7.  Changes from RFC 2096\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2096 in the following\
    \ ways:\n      1. Replaces ipCidrRouteTable with inetCidrRouteTable.  This\n \
    \        applies to corresponding objects and conformance statements.\n      2.\
    \ Utilizes the InetAddress TC to support IP version-independent\n         implementations\
    \ of the forwarding MIB.  This gives common\n         forwarding MIB support for\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6.\n      3. Creates a read-only conformance statement to support\n\
    \         implementations that only wish to retrieve data.\n      4. Creates the\
    \ inetCidrRouteDiscards object to replace the\n         deprecated ipRoutingDiscards\
    \ and ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects.\n   The inetCidrRouteTable retains the logical\
    \ structure of the\n   ipCidrRouteTable in order to allow the easy upgrade of\
    \ existing IPv4\n   implementations to the version-independent MIB.\n"
