- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This section describes the basic model of RObust Header Compression\n\
    \   (ROHC, [RFC3095]) used when developing the MIB modules for ROHC\n   described\
    \ in the following sections.\n   ROHC presents a framework for IP header compression\
    \ that allows\n   flexible adjustment of compression efficiency versus robustness\n\
    \   against channel errors depending on the underlying channel\n   characteristics.\n\
    \   ROHC introduces header compressors/decompressors at the end-points\n   (interfaces)\
    \ of (wireless) channels on which packets with compressed\n   headers are transferred.\
    \  ROHC exploits the temporal redundancy in\n   successive packet headers of a\
    \ packet flow by storing non-changing\n   fields of the headers as well as reference\
    \ values of predictably\n   changing fields as context information.  When the\
    \ context information\n   for a packet flow is also established at the decompressor,\
    \ only\n   delta-information and unpredictably changing header fields have to\
    \ be\n   sent over the channel.\n   This document specifies MIB modules in order\
    \ to provide a means for\n   managing ROHC implementations via SNMP and within\
    \ the IETF management\n   framework.  The objects defined support configuration\
    \ management,\n   fault management and performance monitoring.\n   For configuration\
    \ management implementation parameters (see Section\n   6.3 of [RFC3095]) and\
    \ configuration parameters (including the ones\n   specified in Section 5.1.1\
    \ of [RFC3095] and in Section 5.1.1 of\n   [RFC3242]) can be verified by using\
    \ the MIB modules specified below.\n   For fault management compressor/decompressor\
    \ state and mode can be\n   checked.\n   For performance management a set of statistics\
    \ is provided including\n   the number of flows that have used ROHC, the current\
    \ and long term\n   compression ratio, the number of reinitializations and the\
    \ number of\n   packets sent or received with different header types.\n"
- title: 4.  Structure of the MIB modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Structure of the MIB modules\n   This section presents the structure of the\
    \ MIB modules that are\n   specified in Section 5.  Basically, the MIB is structured\
    \ according\n   to the ROHC architecture described in [RFC3759].\n   ROHC is an\
    \ evolving technology.  [RFC3095] specifies the header\n   compression framework\
    \ and four profiles: uncompressed, RTP, UDP, and\n   ESP (Real-Time Transport\
    \ Protocol, User Datagram Protocol,\n   Encapsulating Security Payload).  [RFC3242]\
    \ specifies a profile with\n   additional link layer assistance called LLA (Link\
    \ Layer Assisted).  A\n   profile for compression of TCP (Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol) flows\n   is under development within the ROHC working group and SCTP\
    \ (Stream\n   Control Transmission Protocol) compression is being discussed as\n\
    \   potential next candidate.  Therefore, the managed objects defined\n   below\
    \ are structured into three MIB modules: the general ROHC-MIB\n   module and the\
    \ profile-specific ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB and ROHC-RTP-\n   MIB modules.  This\
    \ flexible approach allows to support future\n   profiles each by its own profile-specific\
    \ module.\n   The ROHC-MIB module defines properties of information on ROHC\n\
    \   instances, ROHC channels, ROHC profiles, and ROHC compressor and\n   decompressor\
    \ contexts.  All managed objects in this module are\n   assumed to be shared by\
    \ all profiles.\n   The ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB by managed\n\
    \   objects that are specific to the ROHC uncompressed profile 0x0000\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC3095].  The ROHC-RTP-MIB module extends the ROHC-MIB\n   by managed objects\
    \ that are specific to the three profiles defined in\n   [RFC3095] (ROHC RTP profile\
    \ 0x0001, ROHC UDP profile 0x0002, and ROHC\n   ESP profile 0x0003), and to the\
    \ ROHC LLA profile 0x0005 defined in\n   [RFC3242].  An analysis of these profiles\
    \ showed that they are\n   tightly related and can share most of the managed objects\
    \ in the\n   ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module.  Therefore, a joint module for all\
    \ of\n   them was preferred to individual modules.\n   The number of managed objects\
    \ in the ROHC-UNCOMPRESSED-MIB Module and\n   the ROHC-RTP-MIB Module is rather\
    \ small.  They contain context state\n   and context mode, and profile-specific\
    \ context statistics.  It is\n   assumed that MIB modules for future profiles,\
    \ such as TCP and SCTP,\n   will be similarly small and easy to design.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The ROHC-MIB module
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The ROHC-MIB module\n   The ROHC-MIB module defines managed objects that\
    \ are expected to be\n   useful for all current and future ROHC profiles.  Objects\
    \ in the\n   ROHC-MIB module are arranged into four tables: the rohcChannelTable,\n\
    \   the rohcInstanceTable, the rohcProfileTable, and the\n   rohcContextTable.\
    \  The managed objects in the first three tables are\n   rather static (except\
    \ for provided statistics), while the objects in\n   the rohcContextTable are\
    \ more dynamic.\n   All tables are indexed by the IP interface number and by a\
    \ numeric\n   channel identifier.  The channel identifier is used for channels\
    \ to\n   which compressors and decompressors are attached (called ROHC\n   channels\
    \ in [RFC3759]), as well as for dedicated feedback channels\n   (called ROHC feedback\
    \ channels in [RFC3759]).  Compressor and\n   decompressor instances are further\
    \ indexed by their type (either\n   compressor or decompressor).  Contexts are\
    \ indexed by the same index\n   as their corresponding instance and their individual\
    \ context\n   identifier (CID).\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  rohcChannelTable
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  rohcChannelTable\n   The rohcChannelTable lists all channels used by\
    \ ROHC instances for\n   transferring compressed packets and/or for giving feedback\
    \ from the\n   decompressor to the compressor.  Listed channels are either ROHC\n\
    \   channels or feedback channels as defined in [RFC3759].  The channels\n   are\
    \ listed per IP interface.\n   The information per channel in the rohcChannelTable\
    \ includes\n   o  the channel ID,\n   o  the channel type, either 'notInUse',\
    \ 'rohc', or\n      'dedicatedFeedback',\n   o  the channel for which feedback\
    \ is provided by this channel (if\n      applicable),\n   o  a string for describing\
    \ the channel, and\n   o  the status of the channel being either 'enabled' or\
    \ 'disabled'.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  rohcInstanceTable
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  rohcInstanceTable\n   The rohcInstanceTable defines properties of ROHC\
    \ compressor instances\n   and ROHC decompressor instances.\n   As described in\
    \ [RFC3759], an instance is associated with exactly one\n   channel and only one\
    \ instance can be associated with the same\n   channel.  Therefore, the same index\
    \ consisting of ifIndex and\n   rohcChannelID could have been used for both tables.\
    \  But when\n   accessing the rohcInstanceTable (and the rohcContextTable that\
    \ shares\n   a part of its index with the rohcInstanceTable) there are many cases\n\
    \   where either a compressor contexts or a decompressor contexts are of\n   interest.\
    \  Therefore, the rohcInstanceType indicating either a\n   compressor or a decompressor\
    \ was added to the table's index.  This\n   allows listing all compressors without\
    \ accessing any decompressor.\n   Note that still the combination of ifIndex and\
    \ rohcChannelID uniquely\n   identifies an instance.  It is always possible to\
    \ directly identify\n   and access the channel corresponding to a given instance.\n\
    \   The set of instance properties in the rochInstanceTable includes\n   o  the\
    \ vendor of the implementation, version number and description,\n   o  the channels\
    \ used for compressed packets and for feedback,\n   o  implementation and configuration\
    \ properties including clock\n      resolution, maximum context identifier number\
    \ (MAX_CID), the\n      LARGE_CIDS flag, and the Maximum Reconstructed Reception\
    \ Unit\n      (MRRU),\n   o  the storage time for contexts created by this instance,\n\
    \   o  the status of the instance (operational or not).\n   Optionally, the rohcInstanceTable\
    \ also contains instance statistics\n   including\n   o  the total number of compressed\
    \ flows,\n   o  the current number of compressed flows,\n   o  the total number\
    \ of packets passing this instance\n   o  the total number of static Initialization\
    \ and Refreshes (IRs)\n      passing this instance\n   o  the total number of\
    \ dynamic Initialization and Refreshes (IR-DYNs)\n      passing this instance,\
    \ and\n   o  the total compression ratio achieved on the channel.\n   Instances\
    \ are listed per IP interface.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  rohcProfileTable\n   The rohcProfileTable lists available profiles per\
    \ instance including\n   information on\n   o  the profile number,\n   o  the\
    \ vendor and version number, and\n   o  a string describing the profile.\n   o\
    \  a flag indicating whether or not using this profile has been\n      negotiated\

  contents:

    \ new\n   row in this table is created.  After expiration or termination of a\n\

    \ expires or until the CID is re-used.  Then the row will be\n   deleted.\n  \
    \ For each context, the following attributes are listed:\n   o  the type of context\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The managed objects defined by the ROHC-MIB module,\
    \ the ROHC-\n   UNCOMPRESSED-MIB module and the ROHC-RTP-MIB module do not have\
    \ a\n   MAX-ACCESS value of read-write and/or read-create except\n   rohcInstanceContextStorageTime\
    \ and rohcContextStorageTime, both of\n   which have a MAX-ACCESS value of read-write.\
    \  These objects determine\n   how long context information is stored after its\
    \ termination.\n   Unauthorized access to these objects can have one of two negative\n\
    \   effects.  If they are set to a value lower than required, e.g., to\n   zero,\
    \ then context information about past contexts might get lost.\n   If they are\
    \ set to a very high value, then context information will\n   not be deleted and\
    \ memory consumption of the agent implementation\n   might become very high. \
    \ However, unauthorized access to these\n   objects cannot cause harm to existing\
    \ ROHC connections nor can it\n   allow manipulation of running instances of ROHC\
    \ in a malicious way.\n   Another security issue is unauthorized access to readable\
    \ objects in\n   the MIB modules for getting information about existing communication\n\
    \   sessions.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY\n   access\
    \ to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of\n   these objects\
    \ when sending them over the network via SNMP.  However,\n   the only information\
    \ that might be disclosed is the use of channels.\n   Users and their addresses\
    \ are not visible in the MIB.  This\n   information can only be mis-used in conjunction\
    \ with the mis-use of\n   further information.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3\
    \ did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure\
    \ (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
