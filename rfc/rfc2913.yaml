  - "1. Introduction\n   In \"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets\" [1], an\
    \ expression\n   format is presented for describing media feature capabilities\
    \ as a\n   combination of simple media feature tags, registered according to\n\
    \   \"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure\" [2].  This provides a\n   format\
    \ for message handling agents to describe the media feature\n   content of messages\
    \ that they can handle.\n   This memo defines a media feature tag whose value\
    \ is a MIME content\n   type.  This allows the construction of feature expressions\
    \ that take\n   account of the MIME content type of the corresponding data.\n\
    \   Note that a content type feature value may contain parameters, but\n   this\
    \ is discouraged.  See section 3 and appendix A, \"Summary of the\n   media features\
    \ indicated\" for discussion of this point.\n"

    \      some set of media features described by a media feature\n         assertion,\

    \ the\n      design in greater depth.\n"
- title: 2. Motivation and goals
  contents:
  - "2. Motivation and goals\n   The media feature expression syntax [1] and feature\
    \ tags [2] were\n   designed with a view to providing content media information\
    \ that\n   augments basic MIME content type information.  There are some\n   situations\
    \ where it is useful to be able include that content type\n   information in a\
    \ media feature expression:\n   o  Media feature details may depend upon the content\
    \ type being used.\n      The media feature combining algebra and syntax [1] cannot\
    \ apply to\n      content type information unless it appears in the feature\n\
    \      expression.\n      For example, in HTTP 1.1 [4] with Transparent Content\
    \ Negotiation\n      (TCN) [5] acceptable content types and other media features\
    \ are\n      indicated in different request headers, with no clear way to\n  \
    \    indicate that they may be acceptable only in certain combinations.\n   o\
    \  It is sometimes useful for all media capability information to be\n      included\
    \ in a single expression.  For example, DSN and MDN\n      extensions [6] that\
    \ allow a recipient to indicate media\n      capabilities provide a single field\
    \ for conveying this\n      information.\n   o  When media features are used to\
    \ describe a message content, they\n      may refer to inner parts of a MIME composite;\
    \ e.g. the component\n      parts of a 'multipart', files in a compressed archive,\
    \ or\n      encrypted message data.\n"
- title: 3. MIME content type feature tag
  contents:
  - "3. MIME content type feature tag\n   Feature tag name    Legal values\n   ----------------\
    \    ------------\n   type                <string>\n                       containing\
    \ a MIME content-type value.\n   Reference: this document, appendix A.\n   The\
    \ 'type' feature tag indicates a MIME media content type (i.e.\n   that appears\
    \ in a 'Content-type:' header of the corresponding MIME-\n   formatted data).\
    \  It must be a string of the form \"type/subtype\",\n   where 'type' and 'subtype'\
    \ are defined by the MIME specification [7].\n   Only lower-case letters should\
    \ be used.\n   The content type must be given without any content-type parameter\n\
    \   values.\n   To include information in media feature expressions that is otherwise\n\
    \   conveyed in a MIME content-type parameter, a separate media feature\n   tag\
    \ should be registered [2] and used in the media feature\n   expression.  This\
    \ is illustrated by the use of 'charset' in the\n   example at 4.1 below -- the\
    \ 'charset' tag is defined by a separate\n   registration [10].\n      NOTE: \
    \ Allowing content-type parameters to be part of a type tag\n      value was considered,\
    \ but rejected because of concerns about\n      canonicalization, ordering, case\
    \ sensitivity, etc.  Only exact,\n      case-sensitive, character matching is\
    \ defined for media feature\n      expressions [1].\n"
