  - "Abstract\n   The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n\
    \   System, ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at the link layer for\n   point-to-point\
    \ links.  As a result, it does not use a three-way\n   handshake when establishing\
    \ adjacencies on point-to-point media.\n   This paper defines a backward-compatible\
    \ extension to the protocol\n   that provides for a three-way handshake.  It is\
    \ fully interoperable\n   with systems that do not support the extension.\n  \
    \ Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than\n   256\
    \ point-to-point links on a single router.\n   This extension has been implemented\
    \ by multiple router vendors; this\n   paper is provided to the Internet community\
    \ in order to allow\n   interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol [ISIS] assumes certain requirements stated\
    \ in ISO\n   10589 (section 6.7.2) for the operation of IS-IS over point-to-point\n\
    \   links and hence provides only a two-way handshake when establishing\n   adjacencies\
    \ on point-to-point links.  The protocol does not operate\n   correctly if these\
    \ subnetwork requirements for point-to-point links\n   are not met.  The basic\
    \ mechanism defined in the standard is that\n   each side declares the other side\
    \ to be reachable if a Hello packet\n   is heard from it.  Once this occurs, each\
    \ side then sends a Complete\n   Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) to trigger database\
    \ synchronization.\n   Three failure modes are known.  First, if the link goes\
    \ down and then\n   comes back up, or one of the systems restarts, and the CSNP\
    \ packet is\n   lost, and the network has a cut set of one through the link, the\
    \ link\n   state databases on either side of the link will not synchronize for\
    \ a\n   full Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) refresh period (up to 18\n  \
    \ hours).\n   A second, more serious failure is that if the link fails in only\
    \ one\n   direction, the failure will only be detected by one of the systems.\n\
    \   Normally only one of the two systems will announce the adjacency in\n   its\
    \ link state packets, and the SPF algorithm will thus ignore the\n   link.  However,\
    \ if there are two parallel links between systems and\n   one of them fails in\
    \ one direction, SPF will still calculate paths\n   between the two systems, and\
    \ the system that does not notice the\n   failure will attempt to pass traffic\
    \ down the failed link (in the\n   direction that does not work).\n   The third\
    \ issue is that on some physical layers, the\n   interconnectivity between endpoints\
    \ can change without causing a\n   link-layer-down condition.  In this case, a\
    \ system may receive\n   packets that are actually destined for a different system\
    \ (or a\n   different link on the same system).  The receiving system may end\
    \ up\n   thinking that it has an adjacency with the remote system when in fact\n\
    \   the remote system is adjacent with a third system.\n   The solution proposed\
    \ here ensures correct operation of the protocol\n   over unreliable point-to-point\
    \ links.  As part of the solution to the\n   three-way handshaking issue, a method\
    \ is defined to remove the\n   limitation of 255 point-to-point interfaces imposed\
    \ by IS-IS [ISIS].\n   This method is more robust than the ad hoc methods currently\
    \ in use.\n"

    \ three-way handshaking\n   provided and how more than 256 interfaces are handled.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Handshaking
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Handshaking\n   The intent is to provide a three-way handshake for point-to-point\n\
    \   adjacency establishment in a backward-compatible fashion.  This is\n   done\
    \ by providing an optional mechanism that allows each system to\n   report its\
    \ adjacency three-way state, thus allowing a system to only\n   declare an adjacency\
    \ to be up if it knows that the other system is\n   receiving its IS-IS Hello\
    \ (IIH) packets.\n   The adjacency three-way state can be one of the following\
    \ types:\n   Down\n      This is the initial point-to-point adjacency three-way\
    \ state.  The\n      system has not received any IIH packet containing the three-way\n\
    \      handshake option on this point-to-point circuit.\n   Initializing\n   \
    \   The system has received an IIH packet containing the three-way\n      handshake\
    \ option from a neighbor but does not know whether the\n      neighbor is receiving\
    \ its IIH packet.\n   Up\n      The system knows that the neighbor is receiving\
    \ its IIH packets.\n   The adjacency three-way state that is reported by this\
    \ mechanism is\n   not equal or equivalent to the adjacency state that is described\
    \ in\n   ISO 10589 [ISIS].  If this mechanism is supported, then an adjacency\n\
    \   may have two states, its state as defined in ISO 10589 [ISIS], and\n   its\
    \ three-way state.  For example, according to ISO 10589, receipt of\n   an Intermediate\
    \ System Hello (ISH) will cause an adjacency to go to\n   Initializing state;\
    \ however, receipt of an ISH will have no effect on\n   the three-way state of\
    \ an adjacency, which remains firmly Down until\n   it receives an IIH from a\
    \ neighbor that contains the three-way\n   handshaking option.\n   In addition,\
    \ the neighbor's system ID and (newly defined) extended\n   circuit ID are reported\
    \ in order to detect the case where the same\n   stream is being received by multiple\
    \ systems (only one of which can\n   talk back).\n   The mechanism is quite similar\
    \ to the one defined in the Netware Link\n   Services Protocol (NLSP) [NetLink],\
    \ a variant of IS-IS used for\n   routing Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) traffic.\
    \  The difference\n   between this mechanism and the one used in NLSP is the location\
    \ where\n   the information is carried (NLSP uses two of the reserved bits in\
    \ the\n   IIH header, whereas this solution adds a separate option to the IIH),\n\
    \   and the presence of the neighbor's system ID and circuit ID.  In\n   theory,\
    \ using the reserved header bits should be backward compatible,\n   since systems\
    \ are supposed to ignore them.  However, it was felt that\n   this was risky,\
    \ as the use of untested mechanisms such as this have\n   led to problems in the\
    \ past in other protocols.  New option codes, on\n   the other hand, have been\
    \ demonstrated to work properly, as the\n   deployment of Integrated IS-IS for\
    \ IP [RFC1195] has done exactly\n   this.\n   The new mechanism only comes into\
    \ play when the remote system\n   includes the new option in its IIH packet; if\
    \ the option is not\n   present, it is assumed that the system does not support\
    \ the new\n   mechanism, and so the old procedures are used.\n"
- title: 2.2.  More than 256 Interfaces
  contents:
  - "2.2.  More than 256 Interfaces\n   The IS-IS specification has an implicit limit\
    \ of 256 interfaces, as\n   constrained by the eight-bit Circuit ID field carried\
    \ in various\n   packets.  Moderately clever implementers have realized that the\
    \ only\n   true constraint is that of 256 LAN interfaces, and for that matter\n\
    \   only 256 LAN interfaces for which a system is the Designated IS.\n   This\
    \ is because the only place that the circuit ID is advertised in\n   LSPs is in\
    \ the pseudo-node LSP ID.\n   Implementers have treated the point-to-point circuit\
    \ ID number space\n   as being independent from that of the LAN interfaces, since\
    \ these\n   circuit IDs appear only in IIH PDUs and are only used for detection\n\
    \   of a change in identity at the other end of a link.  More than 256\n   point-to-point\
    \ interfaces have been supported by sending the same\n   circuit ID on multiple\
    \ interfaces.  This reduces the robustness of\n   the ID change detection algorithm,\
    \ since it would then be possible to\n   switch links between interfaces on a\
    \ system without detecting the\n   change.\n   Since the circuit ID is an integral\
    \ part of the new handshaking\n   mechanism, a backward-compatible mechanism for\
    \ expanding the circuit\n   ID number space is included in this specification.\n"

  - "3.2.  Elements of Procedure\n   The new handshake procedure is added to the IS-IS\
    \ point-to-point IIH\n   state machine after the PDU acceptance tests have been\
    \ performed.\n   Although the extended circuit ID is only used in the context\
    \ of the\n   three-way handshake, it is worth noting that it effectively protects\n\
    \   against the unlikely event where a link is moved to another interface\n  \
    \ on a system that has the same local circuit ID, because the received\n   PDUs\
    \ will be ignored (via the checks defined below) and the existing\n   adjacency\
    \ will fail.\n   Add a clause e) to the end of \"Receiving ISH PDUs by an intermediate\n\
    \   system\" (section 8.2.2 of [ISIS]):\n      Set the state to be reported in\
    \ the Adjacency Three-Way State\n      field of the Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency\
    \ option to Down.\n   Add a clause e) to the end of \"Sending point-to-point IIH\
    \ PDUs\"\n   (section 8.2.3 of [ISIS]):\n      The IS SHALL include the Point-to-Point\
    \ Three-Way Adjacency option\n      in the transmitted Point-to-Point IIH PDU.\
    \  The current three-way\n      state of the adjacency with its neighbor on the\
    \ link (as defined\n      in new section 8.2.4.1.1 introduced later in the document)\
    \ SHALL\n      be reported in the Adjacency Three-Way State field.  If no\n  \
    \    adjacency exists, the state SHALL be reported as Down.\n      The Extended\
    \ Local Circuit ID field SHALL contain a value assigned\n      by this IS when\
    \ the circuit is created.  This value SHALL be\n      unique among all the circuits\
    \ of this Intermediate System.  The\n      value is not necessarily related to\

    \ the system ID and Extended Local Circuit ID of the neighboring\n      system\
