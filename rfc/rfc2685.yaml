  - "1. Introduction\n   As the Public Internet expands and extends its infrastructure\n
    \  globally, the determination to exploit this infrastructure has led to\n   widespread
    interest in IP based Virtual Private Networks.  A VPN\n   emulates a private IP
    network over public or shared infrastructures.\n   Virtual Private Networks provide
    advantages to both the Service\n   Provider and its customers.  For its customers,
    a VPN can extend the\n   IP capabilities of a corporate site to remote offices
    and/or users\n   with intranet, extranet, and dialup services.  This connectivity\n
    \  should be achieved at a lower cost to the customer with savings in\n   capital
    equipment, operations, and services.   The Service Provider\n   is able to make
    better use of its infrastructure and network\n   administration expertise offering
    IP VPN connectivity and/or services\n   to its customers.\n   There are many ways
    in which IP VPN services may be implemented.  The\n   IP based VPN framework document
    [1] identifies four types of VPN to\n   be supported:  Virtual Leased Lines, Virtual
    Private Routed Networks,\n   Virtual Private Dial Networks, and Virtual Private
    LAN Segments.  In\n   addition, numerous drafts and white papers outline methods
    to be used\n   by Service Providers and/or Service Provider customers to enable
    this\n   service.  Solutions may be customer based or network based.  Network\n
    \  based solutions may provide connectivity and services at layer 2\n   and/or
    layer 3.  The devices involved in enabling the solution may be\n   Customer Premises
    Equipment (CPE), Service Provider Edge equipment,\n   Service Provider Core equipment,
    or some combination of these.\n   While the various methods of VPN service implementation
    are being\n   discussed and debated, there are two points on which there is\n
    \  agreement:\n    Because a VPN is private, it may use a private address space
    which\n    may overlap with the address space of another VPN or the Public\n    Internet.\n
    \   A VPN may span multiple IP Autonomous Systems (AS) or Service\n    Providers.\n
    \  The first point indicates that an IP address only has meaning within\n   the
    VPN in which it exists.  For this reason, it is necessary to\n   identify the
    VPN in which a particular IP address has meaning, the\n   \"scope\" of the IP
    address.\n   The second point indicates that several methods of VPN service\n
    \  implementation may be used to provide connectivity and services to a\n   single
    VPN.  Different service providers may employ different\n   strategies based on
    their infrastructure and expertise.  It is\n   desirable to be able to identify
    any particular VPN at any layer and\n   at any location in which it exists using
    the same VPN identifier.\n"

  - "2. Global VPN Identifier\n   The purpose of a VPN-ID is to identify a VPN.  This
    identifier may be\n   used in various ways depending on the method of VPN service\n
    \  implementation.  For example, the VPN-ID may be included:\n    - In a MIB to
    configure attributes to a VPN, or to assign a physical\n      or logical access
    interface to a particular VPN.\n    - In a control or data packet, to identify
    the \"scope\" of a private\n      IP address and the VPN to which the data belongs.\n
    \  It is necessary to be able to identify the VPN with which a data\n   packet
    is associated.  The VPN-ID may be used to make this\n   association, either explicitly
    (e.g. through inclusion of the VPN-ID\n   in an encapsulation header [2]) or implicitly
    (e.g. through inclusion\n   of the VPN-ID in a ATM signalling exchange [3]).  The
    appropriateness\n   of using the VPN-ID in other contexts needs to be carefully\n
    \  evaluated.\n   There is another very important function that may be served
    by the\n   VPN identifier.  The VPN identifier may be used to define the \"VPN\n
    \  authority\" who is responsible for coordinating the connectivity and\n   services
    employed by that VPN.  The VPN authority may be the Private\n   Network administrator
    or the primary Service Provider.  The VPN\n   authority will administer and serve
    as the main point of contact for\n   the VPN.  The authority may outsource some
    functions and\n   connectivity, set up contractual agreements with the different\n
    \  Service Providers involved, and coordinate configuration,\n   performance,
    and fault management.\n   These functions require a VPN that is global in scope
    and usable in\n   various solutions.  To be a truly global VPN identifier, the
    format\n   cannot force assumptions about the shared network(s). Conversely, the\n
    \  format should not be defined in such a way as to prohibit use of\n   features
    of the shared network.  It is necessary to note that the\n   same VPN may be identified
    at different layers of the same shared\n   network, e.g. ATM and IP layers.  The
    same VPN-ID format and value\n   should apply at both layers.\n   The methods
    of VPN-ID usage are beyond the scope of this memo.\n"

    meet the following requirements:\n    - Provide a globally unique VPN Identifier
    usable across\n      multiple Service Providers.\n    - Enable support of a non-IP
    dependent VPN-ID for use in\n      layer 2 VPNs.\n    - Identify the VPN Authority
    within the VPN Identifier.\n"

    VPN identifier without\n   specifying usage.  However, the association of particular\n
    \  characteristics and capabilities with a VPN identifier necessitates\n   use
    of standard security procedures with any specified usage.\n   Misconfiguration
    or deliberate forging of VPN identifier may result\n   different breaches in security
    including the interconnection of\n   different VPNs.\n"
