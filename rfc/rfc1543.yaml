    \  Introduction\n   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about\
    \ the\n   preparation of RFCs, and certain policies relating to the publication\n\
    \   of RFCs.\n   The RFC series of notes covers a broad range of interests.  The\
    \ core\n   topics are the Internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite.  However, any\n\
    \   topic related to computer communication may be acceptable at the\n   discretion\
    \ of the RFC Editor.\n   Memos proposed to be RFCs may be submitted by anyone.\
    \  One large\n   source of memos that become RFCs is the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF).  The IETF working groups (WGs) evolve their working\n\
    \   memos (known as Internet Drafts or I-Ds) until they feel they are\n   ready\
    \ for publication, then the memos are reviewed by the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG), and if approved sent by the IESG\n   to the RFC Editor.\n\
    \   RFCs are distributed online by being stored as public access files,\n   and\
    \ a short message is sent to the distribution list indicating the\n   availability\
    \ of the memo.\n   The online files are copied by the interested people and printed\
    \ or\n   displayed at their site on their equipment.  This means that the\n  \
    \ format of the online files must meet the constraints of a wide\n   variety of\
    \ printing and display equipment.  (RFCs may also be\n   returned via e-mail in\
    \ response to an e-mail query, or RFCs may be\n   found using information and\
    \ database searching tools such as Gopher,\n   Wais, WWW, or Mosaic.)\n   RFCs\
    \ have been traditionally published and continue to be published\n   in ASCII\
    \ text.\n   While the primary RFCs is always an ASCII text file, secondary or\n\
    \   alternative versions of RFC may be provided in PostScript.  This\n   decision\
    \ is motivated by the desire to include diagrams, drawings,\n   and such in RFCs.\
    \  PostScript documents (on paper only, so far) are\n   visually more appealing\
    \ and have better readability.\n   PostScript was chosen for the fancy form of\
    \ RFC publication over\n   other possible systems (e.g., impress, interpress,\
    \ oda) because of\n   the perceived wide spread availability of PostScript capable\n\
    \   printers.\n   However, many RFC users read the documents online and use various\n\
    \   text oriented tools (e.g., emacs, grep) to search them.  Often, brief\n  \
    \ excerpts from RFCs are included in e-mail.  These practices are not\n   yet\
    \ practical with PostScript files.\n   PostScript producing systems are less standard\
    \ than had been assumed\n   and that several of the document production systems\
    \ that claim to\n   produce PostScript actually produce nonstandard results.\n\
    \   In the future, it may be necessary to identify a set of document\n   production\
    \ systems authorized for use in production of PostScript\n   RFCs, based on the\
    \ reasonableness of the output files they generate.\n2.  Editorial Policy\n  \
    \ Documents proposed to be RFCs are reviewed by the RFC Editor and\n   possibly\
    \ by other reviewers he selects.\n   The result of the review may be to suggest\
    \ to the author some\n   improvements to the document before publication.\n  \
    \ Occasionally, it may become apparent that the topic of a proposed RFC\n   is\
    \ also the subject of an IETF Working Group, and that the author\n   could coordinate\
    \ with the working group to the advantage of both.\n   The usual result of this\
    \ is that a revised memo is produced as a\n   working group Internet Draft and\
    \ eventually emerges from the IETF\n   process as a recommendation from the IESG\
    \ to the RFC Editor.\n   In some cases it may be determined that the submitted\
    \ document is not\n   appropriate material to be published as an RFC.\n   In some\
    \ cases it may be necessary to include in the document a\n   statement based on\
    \ the reviews about the ideas in the document.  This\n   may be done in the case\
    \ that the document suggests relevant but\n   inappropriate or unsafe ideas, and\
    \ other situations.\n   The RFC Editor may make minor changes to the document,\
    \ especially in\n   the areas of style and format, but on some occasions also\
    \ to the\n   text.  Sometimes the RFC Editor will undertake to make more\n   significant\
    \ changes, especially when the format rules (see below) are\n   not followed.\
    \  However, more often the memo will be returned to the\n   author for the additional\
    \ work.\n   Documents intended to become RFCs specifying standards track\n   protocols\
    \ must be approved by the IESG before being sent to the RFC\n   Editor.  The established\
    \ procedure is that when the IESG completes\n   work on a document that is to\
    \ become a standards track RFC the\n   communication will be from the Secretary\
    \ of the IESG to the RFC\n   Editor.  Generally, the documents in question are\
    \ Internet Drafts.\n   The communication usually cites the exact Internet Draft\
    \ in question\n   (by file name).  The RFC Editor must assume that only that file\
    \ is to\n   be processed to become the RFC.  If the authors have small\n   corrections\
    \ to the text, they should be sent to the RFC Editor\n   separately (or as a \"\
    diff\"), do not send a new version of the\n   document.\n   In some cases, authors\
    \ prepare alternate secondary versions of RFCs\n   in fancy format using PostScript.\
    \  Since the ASCII text version of\n   the RFC is the primary version, the PostScript\
    \ version must match the\n   text version.  The RFC Editor must decide if the\
    \ PostScript version\n   is \"the same as\" the ASCII version before the PostScript\
    \ version can\n   be published.\n   The effect of this is that the RFC Editor\
    \ first processes the ASCII\n   version of the memo through to publication as\
    \ an RFC.  If the author\n   wishes to submit a PostScript version at that point\
    \ that matches the\n   ASCII version (and the RFC Editor agrees that it does),\
    \ then the\n   PostScript version will be installed in the RFC repositories and\n\
    \   announced to the community.\n   Due to various time pressures on the RFC Editorial\
    \ staff the time\n   elapsed between submission and publication can vary greatly.\
    \  It is\n   always acceptable to query (ping) the RFC Editor about the status\
    \ of\n   an RFC during this time (but not more than once a week).  The two\n \
    \  weeks preceding an IETF meeting are generally very busy, so RFCs\n   submitted\
    \ shortly before an IETF meeting are most likely to be\n   published after the\
    \ meeting.\n3.  Format Rules\n   To meet the distribution constraints, the following\
    \ rules are\n   established for the two allowed formats for RFCs:  ASCII and\n\
    \   PostScript.\n   The RFC Editor attempts to ensure a consistent RFC style.\
    \  To do this\n   the RFC Editor may choose to reformat the RFC submitted.  It\
    \ is much\n   easier to do this if the submission matches the style of the most\n\
    \   recent RFCs.  Please do look at some recent RFCs and prepare yours in\n  \
    \ the same style.\n   You must submit an editable online document to the RFC Editor.\
    \  The\n   RFC Editor may require minor changes in format or style and will\n\
    \   insert the actual RFC number.\n   Most of the RFCs are processed by the RFC\
    \ Editor with the unix\n   \"nroff\" program using a very simple set of the formatting\
    \ commands\n   (or \"requests\") from the \"ms\" macro package (see the appendix).\
    \  If a\n   memo submitted to be an RFC has been prepared by the author using\n\
    \   nroff, it is very helpful to let the RFC Editor know that when it is\n   submitted.\n\
    \   3a.  ASCII Format Rules\n      The character codes are ASCII.\n      Each\
    \ page must be limited to 58 lines followed by a form feed on a\n      line by\
    \ itself.\n      Each line must be limited to 72 characters followed by carriage\n\
    \      return and line feed.\n      No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n\
    \      These \"height\" and \"width\" constraints include any headers,\n     \
    \ footers, page numbers, or left side indenting.\n      Do not fill the text with\
    \ extra spaces to provide a straight right\n      margin.\n      Do not do hyphenation\
    \ of words at the right margin.\n      Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are\
    \ necessary, put them at\n      the end of a section, or at the end of the document.\n\
    \      Use single spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank line\n      between\
    \ paragraphs.\n      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page\
    \ numbers\n      on which various sections fall will likely change with\n    \
    \  reformatting.  Thus cross references in the text by section number\n      usually\
    \ are easier to keep consistent than cross references by\n      page number.\n\
    \      RFCs in ASCII Format may be submitted to the RFC Editor in e-mail\n   \
    \   messages (or as online files) in either the finished publication\n      format\
    \ or in NROFF.  If you plan to submit a document in NROFF\n      please consult\
    \ the RFC Editor first.\n   3b.  PostScript Format Rules\n      Standard page\
    \ size is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.\n      Margin of 1 inch on all sides (top, bottom,\
    \ left, and right).\n      Main text should have a point size of no less than\
    \ 10 points with\n      a line spacing of 12 points.\n      Footnotes and graph\
    \ notations no smaller than 8 points with a line\n      spacing of 9.6 points.\n\
    \      Three fonts are acceptable: Helvetica, Times Roman, and Courier.\n    \
    \  Plus their bold-face and italic versions.  These are the three\n      standard\
    \ fonts on most PostScript printers.\n      Prepare diagrams and images based\
    \ on lowest common denominator\n      PostScript.  Consider common PostScript\
    \ printer functionality and\n      memory requirements.\n      The following PostScript\
    \ commands should not be used:\n      initgraphics, erasepage, copypage, grestoreall,\
    \ initmatrix,\n      initclip, banddevice, framedevice, nulldevice and renderbands.\n\
    \      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers\n    \
    \  on which various sections fall will likely differ in the ASCII and\n      the\
    \ PostScript versions.  Thus cross references in the text by\n      section number\
    \ usually are easier to keep consistent than cross\n      references by page number.\n\
    \      These PostScript rules are likely to changed and expanded as\n      experience\
    \ is gained.\n      RFCs in PostScript Format may be submitted to the RFC Editor\
    \ in\n      e-mail messages (or as online files).  If you plan to submit a\n \
    \     document in PostScript please consult the RFC Editor first.\n      Note\
    \ that since the ASCII text version of the RFC is the primary\n      version,\
    \ the PostScript version must match the text version.  The\n      RFC Editor must\
    \ decide if the PostScript version is \"the same as\"\n      the ASCII version\
    \ before the PostScript version can be published.\n4.  Headers and Footers\n \
    \  There is the first page heading, the running headers, and the running\n   footers.\n\
    \   4a.  First Page\n      Please see the front page of this memo for an example\
    \ of the front\n      page heading.  On the first page there is no running header.\
    \  The\n      top of the first page has the following items:\n      Network Working\
    \ Group\n         The traditional heading for the group that founded the RFC\n\
    \         series.  This appears on the first line on the left hand side\n    \
    \     of the heading.\n      Request for Comments: nnnn\n         Identifies this\
    \ as a request for comments and specifies the\n         number.  Indicated on\
    \ the second line on the left side.  The\n         actual number is filled in\
    \ at the last moment before\n         publication by the RFC Editor.\n      Author\n\
    \         The author's name (first initial and last name only) indicated\n   \
    \      on the first line on the right side of the heading.\n      Organization\n\
    \         The author's organization, indicated on the second line on the\n   \
    \      right side.\n      Date\n         This is the Month and Year of the RFC\
    \ Publication. Indicated on\n         the third line on the right side.\n    \
    \  Updates or Obsoletes\n         If this RFC Updates or Obsoletes another RFC,\
    \ this is indicated\n         as third line on the left side of the heading.\n\
    \      Category\n         The category of this RFC, one of: Standards Track,\n\
    \         Informational, or Experimental.  This is indicated on the third\n  \
    \       (if there is no Updates or Obsoletes indication) or fourth line\n    \
    \     of the left side.\n      Title\n         The title appears, centered, below\
    \ the rest of the heading.\n      If there are multiple authors and if the multiple\
    \ authors are from\n      multiple organizations the right side heading may have\
    \ additional\n      lines to accommodate them and to associate the authors with\
    \ the\n      organizations properly.\n   4b.  Running Headers\n      The running\
    \ header in one line (on page 2 and all subsequent\n      pages) has the RFC number\
    \ on the left (RFC NNNN), the (possibly a\n      shortened form) title centered,\
    \ and the date (Month Year) on the\n      right.\n   4c.  Running Footers\n  \
    \    The running footer in one line (on all pages) has the author's\n      last\
    \ name on the left and the page number on the right ([Page N]).\n5.  Status Section\n\
    \   Each RFC must include on its first page the \"Status of this Memo\"\n   section\
    \ which contains a paragraph describing the type of the RFC.\n   The content of\
    \ this section will be one of the three following\n   statements.\n   Standards\
    \ Track\n      \"This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol\
    \ for\n      the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions\n\
    \      for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the\n      \"\
    Internet Official Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the\n      standardization\
    \ state and status of this protocol.  Distribution\n      of this memo is unlimited.\"\
    \n   Experimental\n      \"This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the\
    \ Internet\n      community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard\
    \ of any\n      kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.\n\
    \      Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\"\n   Informational\n      \"This\
    \ memo provides information for the Internet community.  This\n      memo does\
    \ not specify an Internet standard of any kind.\n      Distribution of this memo\
    \ is unlimited.\"\n6.  Introduction Section\n   Each RFC should have an Introduction\
    \ section that (among other\n   things) explains the motivation for the RFC and\
    \ (if appropriate)\n   describes the applicability of the protocol described.\n\
    \      Some example paragraphs are:\n         Protocol\n            This protocol\
    \ is intended to provide the bla-bla service,\n            and be used between\
    \ clients and servers on host computers.\n            Typically the clients are\
    \ on workstation hosts and the\n            servers on mainframe hosts.\n    \
    \        or\n            This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,\n\
    \            and be used between special purpose units such as terminal\n    \
    \        servers or routers and a monitoring host.\n         Discussion\n    \
    \        The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular\n      \
    \      problems in the Internet and possible methods of solution.\n          \
    \  No proposed solutions in this document are intended as\n            standards\
    \ for the Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a\n            general consensus\
    \ will emerge as to the appropriate solution\n            to such problems, leading\
    \ eventually to the adoption of\n            standards.\n         Interest\n \
    \           This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet\n       \
    \     community in order to solicit their reactions to the\n            proposals\
    \ contained in it.  While the issues discussed may\n            not be directly\
    \ relevant to the research problems of the\n            Internet, they may be\
    \ interesting to a number of researchers\n            and implementers.\n    \
    \     Status Report\n            In response to the need for maintenance of current\n\
    \            information about the status and progress of various\n          \
    \  projects in the Internet community, this RFC is issued for\n            the\
    \ benefit of community members.  The information contained\n            in this\
    \ document is accurate as of the date of publication,\n            but is subject\
    \ to change.  Subsequent RFCs will reflect such\n            changes.\n      These\
    \ paragraphs need not be followed word for word, but the\n      general intent\
    \ of the RFC must be made clear.\n7.  References Section\n   Nearly all RFCs contain\
    \ citations to other documents, and these are\n   listed in a References section\
    \ near the end of the RFC.  There are\n   many styles for references, and the\
    \ RFCs have one of their own.\n   Please follow the reference style used in recent\
    \ RFCs.  See the\n   reference section of this RFC for an example.  Please note\
    \ that for\n   protocols that have been assigned STD numbers, the STD number must\
    \ be\n   included in the reference.\n8.  Security Considerations Section\n   All\
    \ RFCs must contain a section near the end of the document that\n   discusses\
    \ the security considerations of the protocol or procedures\n   that are the main\
    \ topic of the RFC.\n9.  Author's Address Section\n   Each RFC must have at the\
    \ very end a section giving the author's\n   address, including the name and postal\
    \ address, the telephone number,\n   (optional: a FAX number) and the Internet\
    \ e-mail address.\n10.  Relation to other RFCs\n   Sometimes an RFC adds information\
    \ on a topic discussed in a previous\n   RFC or completely replaces an earlier\
    \ RFC.  There are two terms used\n   for these cases respectively, UPDATES and\
    \ OBSOLETES.  A document that\n   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its\
    \ own.  A document that\n   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on\
    \ its own; it is\n   something that must be added to or inserted into the previously\n\
    \   existing document, and has limited usefulness independently.  The\n   terms\
    \ SUPERSEDES and REPLACES are no longer used.\n   UPDATES\n      To be used as\
    \ a reference from a new item that cannot be used\n      alone (i.e., one that\
    \ supplements a previous document), to refer\n      to the previous document.\
    \  The newer publication is a part that\n      will supplement or be added on\
    \ to the existing document; e.g., an\n      addendum, or separate, extra information\
    \ that is to be added to\n      the original document.\n   OBSOLETES\n      To\
    \ be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by\n      this document.\
    \  This document contains either revised information,\n      or else all of the\
    \ same information plus some new information,\n      however extensive or brief\
    \ that new information is; i.e., this\n      document can be used alone, without\
    \ reference to the older\n      document.\n      For example:\n         On the\
    \ Assigned Numbers RFCs the term OBSOLETES should be used\n         since the\
    \ new document actually incorporate new information\n         (however brief)\
    \ into the text of existing information and is\n         more up-to-date than\
    \ the older document, and hence, replaces it\n         and makes it OBSOLETE.\n\
    \   In lists of RFCs or the RFC-Index (but not on the RFCs themselves)\n   the\
    \ following may be used with early documents to point to later\n   documents.\n\
    \   OBSOLETED-BY\n      To be used to refer to the newer document(s) that replaces\
    \ the\n      older document.\n   UPDATED-BY\n      To be used to refer to the\

    11.  Protocol Standards Process\n   See the current \"Internet Official Protocol\
    \ Standards\" (STD 1) memo\n   for the definitive statement on protocol standards\
    \ and their\n   publication [1].\n   The established procedure is that when the\
    \ IESG completes work on a\n   document that is to become a standards track RFC\
    \ the communication\n   will be from the Secretary of the IESG to the RFC Editor.\
    \  Generally,\n   the documents in question are Internet Drafts.  The communication\n\
    \   usually cites the exact Internet Draft (by file name) in question.\n   The\
    \ RFC Editor must assume that only that file is to be processed to\n   become\
    \ the RFC.  If the authors have small corrections to the text,\n   they should\
    \ be sent to the RFC Editor separately (or as a \"diff\"), do\n   not send a new\
    \ version of the document.\n12.  Contact\n   To contact the RFC Editor send an\
    \ email message to\n         \"RFC-Editor@ISI.EDU\".\n13.  Distribution Lists\n\
    \   The RFC announcements are distributed via two mailing lists: the\n   \"IETF-Announce\"\
    \ list, and the \"RFC-DIST\" list.  You don't want to be\n   on both lists.\n\
    \   To join (or quit) the IETF-Announce list send a message to IETF-\n   Request@cnri.reston.va.us.\n\
    \   To join (or quit) the RFC-DIST list send a message to RFC-\n   Request@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n\
    14.  RFC Index\n   Several organizations maintain RFC Index files, generally using\
    \ the\n   file name \"rfc-index.txt\".  The contents of such a file copied from\n\
    \   one site may not be identical to that copied from another site.\n15.  Security\
    \ Considerations\n   This RFC raises no security issues (however, see Section\
    \ 6).\n16.  References\n   [1]  Postel, J., \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\"\

    \ we use the very simplest nroff features.  We use the \"ms\"\n   macros.  So,\
    \ \"nroff -ms input-file > output-file\".  However, we could\n   not get nroff\
    \ to do the right thing about putting a form feed after\n   the last visible line\
    \ on a page and no extra line feeds before the\n   first visible line of the next\
    \ page.  We want:\n        last visible line on page i\n        ^L\n        first\
    \ visible line on page i+1\n   So, we invented some hacks to fix this including\
    \ a \"sed\" script\n   called \"fix.sh\" and a \"c\" program we called \"pg\"\
    \ (pg is called from\n   fix).  So the command to process the file becomes:\n\
    \        nroff -ms input-file | fix.sh > output-file\n   Now as to the nroff features\
    \ we actually use, I'll append a sample\n   memo, prepared in RFC style.\n   The\
    \ sed script fix.sh is:\n        sed -e 's/FORMFEED\\[Page/        \\[Page/' $*\

    \ of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers\n.ti 0\nStatus of this Memo\n.fi\n.in 3\n\
    This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of IP\ndatagrams\
    \ in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily useful\nin Metropolitan\
    \ Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not recommended\nstandard.  Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n.ti 0\nOverview and Rational\nAvian carriers can\
    \ provide high delay, low throughput, and low\naltitude service.  The connection\
    \ topology is limited to a single\npoint-to-point path for each carrier, used\
    \ with standard carriers, but\nmany carriers can be used without significant interference\
    \ with each\nother, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether\
    \ space\navailable to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by\nIEEE802.3.\
    \  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system,\nwhich increases\
    \ availability.  Unlike some network technologies, such\nas packet radio, communication\
    \ is not limited to line-of-sight\ndistance.  Connection oriented service is available\
    \ in some cities,\nusually based upon a central hub topology.\n.ti 0\nFrame Format\n\
    The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in\nhexadecimal, with\
    \ each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.\nThe scroll of paper is wrapped\
    \ around one leg of the avian carrier.\nA band of duct tape is used to secure\
    \ the datagram's edges.  The\nbandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU\
    \ is variable, and\nparadoxically, generally increases with increased carrier\
    \ age.  A\ntypical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.\n\
    Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the\ndatagram is\
    \ optically scanned into a electronically transmittable\nform.\n.ti 0\nDiscussion\n\
    Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking\norder. \
    \ An additional property is built-in worm detection and\neradication.  Because\
    \ IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of\na carrier can be tolerated.\
    \  With time, the carriers are\nself-regenerating.  While broadcasting is not\
    \ specified, storms can\ncause data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry,\
    \ until the\ncarrier drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can\n\
    often be found on logs and cable trays.\n.ti 0\nSecurity Considerations\n.in 3\n\
    Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special\nmeasures\
    \ must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers\nare used in a tactical\
    \ environment.\n.ti 0\nAuthor's Address\n.nf\nDavid Waitzman\nBBN Systems and\
