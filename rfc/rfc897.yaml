  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation\
    \ of the Domain\n   Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is a partial\
    \ update\n   of RFC 881.  This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and\
    \ the\n   DARPA.\n   The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for the\n\

  - "The Current Situation\n   Simple Names\n      Hosts in the ARPA research and\
    \ DDN operational communities are\n      currently assigned names in a flat or\
    \ global name space of\n      character strings.  There are some limits on these\
    \ names.  They\n      must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit and\
    \ have only\n      letters or digits or hyphen as interior characters.  Case is\
    \ not\n      significant.\n         For example:  USC-ISIF\n   Tables\n      Every\
    \ host in the Internet is expected to have a way of\n      translating the name\
    \ of any other host into its Internet address.\n      By and large, the name to\
    \ address translation is done by looking\n      up the information in a table\
    \ of all hosts.\n      The maintenance of this table is centralized at the Network\n\
    \      Information Center (NIC).  Each host is expected to obtain a\n      current\
    \ copy of the table on a timely basis.\n   Interface to the World\n      A great\
    \ deal of mail moves between the Internet and other\n      \"systems\" that somehow\
    \ transport mail among computers.  This is\n      currently done by hiding some\
    \ sort of \"other-system\" addressing\n      information in the local-part of\
    \ the mail address and using a\n      mail-relay host in the host-part of the\
    \ mailbox.\n"

  contents:
  - "The Future Situation\n   Hierarchical Names\n      Because of the growth of the\
    \ Internet, structured names (or domain\n      style names) will be used.  Each\
    \ element of the structured name\n      will be a character string (with the same\
    \ constraints that\n      previously applied to the simple names).\n         For\
    \ example:  F.ISI.USC.ARPA\n   Servers\n      Every host in the Internet will\
    \ be expected to have a way of\n      translating the name of any other host into\
    \ its Internet address.\n      By and large, the name to address translation will\
    \ be done by\n      interacting with a service.  There will be a number of servers\n\
    \      that each hold a portion of the name to address information.\n      The\
    \ maintenance of the translation data will be subdivided and\n      distributed.\n\
    \   There are several stages of implementation for the servers and\n   several\
    \ levels of development for use of the domain style names.\n      First, there\
    \ is the simple substitution of the domain style names\n      for the current\
    \ host names, and the subdivision of these into\n      several domains.  At this\
    \ stage all domain style names directly\n      translate to host addresses and\
    \ all domain style names have two\n      components.\n         For example:  USC-ISIF.ARPA\
    \  or  USC-ISIA.DDN\n         and:  Postel@USC-ISIF.ARPA  or  Kahn@USC-ISIA.DDN\n\
    \         Here we expect that \"USC-ISIF.ARPA\" is the name of an Internet\n \
    \        host and that we can send mail for \"Postel\" to the SMTP port on\n \
    \        that host.  It may be that some backward host can still fake it\n   \
    \      by ignoring the \".ARPA\" and looking up an address for\n         \"USC-ISIF\"\
    .\n"

    \ the tables) mail\n         forwarding may be supported.  A domain name server\

    \      represent only organizations or administrative entities.  Finding\n   \
    \   a host that represents such entities may require a level of\n      indirection\

    \ \"USC-ISI.ARPA\" being the name of an\n         Internet host.  When we want\

    \ mail to \"USC-ISI.ARPA\".\n         The server will tell us the name (and address)\
    \ of a real\n         Internet host that handles mail on this organizations behalf,\n\
    \         for example, \"F.USC-ISI.ARPA = 10.2.0.52\". We then send mail\n   \
    \      for \"Postel\" to the SMTP port on F.USC-ISI.ARPA.\n   Interface to the\
    \ World\n      Mail will continue to move between the Internet and other\n   \
    \   \"systems\".  This may be done by designating some sort of\n      \"other-system\"\
    \ representative organization in the domain server\n      data bases that can\
    \ indirect mail to a mail-relay host.\n      For example,\n         OBERST@EDUCOM.MAILNET\n\

- title: The Transition Situation
  contents:
  - "The Transition Situation\n   Actually, the situation is a bit more complicated,\
    \ of course.  A\n   number of hosts are already using domain style names under\
    \ the\n   constraint that their domain style name is exactly their old style\n\
    \   name with the string \".ARPA\" appended.  The first transition step is\n \
    \  to have all hosts do this, and then to eliminate the user of old\n   style\
    \ names altogether.\n   Please note carefully that two types of changes are being\
    \ made:\n      One is a change in the support mechanism for translating a host\n\
    \      name to an internet address,\n         that is from using local copies\
    \ of a full centrally maintained\n         table to dynamically accessing a distributed\
    \ set of servers\n         each posesing a portion of a data base maintained in\
    \ a\n         distributed fashion.\n      The other is a change in the host names\
    \ themselves,\n         from a flat global space of unstructured strings to a\n\
    \         hierarchical structure of names.\n   There are four steps to the transition\
    \ plan.\n      First, change from old names to domain style names.\n         host-name\
    \ --> host-name.ARPA\n      Second, one domain to a few domains.\n         host-name.ARPA\
    \ --> host-name.ARPA and host-name.DDN\n      Third, change from using central\
    \ tables to using name servers.\n      Fourth, allow many domains.\n   There are\
    \ two communities that are taking slightly different courses\n   in this transition.\
    \  The ARPA research community is making the full\n   transition.  The DDN operational\
    \ community is making the change in\n   naming on the same schedule, but is not\
    \ requiring hosts in the DDN\n   operational community make the change to using\
    \ servers at the same\n   time (they can if they want to).  The DDN PMO will establish\
    \ a\n   schedule for that change at a later time.  The NIC will maintain a\n \
    \  central table of all DDN operational hosts.\n"

- title: Implication
  contents:
  - "Implication\n   All Hosts Change Names\n      The impact of introducing the domain\
    \ style names is that all hosts\n      change their names at least once.  Hosts\
    \ that move to new domains\n      or subdomains may change their names several\
    \ times.\n      Hosts have an official (or primary) name and possibly several\n\
    \      nicknames.  When mail is sent from a host, the official name is\n     \
    \ used in the mail header address fields.\n      Suppose, that in the old days\
    \ before domains were thought of, a\n      host changed its name.  What is the\
    \ impact on users of changing\n      the name of a host?  Suppose one host changed\
    \ its name from FOO to\n      BAR.\n         Mail\n            Mail that was sent\
    \ before the name was changed can not be\n            answered using mail program\
    \ commands that automatically fill\n            in the return address.  While\
    \ it may be possible to use\n            special tricks to fix up the \"From\"\
    \ or the \"To\" users\n            addresses, the \"Cc\" addresses are very difficult\
    \ to correct.\n            Mail that was sent to JOE@ABC from FRED@FOO can not\
    \ be\n            answered unless the change of name is known to the user or\n\
    \            the mail program an ABC and the host name BAR substituted\n     \
    \       for FOO.\n"
