  - "           Removal of the 30-Second Delay When Hosts Come Up\n     The IMP currently\
    \ delays accepting input from a Host for 30\nseconds after the Host has come up.\
    \  This delay serves to allow\nthe fact that the Host is up to propagate through\
    \ the network.\nThe fundamental problem is that a Host must not be permitted\n\
    to communicate with a second Host until the second Host\n(actually its IMP) has\
    \ been made aware that the first Host is\nup.  Otherwise, one Host may come up\
    \ and send a \"hello\"\nmessage to another Host, whose reply is discarded by the\
    \ IMP\nbecause it is for a dead destination.\n     All this reasoning is based\
    \ on a dead destination de-\ntection mechanism at the source IMP.  The 30-second\
    \ delay is\nbased on the worst-case propagation delay for routing information\n\
    in the network, so that every potential source IMP can update\nits host up/down\
    \ table.  There are several drawbacks to this\nscheme:\n         1.  Hosts should\
    \ not have to wait the worst-case time\n             of 30 seconds to send to\
    \ Hosts at their IMP or\n             nearby in the network.\n         2.  The\
    \ operation of half-duplex interfaces is made\n             even more complicated\
    \ because of the startup delay.\n         3.  The timeout period of 30 seconds\
    \ is really a\n             function of network topology and we would like to\n\
    \             be able to change it when necessary as the network\n           \
    \  expands.\n     We propose to eliminate the 30-second delay altogether.\nThe\
    \ IMP subnetwork will detect messages for a dead Host at the\ndestination IMP\
    \ instead of at the source IMP.  There is no delay\ngive a message to one of its\
    \ Hosts or to return a destination\ndead message to the source Host.  Under this\
    \ new scheme, when-\never the IMP's ready line is up it is ready to accept input\n\
    from its Hosts without delay.  Several comments on this change\nshould be noted:\n\
    \         1.  No change to Host software should be necessitated\n            \
    \ by this change.  The Host may attempt to send a\n             message to the\
    \ IMP as soon as it brings its\n             ready line up, or it may delay for\
    \ a long time.  In\n             either case, the IMP will take the message. \
    \ As\n             before, as soon as the Host has brought up its\n          \
    \   ready line, it must accept messages from the IMP.\n         2.  The Hosts\
    \ may wish to remove any delays _they_ have\n             programmed into their\
    \ startup routines, since\n             such delays are no longer necessary.\n\
    \         3.  Destination dead messages will be returned as\n             before\
    \ with two differences.  There will be more\n             delay between the receipt\
    \ of the message at the\n             IMP and the return of the dead destination\
    \ message\n             because it must travel through the network.  For\n   \
    \          the same reason, if many messages are sent to\n             dead Hosts,\
    \ the dead destination messages may come\n             back out of order.\n  \
    \   The Host personnel responsible for the IMP software at\neach site should check\
    \ that this proposed change will not ad-\nversely affect them.  If no adverse\
    \ comments are received,\nthis change will go into effect on Tuesday morning,\
    \ December\n12 at the regular IMP software release time.\n  [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n  [ into the online RFC archives by\
