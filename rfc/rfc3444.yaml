  - "1. Introduction\n   Currently multiple languages exist to define managed objects.\n\
    \   Examples of such languages are the Structure of Management\n   Information\
    \ (SMI) [1], the Structure of Policy Provisioning\n   Information (SPPI) [2] and,\
    \ within the DMTF, the Managed Object\n   Format (MOF) [3].  Despite the fact\
    \ that multiple languages exist, a\n   number of people still believe that none\
    \ of these languages really\n   suits all needs.\n   There have been many discussions\
    \ to understand the advantages and\n   disadvantages, as well as the main differences,\
    \ between various\n   languages.  For instance, the IETF organized a BoF on \"\
    Network\n   Information Modeling\" (NIM) at its 48th meeting (Pittsburgh, August\n\
    \   2000).  During these discussions, it turned out that people had a\n   different\
    \ understanding of the main terms, which caused confusion and\n   long arguments.\
    \  In particular, the meaning of the terms \"Information\n   Model\" (IM) and\
    \ \"Data Model\" (DM) turned out to be controversial.\n   In an attempt to address\
    \ this issue, the IRTF Network Management\n   Research Group (NMRG) dedicated\
    \ its 8th workshop (Austin, December\n   2000) to harmonizing the terminology\
    \ used in information and data\n   modeling.  Attendees included experts from\
    \ the IETF, DMTF and ITU, as\n   well as academics who do research in this field\
    \ (see the\n   Acknowledgments section for a list of participants).  The main\n\
    \   outcome of this successful workshop -- a better understanding of the\n   terms\
    \ \"Information Model\" and \"Data Model\" -- is presented in this\n   document.\n\
    \   Short definitions of these terms can also be found elsewhere (e.g.,\n   in\
    \ RFC 3198 [8]).  Compared to most other documents, this one\n   explains the\
    \ rationale behind the proposed definitions and provides\n   examples.\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   One of the key observations made at the NMRG workshop was that\
    \ IMs\n   and DMs are different because they serve different purposes.\n   The\
    \ main purpose of an IM is to model managed objects at a conceptual\n   level,\
    \ independent of any specific implementations or protocols used\n   to transport\
    \ the data.  The degree of specificity (or detail) of the\n   abstractions defined\
    \ in the IM depends on the modeling needs of its\n   designers.  In order to make\
    \ the overall design as clear as possible,\n   an IM should hide all protocol\
    \ and implementation details.  Another\n   important characteristic of an IM is\
    \ that it defines relationships\n   between managed objects.\n   DMs, conversely,\
    \ are defined at a lower level of abstraction and\n   include many details.  They\
    \ are intended for implementors and include\n   protocol-specific constructs.\n\
    \             IM                --> conceptual/abstract model\n              |\
    \                    for designers and operators\n   +----------+---------+\n\
    \   |          |         |\n   DM        DM         DM     --> concrete/detailed\
    \ model\n                                   for implementors\n   The relationship\
    \ between an IM and DM is shown in the Figure above.\n   Since conceptual models\
    \ can be implemented in different ways,\n   multiple DMs can be derived from a\
    \ single IM.\n   Although IMs and DMs serve different purposes, it is not always\n\
    \   possible to precisely define what kind of details should be expressed\n  \
    \ in an IM and which ones belong in a DM.  There is a gray area where\n   IMs\
    \ and DMs overlap -- just like there are gray areas between the\n   models produced\
    \ during the analysis, high-level design and low-level\n   design phases in object-oriented\
    \ software engineering.  In some\n   cases, it is very difficult to determine\
    \ whether an abstraction\n   belongs to an IM or a DM.\n"
- title: 3. Information Models
  contents:
  - "3. Information Models\n   IMs are primarily useful for designers to describe\
    \ the managed\n   environment, for operators to understand the modeled objects,\
    \ and for\n   implementors as a guide to the functionality that must be described\n\
    \   and coded in the DMs.  The terms \"conceptual models\" and \"abstract\n  \
    \ models\", which are often used in the literature, relate to IMs.  IMs\n   can\
    \ be implemented in different ways and mapped on different\n   protocols.  They\
    \ are protocol neutral.\n   An important characteristic of IMs is that they can\
    \ (and generally\n   should) specify relationships between objects.  Organizations\
    \ may use\n   the contents of an IM to delimit the functionality that can be\n\
    \   included in a DM.\n   IMs can be defined in an informal way, using natural\
    \ languages such\n   as English.  An example of such an IM is provided by RFC\
    \ 3290 [9],\n   which describes a conceptual model of a Diffserv Router and specifies\n\
    \   the relationships between the components of such a router that need\n   to\
    \ be managed.  Within the IETF, however, it is exceptional that an\n   IM be explicitly\
    \ described, and even more that the IM and DM be\n   specified in separate RFCs.\
    \  In such cases, the document specifying\n   the IM is usually an Informational\
    \ RFC whereas the document defining\n   the DM usually follows the Standards Track\
    \ [4].  In general, most of\n   the RFCs that define an SNMP Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB) module\n   also include some kind of informal description explaining\
    \ parts of\n   the model behind that MIB module.  Such a model can be considered\
    \ as\n   a document of an IM.  An example of this is RFC 2863, which defines\n\
    \   \"The Interfaces Group MIB\" [10].  But most MIB modules published to\n  \
    \ date include only a rudimentary and incomplete description of the\n   underlying\
    \ IM.\n   Alternatively, IMs can be defined using a formal language or a semi-\n\
    \   formal structured language.  One of the possibilities to formally\n   specify\
    \ IMs is to use class diagrams of the Unified Modeling Language\n   (UML).  Although\
    \ such diagrams are still rarely used within the IETF,\n   several other organizations\
    \ routinely use them for defining IMs,\n   including the DMTF, the ITU-T SG 4,\
    \ 3GPP SA5, the TeleManagement\n   Forum, and the ATM Forum.  An important advantage\
    \ of UML class\n   diagrams is that they represent objects and the relationships\
    \ between\n   them in a standard graphical way.  Because of this graphical\n \
    \  representation, designers and operators may find it easier to\n   understand\
    \ the underlying management model.  Although there are other\n   techniques to\
    \ graphically represent objects and relationships (e.g.,\n   Entity-Relationship\
    \ (ER) diagrams), UML presents the advantage of\n   being widely adopted in the\
    \ industry and taught in universities.\n   Also, many tools for editing UML diagrams\
    \ are now available.  UML is\n   standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG)\
    \ [5].\n   In general, it seems advisable to use object-oriented techniques to\n\
    \   describe an IM.  In particular, the notions of abstraction and\n   encapsulation,\
    \ as well as the possibility that object definitions\n   include methods, are\
    \ considered to be important.\n"
- title: 4. Data Models
  contents:
  - "4. Data Models\n   Compared to IMs, DMs define managed objects at a lower level\
    \ of\n   abstraction.  They include implementation- and protocol-specific\n  \
    \ details, e.g. rules that explain how to map managed objects onto\n   lower-level\
    \ protocol constructs.\n   Most of the management models standardized to date\
    \ are DMs.  Examples\n   include:\n   o  Management Information Base (MIB) modules\
    \ defined within the IETF.\n      The language (syntax) used to define these DMs\
    \ is called the\n      \"Structure of Management Information\" (SMI) [1] and is\
    \ derived\n      from ASN.1 [6].\n   o  Policy Information Base (PIB) modules,\
    \ developed within the IETF.\n      Their syntax is defined by the \"Structure\
    \ of Policy Provisioning\n      Information\" (SPPI) [2], which is close to SMI\
    \ and is also derived\n      from ASN.1 [6].\n   o  Management Information Base\
    \ (MIB) modules, originally defined by\n      the ISO and currently maintained\
    \ and enhanced by the ITU-T.  The\n      syntax of these DMs is specified in the\
    \ \"Guidelines for the\n      Definition of Managed Objects\" (GDMO) [7].  GDMO\
    \ MIB modules make\n      use of object-oriented principles.\n   o  CIM Schemas,\
    \ developed within the DMTF.  The DMTF publishes them\n      in two forms: graphical\
    \ and textual.  The graphical forms use UML\n      diagrams and are not normative\
    \ (because not all details can be\n      represented graphically).  They can be\
    \ downloaded from the DMTF\n      Web site in PDF and Visio formats.  (Visio is\
    \ a tool to draw UML\n      class diagrams.)  The textual forms are normative\
    \ and written in a\n      language called the \"Managed Object Format\" (MOF)\
    \ [3].  CIM\n      Schemas are object-oriented.\n   Because CIM Schemas support\
    \ a graphical notation whereas IETF MIB\n   modules do not, designers and operators\
    \ may find it easier to\n   understand CIM Schemas than IETF MIB modules.  One\
    \ could therefore\n   argue that CIM Schemas are closer to IMs than IETF MIB modules.\n\
    \   The Figure below summarizes these examples.  The languages that are\n   used\
    \ to define the DMs are shown between brackets.\n                       IM   \
    \                           --> IM\n                        |\n     +----------+-------+-------+--------------+\n\
    \     |          |               |              |\n    MIB        PIB        \
    \  CIM schema      OSI-MIB    --> DM\n   (SMI)      (SPPI)          (MOF)    \
    \      (GDMO)\n   To illustrate what details are included in a DM, let us consider\
    \ the\n   example of IETF MIB modules.  As opposed to IMs, IETF MIB modules\n\
    \   include details such as OID assignments and indexing structures.  The\n  \
    \ relationships defined in the IM are implemented as OID pointers or\n   realized\
    \ through indexing relationships specified in INDEX clauses.\n   Many other implementation-specific\
    \ details are included, such as MAX-\n   ACCESS and STATUS clauses and conformance\
    \ statements.\n   A special kind of DM language is the SMIng language defined\
    \ by the\n   NMRG.  This language was designed at a higher conceptual level than\n\
    \   SMIv1/SMIv2 and SPPI.  In fact, one of the intentions behind SMIng\n   was\
    \ to stop the proliferation of different DM languages within the\n   IETF and\
    \ to harmonize the various models.  As a result, MIB and PIB\n   modules defined\
    \ in SMIng can be mapped on different underlying\n   protocols.  There is a mapping\
    \ on SNMP and another mapping on COPS-\n   PR.  SMIng is therefore more protocol\
    \ neutral than other IETF\n   approaches.  It also supports some object-oriented\
    \ principles and\n   provides extension mechanisms that allow the addition of\
    \ new features\n   (e.g., the support for methods).  New features can then be\
    \ used when\n   they are supported by the underlying protocols, without breaking\n\
    \   SMIng implementations.  Still, SMIng should be considered a DM.  For\n   instance,\
    \ to express relationships between managed objects,\n   techniques such as UML\
    \ and ER diagrams still give better results\n   because these diagrams are easier\
    \ to understand.\n   Note that the IETF SMING Working Group took a different approach\
    \ and\n   decided not to use the SMIng language defined by the NMRG.  Instead,\n\
    \   the SMING Working Group is developing a third version of SMI (SMIv3)\n   that\
    \ is primarily targeted towards SNMP, and which incorporates only\n   some of\
    \ the ideas developed within the NMRG.\n"
