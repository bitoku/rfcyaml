- title: 2. Introduction and Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction and Overview\n   Many IMAP4 [RFC-2060] clients present to the\
    \ user a hierarchical view\n   of the mailboxes that a user has access to.  Rather\
    \ than initially\n   presenting to the user the entire mailbox hierarchy, it is\
    \ often\n   preferable to show to the user a collapsed outline list of the\n \
    \  mailbox hierarchy (particularly if there is a large number of\n   mailboxes).\
    \  The user can then expand the collapsed outline hierarchy\n   as needed.  It\
    \ is common to include within the collapsed hierarchy a\n   visual clue (such\
    \ as a \"+\") to indicate that there are child\n   mailboxes under a particular\
    \ mailbox.  When the visual clue is\n   clicked the hierarchy list is expanded\
    \ to show the child mailboxes.\n   Several IMAP vendors implemented this proposal,\
    \ and it is proposed to\n   document this behavior and functionality as an Informational\
    \ RFC.\n   There is interest in addressing the general extensibility of the IMAP\n\
    \   LIST command through an IMAP LIST Extension draft.  Similar\n   functionality\
    \ to the \\HasChildren and \\HasNoChildren flags could be\n   incorporated into\
    \ this new LIST Extension.  It is proposed that the\n   more general LIST Extension\
    \ draft proceed on the standards track with\n   this proposal being relegated\
    \ to informational status only.\n   If the functionality of the \\HasChildren\
    \ and \\HasNoChildren flags\n   were incorporated into a more general LIST extension,\
    \ this would have\n   the advantage that a client could then have the opportunity\
    \ to\n   request whether or not the server should return this information.\n \
    \  This would be an advantage over the current draft for servers where\n   this\
    \ information is expensive to compute, since the server would only\n   need to\
    \ compute the information when it knew that the client\n   requesting the information\
    \ was able to consume it.\n"
- title: 3. Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Requirements\n   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword\n\
    \   CHILDREN in their CAPABILITY response.\n   The CHILDREN extension defines\
    \ two new attributes that MAY be\n   returned within a LIST response.\n   \\HasChildren\
    \ - The presence of this attribute indicates that the\n   mailbox has child mailboxes.\n\
    \   Servers SHOULD NOT return \\HasChildren if child mailboxes exist, but\n  \
    \ none will be displayed to the current user in a LIST response (as\n   should\
    \ be the case where child mailboxes exist, but a client does not\n   have permissions\
    \ to access them.)  In this case, \\HasNoChildren\n   SHOULD be used.\n   In many\
    \ cases, however, a server may not be able to efficiently\n   compute whether\
    \ a user has access to all child mailboxes, or multiple\n   users may be accessing\
    \ the same account and simultaneously changing\n   the mailbox hierarchy.  As\
    \ such a client MUST be prepared to accept\n   the \\HasChildren attribute as\
    \ a hint.  That is, a mailbox MAY be\n   flagged with the \\HasChildren attribute,\
    \ but no child mailboxes will\n   appear in a subsequent LIST response.\n   Example\
    \ 3.1:\n   ============\n   /*** Consider a server that has the following mailbox\
    \ hierarchy:\n   INBOX\n   ITEM_1\n      ITEM_1A\n   ITEM_2\n      TOP_SECRET\n\
    \   Where INBOX, ITEM_1 and ITEM_2 are top level mailboxes.  ITEM_1A is a\n  \
    \ child mailbox of ITEM_1 and TOP_SECRET is a child mailbox of ITEM_2\n   that\
    \ the currently logged on user does NOT have access to.\n   Note that in this\
    \ case, the server is not able to efficiently compute\n   access rights to child\
    \ mailboxes and responds with a \\HasChildren\n   attribute for mailbox ITEM_2,\
    \ even though ITEM_2/TOP_SECRET does not\n   appear in the list response.  ***/\n\
    \   C: A001 LIST \"\" *\n   S: * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \"/\" INBOX\n   S: * LIST\
    \ (\\HasChildren) \"/\" ITEM_1\n   S: * LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \"/\" ITEM_1/ITEM_1A\n\
    \   S: * LIST (\\HasChildren) \"/\" ITEM_2\n   S: A001 OK LIST Completed\n   \\\
    HasNoChildren - The presence of this attribute indicates that the\n   mailbox\
    \ has NO child mailboxes that are accessible to the currently\n   authenticated\
    \ user.  If a mailbox has the \\Noinferiors attribute, the\n   \\HasNoChildren\
    \ attribute is redundant and SHOULD be omitted in the\n   LIST response.\n   In\
    \ some instances a server that supports the CHILDREN extension MAY\n   NOT be\
    \ able to determine whether a mailbox has children.  For example\n   it may have\
    \ difficulty determining whether there are child mailboxes\n   when LISTing mailboxes\
    \ while operating in a particular namespace.\n   In these cases, a server MAY\
    \ exclude both the \\HasChildren and\n   \\HasNoChildren attributes in the LIST\
    \ response.  As such, a client\n   can not make any assumptions about whether\
    \ a mailbox has children\n   based upon the absence of a single attribute.\n \
    \  It is an error for the server to return both a \\HasChildren and a\n   \\HasNoChildren\
    \ attribute in a LIST response.\n   It is an error for the server to return both\
    \ a \\HasChildren and a\n   \\NoInferiors attribute in a LIST response.\n   Note:\
    \ the \\HasNoChildren attribute should not be confused with the\n   IMAP4 [RFC-2060]\
    \ defined attribute \\Noinferiors which indicates that\n   no child mailboxes\
    \ exist now and none can be created in the future.\n   The \\HasChildren and \\\
    HasNoChildren attributes might not be returned\n   in response to a LSUB response.\
    \  Many servers maintain a simple\n   mailbox subscription list that is not updated\
    \ when the underlying\n   mailbox structure is changed.  A client MUST NOT assume\
    \ that\n   hierarchy information will be maintained in the subscription list.\n\
    \   RLIST is a command defined in [RFC-2193] that includes in a LIST\n   response\
    \ mailboxes that are accessible only via referral.  That is, a\n   client must\
    \ explicitly issue an RLIST command to see a list of these\n   mailboxes.  Thus\
    \ in the case where a mailbox has child mailboxes that\n   are available only\
    \ via referral, the mailboxes would appear as\n   \\HasNoChildren in response\
    \ to the LIST command, and \\HasChildren in\n   response to the RLIST command.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. Formal Syntax\n   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur\n\
    \   Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].\n   Two new mailbox attributes are defined\
    \ as flag_extensions to the\n   IMAP4 mailbox_list response:\n   HasChildren =\
    \ \"\\HasChildren\"\n   HasNoChildren = \"\\HasNoChildren\"\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This extension provides a client a more efficient\
    \ means of\n   determining whether a particular mailbox has children.  If a mailbox\n\
    \   has children, but the currently authenticated user does not have\n   access\
    \ to any of them, the server SHOULD respond with a\n   \\HasNoChildren attribute.\
    \  In many cases, however, a server may not\n   be able to efficiently compute\
    \ whether a user has access to all child\n   mailboxes.  If such a server responds\
    \ with a \\HasChildren attribute,\n   when in fact the currently authenticated\
    \ user does not have access to\n   any child mailboxes, potentially more information\
    \ is conveyed about\n   the mailbox than intended.  A server designed with such\
    \ levels of\n   security in mind SHOULD NOT attach the \\HasChildren attribute\
    \ to a\n   mailbox unless the server is certain that the user has access to at\n\
    \   least one of the child mailboxes.\n"
