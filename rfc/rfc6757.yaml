  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] can be used for supporting network-based\n\
    \   mobility management in various types of network deployments.  Network\n  \
    \ architectures such as service provider Wi-Fi access aggregation or\n   Wireless\
    \ Local Area Network (WLAN) integrated with mobile packet core\n   are examples\
    \ where Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a component of the overall\n   architecture.  Some\
    \ of these architectures require the ability of the\n   local mobility anchor\
    \ (LMA) [RFC5213] to provide differentiated\n   services and policing of traffic\
    \ to the mobile nodes based on the\n   access network to which they are attached.\
    \  Policy systems in\n   mobility architectures such as the Policy and Charging\
    \ Control (PCC)\n   Framework [TS23203] and the Access Network Discovery and Selection\n\
    \   Function (ANDSF) [TS23402] in Third Generation Partnership Project\n   (3GPP)\
    \ systems allow configuration of policy rules with conditions\n   based on the\
    \ access network information.  For example, the service\n   treatment for the\
    \ mobile node's traffic may be different when it is\n   attached to an access\
    \ network owned by the home operator than when\n   owned by a roaming partner.\
    \  The service treatment can also be\n   different based on the configured Service\
    \ Set Identifiers (SSIDs) in\n   the case of access networks based on IEEE 802.11.\
    \  Other examples of\n   location services include the operator's ability to display\
    \ a\n   location-specific web page or apply tariff based on the location.\n  \
    \ The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] requires the Access\n   Technology\
    \ Type (ATT) option to be carried from the mobile access\n   gateway (MAG) to\
    \ the local mobility anchor.  This is a mandatory\n   option.  However, the Access\
    \ Technology Type alone is not necessarily\n   sufficient for a suitable policy\
    \ to be applied at the local mobility\n   anchor.  Therefore, there is a need\
    \ for additional access-network-\n   related information to be available at the\
    \ local mobility anchor.\n   Learning the identity of the access network operator\
    \ may not be\n   possible for a local mobility anchor without the support of an\n\
    \   additional policy framework that is able to provide required\n   information\
    \ out of band to the local mobility anchor.  Such a policy\n   framework may not\
    \ be required for all Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments;\n   hence, an alternative\
    \ approach for optionally carrying such\n   information is required to ensure\
    \ that additional information related\n   to the access network is available.\n\
    \   This document defines a new mobility option, the Access Network\n   Identifier\
    \ (ANI) option, and its sub-options for Proxy Mobile IPv6,\n   which can be used\
    \ by the mobile access gateway to signal the access\n   network information to\
    \ the local mobility anchor.  The specific\n   details on how the local mobility\
    \ anchor uses the information\n   contained in the Access Network Identifier option\
    \ are out of scope\n   for this document.  This information is intended for use\
    \ between\n   infrastructure nodes providing mobile management service and is\
    \ not\n   exposed to outside entities, which ensures the location of the\n   network\
    \ to which the mobile node is attached, or any other access-\n   network-specific\
    \ information, is not revealed to other mobile nodes\n   within the PMIPv6 domain\
    \ or to other nodes outside the PMIPv6 domain.\n   However, the location and access\
    \ information MAY be exposed to\n   specific parties outside the PMIPv6 domain\
    \ based on an agreement\n   approved by the subscriber; otherwise, this information\
    \ MUST NOT be\n   exposed in the absence of such agreements.  If the location\n\
    \   information is to be exposed outside the PMIPv6 domain, then that\n   MUST\
    \ be done using a Presence Information Data Format Location Object\n   (PIDF-LO)\
    \ [RFC5139] carrying the usage rules to which the subscriber\n   has agreed. \
    \ This mobility option is optional and is not mandatory\n   for the Proxy Mobile\
    \ IPv6 protocol.  However, the Access Technology\n   Type option continues to\
    \ be a mandatory option and always needs to be\n   carried in the Proxy Mobile\
    \ IPv6 signaling messages.\n       SSID: IETF-1\n       Geo-Location: 37o49'11\"\

    \ List entry data structure maintained\n      by the mobile access gateway, described\
    \ in Section 6.1 of\n      [RFC5213], MUST be extended to store the access-network-related\n\
    \      information elements associated with the current session.\n      Specifically,\
    \ the following parameters MUST be defined:\n      Network-Identifier\n      Operator-Identifier\n\
    \      Geo-Location\n   o  If the mobile access gateway is configured to support\
    \ the Access\n      Network Information option, it SHOULD include this option\
    \ with the\n      specific sub-options in all Proxy Binding Update messages\n\
    \      (including Proxy Binding Updates for lifetime extension and for\n     \
    \ deregistration) that it sends to the local mobility anchor.  The\n      Access\
    \ Network Information option MUST be constructed as specified\n      in Section\
    \ 3.  It SHOULD include the ANI sub-option(s) that the\n      mobile access gateway\
    \ is configured to carry in the Proxy Mobile\n      IPv6 messages.\n   o  The\
    \ access network information elements, such as Network-\n      Identifier, Geo-Location,\
    \ and Operator-Identifier, typically are\n      statically configured on the mobile\
    \ access gateway on a per-\n      interface basis (for example, access point (AP-1)\
    \ is attached\n      through interface-1, and the SSID is X, Geo-Location is Y).\
    \  In\n      some deployments, this information can also be dynamically\n    \
    \  obtained, such as through DHCP Option (82), which is the DHCP\n      Relay\
    \ Agent Information option [RFC3046].  When the mobile node\n      sends a DHCP\
    \ Request, the access points typically add the SSID\n      information to the\
    \ Option 82 of the DHCP request, and when the\n      mobile access gateway receives\
    \ this request, it can parse the\n      Option 82 of the DHCP request and obtain\
    \ the SSID name.  The\n      mobility access gateway can also obtain this information\
    \ from the\n      DHCPv6 GeoLoc Option [RFC6225].  The specific details on how\
    \ the\n      mobile access gateway obtains these information elements are\n  \
    \    access technology and deployment specific and are outside the\n      scope\
    \ of this document.  It is possible those information elements\n      are configured\
    \ on the MAG on a per-interface basis or dynamically\n      obtained through some\
    \ out-of-band means, such as based on the\n      Control and Provisioning of Wireless\
    \ Access Points (CAPWAP)\n      protocol.\n   o  If the protocol configuration\
    \ variable\n      EnableANISubOptNetworkIdentifier (Section 6) is set to a value\
    \ of\n      (1), the mobile access gateway SHOULD include the Network-\n     \
    \ Identifier sub-option in the Access Network Identifier option\n      carried\
    \ in the Proxy Binding Update.  However, if the mobile\n      access gateway is\
    \ unable to obtain the Network-Identifier, then it\n      MUST NOT include this\
    \ sub-option.  For including the Network-\n      Identifier sub-option, the mobile\
    \ access gateway needs to be aware\n      of the Network Name of the access network\
    \ (e.g., SSID in the case\n      of a WLAN access network) to which the mobile\
    \ node is attached.\n      This sub-option also includes the Access-Point Name\
    \ for carrying\n      the name of the access point to which the mobile node is\
    \ attached.\n      The Access-Point Name is specially important for applying location\n\
    \      services, given that the Network Name (e.g., SSID) may not provide\n  \
    \    the needed uniqueness for identifying a location.  When included,\n     \
    \ this sub-option MUST be constructed as described in Section 3.1.1\n   o  If\
    \ the protocol configuration variable EnableANISubOptGeoLocation\n      (Section\
    \ 6) is set to a value of (1), the mobile access gateway\n      SHOULD include\
    \ the Geo-Location sub-option in the Access Network\n      Identifier option carried\
    \ in the Proxy Binding Update.  However,\n      if the mobile access gateway is\
    \ unable to obtain the Geo-location,\n      then it MUST NOT include this sub-option.\
    \  For including the Geo-\n      Location sub-option, the mobile access gateway\
    \ needs to be aware\n      of the GPS coordinates of the network to which the\
    \ mobile node is\n      attached.  When included, this sub-option MUST be constructed\
    \ as\n      described in Section 3.1.2.\n   o  If the protocol configuration variable\n\
    \      EnableANISubOptOperatorIdentifier (Section 6) is set to a value of\n  \
    \    (1), the mobile access gateway SHOULD include the Operator-\n      Identifier\
    \ sub-option in the Access Network Identifier option\n      carried in the Proxy\
    \ Binding Update.  For including the Operator-\n      Identifier sub-option, the\
    \ mobile access gateway needs to be aware\n      of the operator identity of that\
    \ access network.  The access\n      network operator SHOULD obtain an identifier\
    \ from the \"Private\n      Enterprise Number\" registry, in order for the mobile\
    \ access\n      gateway to carry the Operator-Identifier.  If a given access\n\
    \      network operator has not obtained an identifier from the \"Private\n  \
    \    Enterprise Number\" registry or if the mobile access gateway is\n      unable\
    \ to learn the operator identity for any other administrative\n      reasons,\
    \ then it MUST NOT include this sub-option.  When included,\n      this sub-option\
    \ MUST be constructed as described in Section 3.1.3.\n   If the mobile access\
    \ gateway had any of the Access Network\n   Information mobility options included\
    \ the Proxy Binding Update sent\n   to a local mobility anchor, then the Proxy\
    \ Binding Acknowledgement\n   received from the local mobility anchor SHOULD contain\
    \ the Access\n   Network Information mobility option with the specific sub-options.\n\
    \   If the mobile access gateway receives a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement\n  \
    \ with a successful Status Value but without an Access Network\n   Information\
    \ mobility option, then the mobile access gateway SHOULD\n   log the event and,\
    \ based on its local policy, MAY proceed to\n   terminate the mobility session.\
    \  In this case, the mobile access\n   gateway knows the local mobility anchor\
    \ does not understand the\n   Access Network Information mobility option and therefore\
    \ MAY consider\n   it as a misconfiguration of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The Access Network Information option defined\
    \ in this specification\n   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding\
    \ Acknowledgement\n   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility\
    \ header\n   option as specified in [RFC6275] and does not require any special\n\
    \   security considerations.\n   The Geo-Location sub-option carried in the Access\
    \ Network Information\n   option exposes the geo-location of the network to which\
    \ the mobile\n   node is attached.  This information is considered to be very\n\
    \   sensitive, so care must be taken to secure the Proxy Mobile IPv6\n   signaling\
    \ messages when carrying this sub-option.  The base Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 specification\
    \ [RFC5213] specifies the use of IPsec for\n   securing the signaling messages,\
    \ and those mechanisms can be enabled\n   for protecting this information.  Operators\
    \ can potentially apply\n   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) with confidentiality\
    \ and\n   integrity protection for protecting the location information.\n   Access-network-specific\
    \ information elements that the mobile access\n   gateway sends may have been\
    \ dynamically learned over DHCP or using\n   other protocols.  If proper security\
    \ mechanisms are not in place, the\n   exchanged information may be potentially\
    \ compromised with the mobile\n   access gateway sending incorrect access network\
    \ parameters to the\n   local mobility anchor.  This situation may potentially\
    \ result in\n   incorrect service policy enforcement at the local mobility anchor\
    \ and\n   impact to other services that depend on this access network\n   information.\
    \  This threat can be mitigated by ensuring the\n   communication path between\
    \ the mobile access gateway and the access\n   points is properly secured by the\
    \ use of IPsec, Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS), or other security protocols.\n"
