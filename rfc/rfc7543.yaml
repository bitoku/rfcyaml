  - "1.  Introduction\n   A BGP [RFC4271] speaker can send Outbound Route Filters
    (ORFs)\n   [RFC5291] to a peer.  The peer uses ORFs to filter routing updates\n
    \  that it sends to the BGP speaker.  Using ORF, a BGP speaker can\n   realize
    a \"route pull\" paradigm in which the BGP speaker, on demand,\n   pulls certain
    routes from the peer.\n   This document defines a new ORF-type, called the Covering
    Prefixes\n   ORF (CP-ORF).  A BGP speaker sends a CP-ORF to a peer in order to\n
    \  pull routes that cover a specified host address.  A prefix covers a\n   host
    address if it can be used to forward traffic towards that host\n   address.  Section
    3 provides a more complete description of covering\n   prefix selection criteria.\n
    \  CP-ORF is applicable in Virtual Hub-and-Spoke VPNs [RFC7024]\n   [RFC4364].

  - "3.  Processing Rules\n   According to [RFC4271], every BGP speaker maintains
    a single Loc-RIB.\n   For each of its peers, the BGP speaker also maintains an
    Outbound\n   Filter and an Adj-RIB-Out.  The Outbound Filter defines policy that\n
    \  determines which Loc-RIB entries are processed into the corresponding\n   Adj-RIB-Out.
    \ Mechanisms such as RT-Constrain [RFC4684] and ORF\n   [RFC5291] enable a router's
    peer to influence the Outbound Filter.\n   Therefore, the Outbound Filter for
    a given peer is constructed using\n   a combination of the locally configured
    policy and the information\n   received via RT-Constrain and ORF from the peer.\n
    \  Using this model, we can describe the operations of CP-ORF as\n   follows:\n
    \  When a BGP speaker receives a ROUTE-REFRESH message that contains a\n   CP-ORF
    and that ROUTE-REFRESH message violates any of the encoding\n   rules specified
    in Section 2, the BGP speaker MUST ignore the entire\n   ROUTE-REFRESH message.
    \ It SHOULD also log the event.  However, an\n   implementation MAY apply logging
    thresholds to avoid excessive\n   messaging or log file overflow.\n   Otherwise,
    the BGP speaker processes each CP-ORF entry as indicated\n   by the Action field.
    \ If the Action is equal to ADD, the BGP speaker\n   adds the CP-ORF entry to
    the Outbound Filter associated with the peer\n   in the position specified by
    the Sequence field.  If the Action is\n   equal to REMOVE, the BGP speaker removes
    the CP-ORF entry from the\n   Outbound Filter.  If the Action is equal to REMOVE-ALL,
    the BGP\n   speaker removes all CP-ORF entries from the Outbound Filter.\n   Whenever
    the BGP speaker applies an Outbound Filter to a route\n   contained in its Loc-RIB,
    it evaluates the route in terms of the\n   CP-ORF entries first.  It then evaluates
    the route in terms of the\n   remaining non-CP-ORF entries.  The rules for the
    former are described\n   below.  The rules for the latter are outside the scope
    of this\n   document.\n   The following route types can match a CP-ORF:\n   o
    \ IPv4-VPN\n   o  IPv6-VPN\n   o  L2VPN\n   In order for an IPv4-VPN route or
    IPv6-VPN route to match a CP-ORF,\n   all of the following conditions MUST be
    true:\n   o  the route carries an RT whose value is the same as the CP-ORF VPN\n
    \     Route Target;\n   o  the route prefix length is greater than or equal to
    the CP-ORF\n      Minlen plus 64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher);\n
    \  o  the route prefix length is less than or equal to the CP-ORF Maxlen\n      plus
    64 (i.e., the length of a VPN Route Distinguisher);\n   o  ignoring the Route
    Distinguisher, the leading bits of the route\n      prefix are identical to the
    leading bits of the CP-ORF Host\n      Address, and CP-ORF Minlen defines the
    number of bits that must be\n      identical; and\n   o  Loc-RIB does not contain
    a more specific route that also satisfies\n      all of the above listed conditions.\n
    \  The BGP speaker ignores Route Distinguishers when determining whether\n   a
    prefix matches a host address.  For example, assume that a CP-ORF\n   carries
    the following information:\n   o  Minlen equal to 1\n   o  Maxlen equal to 32\n
    \  o  Host Address equal to 192.0.2.1\n   Assume also that Loc-RIB contains routes
    for the following IPv4-VPN\n   prefixes and that all of these routes carry an
    RT whose value is the\n   same as the CP-ORF VPN Route Target:\n   o  1:0.0.0.0/64.\n
    \  o  2:192.0.2.0/88\n   o  3:192.0.2.0/89\n   Only the prefix 3:192.0.2.0/89
    matches the CP-ORF.  The prefix\n   1:0.0.0.0/64 does not match, because its length
    (64) is less than the\n   CP-ORF Minlen (1) plus the length of an L3VPN Route
    Distinguisher\n   (64).  If Loc-RIB did not contain the prefix 3:192.0.2.0/89,\n
    \  2:192.0.2.0/88 would match the CP-ORF.  However, because Loc-RIB also\n   contains
    a more specific covering route (3:192.0.2.0/89),\n   2:192.0.2.0/88 does not match.
    \ Only 3:192.0.2.0/89 satisfies all of\n   the above listed match criteria.  Note
    that the matching algorithm\n   ignored Route Distinguishers.\n   In order for
    an EVPN route to match a CP-ORF, all of the following\n   conditions MUST be true:\n
    \  o  the EVPN route type is equal to the CP-ORF Route Type; and\n   o  the route
    carries an RT whose value is equal to the CP-ORF VPN\n      Route Target.\n   In
    addition, if the CP-ORF Route Type is equal to MAC/IP\n   Advertisement Route,
    the following conditions also MUST be true:\n   o  the EVPN Route MAC Address
    Length is greater than or equal to the\n      CP-ORF Minlen plus 64 (i.e., the
    length of a VPN Route\n      Distinguisher);\n   o  the EVPN Route MAC Address
    Length is less than or equal to the CP-\n      ORF Maxlen plus 64 (i.e., the length
    of a VPN Route\n      Distinguisher); and\n   o  ignoring the Route Distinguisher,
    the leading bits of the EVPN\n      Route MAC Address are identical to the leading
    bits of the CP-ORF\n      Host Address.  CP-ORF Minlen defines the number of bits
    that must\n      be identical.\n   If a route matches the selection criteria of
    a CP-ORF entry and it\n   does not violate any subsequent rule specified by the
    Outbound Filter\n   (e.g., rules that reflect local policy or rules that are due
    to\n   RT-Constrains), the BGP speaker places the route into the Adj-RIB-\n   Out.
    \ In Adj-RIB-Out, the BGP speaker adds the CP-ORF Import Route\n   Target to the
    list of RTs that the route already carries.  The BGP\n   speaker also adds a Transitive
    Opaque Extended Community [RFC4360]\n   with the sub-type equal to CP-ORF (0x03).
    \ As a result of being\n   placed in Adj-RIB-Out, the route is advertised to the
    peer associated\n   with the Adj-RIB-Out.\n   Receiving CP-ORF entries with REMOVE
    or REMOVE-ALL Actions may cause\n   a route that has previously been installed
    in a particular Adj-RIB-\n   Out to be excluded from that Adj-RIB-Out.  In this
    case, as specified\n   in [RFC4271], \"the previously advertised route in that
    Adj-RIB-Out\n   MUST be withdrawn from service by means of an UPDATE message\".\n
    \  RFC 5291 states that a BGP speaker should respond to a ROUTE REFRESH\n   message
    as follows:\n      If the When-to-refresh indicates IMMEDIATE, then after processing\n
    \     all the ORF entries carried in the message the speaker\n      re-advertises
    to the peer routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated\n      with the peer that have
    the same AFI/SAFI as what is carried in\n      the message, and taking into account
    all the ORF entries for that\n      AFI/SAFI received from the peer.  The speaker
    MUST re-advertise\n      all the routes that have been affected by the ORF entries
    carried\n      in the message, but MAY also re-advertise the routes that have
    not\n      been affected by the ORF entries carried in the message.\n   When the
    ROUTE-REFRESH message includes only CP-ORF entries, the BGP\n   speaker MUST re-advertise
    routes that have been affected by these\n   CP-ORF entries.  It is RECOMMENDED
    not to re-advertise the routes\n   that have not been affected by the CP-ORF entries.\n
    \  When the ROUTE-REFRESH message includes one or more CP-ORF entries\n   and
    one or more ORF entries of a different type, the behavior remains\n   unchanged
    from that described in RFC 5291.\n"

  - "4.  Applicability in Virtual Hub-and-Spoke VPNs\n   In a Virtual Hub-and-Spoke
    environment, VPN sites are attached to PE\n   routers.  For a given VPN, a PE
    router acts in exactly one of the\n   following roles:\n   o  as a V-hub\n   o
    \ as a V-spoke\n   o  as neither a V-hub nor a V-spoke\n   To illustrate CP-ORF
    operation in conjunction with Virtual Hub-and-\n   Spoke, assume the following:\n
    \  o  One of the sites in a particular VPN, RED-VPN, is connected to a\n      PE
    that acts as neither a V-hub nor a V-spoke for RED-VPN.  We\n      refer to this
    PE as PE1.\n   o  Another site in RED-VPN is connected to another PE, and that
    PE\n      acts as a V-hub for RED-VPN.  We refer to this PE as V-hub1.\n   o  Yet
    another site in RED-VPN is connected to another PE, and that\n      PE acts as
    a V-spoke for RED-VPN.  We refer to this PE as\n      V-spoke1.\n   All of these
    PEs advertise RED-VPN routes to a Route Reflector (RR).\n   They mark these routes
    with an RT, which we will call RT-RED.  In\n   particular, PE1 advertises a RED-VPN
    route to a prefix that we will\n   call P.  P covers a host address that we will
    call H.\n   For the purpose of illustration, also assume that the PEs and the
    RRs\n   use RT-Constrain [RFC4684].\n   V-hub1 serves the RED-VPN.  Therefore,
    V-hub1 advertises a VPN-IP\n   default route for the RED-VPN to the RR, carrying
    the route target\n   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.\n   V-spoke1 establishes a BGP session
    with the RR, negotiating the\n   CP-ORF capability as well as the Multiprotocol
    Extensions capability\n   [RFC4760].  Upon establishment of the BGP session, the
    RR does not\n   advertise any routes to V-spoke1.  The RR will not advertise any\n
    \  routes until it receives either a ROUTE-REFRESH message or a BGP\n   UPDATE
    message containing a Route Target Membership Network Layering\n   Reachability
    Information (NLRI) [RFC4684].\n   Immediately after the BGP session is established,
    V-spoke1 sends the\n   RR a BGP UPDATE message containing a Route Target Membership
    NLRI.\n   The Route Target Membership NLRI specifies RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 as its\n
    \  RT.  In response to the BGP-UPDATE message, the RR advertises the VPN\n   IP
    default route for the RED-VPN to V-spoke1.  This route carries the\n   route target
    RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.  V-spoke1 subjects this route to its\n   import policy and accepts
    it because it carries the route target\n   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.\n   Now, V-spoke1
    begins normal operation, sending all of its RED-VPN\n   traffic through V-hub1.
    \ At some point, V-spoke1 determines that it\n   might benefit from a more direct
    route to H.  (Note that criteria by\n   which V-spoke1 determines that it needs
    a more direct route to H are\n   beyond the scope of this document.)\n   In order
    to discover a more direct route, V-spoke1 assigns a unique\n   numeric identifier
    to H.  V-spoke1 then sends a ROUTE-REFRESH message\n   to the RR, which contains
    the following information:\n   o  AFI is equal to IPv4 or IPv6, as appropriate\n
    \  o  SAFI is equal to \"MPLS-labeled VPN address\"\n   o  When-to-refresh is
    equal to IMMEDIATE\n   o  Action is equal to ADD\n   o  Match is equal to PERMIT\n
    \  o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF\n   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier
    associated with H\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 1\n   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal
    to 32 or 128, as appropriate\n   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n
    \  o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED-FROM-HUB1\n   o  CP-ORF Route
    Type is equal to 0 (i.e., undefined)\n   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal to H\n
    \  Upon receipt of the ROUTE-REFRESH message, the RR MUST ensure that it\n   carries
    all routes belonging to the RED-VPN.  In at least one special\n   case, where
    all of the RR clients are V-spokes and none of the RR\n   clients are V-hubs,
    the RR will lack some or all of the required\n   RED-VPN routes.  So, the RR sends
    a BGP UPDATE message containing a\n   Route Target Membership NLRI for VPN-RED
    to all of its peers.  This\n   causes the peers to advertise VPN-RED routes to
    the RR if they have\n   not done so already.\n   Next, the RR adds the received
    CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter\n   associated with V-spoke1.  Using the procedures
    in Section 3, the RR\n   determines whether any of the routes in its Loc-RIB satisfy
    the\n   selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.  If any\n   routes
    satisfy the match criteria, they are added to the Adj-RIB-Out\n   associated with
    V-spoke1.  In Adj-RIB-Out, the RR adds\n   RT-RED-FROM-HUB1 to the list of RTs
    that the route already carries.\n   The RR also adds a Transitive Opaque Extended
    Community [RFC4360]\n   with the sub-type equal to CP-ORF.  Finally, RR advertises
    the newly\n   added routes to V-spoke1.  In this example, the RR advertises P
    to\n   V-spoke1 with a next-hop of PE1.\n   V-spoke1 subjects the advertised routes
    to its import policy and\n   accepts them because they carry the route target
    RT-RED-FROM-HUB1.\n   V-spoke1 may repeat this process whenever it discovers another
    flow\n   that might benefit from a more direct route to its destination.\n"

  - "5.  Applicability in BGP/MPLS Ethernet VPN (EVPN)\n   In an EVPN environment,
    Customer Edge (CE) devices are attached to PE\n   routers.  A CE can be a host,
    a router, or a switch.  For a given\n   EVI, a PE router acts in exactly one of
    the following roles:\n   o  as a DMG\n   o  as a Spoke\n   o  as neither a DMG
    nor a Spoke\n   To illustrate CP-ORF operation in the EVPN environment, assume
    the\n   following:\n   o  A CE device in a particular EVI, RED-EVI, is connected
    to a PE\n      that acts as neither a DMG nor a Spoke for RED-EVI.  We refer to\n
    \     this PE as PE1.\n   o  Another CE device in RED-EVI is connected to another
    PE, and that\n      PE acts as a DMG for RED-EVI.  We refer to this PE as DMG1.\n
    \  o  Yet another CE device in RED-EVI is connected to another PE, and\n      that
    PE acts as a Spoke for RED-EVI.  We refer to this PE as\n      Spoke1.\n   All
    of these PEs advertise RED-EVI routes to a RR.  They mark these\n   routes with
    an RT, which we will call RT-RED.  In particular, PE1\n   advertises a RED-EVI
    route to a MAC Address that we will call M.\n   The RED-EVI VPN Routing and Forwarding
    tables (VRFs) on all of these\n   PEs are provisioned to import EVPN routes that
    carry RT-RED.\n   Since DMG1 acts as a DMG for RED-EVI, DMG1 advertises a UMR
    for the\n   RED-EVI to the RR, carrying the route target RT-RED.  The UMR is\n
    \  characterized as follows:\n   o  EVPN Route Type is equal to MAC/IP Advertisement
    Route\n   o  MAC address length is equal to 0\n   o  IP address length is equal
    to 0\n   Spoke1 establishes a BGP session with the RR, negotiating the CP-ORF\n
    \  capability as well as the Multiprotocol Extensions capability\n   [RFC4760].
    \ Upon establishment of the BGP session, the RR does not\n   advertise any routes
    to Spoke1.  The RR will not advertise any routes\n   until it receives a ROUTE-REFRESH
    message.\n   Immediately after the BGP session is established, Spoke1 sends the
    RR\n   a ROUTE REFRESH message containing the following information:\n   o  AFI
    is equal to L2VPN\n   o  SAFI is equal to BGP EVPN\n   o  When-to-refresh is equal
    to IMMEDIATE\n   o  Action is equal to ADD\n   o  Match is equal to PERMIT\n   The
    ROUTE REFRESH message also contains four ORF entries.  The first\n   ORF entry
    contains the following information:\n   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF\n   o  CP-ORF
    Sequence is equal to 1\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF Maxlen
    is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF
    Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 1
    (Ethernet Autodiscovery Route)\n   The second ORF entry contains the following
    information:\n   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF\n   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal
    to 2\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0\n   o
    \ CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target
    is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 2 (MAC/IP Advertisement
    Route)\n   The third ORF entry contains the following information:\n   o  ORF
    Type is equal to CP-ORF\n   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to 3\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen
    is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target
    is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o
    \ CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 3 (Inclusive Multicast Route)\n   The fourth ORF
    entry contains the following information:\n   o  ORF Type is equal to CP-ORF\n
    \  o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to 4\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF
    Maxlen is equal to 0\n   o  CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF
    Import Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 4
    (Ethernet Segment)\n   In response to the ROUTE REFRESH message, the RR advertises
    the\n   following to V-spoke1:\n   o  All Ethernet Autodiscovery Routes belonging
    to RED-EVI\n   o  A UMR advertised by DMG1 and belonging to RED-EVI\n   o  All
    Inclusive Multicast Routes belonging to RED-EVI\n   o  All Ethernet Segment Routes
    belonging to RED-EVI\n   All of these routes carry the route target RT-RED.  Spoke1
    subjects\n   these routes to its import policy and accepts them because they carry\n
    \  the route target RT-RED.\n   Now, Spoke1 begins normal operation, sending all
    of its RED-VPN\n   traffic through DMG1.  At some point, Spoke1 determines that
    it might\n   benefit from a more direct route to M.  (Note that criteria by which\n
    \  Spoke1 determines that it needs a more direct route to M are beyond\n   the
    scope of this document.)\n   In order to discover a more direct route, Spoke1
    assigns a unique\n   numeric identifier to M.  V-spoke1 then sends a ROUTE-REFRESH
    message\n   to the RR, containing the following information:\n   o  AFI is equal
    to L2VPN\n   o  SAFI is equal to BGP EVPN\n   o  When-to-refresh is equal to IMMEDIATE\n
    \  o  Action is equal to ADD\n   o  Match is equal to PERMIT\n   o  ORF Type is
    equal to CP-ORF\n   o  CP-ORF Sequence is equal to the identifier associated with
    M\n   o  CP-ORF Minlen is equal to 1\n   o  CP-ORF Maxlen is equal to 48\n   o
    \ CP-ORF VPN Route Target is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Import Route Target
    is equal to RT-RED\n   o  CP-ORF Route Type is equal to 2 (i.e., MAC/IP Advertisement
    Route)\n   o  CP-ORF Host Address is equal to M\n   Next, the RR adds the received
    CP-ORF to the Outbound Filter\n   associated with Spoke1.  Using the procedures
    in Section 3, the RR\n   determines whether any of the routes in its Loc-RIB satisfy
    the\n   selection criteria of the newly updated Outbound Filter.  If any\n   routes
    satisfy the match criteria, they are added to the Adj-RIB-Out\n   associated with
    Spoke1.  The RR adds a Transitive Opaque Extended\n   Community [RFC4360] with
    the sub-type equal to CP-ORF.  Note that as\n   these routes are added to the
    Adj-RIB-Out, the RR does not change the\n   list of RTs that the route already
    carries.  Finally, RR advertises\n   the newly added routes to V-spoke1.  In this
    example, the RR\n   advertises M to V-spoke1 with a next-hop of PE1.\n   Spoke1
    subjects the advertised routes to its import policy and\n   accepts them because
    they carry the route target RT-RED.\n   Spoke1 may repeat this process whenever
    it discovers another flow\n   that might benefit from a more direct route to its
    destination.\n   Note that, in general, an EVI may have more than one DMG, in
    which\n   case each spoke would receive a UMR from each of them.  The spoke\n
    \  should follow its local route selection procedures to select one of\n   them
    as the \"best\" and use the selected one.\n"
