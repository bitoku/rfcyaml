  - "                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n   This RFC reports on the status\
    \ of most Network Hosts from January 31\n   to February 11.\n   Several Hosts\
    \ are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two\
    \ categories:\n      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the\
    \ Network\n          as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular\n\
    \          basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n          NETWORK\
    \              SITE                COMPUTER\n          ADDRESS\n          133\
    \                  BBN                 PDP-10  (B)\n          13             \
    \      Case                PDP-10\n          15                   Ames/(Paoli)\
    \        ILLIAC/(B6500)\n      2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users\
    \ only.  Included\n          here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in\
    \ the Network\n          (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes\
    \ the\n          Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is\n\
    \          used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n          Finally,\
    \ included among these Hosts are the following:\n          NETWORK           \
    \   SITE                COMPUTER\n          ADDRESS\n          7             \

    \          19                   NBS                 PDP-11\n   The tables on the\
    \ next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n   ________\n\
    \   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such\
    \ is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\n   refine and\
    \ debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n                                         \
