- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This memo describes an approach for building IP VPN services\
    \ out of\n   the backbone of the SP's network. Broadly speaking, two possible\n\
    \   approaches present themselves: the overlay model and the virtual\n   router\
    \ approach. The overlay model is based on overloading some\n   semantic(s) of\
    \ existing routing protocols to carry reachability\n   information.  In this document,\
    \ we focus on the virtual router\n   service.\n   The approach presented here\
    \ does not depend on any modifications of\n   any existing routing protocols.\
    \ Neighbor discovery is aided by the\n   use of  an emulated LAN and is achieved\
    \ by the use of ARP. This memo\n   makes a concerted effort to draw the line between\
    \ the SP and the PNA:\n   the SP owns and manages layer 1 and layer 2 services\
    \ while layer 3\n   services belong to and are manageable by the PNA. By the provisioning\n\
    \   of fully logically independent routing domains, the PNA has been\n   given\
    \ the flexibility to use private and unregistered addresses. Due\n   to the use\
    \ of private LSPs and the use of VPNID encapsulation using\n   label stacks over\
    \ shared LSPs, data security is not an issue.\n   The approach espoused in this\
    \ memo differs from that described in RFC\n   2547 [Rosen1] in that no specific\
    \ routing protocol has been\n   overloaded to carry VPN routes.  RFC 2547 specifies\
    \ a way to modify\n   BGP to carry VPN unicast routes across the SP's backbone.\
    \ To carry\n   multicast routes, further architectural work will be necessary.\n"
- title: 3. Virtual Routers
  contents:
  - "3. Virtual Routers\n   A virtual router is a collection of threads, either static\
    \ or\n   dynamic, in a routing device, that provides routing and forwarding\n\
    \   services much like physical routers. A virtual router need not be a\n   separate\
    \ operating system process (although it could be); it simply\n   has to provide\
    \ the illusion that a dedicated router is available to\n   satisfy the needs of\
    \ the network(s) to which it is connected. A\n   virtual router, like its physical\
    \ counterpart, is an element in a\n   routing domain. The other routers in this\
    \ domain could be physical or\n   virtual routers themselves. Given that the virtual\
    \ router connects to\n   a specific (logically discrete) routing domain and that\
    \ a physical\n   router can support multiple virtual routers, it follows that\
    \ a\n   physical router supports multiple (logically discreet) routing\n   domains.\n\
    \   From the user (VPN customer) standpoint, it is imperative that the\n   virtual\
    \ router be as equivalent to a physical router as possible. In\n   other words,\
    \ with very minor and very few exceptions, the virtual\n   router should appear\
    \ for all purposes (configuration, management,\n   monitoring and troubleshooting)\
    \ like a dedicated physical router. The\n   main motivation behind this requirement\
    \ is to avoid upgrading or re-\n   configuring the large installed base of routers\
    \ and to avoid\n   retraining of network administrators.\n   The aspects of a\
    \ router that a virtual router needs to emulate are:\n   1. Configuration of any\
    \ combination of routing protocols\n   2. Monitoring of the network\n   3. Troubleshooting.\n\
    \   Every VPN has a logically independent routing domain. This enhances\n   the\
    \ SP's ability to offer a fully flexible virtual router service\n   that can fully\
    \ serve the SP's customer without requiring physical\n   per-VPN routers. This\
    \ means that the SP's \"hardware\" investments,\n   namely routers and links between\
    \ them, can be re-used by multiple\n   customers.\n"
- title: 4. Objectives
  contents:
  - "4. Objectives\n   1. Easy, scalable configuration of VPN endpoints in the service\n\
    \      provider network. At most, one piece of configuration should be\n     \
    \ necessary when a CE is added.\n   2. No use of SP resources that are globally\
    \ unique and hard to get\n      such as IP addresses and subnets.\n   3. Dynamic\
    \ discovery of VRs (Virtual Routers) in the SP's cloud. This\n      is an optional,\
    \ but extremely valuable \"keep it simple\" goal.\n   4. Virtual Routers should\
    \ be fully configurable and monitorable by\n      the VPN network administrator.\
    \ This provides the PNA with the\n      flexibility to either configure the VPN\
    \ themselves or outsource\n      configuration tasks to the SP.\n   5. Quality\
    \ of data forwarding should be configurable on a VPN-by-VPN\n      basis.  This\
    \ should translate to continuous (but perhaps discrete)\n      grades of service.\
    \  Some examples include best effort, dedicated\n      bandwidth, QOS, and policy\
    \ based forwarding services.\n   6. Differentiated services should be configurable\
    \ on a VPN-by-VPN\n      basis, perhaps based on LSPs set up for exclusive use\
    \ for\n      forwarding data traffic in the VPN.\n   7. Security of internet routers\
    \ extended to virtual routers. This\n      means that the virtual router's data\
    \ forwarding and routing\n      functions should be as secure as a dedicated,\
    \ private physical\n      router.  There should be no unintended leak of information\
    \ (user\n      data and reachability information) from one routing domain to\n\
    \      another.\n   8. Specific routing protocols should not be mandated between\
    \ virtual\n      routers. This is critical to ensuring the VPN customer can setup\n\
    \      the network and policies as the customer sees fit. For example,\n     \
    \ some protocols are strong in filtering, while others are strong in\n      traffic\
    \ engineering. The VPN customer might want to exploit both\n      to achieve \"\
    best of breed\" network quality.\n   9. No special extensions to existing routing\
    \ protocols such as BGP,\n      RIP, OSPF, ISIS etc. This is critical to allowing\
    \ the future\n      addition of other services such as NHRP and multicast. In\n\
    \      addition, as advances and addenda are made to existing protocols\n    \
    \  (such as traffic engineering extensions to ISIS and OSPF), they\n      can\
    \ be easily incorporated into the VPN implementation.\n"
- title: 5. Architectural Requirements
  contents:
  - "5. Architectural Requirements\n   The service provider network must run some\
    \ form of multicast routing\n   to all nodes that will have VPN connections and\
    \ to nodes that must\n   forward multicast datagrams for virtual router discovery.\
    \ A specific\n   multicast routing protocol is not mandated. An SP may run MOSPF\
    \ or\n   DVMRP or any other protocol.\n"
- title: 6. Architectural Outline
  contents:
  - "6. Architectural Outline\n   1.  Every VPN is assigned a VPNID which is unique\
    \ within the SP's\n       network.  This identifier unambiguously identifies the\
    \ VPN with\n       which a packet or connection is associated. The VPNID of zero\
    \ is\n       reserved; it is associated with and represents the public\n     \
    \  internet.  It is recommended, but not required that these VPN\n       identifiers\
    \ will be compliant with RFC 2685 [Fox].\n   2.  The VPN service is offered in\
    \ the form of a Virtual Router\n       service.  These VRs reside in the SPED\
    \ and are as such confined\n       to the edge of the SP's cloud. The VRs will\
    \ use the SP's network\n       for data and control packet forwarding but are\
    \ otherwise\n       invisible outside the SPEDs.\n   3.  The \"size\" of the VR\
    \ contracted to the VPN in a given SPED is\n       expressed by the quantity of\
    \ IP resources such as routing\n       interfaces, route filters, routing entries\
    \ etc. This is entirely\n       under the control of the SP and provides the fine\
    \ granularity\n       that the SP requires to offer virtually infinite grades\
    \ of VR\n       service on a per-SPED level. [Example: one SPED may be the\n \
    \      aggregating point (say headquarters of the corporation) for a\n       given\
    \ VPN and a number of other SPEDs may be access points\n       (branch offices).\
    \ In this case, the SPED connected to the\n       headquarters may be contracted\
    \ to provide a large VR while the\n       SPEDs connected to the branch offices\
    \ may house small, perhaps\n       stub VRs]. This provision also allows the SP\
    \ to design the\n       network with an end goal of distributing the load among\
    \ the\n       routers in the network.\n   4.  One indicator of the VPN size is\
    \ the number of SPEDs in the SP's\n       network that have connections to CPE\
    \ routers in that VPN.  In\n       this respect, a VPN with many sites that need\
    \ to be connected is\n       a \"large\" VPN whereas one with a few sites is a\
    \ \"small\" VPN.\n       Also, it is conceivable that a VPN grows or shrinks in\
    \ size over\n       time. VPNs may even merge due to corporate mergers, acquisitions\n\
    \       and partnering agreements. These changes are easy to accommodate\n   \
    \    in this architecture, as globally unique IP resources do not have\n     \
    \  to be dedicated or assigned to VPNs. The number of SPEDs is not\n       limited\
    \ by any artificial configuration limits.\n   5.  The SP owns and manages Layer\
    \ 1 and Layer 2 entities. To be\n       specific, the SP controls physical switches\
    \ or routers, physical\n       links, logical layer 2 connections (such as DLCI\
    \ in Frame Relay\n       and VPI/VCI in ATM) and LSPs (and their assignment to\
    \ specific\n       VPNs).  In the context of VPNs, it is the SP's responsibility\
    \ to\n       contract and assign layer 2 entities to specific VPNs.\n   6.  Layer\
    \ 3 entities belong to and are manageable by the PNA.\n       Examples of these\
    \ entities include IP interfaces, choice of\n       dynamic routing protocols\
    \ or static routes, and routing\n       interfaces. Note that although Layer 3\
    \ configuration logically\n       falls under the PNA's area of responsibility,\
    \ it is not necessary\n       for the PNA to execute it.  It is quite viable for\
    \ the PNA to\n       outsource the IP administration of the virtual routers to\
    \ the\n       Service Provider.  Regardless of who assumes responsibility for\n\
    \       configuration and monitoring, this approach provides a full\n       routing\
    \ domain view to the PNA and empowers the PNA to design the\n       network to\
    \ achieve intranet, extranet and traffic engineering\n       goals.\n   7.  The\
    \ VPNs can be managed as if physical routers rather than VRs\n       were deployed.\
    \  Therefore, management may be performed using SNMP\n       or other similar\
    \ methods or directly at the VR console (VRC).\n   8.  Industry-standard troubleshooting\
    \ tools such as 'ping,'\n       'traceroute,' in a routing domain domain comprised\
    \ exclusively of\n       dedicated physical routers.  Therefore, monitoring and\
    \ .bp\n       troubleshooting may be performed using SNMP or similar methods,\n\
    \       but may also include the use of these standard tools. Again, the\n   \
    \    VRC may be used for these purposes just like any physical router.\n   9.\
    \  Since the VRC is visible to the user, router specific security\n       checks\
    \ need to be put in place to make sure the VPN user is\n       allowed access\
    \ to Layer 3 resources in that VPN only and is\n       disallowed from accessing\
    \ physical resources in the router.  Most\n       routers achieve this through\
    \ the use of database views.\n   10. The VRC is available to the SP as well. If\
    \ configuration and\n       monitoring has been outsourced to the SP, the SP may\
    \ use the VRC\n       to accomplish these tasks as if it were the PNA.\n   11.\
    \ The VRs in the SPEDs form the VPN in the SP's network. Together,\n       they\
    \ represent a virtual routing domain. They dynamically\n       discover each other\
    \ by utilizing an emulated LAN resident in the\n       SP's network.\n   Each\
    \ VPN in the SP's network is assigned one and only one multicast\n   address.\
    \ This address is chosen from the administratively scoped\n   range (239.192/14)\
    \ [Meyer] and the only requirement is that the\n   multicast address can be uniquely\
    \ mapped to a specific VPN. This is\n   easily automated by routers by the use\
    \ of a simple function to\n   unambiguously map a VPNid to the multicast address.\
    \  Subscription to\n   this multicast address allows a VR to discover and be discovered\
    \ by\n   other VRs. It is important to note that the multicast address does\n\
    \   not have to be configured.\n   12. Data forwarding may be done in one of several\
    \ ways:\n      1. An LSP with best-effort characteristics that all VPNS can use.\n\
    \      2. An LSP dedicated to a VPN and traffic engineered by the VPN\n      \
    \   customer.\n      3. A private LSP with differentiated characteristics.\n \
    \     4. Policy based forwarding on a dedicated L2 Virtual Circuit\n   The choice\
    \ of the preferred method is negotiable between the SP and\n   the VPN customer,\
    \ perhaps constituting part of the SLA between them.\n   This allows the SP to\
    \ offer different grades of service to different\n   VPN customers.\n   Of course,\
    \ hop-by-hop forwarding is also available to forward routing\n   packets and to\
    \ forward user data packets during periods of LSP\n   establishment and failure.\n\
    \   13. This approach does not mandate that separate operating system\n      \
    \ tasks for each of the routing protocols be run for each VR that\n       the\
    \ SPED houses. Specific implementations may be tailored to the\n       particular\
    \ SPED in use. Maintaining separate routing databases\n       and forwarding tables,\
    \ one per VR, is one way to get the highest\n       performance for a given SPED.\n"
- title: 7. Scalable Configuration
  contents:
  - "7. Scalable Configuration\n   A typical VPN is expected to have 100s to 1000s\
    \ of endpoints within\n   the SP cloud.  Therefore, configuration should scale\
    \ (at most)\n   linearly with the number of end points. To be specific, the\n\
    \   administrator should have to add a couple of configuration items when\n  \
    \ a new customer site joins the set of VRs constituting a specific VPN.\n   Anything\
    \ worse will make this task too daunting for the service\n   provider.  In this\
    \ architecture, all that the service provider needs\n   to allocate and configure\
    \ is the ingress/egress physical link (e.g.\n   Frame Relay DLCI or ATM VPI/VCI)\
    \ and the virtual connection between\n   the VR and the emulated LAN.\n"
- title: 8. Dynamic Neighbor Discovery
  contents:
  - "8. Dynamic Neighbor Discovery\n   The VRs in a given VPN reside in a number of\
    \ SPEDs in the network.\n   These VRs need to learn about each other and be connected.\n\
    \   One way to do this is to require the manual configuration of\n   neighbors.\
    \  As an example, when a new site is added to a VPN, this\n   would require the\
    \ configuration of all the other VRs as neighbors.\n   This is obviously not scalable\
    \ from a configuration and network\n   resource standpoint.\n   The need then\
    \ arises to allow these VRs to dynamically discover each\n   other.  Neighbor\
    \ discovery is facilitated by providing each VPN with\n   a limited emulated LAN.\
    \ This emulated LAN is used in several ways:\n   1. Address resolution uses this\
    \ LAN to resolve next-hop (private) IP\n      addresses associated with the other\
    \ VRs.\n   2. Routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF use this limited emulated\n\
    \      LAN for neighbor discovery and to send routing updates.\n   The per-VPN\
    \ LAN is emulated using an IP multicast address.  In the\n   interest of conserving\
    \ public address space and because this\n   multicast address needs to be visible\
    \ only in the SP network space,\n   we would use an address from the Organizationally\
    \ scoped multicast\n   addresses (239.192/14) as described in [Meyer]. Each VPN\
    \ is allocated\n   an address from this range.  To completely eliminate configuration\
    \ in\n   this regard, this address is computed from the VPNID.\n"

    \   Figure 2 'Virtual Routing Domain'\n   Each Virtual Router is configurable\
    \ by the PNA as though it were a\n   private physical router. Of course, the SP\
    \ limits the resources that\n   this Virtual Router may consume on a SPED-by-SPED\
    \ basis. Each VPN has\n   a number of physical connections (to CPE routers) and\
    \ a number of\n   logical connections (to the emulated LAN). Each connection is\
    \ IP-\n   capable and can be configured to utilize any combination of the\n  \
    \ standard routing protocols and routing policies to achieve specific\n   corporate\
    \ network goals.\n   To illustrate, in Figure 1, 3 VRs reside on 3 SPEDs in VPN\
    \ 1. Router\n   'A' houses VR-A, router 'B' houses VR-B and router 'C' houses\
    \ VR-C.\n   VR-C and VR-B have a physical connection to CPE equipment, while VR-A\n\
    \   has 2 physical connections. Each of the VRs has a fully IP-capable\n   logical\
    \ connection to the emulated LAN.  VR-A has the (physical)\n   connections to\
    \ the headquarters of the company and runs OSPF over\n   those connections. Therefore,\
    \ it can route packets to 172.150.0/18\n   and 172.150.128/18. VR-B runs RIP in\
    \ the branch office (over the\n   physical connection) and uses RIP (over the\
    \ logical connection) to\n   export 172.150.64/18 to VR-A. VR-A advertises a default\
    \ route to VR-B\n   over the logical connection.  Vendors use VR-C as the extranet\n\
    \   connection to connect to the parts database at 172.150.128.1. Hence,\n   VR-C\
    \ advertises a default route to VR-A over the logical connection.\n   VR-A exports\
    \ only 175.150.128.1 to VR-C. This keeps the rest of the\n   corporate network\
    \ from a security problem.\n   The network administrator will configure the following:\n\
    \   1. OSPF connections to the 172.150.0/18 and 172.150.128/18 network\n     \
    \ in VR-A.\n   2. RIP connections to VR-B and VR-C on VR-A.\n   3. Route policies\
    \ on VR-A to advertise only the default route to\n      VR-B.\n   4. Route policies\
    \ on VR-A to advertise only 172.159.128.1 to VR-C.\n   5. RIP on VR-B to VR-A.\n\
    \   6. RIP on VR-C to advertise a default route to VR-A.\n"
- title: 10. Neighbor Discovery Example
  contents:
  - "10. Neighbor Discovery Example\n   In Figure #1, the SPED that houses VR-A (SPED-A)\
    \ uses a public\n   address of 150.0.0.1/24, SPED-B uses 150.0.0.2/24 and SPED-C\
    \ uses\n   150.0.0.3/24.  As noted, the connection between the VRs is via an\n\
    \   emulated LAN.  For interface addresses on the emulated LAN\n   connection,\
    \ VR-A uses 10.0.0.1/24, VR-B uses 10.0.0.2/24 and VR-C\n   uses 10.0.0.3/24.\n\
    \   Let's take the case of VR-A sending a packet to VR-B. To get VR-B's\n   address\
    \ (SPED-B's address), VR-A sends an ARP request packet with the\n   address of\
    \ VR-B (10.0.0.2) as the logical address. The source logical\n   address is 10.0.0.1\
    \ and the hardware address is 151.0.0.1. This ARP\n   request is encapsulated\
    \ in this VPN's multicast address and sent out.\n   SPED B and SPED-C receive\
    \ a copy of the packet.  SPED-B recognizes\n   10.0.0.2 in the context of VPN\
    \ 1 and responds with 152.0.0.2 as the\n   \"hardware\" address. This response\
    \ is sent to the VPN multicast\n   address to promote the use of promiscuous ARP\
    \ and the resulting\n   decrease in network traffic.\n   Manual configuration\
    \ would be necessary if neighbor discovery were\n   not used. In this example,\
    \ VR-A would be configured with a static ARP\n   entry for VR-B's logical address\
    \ (10.0.0.1) with the \"hardware\"\n   address set to 152.0.0.2.\n"

  - "11. Forwarding\n   As mentioned in the architectural outline, data forwarding\
    \ may be\n   done in one of several ways. In all techniques except the Hop-by-Hop\n\
    \   technique for forwarding routing/control packets, the actual method\n   is\
    \ configurable. At the high end, policy based forwarding for quick\n   service\
    \ and at the other end best effort forwarding using public LSP\n   is used. The\
    \ order of forwarding preference is as follows:\n   1. Policy based forwarding.\n\
    \   2. Optionally configured private LSP.\n   3. Best-effort public LSP.\n"
- title: 11.1  Private LSP
  contents:
  - "11.1  Private LSP\n   This LSP is optionally configured on a per-VPN basis. This\
    \ LSP is\n   usually associated with non-zero bandwidth reservation and/or a\n\
    \   specific differentiated service or QOS class. If this LSP is\n   available,\
    \ it is used for user data and for VPN private control data\n   forwarding.\n"
- title: 11.2 Best Effort Public LSP
  contents:
  - "11.2 Best Effort Public LSP\n   VPN data packets are forwarded using this LSP\
    \ if a private LSP with\n   specified bandwidth and/or QOS characteristics is\
    \ either not\n   configured or not presently available. The LSP used is the one\n\
    \   destined for the egress router in VPN 0. The VPNID in the shim header\n  \
    \ is used to de-multiplex data packets from various VPNs at the egress\n   router.\n"
- title: 12.  Differentiated Services
  contents:
  - "12.  Differentiated Services\n   Configuring private LSPs for VPNs allows the\
    \ SP to offer\n   differentiated services to paying customers. These private LSPs\
    \ could\n   be associated with any available L2 QOS class or Diff-Serv\n   codepoints.\
    \ In a VPN, multiple private LSPs with different service\n   classes could be\
    \ configured with flow profiles for sorting the\n   packets among the LSPs. This\
    \ feature, together with the ability to\n   size the virtual routers, allows the\

- title: 13.1  Routing Security
  contents:
  - "13.1  Routing Security\n   The use of standard routing protocols such as OSPF\
    \ and BGP in their\n   unmodified form means that all the encryption and security\
    \ methods\n   (such as MD5 authentication of neighbors) are fully available in\
    \ VRs.\n   Making sure that routes are not accidentally leaked from one VPN to\n\
    \   another is an implementation issue. One way to achieve this is to\n   maintain\
    \ separate routing and forwarding databases.\n"
- title: 13.2  Data Security

  - "13.2  Data Security\n   This allows the SP to assure the VPN customer that data\
    \ packets in\n   one VPN never have the opportunity to wander into another. From\
    \ a\n   routing standpoint, this could be achieved by maintaining separate\n \
    \  routing databases for each virtual router. From a data forwarding\n   standpoint,\
    \ the use of label stacks in the case of shared LSPs\n   [Rosen2] [Callon] or\

    \   between offices of a corporation. Obviously, the SP has to guarantee\n   that\
    \ the PNA and the PNA's designees are the only ones who have\n   access to the\
    \ VRs on the SPEDs the private network has connections\n   to. Since the virtual\
    \ router console is functionally equivalent to a\n   physical router, all of the\
    \ authentication methods available on a\n   physical console such as password,\
    \ RADIUS, etc. are available to the\n   PNA.\n"
- title: 13.4 Physical Network Security
  contents:
  - "13.4 Physical Network Security\n   When a PNA logs in to a SPED to configure\

    \ only layer 3\n   configuration and monitoring privileges for the VR. Specifically,\
    \ the\n   PNA has no configuration privileges for the physical network. This\n\
    \   provides the guarantee to the SP that a VPN administrator will not be\n  \
    \ able to inadvertently or otherwise adversely affect the SP's network.\n"

- title: 15. Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "15. Performance Considerations\n   For the purposes of discussing performance\
    \ and scaling issues,\n   today's routers can be split into two planes: the routing\
    \ (control)\n   plane and the forwarding plane.\n   In looking at the routing\
    \ plane, most modern-day routing protocols\n   use some form of optimized calculation\
    \ methodologies to calculate the\n   shortest path(s) to end stations. For instance,\
    \ OSPF and ISIS use the\n   Djikstra algorithm while BGP uses the \"Decision Process\"\
    . These\n   algorithms are based on parsing the routing database and computing\n\
    \   the best paths to end stations. The performance characteristics of\n   any\
    \ of these algorithms is based on either topological\n   characteristics (ISIS\
    \ and OSPF) or the number of ASs in the path to\n   the destinations (BGP). But\
    \ it is important to note that the overhead\n   in setting up and beginning these\
    \ calculations is very little for\n   most any modern day router. This is because,\
    \ although we refer to\n   routing calculation input as \"databases\", these are\
    \ memory resident\n   data structures.\n   Therefore, the following conclusions\
    \ can be drawn:\n   1. Beginning a routing calculation for a routing domain is\
    \ nothing\n      more than setting up some registers to point to the right database\n\
    \      objects.\n   2. Based on 1, the performance of a given algorithm is not\n\
    \      significantly worsened by the overhead required to set it up.\n   3. Based\
    \ on 2, it follows that, when a number of routing calculations\n      for a number\
    \ of virtual routers has to be performed by a physical\n      router, the complexity\
    \ of the resulting routing calculation is\n      nothing more than the sum of\
    \ the complexities of the routing\n      calculations of the individual virtual\
    \ routers.\n   4. Based on 3, it follows that whether an overlay model is used\
    \ or a\n      virtual routing model is employed, the performance characteristics\n\
    \      of a router are dependent purely on its hardware capabilities and\n   \
    \   the choice of data structures and algorithms.\n   To illustrate, let's say\
    \ a physical router houses N VPNs, all running\n   some routing protocol say RP.\
    \ Let's also suppose that the average\n   performance of RP's routing calculation\
    \ algorithm is  f(X,Y) where x\n   and y are parameters that determine performance\
    \ of the algorithm for\n   that routing protocol. As an example, for Djikstra\
    \ algorithm users\n   such as OSPF, X could be the number of nodes in the area\
    \ while Y\n   could be the number of links. The performance of an arbitrary VPN\
    \ n\n   is f (Xn, Yn). The performance of the (physical) router is the sum of\n\
    \   f(Xi, Yi) for all values of i in 0 <= i <= N. This conclusion is\n   independent\
    \ of the chosen VPN approach (virtual router or overlay\n   model).\n   In the\
    \ usual case, the forwarding plane has two inputs: the\n   forwarding table and\
    \ the packet header. The main performance\n   parameter is the lookup algorithm.\
    \ The very best performance one can\n   get for a IP routing table lookup is by\
    \ organizing the table as some\n   form of a tree and use binary search methods\
    \ to do the actual lookup.\n   The performance of this algorithm is O(log n).\n\
    \   Hence, as long as the virtual routers' routing tables are distinct\n   from\
    \ each other, the lookup cost is constant for finding the routing\n   table and\
    \ O(log n) to find the entry. This is no worse or different\n   from any router\
    \ and no different from a router that employs overlay\n   techniques to deliver\
    \ VPN services. However, when the overlay router\n   utilizes integration of multiple\
    \ VPNs' routing tables, the\n   performance is O(log m*n) where 'm' is the number\
    \ of VPNs that the\n   routing table holds routes for.\n"
