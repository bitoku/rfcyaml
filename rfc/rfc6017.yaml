  - "Abstract\n   With the maturity of the Electronic Data Interchange - Internet\n\
    \   Integration (EDIINT) standards of AS1, AS2, and AS3, applications and\n  \
    \ additional features are being built upon the basic secure transport\n   functionality.\
    \  These features are not necessarily supported by all\n   EDIINT applications\
    \ and could cause potential problems with\n   implementations.  The EDIINT-Features\
    \ header field provides a means\n   to resolve these problems and support new\
    \ functionality.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   EDIINT applications provide for a secure means of payload\
    \ document\n   transport.  The original intent was for transport of a single EDI\
    \ or\n   XML document.  However, as AS1 [RFC3335], AS2 [RFC4130], and AS3\n  \
    \ [RFC4823] matured, other features and application logic were\n   implemented\
    \ upon EDIINT standards.  Since these features go beyond\n   (but do not violate)\
    \ the basic premise of EDIINT, a means is needed\n   to communicate to trading\
    \ partners features that are supported by the\n   originating user agent.  The\
    \ EDIINT-Features header indicates the\n   capability of the user agent to support\
    \ the listed feature with its\n   trading partner without out-of-band communication\
    \ and agreement.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  EDIINT-Features Header Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.  EDIINT-Features Header Syntax\n   The EDIINT-Features header can appear in\
    \ the header section of an\n   AS1, AS2, and AS3 message.  Its ABNF [RFC5234]\
    \ syntax is listed\n   below.\n   Feature       = \"EDIINT-Features:\" [WSP] Feature-Name\
    \ *([WSP] \",\"\n                   [WSP] Feature-Name)\n   Feature-Name  = 1*Feature-Token\n\
    \   Feature-Token = %d48-57 / ; 0-9\n                   %d65-90 / ; A-Z\n    \
    \               %d97-122 / ; a-z\n                   \"-\" ; hyphen is allowed\n\
    \                   ; blank space \" \" is not allowed\n   The Feature-Token allows\
    \ for feature names to be specified and can\n   only contain alphanumeric characters\
    \ along with the hyphen.  Feature\n   names are case insensitive.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation and Processing
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation and Processing\n   The EDIINT-Features header field indicates\
    \ the originating user agent\n   is capable of supporting the features listed.\
    \  The EDIINT-Features\n   header field MUST be present in all messages transmitted\
    \ by the user\n   agent and not just messages that utilize the feature.  Upon\n\
    \   examination of the EDIINT-Features header field, the trading partner\n   SHOULD\
    \ assume the user agent is capable of receiving messages\n   utilizing any of\
    \ the features listed.\n   Features that utilize the EDIINT-Features header field\
    \ MUST be\n   specified in RFCs.  These RFCs MUST describe the feature name that\
    \ is\n   listed in the header and the means by which it should be used.\n"
- title: 4.  EDIINT Applications
  contents:
  - "4.  EDIINT Applications\n   AS2 and AS3 applications currently use a version\
    \ header, AS2-Version\n   and AS3-Version, respectively, to indicate functional\
    \ support.  The\n   EDIINT-Features header field tremendously improves the purpose\
    \ and\n   function of the old version header.  However, to provide a connection\n\
    \   from the old version header and the EDIINT-Features header field, AS2\n  \
    \ and AS3 applications that implement the EDIINT-Features header field\n   MUST\
    \ use the version value of \"1.2\" to indicate the support of the\n   EDIINT-Features\
    \ header field.  Also, since version \"1.1\" indicates\n   the implementation\
    \ supports compression [RFC5402] and \"1.2\" builds\n   upon \"1.1\", AS2-Version\
    \ or AS3-Version of \"1.2\" MUST support\n   compression regardless of whether\
    \ it is mentioned as a feature in the\n   EDIINT-Features header field.\n   AS1\
    \ does not use a version header and one is not required for\n   including the\
    \ EDIINT-Features header field.\n   The EDIINT-Features header field is informational,\
    \ and AS1, AS2, or\n   AS3 trading partners who have not implemented it can safely\
    \ ignore\n   this header.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the following provisional header.\n\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Because headers are often un-encrypted, it may\
    \ be possible for the\n   EDIINT-Features header field to be altered.  Trading\
    \ partners MAY\n   consult out-of-band to confirm feature support.\n"
