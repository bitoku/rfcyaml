- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The SPECIAL-USE capability of the IMAP protocol (RFC 6154) allows\n\
    \   clients to identify special-use mailboxes, e.g., where draft or sent\n   messages\
    \ should be put.  This simplifies client configuration.  In\n   contrast, the\
    \ Sieve mail filtering language (RFC 5228) currently has\n   no such capability.\
    \  This memo defines a Sieve extension that fills\n   this gap: it adds a test\
    \ for checking whether a special-use attribute\n   is assigned for a particular\
    \ mailbox or any mailbox, and it adds the\n   ability to file messages into a\
    \ mailbox identified solely by a\n   special-use attribute.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Commonly, several mailboxes in an IMAP message store [IMAP]\
    \ have a\n   special use.  For example, there can be a special-use mailbox for\n\
    \   storing the user's draft messages, for keeping copies of sent\n   messages,\
    \ and for collecting spam messages that were classified as\n   such at delivery.\
    \  The SPECIAL-USE capability [SPECIAL-USE] of the\n   IMAP protocol defines mailbox\
    \ attributes that identify these special\n   mailboxes explicitly to the client.\
    \  This way, client configuration\n   is simplified significantly.  Using the\
    \ CREATE-SPECIAL-USE capability\n   [SPECIAL-USE], IMAP clients can also configure\
    \ these attributes\n   dynamically based on user preference.\n   Unlike the IMAP\
    \ protocol, the Sieve mail filtering language [SIEVE]\n   currently cannot freely\
    \ access these special-use mailbox attributes.\n   Particularly, the Sieve interpreter\
    \ has no means to identify a\n   mailbox with a particular special-use attribute.\
    \  This would be very\n   useful, for example, to find the user's \"Spam\" mailbox\
    \ at delivery.\n   In Sieve, limited access to the special-use attributes is provided\n\
    \   using the \"mboxmetadata\" extension [SIEVE-MAILBOX], which allows\n   testing\
    \ for the presence of a special-use attribute in the \"/private/\n   specialuse\"\
    \ IMAP METADATA [IMAP-METADATA] entry of a mailbox.  Still,\n   not all implementers\
    \ will be willing to add the complexity of the\n   IMAP METADATA capability just\
    \ to provide access to special-use\n   attributes to the Sieve interpreter.\n\
    \   This document defines an extension to the Sieve mail filtering\n   language\
    \ that adds the ability to freely access mailbox special-use\n   attributes. \
    \ It adds a test called \"specialuse_exists\" that checks 1)\n   whether a special-use\
    \ attribute is assigned for a particular mailbox\n   or 2) whether any of the\
    \ user's personal mailboxes have a special-use\n   attribute assigned.  It also\
    \ adds the ability to file messages into a\n   personal mailbox identified by\
    \ a particular special-use attribute\n   rather than the mailbox's name.  This\
    \ is achieved using the new\n   \":specialuse\" argument for the \"fileinto\"\
    \ command [SIEVE].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Equivalent IMAP Operations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Equivalent IMAP Operations\n   To clarify, the following IMAP protocol\
    \ examples show a sequence of\n   [IMAP] commands that a client could send to\
    \ perform an assessment\n   without Sieve that is equivalent to the \"specialuse_exists\"\
    \ test.\n   First, the client queries which namespaces are available using the\n\
    \   NAMESPACE command [NAMESPACE]:\n   C: A01 NAMESPACE\n   S: * NAMESPACE ((\"\
    INBOX/\" \"/\")(\"Archive/\" \"/\")) NIL ((\"Public/\" \"/\"))\n   S: A01 OK NAMESPACE\
    \ command completed\n   Subsequently, when no particular mailbox is of interest\
    \ (i.e., the\n   \"specialuse_exists\" test has no mailbox argument), the client\
    \ lists\n   all mailboxes with special-use attributes in the two returned\n  \
    \ personal namespaces (this extended LIST command requires the LIST-\n   EXTENDED\
    \ IMAP capability [LIST-EXTENDED]):\n   C: A02 LIST (SPECIAL-USE) \"\" (\"INBOX/*\"\
    \ \"Archive/*\")\n       RETURN (SPECIAL-USE)\n   S: * LIST (\\Drafts) \"/\" INBOX/Drafts\n\
    \   S: * LIST (\\Trash) \"/\" INBOX/Trash\n   S: * LIST (\\Sent) \"/\" INBOX/Sent\n\
    \   S: * LIST (\\Archive) \"/\" Archive/Default\n   S: A02 OK LIST command completed\n\
    \   Finally, using the MYRIGHTS command [IMAP-ACL], the client determines\n  \
    \ the access rights it has for the mailbox or mailboxes that have all\n   the\
    \ requested attributes assigned.  This way, it can determine\n   whether messages\
    \ can be saved to any of those.  In this example, an\n   \"\\Archive\" special-use\
    \ mailbox is sought:\n   C: A03 MYRIGHTS Archive/Default\n   S: * MYRIGHTS Archive/Default\
    \ lrwsip\n   S: A03 OK Myrights completed\n   The MYRIGHTS response indicates\
    \ that the user has \"insert\" rights\n   [IMAP-ACL] for the \"Archive/Default\"\
    \ mailbox, meaning that the client\n   can deliver (APPEND) messages to that mailbox\
    \ and that the Sieve\n   \"specialuse_exists\" test would yield \"true\" in this\
    \ case.\n"
- title: 4.  ":specialuse" Argument to "fileinto" Command
  contents:
  - "4.  \":specialuse\" Argument to \"fileinto\" Command\n   Usage:  fileinto [:specialuse\
    \ <special-use-attr: string>]\n                    <mailbox: string>\n   Normally,\
    \ the \"fileinto\" command delivers the message in the mailbox\n   specified using\
    \ its positional mailbox argument, which is the name of\n   the mailbox.  However,\
    \ if the optional \":specialuse\" argument is also\n   specified, the \"fileinto\"\
    \ command first checks whether a mailbox\n   exists in the user's personal namespace\
    \ [NAMESPACE] with the\n   specified special-use attribute assigned to it.  If\
    \ that is the case,\n   that special-use mailbox is used for delivery instead.\
    \  If there is\n   no such mailbox or if the specified special-use attribute is\
    \ unknown\n   to the implementation in general, the \"fileinto\" action proceeds\
    \ as\n   it would without the \":specialuse\" argument.\n   Summarizing, if the\
    \ \":specialuse\" argument is specified, the\n   \"fileinto\" command deals with\
    \ two mailboxes that may or may not exist\n   and may, in fact, be equal:\n  \
    \ o  A special-use mailbox in the user's personal namespace, which has\n     \
    \ at least the special-use attribute specified with the\n      \":specialuse\"\
    \ argument assigned to it.  The name for this mailbox\n      is not relevant here;\
    \ it is only identified by the assigned\n      special-use attribute.\n   o  The\
    \ default mailbox named by the positional string argument of the\n      \"fileinto\"\
    \ command, which is used when the special-use mailbox is\n      not found.\n \
    \  The special-use attribute specified with the \":specialuse\" argument\n   conforms\
    \ to the \"use-attr\" syntax described in Section 6 of RFC 6154\n   [SPECIAL-USE].\
    \  Implementations SHOULD handle an invalid special-use\n   attribute in the same\
    \ way as an invalid mailbox name is handled.  The\n   string parameter of the\
    \ \":specialuse\" argument is not a constant\n   string, which means that variable\
    \ substitutions are allowed when the\n   \"variables\" extension [VARIABLES] is\
    \ active.  In that case, the\n   syntax of the special-use attribute is only verified\
    \ at runtime.\n   If neither the special-use mailbox nor the default mailbox exists,\n\
    \   the \"fileinto\" action MUST proceed exactly as it does in case the\n   \"\
    :specialuse\" argument is absent and the mailbox named by its\n   positional argument\
    \ does not exist.  The various options for handling\n   this situation are described\
    \ in Section 4.1 of RFC 5228 [SIEVE].\n   More than one mailbox in the user's\
    \ personal namespace can have a\n   particular special-use attribute assigned.\
    \  If one of those mailboxes\n   is, in fact, the default mailbox named by the\
    \ positional string\n   argument of the \"fileinto\" command, that mailbox MUST\
    \ be used for\n   delivery.  If the default mailbox is not one of the options,\
    \ the\n   mailbox that is chosen for delivery is implementation defined.\n   However,\
    \ while the set of mailboxes to which the involved special-use\n   attribute are\
    \ assigned remains unchanged, implementations SHOULD\n   ensure that the mailbox\
    \ choice is made consistently, so that the same\n   mailbox is used every time.\
    \  Conversely, the chosen mailbox MAY\n   change once the assignments of the special-use\
    \ attribute that are\n   relevant for the mailbox choice are changed (usually\
    \ by user\n   interaction).\n   If delivery to the special-use mailbox fails for\
    \ reasons not relating\n   to its existence, the Sieve interpreter MUST NOT subsequently\
    \ attempt\n   delivery in the indicated default mailbox as a fallback.  Instead,\
    \ it\n   MUST proceed exactly as it does in case the \":specialuse\" argument\
    \ is\n   absent and delivery to the mailbox named by its positional argument\n\
    \   fails.  This prevents the situation where messages are unexpectedly\n   spread\
    \ over two mailboxes in case transient or intermittent delivery\n   failures occur.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Mailboxes Created Implicitly by the "fileinto" Command
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Mailboxes Created Implicitly by the \"fileinto\" Command\n   Before attempting\
    \ to deliver the message into the specified mailbox,\n   the \"fileinto\" command\
    \ may implicitly create the mailbox if it does\n   not exist (see Section 4.1\
    \ of RFC 5228 [SIEVE]).  This optional\n   behavior can be requested explicitly\
    \ using the \"mailbox\" extension\n   [SIEVE-MAILBOX], which adds the optional\
    \ \":create\" argument to the\n   \"fileinto\" command.  If the \":create\" argument\
    \ is specified with\n   \"fileinto\", it instructs the Sieve interpreter to unconditionally\n\
    \   create the specified mailbox if needed.  Note that the \":create\"\n   argument\
    \ has no effect when the implicit creation of mailboxes for\n   delivery is the\
    \ default behavior.\n   When the \":specialuse\" argument is present, this behavior\
    \ does not\n   change; the Sieve interpreter will implicitly create the specified\n\
    \   default mailbox if needed.  This need arises when both the special-\n   use\
    \ mailbox and the default mailbox are not found.\n   If the server implementation\
    \ supports the CREATE-SPECIAL-USE\n   capability [SPECIAL-USE] for IMAP (i.e.,\
    \ it allows assigning special-\n   use attributes to new mailboxes), it SHOULD\
    \ assign the special-use\n   attribute specified with the \":specialuse\" argument\
    \ to the newly\n   created mailbox.\n"
