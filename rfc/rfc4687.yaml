- title: 3.  Motivations
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivations\n   OAM for MPLS networks has been established as a fundamental\n\
    \   requirement both through operational experience and through its\n   documentation\
    \ in numerous Internet Drafts.  Many such documents (for\n   example, [RFC4379],\
    \ [RFC3812], [RFC3813], [RFC3814], and [RFC3815])\n   developed specific solutions\
    \ to individual issues or problems.\n   Coordination of the full OAM requirements\
    \ for MPLS was achieved by\n   [RFC4377] in recognition of the fact that the previous\
    \ piecemeal\n   approach could lead to inconsistent and inefficient applicability\
    \ of\n   OAM techniques across the MPLS architecture, and might require\n   significant\
    \ modifications to operational procedures and systems in\n   order to provide\
    \ consistent and useful OAM functionality.\n   This document builds on these realizations\
    \ and extends the statements\n   of MPLS OAM requirements to cover the new area\
    \ of P2MP MPLS.  That\n   is, this document captures the requirements for P2MP\
    \ MPLS OAM in\n   advance of the development of specific solutions.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ at the time of writing, some effort had already been\n   expended to extend\
    \ existing MPLS OAM solutions to cover P2MP MPLS\n   (for example, [P2MP-LSP-PING]).\
    \  While this approach of extending\n   existing solutions may be reasonable,\
    \ in order to ensure a consistent\n   OAM framework it is necessary to articulate\
    \ the full set of\n   requirements in a single document.  This will facilitate\
    \ a uniform\n   set of MPLS OAM solutions spanning multiple MPLS deployments and\n\
    \   concurrent applications.\n"
- title: 4.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  General Requirements\n   The general requirements described in this section\
    \ are similar to\n   those described for point-to-point MPLS in [RFC4377].  The\n\
    \   subsections below do not repeat material from [RFC4377], but simply\n   give\
    \ references to that document.\n   However, where the requirements for P2MP MPLS\
    \ OAM differ from or are\n   more extensive than those expressed in [RFC4377],\
    \ additional text is\n   supplied.\n   In general, it should be noted that P2MP\
    \ LSPs introduce a scalability\n   issue with respect to OAM that is not present\
    \ in point-to-point MPLS.\n   That is, an individual P2MP LSP will have more than\
    \ one egress and\n   the path to those egresses will very probably not be linear\
    \ (for\n   example, it may have a tree structure).  Since the number of egresses\n\
    \   for a single P2MP LSP is unknown and not bounded by any small number,\n  \
    \ it follows that all mechanisms defined for OAM support MUST scale\n   well with\
    \ the number of egresses and the complexity of the path of\n   the LSP.  Mechanisms\
    \ that are able to deal with individual egresses\n   will scale no worse than\
    \ similar mechanisms for point-to-point LSPs,\n   but it is desirable to develop\
    \ mechanisms that are able to leverage\n   the fact that multiple egresses are\
    \ associated with a single LSP, and\n   so achieve better scaling.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Detection of Label Switch Path Defects
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Detection of Label Switch Path Defects\n   The ability to detect defects\
    \ in a P2MP LSP SHOULD not require\n   manual, hop-by-hop troubleshooting of each\
    \ LSR used to switch traffic\n   for that LSP, and SHOULD rely on proactive OAM\
    \ procedures (such as\n   continuous path connectivity and Service Level Agreement\
    \ (SLA)\n   measurement mechanisms).  Any solutions SHOULD either extend or work\n\
    \   in close conjunction with existing solutions developed for point-to-\n   point\
    \ MPLS, such as those specified in [RFC4379] where this\n   requirement is not\
    \ contradicted by the other requirements in this\n   section.  This will leverage\
    \ existing software and hardware\n   deployments.\n   Note that P2MP LSPs may\
    \ introduce additional scaling concerns for LSP\n   probing by tools such as [RFC4379].\
    \  As the number of leaves of a\n   P2MP LSP increases it potentially becomes\
    \ more expensive to inspect\n   the LSP to detect defects.  Any tool developed\
    \ for this purpose MUST\n   be cognitive of this issue and MUST include techniques\
    \ to reduce the\n   scaling impact of an increase in the number of leaves.  Nevertheless,\n\
    \   it should also be noted that the introduction of additional leaves\n   may\
    \ mean that the use of techniques such as [RFC4379] are less\n   appropriate for\
    \ defect detection with P2MP LSPs, while the technique\n   may still remain useful\
    \ for defect diagnosis as described in the next\n   section.\n   Due to the above\
    \ scaling concerns, LSRs or other network resources\n   MUST NOT be overwhelmed\
    \ by the operation of normal proactive OAM\n   procedures, and measures taken\
    \ to protect LSRs and network resources\n   against being overwhelmed MUST NOT\
    \ degrade the operational value or\n   responsiveness of proactive OAM procedures.\
    \  Note that reactive OAM\n   may violate these limits (i.e., cause visible traffic\
    \ degradation) if\n   it is necessary or useful to try to fix whatever has gone\
    \ wrong.\n   By \"overwhelmed\" we mean that it MUST NOT be possible for an LSR\
    \ to\n   be so busy handling proactive OAM that it is unable to continue to\n\
    \   process control or data plane traffic at its advertised rate.\n   Similarly,\
    \ a network resource (such as a data link) MUST NOT be\n   carrying so much proactive\
    \ OAM traffic that it is unable to carry the\n   advertised data rate.  At the\
    \ same time, it is important to configure\n   proactive OAM, if it is in use,\
    \ not to raise alarms caused by the\n   failure to receive an OAM message if the\
    \ component responsible for\n   processing the messages is unable to process because\
    \ other components\n   are consuming too many system resources -- such alarms\
    \ might turn out\n   to be false.\n   In practice, of course, the requirements\
    \ in the previous paragraph\n   may be met by careful specification of the anticipated\
    \ data\n   throughput of LSRs or data links.  However, it should be recalled\n\
    \   that proactive OAM procedures may be scaled linearly with the number\n   of\
    \ LSPs, and the number of LSPs is not necessarily a function of the\n   available\
    \ bandwidth in an LSR or on a data link.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switch Path
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Diagnosis of a Broken Label Switch Path\n   The ability to diagnose a broken\
    \ P2MP LSP and to isolate the failed\n   component (i.e., link or node) in the\
    \ path is REQUIRED.  These\n   functions include a path connectivity test that\
    \ can test all branches\n   and leaves of a P2MP LSP for reachability, as well\
    \ as a path tracing\n   function.  Note that this requirement is distinct from\
    \ the\n   requirement to detect errors or failures described in the previous\n\
    \   section.  In practice, Detection and Diagnosis/Isolation MAY be\n   performed\
    \ by separate or the same mechanisms according to the way in\n   which the other\
    \ requirements are met.\n   It MUST be possible for the operator (or an automated\
    \ process) to\n   stipulate a timeout after which the failure to see a response\
    \ shall\n   be flagged as an error.\n   Any mechanism developed to perform these\
    \ functions is subject to the\n   scalability concerns expressed in section 4.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Path Characterization
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Path Characterization\n   The path characterization function [RFC4377]\
    \ is the ability to reveal\n   details of LSR forwarding operations for P2MP LSPs.\
    \  These details\n   can then be compared later during subsequent testing relevant\
    \ to OAM\n   functionality.  Therefore, LSRs supporting P2MP LSPs MUST provide\n\
    \   mechanisms that allow operators to interrogate and characterize P2MP\n   paths.\n\
    \   Since P2MP paths are more complex than the paths of point-to-point\n   LSPs,\
    \ the scaling concerns expressed in section 4 apply.\n   Note that path characterization\
    \ SHOULD lead to the operator being\n   able to determine the full tree for a\
    \ P2MP LSP.  That is, it is not\n   sufficient to know the list of LSRs in the\
    \ tree, but it is important\n   to know their relative order and where the LSP\
    \ branches.\n   Since, in some cases, the control plane state and data paths may\n\
    \   branch at different points from the control plane and data plane\n   topologies\
    \ (for example, Figure 1), it is not sufficient to present\n   the order of LSRs,\

- title: 4.4.  Service Level Agreement Measurement
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Service Level Agreement Measurement\n   Mechanisms are required to measure\
    \ the diverse aspects of Service\n   Level Agreements for services that utilize\
    \ P2MP LSPs.  The aspects\n   are listed in [RFC4377].\n   Service Level Agreements\
    \ are often measured in terms of the quality\n   and rate of data delivery.  In\
    \ the context of P2MP MPLS, data is\n   delivered to multiple egress nodes.  The\
    \ mechanisms MUST, therefore,\n   be capable of measuring the aspects of Service\
    \ Level Agreements as\n   they apply to each of the egress points to a P2MP LSP.\
    \  At the same\n   time, in order to diagnose issues with meeting Service Level\n\
    \   Agreements, mechanisms SHOULD be provided to measure the aspects of\n   the\
    \ agreements at key points within the network such as at branch\n   nodes on the\
    \ P2MP tree.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Frequency of OAM Execution
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Frequency of OAM Execution\n   As stipulated in [RFC4377], the operator\
    \ MUST have the flexibility to\n   configure OAM parameters to meet their specific\
    \ operational\n   requirements.  This requirement is potentially more important\
    \ in P2MP\n   deployments where the effects of the execution of OAM functions\
    \ can\n   be potentially much greater than in a non-P2MP configuration.  For\n\
    \   example, a mechanism that causes each egress of a P2MP LSP to respond\n  \
    \ could result in a large burst of responses to a single OAM request.\n   Therefore,\
    \ solutions produced SHOULD NOT impose any fixed limitations\n   on the frequency\
    \ of the execution of any OAM functions.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Alarm Suppression, Aggregation, and Layer Coordination
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Alarm Suppression, Aggregation, and Layer Coordination\n   As described\
    \ in [RFC4377], network elements MUST provide alarm\n   suppression and aggregation\
    \ mechanisms to prevent the generation of\n   superfluous alarms within or across\
    \ network layers.  The same time\n   constraint issues identified in [RFC4377]\
    \ also apply to P2MP LSPs.\n   A P2MP LSP also brings the possibility of a single\
    \ fault causing a\n   larger number of alarms than for a point-to-point LSP. \
    \ This can\n   happen because there are a larger number of downstream LSRs (for\n\
    \   example, a larger number of egresses).  The resultant multiplier in\n   the\
    \ number of alarms could cause swamping of the alarm management\n   systems to\
    \ which the alarms are reported, and serves as a multiplier\n   to the number\
    \ of potentially duplicate alarms raised by the network.\n   Alarm aggregation\
    \ or limitation techniques MUST be applied within any\n   solution, or be available\
    \ within an implementation, so that this\n   scaling issue can be reduced.  Note\
    \ that this requirement introduces\n   a second dimension to the concept of alarm\
    \ aggregation.  Where\n   previously it applied to the correlation and suppression\
    \ of alarms\n   generated by different network layers, it now also applies to\
    \ similar\n   techniques applied to alarms generated by multiple downstream LSRs.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Support for OAM Interworking for Fault Notification
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Support for OAM Interworking for Fault Notification\n   [RFC4377] specifies\
    \ that an LSR supporting the interworking of one or\n   more networking technologies\
    \ over MPLS MUST be able to translate an\n   MPLS defect into the native technology's\
    \ error condition.  This also\n   applies to any LSR supporting P2MP LSPs.  However,\
    \ careful attention\n   to the requirements for alarm suppression stipulated therein\
    \ and in\n   section 4.6 SHOULD be observed.\n   Note that the time constraints\
    \ for fault notification and alarm\n   propagation affect the solutions that might\
    \ be applied to the\n   scalability problem inherent in certain OAM techniques\
    \ applied to\n   P2MP LSPs.  For example, a solution to the issue of a large number\
    \ of\n   egresses all responding to some form of probe request at the same\n \
    \  time might be to make the probes less frequent -- but this might\n   affect\
    \ the ability to detect and/or report faults.\n   Where fault notification to\
    \ the egress is required, there is the\n   possibility that a single fault will\
    \ give rise to multiple\n   notifications, one to each egress node of the P2MP\
    \ that is downstream\n   of the fault.  Any mechanisms MUST manage this scaling\
    \ issue while\n   still continuing to deliver fault notifications in a timely\
    \ manner.\n   Where fault notification to the ingress is required, the mechanisms\n\
    \   MUST ensure that the notification identifies the egress nodes of the\n   P2MP\
    \ LSP that are impacted (that is, those downstream of the fault)\n   and does\
    \ not falsely imply that all egress nodes are impacted.\n"

    \ by LSP mis-merging) is likely\n   to have more far-reaching consequences since\
    \ the traffic will be\n   mis-delivered to multiple receivers.\n   As with the\
    \ OAM functions described in [RFC4377], the performance of\n   diagnostic functions\
    \ and path characterization may involve the\n   extraction of a significant amount\
    \ of information about network\n   construction.  The network operator MAY consider\
    \ this information\n   private and wish to take steps to secure it, but further,\
    \ the volume\n   of this information may be considered as a threat to the integrity\
    \ of\n   the network if it is extracted in bulk.  This issue may be greater in\n\
    \   P2MP MPLS because of the potential for a large number of receivers on\n  \
    \ a single LSP and the consequent extensive path of the LSP.\n"
