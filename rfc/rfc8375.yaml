  - "1.  Introduction\n   Users and devices within a home network (hereafter referred
    to as\n   \"homenet\") require devices and services to be identified by names\n
    \  that are unique within the boundaries of the homenet [RFC7368].  The\n   naming
    mechanism needs to function without configuration from the\n   user.  While it
    may be possible for a name to be delegated by an ISP,\n   homenets must also function
    in the absence of such a delegation.\n   This document reserves the name 'home.arpa.'
    to serve as the default\n   name for this purpose, with a scope limited to each
    individual\n   homenet.\n   This document corrects an error in [RFC7788] by replacing
    '.home'\n   with 'home.arpa.' as the default domain name for homenets. '.home'\n
    \  was selected as the most user-friendly option; however, there are\n   existing
    uses of '.home' that may be in conflict with this use.\n   Evidence indicates
    that '.home' queries frequently leak out and reach\n   the root name servers [ICANN1]
    [ICANN2].\n   In addition, for compatibility with DNSSEC (see Section 6), it's\n
    \  necessary that an insecure delegation (see Section 4.3 of [RFC4035])\n   be
    present for the name.  There is an existing process for allocating\n   names under
    '.arpa.'  [RFC3172].  No such process is available for\n   requesting a similar
    delegation in the root at the request of the\n   IETF, which does not administer
    that zone.  As a result, all\n   unregistered uses of '.home' (that is, all current
    uses at the time\n   of this document's publication), particularly as specified
    in\n   [RFC7788], are deprecated.\n   This document registers the domain 'home.arpa.'
    as a special-use\n   domain name [RFC6761] and specifies the behavior that is
    expected\n   from the Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names\n
    \  whose rightmost non-terminal labels are 'home.arpa.'.  Queries for\n   names
    ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance within the\n   scope of a
    homenet, meaning that identical queries will result in\n   different results from
    one homenet to another.  In other words, a\n   name ending in '.home.arpa.' is
    not globally unique.\n   Although this document makes specific reference to [RFC7788],
    it is\n   not intended that the use of 'home.arpa.' be restricted solely to\n
    \  networks where HNCP is deployed.  Rather, 'home.arpa.' is intended to\n   be
    the correct domain for uses like the one described for '.home' in\n   [RFC7788]:
    local name service in residential homenets.\n"

  title: 2.  Requirements Language
- contents:
  - "3.  General Guidance\n   The domain name 'home.arpa.' is to be used for naming
    within\n   residential homenets.  Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a\n
    \  zone that is served locally, the contents of which are unique only to\n   a
    particular homenet and are not globally unique.  Such names refer\n   to nodes
    and/or services that are located within a homenet (e.g., a\n   printer or a toaster).\n
    \  DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using\n   local
    resolvers on the homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively\n   forwarded
    to servers outside the logical boundaries of the homenet.\n   Some service discovery
    user interfaces that are expected to be used\n   on homenets conceal information
    such as domain names from end users.\n   However, in some cases, it is still expected
    that users will need to\n   see, remember, and even type names ending with '.home.arpa.'.
    \ The\n   Homenet Working Group hopes that this name will in some way indicate\n
    \  to as many readers as possible that such domain names are referring\n   to
    devices in the home, but we recognize that it is an imperfect\n   solution.\n"
  title: 3.  General Guidance
- contents:
  - "4.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations\n   This section specifies considerations
    for systems involved in domain\n   name resolution when resolving queries for
    names ending with\n   '.home.arpa.'.  Each item in this section addresses some
    aspect of\n   the DNS or the process of resolving domain names that would be\n
    \  affected by this special-use allocation.  Detailed explanations of\n   these
    items can be found in Section 5 of [RFC6761].  Although the\n   term 'homenet'
    in [RFC7788] refers to home networks that implement a\n   particular set of features,
    in this document the term is used to mean\n   any home network, regardless of
    the set of features it implements.\n   1.  Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.'
    just as they would\n       use any other domain name.  The 'home.arpa.' name is
    chosen to be\n       readily recognized by users as signifying that the name is\n
    \      addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is\n       connected.\n
    \  2.  Application software SHOULD NOT treat names ending in\n       '.home.arpa.'
    differently than other names.  In particular, there\n       is no basis for trusting
    names that are subdomains of\n       'home.arpa.' (see Section 6).\n   3.  Name
    resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that\n       end in '.home.arpa.'
    as special and MUST NOT treat them as having\n       special significance, except
    that it may be necessary that such\n       APIs not bypass the locally configured
    recursive resolvers.\n       One or more IP addresses for recursive DNS servers
    will usually\n       be supplied to the client through router advertisements or
    DHCP.\n       For an administrative domain that uses subdomains of\n       'home.arpa.',
    such as a homenet, the recursive resolvers provided\n       by that domain will
    be able to answer queries for subdomains of\n       'home.arpa.'; other resolvers
    will not, or they will provide\n       answers that are not correct within that
    administrative domain.\n       A host that is configured to use a resolver other
    than one that\n       has been provided by the local network may be unable to
    resolve,\n       or may receive incorrect results for, subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.\n
    \      In order to avoid this, it is permissible that hosts use the\n       resolvers
    that are locally provided for resolving 'home.arpa.',\n       even when they are
    configured to use other resolvers.\n   4.  There are three considerations for
    recursive resolvers that\n       follow this specification:\n       A.  Recursive
    resolvers at sites using 'home.arpa.'  MUST\n           transparently support
    DNSSEC queries: queries for DNSSEC\n           records and queries with the DNSSEC
    OK (DO) bit set (see\n           Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4035]).  While validation
    is not\n           required, it is strongly encouraged: a caching recursive\n
    \          resolver that does not validate answers that can be validated\n           may
    cache invalid data.  This, in turn, will prevent\n           validating stub resolvers
    from successfully validating\n           answers.\n       B.  Unless configured
    otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS\n           proxies MUST behave as described
    in Section 3 of the Locally\n           Served Zones document [RFC6303].  That
    is, queries for\n           'home.arpa.' and subdomains of 'home.arpa.'  MUST
    NOT be\n           forwarded, with one important exception: a query for a DS\n
    \          record with the DO bit set MUST return the correct answer for\n           that
    question, including correct information in the authority\n           section that
    proves that the record is nonexistent.\n           So, for example, a query for
    the NS record for 'home.arpa.'\n           MUST NOT result in that query being
    forwarded to an upstream\n           cache nor to the authoritative DNS server
    for '.arpa.'.\n           However, as necessary to provide accurate authority\n
    \          information, a query for the DS record MUST result in\n           forwarding
    whatever queries are necessary; typically, this\n           will just be a query
    for the DS record, since the necessary\n           authority information will
    be included in the authority\n           section of the response if the DO bit
    is set.\n       C.  In addition to the behavior specified above, recursive\n           resolvers
    that can be used in a homenet MUST be configurable\n           to forward queries
    for 'home.arpa.' and subdomains of\n           'home.arpa.' to an authoritative
    server for 'home.arpa.'.\n           This server will provide authoritative data
    for 'home.arpa.'\n           within a particular homenet.  The special handling
    for DS\n           records for the 'home.arpa.' delegation is still required.\n
    \          It is permissible to combine the recursive resolver function\n           for
    general DNS lookups with an authoritative resolver for\n           'home.arpa.';
    in this case, rather than forwarding queries\n           for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'
    to an authoritative server,\n           the resolver answers them authoritatively.
    \ The behavior with\n           respect to forwarding queries specifically for
    'home.arpa.'\n           remains the same.\n   5.  No special processing of 'home.arpa.'
    is required for\n       authoritative DNS server implementations.  It is possible
    that an\n       authoritative DNS server might attempt to check the authoritative\n
    \      servers for 'home.arpa.' for a delegation beneath that name\n       before
    answering authoritatively for such a delegated name.  In\n       such a case,
    because the name always has only local significance,\n       there will be no
    such delegation in the 'home.arpa.' zone, and so\n       the server would refuse
    to answer authoritatively for such a\n       zone.  A server that implements this
    sort of check MUST be\n       configurable so that either it does not do this
    check for the\n       'home.arpa.' domain or it ignores the results of the check.\n
    \  6.  DNS server operators MAY configure an authoritative server for\n       'home.arpa.'
    for use in homenets and other home networks.  The\n       operator for the DNS
    servers authoritative for 'home.arpa.' in\n       the global DNS will configure
    any such servers as described in\n       Section 7.\n   7.  'home.arpa.' is a
    subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which\n       is operated by IANA under
    the authority of the Internet\n       Architecture Board according to the rules
    established in\n       [RFC3172].  There are no other registrars for '.arpa'.\n"

    use a different one.  In case\n      multiple are announced, the domain of the

    - "6.1.  Local Significance\n   A DNS record that is returned as a response to
      a query for a Fully\n   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is a subdomain of
      'home.arpa.' is\n   expected to have local significance.  It is expected to
      be returned\n   by a server involved in name resolution for the homenet the
      device is\n   connected in.  However, such a response MUST NOT be considered
      more\n   trustworthy than a similar response for any other DNS query.\n   Because
      'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured\n   using DNSSEC based
      on the root domain's trust anchor, there is no way\n   to tell, using a standard
      DNS query, in which homenet scope an answer\n   belongs.  Consequently, users
      may experience surprising results with\n   such names when roaming to different
      homenets.\n   To prevent this from happening, it could be useful for the resolver\n
      \  on the host to securely differentiate between different homenets and\n   between
      identical names on different homenets.  However, a mechanism\n   for doing this
      has not yet been standardized and doing so is out of\n   scope for this document.
      \ It is expected that this will be explored\n   in future work.\n   The advice
      in [RFC6303], Section 7, to install local trust anchors\n   for locally served
      zones can only work if there is some way of\n   configuring the trust anchor
      in the host.  Homenet currently\n   specifies no mechanism for configuring such
      trust anchors.  As a\n   result, while this advice sounds good, it is not practicable.\n
      \  Also, although it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a\n   particular
      instance of 'home.arpa.', it's reasonable to expect that a\n   host with such
      a trust anchor might, from time to time, connect to\n   more than one network
      with its own instance of 'home.arpa.'.  Such a\n   host would be unable to access
      services on any instance of\n   'home.arpa.' other than the one for which a
      trust anchor was\n   configured.\n   It is, in principle, possible to attach
      an identifier to an instance\n   of 'home.arpa.' that could be used to identify
      which trust anchor to\n   rely on for validating names in that particular instance.
      \ However,\n   the security implications of this are complicated, and such a\n
      \  mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of\n   scope
      for this document.\n"
    title: 6.1.  Local Significance
  - contents:
    - "6.2.  Insecure Delegation\n   It is not possible to install a trust anchor
      (a DS RR) for this zone\n   in the '.arpa' zone.  The reason for this is that
      in order to do so,\n   it would be necessary to have the key-signing key for
      the zone (see\n   Section 5 of [RFC4034]).  Since the zone is not globally unique,
      no\n   one key would work.\n   An alternative would be to provide an authenticated
      denial of\n   existence (see Section 3.2 of [RFC4033]).  This would be done
      simply\n   by not having a delegation from the 'arpa.' zone.  However, this\n
      \  requires the validating resolver to treat 'home.arpa.' specially.  If\n   a
      validating resolver that doesn't treat 'home.arpa.' specially\n   attempts to
      validate a name in 'home.arpa.', an authenticated denial\n   of existence of
      'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.' would cause the\n   validation to fail.  Therefore,
      the only delegation that will allow\n   names under 'home.arpa.' to be resolved
      by all validating resolvers\n   is an insecure delegation, as in Section 7 of
      [RFC6303].\n   Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance
      of\n   the 'home.arpa.' zone being validated is manually configured on the\n
      \  validating resolver, DNSSEC signing and validation of names within\n   the
      'home.arpa.' zone is not possible.\n"

  - contents:
    - "6.3.  Bypassing Manually Configured Resolvers\n   In item 3 of Section 4, an
      exception is made to the behavior of stub\n   resolvers that allows them to
      query local resolvers for subdomains of\n   'home.arpa.' even when they have
      been manually configured to use\n   other resolvers.  This behavior obviously
      has security and privacy\n   implications and may not be desirable depending
      on the context.  It\n   may be better to simply ignore this exception and, when
      one or more\n   recursive resolvers are configured manually, simply fail to
      provide\n   correct answers for subdomains of 'home.arpa.'.  At this time, we
      do\n   not have operational experience that would guide us in making this\n
      \  decision; implementors are encouraged to consider the context in\n   which
