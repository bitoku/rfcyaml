  - "                    DATA TRANSFER RATES (RAND/UCLA)\n   The attached memo indicates\
    \ data rates typical of our use of RJS at\n   UCLA CCN.  Earlier timing tests\
    \ (similar but more detailed) with UCSB\n   showed that most of the time was lost\
    \ because of: (1) channel\n   contention with our disk drive access; (2) our NCP\
    \ runs at a higher\n   priority than batch jobs but lower than text editing and\
    \ interactive\n   graphics; (3) OS interrupt handling is very slow on both ends;\
    \ (4)\n   spooling time of the remote system.\n                              \
    \ MEMORANDUM\nTO:      John Heafner\nFROM:    Bob Hoffman\nCOPIES:  Bob Mobley,\
    \ Herb Shukiar\nHere are some of the transmission rates I have noted over the\
    \ network\nbetween Rand and UCLA.  These were all taken at night when little else\n\
    was happening on our 65.\nSEND TO UCLA\n   # Cards    Blocksize (bytes)  Time\
    \ (secs)   Rate (bits/secs)\n      642        80                   50        \
    \     8218\n      375        80                   30             8000\n      509\
    \       800                   20            16288\nRECEIVE FROM UCLA\n   For all\
    \ figures below, the receiving file has blocksize of 1330\n   bytes, and each\
    \ line is assumed to contain 100 bytes.  This last\n   assumption is fairly accurate,\
    \ since most of the lines were from PL/I\n   for which this is a very good number.\
    \  Thus, for each rate, the\n   number of bytes is the # Lines * 100.\n   # Lines\
    \          Time (secs)      Rate (bits/secs)\n      4900              200    \
    \         19600\n       872               47             14843\n      3900   \
    \           185             16865\n   As you can see from the send figures, blocking\
    \ makes about a 2:1\n   difference.  Memory also recalls a 2 or 3 to 1 advantage\
    \ for blocking\n   on receive when we were getting unblocked files from UCSB.\n\
