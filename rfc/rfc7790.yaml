  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The framework for the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of\n\
    \   internationalized strings (PRECIS) defines several classes of strings\n  \
    \ for use in application protocols.  Because many protocols perform\n   case-sensitive\
    \ or case-insensitive string comparison, it is necessary\n   to define methods\
    \ for case mapping.  In addition, both the\n   Internationalized Domain Names\
    \ in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS\n   problem statement describe mappings\
    \ for internationalized strings\n   that are not limited to case, but include\
    \ width mapping and mapping\n   of delimiters and other special characters that\
    \ can be taken into\n   consideration.  This document provides guidelines for\
    \ designers of\n   PRECIS profiles and describes several mappings that can be\
    \ applied\n   between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to\n\
    \   internationalized protocols.  In particular, this document describes\n   both\
    \ locale-dependent and context-depending case mappings as well as\n   additional\
    \ mappings for delimiters and special characters.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is\
    \ generated\n   through the use of an input method editor (\"IME\") or through\
    \ copy-\n   and-paste from free text.  Users generally do not care about the case\n\
    \   and/or width of input characters because they consider those\n   characters\
    \ to be functionally equivalent or visually identical.\n   Furthermore, users\
    \ rarely switch the IME state to input special\n   characters such as protocol\
    \ elements.\n   For Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), the IDNA Mapping\n\
    \   specification [RFC5895] describes methods for handling these issues.\n   For\
    \ PRECIS strings, case mapping and width mapping are defined in the\n   PRECIS\
    \ framework specification [RFC7564].  The case and width\n   mappings defined\
    \ in the PRECIS framework do not handle other mappings\n   such as delimiter characters,\
    \ special characters, and locale-\n   dependent or context-dependent cases; these\
    \ mappings are also\n   important in order to increase the probability that the\
    \ resulting\n   strings compare as users expect.\n   This document provides guidelines\
    \ for authors of protocol profiles of\n   the PRECIS framework and describes several\
    \ mappings that can be\n   applied between receiving user input and passing permitted\
    \ code\n   points to internationalized protocols.  The delimiter mapping and\n\
    \   special mapping rules described here are applied as \"additional\n   mappings\"\
    \ beyond those defined in the PRECIS framework, whereas the\n   \"local case mapping\"\
    \ rule provides locale-dependent and context-\n   dependent alternative case mappings\
    \ for specific target characters.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol-Dependent Mappings
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol-Dependent Mappings\n   The PRECIS framework defines several protocol-independent\
    \ mappings.\n   The additional mappings and local case mapping defined in this\n\
    \   document are protocol dependent, i.e., they depend on the rules for a\n  \
    \ particular application protocol.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Delimiter Mapping
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Delimiter Mapping\n   Some application protocols define delimiters for\
    \ their own use,\n   resulting in the fact that the delimiters are different for\
    \ each\n   protocol.  The delimiter mapping table should therefore be based on\
    \ a\n   well-defined mapping table for each protocol.\n   Delimiter mapping is\
    \ used to map characters that are similar to\n   protocol delimiters into the\
    \ canonical delimiter characters.  For\n   example, there are width-compatible\
    \ characters that correspond to the\n   '@' in email addresses and the ':' and\
    \ '/' in URIs.  The '+', '-',\n   '<' and '>' characters are other common delimiters\
    \ that might require\n   such mapping.  For the FULL STOP character (U+002E),\
    \ a delimiter in\n   the visual presentation of domain names, some IMEs produce\
    \ a\n   character such as IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002) when a user types\n \
    \  FULL STOP on the keyboard.  In all these cases, the visually similar\n   characters\
    \ that can come from user input need to be mapped to the\n   correct protocol\
    \ delimiter characters before the string is passed to\n   the protocol.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Special Mapping
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Special Mapping\n   Aside from delimiter characters, certain protocols\
    \ have characters\n   which need to be mapped in ways that are different from\
    \ the rules\n   specified in the PRECIS framework (e.g., mapping non-ASCII space\n\
    \   characters to ASCII space).  In this document, these mappings are\n   called\
    \ \"special mappings\".  They are different for each protocol.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the special mapping table should be based on a well-\n   defined mapping table\
    \ for each protocol.  Examples of special mapping\n   are the following;\n   o\
    \  White spaces such as CHARACTER TABULATION (U+0009) or IDEOGRAPHIC\n      SPACE\
    \ (U+3000) are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)\n   o  Some characters such as control\
    \ characters are mapped to nothing\n      (Deletion)\n   As examples, the Extensible\
    \ Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748],\n   IMAP4 Access Control List (ACL)\
    \ [RFC4314], and LDAPprep [RFC4518]\n   define the rule that some code points\
    \ for the non-ASCII space are\n   mapped to SPACE (U+0020).\n"
- title: 2.3.  Local Case Mapping
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Local Case Mapping\n   The purpose of local case mapping is to increase\
    \ the probability of\n   results that users expect when character case is changed\
    \ (e.g., map\n   uppercase to lowercase) between input and use in a protocol.\
    \  Local\n   case mapping selectively affects characters whose case mapping\n\
    \   depends on locale and/or context.\n   (Note: The term \"locale\" in this document\
    \ practically means\n   \"language\" or \"language and region\" because the locale\
    \ based on that\n   language configuration of applications on POSIX is selected\
    \ by\n   \"locale\" information.  See also the \"Note\" in Section 2.1.1 of RFC\n\
    \   5646 [RFC5646].)\n   As an example of locale- and context-dependent mapping,\
    \ LATIN CAPITAL\n   LETTER I (\"I\", U+0049) is normally mapped to LATIN SMALL\
    \ LETTER I\n   (\"i\", U+0069); however, if the language is Turkish (or one of\
    \ several\n   other languages), unless an I is before a dot_above, the character\n\
    \   should be mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).\n   Case mapping\
    \ using Unicode Default Case Folding in the PRECIS\n   framework does not consider\
    \ such locale or context because it is a\n   common framework for internationalization.\
    \  Local case mapping\n   defined in this document correspond to demands from\
    \ applications that\n   support users' locale and/or context.  The complete set\
    \ of possible\n   target characters for local case mapping are the characters\
    \ specified\n   in SpecialCasing.txt [Specialcasing] in Section 3.13 of the Unicode\n\
    \   Standard [Unicode], but the specific set of target characters\n   selected\
    \ for local case mapping depends on locale and/or context, as\n   further explained\
    \ in SpecialCasing.txt.\n   The case-folding method for a selected target character\
    \ is to map\n   into lowercase as defined in SpecialCasing.txt.  The case-folding\n\
    \   method for all other, non-target characters is as specified in\n   Section\
    \ 5.2.3 of the PRECIS framework.  When an application supports\n   users' locale\
    \ and/or context, use of local case mapping can increase\n   the probability that\
    \ string comparisons yield the results that users\n   expect.\n   If a PRECIS\
    \ profile selects Unicode Default Case Folding as the\n   preferred method of\
    \ case mapping, the profile designers may consider\n   whether local case mapping\
    \ can be applied.  And, if it can be\n   applied, it is better to add \"alternatively,\
    \ local case mapping might\n   be applicable\" after \"Unicode Default Case Folding\"\
    \ so that\n   application developers are aware of the alternative.  See Appendix\
    \ B\n   for a description of why local case mapping can be an alternative.\n"
- title: 3.  Order of Operations
  contents:
  - "3.  Order of Operations\n   Delimiter mapping and special mapping as described\
    \ in this document\n   are expected to be applied as the \"Additional Mapping\
    \ Rule\" mentioned\n   in Section 5.2.2 of the PRECIS framework.  Although the\
    \ delimiter\n   mapping and special mapping could be applied in either order,\
    \ this\n   document recommends the following order to minimize the effect of\n\
    \   code-point changes introduced by the mappings and to be acceptable to\n  \

  - "Appendix B.  Why Local Case Mapping Is an Alternative to Case Mapping in\n  \
    \           the PRECIS Framework\n   Local case mapping and Unicode Default Case\
    \ Folding are alternatives.\n   They can't be applied simultaneously or sequentially.\
    \  One\n   outstanding issue regarding full case folding for characters is that\n\
    \   some lowercase characters like \"LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S\" (U+00DF)\n \
    \  (hereinafter referred to as \"eszett\") and ligatures like \"LATIN SMALL\n\
    \   LIGATURE FF\" (U+FB00) that are described in the \"Unconditional\n   mappings\"\
    \ section of SpecialCasing.txt become a different code point\n   when the case\
    \ mapping is performed using Unicode Default Case Folding\n   in the PRECIS framework.\n\
    \   In particular, German's eszett cannot keep the locale because eszett\n   becomes\
    \ two \"LATIN SMALL LETTER S\"s (U+0073 U+0073) when the case\n   mapping is performed\
    \ using Unicode Default Case Folding.  (See also\n   00DF in CaseFolding.txt [Casefolding].)\
    \  On the other hand, eszett\n   doesn't become a different code point when performing\
    \ the case\n   mapping in SpecialCasing.txt.  Therefore, if it is necessary to\
    \ keep\n   the locale of characters, PRECIS profile designers should select\n\
    \   local case mapping as an alternative to Unicode Default Case Folding.\n"

  - "Appendix C.  Limitations of Local Case Mapping\n   As described in Section 2.3,\
    \ the possible target characters of local\n   case mapping are specified in SpecialCasing.txt.\
    \  The Unicode\n   Standard (at least, up to version 7.0.0) does not define any\
