  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols\n\
    \   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes\n   planned.\n\
    \   To first order, the official protocols are those specified in the\n   \"DDN\
    \ Protocol Handbook\" (DPH), dated December 1985 (this is a three\n   volume set\
    \ with a total thickness of about 5 inches).\n   Older collections that include\
    \ many of these  specifications are the\n   \"Internet Protocol Transition Workbook\"\
    \ (IPTW), dated March 1982; the\n   \"Internet Mail Protocols\", dated November\
    \ 1982; and the \"Internet\n   Telnet Protocols and Options\", dated June 1983.\
    \  There is also a\n   volume of protocol related information called the \"Internet\
    \ Protocol\n   Implementers Guide\" (IPIG) dated August 1982.  An even older\n\
    \   collection is the \"ARPANET Protocol Handbook\" (APH) dated\n   January 1978.\
    \  Nearly all the relevant material from these\n   collections has been reproduced\
    \ in the current DPH.\n   This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The\
    \ entries are\n   protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry\
    \ there\n   are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,\n\
    \   dependencies, and contact.\n      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended,\
    \ elective,\n      experimental, or none.\n      The SPECIFICATION identifies\
    \ the protocol defining documents.\n      The COMMENTS describe any differences\
    \ from the specification or\n      problems with the protocol.\n      The OTHER\
    \ REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or expand\n      on the protocol.\n"

    \  COMMENTS:\n         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram\n\
    \         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the\n       \
    \  Internet.\n         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.\n\
    \         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.\n     \
    \    The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of\n        \
    \ the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the\n         phrases\
    \ \"the pointer is relative to this option\" and \"the\n         smallest legal\
    \ value for the pointer is 4\".  If you are\n         confused, forget about the\
    \ relative part, the pointer begins\n         at 4.  The MIL-STD description of\
    \ source routing is wrong in\n         some of the details.\n         Another\
    \ important point is the alternate reassembly procedure\n         suggested in\
    \ RFC 815.\n         Some changes are in the works for the security option.\n\
    \         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You\n     \

    \ pointer points to the\n         last octet of urgent data (not to the first\
    \ octet of non-urgent\n         data).\n         Listening Servers:  Several comments\
    \ have been received on\n         difficulties with contacting listening servers.\
    \  There should\n         be some discussion of implementation issues for servers,\
    \ and\n         some notes on alternative models of system and process\n     \
    \    organization for servers.\n         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment\
    \ size option should\n         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to\
    \ either\n         increase or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.\n\
    \         The TCP Maximum Segment Size is the IP Maximum Datagram Size\n     \
    \    minus forty.  The default IP Maximum Datagram Size is 576.  The\n       \
    \  default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.  For further\n         discussion,\
    \ see RFC 879.\n         Idle Connections:  There have been questions about\n\
    \         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are\n    \
    \     ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where\n         idle\
    \ connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is\n         thinking\
    \ for a long time following a message from the server\n         computer before\
    \ his next input.  There is no TCP \"probe\"\n         mechanism, and none is\
    \ needed.\n         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points\
    \ where\n         it is not clear from the description what to do about data\n\
    \         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,\n         particularly\
    \ when the connection is being closed.  In general,\n         the data is to be\
    \ kept to give to the user if he does a RECV\n         call.\n         Out of\
    \ Order Segments:  The description says that segments that\n         arrive out\
    \ of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment\n         to be processed,\
    \ may be kept on hand.  It should also point out\n         that there is a very\
    \ large performance penalty for not doing\n         so.\n         User Time Out:\
    \  This is the time out started on an open or send\n         call.  If this user\
    \ time out occurs the user should be\n         notified, but the connection should\
    \ not be closed or the TCB\n         deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT\
    \ the connection if he\n         wants to give up.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n"

    \      COMMENTS:\n         A proposed protocol of two methods of encapsulating\
    \ Internet\n         Protocol (IP) datagrams on an IEEE 802.3 network.  Currently\n\
    \         being revised to be generalized for all 802 networks.\n         At an\
    \ ad hoc special session on \"IEEE 802 Networks and ARP\"\n         held during\
    \ the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach\n         to a consistent\
    \ way to sent DOD-IP datagrams and other IP\n         related protocols on 802\
    \ networks was developed.\n         Due to some evolution of the IEEE 802.2 standards\
    \ and the need\n         to provide for a standard way to do additional DOD-IP\
    \ related\n         protocols (such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on IEEE\n\
    \         802 networks, the following new policy is established, which\n     \
    \    will replace the current policy (see RFC-990 section on IEEE\n         802\
    \ Numbers of Interest, and RFC-948).\n         The policy is for DDN and ARPA-Internet\
    \ community to use IEEE\n         802.2 encapsulation on 802.3, 802.4, and 802.5\
    \ networks by\n         using the SNAP with an organization code indicating that\
