  - "1.  Introduction\n   The focus of the Energy Management (EMAN) framework is energy\n\
    \   monitoring and management of energy objects [RFC7326].  The scope of\n   devices\
    \ considered are network equipment and their components, and\n   devices connected\
    \ directly or indirectly to the network.  The EMAN\n   framework enables monitoring\
    \ of heterogeneous devices to report their\n   energy consumption and, if permissible,\
    \ control.  There are multiple\n   scenarios where this is desirable, particularly\
    \ considering the\n   increased importance of limiting consumption of finite energy\n\
    \   resources and reducing operational expenses.\n   The EMAN framework [RFC7326]\
    \ describes how energy information can be\n   retrieved from IP-enabled devices\
    \ using Simple Network Management\n   Protocol (SNMP), specifically, Management\
    \ Information Base (MIB)\n   modules for SNMP.\n   This document describes typical\
    \ applications of the EMAN framework as\n   well as its opportunities and limitations.\
    \  It also reviews other\n   standards that are similar in part to EMAN but address\
    \ different\n   domains, describing how those other standards relate to the EMAN\n\
    \   framework.\n   The rest of the document is organized as follows.  Section\
    \ 2 contains\n   a list of use cases or network scenarios that EMAN addresses.\n\
    \   Section 3 contains an abstraction of the use case scenarios to\n   distinct\
    \ patterns.  Section 4 deals with other standards related and\n   applicable to\
    \ EMAN.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Energy Management Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Energy Management Overview\n   EMAN addresses the electrical energy consumed\
    \ by devices connected to\n   a network.  A first step to increase the energy\
    \ efficiency in\n   networks and the devices attached to the network is to enable\
    \ energy\n   objects to report their energy usage over time.  The EMAN framework\n\
    \   addresses this problem with an information model for electrical\n   equipment:\
    \ energy object identification, energy object context, power\n   measurement,\
    \ and power characteristics.\n   The EMAN framework defines SNMP MIB modules based\
    \ on the information\n   model.  By implementing these SNMP MIB modules, an energy\
    \ object can\n   report its energy consumption according to the information model.\n\
    \   Based on the information model, the MIB documents specify SNMP MIB\n   modules,\
    \ but it is equally possible to use other mechanisms such as\n   YANG module,\
    \ Network Conference Protocol (NETCONF), etc.\n   In that context, it is important\
    \ to distinguish energy objects that\n   can only report their own energy usage\
    \ from devices that can also\n   collect and aggregate energy usage of other energy\
    \ objects.\n"
- title: 1.2.  EMAN Document Overview
  contents:
  - "1.2.  EMAN Document Overview\n   The EMAN work consists of the following Standard\
    \ Track and\n   Informational documents in the area of energy management.\n  \
    \    Applicability Statement (this document)\n      Requirements [RFC6988]: This\
    \ document presents requirements of\n         energy management and the scope\
    \ of the devices considered.\n      Framework [RFC7326]: This document defines\
    \ a framework for\n         providing energy management for devices within or\
    \ connected to\n         communication networks and lists the definitions for\
    \ the common\n         terms used in these documents.\n      Energy Object Context\
    \ MIB [RFC7461]: This document defines a MIB\n         module that characterizes\
    \ a device's identity, context, and\n         relationships to other entities.\n\
    \      Monitoring and Control MIB [RFC7460]: This document defines a MIB\n   \
    \      module for monitoring the power and energy consumption of a\n         device.\n\
    \         The MIB module contains an optional module for metrics\n         associated\
    \ with power characteristics.\n      Battery MIB [RFC7577]: This document defines\
    \ a MIB module for\n         monitoring characteristics of an internal battery.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Energy Measurement
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Energy Measurement\n   It is increasingly common for today's smart devices\
    \ to measure and\n   report their own energy consumption.  Intelligent power strips\
    \ and\n   some Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches can meter consumption of\n \
    \  connected devices.  However, when managed and reported through\n   proprietary\
    \ means, this information is difficult to view at the\n   enterprise level.\n\
    \   The primary goal of the EMAN information model is to enable reporting\n  \
    \ and management within a standard framework that is applicable to a\n   wide\
    \ variety of end devices, meters, and proxies.  This enables a\n   management\
    \ system to know who's consuming what, when, and how by\n   leveraging existing\
    \ networks across various equipment in a unified\n   and consistent manner.\n\
    \   Because energy objects may both consume energy and provide energy to\n   other\
    \ devices, there are three types of energy measurement: energy\n   input to a\
    \ device, energy supplied to other devices, and net\n   (resultant) energy consumed\
    \ (the difference between energy input and\n   supplied).\n"
- title: 1.4.  Energy Management
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Energy Management\n   The EMAN framework provides mechanisms for energy\
    \ control in addition\n   to passive monitoring.  There are many cases where active\
    \ energy\n   control of devices is desirable, for example, during low device\n\
    \   utilization or peak electrical price periods.\n   Energy control can be as\
    \ simple as controlling on/off states.  In\n   many cases, however, energy control\
    \ requires understanding the energy\n   object context.  For instance, during\
    \ non-business hours in a\n   commercial building, some phones must remain available\
    \ in case of\n   emergency, and office cooling is not usually turned off completely,\n\
    \   but the comfort level is reduced.\n   Energy object control therefore requires\
    \ flexibility and support for\n   different policies and mechanisms: from centralized\
    \ management by an\n   energy management system to autonomous control by individual\
    \ devices\n   and alignment with dynamic demand-response mechanisms.\n   The power\
    \ states specified in the EMAN framework can be used in\n   demand-response scenarios.\
    \  In response to time-of-day fluctuation of\n   energy costs or grid power shortages,\
    \ network devices can respond and\n   reduce their energy consumption.\n"
- title: 1.5.  EMAN Framework Application
  contents:
  - "1.5.  EMAN Framework Application\n   A Network Management System (NMS) is an\
    \ entity that requests\n   information from compatible devices, typically using\
    \ the SNMP\n   protocol. An NMS may implement many network management functions,\n\
    \   such as security or identity management.  An NMS that deals\n   exclusively\
    \ with energy is called an Energy Management System (EnMS).\n   It may be limited\
    \ to monitoring energy use, or it may also implement\n   control functions.  An\
    \ EnMS collects energy information for devices\n   in the network.\n   Energy\
    \ management can be implemented by extending existing SNMP\n   support with EMAN-specific\
    \ MIBs.  SNMP provides an industry-proven\n   and well-known mechanism to discover,\
    \ secure, measure, and control\n   SNMP-enabled end devices.  The EMAN framework\
    \ provides an information\n   and data model to unify access to a large range\
    \ of devices.\n"

    \ scenarios that the EMAN\n   framework should solve.  Each scenario lists target\
    \ devices for which\n   the energy management framework can be applied, how the\
    \ reported-on\n   devices are powered, and how the reporting or control is\n \
    \  accomplished.  While there is some overlap between some of the use\n   cases,\
    \ the use cases illustrate network scenarios that the EMAN\n   framework supports.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Network Infrastructure Energy Objects
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Network Infrastructure Energy Objects\n   This scenario covers the key\
    \ use case of network devices and their\n   components.  For a device aware of\
    \ one or more components, our\n   information model supports monitoring and control\
    \ at the component\n   level.  Typically, the chassis draws power from one or\
    \ more sources\n   and feeds its internal components.  It is highly desirable\
    \ to have\n   monitoring available for individual components, such as line cards,\n\
    \   processors, disk drives, and peripherals such as USB devices.\n   As an illustrative\
    \ example, consider a switch with the following\n   grouping of subentities for\
    \ which energy management could be useful.\n      o  Physical view: chassis (or\
    \ stack), line cards, and service\n         modules of the switch.\n      o  Component\
    \ view: CPU, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits\n         (ASICs), fans,\
    \ power supply, ports (single port and port\n         groups), storage, and memory.\n\
    \   The ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933] provides a containment model for uniquely\n   identifying\
    \ the physical subcomponents of network devices.  The\n   containment information\
    \ identifies whether one Energy Object belongs\n   to another Energy Object (e.g.,\
    \ a line-card Energy Object contained\n   in a chassis Energy Object).  The mapping\
    \ table,\n   entPhysicalContainsTable, has an index, entPhysicalChildIndex, and\n\
    \   the table, entPhysicalTable, has a MIB object,\n   entPhysicalContainedIn,\
    \ that points to the containing entity.\n   The essential properties of this use\
    \ case are:\n      o  Target devices: network devices such as routers and switches,\n\
    \         as well as their components.\n      o  How powered: typically by a Power\
    \ Distribution Unit (PDU) on a\n         rack or from a wall outlet.  The components\
    \ of a device are\n         powered by the device chassis.\n      o  Reporting:\
    \ Direct power measurement can be performed at a\n         device level.  Components\
    \ can report their power consumption\n         directly, or the chassis/device\
    \ can report on behalf of some\n         components.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Devices Powered and Connected by a Network Device
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Devices Powered and Connected by a Network Device\n   This scenario covers\
    \ Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) devices.  A PSE\n   device (e.g., a PoE switch)\
    \ provides power to a Powered Device (PD)\n   (e.g., a desktop phone) over a medium\
    \ such as USB or Ethernet\n   [RFC3621].  For each port, the PSE can control the\
    \ power supply\n   (switching it on and off) and usually meter actual power provided.\n\
    \   PDs obtain network connectivity as well as power over a single\n   connection\
    \ so the PSE can determine which device is associated with\n   each port.\n  \
    \ PoE ports on a switch are commonly connected to devices such as IP\n   phones,\
    \ wireless access points, and IP cameras.  The switch needs\n   power for its\
    \ internal use and to supply power to PoE ports.\n   Monitoring the power consumption\
    \ of the switch (supplying device) and\n   the power consumption of the PoE endpoints\
    \ (consuming devices) is a\n   simple use case of this scenario.\n   This scenario\
    \ illustrates the relationships between entities.  The\n   PoE IP phone is powered\
    \ by the switch.  If there are many IP phones\n   connected to the same switch,\
    \ the power consumption of all the IP\n   phones can be aggregated by the switch.\n\
    \   The essential properties of this use case are:\n      Target devices: Power\
    \ over Ethernet devices such as IP phones,\n         wireless access points, and\
    \ IP cameras.\n      How powered: PoE devices are connected to the switch port\
    \ that\n         supplies power to those devices.\n      Reporting: PoE device\
    \ power consumption is measured and reported\n         by the switch (PSE) that\
    \ supplies power.  In addition, some\n         edge devices can support the EMAN\
    \ framework.\n   This use case can be divided into two subcases:\n      a) The\
    \ endpoint device supports the EMAN framework, in which case\n         this device\
    \ is an EMAN Energy Object by itself with its own\n         Universally Unique\
    \ Identifier (UUID).  The device is\n         responsible for its own power reporting\
    \ and control.  See the\n         related scenario \"Devices Connected to a Network\"\
    \ below.\n      b) The endpoint device does not have EMAN capabilities, and the\n\
    \         power measurement may not be able to be performed independently\n  \
    \       and is therefore only performed by the supplying device.  This\n     \
    \    scenario is similar to the \"Mid-level Manager\" below.\n   In subcase (a),\
    \ note that two power usage reporting mechanisms for\n   the same device are available:\
    \ one performed by the PD itself and one\n   performed by the PSE.  Device-specific\
    \ implementations will dictate\n   which one to use.\n"

    \  In this case, the PC can report\n   power usage by itself, ideally through\

    \       usually a single device per outlet.  Meters may report for one\n     \
    \    or more devices and may require knowledge of the topology to\n         associate\
    \ meters with metered devices.\n   Meters have metered-by relationships with devices\

  - "2.8.  Data Center Devices\n   This use case describes energy management of a\
    \ data center.  Energy\n   efficiency of data centers has become a fundamental\
    \ challenge of data\n   center operation, as data centers are big energy consumers\
    \ and have\n   an expensive infrastructure.  The equipment generates heat, and\
    \ heat\n   needs to be evacuated through an HVAC system.\n   A typical data center\
    \ network consists of a hierarchy of electrical\n   energy objects.  At the bottom\
    \ of the network hierarchy are servers\n   mounted on a rack; these are connected\
    \ to top-of-the-rack switches,\n   which in turn are connected to aggregation\
    \ switches and then to core\n   switches.  Power consumption of all network elements,\
    \ servers, and\n   storage devices in the data center should be measured.  Energy\n\
    \   management can be implemented on different aggregation levels, i.e.,\n   at\
    \ the network level, the Power Distribution Unit (PDU) level, and/or\n   the server\
    \ level.\n   Beyond the network devices, storage devices, and servers, data\n\
    \   centers contain Uninterruptable Power Systems (UPSs) to provide back-\n  \
    \ up power for the facility in the event of a power outage.  A UPS can\n   provide\
    \ backup power for many devices in a data center for a finite\n   period of time.\
    \  Energy monitoring of energy storage capacity is\n   vital from a data center\
    \ network operations point of view.\n   Presently, the UPS MIB can be useful in\
    \ monitoring the battery\n   capacity, the input load to the UPS, and the output\
    \ load from the\n   UPS.  Currently, there is no link between the UPS MIB and\
    \ the ENTITY\n   MIB.\n   In addition to monitoring the power consumption of a\
    \ data center,\n   additional power characteristics should be monitored.  Some\
    \ of these\n   are dynamic variations in the input power supply from the grid,\n\

    \ energy\n   storage as a component (e.g., a notebook).  This use case covers\n\
    \   both.\n   The energy storage can be a conventional battery or any other means\n\
    \   to store electricity, such as a hydrogen cell.\n   An internal battery can\
    \ be a back-up or an alternative source of\n   power to mains power.  As batteries\

    \ often use a\n   variety of low-power modes, particularly for managing energy-\n\

    \ widely, with high peak usage levels.\n   Printers can expose detailed power\
    \ state information, distinct from\n   operational state information, with some\

    \ is\n   developing an energy management standard, ISO 50001, to complement\n\
    \   ISO 9001 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental\n   management.\
    \  The intent is to facilitate the creation of energy\n   management programs\
    \ for industrial, commercial, and other entities.\n   The standard defines a process\
    \ for energy management at an\n   organizational level.  It does not define the\
    \ way in which devices\n   report energy and consume energy.\n   ISO 50001 is\
    \ based on the common elements found in all of ISO's\n   management system standards,\
    \ assuring a high level of compatibility\n   with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.  ISO\
    \ 50001 benefits include:\n      o  Integrating energy efficiency into management\
    \ practices and\n         throughout the supply chain.\n      o  Using energy\

- title: 4.3.3.  Smart Grid
  contents:
  - "4.3.3.  Smart Grid\n   The Smart Grid standards efforts underway in the United\
    \ States are\n   overseen by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\
    \   [NIST].  NIST is responsible for coordinating a public-private\n   partnership\
    \ with key energy and consumer stakeholders in order to\n   facilitate the development\
    \ of Smart Grid standards.  These activities\n   are monitored and facilitated\
    \ by the Smart Grid Interoperability\n   Panel (SGIP).  This group has working\
    \ groups for specific topics\n   including homes, commercial buildings, and industrial\
    \ facilities as\n   they relate to the grid.  A stated goal of the group is to\
    \ harmonize\n   any new standard with the IEC CIM and IEC 61850.\n   When a working\
    \ group detects a standard or technology gap, the team\n   seeks approval from\
    \ the SGIP for the creation of a Priority Action\n   Plan (PAP), a private-public\
    \ partnership to close the gap.  PAP 17 is\n   discussed in Section 4.1.6.\n \
    \  PAP 10 addresses \"Standard Energy Usage Information\".  Smart Grid\n   standards\
    \ will provide distributed intelligence in the network and\n   allow enhanced\
    \ load shedding.  For example, pricing signals will\n   enable selective shutdown\
    \ of non-critical activities during peak\n   price periods.  Actions can be effected\
    \ through both centralized and\n   distributed management controls.\n   There\
    \ is an obvious functional link between Smart Grid and EMAN in\n   the form of\
    \ demand response even though the EMAN framework itself\n   does not address any\
    \ coordination with the grid.  As EMAN enables\n   control, it can be used by\
    \ an EnMS to accomplish demand response\n   through translation of a signal from\
    \ an outside entity.\n"

    \ a data\n   and information model useful for measuring and reporting energy and\n\
