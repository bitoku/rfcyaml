  - "Abstract\n   The Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) specifications require\n\
    \   the use of multicast tunnels (\"P-tunnels\") that traverse a service\n   provider's\
    \ backbone network.  The P-tunnels are used for carrying\n   multicast traffic\
    \ across the backbone.  A variety of P-tunnel types\n   are supported.  Bit Index\
    \ Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new\n   architecture that provides optimal\
    \ multicast forwarding through a\n   \"multicast domain\", without requiring intermediate\
    \ routers to\n   maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building\n\
    \   protocol.  This document specifies the protocol and procedures that\n   allow\
    \ MVPN to use BIER as the method of carrying multicast traffic\n   over a service\
    \ provider's backbone network.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify the protocols and procedures\
    \ that a\n   Service Provider (SP) can use to provide Multicast Virtual Private\n\
    \   Network (MVPN) service to its customers.  Multicast tunnels are\n   created\
    \ through an SP's backbone network; these are known as\n   \"P-tunnels\".  The\
    \ P-tunnels are used for carrying multicast traffic\n   across the backbone. \
    \ The MVPN specifications allow the use of\n   several different kinds of P-tunnel\
    \ technology.\n   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) ([RFC8279]) is an architecture\n\
    \   that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"multicast\n   domain\"\
    , without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-\n   flow state or\
    \ to engage in an explicit tree-building protocol.  The\n   purpose of the current\
    \ document is to specify the protocols and\n   procedures needed in order to provide\
    \ MVPN service using BIER to\n   transport the multicast traffic over the backbone.\n\
    \   Although BIER does not explicitly build and maintain multicast\n   tunnels,\
    \ one can think of BIER as using a number of implicitly\n   created tunnels through\
    \ a \"BIER domain\".  In particular, one can\n   think of there as being one Point-to-Multipoint\
    \ (P2MP) tunnel from\n   each Bit Forwarding Ingress Router (BFIR) to all the\
    \ Bit Forwarding\n   Egress Routers (BFERs) in the BIER domain, where a BIER domain\
    \ is\n   generally co-extensive with an IGP network.  These \"tunnels\" are not\n\
    \   specific to any particular VPN.  However, the MVPN architecture\n   provides\
    \ protocols and procedures that allow the traffic of multiple\n   MVPNs to be\
    \ aggregated on a single P-tunnel.  In this document, we\n   specify how to use\
    \ these multi-VPN aggregation procedures to enable\n   BIER to transport traffic\
    \ from multiple MVPNs.\n   MVPN traffic must sometimes traverse more than one\
    \ IGP domain,\n   whereas BIER only carries multicast traffic within a single\
    \ IGP\n   domain.  However, the MVPN specifications allow P-tunnels to be\n  \
    \ segmented (the concept of MVPN segmentation is defined in [RFC6513]\n   and\
    \ [RFC6514]), where the segmentation points may either be\n   Autonomous System\
    \ Border Routers (ASBRs) as described in [RFC6514],\n   or Area Border Routers\
    \ (ABRs) as described in [RFC7524].  As long as\n   the segmentation points are\
    \ capable of acting as BFIRs and BFERs,\n   BIER can be used to provide some or\
    \ all of the segments of a\n   P-tunnel.\n   Procedures to support MVPN customers\
    \ who are using Bidirectional PIM\n   (BIDIR-PIM) are outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   This document uses the following terminology from [RFC8279]:\n\
    \   o  BFR: Bit-Forwarding Router.\n   o  BFIR: Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router.\n\
    \   o  BFER: Bit-Forwarding Egress Router.\n   This document uses the following\
    \ terminology from [RFC6513]:\n   o  MVPN: Multicast Virtual Private Network --\
    \ a VPN [RFC4364] in\n      which multicast service is offered.\n   o  P-tunnel:\
    \ A multicast tunnel through the network of one or more\n      SPs.  P-tunnels\
    \ are used to transport MVPN multicast data\n   o  PMSI: Provider Multicast Service\
    \ Interface.  PMSI is an\n      abstraction that represents a multicast service\
    \ for carrying\n      packets.  A PMSI is instantiated via one or more P-tunnels.\n\
    \   o  C-S: A multicast source address, identifying a multicast source\n     \
    \ located at a VPN customer site.\n   o  C-G: A multicast group address used by\
    \ a VPN customer.\n   o  C-flow: A customer multicast flow.  Each C-flow is identified\
    \ by\n      the ordered pair (source address, group address), where each\n   \
    \   address is in the customer's address space.  The identifier of a\n      particular\
    \ C-flow is usually written as (C-S,C-G).\n      Sets of C-flows can be identified\
    \ by the use of the \"C-*\" wildcard\n      (see [RFC6625]), e.g., (C-*,C-G).\n\
    \   o  I-PMSI A-D Route: Inclusive PMSI Auto-Discovery route.  Carried in\n  \
    \    BGP Update messages, these routes are used to advertise the\n      default\
    \ P-tunnel for a particular MVPN.\n   o  S-PMSI A-D route: Selective PMSI Auto-Discovery\
    \ route.  Carried in\n      BGP Update messages, these routes are used to advertise\
    \ the fact\n      that particular C-flows are bound to (i.e., are traveling through)\n\
    \      particular P-tunnels.\n   o  x-PMSI A-D route: A route that is either an\
    \ I-PMSI A-D route or an\n      S-PMSI A-D route.\n   o  Leaf A-D route: A route\
    \ that a multicast egress node sends in\n      order to join a particular P-tunnel.\n\
    \   o  PMSI Tunnel attribute (PTA): In an x-PMSI A-D route, the Network\n    \
    \  Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of the route identifies a\n      PMSI.\
    \  The BGP attribute known as the PMSI Tunnel attribute is\n      attached to\
    \ such a route in order to identify a particular\n      P-tunnel that is associated\
    \ with the PMSI.  When C-flows of\n      multiple VPNs are carried in a single\
    \ P-tunnel, this attribute\n      also carries the information needed to multiplex\
    \ and demultiplex\n      the C-flows.  A PTA can also be carried by a Leaf A-D\
    \ root.  In\n      this case, it contains information that is needed in order\
    \ for the\n      originator of the route to join the specified P-tunnel.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\

- title: 2.  Use of the PMSI Tunnel Attribute in x-PMSI A-D Routes
  contents:
  - "2.  Use of the PMSI Tunnel Attribute in x-PMSI A-D Routes\n   As defined in [RFC6514],\
    \ the PMSI Tunnel attribute (PTA) carried by\n   an x-PMSI A-D route identifies\
    \ the P-tunnel that is used to\n   instantiate a particular PMSI.  If a PMSI is\
    \ to be instantiated by\n   BIER, the PTA is constructed by a BFIR.\n   If segmented\
    \ P-tunnels are not being used, the PTA attached to a\n   given x-PMSI A-D route\
    \ is constructed by the router that originated\n   the route (typically by the\
    \ ingress Provider Edge (PE) router), and\n   the PTA is not changed as the route\
    \ is propagated.\n   If segmented P-tunnels are being used, the PTA attached to\
    \ a given\n   x-PMSI A-D route by the route's originator may be replaced at a\n\
    \   segmentation point (a BFER) by a PTA identifying the next segment of\n   the\
    \ P-tunnel.  If the next segment of the P-tunnel is instantiated by\n   BIER,\
    \ the segmentation point serves as the BFIR for that next\n   segment.\n   In\
    \ either case, a PTA is constructed by a BFIR as follows (see\n   Figure 1):\n\
    \   The PTA contains the following fields:\n   o  Tunnel Type: IANA has assigned\
    \ 0x0B as the tunnel type codepoint\n      for \"BIER\" in the \"P-Multicast Service\
    \ Interface Tunnel (PMSI\n      Tunnel) Tunnel Types\" registry.  This codepoint\
    \ is used to\n      indicate that the PMSI is instantiated by BIER.\n      Although\
    \ BIER does not actually create tunnels, the MVPN\n      procedures treat BIER\
    \ as if it were a type of tunnel.\n   o  Tunnel Identifier: When the tunnel type\
    \ is BIER, this field\n      contains three subfields:\n      1.  The first subfield\
    \ is a single octet, containing a BIER\n          sub-domain-id (see [RFC8279]).\
    \  This indicates that packets\n          sent on the PMSI will be sent on the\
    \ specified BIER\n          sub-domain.  How that sub-domain is chosen is outside\
    \ the\n          scope of this document.\n      2.  The second subfield is a two-octet\
    \ field containing the BFR-id\n          in the sub-domain identified in the first\
    \ subfield of the\n          router that is constructing the PTA.\n      3.  The\
    \ third subfield is the BFR-prefix (see [RFC8279]) of the\n          router (a\
    \ BFIR) that is constructing the PTA.  The BFR-prefix\n          will either be\
    \ a /32 IPv4 address or a /128 IPv6 address.\n          Whether the address is\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6 can be inferred from the\n          total length of the PTA.\n\
    \          The BFR-prefix need not be the same IP address that is carried\n  \
    \        in any other field of the x-PMSI A-D route, even if the BFIR\n      \
    \    is the originating router of the x-PMSI A-D route.\n      Failure to properly\
    \ set the Tunnel Identifier field cannot be\n      detected by the protocol and\
    \ will result in improper delivery of\n      the data packets sent on the PMSI.\n\
    \   o  MPLS Label: This field MUST contain an upstream-assigned non-zero\n   \
    \   MPLS label.  It is assigned by the router (a BFIR) that constructs\n     \
    \ the PTA.  Constraints on the way in which a BFIR selects this\n      label are\
    \ discussed in Section 2.1.\n      Failure to follow the constraints on label\
    \ assignment cannot be\n      detected by the protocol and may result in improper\
    \ handling of\n      data packets by the egress PE routers.\n   o  Flags: When\
    \ the tunnel type is BIER, two of the flags in the PTA\n      Flags field are\
    \ meaningful.  Details about the use of these flags\n      can be found in Section\
    \ 2.2.\n      *  Leaf Information Required per Flow (LIR-pF): This flag is\n \
    \        introduced in [RFC8534].  A BFIR SHOULD NOT set this flag\n         UNLESS\
    \ it knows that all the BFERs in the BIER domain (or at\n         least all the\
    \ BFERs to which it needs to transmit) support this\n         flag.  (How this\
    \ is known is outside the scope of this\n         document.)  Procedures for the\
    \ use of this flag are given in\n         Section 2.2.2.  Support for this flag\
    \ is OPTIONAL.\n      *  Leaf Information Required (LIR): see Section 2.2.1.\n\

    \ that receive the route must be in\n   the same BIER domain as the originator\
    \ of the route.  If the\n   originator is in more than one BIER domain, the route\
    \ must be\n   distributed only within the BIER domain in which the BFR-prefix\
    \ in\n   the PTA uniquely identifies the originator.  As with all MVPN routes,\n\
    \   distribution of these routes is controlled by the provisioning of\n   Route\
    \ Targets (RTs).  Thus, the requirement expressed in this\n   paragraph is really\

- title: 2.1.  MPLS Label
  contents:
  - "2.1.  MPLS Label\n   The MPLS Label carried in the PTA is an upstream-assigned\
    \ label.\n   If two PTAs contain the same BFR-prefix in their respective Tunnel\n\
    \   Identifier fields, then the labels carried in those PTAs MUST come\n   from\
    \ the same label space (see Section 7 of [RFC5331]).  An\n   implementation may\
    \ choose to use this fact when setting up the tables\n   it uses to interpret\
    \ the upstream-assigned labels.\n   Suppose that a BFIR attaches a PTA to each\
    \ of two x-PMSI A-D routes,\n   and both PTAs specify a tunnel type of BIER.\n\
    \   o  If the two routes do not carry the same set of RTs, then their\n      respective\
    \ PTAs MUST contain different MPLS label values.\n   o  If the two routes do not\
    \ have the same Address Family Identifier\n      (AFI) value, then their respective\
    \ PTAs MUST contain different\n      MPLS label values.  This ensures that when\
    \ an egress PE receives a\n      data packet with the given label, the egress\
    \ PE can infer from the\n      label whether the payload is an IPv4 packet or\
    \ an IPv6 packet.\n   o  If the BFIR is an ingress PE supporting MVPN extranet\
    \ ([RFC7900])\n      functionality, and if the two routes originate from different\
    \ VPN\n      Routing and Forwarding tables (VRFs) on this ingress PE, then the\n\
    \      respective PTAs of the two routes MUST contain different MPLS\n      label\
    \ values.\n   o  If the BFIR is an ingress PE supporting the \"Extranet Separation\"\
    \n      feature of MVPN extranet (see Section 7.3 of [RFC7900]), and if\n    \
    \  one of the routes carries the \"Extranet Separation\" extended\n      community\
    \ but the other does not, then the respective PTAs of the\n      two routes MUST\
    \ contain different MPLS label values.\n   o  If segmented P-tunnels are being\
    \ used, then the respective PTAs of\n      the two routes MUST contain different\
    \ MPLS label values whenever\n      the respective NLRIs of the two routes are\
    \ not identical.  The\n      MPLS label can then be used at the next segmentation\
    \ point to\n      switch packets from one P-tunnel segment directly to the next,\n\
    \      without requiring the segmentation points to contain any other\n      multicast\
    \ forwarding state.  This is explained further below; see\n      also Section\
    \ 4.\n   When segmented P-tunnels are being used, a segmentation point, call\n\
    \   it \"B1\", may receive an x-PMSI A-D route whose PTA specifies BIER\n   from\
    \ within a given BIER domain.  This means that BIER is being used\n   for the\
    \ previous segment of a segmented P-tunnel.  If the next\n   segment is also of\
    \ type BIER, B1 will be the BFIR for the next\n   segment.  That is, B1 is a BFER\
    \ of one BIER domain (corresponding to\n   the previous segment) and a BFIR of\
    \ another BIER domain\n   (corresponding to the next segment).  B1 needs to replace\
    \ the PTA of\n   the x-PMSI A-D route with a new PTA, specifying its own BFR-prefix\n\
    \   and specifying an upstream-assigned label assigned by B1 itself.\n   Suppose\
    \ that B1 has received two x-PMSI A-D routes, R1 and R2, where:\n   o  R1 and\
    \ R2 each have a PTA specifying BIER.\n   o  R1's PTA specifies BFR-prefix B2\
    \ and Label L2.\n   o  R2's PTA specifies BFR-prefix B3 and Label L3.\n   Suppose\
    \ B1 decides to propagate both R1 and R2, replacing each PTA\n   with a new PTA\
    \ specifying BIER.  Suppose these new PTAs specify\n   labels L4 and L5,respectively.\
    \  Then L4 and L5 MUST be different\n   (upstream-assigned) label values, UNLESS\
    \ both of the following\n   conditions hold:\n   o  R1 and R2 have the same value\
    \ in the Originating Router field of\n      their respective NLRIs, and\n   o\
    \  B2 is equal to B3, and\n   o  L2 is equal to L3.\n   The segmentation point\
    \ (B1, in this example) MUST also program its\n   data plane appropriately.  For\
    \ example, when:\n   o  B1 receives a BIER packet for which it is a BFER, and\n\
    \   o  the BIER header specifies the BFIR-id that corresponds to B2, and\n   o\
    \  the BIER payload is an MPLS packet with upstream-assigned label,\n      and\n\
    \   o  the top label value is L2,\n   then the data plane must be programmed to\
    \ replace L2 with L4 and to\n   re-encapsulate the packet in a BIER header with\
    \ B1's BFR-id in the\n   BFIR-id field.  The BitString of the new BIER header\
    \ is determined by\n   applying the procedures for MVPN explicit tracking (see\
    \ Section 2.2)\n   in the BIER domain of the next segment, i.e., in the BIER domain\
    \ for\n   which B1 is the BFIR).\n"

    \ PE must have received one of the following\n   x-PMSI A-D routes from the ingress\
    \ PE:\n   o  A (C-S,C-G) S-PMSI A-D route (i.e., an S-PMSI A-D route whose NLRI\n\
    \      encodes (C-S,C-G)) and whose PTA specifies a tunnel type of BIER.\n   \
    \   If such a route is found, we refer to it as the \"matching x-PMSI\n      A-D\

    \      (C-*,C-G), or (C-S,C-G)) whose PTA specifies a tunnel type of\n      BIER,\
    \ and that is the egress PE's \"match for reception\" of\n      (C-S,C-G).\n \
    \     The rules for determining which x-PMSI A-D route is the match for\n    \
    \  reception are given in [RFC6625].  However, these rules are\n      modified\
    \ here to exclude any x-PMSI A-D route that does not have a\n      PTA or whose\
    \ PTA specifies \"no tunnel type\".\n      If such a route is found, we refer\
    \ to it as the \"matching x-PMSI\n      A-D route.\"\n   If no matching x-PMSI\
    \ A-D route for (C-S,C-G) is found, the egress PE\n   cannot receive the (C-S,C-G)\
    \ flow from the ingress PE via BIER until\n   such time as a matching route is\
    \ received.\n   When an egress PE determines that it needs to receive a (C-S,C-G)\n\
    \   flow from a particular ingress PE via BIER, it originates a Leaf A-D\n   route.\
    \  Construction of the Leaf A-D route generally follows the\n   procedures specified\
    \ in [RFC6514] or, optionally, the procedures\n   specified in [RFC8534].  However,\
    \ when BIER is being used, the Leaf\n   A-D route MUST carry a PTA that is constructed\
    \ as follows:\n   1.  The tunnel type MUST be set to BIER.\n   2.  The MPLS Label\
    \ field SHOULD be set to zero.\n   3.  The sub-domain-id subfield of the Tunnel\
    \ Identifier field (as\n       defined in Section 2) MUST be set to the corresponding\
    \ value from\n       the PTA of the matching x-PMSI A-D route.\n   4.  The BFR-id\
    \ subfield of the Tunnel Identifier field MUST be set to\n       the BFR-id in\
    \ the sub-domain identified by the sub-domain-id\n       subfield of the egress\
    \ PE (BFER).\n   5.  The BFR-prefix field of the Tunnel Identifier field (as defined\n\
    \       in Section 2) MUST be set to the egress PE's (BFER's) BFR-prefix.\n  \
    \     The BFR-prefix need not be the same IP address that is carried in\n    \
    \   any other field of the Leaf A-D route.\n   When an ingress PE receives such\
    \ a Leaf A-D route, it learns the\n   BFR-prefix of the egress PE from the PTA.\
    \  The ingress PE does not\n   make any use the value of the PTA's MPLS label\
    \ field.\n   Failure to properly construct the PTA cannot always be detected by\n\
    \   the protocol and will cause improper delivery of the data packets.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Encapsulation and Transmission\n   To transmit an MVPN data packet, an\
    \ ingress PE follows the rules of\n   [RFC6625] to find the x-PMSI A-D route that\
    \ is a \"match for\n   transmission\" for that packet.  (In applying the rules\
    \ of [RFC6625],\n   any S-PMSI A-D route with a PTA specifying \"no tunnel information\"\
    \ is\n   ignored.)  If the matching route has a PTA specifying BIER, the\n   (upstream-assigned)\
    \ MPLS label from that PTA is pushed on the\n   packet's label stack.  Then the\
    \ packet is encapsulated in a BIER\n   header.  That is, the ingress PE functions\
    \ as a BFIR.  The BIER\n   sub-domain used for transmitting the packet is specified\
    \ in the PTA\n   of the above-mentioned x-PMSI A-D route.\n   In order to create\
    \ the proper BIER header for a given packet, the\n   BFIR must know all the BFERs\
    \ that need to receive that packet.  It\n   determines this by finding all the\
    \ Leaf A-D routes that correspond to\n   the S-PMSI A-D route that is the packet's\
    \ match for transmission.\n   There are two different cases to consider:\n   1.\
    \  The S-PMSI A-D route that is the match for transmission carries a\n       PTA\
    \ that has the LIR flag set but does not have the LIR-pF flag\n       set.\n \
    \      In this case, the corresponding Leaf A-D routes are those whose\n     \
    \  \"route key\" field is identical to the NLRI of the S-PMSI A-D\n       route.\n\
    \   2.  The S-PMSI A-D route that is the match for transmission carries a\n  \
    \     PTA that has the LIR-pF flag.\n       In this case, the corresponding Leaf\
    \ A-D routes are those whose\n       \"route key\" field is derived from the NLRI\
    \ of the S-PMSI A-D\n       route according to the procedures described in Section\
    \ 5.2 of\n       [RFC8534].\n   The Leaf A-D route from a given BFER will contain\
    \ a PTA that\n   specifies the BFER's BFR-prefix.  With this information, the\
    \ BFIR can\n   construct the BIER BitString.\n   However, if the PTA of the Leaf\
    \ A-D route from a given BFER specifies\n   a sub-domain other than the one being\
    \ used for transmitting the\n   packet, the bit for that BFER cannot be determined\
    \ and that BFER will\n   not receive the packet.\n   The BIER-encapsulated packet\
    \ is then forwarded, according to the\n   procedures described in [RFC8279] and\
    \ [RFC8296].  (See especially\n   Section 3, \"Imposing and Processing the BIER\
    \ Encapsulation\" in\n   [RFC8296].)\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Disposition\n   When a BFER receives an MVPN multicast data packet that\

    \ to\n   the multicast flow overlay:\n   o  The sub-domain-id and the BFIR-id\
    \ from the BIER header.  (As the\n      sub-domain-id is inferred from the BIFT-id\
    \ field of the BIER\n      header, an implementation might choose to pass the\
    \ BIFT-id rather\n      than the sub-domain-id; this is an implementation matter.)\n\
    \   o  The \"payload\", which is an MPLS packet whose top label is an\n      upstream-assigned\
    \ label.  In the data plane, the BFIR-id and the\n      sub-domain-id provide\
    \ the context in which the upstream-assigned\n      label is interpreted.\n  \
    \ By looking up the upstream-assigned label in the appropriate context,\n   the\
    \ multicast flow overlay determines whether the BFER is an egress\n   PE for the\
    \ packet.\n   Note that if segmented P-tunnels are in use, a BFER might be a\n\
    \   P-tunnel segmentation border router rather than an egress PE, or a\n   BFER\
    \ might be both an egress PE and a P-tunnel segmentation border\n   router.  Depending\
