  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 7001 by creating a registry for property\n\
    \   types in the Authentication-Results header field, used in email\n   authentication\
    \ work, rather than limiting participants to using the\n   original, small set\
    \ of fixed values.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC7001] defines the email Authentication-Results header\
    \ field that\n   presents the results of an authentication effort in a machine-\n\
    \   readable format.  The header field creates a place to collect the\n   output\
    \ from authentication processes that are disjoint from later\n   processes that\
    \ might use the output, such as analysis, filtering, or\n   sorting mechanisms.\n\
    \   The specification in that document enumerated a small set of types of\n  \
    \ properties that can be reported using this mechanism.  There has\n   emerged\
    \ a desire to report types of properties about a message\n   through this mechanism.\
    \  Accordingly, this document updates the\n   specification to allow for additional\
    \ property types (\"ptypes\")\n   beyond the original set and creates a registry\
    \ where new ones can be\n   listed and their defining documents referenced.\n"
- title: 2.  Updated "ptype" Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Updated \"ptype\" Definition\n   Advanced Backus Naur Form (ABNF) is defined\
    \ in [RFC5234].\n   The ABNF in Section 2.2 of [RFC7001] is updated as follows:\n\
    \       ptype = Keyword\n             ; indicates whether the property being evaluated\
    \ was\n             ; a parameter to an [SMTP] command, was a value taken\n  \
    \           ; from a message header field, was some property of\n            \
    \ ; the message body, or was some other property evaluated by\n             ;\
    \ the receiving Message Transfer Agent (MTA)\n   The ABNF token \"Keyword\" is\
    \ defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5321].\n   Legal values of \"ptype\" are as\
    \ defined in the IANA \"Email\n   Authentication Property Types\" registry (see\
    \ Section 3).  The initial\n   values are as follows, matching those defined in\
    \ [RFC7001]:\n   body:  Indicates information that was extracted from the body\
    \ of the\n      message.  This might be an arbitrary string of bytes, a hash of\
    \ a\n      string of bytes, a Uniform Resource Identifier, or some other\n   \
    \   content of interest.\n   header:  Indicates information that was extracted\
    \ from the header of\n      the message.  This might be the value of a header\
    \ field or some\n      portion of a header field.\n   policy:  A local policy\
    \ mechanism was applied that augments or\n      overrides the result returned\
    \ by the authentication mechanism.\n      See Section 2.3 of [RFC7001].\n   smtp:\
    \  Indicates information that was extracted from an SMTP command\n      that was\
    \ used to relay the message.\n   When a consumer of this header field encounters\
    \ a \"ptype\" that it\n   does not understand, it ignores the result reported\
    \ with that\n   \"ptype\".\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created the \"Email Authentication Property\
    \ Types\" sub-\n   registry within the existing \"Email Authentication Parameters\"\
    \n   registry.  Entries in this registry are subject to the Expert Review\n  \
    \ rules as described in [RFC5226].  Each entry in the registry requires\n   the\
    \ following values:\n   o  The \"ptype\" token to be registered, which must fit\
    \ within the ABNF\n      described in Section 2.\n   o  A brief description of\
    \ what sort of information this \"ptype\" is\n      meant to cover.\n   o  An\
    \ optional reference to the defining document.  This is\n      recommended, but\
    \ not required.\n   The initial entries in this table are as follows, taken from\n\
    \   [RFC7001]:\n       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+\n\
    \       | ptype  | Definition  | Description                            |\n  \

    \       | header | RFC 7001    | The property being reported was found  |\n  \
    \     |        | Section 2.2 | in a header field of the message.      |\n    \
    \   +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+\n      \
    \ | policy | RFC 7001    | The property being reported relates to |\n       |\
    \        | Section 2.3 | a locally defined policy.              |\n       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+\n\
    \       | smtp   | RFC 7001    | The property being reported is a       |\n  \
    \     |        | Section 2.2 | parameter to an SMTP command used to   |\n    \
    \   |        |             | relay the message.                     |\n      \
    \ +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+\n   For new\
    \ entries, the Designated Expert needs to assure that the\n   description provided\
    \ for the new entry adequately describes the\n   intended use.  An example would\
    \ be helpful to include in the entry's\n   defining document, if any, although\
    \ entries in the \"Email\n   Authentication Methods\" registry or the \"Email\
    \ Authentication Result\n   Names\" registry might also serve as examples of intended\
    \ use.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   It is unknown how legacy code, which expects\
    \ one of a fixed set of\n   \"ptype\" tokens, will handle new tokens as they begin\
    \ to appear.\n   There are typically two options: prevent delivery of the message,\
    \ or\n   ignore those portions of the field that use unknown \"ptype\" tokens\n\
    \   and allow processing of the message to continue.\n   The choice comes down\
    \ to whether the consumer considers it a threat\n   when there are unknown \"\
    ptypes\" present.  The semantics of the report\n   are unknown; the report might\
    \ be indicating the message is authentic,\n   fraudulent, or that a test failed\
    \ to complete.  The report itself is\n   not actionable because it cannot be understood,\
    \ and only its presence\n   is certain.\n   Generally, the advice in this situation\
    \ is to ignore unknown\n   \"ptypes\".  It is anticipated that a new property\
    \ type evaluated by\n   earlier handling agents would also result in the filtering\
    \ of\n   messages by those agents until consumers can be updated to interpret\n\
    \   them.\n"
