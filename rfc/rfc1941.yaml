    \ The intended audience is educators who\n   are recently connected to the Internet,\
    \ who are accessing the\n   Internet by some means other than a direct connection,\
    \ or who are\n   just beginning to consider Internet access as a resource for\
    \ their\n   schools.  Although the Internet Engineering Task Force is an\n   international\
    \ organization and this paper will be valuable to\n   educators in many countries,\
    \ it is limited in focus to\n   internetworking in the United States.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   As more and more schools begin using technology to achieve\n\
    \   educational goals, access to the worldwide network of computer\n   networks\
    \ known as the Internet is expanding. Help for schools in the\n   form of printed\
    \ materials, electronic resources, and people is also\n   expanding. The Internet\
    \ School Networking (ISN) group of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ remains committed to articulating the\n   advantages of Internet connections\
    \ for schools and providing\n   solutions to the challenges schools face in getting\
    \ connected. The\n   FYI (For Your Information) series, which is a subset of the\
    \ IETF-\n   produced RFCs (Requests for Comments) is one way to achieve these\n\
    \   goals. (See Appendix A, \"Glossary of Terms Used in This Document\" for\n\
    \   further explanation of \"FYI\" and \"RFC.\")\n   While the IETF and ISN are\
    \ international groups, the authors of this\n   document are experienced only\
    \ in bringing the Internet to schools in\n   the United States. We are aware that\
    \ culture and the national economy\n   effect how one views the issues surrounding\
    \ school networking. (To\n   give just one example, in the United States, educational\
    \ reform is an\n   important reason for schools to get connected to the Internet.\
    \ Other\n   countries may not have the same incentive to transform the teacher's\n\
    \   role to more of a guide toward knowledge and less of a sole provider\n   of\
    \ information.) So, while this document may have a U.S. flavor, we\n   feel that\
    \ the focus will not prevent it from being useful to those in\n   other countries!\n\
    \   Some of the questions educators have about the Internet are of a more\n  \
    \ general nature, and for those we recommend reading FYI 4, \"Answers to\n   Commonly\
    \ Asked 'New Internet User' Questions.\" (For information on\n   how to get this\
    \ and other IETF documents of interest to the general\n   Internet user, See Appendix\
    \ B, \"Ways to Get RFCs.\")\n   Remember that the Internet is a changing environment.\
    \ Although we\n   have tried to include only the most stable of network services\
    \ and\n   contacts, you may still find that something listed is unavailable or\n\
    \   has changed.  The positive side of this constant change is that you\n   will\
    \ discover much on your own, and some of what you discover will be\n   new since\
    \ the writing of this document.\n   This is an update of an earlier document (FYI\
    \ 22/RFC 1578, \"Answers\n   to Commonly Asked 'Primary and Secondary School Internet\
    \ User'\n   Questions\"), and renders that document obsolete. If future updates\n\
    \   are produced, the RFC number will change again, and the FYI number\n   (22)\
    \ will remain the same.\n"

- title: 3.1  What is the Internet?
  contents:
  - "3.1  What is the Internet?\n   The Internet is a large and rapidly growing worldwide\
    \ network\n   comprised of smaller computer networks, all linked by a common\n\
    \   protocol, that enables computers of different types to exchange\n   information.\
    \ The networks are owned by countless commercial,\n   research, government, and\
    \ education organizations and individuals.\n   The Internet allows the almost\
    \ 5 million computers [1] and countless\n   users of the system to collaborate\
    \ easily and quickly either in pairs\n   or in groups. Users are able to discover\
    \ and access people and\n   information, distribute information, and experiment\
    \ with new\n   technologies and services. The Internet has become a major global\n\
    \   infrastructure used for education, research, professional learning,\n   public\
    \ service, and business.\n   There is a confusing variety of types of Internet\
    \ access. These types\n   of access are distinguished either by the services one\
    \ can use\n   (telnet, Gopher, FTP or File Transfer Protocol, World Wide Web)\
    \ or by\n   the technology underlying the access (the protocol, or rules the\n\
    \   computers must follow in order to communicate with one another). The\n   Internet\
    \ is most clearly defined by its technology, but other\n   technologies now offer\
    \ access to many of the same Internet services,\n   most notably electronic mail\
    \ and the World Wide Web. The most\n   important question for a user today is\
    \ probably not \"Am I on the\n   Internet?\" but \"Do I have access to the Internet\
    \ services I want?\"\n   See Section 5, \"Questions About Using Internet Services,\"\
    \ for further\n   discussion of telnet, Gopher, FTP, the World Wide Web, and electronic\n\
    \   mail.\n   While there is no official governing body of the Internet, the\n\
    \   Internet Society serves as the international organization for\n   Internet\
    \ cooperation and coordination. See Section 9, \"Resources and\n   Contacts\"\
    \ for Internet Society contact information.\n   For a more complete basic introduction\
    \ to the Internet, see FYI 20,\n   \"What is the Internet?\" cited in Section\

- title: 3.2  What are the benefits of using the Internet in the classroom?
  contents:
  - "3.2  What are the benefits of using the Internet in the classroom?\n   The Internet\
    \ is an exciting classroom resource. It expands the\n   classroom dramatically\
    \ by delivering information, data, images, and\n   even computer software from\
    \ places otherwise impossible to reach, and\n   it does this almost instantly.\
    \ This access to up-to-the-minute\n   information can make a student's education\
    \ more relevant. Some of\n   these materials are original sources which are too\
    \ expensive or in\n   other ways difficult for schools to own. Some information\
    \ is news\n   unfiltered by mass media, requiring students to critically assess\
    \ its\n   content and value.\n   But the Internet is not strictly a place from\
    \ which to gather\n   something.  It is also a place to communicate, to make contact\
    \ with\n   people all over the world. The Internet brings into the classroom\n\
    \   experts in every content area, new and old friends, and colleagues in\n  \
    \ education. And it allows students and teachers to leave the classroom\n   by\
    \ sharing ideas with people far away. The isolation inherent in the\n   teaching\
    \ profession is well-known among educators. By having Internet\n   access to colleagues\
    \ in other parts of the world, as well as to those\n   who work outside of classrooms,\
    \ educators are not as isolated.\n   Your site can become a valuable source of\
    \ information as well.\n   Consider the expertise in your school which could be\
    \ shared with\n   others around the world. For guidance in finding schools with\
    \ a\n   presence on the Internet, see Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts.\"\n\
    \   Use of the Internet shifts focus away from a teacher-as-expert model\n   and\
    \ toward one of shared responsibility for learning, making it a\n   vital part\
    \ of school reform. Many reform efforts attempt to move away\n   from teacher\
    \ isolation and toward teacher collaboration, away from\n   learning in a school-only\
    \ context and toward learning in a life\n   context, away from an emphasis on\
    \ knowing and toward an emphasis on\n   learning, away from a focus on content\
    \ and toward a focus on concepts\n   [2]. The Internet can play an integral part\
    \ in helping to achieve\n   these shifts, since it is well-suited for use as a\
    \ project resource.\n   Information on the Internet, as in the rest of the world\
    \ outside the\n   classroom, is not divided into separate disciplines such as\
    \ geometry,\n   writing, geography, or painting.\n   As a hands-on classroom tool,\
    \ the use of the Internet encourages the\n   kind of independence and autonomy\
    \ that many educators agree is\n   important to the learning process. Internet\
    \ use itself can also be a\n   motivator for students. Additionally, because class,\
    \ race, ability,\n   and disability are removed as factors in communication while\
    \ using\n   the Internet, it is a natural tool for addressing the needs of all\n\
    \   students.\n   There are a number of resources you can use to convince others\
    \ of the\n   benefits of the Internet in the classroom. The NASA IITA (National\n\
    \   Aeronautics and Space Administration Information Infrastructure\n   Technology\
    \ and Applications) K-12 Internet Initiative has produced an\n   11-minute video\
    \ describing the benefits to schools in using the\n   Internet.  Its title is\
    \ \"Global Quest: The Internet in the\n   Classroom.\" Another video appropriate\
    \ for a mixed audience of\n   stakeholders is \"Experience the Power: Network\
    \ Technology for\n   Education,\" produced by the National Center for Education\
    \ Statistics\n   in the U.S. Department of Education. Several articles appearing\
    \ in\n   various periodicals make a strong case for using the Internet in the\n\
    \   classroom. A particularly good one by Al Rogers of the Global\n   SchoolNet\
    \ Foundation is called, \"Global Literacy in a Gutenberg\n   Culture.\" Student\
    \ essays can also give compelling testimony.  For\n   information on the Rogers\
    \ article, see Section 8, \"Suggested\n   Reading.\" Some student essays can be\
    \ found on NASA's Quest server\n   listed in Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts,\"\
    \ as can information on\n   the videos.\n"
- title: 3.3  Will using the Internet replace teachers?
  contents:
  - "3.3  Will using the Internet replace teachers?\n   Just as textbooks, periodicals,\
    \ videos, guest speakers, and field\n   trips are often used to support a curriculum,\
    \ the Internet can be\n   used as a tool for teaching and learning. This does\
    \ not mean that it\n   must be the sole instructional method in a classroom. Teachers\
    \ will\n   remain responsible for making educated and informed decisions about\n\
    \   the best way to use the Internet as a tool, just as they do with\n   other\
    \ materials used in the classroom. They can also use the Internet\n   to individualize\
    \ student learning, making a student's classroom\n   experiences more relevant.\n"
- title: 3.4  Will this technology replace books?
  contents:
  - "3.4  Will this technology replace books?\n   There is room in any school for\
    \ all kinds of materials and resources.\n   Books and other print materials will\
    \ certainly continue to be\n   important.  Internet resources have the advantage\
    \ of tying together\n   information from all over the globe, making them useful\
    \ research\n   tools. As mentioned before, they can also provide up-to-the-minute\n\
    \   information and are therefore particularly relevant. In addition, you\n  \
    \ may be able to engage an expert in a dialog that clarifies or updates\n   what\
    \ you find in published materials.\n   One factor to consider is that much of\
    \ the material published on the\n   Internet lacks the authority imputed by an\
    \ established publishing\n   house or a reputable author, and may therefore be\
    \ viewed as less\n   reliable than books. For example, an encyclopedia or almanac\
    \ found in\n   a school library might reasonably be accepted as valid without\n\
    \   question, while a source found on the Internet may require a more\n   critical\
    \ look. However, lack of authority is not always a negative.\n   Reading an account\
    \ of the fall of the Berlin Wall by a student in the\n   local region the day\
    \ it happened can be valuable even if the student\n   is not a reputable author.\
    \ Moreover, while it's true that with\n   Internet materials it becomes increasingly\
    \ important to evaluate\n   where they came from, one of the hallmarks of a good\
    \ education is the\n   ability to assess information critically, whether the source\
    \ be\n   print, television, or some other media.\n"
- title: 3.5  How can use of the Internet be integrated into the existing
  contents:
  - "3.5  How can use of the Internet be integrated into the existing\n     curriculum?\n\
    \   This is a key question. In order for the Internet to be used\n   successfully\
    \ in schools, it must be employed as a tool to teach\n   content and to reach\
    \ educational goals that have already been\n   established. It cannot be seen\
    \ as an end in itself.\n   Individual teachers will first need to become familiar\
    \ enough with\n   the Internet to know how to do at least two things: find information\n\
    \   on topics they consider important and locate people with like\n   educational\
    \ goals.  Sections 5 and 6, \"Questions About Using Internet\n   Services\" and\
    \ \"Questions About Classroom Resources, Projects, and\n   Collaboration\" will\
    \ give you some ideas about how to begin.\n   Once they are familiar with how\
    \ to find content on the Internet, most\n   teachers can decide how to use Internet\
    \ resources to help their\n   students meet goals. For example, science teachers\
    \ often teach about\n   hurricanes and other weather phenomena in the normal course\
    \ of\n   instruction. With Internet access they can use information and\n   satellite\
    \ data pertaining to the most recent storm to make their\n   points, rather than\
    \ outdated examples from textbooks.\n   When teachers become familiar with finding\
    \ other people on the\n   Internet, some of them already grouped into network\
    \ \"communities\" of\n   interest, they can gain experience in using the Internet\
    \ from\n   educators who have been using it longer; they can join existing\n \
    \  projects, contribute to the evolution of proposed projects, and\n   propose\
    \ their own projects; and they can ask for and give help to\n   solve problems\
    \ in the classroom ranging from the content they teach,\n   to addressing students\
    \ as individuals, to mastering effective\n   discipline.\n   Internet access supports\
    \ project-based learning. A teacher in an\n   individual classroom can use the\
    \ data and information available on\n   the Internet as a resource for classroom\
    \ projects, and there are also\n   a variety of projects which take place over\
    \ the Internet in more than\n   one classroom at a time. A project may be initiated\
    \ by any educator\n   with an idea. A popular example of an educator-initiated\
    \ project is\n   one which requires data to be collected from diverse sites around\
    \ the\n   world or at least around the country. For example, together students\n\
    \   in various locations have tracked butterfly and bird migrations,\n   compared\
    \ bodies of water, and measured the north-south circumference\n   of the Earth.\
    \ Various organizations also run projects in which\n   schools can participate.\
    \ Among the many groups which have invited\n   schools to participate in projects\
    \ with a focus on a specific topic\n   are the Global SchoolNet Foundation, The\
    \ European Schools Project,\n   the International Educational and Research Network\
    \ (I*EARN), and\n   groups associated with such federal agencies as the Department\
    \ of\n   Energy, the United States Geological Survey, and the National\n   Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Administration.\n   The Internet can also be used for peer review\
    \ of student materials;\n   as a medium for publishing student newspapers, art\
    \ exhibits, and\n   science fairs; and in a global email pen-pal program for the\n\
    \   discussion of classroom topics.\n   It cannot be stressed enough that the\
    \ key factor these Internet uses\n   have in common is that they are supporting\
    \ classroom curriculum, not\n   defining it.\n   Learning about the Internet and\
    \ how to use it is an important goal\n   for any school's Internet program, but\
    \ in the classroom, the message\n   needs to be emphasized over the medium.\n\
    \   There are several sources of material for discussing curriculum\n   infusion,\
    \ including mailing lists, World Wide Web sites, and archives\n   of sample lesson\
    \ plans. Most of the mail lists, Internet computers,\n   and organizations in\
    \ Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts,\" address\n   infusion of technology into\
    \ the curriculum. See also Appendix C,\n   \"Examples of Educational Projects\
    \ Using the Internet.\"\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1  How much does it cost to connect to the Internet, and what kind of\n   \
    \  equipment does my school need to support the Internet connection?\n   The cost\
    \ of an Internet connection varies tremendously with the\n   location of your\
    \ site and the kind of connection that is appropriate\n   to your needs.  In order\
    \ to determine the cost to your school, you\n   will need to answer a number of\
    \ questions. For help in learning what\n   the questions are and getting answers\
    \ to them, begin asking at local\n   colleges, universities, technology companies,\
    \ government agencies,\n   community networks (often called \"FreeNets\"), local\
    \ electronic\n   bulletin board systems (BBS), Internet access providers, or\n\
    \   technology consultants. See also Question 4.6.\n   To give you an idea of\
    \ possible cost and equipment needs, think of\n   four groups of Internet users.\
    \ We will call them basic individual\n   users, advanced individual users, school\
    \ networks, and school\n   district networks.\n   How you approach acquiring service\
    \ depends on which category you feel\n   best describes your needs. This discussion\
    \ is based on experiences in\n   the United States. (For more information on the\
    \ Internet services\n   you'll be reading about in this section, see Section 5,\
    \ \"Questions\n   About Using Internet Services.\")\n   Basic users are individuals\
    \ who want to access common Internet\n   services such as the World Wide Web,\
    \ Gopher, and email. There are two\n   types of basic users: those who plan to\
    \ be online for a few hours per\n   week, and those who plan to be online for\
    \ many hours per day.\n   Basic individual users who require access to common\
    \ Internet services\n   such as Web pages, FTP sites, and email for only a few\
    \ hours per week\n   may be best served by one of the nationwide online services\
    \ such as\n   America Online, CompuServe, or Prodigy. These services have the\n\
    \   advantage of providing the user with a simple setup and easy,\n   graphics-based\
    \ access screens which hide the complex commands\n   required by some Internet\
    \ services. They also provide value-added\n   services not available via the general\
    \ Internet, such as access to\n   news magazines and encyclopedias.  Hardware\
    \ required is generally a\n   standard Windows-based PC or Macintosh and a 14.4\
    \ kilobits per second\n   (Kbs) or higher modem. At the time of this writing,\
    \ prices typically\n   run around $10 per month for the first 5 hours of connect\
    \ time, and\n   $2-4 per hour thereafter.\n   Basic individual users who access\
    \ common Internet services for many\n   hours per day should consider a \"shell\"\
    \ account from a local Internet\n   Service Provider (ISP). Shell accounts generally\
    \ provide access to a\n   Unix computer which is connected to the Internet, so\
    \ those choosing\n   this option should be prepared to learn a few Unix commands.\
    \ Shell\n   account users will get all the standard Internet services but at a\n\
    \   cheaper rate, generally in the $30 per month range for 6 hours per\n   day\
    \ access plus $1-2 per hour for extra hours. Most shell account\n   vendors do\
    \ not provide nationwide access, and shell accounts do not\n   have graphical\
    \ user interfaces, so you cannot use Web browsers such\n   as Netscape and Mosaic.\
    \  While you may be able to use Lynx, a text-\n   based browser, some ISPs do\
    \ not install it on their computer servers.\n   Many FreeNets also offer shell\
    \ account access gratis, but they may\n   not be able to offer much support.\n\
    \   In the United States, there are a number of statewide educational\n   networks,\
    \ most of them with access to the Internet. To find out if\n   there is a state\
    \ education network in your area which gives basic\n   user accounts to educators\
    \ and/or students, contact the Consortium\n   for School Networking (CoSN) or\
    \ consult the document \"Getting US\n   Educators Online\"  by Linda Conrad, listed\
    \ in Section 8, \"Suggested\n   Reading.\"\n   Advanced individual users are those\
    \ who want graphical user\n   interfaces to Internet services and who may want\
    \ to use their\n   computers to offer services to other Internet users. For example,\n\
    \   they may want to create Web pages for others to access or put files\n   online\
    \ for others to retrieve. If you are an advanced user, you might\n   consider\
    \ getting a Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or Point to\n   Point Protocol\
    \ (PPP) account from an Internet Service Provider. The\n   interface is similar\
    \ to that of nationwide online services available\n   to basic users, but the\
    \ performance is better and the cost is less\n   for someone who wants to use\
    \ the service for more than just a few\n   hours per week.\n   Setting up a SLIP\
    \ or PPP account requires configuration and\n   installation of Internet and SLIP/PPP\
    \ software. Some ISPs only\n   provide the software, some will install the software\
    \ for you, and\n   some preconfigure the software and send it on disk, with instructions\n\
    \   to the user, via postal mail.  Again, hardware required is generally\n   a\
    \ standard Windows-based PC or Macintosh and a 14.4 Kbs or higher\n   modem. Costs\
    \ are generally comparable to basic shell accounts, but\n   for 24-hour connections\
    \ expect to pay $100 or more per month.\n   If in your school you plan to have\
    \ more than a few individual\n   Internet users, you will need to consider a network\
    \ with a high-speed\n   dedicated line connected to the Internet. This school\
    \ network is\n   probably a small- or medium-sized network in a single building\
    \ or a\n   very few geographically close buildings. It may include only one or\n\
    \   several LANs.\n   Most high speed connectivity is provided through a dedicated\
    \ leased\n   line, which is a permanent connection between two points. This allows\n\
    \   you to have a high quality permanent Internet connection at all\n   times.\
    \ Most leased lines are provided by a telephone company, a cable\n   television\
    \ company, or a private network provider and cost $200 per\n   month or more.\
    \  Typically the connection from your LAN or LANs is a\n   digital leased line\
    \ with a Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit\n   (CSU/DSU) which costs between\
    \ $600 and $1000. Less frequently, the\n   connection is an analog leased line\
    \ with a modem which costs between\n   $200 and $800. You will also need a router\
    \ which costs roughly $1500.\n   This is a substantially more difficult setup\
    \ to manage. After you\n   have determined the ways in which you believe you will\
    \ use Internet\n   access, you should contact several ISPs in your area and compare\n\
    \   prices and services.\n   School district networks are even more complex. If\
    \ you have several\n   locations which require connectivity, you should contact\
    \ several ISPs\n   and get bids for the service.\n   The ISP world is changing\
    \ very rapidly, especially at the low end. At\n   the time of the first edition\

  - "4.2  What are the other costs associated with having Internet access?\n   When\
    \ budgeting for your school's Internet connection there are a\n   number of factors\
    \ to consider that might not seem immediately\n   obvious. Technical support and\
    \ training will incur additional ongoing\n   costs, even if those costs show up\
    \ only as someone's time. Equipment\n   will need to be maintained and upgraded\
    \ as time passes, and even when\n   all teachers have received basic Internet\
    \ training, they will most\n   likely have questions as they explore and learn\
    \ more on their own. A\n   general rule for budget planning is this: for every\
    \ dollar you spend\n   on hardware and software, plan to spend three dollars to\
    \ support the\n   technology and those using it.\n   It will be necessary for\
    \ your school to have some technical expertise\n   on-site. (See also Question\
    \ 4.4.) Your network access provider may\n   offer training and support for technical\
    \ issues, and other groups\n   also offer formal classes and seminars. If your\
    \ school has designated\n   technical personnel, they will be good candidates\
    \ for such classes\n   and seminars. If your school does not have designated technical\n\
    \   personnel, a teacher or other staff member with a strong interest may\n  \
    \ take on the task of becoming the local expert, but a better solution\n   is\
    \ to have someone dedicated to this at least part time. Students can\n   help\
    \ local experts maintain equipment and do other tasks, which\n   allows them to\
    \ learn new skills at the same time.\n   Training is an equally significant component\
    \ to deployment of the\n   Internet in schools. Most teachers learn about the\
    \ Internet during\n   the time they use to learn about any new teaching tool,\
    \ which often\n   means they \"steal\" time at lunch, on weekends, and before\
    \ and after\n   school to explore resources and pursue relationships via the\n\
    \   Internet. When a school is committed to providing the Internet as an\n   educational\
    \ resource, the administration will make in-service time\n   available. It will\
    \ also ensure that someone at the school is\n   sufficiently knowledgeable to\
    \ field questions and help people as they\n   risk trying new ways of teaching\
    \ using Internet resources. Again,\n   some students make excellent tutors.\n\
    \   Some technical support and a variety of training materials can be\n   found\
    \ by using the Internet itself. You can send questions to people\n   in the know\
    \ and join discussion lists and news groups that discuss\n   and answer questions\
    \ about support and training. The Edtech mail list\n   is one such list. Some\
    \ World Wide Web sites offer technical support\n   information.  Videos also help\
    \ bridge the information gap. See\n   Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts,\" for\
    \ a preliminary listing of\n   these resources. Your local community may also\
    \ have resources. These\n   include colleges and universities, businesses, computer\
    \ clubs and\n   user groups, technology consultants, and government agencies.\n"

  - "4.3  How can my school afford access to the Internet?\n   Although school budgets\
    \ are impossibly tight in most cases, the cost\n   of an Internet connection can\
    \ be squeezed from the budget when its\n   value becomes apparent. Costs for a\
    \ low-end connection can be\n   reasonable. (See the next question.) The challenge\
    \ facing those\n   advocating an Internet connection sometimes has less to do\
    \ with the\n   actual cost than it has with the difficulty of convincing\n   administrators\
    \ to spend money on an unfamiliar resource.\n   In order to move the Internet\
    \ connection closer to the top of your\n   school's priority list, consider at\
    \ least two possibilities. First,\n   your school may be in the process of reform,\
    \ as are many schools. As\n   mentioned earlier, use of the Internet supports\
    \ reform efforts, so\n   framing Internet access as a component to systemic reform\
    \ may help to\n   persuade some people.  Second, to convince people of the value\
    \ of a\n   connection, an actual Internet demonstration can be more useful than\n\
    \   words. While this may sound like a chicken-and-egg situation (I need\n   Internet\
    \ access to get Internet access), some organizations will\n   provide guest accounts\
    \ on an Internet-connected computer for people\n   in schools who are trying to\
    \ convince others of the value of an\n   Internet connection. Another way to begin\
    \ using Internet services is\n   to sign up for one of the popular online services\
    \ such as America\n   Online, CompuServe, or Prodigy. Once subscribed, you can\
    \ use these\n   services either from home or from school. This method is recommended\n\
    \   only as way to introduce yourself and others in your school community\n  \
    \ to the value of the Internet. It is not a good long-term solution to\n   providing\
    \ Internet access for a lot of users at one site such as a\n   school.\n   Contact\
    \ local colleges, universities, technology companies, service\n   providers, community\
    \ networks, and government agencies for both guest\n   accounts and funding ideas.\
    \ For alternatives to your own school's\n   budget or for supplements to it, look\
    \ for funding in federal, state,\n   and district budgets as well as from private\
    \ grants. Work with\n   equipment vendors to provide the hardware needed at low\
    \ or no cost to\n   your school, and consider forming a School/Community Technology\n\
    \   Committee, or a joint School District/School/Community Technology\n   Committee.\
    \ Also investigate the possibility of a back-door connection\n   to a local college\
    \ or university.  Service providers often allow\n   schools to connect to higher\
    \ education sites at a lower cost.\n   A number of sites on the Internet provide\
    \ more information about\n   grants and organizations that offer them. Two in\
    \ particular that you\n   may find useful are Grants Web, for grant information\
    \ of all kinds,\n   and the Foundation Center, for information on private and\
    \ nonprofit\n   organizations.  For information on where to find these sites on\
    \ the\n   Internet, see Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts.\"\n"

  - "4.4  What organizational structure needs to be in place in order for my\n   \
    \  school to have Internet access?\n   Schools and school districts have devised\
    \ structures that vary\n   widely, depending on a school's particular requirements.\
    \ In many\n   schools, the librarians/media specialists guide the development\
    \ of\n   the network and policies on its use and serve as the top of the\n   structure\
    \ within the school. In other schools, an interested teacher\n   becomes the driving\
    \ force behind getting the Internet into the school\n   and may be the most appropriate\
    \ person to see the project through.\n   The school administration, if not the\
    \ guiding force, needs to be\n   behind the plan to bring the Internet into the\
    \ school. And all other\n   parties who might have a stake in the development\
    \ should be brought\n   in as early as possible, whether or not they are knowledgeable\
    \ about\n   the Internet. These might include area businesses, community leaders,\n\
    \   teachers with Internet access at home, the librarian or media\n   specialist,\
    \ parents, and anyone in the school who finds the idea of\n   bringing the Internet\
    \ into the school appealing. In short, any\n   organizational structure will do\
    \ as long as it is clear and simple\n   and includes the people who might have\
    \ a stake in the process of\n   bringing the Internet into the school.\n   One\
    \ way to ensure that an organizational structure develops and that\n   the right\
    \ people become involved is to invite a wide variety of\n   people to create a\
    \ technology plan for the school. The by-product of\n   technology planning can\
    \ be the development of an organizational\n   structure, but of course the planning\
    \ is useful in itself to help\n   your school define and meet goals for Internet\
    \ and other technology\n   use. The National Center for Technology Planning hosts\
    \ a collection\n   of technology plans and planning aids for people who need help,\
    \ new\n   ideas, or solutions as they tackle technology planning in their\n  \
    \ schools or districts. Information on the National Center for\n   Technology\
    \ Planning can be found in Section 9, \"Resources and\n   Contacts.\"\n   No matter\
    \ what the structure, there should be someone at the school\n   who can take the\
    \ lead in working with vendors and Internet Service\n   Providers (ISPs). This\
    \ person should be knowledgeable about - or\n   willing to learn about - the technical\
    \ aspects of connecting to the\n   Internet, including knowledge about any networks\
    \ the school already\n   has in place. The lead person should have an alternate\
    \ so that the\n   school is not completely dependent on one person. If your school\n\
    \   hires an independent consultant, someone at the school should be\n   aware\
    \ of everything the consultant does and should receive at least\n   some training\
    \ in the areas of the consultant's work.\n   Another role that must be filled\
    \ is that of in-house network\n   administrator. Having an already busy teacher\
    \ take on this role as an\n   extra duty is a bad idea; a greater time commitment\
    \ is needed.\n"

    \   There are a number of questions you should ask. Anything you hear\n   that\
    \ you don't understand must be questioned. If a vendor knows the\n   product and\
    \ the process well, he or she should be able to explain in\n   terms you can understand.\n\
    \   You should also ask any kind of vendor how available they are and at\n   what\
    \ point they either stop helping you or begin charging by the\n   hour. Get references\
    \ from other customers, preferably including at\n   least one school which has\
    \ requirements similar to yours.\n   Questions for LAN vendors:\n      If the\
    \ school has not yet purchased a Local Area Network (LAN),\n      ask the LAN\
    \ vendor how the product will interact with TCP/IP.\n      (TCP/IP stands for\

    \ to the services.) Ask the vendors\n      if they can provide services that will\
    \ meet your requirements.\n   Questions for Internet Service Providers:\n    \
    \  In general, ask the ISP what services are included with your\n      purchase\

    \ you?\n      Will they register your domain name with the InterNIC?\n      Are\
    \ they providing you with all the IP addresses you need?\n      Will they help\
    \ you with security issues?\n      Do they provide a newsfeed or a newsreading\
    \ service? (Do you know\n      the difference?)\n      If they agree to do some\
    \ work on the LAN side, what is the extent\n      of that work? (Configure individual\
    \ computers? Handle subnetting\n      and routing issues?)\n      Will they answer\
    \ questions from your network administrator?\n      Will a dedicated computer\
    \ be needed as an Internet server for such\n      things as domain name service,\
    \ the World Wide Web, Gopher, and\n      FTP?\n      Do they provide any training\

    \ price?\n      Do they offer any other classes or seminars and are these included\n\
    \      in the connectivity price?\n      Does the ISP do their own training or\
    \ do they contract to someone\n      else, and if the latter, who is it? Check\
    \ references on any\n      contractors.\n      Questions for Internet Service\
    \ Providers furnishing dial-in\n      service:\n      There are some specific\
    \ questions you should ask of an ISP who is\n      providing dial-in connections.\

    \      Internet services such as email and the World Wide Web or will\n      they\
    \ help you obtain it?\n      Will they help you install it?\n      Ask for references\
    \ of other clients using dial-in service and when\n      you check them, one of\
    \ the questions to ask other customers is if\n      they encounter lots of busy\

    \ the school should they be located?\n   You should make Internet access possible\
    \ for as many of your school's\n   computers as possible. Ideally, you have computers\
    \ located throughout\n   the school - in classrooms, the library, and laboratories\
    \ - and they\n   are all connected together with printers and other peripherals\
    \ in one\n   or more LANs. In that case, you acquire one dedicated Internet\n\
    \   connection of 56 Kbs (Kilobits per second) or higher to serve the\n   whole\
    \ school.\n   If your budget and existing computer equipment are both limited,\
    \ you\n   can use a dial-up service and a modem to access the Internet, but in\n\
    \   most cases that will only be viable for one computer at a time. As\n   use\
    \ of the Internet catches on in your school, it will eventually be\n   more effective\
    \ for you to create the LAN with Internet access\n   mentioned above than to keep\
    \ adding modems in classrooms.\n   If you must choose between Internet access\
    \ in one lab in the school\n   or Internet access for the same number of computers\
    \ throughout the\n   school, in order to get teachers to use the access you must\
    \ make it\n   available where they can most easily take advantage of it. This\n\
    \   usually means that you make access available throughout the school.\n   Although\
    \ a computer lab is an easier maintenance set-up for the\n   person in charge\
    \ of keeping the equipment running and allows each\n   individual (or pair) in\
    \ an entire class to be using a computer at the\n   same time, a computer located\
    \ in the classroom is more convenient for\n   both the teacher and the class.\
    \ Internet resources can be more easily\n   integrated into a classroom lesson,\
    \ and the emphasis remains on using\n   the Internet as an instructional tool.\
    \ Since only one or two\n   computers can usually be placed in each classroom,\
    \ teachers will\n   learn to allocate computer time creatively. And if you are\
    \ able to\n   provide only a few computers throughout the school, make sure that\
    \ at\n   least one of them is in the library where all students will have the\n\
    \   chance to be exposed to the Internet as a resource.\n   Networking all computers\
    \ campus-wide can be expensive. You may want\n   to investigate initially giving\
    \ one lab, the library, and a few\n   classrooms dial-up access, assuming phone\
    \ lines are available. Even a\n   connection to only one classroom as a demonstration\
    \ may help you to\n   garner more support for creating a campus-wide local area\
    \ network\n   that is routed to the Internet through a dedicated line.\n"

    \ by the European\n   Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) located in Geneva,\
    \ Switzerland\n   and currently driven by the World Wide Web Consortium. When\
    \ exploring\n   the World Wide Web, users navigate through documents by selecting\n\
    \   highlighted text that leads to another document or location. The\n   highlighted\
    \ text can be called a \"pointer,\" a \"link,\" or an \"anchor.\"\n   This navigation\

    \ the Web is like using any\n   other service on the Internet: you run a client\
    \ on your computer\n   which accesses a server, in this case a Web server, running\
    \ on\n   another computer. In Web terms, the client is called a browser. The\n\
    \   browser retrieves and reads documents from Web servers. Information\n   providers\
    \ establish Web servers for use by network users, and when\n   you become proficient\
    \ at using the Internet, you may want to become\n   exactly that kind of information\
    \ provider.\n   Most Web browsers share common features. One feature is the hotlist,\n\
    \   or bookmark. This allows you to mark your favorite sites. Your\n   browser\
    \ will store these sites and their addresses and allow you to\n   revisit them\
    \ later by simply selecting the name of a site from a\n   menu. Another feature\
    \ common to most browsers allows you to save the\n   current file to your local\
    \ disk.  Some browsers keep a tally of the\n   sites you've visited recently and\
    \ allow you to revisit them without\n   typing in the location again. Every browser\
    \ is different, so it pays\n   to explore your own client software and learn its\

    \ experience,\n   find that it's easy to learn to use a browser just by exploring\
    \ on\n   their own.\n   Each document contained on Web servers across the Internet\
    \ has a\n   unique address. This is called a URL, a uniform resource locator.\n\
    \   Browsers negotiate URLs just like mail software negotiates email\n   addresses.\

    \ described here. For more\n   information, see \"EFF's (Extended) Guide to the\
    \ Internet\" by the\n   Electronic Frontier Foundation, and \"The Whole Internet\
    \ User's Guide\n   and Catalog\" by Ed Krol, both of which are listed in Section\
    \ 8,\n   \"Suggested Reading,\" in addition to the Glossary entries mentioned\n\
    \   for each tool.\n   Email.  Email is probably the most basic tool on the Internet.\
    \ It is\n   short for electronic mail and may be used in a couple of ways. You\n\
    \   can send messages back and forth with just one person, or you can\n   participate\
    \ with a group of people who discuss topics of common\n   interest. These groups\
    \ are called mail lists. You join and leave the\n   lists by sending email to\
    \ one address, and you post messages to all\n   the people on the list by sending\
    \ email to a slightly different\n   address. Sometimes a human does the list registration\
    \ and sometimes a\n   software program does it. For more information see the entries\
    \ for\n   email and mailing lists in the Glossary.  A list of mail lists\n   related\
    \ to primary and secondary education can be found in Section 9,\n   \"Resources\
    \ and Contacts.\"\n   Network News.  Also known as Usenet News or Net News. Reading\
    \ news is\n   similar to joining an email list, but instead of the messages coming\n\
    \   to your mailbox, you use news reader software to read messages on a\n   computer\
    \ where they are accumulated. For more information see the\n   entry for Usenet\
    \ News in the Glossary.\n   FTP.  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and just\
    \ as the name\n   implies, it allows you to transfer files from one computer to\n\
    \   another. It is the name for both the protocol and the program. A\n   special\
    \ kind of FTP, Anonymous FTP, allows you to access the many\n   public archives\
    \ on the Internet. FTP is not used by itself as much as\n   it used to be, since\
    \ people often use Web browsers and Gopher clients\n   which incorporate FTP when\
    \ they want to retrieve files. For more\n   information see the entries for Anonymous\
    \ FTP and FTP in the\n   Glossary.\n   Telnet.  Telnet allows you to log into\
    \ a computer somewhere else on\n   the Internet and use the services there. For\
    \ example, if you don't\n   have a Gopher client or a Web browser, there are some\
    \ public access\n   sites that you can telnet to in order to use a Gopher client\
    \ or a\n   text-based Web browser.\n   Gopher.  Gopher is a tool that lets you\
    \ browse for information on the\n   Internet using menus. If you know what you're\
    \ looking for and have an\n   idea about where to find it, Gopher can make your\
    \ search easier. And\n   when you have located something of interest, whether\
    \ it's a document,\n   a data set, or a picture, Gopher will retrieve it for you.\
    \ For more\n   information see the entry for Gopher in the Glossary.\n   Searching\
    \ and Indexing Tools.  Archie is a tool for searching FTP\n   sites; Veronica\
    \ (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Network Index to\n   Computerized Archives, which\
    \ works the same way Archie does) is a\n   tool for searching Gopherspace; WAIS\
    \ (Wide Area Information Service;\n   pronounced \"wayz\") is a tool for searching\
    \ indexed databases, whether\n   the databases are full of numbers, text, or graphics\
    \ files; and\n   Yahoo, Lycos, and WebCrawler are some of the many searching and\n\
    \   indexing tools available on and for the World Wide Web. For more\n   information\
    \ see the entries for Archie, Gopher, WAIS, WWW, and\n   Veronica in the Glossary.\n\
    \   Videoconferencing. At the time of this writing, schools are beginning\n  \
    \ to participate in conferences, meetings, and collaborative activities\n   via\
    \ video. The two services or applications used are Multicast\n   Backbone (MBONE)\
    \ and CU-SeeMe, both of which allow for desktop\n   videoconferencing, or videoconferencing\
    \ via computer.\n   MBONE is an option for videoconferencing using several operating\n\
    \   systems at the time of this writing: Unix, Windows NT, Windows 95,\n   and\
    \ Mac Operating System 7.5.2. It requires that your Internet\n   service provider\
    \ be a part of the MBONE, which depends on a\n   specialized routing strategy.\
    \  Ask your service provider if they are\n   equipped to support MBONE traffic.\
    \  If so, you will need to work\n   fairly closely with your provider to establish\
    \ working configurations\n   for your network. More information on MBONE is available\
    \ at the MBONE\n   Information Web. (See Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts.\"\
    )\n   CU-SeeMe, developed by Cornell University, also presents conferencing\n\
    \   capabilities over an IP network. You may participate in a CU-SeeMe\n   videoconference\
    \ as a sender, a recipient, or both. Through use of\n   reflectors, multiple sites\
    \ may participate in any given conference.\n   For any of these activities, you'll\
    \ need a PC or a Macintosh with a\n   connection to the Internet and CU-SeeMe\
    \ software. Additionally, if\n   you'd like to send video and audio, you will\
    \ need a video camera and\n   a video board in your computer. Full information\
    \ on the hardware\n   requirements is available at the CU-SeeMe Web site; there\
    \ is also a\n   mailing list for CU-SeeMe information. For guidance and discussion\n\
    \   about using CU-SeeMe as an instructional tool, the Global SchoolNet\n   Foundation\
    \ hosts a mail list called cu-seeme-schools which announces\n   opportunities\
    \ for participation in CU-SeeMe events. For information\n   on the Web site and\

- title: 7.1  I've heard that there is a lot of objectionable material on the
  contents:
  - "7.1  I've heard that there is a lot of objectionable material on the\n     Internet.\
    \  How do I deal with that problem?\n   Because sensational media accounts tend\
    \ to downplay the educational\n   uses of the Internet in favor of the more controversial\
    \ material\n   available, this will almost certainly be an issue raised when you\n\
    \   discuss getting an Internet connection in your school. Concerned\n   educators\
    \ should learn more about this issue and formulate a strategy\n   for resolving\
    \ problems before they arise. One important point to\n   realize early is that\
    \ students do not accidentally bump into\n   objectionable material in the course\
    \ of most educational\n   explorations. Although we are not suggesting that people\
    \ never run\n   across objectionable material by chance, most find this material\
    \ only\n   because they're looking for it.\n   At the time of this writing the\
    \ most important and effective action\n   schools can take is to develop clear\
    \ policies to guide students' use\n   of the Internet and establish rules - and\
    \ consequences for breaking\n   them - that govern behavior on the Internet. These\
    \ policies, called\n   Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), work best when they are\
    \ in line with\n   rules governing other behavior at school. Additionally, schools\n\
    \   should integrate issues around technology and ethics into the\n   curriculum\
    \ [3]. Schools need to exercise reasonable oversight while\n   realizing that\
    \ it is almost impossible to absolutely guarantee that\n   students will not be\
    \ able to access objectionable material. It may be\n   wise to make this clear\
    \ to parents and students before a student is\n   given access to the Internet.\
    \ To limit a school's liability, some\n   systems obtain signed releases from\
    \ students and parents stipulating\n   that they have read the AUP and that the\
    \ student agrees to abide by\n   it.\n   Several commercial software products\
    \ are available which attempt to\n   address the problem of access to objectionable\
    \ material. They block\n   access to controversial sites, look for specific text\
    \ in email\n   messages, or do both. Some can be configured in the home or school\n\
    \   and some block a preconfigured collection of sites which is\n   maintained\
    \ and configured by the company.\n   Some success has been achieved through the\
    \ use of proxy servers. A\n   school hooks up all its computers to a single computer\
    \ that has full\n   Internet access. This computer server then becomes the gateway\
    \ to the\n   Internet for all of the school computers. The server can be\n   configured\
    \ to mask away sites that have objectionable material,\n   including Web pages,\
    \ Gopher and FTP sites, and network news and WAIS\n   servers. One further step\
    \ can be taken by also installing a caching\n   server on the gateway machine.\
    \ A caching server can hold Web pages\n   locally after they have been retrieved\
    \ from other sites. Once a page\n   has been loaded into the server it can thereafter\
    \ be fetched from the\n   cache, useful if a set of Web pages needs to be accessed\
    \ frequently\n   from a site that is usually busy.\n   Although proxy and caching\
    \ servers are relatively easy to set up by a\n   system administrator, entering\
    \ all the sites that are objectionable\n   and keeping the cache up to date can\
    \ be time consuming. Also, this\n   method does not stop teachers and students\
    \ from receiving and sending\n   objectionable material as email attachments.\n\
    \   The store-and-forward method is one way to filter information to\n   which\
    \ students are exposed. Usenet News and email (both described in\n   Section 5,\
    \ \"Questions About Using Internet Services\") are \"stored\" on\n   a computer\
    \ until the time appointed for that computer to contact the\n   next one along\
    \ the path to the final destination, at which time it is\n   \"forwarded\" along\
    \ its way. Most computers are set up to process\n   outgoing requests at least\
    \ every 30 minutes. This method requires\n   quite a bit of management on the\
    \ part of humans.\n   It is also possible to control the times and opportunities\
    \ that\n   students have to access the Internet and only allow access under\n\
    \   supervision. Many teachers find that engaging their students in\n   meaningful,\
    \ supervised learning activities operates as an effective\n   deterrent to unauthorized\
    \ Internet exploration.\n   At the time of this writing none of the technical\
    \ solutions discussed\n   above has proven wholly successful in addressing the\
    \ problem of\n   student access to controversial material. However, this area\
    \ is\n   currently the focus of intense development efforts. In the mean time,\n\
    \   these solutions may be used in combination with clear policies and\n   consequences\
    \ for breaking them to ensure the integrity of the school,\n   its students, and\
    \ its educators. No matter what option or combination\n   of options you choose,\
    \ teaching the ethics of Internet access as a\n   matter of course is imperative.\n\
    \   There are resources for further exploration of the issue of students\n   and\
    \ objectionable material available on the Internet. The National\n   Center for\
    \ Missing and Exploited Children has produced a sensible and\n   practical brochure\
    \ entitled, \"Child Safety on the Information\n   Highway,\" written by Los Angeles\
    \ Times columnist Lawrence J. Magid.\n   It is available both online and hardcopy.\
    \ Another good document,\n   \"Internet Parental Control Frequently Asked Questions,\"\
    \ describes the\n   tools available at the time of this writing to help with issues\
    \ of\n   children using the Internet, from guidance by parents to government\n\
    \   restrictions to rating and filtering systems. It is produced by the\n   Voters\
    \ Telecommunications Watch and is available on the Internet.\n   There is also\
    \ at least one mailing list which you may want to join\n   called Children Accessing\
    \ Controversial Information (CACI). For\n   information on all of these, please\

  - "7.3  How do we keep viruses from attacking all of our computers if we\n     get\
    \ connected to the Internet?\n   Even if you use the Internet to exchange only\
    \ data (such as text or\n   pictures), virus infection can be a problem. This\
    \ is because many\n   programs today allow data files to include commands which\
    \ are run\n   when the data is loaded. Certainly when you download software\n\
    \   programs and run them on your own computer you should use caution.\n   Anything\
    \ you download over the Internet or an electronic bulletin\n   board system could\
    \ have a virus. For that matter, any program and\n   even some documents, whether\
    \ on tape or a disk, including commercial\n   software still in its original packaging,\
    \ might possibly have a\n   virus. Therefore there are two precautions you should\
    \ take. First,\n   install virus protection software on all your computers.  Second,\
    \ use\n   only trusted sources from which to download software and files. If\n\
    \   you are uncertain about whether to download something, ask someone\n   first.\n\
    \   Virus checking software is available free over the Internet via\n   Anonymous\
    \ FTP from the CERT Coordination Center. Your hardware or\n   software vendor,\
    \ your network access provider, your technical support\n   resources, or your\
    \ colleagues on network mailing lists should be able\n   to provide more specific\
    \ information applicable to your site. Contact\n   information for the CERT Coordination\
    \ Center can be found in Section\n   9, \"Resources and Contacts.\"\n"
- title: 7.4  What are the rules for using the Internet?

  - "7.4  What are the rules for using the Internet?\n   When your Internet connection\
    \ is established, your access provider\n   should acquaint you with their Acceptable\
    \ Use Policy. This policy\n   explains acceptable and unacceptable uses for your\
    \ connection. For\n   example, it is in all cases unacceptable to use the network\
    \ for\n   illegal purposes. It may, in some cases, be unacceptable to use the\n\
    \   network for commercial purposes.  If such a policy is not mentioned,\n   ask\
    \ for it. All users are expected to know what the acceptable and\n   unacceptable\
    \ uses of their network are.\n   Remember that it is essential to establish a\
    \ school-wide policy in\n   addition to the provider's AUP. A school's AUP is\
    \ usually more\n   restrictive and specific than the one used by the service provider.\
    \ A\n   repository of sample school AUPs can be found on the Armadillo Web\n \
    \  server, listed in section 9, \"Resources and Contacts.\" As mentioned\n   earlier,\
    \ some school systems have found it worthwhile to make\n   Internet access contingent\
    \ upon a student's signed agreement to abide\n   by the school's AUP.\n   Beyond\
    \ your service provider's AUP and the one you create for your\n   school, there\
    \ are no overreaching rules for Internet use. There are,\n   however, community\
    \ standards and conventions that should be observed.\n   You can review some generally\
    \ agreed-upon guidelines at Arlene\n   Rinaldi's etiquette page and by reading\
    \ FYI 28 (RFC 1855),\n   \"Netiquette Guidelines.\" See Section 9, \"Resources\
    \ and Contacts,\" for\n   the location of the etiquette page, and Appendix B,\
    \ \"Ways to Get\n   RFCs\" for instructions on obtaining FYI 28.\n"

    \ username \"anonymous.\" This was devised as a method to provide a\n   relatively\
    \ secure way of providing restricted access to public data.\n   Users who wish\
    \ to acquire data from a public source may use FTP to\n   connect to the source,\
    \ then use the special username \"anonymous\" and\n   their email address as the\
    \ password to log into a public data area.\n   Archie\n   A system to automatically\
    \ gather, index and serve information on the\n   Internet. The initial implementation\
    \ of Archie provided an indexed\n   directory of filenames from all anonymous\
    \ FTP archives on the\n   Internet.  Later versions provide other collections\
    \ of information.\n   Client\n   An application which requests information from,\
    \ or requests a service\n   of, a shared resource (a computer or \"server\").\
    \ See also Server.\n   Cracker\n   A person who uses computer knowledge to attempt\
    \ to gain access to\n   computer systems and/or maliciously damage those systems\
    \ or data.\n   Dial-in (also dial-up)\n   A connection, usually made via modems,\
    \ between two computers (or\n   servers) over standard voice grade telephone lines.\n\
    \   Download\n   To copy data from a remote computer to a local computer. The\
    \ opposite\n   of upload.\n   DSU/CSU (Data Service Unit/Channel Service Unit)\n\
    \   The digital equivalent of a modem. A Channel Service Unit connects to\n  \
    \ a telephone company-provided digital data circuit, and a Data Service\n   Unit\
    \ provides the electronics required to connect digital equipment\n   to the CSU.\
    \  Paired together a DSU/CSU allows computer equipment to\n   be connected into\
    \ the telephone digital service for highly\n   conditioned, high speed data communications.\n\
    \   Electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS)\n   A computer, and associated software,\
    \ which typically provides\n   electronic messaging services, archives of files,\
    \ and any other\n   services or activities of interest to the bulletin board system's\n\
    \   operator. Although BBSs have traditionally been the domain of\n   hobbyists,\
    \ an increasing number of BBSs are connected directly to the\n   Internet, and\
    \ many BBSs are currently operated by government,\n   educational, and research\
    \ institutions.\n   Email (Electronic Mail)\n   A system whereby a computer user\
    \ can exchange messages with other\n   computer users (or groups of users) via\
    \ a communications network.\n   FidoNet\n   A network of computers interconnected\
    \ using the FIDO dial-up\n   protocols.  The FIDO protocol provides a means of\
    \ \"store and forward\"\n   file transfer similar to UUCP.\n   FTP (File Transfer\
    \ Protocol)\n   A protocol which allows a user on one host to access, and transfer\n\
    \   files to and from, another host over a network.  Also, FTP is usually\n  \
    \ the name of the program the user invokes to execute the protocol.\n   FYI (For\
    \ Your Information)\n   A subseries of RFCs that are not technical standards or\
    \ descriptions\n   of protocols.  FYIs convey general information about topics\
    \ related\n   to TCP/IP or the Internet. See also RFC (Request for Comments).\n\
    \   Gopher\n   A distributed information service that makes available hierarchical\n\
    \   collections of information across the Internet. Gopher uses a simple\n   protocol\
    \ that allows a single Gopher client to access information\n   from any accessible\
    \ Gopher server, providing the user with a single\n   \"Gopher space\" of information.\
    \ Public domain versions of the client\n   and server are available\n   Hacker\n\
    \   A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the\n   internal\
    \ workings of a system, computers and computer networks in\n   particular. The\
    \ popular media has corrupted this term to give it the\n   pejorative connotation\
    \ of a person who maliciously uses computer\n   knowledge to cause damage to computers\
    \ and data. The proper term for\n   this type of person is \"cracker.\"\n   Home\
    \ page\n   A form of Web page that serves as the introductory or main page for\
    \ a\n   subject. The home page generally contains basic information about a\n\
    \   subject and hypertext links to other pages which contain more\n   detailed\
    \ information. See also WWW and Web page.\n   Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF)\n   The IETF is a large, open community of network designers, operators,\n\
    \   vendors, and researchers whose purpose is to coordinate the\n   operation,\
    \ management and evolution of the Internet, and to resolve\n   short-range and\
    \ mid-range protocol and architectural issues. It is a\n   major source of protocol\
    \ proposals and standards.\n   Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n   See Network\
    \ Access Provider.\n   InterNIC\n   A Network Information Center (NIC), funded\
    \ by the National Science\n   foundation, that provides information about the\
    \ Internet. The\n   InterNIC offers support in the areas of Information Services\
    \ (the\n   task most often cited in this document), Registration Services, and\n\
    \   Directory and Database Services.\n   Kbs (Kilo-Bits per Second)\n   A data\
    \ transmission rate expressed in 1000 bit per second units. For\n   example, 56\
    \ Kbs is 56*1000 = 56,000 bits per second.\n   LAN (Local Area Network)\n   A\
    \ data network intended to serve an area of only a few square\n   kilometers or\
    \ less. Since such networks are relatively small, they\n   can usually be directly\
    \ controlled by the users and operate at\n   relatively high speeds (up to 100\
    \ Mbs [10 million bits per second])\n   over inexpensive wiring.\n   Leased line\n\
    \   A leased line is a special phone company permanent connection between\n  \
    \ two locations. Leased lines are generally used where high-speed data\n   (usually\
    \ 960 characters per second and higher) is continually\n   exchanged between two\
    \ computers (in the Internet, generally between\n   routers). A leased line is\
    \ billed at the same rate per month\n   independent of how much the line is used\
    \ and can be cheaper than\n   using dial modems depending on the usage.  Leased\
    \ lines may also be\n   used where higher data rates are needed beyond what a\
    \ dial modem can\n   provide.\n   Listserv (mailing list server)\n   An automated\
    \ program that accepts mail messages from users and\n   performs basic operations\
    \ on mailing lists for those users. In the\n   Internet, listservs are usually\
    \ accessed as \"listname@host.\" For\n   example, the list server for the hypothetical\
    \ list\n   \"newsreports@acme.org\" would be called \"listserv@acme.org.\" Sending\n\
    \   email to \"newsreports@acme.org\" causes the message to be sent to all\n \
    \  the list subscribers, while sending a message (to subscribe or\n   unsubscribe,\
    \ for example) to \"listserv@acme.org\" sends the message\n   only to the list\
    \ server program. Not all mailing lists use list\n   servers to handle list administration\
    \ duties. More than one automated\n   mailing program exists on the Internet,\
    \ although the term \"listserv\"\n   is sometimes confusingly used to refer to\
    \ any such program.\n   Mailing Lists\n   A list of email addresses.  Generally,\
    \ a mailing list is used to\n   discuss a certain set of topics, and different\
    \ mailing lists discuss\n   different topics.  A mailing list may be moderated.\
    \ That is, messages\n   sent to the list are actually sent to a moderator who\
    \ determines\n   whether or not to send the messages on to everyone else.  Many\n\
    \   mailing lists are maintained by mail handling software such as\n   listserv,\
    \ majordomo, or listproc, which are programs that\n   automatically handle operations\
    \ such as adding new people to the\n   list.  (See above.) In the Internet, for\
    \ those mailing lists\n   maintained by a human, rather than by a program, you\
    \ can generally\n   subscribe to a list by sending a mail message to: \"listname-\n\
    \   REQUEST@host\" and in the body of the message enter a request to\n   subscribe.\
    \  To send messages to other subscribers, you will then use\n   the address \"\
    listname@host.\"\n   Modem (MODulator/DEModulator)\n   A device that converts\
    \ the digital signals used by computers into\n   analog signals needed by voice\
    \ telephone systems.\n   Network Access Provider (Network Service Provider, Internet\
    \ Service\n   Provider)\n   Any organization that provides network connectivity\
    \ or dial-up\n   access.  Service providers may be corporations, government agencies,\n\
    \   universities, or other organizations.\n   Network News\n   Another name for\
    \ \"Usenet News.\"\n   NIC (Network Information Center)\n   A central place where\
    \ information about a network within the Internet\n   is maintained. Usually NICs\
    \ are staffed by personnel who answer user\n   telephone calls and electronic\
    \ mail, and provide general network\n   usage information and referrals, among\
    \ other possible tasks. Most\n   network service providers also provide a NIC\
    \ for their users.\n   Port\n   A specific access point on an Internet computer,\
    \ designated by a\n   number.  Most common Internet services, such as the World\
    \ Wide Web,\n   have specific port numbers associated with them, which makes it\n\
    \   easier for applications on the Internet to interact. Human users of\n   the\
    \ Intern et normally do not need to worry about port numbers.\n   PPP (Point to\
    \ Point Protocol)\n   A protocol used to establish TCP/IP connections using serial\
    \ lines\n   such as dial-up telephone lines. Similar to SLIP (see below), PPP\
    \ is\n   a later standard that includes features such as demand dial-up,\n   compression,\
    \ and better flow control.\n   Protocol\n   A formal description of message formats\
    \ and the rules two computers\n   must follow to exchange those messages. Protocols\
    \ can describe low-\n   level details of machine-to-machine interfaces (e.g.,\
    \ the order in\n   which bits and bytes are sent across a wire) or high-level\
    \ exchanges\n   between allocation programs (e.g., the way in which two programs\n\
    \   transfer a file across the Internet).\n   Protocol Stack\n   A series of protocols\
    \ linked together to provide an end-to-end\n   service.  For example, the File\
    \ Transfer Protocol uses the\n   Transmission Control Protocol, which uses the\
    \ Internet Protocol,\n   which may use the Point to Point protocol, to transfer\
    \ a file from\n   one computer to another. The series FTP->TCP->IP->PPP is called\
    \ a\n   protocol stack.\n   RFC (Request for Comments)\n   The document series,\
    \ begun in 1969, which describes the Internet\n   suite of protocols and related\
    \ experiments. Not all (in fact very\n   few) RFCs describe Internet standards,\
    \ but all Internet standards are\n   written up as RFCs. The RFCs include the\
    \ documentary record of the\n   Internet standards process.\n   Router\n   A computer\
    \ which forwards traffic between networks. The forwarding\n   decision is based\
    \ on network layer information and routing tables,\n   often constructed by routing\
    \ protocols.\n   Server\n   A shared resource which provides information or services\
    \ to user\n   applications or clients. See also Client.\n   SLIP (Serial Line\
    \ Internet Protocol)\n   A protocol used to establish TCP/IP connections using\
    \ serial lines\n   such as dial-up telephone lines. Small computers, such as PCs\
    \ and\n   Macintoshes, can use SLIP to dial up to servers, which then allow the\n\
    \   computer to act as a full Internet node. SLIP is generally used at\n   sites\
    \ with a few users as a cheaper alternative than a full Internet\n   connection.\
    \ SLIP is being replaced by PPP at many sites.\n   TCP/IP (Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol/Internet Protocol)\n   TCP/IP is named for two of the major communications\
    \ protocols used\n   within the Internet (TCP and IP). These protocols (along\
    \ with several\n   others) provide the basic foundation for communications between\
    \ hosts\n   in the Internet. All of the service protocols, such as FTP, Telnet,\n\
    \   and Gopher, use TCP/IP to transfer information.\n   Telnet\n   Telnet is the\
    \ Internet standard protocol for remote terminal\n   connection service. The name\
    \ \"telnet\" also is used to refer to\n   programs that allow interactive access\
    \ to remote computers, as well\n   as the action of using said programs. For example,\
    \ the phrase \"Telnet\n   to host xyzzy\" means to interactively log into host\
    \ \"xyzzy\" from some\n   other host in the Internet.\n   Upload\n   To copy data\
    \ from a local computer to a remote computer. The opposite\n   of download.\n\
    \   Usenet News\n   An electronic bulletin board system created originally by\
    \ the Unix\n   community and which is accessible via the Internet. Usenet News\
    \ forms\n   a discussion forum accessible by millions of users in almost every\n\
    \   country in the world. Usenet News consists of thousands of topics\n   arranged\
    \ in a hierarchical form. Major topics include \"comp\" for\n   computer topics,\
    \ \"rec\" for recreational topics, \"soc\" for social\n   topics, \"sci\" for\
    \ science topics, etc. Within the major topics are\n   subtopics, such as \"rec.music.classical\"\
    \ for classical music, or\n   \"sci.med.physics\" for discussions relating to\
    \ the physics of medical\n   science.\n   UUCP (Unix-to-Unix CoPy)\n   This was\
    \ initially a program run under the Unix operating system that\n   allowed one\
    \ Unix system to send files to another Unix system via\n   dial-up phone lines.\
    \ Today, the term is more commonly used to\n   describe the large international\
    \ network which uses the UUCP protocol\n   to pass news and electronic mail.\n\
    \   Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Network Index to Computerized\n   Archives)\n\
    \   A utility which searches Gopher servers based on a user's list of\n   keywords.\n\
    \   Virus\n   A program which replicates itself on computer systems by\n   incorporating\
    \ itself into other programs which are shared among\n   computer systems. The\
    \ term virus is also often used more generally to\n   refer to any unauthorized\
    \ software intrusion into a computer, no\n   matter the type or behavior of the\
    \ program.\n   Web\n   See WWW.\n   Web page\n   A document, usually containing\
    \ hypertext links, which is available\n   through the World Wide Web. Web pages\
    \ are composed in a special\n   language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),\
    \ which allows basic\n   formatting such as font sizes, bold, underline, blinking\
    \ text, and\n   inclusion of graphics images. Web pages usually contain hypertext\n\
    \   links to other Web pages. See also WWW and Home page.\n   WAIS (Wide Area\
    \ Information Server)\n   A distributed information service which offers simple\
    \ natural\n   language input, indexed searching for fast retrieval, and a\n  \
    \ \"relevance feedback\" mechanism which allows the results of initial\n   searches\
    \ to influence future searches. Public domain implementations\n   are available.\n\
    \   WWW (World Wide Web)\n   A hypertext-based, distributed information system\
    \ created by\n   researchers at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)\
    \ in\n   Switzerland.  The Web information system may be used to create, edit,\n\
    \   or browse hypertext documents. The Web protocol interlinks\n   information\
    \ in such a way that a user can traverse the Web from any\n   starting point.\
    \ The protocol also interacts with many other Internet\n   services, such as Gopher,\
    \ to provide one consistent, transparent user\n   interface to the Internet. Client\
    \ and server software is widely\n   available via a number of methods: as free\
    \ software, as client\n   software often included as part of an Internet connection\
    \ package, or\n   as a commercial product.\n"

    \   Example Three: MathMagic; Math at Various Grade Levels\n   ------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   [Note: The MathMagic World Wide Web home page is located at\n   http://forum.swarthmore.edu/mathmagic/]\n\
    \   What is MathMagic?\n   MathMagic is a K-12 telecommunications project developed\
    \ in El Paso,\n   Texas. It provides strong motivation for students to use computer\n\
    \   technology while increasing problem-solving strategies and\n   communications\
    \ skills. MathMagic posts challenges in each of four\n   categories (k-3, 4-6,\
    \ 7-9 and 10-12) to trigger each registered team\n   to pair up with another team\
    \ and engage in a problem-solving dialog.\n   When an agreement has been reached,\
    \ one solution is posted for every\n   pair.\n   MathMagic has received wide ideological\
    \ acceptance by hundreds of past\n   FidoNet users because it addresses most of\
    \ the National Council of\n   Teachers of Mathematics standards. A modified format\
    \ has now expanded\n   into the Internet and is available via regular e-mail or\
    \ via the World\n   Wide Web (WWW).\n   Who can participate?\n   K-12 teachers\
    \ and students, but higher education teachers, librarians,\n   technology coordinators,\
    \ computer teachers, and even home-schoolers\n   are joining to act as facilitators.\n\
    \   What is needed?\n   Any teacher with access to electronic mail via the Internet\
    \ can\n   participate. Several net service providers and most of the commercial\n\

    \   One of the better known works of architecture of the Roman Empire was\n  \
    \ the Coliseum. For a few months, at its maximum splendor (before the\n   senate\
    \ began cutting its funding... yes, old problem) there stood an\n   Imperial Roman\
    \ Guard in each of its 1000 arches. Imagine the splendor!\n   (Not too cool if\
    \ you were the entertainment.)\n   The first budget conscious cut called for the\
    \ removal of every other\n   Imperial Guard. Imagine, one stayed, the next went.\
    \ The second senate\n   cut called for the removal of every third guard (from\
    \ the original\n   count). So, the order went out that guards of gate 1 and gate\
    \ 2 (if\n   there was one) could stay, while guard of gate 3 (and every other\n\
    \   third one) had to go...  Naturally, what the senate was doing was\n   getting\
    \ rid of some guards, but also getting the credit for a lot of\n   \"cuts\" of\
    \ gates that had no guard.\n   The \"cuts\" continued number after number, until\
    \ a diligent member of\n   the opposition party cried foul. He said, \"Only some\
    \ of the cuts are\n   actually getting rid of guards. A lot of them are not!\"\
    \ Can you build\n   an argument for this senator?\n   Also, if you were a Roman\
    \ Imperial Guard that every week had to choose\n   a different gate you had to\
    \ look after (and run the risk of loosing\n   your job), which gates would be\
    \ your choice?\n   ------------------\n   Good luck MrH\n   ------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \   Hi,\n   Our teachers have been doing K12 projects over the Internet for the\n\
    \   past 12 years.\n   There is NO CHARGE for schools to participate in the projects.\
    \ Global\n   SchoolNet organizes, manages, and facilitates collaborative learning\n\
    \   projects for schools with any level of connectivity . . . from email\n   only\
    \ . . . to desktop videoconferencing.\n   To access these projects go to:\n  \

    \   ---------------------------------\n   The Global Schoolhouse (Featuring Desktop\
    \ Video-Conferencing)\n   Today's \"school of the future\" uses the most powerful\
    \ Internet tools,\n   including live video, to link K12 classrooms to their communities\
    \ and\n   to other children around the world.\n   CALREN: Building the California\
    \ Global Schoolhouse\n   Education leader (Global SchoolNet) partners with business\
    \ leader\n   (Aldea Communications) to discover and document how schools,\n  \
    \ businesses, and the community can network to share resources.\n   CyberStars:\
    \ Number Ones of Tomorrow\n   For the first time ever, children around the globe\
    \ can share their\n   musical talents with the world via the Internet.\n   PAACE:\
    \ Personal Achievement And Career Awareness\n   Students learn and practice important\
    \ career skills, including those\n   dealing with education, attitude, manners,\
    \ grooming, and fashion.\n   Scientist-on-Tap\n   Scientists from the Jet Propulsion\
    \ Laboratory demonstrate the power of\n   distance learning, by interacting with\
    \ students around world, from the\n   comfort of their own offices!\n   Projects\
    \ that Require Email Access Only\n   --------------------------------------\n\
    \   Ask a Geologist (AAG)\n   Have you ever wondered about why California has\
    \ so many earthquakes\n   and New York does not? Why is there so much oil in Texas\
    \ but not in\n   Wisconsin?  What are the deepest canyons in the United States?\
    \ (The\n   answer might surprise you!) While the answers to many of these\n  \
    \ questions might be as close as an encyclopedia, some questions are\n   difficult\
    \ to answer without checking many sources. Beginning Monday,\n   October 3, 1994,\
    \ the USGS will offer a new, experimental Internet\n   service - Ask-A-Geologist.\
    \  General questions on earth sciences may be\n   sent by electronic mail\n  \
    \ Family Tree-Mail: Language Translation\n   In this pilot project, children use\
    \ Globalink's language translation\n   software to share family histories via\
    \ email in their native languages\n   of Spanish, French, German, and Italian.\n\
    \   Field Trips\n   Join other classes on their live field trips. In turn, you\
    \ take other\n   classes with you when you visit local places of interest. Our\n\
    \   FIELDTRIPS-L mailing list manages this \"exchange\" of classroom field\n \
    \  trips and excursions.\n   Geogame\n   This perennially favorite project will\
    \ excite your students as they\n   immerse themselves in atlases, maps, almanacs,\
    \ and other references in\n   order to solve a geography puzzle. Your students\
    \ help create the\n   puzzle by answering 8 questions about your community: latitude,\n\
    \   typical weather, land formations, time zone, points of interest, etc.\n  \
    \ We combine their responses with other classes to create a geography\n   puzzle\
    \ your students will love to solve. A simple first project for\n   beginning telecommunicators.\n\
    \   Global Grocery List\n   Your students visit their local grocery stores and\
    \ record the prices\n   of items on the grocery list, then share their prices\
    \ with other\n   participating classes all over the world. The result is a growing\n\
    \   table of current, peer-collected data that can be used in math, social\n \
    \  studies, science, and health classes (and others). This project is\n   especially\
    \ good for telecomputing beginners: it has very little\n   structure and no timeline.\n\
    \   Jane Goodall Institute\n   Students learn about the interconnectedness of\
    \ all life on earth as\n   they observe the world around them and become involved\
    \ in\n   environmental and humanitarian issues. Explore Gombe and Kibira\n   National\
    \ Parks, ChimpanZoo, and the Roots & Shoots Program.\n   The Jason Project\n \
    \  The Jason Project brings the thrill of exploration and discovery live\n   to\
    \ students around the world as they participate in an amazing\n   electronic field\
    \ trip. In 1995 they trekked to Hawaii to study\n   volcanoes. The Global SchoolNet\
    \ Foundation manages the Jason Project\n   Listservs and features them in our\
    \ Global SCHLnet Newsgroup Service.\n   LOGO Foundation\n   The Logo Foundation,\
    \ in cooperation with the Global SchoolNet\n   Foundation, is now managing a Logo\
    \ listserv discussion group available\n   to anybody on the Internet.\n   Newsday\n\
    \   Your students write articles and post them on the Newsday Newswire for\n \
    \  the whole world to see! Then they read and choose articles from other\n   schools\
    \ to download and include in their own newspaper! Finally... you\n   share your\
    \ newspaper with other classes... and they in turn share\n   theirs with you.\
    \  Your students' reading and writing skills will\n   improve while they learn\
    \ about current local, national, and global\n   issues.\n   Where on the Globe\

    \   Example Five: Professional Development\n   --------------------------------------\n\
    \          THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND ANNOUNCES \"DISASTER IN THE CLASSROOM\"\n \
    \         A *LIVE* TELEVISION PROGRAM TO ILLUSTRATE USES OF REAL-TIME\n      \
    \    WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMAGERY IN K-12 EDUCATION\n   Beginning in September\
    \ 1995, Professor Perry Samson, University of\n   Michigan professor and Director\
    \ of the Weather Underground, will host\n   an innovative, biweekly series of\
    \ live, interactive, television shows\n   aimed at teachers, administrators, and\
    \ parents interested in K-12\n   education, Internet resources, and the use of\
    \ real-time weather\n   information in science.  Aimed specifically at the professional\n\
    \   development of teachers, the programs create a model for teachers to\n   carry\
    \ back into their classroom, a model that promotes project-based\n   student centered\
    \ learning environments using new technology and\n   science ideas creatively.\n\
    \   The programs, interactive in design, allow participants to ask\n   questions\
    \ and respond to information through a simultaneous e-mail\n   dialogue. A strength\
    \ in the design of this series is its ability to\n   allow an interactive discussion\
    \ of environmental issues (severe\n   weather, snowstorms, droughts, earthquakes,\
    \ volcanic activity , El\n   Nino, etc.) in a timely manner, matching current\
    \ news items to\n   science activities. The programs in the virtual classroom\
    \ series are\n   uplinked to a satellite from the University of Michigan.  Teachers,\n\
    \   administrators, parents or students can view the class either on\n   their\
    \ own or in groups.  Participants will be encouraged to use their\n   computer\
    \ and modem to log into our server during the show.  This\n   interactive virtual\
    \ classroom will allow participants to pose or\n   answer questions live (or after\
    \ the show).\n   Navigation on the Internet and pointers to information specific\
    \ to\n   the science curriculum ideas presented on the show are emphasized and\n\
    \   made available to teachers for use in their classrooms.  Participants\n  \
    \ are shown where on the Internet to find imagery and activities\n   relevant\
    \ to the topics discussed and are lead through a discussion of\n   new methods\
    \ to utilize these data in their classroom activities.\n   Example activities\
    \ utilizing current weather, climate and\n   environmental conditions are demonstrated.\n\
    \   If you are interested in participating in this series from your home\n   or\
    \ school and would like to receive graduate credit for it, please\n   contact:\n\
