  - "1. Abstract\n   When dealing with large amounts of users, messages and geographically\n
    \  dispersed IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers, it is often desirable to\n   distribute
    messages amongst different servers within an organization.\n   For example an
    administrator may choose to store user's personal\n   mailboxes on a local IMAP4
    server, while storing shared mailboxes\n   remotely on another server.  This type
    of configuration is common\n   when it is uneconomical to store all data centrally
    due to limited\n   bandwidth or disk resources.\n   Mailbox referrals allow clients
    to seamlessly access mailboxes that\n   are distributed across several IMAP4 servers.\n
    \  A referral mechanism can provide efficiencies over the alternative\n   \"proxy
    method\", in which the local IMAP4 server contacts the remote\n   server on behalf
    of the client, and then transfers the data from the\n   remote server to itself,
    and then on to the client.  The referral\n   mechanism's direct client connection
    to the remote server is often a\n   more efficient use of bandwidth, and does
    not require the local\n   server to impersonate the client when authenticating
    to the remote\n   server.\n"

  - "3. Introduction and Overview\n   IMAP4 servers that support this extension MUST
    list the keyword\n   MAILBOX-REFERRALS in their CAPABILITY response.  No client
    action is\n   needed to invoke the MAILBOX-REFERRALS capability in a server.\n
    \  A MAILBOX-REFERRALS capable IMAP4 server MUST NOT return referrals\n   that
    result in a referrals loop.\n   A referral response consists of a tagged NO response
    and a REFERRAL\n   response code.  The REFERRAL response code MUST contain as
    an\n   argument a one or more valid URLs separated by a space as defined in\n
    \  [RFC-1738]. If a server replies with multiple URLs for a particular\n   object,
    they MUST all be of the same type. In this case, the URL MUST\n   be an IMAP URL
    as defined in [RFC-2192].  A client that supports the\n   REFERRALS extension
    MUST be prepared for a URL of any type, but it\n   need only be able to process
    IMAP URLs.\n   A server MAY respond with multiple IMAP mailbox referrals if there
    is\n   more than one replica of the mailbox.  This allows the implementation\n
    \  of a load balancing or failover scheme. How a server keeps multiple\n   replicas
    of a mailbox in sync is not addressed by this document.\n   If the server has
    a preferred order in which the client should\n   attempt to access the URLs, the
    preferred URL SHOULD be listed in the\n   first, with the remaining URLs presented
    in descending order of\n   preference.  If multiple referrals are given for a
    mailbox, a server\n   should be aware that there are synchronization issues for
    a client if\n   the UIDVALIDITY of the referred mailboxes are different.\n   An
    IMAP mailbox referral may be given in response to an IMAP command\n   that specifies
    a mailbox as an argument.\n   Example:\n      A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/REMOTE]Remote
    Mailbox\n   NOTE: user;AUTH=* is specified as required by [RFC-2192] to avoid
    a\n   client falling back to anonymous login.\n   Remote mailboxes and their inferiors,
    that are accessible only via\n   referrals SHOULD NOT appear in LIST and LSUB
    responses issued against\n   the user's home server.  They MUST appear in RLIST
    and RLSUB\n   responses issued against the user's home server. Hierarchy referrals,\n
    \  in which a client would be required to connect to the remote server\n   to
    issue a LIST to discover the inferiors of a mailbox are not\n   addressed in this
    document.\n   For example, if shared mailboxes were only accessible via referrals\n
    \  on a remote server, a RLIST \"\" \"#SHARED/%\" command would return the\n   same
    response if issued against the user's home server or the remote\n   server.\n
    \  Note: Mailboxes that are available on the user's home server do not\n   need
    to be available on the remote server.  In addition, there may be\n   additional
    mailboxes available on the remote server, but they will\n   not accessible to
    the client via referrals unless they appear in the\n   LIST response to the RLIST
    command against the user's home server.\n   A MAILBOX-REFERRALS capable client
    will issue the RLIST and RLSUB\n   commands in lieu of LIST and LSUB.  The RLIST
    and RLSUB commands\n   behave identically to their LIST and LSUB counterparts,
    except remote\n   mailboxes are returned in addition to local mailboxes in the
    LIST and\n   LSUB responses.  This avoids displaying to a non MAILBOX-REFERRALS\n
    \  enabled client inaccessible remote mailboxes.\n"

    - "4.1. SELECT, EXAMINE, DELETE, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, STATUS and APPEND\n     Referrals\n
      \  An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the SELECT, EXAMINE, DELETE,\n   SUBSCRIBE,
      UNSUBSCRIBE, STATUS or APPEND command with one or more\n   IMAP mailbox referrals
      to indicate to the client that the mailbox is\n   hosted on a remote server.\n
      \  When a client processes an IMAP mailbox referral, it will open a new\n   connection
      or use an existing connection to the remote server so that\n   it is able to
      issue the commands necessary to process the remote\n   mailbox.\n   Example:
      \ <IMAP4 connection to home server>\n      C: A001 DELETE \"SHARED/FOO\"\n      S:
      A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/SHARED/FOO]\n             Remote

    - "4.2. CREATE Referrals\n   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the CREATE command
      with one or more\n   IMAP mailbox referrals, if it wishes to direct the client
      to issue\n   the CREATE against another server.  The server can employ any means,\n
      \  such as examining the hierarchy of the specified mailbox name, in\n   determining
      which server the mailbox should be created on.\n   Example:\n      C: A001 CREATE
      \"SHARED/FOO\"\n      S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/SHARED/FOO]\n
      \        Mailbox should be created on remote server\n   Alternatively, because
      a home server is required to maintain a\n   listing of referred remote mailboxes,
      a server MAY allow the creation\n   of a mailbox that will ultimately reside
      on a remote server against\n   the home server, and provide referrals on subsequent
      commands that\n   manipulate the mailbox.\n   Example:\n      C: A001 CREATE
      \"SHARED/FOO\"\n      S: A001 OK CREATE succeeded\n      C: A002 SELECT \"SHARED/FOO\"\n
      \     S: A002 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/SHARED/FOO]\n         Remote
      mailbox.  Try SERVER2\n"

    - "4.3. RENAME Referrals\n   An IMAP4 server MAY respond to the RENAME command
      with one or more\n   pairs of IMAP mailbox referrals.  In each pair of IMAP
      mailbox\n   referrals, the first one is an URL to the existing mailbox name
      and\n   the second is an URL to the requested new mailbox name.\n   If within
      an IMAP mailbox referral pair, the existing and new mailbox\n   URLs are on
      different servers, the remote servers are unable to\n   perform the RENAME operation.
      \  To achieve the same behavior of\n   server RENAME, the client MAY issue the
      constituent CREATE, FETCH,\n   APPEND, and DELETE commands against both servers.\n
      \  If within an IMAP mailbox referral pair, the existing and new mailbox\n   URLs
      are on the same server it is an indication that the currently\n   connected
      server is unable to perform the operation.  The client can\n   simply re-issue
      the RENAME command on the remote server.\n   Example:\n      C: A001 RENAME
      FOO BAR\n      S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER1/FOO\n              IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/BAR]
      Unable to rename mailbox\n              across servers\n   Since the existing
      and new mailbox names are on different servers,\n   the client would be required
      to make a connection to both servers and\n   issue the constituent commands
      require to achieve the RENAME.\n   Example:\n      C: A001 RENAME FOO BAR\n
      \     S: A001 NO [REFERRAL IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/FOO\n              IMAP://user;AUTH=*@SERVER2/BAR]
      Unable to rename mailbox\n              located on SERVER2\n   Since both the
      existing and new mailbox are on the same remote\n   server, the client can simply
      make a connection to the remote server\n   and re-issue the RENAME command.\n"

      COPY, the\n   client MAY issue the constituent FETCH and APPEND commands against\n

    makes\n   detection of the intrusion easier.\n"
