    \   [RFC2141], as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution\n   and\
    \ use in Internet applications ([RFC2168, RFC2169]). The whole\n   rests on the\
    \ concept of individual \"namespaces\" within the URN\n   structure.  Apart from\
    \  proof-of-concept namespaces, the use of\n   existing identifiers in URNs has\
    \ been discussed ([RFC2288]), and this\n   document lays out general definitions\
    \ of and mechanisms for\n   establishing URN \"namespaces\".\n"

  - "1.0 Introduction\n   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are resource identifiers with\
    \ the\n   specific requirements for enabling location independent\n   identification\
    \ of a resource, as well as longevity of reference.\n   There are 2 assumptions\
    \ that are key to this document:\n   Assumption #1:\n      Assignment of a URN\
    \ is a managed process.\n      I.e., not all strings that conform to URN syntax\
    \ are necessarily\n      valid URNs.  A URN is assigned according to the rules\
    \ of a\n      particular namespace (in terms of syntax, semantics, and process).\n\
    \   Assumption #2:\n      The space of URN namespaces is managed.\n      I.e.,\
    \ not all syntactically correct URN namespaces (per the URN\n      syntax definition)\
    \  are valid URN namespaces.  A URN namespace\n      must have a recognized definition\
    \ in order to be valid.\n   The purpose of this document is to outline a mechanism\
    \ and provide a\n   template for explicit namespace definition, along with the\
    \ mechanism\n   for associating an identifier (called a \"Namespace ID\", or NID)\
    \ which\n   is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, IANA.\n\
    \   Note that this document restricts itself to the description of\n   processes\
    \ for the creation of URN namespaces.  If \"resolution\" of any\n   so-created\
    \ URN identifiers is desired, a separate process of\n   registration in a global\
    \ NID directory, such as that provided by the\n   NAPTR system [RFC2168], is necessary.\
    \  See [NAPTR-REG] for\n   information on obtaining registration in the NAPTR\
    \ global NID\n   directory.\n"
- title: 2.0 What is a URN Namespace?
  contents:
  - "2.0 What is a URN Namespace?\n   For the purposes of URNs, a \"namespace\" is\
    \ a collection of uniquely-\n   assigned identifiers.  A URN namespace itself\
    \ has an identifier in\n   order to\n      - ensure global uniqueness of URNs\n\
    \      - (where desired) provide a cue for the structure of the\n        identifier\n\
    \   For example, ISBNs and ISSNs are both collections of identifiers used\n  \
    \ in the traditional publishing world; while there may be some number\n   (or\
    \ numbers) that is both a valid ISBN identifier and ISSN\n   identifier, using\
    \ different designators for the two collections\n   ensures that no two URNs will\
    \ be the same for different resources.\n   The development of an identifier structure,\
    \ and thereby a collection\n   of identifiers, is a process that is inherently\
    \ dependent on the\n   requirements of the community defining the identifier,\
    \ how they will\n   be assigned, and the uses to which they will be put.  All\
    \ of these\n   issues are specific to the individual community seeking to define\
    \ a\n   namespace (e.g., publishing community, association of booksellers,\n \
    \  protocol developers, etc); they are beyond the scope of the IETF URN\n   work.\n\
    \   This document outlines the processes by which a collection of\n   identifiers\
    \ satisfying certain constraints (uniqueness of assignment,\n   etc) can become\
    \ a bona fide URN namespace by obtaining a NID.  In a\n   nutshell, a template\
    \ for the definition of the namespace is completed\n   for deposit with IANA,\
    \ and a NID is assigned.  The details of the\n   process and possibilities for\
    \ NID strings are outlined below; first,\n   a template for the definition is\
    \ provided.\n"
- title: 3.0 URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "3.0 URN Namespace Definition Template\n   Definition of a URN namespace is accomplished\
    \ by completing the\n   following information template.  Apart from providing\
    \ a mechanism for\n   disclosing structure of the URN namespace, this information\
    \ is\n   designed to be useful for\n      - entities seeking to have a URN assigned\
    \ in a namespace (if\n        applicable)\n      - entities seeking to provide\
    \ URN resolvers for a namespace (if\n        applicable)\n   This is particularly\
    \ important for communities evaluating the\n   possibility of using a portion\
    \ of an existing URN namespace rather\n   than creating their own.\n   Information\
    \ in the template is as follows:\n   Namespace ID:\n      Assigned by IANA.  In\
    \ some contexts, a particular one may be\n      requested (see below).\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n      This is information to identify the particular version of\n\
    \      registration information:\n      - registration version number: starting\
    \ with 1, incrementing by 1\n        with each new version\n      - registration\
    \ date: date submitted to the IANA, using the format\n            YYYY-MM-DD\n\
    \        as outlined in [ISO8601].\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n\
    \      Required: Name and e-mail address.\n      Recommended:  Affiliation, address,\
    \ etc.\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      This section should outline\
    \ any structural features of identifiers\n      in this namespace.  At the very\
    \ least, this description may be\n      used to introduce terminology used in\
    \ other sections.  This\n      structure may also be used for determining realistic\n\
    \      caching/shortcuts approaches; suitable caveats should be provided.\n  \
    \    If there are any specific character encoding rules (e.g., which\n      character\
    \ should always be used for single-quotes), these should\n      be listed here.\n\
    \      Answers might include, but are not limited to:\n      - the structure is\
    \ opaque (no exposition) - a regular expression\n        for parsing the identifier\
    \ into components, including naming\n        authorities\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      This section should list any RFCs, standards, or other\
    \ published\n      documentation that defines or explains all or part of the\n\
    \      namespace structure.\n      Answers might include, but are not limited\
    \ to:\n      - RFCs outlining syntax of the namespace\n      - Other of the defining\
    \ community's (e.g., ISO) documents\n        outlining syntax of the identifiers\
    \ in the namespace\n      - Explanatory material introducing the namespace\n \
    \  Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n   This section should address the requirement\
    \ that URN identifiers be\n   assigned uniquely -- they are assigned to at most\
    \ one resource, and\n   are not reassigned.\n   (Note that the definition of \"\
    resource\" is fairly broad; for example,\n   information on \"Today's Weather\"\
    \ might be considered a single\n   resource, although the content is dynamic.)\n\
    \   Possible answers include, but are not limited to:\n      - exposition of the\
    \ structure of the identifiers, and partitioning\n        of the space of identifiers\
    \ amongst assignment authorities which\n        are individually responsible for\
    \ respecting uniqueness rules\n      - identifiers are assigned sequentially\n\
    \      - information is withheld; the namespace is opaque\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      Although non-reassignment of URN identifiers ensures\
    \ that a URN\n      will persist in identifying a particular resource even after\
    \ the\n      \"lifetime of the resource\", some consideration should be given\
    \ to\n      the persistence of the usability of the URN.  This is particularly\n\
    \      important in the case of URN namespaces providing global\n      resolution.\n\
    \      Possible answers include, but are not limited to:\n      - quality of service\
    \ considerations\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      This section should\
    \ detail the mechanisms and/or authorities for\n      assigning URNs to resources.\
    \  It should make clear whether\n      assignment is completely open, or if limited,\
    \ how to become an\n      assigner of identifiers, and/or get one assigned by\
    \ existing\n      assignment authorities.  Answers could include, but are not\n\
    \      limited to:\n      - assignment is completely open, following a particular\
    \ algorithm\n      - assignment is delegated to authorities recognized by a\n\
    \        particular organization (e.g., the Digital Object Identifier\n      \
    \  Foundation controls the DOI assignment space and its delegation)\n      - assignment\
    \ is completely closed (e.g., for a private\n        organization)\n   Process\
    \ for identifier resolution:\n      If a namespace is intended to be accessible\
    \ for global resolution,\n      it must be registerd in an RDS (Resolution Discovery\
    \ System, see\n      [RFC2276]) such as NAPTR.  Resolution then proceeds according\
    \ to\n      standard URI resolution processes, and the mechanisms of the RDS.\n\
    \      What this section should outline is the requirements for becoming\n   \
    \   a recognized resolver of URNs in this namespace (and being so-\n      listed\
    \ in the RDS registry).\n      Answers may include, but are not limited to:\n\
    \      - the namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant\n     \
    \ - resolution mirroring is completely open, with a mechanism for\n        updating\
    \ an appropriate RDS\n      - resolution is controlled by entities to which assignment\
    \ has\n        been delegated\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      If there\
    \ are particular algorithms for determining equivalence\n      between two identifiers\
    \ in the underlying namespace (hence, in the\n      URN string itself), rules\
    \ can be provided here.\n      Some examples include:\n      - equivalence between\
    \ hyphenated and non-hyphenated groupings in\n        the identifier string\n\
    \      - equivalence between single-quotes and double-quotes\n      - Namespace-defined\
    \ equivalences between specific characters, such\n        as \"character X with\
    \ or without diacritic marks\".\n      Note that these are not normative statements\
    \ for any kind of best\n      practice for handling equivalences between characters;\
    \ they are\n      statements limited to reflecting the namespace's own rules.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      This section should outline any special\
    \ considerations required\n      for conforming with the URN syntax.  This is\
    \ particularly\n      applicable in the case of legacy naming systems that are\
    \ used in\n      the context of URNs.\n      For example, if a namespace is used\
    \ in contexts other than URNs,\n      it may make use of characters that are reserved\
    \ in the URN syntax.\n      This section should flag any such characters, and\
    \ outline\n      necessary mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this\
    \ will\n      be handled by hex encoding the symbol.\n      For example, see the\
    \ section on SICIs in [RFC2288].\n   Validation mechanism:\n      Apart from attempting\
    \ resolution of a URN, a URN namespace may\n      provide mechanism for \"validating\"\
    \ a URN -- i.e., determining\n      whether a given string is currently a validly-assigned\
    \ URN.  For\n      example, even if an ISBN URN namespace is created, it is not\
    \ clear\n      that all ISBNs will translate directly into \"assigned URNs\".\n\
    \      A validation mechanims might be:\n      - a syntax grammar\n      - an\
    \ on-line service\n      - an off-line service\n   Scope:\n      This section\
    \ should outline the scope of the use of the\n      identifiers in this namespace.\
    \  Apart from considerations of\n      private vs. public namespaces, this section\
    \ is critical in\n      evaluating the applicability of a requested NID.  For\
    \ example, a\n      namespace claiming to deal in \"social security numbers\"\
    \ should\n      have a global scope and address all social security number\n \
    \     structures (unlikely).  On the other hand, at a national level, it\n   \
    \   is reasonable to propose a URN namespace for \"this nation's social\n    \
    \  security numbers\".\n"

  contents:
  - "4.0 URN Namespace Registration, Update, and NID Assignment Process\n   Different\
    \ levels of disclosure are expected/defined for namespaces.\n   According to the\
    \ level of open-forum  discussion surrounding the\n   disclosure, a URN namespace\
    \ may be assigned or may request a\n   particular identifier.  The [RFC2434] document\
    \ suggests the need to\n   specify update mechanisms for registrations -- who\
    \ is given the\n   authority to do so, from time to time, and what are the processes.\n\
    \   Since URNs are meant to be persistently useful, few (if any) changes\n   should\
    \ be made to the structural interpretation of URN strings (e.g.,\n   adding or\
    \ removing rules for lexical equivalence that might affect\n   the interpretation\
    \ of URN IDs already assigned).  However, it may be\n   important to introduce\
    \ clarifications, expand the list of authorized\n   URN assigners, etc, over the\
    \ natural course of a namespace's\n   lifetime.  Specific processes are outlined\
    \ below.\n   There are 3 categories of URN namespaces defined here, distinguished\n\
    \   by expected level of service and required procedures for\n   registration.\
    \  Furthermore, registration maintenance procedures vary\n   slightly from one\
    \ category to another.\n      I.   Experimental: These are not explicitly registered\
    \ with IANA.\n           They take the form\n                                \
    \      X-<NID>\n           No provision is made for avoiding collision of experimental\n\
    \           NIDs; they are intended for use within internal or limited\n     \
    \      experimental contexts.\n           As there is no registration, no registration\
    \ maintenance\n           procedures are needed.\n      II.  Informal:  These\
    \ are registered with IANA and are assigned a\n           number sequence as an\
    \ identifier, in the format:\n                                  \"urn-\" <number>\n\
    \           where <number> is chosen by the IANA on a First Come First\n     \
    \      Served basis (see [RFC2434]).\n           Registrants should send a copy\
    \ of the registration template\n           (see section 3.0), duly completed,\
    \ to the\n                               urn-nid@apps.ietf.org\n           mailing\

    \ to the namespace proposal.\n           After suggestions for clarification of\

    \ may be\n           submitted to:\n                                  iana@iana.org\n\
    \           for assignment of a NID.\n           The only restrictions on <number>\
    \ are that it consist\n           strictly of digits and that it not cause the\
    \ NID to exceed\n           length limitations outlined in the URN syntax ([RFC2168]).\n\
    \           Registrations may be updated by the original registrant, or\n    \
    \       an entity designated by the registrant, by updating the\n           registration\
    \ template, submitting it to the discussion list\n           for a further 2 week\
    \ discussion period, and finally\n           resubmitting it to IANA, as described\
    \ above.\n      III. Formal:  These are processed through an RFC review process.\n\
    \           The RFC need not be standards-track.  The template defined in\n  \

    \ the additional\n           constraints that the NID string must\n          \
    \     - not be an already-registered NID\n               - not start with \"x-\"\
    \ (see Type I above)\n               - not start with \"urn-\" (see Type II above)\n\
    \               - not start with \"XY-\", where XY is any combination of 2\n \

    \ 2 letters long\n           NOTE: ALL two-letter combinations, and two-letter\n\

    \   The definition and scoping of rules for\n           allocation of responsibility\
    \ for such namespaces is beyond\n           the scope of this document.\n    \
    \       Registrations may be updated by updating the RFC through\n           standard\
    \ IETF RFC update mechanisms.  Thus, proposals for\n           updates may be\
    \ made by the original authors, other IETF\n           participants, or the IESG.\
    \  In any case, the proposed updated\n           template must be circulated on\

    \   should be of relatively low security profile, however there is always\n  \
    \ the danger of \"spoofing\" and providing mis-information.  Information\n   in\
    \ these declarations should be taken as advisory.\n"
