  - "Abstract\n   This document introduces a hub and spoke multipoint (HSMP) Label\n\
    \   Switched Path (LSP), which allows traffic from root to leaf through\n   point-to-multipoint\
    \ (P2MP) LSPs and also leaf to root along the\n   reverse path.  That means traffic\
    \ entering the HSMP LSP from the\n   application/customer at the root node travels\
    \ downstream to each leaf\n   node, exactly as if it were traveling downstream\
    \ along a P2MP LSP to\n   each leaf node.  Upstream traffic entering the HSMP\
    \ LSP at any leaf\n   node travels upstream along the tree to the root, as if\
    \ it were\n   unicast to the root.  Direct communication among the leaf nodes\
    \ is\n   not allowed.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Path (LSP)\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC6388] allows traffic to transmit from root to several leaf\
    \ nodes,\n   and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) LSP allows traffic from every\n\
    \   node to transmit to every other node.  This document introduces a hub\n  \
    \ and spoke multipoint (HSMP) LSP, which has one root node and one or\n   more\
    \ leaf nodes.  An HSMP LSP allows traffic from root to leaf\n   through downstream\
    \ LSP and also leaf to root along the upstream LSP.\n   That means traffic entering\
    \ the HSMP LSP at the root node travels\n   along the downstream LSP, exactly\
    \ as if it were traveling along a\n   P2MP LSP, and traffic entering the HSMP\
    \ LSP at any other leaf nodes\n   travels along the upstream LSP toward only the\
    \ root node.  The\n   upstream LSP should be thought of as a unicast LSP to the\
    \ root node,\n   except that it follows the reverse direction of the downstream\
    \ LSP,\n   rather than the unicast path based on the routing protocol.  The\n\
    \   combination of upstream LSPs initiated from all leaf nodes forms a\n   multipoint-to-point\
    \ LSP.\n"

- title: 3.  Setting Up HSMP LSP with LDP
  contents:
  - "3.  Setting Up HSMP LSP with LDP\n   An HSMP LSP is similar to MP2MP LSP described\
    \ in [RFC6388], with the\n   difference being that, when the leaf LSRs send traffic\
    \ on the LSP,\n   the traffic is first delivered only to the root node and follows\
    \ the\n   upstream path from the leaf node to the root node.  The root node\n\
    \   then distributes the traffic on the P2MP tree to all of the leaf\n   nodes.\n\
    \   An HSMP LSP consists of a downstream path and upstream path.  The\n   downstream\
    \ path is the same as P2MP LSP, while the upstream path is\n   only from leaf\
    \ to root node, without communication between the leaf\n   nodes themselves. \
    \ The transmission of packets from the root node of\n   an HSMP LSP to the receivers\
    \ (the leaf nodes) is identical to that of\n   a P2MP LSP.  Traffic from a leaf\
    \ node to the root follows the\n   upstream path that is the reverse of the path\
    \ from the root to the\n   leaf.  Unlike an MP2MP LSP, traffic from a leaf node\
    \ does not branch\n   toward other leaf nodes, but it is sent direct to the root\
    \ where it\n   is placed on the P2MP path and distributed to all leaf nodes\n\
    \   including the original sender.\n   To set up the upstream path of an HSMP\
    \ LSP, ordered mode MUST be\n   used.  Ordered mode can guarantee that a leaf\
    \ will start sending\n   packets to the root immediately after the upstream path\
    \ is installed,\n   without being dropped due to an incomplete LSP.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Support for HSMP LSP Setup with LDP\n   An HSMP LSP requires the LDP capabilities\
    \ [RFC5561] for nodes to\n   indicate that they support setup of HSMP LSPs.  An\
    \ implementation\n   supporting the HSMP LSP procedures specified in this document\

  contents:
  - "3.4.  HSMP LSP Label Map\n   This section specifies the procedures for originating\
    \ HSMP Label\n   Mapping messages and processing received HSMP Label Mapping messages\n\
    \   for a particular HSMP LSP.  The procedure of a downstream HSMP LSP is\n  \
    \ similar to that of a downstream MP2MP LSP described in [RFC6388].\n   When LDP\
    \ operates in Ordered Label Distribution Control mode\n   [RFC5036], the upstream\
    \ LSP will be set up by sending an HSMP LSP LDP\n   Label Mapping message with\

    \ from root to leaf node,\n   installing the upstream forwarding table by every\
    \ node along the LSP.\n   The detailed procedure of setting up upstream HSMP LSP\

    \ remainder\n   of this section.\n   All labels discussed here are downstream-assigned\
    \ [RFC5332] except\n   those that are assigned using the procedures described\

    \ <X, Y, L> from LSR D.\n   Z checks whether it has forwarding state for downstream\
    \ <X, Y>.  If\n   not, Z determines its upstream LSR U for <X, Y> as per Section\
    \ 3.3.\n   Using this Label Mapping to update the label forwarding table MUST\n\
    \   NOT be done as long as LSR D is equal to LSR U.  If LSR U is\n   different\
    \ from LSR D, Z will allocate a label L' and install\n   downstream forwarding\
    \ state to swap label L' with label L over\n   interface I associated with LSR\

    \ <In, Ln>,\n   <I, L>}.  If the LSR D is equal to the installed upstream LSR,\
    \ the\n   Label Mapping from LSR D MUST be retained and MUST NOT update the\n\

    \ assigned a label Lu\n   to upstream <X, Y>.  If not, transit node Z waits until\
    \ it receives\n   an HSMP-U Label Mapping <X, Y, Lu> from LSR U.  Once the HSMP-U\

    \ each downstream node.  The forwarding state upstream\n   <X, Y> on node Z will\
    \ be like this: {<Lu'>, <Iu Lu>}.  Iu means the\n   upstream interface over which\

    \ D.\n   Since Z is the root of the tree, Z will not send an HSMP-D Label Map\n\

  contents:
  - "3.7.  Determining Forwarding Interface\n   The upstream and downstream LSPs can\

    \ ensure that the same\n   interface sends traffic by applying some procedures.\
    \  For a network\n   with symmetric IGP cost configuration, the following procedure\
    \ MAY be\n   used.  To determine the downstream interface, LSR U MUST do a lookup\n\
    \   in the unicast routing table to find the best interface and next hop\n   to\
    \ reach LSR D.  If the next hop and interface are also advertised by\n   LSR D\

- title: 4.  HSMP LSP on a LAN
  contents:
  - "4.  HSMP LSP on a LAN\n   The procedure to process the downstream HSMP LSP on\
    \ a LAN is much the\n   same as for a downstream MP2MP LSP as described in Section\
    \ 6.1.1 of\n   [RFC6388].\n   When establishing the downstream path of an HSMP\
    \ LSP, as defined in\n   [RFC6389], a Label Request message for an LSP label is\
    \ sent to the\n   upstream LSR.  The upstream LSR should send a Label Mapping\
    \ message\n   that contains the LSP label for the downstream HSMP FEC and the\n\
    \   upstream LSR context label defined in [RFC5331].  When the LSR\n   forwards\
    \ a packet downstream on one of those LSPs, the packet's top\n   label must be\
    \ the \"upstream LSR context label\" and the packet's\n   second label is the\
    \ \"LSP label\".  The HSMP downstream path will be\n   installed in the context-specific\
    \ forwarding table corresponding to\n   the upstream LSR label.  Packets sent\
    \ by the upstream LSR can be\n   forwarded downstream using this forwarding state\
    \ based on a two-label\n   lookup.\n   The upstream path of an HSMP LSP on a LAN\
    \ is the same as the one on\n   other kinds of links.  That is, the upstream LSR\
    \ must send a Label\n   Mapping message that contains the LSP label for the upstream\
    \ HSMP FEC\n   to the downstream node.  Packets traveling upstream need to be\n\
    \   forwarded in the direction of the root by using the label allocated\n   for\
    \ the upstream HSMP FEC.\n"
- title: 5.  Redundancy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Redundancy Considerations\n   In some scenarios, it is necessary to provide\
    \ two root nodes for\n   redundancy purposes.  One way to implement this is to\
    \ use two\n   independent HSMP LSPs acting as active and standby.  At a given\
    \ time,\n   only one HSMP LSP will be active; the other will be standby.  After\n\
    \   detecting the failure of the active HSMP LSP, the root and leaf nodes\n  \
    \ will switch the traffic to the standby HSMP LSP, which takes on the\n   role\

  contents:
  - "6.  Failure Detection of HSMP LSP\n   The idea of LSP ping for HSMP LSPs could\

    \ enter at the root\n   along a particular downstream path of HSMP LSP and that\
    \ end their\n   MPLS path on the leaf.  The leaf node then sends the LSP Ping\
    \ Echo\n   Reply along the upstream path of HSMP LSP, and it ends on the root\n\
    \   that is the (intended) root node.\n   New sub-TLVs have been assigned by IANA\
    \ in Target FEC Stack TLV and\n   Reverse-path Target FEC Stack TLV to define\
    \ the corresponding HSMP-\n   downstream FEC type and HSMP-upstream FEC type.\
    \  In order to ensure\n   that the leaf node sends the LSP Ping Echo Reply along\
    \ the HSMP\n   upstream path, the R flag (Validate Reverse Path) in the Global\
    \ Flags\n   field defined in [RFC6426] is reused here.\n   The node-processing\
    \ mechanism of LSP Ping Echo Request and Echo Reply\n   for the HSMP LSP is inherited\
    \ from [RFC6425] and Section 3.4 of\n   [RFC6426], except for the following:\n\
    \   1.  The root node sending the LSP Ping Echo Request message for the\n    \
    \   HSMP LSP MUST attach the Target FEC Stack TLV with the HSMP-\n       downstream\
    \ FEC type, and set the R flag to '1' in the Global\n       Flags field.\n   2.\
    \  When the leaf node receives the LSP Ping Echo Request, it MUST\n       send\
    \ the LSP Ping Echo Reply to the associated HSMP upstream\n       path.  The Reverse-path\
    \ Target FEC Stack TLV attached by the leaf\n       node in the Echo Reply message\
    \ SHOULD contain the sub-TLV of the\n       associated HSMP-upstream FEC.\n"
