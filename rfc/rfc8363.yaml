  - "1.  Introduction\n   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing\
    \ (DWDM)\n   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)\n   applications.\
    \  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies\n   used to denote allowed\
    \ nominal central frequencies that may be used\n   for defining applications.\
    \  The channel spacing is the frequency\n   spacing between two allowed nominal\
    \ central frequencies.  All of the\n   wavelengths on a fiber should use different\
    \ central frequencies and\n   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.\n   Fixed-grid\
    \ channel spacing ranges from one of 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50\n   GHz, or 100 GHz\
    \ to integer multiples of 100 GHz.  But [G.694.1] also\n   defines a \"flexible\
    \ grid\", also known as \"flexi-grid\".  The terms\n   \"frequency slot\" (i.e.,\
    \ the frequency range allocated to a specific\n   channel and unavailable to other\
    \ channels within a flexible grid) and\n   \"slot width\" (i.e., the full width\
    \ of a frequency slot in a flexible\n   grid) are used to define a flexible grid.\n\
    \   [RFC7698] defines a framework and the associated control-plane\n   requirements\
    \ for the GMPLS-based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.\n   [RFC6163] provides\
    \ a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element\n   (PCE) control of Wavelength\
    \ Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).\n   [RFC7688] defines the requirements and\
    \ OSPF-TE extensions in support\n   of GMPLS control of a WSON.\n   [RFC7792]\
    \ describes requirements and protocol extensions for\n   signaling to set up Label\
    \ Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks that\n   support the flexi-grid.  This document\
    \ complements [RFC7792] by\n   describing the requirement and extensions for OSPF-TE\
    \ routing in a\n   flexi-grid network.\n   This document complements the efforts\
    \ to provide extensions to the\n   OSPF-TE protocol so as to support GMPLS control\
    \ of flexi-grid\n   networks.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for Flexi-Grid Routing\n   The architecture for establishing\
    \ LSPs in a Spectrum Switched Optical\n   Network (SSON) is described in [RFC7698].\n\
    \   A flexi-grid LSP occupies one or multiple specific frequency slots.\n   The\
    \ process of computing a route and the allocation of a frequency\n   slot is referred\
    \ to as \"RSA\" (Routing and Spectrum Assignment).\n   [RFC7698] describes three\
    \ types of architectural approaches to RSA:\n   combined RSA, separated RSA, and\
    \ routing and distributed SA.  The\n   first two approaches could be called \"\
    centralized SA\" because the\n   spectrum (frequency slot) assignment is performed\
    \ by a single entity\n   before the signaling procedure.\n   In the case of centralized\
    \ SA, the assigned frequency slot is\n   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message\
    \ during the signaling process.\n   In the case of routing and distributed SA,\
    \ only the requested slot\n   width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified in the\
    \ Path message,\n   allowing the involved network elements to select the frequency\
    \ slot\n   to be used.\n   If the capability of switching or converting the whole\
    \ optical\n   spectrum allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at\n\
    \   nodes along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical\n   \"\
    Spectrum Continuity Constraint\", as described in [RFC7698].\n   The remainder\
    \ of this section states the additional extensions on the\n   routing protocols\
    \ in a flexi-grid network.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Available Frequency Ranges
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Available Frequency Ranges\n   In the case of flexi-grids, the central\
    \ frequency steps from 193.1\n   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity.  The calculation\
    \ method of central\n   frequency and the frequency slot width of a frequency\
    \ slot are\n   defined in [G.694.1], i.e., by using nominal central frequency\
    \ n and\n   the slot width m.\n   On a DWDM link, the allocated or in-use frequency\
    \ slots do not\n   overlap with each other.  However, the border frequencies of\
    \ two\n   frequency slots may be the same frequency, i.e., the upper bound of\
    \ a\n   frequency slot and the lower bound of the directly adjacent frequency\n\

    \ Slot width = 50 GHz\n                  Figure 1: Two Frequency Slots on a Link\n\
    \   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link.  The highest\n   frequency\
    \ of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency\n   of slot 2.  In\
    \ this example, it means that the frequency range from\n   n=-2 to n=10 is unavailable\
    \ to other flexi-grid LSPs.  Available\n   central frequencies are advertised\
    \ for m=1, which means that for an\n   available central frequency n, the frequency\
    \ slot from central\n   frequency n-1 to central frequency n+1 is available.\n\
    \   Hence, in order to clearly show which frequency slots are available\n   and\
    \ can be used for LSP establishment and which frequency slots are\n   unavailable,\
    \ the availability of frequency slots is advertised by the\n   routing protocol\
    \ for the flexi-grid DWDM links.  A set of non-\n   overlapping available frequency\
    \ ranges is disseminated in order to\n   allow efficient resource management of\
    \ flexi-grid DWDM links and RSA\n   procedures, which are described in Section\
    \ 4.8 of [RFC7698].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Application Compliance Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Application Compliance Considerations\n   As described in [G.694.1], devices\
    \ or applications that make use of\n   the flexi-grid may not be capable of supporting\
    \ every possible slot\n   width or position (i.e., central frequency).  In other\
    \ words,\n   applications or implementations may be defined where only a subset\
    \ of\n   the possible slot widths and positions are required to be supported.\n\
    \   For example, an application could be defined where the nominal\n   central\
    \ frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values\n   of n that are\
    \ even) and the same application only requires slot\n   widths as a multiple of\
    \ 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that\n   are even).\n   Hence, in order\
    \ to support all possible applications and\n   implementations, the following\
    \ information SHOULD be advertised for a\n   flexi-grid DWDM link:\n   o  Channel\
    \ Spacing (C.S.): as defined in [RFC7699] for flexi-grid, is\n      set to 5 to\
    \ denote 6.25 GHz.\n   o  Central frequency granularity: a multiplier of C.S.\n\
    \   o  Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 2*C.S.\n   o  Slot width range:\
    \ two multipliers of the slot width granularity,\n      each indicating the minimal\
    \ and maximal slot width supported by a\n      port, respectively.\n   The combination\
    \ of slot width range and slot width granularity can be\n   used to determine\
    \ the slot widths set supported by a port.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Comparison with Fixed-Grid DWDM Links\n   In the case of fixed-grid DWDM\
    \ links, each wavelength has a\n   predefined central frequency.  Each wavelength\
    \ maps to a predefined\n   central frequency, and the usable frequency range is\
    \ implicit by the\n   channel spacing.  All the wavelengths on a DWDM link can\
    \ be\n   identified with an identifier that mainly conveys its central\n   frequency\
    \ as the label defined in [RFC6205]; the status of the\n   wavelengths (available\
    \ or not) can be advertised through a routing\n   protocol.\n   Figure 2 shows\
    \ a link that supports a fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel\n   spacing.  The central\
    \ frequencies of the wavelengths are predefined\n   by values of \"n\", and each\

    \         with 50 GHz Channel Spacing\n   Unlike the fixed-grid DWDM links, on\
    \ a flexi-grid DWDM link, the slot\n   width of the frequency slot is flexible,\
    \ as described in Section 3.1.\n   That is, the value of m in the following formula\
    \ from [G.694.1] is\n   uncertain before a frequency slot is actually allocated\
    \ for a flexi-\n   grid LSP.\n                Slot Width (in GHz) = 12.5GHz *\
    \ m\n   For this reason, the available frequency slots (or ranges) are\n   advertised\
    \ for a flexi-grid DWDM link instead of the specific\n   \"wavelength\" points\
    \ that are sufficient for a fixed-grid link.\n   Moreover, this advertisement\
    \ is represented by the combination of\n   central frequency granularity and slot\
    \ width granularity.\n"

    \   using Opaque Link State Advertisements (LSAs) [RFC3630] in the case\n   of\
    \ OSPF-TE [RFC4203] (refer to Section 6.2 of [RFC6163]).  In the\n   flexi-grid\
    \ case, the available frequency ranges, instead of the\n   specific \"wavelengths\"\
