- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the IETF has grown, the process and the community have\
    \ become more\n   careful about defining the rights relating to copying documents\
    \ that\n   are granted by authors to the community, and the corresponding rights\n\
    \   that are granted by the community to readers and users of these\n   documents.\
    \  The creation of the IETF Trust [RFC4371], with its\n   special role in managing\
    \ intellectual property rights (IPR), has also\n   increased the need to be explicit\
    \ about these rights and decisions.\n   This document defines the copyright procedures\
    \ for RFC IAB stream\n   documents.  It parallels the procedures for IETF-produced\
    \ documents\n   defined in RFC 5377 [RFC5377] and RFC 5378 [RFC5378].\n   In summary,\
    \ submissions in the IAB stream use the same submission\n   procedures and mechanisms\
    \ that are defined in RFC 5378, and hence\n   require the same \"incoming rights\"\
    \ as IETF-stream documents.  This\n   document provides advice to the Trustees\
    \ of the IETF Trust on\n   \"outgoing\" rights to be granted to readers and users\
    \ of IAB stream\n   documents, and it explicitly requests the IETF Trust to manage\
    \ the\n   rights in accordance with this advice.\n   This document also specifies\
    \ the policies with regard to the\n   disclosure of Patents and Trademarks that\
    \ may be relevant to a\n   submission intended for the IAB stream.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The concept of RFC streams in general, and the IAB stream\
    \ in\n   particular, is described in Section 5 of RFC 4844 [RFC4844].\n   Section\
    \ 8 of RFC 4846 [RFC4846] presented the copyright rules for the\n   Independent\
    \ Submission stream.  The present document is intended to\n   be fully consistent\
    \ with that section, and to update it by clarifying\n   the formal procedures\
    \ that the IETF Trust will use to effect those\n   rules.  In particular, it is\
    \ the intention of this document to make\n   the copyright rules for IAB stream\
    \ documents identical to those for\n   Independent Submission stream documents.\n"
- title: 3.  Goals
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals\n   The goal of the IAB stream of RFCs is to publish information from\
    \ the\n   IAB to the Internet community.  Consistent with the principle stated\n\
    \   for the Independent Submission stream in Section 8 of RFC 4846, this\n   objective\
    \ will best be met with a liberal copyright policy on IAB\n   stream documents.\
    \  Therefore, the IAB stream policy is to allow any\n   individual reading such\
    \ documents to use the content thereof in any\n   manner.  The only restriction\
    \ is that proper credit (\"attribution\")\n   must be given.  Lawyers describe\
    \ this liberal policy by saying that\n   this stream normally permits \"unlimited\
    \ derivative works\".  The only\n   additional restriction for the use of IAB\
    \ documents is that proper\n   credit (\"attribution\") must be given.\n   However,\
    \ for a small subset of documents published as IAB stream\n   documents, such\
    \ as output from other standards bodies, it is not\n   reasonable to permit unlimited\
    \ derivative works.  In such cases,\n   authors are permitted to request that\
    \ the published IAB stream\n   documents permit no derivative works.\n   Note\
    \ also that this unlimited derivative works policy applies to all\n   parts of\
    \ an IAB stream document, including any code.  Therefore, no\n   separate licensing\
    \ procedure is required for extracting and adapting\n   code that is contained\
    \ in an IAB stream document submitted under the\n   (preferred) unlimited derivative\
    \ works terms.  On the other hand,\n   code may not be extracted and adapted from\
    \ IAB stream documents\n   submitted under the \"no derivative works\" terms.\n"
- title: 4.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material
  contents:
  - "4.  Rules for Submission and Use of Material\n   IAB stream authors will submit\
    \ their material as Internet-Drafts.\n   These drafts will be submitted to, and\
    \ stored in, the IETF Internet-\n   Drafts repository in the same fashion as IETF\
    \ Internet-Drafts.\n   During Internet-Draft submission, authors who intend to\
    \ submit their\n   document for publication in the IAB stream will grant rights\
    \ as\n   described in [RFC5378].  To request that the contribution be\n   published\
    \ as an RFC that permits no derivative works, an author may\n   use the form specified\
    \ for use with RFC 5378.\n   The IETF Trust will publish rules that provide that\
    \ the Trust grants\n   to readers and users of material from IAB stream RFCs the\
    \ right to\n   make unlimited derivative works, unless the RFC specifies that\
    \ no\n   derivative works are permitted.  This will permit anyone to copy,\n \
    \  extract, modify, or otherwise use material from IAB stream RFCs as\n   long\
    \ as suitable attribution is given.\n   Contributors of Internet-Drafts intended\
    \ for the IAB stream will\n   include the appropriate boilerplate defined by the\
    \ IETF Trust.  This\n   boilerplate shall indicate compliance with RFC 5378 and\
    \ shall\n   explicitly indicate either that no derivative works can be based on\n\
    \   the contribution, or, as is preferred, that unlimited derivative\n   works\
    \ may be crafted from the contribution.\n"
- title: 5.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust
  contents:
  - "5.  Procedures Requested of the IETF Trust\n   The IAB requests that the IETF\
    \ Trust and its Trustees assist in\n   meeting the goals and procedures set forth\
    \ in this document.\n   The Trustees are requested to publicly confirm their willingness\
    \ and\n   ability to accept responsibility for the Intellectual Property Rights\n\
    \   for the IAB stream.\n   Specifically, the Trustees are asked to develop the\
    \ necessary\n   boilerplate to enable the suitable marking of documents so that\
    \ the\n   IETF Trust receives the rights as specified in RFC 5378.  These\n  \
    \ procedures need to also allow authors to indicate either no rights to\n   make\
    \ derivative works, or preferentially, the right to make unlimited\n   derivative\
    \ works from the documents.  It is left to the Trust to\n   specify exactly how\
    \ this shall be clearly indicated in each document.\n"
- title: 6.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the IAB Stream
  contents:
  - "6.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the IAB Stream\n   As specified above, contributors\
    \ of documents for the IAB stream are\n   expected to use the IETF Internet-Draft\
    \ process, complying therein\n   with the rules specified in the latest version\
    \ of BCP 9, whose\n   version at the time of writing was [RFC2026].  This includes\
    \ the\n   disclosure of Patent and Trademark issues that are known, or can be\n\
    \   reasonably expected to be known, to the contributor.\n   Disclosure of license\
    \ terms for patents is also requested, as\n   specified in the most recent version\
    \ of BCP 79.  The version of BCP\n   79 at the time of this writing was [RFC3979],\
    \ updated by [RFC4879].\n   The IAB stream has chosen to use the IETF's IPR disclosure\
    \ mechanism,\n   www.ietf.org/ipr/, for this purpose.  The IAB would prefer the\
    \ most\n   liberal terms possible be made available for IAB stream documents.\n\
    \   Terms that do not require fees or licensing are preferable.  Non-\n   discriminatory\
    \ terms are strongly preferred over those that\n   discriminate among users. \
    \ However, although disclosure is required\n   and the IAB may consider disclosures\
    \ and terms in making a decision\n   as to whether to submit a document for publication,\
    \ there are no\n   specific requirements on the licensing terms for intellectual\n\
    \   property related to IAB stream publication.\n"
