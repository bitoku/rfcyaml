  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 4055 specifies conventions for using the RSA Encryption
    Scheme -\n   Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) key transport\n
    \  algorithm in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  It\n   provides
    algorithm identifiers and parameters for RSAES-OAEP.\n   This document updates
    the conventions for RSAES-OAEP parameters in\n   the subjectPublicKeyInfo field
    of an X.509 certificate.  The PKIX WG\n   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) design
    team recommended that Key\n   Derivation Functions (KDFs) should not be constrained
    within a\n   certificate; rather, KDF constraints should be negotiated in\n   protocols
    that need to employ certificates.\n   Only two paragraphs in [RFC4055] discuss
    RSAES-OAEP parameters in\n   X.509 certificates: the second paragraph of Section
    4 and the first\n   paragraph of Section 4.1.  This document only updates these
    two\n   paragraphs.  Section 3 updates the second paragraph in Section 4 of\n
    \  [RFC4055], while Section 4 updates the second paragraph in Section\n   4.1
    of [RFC4055].  \"Old:\" prefaces the text to be replaced and \"New:\"\n   prefaces
    the replacement text.\n   This document also replaces incorrect references to
    the\n   publicKeyAlgorithms field in Section 3 with references to the\n   parameters
    field in the subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm field.\n   Section 3 also rewords
    the second and third paragraphs for clarity.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Changes to Section 3 (Second and Third Paragraphs)\n   This change clarifies
    the placement of RSASSA-PSS-params in the\n   signature, signatureAlgorithm, and
    subjectPublicKeyInfo fields for\n   certification authority (CA) and end-entity
    (EE) certificates.  It\n   also clarifies the placement of RSASSA-PSS-params in
    the\n   signatureAlgorithm field in certificate revocation lists (CRLs).\n   Old:\n
    \  CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSASSA-PSS algorithm\n   identifier
    SHOULD require the presence of parameters in the\n   publicKeyAlgorithms field
    if the cA boolean flag is set in the basic\n   constraints certificate extension.
    \ CAs MAY require that the\n   parameters be present in the publicKeyAlgorithms
    field for end-entity\n   certificates.\n   CAs that use the RSASSA-PSS algorithm
    for signing certificates SHOULD\n   include RSASSA-PSS-params in the subjectPublicKeyInfo
    algorithm\n   parameters in their own certificates.  CAs that use the RSASSA-PSS\n
    \  algorithm for signing certificates or CRLs MUST include RSASSA-PSS-\n   params
    in the signatureAlgorithm parameters in the TBSCertificate or\n   TBSCertList
    structures.\n   New:\n   When the id-RSASSA-PSS object identifier appears in the\n
    \  TBSCertificate or TBSCertList signature algorithm field, then the\n   RSASSA-PSS-params
    structure MUST be included in the TBSCertificate or\n   TBSCertList signature
    parameters field.\n   When the id-RSASSA-PSS object identifier appears in the\n
    \  TBSCertificate subjectPublicKeyInfo algorithm field of CA\n   certificates,
    then the parameters field SHOULD include the RSASSA-\n   PSS-params structure.
    \ When the id-RSASSA-PSS object identifier\n   appears in the TBSCertificate subjectPublicKeyInfo
    algorithm field of\n   EE certificates, then the parameters field MAY include
    the RSASSA-\n   PSS-params structure.\n   All certificates and CRLs signed by
    a CA that supports the id-RSASSA-\n   PSS algorithm MUST include the RSASSA-PSS-params
    in the\n   signatureAlgorithm parameters in Certificate and CertList structures,\n
    \  respectively.\n"
  title: 2.  Changes to Section 3 (Second and Third Paragraphs)
- contents:
  - "3.  Changes to Section 4 (Second Paragraph)\n   This change prohibits the inclusion
    of RSAES-OAEP-params in the\n   subjectPublicKeyInfo field.  This was done because
    a) it does not\n   affect interoperability and b) it aligns with PKIX practice
    to not\n   include limitations on how the public key can be used in\n   subjectPublicKeyInfo.
    \ A poll of implementers was taken and there\n   were no objections to this change
    as it did not affect current\n   implementations.\n   Old:\n   CAs that issue
    certificates with the id-RSAES-OAEP algorithm\n   identifier SHOULD require the
    presence of parameters in the\n   publicKeyAlgorithms field for all certificates.
    \ Entities that use a\n   certificate with a publicKeyAlgorithm value of id-RSA-OAEP
    where the\n   parameters are absent SHOULD use the default set of parameters for\n
    \  RSAES-OAEP-params.  Entities that use a certificate with a\n   publicKeyAlgorithm
    value of rsaEncryption SHOULD use the default set\n   of parameters for RSAES-OAEP-params.\n
    \  New:\n   CAs that issue certificates with the id-RSAES-OAEP algorithm\n   identifier
    MUST NOT include parameters in the subjectPublicKeyInfo\n   algorithm field.\n"
  title: 3.  Changes to Section 4 (Second Paragraph)

  - "4.  Changes to Section 4.1 (First Paragraph)\n   This change prohibits the inclusion
    of parameters in the\n   subjectPublicKeyInfo field.  This was done because a)
    it does not\n   affect interoperability and b) it aligns with PKIX practice to
    not\n   include limitations on how the public key can be used in\n   subjectPublicKeyInfo.

  title: 4.  Changes to Section 4.1 (First Paragraph)
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC4055] apply.\n
    \  If the RSAES-OAEP-params are negotiated, then the negotiation\n   mechanism
    needs to provide integrity for these parameters.  For\n   example, an S/MIME Agent
    can advertise their capabilities in the\n   SMIMECapabilities attribute, which
    is either a signed attribute\n   [RFC5751] or a certificate extension [RFC4262].\n"
