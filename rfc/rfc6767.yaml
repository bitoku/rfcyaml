        Channel Entity (BCE)\n   discovery, using the [G.994.1] handshake (G.hs).
        \ The GBOND-MIB\n   module provides an example of an automatic BCE connection
        to the\n   corresponding Generic Bonding Sub-layer (GBS) ports of a generic\n
        \  G.998 multi-port Central Office (CO) device, using G.hs-based BCE\n   discovery.
        \ Amendment 2 to the ITU-T G.998.2 specification\n   [G.998.2-Amd2] provides
        an alternative optional Bonding Aggregation\n   Control Protocol (BACP) for
        in-service discovery, aggregation, and\n   pair management.\n   The following
        pseudocode gives the same example of the discovery and\n   automatic BCE assignment
        for a multi-GBS G.Bond/Eth CO device, using\n   BACP objects defined in this
        MIB module, as well as the\n   IF-CAP-STACK-MIB [RFC5066] and IF-MIB modules.

    - "4.3.  Relationship to EFM Copper MIB Module\n   The EFM-CU-MIB module [RFC5066]
      defines objects for managing Ethernet\n   in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces
      10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL,\n   as defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2005 [802.3].  These
      interfaces are\n   based on Single-pair High-speed DSL (SHDSL) [G.991.2] and
      Very high\n   speed DSL (VDSL) [G.993.1] technology, respectively, and can be\n
      \  optionally aggregated (bonded).\n   The ITU-T G.998.2 specification extends
      the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61\n   bonding to work over any xDSL technology, providing
      the ability to\n   bond individual channels as well as physical lines.  It also
      allows\n   the use of alternative High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)\n   encapsulation
      instead of the default 64/65-octet encapsulation and\n   adds a new optional
      Bonding Aggregation Control Protocol (BACP) for\n   in-service discovery, aggregation,
      and pair management instead of the\n   default G.hs-based bonding protocol,
      which cannot be used in-service,\n   while the link is 'up'.\n   EFM-CU-MIB
      can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu physical\n   interfaces (PHYs),
      including complete (within the scope of the 802.3\n   standard) management of
      the SHDSL/VDSL lines.  The GBOND-MIB and\n   G9982-MIB modules, on the other
      hand, provide management objects only\n   for the bonding part, leaving the
      management of the individual xDSL\n   interfaces (lines/channels) to the respective
      xDSL-LINE-MIB modules.\n   Therefore, an IEEE 802.3 2BASE-TL/10PASS-TS interface
      can be managed\n   by either combination of the following MIB modules:\n      IF-MIB
      + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + EtherLike-MIB + MAU-MIB + EFM-CU-MIB\n      IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB
      + GBOND-MIB + G9982-MIB +\n      HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB/VDSL-LINE-MIB\n   (The
      EtherLike-MIB, HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB, and VDSL-LINE-MIB modules\n   are found
      in [RFC3635], [RFC4319], and [RFC3728], respectively.)\n   Note also that while
      EFM-CU-MIB relies on the ifMauMediaAvailable\n   object from MAU-MIB [RFC4836]
      for the additional bonded xDSL-specific\n   operational states, GBOND-MIB provides
      these indications via the\n   gBondPortStatFltStatus object, complementing the
      ifOperStatus object\n   from the IF-MIB.\n   Finally, the EFM-CU-MIB does not
      include historical Performance\n   Monitoring (PM), while the GBOND-MIB/G9982-MIB/xDSL-LINE-MIB\n
      \  combination provides full PM functionality for a bonded link and\n   individual
      xDSL lines.\n"

  title: 6.  G.Bond/Ethernet MIB Definitions
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of managed objects defined
    in this MIB module with\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such objects\n   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  Changing of g9982PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.,\n      g9982PortConfTcAdminType)
    may lead to a complete service\n      interruption in cases where the specified
    PTM-TC encapsulation\n      type is not supported by the remote end.\n   o  Changing
    of g9982BceConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.,\n      g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID)
    may lead to preventing a non-bonded\n      BCE from being bonded in any bonding
    group, or false advertisement\n      of bonding eligibility (e.g., between BCEs
    residing on different\n      line cards in an application that does not support
    cross-card\n      bonding).\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively,
    they\n   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and\n
    \  can reveal some aspects of their configuration.\n   It is thus important to
    control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to\n   these objects and possibly to even
    encrypt the values of these\n   objects when sending them over the network via
    SNMP.  These are the\n   tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  g9982PortStatTable - objects in this table (e.g.,\n      g9982PortStatTcOperType)
    provide status information for the G.Bond\n      port, which may aid in deciphering
    of the G.Bond/ETH\n      transmissions.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did
    not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example
    by using IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
    to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB
    module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by
    the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance
    to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy
    via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm
    [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
    Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n
    \  [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior
    to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
    and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"
