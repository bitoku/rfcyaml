- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the Common\n\
    \   Name Resolution Protocol.  Specifically it lays out the syntactic\n   components\
    \ and how those components are used by URI Resolution to\n   find the available\
    \ transports for a CNRP service.  Care should be\n   taken with several of the\
    \ URI components because, while they may look\n   like components found in other\
    \ URI schemes, they often do not act\n   like them.  The \"go\" scheme has more\
    \ in common with the location\n   independent \"news\" scheme than any other URI\
    \ scheme.\n"

- title: 1. Goals
  contents:
  - "1. Goals\n   The two goals of the CNRP [3] URI [1] are to identify both a specific\n\
    \   common-name record at a specific server and to identify a possibly\n   dynamic\
    \ query or entry point into the query process.  Since CNRP\n   requires that the\
    \ ID be a core query term, these two cases can be\n   generalized down to simply\
    \ specifying a query that contains only the\n   ID of the item.\n   On first glance\
    \ it would seem a simple enough exercise to\n   canonicalize the XML encoded query\
    \ and then insert it into the query\n   portion of the URL.  The problem here\
    \ is that, due to the encoding\n   rules, any remotely complex query will quickly\
    \ blow out the URI\n   length limitations.  The suggested solution is to provide\
    \ a\n   simplified query syntax that is a subset of what is available via the\n\
    \   XML.\n"

  - "2. Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [4].\n"

- title: 3.1 General Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.1 General Syntax\n   The CNRP URI comes in two forms.  The first form is for\
    \ talking to a\n   specific server.  The second form is for expressing a query\
    \ that is\n   meant to be sent to several different CNRP services.  The following\n\
    \   two examples are for pedagogical purposes only.  The complete ABNF\n   grammar\
    \ in Section 3.2 is the only authoritative syntax definition.\n   go://[<host>]?[<common-name>]*[;<attribute>=[<type>,]<value>]\n\
    \   and\n   go:<common-name>*[;<attribute>=[<type>,]<value>]\n"

    '
- title: 3.3.1 If There is Only a Server
  contents:
  - "3.3.1 If There is Only a Server\n   In the case where the CNRP URI contains only\
    \ the server production\n   then the URI identifies a given CNRP server, not any\
    \ particular query\n   that is to be done.  A client can assume that this server\
    \ will at\n   least answer the 'servicequery' request.\n"
- title: 3.3.2 If Server is Empty Then server=localhost
  contents:
  - "3.3.2 If Server is Empty Then server=localhost\n   If the 'server' element has\
    \ no value then its value MUST be assumed\n   to be \"localhost\".\n"
- title: 3.3.3 Default Port
  contents:
  - "3.3.3 Default Port\n   CNRP's well known HTTP transport port is 1096.  If the\
    \ port value\n   portion of the server production is not specified then port 1096\n\
    \   SHOULD be used if the client has no prior knowledge about other ports\n  \
    \ or transports that the service may support.\n"
- title: 3.4 Encoding Rules
  contents:
  - "3.4 Encoding Rules\n   The common-name, query parameters, and parameter values\
    \ must be\n   encoded using the UTF-8 encoding scheme [5], and any octet that\
    \ is\n   not one of the permitted characters per the above grammar MUST\n   instead\
    \ be represented by a \"%\" followed by two characters from the\n   <hex> character\
    \ set above.  The two characters give the hexadecimal\n   representation of that\
    \ octet.\n"
- title: 4. Transport Independence
  contents:
  - "4. Transport Independence\n   As stated in the CNRP protocol specification [3],\
    \ CNRP is allowed to\n   be expressed over multiple transport protocols with HTTP\
    \ being\n   mandatory to implement.  In the case where a client attempts to\n\
    \   resolve a CNRP URI and it knows nothing about the service being\n   referenced\
    \ in that URI, then it SHOULD use HTTP on the CNRP default\n   port (1096).\n"
- title: 5. Examples
  contents:
  - "5. Examples\n   go:Mercedes%20Benz\n      This example shows a general query\
    \ for the common-name \"Mercedes\n      Benz\".  The intent is that the query\
    \ should be packaged with any\n      client provided defaults and sent to the\
    \ one or more services that\n      the client has configured to ask.\n   go://?Mercedes%20Benz\n\
    \      This example shows a general query for the common-name \"Mercedes\n   \
    \   Benz\" that is sent to the server running on the 'localhost'.\n   go://cnrp.foo.com?Mercedes%20Benz;geography=US-ga\n\
    \      This example shows a query for the common-name \"Mercedes Benz\" in\n \
    \     the geographic area \"US-ga\" which should be sent to the server\n     \
    \ found at cnrp.foo.com.\n   go://cnrp.foo.org?Martin%20J.%20D%C3%BCrst\n    \
    \  This example includes a UTF-8 character encoded using hex\n      escaping.\
    \  The value encoded is a u-umlaut (a 'u' with two dots\n      over it).  This\
    \ simple query is sent to a server found at\n      cnrp.foo.org with no parameters.\n\
    \   go://cnrp.foo.com?id=5432345\n      Here only an id is given which means that\
    \ his example points\n      directly at a particular common-name record on a particular\n\
    \      server.  This example would probably be found in a link on a web\n    \
    \  page of some type.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security considerations inherent\
    \ in CNRP itself\n   (see the Security Considerations section of RFC 3367 [3]),\
    \ the URI\n   mechanism can also be used to retrieve a URI identifying some other\n\
    \   site by including just the ID and not the common-name being linked\n   to.\
    \  I.e., the user may think he/she is being shown the URI currently\n   mapped\
    \ to the \"BMW\" common-name but in the case where only the ID is\n   used the\
    \ actual common-name is not part of the URI, thus making it\n   possible to use\
    \ a CNRP URI without knowing which common-name it is\n   referring to.\n"
