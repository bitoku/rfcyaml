Abstract RFC 6514 created a space of Tunnel Type code points for a new BGP attribute called the "P Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute".
However, the RFC did not create a corresponding IANA registry.
There now is need to make further code point allocations from this name space.
This document serves to update RFC 6514 in that it creates an IANA registry for that purpose.
In 'BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in
an optional transitive BGP attribute called the "P Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute" is specified.
This BGP attribute uses an octet field to specify the PMSI tunnel type.
RFC 6514 allocates the values 0 7.
There is now a need to make further code point allocations from this name space.
In particular, "Inter Area P2MP Segmented LSPs" [SEAMLESS MCAST] needs to make such an allocation.
However, the RFC did not create an IANA registry for these code points.
This document creates a new IANA registry called "P Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel)
Tunnel Types" for these code points.
The registry is created in the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.
Creating this registry is an update of RFC 6514
This document simply creates an IANA registry from a table in RFC 6514.
Thus, there are no security concerns.
IANA Considerations IANA has created a new registry called "P Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel)
Tunnel Types" in the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.
The allocation policy for values 0x00 to 0xFA is IETF Review [RFC5226].
Values 0xFB to 0xFE are experimental and are not to be assigned.
0xFF is reserved, the status of 0xFF may only be changed through Standards Action [RFC5226].
