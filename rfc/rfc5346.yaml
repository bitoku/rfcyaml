  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM [RFC3761] is a mapping system based on DNS [RFC1034]\
    \ [RFC1035]\n   that converts from an E.164 [E164] number to a domain name using\
    \ the\n   Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) [RFC3403] resource record type.\n \
    \  ENUM is able to store different service types (such as fax, email,\n   homepage,\
    \ SIP, H.323 and so on) for every E.164 number.  It\n   originally focused on\
    \ how end-users could gain access to other end-\n   users' communication contact\
    \ information through the Internet.\n   Recently, discussion on the need to update\
    \ RFC 3761 has begun to\n   ensure that the standard also works in the \"Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM\"\n   scenario, where ENUM provides routing information between carriers.\n\
    \   This resulted in two documents, the updated ENUM specification\n   [RFC3761bis]\
    \ and an Enumservice guide [ENUMSERVICE-GUIDE].\n   When providing VoIP service,\
    \ a VoIP carrier that wants to integrate\n   various protocols typically uses\
    \ a softswitch.  However, such a\n   system is still inefficient for interconnection,\
    \ number portability,\n   and sharing protocol support information among carriers,\
    \ because each\n   softswitch does not have complete end-to-end routing information\
    \ for\n   all carriers.  This information can be stored in DNS, using ENUM.\n\
    \   Therefore, carriers can expect to gain many advantages if they use\n   ENUM\
    \ within the call routing functions of their softswitches.\n   To confirm these\
    \ benefits and to verify the performance of ENUM-\n   enabled softswitches, NIDA\
    \ cooperated with two Korean VoIP service\n   providers for an Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM trial in 2006.  NIDA is a non-\n   profit organization with a mandate to\
    \ manage 2.8.e164.arpa.\n   (representing the +82 country code of Korea).  NIDA\
    \ promotes and\n   facilitates technical cooperation on a national scale between\n\
    \   partners, and this includes ENUM.  During the trial, NIDA provided a\n   centralized\
    \ ENUM DNS to each VoIP service provider for call routing.\n   The data used in\
    \ this Infrastructure trial was also accessible to the\n   public (i.e., it was\
    \ an Internet-based system, rather than a closed\n   scheme).\n"
- title: 2.  Call Routing on Softswitch
  contents:
  - "2.  Call Routing on Softswitch\n   In the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network),\
    \ hardware-based\n   switches predominate.  A softswitch provides similar functionality,\n\
    \   but is implemented on a computer system by software.  It typically\n   has\
    \ to support various signalling protocols (such as SIP [RFC3261],\n   H.323 [H323],\
    \ Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) [RFC3435], and\n   others) to make call\
    \ connections for VoIP service, often on the\n   boundary point between the circuit\
    \ and packet network.\n   To make a call, first of all a softswitch must discover\
    \ routing\n   information.  It has to process the E.164 number that comes from\
    \ a\n   caller through its own routing table.  The goal is to determine how\n\
    \   the call can be routed towards the callee, so that either the call\n   can\
    \ be processed through the softswitch or the caller can connect to\n   the callee\
    \ directly.\n   Today, call routing is often based on a prefix of the dialled\
    \ number.\n   This is used very widely not only for legacy PSTN switches, but\
    \ also\n   for softswitches.  So, if a softswitch exclusively uses ENUM DNS for\n\
    \   call routing, then, in the beginning most of the calls queried to\n   ENUM\
    \ DNS would fail if there are only a small group of carriers\n   provisioning\
    \ data into ENUM.  However, a softswitch will have a\n   higher success rate with\
    \ ENUM DNS as the number of carriers grows,\n   and so the overall percentage\
    \ of numbers provisioned in ENUM\n   increases.  In short, ENUM as a long-term\
    \ solution has obvious\n   benefits, but the problem lies in migrating from today's\
    \ prefix-based\n   routing towards that long-term ENUM-based solution.\n"

  - "3.  Infrastructure ENUM Trial in Korea\n   As described in Section 1, NIDA and\
    \ two VoIP service providers built\n   ENUM-processing modules into their softswitches,\
    \ interconnected these\n   via the IP network, and provisioned their trial users'\
    \ numbers into a\n   centralized ENUM DNS system operated by NIDA.  The carriers\n\
    \   provisioned their E.164 numbers using Extensible Provisioning\n   Protocol\
    \ (EPP) [RFC4114] to a centralized Registration Server (also\n   operated by NIDA).\
    \  Changes to the ENUM data were implemented and\n   updated to the ENUM DNS instantly,\
    \ using DNS Dynamic Update\n   [RFC2136].\n   In the trial, the EPP-based provisioning\
    \ sub-system was developed and\n   operated separately from the carriers' main\
    \ customer provisioning\n   systems and protocols.  It was not integrated, as\
    \ the carriers\n   already operated their own customer provisioning systems that\
    \ were\n   totally different from the EPP-based model, and (as mission-critical\n\

- title: 4.1.  Call Routing Cases for DNS Response Codes
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Call Routing Cases for DNS Response Codes\n   To use ENUM DNS, each softswitch\
    \ needs to have an ENUM module that\n   converts from an E.164 number to the ENUM\
    \ domain name (as defined in\n   RFC 3761) and processes a query to ENUM DNS.\
    \  This ENUM module uses\n   the algorithm specified in RFC 3761.\n   However,\
    \ in the initial stage of ENUM DNS roll-out, ENUM shares call\n   routing information\
    \ from a limited number of carriers.  There is the\n   problem that a softswitch\
    \ can't find all of the call routing\n   information it needs just using ENUM.\
    \  To solve this problem, ENUM-\n   based softswitches have to follow a consistent\
    \ set of rules.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Trial Policies
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Trial Policies\n   As a matter of policy in this trial, all telephone\
    \ numbers in use\n   within an \"ENUM only\" number range (i.e., ones in which\
    \ an endpoint\n   could only be reached via a URI found during an ENUM lookup\
    \ of a\n   telephone number in this range, and for which there was no PSTN Point\n\
    \   of Interconnect) were arranged to return a NAPTR response.  For\n   ranges\
    \ in which there was a PSTN Point of Interconnect, this was not\n   required.\n\
    \   Thus, no data (at all) needed to be provisioned into an associated\n   ENUM\
    \ domain for such a number if it were possible to \"reach\" that\n   number via\
    \ the PSTN, unless there were also an IP-based Point of\n   Interconnect serving\
    \ that number and the serving carrier chose to\n   make this option available.\n\
    \   In those domains in which NAPTRs for ENUM processing were\n   provisioned,\
    \ these NAPTRs were always 'terminal' rules -- non-\n   terminal NAPTRs were not\
    \ used.  If non-terminal NAPTRs were to be\n   provisioned, then the standard\
    \ operation of ENUM processing might\n   have required extra DNS lookups before\
    \ the set of NAPTRs for a\n   telephone number could be evaluated.  The delay\
    \ and indeterminacy\n   this would introduce was not considered acceptable.\n\
    \   The case where a valid URI was present is covered in Section 4.1.2\n   (rule\
    \ 2 A, second point).  The case where an ENUM entry was not\n   provisioned for\
    \ a number that had an active PSTN Point of\n   Interconnect is covered in Section\
    \ 4.1.2 (rule 2 B).\n   For \"ENUM only\" ranges, where a given number in that\
    \ range was in\n   service (i.e., there was an IP-based Point of Interconnect\
    \ to a\n   carrier), a valid SIP or H.323 URI was always provisioned into the\n\
    \   associated ENUM domain.  This is covered in Section 4.1.2 (rule 2 A,\n   second\
    \ point).\n   In such an \"ENUM only\" range, if the number was not in service,\
    \ a TXT\n   record was provisioned but no valid NAPTRs would be present.  This\n\
    \   ensured that a query for NAPTRs in a given (out of service, \"ENUM\n   only\"\
    \ range) domain would succeed (i.e., return a RCODE of 0), but\n   that the number\
    \ of answers would also be zero.  This is covered in\n   Section 4.1.2 (rule 2\
    \ A, first point).  Note that this point also\n   covers the case where only NAPTRs\
    \ that cannot be used to initiate a\n   call exist in such a zone.\n   Where a\
    \ valid URI was provisioned, the ENUM lookup would complete by\n   returning that\
    \ value for further processing.  This further processing\n   is covered in Section\
    \ 4.2.\n   For \"ENUM only\" ranges, there was a further policy requirement that\n\
    \   an IP-based Point of Interconnect specified inside a NAPTR (as the\n   domainpart\
    \ of a valid URI) must be accessible for all potential\n   carriers.  The server\
    \ could reject a subsequent SIP Invitation, but\n   its machine address had to\
    \ resolve.  This was intended to avoid the\n   condition where the domain name\
    \ did not resolve, the softswitch logic\n   would attempt to place the call via\
    \ the PSTN, and this would fail\n   and/or loop.\n   This \"must resolve\" requirement\
    \ was not needed for numbers that had\n   an active PSTN Point of Interconnect\
    \ (i.e., the vast majority of\n   assigned numbers).  If the domain name did not\
    \ resolve, the call\n   would \"drop back\" to PSTN processing.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Trial ENUM Lookup Rules
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Trial ENUM Lookup Rules\n   In the Korean trial, the rules were:\n  \
    \ 1.  The ENUM module of the softswitch converts an E.164 number coming\n    \
    \   from the VoIP subscriber to an ENUM domain name (as defined in\n       RFC\
    \ 3761).\n   2.  The ENUM module, acting as a DNS stub resolver, sends a query\
    \ to\n       a recursive name server.\n   3.  If the ENUM module receives a DNS\
    \ answer, the call routing\n       process may branch off in several ways, depending\
    \ on the Rcode\n       value in the DNS response message, as shown below.\n  \
    \     A.  Rcode=0 (No error condition)\n           There is, potentially, an answer\
    \ to the corresponding query.\n           The normal call routing process needs\
    \ to differentiate\n           between the following conditions:\n           +\
    \  The response includes no URI (such as SIP or H.323) that\n              can\
    \ be used to initiate a call --\n              The call fails immediately.\n \
    \             Note: In the trial, the condition in which a telephone\n       \
    \       number:\n              -  is valid,\n              -  can only be reached\
    \ via the Internet, but\n              -  is not currently in service\n      \
    \        is indicated by an ENUM domain that DOES exist but DOES\n           \
    \   NOT include any supported (routable) NAPTRs.  A softswitch\n             \
    \ receiving this response interprets it as indicating that\n              the\
    \ call can be dropped immediately -- it would fail if\n              passed to\
    \ the PSTN.\n           +  There is at least one usable URI (such as SIP and/or\
    \ H.323\n              URIs) --\n              The softswitch picks one based\
    \ on the preference and order\n              field values in the NAPTR Resource\
    \ Record Set, and routes\n              the call using the method described in\
    \ Section 4.2.\n       B.  Rcode=3 (Name error), 1 (Format Error), 2 (Server Failure),\
    \ 4\n           (Not Implemented), or 5 (Refused)\n           There is no valid\
    \ answer for the query.\n           The softswitch has no choice but to route\
    \ the call using the\n           E.164 number with its vendor-specific method\
    \ (such as a\n           prefix-based method).  In this case, it means that the\
    \ call\n           has to be delivered through the PSTN for onward call routing.\n\
    \           It is also important to stress that the ENUM DNS servers must\n  \
    \         respond to all queries they receive from the softswitches.\n       \
    \    If the ENUM module in a softswitch does not receive a\n           response,\
    \ it will eventually time out, and the ENUM module\n           will treat this\
    \ as a DNS error.  However, the delay involved\n           is long in terms of\
    \ the normal call setup time, and should be\n           avoided.\n           It\
    \ would have been possible to modify the DNS code in each\n           softswitch\
    \ to have shorter time-outs than normal to cover\n           misconfiguration\
    \ of a DNS server, but this choice was not\n           considered in the trial.\
    \  The softswitch DNS stack was used\n           for several purposes other than\
    \ \"pure\" ENUM lookups.\n           Configuring it in a non-complaint manner\
    \ was considered\n           unacceptable, due to the need to analyze the impact\
    \ of that\n           choice on other DNS operations thoroughly before it could\
    \ be\n           implemented safely.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Call Routing Cases for Domainparts
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Call Routing Cases for Domainparts\n   If the DNS response has a valid\
    \ URI, such as SIP or H.323, the\n   softswitch can resolve the domain name part\
    \ of that URI to route a\n   call by searching two different sources.  One is\
    \ a recursive\n   nameserver, and the other is a fixed routing table held in the\n\
    \   softswitch, mapping from the domain name to the corresponding\n   gateway's\
    \ host name and IP address.\n   If there are many points of interconnection, using\
    \ a recursive\n   nameserver is useful for resolving a domain name, but if there\
    \ are\n   just a few known carriers and they do not change this interconnection\n\
    \   information frequently, a fixed (internal) routing table mapping from\n  \
    \ domain name to the corresponding gateway hostname and IP address is\n   more\
    \ efficient (rather than querying the recursive nameserver every\n   time).  In\
    \ addition, carriers would like to charge an interconnection\n   fee for all received\
    \ calls, so they tend to make interconnection only\n   with trusted carriers based\
    \ on some sort of bilateral agreement\n   between these carriers.  They may agree\
    \ on a specific gateway for\n   this purpose, so the interconnection information\
    \ is often private to\n   the parties of this particular agreement.\n   In principle,\
    \ these two approaches could be used in parallel, but in\n   practice, if the\
    \ DNS-based approach could be used, there would be no\n   point in retaining the\
    \ expensive and elaborate \"offline\"\n   infrastructure to exchange and install\
    \ the tables for domain routing.\n   In this trial, uncertainty over the performance\
    \ and reliability of\n   ENUM-based processing meant that the softswtitches were\
    \ configured so\n   that they could be switched between the two approaches immediately.\n\
    \   This was a temporary expedient only, and would not be a reasonable\n   approach\
    \ in the long term.\n   These two types of domain routing are also affected by\
    \ the Rcode=0\n   case described in Section 4.1.\n   There are two choices for\
    \ routing.  These are described and compared\n   here:\n   1.  Case when using\
    \ a fixed routing table:\n       A.  If the domain name part of the URI is found\
    \ in the internal\n           fixed routing table, the softswitch can use it.\n\
    \       B.  If the domain name part of the URI does not exist in the\n       \
    \    fixed routing table, the call is forwarded to the PSTN.\n   2.  Case when\
    \ using a recursive nameserver:\n       A.  If the domain name part of the URI\
    \ can be resolved via the\n           recursive nameserver, the softswitch can\
    \ use it.\n       B.  If the domain name part of the URI cannot be resolved on\
    \ the\n           recursive nameserver for any reason (such as a response with\n\
    \           no usable resource records according to [RFC3263] and\n          \
    \ [RFC3261], or with Rcode=1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), the call must be\n           forwarded\
    \ to the PSTN.\n   Case (1) seems inefficient because the administrator maintains\
    \ two\n   management points for numbers: the ENUM DNS and the softswitch\n   itself.\
    \  However, this configuration can minimize the call routing\n   failure ratio\
    \ during the transition period of ENUM (when there are\n   relatively few provisioned\
    \ ENUM entries and so few IP-based Points Of\n   Interconnection).  Thus, case\
    \ (1) could reasonably be implemented on\n   the softswitches during the trial\
    \ phase, and thereafter, as ENUM\n   entries are populated, case (2) would be\
    \ a reasonable choice.\n   With these choices, the two carriers could use ENUM\
    \ DNS for call\n   routing without any impact on their ongoing commercial VoIP\
    \ service.\n"

    \ is the searching mechanism for call routing information,\n   which can be stored\
    \ in the softswitch itself or in the DNS.\n   Therefore, a similar delay time\
    \ for call routing is important to\n   guarantee quality of service.  During the\
    \ trial, each carrier\n   measured this delay time when using the SIP protocol.\
    \  This was based\n   on the \"Answer Delay time\", defined as the elapsed time\
    \ between\n   requesting a call ('INVITE' message) and receiving a response ('200\n\
    \   OK' message) [RFC3261].\n               +------------------------+------+----------+\n\
    \               |        Call Type       | ENUM | Non-ENUM |\n               +------------------------+------+----------+\n\
    \               |      Carrier A->A      | 2.33 |   2.28   |\n               |\
    \      Carrier A->B      | 2.23 |   2.25   |\n               | Carrier A->other(PSTN)\
    \ | 4.11 |   3.79   |\n               |      Carrier B->B      | 2.18 |   2.05\
    \   |\n               |      Carrier B->A      | 2.19 |   2.19   |\n         \
    \      | Carrier B->other(PSTN) | 3.95 |   3.41   |\n               +------------------------+------+----------+\n\
    \                 Table 1: Average Answer Delay Time (Sec)\n   As shown in Table\
    \ 1, there is little difference in time (under a\n   second) between the ENUM\
    \ and non-ENUM cases.  Therefore, it is\n   difficult for a caller with either\
    \ carrier to detect the choice (ENUM\n   or non-ENUM) as an aspect of quality\
    \ when a call initiates.  This\n   means that ENUM definitely works well with\
    \ softswitches on a\n   commercial basis.\n   To make the trial more realistic,\
    \ the resolver that was used by these\n   ENUM-based softswitches was a recursive\
    \ nameserver that could be\n   accessed publicly.  This was done as it was felt\
    \ that a tough\n   condition would be better to verify the fact that an ENUM-based\n\
    \   softswitch works as well as a non-ENUM-based softswitch in providing\n   a\
    \ commercial VoIP service.\n"

  - "6.  'e164.arpa' Considerations\n   During the trial, the Infrastructure ENUM\
    \ deployed in the\n   2.8.e164.arpa zone could be accessed via the (public) Internet.\
    \  In\n   this situation, each carrier questioned whether or not the\n   centralized\
    \ number management under the ENUM DNS was realistic.\n   Another issue concerned\
    \ responsibility for routing errors.  All\n   carriers can use the shared ENUM\
    \ data to route their calls.  However,\n   if there are routing errors (due to\
    \ the data being provisioned\n   incorrectly), it is not always clear who has\
    \ responsibility for these\n   errors and who can correct the data.  The errors\
    \ occur in the\n   networks of the carriers placing the calls.  Unless the identity\
    \ of\n   the carrier responsible for delivering service to this telephone\n  \
    \ number is known, it is not obvious (to the carrier handling the\n   error) who\
    \ should be informed of these problems.  This is a\n   particular issue when number\
    \ portability is introduced.\n   In addition, the carriers also question whether\
    \ or not Infrastructure\n   ENUM needs to be accessible publicly.  To prevent\
    \ disclosure of\n   telephone numbers, they would prefer to access the ENUM DNS\n\
    \   privately.  Therefore, any ENUM module embedded in a softswitch needs\n  \
    \ to be flexible to adopt these considerations during the interim\n   period of\
    \ ENUM, before common policies and agreements have been\n   forged.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document inherits the security considerations\
    \ described in RFC\n   3761 and [RFC5067], as the ENUM DNS used with softswitches\
    \ in this\n   trial could be accessed publicly.\n   In addition, if the recursive\
    \ resolvers handling ENUM queries coming\n   from a softswitch were to be compromised\
    \ by an attacker, that\n   attacker would be able to force calls to fail or cause\
    \ delay to\n   calls.  Therefore, the DNS resolvers used should allow access from\n\
    \   the local network to which the softswitch is connected, whilst\n   restricting\
    \ access from outside, using a proper access-list policy.\n"
