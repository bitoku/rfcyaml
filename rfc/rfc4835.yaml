- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication\n\
    \   Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data being sent\n   over\
    \ an IPsec Security Association (SA) [RFC4301], [RFC4302].  To\n   ensure interoperability\
    \ between disparate implementations, it is\n   necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithms to\n   ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations\n\
    \   will have available.  This document defines the current set of\n   mandatory-to-implement\
    \ algorithms for ESP and AH as well as\n   specifying algorithms that should be\
    \ implemented because they may be\n   promoted to mandatory at some future time.\n\
    \   The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface\n   continuously\
    \ and existing algorithms are continuously attacked.  An\n   algorithm believed\
    \ to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak\n   tomorrow.  Given this,\
    \ the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm\n   should be conservative so\
    \ as to minimize the likelihood of it being\n   compromised quickly.  Thought\
    \ should also be given to performance\n   considerations as many uses of IPsec\
    \ will be in environments where\n   performance is a concern.\n   Finally, we\
    \ need to recognize that the mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithm(s) may need\
    \ to change over time to adapt to the changing\n   world.  For this reason, the\
    \ selection of mandatory-to-implement\n   algorithms is not included in the main\
    \ IPsec, ESP, or AH\n   specifications.  It is instead placed in this document.\
    \  As the\n   choice of algorithm changes, only this document should need to be\n\
    \   updated.\n   Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should\n\
    \   already be available in most implementations of IPsec by the time it\n   is\
    \ made mandatory.  To facilitate this, we will attempt to identify\n   such algorithms\
    \ (as they are known today) in this document.  There is\n   no guarantee that\
    \ the algorithms that we (today) believe may be\n   mandatory in the future will\
    \ in fact become so.  All algorithms known\n   today are subject to cryptographic\
    \ attack and may be broken in the\n   future.\n"

  - "2.  Requirements Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\

    \ in [RFC2119].\n   We define some additional terms here:\n         SHOULD+  This\
    \ term means the same as SHOULD.  However, it is\n                  likely that\
    \ an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be\n                  promoted at some future\
    \ time to be a MUST.\n         SHOULD-  This term means the same as SHOULD.  However,\
    \ it is\n                  likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD- will be\n\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security of cryptography-based systems depends\
    \ on both the\n   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength\
    \ of\n   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on\n\
    \   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system\n  \
    \ to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the\n   security\
    \ of the overall system.\n   This document concerns itself with the selection\
    \ of cryptographic\n   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with\
    \ the selection\n   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified\
    \ in\n   this document as \"MUST implement\" or \"SHOULD implement\" are not known\n\
    \   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far\n   leads\
    \ us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the\n   foreseeable future.\
    \  However, this is not necessarily forever.  We\n   would therefore expect that\
