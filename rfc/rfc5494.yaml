  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for
    allocating\n   new values for various fields in the Address Resolution Protocol\n
    \  (ARP) [RFC0826].  The change is also applicable to extensions of ARP\n   that
    use the same message format, such as [RFC0903], [RFC1931], and\n   [RFC2390].\n
    \  The change also affects other protocols that employ values from the\n   ARP
    name spaces.  For instance, the ARP hardware address type\n   (ar$hrd) number
    space is also used in the \"htype\" (hardware address\n   type) fields in the
    Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC0951] and Dynamic\n   Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) [RFC2131], as well as in the\n   \"hardware type\" field in the DHCP Unique
    Identifiers in DHCPv6\n   [RFC3315].  These protocols are therefore affected by
    the update in\n   the IANA rules.  Other affected specifications include the\n
    \  specialized address resolution mechanisms in:\n   o  HYPERchannel [RFC1044]\n
    \  o  DHCP options [RFC2132] [RFC4361]\n   o  ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
    ARP [RFC2225]\n   o  HARP (High-Performance Parallel Interface ARP) [RFC2834]
    [RFC2835]\n   o  Dual MAC (Media Access Control) FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data\n
    \     Interface) ARP [RFC1329]\n   o  MAPOS (Multiple Access Protocol over Synchronous
    Optical Network/\n      Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) ARP [RFC2176]\n   o  FC
    (Fibre Channel) ARP [RFC4338]\n   o  DNS DHCID Resource Record [RFC4701]\n   The
    IANA guidelines are given in Section 2.  Previously, no IANA\n   guidance existed
    for such allocations.  The purpose of this document\n   is to allow IANA to manage
    number assignments based on these\n   guidelines in a consistent manner.\n   This
    document also reserves some numbers for experimentation\n   purposes.  These numbers
    are given in Section 3.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   The following rules apply to the fields of ARP:\n
    \  ar$hrd (16 bits) Hardware address space\n      Requests for ar$hrd values below
    256 or for a batch of more than\n      one new value are made through Expert Review
    [RFC5226].\n      Note that certain protocols, such as BOOTP and DHCPv4, employ\n
    \     these values within an 8-bit field.  The expert should determine\n      that
    a need to allocate the new values exists and that the\n      existing values are
    insufficient to represent the new hardware\n      address types.  The expert should
    also determine the applicability\n      of the request and assign values higher
    than 255 for requests that\n      do not apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4.  Similarly, the
    expert should assign\n      1-octet values for requests that apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4,
    as for\n      example the \"IPsec tunnel\" with value 31 [RFC3456].  Conversely,\n
    \     ARP-only uses, without a foreseeable reason to use the same value\n      in
    BOOTP/DHCPv4, should favor 2-octet values.\n      Requests for individual new
    ar$hrd values that do not specify a\n      value, or where the requested value
    is greater than 255, are made\n      through First Come First Served [RFC5226].
    \ The assignment will\n      always result in a 2-octet value.\n   ar$pro (16
    bits) Protocol address space\n      These numbers share the Ethertype space.  The
    Ethertype space is\n      administered as described in [RFC5342].\n   ar$op (16
    bits) Opcode\n      Requests for new ar$op values are made through IETF Review
    or IESG\n      Approval [RFC5226].\n"

  - "3.  Allocations Defined in This Document\n   When testing new protocol extension
    ideas, it is often necessary to\n   use an actual constant in order to use the
    new function, even when\n   testing in a closed environment.  This document reserves
    the\n   following numbers for experimentation purposes in ARP:\n   o  Two new
    ar$hrd values are allocated for experimental purposes:\n      HW_EXP1 (36) and
    HW_EXP2 (256).  Note that these two new values\n      were purposely chosen so
    that one would be below 256 and the other\n      would be above 255, and so that
    there would be different values in\n      the least and most significant octets.\n
    \  o  Two new values for the ar$op are allocated for experimental\n      purposes:
    OP_EXP1 (24) and OP_EXP2 (25).\n   Note that Appendix B.2 of [RFC5342] lists two
    Ethertypes that can be\n   used for experimental purposes.\n   In addition, for
    both ar$hrd and ar$op, the values 0 and 65535 are\n   marked as reserved.  This
    means that they are not available for\n   allocation.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not change the security
    properties of the\n   affected protocols.\n   However, a few words are necessary
    about the use of the experimental\n   code points defined in Section 3.  Potentially
    harmful side effects\n   from the use of the experimental values need to be carefully\n
    \  evaluated before deploying any experiment across networks that the\n   owner
    of the experiment does not entirely control.  Guidance given in\n   [RFC3692]
    about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.\n"
