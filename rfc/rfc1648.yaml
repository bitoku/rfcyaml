- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Both STD 11, RFC 822 [1] and STD 3, RFC 1123 [2] (Host Requirements)\n\
    \   require that the email address \"postmaster\" be supported at all\n   hosts.\
    \  This paper extends this concept to X.400 mail domains which\n   have registered\
    \ RFC 1327 mapping rules, and which therefore appear to\n   have normal RFC822-style\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 1.  Postmaster Convention in RFC822
  contents:
  - "1.  Postmaster Convention in RFC822\n   Operating a reliable, large-scale electronic\
    \ mail (email) network\n   requires cooperation between many mail managers and\
    \ system\n   administrators.  As noted in RFC 822 [1], often mail or system\n\
    \   managers need to be able to contact a responsible person at a remote\n   host\
    \ without knowing any specific user name or address at that host.\n   For that\
    \ reason, both RFC 822 and the Internet Host Requirements [2]\n   require that\
    \ the address \"postmaster\" be supported at every Internet\n   host.\n"
- title: 2.  Postmaster Convention and X.400
  contents:
  - "2.  Postmaster Convention and X.400\n   However, RFC 822 is not the only email\
    \ protocol being used in the\n   Internet.  Some Internet sites are also running\
    \ the X.400 (1984) [3]\n   and X.400 (1988) [4] email protocols.  RFC 1327 specifies\
    \ how to map\n   between X.400 and RFC 822 addresses [5].  When mapping rules\
    \ are\n   used, addresses map cleanly between X.400 and RFC 822.  In fact, it\n\
    \   is impossible to determine by inspecting the address whether the\n   recipient\
    \ is an RFC 822 mail user or an X.400 mail user.\n   A paper by Rob Hagens and\
    \ Alf Hansen describes an X.400 community\n   known as the \"Global Open MHS Community\"\
    \ (GO-MHS) [6].  Many mail\n   domains in the GO-MHS Community have registered\
    \ RFC 1327 mapping\n   rules.  Therefore, users in those domains have RFC 822-style\
    \ email\n   addresses, and these email domains are a logical extension of the\
    \ RFC\n   822 Internet.  It is impossible to tell by inspecting a user's\n   address\
    \ whether the user receives RFC 822 mail or X.400 mail.\n   Since these addresses\
    \ appear to be standard RFC 822 addresses, mail\n   managers, mailing list managers,\
    \ host administrators, and users\n   expect to be able to simply send mail to\
    \ \"postmaster@domain\" and\n   having the message be delivered to a responsible\
    \ party.  When an RFC\n   1327 mapping rule exists, the X.400 address element\
    \ corresponding to\n   the left-hand-side \"postmaster\" is \"Surname=Postmaster\"\
    \ (both 1984\n   and 1988).  However, neither the X.400 protocols, North America\
    \ X.400\n   Implementor's Agreements [7], nor the other regional X.400\n   implementor's\
    \ agreements require that \"Surname=Postmaster\" and\n   \"CommonName=Postmaster\"\
    \ be supported.  (Supporting these addresses is\n   recommended in X.400 (1988)).\n\
    \   For mapped X.400 domains which do not support the postmaster\n   address(es),\
    \ this means that an address such as \"user@some.place.zz\"\n   might be valid,\
    \ yet mail to the corresponding address\n   \"postmaster@some.place.zz\" fails.\
    \  This is frustrating for remote\n   administrators and users, and can prevent\
    \ operational problems from\n   being communicated and resolved.  In this case,\
    \ the desired seamless\n   integration of the Internet RFC 822 mail world and\
    \ the mapped X.400\n   domain has not been achieved.\n   The X.400 mail managers\
    \ participating in the Cosine MHS Project\n   discussed this problem in a meeting\
    \ in June 1992 [8].  The discussion\n   recognized the need for supporting the\
    \ postmaster address at any\n   level of the address hierarchy where these are\
    \ user addresses.\n   However, the group only required supporting the postmaster\
    \ address\n   down to certain levels of the O/R Address tree.  This approach solved\n\
    \   part of the problem, but not all of it.  A more complete solution is\n   required.\n"
- title: 3.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Proposed Solution\n   To fully achieve the desired seamless integration of\
    \ email domains\n   for which RFC 1327 mapping rules have been defined, the following\n\
    \   convention must be followed,\n      If there are any valid addresses of the\
    \ form \"user@domain\", then\n      the address \"postmaster@domain\" must also\
    \ be valid.\n   To express this in terms of X.400:  For every X.400 domain for\
    \ which\n   an RFC 1327 mapping rule exists, if any address of the form\n    \
    \  Surname=User; <Other X.400 Address Elements>\n   is a valid address, then the\
    \ address\n      Surname=Postmaster; <Same X.400 Address Elements>\n   must also\
    \ be a valid address.  If the X.400 system is running\n   X.400(1988), then the\
    \ address\n      CommonName=Postmaster; <Same X.400 Address Elements>\n   must\
    \ also be supported.  (Note that CommonName=Postmaster will not be\n   generated\
    \ by RFC 1327 mappings, but it is recommended in the 1988\n   X.400 standard).\n\
    \   To remain consistent with RFC 822, \"Mail sent to that address is to\n   be\
    \ routed to a person responsible for the site's mail system or to a\n   person\
    \ with responsibility for general site operation.\" [9].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Software Limitations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Software Limitations\n   If software is unable to support this requirement,\
    \ it should be\n   upgraded.  X.400 software developers are strongly encouraged\
    \ and\n   requested to support forwarding mail to a centralized postmaster\n \
    \  mailbox in products.\n   It may be possible to support forwarding postmaster\
    \ mail to a central\n   mailbox in software packages which do not explicitly support\
    \ it by\n   applying work-around solutions.  For example, some packages support\n\
    \   creating a mailing list for \"postmaster\" which has one entry that\n   points\
    \ to the desired centralized postmaster mailbox.  Alternatively,\n   it may be\
    \ possible to support a postmaster address using the X.400\n   Autoforwarding\
    \ feature.  The software package may also support\n   rewriting the address in\
    \ some other way.\n"
