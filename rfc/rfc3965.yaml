  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This specification provides for \"simple mode\" carriage of facsimile\n\
    \   data using Internet mail.  Extensions to this document will follow.\n   The\
    \ current specification employs standard protocols and file formats\n   such as\
    \ TCP/IP, Internet mail protocols, Multipurpose Internet Mail\n   Extensions (MIME),\
    \ and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) for Facsimile.\n   It can send images not\
    \ only to other Internet-aware facsimile devices\n   but also to Internet-native\
    \ systems, such as PCs with common email\n   readers which can handle MIME mail\
    \ and TIFF for Facsimile data.  The\n   specification facilitates communication\
    \ among existing facsimile\n   devices, Internet mail agents, and the gateways\
    \ which connect them.\n   This document is a revision of RFC 2305.  There have\
    \ been no\n   technical changes.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This specification defines message-based facsimile communication\
    \ over\n   the Internet.  It describes a minimum set of capabilities, taking\n\
    \   into account those of typical facsimile devices and PCs that can\n   generate\
    \ facsimile data.\n   A G3Fax device has substantial restrictions due to specifications\
    \ in\n   the standards, such as for timers.  This specification defines a\n  \
    \ profile for Internet mail, rather than creating a distinct \"facsimile\n   over\
    \ the Internet\" service.  The semantics resulting from the profile\n   are designed\
    \ to be compatible with facsimile operation over the\n   general switched telephone\
    \ network, so that gateways between\n   facsimile and Internet mail can operate\
    \ with very high fidelity.\n   The reason for developing this capability as an\
    \ email profile is to\n   permit interworking amongst facsimile and email users.\
    \  For example,\n   it is intended that existing email users be able to send normal\n\
    \   messages to lists of users, including facsimile-based recipients, and\n  \
    \ that other email recipients shall be able to reply to the original\n   and continue\
    \ to include facsimile recipients.  Similarly, it is\n   intended that existing\
    \ email software work without modification and\n   not be required to process\
    \ new, or different data structures, beyond\n   what is normal for Internet mail\
    \ users.  Existing email service\n   standards are used, rather than replicating\
    \ mechanisms which are more\n   tailored to existing facsimile standards, to ensure\
    \ this\n   compatibility with existing email service.\n"
- title: 1.1. Services
  contents:
  - "1.1. Services\n   A facsimile-capable device that uses T.4 [15] and the general\n\
    \   switched telephone network (GSTN) is called a \"G3Fax device\" in this\n \
    \  specification.  An \"IFax device\" is an Internet-accessible device\n   capable\
    \ of sending, receiving or forwarding Internet faxes.  A\n   message can be sent\
    \ to an IFax device using  an Internet mail\n   address.  A message can be sent\
    \ to a G3Fax device  using an Internet\n   mail address; the message MAY be forwarded\
    \ via an IFax offramp\n   gateway.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.1. Relay\n   Data transfer MAY be achieved using standard Internet mail transfer\n\
    \   mechanisms [1, 3].  The format of addresses MUST conform to the RFC\n   821\

- title: 2.1.2. Gateway
  contents:
  - "2.1.2. Gateway\n   A gateway translates between dissimilar environments.  For\
    \ IFax, a\n   gateway connects between Internet mail and the T.4/GSTN facsimile.\n\
    \   Gateways can service multiple T.4/GSTN facsimile users or can service\n  \
    \ only one.  In the former case, they serve as a classic \"mail transfer\n   agent\"\
    \ (MTA) and in the latter as a classic \"mail user agent\" (UA).\n   An onramp\
    \ is a gateway which connects from T.4/GSTN facsimile to\n   Internet mail.  An\
    \ offramp is a gateway which connects from Internet\n   mail to T.4/GSTN facsimile.\
    \ Behavior of onramps is out of scope for\n   this specification.\n   This specification\
    \ describes the Internet mail service portion of\n   offramp addressing, confirmation\
    \ and failure notification.  Details\n   are provided in later sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.3. Mailbox protocols
  contents:
  - "2.1.3. Mailbox protocols\n   An offramp gateway that operate as an MTA serving\
    \ multiple users\n   SHOULD use SMTP; a gateway that operates as a UA serving\
    \ a single\n   mail recipient MAY use a mailbox access protocol such as POP [6]\
    \ or\n   similar mailbox access protocols.\n   NOTE: An offramp gateway that relays\
    \ mail based on addressing\n   information needs to ensure that it uses addresses\
    \ supplied in the\n   MTA envelope, rather than from elsewhere, such as addresses\
    \ listed in\n   the message content headers.\n"

    \   or the MAIL FROM address from the SMTP envelope.\n   In a tightly constrained\
    \ environment, sufficient physical and\n   software controls may be able to ensure\
    \ prevention of this problem.\n   The usual solution is through encryption-based\
    \ authentication, either\n   for the channel or associated with the object, as\
    \ discussed below.\n   It should be recognized that SMTP implementations do not\
    \ provide\n   inherent authentication of the senders of messages, nor are sites\n\
    \   under obligation to provide such authentication.  End-to-end\n   approaches\
    \ such as S/MIME and PGP/MIME are currently being developed\n   within the IETF.\
    \  These technologies can provide such authentication.\n"
- title: 5.2.2. Resources Consumed by Dialout
  contents:
  - "5.2.2. Resources Consumed by Dialout\n   In addition to the resources normally\
    \ consumed for email (CPU cycles\n   and disk), offramp facsimile causes an outdial\
    \ which often imposes\n   significant resource consumption, such as financial\
    \ cost.  Techniques\n   for establishing authorization of the sender are essential\
    \ to those\n   offramp facsimile services that need to manage such consumption.\n\
    \   Due to the consumption of these resources by dialout, unsolicited\n   bulk\
    \ email which causes an outdial is undesirable.\n   Offramp gateways SHOULD provide\
    \ the ability to authorize senders in\n   some manner to prevent unauthorized\
    \ use of the offramp.  There are no\n   standard techniques for authorization\
    \ using Internet protocols.\n   Typical solutions use simple authentication of\
    \ the originator to\n   establish and verify their identity and then check the\
    \ identity\n   against a private authorization table.\n   Originator authentication\
    \ entails the use of weak or strong\n   mechanisms, such as cleartext keywords\
    \ or encryption-based\n   data-signing, respectively, to determine and validate\
    \ the identify\n   of the sender and assess permissions accordingly.\n   Other\
    \ control mechanisms which are common include source filtering\n   and originator\
    \ authentication.  Source filtering entails offramp\n   gateway verification of\
    \ the host or network originating the message\n   and permitting or prohibiting\
    \ relaying accordingly.\n"
- title: 5.2.3. GSTN Authorization Information
  contents:
  - "5.2.3. GSTN Authorization Information\n   Confidential information about the\
    \ sender necessary to dial a G3Fax\n   recipient, such as sender's calling card\
    \ authorization number, might\n   be disclosed to the G3Fax recipient (on the\
    \ cover page), such as\n   through parameters encoded in the G3Fax recipients\
    \ address in the To:\n   or CC: fields.\n   Senders SHOULD be provided with a\
    \ method of preventing such\n   disclosure.  As with mechanisms for handling unsolicited\
    \ faxes, there\n   are not yet standard mechanisms for protecting such information.\n\
    \   Out-of-band communication of authorization information or use of\n   encrypted\
    \ data in special fields are the available non-standard\n   techniques.\n   Typically\
    \ authorization needs to be associated to specific senders\n   and specific messages,\
    \ in order to prevent a \"replay\" attack which\n   causes and earlier authorization\
    \ to enable a later dial-out by a\n   different (and unauthorized) sender.  A\
    \ non-malicious example of such\n   a replay would be to have an email recipient\
    \ reply to all original\n   recipients -- including an offramp IFax recipient\
    \ -- and have the\n   original sender's authorization cause the reply to be sent.\n"
- title: 5.2.4. Sender Accountability
  contents:
  - "5.2.4. Sender Accountability\n   In many countries, there is a legal requirement\
    \ that the \"sender\" be\n   disclosed on a facsimile message.  Email From addresses\
    \ are trivial\n   to fake, so that using only the MAIL FROM [1, 3]  or From [2,\
    \ 3]\n   header is not sufficient.\n   Offramps SHOULD ensure that the recipient\
    \ is provided contact\n   information about the offramp, in the event of problems.\n\
    \   The G3Fax recipient SHOULD be provided with sufficient information\n   which\
    \ permits tracing the originator of the IFax message.  Such\n   information might\

    \ users SHOULD be preserved as\n   much as possible.\n   Sufficient physical and\

    \ with IFax,\n   a bounce could be sent elsewhere (see section [Delivery Failure]),\n\
