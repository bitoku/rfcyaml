  - "Abstract\n   The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n\
    \   protocol has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325\n   and\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6325] describes the way RBridges agree on the campus-wide\
    \ minimum\n   acceptable inter-RBridge MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size (called\n\
    \   \"Sz\") to ensure that link-state flooding operates properly and all\n   RBridges\
    \ converge to the same link state.  For the proper operation\n   of TRILL (Transparent\
    \ Interconnection of Lots of Links) IS-IS, all\n   RBridges format their Link\
    \ State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) to fit\n   in Sz.\n   [RFC7177] diagrams the\
    \ state transitions of an adjacency.  If MTU\n   testing is enabled, \"Link MTU\
    \ size is successfully tested\" is part of\n   an event (event A6) causing the\
    \ transition from the \"2-Way\" state\n   [RFC7177] to the \"Report\" state for\
    \ an adjacency.  This means that\n   the link MTU testing of size x succeeds,\
    \ and x is greater than or\n   equal to Sz [RFC6325].  If this link cannot support\
    \ an MTU of Sz, it\n   will not be reported as part of the campus topology.\n\
    \   In this document, a new RECOMMENDED link-wide minimum inter-RBridge\n   MTU\
    \ size, \"Lz\", is specified.  As further discussed in Section 2, by\n   calculating\
    \ and using Lz as specified herein, link-scoped Protocol\n   Data Units (PDUs)\
    \ can be formatted greater than Sz, up to the\n   link-wide minimum acceptable\
    \ inter-RBridge MTU size, potentially\n   improving the efficiency of link utilization\
    \ and speeding link-state\n   convergence.\n   An optional TRILL MTU size-testing\
    \ algorithm is specified in\n   Section 3 as an efficient method to update the\
    \ old MTU testing method\n   described in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC6325] and in [RFC7177].\
    \  The new\n   MTU size-testing method specified in this document is backward\n\
    \   compatible with the old one.  Multicasting the MTU-probes is\n   recommended\
    \ when there are multiple RBridges on a link responding to\n   the probing with\
    \ an MTU-ack [RFC7177].  The testing method and rules\n   of this document are\
    \ devised in a way that minimizes the number of\n   MTU-probes for testing, therefore\
    \ reducing the number of multicast\n   packets for MTU testing.\n   This document\
    \ updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7780.  The update to\n   [RFC6325] and [RFC7177]\
    \ is specified in Section 3.  The update to\n   [RFC7780] is specified in Section\
    \ 4.\n"

- title: 2.  Link-Wide TRILL MTU Size
  contents:
  - "2.  Link-Wide TRILL MTU Size\n   This document specifies a new value \"Lz\" for\
    \ the minimum acceptable\n   inter-RBridge link MTU size on a local link.  Link-wide\
    \ Lz is the\n   minimum Lz supported and agreed upon amongst all RBridges on a\n\
    \   specific link.  If the link is usable, Lz will be greater than or\n   equal\
    \ to Sz.\n   Some TRILL IS-IS PDUs are exchanged only between neighbors instead\
    \ of\n   throughout the whole campus.  They are confined by the link-wide Lz\n\
    \   instead of Sz.  Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs) and Partial\n   Sequence\
    \ Number PDUs (PSNPs) are examples of such PDUs.  These PDUs\n   are exchanged\
    \ only on the local link.  (While TRILL IS-IS Hellos are\n   also link local,\
    \ they are always limited to 1470 bytes for\n   robustness.)\n   [RFC7356] defines\
    \ the PDUs that support flooding scopes in addition\n   to area-wide scopes and\
    \ domain-wide scopes.  As specified in\n   [RFC8139], RBridges support the Extended\
    \ L1 Circuit Scope (E-L1CS)\n   Flooding Scope LSP (FS-LSP) [RFC7780].  The originatingSNPBufferSize\n\
    \   for a port is the minimum of the following two quantities but\n   not less\
    \ than 1470 bytes: (1) the MTU of the port and (2) the maximum\n   LSP size that\
    \ the TRILL IS-IS implementation can handle.  They use\n   that flooding to exchange\
    \ their maximum supported value of \"Lz\".  The\n   smallest value of the Lz advertised\
    \ by the RBridges on a link, but\n   not less than Sz, is the link-wide Lz.  An\
    \ RBridge on a local link\n   will be able to tell which other RBridges on that\
    \ link support E-L1CS\n   FS-LSPs because, as required by [RFC7780], all RBridges\
    \ include the\n   Scope Flooding Support TLV [RFC7356] in their TRILL Hellos.\n\
    \   The maximum size for a level-1 link-local PDU (such as a PSNP or\n   CSNP)\
    \ that may be generated by a system is controlled by the value of\n   the management\
    \ parameter originatingL1SNPBufferSize.  This value\n   determines Lz.  The TRILL\
    \ APPsub-TLV shown in Figure 1 SHOULD be\n   included in a TRILL GENINFO TLV [RFC7357]\
    \ in an E-L1CS FS-LSP\n   fragment zero.  If it is missing from an E-L1CS FS-LSP\
    \ fragment zero\n   or there is no E-L1CS FS-LSP fragment zero, it is assumed\
    \ that its\n   originating IS is implicitly advertising its originatingSNPBufferSize\n\
    \   value as Sz octets.\n   E-L1CS FS-LSPs are link local and can also be sent\
    \ up to a size of Lz\n   but, for robustness, E-L1CS FS-LSP fragment zero MUST\
    \ NOT exceed\n   1470 bytes.\n              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\

  - "2.1.  Operations\n   Lz MAY be reported using an originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLV\
    \ that\n   occurs in fragment zero of the RBridge's E-L1CS FS-LSP.  An\n   originatingSNPBufferSize\

    \ on the\n   value of link-wide Lz based on advertised originatingSNPBufferSize,\n\
    \   it does not mean that these RBridges can safely exchange PDUs between\n  \
    \ each other.  Figure 2 shows such a corner case.  RB1, RB2, and RB3\n   are three\
    \ RBridges on the same link and their Lz is 1800, so the\n   link-wide Lz of this\
    \ link is 1800.  There is an intermediate bridge\n   (say B1) between RB2 and\

    \ link MTU size and will be safely\n   transmitted on this link.\n   As for Sz,\
    \ RBridges continue to propagate their\n   originatingL1LSPBufferSize across the\
    \ campus through the\n   advertisement of LSPs as defined in Section 4.3.2 of\
    \ [RFC6325].  The\n   smallest value of Sz advertised by any RBridge, but not\
    \ less than\n   1470, will be deemed as Sz.  Each RBridge formats their \"campus-wide\"\
    \n   PDUs -- for example, LSPs -- no greater than what they determine\n   as Sz.\n"
- title: 3.  Testing Link MTU Size
  contents:
  - "3.  Testing Link MTU Size\n   [RFC7177] defines event A6 as indicating that the\
    \ MTU test was\n   successful if MTU testing is enabled.  As described in Section\
    \ 4.3.2\n   of [RFC6325], this is a combination of the following event and\n \
    \  condition:\n   o  Event: The link MTU size has been tested.\n   o  Condition:\
    \ The link can support Sz.\n   This condition can be efficiently tested by the\
    \ following \"binary\n   search algorithm\" and rules.  This updates [RFC6325]\
    \ and [RFC7177].\n   x, lowerBound, and upperBound are local integer variables.\
    \  The\n   MTU-probe and MTU-ack PDUs are specified in Section 3 of [RFC7176].\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that one Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the two\n   adjacent\
    \ RBridges be used as the minimum interval between two\n   successive probes.\
    \  Note that RTT estimation is out of scope for this\n   document.  If operators\
    \ cannot estimate the RTT, the default value of\n   5 milliseconds should be assumed.\n\
    \   Step 0: RB1 sends an MTU-probe padded to the size of link-wide Lz.\n     \
    \ 1) If RB1 successfully receives the MTU-ack from RB2 to the probe\n        \
    \ of the value of link-wide Lz within k tries (where k is a\n         configurable\
    \ parameter whose default is 3), the link MTU size\n         is set to the size\
    \ of link-wide Lz.  Stop.\n      2) RB1 tries to send an MTU-probe padded to 1470\
    \ bytes.\n         a) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack from RB2 after k tries\n\
    \            (an MTU-ack should be considered to have failed two RTTs\n      \
    \      after the probe is sent out), RB1 sets the \"failed minimum\n         \
    \   MTU test\" flag for RB2 in RB1's Hello.  Stop.\n         b) The link MTU size\
    \ is set to 1470; lowerBound is set to 1470;\n            upperBound is set to\
    \ the link-wide Lz; x is set to\n            [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2],\
    \ rounded down to the nearest\n            integer.\n   Step 1: RB1 tries to send\
    \ an MTU-probe padded to the size x.\n      1) If RB1 fails to receive an MTU-ack\
    \ from RB2 after k tries:\n         upperBound is set to x - 1; x is set to\n\
    \         [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2], rounded down to the nearest\n     \
    \    integer.\n      2) If RB1 receives an MTU-ack to a probe of size x from RB2:\n\
    \         The link MTU size is set to x; lowerBound is set to x; x is set\n  \
    \       to [(lowerBound + upperBound) / 2], rounded down to the nearest\n    \
    \     integer.  If lowerBound equals upperBound - 1, then x is set to\n      \
    \   upperBound.\n      3) If lowerBound >= upperBound or Step 1 has been repeated\
    \ n times\n         (where n is a configurable parameter whose default value is\
    \ 5),\n         stop.\n      4) Repeat Step 1.\n   After the testing, the two\
    \ connected RBridges agree on the value of\n   the link MTU size.  MTU testing\
    \ is only done in the Designated VLAN\n   [RFC7177].  Since the execution of the\
    \ above algorithm can be\n   resource consuming, it is RECOMMENDED that the Designated\
    \ RBridge\n   (DRB) [RFC7177] take the responsibility to do the testing.  Multicast\n\
    \   MTU-probes are used instead of unicast when multiple RBridges are\n   desired\
    \ to respond with an MTU-ack on the link.  The binary search\n   algorithm given\
    \ here is a way to minimize the probing attempts; it\n   reduces the number of\
    \ multicast packets for MTU-probing.\n   The following rules are designed to determine\
    \ whether the\n   aforementioned \"Condition\" holds.\n   RBridges have figured\
    \ out the upper bound and lower bound of the link\n   MTU size from the execution\
    \ of the above algorithm.  If Sz is smaller\n   than the lower bound or greater\
    \ than the upper bound, RBridges can\n   directly judge whether the link supports\
    \ Sz without MTU-probing.\n   (a) If lowerBound >= Sz, this link can support Sz.\n\
    \   (b) Else if upperBound <= Sz, this link cannot support Sz.\n   Otherwise,\
    \ RBridges SHOULD test whether the link can support Sz as in\n   item (c) below.\
    \  If they do not, the only safe assumption will be\n   that the link cannot support\
    \ Sz.  This assumption, without testing,\n   might rule out the use of a link\
    \ that can, in fact, handle packets up\n   to Sz.  In the worst case, this might\
    \ result in unnecessary network\n   partition.\n   (c) lowerBound < Sz < upperBound.\
    \  RBridges probe the link with\n       MTU-probe messages padded to Sz.  If an\
    \ MTU-ack is received\n       within k tries, this link can support Sz.  Otherwise,\
    \ this link\n       cannot support Sz.  Through this test, the lower bound and\
    \ upper\n       bound of the link MTU size can be updated accordingly.\n"

    \ Sz.\n   1) Joining\n      a) When a new RBridge joins the campus and its\n \

    \ process, we know that if\n         an RBridge's originatingL1LSPBufferSize is\
    \ smaller than Sz,\n         this RBridge will not join this campus.\n      b)\
    \ When an RBridge leaves the campus and its\n         originatingL1LSPBufferSize\

    \ reaching MaxAge [IS-IS].  Sz\n         MAY be recalculated and MAY increase.\
    \  In other words, while in\n         most cases RB1 ignores link-state information\
    \ for IS-IS\n         unreachable RBridge RB2 [RFC7780], originatingL1LSPBufferSize\n\
    \         is meaningful.  Its value, even from IS-IS unreachable\n         RBridges,\
    \ is used in determining Sz.  This updates [RFC7780].\n      c) When an RBridge\
    \ leaves the campus and its\n         originatingL1LSPBufferSize is greater than\
    \ Sz, Sz will not be\n         updated, since Sz is determined by another RBridge\
    \ with a\n         smaller originatingL1LSPBufferSize.\n   Frequent LSP \"resizing\"\
    \ is harmful to the stability of the TRILL\n   campus, so, to avoid this, upward\
    \ resizing SHOULD be dampened.  When\n   an upward resizing event is noticed by\
    \ an RBridge, it is RECOMMENDED\n   that a timer be set at that RBridge via a\
    \ configurable parameter --\n   LSPresizeTime -- whose default value is 300 seconds.\
    \  Before this\n   timer expires, all subsequent upward resizing will be dampened\n\
    \   (ignored).  Of course, in a well-configured campus with all RBridges\n   configured\
    \ to have the same originatingL1LSPBufferSize, no resizing\n   will be necessary.\
    \  It does not matter if different RBridges have\n   different dampening timers\
    \ or if some RBridges resize upward more\n   quickly than others.\n   If the refreshed\
    \ Sz is smaller than the lower bound or greater than\n   the upper bound of the\
    \ tested link MTU size, the issue of resource\n   consumption from testing the\
    \ link MTU size can be avoided according\n   to rule (a) or (b) as specified in\
    \ Section 3.  Otherwise, RBridges\n   test the link MTU size according to rule\
    \ (c).\n"

    \   configuration), that port SHOULD be disabled, since, in any case, an\n   adjacency\
    \ cannot be formed through such a port.  On the other hand,\n   when an RBridge\
    \ receives an LSP or E-L1CS FS-LSP with size greater\n   than the link-wide Lz\
    \ or Sz but not greater than its port MTU size,\n   this LSP is processed normally.\
    \  If the size of an LSP is greater\n   than the MTU size of a port over which\
    \ it is to be propagated, this\n   LSP MUST NOT be sent over the port and an LSPTooLargeToPropagate\n\
    \   alarm shall be generated [IS-IS].\n"
- title: 6.  LSP Synchronization
  contents:
  - "6.  LSP Synchronization\n   An RBridge participates in LSP synchronization on\
    \ a link as soon as\n   it has at least one adjacency on that link that has advanced\
    \ to at\n   least the 2-Way state [RFC7177].  On a LAN link, CSNPs and PSNPs are\n\
    \   used for synchronization.  On a point-to-point link, only PSNPs are\n   used.\n\
    \   The CSNPs and PSNPs can be formatted in chunks of size (at most)\n   link-wide\
    \ Lz but are processed normally if received having a larger\n   size.  Since the\
    \ link MTU size may not have been tested in the 2-Way\n   state, link-wide Lz\
    \ may be greater than the supported link MTU size.\n   In that case, a CSNP or\
    \ PSNP may be discarded.  After the link MTU\n   size is successfully tested,\
    \ RBridges will begin to format these PDUs\n   with a size no greater than that\
    \ MTU; therefore, these PDUs will\n   eventually get through.\n   Note that the\
    \ link MTU size is frequently greater than Sz.\n   Link-local PDUs are limited\
    \ in size by the link MTU size rather than\n   Sz, which, when Lz is greater than\
    \ Sz, promises a reduction in the\n   number of PDUs and a faster LSP synchronization\
    \ process.\n"
- title: 7.  Recommendations for Traffic Link Testing of MTU Size
  contents:
  - "7.  Recommendations for Traffic Link Testing of MTU Size\n   Sz and link-wide\
    \ Lz are used to limit the size of most TRILL IS-IS\n   PDUs.  They are different\
    \ from the MTU size restricting the size of\n   TRILL Data packets.  The size\
    \ of a TRILL Data packet is restricted by\n   the physical MTU of the ports and\
    \ links the packet traverses.  It is\n   possible that a TRILL Data packet successfully\
    \ gets through the\n   campus but its size is greater than Sz or link-wide Lz\
    \ values.\n   The algorithm defined for testing the link MTU size can also be\
    \ used\n   in TRILL traffic MTU size testing; in that case, the link-wide Lz\n\
    \   used in that algorithm is replaced by the port MTU of the RBridge\n   sending\
    \ MTU-probes.  The successfully tested size x MAY be advertised\n   as an attribute\
    \ of this link, using the MTU sub-TLV defined in\n   [RFC7176].\n   Unlike RBridges,\
    \ end stations do not participate in the exchange of\n   TRILL IS-IS PDUs; therefore,\
    \ they cannot grasp the traffic link MTU\n   size from a TRILL campus automatically.\
    \  An operator may collect\n   these values using network management tools such\
    \ as TRILL ping or\n   TraceRoute.  Then, the path MTU can be set as the smallest\
    \ tested\n   link MTU on this path, and end stations should not generate frames\n\
    \   that -- when encapsulated as TRILL Data packets -- exceed this\n   path MTU.\n"
- title: 8.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "8.  Backward Compatibility\n   There can be a mixture of Lz-ignorant and Lz-aware\
    \ RBridges on a\n   link.  This configuration will behave properly, although it\
    \ may\n   not be as efficient as it would be if all RBridges on the link are\n\
    \   Lz aware.\n   For an Lz-ignorant RBridge, TRILL IS-IS PDUs are always formatted\n\
    \   no greater than Sz.  Lz-aware RBridges as receivers can handle these\n   PDUs,\
    \ since they cannot be greater than the link-wide Lz.\n   For an Lz-aware RBridge,\
    \ in the case that link-wide Lz is greater\n   than Sz, larger link-local TRILL\
    \ IS-IS PDUs can be sent out to\n   increase efficiency.  Lz-ignorant RBridges\
    \ as receivers will have\n   no problem handling them, since the originatingL1LSPBufferSize\
    \ value\n   of these RBridges had been tested and the link-wide Lz is not greater\n\
    \   than that value.\n   An Lz-ignorant RBridge might not support the link MTU\
    \ size-testing\n   algorithm defined in Section 3 but could be using some algorithm\
    \ just\n   to test for the Sz MTU on the link.  In any case, if an RBridge per\n\
    \   [RFC6325] receives an MTU-probe, it MUST respond with an MTU-ack\n   padded\
    \ to the same size as the MTU-probe.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document raises no significant new security\
    \ issues for TRILL.\n   In TRILL, RBridges are generally considered to be trusted\
    \ devices.\n   Protection against forged TRILL IS-IS PDUs, including forged Hellos\n\
    \   containing originatingSNPBufferSize APPsub-TLVs, can be obtained\n   through\
    \ IS-IS PDU cryptographic authentication [RFC5310].  The worst\n   that an RBridge\
    \ can do by reporting an erroneous\n   originatingSNPBufferSize is reduce Lz to\
    \ Sz and thus make unavailable\n   the optimization of being able to use link\
    \ MTUs that exceed the\n   campus-wide MTU for link-local TRILL IS-IS PDUs.\n\
    \   For general and adjacency-related TRILL security considerations, see\n   [RFC6325]\
