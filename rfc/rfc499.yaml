  - "Section I\n   RJE was designed to provide network users with the facility of\n\
    \   submitting jobs to remote servers via the ARPA net and retrieving\n   results\
    \ using Harvard's PDP-10.\n   In order to be an expert in the use of the RJE program\
    \ from a remote\n   host, the user must be familiar with the FTP commands and\
    \ usage.  At\n   present RJE is only implemented for UCLA.  Accordingly, all examples\n\
    \   will deal with the UCLA installation.  Arrangements for a password\n   and\
    \ a job ID must be made at UCLA before usage is to begin.  If you\n   are interested,\
    \ we will see to it that an account is made up for you.\n   People at other sites\
    \ should deal directly with UCLA to get an\n   account.\n"

  - "Section II\n                         HOW TO USE RJE AT HARVARD\n   Start the\
    \ program by taping R RJE<CR> at monitor level.  RJE will\n   respond with a \"\
    !\".\n   Then type \"RJE UCL<CR> to make the TELNET connection.  The TELNET\n\
    \   connection is used for transfer of commands to UCLA and error\n   messages\
    \ from UCLA to the user of RJE.  It is important to realize\n   that, in using\
    \ RJE, one is talking to two systems; the local system\n   (HARV-10) and the remote\
    \ host where the job will actually be run.\n   Therefore, there are two command\
    \ processors, one local and one\n   foreign.\n                  COMMANDS TO THE\
    \ LOCAL (HARVARD) PROCESS\n   All commands to the local process begin with a *.\n\
    \   *READ LDEV:FILENAME.EXTENSION<CR>\n   Reads the specified file, which contains\
    \ all job cards, JCL, program\n   and data, formats it for RJS at UCLA and ships\
    \ it over a data\n   connection.  When using the data connection, ASCII files\
    \ are\n   translated into EBCDIC, the UCLA end of the connection.  After\n   transfer\
    \ is completed the file is immediately spooled for processing.\n   *PRINT LDEV:FILENAME.EXTENSION<CR>\n\
    \   Gets the next print file from UCLA's 91 and reformats the print file\n   for\
    \ a PDP-10 line printer.  Write the file to the user's specified\n   logical device\
    \ with the specified FILENAME.EXTENSION.  FILENAME is up\n   to 6 characters in\
    \ length and EXTENSION is up to 3 characters in\n   length.\n   *QUIT<CR>\n  \
    \ Tear down all connections used by RJE and return to monitor level.\n       \
    \               COMMANDS TO THE REMOTE PROCESS\n                            (UCLA\
    \ RJS COMMANDS)\n   Commands to the remote process have no special character preceding\
    \ a\n   command.  For a explanation of the command arguments, ask Terry Sack\n\
    \   for the document named, RJS OPERATOR COMMANDS FOR REMOTE TERMINALS.\n   Terminal\
    \ Control and Information Command\n   -------- ------- --- ----------- -------\n\
    \   SIGNON              First command of a session identifies VRBT\n         \
    \              (virtual remote batch terminal) by giving its\n               \
    \        terminal ID.  For UCLA, Harvard's terminal ID is\n                  \
    \     NETHARV.\n   SIGNOFF             Last command of a session; RJS waits for\
    \ any data\n                       transfer in progress to complete and then closes\n\
    \                       all connections.\n   STATUS              Outputs on the\
    \ local user's terminal a complete\n                       list, or a summary,\
    \ of all jobs in the system for\n                       this VRBT, with an indication\
    \ of their\n                       progressing status in the Model 91.\n   ALERT\
    \               Outputs on the user's terminal any special\n                 \
    \      \"Alert\" message from the CCN computer operator.\n                   \
    \    The Alert message is also automatically sent when\n                     \
    \  the user does a SIGNON, or whenever the message\n                       changes.\n\
    \   MSG                 Sends a message to CCN computer operator or to\n     \
    \                  any other RJS terminal (real or virtual).  A\n            \
    \           message from the computer operator or another RJS\n              \
    \         terminal will automatically appear on the user's\n                 \
    \      terminal.\n   Job Control and Routing Commands\n   --- ------- --- -------\
    \ --------\n   Under CCN's job management system, the default destination for\
    \ output\n   is the input source.  Thus, a job submitted under a given VRET will\n\
    \   be returned to that VRBT (i.e., the same terminal ID), unless the\n   user's\
    \ JCL overrides the default destination.\n   RJS places print and punch output\
    \ destined for a particular remote\n   terminal into either an Active Queue or\
    \ a Deferred Queue.  When the\n   user opens his print or punch output channel\
    \ (via the *PRINT command\n   of RJE), RJS immediately starts sending job output\
    \ from the Active\n   Queue, and continues until this queue is empty.  Job output\
    \ in the\n   Deferred Queue, on the other hand, must be called for by job name\n\
    \   (via a RESET command from the remote operator) before RJS will send\n   it.\
    \  The Active/Deferred choice for output from a job is determined\n   by the deferral\
    \ status of the VRBT when the job is entered; the\n   deferral status, which is\
    \ set to the Active option when the user\n   signs on, may be changed by the SET\
    \ command.\n   SET                 Allows the remote user to change certain\n\
    \                       properties of his VRBT for the duration of the\n     \
    \                  current session\n                       (a) May change the\
    \ default output destination to\n                       be another (real or virtual)\
    \ RJS terminal or the\n                       central facility.\n            \
    \           (b) May change the deferral status of the VRBT.\n   DEFER        \
    \       Moves the print and punch output for a specified\n                   \
    \    job or set of jobs from the Active Queue to the\n                       Deferred\
    \ Queue.  If the job's output is in\n                       process of being transmitted\
    \ over a channel, RJS\n                       aborts the channel and saves the\
    \ current output\n                       location before moving the job to the\
    \ Deferred\n                       Queue.  A subsequent RESET command will return\
    \ it\n                       to the Active Queue with an implied Backspace\n \
    \                      (BSP).\n   RESET               Moves specified job(s) from\
    \ Deferred to Active\n                       Queue so they may be sent to user.\
    \  A specific\n                       list of job names or all jobs can be moved\
    \ with\n                       one RESET command.\n   ROUTE               Re-routes\
    \ output of specified jobs (or all jobs)\n                       waiting in the\
    \ Active and Deferred Queues for\n                       this VRBT.  The new destination\
    \ may be any other\n                       RJS terminal or the central facility.\n\
    \   ABORT               Cancels a job which was successfully submitted\n     \
    \                  and awaiting execution or is currently executing\n        \
    \               in the Model 91.  If the cancelled job was in\n              \
    \         execution, all output it produced will be\n                       returned.\n\
    \   Output Stream Control Commands\n   ------ ------ ------- --------\n   BSP\
    \ (BACKSPACE)     Backspaces output stream within current SYSOUT\n           \
    \            data set.  Actual amount backspaced depends upon\n              \
    \         SYSOUT blocking but is typically equivalent to a\n                 \
    \      page on the line printer.\n   CAN (CANCEL)        (a) On an output channel,\
    \ CAN causes the rest of\n                       the output in the SYSOUT data\
    \ set currently being\n                       transmitted to be omitted.  Alternatively,\
    \ may\n                       omit the rest of the SYSOUT data sets for the job\n\
    \                       currently being transmitted; however, the\n          \
    \             remaining system and accounting messages will be\n             \
    \          sent.\n                       (b) On an input channel, CAN causes RJS\
    \ to ignore\n                       the job currently being read.  However, the\n\
    \                       channel is not aborted as a result, and RJS will\n   \
    \                    continue reading in jobs on the channel.\n              \
    \         (c) CAN can delete all SYSOUT data sets for\n                      \
    \ specified job(s) waiting in Active or Deferred\n                       Queue.\n\
    \   RST (RESTART)       (a) Restarts a specified output stream at the\n      \
    \                 beginning of the current SYSOUT data set or,\n             \
    \          optionally, at the beginning of the job.\n                       (b)\
    \ Marks as restarted specified job(s) whose\n                       transmission\
    \ was earlier interrupted by system\n                       failure or user action\
    \ (e.g., DEFER command or\n                       aborting the channel).  When\
    \ RJS transmits these\n                       jobs again, it will start at the\
    \ beginning of the\n                       partially transmitted SYSOUT data set\
    \ or,\n                       optionally, at the beginning of the job.  This\n\
    \                       function may be applied to jobs in either the\n      \
    \                 Active or the Deferred Queue; however, if the job\n        \
    \               was in the Deferred Queue then RST also moves it\n           \
    \            to the Active Queue.  If the job was never\n                    \
    \   transmitted, RST has no effect other than this\n                       queue\
    \ movement.\n   REPEAT              Sends additional copies of the output of\n\
    \                       specified jobs.\n   EAM                 Echoes the card\
    \ reader stream back in the printer\n                       or punch stream, or\
    \ both.\n"
