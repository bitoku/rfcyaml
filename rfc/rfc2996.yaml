  - "Abstract\n   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling may be used to request\n\
    \   Quality of Service (QoS) services and enhance the manageability of\n   application\
    \ traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv or\n   DS) network.  When\
    \ using RSVP with DS networks it is useful to be\n   able to carry carry Differentiated\
    \ Services Code Points (DSCPs) in\n   RSVP message objects.  One example of this\
    \ is the use of RSVP to\n   arrange for the marking of packets with a particular\
    \ DSCP upstream\n   from the DS network's ingress point, at the sender or at a\
    \ previous\n   network's egress router.\n   The DCLASS object is used to represent\
    \ and carry DSCPs within RSVP\n   messages.  This document specifies the format\
    \ of the DCLASS object\n   and briefly discusses its use.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   This section describes the mechanics of using RSVP [RSVP]\
    \ signaling\n   and the DCLASS object for effecting admission control and applying\n\
    \   QoS policy within a Differentiated Service network [DS].  It assumes\n   standard\
    \ RSVP senders and receivers, and a diff-serv network\n   somewhere in the path\
    \ between sender and receiver.  At least one RSVP\n   aware network element resides\
    \ in the diff-serv network.  This network\n   element may be a policy enforcement\
    \ point (PEP) [RAP] or may simply\n   act as an admission control agent for the\
    \ network, admitting or\n   denying resource requests based on the availability\
    \ of resources.  In\n   either case, this network element interacts with RSVP\
    \ messages\n   arriving from outside the DS network, accepting resource requests\n\
    \   from RSVP-aware senders and receivers, and conveying the DS network's\n  \
    \ admission control and resource allocation decisions to the higher-\n   level\
    \ RSVP.  The network element is typically a router and will be\n   considered\
    \ to be so for the purpose of this document.  This model is\n   described fully\
    \ in [INTDIFF].\n"
- title: 1.1 Use of the DCLASS Object to Carry Upstream Packet Marking
  contents:
  - "1.1 Use of the DCLASS Object to Carry Upstream Packet Marking\n   Information\n\
    \   A principal usage of the DCLASS object is to carry DSCP information\n   between\
    \ a DS network and upstream nodes that may wish to mark packets\n   with DSCP\
    \ values.  Briefly, the sender composes a standard RSVP PATH\n   message and sends\
    \ it towards the receiver.  At some point the PATH\n   message reaches the DS\
    \ network.  The PATH message traverses one or\n   more network elements that are\
    \ PEPs and/or admission control agents\n   for the diff-serv network.  These elements\
    \ install appropriate state\n   and forward the PATH message towards the receiver.\
    \  If admission\n   control is successful downstream of the diff-serv network,\
    \ then a\n   RESV message will arrive from the direction of the receiver.  As\
    \ this\n   message arrives at the PEPs and/or admission control agents that are\n\
    \   RSVP enabled, each of these network elements must make a decision\n   regarding\
    \ the admissibility of the signaled flow to the diff-serv\n   network.\n   If\
    \ the network element determines that the request represented by the\n   PATH\
    \ and RESV messages is admissible to the diff-serv network, the\n   appropriate\
    \ diff-serv service level (or behavior aggregate) for the\n   traffic represented\
    \ in the RSVP request is determined.  Next, a\n   decision is made to mark arriving\
    \ data packets for this traffic\n   locally using MF classification, or to request\
    \ upstream marking of\n   the packets with the appropriate DSCP(s).  This upstream\
    \ marking\n   could occur anywhere before the DS network's ingress point.  Two\n\
    \   likely candidates are the originating sender and the egress boundary\n   router\
    \ of some upstream (DS or non-DS) network.  The decision about\n   where the RSVP\
    \ request's packets should be marked can be made by\n   agreement or through a\
    \ negotiation protocol; the details are outside\n   the scope of this document.\n\
    \   If the packets for this RSVP request are to be marked upstream,\n   information\
    \ about the DSCP(s) to use must be conveyed from the RSVP-\n   aware network element\
    \ to the upstream marking point.  This\n   information is conveyed with the DCLASS\
    \ object.  To do this, the\n   network element adds a DCLASS object containing\
    \ one or more DSCPs\n   corresponding to the behavior aggregate, to the RESV message.\
    \  The\n   RESV message is then sent upstream towards the RSVP sender.\n   If\
    \ the network element determines that the RSVP request is not\n   admissible to\
    \ the diff-serv network, it sends a RESV error message\n   towards the receiver.\
    \  No DCLASS is required.\n"
- title: 1.1 Additional Uses of the DCLASS Object
  contents:
  - "1.1 Additional Uses of the DCLASS Object\n   The DCLASS object is intended to\
    \ be a general tool for conveying DSCP\n   information in RSVP messages.  This\
    \ may be useful in a number of\n   situations.  We give one further example here\
    \ as motivation.\n   In this example, we assume that the decision about the appropriate\n\
    \   behavior aggregate for a RSVP-mediated traffic flow is made at the DS\n  \
    \ network egress router (or a related Policy Decision Point) by\n   observing\
    \ RSVP PATH and RESV messages and other necessary\n   information.  However, the\
    \ actual packet marking must be done at the\n   ingress of the network. The DCLASS\
    \ object can be used to carry the\n   needed marking information between egress\
    \ and ingress routers.\n"
- title: 2. Format of the DCLASS Object
  contents:
  - "2. Format of the DCLASS Object\n   The DCLASS object has the following format:\n\
    \            0       |       1       |       2       |       3\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \    |      Length (>= 8)            |   C-Num (225) |      1        |\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \    |          Unused                               | 1st DSCP  |   |\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \    |          Unused                               | 2nd DSCP  |   |\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \    |          Unused                               | . . . .   |   |\n    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   The first word contains the standard RSVP object header (the Class\n   Num\
    \ for the DCLASS object is 225).  The length field indicates the\n   total object\
    \ length in bytes.  The object header is followed by one\n   or more 32-bit words,\
    \ each containing a DSCP in the six high-order\n   bits of the least significant\
    \ byte.  The length field in the object\n   header indicates the number of DSCPs\
    \ included in the object.\n   Specifically, the number of DCLASS objects present\
    \ is equal to\n   (Length - 4) / 4.\n   The network may return multiple DSCPs\
    \ in the DCLASS object in order\n   to enable the host to discriminate sub-flows\
    \ within a behavior\n   aggregate. For example, in the case of the AF PHB group\
    \ [AF], the\n   network may return the DSCPs 001010, 001100, and 001110 corresponding\n\
    \   to increasing levels of drop precedence within Class 1 of the AF PHB\n   group.\
    \  Note that this document makes no statements regarding the\n   significance\
    \ of the order of the returned DSCPs.  Further\n   interpretation of DSCP sets\
    \ is dependent on the specific service\n   requested by the host and is beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Note that the Class-Num for the DCLASS object\
    \ is chosen from the\n   space of unknown class objects that should be ignored\
    \ and forwarded\n   by nodes that do not recognize it.  This is to assure maximal\n\
    \   backward compatibility.\n"
- title: 3. Admission Control Functionality
  contents:
  - "3. Admission Control Functionality\n   From a black-box perspective, admission\
    \ control and policy\n   functionality amounts to the decision whether to accept\
    \ or reject a\n   request and the determination of the DSCPs that should be used\
    \ for\n   the corresponding traffic.  The specific details of admission control\n\
    \   are beyond the scope of this document.  In general the admission\n   control\
    \ decision is based both on resource availability and on\n   policies regarding\
    \ the use of resources in the diff-serv network.\n   The admission control decision\
    \ made by RSVP aware network elements\n   represents both considerations.\n  \
    \ In order to decide whether the RSVP request is admissible in terms of\n   resource\
    \ availability, one or more network elements within or at the\n   boundary of\
    \ the diff-serv network must understand the impact that\n   admission would have\
    \ on specific diff-serv resources, as well as the\n   availability of these resources\
    \ along the relevant data path in the\n   diff-serv network.\n   In order to decide\
    \ whether the RSVP request is admissible in terms of\n   policy, the network element\
    \ may use identity objects describing users\n   and/or applications that may be\
    \ included in the request.  The router\n   may act as a PEP/PDP and use data from\
    \ a policy database or directory\n   to aid in this decision.\n   See Appendix\
    \ A for a simple mechanism for configurable resource based\n   admission control.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The DCLASS object conveys information that can\
    \ be used to request\n   enhanced QoS from a DS network, so inappropriate modification\
    \ of the\n   object could allow traffic flows to obtain a higher or lower level\
    \ of\n   QoS than appropriate.  Particularly, modification of a DCLASS object\n\
    \   by a third party inserted between the DS network ingress node and the\n  \
    \ upstream marker constitutes a possible denial of service attack.\n   This attack\
    \ is subtle because it is possible to reduce the received\n   QoS to an unacceptably\
    \ low level without completely cutting off data\n   flow, making the attack harder\
    \ to detect.\n   The possibility of raising the received level of QoS by inappropriate\n\
    \   modification of the DCLASS object is less significant because it a\n   subclass\
    \ of a larger class of attacks that must already be detected\n   by the system.\
    \  Protection must already be in place to prevent a host\n   raising its received\
    \ level of QoS by simply guessing \"good\" DSCP's\n   and marking packets accordingly.\
    \  If this protection is at the\n   boundary of the DS network, it will detect\
    \ inappropriate marking of\n   arriving packets caused by modified DCLASS objects\
    \ as well.  If,\n   however, the protection function as well as the marking function\
    \ has\n   been pushed upstream (perhaps to a trusted third party or\n   intermediate\
    \ node), correct transmission of the DCLASS object must be\n   ensured to prevent\
    \ a possible theft of service attack.\n   Simple observation of the DCLASS object\
    \ in a RSVP message raises\n   several issues which may be seen as security concerns.\
    \  Correlation\n   of observed DCLASS object values with RSVP requests or MF\n\
    \   classification parameters allows the observer to determine that\n   different\
    \ flows are receiving different levels of QoS, which may be\n   knowledge that\
    \ should be protected in some environments.  Similarly,\n   observation of the\
    \ DCLASS object can allow the observer to determine\n   that a single flow's QoS\
    \ has been promoted or demoted, which may\n   signal significant events in the\
    \ life of that flow's application or\n   user.  Finally, observation of the DCLASS\
    \ object may reveal\n   information about the internal operations of a DS network\
    \ that could\n   be useful to observers interested in theft-of-services attacks.\n"

    \ Each row has the following format:\n      Intserv service type : DSCP\n   The\

    \ one for Controlled Load service and one for Best-\n   Effort service.  (The\
    \ best-effort service will typically map to DSCP\n   000000, but may be overridden).\
    \  It should be possible to add rows\n   for as-yet-undefined service types.\n\
    \   This table allows the network administrator to statically configure a\n  \
    \ DSCP that the router will return in the DCLASS object for an admitted\n   RSVP\
    \ request.  In general, more sophisticated and likely more dynamic\n   mechanisms\
    \ may be used to determine the DSCP to be returned in the\n   DCLASS object. \
    \ Also, it is likely that a real mapping for some\n   services would use more\
