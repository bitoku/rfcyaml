- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines new cipher suites that provide Pre-Shared\
    \ Key\n   (PSK) authentication, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and\n   Authenticated\
    \ Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  The cipher\n   suites are defined for\
    \ version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS) protocol [RFC5246] and\
    \ version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport\n   Layer Security (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347].\n\
    \   PSK authentication is widely used in many scenarios.  One deployment\n   is\
    \ 3GPP networks where pre-shared keys are used to authenticate both\n   subscriber\
    \ and network.  Another deployment is Internet of Things\n   where PSK authentication\
    \ is often preferred for performance and\n   energy efficiency reasons.  In both\
    \ scenarios, the endpoints are\n   owned and/or controlled by a party that provisions\
    \ the pre-shared\n   keys and makes sure that they provide a high level of entropy.\n\
    \   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a strongly recommended feature in\n   security\
    \ protocol design and can be accomplished by using an\n   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman\
    \ key exchange method.  Ephemeral Elliptic\n   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) provides\
    \ PFS with excellent performance\n   and small key sizes.  ECDHE is mandatory\
    \ to implement in both HTTP/2\n   [RFC7540] and the Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP) [RFC7252].\n   AEAD algorithms that combine encryption and integrity\
    \ protection are\n   strongly recommended for (D)TLS [RFC7525], and TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]\n\
    \   forbids the use of non-AEAD algorithms.  The AEAD algorithms\n   considered\
    \ in this document are AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  The use of\n   AES-GCM in TLS is\
    \ defined in [RFC5288], and the use of AES-CCM is\n   defined in [RFC6655].\n\
    \   [RFC4279] defines PSK cipher suites for TLS but does not consider\n   elliptic\
    \ curve cryptography.  [RFC8422] introduces elliptic curve\n   cryptography for\
    \ TLS but does not consider PSK authentication.\n   [RFC5487] describes the use\
    \ of AES-GCM in combination with PSK\n   authentication but does not consider\
    \ ECDHE.  [RFC5489] describes the\n   use of PSK in combination with ECDHE but\
    \ does not consider AES-GCM or\n   AES-CCM.\n"

- title: 3.  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites
  contents:
  - "3.  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites\n   The cipher suites defined\
    \ in this document are based on the following\n   AES-GCM and AES-CCM AEAD algorithms:\
    \ AEAD_AES_128_GCM [RFC5116],\n   AEAD_AES_256_GCM [RFC5116], AEAD_AES_128_CCM\
    \ [RFC5116], and\n   AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC6655].\n   Messages and premaster\
    \ secret construction in this document are\n   defined in [RFC5489].  The ServerKeyExchange\
    \ and ClientKeyExchange\n   messages are used, and the premaster secret is computed\
    \ as for the\n   ECDHE_PSK key exchange.  The elliptic curve parameters used in\
    \ the\n   Diffie-Hellman parameters are negotiated using extensions defined in\n\
    \   [RFC8422].\n   For TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2, the following cipher suites are defined:\n\
    \   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x01}\n   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\
    \   = {0xD0,0x02}\n   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 = {0xD0,0x03}\n\
    \   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x05}\n   The assigned code\
    \ points can only be used for TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2.\n   The cipher suites defined\
    \ in this document MUST NOT be negotiated for\n   any version of (D)TLS other\
    \ than version 1.2.  Servers MUST NOT\n   select one of these cipher suites when\
    \ selecting a (D)TLS version\n   other than version 1.2.  A client MUST treat\
    \ the selection of these\n   cipher suites in combination with a different version\
    \ of (D)TLS as an\n   error and generate a fatal 'illegal_parameter' TLS alert.\n\
    \   Cipher suites TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,\n   TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256,\
    \ and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 are used to\n   support equivalent functionality\
    \ in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246],\
    \ DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347],\n   PSK Ciphersuites for TLS [RFC4279], ECDHE_PSK [RFC5489],\
    \ AES-GCM\n   [RFC5288], and AES-CCM [RFC6655] apply to this document as well.\n\
    \   All the cipher suites defined in this document provide\n   confidentiality,\
    \ mutual authentication, and forward secrecy.  The\n   AES-128 cipher suites provide\
    \ 128-bit security, and the AES-256\n   cipher suites provide at least 192-bit\
    \ security.  However,\n   AES_128_CCM_8 only provides 64-bit security against\
    \ message forgery.\n   The pre-shared keys used for authentication MUST have a\
    \ security\n   level equal to or higher than the cipher suite used, i.e., at least\n\
    \   128-bit security for the AES-128 cipher suites and at least 192-bit\n   security\
    \ for the AES-256 cipher suites.\n   GCM or CCM encryption that reuses a nonce\
    \ with a same key undermines\n   the security of GCM and CCM.  As a result, GCM\
    \ and CCM MUST only be\n   used with a system guaranteeing nonce uniqueness [RFC5116].\n"
