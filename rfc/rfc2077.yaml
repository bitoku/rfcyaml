  - "Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to propose an update to Internet\
    \ RFC 2045\n   to include a new primary content-type to be known as \"model\"\
    . RFC\n   2045 [1] describes mechanisms for specifying and describing the\n  \
    \ format of Internet Message Bodies via content-type/subtype pairs. We\n   believe\
    \ that \"model\" defines a fundamental type of content with\n   unique presentational,\
    \ hardware, and processing aspects.  Various\n   subtypes of this primary type\
    \ are immediately anticipated but will be\n   covered under separate documents.\n"

    \   will not directly deal with the intended subtypes since those will be\n  \
    \ covered by their separate registrations.  Some immediately expected\n   subtypes\

    \ definition,\n   intended eventually to form a standard accepted extension to\

    \  viewer software and hardware, those involved in MIME transport, and\n   decoders.\n"
- title: 2. Definition of a model
  contents:
  - "2. Definition of a model\n   A model primary MIME type is an electronically exchangeable\n\
    \   behavioral or physical representation within a given domain.  Each\n   subtype\
    \ in the model structure has unique features, just as does each\n   subtype in\
    \ the other primary types.  The important fact is that these\n   various subtypes\
    \ can be converted between each other with less loss\n   of information then to\
    \ that of other primary types.  This fact groups\n   these subtypes together into\
    \ the model primary type.  All of the\n   expected subtypes have several features\
    \ in common and that are unique\n   to this primary type.\n   To loosely summarize:\
    \ models are multidimensional structures composed\n   of one or more objects.\
    \  If there are multiple objects then one\n   object defines the arrangement/setting/relationship\
    \ of the others.\n   These objects all have calibrated coordinate systems but\
    \ these\n   systems need not be in the same units nor need they have the same\n\
    \   dimensionality.  In detail:\n   1. have 3 or more dimensions which are bases\
    \ of the system and\n      form an orthogonal system (any orthogonal system is\
    \ sufficient).\n      This system is specifically defined in terms of an orthogonal\n\
    \      set of basis functions [for a subspace of the L^2 function space]\n   \
    \   over a coordinate system of dimension 3 or more. Note that this\n      does\
    \ not preclude regular skewed systems, elliptical coordinates,\n      different\
    \ vector spaces, etc.\n   2. contain a structural relationship between model elements.\n\
    \   3. have scaling or calibration factors which are related to physical\n   \
    \   units (force, momentum, time, velocity, acceleration, size, etc.).\n     \
    \ Thus, an IGES file will specify a building of non-arbitrary size,\n      computational\
    \ meshes and VRML models will have real spatial/\n      temporal units. This allows\
    \ for differing elements to be combined\n      non-arbitrarily.\n   4. Models\
    \ can be single objects or composed of a collection of\n      objects.  These\
    \ normally independent objects are arranged\n      in a master/slave scenario\
    \ so that one object acts as the\n      reference, or primary object, which defines\
    \ how the other\n      objects interrelate and behave.  This allows for the creation\n\
    \      of mathematical, physical, economic, behavioral, etc. models\n      which\
    \ typically are composed of different elements.  The key is\n      in the description:\
    \ these types describe how something\n      \"behaves\"; contrasted to typical\
    \ data types which describe\n      how something \"is\".\n      The inclusion\
    \ of this \"collective\" system works similar to the\n      Email system's multipart/related\
    \ type which defines the actions\n      of the individual parts.  Further specification\
    \ of the model/*\n      subtypes utilizing these properties is left to the subtype\n\
    \      authors.\n   With these assumptions:\n   a. the default dimensionality\
    \ will be spatial and temporal (but\n      any are allowed).\n   b. it is presumed\
    \ that models will contain underlying structure\n      which may or may not be\
    \ immediately available to the\n      user. (fluid dynamics vector fields, electromagnetic\n\
    \      propagation, interrelated IGES dimensional specifiers, VRML\n      materials\
    \ and operators, etc.)\n   c. it is assumed that basis set conversion between\
    \ model domains\n      is lossless.  The interpretation of the data may change\
    \ but\n      the specification will not.  i.e. convert the model of the\n    \
    \  U.S.A.  Gross Domestic Product into a VRML model and navigate\n      it to\
    \ explore the variances and interrelationships.  The model\n      has many dimensions\
    \ but also \"passages\" and \"corridors\"\n      linking different parts of it.\
    \  A similar situation is true\n      for meshes and CAD files. The key is identifying\
    \ the basis set\n      conversion which makes sense.\n   d. models are grouped\
    \ to assure LESS loss of information between\n      the model subtypes than to\
    \ subtypes of other primary\n      types. (i.e.  converting a chemical model into\
    \ an image is\n      more lossy than concerting it into a VRML model).\n   Items\
    \ c and d above define the grouping for model similar to the way\n   that \"images\"\
    \ and \"videos\" are grouped together; to assure less loss\n   of information.\
    \  Obviously converting from a GIF image to a JPEG\n   image looses less information\
    \ than converting from a GIF image to an\n   AU audio file.\n"

  - "3.  Consultation Mechanisms\n   Before proposing a subtype for the model/* primary\

    \   Additional consultations with the authors of the existing model/*\n   subtypes\

    \ digests for the existing model/* subtypes may be\n   referenced in the respective\
    \ documents.\n   The mesh community presently has numerous different mesh geometries\n\
    \   as part of different packages.  Freely available libraries need to be\n  \
    \ advertised more than they have been in the past to spur the\n   development\
    \ of interoperable packages.  It is hoped that by following\n   the example of\
    \ the VRML community and creating a freely available\n   comprehensive library\
    \ of input/output functions for meshes [11] that\n   this problem will be alleviated\
    \ for the mesh community.  A freely\n   available mesh viewer conforming to these\
    \ standards is available now\n   for various platforms.  Consulations with the\
    \ authors of the mesh\n   system,\n            http://www-dsed.llnl.gov/documents/tests/mesh.html\n\
    \   will be beneficial.\n   The IGES community has a suite of tests and conformance\

    \ are\n   encouraged to seek those out from NIST [14].\n"

  - "4. Encoding and Transport\n   a. Unrecognized subtypes of model should at a minimum\
    \ be treated\n      as \"application/octet-stream\".  Implementations may optionally\n\

  - "8.1 Appendix A -- extraneous details about expected subtypes\n VRML Data Types\n\
    \   The 3D modeling and CAD communities use a number of file formats to\n   represent\
    \ 3D models, these formats are widely used to exchange\n   information, and full,\
    \ or lossy, converters between the formats exist\n   both independently and integrated\
    \ into widely used applications. The\n   VRML format is rapidly becoming a standard\
    \ for the display of 3D\n   information on the WWW.\n Mesh Data Types\n   For\
    \ many decades, finite element and finite difference time domain\n   codes have\
    \ generated mesh structures which attempt to use the\n   physical geometry of\
    \ the structures in connection with various\n   physics packages to generate real\
    \ world simulations of events\n   including electromagnetic wave propagation,\
    \ fluid dynamics, motor\n   design, etc.  The resulting output data is then post\
    \ processed to\n   examine the results in a variety of forms.  This proposed mesh\n\
    \   subtype will include both geometry and scalar/vector/tensor results\n   data.\
    \  An important point to note is that many modern meshes are\n   generated from\
    \ solids constructed using CAD packages.\n   Motivation for mesh grew out of discussions\
    \ with other communities\n   about their design requirements.  Many CAD or scene\
    \ descriptions are\n   composed of a small number of complex objects while computational\n\
    \   meshes are composed of large numbers of simple objects.  A 1,000,000\n   element\
    \ 3D mesh is small.  A 100,000,000 element 3D structured mesh\n   is large.  Each\
    \ object can also have an arbitrary amount of\n   associated data and the mesh\
    \ connectivity information is important in\n   optimizing usage of the mesh. \
    \ Also, the mesh itself is usually\n   uninteresting but postprocessing packages\
    \ may act on the underlying\n   data or a computational engine may process the\
    \ data as input.\n   Meshes differ principally from other kinds of scenes in that\
    \ meshes\n   are composed of a large number of simple objects which may contain\n\
    \   arbitrary non-spatial parameters, not all of whom need be visible,\n   and\
    \ who have an implicit connectivity and neighbor list.  This latter\n   point\
    \ is the key feature of a mesh. It should be noted that most\n   meshes are generated\
    \ from CAD files however.  The mesh type has\n   association functions because\
    \ the underlying physics was used to\n   calculate the interaction (if you crash\
    \ a car into a telephone pole,\n   you get a crumpled car and a bent pole).  Most\
    \ interesting\n   computational meshes are 4D with additional multidimensional\
    \ results\n   components.\n IGES CAD Data Types\n   (The following text, reproduced\
    \ for reference purposes only, is from\n   \"U.S. Product Data Association and\
    \ IGES/PDES Organization Reference\n   Manual,\" June 1995; by permission.)\n\
    \   IGES, the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, defines a neutral\n   data\
    \ format that allows for the digital exchange of information among\n   computer-aided\
    \ design (CAD) systems.\n   CAD systems are in use today in increasing numbers\
    \ for applications\n   in all phases of the design, analysis, and manufacture\
    \ and testing of\n   products. Since the designer may use one supplier's system\
    \ while the\n   contractor and subcontractor may use other systems, there is a\
    \ need\n   to be able to exchange data digitally among all CAD systems.\n   The\
    \ databases of CAD systems from different vendors often represent\n   the same\
    \ CAD constructs differently. A circular arc on one system may\n   be defined\
    \ by a center point, its starting point and end point, while\n   on another it\
    \ is defined by its center, its diameter starting and\n   ending angle. IGES enables\
    \ the exchange of such data by providing, in\n   the public domain, a neutral\
    \ definition and format for the exchange\n   of such data.\n   Using IGES, the\
    \ user can exchange product data models in the form of\n   wireframe, surface,\
    \ or solid representations as well as surface\n   representations. Translators\
    \ convert a vendor's proprietary internal\n   database format into the neutral\
    \ IGES format and from the IGES format\n   into another vendor's internal database.\
    \ The translators, called pre-\n   and post-processors, are usually available\
    \ from vendors as part of\n   their product lines.\n   Applications supported\
    \ by IGES include traditional engineering\n   drawings as well as models for analysis\
    \ and/or various manufacturing\n   functions. In addition to the general specification,\
    \ IGES also\n   includes application protocols in which the standard is interpreted\n\
    \   to meet discipline specific requirements.\n   IGES technology assumes that\
    \ a person is available on the receiving\n   end to interpret the meaning of the\
    \ product model data. For instance,\n   a person is needed to determine how many\
    \ holes are in the part\n   because the hole itself is not defined. It is represented\
    \ in IGES by\n   its component geometry and therefore, is indistinguishable from\
    \ the\n   circular edges of a rod.\n   The IGES format has been registered with\
    \ the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) as a Multipurpose Internet\
    \ Mail Extension\n   (MIME) type \"application/iges\". The use of the message\
    \ type/subtype\n   in Internet messages facilitates the uniform recognition of\
    \ an IGES\n   file for routing to a viewer or translator.\n   Version 1.0 of the\
    \ specification was adopted as an American National\n   Standards (ANS Y14.26M-1981)\
    \ in November of 1981. Versions 3.0 and\n   4.0 of the specification have subsequently\
    \ been approved by ANSI. The\n   current version of IGES 5.2 was approved by ANSI\
    \ under the new\n   guidelines of the U.S. Product Data Association. Under these\n\
    \   guidelines, the IGES/PDES Organization (IPO) became the accredited\n   standards\
    \ body for product data exchange standards. This latest\n   standard is USPRO/IPO-100-1993.\n"
