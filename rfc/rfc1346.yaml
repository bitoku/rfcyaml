  - "0. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY\n   This paper gives reasons for wanting better sharing\
    \ mechanisms for\n   networks.  It concludes that the challenge of sharing network\n\
    \   resources (and for example intercontinental link resources) between\n   groups\
    \ of users is neither well understood, nor well catered for in\n   terms of tools\
    \ for those responsible for managing the services.  The\n   situation is compared\
    \ with other fields, both inside and outside IT,\n   and examples are cited. Recommendations\
    \ for further work are made.\n   The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion\
    \ on particular\n   challenges in large service networks in general, and the\n\
    \   International IP Internet in particular.  No solution discussed in\n   this\
    \ document is intended as a standard.  Rather, it is hoped that a\n   general\
    \ consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solutions,\n   leading eventually\
    \ to the adoption of standards.\n   The structure of the paper is as follows:\n\

  contents:
  - "1. FINDINGS\n   Issues arising from contention in the use of networks are not\n\
    \   unusual.  Once connectivity and reliability have been addressed to a\n   reasonable\
    \ level, bandwidth becomes (or appears to become?) the main\n   issue.  Usage\
    \ appears to have a strong tendency to rise to fill the\n   resources available\
    \ (fully in line with the principles of Parkinson's\n   Law).  Line-speed upgrades\
    \ have an effect, but with no guarantee of\n   permanently alleviating the problem.\
    \  Line-speeds are increasing as\n   technology improves over time, but the variations\
    \ on matters like\n   availability and funding are wide, and users remain avaricious.\n\
    \   Often the situation can appear worse than having to survive in a\n   jungle,\
    \ in the sense that the strong (even if \"good\") seem to have\n   little advantage\
    \ over the weak.  It may seem that it is the\n   determined person rather than\
    \ the important work that gets service.\n   Most people will have experienced\
    \ poor service on an overloaded\n   network at some time. To help the end-users,\
    \ it seems on the face of\n   it that one must help the IT Service Manager he\
    \ relates to.  Examples\n   relating to the relationship between the network manager\
    \ and his\n   customers, IT Service Managers at institutions connecting to his\n\
    \   network, include the following:\n   (a) If the IT Service Manager finds his\
    \ link to the Network Manager's\n   network overloaded, he may be offered a link\
    \ upgrade, probably with a\n   cost estimate.  He might prefer control mechanisms\
    \ whereby he can say\n   that department X deserves more resources than department\
    \ Y, or that\n   interactive terminal use takes preference over file transfers,\
    \ or\n   that user U is more important than user V.\n   (b) Where an IT Service\
    \ Manager is sharing a link, he will commonly\n   get more than his institution's\
    \ share of the link, and often get very\n   good value-for-money compared to using\
    \ a dedicated link, but he has\n   no guarantee that his end-users' usage won't\
    \ get swamped by the use\n   of other (perhaps much larger) partners on the shared\
    \ link.  This\n   could be seen as wishing to have a guaranteed minimum share\
    \ according\n   to some parameter(s).\n   (c) On a shared link as under (b), the\
    \ Network Manager may wish to\n   ensure that usage of the link (which might be\
    \ a high-performance\n   trunk line on a network or an international link for\
    \ example) by any\n   one partner is \"reasonable\" in relation perhaps to his\
    \ contribution\n   to the costs.  In contrast to (b), the Network Manager is wishing\
    \ to\n   impose a maximum value on some parameter(s).  He may be happy if the\n\
    \   width of the IT Service Manager's access link is not greater than his\n  \
    \ share of the shared link (assuming the measure agreed on is \"width\"),\n  \
    \ but this will commonly not be the case.  To be able to reach\n   agreement,\
    \ the Network Manager and the IT Service Manager may need\n   options on the choice\
    \ of parameters, and perhaps a choice on the\n   means of control, as well as\
    \ being able to negotiate about values.\n   In circumstances where the Network\
    \ Manager can exercise such controls\n   over his customers, the IT Service Managers\
    \ may say with some feeling\n   and perhaps with justification, that if they are\
    \ going to be\n   controlled can the Network Manager please provide tools whereby\
    \ they\n   can arrange for the onward sharing of the resource they have, and\n\
    \   thence onwards down the hierarchy to the end-users.\n   (d) It may be Network\
    \ Manager A has a link that Network Manager B\n   would like to use on occasion,\
    \ perhaps as back-up on access to a\n   third network.  Network Manager A might\
    \ well wish to be\n   accommodating, perhaps as examples because of financial\
    \ benefit or\n   perhaps because of the possibility of a reciprocal arrangement.\n\
    \   However, the fear of overload affecting normal use and the lack of\n   control\
    \ over the usage militates against arrangements that the\n   parties could be\
    \ quite keen to make.\n   Such challenges are very far from being unique to networking.\n\
    \   Government and both public and private organisations and companies\n   allocate\
    \ budgets (and resources other than money), control and\n   account for usage,\
    \ recognising the possibility of overdrawing and\n   borrowing.  In times of shortage,\
    \ food is rationed.  I haven't\n   checked this out, but it would surprise me\
    \ if Jerry Hall wasn't\n   guaranteed a ticket for any Rolling Stones concert,\
    \ should she wish\n   to attend.\n   The charging factor influences use but does\
    \ not control it (except\n   perhaps in unusual circumstances where say payment\
    \ was expected in\n   advance and usage was cut off when the money ran out).\n\
    \   In the IT world, multi-user hosts have filestore control systems; one\n  \
    \ that I use has an overdraft facility with no penalty for not having a\n   prior\
    \ arrangement!  There are also system designs and implementations\n   for sharing\
    \ host processor time with more sophistication than just\n   counting seconds\
    \ and chopping people off; this problem seems to me to\n   be reasonably well\
    \ understood.  (Library catalogue searches under\n   author \"John Larmouth\"\
    \ should provide some references for those who\n   require convincing.)  Some\
    \ multi-user hosts have controls of sorts on\n   terminal connections.  On the\
    \ other hand, I am not aware of any\n   control system in operation that can guarantee\
    \ multi-user host\n   response time even outside the network context among directly\n\
    \   connected terminals.\n   The various roles bring different interests to bear.\
    \  A provider will\n   not necessarily see it in his interests to control usage,\
    \ or (perhaps\n   even more likely) to provide customers with control tools, since\
    \ the\n   lack of these may encourage - or even oblige - the customer to buy\n\
    \   more.  Even if the IT Service Manager can deal with the issue of who\n   or\
    \ what is important, and the issues of the relative importance of\n   allocating\
    \ resources against requests, other issues like social\n   acceptability may arise\
    \ to complicate his life.  For example it may\n   be generally agreed (and perhaps\
    \ the network manager instructed) that\n   \"everyone\" must be able to do a small\
    \ amount of work at any time,\n   perhaps to do some housekeeping or seek information.\n\
    \   Time is an important factor.  Network resources, like computer\n   processor\
    \ time and unlike filestore, vanish if they are not used.\n   People will in general\
    \ prefer resources during prime shift to those\n   in the middle of their night;\
    \ however, in global terms the middle of\n   their night can be during prime shift\
    \ somewhere along their path of\n   usage.\n   What's to do?  Splitting lines\
    \ with multiplexers is rather\n   inflexible, and may well militate against the\
    \ benefits of resource-\n   sharing that give rise commonly to link-sharing arrangements.\
    \  Some\n   technologies:\n      - have the ability to treat (or at least mark)\
    \ traffic as of high\n        priority, for example where it gives emergency or\
    \ status\n        information;\n      - (in the case of X.25(84), I understand\
    \ from my JNT colleague Ian\n        Smith,) have throughput class (section 6.13)\
    \ and transit delay\n        (section 6.27).  (Ian tells me that it is in his\
    \ view far from\n        clear how practical these facilities are);\n      - may\
    \ be able to discriminate between traffic on grounds of\n        network source\
    \ address;\n      - may be able to discriminate between traffic on grounds of\n\
    \        network destination address;\n      - may be able to discriminate between\
    \ traffic on grounds of\n        application protocol, perhaps giving preference\
    \ to interactive\n        terminal traffic, or making a choice between preference\
    \ for\n        email and for file transfer traffic;\n      - may be able to discriminate\
    \ between traffic on grounds of other\n        facets of network protocol or traffic.\n\
    \   In practice, one may well not have adequate tools in these or other\n   terms,\
    \ and one may well have to ignore the challenges of resource\n   control, and\
    \ either ignore the issue or refuse service.\n"

  - "2. CONCLUSIONS\n      2.1 There seems to be a lack of tools to enable the controlling\n\
    \      and the sharing of networks and links.  This is militating against\n  \
    \    the cooperative sharing of resources, and restricting the ability\n     \
    \ of organisations to do business with one another.\n      2.2 Further, the definition\
    \ of what constitutes a share, or what\n      parameter of service one would try\
    \ to measure and control (or what\n      the choices are if any), is not clear.\n\
    \      2.3 Following from that, it is then not clear whether what is\n      needed\
    \ is new or enhanced protocols/services, new or enhanced\n      procurement specifications\
    \ or profiles, or new or enhanced\n      networking products or tools.\n     \
    \ 2.4 Service providers (more likely the public carriers or but also\n      some\
    \ Network Managers) may see it as against their interests to\n      provide controlling\
    \ tools if they see them as tending to constrain\n      usage and hence reducing\
    \ income.  If so, they may not support, and\n      may even oppose, progress in\
    \ the area.  However, they might be\n      persuaded that the provision of such\
    \ tools might give them\n      competitive edge over their rivals, and therefore\
    \ to support\n      appropriate projects and developments.\n"
