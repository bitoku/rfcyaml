  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SMTP [RFC5321] STARTTLS service extension [RFC3207]
    provides a\n   means by which an SMTP server and client can establish a Transport\n
    \  Layer Security (TLS) protected session for the transmission of email\n   messages.
    \ By default, TLS is used only upon mutual agreement\n   (successful negotiation)
    of STARTTLS between the client and server;\n   if this is not possible, the message
    is sent without transport\n   encryption.  Furthermore, it is common practice
    for the client to\n   negotiate TLS even if the SMTP server's certificate is invalid.\n
    \  Policy mechanisms such as DANE [RFC7672] and MTA-STS [RFC8461] may\n   impose
    requirements for the use of TLS for email destined for some\n   domains.  However,
    such policies do not allow the sender to specify\n   which messages are more sensitive
    and require transport-level\n   encryption and which ones are less sensitive and
    ought to be relayed\n   even if TLS cannot be negotiated successfully.\n   The
    default opportunistic nature of SMTP TLS enables several on-the-\n   wire attacks
    on SMTP security between MTAs.  These include passive\n   eavesdropping on connections
    for which TLS is not used, interference\n   in the SMTP protocol to prevent TLS
    from being negotiated (presumably\n   accompanied by eavesdropping), and insertion
    of a man-in-the-middle\n   attacker exploiting the lack of server authentication
    by the client.\n   Attacks are described in more detail in the Security Considerations\n
    \  section of this document.\n   REQUIRETLS consists of two mechanisms: an SMTP
    service extension and\n   a message header field.  The service extension is used
    to specify\n   that a given message sent during a particular session MUST be sent\n
    \  over a TLS-protected session with specified security characteristics.\n   It
    also requires that the SMTP server advertise that it supports\n   REQUIRETLS,
    in effect promising that it will honor the requirement to\n   enforce TLS transmission
    and REQUIRETLS support for onward\n   transmission of those messages.\n   The
    TLS-Required message header field is used to convey a request to\n   ignore recipient-side
    policy mechanisms such as MTA-STS and DANE,\n   thereby prioritizing delivery
    over ability to negotiate TLS.  Unlike\n   the service extension, the TLS-Required
    header field allows the\n   message to transit through one or more MTAs that do
    not support\n   REQUIRETLS.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  The REQUIRETLS Service Extension\n   The REQUIRETLS SMTP service extension
    has the following\n   characteristics:\n   1.  The textual name of the extension
    is \"Require TLS\".\n   2.  The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension
    is\n       \"REQUIRETLS\".\n   3.  No additional SMTP verbs are defined by this
    extension.\n   4.  One optional parameter (\"REQUIRETLS\") is added to the MAIL
    FROM\n       command by this extension.  No value is associated with this\n       parameter.\n
    \  5.  The maximum length of a MAIL FROM command line is increased by 11\n       octets
    by the possible addition of a space and the REQUIRETLS\n       keyword.\n   6.
    \ One new SMTP status code is defined by this extension to convey\n       an error
    condition resulting from failure of the client to send\n       data to a server
    that does not also support the REQUIRETLS\n       extension.\n   7.  The REQUIRETLS
    extension is valid for message relay [RFC5321],\n       submission [RFC6409],
    and the Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP)\n       [RFC2033].\n   8.  The ABNF
    syntax for the MAIL FROM parameter is as follows:\n      requiretls-param  = \"REQUIRETLS\"\n
    \                     ; where requiretls-param is an instance of an\n                      ;
    esmtp-param used in Mail-parameters in\n                      ; RFC 5321, Section
    4.1.2. There is no esmtp-value\n                      ; associated with requiretls-param.\n
    \  In order to specify REQUIRETLS treatment for a given message, the\n   REQUIRETLS
    option is specified in the MAIL FROM command when that\n   message is transmitted.
    \ This option MUST only be specified in the\n   context of an SMTP session meeting
    the security requirements of\n   REQUIRETLS:\n   *  The session itself MUST employ
    TLS transmission.\n   *  If the SMTP server to which the message is being transmitted
    is\n      identified through an MX record lookup, its name MUST be validated\n
    \     via a DNSSEC signature on the recipient domain's MX record, or the\n      MX
    hostname MUST be validated by an MTA-STS policy as described in\n      Section
    4.1 of [RFC8461].  DNSSEC is defined in [RFC4033],\n      [RFC4034], and [RFC4035].\n
    \  *  The certificate presented by the SMTP server either MUST be\n      verified
    successfully by a trust chain leading to a certificate\n      trusted by the SMTP
    client, or it MUST be verified successfully\n      using DANE, as specified in
    [RFC7672].  For trust chains, the\n      choice of trusted (root) certificates
    is at the discretion of the\n      SMTP client.\n   *  Following the negotiation
    of STARTTLS, the SMTP server MUST\n      advertise in the subsequent EHLO response
    that it supports\n      REQUIRETLS.\n"

  - "3.  The TLS-Required Header Field\n   One new message header field [RFC5322],
    TLS-Required, is defined by\n   this specification.  It is used for messages for
    which the originator\n   requests that the recipient TLS policy (including MTA-STS
    [RFC8461]\n   and DANE [RFC7672]) be ignored.  This might be done, for example,
    to\n   report a misconfigured mail server, such as an expired TLS\n   certificate.\n
    \  The TLS-Required header field has a single REQUIRED parameter:\n   *  No -
    The SMTP client SHOULD attempt to send the message regardless\n      of its ability
    to negotiate STARTTLS with the SMTP server,\n      ignoring policy-based mechanisms
    (including MTA-STS and DANE), if\n      any, asserted by the recipient domain.
    \ Nevertheless, the client\n      SHOULD negotiate STARTTLS with the server if
    available.\n   More than one instance of the TLS-Required header field MUST NOT\n
    \  appear in a given message.\n   The ABNF syntax for the TLS-Required header
    field is as follows:\n   requiretls-field = \"TLS-Required:\" [FWS] \"No\" CRLF\n
    \          ; where requiretls-field in an instance of an\n           ; optional-field
    defined in RFC 5322, Section 3.6.8.\n   FWS = <as defined in RFC 5322>\n   CRLF

        in [RFC5321], Section 5.1.\n   2.  If the server lookup is accomplished via
        the recipient domain's\n       MX record (the usual case) and is not accompanied
        by a valid\n       DNSSEC signature, the client MUST also validate the SMTP

        \  3.  Open an SMTP session with the peer SMTP server using the EHLO\n       verb.\n

        (or the domain name in the absence of an MX record\n       where an A record
        is used directly) MUST match the DNS-ID or CN-\n       ID of the certificate
        presented by the server.\n   5.  Ensure that the response to the subsequent
        EHLO following\n       establishment of the TLS protection advertises the
        REQUIRETLS\n       capability.\n   The SMTP client SHOULD follow the recommendations
        in [RFC7525] or its\n   successor with respect to negotiation of the TLS session.\n

        and repeat steps 2-5 with each host on the recipient domain's\n   list of
        MX hosts in an attempt to find a mail path that meets the\n   sender's requirements.

        has any such messages prior to issuing\n   the QUIT.  If there are no more
        MX hosts, the client MUST NOT\n   transmit the message to the domain.\n   Following
        such a failure, the SMTP client MUST send a non-delivery\n   notification
        to the reverse-path of the failed message, as described\n   in Section 3.6
        of [RFC5321].  The following status codes [RFC5248]\n   SHOULD be used:\n

        \  *  Unable to establish TLS-protected SMTP session: 5.7.10 Encryption\n
        \     needed\n   Refer to Section 5 for further requirements regarding non-delivery\n
        \  messages.\n   If all REQUIRETLS requirements have been met, transmit the
        message,\n   issuing the REQUIRETLS option on the MAIL FROM command with the\n

        MTA MUST:\n   *  Look up the SMTP server to which the message is to be sent,
        as\n      described in [RFC5321], Section 5.1.\n   *  Open an SMTP session
        with the peer SMTP server using the EHLO\n      verb.  Attempt to negotiate
        STARTTLS if possible, and follow any\n      policy published by the recipient

  - "5.  Non-delivery Message Handling\n   Non-delivery (\"bounce\") messages usually
    contain important metadata\n   about the message to which they refer, including
    the original message\n   header.  They therefore MUST be protected in the same
    manner as the\n   original message.  All non-delivery messages resulting from
    messages\n   with the REQUIRETLS SMTP option, whether resulting from a REQUIRETLS\n
    \  error or some other issue, MUST also specify the REQUIRETLS SMTP\n   option
    unless redacted as described below.\n   The path from the origination of an error
    bounce message back to the\n   MAIL FROM address may not share the same REQUIRETLS
    support as the\n   forward path.  Therefore, users requiring TLS are advised to
    make\n   sure that they are capable of receiving mail using REQUIRETLS as\n   well.
    \ Otherwise, such non-delivery messages will be lost.\n   If a REQUIRETLS message
    is bounced, the server MUST behave as if\n   RET=HDRS was present, as described
    in [RFC3461].  If both RET=FULL\n   and REQUIRETLS are present, the RET=FULL MUST
    be disregarded.  The\n   SMTP client for a REQUIRETLS bounce message uses an empty
    MAIL FROM\n   return-path, as required by [RFC5321].  When the MAIL FROM return-\n
    \  path is empty, the REQUIRETLS parameter SHOULD NOT cause a bounce\n   message
    to be discarded even if the next-hop relay does not advertise\n   REQUIRETLS.\n
    \  Senders of messages requiring TLS are advised to consider the\n   possibility
    that bounce messages will be lost as a result of\n   REQUIRETLS return path failure

    to be transmitted with\n   REQUIRETLS.\n"

  - "6.  Reorigination Considerations\n   In a number of situations, a mediator [RFC5598]
    originates a new\n   message as a result of an incoming message.  These situations
    include\n   but are not limited to mailing lists (including administrative\n   traffic
    such as message approval requests), Sieve [RFC5228],\n   \"vacation\" responders,
    and other filters to which incoming messages\n   may be piped.  These newly originated
    messages may essentially be\n   copies of the incoming message, such as with a
    forwarding service or\n   a mailing list expander.  In other cases, such as with
    a vacation\n   message or a delivery notification, they will be different but
    might\n   contain parts of the original message or other information for which\n
    \  the original message sender wants to influence the requirement to use\n   TLS
    transmission.\n   Mediators that reoriginate messages should apply REQUIRETLS\n
    \  requirements in incoming messages (both requiring TLS transmission\n   and
    requesting that TLS not be required) to the reoriginated messages\n   to the extent
    feasible.  A limitation to this might be that for a\n   message requiring TLS,
    redistribution to multiple addresses while\n   retaining the TLS requirement could
    result in the message not being\n   delivered to some of the intended recipients.\n
    \  User-side mediators (such as use of Sieve rules on a user agent)\n   typically
    do not have access to the SMTP details and therefore may\n   not be aware of the
    REQUIRETLS requirement on a delivered message.\n   Recipients that expect sensitive
    traffic should avoid the use of\n   user-side mediators.  Alternatively, if operationally
    feasible (such\n   as when forwarding to a specific, known address), they should
    apply\n   REQUIRETLS to all reoriginated messages that do not contain the \"TLS-\n
    \  Required: No\" header field.\n"

    since messages\n   specifying the header field are less concerned with transport\n
    \  security.\n"

    - "8.1.  Passive Attacks\n   REQUIRETLS is generally effective against passive
      attackers who are\n   merely trying to eavesdrop on an SMTP exchange between
      an SMTP client\n   and server.  This assumes, of course, the cryptographic integrity
      of\n   the TLS connection being used.\n"
    title: 8.1.  Passive Attacks
  - contents:
    - "8.2.  Active Attacks\n   Active attacks against TLS-encrypted SMTP connections
      can take many\n   forms.  One such attack is to interfere in the negotiation
      by\n   changing the STARTTLS command to something illegal such as XXXXXXXX.\n
      \  This causes TLS negotiation to fail and messages to be sent in the\n   clear,
      where they can be intercepted.  REQUIRETLS detects the failure\n   of STARTTLS
      and declines to send the message rather than send it\n   insecurely.\n   A second
      form of attack is a man-in-the-middle attack where the\n   attacker terminates
      the TLS connection rather than the intended SMTP\n   server.  This is possible
      when, as is commonly the case, the SMTP\n   client either does not verify the
      server's certificate or establishes\n   the connection even when the verification
      fails.  REQUIRETLS requires\n   successful certificate validation before sending
      the message.\n   Another active attack involves the spoofing of DNS MX records
      of the\n   recipient domain.  An attacker with this capability could potentially\n
      \  cause the message to be redirected to a mail server under the\n   attacker's
      own control, which would presumably have a valid\n   certificate.  REQUIRETLS
      requires that the recipient domain's MX\n   record lookup be validated either
      using DNSSEC or via a published\n   MTA-STS policy that specifies the acceptable
      SMTP server hostname(s)\n   for the recipient domain.\n"
    title: 8.2.  Active Attacks
  - contents:
    - "8.3.  Bad-Actor MTAs\n   A bad-actor MTA along the message transmission path
      could\n   misrepresent its support of REQUIRETLS and/or actively strip\n   REQUIRETLS
      tags from messages it handles.  However, since\n   intermediate MTAs are already
      trusted with the cleartext of messages\n   they handle, and are not part of
      the threat model for transport-layer\n   security, they are also not part of
      the threat model for REQUIRETLS.\n   It should be reemphasized that since SMTP
      TLS is a transport-layer\n   security protocol, messages sent using REQUIRETLS
      are not encrypted\n   end-to-end and are visible to MTAs that are part of the
      message\n   delivery path.  Messages containing sensitive information that MTAs\n
      \  should not have access to MUST be sent using end-to-end content\n   encryption
      such as OpenPGP [RFC4880] or S/MIME [RFC8551].\n"
    title: 8.3.  Bad-Actor MTAs
  - contents:
    - "8.4.  Policy Conflicts\n   In some cases, the use of the TLS-Required header
      field may conflict\n   with a recipient domain policy expressed through the
      DANE [RFC7672]\n   or MTA-STS [RFC8461] protocols.  Although these protocols
      encourage\n   the use of TLS transport by advertising the availability of TLS,
      the\n   use of the \"TLS-Required: No\" header field represents an explicit\n
      \  decision on the part of the sender not to require the use of TLS,\n   such
      as to overcome a configuration error.  The recipient domain has\n   the ultimate
      ability to require TLS by not accepting messages when\n   STARTTLS has not been
      negotiated; otherwise, \"TLS-Required: No\" is\n   effectively directing the
      client MTA to behave as if it does not\n   support DANE or MTA-STS.\n"
