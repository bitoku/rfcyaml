  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and\
    \ addressing\n   architecture is facing challenges in inter-domain scalability,\n\
    \   mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain traffic engineering\n   [RFC4984].\
    \  The Routing Research Group (RRG) aims to design an\n   alternate architecture\
    \ to meet these challenges.  This document\n   presents a prioritized list of\
    \ design goals for the target\n   architecture.\n   These goals should be taken\
    \ as guidelines for the design and\n   evaluation of possible architectural solutions.\
    \  The expectation is\n   that these goals will be applied with good judgment.\n\
    \   The goals presented here were initially presented and discussed at\n   the\
    \ start of the RRG work on a revised routing architecture, and were\n   revisited\
    \ and finalized after the work on that architecture was\n   complete.  As such,\
    \ this represents both the goals that the RRG\n   started with, and revisions\
    \ to those goals based on our increased\n   understanding of the space.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Improved Routing Scalability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Improved Routing Scalability\n   Long experience with inter-domain routing\
    \ has shown that the global\n   BGP routing table is continuing to grow rapidly\
    \ [BGPGrowth].\n   Carrying this large amount of state in the inter-domain routing\n\
    \   protocols is expensive and places undue cost burdens on network\n   participants\
    \ that do not necessarily get value from the increases in\n   the routing table\
    \ size.  Thus, the first required goal is to provide\n   significant improvement\
    \ to the scalability of the inter-domain\n   routing subsystem.  It is strongly\
    \ desired to make the routing\n   subsystem scale independently from the growth\
    \ of the Internet user\n   population.  If there is a coupling between the size\
    \ of the user base\n   and the scale of the routing subsystem, then it will be\
    \ very\n   difficult to retain any semblance of scalability.  If a solution\n\
    \   includes support for alternative routes to support faster\n   convergence,\
    \ the alternative routes should also factor into routing\n   subsystem scalability.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Scalable Support for Traffic Engineering
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Scalable Support for Traffic Engineering\n   Traffic engineering is the\
    \ capability of directing traffic along\n   paths other than those that would\
    \ be computed by normal IGP/EGP\n   routing.  Inter-domain traffic engineering\
    \ today is frequently\n   accomplished by injecting more-specific prefixes into\
    \ the global\n   routing table, which results in a negative impact on routing\n\
    \   scalability.  The additional prefixes injected to enable traffic\n   engineering\
    \ place an added burden on the scalability of the routing\n   architecture.  At\
    \ the same time, the need for traffic engineering\n   capabilities is essential\
    \ to network operations.  Thus, a scalable\n   solution for inter-domain traffic\
    \ engineering is strongly desired.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Scalable Support for Multi-Homing
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Scalable Support for Multi-Homing\n   Multi-homing is the capability of\
    \ an organization to be connected to\n   the Internet via more than one other\
    \ organization.  The current\n   mechanism for supporting multi-homing is to let\
    \ the organization\n   advertise one prefix or multiple prefixes into the global\
    \ routing\n   system, again resulting in a negative impact on routing scalability.\n\
    \   More scalable solutions for multi-homing are strongly desired.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Decoupling Location and Identification
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Decoupling Location and Identification\n   Numerous sources have noted\
    \ that an IP address embodies both host\n   attachment point information and identification\
    \ information [IEN1].\n   This overloading has caused numerous semantic collisions\
    \ that have\n   limited the flexibility of the Internet architecture.  Therefore,\
    \ it\n   is desired that a solution separate the host location information\n \
    \  namespace from the identification namespace.\n   Caution must be taken here\
    \ to clearly distinguish the decoupling of\n   host location and identification\
    \ information, and the decoupling of\n   end-site addresses from globally routable\
    \ prefixes; the latter has\n   been proposed as one of the approaches to a scalable\
    \ routing\n   architecture.  Solutions to both problems, i.e., (1) the decoupling\n\
    \   of host location and identification information and (2) a scalable\n   global\
    \ routing system (whose solution may, or may not, depend on the\n   second decoupling)\
    \ are required, and it is required that their\n   solutions are compatible with\
    \ each other.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Scalable Support for Mobility
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Scalable Support for Mobility\n   Mobility is the capability of a host,\
    \ network, or organization to\n   change its topological connectivity with respect\
    \ to the remainder of\n   the Internet, while continuing to receive packets from\
    \ the Internet.\n   Existing mechanisms to provide mobility support include\n\
    \   1.  renumbering the mobile entity as it changes its topological\n       attachment\
    \ point(s) to the Internet;\n   2.  renumbering and creating a tunnel from the\
    \ entity's new\n       topological location back to its original location; and\n\
    \   3.  letting the mobile entity announce its prefixes from its new\n       attachment\
    \ point(s).\n   The first approach alone is considered unsatisfactory, as the\
    \ change\n   of IP address may break existing transport or higher-level\n   connections\
    \ for those protocols using IP addresses as identifiers.\n   The second requires\
    \ the deployment of a 'home agent' to keep track of\n   the mobile entity's current\
    \ location and adds overhead to the routers\n   involved, as well as adding stretch\
    \ to the path of an inbound packet.\n   Neither of the first two approaches impacts\
    \ the routing scalability.\n   The third approach, however, injects dynamic updates\
    \ into the global\n   routing system as the mobile entity moves.  Mechanisms that\
    \ help to\n   provide more efficient and scalable mobility support are desired,\n\
    \   especially when they can be coupled with security -- especially\n   privacy\
    \ -- and support topological changes at a high rate.  Ideally,\n   such mechanisms\
    \ should completely decouple mobility from routing.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Simplified Renumbering
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Simplified Renumbering\n   Today, many of the end-sites receive their IP\
    \ address assignments\n   from their Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  When\
    \ such a site\n   changes providers, for routing to scale, the site must renumber\
    \ into\n   a new address block assigned by its new ISP.  This can be costly,\n\
    \   error-prone, and painful [RFC5887].  Automated tools, once developed,\n  \
    \ are expected to provide significant help in reducing the renumbering\n   pain.\
    \  It is not expected that renumbering will be wholly automated,\n   as some manual\
    \ reconfiguration is likely to be necessary for changing\n   the last-mile link.\
    \  However, the overall cost of renumbering should\n   be drastically lowered.\n\
    \   In addition to being configured into hosts and routers, where\n   automated\
    \ renumbering tools can help, IP addresses are also often\n   used for other purposes,\
    \ such as access control lists.  They are also\n   sometimes hard-coded into applications\
    \ used in environments where\n   failure of the DNS could be catastrophic (e.g.,\
    \ certain remote\n   monitoring applications).  Although renumbering may be considered\
    \ a\n   mild inconvenience for some sites, and guidelines have been developed\n\
    \   for renumbering a network without a flag day [RFC4192], for others,\n   the\
    \ necessary changes are sufficiently difficult so as to make\n   renumbering effectively\
    \ impossible.  It is strongly desired that a\n   new architecture allow end-sites\
    \ to renumber their network with\n   significantly less disruption, or, if renumbering\
    \ can be eliminated,\n   the new architecture must demonstrate how the topology\
    \ can be\n   economically morphed to fit the addressing.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Modularity, Composability, and Seamlessness
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Modularity, Composability, and Seamlessness\n   A new routing architecture\
    \ should be modular: it should subdivide\n   into multiple composable, extensible,\
    \ and orthogonal subsystems.  The\n   interfaces between modules should be natural\
    \ and seamless, without\n   special cases or restrictions.  Similarly, the primitives\
    \ and\n   abstractions in the architecture should be suitably general, with\n\
    \   operations equally applicable to abstractions and concrete entities,\n   and\
    \ without deleterious side-effects that might hinder communication\n   between\
    \ endpoints in the Internet.  These properties are strongly\n   desired in a solution.\n\
    \   As an example, if tunneling were used as a part of a solution,\n   tunneling\
    \ should be completely transparent to both of the endpoints,\n   without requiring\
    \ new mechanisms for determining the correct maximum\n   datagram size.\n   The\
    \ resulting network should always fully approximate the current\n   best-effort\
    \ Internet connectivity model, and it should also\n   anticipate changes to that\
    \ model, e.g., for multiple differentiated\n   and/or guaranteed levels of service\
    \ in the future.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Routing Quality
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Routing Quality\n   The routing subsystem is responsible for computing\
    \ a path from any\n   point in the Internet to any other point in the Internet.\
    \  The\n   quality of the routes that are computed can be measured by a number\n\
    \   of metrics, such as convergence, stability, and stretch.\n      The stretch\
    \ factor is the maximum ratio between the length of a\n      route computed by\
    \ the routing scheme and that of a shortest path\n      connecting the same pair\
    \ of nodes [JACM89].\n   A solution is strongly desired to provide routing quality\
    \ equivalent\n   to what is available today, or better.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Routing Security
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Routing Security\n   Currently, the routing subsystem is secured through\
    \ a number of\n   protocol-specific mechanisms of varying strength and applicability.\n\
    \   Any new architecture is required to provide at least the same level\n   of\
    \ security as is deployed as of when the new architecture is\n   deployed.\n"
- title: 3.10.  Deployability
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Deployability\n   A viable solution is required to be deployable from\
    \ a technical\n   perspective.  Furthermore, given the extensive deployed base\
    \ of\n   today's Internet, a solution is required to be incrementally\n   deployable.\
    \  This implies that a solution must continue to support\n   those functions in\
    \ today's routing subsystem that are actually used.\n   This includes, but is\
    \ not limited to, the ability to control routing\n   based on policy.\n"
