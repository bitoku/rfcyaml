- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines textual conventions for the representation\
    \ of\n   floating-point numbers.  All of these definitions are in terms of the\n\
    \   IEEE \"Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic\", IEEE 754-2008\n   [IEEE.754.2008].\n\
    \   The IEEE \"Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic\", IEEE 754-2008\n   [IEEE.754.2008],\
    \ provides for a variety of interchange formats for\n   floating-point numbers.\
    \  The need for three of these, namely\n   o  32-bit,\n   o  64-bit,\n   o  128-bit,\n\
    \   has been recognized in network management.  For example, Section\n   4.2.3\
    \ of the SMIng Objectives [RFC3216] elaborates the need for these\n   three floating-point\
    \ data types in network management protocols.\n   The selection of a floating-point\
    \ format involves many considerations\n   and trade-offs.  For an introduction\
    \ to the fundamentals of floating-\n   point representations see Chapter 4 of\
    \ [KNUTH]; for a discussion of\n   these issues specifically with respect to the\
    \ IEEE formats, see\n   [GOLDBERG].\n   All of these textual conventions employ\
    \ the binary interchange format\n   defined in [IEEE.754.2008].  Specifically,\
    \ this means that for all of\n   them, the highest-order bit of the first byte\
    \ is the sign bit, with\n   the remaining bits of the octet string corresponding\
    \ to the exponent\n   and fraction parts, in network byte order.\n"
- title: 2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   The following list highlights some of the issues MIB designers\
    \ need\n   to consider when deciding whether to employ these textual\n   conventions:\n\
    \   o  Floating-point numbers are useful if the number space needs to\n      cover\
    \ a large dynamic range.  For number spaces with a limited\n      range, fixed-point\
    \ numbers can be more efficient and more precise.\n   o  Floating-point numbers\
    \ are typically the wrong answer for data\n      that is truly decimal or can\
    \ be handled adequately by re-thinking\n      the units and representing the scaled\
    \ numbers as integers.\n   o  The SNMP \"lexicographical\" ordering for INDEX\
    \ objects using these\n      floating-point textual conventions will simply be\
    \ that of the\n      octet strings corresponding to the floating-point representations,\n\
    \      which will not always reflect the numerical ordering of the\n      corresponding\
    \ floating-point values.  Even if MIB designers take\n      this into account,\
    \ users might still find the results of a MIB\n      \"walk\" surprising.  Consequently,\
    \ it is suggested that whenever\n      one of these textual conventions is used\
    \ for an INDEX object, that\n      the DESCRIPTION clause should provide some\
    \ warning.\n   o  Embedded systems sometimes lack floating-point support, which\
    \ can\n      complicate the implementation of MIB objects using floating-point\n\
    \      numbers.\n   o  In choosing from among the types defined in this memo,\
    \ MIB\n      designers need to consider both the range and the precision\n   \
    \   needed, as well as recognize that it could be inefficient to use,\n      for\
    \ example, Float128TC when Float64TC would do.\n   o  Since these textual conventions\
    \ are defined in terms of the OCTET\n      STRING type, the SMI's mechanisms for\
    \ formally setting range\n      constraints are not available.  MIB designers\
    \ using these textual\n      conventions will need to use DESCRIPTION clauses\
    \ to spell out any\n      applicable range constraints beyond those implied by\
    \ the\n      underlying IEEE types.\n   o  Whenever these textual conventions\
    \ are used in a MIB module, the\n      associated DESCRIPTION clause will need\
    \ to clearly specify whether\n      denormalized numbers, NaNs (\"not a number\"\
    ) or infinities are\n      permitted, along with any special semantics associated\
    \ with these\n      cases.  This is especially important for writeable objects.\n"
