  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This document defines the ISI TOPS20s interface between the\
    \ Mail\n   Transfer Protocol (MTP) and the Network Independent Mail Protocol\n\
    \   (NIMAIL) in terms of the files which implement it.  The internal\n   structure\
    \ and name of each file is described below.\n   For a complete understanding of\
    \ the MTP protocol as well as the terms\n   used within this document, see RFC\
    \ 780 \"Mail Transfer Protocol\", RFC\n   784 \"ISI TOPS20 Implementation\", and\
    \ RFC 785 \"ISI TOPS20 File\n   Defintitions\".  The NIMAIL is documented in IEN\
    \ 169, \"A Simple\n   NIFTP-Based Mail System\".\n"

  - "DESCRIPTION\n   1. NIMAIL to MTP\n      NIMAIL will present mail for processing\
    \ by MTP using the files\n      specified in RFC 785.\n   2. MTP to NIMAIL\n \
    \     MTP will present mail for processing by NIMAIL in files of the\n      following\
    \ form:\n         address <CR><LF>\n         address <CR><LF>\n         address\

    \ The files will named \"arbitrary.NIMAIL.-1\", where \"arbitrary\" will\n   \
