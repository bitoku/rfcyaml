  - "1.  Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base\
    \ (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.\n\
    \   In particular, it defines objects for managing the Border Gateway\n   Protocol\
    \ [11,12].\n"
- title: 2.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 which\
    \ defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n      the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an\n      evolution of MIB-I based\
    \ on implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n    \
    \  RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access\
    \ to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for\
    \ the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.  Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 5 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [9,10].\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP [11,12]\n\
    \   implementation.\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-Autonomous\
    \ System\n   routing protocol.  The primary function of a BGP speaking system\
    \ is\n   to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems.\n\
    \   This network reachability information includes information on the\n   full\
    \ path of Autonomous Systems that traffic must transit to reach\n   these networks.\n\
    \   BGP runs over a reliable transport protocol.  This eliminates the\n   need\
    \ to implement explicit update fragmentation, retransmission,\n   acknowledgement,\
    \ and sequencing.  Any authentication scheme used by\n   the transport protocol\
    \ may be used in addition to BGP's own\n   authentication mechanisms.\n   The\
    \ planned use of BGP in the Internet environment, including such\n   issues as\
    \ topology, the interaction between BGP and IGPs, and the\n   enforcement of routing\
    \ policy rules is presented in a companion\n   document [12].\n   Apart from a\
    \ few system variables, this MIB is broken into two\n   tables: the BGP Peer Table\
    \ and the BGP Received Path Attribute Table.\n   The Peer Table reflects information\
    \ about BGP peer connections, such\n   as their state and current activity.  The\
    \ Received Path Attribute\n   Table contains all attributes received from all\
    \ peers before local\n   routing policy has been applied.  The actual attributes\
    \ used in\n   determining a route are a subset of the received attribute table.\n"
