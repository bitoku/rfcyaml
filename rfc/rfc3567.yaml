    \ to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the\n  \
    \ Hashed Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5)\n   algorithm\
    \ as found in RFC 2104.  IS-IS is specified in International\n   Standards Organization\
    \ (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support\n   Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)\
    \ described in RFC 1195.  The base\n   specification includes an authentication\
    \ mechanism that allows for\n   multiple authentication algorithms.  The base\
    \ specification only\n   specifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords.\n  \
    \ This document proposes an extension to that specification that allows\n   the\
    \ use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in\n   conjunction with\
    \ the existing authentication mechanisms.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The IS-IS protocol, as specified in ISO 10589 [1], provides\
    \ for the\n   authentication of Link State PDUs (LSPs) through the inclusion of\n\
    \   authentication information as part of the LSP.  This authentication\n   information\
    \ is encoded as a Type-Length-Value (TLV) tuple.  The use\n   of IS-IS for IPv4\
    \ networks is described in [3].\n   The type of the TLV is specified as 10.  The\
    \ length of the TLV is\n   variable.  The value of the TLV depends on the authentication\n\
    \   algorithm and related secrets being used.  The first octet of the\n   value\
    \ is used to specify the authentication type.  Type 0 is\n   reserved, type 1\
    \ indicates a cleartext password, and type 255 is used\n   for routing domain\
    \ private authentication methods.  The remainder of\n   the TLV value is known\
    \ as the Authentication Value.\n   This document extends the above situation by\
    \ allocating a new\n   authentication type for HMAC-MD5 and specifying the algorithms\
    \ for\n   the computation of the Authentication Value.  This document also\n \
    \  describes modifications to the base protocol to ensure that the\n   authentication\
    \ mechanisms described in this document are effective.\n   This document is a\
    \ publication of the IS-IS Working Group within the\n   IETF, and is a contribution\
    \ to ISO IEC JTC1/SC6, for eventual\n   inclusion with ISO 10589.\n"
- title: 2. Authentication Procedures
  contents:
  - "2. Authentication Procedures\n   The authentication type used for HMAC-MD5 is\
    \ 54 (0x36).  The length\n   of the Authentication Value for HMAC-MD5 is 16, and\
    \ the length field\n   in the TLV is 17.\n   The HMAC-MD5 algorithm requires a\
    \ key K and text T as input [2].  The\n   key K is the password for the PDU type,\
    \ as specified in ISO 10589.\n   The text T is the IS-IS PDU to be authenticated\
    \ with the\n   Authentication Value field inside of the Authentication Information\n\
    \   TLV set to zero.  Note that the Authentication Type is set to 54 and\n   the\
    \ length of the TLV is set to 17 before authentication is computed.\n   When LSPs\
    \ are authenticated, the Checksum and Remaining Lifetime\n   fields are set to\
    \ zero (0) before authentication is computed.  The\n   result of the algorithm\
    \ is placed in the Authentication Value field.\n   When calculating the HMAC-MD5\
    \ result for Sequence Number PDUs, Level\n   1 Sequence Number PDUs SHALL use\
    \ the Area Authentication string as in\n   Level 1 Link State PDUs.  Level 2 Sequence\
    \ Number PDUs shall use the\n   domain authentication string as in Level 2 Link\
    \ State PDUs.  IS-IS\n   HELLO PDUs SHALL use the Link Level Authentication String,\
    \ which MAY\n   be different from that of Link State PDUs.  The HMAC-MD5 result\
    \ for\n   the IS-IS HELLO PDUs SHALL be calculated after the Packet is padded\n\
    \   to the MTU size, if padding is not disabled.  Implementations that\n   support\
    \ the optional checksum for the Sequence Number PDUs and IS-IS\n   HELLO PDUs\
    \ MUST NOT include the Checksum TLV.\n   To authenticate an incoming PDU, a system\
    \ should save the values of\n   the Authentication Value field, the Checksum and\
    \ the Remaining\n   Lifetime field, set these fields to zero, compute authentication,\
    \ and\n   then restore the values of these fields.\n   An implementation that\
    \ implements HMAC-MD5 authentication and\n   receives HMAC-MD5 Authentication\
    \ Information MUST discard the PDU if\n   the Authentication Value is incorrect.\n\
    \   An implementation MAY have a transition mode where it includes HMAC-\n   MD5\
    \ Authentication Information in PDUs but does not verify the HMAC-\n   MD5 authentication\
    \ information.  This is a transition aid for\n   networks in the process of deploying\
    \ authentication.\n   An implementation MAY check a set of passwords when verifying\
    \ the\n   Authentication Value.  This provides a mechanism for incrementally\n\
    \   changing passwords in a network.\n   An implementation that does not implement\
    \ HMAC-MD5 authentication MAY\n   accept a PDU that contains the HMAC-MD5 Authentication\
    \ Type.  ISes\n   (routers) that implement HMAC-MD5 authentication and initiate\
    \ LSP\n   purges MUST remove the body of the LSP and add the authentication\n\
    \   TLV.  ISes implementing HMAC-MD5 authentication MUST NOT accept\n   unauthenticated\
    \ purges.  ISes MUST NOT accept purges that contain\n   TLVs other than the authentication\
    \ TLV.  These restrictions are\n   necessary to prevent a hostile system from\
    \ receiving an LSP, setting\n   the Remaining Lifetime field to zero, and flooding\
    \ it, thereby\n   initiating a purge without knowing the authentication password.\n"
- title: 2.1 Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.1 Implementation Considerations\n   There is an implementation issue just after\
    \ password rollover on an\n   IS-IS router that might benefit from additional\
    \ commentary.\n   Immediately after password rollover on the router, the router\
    \ or IS-\n   IS process may restart.  If this happens, this causes the LSP\n \
    \  Sequence Number restarts from the value 1 using the new password.\n   However,\
    \ neighbors will reject those new LSPs because the Sequence\n   Number is smaller.\
    \  The router can not increase its own LSP Sequence\n   Number because it fails\
    \ to authenticate its own old LSP that\n   neighbors keep sending to it.  So the\
    \ router can not update its LSP\n   Sequence Number to its neighbors until all\
    \ the neighbors time out all\n   of the original LSPs.  One possible solution\
    \ to this problem is for\n   the IS-IS process to detect if any inbound LSP with\
    \ an authentication\n   failure has the local System ID and also has a higher\
    \ Sequence Number\n   than the IS-IS process has.  In this event, the IS-IS process\
    \ SHOULD\n   increase its own LSP Sequence Number accordingly and re-flood the\n\
    \   LSPs.  However, as this scenario could also be triggered by an active\n  \
    \ attack by an adversary, it is recommended that a counter also be kept\n   on\
    \ this case to mitigate the risk from such an active attack.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   This document enhances the security of the IS-IS\
    \ routing protocol.\n   Because a routing protocol contains information that need\
    \ not be kept\n   secret, privacy is not a requirement.  However, authentication\
    \ of the\n   messages within the protocol is of interest, to reduce the risk of\
    \ an\n   adversary compromising the routing system by deliberately injecting\n\
    \   false information into the routing system.\n   The technology in this document\
    \ provides an authentication mechanism\n   for IS-IS.  The mechanism described\
    \ here is not perfect and does not\n   need to be perfect.  Instead, this mechanism\
    \ represents a significant\n   increase in the work function of an adversary attacking\
    \ the IS-IS\n   protocol, while not causing undue implementation, deployment,\
    \ or\n   operational complexity.\n   This mechanism does not prevent replay attacks,\
    \ however, in most\n   cases, such attacks would trigger existing mechanisms in\
    \ the IS-IS\n   protocol that would effectively reject old information.  Denial\
    \ of\n   service attacks are not generally preventable in a useful networking\n\
    \   protocol [4].\n   Changes to the authentication mechanism described here (primarily:\n\
    \   to add a Key-ID field such as OSPFv2 and RIPv2 have) were considered\n   at\
    \ some length, but ultimately were rejected.  The mechanism here was\n   already\
    \ widely implemented in 1999.  As of this writing, this\n   mechanism is fairly\
    \ widely deployed within the users interested in\n   cryptographic authentication\
    \ of IS-IS.  The improvement provided by\n   the proposed revised mechanism was\
    \ not large enough to justify the\n   change, given the installed base and lack\
    \ of operator interest in\n   deploying a revised mechanism.\n   If and when a\
    \ key management protocol appears that is both widely\n   implemented and easily\
    \ deployed to secure routing protocols such as\n   IS-IS, a different authentication\
    \ mechanism that is designed for use\n   with that key management schema could\
    \ be added if desired.\n   If a stronger authentication were believed to be required,\
    \ then the\n   use of a full digital signature [5] would be an approach that should\n\
    \   be seriously considered.  It was rejected for this purpose at this\n   time\
    \ because the computational burden of full digital signatures is\n   believed\
    \ to be much higher than is reasonable given the current\n   threat environment\
    \ in operational commercial networks.\n"
