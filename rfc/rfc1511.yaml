  - "Overview\n   The IETF's Common Authentication Technology (CAT) working group\
    \ has\n   pursued, and continues to pursue, several interrelated activities,\n\
    \   involving definition of service interfaces as well as protocols.  As\n   a\
    \ goal, it has sought to separate security implementation tasks from\n   integration\
    \ of security data elements into caller protocols, enabling\n   those tasks to\
    \ be partitioned and performed separately by\n   implementors with different areas\
    \ of expertise.  This strategy is\n   intended to provide leverage for the IETF\
    \ community's security-\n   oriented resources (by allowing a single security\
    \ implementation to\n   be integrated with, and used by, multiple caller protocols),\
    \ and to\n   allow protocol implementors to focus on the functions that their\n\
    \   protocols are designed to provide rather than on characteristics of\n   particular\
    \ security mechanisms (by defining an abstract service which\n   multiple mechanisms\
    \ can realize).\n   The CAT WG has worked towards agreement on a common service\n\
    \   interface, (the Generic Security Service Application Program\n   Interface,\
    \ or GSS-API), allowing callers to invoke security\n   functions, and also towards\
    \ agreement on a common security token\n   format incorporating means to identify\
    \ the mechanism type in\n   conjunction with which security data elements should\
    \ be interpreted.\n   The GSS-API, comprising a mechanism-independent model for\
    \ security\n   integration, provides authentication services (peer entity\n  \
    \ authentication) to a variety of protocol callers in a manner which\n   insulates\
    \ those callers from the specifics of underlying security\n   mechanisms.  With\
    \ certain underlying mechanisms, per-message\n   protection facilities (data origin\
    \ authentication, data integrity,\n   and data confidentiality) can also be provided.\
    \ This work is\n   represented in a pair of RFCs: RFC-1508 (GSS-API) and RFC-1509\n\
    \   (concrete bindings realizing the GSS-API for the C language).\n   Concurrently,\
    \ the CAT WG has worked on agreements on underlying\n   security technologies,\
    \ and their associated protocols, implementing\n   the GSS-API model.  Definitions\
    \ of two candidate mechanisms are\n   currently available as Internet specifications;\
    \ development of\n   additional mechanisms is anticipated.  RFC-1510, a standards-track\n\
    \   specification, documents the Kerberos Version 5 technology, based on\n   secret-key\
    \ cryptography and contributed by the Massachusetts\n   Institute of Technology.\
    \  RFC-1507, an experimental specification,\n   documents the Distributed Authentication\
    \ Services technology, based\n   on X.509 public-key technology and contributed\
    \ by Digital Equipment\n   Corporation.\n"
