  - "1.0 Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC 2131] provides\
    \ a\n   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n\
    \   network. DHCP includes options for specific configuration parameters\n   [RFC\
    \ 2132].  This document defines options that carry NetWare/IP\n   domain name\
    \ and NetWare/IP sub-options to DHCP clients.\n"

- title: 1.2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2 Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n      o \"DHCP client\"\
    \n        A DHCP client is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain\n        configuration\
    \ parameters such as a network address.\n      o \"DHCP server\"\n        A DHCP\
    \ server is an Internet host that returns configuration\n        parameters to\
    \ DHCP clients.\n"
- title: 2. The NetWare/IP Domain Name option
  contents:
  - "2. The NetWare/IP Domain Name option\n   This option code is used to convey the\
    \ NetWare/IP domain name used by\n   the NetWare/IP product. The NetWare/IP Domain\
    \ in the option is an NVT\n   ASCII [RFC 854] string whose length is inferred\
    \ from the option 'len'\n   field.\n   The code for this option is 62, and its\
    \ maximum length is 255.\n          Code  Len    NetWare/IP Domain Name\n    \
    \    +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----\n        |  62 |  n  |  c1  |  c2\
    \  |  c3  |  ...\n        +-----+-----+------+------+------+-----\n   The 'len'\
    \ field gives the length of the NetWare/IP Domain Name.\n"
- title: 3. The NetWare/IP Information option
  contents:
  - "3. The NetWare/IP Information option\n   The NetWare/IP option code will be used\
    \ to convey all the NetWare/IP\n   related information except for the NetWare/IP\
    \ domain name.\n   The code for this option is 63, and its maximum length is 255.\
    \ A\n   number of NetWare/IP sub-options will be conveyed using this option\n\
    \   code.  The 'len' field for this option gives the length of the option\n  \
    \ data, which includes the sub-option code, length and data fields.\n   Each sub-option\
    \ contains in sequential order, a one byte sub-option\n   code, a one byte length,\
    \ and an optional multiple byte value field.\n   The sub-option length gives the\
    \ length of the value field for the\n   sub-option. The example below illustrates\
    \ the use of the 'len' and\n   sub-option length fields in this option.\n   One\
    \ and only one of the following four sub-options must be the first\n   sub-option\
    \ to be present in option 63 encoding. Each of them is\n   simply a type length\
    \ pair with length set to zero.\n   Sub-options:\n   NWIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST (code\
    \ 1)\n      The responding DHCP server does not have any NetWare/IP\n      information\
    \ configured.\n   NWIP_EXIST_IN_OPTIONS_AREA (code 2)\n      All NetWare/IP information\
    \ is present in the 'options' area of the\n      DHCP response packet.\n   NWIP_EXIST_IN_SNAME_FILE\
    \ (code 3)\n      All NetWare/IP information is present in the 'sname' and, if\n\
    \      necessary, 'file' fields of the DHCP response packet. If used, the\n  \
    \    following DHCP server behavior is required: within the 'options'\n      area,\
    \ option 63 is present with its length field set to 2. The\n      first byte of\
    \ the value field is set to NWIP_EXIST_IN_SNAME_FILE\n      tag and the second\
    \ byte is set to zero.  Both option 62 and option\n      63 will be placed in\
    \ the area covered by the sname and file\n      fields. Option 62 is encoded normally.\
    \ Option 63 is encoded with\n      its tag, length and value. The value field\
    \ does not contain any of\n      the first four sub-options described herein.\n\
    \   NWIP_EXIST_BUT_TOO_BIG (code 4)\n      Neither 'options' area nor 'sname'\
    \ field can accommodate the\n      NetWare/IP information.\n   If either NWIP_EXIST_IN_OPTIONS_AREA\
    \ or NWIP_EXIST_IN_SNAME_FILE\n   sub-options is set, one or more of the following\
    \ sub-options may be\n   present.\n   NSQ_BROADCAST (code 5)\n      Length is\
    \ 1 and a value of 1 or 0.  If the value is 1, the client\n      SHOULD perform\
    \ a NetWare Nearest Server Query to find out its\n      nearest NetWare/IP server.\n\
    \   PREFERRED_DSS (code 6)\n      Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array\
    \ of n IP addresses,\n      each four bytes in length. The maximum number of addresses\
    \ is 5\n      and therefore the maximum length value is 20. The list contains\n\
    \      the addresses of n NetWare Domain SAP/RIP Server (DSS).\n   NEAREST_NWIP_SERVER\
    \ (code 7)\n      Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses,\n\
    \      each four bytes in length. The maximum number of addresses is 5\n     \
    \ and therefore the maximum length value is 20. The list contains\n      the addresses\
    \ of n Nearest NetWare/IP servers.\n   AUTORETRIES (code 8)\n      Length is 1\
    \ and the value is a one byte integer value indicating\n      the number of times\
    \ a NetWare/IP client should attempt to\n      communicate with a given DSS server\
    \ at startup.\n   AUTORETRY_SECS (code 9)\n      Length is 1 and the value is\
    \ a one byte integer value indicating\n      the amount of delay in seconds in\
    \ between each NetWare/IP client\n      attempt to communicate with a given DSS\
    \ server at startup.\n   NWIP_1_1 (code 10)\n      Length is 1 and the value is\
    \ 1 or 0.  If the value is 1, the\n      NetWare/IP client SHOULD support NetWare/IP\
    \ Version 1.1\n      compatibility. A NetWare/IP client only needs this compatibility\n\
    \      if it will contact a NetWare/IP version 1.1 server.\n   PRIMARY_DSS (code\
    \ 11)\n      Length of 4, and the value is a single IP address.  This field\n\
    \      identifies the Primary Domain SAP/RIP Service server (DSS) for\n      this\
    \ NetWare/IP domain. NetWare/IP administration utility uses\n      this value\
    \ as Primary DSS server when configuring a secondary DSS\n      server.\n   An\
    \ example of option 63 encoding is provided below.\n    Code   Len  NetWare/IP\
    \ General Info\n   +-----+-----+----+----+\n   | 63  | 11  | 2  |  0 |\n   +-----+-----+----+----+\n\
    \                NWIP_EXIST_IN_OPTIONS_AREA (length 0)\n               +----+----+----+\n\
    \               |  5 |  1 |  1 |\n               +----+----+----+\n          \
    \      NSQ_BROADCAST_SERVER (length 1)\n                value is YES\n       \
    \        +----+----+------------+\n               |  7 |  4 | IP address |\n \
    \              +----+----+------------+\n                NEAREST_NWIP_SERVER (length\
    \ 4)\n                value is IP address of server\n"
