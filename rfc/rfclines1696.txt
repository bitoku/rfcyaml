This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing dial up modems and similar dial up devices.
This MIB module provides a set of objects that are the minimum necessary to provide the ability to monitor and control those devices, and is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

SEQUENCE OF MdmLineEntry MAX ACCESS
"The modem Line Table augments the modem ID table."
"Entries in this table are created only by the agent.
One entry exists for each modem managed by the agent."
current DESCRIPTION "Duration in 10ths of a second the modem waits after loss of carrier before hanging up.
If this value is set to `255', the modem will not hang up upon loss of carrier.
This allows the modem to distinguish between a momentary lapse in line quality and a true disconnect and can be useful to tune the tolerance of the modem to lines of poor quality."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
Allows the inspection and alteration of the state of the modem.
Management commands may change the state to `on  hook', `busied out', or `reset' from any state.
No other alterations are permitted from the management protocol.
When this object is set to reset, the modem shall be reset and the value will change to the modem's new, implementation dependent state."
{ mdmLineEntry 2 } mdmLineCapabilitiesTable OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
A list of protocol capabilities for this modem."
A listing of the protocol(s) that this modem is capable of.
Entries in this table are created only by the agent.
One entry exists for each protocol that the modem is capable of, regardless of whether that protocol is enabled or not.
This table is useful for providing an inventory of the capabilities on a modem, and allowing the manager to enable or disable capabilities from the menu of available possibilities.
Row creation is not required to enable or disable capabilities.
A unique index for this capabilities entry."
"An identifier for this capability.
Standard protocol capabilities will have identifiers registered in this document or other companion standards documents.
Proprietary protocol capabilities will be registered by their respective organization.
All capabilities, standard or vendor specific, shall be registered in this table."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The requested configuration of this capability.
If this value is 'disabled(1)', this is a request to disable this protocol.
If this value is 'preferred(3)', this is a request to enable this protocol, and to prefer it in any negotiation over other appropriate protocols that have a value of 'optional(2)'.
"The actual configuration of this capability.
The agent shall attempt to set this as close as possible to the associated mdmLineCapabilitiesEnableRequested value.
The agent shall make this determination in an implementation  specific manner that may take into account the configuration of other capabilities or other considerations.
The modem will choose in an implementation specific manner between multiple mutually exclusive capabilities that each have the same (non disabled) value.
However, the modem must prefer all capabilities with a value of 'preferred(3)' over all capabilities with a value of 'optional(2)'.
In other words, if there are one or more mutually exclusive capabilities (e.g. V.32 and V.32bis) that are set to `preferred', the agent must choose one in an implementation specific manner.
Otherwise, if there are one or more mutually exclusive capabilities that are set to `optional', the agent must choose one in an implementation  specific manner."

MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"Defines the action the modem will take when DTR drops.
If the value is set to ignore(1), the modem takes no action when DTR drops.
Typically, mdmDTEActionDTROffToOn would also be set to ignore(1) if this object is set to ignore(1).
If the value is escapeToCommandMode(2), the modem remains connected and enters command mode.
If the value is disconnectCall(3), the current call (if any) is terminated and the modem will not auto answer while DTR is off.
If the value is resetModem(4), the current call (if any) is terminated and the modem is reset.
"Defines the action the modem will take when DTR is raised.
If the value is set to ignore(1), the modem takes no action when DTR is raised.
Typically, mdmDTEActionDTROnToOff would also be set to ignore(1) if this object is set to ignore(1).
If the value is set to enableDial(2), the modem prepares to dial an outgoing call.
If the value is set to autoAnswerEnable(3), the modem will be configured to answer any incoming call.
If the value is set to establishConnection(4), the modem dials an implementation specific number.
Immediately after any reset or power on of the modem, if the DTR is high, the action specified here will be executed.
The clock source for synchronous transmissions.
If set to internal(1), the modem is the clock source and sends the clock signals to the DTE.
If set to external(2), the transmit clock signals are provided by the DTE.
If loopback(3), the modem receiver clock is used for the transmit clock.
If network(4), the clock signals are supplied by the DCE interface.
If the modem is not in synchronous mode, setting this object will have no effect on the current operations of the modem."
