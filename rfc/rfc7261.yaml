- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4856] describes the annexa parameter for G723 as follows:\n\
    \      annexa: indicates that Annex A, voice activity detection, is used\n   \
    \   or preferred.  Permissible values are \"yes\" and \"no\" (without the\n  \
    \    quotes); \"yes\" is implied if this parameter is omitted.\n   Also, [RFC4856]\
    \ describes the annexb parameter for G729, G729D, and\n   G729E as follows:\n\
    \      annexb: indicates that Annex B, voice activity detection, is used\n   \
    \   or preferred.  Permissible values are \"yes\" and \"no\" (without the\n  \
    \    quotes); \"yes\" is implied if this parameter is omitted.\n   However, a\
    \ problem arises when the value of the annexa or annexb\n   parameter does not\
    \ match in the SDP [RFC4566] offer and answer.\n   For example, if the offer has\
    \ G729 with annexb=yes and the answer has\n   G729 with annexb=no, it can be interpreted\
    \ in two different ways:\n   o  The offerer and answerer proceed as if G729 is\
    \ negotiated with\n      annexb=yes, or\n   o  The offerer and answerer proceed\
    \ as if G729 is negotiated with\n      annexb=no.\n   Since this is not clear\
    \ in the existing specifications, various\n   implementations have interpreted\
    \ the offer/answer in their own ways,\n   resulting in a different codec being\
    \ chosen to call failure, when the\n   parameter value does not match in the offer\
    \ and answer.\n   [RFC3264] requires SDP extensions that define new fmtp parameters\
    \ to\n   specify their proper interpretation in offer/answer.  This document\n\
    \   specifies the proper interpretation for the annexa and annexb\n   parameters\
    \ in offer/answer.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Offer/Answer Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Offer/Answer Considerations\n   The general objective of the offer/answer\
    \ considerations is to make\n   sure that if the offerer or answerer indicates\
    \ it does not support\n   Annex A or Annex B, then Annex A or Annex B is not used.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Considerations for Use of Comfort Noise Frames
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Considerations for Use of Comfort Noise Frames\n   [RFC3551] states that:\n\
    \      Receivers MUST accept comfort noise frames if restriction of their\n  \
    \    use has not been signaled.  The MIME registration for G729 in RFC\n     \
    \ 3555 specifies a parameter that MAY be used with MIME or SDP to\n      restrict\
    \ the use of comfort noise frames.\n   Hence, if the SDP offer or answer indicates\
    \ that comfort noise is not\n   supported, comfort noise frames MUST NOT be used.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A\n   When the offer or answer\
    \ has G723 and the annexa parameter is absent,\n   the offerer or answerer knows\
    \ that it has implied the default\n   \"annexa=yes\".  This is because the annexa\
    \ attribute is part of the\n   original registration of audio/G723 [RFC4856].\
    \  All implementations\n   that support G723 understand the annexa attribute.\
    \  Hence, this case\n   MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G723\
    \ with\n   annexa=yes.\n   When the offer has G723 with annexa=yes and the answer\
    \ has G723 with\n   annexa=no, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G723\
    \ is\n   negotiated with annexa=no.\n   When the offer has G723 with annexa=no,\
    \ after the offer/answer\n   completion the offerer and answerer MUST proceed\
    \ as if G723 is\n   negotiated with annexa=no.\n      When the offer has G723\
    \ with annexa=no, the reason for not\n      mandating that the answer MUST have\
    \ annexa=no for G723 is that\n      there are implementations that omit the annexa\
    \ parameter in\n      answer.  In such cases, the offerer and answerer proceed\
    \ as if\n      G723 is negotiated with annexa=no.\n   When the offer has G723\
    \ with no annexa parameter and the answer has\n   G723 with annexa=yes, the offerer\
    \ and answerer MUST proceed as if\n   G723 is negotiated with annexa=yes.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G729 Annex B, G729D Annex B, and\n    \
    \  G729E Annex B\n   In this section, G729 represents any of G729 or G729D or\
    \ G729E.\n   When the offer or answer has G729 and the annexb parameter is absent,\n\
