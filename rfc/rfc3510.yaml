  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo conforms to all of the requirements in Registration\n\
    \   Procedures for URL Scheme Names [RFC2717].  This memo also follows\n   all\
    \ of the recommendations in Guidelines for new URL Schemes\n   [RFC2718].\n  \
    \ See section 1, \"Introduction\", of [RFC2911] and section 1,\n   \"Introduction\"\
    , of [RFC3196] for overview information about IPP.  See\n   section 10, \"Description\
    \ of the Base IPP Documents\", of [RFC3196] for\n   a full description of the\
    \ IPP document set.\n   This memo updates IPP/1.1: Encoding and Transport (RFC\
    \ 2910), by\n   expanding and clarifying Section 5, \"IPP URL Scheme\", of RFC\
    \ 2910,\n   but does not define any new parameters or other new extensions to\
    \ the\n   syntax of IPP URLs.\n   The IPP URL scheme defined in this document\
    \ is based on the ABNF for\n   the HTTP URL scheme defined in HTTP [RFC2616],\
    \ which in turn is\n   derived from the URI Generic Syntax [RFC2396] and further\
    \ updated for\n   IPv6 by [RFC2732].  An IPP URL is transformed into an HTTP URL\n\
    \   according to the rules specified in section 5 of IPP Protocol\n   [RFC2910].\n\
    \   This document defines IPP URL scheme applicability, associated port\n   (631),\
    \ associated MIME type (\"application/ipp\"), character encoding,\n   and syntax.\n\
    \   This document is laid out as follows:\n   -  Section 2 defines the terminology\
    \ used throughout the document.\n   -  Section 3 supplies references to the IPP\
    \ Printer and IPP Job\n      object model defined in IPP Model [RFC2911].\n  \
    \ -  Section 4 specifies the IPP URL scheme.\n   -  Section 5 specifies the conformance\
    \ requirements for IPP Clients\n      and IPP Printers that claim conformance\
    \ to this document.\n   -  Sections 6, 7, and 8 specify IANA, internationalization,\
    \ and\n      security considerations.\n   -  Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 specify\
    \ normative references,\n      informative references, acknowledgements, authors'\
    \ addresses, and\n      full IETF copyright statement.\n   -  Section 14 (Appendix\
    \ A) is a completed registration template for\n      the IPP URL Scheme (see section\
    \ 6.0 of [RFC2717]).\n"

    \ for the abstract protocol defined in IPP Model [RFC2911] would\n      require\
    \ a different URL scheme.\n      The \"ipp\" URL scheme allows an IPP client to\
    \ choose an appropriate\n      IPP print service (for example, from a directory).\
    \  The IPP client\n      can establish an HTTP connection to the specified IPP\

  contents:
  - "4.5.  IPP URL Scheme Syntax\n      The abstract protocol defined in IPP Model\
    \ [RFC2911] places a\n      limit of 1023 octets (NOT characters) on the length\
    \ of a URI (see\n      section 4.1.5, \"uri\", in [RFC2911]).\n      Note:  IPP\
    \ Printers ought to be cautious about depending on URI\n      lengths above 255\
    \ bytes, because some older client implementations\n      might not properly support\
    \ these lengths.\n   IPP URLs MUST be represented in absolute form.  Absolute\
    \ URLs MUST\n   always begin with a scheme name followed by a colon.  For definitive\n\
    \   information on URL syntax and semantics, see \"Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers\
    \ (URI): Generic Syntax and Semantics\" [RFC2396].  This\n   specification adopts\
    \ the definitions of \"host\", \"port\", \"abs_path\",\n   and \"query\" from\
    \ [RFC2396], as updated for IPv6 by [RFC2732].\n   The IPP URL scheme syntax in\
    \ ABNF is as follows:\n   ipp-URL = \"ipp:\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] [ abs_path\
    \ [ \"?\" query ]]\n   If the port is empty or not given, port 631 is assumed.\
    \  The\n   semantics are that the identified resource (see section 5.1.2 of\n\
    \   [RFC2616]) is located at the IPP print service listening for HTTP\n   connections\
    \ on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the\n   identified resource\
    \ is 'abs_path'.\n   If the 'abs_path' is not present in the URL, it MUST be given\
    \ as \"/\"\n   when used as a Request-URI for a resource (see section 5.1.2 of\n\
    \   [RFC2616]).\n"

    \   Ambiguously, section 4.3.1 'job-uri' of IPP Model [RFC2911] states\n   that:\n\

    \ [RFC2910].\n   IPP Printers that conform to this specification SHOULD only generate\n\

  - "Appendix A - Registration of \"ipp\" URL Scheme\n   Note:  The following registration\
    \ obsoletes section 5, \"IPP URL\n   Scheme\", of IPP Protocol [RFC2911].\n  \
    \ URL Scheme Name:  ipp\n   URL Scheme Syntax:\n      ipp-URL = \"ipp:\" \"//\"\
    \ host [ \":\" port ] [ abs_path [ \"?\" query ]]\n   Character Encoding Considerations:\n\
    \      IPP URLs MUST use [RFC2396] encoding, as do their equivalent HTTP\n   \
    \   URLs.  Characters other than those in the \"reserved\" and \"unsafe\"\n  \
    \    sets [RFC2396] are equivalent to their \"\"%\" HEX HEX\" encoding.\n   Intended\
    \ Usage:\n      The intended usage of the \"ipp\" URL scheme is COMMON.\n    \
    \  An \"ipp\" URL is used to specify the network location of a print\n      service\
    \ that supports the IPP Protocol [RFC2910], or of a network\n      resource (for\
    \ example, a print job) managed by such a print\n      service.  An IPP client\
    \ can choose to establish an HTTP connection\n      to the specified print service\
    \ for transmission of IPP protocol\n      requests (for example, IPP print job\
    \ submission requests).\n   Applications or Protocols which use this URL scheme:\n\
    \      See:  Section 5, \"IPP URL Scheme\", in IPP Protocol [RFC2910].\n   Interoperability\
    \ Considerations:\n      See:  Section 9, \"Interoperability with IPP/1.0 Implementations\"\
    ,\n      in IPP Protocol [RFC2910].\n   Security Considerations:\n      See: \
    \ Section 8, \"Security Considerations\", in IPP Protocol\n      [RFC2910].\n\
