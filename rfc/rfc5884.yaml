    [RFC4377].\n"

    - "3.1.  BFD for MPLS LSPs: Motivation\n   LSP Ping described in [RFC4379] is
      an existing mechanism for\n   detecting an MPLS LSP data plane failure.  In
      addition, LSP Ping also\n   provides a mechanism for verifying the MPLS control
      plane against the\n   data plane.  This is done by ensuring that the LSP is
      mapped to the\n   same Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC), at the egress, as
      the\n   ingress.\n   BFD cannot be used for verifying the MPLS control plane
      against the\n   data plane.  However, BFD can be used to detect a data plane
      failure\n   in the forwarding path of an MPLS LSP.  The LSP may be associated\n
      \  with any of the following FECs:\n      a) Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
      LSP_Tunnel IPv4/IPv6\n         Session [RFC3209]\n      b) Label Distribution
      Protocol (LDP) IPv4/IPv6 prefix [RFC5036]\n      c) Virtual Private Network
      (VPN) IPv4/IPv6 prefix [RFC4364]\n      d) Layer 2 VPN [L2-VPN]\n      e) Pseudowires
      based on PWid FEC and Generalized PWid FEC\n         [RFC4447]\n      f) Border
      Gateway Protocol (BGP) labeled prefixes [RFC3107]\n   LSP Ping includes extensive
      control plane verification.  BFD, on the\n   other hand, was designed as a lightweight
      means of testing only the\n   data plane.  As a result, LSP Ping is computationally
      more expensive\n   than BFD for detecting MPLS LSP data plane faults.  BFD is
      also more\n   suitable for being implemented in hardware or firmware due to
      its\n   fixed packet format.  Thus, the use of BFD for detecting MPLS LSP\n
      \  data plane faults has the following advantages:\n      a) Support for fault
      detection for greater number of LSPs.\n      b) Fast detection.  Detection with
      sub-second granularity is\n         considered as fast detection.  LSP Ping
      is intended to be used\n         in an environment where fault detection messages
      are exchanged,\n         either for diagnostic purposes or for infrequent periodic
      fault\n         detection, in the order of tens of seconds or minutes.  Hence,\n
      \        it is not appropriate for fast detection.  BFD, on the other\n         hand,
      is designed for sub-second fault detection intervals.\n         Following are
      some potential cases when fast detection may be\n         desirable for MPLS
      LSPs:\n         1. In the case of a bypass LSP used for a facility-based link\n
      \           or node protection [RFC4090].  In this case, the bypass LSP\n            is
      essentially being used as an alternate link to protect\n            one or more
      LSPs.  It represents an aggregate and is used to\n            carry data traffic
      belonging to one or more LSPs, when the\n            link or the node being
      protected fails.  Hence, fast failure\n            detection of the bypass LSP
      may be desirable particularly in\n            the event of link or node failure
      when the data traffic is\n            moved to the bypass LSP.\n         2.
      MPLS Pseudowires (PWs).  Fast detection may be desired for\n            MPLS
      PWs depending on i) the model used to layer the MPLS\n            network with
      the Layer 2 network, and ii) the service that\n            the PW is emulating.
      \ For a non-overlay model between the\n            Layer 2 network and the MPLS
      network, the provider may rely\n            on PW fault detection to provide
      service status to the end-\n            systems.  Also, in that case, interworking
      scenarios such as\n            ATM/Frame Relay interworking may force periodic
      PW fault\n            detection messages.  Depending on the requirements of
      the\n            service that the MPLS PW is emulating, fast failure\n            detection
      may be desirable.\n   There may be other potential cases where fast failure
      detection is\n   desired for MPLS LSPs.\n"
    title: '3.1.  BFD for MPLS LSPs: Motivation'
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Using BFD in Conjunction with LSP Ping\n   BFD can be used for MPLS LSP
      data plane fault detection.  However, it\n   does not have all the functionality
      of LSP Ping.  In particular, it\n   cannot be used for verifying the control
      plane against the data\n   plane.  LSP Ping performs the following functions
      that are outside\n   the scope of BFD:\n      a) Association of an LSP Ping
      Echo request message with a FEC.  In\n         the case of Penultimate Hop Popping
      (PHP) or when the egress\n         Label Switching Router (LSR) distributes
      an explicit null label\n         to the penultimate hop router, for a single
      label stack LSP,\n         the only way to associate a fault detection message
      with a FEC\n         is by carrying the FEC in the message.  LSP Ping provides
      this\n         functionality.  Next-hop label allocation also makes it\n         necessary
      to carry the FEC in the fault detection message as\n         the label alone
      is not sufficient to identify the LSP being\n         verified.  In addition,
      presence of the FEC in the Echo request\n         message makes it possible
      to verify the control plane against\n         the data plane at the egress LSR.\n
      \     b) Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) considerations.  LSP Ping\n         traceroute
      makes it possible to probe multiple alternate paths\n         for LDP IP FECs.\n
      \     c) Traceroute.  LSP Ping supports traceroute for a FEC and it can\n         be
      used for fault isolation.\n   Hence, BFD is used in conjunction with LSP Ping
      for MPLS LSP fault\n   detection:\n      i) LSP Ping is used for bootstrapping
      the BFD session as described\n         later in this document.\n     ii) BFD
      is used to exchange fault detection (i.e., BFD session)\n         packets at
      the required detection interval.\n    iii) LSP Ping is used to periodically
      verify the control plane\n         against the data plane by ensuring that the
      LSP is mapped to\n         the same FEC, at the egress, as the ingress.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Using BFD in Conjunction with LSP Ping
  title: 3.  Applicability
- contents:
  - "4.  Theory of Operation\n   To use BFD for fault detection on an MPLS LSP, a
    BFD session MUST be\n   established for that particular MPLS LSP.  BFD Control
    packets MUST\n   be sent along the same data path as the LSP being verified and
    are\n   processed by the BFD processing module of the egress LSR.  If the LSP\n
    \  is associated with multiple FECs, a BFD session SHOULD be established\n   for
    each FEC.  For instance, this may happen in the case of next-hop\n   label allocation.
    \ Hence, the operation is conceptually similar to\n   the data plane fault detection
    procedures of LSP Ping.\n   If MPLS fast-reroute is being used for the MPLS LSP,
    the use of BFD\n   for fault detection can result in false fault detections if
    the BFD\n   fault detection interval is less than the MPLS fast-reroute\n   switchover
    time.  When MPLS fast-reroute is triggered because of a\n   link or node failure,
    BFD Control packets will be dropped until\n   traffic is switched on to the backup
    LSP.  If the time taken to\n   perform the switchover exceeds the BFD fault detection
    interval, a\n   fault will be declared even though the MPLS LSP is being locally\n
    \  repaired.  To avoid this, the BFD fault detection interval should be\n   greater
    than the fast-reroute switchover time.  An implementation\n   SHOULD provide configuration
    options to control the BFD fault\n   detection interval.\n   If there are multiple
    alternate paths from an ingress LSR to an\n   egress LSR for an LDP IP FEC, LSP
    Ping traceroute MAY be used to\n   determine each of these alternate paths.  A
    BFD session SHOULD be\n   established for each alternate path that is discovered.\n
    \  Periodic LSP Ping Echo request messages SHOULD be sent by the ingress\n   LSR
    to the egress LSR along the same data path as the LSP.  This is\n   to periodically
    verify the control plane against the data plane by\n   ensuring that the LSP is
    mapped to the same FEC, at the egress, as\n   the ingress.  The rate of generation
    of these LSP Ping Echo request\n   messages SHOULD be significantly less than
    the rate of generation of\n   the BFD Control packets.  An implementation MAY
    provide configuration\n   options to control the rate of generation of the periodic
    LSP Ping\n   Echo request messages.\n   To enable fault detection procedures specified
    in this document, for\n   a particular MPLS LSP, this document requires the ingress
    and egress\n   LSRs to be configured.  This includes configuration for supporting\n
    \  BFD and LSP Ping as specified in this document.  It also includes\n   configuration
    that enables the ingress LSR to determine the method\n   used by the egress LSR
    to identify Operations, Administration, and\n   Maintenance (OAM) packets, e.g.,
    whether the Time to Live (TTL) of\n   the innermost MPLS label needs to be set
    to 1 to enable the egress\n   LSR to identify the OAM packet.  For fault detection
    for MPLS PWs,\n   this document assumes that the PW control channel type [RFC5085]
    is\n   configured and the support of LSP Ping is also configured.\n"

  - "5.  Initialization and Demultiplexing\n   A BFD session may be established for
    a FEC associated with an MPLS\n   LSP.  As described above, in the case of PHP
    or when the egress LSR\n   distributes an explicit null label to the penultimate
    hop router, or\n   next-hop label allocation, the BFD Control packet received
    by the\n   egress LSR does not contain sufficient information to associate it\n
    \  with a BFD session.  Hence, the demultiplexing MUST be done using the\n   remote
    discriminator field in the received BFD Control packet.  The\n   exchange of BFD
    discriminators for this purpose is described in the\n   next section.\n"
  title: 5.  Initialization and Demultiplexing
- contents:
  - "6.  Session Establishment\n   A BFD session is bootstrapped using LSP Ping.  This
    specification\n   describes procedures only for BFD asynchronous mode.  BFD demand
    mode\n   is outside the scope of this specification.  Further, the use of the\n
    \  Echo function is outside the scope of this specification.  The\n   initiation
    of fault detection for a particular <MPLS LSP, FEC>\n   combination results in
    the exchange of LSP Ping Echo request and Echo\n   reply packets, in the ping
    mode, between the ingress and egress LSRs\n   for that <MPLS LSP, FEC>.  To establish
    a BFD session, an LSP Ping\n   Echo request message MUST carry the local discriminator
    assigned by\n   the ingress LSR for the BFD session.  This MUST subsequently be
    used\n   as the My Discriminator field in the BFD session packets sent by the\n
    \  ingress LSR.\n   On receipt of the LSP Ping Echo request message, the egress
    LSR MUST\n   send a BFD Control packet to the ingress LSR, if the validation of\n
    \  the FEC in the LSP Ping Echo request message succeeds.  This BFD\n   Control
    packet MUST set the Your Discriminator field to the\n   discriminator received
    from the ingress LSR in the LSP Ping Echo\n   request message.  The egress LSR
    MAY respond with an LSP Ping Echo\n   reply message that carries the local discriminator
    assigned by it for\n   the BFD session.  The local discriminator assigned by the
    egress LSR\n   MUST be used as the My Discriminator field in the BFD session packets\n
    \  sent by the egress LSR.\n   The ingress LSR follows the procedures in [BFD]
    to send BFD Control\n   packets to the egress LSR in response to the BFD Control
    packets\n   received from the egress LSR.  The BFD Control packets from the\n
    \  ingress to the egress LSR MUST set the local discriminator of the\n   egress
    LSR, in the Your Discriminator field.  The egress LSR\n   demultiplexes the BFD
    session based on the received Your\n   Discriminator field.  As mentioned above,
    the egress LSR MUST send\n   Control packets to the ingress LSR with the Your
    Discriminator field\n   set to the local discriminator of the ingress LSR.  The
    ingress LSR\n   uses this to demultiplex the BFD session.\n"

    in\n   the MPLS label stack that corresponds to the FEC for which fault\n   detection
    is being performed.  If the label stack has a depth greater\n   than one, the
    TTL of the inner MPLS label MAY be set to 1.  This may\n   be necessary for certain
    FECs to enable the egress LSR's control\n   plane to receive the packet [RFC4379].
    \ For MPLS PWs, alternatively,\n   the presence of a fault detection message may
    be indicated by setting\n   a bit in the control word [RFC5085].\n   The BFD Control
    packet sent by the ingress LSR MUST be a UDP packet\n   with a well-known destination
    port 3784 [BFD-IP] and a source port\n   assigned by the sender as per the procedures
    in [BFD-IP].  The source\n   IP address is a routable address of the sender.  The
    destination IP\n   address MUST be randomly chosen from the 127/8 range for IPv4
    and\n   from the 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6 with the following\n   exception.
    \ If the FEC is an LDP IP FEC, the ingress LSR may discover\n   multiple alternate
    paths to the egress LSR for this FEC using LSP\n   Ping traceroute.  In this case,
    the destination IP address, used in a\n   BFD session established for one such
    alternate path, is the address\n   in the 127/8 range for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104
    range for IPv6\n   discovered by LSP Ping traceroute [RFC4379] to exercise that\n
    \  particular alternate path.\n   The motivation for using the address range 127/8
    is the same as\n   specified in Section 2.1 of [RFC4379].  This is an exception
    to the\n   behavior defined in [RFC1122].\n   The IP TTL or hop limit MUST be
    set to 1 [RFC4379].\n   BFD Control packets sent by the egress LSR are UDP packets.
    \ The\n   source IP address is a routable address of the replier.\n   The BFD
    Control packet sent by the egress LSR to the ingress LSR MAY\n   be routed based
    on the destination IP address as per the procedures\n   in [BFD-MHOP].  If this
    is the case, the destination IP address MUST\n   be set to the source IP address
    of the LSP Ping Echo request message,\n   received by the egress LSR from the
    ingress LSR.\n   Or the BFD Control packet sent by the egress LSR to the ingress
    LSR\n   MAY be encapsulated in an MPLS label stack.  In this case, the\n   presence
    of the fault detection message is indicated as described\n   above.  This may
    be the case if the FEC for which the fault detection\n   is being performed corresponds
    to a bidirectional LSP or an MPLS PW.\n   This may also be the case when there
    is a return LSP from the egress\n   LSR to the ingress LSR.  In this case, the
    destination IP address\n   MUST be randomly chosen from the 127/8 range for IPv4
    and from the\n   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:7F00/104 range for IPv6.\n   The BFD Control packet
    sent by the egress LSR MUST have a well-known\n   destination port 4784, if it
    is routed [BFD-MHOP], or it MUST have a\n   well-known destination port 3784 [BFD-IP]
    if it is encapsulated in a\n   MPLS label stack.  The source port MUST be assigned
    by the egress LSR\n   as per the procedures in [BFD-IP].\n   Note that once the
    BFD session for the MPLS LSP is UP, either end of\n   the BFD session MUST NOT
    change the source IP address and the local\n   discriminator values of the BFD
    Control packets it generates, unless\n   it first brings down the session.  This
    implies that an LSR MUST\n   ignore BFD packets for a given session, demultiplexed
    using the\n   received Your Discriminator field, if the session is in UP state
    and\n   if the My Discriminator or the Source IP address fields of the\n   received
    packet do not match the values associated with the session.\n"
