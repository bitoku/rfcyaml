  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The X.500 Standard [X.500 93] has the concept of first level DSAs,\n\
    \   whose administrators must collectively manage the root naming context\n  \
    \ through bi-lateral agreements or other private means which are\n   outside the\
    \ scope of the X.500 Standard.\n   The NameFLOW-Paradise X.500 service has an\
    \ established procedure for\n   managing the root naming context, which currently\
    \ uses Quipu\n   proprietary replication mechanisms and a root DSA. The benefits\
    \ that\n   derive from this are twofold:\n      - firstly it is much easier to\
    \ co-ordinate the management of the\n      root context information, when there\
    \ is a central point of\n      administration,\n      - secondly the performance\
    \ of one-level Search operations is\n      greatly improved because the Quipu\
    \ distribution and replication\n      mechanism does not have a restriction that\
    \ exists in the 1988 and\n      1993 X.500 Standard.\n   The NameFLOW-Paradise\
    \ project is moving towards 1993 ISO X.500\n   Standard replication protocols\
    \ and wants to standardise the protocol\n   and procedure for managing the root\
    \ naming context which will be\n   based on 1993 X.500 Standard protocols. Such\
    \ a protocol and procedure\n   will be useful to private X.500 domains as well\
    \ as to the Internet\n   X.500 public domain. It is imperative that overall system\
    \ performance\n   is not degraded by this transition.\n   This document describes\
    \ the use of 1993 ISO X.500 Standard protocols\n   for managing the root context.\
    \ Whilst the ASN.1 is compatible with\n   that of the X.500 Standard, the actual\
    \ settings of the parameters are\n   supplementary to that of the X.500 Standard.\n"

- title: 1     Introduction
  contents:
  - "1     Introduction\n   The NameFLOW-Paradise service has a proprietary way of\
    \ managing the\n   set of first level DSAs and the root naming context. There\
    \ is a\n   single root DSA (Giant Tortoise) which holds all of the country\n \
    \  entries, and the country entries are then replicated to every country\n   (first\
    \ level) DSA and other DSAs by Quipu replication [RFC 1276] from\n   the root\
    \ DSA. In June 1996 there were 770 DSAs replicating this\n   information over\
    \ the Internet. The root DSA is not a feature of the\n   X.500 Standard [X.500\
    \ 93]. It was introduced because of the non-\n   standard nature of the original\
    \ Quipu knowledge model (also described\n   in RFC 1276). However, it does have\
    \ significant advantages both in\n   managing the root naming context and in the\
    \ performance of one-level\n   Searches of the root.  Performance is increased\
    \ because each country\n   DSA holds all the entry information of every country.\n\
    \   By comparison, the 1988 X.500 Standard root context which is\n   replicated\
    \ to all the country DSAs, only holds knowledge information\n   and a boolean\
    \ (to say if the entry is an alias or not) for each\n   country entry. This is\
    \ sufficient to perform an insecure List\n   operation, but not a one-level Search\
    \ operation. When access controls\n   were added to the 1993 X.500 Standard, the\
    \ root context information\n   was increased (erroneously as it happens - this\
    \ is the subject of\n   defect report 140 - see Annex 1) to hold the access controls\
    \ for each\n   country entry, but a note in the X.500 Standard restricted its\
    \ use to\n   the List operation, in order to remain compatible with the 1988\n\
    \   edition of the X.500 Standard.\n"
- title: 2     Migration Plan
  contents:
  - "2     Migration Plan\n   The NameFLOW-Paradise service is now migrating to X.500\
    \ Standard\n   [X.500 93] conforming products, and it is essential to replace\
    \ the\n   Quipu replication protocol with the 1993 shadowing and operational\n\
    \   binding protocols, but without losing the performance improvement\n   that\
    \ has been gained for one-level Searches.\n   It is still the intention of the\
    \ NameFLOW-Paradise service to have\n   one master root DSA. This root DSA will\
    \ not support user Directory\n   operations via the LDAP, the DAP or the DSP,\
    \ but each country (first\n   level) DSA will be able to shadow the root context\
    \ from this root\n   DSA, using the DISP. Each first level DSA then only needs\
    \ to have one\n   bi-lateral agreement, between itself and the root DSA. This\
    \ agreement\n   will ensure that the first level DSA keeps the root DSA up to\
    \ date\n   with its country level information, and in turn, that the root DSA\n\
    \   keeps the first level DSA up to date with the complete root naming\n   context.\
    \ When a new first level DSA comes on line, it only needs to\n   establish a bi-lateral\
    \ agreement with the root DSA, in order to\n   obtain the complete root context.\n\
    \   This is a much easier configuration to manage than simply a set of\n   first\
    \ level DSAs without a root DSA, as suggested in the ISO X.500\n   Standard. In\
    \ the X.500 Standard case each first level DSA must have\n   bi-lateral agreements\
    \ with all of the other first level DSAs. When a\n   new first level DSA comes\
    \ on line, it must establish agreements with\n   all the existing first level\
    \ DSAs. As the number of first level DSAs\n   grows, the process becomes unmanageable.\n\
    \   However, it is also important to increase the amount of information\n   that\
    \ is held about every country entry, so that a one-level Search\n   operation\
    \ can be performed in each first level DSA, without it\n   needing to chain or\
    \ refer the operation to all the other first level\n   DSAs (as is currently the\
    \ case with a X.500 Standard conforming\n   system.)\n"
- title: 3     Technical Solutions
  contents:
  - "3     Technical Solutions\n   3.1 The solution at first appears to be relatively\
    \ straight forward,\n   and involves two steps. Firstly, create a root DSA, and\
    \ establish\n   hierarchical operational bindings using the DOP, between it and\
    \ each\n   master first level DSA. Secondly, each master first level DSA enters\n\
    \   into a shadowing agreement with the root DSA, to shadow the enlarged\n   root\
    \ context information. In this way each first level DSA is then\n   capable of\
    \ independently performing List and one-level Search\n   operations, and name\
    \ resolving to all other first level DSAs.\n   3.2 Unfortunately there are a number\
    \ of complications that inhibit a\n   quick implementation of this solution. Firstly,\
    \ few DSA suppliers\n   have implemented the DOP. Secondly there are several defects\
    \ in the\n   X.500 Standard that currently stop the above solution from working.\n\
    \   3.3 At a meeting chaired by DANTE in the UK on 18 June 1996[Mins], at\n  \
    \ which several DSA suppliers were present, the following pragmatic\n   technical\
    \ solution was proposed. This comprises a fast track partial\n   solution and\
    \ a slower track fuller solution. Both the fast and slower\n   tracks use the\
    \ shadowing protocol (DISP) for both steps of the\n   solution, and do not rely\
    \ on the DOP to establish HOBs. The fast\n   track solution, described in section\
    \ 4, will support knowledge\n   distribution of the root context, and the (insecure)\
    \ List operation\n   of the root's subordinates. The List operation will be insecure\n\
    \   because access control information will not be present in the shadow\n   DSEs.\
    \ (However, since it is generally thought that first level\n   entries, in particular\
    \ country entries, are publicly accessible, this\n   is not considered to be a\
    \ serious problem.) Suppliers expect to have\n   the fast track solution available\
    \ before the end of 1996. The slower\n   track solution, described in section\
    \ 5, will in addition support\n   fully secure one level Search and List operations\
    \ of the root\n   (without the need to chain to the master DSAs). Suppliers at\
    \ the\n   DANTE meeting did not realistically expect this to be in their\n   products\
    \ much sooner than mid 1998.\n   3.4 The long term solution, which relies on the\
    \ DOP to establish\n   HOBs, is described in section 6 of this document.\n   (Note.\
    \ It is strongly recommended that non-specific subordinate\n   references should\
    \ not be allowed in the root context for efficiency\n   reasons. This is directed\
    \ by the European functional X.500 Standard\n   [ENV 41215] and the NADF standing\
    \ document [NADF 7]. It is also\n   preferred by the International X.500 Standardized\
    \ Profile [ISP\n   10615-6].)\n"
- title: 4     The Fast Track Solution
  contents:
  - "4     The Fast Track Solution\n   4.1 The fast track solution provides root knowledge\
    \ collection and\n   insecure List operations for first level DSAs, and will be\
    \ of use to\n   systems which do not yet support the DOP for managing hierarchical\n\
    \   operational bindings. The fast track solution relies upon the DISP\n   with\
    \ very few changes to the 1993 edition of the X.500 Standard.\n   4.2 Each master\
    \ first level DSA administrator will make available to\n   the administrator of\
    \ the root DSA, sufficient information to allow\n   the root DSA to configure\
    \ a subordinate reference to their DSA. In\n   the simplest case, this can be\
    \ via a telephone call, and the\n   information comprises the access point of\
    \ their DSA and the RDNs of\n   the first level entries that they master.\n  \
    \ 4.3 Each master first level DSA enters into a shadowing agreement\n   with the\
    \ root DSA, for the purpose of shadowing the root naming\n   context.\n   The\
    \ 1993 edition of the X.500 Standard explicitly recognises that\n   there can\
    \ be master and shadow first level DSAs (X.501 Section 18.5).\n   (The 1988 edition\
    \ of the X.500 Standard does not explicitly recognise\n   this, since it does\
    \ not recognise shadowing.) A shadow first level\n   DSA holds a copy of the root\
    \ context, provided by a master first\n   level DSA. In addition it holds shadow\
    \ copies of the (one or more)\n   country entries that the master first level\
    \ DSA holds. There is\n   currently an outstanding defect report [UK 142] on the\
    \ 1993 X.500\n   Standard to clarify how a shadowing agreement is established\
    \ between\n   first level DSAs. Once this has been ratified, the only additional\n\
    \   text needed in order to establish a shadowing agreement between the\n   root\
    \ DSA and a master first level DSA is as follows:\n   \"When clause 9.2 of ISO/IEC\
    \ 9594-9:1993 is applied to the\n   shadowing of the root context by a first level\
    \ DSA from the root\n   DSA of a domain, then UnitOfReplication shall be set as\
    \ follows:\n   contextPrefix of AreaSpecification shall be null,\n   replicationArea\
    \ of AreaSpecification shall be set to\n                       SEQUENCE {\n  \
    \      specificExclusions  [1]  SET OF {\n             chopBefore          [0]\
    \  FirstLevelEntry},\n        maximum             [3]  1 }\n   where FirstLevelEntry\
    \ is the RDN of a first level entry (e.g.\n   country, locality or international\
    \ organisation) held by the\n   master first level DSA. specificExclusions shall\
    \ contain one\n   FirstLevelEntry for each first level entry mastered by this\
    \ DSA,\n   attributes of UnitofReplication shall be an empty SET OF SEQUENCE,\n\
    \   knowledge of UnitofReplication shall be set to both (shadow and\n   master).\n\
    \   In other words, the information that will be replicated will be an\n   empty\
    \ root entry plus all the attributes of the complete set of\n   subordinate DSEs\
    \ of the root that are held in the root DSA excluding\n   the DSEs that the first\
    \ level DSA already masters, plus a complete\n   set of subordinate reference.\"\
    \n   Note that the maximum component of replicationArea, although not\n   strictly\
    \ necessary, is there for pragmatic reasons, for example,\n   where a community\
    \ of users wish to use the root DSA to hold some\n   country specific entries.\n"

  contents:
  - "5     The Slower Track Solution\n   5.1 The slower track solution provides support\
    \ for fully secure one\n   level Search and List operations of the root in first\
    \ level DSAs, and\n   comprises of two steps for HOB establishment between the\
    \ root DSA and\n   master first level DSAs, using the DISP instead of the DOP.\
    \ Step one,\n   described in 5.3, allows the root DSA to shadow first level entries\n\
    \   from a master first level DSA. Step two, described in 5.4, requires\n   either\
    \ the root DSA administrator or the root DSA implementation to\n   massage the\
    \ shadow first level entries so that they appear to have\n   been created by a\
    \ HOB.  Managing the root context then continues as\n   in 4.3 above.\n   5.2\
    \ This solution requires two significant defects in the ISO X.500\n   Standard\
    \ to be corrected. Firstly, access control information needs\n   to be added to\
    \ subordinate references in the DISP to allow the List\n   operation to work securely\
    \ in a shadowed DSA. (The ACI are held in\n   both the subr DSE and in its subentry.)\
    \ This requires a defect report\n   on the 93 X.500 Standard to be submitted.\
    \ The text of this defect\n   report (that has been submitted to ISO) is given\
    \ in Annex 2.\n   Secondly, a new type of shadowing agreement will need to be\n\
    \   established between the supplier and consumer DSAs, to copy\n   subordinate\
    \ entries rather than simply subordinate references, so\n   that one level Search\
    \ operations can work in the shadowing DSA.  This\n   procedure should have been\
    \ part of the 1997 edition of the X.500\n   Standard, but due to an omission is\
    \ not. Consequently  a defect\n   report on the 1997 X.500 Standard has been submitted.\
    \ The text of\n   this defect report is given in Annex 3.\n   5.3 The hierarchical\
    \ operational binding between the root DSA and a\n   master first level DSA can\
    \ be replaced by a set of \"spot\" shadowing\n   agreements, in which the first\
    \ level DSA acts as the supplier, and\n   the root DSA as the consumer. Each \"\
    spot\" shadowing agreement\n   replicates a first level entry which is mastered\
    \ by the first level\n   DSA. The UnitOfReplication shall be set as follows:\n\
    \   contextPrefix of AreaSpecification shall be FirstLevelEntry,\n   replicationArea\
    \ of AreaSpecification shall be set to\n                       SEQUENCE {\n  \
    \      specificExclusions  [1]  SET OF {\n                       chopAfter [1]\
    \  {null} } }\n   where FirstLevelEntry is the Distinguished Name of a first level\n\
    \   entry (e.g. country, locality or international organisation) held by\n   the\
    \ master first level DSA.\n   attributes of UnitofReplication shall be an empty\
    \ SET OF SEQUENCE,\n   knowledge of UnitofReplication shall be absent.\n   5.4\
    \ The root DSA administrator, or the root DSA implementation\n   (suitably tailored)\
    \ must then administratively update each shadowed\n   first level entry, so that\
    \ they appear to have been created by a HOB,\n   i.e. it is necessary to add a\
    \ subordinate reference to each one of\n   them. The subordinate reference will\
    \ point to the respective master\n   first level DSA, and will comprise of a specific\
    \ knowledge attribute,\n   and the DSE bit of type subr being set. The contents\
    \ of the specific\n   knowledge attribute can be created from the contents of\
    \ the supplier\n   knowledge attribute already present in the first level entry\
    \ and\n   created by the \"spot\" shadowing agreement.\n"
- title: 6     The Long Term Solution
  contents:
  - "6     The Long Term Solution\n   6.1 Each master first level DSA will have a\
    \ hierarchical operational\n   binding with the root DSA of the domain. Each master\
    \ first level DSA\n   will master one or more first level entries. The hierarchical\n\
    \   operational binding will keep the appropriate subordinate\n   reference(s)\
    \ (of category shadow and master) up to date, as well as\n   the other entry information\
    \ that is needed for one-level Search\n   operations (such as access controls,\
    \ and attributes used in\n   filtering).\n   Whilst hierarchical agreements are\
    \ standardised, this particular\n   novel use of a HOB is not specifically recognised\
    \ in the X.500\n   Standard.  Although the ASN.1 will support it, there is no\
    \ supporting\n   text in the X.500 Standard. The following text supplements that\
    \ in\n   the X.500 Standard, and describes how a first level DSA may have a\n\
    \   hierarchical operational binding with the root DSA of its domain.\n   \"Clause\
    \ 24 of ISO/IEC 9594-4:1993 shall also apply when a first level\n   DSA is a subordinate\
    \ DSA, and the root DSA of the domain is the\n   superior DSA. The naming context\
    \ held by the superior (root) DSA is\n   the root naming context (or root context\
    \ - the terms are synonymous)\n   of the domain. The root context consists of\
    \ the root entry of the DIT\n   (which is empty) plus a complete set of subordinate\
    \ DSEs (i.e. first\n   level DSEs), one for each first level naming context in\
    \ the domain,\n   and their corresponding subentries.  The first level DSEs and\
    \ their\n   subentries will contain, in addition to specific knowledge attribute\n\
    \   values of category master and shadow, sufficient attributes and\n   collective\
    \ attributes, including access control information, to allow\n   List and one-level\
    \ Search operations to be performed on them.\n   In clause 24.1.2, the DistinguishedName\
    \ of the immediateSuperior\n   component of HierarchicalAgreement shall be null.\"\
    \n   6.2 The ASN.1 of hierarchical operational bindings already allows any\n \
    \  attributes to be passed from the subordinate DSA to the superior DSA\n   (SubordinateToSuperior\
    \ parameter in clause 24.1.4.2 of X.518).\n   However, a note in the 1993 edition\
    \ of the X.500 Standard limits this\n   to those which are required to perform\
    \ a List operation. In the 1997\n   edition of the X.500 Standard [DAM User] this\
    \ restriction has been\n   removed, so that the attributes may also be used for\

    \  SubordinateToSuperior SEQUENCE of section 24.1.4.2 of X.518:\n        subentries\
    \     [2] SET OF SubentryInfo OPTIONAL\n   This is used to pass the relevant subentries\

    \ for Subordinate References, so that Secure List Operation can\n      be performed\
    \ in Shadow DSAs\n   Nature of Defect:\n   The List operation may be carried out\
    \ in a superior DSA using\n   subordinate reference information, providing that\
    \ the fromEntry flag\n   is set to false in the response. However, in order to\
    \ do this\n   securely, complete access control information is needed for the\
    \ RDN\n   of the subordinate entry. The existing text assumes that this is held\n\
    \   in entry ACI (e.g. see 9.2.4.1 c) or in prescriptive ACI held in\n   subentries\
    \ above the DSE (e.g. see 9.2.4.1 b). In the case of a\n   subordinate reference,\
    \ the prescriptive ACI may be held below the\n   DSE, if the subordinate reference\
    \ points to a new administrative\n   point. The shadowing document needs to make\
    \ it clear that this can be\n   the case, and needs to allow for this additional\
    \ access control\n   information to be shadowed.\n   A related defect report (140)\
    \ has already suggested that this same\n   omission should be added to operational\
    \ bindings.\n   Solution Proposed by the Source:\n   All the following changes\
    \ are to X.525|ISO 9594-9.\n   I) Insert the following text into 7.2.2.3, at the\
    \ end of both the\n   second paragraph and the first sentence of the third paragraph\
    \ (after\n   \"appropriate knowledge\"): \"and access control information.\"\n\
    \   II) Insert a new third paragraph into 7.2.2.3: \"If  subordinate\n   knowledge\
    \ is supplied, and the supplying DSE (of type subr) is also\n   of type admPoint,\
    \ then the SDSE shall additionally be of type\n   admPoint and the administrativeRole\
    \ attribute shall be supplied.  If\n   such a DSE has any immediately subordinate\
    \ subentries containing\n   PrescriptiveACI relating to the administrative point,\
    \ then they shall\n   also be supplied as SDSEs in the shadowed information.\n\
    \   Note. A DSE can be of type subr and admPoint in a superior DSA, when\n   the\
    \ naming context in the subordinate DSA is the start of a new\n   administrative\
    \ area.\"\n   III) Update figure 3 to show a subentry immediately below a\n  \
    \ subordinate reference. The subentry contains prescriptiveACI and is\n   part\

  - "DSAs.\n   Nature of Defect:\n   The 1997 edition of the X.500 Standard has allowed,\
    \ for reasons of\n   operational efficiency, one level Searches to be carried\
    \ out in the\n   superior DSA, when the actual entries are context prefixes in\n\
    \   subordinate DSAs. The HOBs have been extended to allow this entry\n   information\
    \ to be carried up to the superior DSA. Unfortunately, we\n   forgot to add the\
    \ corresponding text to Part 9, so that shadow DSAs\n   are able to copy this\
    \ additional information from the supplier DSA.\n   This defect report proposes\
    \ the additional text for Part 9.\n   Solution Proposed by the Source:\n   All\
    \ the following changes are to X.525|ISO 9594-9.\n   I) Section 9.2, add a new\
    \ subordinates parameter to\n   UnitOfReplication, viz:\n   UnitOfReplication\
    \   ::= SEQUENCE{\n   area                AreaSpecification,\n   attributes  \

    \        BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE }\n   subordinates is used to indicate that subordinate\
    \ entries, rather\n   than simply subordinate references, are to be copied to\
    \ the\n   consumer DSA. subordinates may only be TRUE if knowledge is\n   requested\
    \ and extendedKnowledge is FALSE.\n   II) Insert a new fourth paragraph (assuming\
    \ previous defect for\n   List was accepted) into 7.2.2.3:\n   \"If subordinates\
    \ is specified, then the supplier shall send\n   subordinate entries rather than\
    \ subordinate references, and the\n   SDSEs will be of type subr, entry and cp.\
    \ The subordinate entries\n   will contain attributes according to the attribute\
    \ selection.\n   In addition, if the supplying DSE is of type admPoint, then the\n\
    \   SDSE shall additionally be of type admPoint and the\n   administrativeRole\
    \ attribute shall be supplied. All appropriate\n   subentries below the admPoint\
    \ DSE shall also be supplied as SDSEs\n   in the shadowed information.\"\n"
