  - "1. Introduction\n   Faster convergence is a critical feature of Transparent\n
    \  Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) [RFC6325] networks.  The\n   TRILL
    IS-IS Hellos [RFC7177] [IS-IS] used between RBridges provide a\n   basic neighbor
    and continuity check for TRILL links.  However,\n   failure detection by non-receipt
    of such Hellos is based on the\n   Holding Time parameter that is commonly set
    to a value of tens of\n   seconds and, in any case, has a minimum expressible
    value of one\n   second.\n   Some applications, including Voice over IP, may wish,
    with high\n   probability, to detect interruptions in continuity within a much\n
    \  shorter time period.  In some cases, physical-layer failures can be\n   detected
    very rapidly, but this is not always possible, such as when\n   there is a failure
    between two bridges that are in turn between two\n   RBridges.  There are also
    many subtle failures possible at higher\n   levels.  For example, some forms of
    failure could affect unicast\n   frames while still letting multicast frames through;
    since all TRILL\n   IS-IS Hellos are multicast, such a failure cannot be detected
    with\n   Hellos.  Thus, a low-overhead method for frequently testing\n   continuity
    for the TRILL Data between neighbor RBridges is necessary\n   for some applications.
    \ The BFD protocol [RFC5880] provides a low-\n   overhead method for the rapid
    detection of connectivity failures.\n   BFD is a widely deployed OAM [RFC6291]
    mechanism in IP and MPLS\n   networks, using UDP and ACH encapsulation, respectively.
    \ This\n   document describes a TRILL encapsulation for BFD packets for networks\n
    \  that forward based on the TRILL Header.\n"

  - "2.  BFD over TRILL\n   TRILL supports unicast neighbor BFD Echo and one-hop and
    multi-hop\n   BFD Control, as specified below, over the RBridge Channel facility\n
    \  [RFC7178].  (Multi-destination BFD is a work in progress [MultiBFD].)\n   BFD-over-TRILL
    support is similar to BFD-over-IP support [RFC5881],\n   except where differences
    are explicitly mentioned.\n   Asynchronous and demand modes MUST be supported
    [RFC5880].  BFD over\n   TRILL supports the Echo function; however, implementation
    of TRILL\n   BFD Echo is optional, and it can only be used for single-hop\n   sessions.\n
    \  The TRILL Header hop count in the BFD packets is sent out with the\n   maximum
    value of 0x3F.  To prevent spoofing attacks, the TRILL hop\n   count of a received
    session is checked [RFC5082].  For a single-hop\n   session, if the hop count
    is less than 0x3F and the RBridge Channel\n   Header MH flag is zero, the packet
    is discarded.  For multi-hop\n   sessions, the hop count check can be disabled
    if the MH flag is one.\n   As in BFD for IP, the format of the Echo Packet content
    is not\n   defined.\n   New RBridge Channel code points for BFD TRILL Control
    and BFD Echo\n   packets are specified.\n   Authentication mechanisms as supported
    in BFD are also supported for\n   BFD running over TRILL.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Sessions and Initialization\n   Within an RBridge campus, there will
      be no more than one TRILL BFD\n   Control session from any RBridge RB1 to RBridge
      RB2 for each RB1\n   TRILL port.  This BFD session must be bound to this interface.
      \ As\n   such, both sides of a session MUST take the \"Active\" role (sending\n
      \  initial BFD Control packets with a zero value of Your Discriminator),\n   and
      any BFD packet from the remote machine with a zero value of Your\n   Discriminator
      MUST be associated with the session bound to the remote\n   system and interface.\n
      \  Note that TRILL BFD provides OAM facilities for the TRILL data plane.\n   This
      is above whatever protocol is in use on a particular link, such\n   as a pseudowire
      [RFC7173], Ethernet [RFC6325], or PPP link [RFC6361].\n   Link-technology-specific
      OAM protocols may be used on a link between\n   neighbor RBridges, for example,
      Continuity Fault Management [802.1Q]\n   if the link is Ethernet.  But such
      link-layer OAM (and coordination\n   between it and OAM in the TRILL data-plane
      layer, such as TRILL BFD)\n   is beyond the scope of this document.\n   If lower-level
      mechanisms are in use, such as link aggregation\n   [802.1AX], that present
      a single logical interface to TRILL IS-IS,\n   then only a single TRILL BFD
      session can be established to any other\n   RBridge over this logical interface.
      \ However, lower-layer OAM could\n   be aware of and/or run separately on each
      of the components of an\n   aggregation.\n"

    RBridge Channel frames\n   [RFC7178].  The RBridge Channel Protocol value is given

    \  protocol is as shown in Section 4.1 of [RFC5880].\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  One-Hop TRILL BFD Control\n   One-hop TRILL BFD Control is typically
      used to rapidly detect link\n   and RBridge failures.  TRILL BFD frames over
      one hop for such\n   purposes SHOULD be sent with high priority; that is, the
      Inner.VLAN\n   tag priority should be 7, they should be queued for transmission
      as\n   maximum priority frames, and, if they are being sent on an Ethernet\n
      \  link where the output port is configured to include an Outer.VLAN\n   tag,
      that tag should specify priority 7.\n   For neighbor RBridges RB1 and RB2, each
      RBridge sends one-hop TRILL\n   BFD Control frames to the other only if TRILL
      IS-IS has detected\n   bidirectional connectivity; that is, the adjacency is
      in the 2-Way or\n   Report state [RFC7177], and both RBridges indicate support
      of TRILL\n   BFD is enabled.  The BFD-Enabled TLV is used to indicate this as\n

      BFD Control frames easier.\n   o  If the Channel Header MH flag is zero, indicating
      one hop, test\n      that the TRILL Header hop count received was 0x3F (i.e.,
      is 0x3E\n      if it has already been decremented); if it is any other value,\n
      \     discard the frame.  If the Channel Header MH flag is one,\n      indicating
      multi-hop, test that the TRILL Header hop count\n      received was not less
      than a configurable value that defaults to\n      0x30.  If it is less, discard
      the frame.  Failure to perform these\n      tests would make it easier to spoof
      BFD Control frames.  However,\n      if forged BFD Control frames are a concern,
      then BFD\n      Authentication [RFC5880] should be used.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  TRILL BFD Echo Protocol\n   A TRILL BFD Echo frame is a unicast RBridge Channel
    frame, as\n   specified in [RFC7178], which should be forwarded back by an\n   immediate
    neighbor because both the ingress and egress nicknames are\n   set to a nickname
    of the originating RBridge.  Normal TRILL Data\n   frame forwarding will cause
    the frame to be returned unless micro-\n   loop suppression logic in the neighbor
    RBridge prohibits sending a\n   frame back out the port on which it was received
    or the like.\n   RBridges with such prohibitions cannot support BFD Echo.  The
    TRILL\n   OAM protocol number for BFD Echo is given in Section 8.\n   TRILL BFD
    Echo frames SHOULD be sent on a link only if the following\n   conditions are
    met.  An Echo originating under other circumstances\n   will consume bandwidth
    and CPU resources but is unlikely to be\n   returned.\n   -  A TRILL BFD Control
    session has been established,\n   -  TRILL BFD Echo support is indicated by the
    RBridge that would\n      potentially respond to the BFD Echo,\n   -  The adjacency
    is in the Report state [RFC7177], and\n   -  The TRILL BFD Echo originating RBridge
    wishes to make use of this\n      optional feature.\n   Since the originating
    RBridge is the RBridge that will be processing\n   a returned Echo frame, the
    entire TRILL BFD Echo protocol-specific\n   data area is considered opaque and
    left to the discretion of the\n   originating RBridge.  Nevertheless, it is suggested
    that this data\n   include information by which the originating RBridge can authenticate\n
    \  the returned BFD Echo frame and confirm the neighbor that echoed the\n   frame
    back.  For example, it could include its own System ID, the\n   neighbor's System
    ID, a session identifier, and a sequence count as\n   well as a Message Authentication
    Code.\n"

    - "4.1.  BFD Echo Frame Processing\n   The following tests MUST be performed on
      returned TRILL BFD Echo\n   frames before other processing.  The RBridge Channel
      document\n   [RFC7178] requires that the information in the TRILL Header be
      given\n   to the BFD protocol.\n   o  Is the M bit in the TRILL Header non-zero?
      \ If so, discard the\n      frame.  (Multi-destination BFD is a work in progress
      [MultiBFD].)\n   o  The TRILL BFD Echo frame should have gone exactly two hops,
      so\n      test that the TRILL Header hop count as received was 0x3E (i.e.,\n
      \     0x3D if it has already been decremented), and if it is any other\n      value,
      discard the frame.  The RBridge Channel Header in the frame\n      MUST have
      the MH bit equal to one, and if it is zero, discard the\n      frame.\n"

    RBridge are configurable.  The default\n   values are the same as in the IP BFD
    case [RFC5881], except where\n   specified in this document, such as for hop count.\n
    \  It is up to the operator of an RBridge campus to configure the rates\n   at
    which TRILL BFD frames are transmitted on a link to avoid\n   congestion (e.g.,
    link, input/output (I/O), CPU) and false failure\n   detection.  See also the
    discussion of congestion in Section 2 of\n   [RFC5881].\n   As stated in [RFC5880]:\n
    \     It is worth noting that a single BFD session does not consume a\n      large
    amount of bandwidth.  An aggressive session that achieves a\n      detection time
    of 50 milliseconds, by using a transmit interval of\n      16.7 milliseconds and
    a detect multiplier of 3, will generate 60\n      packets per second.  The maximum
    length of each packet on the wire\n      is on the order of 100 bytes, for a total
    of around 48 kilobits\n      per second of bandwidth consumption in each direction.\n"
  title: 5. Management and Operations Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Default Authentication\n   Consistent with TRILL's goal of being able to
    operate with minimum\n   configuration, the default for BFD authentication between
    neighbor\n   RBridges is based on the state of the IS-IS shared secret\n   authentication
    for Hellos between those RBridges as detailed below.\n   The BFD authentication
    algorithm and methods in this section MUST be\n   implemented at an RBridge if
    TRILL IS-IS authentication and BFD are\n   implemented at that RBridge.  If such
    BFD authentication is\n   configured, then its configuration is not restricted
    by the\n   configuration of IS-IS security.\n   If IS-IS authentication is not
    in effect between neighbor RBridges,\n   then, by default, TRILL BFD between those
    RBridges is also unsecured.\n   If such IS-IS authentication is in effect, then,
    unless configured\n   otherwise, TRILL BFD Control frames sent between those RBridges
    MUST\n   use BFD Meticulous Keyed SHA1 authentication [RFC5880].  The BFD\n   authentication
    keys between neighbor RBridges by default are derived\n   from the IS-IS shared
    secret authentication keys for Hellos between\n   those RBridges as detailed below.
    \ However, such BFD authentication\n   keys MAY be configured to some other value.\n
    \    HMAC-SHA256 ( ( \"TRILL BFD Control\" | originPortID | originSysID ),\n                   IS-IS-shared-key
    )\n   In the above, \"|\" indicates concatenation; HMAC-SHA256 is as\n   described
    in [FIPS180] and [RFC6234]; and \"TRILL BFD Control\" is the\n   17-byte US ASCII
    [ASCII] string indicated that is then concatenated\n   with the 2-byte Port ID
    of the originating port and the 6-byte IS-IS\n   System ID of the originating
    RBridge, the last two items being in\n   network byte order.  The Port and System
    IDs are included to minimize\n   exposure of the same key to improve resistance
    to cryptanalysis.\n   IS-IS-shared-key is secret keying material being used for
    IS-IS\n   authentication on the link.\n   The use of the above derived key is
    accomplished by associating the\n   above default authentication type and key
    with the Key ID of the\n   IS-IS-shared-key used in the derivation and then using
    that Key ID in\n   the Authentication Section of the BFD Control frame OAM protocol-\n
    \  specific data.  Also, Auth Type would be 5, and Auth Len would be 28\n   in
    the Authentication Section.  RBridges MAY be configured to use\n   other BFD security
    modes or keying material or configured to use no\n   security.\n   Authentication
    for TRILL BFD Echo is a local implementation issue as\n   BFD Echo frames are
    authenticated by their sender when returned by a\n   neighbor.  However, if TRILL
    IS-IS and BFD Control are being\n   authenticated to a neighbor and BFD Echo is
    in use, BFD Echo frames\n   to be returned by that neighbor should be authenticated,
    and such\n   authentication should use different keying material from other types\n
    \  of authentication.  For example, it could use keying material derived\n   as
    follows, where \"|\" indicates concatenation:\n     HMAC-SHA256 ( ( \"TRILL BFD
    Echo\" | originPortID | originSysID ),\n                   IS-IS-shared-key )\n"
