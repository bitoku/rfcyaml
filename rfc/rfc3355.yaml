  - "Abstract\n   The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a standard method\n\
    \   for transporting the link layer of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\n   between\
    \ a dial-up server and a Network Access Server, using a network\n   connection\
    \ in lieu of a physical point-to-point connection.  This\n   document describes\
    \ the use of an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\n   network for the underlying\
    \ network connection.  ATM User-Network\n   Interface (UNI) Signaling Specification\
    \ Version 4.0 or Version 3.1\n   with ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) are supported\

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661], is frequently\
    \ used on\n   the link between a personal computer with a dial modem and a network\n\
    \   service provider, or NSP.  The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)\n   [RFC2661]\
    \ enables a dial-up server to provide access to a remote NSP\n   by extending\
    \ the PPP connection through a tunnel in a network to\n   which both it and the\
    \ NSP are directly connected.  A \"tunnel\" is a\n   network layer connection\
    \ between two nodes, used in the role of a\n   data link layer connection between\
    \ those nodes, possibly as part of a\n   different network.  In [RFC2661] the\
    \ dial-up server is called an L2TP\n   Access Concentrator, or LAC.  The remote\
    \ device that provides access\n   to a network is called an L2TP Network Server,\
    \ or LNS.  L2TP uses a\n   packet delivery service to create a tunnel between\
    \ the LAC and the\n   LNS.  \"L2TP is designed to be largely insulated from the\
    \ details of\n   the media over which the tunnel is established; L2TP requires\
    \ only\n   that the tunnel media provide packet oriented point-to-point\n   connectivity\"\
    \ [RFC2661].  An ATM network with AAL5 offers a suitable\n   form of packet oriented\
    \ connection.  This standard supplements\n   [RFC2661] by providing details specific\
    \ to the use of AAL5 for a\n   point-to-point connection between LAC and LNS.\n"

- title: 3. AAL5 Layer Service Interface
  contents:
  - "3. AAL5 Layer Service Interface\n   L2TP treats the underlying ATM AAL5 layer\
    \ service as a bit-\n   synchronous point-to-point link.  In this context, the\
    \ L2TP link\n   corresponds to an ATM AAL5 virtual circuit (VC).  The VC MUST\
    \ be\n   full-duplex, point to point, and it MAY be either dedicated (i.e.,\n\
    \   permanent, set up by provisioning) or switched (set up on demand.)\n   The\
    \ AAL5 message mode service, in the non-assured mode of operation,\n   without\
    \ the corrupted delivery option MUST be used.\n   Interface Format - The L2TP/AAL5\
    \ layer boundary presents an octet\n   service interface to the AAL5 layer.  There\
    \ is no provision for sub-\n   octets to be supplied or accepted.\n"
- title: 3.1 Maximum Transfer Unit
  contents:
  - "3.1 Maximum Transfer Unit\n   Each L2TP PDU MUST be transported within a single\
    \ AAL5 PDU.\n   Therefore the maximum transfer unit (MTU) of the AAL5 connection\n\
    \   constrains the MTU of the L2TP tunnel that uses the connection and\n   the\
    \ MTU of all PPP connections that use the tunnel.  ([RFC1661]\n   refers to this\
    \ as Maximum Receive Unit, or MRU.  In [SIG31], it is\n   the Forward and Backward\
    \ Maximum CPCS-SDU Size.)\n   An implementation MUST support a PPP MRU of at least\
    \ 1500 bytes.\n   An implementation SHOULD use a larger MTU than the minimum value\n\
    \   specified above.  It is RECOMMENDED that an implementation support an\n  \
    \ IP packet of at least 9180 bytes in the PPP PDU.\n"
- title: 3.2 Quality of Service
  contents:
  - "3.2 Quality of Service\n   In order to provide a desired Quality of Service (QoS),\
    \ and possibly\n   different qualities of service to different client connections,\
    \ an\n   implementation MAY use more than one AAL5 connection between LAC and\n\
    \   LNS.\n   QoS mechanisms, such as Differentiated UBR [DUBR], that could involve\n\
    \   inverse multiplexing a tunnel across multiple VCs are for further\n   study.\
    \  QoS mechanisms applicable to a single tunnel corresponding to\n   a single\
    \ VC, are independent of the ATM transport and out of scope of\n   this document.\n"
- title: 3.3 ATM Connection Parameters
  contents:
  - "3.3 ATM Connection Parameters\n   The L2TP layer does not impose any restrictions\
    \ regarding\n   transmission rate or the underlying ATM layer traffic descriptor\n\
    \   parameters.\n   Specific traffic parameters MAY be set for a PVC connection\
    \ by\n   agreement between the communicating parties.  The caller MAY request\n\
    \   specific traffic parameters at the time an SVC connection is set up.\n   Autoconfiguration\
    \ of end-systems for PVCs can be facilitated by the\n   use of the optional ILMI\
    \ 4.0 extensions documented in [ILMIA].  This\n   provides comparable information\
    \ to the IEs used for control plane\n   connection establishment.\n"
- title: 4. Multi-Protocol Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "4. Multi-Protocol Encapsulation\n   This specification uses the principles, terminology,\
    \ and frame\n   structure described in \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM\n\
    \   Adaptation Layer 5\" [RFC2684].  The purpose of this specification is\n  \
    \ not to reiterate what is already standardized in [RFC2684], but to\n   specify\
    \ how the mechanisms described in [RFC2684] are to be used to\n   map L2TP onto\
    \ an AAL5-based ATM network.\n   As specified in [RFC2684], L2TP PDUs shall be\
    \ carried in the payload\n   field of Common Part Convergence Sublayer (CPCS)\
    \ PDUs of AAL5, and\n   the Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (SSCS) of AAL5\
    \ shall be\n   empty.\n   Section 1 of [RFC2684] defines two mechanisms for identifying\
    \ the\n   protocol encapsulated in the AAL5 PDU's payload field:\n      1. Virtual\
    \ circuit (VC) based multiplexing.\n      2. Logical Link Control (LLC) encapsulation.\n\
    \   In the first mechanism, the payload's protocol type is implicitly\n   agreed\
    \ to by the end points for each virtual circuit using\n   provisioning or control\
    \ plane procedures.  This mechanism will be\n   referred to as \"VC-multiplexed\
    \ L2TP\".\n   In the second mechanism, the payload's protocol type is explicitly\n\
    \   identified in each AAL5 PDU by an IEEE 802.2 LLC header.  This\n   mechanism\
    \ will be referred to as \"LLC encapsulated L2TP\".\n   An L2TP implementation:\n\
    \      1. MUST support LLC encapsulated L2TP on PVCs.\n      2. MAY support LLC\
    \ encapsulated L2TP on SVCs.\n      3. MAY support VC-multiplexed L2TP on PVCs\
    \ or SVCs.\n   When a PVC is used, the endpoints must be configured to use one\
    \ of\n   the two encapsulation methods.\n   If an implementation supports SVCs,\
    \ it MUST use the [Q.2931] Annex C\n   procedure to negotiate connection setup,\
    \ encoding the Broadband Lower\n   Layer Interface (B-LLI) information element\
    \ (IE) to signal either\n   VC-multiplexed L2TP or LLC encapsulated L2TP.  The\
    \ details of this\n   control plane procedure are described in section 7.\n  \
    \ If an implementation is connecting through a Frame Relay/ATM FRF.8\n   [FRF8]\
    \ service inter-working unit, then it MUST use LLC encapsulated\n   L2TP.\n"

    \ both\n   originate and respond to SVC setup requests.  Except for the B-LLI\
    \ IE\n   specified below, all other IEs required for ATM User-Network\n   Interface\
    \ (UNI) Signaling Specification Version 4.0 [SIG40] should be\n   encoded as per\
    \ [RFC2331].\n   When originating an SVC AAL5 connection, the caller MUST request\
    \ in\n   the SETUP message either VC-multiplexed L2TP, LLC encapsulated L2TP,\n\
    \   or both VC-multiplexed and LLC-encapsulated L2TP.  The B-LLI IE SHALL\n  \
    \ be used to specify the requested encapsulation method.  When a caller\n   is\

    \ encapsulation techniques.\n   When originating an LLC encapsulated call that\
    \ is to carry an L2TP\n   payload, the [Q.2931] B-LLI IE user information layer\
    \ 2 protocol\n   field SHALL be encoded to select LAN Logical Link Control\n \
    \  (ISO/IEC8802-2) in octet 6.  See [RFC2331] Appendix A for an example.\n   When\

    \ accordance with section 4.1 of\n   [RFC2661], both ends MUST clear the SVC.\
