    \      The term \"router\" is now used in place of the original definition\n \
    \     of \"gateway\".  Currently, a gateway is a communications\n      device/program\
    \ which passes data between networks having similar\n      functions but dissimilar\
    \ implementations.  This should not be\n      confused with a protocol converter.\
    \  By this definition, a router\n      is a layer 3 (network layer) gateway, and\
    \ a mail gateway is a\n      layer 7 (application layer) gateway.  See also: mail\

    \ information service, developed at the University of\n      Minnesota, that makes\

    \  Gopher uses a simple protocol,\n      defined in RFC 1436, that allows a single\
    \ Gopher client to access\n      information from any accessible Gopher server,\
    \ providing the user\n      with a single \"Gopher space\" of information.  Public\

    \ problem of routing on large networks can be simplified\n      by reducing the\
    \ size of the networks.  This is accomplished by\n      breaking a network into\
    \ a hierarchy of networks, where each level\n      is responsible for its own\
    \ routing.  The Internet has, basically,\n      three levels: the backbones, the\
    \ mid-levels, and the stub\n      networks.  The backbones know how to route between\
    \ the mid-levels,\n      the mid-levels know how to route between the sites, and\
    \ each site\n      (being an autonomous system) knows how to route internally.\

    \ layer governs direct host-to-host\n      communication between the hardware\
    \ at different hosts; the highest\n      consists of user applications.  Each\
