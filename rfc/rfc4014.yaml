  - "Abstract\n   The RADIUS Attributes suboption enables a network element to pass\n\
    \   identification and authorization attributes received during RADIUS\n   authentication\
    \ to a DHCP server.  When the DHCP server receives a\n   message from a relay\
    \ agent containing a RADIUS Attributes suboption,\n   it extracts the contents\
    \ of the suboption and uses that information\n   in selecting configuration parameters\
    \ for the client.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction and Background\n   The RADIUS Attributes suboption for the DHCP\
    \ Relay Agent option\n   provides a way in which a NAS can pass attributes obtained\
    \ from a\n   RADIUS server to a DHCP server [1].  IEEE 802.1X [2] is an example\
    \ of\n   a mechanism through which a NAS such as a switch or a wireless LAN\n\
    \   access point can authenticate the identity of the user of a device\n   before\
    \ providing layer 2 network access with RADIUS as the\n   Authentication Service,\
    \ as specified in RFC 3580 [8].  In IEEE 802.1X\n   authenticated access, a device\
    \ must first exchange some\n   authentication credentials with the NAS.  The NAS\
    \ then supplies these\n   credentials to a RADIUS server, which eventually sends\
    \ either an\n   Access-Accept or an Access-Reject in response to an Access-Request.\n\
    \   The NAS, based on the reply of the RADIUS server, then allows or\n   denies\
    \ network access to the requesting device.\n   Figure 1 summarizes the message\
    \ exchange among the participants in\n   IEEE 802.1X authentication.\n       \

    \       Figure 1\n   The access device acts as an IEEE 802.1X Authenticator and\
    \ adds a\n   DHCP relay agent option that includes a RADIUS Attributes suboption\n\
    \   to DHCP messages.  At the successful conclusion of IEEE 802.1X\n   authentication,\
    \ a RADIUS Access-Accept provides attributes for\n   service authorizations to\
    \ the NAS.  The NAS stores these attributes\n   locally.  When the NAS subsequently\
    \ relays DHCP messages from the\n   network device, the NAS adds these attributes\
    \ in a RADIUS Attributes\n   suboption.  The RADIUS Attributes suboption is another\
    \ suboption of\n   the Relay Agent Information option [5].\n   The RADIUS Attributes\
    \ suboption described in this document is not\n   limited to use in conjunction\
    \ with IEEE 802.1X and can be used to\n   carry RADIUS attributes obtained by\
    \ the relay agent for any reason.\n   That is, the option is not limited to use\
    \ with IEEE 802.1X but is\n   constrained by RADIUS semantics (see Section 4).\n\
    \   The scope of applicability of this specification is such that robust\n   interoperability\
    \ is only guaranteed for RADIUS service\n   implementations that exist within\
    \ the same scope as does the DHCP\n   service implementation, i.e., within a single,\
    \ localized\n   administrative domain.  Global interoperability of this\n   specification,\
    \ across administrative domains, is not required.\n"
