- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is not uncommon to deploy MPLS Traffic Engineering for\
    \ the sake of\n   fast recovery, relying on a local protection recovery mechanism\
    \ such\n   as MPLS TE Fast Reroute (see [RFC4090]).  In this case, a deployment\n\
    \   model consists of deploying a full mesh of TE LSPs signalled with\n   zero\
    \ bandwidth (also referred to as unconstrained TE LSP in this\n   document) between\
    \ a set of LSRs (Label Switching Routers) and\n   protecting these TE LSPs against\
    \ link, SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group),\n   and/or node failures with pre-established\
    \ backup tunnels.  The\n   traffic routed onto such unconstrained TE LSPs simply\
    \ follows the IGP\n   shortest path, but is protected with MPLS TE Fast Reroute.\
    \  This is\n   because the TE LSP computed by the path computation algorithm (e.g.,\n\
    \   CSPF) will be no different than the IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)\n   shortest\
    \ path should the TE metric be equal to the IGP metric.\n   When a reoptimization\
    \ process is triggered for an existing TE LSP,\n   the decision on whether to\
    \ reroute that TE LSP onto a different path\n   is governed by the discovery of\
    \ a lower cost path satisfying the\n   constraints (other metrics, such as the\
    \ percentage of reserved\n   bandwidth or the number of hops, can also be used).\
    \  Unfortunately,\n   metrics such as the path cost or the number of hops may\
    \ be\n   ineffective in various circumstances.  For example, in the case of a\n\
    \   symmetrical network with ECMPs (Equal Cost Multi-Paths), if the\n   network\
    \ operator uses unconstrained TE LSP, this may lead to a poorly\n   load balanced\
    \ traffic; indeed, several paths between a source and a\n   destination of a TE\
    \ LSP may exist that have the same cost, and the\n   reservable amount of bandwidth\
    \ along each path cannot be used as a\n   tie-breaker.\n   By making statistical\
    \ assumptions about the aggregated traffic\n   carried by a set of unconstrained\
    \ TE LSPs, algorithms can be designed\n   to load balance (existing or newly configured)\
    \ unconstrained TE LSPs\n   across a set of equal cost paths.  This requires knowledge\
    \ of the\n   number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across each link.\n   \
    \   Note that the specification of load balancing algorithms is\n      outside\
    \ the scope of this document and is referred to for the sake\n      of illustration\
    \ of the motivation for gathering such information.\n   Furthermore, the knowledge\
    \ of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs\n   signalled across each link can be\
    \ used for other purposes -- for\n   example, to evaluate the number of affected\
    \ unconstrained TE LSPs in\n   case of a link failure.\n   A set of Link-type\
    \ sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and IS-IS (see\n   [RFC3630] and [RFC5305])\
    \ in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering\n   in order to advertise various\
    \ link characteristics such as the\n   available bandwidth, traffic engineering\
    \ metric, administrative\n   group, and so on.  As currently defined in [RFC3630]\
    \ and [RFC5305],\n   the information related to the number of unconstrained TE\
    \ LSPs is not\n   available.  This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering sub-TLV used to indicate the number of unconstrained TE\n   LSPs\
    \ signalled across a link.\n   Unconstrained TE LSPs that are configured and provisioned\
    \ through a\n   management system MAY be omitted from the count that is reported.\n"
