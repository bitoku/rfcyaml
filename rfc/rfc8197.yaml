  - "1.  Introduction\n   In many countries, an increasing number of calls are unwanted\n
    \  [RFC5039]: they might be fraudulent or illegal telemarketing or maybe\n   the
    receiving party does not want to be disturbed by, say, surveys or\n   solicitation
    by charities.  Carriers and other service providers may\n   want to help their
    subscribers avoid receiving such calls, using a\n   variety of global or user-specific
    filtering algorithms.  One input\n   into such algorithms is user feedback.  User
    feedback may be offered\n   through smartphone apps, APIs or within the context
    of a SIP-\n   initiated call.  This document addresses feedback within the SIP\n
    \  call.  Here, the called party either rejects the SIP [RFC3261]\n   request
    as unwanted or terminates the session with a BYE request\n   after answering the
    call.  INVITE and MESSAGE requests are most\n   likely to trigger such a response.\n
    \  To allow the called party to express that the call was unwanted, this\n   document
    defines the 607 (Unwanted) response code.  The user agent\n   (UA) of the called
    party, based on input from the called party or\n   some UA-internal logic, uses
    this to indicate that this call is\n   unwanted and that future attempts are likely
    to be similarly\n   rejected.  While factors such as identity spoofing and call\n
    \  forwarding may make authoritative identification of the calling party\n   difficult
    or impossible, the network can use such a rejection --\n   possibly combined with
    a pattern of rejections by other callees and/\n   or other information -- as input
    to a heuristic algorithm for\n   determining future call treatment.  The heuristic
    processing and\n   possible treatment of persistently unwanted calls are outside
    the\n   scope of this document.\n   When this document refers to \"caller identity\",
    it uses \"identity\" in\n   the same sense as [SIP-IDENTITY], i.e., to mean either
    a canonical\n   address-of-record (AOR) SIP URI employed to reach a user (such
    as\n   'sip:alice@atlanta.example.com'), or a telephone number, which\n   commonly
    appears in either a tel URI [RFC3966] or as the user portion\n   of a SIP URI.\n"

  title: 2.  Normative Language
- contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   None of the existing 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx response codes signify
    that\n   this SIP request is unwanted by the called party.  For example, 603\n
    \  (Decline) might be used if the called party is currently at dinner or\n   in
    a meeting, but does not want to indicate any specific reason.  As\n   described
    in Section 21.6.2 [RFC3261], a 603 response may include a\n   Retry-After header
    field to indicate a better time to attempt the\n   call.  Thus, the call is rejected
    due to the called party's\n   (temporary) status.  As described in Section 4,
    the called party\n   invokes the \"unwanted call\" user interface and 607 (Unwanted)\n
    \  response indicating that it is instead the caller's identity that is\n   causing
    the call to be rejected.\n"
  title: 3.  Motivation
- contents:
  - "4.  Behavior of SIP Entities\n   The response code 607 MAY be used in a failure
    response for an\n   INVITE, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, or other out-of-dialog SIP request
    to\n   indicate that the offered communication is unwanted.  The response\n   code
    MAY also be used as the value of the \"cause\" parameter of a SIP\n   reason-value
    in a Reason header field [RFC3326], typically when the\n   called party user agent
    issues a BYE request terminating an incoming\n   call or a forking proxy issues
    a CANCEL request after receiving a 607\n   response from one of the branches.
    \ (Including a Reason header field\n   with the 607 status code allows the called
    party user agent that\n   receives a CANCEL request to make an informed choice
    whether and how\n   to include such calls in their missed-call list or whether
    to show an\n   appropriate indication to the user.)\n   The SIP entities receiving
    this response code are not obligated to\n   take any particular action beyond
    those appropriate for 6xx\n   responses.  Following the default handling for 6xx
    responses in\n   [RFC5057], the 607 response destroys the transaction.  The service\n
    \  provider delivering calls or messages to the user issuing the\n   response
    MAY take a range of actions, for example, add the calling\n   party to a personal
    blacklist specific to the called party, use the\n   information as input when
    computing the likelihood that the calling\n   party is placing unwanted calls
    (\"crowd sourcing\"), initiate a\n   traceback request, or report the calling
    party's identity to consumer\n   complaint databases.  As discussed in Section
    6, reversing the\n   'unwanted' labeling is beyond the scope of this mechanism,
    as it will\n   likely require a mechanism other than call signaling.\n   The user
    experience is envisioned to be somewhat similar to email\n   spam buttons where
    the detailed actions of the email provider remain\n   opaque to the user.\n   The
    mechanism described here is only one of many inputs likely to be\n   used by call-filtering
    algorithms operated by service providers,\n   using data on calls from a particular
    identifier such as a telephone\n   number to establish handling for future calls
    from the same\n   identifier.  Call handling for unwanted calls is likely to involve
    a\n   combination of heuristics, analytics, and machine learning.  These\n   may
    use call characteristics such as call duration and call volumes\n   for a particular
    caller, including changes in those metrics over\n   time, as well as user feedback
    via non-SIP approaches and the\n   mechanism described here.  Implementations
    will have to make\n   appropriate trade-offs between falsely labeling a caller
    as unwanted\n   and delivering unwanted calls.\n   Systems receiving 607 responses
    could decide to treat pre-call and\n   mid-call responses differently, given that
    the called party has had\n   access to call content for mid-call rejections.\n
    \  Depending on the implementation, the response code does not\n   necessarily
    automatically block all calls from that caller identity.\n   The same user interface
    action might also trigger addition of the\n   caller identity to a local, on-device
    blacklist or graylist, e.g.,\n   causing such calls to be flagged or alerted with
    a different ring\n   tone.\n   The actions described here do not depend on the
    nature of the SIP\n   URI, e.g., whether or not it describes a telephone number;
    however,\n   the same anonymous SIP URI [RFC3323] may be used by multiple callers;\n
    \  thus, such URIs are unlikely to be appropriate for URI-specific call\n   treatment.
    \ SIP entities tallying responses for particular callers\n   may need to consider
    canonicalzing SIP URIs, including telephone\n   numbers, as described in [SIP-IDENTITY].
    \ The calling party may be\n   identified in different locations in the SIP header,
    e.g., the From\n   header field, P-Asserted-Identity or History-Info, and may
    also be\n   affected by diverting services.\n   This document defines a SIP feature-capability
    [RFC6809], sip.607,\n   that allows the registrar to indicate that the corresponding
    proxy\n   supports this particular response code.  This allows the UA, for\n   example,
    to provide a suitable user-interface element, such as a\n   \"spam\" button, only
    if its service provider actually supports the\n   feature.  The presence of the
    feature capability does not imply that\n   the provider will take any particular
    action, such as blocking future\n   calls.  A UA may still decide to render a
    \"spam\" button even without\n   such a capability if, for example, it maintains
    a device-local\n   blacklist or reports unwanted calls to a third party.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   If the calling party address is spoofed, users
    may report the caller\n   identity as placing unwanted calls, possibly leading
    to the blocking\n   of calls from the legitimate user of the caller identity in
    addition\n   to the unwanted caller, i.e., creating a form of denial-of-service\n
    \  attack.  Thus, the response code SHOULD NOT be used for creating\n   global
    call filters unless the calling party identity has been\n   authenticated using
    [SIP-IDENTITY] as being assigned to the caller\n   placing the unwanted call.
    \ (The creation of call filters local to a\n   user agent is beyond the scope
    of this document.)\n   Even if the identity is not spoofed, a call or message
    recipient\n   might flag legitimate caller identities, e.g., to exact vengeance
    on\n   a person or business, or simply by mistake.  To correct errors, any\n   additions
    to a personal list of blocked caller identities should be\n   observable and reversible
    by the party being protected by the\n   blacklist.  For example, the list may
    be shown on a web page or the\n   subscriber may be notified by periodic email
    reminders.  Any\n   additions to a global or carrier-wide list of unwanted callers
    needs\n   to consider that any user-initiated mechanism will suffer from an\n
    \  unavoidable rate of false positives and tailor their algorithms\n   accordingly,
    e.g., by comparing the fraction of delivered calls for a\n   particular caller
    that are flagged as unwanted rather than just the\n   absolute number and considering
    time-weighted filters that give more\n   credence to recent feedback.\n   If an
    attacker on an unsecured network can spoof SIP responses for a\n   significant
    number of call recipients, it may be able to convince the\n   call-filtering algorithm
    to block legitimate calls.  Use of TLS to\n   protect signaling mitigates against
    this risk.\n   Since caller identities are routinely reassigned to new subscribers,\n
    \  algorithms are advised to consider whether the caller identity has\n   been
    reassigned to a new subscriber and possibly reset any related\n   rating.  (In
    some countries, there are services that track which\n   telephone numbers have
    been disconnected before they are reassigned\n   to a new subscriber.)\n   Some
    call services, such as 3PCC [RFC3725] and call transfer\n   [RFC5359], increase
    the complexity of identifying who (if anyone)\n   should be impacted by the receipt
    of 607 within BYE.  Such services\n   might cause the wrong party to be flagged
    or prevent flagging the\n   desired party.\n   For both individually authenticated
    and unauthenticated calls,\n   recipients of response code 607 may want to distinguish
    responses\n   sent before and after the call has been answered, ascertaining\n
    \  whether either response timing suffers from a lower false-positive\n   rate.\n"
