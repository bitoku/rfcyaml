  - "                          Network Use on MAY 8\n     Vint Cerf of UCLA Network\
    \ Measurement Center has just indicated\nto us a requirement to carry out certain\
    \ performance experiments on\nthe network prior to installation of the new IMP\
    \ software on May 15.\nThese experiments are designed to measure network performance\
    \ under\nheavy traffic load to a single site, and thus may cause the network to\n\
    \"lock up\" such that _no_ traffic can flow (a problem which the new IMP\nsoftware\
    \ is de- signed to prevent). Vint has indicated to us that ARPA\nregards these\
    \ experiments as extremely important in spite of the\npossibility of lockup; we\
    \ have therefore agreed to assist with the\nexperiments and scheduled them for\
    \ May 8.\n     Although we do not know whether these experiments will cause\n\
    lockup, we suggest that sites do not schedule important network work\nfor Monday,\
    \ May 8. We apologize for the lateness of this announcement.\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.  \
