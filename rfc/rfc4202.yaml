  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies routing extensions in support of\
    \ carrying\n   link state information for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching\n\
    \   (GMPLS).  This document enhances the routing extensions [ISIS-TE],\n   [OSPF-TE]\
    \ required to support MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE).\n   Traditionally, a TE link\
    \ is advertised as an adjunct to a \"regular\"\n   link, i.e., a routing adjacency\
    \ is brought up on the link, and when\n   the link is up, both the properties\
    \ of the link are used for Shortest\n   Path First (SPF) computations (basically,\
    \ the SPF metric) and the TE\n   properties of the link are then advertised.\n\
    \   GMPLS challenges this notion in three ways.  First, links that are\n   not\
    \ capable of sending and receiving on a packet-by-packet basis may\n   yet have\
    \ TE properties; however, a routing adjacency cannot be\n   brought up on such\
    \ links.  Second, a Label Switched Path can be\n   advertised as a point-to-point\
    \ TE link (see [LSP-HIER]); thus, an\n   advertised TE link may be between a pair\
    \ of nodes that don't have a\n   routing adjacency with each other.  Finally,\
    \ a number of links may be\n   advertised as a single TE link (perhaps for improved\
    \ scalability), so\n   again, there is no longer a one-to-one association of a\
    \ regular\n   routing adjacency and a TE link.\n   Thus we have a more general\
    \ notion of a TE link.  A TE link is a\n   \"logical\" link that has TE properties.\
    \  The link is logical in a\n   sense that it represents a way to group/map the\
    \ information about\n   certain physical resources (and their properties) into\
    \ the\n   information that is used by Constrained SPF for the purpose of path\n\
    \   computation, and by GMPLS signaling.  This grouping/mapping must be\n   done\
    \ consistently at both ends of the link.  LMP [LMP] could be used\n   to check/verify\
    \ this consistency.\n   Depending on the nature of resources that form a particular\
    \ TE link,\n   for the purpose of GMPLS signaling, in some cases the combination\
    \ of\n   <TE link identifier, label> is sufficient to unambiguously identify\n\
    \   the appropriate resource used by an LSP.  In other cases, the\n   combination\
    \ of <TE link identifier, label> is not sufficient; such\n   cases are handled\
    \ by using the link bundling construct [LINK-BUNDLE]\n   that allows to identify\
    \ the resource by <TE link identifier,\n   Component link identifier, label>.\n\
    \   Some of the properties of a TE link may be configured on the\n   advertising\
    \ Label Switching Router (LSR), others which may be\n   obtained from other LSRs\
    \ by means of some protocol, and yet others\n   which may be deduced from the\
    \ component(s) of the TE link.\n   A TE link between a pair of LSRs doesn't imply\
    \ the existence of a\n   routing adjacency (e.g., an IGP adjacency) between these\
    \ LSRs.  As we\n   mentioned above, in certain cases a TE link between a pair\
    \ of LSRs\n   could be advertised even if there is no routing adjacency at all\n\
    \   between the LSRs (e.g., when the TE link is a Forwarding Adjacency\n   (see\
    \ [LSP-HIER])).\n   A TE link must have some means by which the advertising LSR\
    \ can know\n   of its liveness (this means may be routing hellos, but is not limited\n\
    \   to routing hellos).  When an LSR knows that a TE link is up, and can\n   determine\
    \ the TE link's TE properties, the LSR may then advertise\n   that link to its\
    \ (regular) neighbors.\n   In this document, we call the interfaces over which\
    \ regular routing\n   adjacencies are established \"control channels\".\n   [ISIS-TE]\
    \ and [OSPF-TE] define the canonical TE properties, and say\n   how to associate\
    \ TE properties to regular (packet-switched) links.\n   This document extends\
    \ the set of TE properties, and also says how to\n   associate TE properties with\
    \ non-packet-switched links such as links\n   between Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs).\
    \  [LSP-HIER] says how to\n   associate TE properties with links formed by Label\
    \ Switched Paths.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements for Layer-Specific TE Attributes
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements for Layer-Specific TE Attributes\n   In generalizing TE links\
    \ to include traditional transport facilities,\n   there are additional factors\
    \ that influence what information is\n   needed about the TE link.  These arise\
    \ from existing transport layer\n   architecture (e.g., ITU-T Recommendations\
    \ G.805 and G.806) and\n   associated layer services.  Some of these factors are:\n\
    \   1. The need for LSPs at a specific adaptation, not just a particular\n   \
    \   bandwidth.  Clients of optical networks obtain connection services\n     \
    \ for specific adaptations, for example, a VC-3 circuit.  This not\n      only\
    \ implies a particular bandwidth, but how the payload is\n      structured.  Thus\
    \ the VC-3 client would not be satisfied with any\n      LSP that offered other\
    \ than 48.384 Mbit/s and with the expected\n      structure.  The corollary is\
    \ that path computation should be able\n      to find a route that would give\
    \ a connection at a specific\n      adaptation.\n   2. Distinguishing variable\
    \ adaptation.  A resource between two OXCs\n      (specifically a G.805 trail)\
    \ can sometimes support different\n      adaptations at the same time.  An example\
    \ of this is described in\n      section 2.4.8.  In this situation, the fact that\
    \ two adaptations\n      are supported on the same trail is important because\
    \ the two\n      layers are dependent, and it is important to be able to reflect\n\
    \      this layer relationship in routing, especially in view of the\n      relative\
    \ lack of flexibility of transport layers compared to\n      packet layers.\n\
    \   3. Inheritable attributes.  When a whole multiplexing hierarchy is\n     \
    \ supported by a TE link, a lower layer attribute may be applicable\n      to\
    \ the upper layers.  Protection attributes are a good example of\n      this.\
    \  If an OC-192 link is 1+1 protected (a duplicate OC-192\n      exists for protection),\
    \ then an STS-3c within that OC-192 (a\n      higher layer) would inherit the\
    \ same protection property.\n   4. Extensibility of layers.  In addition to the\
    \ existing defined\n      transport layers, new layers and adaptation relationships\
    \ could\n      come into existence in the future.\n   5. Heterogeneous networks\
    \ whose OXCs do not all support the same set\n      of layers.  In a GMPLS network,\
    \ not all transport layer network\n      elements are expected to support the\
    \ same layers.  For example,\n      there may be switches capable of only VC-11,\
    \ VC-12, and VC-3, and\n      there may be others that can only support VC-3 and\
    \ VC-4.  Even\n      though a network element cannot support a specific layer,\
    \ it\n      should be able to know if a network element elsewhere in the\n   \
    \   network can support an adaptation that would enable that\n      unsupported\
    \ layer to be used.  For example, a VC-11 switch could\n      use a VC-3 capable\
    \ switch if it knew that a VC-11 path could be\n      constructed over a VC-3\
    \ link connection.\n   From the factors presented above, development of layer\
    \ specific GMPLS\n   routing documents should use the following principles for\
    \ TE-link\n   attributes.\n   1. Separation of attributes.  The attributes in\
    \ a given layer are\n      separated from attributes in another layer.\n   2.\
    \ Support of inter-layer attributes (e.g., adaptation\n      relationships). \
    \ Between a client and server layer, a general\n      mechanism for describing\
    \ the layer relationship exists.  For\n      example, \"4 client links of type\
    \ X can be supported by this server\n      layer link\".  Another example is being\
    \ able to identify when two\n      layers share a common server layer.\n   3.\
    \ Support for inheritable attributes.  Attributes which can be\n      inherited\
    \ should be identified.\n   4. Layer extensibility.  Attributes should be represented\
    \ in routing\n      such that future layers can be accommodated.  This is much\
    \ like\n      the notion of the generalized label.\n   5. Explicit attribute scope.\
    \  For example, it should be clear whether\n      a given attribute applies to\
    \ a set of links at the same layer.\n   The present document captures general\
    \ attributes that apply to a\n   single layer network, but doesn't capture inter-layer\
    \ relationships\n   of attributes.  This work is left to a future document.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Excluding Data Traffic from Control Channels
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Excluding Data Traffic from Control Channels\n   The control channels between\
    \ nodes in a GMPLS network, such as OXCs,\n   SDH cross-connects and/or routers,\
    \ are generally meant for control\n   and administrative traffic.  These control\
    \ channels are advertised\n   into routing as normal links as mentioned in the\
    \ previous section;\n   this allows the routing of (for example) RSVP messages\
    \ and telnet\n   sessions.  However, if routers on the edge of the optical domain\n\
    \   attempt to forward data traffic over these channels, the channel\n   capacity\
    \ will quickly be exhausted.\n   In order to keep these control channels from\
    \ being advertised into\n   the user data plane a variety of techniques can be\
    \ used.\n   If one assumes that data traffic is sent to BGP destinations, and\n\
    \   control traffic to IGP destinations, then one can exclude data\n   traffic\
    \ from the control plane by restricting BGP nexthop resolution.\n   (It is assumed\
    \ that OXCs are not BGP speakers.)  Suppose that a\n   router R is attempting\
    \ to install a route to a BGP destination D.  R\n   looks up the BGP nexthop for\
    \ D in its IGP's routing table.  Say R\n   finds that the path to the nexthop\
    \ is over interface I.  R then\n   checks if it has an entry in its Link State\
    \ database associated with\n   the interface I.  If it does, and the link is not\
    \ packet-switch\n   capable (see [LSP-HIER]), R installs a discard route for destination\n\
    \   D.  Otherwise, R installs (as usual) a route for destination D with\n   nexthop\
    \ I.  Note that R need only do this check if it has packet-\n   switch incapable\
    \ links; if all of its links are packet-switch\n   capable, then clearly this\
    \ check is redundant.\n   In other instances it may be desirable to keep the whole\
    \ address\n   space of a GMPLS routing plane disjoint from the endpoint addresses\n\
    \   in another portion of the GMPLS network.  For example, the addresses\n   of\
    \ a carrier network where the carrier uses GMPLS but does not wish\n   to expose\
    \ the internals of the addressing or topology.  In such a\n   network the control\
    \ channels are never advertised into the end data\n   network.  In this instance,\
    \ independent mechanisms are used to\n   advertise the data addresses over the\
    \ carrier network.\n   Other techniques for excluding data traffic from control\
    \ channels may\n   also be needed.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  GMPLS Routing Enhancements\n   In this section we define the enhancements\
    \ to the TE properties of\n   GMPLS TE links.  Encoding of this information in\
    \ IS-IS is specified\n   in [GMPLS-ISIS].  Encoding of this information in OSPF\
    \ is specified\n   in [GMPLS-OSPF].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Support for Unnumbered Links
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Support for Unnumbered Links\n   An unnumbered link has to be a point-to-point\
    \ link.  An LSR at each\n   end of an unnumbered link assigns an identifier to\
    \ that link.  This\n   identifier is a non-zero 32-bit number that is unique within\
    \ the\n   scope of the LSR that assigns it.\n   Consider an (unnumbered) link\
    \ between LSRs A and B.  LSR A chooses an\n   idenfitier for that link.  So does\
    \ LSR B.  From A's perspective we\n   refer to the identifier that A assigned\
    \ to the link as the \"link\n   local identifier\" (or just \"local identifier\"\
    ), and to the identifier\n   that B assigned to the link as the \"link remote\
    \ identifier\" (or just\n   \"remote identifier\").  Likewise, from B's perspective\
    \ the identifier\n   that B assigned to the link is the local identifier, and\
    \ the\n   identifier that A assigned to the link is the remote identifier.\n \
    \  Support for unnumbered links in routing includes carrying information\n   about\
    \ the identifiers of that link.  Specifically, when an LSR\n   advertises an unnumbered\
    \ TE link, the advertisement carries both the\n   local and the remote identifiers\
    \ of the link.  If the LSR doesn't\n   know the remote identifier of that link,\
    \ the LSR should use a value\n   of 0 as the remote identifier.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Link Protection Type
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Link Protection Type\n   The Link Protection Type represents the protection\
    \ capability that\n   exists for a link.  It is desirable to carry this information\
    \ so that\n   it may be used by the path computation algorithm to set up LSPs\
    \ with\n   appropriate protection characteristics.  This information is\n   organized\
    \ in a hierarchy where typically the minimum acceptable\n   protection is specified\
    \ at path instantiation and a path selection\n   technique is used to find a path\
    \ that satisfies at least the minimum\n   acceptable protection.  Protection schemes\
    \ are presented in order\n   from lowest to highest protection.\n   This document\
    \ defines the following protection capabilities:\n   Extra Traffic\n      If the\
    \ link is of type Extra Traffic, it means that the link is\n      protecting another\
    \ link or links.  The LSPs on a link of this type\n      will be lost if any of\
    \ the links it is protecting fail.\n   Unprotected\n      If the link is of type\
    \ Unprotected, it means that there is no\n      other link protecting this link.\
    \  The LSPs on a link of this type\n      will be lost if the link fails.\n  \
    \ Shared\n      If the link is of type Shared, it means that there are one or\
    \ more\n      disjoint links of type Extra Traffic that are protecting this\n\
    \      link.  These Extra Traffic links are shared between one or more\n     \
    \ links of type Shared.\n   Dedicated 1:1\n      If the link is of type Dedicated\
    \ 1:1, it means that there is one\n      dedicated disjoint link of type Extra\
    \ Traffic that is protecting\n      this link.\n   Dedicated 1+1\n      If the\
    \ link is of type Dedicated 1+1, it means that a dedicated\n      disjoint link\
    \ is protecting this link.  However, the protecting\n      link is not advertised\
    \ in the link state database and is therefore\n      not available for the routing\
    \ of LSPs.\n   Enhanced\n      If the link is of type Enhanced, it means that\
    \ a protection scheme\n      that is more reliable than Dedicated 1+1, e.g., 4\
    \ fiber\n      BLSR/MS-SPRING, is being used to protect this link.\n      The\
    \ Link Protection Type is optional, and if a Link State\n      Advertisement doesn't\
    \ carry this information, then the Link\n      Protection Type is unknown.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Shared Risk Link Group Information
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Shared Risk Link Group Information\n   A set of links may constitute a\
    \ 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if\n   they share a resource whose failure may\
    \ affect all links in the set.\n   For example, two fibers in the same conduit\
    \ would be in the same\n   SRLG.  A link may belong to multiple SRLGs.  Thus the\
    \ SRLG\n   Information describes a list of SRLGs that the link belongs to.  An\n\
    \   SRLG is identified by a 32 bit number that is unique within an IGP\n   domain.\
    \  The SRLG Information is an unordered list of SRLGs that the\n   link belongs\
    \ to.\n   The SRLG of a LSP is the union of the SRLGs of the links in the LSP.\n\
    \   The SRLG of a bundled link is the union of the SRLGs of all the\n   component\
    \ links.\n   If an LSR is required to have multiple diversely routed LSPs to\n\
    \   another LSR, the path computation should attempt to route the paths\n   so\
    \ that they do not have any links in common, and such that the path\n   SRLGs\
    \ are disjoint.\n   The SRLG Information may start with a configured value, in\
    \ which case\n   it does not change over time, unless reconfigured.\n   The SRLG\

  - "2.4.  Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\n   In the context of this document\
    \ we say that a link is connected to a\n   node by an interface.  In the context\
    \ of GMPLS interfaces may have\n   different switching capabilities.  For example\
    \ an interface that\n   connects a given link to a node may not be able to switch\
    \ individual\n   packets, but it may be able to switch channels within an SDH\
    \ payload.\n   Interfaces at each end of a link need not have the same switching\n\
    \   capabilities.  Interfaces on the same node need not have the same\n   switching\
    \ capabilities.\n   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor describes switching\n\
    \   capability of an interface.  For bi-directional links, the switching\n   capabilities\
    \ of an interface are defined to be the same in either\n   direction.  I.e., for\
    \ data entering the node through that interface\n   and for data leaving the node\
    \ through that interface.\n   A Link State Advertisement of a link carries the\
    \ Interface Switching\n   Capability Descriptor(s) only of the near end (the end\
    \ incumbent on\n   the LSR originating the advertisement).\n   An LSR performing\
    \ path computation uses the Link State Database to\n   determine whether a link\
    \ is unidirectional or bidirectional.\n   For a bidirectional link the LSR uses\
    \ its Link State Database to\n   determine the Interface Switching Capability\
    \ Descriptor(s) of the\n   far-end of the link, as bidirectional links with different\
    \ Interface\n   Switching Capabilities at its two ends are allowed.\n   For a\
    \ unidirectional link it is assumed that the Interface Switching\n   Capability\
    \ Descriptor at the far-end of the link is the same as at\n   the near-end.  Thus,\
    \ an unidirectional link is required to have the\n   same interface switching\
    \ capabilities at both ends.  This seems a\n   reasonable assumption given that\
    \ unidirectional links arise only with\n   packet forwarding adjacencies and for\
    \ these both ends belong to the\n   same level of the PSC hierarchy.\n   This\
    \ document defines the following Interface Switching Capabilities:\n         Packet-Switch\
    \ Capable-1         (PSC-1)\n         Packet-Switch Capable-2         (PSC-2)\n\

    \ Capable            (FSC)\n   If there is no Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\
    \ for an\n   interface, the interface is assumed to be packet-switch capable\n\
    \   (PSC-1).\n   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint\n\
    \   for LSP path computation.\n   Irrespective of a particular Interface Switching\
    \ Capability, the\n   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor always includes\
    \ information\n   about the encoding supported by an interface.  The defined encodings\n\
    \   are the same as LSP Encoding as defined in [GMPLS-SIG].\n   An interface may\
    \ have more than one Interface Switching Capability\n   Descriptor.  This is used\
    \ to handle interfaces that support multiple\n   switching capabilities, for interfaces\
    \ that have Max LSP Bandwidth\n   values that differ by priority level, and for\
    \ interfaces that support\n   discrete bandwidths.\n   Depending on a particular\
    \ Interface Switching Capability, the\n   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\
    \ may include additional\n   information, as specified below.\n"
