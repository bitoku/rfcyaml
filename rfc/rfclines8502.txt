Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes two MIB modules that will be used by other MIB modules for monitoring and/or configuring Layer 2 and Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks that support multicast.
In BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used for distributing routes and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used for forwarding packets across service provider networks.
The procedures for supporting multicast in a BGP/MPLS Layer 3
VPN are specified in [RFC6513].
The procedures for supporting multicast in a BGP/MPLS Layer 2
VPN are specified in [RFC7117].
Throughout this document, we will use the term "L2L3VpnMCast network" to mean a BGP/MPLS L2 and L3 VPN that supports multicast.
L2L3VpnMCast networks use various transport mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of Provider Edge (PE) routers across service provider networks.
These transport mechanisms are abstracted as provider tunnels (P tunnels).
The type of P tunnel indicates the type of tunneling technology used to establish the P tunnel.
The syntax and semantics of a Tunnel Identifier are determined by the corresponding P tunnel type [RFC6514].
The P tunnel type and P tunnel identifier together identify a P tunnel.
A BGP attribute that specifies information of a P tunnel is called a Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)
The PMSI Tunnel attribute is advertised/received by PEs in BGP auto  discovery (A D) routes.
[RFC6514] defines the format of a PMSI Tunnel attribute.
The P tunnel type and the P tunnel identifier are included in the corresponding PMSI Tunnel attribute.
This document describes textual conventions (TCs) and common managed objects (MOs) that will be used by other Management Information Base (MIB) modules for monitoring and/or configuring L2L3VpnMCast networks.
This document defines two TCs to represent (a) the type of a P tunnel and (b) the identifier of a P tunnel The document also defines MOs that will provide the information contained in a PMSI Tunnel attribute and corresponding P tunnel.
This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms described in [RFC6513]
[RFC7117] and other documents that they refer to.
Familiarity with multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 VPN, and Multicast VPN concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.
Some terms specifically related to this document are explained below.
PMSI [RFC6513] is a conceptual interface instantiated by a P tunnel, which is a transport mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.
A PE uses it to send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.
There are two kinds of PMSIs:
Inclusive PMSI (I PMSI) and Selective PMSI (S PMSI)
I PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached to a particular Multicast VPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the same VPN.
An S PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached to a particular Multicast VPN to transmit a message to some of the PEs in the same VPN.
Throughout this document, we will use the term "PMSI" to refer to both "I PMSI" and "S PMSI".
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document defines two MIB modules:
L2L3 VPN MULTICAST TC MIB and L2L3 VPN MULTICAST MIB.
MULTICAST TC MIB contains two textual conventions:
L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType provides an enumeration of the P tunnel types.
L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId represents an identifier of a P tunnel.
L2L3 VPN MULTICAST MIB defines the following table: l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.
An entry in this table corresponds to the attribute information of a specific P tunnel on a PE router.
Entries in this table will be used by other MIB modules for monitoring and/or configuring an L2L3VpnMCast network.
The table index uniquely identifies a P tunnel.
It is composed of a type and identifier of a P tunnel.
The table may also be used in conjunction with other MIBs, such as the MPLS Traffic Engineering MIB (MPLS TE STD MIB)
[RFC3812], to obtain further information about a P tunnel.
It may also be used in conjunction with the Interfaces Group MIB (IF MIB)
[RFC2863] to obtain further information about the interface corresponding to a P tunnel.
L2L3 VPN MULTICAST TC MIB Object Definitions
This MIB module makes reference to the following documents: [RFC4875], [RFC5015], [RFC6388], [RFC7524], and [RFC7761].

"This textual convention represents the Tunnel Identifier of a P tunnel.
The size of the identifier depends on the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) and the value of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType object.
The corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType object represents the type of tunneling technology used to establish the P tunnel.
The size of the identifier for each tunneling technology is summarized below.
The Tunnel Type is set to 'No tunnel information' when the PMSI Tunnel attribute carries no tunnel information (there is no Tunnel Identifier).
The value of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be a string of length zero.
For Tunnel Type rsvpP2mp(1), the corresponding Tunnel Identifier is composed of an Extended Tunnel ID (4 octets in IPv4, 16 octets in IPv6), 2 unused (Reserved) octets that of value zero, a Tunnel ID (2 octets), and a Point to Multipoint (P2MP) ID (4 octets).
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 12 octets in IPv4 and 24 octets in IPv6.
For Tunnel Type ldpP2mp(2), the corresponding Tunnel Identifier is the P2MP Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Element (RFC 6388).
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 17 octets in IPv4 and 29 octets in IPv6.
For Tunnel Types pimSsm(3), PimAsm(4), and PimBidir(5), the corresponding Tunnel Identifier is composed of the source IP address and the group IP address.
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 8 octets in IPv4 and 32 octets in IPv6.
For Tunnel Type ingressReplication(6), the Tunnel Identifier is the unicast tunnel endpoint IP address of the local PE.
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 4 octets in IPv4 and 16 octets in IPv6.
For Tunnel Type ldpMp2mp(7), the Tunnel Identifier is a Multipoint to Multipoint (MP2MP)
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 17 octets in IPv4 and 29 octets in IPv6.
For Tunnel Type transportTunnel(8), the Tunnel Identifier is a tuple of Source PE Address and Local Number, which is a number that is unique to the Source PE (RFC 7524).
Both Source PE Address and Local Number are 4 octets in IPv4 and 16 octets in IPv6.
the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 8 octets in IPv4 and 32 octets in IPv6. "

"This object indicates the type of tunneling technology used to establish the P tunnel corresponding to this entry.
When BGP based PMSI signaling is used, the value of this object corresponds to the Tunnel Type field in the PMSI Tunnel attribute advertised/received in a PMSI auto discovery (A D) route. "
"This object represents the Tunnel Identifier field, which uniquely identifies a P tunnel, in the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the P tunnel corresponding to this entry.
The size of the identifier depends on the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) and the value of the corresponding l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeType object, i.e., the type of tunneling technology used to establish the P tunnel.
"When the value of this object is set to 1 (true), it indicates that the PE that originated the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the P tunnel corresponding to this entry requests receivers to originate a new Leaf A D route.
A value of zero (false) indicates that there is no such request.
When the P tunnel does not have a corresponding PMSI Tunnel attribute, the value of this object will be 2 (notAvailable).
In the case of multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs, this object represents the 'Leaf Information Required flag' (RFC 6514) in the Flags field in the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the P tunnel corresponding to this entry.
"This object represents the MPLS Label in the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the P tunnel corresponding to this entry.
When BGP based PMSI signaling is used, the PMSI Tunnel attribute of the P tunnel will be advertised/received in a PMSI A D route.
The value of this object corresponds to the MPLS Label in the attribute.
When the P tunnel does not have a PMSI tunnel attribute, the value of this object will be zero. "
Details of a P tunnel identified by l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeId may be present in some other table, e.g., mplsTunnelTable (RFC 3812).
This object specifies the pointer to the row that pertains to the entry in the table.
If no such entry exists, the value of this object will be zeroDotZero.
REFERENCE "RFC 3812, Sections 6.1 and 11
"If the P tunnel identified by l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeId has a corresponding entry in ifXTable (RFC 2863), this object will point to the row in ifXTable that pertains to the entry.
Otherwise, the value of this object will be zeroDotZero.

current DESCRIPTION "Support of these objects is required. "
"Support of these objects is optional. "
There are no management objects defined in these MIB modules that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the objects in these MIB modules may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
This includes INDEX objects with a MAX ACCESS of not accessible, and any indices from other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
the l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable collectively shows the P tunnel network topology and its performance characteristics.
For instance, l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeId in this table will contain the identifier that uniquely identifies a P tunnel.
This identifier may be composed of source and multicast group IP addresses.
l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelPointer and l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelIf will point to the corresponding entries in other tables containing configuration and/or performance information of a P tunnel and its interface.
If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these objects should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the "SMI Network Management
MGMT Codes Internet standard MIB" registry:
