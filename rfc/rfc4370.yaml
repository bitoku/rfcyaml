  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) Proxy Authorization Control.  The Proxy Authorization Control\n   allows\
    \ a client to request that an operation be processed under a\n   provided authorization\
    \ identity instead of under the current\n   authorization identity associated\
    \ with the connection.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy authorization allows a client to request that an operation\
    \ be\n   processed under a provided authorization identity instead of under\n\
    \   the current authorization identity associated with the connection.\n   This\
    \ document defines support for proxy authorization using the\n   Control mechanism\
    \ [RFC2251].  The Lightweight Directory Access\n   Protocol [LDAPV3] supports\
    \ the use of the Simple Authentication and\n   Security Layer [SASL] for authentication\
    \ and for supplying an\n   authorization identity distinct from the authentication\
    \ identity,\n   where the authorization identity applies to the whole LDAP session.\n\
    \   The Proxy Authorization Control provides a mechanism for specifying\n   an\
    \ authorization identity on a per-operation basis, benefiting\n   clients that\
    \ need to perform operations efficiently on behalf of\n   multiple users.\n  \
    \ The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\
    \n   used in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 2.  Publishing Support for the Proxy Authorization Control
  contents:
  - "2.  Publishing Support for the Proxy Authorization Control\n   Support for the\
    \ Proxy Authorization Control is indicated by the\n   presence of the Object Identifier\
    \ (OID) \"2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.18\" in\n   the supportedControl attribute [RFC2252]\
    \ of a server's root\n   DSA-specific Entry (DSE).\n"
- title: 3.  Proxy Authorization Control
  contents:
  - "3.  Proxy Authorization Control\n   A single Proxy Authorization Control may\
    \ be included in any search,\n   compare, modify, add, delete, or modify Distinguished\
    \ Name (DN) or\n   extended operation request message.  The exception is any extension\n\
    \   that causes a change in authentication, authorization, or data\n   confidentiality\
    \ [RFC2829], such as Start TLS [LDAPTLS] as part of the\n   controls field of\
    \ the LDAPMessage, as defined in [RFC2251].\n   The controlType of the proxy authorization\
    \ control is\n   \"2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.18\".\n   The criticality MUST be present\
    \ and MUST be TRUE.  This requirement\n   protects clients from submitting a request\
    \ that is executed with an\n   unintended authorization identity.\n   Clients\
    \ MUST include the criticality flag and MUST set it to TRUE.\n   Servers MUST\
    \ reject any request containing a Proxy Authorization\n   Control without a criticality\
    \ flag or with the flag set to FALSE with\n   a protocolError error.  These requirements\
    \ protect clients from\n   submitting a request that is executed with an unintended\n\
    \   authorization identity.\n   The controlValue SHALL be present and SHALL either\
    \ contain an authzId\n   [AUTH] representing the authorization identity for the\
    \ request or be\n   empty if an anonymous association is to be used.\n   The mechanism\
    \ for determining proxy access rights is specific to the\n   server's proxy authorization\
    \ policy.\n   If the requested authorization identity is recognized by the server,\n\
    \   and the client is authorized to adopt the requested authorization\n   identity,\
    \ the request will be executed as if submitted by the proxy\n   authorization\
    \ identity; otherwise, the result code 123 is returned.\n"
- title: 4.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementation Considerations\n   One possible interaction of proxy authorization\
    \ and normal access\n   control is illustrated here.  During evaluation of a search\
    \ request,\n   an entry that would have been returned for the search (if submitted\n\
    \   by the proxy authorization identity directly) may not be returned if\n   the\
    \ server finds that the requester does not have the right to assume\n   the requested\
    \ identity for searching the entry, even if the entry is\n   within the scope\
    \ of a search request under a base DN that does imply\n   such rights.  This means\
    \ that fewer results, or no results, may be\n   returned than would be if the\
    \ proxy authorization identity issued the\n   request directly.  An example of\
    \ such a case may be a system with\n   fine-grained access control, where the\
    \ proxy right requester has\n   proxy rights at the top of a search tree, but\
    \ not at or below a point\n   or points within the tree.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The Proxy Authorization Control method is subject\
    \ to general LDAP\n   security considerations [RFC2251] [AUTH] [LDAPTLS].  The\
    \ control may\n   be passed over a secure channel as well as over an insecure\
    \ channel.\n   The control allows for an additional authorization identity to\
    \ be\n   passed.  In some deployments, these identities may contain\n   confidential\
    \ information that requires privacy protection.\n   Note that the server is responsible\
    \ for determining if a proxy\n   authorization request is to be honored. \"Anonymous\"\
    \ users SHOULD NOT\n   be allowed to assume the identity of others.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   The OID \"2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.18\" is reserved\
    \ for the Proxy\n   Authorization Control.  It has been registered as an LDAP\
    \ Protocol\n   Mechanism [RFC3383].\n   A result code (123) has been assigned\
    \ by the IANA for the case where\n   the server does not execute a request using\
    \ the proxy authorization\n   identity.\n"
