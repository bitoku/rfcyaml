  - "Revision of the Mail Box Protocol\n                   REVISION OF THE MAIL BOX\
    \ PROTOCOL\n   The file transfer committee met and discussed the Mail Box Protocol\n\
    \   RFC 221, NIC 7612.  The potential utility for the mechanism was\n   confirmed\
    \ and a couple of changes suggested.  We first give the\n   changes and then restate\
    \ the Protocol.\n   1) The Mail Box Protocol is only to allow ASCII stings of\
    \ text\n   formatted for a network standard line printer rather than allowing\n\
    \   other data types.\n   2) A new command is to be added to the File Transfer\
    \ Protocol called\n   \"Append With Create\" which appends to a file if the file\
    \ exists, and\n   creates a file if it does not exist.\n   3) The standard path\
    \ name for the mailbox is to be, using conventional\n   metalanguage symbols,\n\
    \      \"MAIL\" <separator> (\"PRINTER\"/<ident>)\n      <separator> is the ASCII\
    \ GS, octal 035.  The semantics of\n      the above are the following:\n     \
    \ <ident> is a NIC IDENT\n      \"MAIL\" <separator> \"PRINTER\" would be interpreted\
    \ by the\n      receiving site as meaning Append With Create the\n      transmitted\
    \ file to a bulk mail file to be printed or\n      directly output it to a printer.\n\
    \      \"MAIL\" <separator> <ident> would be interpreted to mean\n      either\n\
    \         1) The same as \"MAIL\" <separator> \"PRINTER\" i.e., ignore\n     \
    \    <ident> or\n         2) Append With Create the following file to a file\n\
    \         specifically for the person designated by <ident> for\n         either\
    \ online access or printing or both.\n   The problem of delivering mail to TIPs\
    \ was discussed.\n   At the moment TIPs support only the Telnet Protocol, but\
    \ it is planned\n   to support the Data Transfer Protocol.  TIPs will have an\
    \ ASCII line\n   printer available as an optional device.  People desiring to\
    \ send a\n   mail item to a TIP with a printer can open a standard published socket\n\
    \   and transmit to it with Telnet Protocol now, later also with the Data\n  \
    \ Transfer Protocol.  The NIC's plans with regard to TIPs is not to do\n   automatic\
    \ network delivery to them.  Messages to people using TIPs can\n   be sent to\
    \ them through the NIC and will be delivered as with everyone\n   else directly\
    \ to the person's initial file at the NIC. The TIP user\n   can read the item\
    \ online or obtain a hardcopy at his terminal with the\n   Output Device Teletype\
    \ command of NLS.\n                           MAIL BOX PROTOCOL\n   The Mail Box\
    \ Protocol will use established network conventions,\n   specifically the Network\
    \ Control Program, Initial Connection Protocol,\n   Data Transfer Protocol, and\
    \ File Transfer Protocol (as described in\n   current Network Protocols, NIC 7104).\n\
    \   The transmission is to be Network ASCII.  The standard receiving mail\n  \
    \ printer is assumed to have a print line 72 characters wide, and a page\n   of\
    \ 66 lines.  The new line convention will be carriage return (Hex\n   per the\
    \ Telnet Protocol, RFC 158, NIC 6768.  The standard printer will\n   accept form\
    \ feed character (Hex '0C') (Octal '014') as meaning move\n   paper to the top\
    \ of a new page.\n   It is the sender's responsibility to control the length of\
    \ the print\n   line and page.  If more than 72 characters per line are sent,\
    \ or if\n   more than 66 line are sent without a form feed, then the receiving\n\
    \   site can handle these situations as appropriate for them.  These\n   conventions\
    \ can be changed by control codes as described below.  At\n   the head of the\
    \ message or document sent there is to be two copies of\n   an initial address\
    \ string each terminated by a form feed.  This\n   address string is to contain\
    \ the sender's name and address, and the\n   receiver's name and address formatted\
    \ in some reasonable, easy-to read\n   form for a clerk to read and distribute.\
    \  Comments could also be\n   included in the address string.  The requirements\
    \ for two copies are\n   to make one readable from a fan fold paper stack without\
    \ effort.\n   Initial Connection\n   Initial Connection will be as per the Official\
    \ Initial Connection\n   Protocol, Document #2, NIC 7101, to the standard File\
    \ Transfer socket\n   #3.\n   File Transfer\n   The mail item (file) to be transferred\
    \ would be transferred according\n   to the File Transfer Protocol.\n   As per\
    \ the File Transfer Protocol, a file (mail item) can be sent in\n   more than\
    \ one data transaction as defined in the Data Transfer\n   Protocol.  End of file\
    \ is indicated by the file separator (as defined\n   in Data Transfer Protocol)\
    \ or by closing the connection.\n   Order of Transactions\n   The only basic operation\
    \ required is an Append With Create\n                   Append With Create Request\n\
