- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   The CMC (Certificate Management over CMS) protocol is designed\
    \ in\n   terms of a client/server relationship.  In the simplest case, the\n \
    \  client is the requestor of the certificate (i.e., the End Entity\n   (EE))\
    \ and the server is the issuer of the certificate (i.e., the\n   Certification\
    \ Authority (CA)).  The introduction of a Registration\n   Authority (RA) into\
    \ the set of agents complicates the picture only\n   slightly.  The RA becomes\
    \ the server with respect to the certificate\n   requestor, and it becomes the\
    \ client with respect to the certificate\n   issuer.  Any number of RAs can be\
    \ inserted into the picture in this\n   manner.\n   The RAs may serve specialized\
    \ purposes that are not currently covered\n   by this document.  One such purpose\
    \ would be a Key Escrow agent.  As\n   such, all certificate requests for encryption\
    \ keys would be directed\n   through this RA and it would take appropriate action\
    \ to do the key\n   archival.  Key recovery requests could be defined in the CMC\n\
    \   methodology allowing for the Key Escrow agent to perform that\n   operation\
    \ acting as the final server in the chain of agents.\n   If there are multiple\
    \ RAs in the system, it is considered normal that\n   not all RAs will see all\
    \ certificate requests.  The routing between\n   the RAs may be dependent on the\
    \ content of the certificate requests\n   involved.\n   This document is divided\
    \ into six sections, each section specifying\n   the requirements that are specific\
    \ to a class of agents in the CMC\n   model.  These are 1) All agents, 2) all\
    \ servers, 3) all clients, 4)\n   all End-Entities, 5) all Registration Entities,\
    \ 6) all Certificate\n   Authorities.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   There are several different terms, abbreviations, and acronyms\
    \ used\n   in this document that we define here for convenience and consistency\n\
    \   of usage:\n   End-Entity  (EE) refers to the entity that owns a key pair and\
    \ for\n      whom a certificate is issued.\n   Registration Authority (RA)  or\
    \ Local RA (LRA) refers to an entity\n      that acts as an intermediary between\
    \ the EE and the CA.  Multiple\n      RAs can exist between the End-Entity and\
    \ the Certification\n      Authority.  RAs may perform additional services such\
    \ as key\n      generation or key archival.  This document uses the term RA for\n\
    \      both RA and LRA.\n   Certification Authority (CA)  refers to the entity\
    \ that issues\n      certificates.\n   Client  refers to an entity that creates\
    \ a PKI Request.  In this\n      document, both RAs and EEs can be clients.\n\
    \   Server  refers to the entities that process PKI Requests and create\n    \
    \  PKI Responses.  In this document both CAs and RAs can be servers.\n   PKCS\
    \ #10  refers to the Public Key Cryptography Standard #10\n      [PKCS10], which\
    \ defines a certification request syntax.\n   CRMF  refers to the Certificate\
    \ Request Message Format RFC [CRMF].\n      CMC uses this certification request\
    \ syntax defined in this\n      document as part of the protocol.\n   CMS  refers\
    \ to the Cryptographic Message Syntax RFC [CMS].  This\n      document provides\
    \ for basic cryptographic services including\n      encryption and signing with\
    \ and without key management.\n   PKI Request/Response  refers to the requests/responses\
    \ described in\n      this document.  PKI Requests include certification requests,\n\
    \      revocation requests, etc.  PKI Responses include certs-only\n      messages,\
    \ failure messages, etc.\n   Proof-of-Identity  refers to the client proving they\
    \ are who they say\n      that they are to the server.\n   Proof-of-Possession\
    \ (POP)  refers to a value that can be used to\n      prove that the private key\
    \ corresponding to a public key is in the\n      possession and can be used by\
    \ an end-entity.\n   Transport wrapper  refers to the outermost CMS wrapping layer.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [MUST].\n"
- title: 4.  Requirements for All Entities
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements for All Entities\n   All [CMC-STRUCT] and [CMC-TRANS] compliance\
    \ statements MUST be\n   adhered to unless specifically stated otherwise in this\
    \ document.\n   All entities MUST support Full PKI Requests, Simple PKI Responses,\n\
    \   and Full PKI Responses.  Servers SHOULD support Simple PKI Requests.\n   All\
    \ entities MUST support the use of the CRMF syntax for\n   certification requests.\
    \  Support for the PKCS #10 syntax for\n   certification requests SHOULD be implemented\
    \ by servers.\n   The extendedFailInfo field SHOULD NOT be populated in the\n\
    \   CMCStatusInfoV2 object; the failInfo field SHOULD be used to relay\n   this\
    \ information.  If the extendedFailInfo field is used, it is\n   suggested that\
    \ an additional CMCStatusInfoV2 item exist for the same\n   body part with a failInfo\
    \ field.\n   All entities MUST implement the HTTP transport mechanism as defined\n\
    \   in [CMC-TRANS].  Other transport mechanisms MAY be implemented.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Cryptographic Algorithm Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Cryptographic Algorithm Requirements\n   All entities MUST verify DSA-SHA1\
    \ and RSA-SHA1 signatures in\n   SignedData (see [CMS-ALG]).  Entities MAY verify\
    \ other signature\n   algorithms.  It is strongly suggested that RSA-PSS with\
    \ SHA-1 be\n   verified (see [CMS-RSA-PSS]).  It is strongly suggested that SHA-256\n\
    \   using RSA and RSA-PSS be verified (see [RSA-256]).\n   All entities MUST generate\
    \ either DSA-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 signatures for\n   SignedData (see [CMS-ALG]). \
    \ Other signatures algorithms MAY be used\n   for generation.\n   All entities\
    \ MUST support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the\n   content encryption\
    \ algorithm for EnvelopedData (see [CMS-AES]).\n   Other content encryption algorithms\
    \ MAY be implemented.\n   All entities MUST support RSA as a key transport algorithm\
    \ for\n   EnvelopedData (see [CMS-ALG]).  All entities SHOULD support RSA-OAEP\n\
    \   (see [CMS-RSA-OAEP]) as a key transport algorithm.  Other key\n   transport\
    \ algorithms MAY be implemented.\n   If an entity supports key agreement for EnvelopedData,\
    \ it MUST\n   support Diffie-Hellman (see [CMS-DH]).\n   If an entity supports\
    \ PasswordRecipientInfo for EnvelopedData or\n   AuthenticatedData, it MUST support\
    \ PBKDF2 [PBKDF2] for key derivation\n   algorithms.  It MUST support AES key\
    \ wrap (see [AES-WRAP] as the key\n   encryption algorithm.\n   If AuthenticatedData\
    \ is supported, PasswordRecipientInfo MUST be\n   supported.\n   Algorithm requirements\
    \ for the Identity Proof Version 2 control\n   (Section 6.2.1 of [CMC-STRUCT])\
    \ are: SHA-1 MUST be implemented for\n   hashAlgId.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented\
    \ for hashAlgId.  HMAC-SHA1\n   MUST be implemented for macAlgId.  HMAC-SHA256\
    \ SHOULD be implemented\n   for macAlgId.\n   Algorithm requirements for the Pop\
    \ Link Witness Version 2 control\n   (Section 6.3.1 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1\
    \ MUST be implemented for\n   keyGenAlgorithm.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented\
    \ for keyGenAlgorithm.\n   PBKDF2 [PBKDF2] MAY be implemented for keyGenAlgorithm.\
    \  HMAC-SHA1\n   MUST be implemented for macAlgorithm.  HMAC-SHA256 SHOULD be\n\
    \   implemented for macAlgorithm.\n   Algorithm requirements for the Encrypted\
    \ POP and Decrypted POP\n   controls (Section 6.7 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1\
    \ MUST be implemented\n   for witnessAlgID.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented for\
    \ witnessAlgID.\n   HMAC-SHA1 MUST be implemented for thePOPAlgID.  HMAC-SHA256\
    \ SHOULD be\n   implemented for thePOPAlgID.\n   Algorithm requirements for Publish\
    \ Trust Anchors control (Section\n   6.15 of [CMC-STRUCT]) are: SHA-1 MUST be\
    \ implemented for\n   hashAlgorithm.  SHA-256 SHOULD be implemented for hashAlgorithm.\n\
    \   If an EE generates DH keys for certification, it MUST support section\n  \
    \ 4 of [DH-POP].  EEs MAY support Section 3 of [DH-POP].  CAs and RAs\n   that\
    \ do POP verification MUST support Section 4 of [DH-POP] and\n   SHOULD support\
    \ Section 3 of [DH-POP].\n   EEs that need to use a signature algorithm for keys\
    \ that cannot\n   produce a signature MUST support Appendix C of [CMC-STRUCT]\
    \ and MUST\n   support the Encrypted/Decrypted POP controls.  CAs and RAs that\
    \ do\n   POP verification MUST support this signature algorithm and MUST\n   support\
    \ the Encrypted/Decrypted POP controls.\n"

    \  It is\n   replaced by issuing the new certificate and using the id-cmc-\n \
    \  publishCert to remove the old certificate from publication.  This\n   operation\
    \ would not normally be accompanied by an immediate\n   revocation of the old\
    \ certificate; however, that can be accomplished\n   by the id-cmc-revokeRequest\
    \ control.\n   The id-regCtrl-protocolEncrKey is not used.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Requirements for EEs\n   If an entity implements Diffie-Hellman, it MUST\
    \ implement either the\n   DH-POP Proof-of-Possession as defined in [DH-POP],\
    \ Section 4, or the\n   challenge-response POP controls id-cmc-encryptedPOP and\
    \ id-cmc-\n   decryptedPOP.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Requirements for RAs\n   RAs SHOULD be able to do delegated POP.  RAs implementing\
    \ this\n   feature MUST implement the id-cmc-lraPOPWitness control.\n   All RAs\
    \ MUST implement the promotion of the id-aa-cmc-unsignedData as\n   covered in\
    \ Section 3.2.3 of [CMC-STRUCT].\n"
- title: 8.  Requirements for CAs
  contents:
  - "8.  Requirements for CAs\n   Providing for CAs to work in an environment with\
    \ RAs is strongly\n   suggested.  Implementation of such support is strongly suggested\
    \ as\n   this permits the delegation of substantial administrative interaction\n\
    \   onto an RA rather than at the CA.\n   CAs MUST perform at least minimal checks\
    \ on all public keys before\n   issuing a certificate.  At a minimum, a check\
    \ for syntax would occur\n   with the POP operation.  Additionally, CAs SHOULD\
    \ perform simple\n   checks for known bad keys such as small subgroups for DSA-SHA1\
    \ and DH\n   keys [SMALL-SUB-GROUP] or known bad exponents for RSA keys.\n   CAs\
    \ MUST enforce POP checking before issuing any certificate.  CAs\n   MAY delegate\
    \ the POP operation to an RA for those cases where 1) a\n   challenge/response\
    \ message pair must be used, 2) an RA performs\n   escrow of a key and checks\
    \ for POP in that manner, or 3) an unusual\n   algorithm is used and that validation\
    \ is done at the RA.\n   CAs SHOULD implement both the DH-POP Proof-of-Possession\
    \ as defined\n   in [DH-POP], Section 4, and the challenge-response POP controls\
    \ id-\n   cmc-encryptedPOP and id-cmc-decryptedPOP.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document uses [CMC-STRUCT] and [CMC-TRANS]\
    \ as building blocks to\n   this document.  The security sections of those two\
    \ documents are\n   included by reference.\n   Knowledge of how an entity is expected\
    \ to operate is vital in\n   determining which sections of requirements are applicable\
    \ to that\n   entity.  Care needs to be taken in determining which sections apply\n\
    \   and fully implementing the necessary code.\n   Cryptographic algorithms have\
    \ and will be broken or weakened.\n   Implementers and users need to check that\
    \ the cryptographic\n   algorithms listed in this document make sense from a security\
    \ level.\n   The IETF from time to time may issue documents dealing with the\n\
    \   current state of the art.  Two examples of such documents are\n   [SMALL-SUB-GROUP]\
    \ and [HASH-ATTACKS].\n"
