  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2460] defines an IPv6 extension header called \"Routing\
    \ Header\",\n   identified by a Next Header value of 43 in the immediately preceding\n\
    \   header.  A particular Routing Header subtype denoted as \"Type 0\" is\n  \
    \ also defined.  Type 0 Routing Headers are referred to as \"RH0\" in\n   this\
    \ document.\n   A single RH0 may contain multiple intermediate node addresses,\
    \ and\n   the same address may be included more than once in the same RH0.\n \
    \  This allows a packet to be constructed such that it will oscillate\n   between\
    \ two RH0-processing hosts or routers many times.  This allows\n   a stream of\
    \ packets from an attacker to be amplified along the path\n   between two remote\
    \ routers, which could be used to cause congestion\n   along arbitrary remote\
    \ paths and hence act as a denial-of-service\n   mechanism.  An 88-fold amplification\
    \ has been demonstrated using this\n   technique [CanSecWest07].\n   This attack\
    \ is particularly serious in that it affects the entire\n   path between the two\
    \ exploited nodes, not only the nodes themselves\n   or their local networks.\
    \  Analogous functionality may be found in the\n   IPv4 source route option, but\
    \ the opportunities for abuse are greater\n   with RH0 due to the ability to specify\
    \ many more intermediate node\n   addresses in each packet.\n   The severity of\
    \ this threat is considered to be sufficient to warrant\n   deprecation of RH0\
    \ entirely.  A side effect is that this also\n   eliminates benign RH0 use-cases;\
    \ however, such applications may be\n   facilitated by future Routing Header specifications.\n\
    \   Potential problems with RH0 were identified in 2001 [Security].  In\n   2002\
    \ a proposal was made to restrict Routing Header processing in\n   hosts [Hosts].\
    \  These efforts resulted in the modification of the\n   Mobile IPv6 specification\
    \ to use the type 2 Routing Header instead of\n   RH0 [RFC3775].  Vishwas Manral\
    \ identified various risks associated\n   with RH0 in 2006 including the amplification\
    \ attack; several of these\n   vulnerabilities (together with other issues) were\
    \ later documented in\n   [RFC4942].\n   A treatment of the operational security\
    \ implications of RH0 was\n   presented by Philippe Biondi and Arnaud Ebalard\
    \ at the CanSecWest\n   conference in Vancouver, 2007 [CanSecWest07].  This presentation\n\
    \   resulted in widespread publicity for the risks associated with RH0.\n   This\
    \ document updates [RFC2460] and [RFC4294].\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   RH0 in this document denotes the IPv6 Extension Header type\
    \ 43\n   (\"Routing Header\") variant 0 (\"Type 0 Routing Header\"), as defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC2460].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Deprecation of RH0
  contents:
  - "3.  Deprecation of RH0\n   An IPv6 node that receives a packet with a destination\
    \ address\n   assigned to it and that contains an RH0 extension header MUST NOT\n\
    \   execute the algorithm specified in the latter part of Section 4.4 of\n   [RFC2460]\
    \ for RH0.  Instead, such packets MUST be processed according\n   to the behaviour\
    \ specified in Section 4.4 of [RFC2460] for a datagram\n   that includes an unrecognised\
    \ Routing Type value, namely:\n      If Segments Left is zero, the node must ignore\
    \ the Routing header\n      and proceed to process the next header in the packet,\
    \ whose type\n      is identified by the Next Header field in the Routing header.\n\
    \      If Segments Left is non-zero, the node must discard the packet and\n  \
    \    send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the packet's\n      Source\
    \ Address, pointing to the unrecognized Routing Type.\n   IPv6 implementations\
    \ are no longer required to implement RH0 in any\n   way.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Ingress Filtering
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Ingress Filtering\n   It is to be expected that it will take some time\
    \ before all IPv6\n   nodes are updated to remove support for RH0.  Some of the\
    \ uses of RH0\n   described in [CanSecWest07] can be mitigated using ingress filtering,\n\
    \   as recommended in [RFC2827] and [RFC3704].\n   A site security policy intended\
    \ to protect against attacks using RH0\n   SHOULD include the implementation of\
    \ ingress filtering at the site\n   border.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Firewall Policy
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Firewall Policy\n   Blocking all IPv6 packets that carry Routing Headers\
    \ (rather than\n   specifically blocking Type 0 and permitting other types) has\
    \ very\n   serious implications for the future development of IPv6.  If even a\n\
    \   small percentage of deployed firewalls block other types of Routing\n   Headers\
    \ by default, it will become impossible in practice to extend\n   IPv6 Routing\
    \ Headers.  For example, Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] relies upon\n   a Type 2 Routing\
    \ Header; wide-scale, indiscriminate blocking of\n   Routing Headers will make\
    \ Mobile IPv6 undeployable.\n   Firewall policy intended to protect against packets\
    \ containing RH0\n   MUST NOT simply filter all traffic with a Routing Header;\
    \ it must be\n   possible to disable forwarding of Type 0 traffic without blocking\n\
    \   other types of Routing Headers.  In addition, the default\n   configuration\
    \ MUST permit forwarding of traffic using a Routing\n   Header other than 0.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The purpose of this document is to deprecate\
    \ a feature of IPv6 that\n   has been shown to have undesirable security implications.\
    \  Specific\n   examples of vulnerabilities that are facilitated by the availability\n\
    \   of RH0 can be found in [CanSecWest07].  In particular, RH0 provides a\n  \
    \ mechanism for traffic amplification, which might be used as a denial-\n   of-service\
    \ attack.  A description of this functionality can be found\n   in Section 1.\n"
