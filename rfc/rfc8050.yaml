  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MRT record format [RFC6396] was developed to provide
    researchers\n   and engineers a means to encapsulate, export, and archive routing\n
    \  protocol transactions and RIB snapshots.\n   The Advertisement of Multiple
    Paths in BGP [RFC7911] defines a BGP\n   extension to allow the advertisement
    of multiple paths for the same\n   address prefix without the new paths implicitly
    replacing any\n   previous ones.\n   This document contains an optional extension
    to the MRT format\n   [RFC6396] and introduces additional definitions of MRT subtype
    fields\n   to permit representation of multiple path advertisements [RFC7911].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Rationale\n   MRT parsers are usually stateless.  In order to parse BGP messages\n
    \  that contain data structures that depend on the capabilities\n   negotiated
    during the BGP session setup, the MRT subtypes are\n   utilized.  The Advertisement
    of Multiple Paths [RFC7911] extension\n   for BGP alters the encoding of the BGP
    Network Layer Reachability\n   Information (NLRI) format for withdraws and announcements.\n
    \  Therefore, new BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET subtypes as defined in [RFC6396] are\n   required
    to signal to an MRT parser how to parse the NLRI.\n   In Section 4.3 of the MRT
    specification [RFC6396], RIB subtypes are\n   specified.  Prefix length and prefix
    fields are encoded in the same\n   manner as the BGP NLRI encoding.  In order
    to support Path Identifier\n   information as defined in [RFC7911], new subtypes
    need to be added.\n   The following two sections define the required subtypes.\n"
  title: 2.  Rationale
- contents:
  - "3.  MRT Subtypes for Types BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET\n   This document defines the following
    new subtypes:\n   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_ADDPATH\n   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_ADDPATH\n
    \  o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_LOCAL_ADDPATH\n   o  BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_LOCAL_ADDPATH\n   The
    fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent\n   non-additional-path
    versions specified in Section 4.4 of [RFC6396].\n   These enhancements continue
    to encapsulate the entire BGP message in\n   the BGP message field.\n"
  title: 3.  MRT Subtypes for Types BGP4MP/BGP4MP_ET
- contents:
  - "4.  MRT Subtypes for Type TABLE_DUMP_V2\n   This document defines the following
    new subtypes:\n   o  RIB_IPV4_UNICAST_ADDPATH\n   o  RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST_ADDPATH\n
    \  o  RIB_IPV6_UNICAST_ADDPATH\n   o  RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST_ADDPATH\n   o  RIB_GENERIC_ADDPATH\n
    \  The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent\n   non-additional-path
    versions specified in Section 4.3 of [RFC6396].\n   However, for the case of the
    4 AFI/SAFI-specific RIB subtypes, the\n   existing RIB Entries field is redefined
    as detailed in the sections\n   below.\n"

    additional security\n   considerations.  However, the security considerations
    of [RFC6396]\n   are equally applicable to this document, because this document\n
    \  permits the export of more detailed routing data.\n   An organization that
    uses the MRT format to store their BGP routing\n   information should be aware
    that supporting these extensions permits\n   more detailed network path information
    to be stored and should\n   consider the implications of this within their environment.\n
    \  An organization that peers with public BGP collectors and enables the\n   capability
    for additional paths on a peering session should be aware\n   that it is exporting
    not only its best paths, but potentially other\n   paths within its networks.
    \ The BGP peer should consider any and all\n   implications of exposing this additional
    data.\n"
