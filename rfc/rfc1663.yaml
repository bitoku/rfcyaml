  - "1.  Introduction\n   By default, PPP packets over HDLC framed links consist of\n\
    \   \"connectionless\" datagrams.  If reliable transmission over the HDLC\n  \
    \ link is desired, the implementation MUST specify the Numbered-Mode\n   Configuration\
    \ Option during Link Establishment phase.\n   Generally, serial link reliability\
    \ is not a major issue.  The\n   architecture of protocols used in datagram networking\
    \ presume\n   best-effort non-sequential delivery.  When errors are detected,\n\
    \   datagrams\n   are discarded.\n   However, in certain circumstances, it is\
    \ advisable to provide a\n   reliable link, at least for a subset of the messages.\
    \  The most\n   obvious case is when the link is compressed.  Since the dictionary\
    \ is\n   recovered from the compressed data stream, and a lost datagram\n   corrupts\
    \ the dictionary, datagrams must not be lost.  Not all\n   compression types will\
    \ require a reliable data stream, since the cost\n   to detect and reset a corrupt\
    \ dictionary is small.\n   The ISO 7776 LAPB can be used guarantee delivery. \
    \ This is referred\n   to in this document as \"Numbered Mode\" to distinguish\
    \ it from the use\n   of \"Unnumbered Information\", which is standard PPP framing\
    \ practice.\n   Where multiple parallel links are used to emulate a single link\
    \ of\n   higher speed, Bridged traffic, Source Routed traffic, and traffic\n \
    \  subjected to Van Jacobsen TCP/IP header compression must be delivered\n   to\
    \ the higher layer in a certain sequence.  However, the fact of the\n   links\
    \ being relatively asynchronous makes traffic ordering uncertain.\n   The ISO\
    \ 7776 Multi-Link Procedure MAY be used to restore order.\n   Implementation of\
    \ the ISO Multi-Link Procedure is deprecated.  It is\n   recommended that the\
    \ PPP multilink procedure [4] be used instead.\n"
- title: 2.  Physical Layer Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP Reliable Transmission imposes the same\
    \ requirements that are\n   described in \"PPP in HDLC Framing\" [3], with the\
    \ following\n   exceptions.\n   Control Signals\n      While PPP does not normally\
    \ require the use of control signals,\n      implementation of Numbered-Mode LAPB\
    \ or LAPD requires the\n      provision of control signals, which indicate when\
    \ the link has\n      become connected or disconnected.  These in turn provide\
    \ the Up\n      and Down events to the LCP state machine.\n"
- title: 3.  The Data Link Layer
  contents:
  - "3.  The Data Link Layer\n   Numbered-Mode affects only the Address and Control\
    \ fields.  The\n   remainder of the frame conforms to the framing in use for PPP.\n\
    \   The Address Field of the frame MUST take the value announced in the\n   Numbered-Mode\
    \ Configuration Option, and the Control Field MAY take\n   any value valid in\
    \ ISO 7776.\n   Once the link enters Numbered-Mode, Numbered-Mode MUST be used\
    \ on all\n   frames, as some implementations do not support the use of the\n \
    \  Unnumbered-Information control field or the use of the All-Stations\n   address\
    \ intermixed with Numbered-Mode frames.\n"

    \   Type\n      11\n   Length\n      >= 4\n   Window\n      A value between 1\
    \ and 127.  This indicates the number of frames\n      the receiver will buffer,\
    \ which is the maximum number that the\n      sender should send without receiving\
    \ an acknowledgement.  If\n      window < 8, then modulo 8 sequencing is used\
    \ on the link.\n      Otherwise, modulo 128 sequencing is used.\n      It is conceivable\
    \ and legal that differing window values might be\n      announced.  However,\
    \ it is not permitted for one system to use\n      modulo 8 sequencing and the\
    \ other to use modulo 128.  Therefore,\n      the rule is: a Configure-Nak may\
    \ reduce the window but may not\n      increase it.\n   Address\n      An HDLC\
    \ Address as specified in ISO 3309.  ISO 7776 specifies four\n      of the possible\
    \ values: 1 and 3 for single link operation, 7 and\n      15 for the Multi-Link\
    \ Procedure.  Other values consistent with ISO\n      3309 are considered legal.\n\
    \      Implementation of the Multi-Link Procedure is optional; A\n      Configure-Nak\
    \ may therefore force a change from MLP to single link\n      mode, but not the\
    \ reverse.\n      Should the address be zero upon receipt, the receiver MUST\n\
    \      Configure-Nak with an appropriate address.  If both peers send\n      address\
    \ zero, the system advertising the numerically smaller\n      window will select\
    \ the smaller address.  If both windows are the\n      same size, a random choice\
    \ MUST be made; when good sources of\n      randomness are used, the link will\
    \ converge in a reasonable time.\n      If magic numbers have been negotiated\
    \ on the link, the system with\n      the numerically smaller magic number SHOULD\
    \ specify the smaller\n      address.\n"
- title: 5.  Numbered-Mode Operation
  contents:
  - "5.  Numbered-Mode Operation\n   When using the Numbered-Mode, each link is established\
    \ in the usual\n   manner for the type of link.  The Numbered-Mode Configuration\
    \ Option\n   is negotiated, the Magic-Number Configuration Option MUST also be\n\
    \   negotiated, and the Address-and-Control-Field-Compression\n   Configuration\
    \ Option MUST NOT be negotiated.\n   Following the successful negotiation of the\
    \ Numbered-Mode\n   Configuration Option during LCP Link Establishment phase,\
    \ the system\n   with the numerically smaller Magic-Number will send a SABM or\n\
    \   SABM(E), and the other will respond with a UA.  In the event that\n   either\
    \ the SABM or UA is lost, this exchange may be repeated\n   according to the same\
    \ parameters as the configuration exchange\n   itself, using the Restart Timer\
    \ and counter values.  Authentication,\n   Link Quality Determination, and NCP\
    \ Configuration follow this step.\n   Once the link has been established with\
    \ Numbered-Mode, when re-\n   negotiation of link configuration occurs, the entire\
    \ re-negotiation\n   MUST be conducted in Numbered-Mode.  If the Numbered-Mode\n\
    \   Configuration Option is not successfully re-negotiated, the link\n   reverts\
    \ to Unnumbered-Information operation prior to Authentication,\n   Link Quality\
    \ Determination, and NCP Configuration.\n   When an implementation which is capable\
    \ of Numbered-Mode, and is not\n   currently configured for Numbered-Mode operation,\
    \ detects a frame\n   which has a correct FCS but does not have a UI Control octet,\
    \ the\n   implementation MUST send a DM message, immediately followed by a LCP\n\
    \   Configure-Request.\n   When an implementation which is currently configured\
    \ for Numbered-\n   Mode operation receives a DM message, it MUST revert to Unnumbered-\n\
    \   Information operation, and immediately send a LCP Configure-Request.\n"

- title: 5.2.  Inverse Multiplexing
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Inverse Multiplexing\n   Since sending several connections over a single\
    \ link is often called\n   \"multiplexing\", sending packets from a single connection\
    \ over\n   multiple parallel links is sometimes called \"inverse-multiplexing\"\
    .\n   By default, PPP performs no special processing for such links.  Each\n \
    \  link is established and terminated independently, negotiates its own\n   configuration\
    \ options, and may have different combinations of such\n   options as ACCM, Protocol\
    \ Field Compression and IP-Address.  This\n   facilitates using the links simultaneously\
    \ over dissimilar media,\n   such as 56K sync with async backup.\n   Every link\
    \ in a single machine MUST have different Magic Numbers, and\n   each end of every\
    \ link between two peers SHOULD have Magic Numbers\n   which are unique to those\
    \ peers.  This protects against patch-panel\n   errors in addition to looped-back\
    \ links.\n   The distribution to each link is controlled by higher level routing\n\
    \   mechanisms.  When Network-Layer specific compression techniques (such\n  \
    \ as Van Jacobsen Compression) rely on sequential delivery, without\n   Multi-Link\
    \ Procedure support such compression MUST be applied on a\n   link by link basis.\n\

  - "5.4.  LAPB Parameter defaults\n   The following guidelines specify the default\
    \ values of LAPB\n   configurable parameters.\n      Timer T1\n         Timer\
    \ T1 is the maximum time permitted before a retransmission\n         is started,\
    \ as a result of no response to a transmitted I\n         frame.  This value must\
    \ be greater than the time required for a\n         maximum sized frame to be\
    \ received by the other side of the\n         link, and for a response to be generated\
    \ for the frame.  This\n         SHOULD be determined dynamically, based on the\
    \ measured round\n         trip time delay of the link at the LAPB level.  In\
