  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has specified the Push to\
    \ talk over\n   Cellular (PoC) service, which uses the Session Initiation Protocol\n\
    \   (SIP) [3] and Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)-list services [5]\n   (more\
    \ information about OMA PoC can be found at [8]).\n   OMA PoC needs a mechanism\
    \ for servers to refuse the handling of\n   incoming URI lists when these have\
    \ embedded URI lists.  Such a\n   mechanism is intended to be used to establish\
    \ a particular type of\n   PoC session called an ad-hoc PoC group session.\n \
    \  The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  Section 3\n   describes\
    \ the scenario where the mechanism will be used.  Section 4\n   provides an overview\
    \ of the mechanism, which includes a new P-Header\n   called P-Refused-URI-List.\
    \  Section 5 defines the syntax of this new\n   P-Header.  Section 6 specifies\
    \ how to use the P-Header.  Section 7\n   provides a usage example.  Section 8\
    \ describes the applicability of\n   the P-Header.  Security considerations are\
    \ discussed in Section 9\n   and, finally, the IANA considerations are stated\
    \ in Section 10.\n"

- title: 3.  Usage Scenario
  contents:
  - "3.  Usage Scenario\n   An ad-hoc PoC group session is a type of multi-party PoC\
    \ session.\n   The originator of a particular ad-hoc PoC group session chooses\
    \ in an\n   ad-hoc manner (e.g., selecting from an address book) the set of\n\
    \   desired participants.  In order to establish the ad-hoc PoC group\n   session,\
    \ the originator sends an INVITE request with a URI list that\n   contains the\
    \ URIs of those participants.\n   The PoC network, following the procedures defined\
    \ in [6], receives\n   such an INVITE request and generates an individual INVITE\
    \ request\n   towards each of the URIs in the URI list.\n   In previous versions\
    \ of the OMA PoC service, the originator of an\n   ad-hoc PoC group session was\
    \ only allowed to populate the initial URI\n   list with URIs identifying individual\
    \ PoC users.  Later versions of\n   the service allow the originator to also include\
    \ URI lists whose\n   entries represent URI lists.  That is, the initial URI list\
    \ contains\n   entries that are URI lists themselves.  The expected service behavior\n\
    \   then is that the members of the embedded URI lists are invited to\n   join\
    \ the ad-hoc PoC group session.\n   Figure 1 illustrates the desired behavior.\
    \  The originator (not\n   shown) places the URI list friends@example.org, along\
    \ with the URI\n   alice@example.com, in the initial URI list.  The PoC network\
    \ resolves\n   friends@example.org into its members, bob@example.org and\n   carol@example.net,\
    \ and sends INVITE requests to all the recipients.\n                         \

    \                      Figure 1: PoC Expected Behavior\n   The PoC network in\
    \ Figure 1 consists of PoC servers, which are SIP\n   entities that can behave\
    \ as proxies or B2BUAs (Back-to-Back User\n   Agents).  There are two types of\
    \ logical PoC servers: controlling and\n   participating.\n   In an ad-hoc PoC\
    \ group session, there is always exactly one\n   controlling PoC server.  The\
    \ controlling PoC server of an ad-hoc PoC\n   group session resolves an incoming\
    \ URI list and sends INVITEs to the\n   members of the list.  The controlling\
    \ PoC server also functions as\n   the focus of the session.  Every participant\
    \ in an ad-hoc PoC group\n   has an associated participating PoC server, which\
    \ resides in the home\n   domain of the participant.\n   Figure 2 shows how the\
    \ PoC servers of the PoC network behave in the\n   scenario shown in Figure 1.\
    \  An originating PoC user agent sends an\n   INVITE request (1) with a URI list\
    \ to its participating PoC server.\n   The participating PoC server of the originator\
    \ receives the INVITE\n   request, assumes the role of controlling PoC server\
    \ for the ad-hoc\n   PoC group session, and sends an INVITE request to each of\
    \ the URIs in\n   the URI list.\n                                            \

    \   Figure 2: PoC Network Behavior\n   The first URI of the list, alice@example.com,\
    \ identifies a single\n   user.  The second URI of the URI list, friends@example.org,\n\
    \   identifies a URI list.  In PoC terminology, friends@example.com\n   identifies\
    \ a pre-arranged PoC group.  The PoC server at example.org,\n   which knows the\
    \ membership of friends@example.com, cannot send INVITE\n   requests to the members\
    \ of friends@example.org because that PoC\n   server does not act as a controlling\
    \ PoC server for the ad-hoc PoC\n   group session being established.  Instead,\
    \ it informs the controlling\n   PoC server that friends@example.org is a list\
    \ whose members are\n   bob@example.org and carol@example.net.  Upon receiving\
    \ this\n   information, the controlling PoC server generates INVITE requests\n\
    \   towards bob@example.org and carol@example.net.\n   Although not shown in the\
    \ above example, the participating PoC server\n   (example.org) can include --\
    \ based on policy, presence of the\n   members, etc. -- just a partial list of\
    \ URIs of the URI list.\n   Furthermore, a URI that the participating PoC server\
    \ returns can be a\n   URI list.\n   At present, there is not a mechanism for\
    \ a participating PoC server\n   to inform a controlling PoC server that a URI\
    \ identifies a list and\n   the members of that list, nor is there a mechanism\
    \ to indicate the\n   URIs contained in the list.  This document defines such\
    \ a mechanism:\n   the P-Refused-URI-List P-Header.\n"

    \ Content-ID.  The format of a URI list is service specific.\n   This kind of\

    \ URI list, if the URI-list server is willing to\n   disclose that information.\
    \  Furthermore, the information enclosed in\n   the URI lists enable clients to\

  contents:
  - "8.  Applicability\n   The P-Refused-URI-List header field is intended to be used\
    \ in OMA PoC\n   networks.  This header field is used between PoC servers and\
    \ carries\n   information about those URI lists that were rejected by the server\n\
    \   receiving the request.\n   The OMA PoC services is designed so that, in a\
    \ given session, only\n   one PoC server can resolve incoming URI lists and send\
    \ INVITEs to\n   members of these lists.  This restriction is not present on services\n\
    \   developed to be used on the public Internet.  Therefore, the\n   P-Refused-URI-List\
    \ P-Header does not seem to have general\n   applicability outside the OMA PoC\
    \ service.\n   Additionally, the use of the P-Refused-URI-List P-Header requires\n\
    \   special trust relationships between servers that do not typically\n   exist\
    \ on the public Internet.\n   It is important to note that the P-Refused-URI-List\
    \ is optional and\n   does not change the basic behavior of a SIP URI-list service.\
    \  The\n   P-Refused-URI-List only provides clients with additional information\n\
    \   about the refusal of the request.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   It is assumed that the network elements handling\
    \ the P-Refused-URI-\n   List P-Header are trusted.  Also, attackers are not supposed\
    \ to have\n   access to the protocol messages between those elements.  This is\n\
    \   because the P-Refused-URI-List is intended to be used in the OMA PoC\n   environment,\
    \ which is implemented in the operators' core network; for\n   more on OMA PoC\
    \ security assumptions, see [9].  Traffic protection\n   between network elements\
    \ is achieved by using IP Security (IPsec) and\n   sometimes by physically protecting\
    \ the network.\n   However, implementors and administrators should be aware of\
    \ two\n   special security considerations related to the use of P-Refused-URI-\n\
    \   List:\n   Eavesdropping:  403 (Forbidden) responses may contain information\n\
    \      about the members of a given URI list.  Eavesdroppers can acquire\n   \
    \   this information if the 403 (Forbidden) responses are not\n      encrypted.\
    \  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that either hop-by-hop or\n      end-to-end encryption\
    \ (e.g., using TLS or S/MIME, respectively) is\n      used.\n   Disclosing information:\
    \  A rogue entity may be able to acquire\n      information about the members\
    \ of a given URI list if the URI-list\n      server sends information about those\
    \ URI lists to unauthorized\n      users.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a\
    \ URI-list server\n      discloses the content of that URI-list only to authorized\
    \ clients.\n"
