  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP\n   is one of the\
    \ recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately,\n   various refereed research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published\n   during this decade.  So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much\n   broader review than the IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this\n   document were considered controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the\n   RG reached a consensus that the document still should be\n \
    \  published.  The Routing RG has had remarkably little consensus on\n   anything,\
    \ so virtually all Routing RG outputs are considered\n   controversial.\n   At\
    \ present, the Internet research and development community are\n   exploring various\
    \ approaches to evolving the Internet\n   Architecture to solve a variety of issues\
    \ including, but not\n   limited to, scalability of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].\
    \  A wide\n   range of other issues (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming,\n\
    \   site/subnet mobility, node mobility) are also active concerns at\n   present.\
    \  Several different classes of evolution are being\n   considered by the Internet\
    \ research and development community.  One\n   class is often called \"Map and\
    \ Encapsulate\", where traffic would\n   be mapped and then tunnelled through\
    \ the inter-domain core of the\n   Internet.  Another class being considered is\
    \ sometimes known as\n   \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This document relates\
    \ to a proposal\n   that is in the latter class of evolutionary approaches.\n\
    \   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is a proposal for\n   evolving\
    \ the Internet Architecture.  It differs from the current\n   Internet Architecture\
    \ primarily by deprecating the concept of an\n   IP Address, and instead defining\
    \ two new objects, each having\n   crisp syntax and semantics.  The first new\
    \ object is the Locator, a\n   topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The\
    \ other new object is\n   the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent\
    \ name for a\n   node.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  ILNP Document Roadmap\n   This document describes extensions to ARP for\
    \ use with\n   ILNPv4.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than one engineering\n\
    \   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\n   engineering\
    \ design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents, we describe\
    \ two specific engineering instances of\n   ILNP.  The term ILNPv6 refers precisely\
    \ to an instance of ILNP that\n   is based upon, and backwards compatible with,\
    \ IPv6.  The term ILNPv4\n   refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is based\
    \ upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many engineering aspects\
    \ common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].  A full engineering\
    \ specification for\n   either ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents for details\n   not described\
    \ here:\n      a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural description of ILNP,\n \
    \        including the concept of operations.\n      b) [RFC6741] describes engineering\
    \ and implementation\n         considerations that are common to both ILNPv4 and\
    \ ILNPv6.\n      c) [RFC6742] defines additional DNS resource records that\n \
    \        support ILNP.\n      d) [RFC6743] defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update\
    \ message\n         used by an ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes\n \
    \        of any changes to its set of valid Locators.\n      e) [RFC6744] defines\
    \ a new IPv6 Nonce Destination Option\n         used by ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate\
    \ to ILNP correspondent\n         nodes (by inclusion within the initial packets\
    \ of an ILNP\n         session) that the node is operating in the ILNP mode and\n\
    \         (2) to prevent off-path attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.\n      \
    \   This Nonce is used, for example, with all ILNP ICMPv6\n         Locator Update\
    \ messages that are exchanged among ILNP\n         correspondent nodes.\n    \
    \  f) [RFC6745] defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message\n         used by\
    \ an ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes\n         of any changes to its\
    \ set of valid Locators.\n      g) [RFC6746] defines a new IPv4 Nonce Option used\
    \ by ILNPv4\n         nodes to carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks\n\
    \         against ILNP ICMP messages and also defines a new IPv4\n         Identifier\
    \ Option used by ILNPv4 nodes.\n      h) [RFC6748] describes optional engineering\
    \ and deployment\n         functions for ILNP.  These are not required for the\
    \ operation\n         or use of ILNP and are provided as additional options.\n"

- title: 2.  ARP Extensions for ILNPv4
  contents:
  - "2.  ARP Extensions for ILNPv4\n   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4) is merely a different\
    \ instantiation of the\n   ILNP architecture, so it retains the crisp distinction\
    \ between the\n   Locator and the Identifier.  As with ILNPv6, only the Locator\n\
    \   values are used for routing and forwarding ILNPv4 packets\n   [RFC6740]. \
    \ As with ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6), when ILNPv4 is used\n   for a network-layer\
    \ session, the upper-layer protocols (e.g.,\n   TCP/UDP pseudo-header checksum,\
    \ IPsec Security Association) bind\n   only to the Identifiers, never to the Locators\
    \ [RFC6741].\n   However, just as the packet format for IPv4 is different to IPv6,\n\
    \   so the engineering details for ILNPv4 are different also.  While\n   ILNPv6\
    \ is carefully engineered to be fully backwards-compatible\n   with IPv6 Neighbor\
    \ Discovery, ILNPv4 relies upon an extended\n   version of the Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP) [RFC826], which\n   is defined here.  While ILNPv4 could have\
    \ been engineered to avoid\n   changes in ARP, that would have required that the\
    \ ILNPv4 Locator\n   (i.e., L32) have slightly different semantics, which was\n\
    \   architecturally undesirable.\n   The packet formats used are direct extensions\
    \ of the existing\n   widely deployed ARP Request (OP code 1) and ARP Reply (OP\
    \ code 2)\n   packet formats.  This design was chosen for practical engineering\n\
    \   reasons (i.e., to maximise code reuse), rather than for maximum\n   protocol\
    \ design purity.\n   We anticipate that ILNPv6 is much more likely to be widely\n\
    \   implemented and deployed than ILNPv4.  However, having a clear\n   definition\
    \ of ILNPv4 helps demonstrate the difference between\n   architecture and engineering,\
    \ and also demonstrates that the\n   common ILNP architecture can be instantiated\
    \ in different ways\n   with different existing network-layer protocols.\n"

    \ for ILNPv4 is almost identical to that for IPv4.\n   Essentially, the key differences\
    \ are:\n      a) where an IPv4 ARP Request would use IPv4 addresses, an ILNPv4\n\
    \         ARP Request MUST use:\n         1. a 32-bit L32 value (_L32 suffixes\
    \ in Figures 2.1 and 2.2)\n         2. a 64-bit NID value (_NID suffixes in Figures\

    \  versions of the corresponding ARP packets.  It should be possible to\n   implement\
    \ this extension of ARP by extending existing ARP\n   implementations rather than\
    \ having to write an entirely new\n   implementation for ILNPv4.  It should be\
    \ emphasised, however, that OP\n   codes 24 and 25 are for experimental use as\
    \ defined in [RFC5494], and\n   so it is possible that other experimental protocols\
    \ could be using\n   these OP codes concurrently.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the overall ILNP\
    \ architecture are\n   described in [RFC6740].  Additional common security considerations\n\
    \   applicable to ILNP are described in [RFC6741].  This section\n   describes\
    \ security considerations specific to the specific ILNPv4\n   topics discussed\
    \ in this document.\n   The existing widely deployed Address Resolution Protocol\
    \ (ARP) for\n   IPv4 is a link-layer protocol, so it is not vulnerable to off-link\n\
    \   attackers.  In this way, it is a bit different than IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery\
    \ (ND); IPv6 ND is a subset of the Internet Control Message\n   Protocol (ICMP),\
    \ which runs over IPv6.\n   However, ARP does not include any form of authentication,\
    \ so current\n   ARP deployments are vulnerable to a range of attacks from on-link\n\
    \   nodes.  For example, it is possible for one node on a link to forge\n   an\
    \ ARP packet claiming to be from another node, thereby \"stealing\"\n   the other\
    \ node's IPv4 address.  [RFC5227] describes several of these\n   risks and some\
    \ measures that an ARP implementation can use to reduce\n   the chance of accidental\
    \ IPv4 address misconfiguration and also to\n   detect such misconfiguration if\
    \ it should occur.\n   This extension does not change the security risks that\
    \ are inherent\n   in using ARP.\n   In situations where additional protection\
    \ against on-link attackers\n   is needed (for example, within high-risk operational\
    \ environments),\n   the IEEE standards for link-layer security [IEEE-802.1-AE]\
    \ SHOULD be\n   implemented and deployed.\n   Implementers of this specification\
    \ need to understand that the two OP\n   code values used for these 2 extensions\
    \ are not uniquely assigned to\n   ILNPv4.  Other experimenters might be using\
    \ the same two OP code\n   values at the same time for different ARP-related experiments.\n\
    \   Absent prior coordination among all users of a particular IP\n   subnetwork,\
    \ different experiments might be occurring on the same IP\n   subnetwork.  So,\
    \ implementations of these two ARP extensions ought to\n   be especially defensively\
    \ coded.\n"
