- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Growth in the Internet has made us aware of the need for\
    \ improved\n   authentication of routing information.  RIP-2 provides for\n  \
    \ unauthenticated service (as in classical RIP), or password\n   authentication.\
    \  Both are vulnerable to passive attacks currently\n   widespread in the Internet.\
    \  Well-understood security issues exist in\n   routing protocols [4].  Clear\
    \ text passwords, currently specified for\n   use with RIP-2, are no longer considered\
    \ sufficient [5].\n   If authentication is disabled, then only simple misconfigurations\
    \ are\n   detected.  Simple passwords transmitted in the clear will further\n\
    \   protect against the honest neighbor, but are useless in the general\n   case.\
    \  By simply capturing information on the wire - straightforward\n   even in a\
    \ remote environment - a hostile process can learn the\n   password and overcome\
    \ the network.\n   We propose that RIP-2 use an authentication algorithm, as was\n\
    \   originally proposed for SNMP Version 2, augmented by a sequence\n   number.\
    \  Keyed MD5 is proposed as the standard authentication\n   algorithm for RIP-2,\
    \ but the mechanism is intended to be algorithm-\n   independent.  While this\
    \ mechanism is not unbreakable (no known\n   mechanism is), it provides a greatly\
    \ enhanced probability that a\n   system being attacked will detect and ignore\
    \ hostile messages.  This\n   is because we transmit the output of an authentication\
    \ algorithm\n   (e.g., Keyed MD5) rather than the secret RIP-2 Authentication\
    \ Key.\n   This output is a one-way function of a message and a secret RIP-2\n\
    \   Authentication Key.  This RIP-2 Authentication Key is never sent over\n  \
    \ the network in the clear, thus providing protection against the\n   passive\
    \ attacks now commonplace in the Internet.\n   In this way, protection is afforded\
    \ against forgery or message\n   modification.  It is possible to replay a message\
    \ until the sequence\n   number changes, but the sequence number makes replay\
    \ in the long term\n   less of an issue.  The mechanism does not afford confidentiality,\n\
    \   since messages stay in the clear; however, the mechanism is also\n   exportable\
    \ from most countries, which test a privacy algorithm would\n   fail.\n   Other\
    \ relevant rationales for the approach are that Keyed MD5 is\n   being used for\
    \ OSPF cryptographic authentication, and is therefore\n   present in routers already,\
    \ as is some form of password management.\n   A similar approach has been standardized\
    \ for use in IP-layer\n   authentication. [7]\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation Approach
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation Approach\n   Implementation requires three issues to be addressed:\n\
    \   (1)  A changed packet format,\n   (2)  Authentication procedures, and\n  \
    \ (3)  Management controls.\n"
- title: 3.1.  RIP-2 PDU Format
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RIP-2 PDU Format\n   The basic RIP-2 message format provides for an 8 byte\
    \ header with an\n   array of 20 byte records as its data content.  When Keyed\
    \ MD5 is\n   used, the same header and content are used, except that the 16 byte\n\
    \   \"authentication key\" field is reused to describe a \"Keyed Message\n   Digest\"\
    \ trailer.  This consists in five fields:\n   (1)  The \"Authentication Type\"\
    \ is Keyed Message Digest Algorithm,\n        indicated by the value 3 (1 and\
    \ 2 indicate \"IP Route\" and\n        \"Password\", respectively).\n   (2)  A\
    \ 16 bit offset from the RIP-2 header to the MD5 digest (if no\n        other\
    \ trailer fields are ever defined, this value equals the\n        RIP-2 Data Length).\n\
    \   (3)  An unsigned 8-bit field that contains the Key Identifier\n        or\
    \ Key-ID. This identifies the key used to create the\n        Authentication Data\
    \ for this RIP-2 message.  In\n        implementations supporting more than one\
    \ authentication\n        algorithm, the Key-ID also indicates the authentication\n\
    \        algorithm in use for this message. A key is associated with\n       \
    \ an interface.\n   (4)  An unsigned 8-bit field that contains the length in octets\
    \ of the\n        trailing Authentication Data field.  The presence of this field\n\
    \        permits other algorithms (e.g., Keyed SHA) to be substituted for\n  \
    \      Keyed MD5 if desired.\n   (5)  An unsigned 32 bit sequence number.  The\
    \ sequence number MUST be\n        non-decreasing for all messages sent with the\
    \ same Key ID.\n   The trailer consists of the Authentication Data, which is the\
    \ output\n   of the Keyed Message Digest Algorithm.  When the Authentication\n\
    \   Algorithm is Keyed MD5, the output data is 16 bytes; during digest\n   calculation,\
    \ this is effectively followed by a pad field and a length\n   field as defined\
    \ by RFC 1321.\n"

  - "3.2.1.  Message Generation\n   The RIP-2 Packet is created as usual, with these\
    \ exceptions:\n   (1) The UDP checksum need not be calculated, but MAY be set\
    \ to\n       zero.\n   (2) The authentication type field indicates the Keyed Message\
    \ Digest\n       Algorithm (3).\n   (3) The authentication \"password\" field\
    \ is reused to store a packet\n       offset to the Authentication Data, a Key\
    \ Identifier, the\n       Authentication Data Length, and a non-decreasing sequence\
    \ number.\n   The value used in the sequence number is arbitrary, but two\n  \
    \ suggestions are the time of the message's creation or a simple\n   message counter.\n\
    \   The RIP-2 Authentication Key is selected by the sender based on the\n   outgoing\
    \ interface. Each key has a lifetime associated with it.  No\n   key is ever used\
    \ outside its lifetime.  Since the key's algorithm is\n   related to the key itself,\
    \ stored in the sender and receiver along\n   with it, the Key ID effectively\
    \ indicates which authentication\n   algorithm is in use if the implementation\
    \ supports more than one\n   authentication algorithm.\n   (1)  The RIP-2 header's\
    \ packet length field indicates the standard\n        RIP-2 portion of the packet.\n\
    \   (2)  The Authentication Data Offset, Key Identifier, and\n        Authentication\
    \ Data size fields are filled in appropriately.\n   (3)  The RIP-2 Authentication\
    \ Key, which is 16 bytes long when the\n        Keyed MD5 algorithm is used, is\
    \ now appended to the data.  For\n        all algorithms, the RIP-2 Authentication\
    \ Key is never longer than\n        the output of the algorithm in use.\n   (4)\
    \  Trailing pad and length fields are added and the digest\n        calculated\
    \ using the indicated algorithm. When Keyed MD5 is the\n        algorithm in use,\
    \ these are calculated per RFC 1321.\n   (5)  The digest is written over the RIP-2\
    \ Authentication Key.  When\n        MD5 is used, this digest will be 16 bytes\
    \ long.\n   The trailing pad is not actually transmitted, as it is entirely\n\
    \   predictable from the message length and algorithm in use.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Message Reception
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Message Reception\n   When the message is received, the process is reversed:\n\
    \   (1)  The digest is set aside,\n   (2)  The appropriate algorithm and key are\
    \ determined from the value\n        of the Key Identifier field,\n   (3)  The\
    \ RIP-2 Authentication Key is written into the appropriate\n        number (16\
    \ when Keyed MD5 is used) of bytes starting at the\n        offset indicated,\n\
    \   (4)  Appropriate padding is added as needed, and\n   (5)  A new digest calculated\
    \ using the indicated algorithm.\n   If the calculated digest does not match the\
    \ received digest, the\n   message is discarded unprocessed.  If the neighbor\
    \ has been heard\n   from recently enough to have viable routes in the route table\
    \ and the\n   received sequence number is less than the last one received, the\n\
    \   message likewise is discarded unprocessed.  When connectivity to the\n   neighbor\
    \ has been lost, the receiver SHOULD be ready to accept\n   either:\n   - a message\
    \ with a sequence number of zero\n   - a message with a higher sequence number\
    \ than the last received\n     sequence number.\n   A router that has forgotten\
    \ its current sequence number but remembers\n   its key and Key-ID MUST send its\
    \ first packet with a sequence number\n   of zero.  This leaves a small opening\
    \ for a replay attack.  Router\n   vendors are encouraged to provide stable storage\
    \ for keys, key\n   lifetimes, Key-IDs, and the related sequence numbers.\n  \
    \ Acceptable messages are now truncated to RIP-2 message itself and\n   treated\
    \ normally.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Key Management Requirements\n   It is strongly desirable that a hypothetical\
    \ security breach in one\n   Internet protocol not automatically compromise other\
    \ Internet\n   protocols.  The Authentication Key of this specification SHOULD\
    \ NOT\n   be stored using protocols or algorithms that have known flaws.\n   Implementations\
    \ MUST support the storage of more than one key at the\n   same time, although\
    \ it is recognized that only one key will normally\n   be active on an interface.\
    \ They MUST associate a specific lifetime\n   (i.e., date/time first valid and\
    \ date/time no longer valid) and a key\n   identifier with each key, and MUST\
    \ support manual key distribution\n   (e.g., the privileged user manually typing\
    \ in the key, key lifetime,\n   and key identifier on the router console).  The\
    \ lifetime may be\n   infinite.  If more than one algorithm is supported, then\
    \ the\n   implementation MUST require that the algorithm be specified for each\n\
    \   key at the time the other key information is entered. Keys that are\n   out\
    \ of date MAY be deleted at will by the implementation without\n   requiring human\
    \ intervention.  Manual deletion of active keys SHOULD\n   also be supported.\n\
    \   It is likely that the IETF will define a standard key management\n   protocol.\
    \  It is strongly desirable to use that key management\n   protocol to distribute\
    \ RIP-2 Authentication Keys among communicating\n   RIP-2 implementations.  Such\
    \ a protocol would provide scalability and\n   significantly reduce the human\
    \ administrative burden. The Key ID can\n   be used as a hook between RIP-2 and\
    \ such a future protocol.  Key\n   management protocols have a long history of\
    \ subtle flaws that are\n   often discovered long after the protocol was first\
    \ described in\n   public.  To avoid having to change all RIP-2 implementations\
    \ should\n   such a flaw be discovered, integrated key management protocol\n \
    \  techniques were deliberately omitted from this specification.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Key Management Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Key Management Procedures\n   As with all security methods using keys,\
    \ it is necessary to change\n   the RIP-2 Authentication Key on a regular basis.\
    \  To maintain routing\n   stability during such changes, implementations MUST\
    \ be able to store\n   and use more than one RIP-2 Authentication Key on a given\
    \ interface\n   at the same time.\n   Each key will have its own Key Identifier,\
    \ which is stored locally.\n   The combination of the Key Identifier and the interface\
    \ associated\n   with the message uniquely identifies the Authentication Algorithm\
    \ and\n   RIP-2 Authentication Key in use.\n   As noted above in Section 2.2.1,\
    \ the party creating the RIP-2 message\n   will select a valid key from the set\
    \ of valid keys for that\n   interface.  The receiver will use the Key Identifier\
    \ and interface to\n   determine which key to use for authentication of the received\n\
    \   message.  More than one key may be associated with an interface at\n   the\
    \ same time.\n   Hence it is possible to have fairly smooth RIP-2 Authentication\
    \ Key\n   rollovers without losing legitimate RIP-2 messages because the stored\n\
    \   key is incorrect and without requiring people to change all the keys\n   at\
    \ once.  To ensure a smooth rollover, each communicating RIP-2\n   system must\
    \ be updated with the new key several minutes before the\n   current key will\
    \ expire and several minutes before the new key\n   lifetime begins. The new key\
    \ should have a lifetime that starts\n   several minutes before the old key expires.\
    \ This gives time for each\n   system to learn of the new RIP-2 Authentication\
    \ Key before that key\n   will be used.  It also ensures that the new key will\
    \ begin being used\n   and the current key will go out of use before the current\
    \ key's\n   lifetime expires.  For the duration of the overlap in key lifetimes,\n\
    \   a system may receive messages using either key and authenticate the\n   message.\
    \ The Key-ID in the received message is used to select the\n   appropriate key\
    \ for authentication.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Pathological Cases
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Pathological Cases\n   Two pathological cases exist which must be handled,\
    \ which are\n   failures of the network manager.  Both of these should be exceedingly\n\
    \   rare.\n   During key switchover, devices may exist which have not yet been\n\
    \   successfully configured with the new key. Therefore, routers SHOULD\n   implement\
    \ (and would be well advised to implement) an algorithm that\n   detects the set\
    \ of keys being used by its neighbors, and transmits\n   its messages using both\
    \ the new and old keys until all of the\n   neighbors are using the new key or\
    \ the lifetime of the old key\n   expires.  Under normal circumstances, this elevated\
    \ transmission rate\n   will exist for a single update interval.\n   In the event\
    \ that the last key associated with an interface expires,\n   it is unacceptable\
    \ to revert to an unauthenticated condition, and not\n   advisable to disrupt\
    \ routing.  Therefore, the router should send a\n   \"last authentication key\
    \ expiration\" notification to the network\n   manager and treat the key as having\
    \ an infinite lifetime until the\n   lifetime is extended, the key is deleted\
    \ by network management, or a\n   new key is configured.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This entire memo describes and specifies an authentication\
    \ mechanism\n   for the RIP-2 routing protocol that is believed to be secure against\n\
    \   active and passive attacks. Passive attacks are clearly widespread in\n  \
    \ the Internet at present.  Protection against active attacks is also\n   needed\
    \ because active attacks are becoming more common.\n   Users need to understand\
    \ that the quality of the security provided by\n   this mechanism depends completely\
    \ on the strength of the implemented\n   authentication algorithms, the strength\
    \ of the key being used, and\n   the correct implementation of the security mechanism\
    \ in all\n   communicating RIP-2 implementations. This mechanism also depends\
    \ on\n   the RIP-2 Authentication Key being kept confidential by all parties.\n\
    \   If any of these incorrect or insufficiently secure, then no real\n   security\
    \ will be provided to the users of this mechanism.\n   Specifically with respect\
    \ to the use of SNMP, compromise of SNMP\n   security has the necessary result\
    \ that the various RIP-2\n   configuration parameters (e.g. routing table, RIP-2\
    \ Authentication\n   Key) manageable via SNMP could be compromised as well.  Changing\n\
    \   Authentication Keys using non-encrypted SNMP is no more secure than\n   sending\
    \ passwords in the clear.\n   Confidentiality is not provided by this mechanism.\
    \  Recent work in\n   the IETF provides a standard mechanism for IP-layer encryption.\
    \ [8]\n   That mechanism might be used to provide confidentiality for RIP-2 in\n\
    \   the future.  Protection against traffic analysis is also not\n   provided.\
    \  Mechanisms such as bulk link encryption might be used when\n   protection against\
    \ traffic analysis is required.\n   The memo is written to address a security\
    \ consideration in RIP\n   Version 2 that was raised during the IAB's recent security\
    \ review\n   [6].\n"
