Standardizing Network Mail Headers One of the deficiences of the current FTP mail protocol is that it makes no provision for the explicit specification of such header information as author, title, and date.
Many systems send that information, but each in a different format.
One fairly serious result of this lack of standardization is that it's next to impossible for a system or user program to intelligently process incoming mail.
Although the long term solution to the problem is probably to add commands for specifying such information to the mail protocol command space (as suggested in RFC 524   17140,), we hereby propose a more quickly implemented solution for the interim.
We suggest that the text of network mail, whether transmitted over the FTP telnet connection (via the MAIL command) or over a separate data connection (with the MLFL command), be governed by the syntax below: Example: From: White at SRI ARC Date: 24 JUL 1973 1527
Multi Site Journal Meeting Announcement NIC: 17996
At 10 AM Wednesday 25 JULY there will be a meeting to discuss a Multi Site Journal in the context of the Utility.
::  space Please note the following: (1) <authoritem>, <dateitem>, and <subjectitem> may each appear at most once in <header>; <miscitem> may occur any number of times.
The order of <authoritem>, <dateitem>, and <subjectitem> is insignificant, but they must proceed all occurrences of <miscitem>.
The case (upper or lower) of keywords   specifically, 'FROM', 'DATE', 'SUBJECT' ,'AT', <host>, <zone>, <vmonth> and <keyword>   is insignificant.
Although 'FROM', for example, appears in upper case in the formal syntax above, in the header of an actual message it may appear as 'From' (as in the example), or 'from', or 'FrOm', etc.
No attempt has been made to legislate the format of <user>, except to exclude spaces from it.
The time has no internal punctuation.
No provision is made for multiple authors.
We recommend that mail sending subsystems which prefix header information to the text of the user's message be modified
