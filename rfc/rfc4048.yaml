- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC1888] was published as an Experimental RFC in 1996,\
    \ at an early\n   stage in the development of IPv6, when it appeared important\
    \ to\n   consider usage of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) addressing for\n\
    \   IPv6.  In Sections 3 through 5, it defines mappings of certain OSI\n   Network\
    \ Service Access Point (NSAP) addresses inside IPv6 addresses,\n   and how to\
    \ carry arbitrary NSAP addresses as IPv6 destination\n   options.  However, it\
    \ also contains significant \"health warnings\"\n   about the difficulty of routing\
    \ packets in the global Internet using\n   such addresses.  As far as is known\
    \ to the IETF, these address\n   mappings have never been seriously used and are\
    \ not supported by IPv6\n   implementations.  Furthermore, the deployment of OSI\
    \ solutions is not\n   sufficiently widespread that any change in this situation\
    \ can be\n   expected.\n   Additionally, Section 6 of [RFC1888] specifies a mapping\
    \ of IPv6\n   addresses inside OSI NSAP addresses.  This mapping has recently\n\
    \   aroused some interest: for example, to allow IP addresses to be\n   expressed\
    \ in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) context.\n   Unfortunately, Section 6\
    \ of [RFC1888] contains two errors in its\n   usage of OSI Initial Domain Part\
    \ (IDP) format:\n   * first, the text refers to the Internet Code Point (ICP)\
    \ as a single\n     octet, whereas it is correctly a 16-bit field;\n   * second,\
    \ the text states that \"[t]he first three octets are an IDP\n     in binary format\"\
    , but [NSAP] states in section A.5.2.1 that \"[t]he\n     abstract syntax for\
    \ the IDI is decimal digits\" and specifies a\n     preferred binary encoding\
    \ in section A.5.3 \"using a semi-octet to\n     represent the value of each decimal\
    \ digit ... , yielding a value in\n     the range 0000-1001\".\n"
- title: 2.  Recommendation to Reclassify RFC 1888
  contents:
  - "2.  Recommendation to Reclassify RFC 1888\n   Due to the lack of use of one of\
    \ the mappings, and to the errors in\n   the documentation of the other, this\
    \ document recommends that the\n   IESG reclassify [RFC1888] as Historic.\n  \
    \ It is assumed that parties who wish to use a mapping of IPv6\n   addresses inside\
    \ OSI NSAP addresses will correct, augment, and\n   resubmit Section 6 of [RFC1888]\
    \ as a separate document.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This recommendation has no known impact on the\
    \ security of the\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has marked the IPv6 address prefix 0000 001,\
    \ reserved for NSAP\n   Allocation in [RFC3513], simply as Reserved.\n   IANA\
    \ is holding the registry for \"OSI NSAPA Internet Code Point\"\n   implied by\
    \ Section 6 of [RFC1888] in abeyance until a replacement for\n   that Section\
    \ is approved for publication.\n"
