    \ used in enterprise networks for the\n   purposes of traffic segregation.  This\
    \ document describes how such\n   VLANs can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking\
    \ in an enterprise,\n   including the scenario of early deployment prior to availability\
    \ of\n   IPv6-capable switch-router equipment, where IPv6 may be routed in\n \
    \  parallel with the existing IPv4 in the enterprise and delivered to\n   the\
    \ desired LANs via VLAN technology.\n   It is expected that in the long run, sites\
    \ migrating to dual-stack\n   networking will either upgrade existing switch-router\
    \ equipment to\n   support IPv6 or procure new equipment that supports IPv6. \
    \ If a site\n   already has production routers deployed that support IPv6, the\n\
    \   procedures described in this document are not required.  In the\n   interim,\
    \ however, a method is required for early IPv6 adopters that\n   enables IPv6\
    \ to be deployed in a structured, managed way to some or\n   all of an enterprise\
    \ network that currently lacks IPv6 support in its\n   core infrastructure.\n\
    \   The IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard allows separate LANs to be deployed\n   over\
    \ a single bridged LAN, by inserting \"Virtual LAN\" tagging or\n   membership\
    \ information into Ethernet frames.  Hosts and switches that\n   support VLANs\
    \ effectively allow software-based reconfiguration of\n   LANs through configuration\
    \ of the tagging parameters.  The software\n   control means that VLANs can be\
    \ used to alter the LAN infrastructure\n   without having to physically alter\
    \ the wiring between the LAN\n   segments and Layer 3 routers.\n   Many IPv4 enterprise\
    \ networks are utilising VLAN technology.  Where a\n   site does not have IPv6-capable\
    \ Layer 2/3 switch-router equipment,\n   but VLANs are supported, a simple yet\
    \ effective method exists to\n   gradually introduce IPv6 to some or all of that\
    \ site's network, in\n   advance of the site's core infrastructure having dual-stack\n\
    \   capability.\n   If such a site wishes to introduce IPv6, it may do so by deploying\
    \ a\n   parallel IPv6 routing infrastructure (which is likely to be a\n   different\
    \ platform to the site's main infrastructure equipment, i.e.,\n   one that supports\
    \ IPv6 where the existing equipment does not), and\n   then using VLAN technology\
    \ to \"overlay\" IPv6 links onto existing IPv4\n   links.  This can be achieved\
    \ without needing any changes to the IPv4\n   configuration.  The VLANs don't\
    \ need to differentiate between IPv4\n   and IPv6; the deployment is just dual-stack,\
    \ as Ethernet is without\n   VLANs.\n   The IPv4 default route to the VLAN is\
    \ provided by one (IPv4) router,\n   while the IPv6 default route to the VLAN\
    \ is provided by a different\n   (IPv6) router.  The IPv6 router can provide native\
    \ IPv6 connectivity\n   to the whole site with just a single physical interface,\
    \ thanks to\n   VLAN tagging and trunking, as described below.\n   The IPv6 connectivity\
    \ to the enterprise may or may not enter the site\n   via the same physical link\
    \ as the IPv4 traffic, and may be native or\n   tunneled from the external provider\
    \ to the IPv6 routing equipment.\n   This VLAN usage is a solution adopted by\
    \ a number of sites already,\n   including that of the author.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that a parallel infrastructure will require\n   additional infrastructure\
    \ and thus cost, and will often require a\n   separate link into the site (from\
    \ an IPv6 provider), quite possibly\n   tunneled, that will require the site's\
    \ security policy to be applied\n   (e.g., firewalling and intrusion detection).\
    \  For sites that believe\n   early adoption of IPv6 is important, that price\
    \ is one they may be\n   quite willing to pay.  However, this document focuses\
    \ on the\n   technical issues of VLAN usage in such a scenario.\n2.  Enabling\
    \ IPv6 per Link\n   The precise method by which IPv6 would be \"injected\" into\
    \ the\n   existing IPv4 network is deployment specific.  For example, perhaps\
    \ a\n   site has an IPv4-only router, connected to an Ethernet switch that\n \
    \  supports VLANs and a number of hosts connected to that VLAN.  Let's\n   further\
    \ assume that the site has a dozen of these setups that it\n   wishes to IPv6-enable\
    \ immediately.  This could be done by upgrading\n   the twelve routers to support\
    \ IPv6, and turning IPv6 on those\n   routers.  However, this may not be practical\
    \ for various reasons.\n   The simplest approach would be to connect an IPv6 router\
    \ with one\n   interface to an Ethernet switch, and connect that switch to other\n\
    \   switches, and then use VLAN tags between the switches and the IPv6\n   router\
    \ to \"reach\" all the IPv4-only subnets from the IPv6 router.\n   Thus, the general\
    \ principle is that the IPv6 router device (e.g.,\n   performing IPv6 Router Advertisements\
    \ [1] in the case of stateless\n   autoconfiguration) is connected to the target\
    \ link through the use of\n   VLAN-capable Layer 2 equipment.\n2.1.  IPv6 Routing\
    \ over VLANs\n   In a typical scenario where connectivity is to be offered to\
    \ a number\n   of existing IPv6 internal subnets, one IPv6 router could be deployed,\n\
    \   with both an external interface and one or more internal interfaces.\n   The\
    \ external interface connects to the wider IPv6 internet, and may\n   be dual-stack\
    \ if some tunnel mechanism is used for external\n   connectivity, or IPv6-only\
    \ if a native external connection is\n   available.\n   The internal interface(s)\
    \ can be connected directly to a VLAN-capable\n   switch.  It is then possible\
    \ to write VLAN tags on the packets sent\n   from the internal router interface\
    \ based on the target IPv6 link\n   prefix.  The VLAN-tagged traffic is then transported\
    \ across the\n   internal VLAN-capable site infrastructure to the target IPv6\
    \ links\n   (which may be dispersed widely across the site network).\n   Where\
    \ the IPv6 router is unable to VLAN-tag the packets, a protocol-\n   based VLAN\
    \ can be created on the VLAN-capable device connected to the\n   IPv6 router,\
    \ causing IPv6 traffic to be tagged and then redistributed\n   on (congruent)\
    \ IPv4 subnet links that lie in the same VLAN.\n2.2.  One VLAN per Router Interface\n\
    \   The VLAN marking may be done in different ways.  Some sites may\n   prefer\
    \ to use one router interface per VLAN; for example, if there\n   are three internal\
    \ IPv6 links, a standard PC-based IPv6 router with\n   four Ethernet ports could\
    \ be used, one for the external link and\n   three for the internal links.  In\
    \ such a case, one switch port would\n   be needed per link, to receive the connectivity\
    \ from each router\n   port.\n   In such a deployment, the IPv6 routing could\
    \ be cascaded through\n   lower-tier internal IPv6-only routers.  Here, the internal-facing\n\
    \   ports on the IPv6 edge router may feed other IPv6 routers over IPv6-\n   only\
    \ links, which in turn inject the IPv6 connectivity (the stub\n   links using\
    \ 64-bit subnet prefixes and associated Router\n   Advertisements) into the VLANs.\n\
    2.3.  Collapsed VLANs on a Single Interface\n   Using multiple IPv6 routers and\
    \ one port per IPv6 link (i.e., VLAN)\n   may be unnecessary.  Many devices now\
    \ support VLAN tagging based on\n   virtual interfaces such that multiple IPv6\
    \ VLANs could be assigned\n   (trunked) from one physical router interface port.\
    \  Thus, it is\n   possible to use just one router interface for \"aggregated\"\
    \ VLAN\n   trunking from a switch.  This is a far more interesting case for a\n\
    \   site planning the introduction of IPv6 to (part of) its site network.\n  \
    \ This approach is viable while the IPv6 traffic load is light.  As\n   traffic\
    \ volume grows, the single collapsed interface could be\n   extended to utilise\
    \ two or more physical ports, where the capacity of\n   the IPv6 router device\
    \ allows it.\n2.4.  Congruent IPv4 and IPv6 Subnets\n   Such a VLAN-based technique\
    \ can be used to deploy IPv6-only VLANs in\n   an enterprise network.  However,\
    \ most enterprises will be interested\n   in dual-stack IPv4-IPv6 networking.\n\
    \   In such a case, the IPv6 connectivity may be injected into the\n   existing\
    \ IPv4 VLANs, such that the IPv4 and IPv6 subnets are\n   congruent (i.e., they\
    \ coincide exactly when superimposed).  Such a\n   method may have desirable administrative\
    \ properties; for example, the\n   devices in each IPv4 subnet will be in the\
    \ same IPv6 subnets also.\n   This is the method used at the author's site.\n\
    \   Furthermore, IPv6-only devices may be gradually added into the subnet\n  \
    \ without any need to resize the IPv6 subnet (which may hold in effect\n   an\
    \ infinite number of hosts in a /64 in contrast to IPv4 where the\n   subnet size\
    \ is often relatively limited, or kept to a minimum\n   possibly due to address\
    \ space usage concerns).  The lack of\n   requirement to periodically resize an\
    \ IPv6 subnet is a useful\n   administrative advantage for IPv6.\n2.5.  IPv6 Addressing\n\
    \   One site using this VLAN technique has chosen to number its IPv6\n   links\
    \ with the format [Site IPv6 prefix]:[VLAN ID]::/64.  The VLAN\n   tag is 16 bits,\
    \ so this can work with a typical maximum 48-bit site\n   prefix.  Linking the\
    \ VLAN ID into a site's addressing scheme may not\n   fit topology and aggregation,\
    \ and thus is not necessarily a\n   recommended addressing plan, but some sites\
    \ may wish to consider its\n   usage.\n2.6.  Final IPv6 Deployment\n   The VLAN\
    \ technique for IPv6 deployment offers a more structured\n   alternative to opportunistic\
    \ per-host intra-site tunnelling methods\n   such as Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel\
    \ Addressing Protocol ISATAP [2].\n   It has the ability to offer a simple yet\
    \ efficient method for early\n   IPv6 deployment to an enterprise site.\n   When\
    \ the site acquires IPv6-capable switch-router equipment, the\n   VLAN-based method\
    \ can still be used for delivery of IPv6 links to\n   physical switch interfaces,\
    \ just as it is commonly used today for\n   IPv4 subnets, but with a common routing\
    \ infrastructure.\n3.  Example VLAN Topology\n   The following figure shows how\
    \ a VLAN topology may be used to\n   introduce IPv6 in an enterprise network,\
    \ using a parallel IPv6\n   routing infrastructure and VLAN tagging.\n       \

    \ 1: IPv6 deployment using VLANs (physical diagram)\n   In this scenario, the\
    \ IPv6 access router has one physical port facing\n   toward the internal infrastructure.\
    \  In this example, it need only be\n   IPv6-enabled, as its purpose is solely\
    \ to handle IPv6 traffic for the\n   enterprise.  The access router has an additional\
    \ interface facing\n   toward the external infrastructure, which in this example\
    \ could be\n   dual-stack if the external IPv6 connectivity is via a tunnel to\
    \ an\n   IPv6 ISP.\n   A number of VLANs are handled by the internal-facing IPv6\
    \ router\n   port; in this case, IPv6 links Subnet1, Subnet2, Subnet3.  The VLANs\n\
    \   are seen as logical subinterfaces of the physical interface on the\n   IPv6\
    \ access router, which is using the \"collapsed VLAN\" method\n   described above,\
    \ tagging the inbound traffic with one of three VLAN\n   IDs depending on the\
    \ target IPv6 Subnet prefix.\n   The following figure shows how the IPv6 view\
    \ of the deployment looks;\n   all IPv6 subnets are on-link to the IPv6 access\
    \ router, whether or\n   not they share the same physical links over the VLAN\
    \ infrastructure.\n                     External IPv6 Internet\n             \

    \   Subnet3\n           Figure 2: IPv6 view of the deployment (logical view)\n\
    \   In this example, the router acts as an IPv6 first-hop access router\n   to\
    \ the physical links, separately from the IPv4 first-hop router.\n   This technique\
    \ allows a site to easily \"inject\" native IPv6 into all\n   the links where\
    \ a VLAN-capable infrastructure is available, enabling\n   partial or full IPv6\
    \ deployment on the wire in a site.\n4.  Security Considerations\n   There are\
    \ no additional security considerations particular to this\n   method of enabling\
    \ IPv6 on a link.\n   Where the IPv6 connectivity is delivered into the enterprise\
    \ network\n   by a different path from the IPv4 connectivity, care should be given\n\
    \   that equivalent application of security policy (e.g., firewalling) is\n  \
    \ made to the IPv6 path.\n5.  Acknowledgements\n   The author would like to thank\

    \ a configuration example for using a computer\n   running the FreeBSD variant\
    \ of the Berkeley Software Distribution\n   (BSD) operating system as a router\
    \ to deploy IPv6 networking across a\n   number of IPv6 links on an enterprise\
    \ (in this case, six links), for\n   a scenario similar to the one described above.\
    \  Here, the precise\n   configuration may of course vary depending on the existing\
    \ site VLAN\n   deployment.  This section highlights that the VLAN configuration\
    \ must\n   be manually configured; the support is not \"automatic\".\n   In this\
    \ example, the configuration is for an IPv6 BSD router\n   connected directly\
    \ to a site's external IPv6 access router.  The BSD\n   router has one interface\
    \ (dc0) toward the site IPv6 access router,\n   and three interfaces (dc1, dc2,\
    \ dc3) over which the internal routing\n   is performed (the number of interfaces\
    \ can be varied; three are used\n   here to distribute the traffic load).  The\
    \ IPv6 documentation prefix\n   (2001:db8::/32) is used in the example.\n--- Example\
