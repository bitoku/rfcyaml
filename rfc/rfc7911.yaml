  - "1.  Introduction\n   The BGP specification [RFC4271] defines an Update-Send Process
    to\n   advertise the routes chosen by the Decision Process to other BGP\n   speakers.
    \ No provisions are made to allow the advertisement of\n   multiple paths for
    the same address prefix or Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI).
    \ In fact, a route with the same NLRI\n   as a previously advertised route implicitly
    replaces the previous\n   advertisement.\n   This document defines a BGP extension
    that allows the advertisement\n   of multiple paths for the same address prefix
    without the new paths\n   implicitly replacing any previous ones.  The essence
    of the extension\n   is that each path is identified by a Path Identifier in addition
    to\n   the address prefix.\n   The availability of the additional paths can help
    reduce or eliminate\n   persistent route oscillations [RFC3345].  It can also
    help with\n   optimal routing and routing convergence in a network by providing\n
    \  potential alternate or backup paths, respectively.\n"

      \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
      \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
      in [RFC2119].\n"
    title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  How to Identify a Path\n   As defined in [RFC4271], a path refers to the
    information reported in\n   the Path Attribute field of an UPDATE message.  As
    the procedures\n   specified in [RFC4271] allow only the advertisement of one
    path for a\n   particular address prefix, a path for an address prefix from a
    BGP\n   peer can be keyed on the address prefix.\n   In order for a BGP speaker
    to advertise multiple paths for the same\n   address prefix, a new identifier
    (termed \"Path Identifier\" hereafter)\n   needs to be introduced so that a particular
    path for an address\n   prefix can be identified by the combination of the address
    prefix and\n   the Path Identifier.\n   The assignment of the Path Identifier
    for a path by a BGP speaker is\n   purely a local matter.  However, the Path Identifier
    MUST be assigned\n   in such a way that the BGP speaker is able to use the (Prefix,
    Path\n   Identifier) to uniquely identify a path advertised to a neighbor.  A\n
    \  BGP speaker that re-advertises a route MUST generate its own Path\n   Identifier
    to be associated with the re-advertised route.  A BGP\n   speaker that receives
    a route should not assume that the identifier\n   carries any particular semantics.\n"
  title: 2.  How to Identify a Path

  - "3.  Extended NLRI Encodings\n   In order to carry the Path Identifier in an UPDATE
    message, the NLRI\n   encoding MUST be extended by prepending the Path Identifier
    field,\n   which is of four octets.\n   For example, the NLRI encoding specified
    in [RFC4271] is extended as\n   the following:\n                  +--------------------------------+\n
    \                 | Path Identifier (4 octets)     |\n                  +--------------------------------+\n
    \                 | Length (1 octet)               |\n                  +--------------------------------+\n
    \                 | Prefix (variable)              |\n                  +--------------------------------+\n
    \  The usage of the extended NLRI encodings is specified in Section 5.\n"
  title: 3.  Extended NLRI Encodings

  - "4.  ADD-PATH Capability\n   The ADD-PATH Capability is a BGP capability [RFC5492],
    with\n   Capability Code 69.  The Capability Length field of this capability\n
    \  is variable.  The Capability Value field consists of one or more of\n   the
    following tuples:\n                +------------------------------------------------+\n
    \               | Address Family Identifier (2 octets)           |\n                +------------------------------------------------+\n
    \               | Subsequent Address Family Identifier (1 octet) |\n                +------------------------------------------------+\n
    \               | Send/Receive (1 octet)                         |\n                +------------------------------------------------+\n
    \  The meaning and use of the fields are as follows:\n      Address Family Identifier
    (AFI):\n         This field is the same as the one used in [RFC4760].\n      Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier (SAFI):\n         This field is the same as the one
    used in [RFC4760].\n      Send/Receive:\n         This field indicates whether
    the sender is (a) able to receive\n         multiple paths from its peer (value
    1), (b) able to send\n         multiple paths to its peer (value 2), or (c) both
    (value 3) for\n         the <AFI, SAFI>.\n         If any other value is received,
    then the capability SHOULD be\n         treated as not understood and ignored
    [RFC5492].\n   A BGP speaker that wishes to indicate support for multiple AFI/SAFIs\n
    \  MUST do so by including the information in a single instance of the\n   ADD-PATH
    Capability.\n"
  title: 4.  ADD-PATH Capability
- contents:
  - "5.  Operation\n   The Path Identifier specified in Section 3 can be used to advertise\n
    \  multiple paths for the same address prefix without subsequent\n   advertisements
    replacing the previous ones.  Apart from the fact that\n   this is now possible,
    the route advertisement rules of [RFC4271] are\n   not changed.  In particular,
    a new advertisement for a given address\n   prefix and a given Path Identifier
    replaces a previous advertisement\n   for the same address prefix and Path Identifier.
    \ If a BGP speaker\n   receives a message to withdraw a prefix with a Path Identifier
    not\n   seen before, it SHOULD silently ignore it.\n   For a BGP speaker to be
    able to send multiple paths to its peer, that\n   BGP speaker MUST advertise the
    ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/\n   Receive field set to either 2 or 3, and
    MUST receive from its peer\n   the ADD-PATH Capability with the Send/Receive field
    set to either 1\n   or 3, for the corresponding <AFI, SAFI>.\n   A BGP speaker
    MUST follow the procedures defined in [RFC4271] when\n   generating an UPDATE
    message for a particular <AFI, SAFI> to a peer\n   unless the BGP speaker advertises
    the ADD-PATH Capability to the peer\n   indicating its ability to send multiple
    paths for the <AFI, SAFI>,\n   and also receives the ADD-PATH Capability from
    the peer indicating\n   its ability to receive multiple paths for the <AFI, SAFI>,
    in which\n   case the speaker MUST generate a route update for the <AFI, SAFI>\n
    \  based on the combination of the address prefix and the Path\n   Identifier,
    and use the extended NLRI encodings specified in this\n   document.  The peer
    SHALL act accordingly in processing an UPDATE\n   message related to a particular
    <AFI, SAFI>.\n   A BGP speaker SHOULD include the best route [RFC4271] when more
    than\n   one path is advertised to a neighbor, unless it is a path received\n
    \  from that neighbor.\n   As the Path Identifiers are locally assigned, and may
    or may not be\n   persistent across a control plane restart of a BGP speaker,
    an\n   implementation SHOULD take special care so that the underlying\n   forwarding
    plane of a \"Receiving Speaker\" as described in [RFC4724]\n   is not affected
    during the graceful restart of a BGP session.\n"
  title: 5.  Operation
- contents:
  - "6.  Deployment Considerations\n   The extension proposed in this document provides
    a mechanism for a\n   BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths over a BGP session.
    \ Care\n   needs to be taken in its deployment to ensure consistent routing and\n
    \  forwarding in a network [ADDPATH].\n   The only explicit indication that the
    encoding described in Section 3\n   is in use in a particular BGP session is the
    exchange of Capabilities\n   described in Section 4.  If the exchange is successful
    [RFC5492],\n   then the BGP speakers will be able to process all BGP UPDATES\n
    \  properly, as described in Section 5.  However, if, for example, a\n   packet
    analyzer is used on the wire to examine an active BGP session,\n   it may not
    be able to properly decode the BGP UPDATES because it\n   lacks prior knowledge
    of the exchanged Capabilities.\n   When deployed as a provider edge router or
    a peering router that\n   interacts with external neighbors, a BGP speaker usually
    advertises\n   at most one path to the internal neighbors in a network.  In the
    case\n   where the speaker is configured to advertise multiple paths to the\n
    \  internal neighbors, and additional information is needed for the\n   application,
    the speaker could use attributes such as the\n   Edge_Discriminator attribute
    [FAST].  The use of that type of\n   additional information is outside the scope
    of this document.\n"
  title: 6.  Deployment Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned the value 69 for the ADD-PATH Capability
    described\n   in this document.  This registration is in the \"Capability Codes\"\n
    \  registry.\n"
  title: 7.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines a BGP extension that allows
    the advertisement\n   of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the
    new paths\n   implicitly replacing any previous ones.  As a result, multiple paths\n
    \  for a large number of prefixes may be received by a BGP speaker,\n   potentially
    depleting memory resources or even causing network-wide\n   instability, which
    can be considered a denial-of-service attack.\n   Note that this is not a new
    vulnerability, but one that is present in\n   the base BGP specification [RFC4272].\n
    \  The use of the ADD-PATH Capability is intended to address specific\n   needs
    related to, for example, eliminating route oscillations that\n   were induced
    by the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute [STOP-OSC].\n   While describing the applications
    for the ADD-PATH Capability is\n   outside the scope of this document, users are
    encouraged to examine\n   their behavior and potential impact by studying the
    best practices\n   described in [ADDPATH].\n   Security concerns in the base operation
    of BGP [RFC4271] also apply.\n"
