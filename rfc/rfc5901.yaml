  - "Abstract\n   This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format\n
    \  (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 to support the reporting of phishing\n   events,
    which is a particular type of fraud.  These extensions are\n   flexible enough
    to support information gleaned from activities\n   throughout the entire electronic
    fraud cycle -- from receipt of the\n   phishing lure to the disablement of the
    collection site.  Both simple\n   reporting and complete forensic reporting are
    possible, as is\n   consolidating multiple incidents.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Deception activities, such as receiving an email purportedly
    from a\n   bank requesting you to confirm your account information, are an\n   expanding
    attack type on the Internet.  The terms \"phishing\" and\n   \"fraud\" are used
    interchangeably in this document to characterize\n   broadly-launched social engineering
    attacks in which an electronic\n   identity is misrepresented in an attempt to
    trick individuals into\n   revealing their personal credentials (e.g., passwords,
    account\n   numbers, personal information, ATM PINs, etc.).  A successful\n   phishing
    attack on an individual allows the phisher (i.e., the\n   attacker) to exploit
    the individual's credentials for financial or\n   other gain.  Phishing attacks
    have morphed from directed email\n   messages from alleged financial institutions
    to more sophisticated\n   lures that may also include malware.\n   This document
    defines a data format extension to the Incident Object\n   Description Exchange
    Format (IODEF) [RFC5070] that can be used to\n   describe information about a
    phishing or other type of fraudulent\n   incident.  Sections 2 and 3 of this document
    provides an overview of\n   the terminology and process of a phishing event.  Section
    4\n   introduces the high-level report format and how to use it.  Sections\n   5
    and 6 describe the data elements of the fraud extensions.  The\n   appendices
    include an XML schema for the extensions and a few example\n   fraud reports.\n
    \  The extensions defined in this document may be used to report the\n   social
    engineering victim lure, the collection site, credential\n   targeted (\"spear\")
    phishing, broad multi-recipient phishing, and\n   other evolving Internet-based
    fraud attempts.  Malware and other\n   malicious software included within the
    lure may also be included\n   within the report.\n"

    - "1.1.  Why a Common Report Format Is Needed\n   To combat the rise in malicious
      activity on the Internet, service\n   providers and investigative agencies are
      sharing more and more\n   network and event data in a coordinated effort to
      identify\n   perpetrators and compromised accounts, coordinate responses, and\n
      \  prosecute attackers.  As the number of data-sharing parties\n   increases,
      the number of party-specific tools, formats, and\n   definitions multiply rapidly
      until they overwhelm the investigative\n   and coordination abilities of those
      parties.\n   By using a common format, it becomes easier for an organization
      to\n   engage in this coordination as well as correlation of information\n   from
      multiple data sources or products into a cohesive view.  As the\n   number of
      data sources increases, a common format becomes even more\n   important, since
      multiple tools would be needed to interpret the\n   different sources of data.
      \ A big win in a common format is the\n   ability to automate many of the analysis
      tasks and significantly\n   speed up the response and prosecution activities.\n"

    - "1.2.  Processing of Exchanged Data Not Defined\n   While the intended use of
      this specification is to facilitate data\n   sharing between parties, the mechanics
      of this sharing process and\n   its related political challenges are out of
      scope for this document.\n"

    - "1.3.  Relation to the INCH IODEF Data Model\n   Instead of defining a new report
      format, this document defines an\n   extension to [RFC5070].  The IODEF defines
      a flexible and extensible\n   format and supports a granular level of specificity.
      \ These phishing\n   and fraud extensions reuse subsets of the IODEF data model
      and, where\n   appropriate, specify new data elements.  Leveraging an existing\n
      \  specification allows for more rapid adoption and reuse of existing\n   tools
      in organizations.  For clarity, and in order to eliminate\n   duplication, only
      the additional structures necessary for describing\n   the exchange of phishing
      and e-crime activity are provided.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology Used in This Document\n   Since many people use different but
    similar terms to mean the same\n   thing, we use the following terminology in
    this document.\n   a.  Phishing\n       The overall process of identifying victims,
    contacting them via a\n       lure, causing a victim to send a set of private
    credentials to a\n       collection site, and storing those credentials is called\n
    \      phishing.\n   b.  Fraud Event\n       A fraud event is the combination
    of phishing and subsequent\n       fraudulent use of the private credentials.\n
    \  c.  Lure\n       A lure is the decoy used to trick a victim into performing
    some\n       activity, such as providing their private credentials.  The lure\n
    \      relies on social engineering concepts to convince the victim that\n       the
    lure is genuine and its instructions should be followed.  A\n       lure includes
    a pointer or link to a collection site.\n   d.  Collection Site\n       The website,
    email box, SMS number, phone number, or other place\n       where a phished victim
    sends their private credentials for later\n       fraudulent use by a criminal.\n
    \  e.  Credentials\n       A credential is data that is transferred or presented
    to\n       establish either a claimed identity or the authorizations of a\n       system
    entity.  Many websites require a user name and password --\n       combined, they
    are a credential -- to access sensitive content.\n   f.  Message\n       Although
    primarily email, a lure can be transported via any\n       messaging medium, such
    as instant messages, Voice over IP (VoIP),\n       or text via an SMS service.
    \ The term \"message\" is used as a\n       generic term for any of these transport
    mediums.\n"

      3.1.  The Components of Internet Fraud\n   Internet-based phishing and fraud
      activities are normally comprised\n   of at least six components:\n   1.  The
      phisher, fraudster, or party perpetrating the fraudulent\n       activity.  Most
      times this party is not readily identifiable.\n   2.  The attack source -- the
      source of the phishing email, virus,\n       trojan, or other attack -- is masked
      in an enticing manner.\n   3.  The lure used to trick the victim into responding.\n
      \  4.  The user, victim, or intended target of the fraud or phish.\n   5.  The
      credentials, personal data, or other information the victim\n       has surrendered
      to the phisher.\n   6.  The collection site, where the victim sends their credentials
      or\n       personal data if they have been duped by the lure of the phisher.\n
      \      This may be a website, mailbox, phone operator, or database.\n   If we
      take a holistic view of the attack, there are some additional\n   components:\n
      \  o  The sensor -- the means by which the phish is detected.  This\n      element
      may be an intrusion detection system, firewall, filter,\n      email gateway,
      or human analyst.\n   o  A forensic or archive site (not pictured), where an
      investigator\n      has copied or otherwise retained the data used for the fraud\n
      \     attempt or credential collection.\n"

      - "3.1.1.  Fraudulent Activity Extensions to the IODEF-Document\n   Fraud events
        are reported in a fraud activity report, which is an\n   instance of an XML
        IODEF-Document Incident element with added\n   EventData and AdditionalData
        elements.  The additional fields in the\n   EventData specific to phishing
        and fraud are enclosed in a\n   PhraudReport XML element.  Fraudulent activity
        may include multiple\n   emails, instant messages, or network messages, scattered
        over various\n   times, locations, and methodologies.  The PhraudReport within
        an\n   EventData may include information about the email header and body,\n
        \  details of the actual phishing lure, correlation to other attacks,\n   and
        details of the removal of the web server or credential collector.\n   As a
        phishing attack may generate multiple reports to an incident\n   team, multiple
        PhraudReports may be combined into one EventData\n   structure, and multiple
        EventData structures may be combined into one\n   incident report.  One IODEF
        incident report may record one or more\n   individual phishing events and
        may include multiple EventData\n   elements.\n   This document defines new

      phishing events.\n   First, a reporter may *create* and exchange a new report
      on a new\n   event.  Secondly, a reporter may *update* a previously exchanged\n
      \  report to indicate new collection sites, site takedown information,\n   or
      related activities.  Lastly, a reporter may have realized that the\n   report
      is in error or contains significant incorrect data and that\n   the prudent
      reaction is to *delete* the report.\n   The three types of reports are denoted
      through the use of the\n   ext-purpose attribute of an Incident element.  A
      new report contains\n   an empty or a \"create\" ext-purpose value; an updated
      report contains\n   an ext-value value of \"update\"; a request for deletion
      contains a\n   \"delete\" ext-purpose value.  Note that this is actually an
      advisory\n   marking for the report originator or recipient, as operating\n

      FraudParameter should be the subject line of the\n       phishing lure email
      or value of a lure IM or VoIP message.  This\n       type is a standard phishing
      lure, usually sent as email, and is\n       intended to exploit the recipient's

      of financial loss to the recipient, but lures the\n       recipient to an infected
      site.\n   4.  fraudulent site.  This identifies a known fraudulent site that\n
      \      does not necessarily send spam but is used to show lures.  The\n       FraudParameter
      may be used to identify the website.\n   5.  dnsspoof.  This choice does not

      of the DNS\n       system.\n   6.  archive.  There is no required FraudParameter
      for this choice,\n       although the FraudParameter of the original phish could

    requires certain identifying\n   information that is contained within the standard
    IODEF Incident data\n   structure and the PhraudReport extensions.  The following
    table\n   identifies attributes required to be present in a compliant\n   PhraudReport
    to report phishing or fraud.  The required attributes\n   are a combination of
    those required by the base IODEF element, as\n   shown in Figure 6.1, and those
    required by this document, shown in\n   Figure 6.2.  Attributes identified as
    required SHALL be populated in\n   conforming phishing activity reports.\n   A

    - "6.1.  Guidance on Usage\n   It may be apparent that the mandatory attributes
      for a PhraudReport\n   make for a quite sparse report.  As incident forensics
      and data\n   analysis require detailed information, the originator of a\n   PhraudReport
      SHOULD include any tidbit of information gleaned from\n   the attack analysis.
      \ Information that is considered sensitive can be\n   marked as such using the
      restriction parameter of each data element.\n   The reporting party is encouraged
      to provide more than just the\n   minimally required data elements about an
      event in a PhraudReport.\n   The additional information may be volatile and
      not recoverable in the\n   future, and may be useful in answering investigation
      questions or in\n   performing correlation with other reported events.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a format for encoding
    a particular class of\n   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.
    \ As\n   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security\n
    \  issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances\n   of
    this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,\n   the underlying
    message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure\n   the appropriate degree
    of confidentiality, integrity, and\n   authenticity for the specific environment.\n
    \  Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to\n   develop
    operating procedures that document the following areas of\n   concern.\n"
  - contents:
    - "7.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns\n   The critical security concerns are that
      phishing activity reports may\n   be falsified or the PhraudReport may become
      corrupt during transit.\n   In areas where transmission security or secrecy
      is questionable, the\n   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption
      on each\n   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each\n
      \  exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for\n   transport
      protection.\n"

  - contents:
    - "7.2.  Using the iodef:restriction Attribute\n   In some instances, data values
      in particular elements may contain\n   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.
      \ Although there are no\n   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values
      as \"private\" or\n   \"need-to-know\" via the iodef:restriction attribute,
      the reporter is\n   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings
      unless they\n   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging
      the\n   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and\n
      \  process the data as marked.  For example, if the PhraudReport element\n   is
      marked private and contains a phishing collector URL in the\n   DCSite/SiteURL
      element, can that URL be included within a block list\n   distributed to other
      parties?  No guidance is provided here except to\n   urge exchanging parties
      to review the IODEF and PhraudReport\n   documents to decide on common marking
      rules.\n"
