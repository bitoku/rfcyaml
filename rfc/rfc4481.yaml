  - "1.  Introduction\n   Traditionally, presence information, e.g., represented as
    Presence\n   Information Data Format [3] (PIDF) and augmented by Rich Presence\n
    \  Information Data format [9] (RPID), describes the current state of\n   the
    presentity.  However, a watcher can better plan communications if\n   it knows
    about the presentity's future plans.  For example, if a\n   watcher knows that
    the presentity is about to travel, it might place\n   a phone call earlier.\n
    \  In this document, we use terms defined in RFC 2778 [7].  In\n   particular,
    a \"presentity\", abbreviating presence entity, provides\n   presence information
    to a presence service.  It is typically a\n   uniquely-identified person.\n   RPID
    already allows a presentity to indicate the period when a\n   particular aspect
    of its presence is valid.  However, the <status>\n   element in the PIDF <tuple>
    does not have this facility, so that it\n   is not possible to indicate that a
    presentity will be OPEN or CLOSED\n   in the future, for example.\n   It is also
    occasionally useful to represent past information since it\n   may be the only
    known presence information; it may give watchers an\n   indication of the current
    status.  For example, indicating that the\n   presentity was at an off-site meeting
    that ended an hour ago\n   indicates that the presentity is likely in transit
    at the current\n   time.\n   It is unfortunately not possible to simply add time
    range attributes\n   to the PIDF <status> element, as PIDF parsers without this
    capability\n   would ignore these attributes and thus not be able to distinguish\n
    \  current from future presence status information.\n   This document defines
    the <timed-status> element that describes the\n   status of a presentity that
    is either no longer valid or covers some\n   future time period.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology and Conventions\n   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT,\n   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted\n
    \  as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology and Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.  Timed-Status Element\n   The <timed-status> element is a child of the <tuple>
    element and MUST\n   NOT appear as a child of a PIDF <status> element or another\n
    \  <timed-status> element.  More than one such element MAY appear within\n   a
    PIDF <tuple> element.\n   Sources of <timed-status> information should avoid elements
    that\n   overlap in time, but since overlapping appointments are common in\n   calendars,
    for example, receivers MUST be able to render such\n   overlapping <timed-status>
    indications.\n   The <timed-status> element MUST be qualified with the 'from'\n
    \  attribute and MAY be qualified with an 'until' attribute to describe\n   the
    time when the status assumed this value and the time until which\n   this element
    is expected to be valid.  If the 'until' attribute is\n   missing, the information
    is assumed valid until the tuple is\n   explicitly overridden or expires as defined
    by the publication\n   mechanism used.  The time range MUST NOT encompass the
    present time,\n   i.e., the PIDF <timestamp> value, as that would provide an\n
    \  unnecessary and confusing alternate mechanism to describe presence.\n   Thus,
    the 'from' attribute for tuples without an 'until' attribute\n   MUST refer to
    the future.\n   During composition, a presence agent (PA) may encounter a stored\n
    \  <timed-status> element that covers the present time.  The PA MAY\n   either
    discard that element or MAY convert it to a regular <status>\n   element if it
    considers that information more credible.\n   The <timed-status> element may contain
    the <basic> and <note>\n   elements, as well as any other element that is appropriate
    as a PIDF\n   <status> extension and that has a limited validity period.  Examples\n
    \  include the PIDF-LO [8] extensions for location objects.\n   This extension
    chose absolute rather than relative times, since\n   relative times would be too
    hard to keep properly updated when\n   spacing notifications, for example.  Originators
    of presence\n   information MUST generate time values in the <timed-status> elements\n
    \  that are fully in the past or future relative to local real\n   (wallclock)
    time and the time information contained in the optional\n   PIDF <timestamp> element.\n"
