  - "1.  Introduction\n   The [SORT] extension to the [IMAP] protocol provides a means
    for the\n   server-based sorting of messages.  It defines a set of sort criteria\n
    \  and the mechanism for determining the sort value of a message for\n   each
    such ordering.\n   The [SORT] FROM and TO orderings sort messages lexically on
    the\n   [IMAP] addr-mailbox of the first address in the message's From and To\n
    \  headers, respectively.  This document provides two alternative\n   orderings,
    DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO, which sort messages based on\n   the first From or
    To address's [IMAP] addr-name (generally the same\n   as its [RFC5322] display-name),
    when present.\n   A server that supports the full [SORT] extension as well as
    both the\n   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO sort criteria indicates this by returning\n
    \  \"SORT=DISPLAY\" in its CAPABILITY response.\n"

    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
- contents:
  - "3.  DISPLAY Sort Value for an Address\n   For the purposes of the sort criteria
    defined in this document, the\n   sort value for an [IMAP] address structure is
    defined as follows:\n   o  If the address structure's [IMAP] addr-name is non-NIL,
    apply the\n      procedure from [RFC5255], Section 4.6.  (That is, decode any\n
    \     [RFC2047] encoded-words and convert the resulting character string\n      into
    a charset valid for the currently active [RFC4790] collation,\n      with a default
    of UTF-8.)  If the resulting octet string is not\n      the empty string, use
    it as the sort value for the address.\n   o  Otherwise, if the address structure's
    [IMAP] addr-mailbox and\n      [IMAP] addr-host are both non-NIL, the sort value
    for the address\n      is addr-mailbox@addr-host.\n   o  Otherwise, if the address
    structure's [IMAP] addr-mailbox is non-\n      NIL, the sort value for the address
    is its addr-mailbox.\n   o  If none of the above conditions are met, the sort
    value for the\n      address is the empty string.\n"
  title: 3.  DISPLAY Sort Value for an Address
- contents:
  - "4.  The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO Sort Criteria\n   This document introduces
    two new [SORT] sort criteria, DISPLAYFROM\n   and DISPLAYTO.  A message's sort
    value under these orderings MUST be\n   derived as follows:\n   A \"derived-addr\"
    value is created from the [IMAP] envelope structure\n   resulting from a FETCH
    ENVELOPE on the message.  For DISPLAYFROM, the\n   derived-addr value is the [IMAP]
    env-from value.  For DISPLAYTO, the\n   derived-addr value is the [IMAP] env-to
    value.\n   o  If the derived-addr value is NIL, the message's sort value is the\n
    \     empty string.\n   o  Otherwise, the message's sort value is the DISPLAY
    sort value of\n      the first [IMAP] address in the derived-addr value.\n"

  - "5.  Formal Syntax\n   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur\n
    \  Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].  [IMAP] defines the\n   non-terminal
    \"capability\", and [SORT] defines \"sort-key\".\n   capability    =/ \"SORT=DISPLAY\"\n
    \  sort-key      =/ \"DISPLAYFROM\" / \"DISPLAYTO\"\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.
    \ As such, it\n   does not change the underlying security considerations of [IMAP].\n
    \  The author believes that no new security issues are introduced with\n   this
    additional IMAP4 capability.\n"
  title: 6.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Internationalization Considerations\n   DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO are string-based
    sort criteria.  As stated\n   in [SORT], the active [RFC4790] collation as per
    [RFC5255] MUST be\n   used when sorting such strings.\n   The DISPLAYFROM and
    DISPLAYTO orderings sort on the full decoded\n   [IMAP] addr-name, when present.
    \ They do not attempt to parse this\n   string in a locale- or language-dependent
    manner in order to\n   determine and sort on some semantically meaningful substring
    such as\n   the surname.\n"

  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   [IMAP] capabilities are registered by publishing
    a Standards Track or\n   IESG-approved Experimental RFC.  This document constitutes\n
    \  registration of the SORT=DISPLAY capability in the [IMAP]\n   capabilities
    registry.\n"
