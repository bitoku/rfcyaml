  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo defines objects for managing DS3 Interface\
    \ objects for use\n   with the SNMP protocol.  This memo is a product of the SNMP\
    \ and\n   Transmission MIB Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force\n\
    \   (IETF).  This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the\n   Internet\
    \ community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\n   improvements.  Please\
    \ refer to the current edition of the \"IAB\n   Official Protocol Standards\"\
    \ for the standardization state and status\n   of this protocol.  Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management\n\
    \   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in\n   TCP/IP-based\
    \ internets.  In particular, this memo defines MIB objects\n   for representing\
    \ DS3 physical interfaces.  Implementors should\n   consult in addition to this\
    \ memo the companion document that\n   describes that DS1 managed objects.\n"
- title: 2.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 which\
    \ defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n      the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an\n      evolution of MIB-I based\
    \ on implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n    \
    \  RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access\
    \ to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for\
    \ the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.  Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  The SMI\n  \
    \ specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject\n   to the\
    \ additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 5 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [13].\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used\
    \ to\n   realize an interface is a DS3 interface.  At present, this applies to\n\
    \   these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:\n      \
    \         ds3 (30)\n   The definitions contained herein are based on the DS3 specifications\n\
    \   in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, and ANSI T1.404-1989\n   [9,10,11].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs\n   Each agent which resides on a host\
    \ which uses DS3 interfaces is\n   required to assign a small, positive integer\
    \ uniquely to each CSU.\n   This is known as the \"CSUIndex\", and is used to\
    \ distinguish between\n   different CSUs attached to a node.  The CSUIndex is\
    \ also used as the\n   \"key\" when accessing tabular information about DS3 interfaces.\n\
    \   The ds3Index column of the DS3 Configuration table relates each CSU\n   to\
    \ its corresponding interface in the Internet-standard MIB.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module\n   There are numerous things that could\
    \ be included in a MIB for DS3\n   signals: the management of multiplexors, CSUs,\
    \ DSUs, and the like.\n   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common\
    \ management of\n   CSUs, both in-chassis and external via proxy.  As such, a\
    \ design\n   decision was made up front to very closely align the MIB with the\
    \ set\n   of objects that can generally be read from CSUs that are currently\n\
    \   deployed.\n"
- title: 4.3.  DS3 Terminology
  contents:
  - "4.3.  DS3 Terminology\n   The terminology used in this document to describe error\
    \ conditions on\n   a DS3 circuit as monitored by a DS3 CSU are from the ANSI\
    \ T1M1.3/90\n   draft standard [12].\n          Out of Frame (OOF) event\n   \
    \            An OOF event is detected when any three or more errors in\n     \
    \          sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3\n          \
    \     M-frame.  An OOF event is cleared when reframe occurs.\n          Loss of\
    \ Signal (LOS)\n               This state is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75\n\
    \               contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either\n        \
    \       positive or negative polarity.\n          Coding Violation (CV)\n    \
    \           For all DS3 applications, a coding violation is a P-bit\n        \
    \       Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the\n             \
    \  occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame\n               that\
    \ is not identical to the corresponding locally-\n               calculated code.\
    \  For C-Bit Parity applications, it is\n               also the occurrence of\
    \ a received CP-Bit parity\n               violation.  For SYNTRAN applications,\
    \ it is also the\n               occurrence of a received CRC-9 code that is not\
    \ identical\n               to the corresponding locally calculated code.\n  \
    \        Bipolar Violation (BPV)\n               A bipolar violation, for B3ZS-coded\
    \ signals, is the\n               occurrence of a received bipolar violation that\
    \ is not\n               part of a zero-substitution code.  For B3ZS-coded\n \
    \              signals, a bipolar violation may also include other error\n   \
    \            patterns such as:  three or more consecutive zeros and\n        \
    \       incorrect parity.\n          Errored Seconds (ES)\n               An ES\
    \ is a second with one or more Coding Violation OR\n               one or more\
    \ Out of Frame events OR an AIS.\n          Severely Errored Seconds (SES)\n \
    \              A SES is a second with 44 or more Coding Violations OR\n      \
    \         one or more Out of Frame events OR an AIS.\n          Severely Errored\
    \ Framing Seconds (SEFS)\n               A SEFS is a second with one or more Out\
    \ of Frame events.\n          Unavailable Seconds (UAS)\n               UAS are\
    \ calculated by counting the number of seconds that\n               the CSU is\
    \ in the Unavailable signal state (i.e.,\n               declared a Red Alarm\
    \ or a Yellow Alarm), including the\n               initial 10 seconds to enter\
    \ the state but not including\n               the 10 seconds to exit the state.\n\
    \               Note that any second that may be counted as an UAS may\n     \
    \          not be counted as an ES or a SES.  Since the 10 SESs that\n       \
    \        comprise the transition from the available to unavailable\n         \
    \      signal state may also be counted as ESs and SESs previous\n           \
    \    to entering the state, these three counters are adjusted\n              \
    \ so that any second counted during this transition is then\n               subtracted.\
    \  The 10 seconds in the transition from\n               unavailable to available\
    \ may be counted as ESs.\n               A special case exists when the 10 or\
    \ more second period\n               crosses the 900 second statistics window\
    \ boundary, as the\n               foregoing description implies that the SES\
    \ and UAS\n               counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable Signal\n\
    \               State is entered. Clearly, successive GETs of the\n          \
    \     affected ds3IntervalSES and ds3IntervalUAS objects will\n              \
    \ return differing values if the first GET occurs during\n               the first\
    \ few seconds of the window.  This is viewed as\n               an unavoidable\
    \ side-effect of selecting the presently\n               defined managed objects\
    \ as a basis for this memo.\n          Yellow Alarm\n               The Yellow\
    \ Alarm is declared after detecting the Yellow\n               Signal.  See ANSI\
    \ T1.107-1989 [10].\n          Red Alarm\n               The Red Alarm is declared\
    \ after detecting a Loss of\n               Signal, a Loss of Frame (a persistent\
    \ OOF event), or an\n               Alarm Indication Signal, see [10] for at least\
    \ 2-10\n               seconds.  The Red Alarm is cleared at the onset of 10\n\
    \               consecutive seconds with no SES.\n          Circuit Identifier\n\
    \               This is a character string specified by the circuit\n        \
    \       vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor\n           \
    \    during the troubleshooting process.\n"
