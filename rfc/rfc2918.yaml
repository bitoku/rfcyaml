- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) capability\n\
    \   termed 'Route Refresh Capability', which would allow the dynamic\n   exchange\
    \ of route refresh request between BGP speakers and subsequent\n   re-advertisement\
    \ of the respective Adj-RIB-Out.  One possible\n   application of this capability\
    \ is to facilitate non-disruptive\n   routing policy changes.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Currently there does not exist a mechanism in BGP-4 [BGP-4]\
    \ to\n   dynamically request a re-advertisement of the Adj-RIB-Out from a BGP\n\
    \   peer.  When the inbound routing policy for a peer changes, all\n   prefixes\
    \ from that peer must be somehow made available and then re-\n   examined against\
    \ the new policy. To accomplish this, a commonly used\n   approach, known as 'soft-reconfiguration',\
    \ is to store an unmodified\n   copy of all routes from that peer at all times,\
    \ even though routing\n   policies do not change frequently (typically no more\
    \ than a couple\n   times a day). Additional memory and CPU are required to maintain\n\
    \   these routes.\n   This document proposes an alternative solution that avoids\
    \ the\n   additional maintenance cost. More specifically, it defines a new BGP\n\
    \   capability termed 'Route Refresh Capability', which would allow the\n   dynamic\
    \ exchange of route refresh request between BGP speakers and\n   subsequent re-advertisement\
    \ of the respective Adj-RIB-Out.\n"
- title: 2. Route Refresh Capability
  contents:
  - "2. Route Refresh Capability\n   To advertise the Route Refresh Capability to\
    \ a peer, a BGP speaker\n   uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [BGP-CAP]. This\
    \ capability is\n   advertised using the Capability code 2 and Capability length\
    \ 0.\n   By advertising the Route Refresh Capability to a peer, a BGP speaker\n\
    \   conveys to the peer that the speaker is capable of receiving and\n   properly\
    \ handling the ROUTE-REFRESH message (as defined in Section 3)\n   from the peer.\n"
- title: 3. Route-REFRESH Message
  contents:
  - "3. Route-REFRESH Message\n   The ROUTE-REFRESH message is a new BGP message type\
    \ defined as\n   follows:\n          Type: 5 - ROUTE-REFRESH\n          Message\
    \ Format: One <AFI, SAFI> encoded as\n                  0       7      15    \
    \  23      31\n                  +-------+-------+-------+-------+\n         \
    \         |      AFI      | Res.  | SAFI  |\n                  +-------+-------+-------+-------+\n\
    \          The meaning, use and encoding of this <AFI, SAFI> field is the\n  \
    \        same as defined in [BGP-MP, sect. 7]. More specifically,\n          \
    \     AFI  - Address Family Identifier (16 bit).\n               Res. - Reserved\
    \ (8 bit) field. Should be set to 0 by the\n                      sender and ignored\
    \ by the receiver.\n               SAFI - Subsequent Address Family Identifier\
    \ (8 bit).\n"
- title: 4. Operation
  contents:
  - "4. Operation\n   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive the ROUTE-REFRESH message\n\
    \   from its peer should advertise the Route Refresh Capability to the\n   peer\
    \ using BGP Capabilities advertisement [BGP-CAP].\n   A BGP speaker may send a\
    \ ROUTE-REFRESH message to its peer only if it\n   has received the Route Refresh\
    \ Capability from its peer.  The <AFI,\n   SAFI> carried in such a message should\
    \ be one of the <AFI, SAFI> that\n   the peer has advertised to the speaker at\
    \ the session establishment\n   time via capability advertisement.\n   If a BGP\
    \ speaker receives from its peer a ROUTE-REFRESH message with\n   the <AFI, SAFI>\
    \ that the speaker didn't advertise to the peer at the\n   session establishment\
    \ time via capability advertisement, the speaker\n   shall ignore such a message.\
    \  Otherwise, the BGP speaker shall re-\n   advertise to that peer the Adj-RIB-Out\
    \ of the <AFI, SAFI> carried in\n   the message, based on its outbound route filtering\
    \ policy.\n"
