- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   MD4 [MD4] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input\
    \ a message\n   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit \"fingerprint\"\
    \ or\n   \"message digest\" of the input.  This document retires [MD4].\n   Specifically,\
    \ this document moves RFC 1320 [MD4] to Historic status.\n   The reasons for taking\
    \ this action are discussed.\n   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in\
    \ many protocols and\n   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's\
    \ one-way\n   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.\n"
- title: 2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.  Rationale\n   MD4 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since its\n\
    \   publication, MD4 has been under attack [denBORBOS1992] [DOBB1995]\n   [DOBB1996]\
    \ [GLRW2010] [WLDCY2005] [LUER2008].  In fact, RSA, in 1996,\n   suggested that\
    \ MD4 should not be used [RSA-AdviceOnMD4].  Microsoft\n   also made similar statements\
    \ [MS-AdviceOnMD4].\n   In Section 6, this document discusses attacks against\
    \ MD4 that\n   indicate use of MD4 is no longer appropriate when collision\n \
    \  resistance is required.  Section 6 also discusses attacks against\n   MD4's\
    \ pre-image and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally,\n   attacks against\
    \ MD4 used in message authentication with a shared\n   secret (i.e., HMAC-MD4)\
    \ are discussed.\n"
- title: 3.  Documents that Reference RFC 1320
  contents:
  - "3.  Documents that Reference RFC 1320\n   Use of MD4 has been specified in the\

- title: 4.  Impact of Moving MD4 to Historic
  contents:
  - "4.  Impact of Moving MD4 to Historic\n   The impact of moving MD4 to Historic\
    \ is minimal with the one\n   exception of Microsoft's use of MD4 as part of RC4-HMAC\
    \ in Windows,\n   as described below.\n   Regarding DS, PS, and BCP RFCs:\n  \
    \ o The initial One-Time Password systems, based on [RFC2289], have\n     ostensibly\
    \ been replaced by HMAC-based mechanism, as specified in\n     \"HOTP: An HMAC-Based\
    \ One-Time Password Algorithm\" [RFC4226].\n     [RFC4226] suggests following\
    \ recommendations in [RFC4086] for\n     random input, and in [RFC4086] weaknesses\
    \ of MD4 are discussed.\n   o MD4 was used in the Inter-Domain Routing Protocol\
    \ (IDRP); each IDRP\n     message carries a 16-octet hash that is computed by\
    \ applying the\n     MD-4 algorithm (RFC 1320) to the context of the message itself.\n\
    \     Over time, IDRP was replaced by BGP-4 [RFC4271], which required at\n   \
    \  least [MD5].\n   o Kerberos Version 5 [RFC3961] specifies the use of MD4 for\
    \ DES\n     encryption types and checksum types.  They were specified, never\n\
    \     really used, and are in the process of being deprecated by\n     [DES-DIE].\
    \  Further, the mandatory-to-implement encrypted types and\n     checksum types\
    \ specified by Kerberos are based on AES-256 and HMAC-\n     SHA1 [RFC3962].\n\
    \   Regarding Informational RFCs:\n   o PKCS#1 v1.5 [RFC2313] indicated that there\
    \ was no reason to not use\n     MD4.  PKCS#1 v2.0 [RFC2437] and v2.1 [RFC3447]\
    \ recommend against\n     MD4 due to cryptoanalytic progress having uncovered\
    \ weaknesses in\n     the collision resistance of MD4.\n   o Randomness Requirements\
    \ [RFC4086] does mention MD4, but not in a\n     good way; it explains how the\
    \ algorithm works and that there have\n     been a number of attacks found against\
    \ it.\n   o The \"Internet Users' Glossary\" [RFC1983] provided a definition for\n\
    \     Message Digest and listed MD4 as one example.\n   o The IETF OTP specification\
    \ [RFC2289] was based on S/KEY technology.\n     So S/KEY was replaced by OTP,\
    \ at least in theory.  Additionally,\n     the S/KEY implementations in the wild\
    \ have started to use MD5 in\n     lieu of MD4.\n   o The CAdES document [RFC5126]\
    \ lists MD4 as a hash algorithm,\n     disparages it, and then does not mention\
    \ it again.\n   o The SHA-1 document [RFC3174] mentions MD4 in the acknowledgements\n\
    \     section.\n   o The three RFCs describing Microsoft protocols, [RFC2433],\n\
    \     [RFC2759], and [RFC4757], are very widely deployed as MS-CHAP v1,\n    \
    \ MS-CHAP v2, and RC4-HMAC, respectively.\n      o MS-CHAP Version 1 is supported\
    \ in Microsoft's Windows XP, 2000,\n        98, 95, NT 4.0, NT 3.51, and NT 3.5,\
    \ but support has been\n        dropped in Vista.  MS-CHAP Version 2 is supported\
    \ in Microsoft's\n        Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, 98, 95, and NT 4.0.  Both\
    \ versions\n        of MS-CHAP are also supported by RADIUS [RFC2548] and the\n\
    \        Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC5281].  In 2007,\n     \
    \   [RFC4962] listed MS-CHAP v1 and v2 as flawed and recommended\n        against\
    \ their use; these incidents were presented as a strong\n        indication for\
    \ the necessity of built-in crypto-algorithm\n        agility in Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n        protocols.\n      o The RC4-HMAC\
    \ is supported in Microsoft's Windows 2000 and later\n        versions of Windows\
    \ for backwards compatibility with Windows\n        2000.  As [RFC4757] stated,\
    \ RC4-HMAC doesn't rely on the\n        collision resistance property of MD4,\
    \ but uses it to generate a\n        key from a password, which is then used as\
    \ input to HMAC-MD5.\n        For an attacker to recover the password from RC4-HMAC,\
    \ the\n        attacker first needs to recover the key that is used with HMAC-\n\
    \        MD5.  As noted in [RFC6151], key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD5\n     \
    \   are not yet practical.\n"
- title: 5.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Other Considerations\n   rsync [RSYNC], a non-IETF protocol, once specified\
    \ the use of MD4,\n   but as of version 3.0.0 published in 2008, it has adopted\
    \ MD5 [MD5].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This section addresses attacks against MD4's\
    \ collisions, pre-image,\n   and second pre-image resistance.  Additionally, attacks\
    \ against HMAC-\n   MD4 are discussed.\n   Some may find the guidance for key\
    \ lengths and algorithm strengths in\n   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Collision Resistance
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Collision Resistance\n   A practical attack on MD4 was shown by Dobbertin\
    \ in 1996 with\n   complexity 2^20 of MD4 hash computations [DOBB1996].  In 2004,\
    \ a more\n   devastating result presented by Xiaoyun Wang showed that the\n  \
    \ complexity can be reduced to 2^8 of MD4 hash operations.  At the Rump\n   Session\
    \ of Crypto 2004, Wang said that as a matter of fact, finding a\n   collision\
    \ of MD4 can be accomplished with a pen on a piece of paper.\n   The formal result\
    \ was presented at EUROCRYPT 2005 in [WLDCY2005].\n"
- title: 6.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance\n   The first pre-image attack\
    \ on full MD4 was accomplished in [LUER2008]\n   with complexity 2^100.  Some\
    \ improvements are shown on pre-image\n   attacks and second pre-image attacks\
    \ of MD4 with certain pre-\n   computations [GLRW2010], where complexity is reduced\
    \ to 2^78.4 and\n   2^69.4 for pre-image and second pre-image, respectively. \
    \ The pre-\n   image attacks on MD4 are practical.  It cannot be used as a one-way\n\
    \   function.  For example, it must not be used to hash a cryptographic\n   key\
    \ of 80 bits or longer.\n"
- title: 6.3.  HMAC
  contents:
  - "6.3.  HMAC\n   The attacks on Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)\n\
    \   algorithms [RFC2104] presented so far can be classified in three\n   types:\
    \ distinguishing attacks, existential forgery attacks, and key\n   recovery attacks.\
    \  Of course, among all these attacks, key recovery\n   attacks are the most severe\
    \ attacks.\n   The best results on key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD4 were published\n\
    \   at EUROCRYPT 2008 with 2^72 queries and 2^77 MD4 computations\n   [WOK2008].\n"
- title: 7.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "7.  Recommendation\n   Despite MD4 seeing some deployment on the Internet, this\n\
    \   specification obsoletes [MD4] because MD4 is not a reasonable\n   candidate\
    \ for further standardization and should be deprecated in\n   favor of one or\
    \ more existing hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 [SHS]).\n   RSA Security considers\
    \ it appropriate to move the MD4 algorithm to\n   Historic status.\n   It takes\
    \ a number of years to deploy crypto and it also takes a\n   number of years to\
    \ withdraw it.  Algorithms need to be withdrawn\n   before a catastrophic break\
    \ is discovered.  MD4 is clearly showing\n   signs of weakness, and implementations\
    \ should strongly consider\n   removing support and migrating to another hash\
    \ algorithm.\n"
