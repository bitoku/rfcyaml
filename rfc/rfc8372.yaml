- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document discusses the aspects that need to be considered\
    \ when\n   developing a solution for MPLS flow identification.  The key\n   application\
    \ that needs this is in-band performance monitoring of MPLS\n   flows when MPLS\
    \ is used to encapsulate user data packets.\n   There is a need to identify flows\
    \ in MPLS networks for various\n   applications such as determining packet loss\
    \ and packet delay\n   measurement.  A method of loss and delay measurement in\
    \ MPLS networks\n   was defined in [RFC6374].  When used to measure packet loss,\n\
    \   [RFC6374] depends on the use of injected Operations, Administration,\n   and\
    \ Maintenance (OAM) packets to designate the beginning and the end\n   of the\
    \ packet group over which packet loss is being measured.  If the\n   misordering\
    \ of packets from one group relative to the following group\n   or the misordering\
    \ of any of the packets being counted relative to\n   the Loss Measurement packet\
    \ [RFC6374] occurs, then an error will\n   occur in the packet loss measurement.\n\
    \   In addition, [RFC6374] did not support different granularities of\n   flow\
    \ or address a number of multipoint cases in which two or more\n   ingress Label\
    \ Switching Routers (LSRs) could send packets to one or\n   more destinations.\n\
    \   Due to the very low loss rate in normal operation, improvements in\n   link\
    \ and transmission technologies have made it more difficult to\n   assess packet\
    \ loss using active performance measurement methods with\n   synthetic traffic.\
    \  That, together with more demanding service-level\n   requirements, means that\
    \ network operators now need to be able to\n   measure the loss of the actual\
    \ user data traffic using passive\n   performance measurement methods.  Any technique\
    \ deployed needs to be\n   transparent to the end user, and it needs to be assumed\
    \ that they\n   will not take any active part in the measurement process.  Indeed,\
    \ it\n   is important that any flow identification technique be invisible to\n\
    \   them and that no remnant of the measurement process leaks into their\n   network.\n\
    \   Additionally, when there are multiple traffic sources, such as in\n   multipoint-to-point\
    \ and multipoint-to-multipoint network\n   environments, there needs to be a method\
    \ whereby the sink can\n   distinguish between packets from the various sources;\
    \ that is to say,\n   a multipoint measurement model needs to be developed.\n"
- title: 2.  Loss Measurement Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Loss Measurement Considerations\n   Modern networks, if not oversubscribed,\
    \ generally drop relatively few\n   packets; thus, packet loss measurement is\
    \ highly sensitive to the\n   common demarcation of the exact set of packets to\
    \ be measured for\n   loss.  Without some form of coloring or batch marking such\
    \ as that\n   proposed in [RFC8321], it may not be possible to achieve the required\n\
    \   accuracy in the loss measurement of customer data traffic.  Thus,\n   when\
    \ accurate measurement of packet loss is required, it may be\n   economically\
    \ advantageous, or even be a technical requirement, to\n   include some form of\
    \ marking in the packets to assign each packet to\n   a particular counter for\
    \ loss measurement purposes.\n   When this level of accuracy is required and the\
    \ traffic between a\n   source-destination pair is subject to Equal-Cost Multipath\
    \ (ECMP), a\n   demarcation mechanism is needed to group the packets into batches.\n\
    \   Once a batch is correlated at both ingress and egress, the packet\n   accounting\
    \ mechanism is then able to operate on the batch of packets\n   that can be accounted\
    \ for at both the packet ingress and the packet\n   egress.  Errors in the accounting\
    \ are particularly acute in Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) subjected to ECMP\
    \ because the network transit\n   time will be different for the various ECMP\
    \ paths since:\n   1.  the packets may traverse different sets of LSRs;\n   2.\
    \  the packets may depart from different interfaces on different\n       line\
    \ cards on LSRs; and\n   3.  the packets may arrive at different interfaces on\
    \ different line\n       cards on LSRs.\n   A consideration with this solution\
    \ on modifying the identity label\n   (the MPLS label ordinarily used to identify\
    \ the LSP, Virtual Private\n   Network, Pseudowire, etc.) to indicate the batch\
    \ is the impact that\n   this has on the path chosen by the ECMP mechanism.  When\
    \ the member\n   of the ECMP path set is chosen by deep packet inspection, a change\
    \ of\n   batch represented by a change of identity label will have no impact\n\
    \   on the ECMP path.  If the path member is chosen by reference to an\n   entropy\
    \ label [RFC6790], then changing the batch identifier will not\n   result in a\
    \ change to the chosen ECMP path.  ECMP is so pervasive in\n   multipoint-to-(multi)point\
    \ networks that some method of avoiding\n   accounting errors introduced by ECMP\
    \ needs to be supported.\n"
- title: 3.  Delay Measurement Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Delay Measurement Considerations\n   Most of the existing delay measurement\
    \ methods are active methods\n   that depend on the extra injected test packet\
    \ to evaluate the delay\n   of a path.  With the active measurement method, the\
    \ rate, numbers,\n   and interval between the injected packets may affect the\
    \ accuracy of\n   the results.  Due to ECMP (or link aggregation techniques),\
    \ injected\n   test packets may traverse different links from the ones used by\
    \ the\n   data traffic.  Thus, measuring the delay of the real traffic is\n  \
    \ required.\n   For combined loss and delay measurements, both the loss and the\
    \ delay\n   considerations apply.\n"
- title: 4.  Units of Identification
  contents:
  - "4.  Units of Identification\n   The most basic unit of identification is the\
    \ identity of the node\n   that processed the packet on its entry to the MPLS\
    \ network.  However,\n   the required unit of identification may vary depending\
    \ on the use\n   case for accounting, performance measurement, or other types\
    \ of\n   packet observations.  In particular, note that there may be a need to\n\
    \   impose identity at several different layers of the MPLS label stack.\n   This\
    \ document considers the identification of the following traffic\n   components:\n\
    \   o  Per source LSR: everything from one source is aggregated\n   o  Per group\
    \ of LSPs chosen by an ingress LSR: an ingress LSP\n      aggregates a group of\
    \ LSPs (e.g., all the LSPs of a tunnel)\n   o  Per LSP: the basic form\n   o \
    \ Per flow [RFC6790] within an LSP: a fine-grained method\n   Note that a fine-grained\
    \ identity resolution is needed when there is\n   a need to perform these operations\
    \ on a flow not readily identified\n   by some other element in the label stack.\
    \  Such a fine-grained\n   resolution may be possible by deep packet inspection.\
    \  However, this\n   may not always be possible, or it may be desired to minimize\n\
    \   processing costs by doing this only on entry to the network.  Adding\n   a\
    \ suitable identifier to the packet for reference by other network\n   elements\
    \ minimizes the processing needed by other network elements.\n   An example of\
    \ such a fine-grained case might be traffic belonging to\n   a certain service\
    \ or from a specific source, particularly if matters\n   related to service level\
    \ agreement or application performance were\n   being investigated.\n   We can\
    \ thus characterize the identification requirement in the\n   following broad\
    \ terms:\n   o  There needs to be some way for an egress LSR to identify the\n\
    \      ingress LSR with an appropriate degree of scope.  This concept is\n   \
    \   discussed further in Section 6.\n   o  There needs to be a way to identify\
    \ a specific LSP at the egress\n      node.  This allows for the case of instrumenting\
    \ multiple LSPs\n      operating between the same pair of nodes.  In such cases,\
    \ the\n      identity of the ingress LSR is insufficient.\n   o  In order to conserve\
    \ resources such as labels, counters, and/or\n      compute cycles, it may be\
    \ desirable to identify an LSP group so\n      that an operation can be performed\
    \ on the group as an aggregate.\n   o  There needs to be a way to identify a flow\
    \ within an LSP.  This is\n      necessary when investigating a specific flow\
    \ that has been\n      aggregated into an LSP.\n   The unit of identification\
    \ and the method of determining which\n   packets constitute a flow will be specific\
    \ to the application or use\n   case and are out of scope of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Types of LSP
  contents:
  - "5.  Types of LSP\n   We need to consider a number of types of LSP.  The two simplest\
    \ types\n   to monitor are point-to-point LSPs and point-to-multipoint LSPs. \
    \ The\n   ingress LSR for a point-to-point LSP, such as those created using the\n\
    \   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   [RFC5420]\
    \ signaling protocol or those that conform to the MPLS\n   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\
    \ [RFC5654], may be identified by\n   inspection of the top label in the stack\
    \ because, at any provider-\n   edge (PE) or provider (P) router on the path,\
    \ the top label is unique\n   to the ingress-egress pair at every hop at a given\
    \ layer in the LSP\n   hierarchy.  Provided that Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)\
    \ is disabled,\n   the identity of the ingress LSR of a point-to-point LSP is\
    \ available\n   at the egress LSR; thus, determining the identity of the ingress\
    \ LSR\n   must be regarded as a solved problem.  Note, however, that the\n   identity\
    \ of a flow cannot to be determined without further\n   information being carried\
    \ in the packet or gleaned from some aspect\n   of the packet payload.\n   In\
    \ the case of a point-to-multipoint LSP, and in the absence of PHP,\n   the identity\
    \ of the ingress LSR may also be inferred from the top\n   label.  However, it\
    \ may not possible to adequately identify the flow\n   from the top label alone;\
    \ thus, further information may need to be\n   carried in the packet or gleaned\
    \ from some aspect of the packet\n   payload.  In designing any solution, it is\
    \ desirable that a common\n   flow identification solution be used for both point-to-point\
    \ and\n   point-to-multipoint LSP types.  Similarly, it is desirable that a\n\
    \   common method of LSP group identification be used.  In the above\n   cases,\
    \ a context label [RFC5331] needs to be used to provide the\n   required identity\
    \ information.  This is a widely supported MPLS\n   feature.\n   A more interesting\
    \ case is the case of a multipoint-to-point LSP.  In\n   this case, the same label\
    \ is normally used by multiple ingress or\n   upstream LSRs; hence, source identification\
    \ is not possible by\n   inspection of the top label by the egress LSRs.  It is\
    \ therefore\n   necessary for a packet to be able to explicitly convey any of\
    \ the\n   identity types described in Section 4.\n   Similarly, in the case of\
    \ a multipoint-to-multipoint LSP, the same\n   label is normally used by multiple\
    \ ingress or upstream LSRs; hence,\n   source identification is not possible by\
    \ inspection of the top label\n   by egress LSRs.  The various identity types\
    \ described in Section 4\n   are again needed.  Note, however, that the scope\
    \ of the identity may\n   be constrained to be unique within the set of multipoint-to-\n\
    \   multipoint LSPs terminating on any common node.\n"
- title: 6.  Network Scope
  contents:
  - "6.  Network Scope\n   The scope of identification can be constrained to the set\
    \ of flows\n   that are uniquely identifiable at an ingress LSR or some aggregation\n\
    \   thereof.  There is no need for an ingress LSR to seek assistance from\n  \
    \ outside the MPLS protocol domain.\n   In any solution that constrains itself\
    \ to carrying the required\n   identity in the MPLS label stack rather than in\
    \ some different\n   associated data structure, constraints on the choice of label\
    \ and\n   label stack size imply that the scope of identity resides within that\n\
    \   MPLS domain.  For similar reasons, the identity scope of a component\n   of\
    \ an LSP is constrained to the scope of that LSP.\n"
- title: 7.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "7.  Backwards Compatibility\n   In any network, it is unlikely that all LSRs\
    \ will have the same\n   capability to support the methods of identification discussed\
    \ in this\n   document.  It is therefore an important constraint on any flow\n\
    \   identity solution that it is backwards compatible with deployed MPLS\n   equipment\
    \ to the extent that deploying the new feature will not\n   disable anything that\
    \ currently works on the legacy equipment.\n   This is particularly the case when\
    \ the deployment is incremental or\n   the feature is not required for all LSRs\
    \ or all LSPs.  Thus, the flow\n   identification design must support the coexistence\
    \ of LSRs that can\n   identify the traffic components described in Section 4\
    \ and those that\n   cannot.  In addition, the identification of the traffic components\n\
    \   described in Section 4 must be an optional feature that is disabled\n   by\
    \ default.  As a design simplification, a solution may require that\n   all egress\
    \ LSRs of a point-to-multipoint or a multipoint-to-\n   multipoint LSP support\
    \ the identification type in use so that a\n   single packet can be correctly\
    \ processed by all egress devices.  The\n   corollary of this last point is that\
    \ either all egress LSRs are\n   enabled to support the required identity type\
    \ or none of them are.\n"
- title: 8.  Data Plane
  contents:
  - "8.  Data Plane\n   There is a huge installed base of MPLS equipment; typically,\
    \ this\n   type of equipment remains in service for an extended period of time,\n\
    \   and in many cases, hardware constraints mean that it is not possible\n   to\
    \ upgrade its data-plane functionality.  Changes to the MPLS data\n   plane are\
    \ therefore expensive to implement, add complexity to the\n   network, and may\
    \ significantly impact the deployability of a solution\n   that requires such\
    \ changes.  For these reasons, MPLS users have set a\n   very high bar to changes\
    \ to the MPLS data plane, and only a very\n   small number have been adopted.\
    \  Hence, it is important that the\n   method of identification must minimize\
    \ changes to the MPLS data\n   plane.  Ideally, method(s) of identification that\
    \ require no changes\n   to the MPLS data plane should be given preferential consideration.\n\
    \   If a method of identification that makes a change to the data plane\n   is\
    \ chosen, it will need to have a significant advantage over any\n   method that\
    \ makes no change, and the advantage of the approach will\n   need to be carefully\
    \ evaluated and documented.  If a change to the\n   MPLS data plane proves necessary,\
    \ it should be (a) as small a change\n   as possible and (b) a general-purpose\
    \ method, so as to maximize its\n   use for future applications.  It is imperative\
    \ that, as far as can be\n   foreseen, any necessary change made to the MPLS data\
    \ plane does not\n   impose any foreseeable future limitation on the MPLS data\
    \ plane.\n   Stack size is an issue with many MPLS implementations both as a\n\
    \   result of hardware limitations and due to the impact on networks and\n   applications\
    \ in which a large number of small payloads need to be\n   transported.  In particular,\
    \ one MPLS payload may be carried inside\n   another.  For example, one LSP may\
    \ be carried over another LSP, or a\n   Pseudowire (PW) or similar multiplexing\
    \ construct may be carried over\n   an LSP, and identification may be required\
    \ at both layers.  Of\n   particular concern is the implementation of low-cost\
    \ edge LSRs that,\n   for cost reasons, have a significant limit on the number\
    \ of Label\n   Stack Entries (LSEs) that they can impose or dispose.  Therefore,\
    \ any\n   method of identity must not consume an excessive number of unique\n\
    \   labels and must not result in an excessive increase in the size of\n   the\
    \ label stack.\n   The design of the MPLS data plane provides two types of special-\n\
    \   purpose labels: the original 16 reserved labels and the much larger\n   set\
    \ of special-purpose labels defined in [RFC7274].  The original\n   reserved labels\
    \ need one LSE, and the newer special-purpose labels\n   [RFC7274] need two LSEs.\
    \  Given the tiny number of original reserved\n   labels, it is core to the MPLS\
    \ design philosophy that this scarce\n   resource is only used when it is absolutely\
    \ necessary.  Using a\n   special-purpose label to encode flow identity requires\
    \ two label\n   stack entries, one for the reserved label and one for the flow\n\
    \   identity.  Use of extended special-purpose labels [RFC7274] requires\n   a\
    \ total of three label stack entries to encode the flow identity.\n   The larger\
    \ set of [RFC7274] labels requires two label stack entries\n   for the special-purpose\
    \ label itself; hence, a total of three label\n   stack entries is needed to encode\
    \ the flow identity.\n   The use of special-purpose labels [RFC7274] as part of\
    \ a method to\n   encode the identity information therefore has a number of undesirable\n\
    \   implications for the data plane.  Thus, while a solution may use\n   special-purpose\
    \ labels, methods that do not require special-purpose\n   labels need to be carefully\
    \ considered.\n"
- title: 9.  Control Plane
  contents:
  - "9.  Control Plane\n   Any flow identity design should both seek to minimize the\
    \ complexity\n   of the control plane and minimize the amount of label coordination\n\
    \   needed amongst LSRs.\n"
- title: 10.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Privacy Considerations\n   The inclusion of originating and/or flow information\
    \ in a packet\n   provides more identity information and hence potentially degrades\
    \ the\n   privacy of the communication.\n   Recent IETF concerns on pervasive\
    \ monitoring [RFC7258] have resulted\n   in a preference for a solution that does\
    \ not degrade the privacy of\n   user traffic below that of an MPLS network not\
    \ implementing the flow\n   identification feature.  The choice of using MPLS\
    \ technology for this\n   OAM solution has a privacy advantage, as the choice\
    \ of the label\n   identifying a flow is limited to the scope of the MPLS domain\
    \ and\n   does not have any dependency on the identification of the user data.\n\
    \   This minimizes the observability of the flow characteristics.\n"
- title: 11.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   Any flow identification solution must not degrade\
    \ the security of the\n   MPLS network below that of an equivalent network not\
    \ deploying the\n   specified identity solution.  In order to preserve present\n\
    \   assumptions about MPLS privacy properties, propagation of\n   identification\
    \ information outside the MPLS network imposing it must\n   be disabled by default.\
    \  Any solution should provide for the\n   restriction of the identity information\
    \ to those components of the\n   network that need to know it.  It is thus desirable\
    \ to limit the\n   knowledge of the identify of an endpoint to only those LSRs\
    \ that need\n   to participate in traffic flow.  The choice of using MPLS technology\n\
    \   for this OAM solution, with MPLS encapsulation of user traffic,\n   provides\
    \ for a key advantage over other data-plane solutions, as it\n   provides for\
    \ a controlled access and trusted domain within a service\n   provider's network.\n\
