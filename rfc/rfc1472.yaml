  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 defines a more\
    \ concise description mechanism, which is\n      wholly consistent with the SMI.\n\
    \      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n      objects\
    \ for the Internet suite of protocols.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the\
    \ SNMP, the protocol used for\n      network access to managed objects.\n   The\
    \ Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation\
    \ and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [3]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\
    \ an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together with an object\
    \ instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation of the object.\
    \  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor,\
    \ to refer to the\n   object type.\n"

    \ in [5,6].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Object Selection Criteria
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Object Selection Criteria\n   To be consistent with IAB directives and\
    \ good engineering practice,\n   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB\
    \ as simple as possible.\n   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria\
    \ to objects\n   proposed for inclusion:\n      (1)  Require objects be essential\
    \ for either fault or\n           configuration management.  In particular, objects\
    \ for\n           which the sole purpose was to debug implementations were\n \
    \          explicitly excluded from the MIB.\n      (2)  Consider evidence of\
    \ current use and/or utility.\n      (3)  Limit the total number of objects.\n\
    \      (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in\n      \
    \     this or other MIBs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Structure of the PPP
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Structure of the PPP\n   This section describes the basic model of PPP\
    \ used in developing the\n   PPP MIB. This information should be useful to the\
    \ implementor in\n   understanding some of the basic design decisions of the MIB.\n\
    \   The PPP is not one single protocol but a large family of protocols.\n   Each\
    \ of these is, in itself, a fairly complex protocol.  The PPP\n   protocols may\
    \ be divided into three rough categories:\n   Control Protocols\n      The Control\
    \ Protocols are used to control the operation of the\n      PPP. The Control Protocols\
    \ include the Link Control Protocol\n      (LCP), the Password Authentication\
    \ Protocol (PAP), the Link\n      Quality Report (LQR), and the Challenge Handshake\
    \ Authentication\n      Protocol (CHAP).\n   Network Protocols\n      The Network\
    \ Protocols are used to move the network traffic over\n      the PPP interface.\
    \  A Network Protocol encapsulates the datagrams\n      of a specific higher-layer\
    \ protocol that is using the PPP as a\n      data link.  Note that within the\
    \ context of PPP, the term \"Network\n      Protocol\" does not imply an OSI Layer-3\
    \ protocol; for instance,\n      there is a Bridging network protocol.\n   Network\
    \ Control Protocols (NCPs)\n      The NCPs are used to control the operation of\
    \ the Network\n      Protocols. Generally, each Network Protocol has its own Network\n\
    \      Control Protocol; thus, the IP Network Protocol has its IP Control\n  \
    \    Protocol, the Bridging Network Protocol has its Bridging Network\n      Control\
    \ Protocol and so on.\n   This document specifies the objects used in managing\
    \ one of these\n   protocols, namely the PPP Authentication Protocols.\n"
- title: 3.3.  MIB Groups
  contents:
  - "3.3.  MIB Groups\n   Objects in this MIB are arranged into several MIB groups.\
    \  Each group\n   is organized as a set of related objects.\n   These groups are\
    \ the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a\n   group are applicable\
    \ to an implementation then all objects in the\n   group must be implemented.\n\
    \   The PPP MIB is organized into several MIB Groups, including, but not\n   limited\
    \ to, the following groups:\n          o The PPP Link Group\n          o The PPP\
    \ LQR Group\n          o The PPP LQR Extensions Group\n          o The PPP IP\
    \ Group\n          o The PPP Bridge Group\n          o The PPP Security Group\n\
    \   This document specifies the following group:\n   PPP Security Group\n    \
    \  The PPP Security Group contains all configuration and control\n      variables\
    \ that apply to PPP security.\n      Implementation of this group is optional.\
    \  Implementation is\n      optional since the variables in this group provide\
    \ configuration\n      and control for the PPP Security functions.  Thus, these\
    \ variables\n      should be protected by SNMPv2 security.  If an agent does not\n\
    \      support SNMPv2 with privacy it is strongly advised that this group\n  \
    \    not be implemented.  See the section on \"Security Considerations\"\n   \
    \   at the end of this document.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The PPP MIB affords the network operator the\
    \ ability to configure and\n   control the PPP links of a particular system, including\
    \ the PPP\n   authentication protocols. This represents a security risk.\n   These\
    \ risks are addressed in the following manners:\n      (1)  All variables which\
    \ represent a significant security risk\n           are placed in separate, optional,\
    \ MIB Groups. As the MIB\n           Group is the quantum of implementation within\
    \ a MIB, the\n           implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these\n\
    \           groups.\n      (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables\n\
    \           which present a security risk so that they may not be\n          \
    \ written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method\n           still presents\
    \ a security risk, and is not recommended,\n           in that the variables,\
    \ specifically the PPP\n           Authentication Protocols' variables, may be\
    \ easily read.\n      (3)  Using SNMPv2, the operator can place the variables\
    \ into\n           MIB views which are protected in that the parties which\n \
    \          have access to those MIB views use authentication and\n           privacy\
    \ protocols, or the operator may elect to make\n           these views not accessible\
    \ to any party.  In order to\n           facilitate this placement, all security-related\
    \ variables\n           are placed in separate MIB Tables. This eases the\n  \
    \         identification of the necessary MIB View Subtree.\n      (4)  The PPP\
    \ Security Protocols MIB (this document) contains\n           several objects\
    \ which are very sensitive from a security\n           point of view.\n   Specifically,\
    \ this MIB contains objects that define the PPP Peer\n   Identities (which can\
    \ be viewed as \"userids\") and the secrets used to\n   authenticate those Peer\
    \ Identities (similar to a \"password\" for the\n   \"userid\").\n   Also, this\
    \ MIB contains variables which would allow a network manager\n   to control the\
    \ operation of the security features of PPP.  An\n   intruder could disable PPP\
    \ security if these variables were not\n   properly protected.\n   Thus, in order\
    \ to preserve the integrity, security and privacy of the\n   PPP security features,\
    \ an implementation will allow access to this\n   MIB only via SNMPv2 and then\
    \ only for parties which are privacy\n   enhanced.  Other access modes, e.g.,\
    \ SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 without\n   privacy- enhancement, are very dangerous and the\
    \ security of the PPP\n   service may be compromised.\n"
