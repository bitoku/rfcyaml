- title: 2.1.  Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies\n   There are three basic types of\
    \ policies used to define what the PEP\n   is to monitor, record and report. \
    \ These are the selection criteria\n   policy, the usage policy and the feedback\
    \ report linkage policy.\n   The selection criteria policy is installed by the\
    \ PDP.  It defines\n   the conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a\
    \ usage policy.\n   The selection criteria policy may only be used for defining\
    \ usage\n   feedback selection criteria.  However, a more general case is a\n\
    \   policy that already exists for policy enforcement that may also be\n   used\
    \ for specifying feedback usage selection criteria.  An example of\n   this is\
    \ the frwkRoleCombo instance, which may be used in defining QoS\n   enforcement\
    \ policies, but may also be used to specify conditions on\n   which to base usage\
    \ - i.e. count the number of packets meeting the\n   criterion of an interface\
    \ capability set name and role combination.\n   The usage policy defines what\
    \ attributes are recorded by the PEP.\n   These policies have an ACCESS clause\
    \ of 'report-only'.  Generally,\n   the usage policies specify counts related\
    \ to a specific action such\n   as a packet being dropped.  The feedback framework\
    \ PIB defines two\n   usage policy classes, frwkFeedbackTraffic and frwkFeedbackIfTraffic.\n\
    \   Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic statistics, or they may\n   be\
    \ specific to a particular usage.  The PDP decides which PRC(s) best\n   suit(s)\
    \ its requirements.  The PEP may support only one usage\n   feedback PRC, in which\
    \ case all statistics are gathered using\n   instances of that PRC.  Alternatively,\
    \ the PEP may support multiple\n   usage feedback PRCs.  The PDP then decides\
    \ which PRC to associate\n   with a particular selection criterion.\n   A usage\
    \ feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated\n   with one another.\
    \  A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is used\n   to associate, or provide\
    \ a linkage for the selection and usage\n   policies.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable\
    \ also specifies when to report\n   the usage feedback.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable\
    \ entry permits the same\n   selection criteria instance to be re-used for various\
    \ usage feedback\n   policies.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of\
    \ the\n   selection criteria instance as well as the value of the usage\n   feedback\
    \ PRC.\n    -----------------     ------------------      -----------------\n\

    \                            Figure 1\n   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship\
    \ between the selection criteria,\n   linkage and usage policies.\n   The PDP\
    \ is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback\n   policy when\
    \ installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage\n   policies.  The usage\
    \ feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by\n   the installation of a feedback\
    \ report linkage and the PEP designates\n   the instance identifier.  The usage\
    \ feedback policy class always\n   contains an attribute of type ReferenceId that\
    \ contains the instance\n   value of the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance\
    \ installed by\n   the PDP.  An example of this is the attribute\n   frwkFeedbackTrafficLinkRef.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request\n   The Accounting\
    \ Timer object in the COPS Connection Accept message\n   contains the minimum\
    \ number of seconds between reporting intervals as\n   described in [COPS] and\
    \ [FEEDBACKFWK].  This is used as the basic\n   unit of measurement in defining\
    \ intervals for specific usage policies\n   with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval\
    \ attribute.\n   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes\
    \ and\n   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for\n  \
    \ configuration data using frwkPRCSupport instances [FR-PIB].  The PEP\n   also\
    \ indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable as well.\n   The PDP\
    \ responds to the initial request for configuration with a\n   DECISION that installs\
    \ policies.  The PDP may also specify maximum\n   reporting intervals associated\
    \ with each of the usage policies.  This\n   is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval\
    \ attribute in the\n   frwkFeedbackLink class.  It may also specify reporting\
    \ thresholds by\n   including an instance of a threshold class (e.g.\n   frwkFeedbackTrafficThreshold)\
    \ in the decision.  The PEP monitors and\n   records the usage per the conditions\
    \ defined by its associated\n   selection criteria policy.  Periodically the PEP\
    \ reports the usage\n   with a REPORT message or provides a REPORT when solicited\
    \ by the PDP.\n   The PDP solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator\n\
    \   attribute of the frwkFeedbackAction class.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting\n   Reporting may be periodic\
    \ in nature and unsolicited.  The intervals\n   at which the unsolicited reports\
    \ are provided by the PEP are defined\n   in the specific Linkage policies.  The\
    \ defined intervals are based on\n   the number of seconds specified by the PDP\
    \ in the ACCT Timer value.\n   The PDP may specify that the associated usage instance\
    \ be included in\n   a periodic unsolicited report only if the threshold is reached\
    \ and/or\n   if the usage value has changed from the previous reporting interval.\n\
    \   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback reports\n  \
    \ that may not fall on an interval boundary.  The PEP MUST provide an\n   unsolicited\
    \ REPORT containing all defined usage instances just prior\n   to the PEP issuing\
    \ a Delete Request State and just prior to the PEP\n   de-activating a PIB instance\
    \ context.\n"

    \ for individual usage feedback instances\n   can be suppressed by specifying\
    \ additional conditions in the\n   frwkFeedbackLink instances.  Supported conditions\
    \ are:\n   ChangeOnly\n      If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags\
    \ attribute, the\n      associated usage instance is only included in a periodic\n\
    \      unsolicited report if its value changed since the last unsolicited\n  \
    \    report.\n   Threshold\n      If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags\

    \ instance.\n   Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object.\n\
    \   In this case, both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance\n   to\
    \ be reported.\n   Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or\
    \ the\n   deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions -\n\
    \   all usage objects must be included in these cases.\n"

    \ an unsolicited\n   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to\n\

    \ the specified intervals established at client\n   connection acceptance.\n \
    \  The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect\n   solicited\

- title: 2.2.5.  Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting
  contents:
  - "2.2.5.  Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting\n   The PDP may suspend\
    \ usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the\n   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator\
    \ set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'.\n   The PEP must stop tracking usage information\
    \ and must not issue any\n   feedback reports.  The PDP may only suspend feedback\
    \ reporting by\n   setting the ActionIndicator to 'suspendReports'.  The PEP must\
    \ cease\n   sending unsolicited reports but is to continue monitoring and\n  \

    \ may resume usage monitoring by setting the ActionIndicator to\n   'resume'.\n\
    \   The PDP may suspend or resume all usage instances or the PDP may\n   specify\
    \ one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed.\n   The frwkFeedbackActionList\
    \ attribute contains a tag identifier that\n   references a list of one or more\
    \ frwkFeedbackActionList instances.\n   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking\
    \ and reporting of usage\n   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.\n"
- title: 2.2.6.  Failover
  contents:
  - "2.2.6.  Failover\n   In the event that the connection is lost between the PEP\
    \ and PDP, the\n   PEP continues to track usage information as long as it continues\
    \ to\n   operate with the installed policy.  When the locally installed policy\n\
    \   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.\n   Upon successful\
    \ reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy,\n   the PDP indicates to\
    \ the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the\n   COPS accounting type report\
    \ messages.  The PDP does this by issuing\n   an unsolicited decision containing\
    \ the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator\n   set to 'resume'.  The PEP should resume\
    \ reporting at the next\n   appropriate feedback interval established upon the\
    \ acceptance of the\n   re-connection.  The PDP is aware of the request state\
    \ Handle(s) and\n   the supported PRCs either through the state synchronization\
    \ mechanism\n   or because the PDP considers itself synchronized with the PEP\
    \ upon\n   reconnection.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Usage Policy and Under-specified Selection Criteria
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Usage Policy and Under-specified Selection Criteria\n   Some of the usage\
    \ policy objects created in the PEP with COPS-PR can\n   be used by the PEP multiple\
    \ times - they effectively act as templates\n   for the objects created by the\
    \ PEP.  COPS-PR only has the identity\n   (OID) of the object that is shared between\
    \ all the assignments the\n   PEP created.  However it is desirable to collect\
    \ usage information\n   for each of the derived objects individually.\n   This\
    \ capability is achieved in the feedback framework PIB by\n   distributing additional\
    \ information to qualify a specific assignment\n   of an object between the selection\
    \ criteria PRC and the feedback\n   usage PRC.\n   A selection criteria PRC that\
    \ refers to a shared object, but contains\n   no qualifying information, selects\
    \ all of the object's assignments.\n   Such a selection criteria PRC SHOULD be\
    \ combined with a feedback\n   usage PRC that includes all the necessary information\
    \ to identify a\n   specific assignment - a single selection criteria policy can\
    \ then\n   result in the generation of many feedback usage objects, one for each\n\
    \   derived object.\n   If the selection criteria PRC contains all the required\
    \ qualifying\n   attributes for a specific assignment, it is combined with a feedback\n\
    \   usage PRC that only contains the desired metrics but no additional\n   attributes.\n\
    \   Example:\n      A frwkRoleCombo instance may be used as a selection criteria,\n\
    \      identifying a set of interfaces through their role combination and\n  \
    \    capability set.  If it is desired to get per-interface traffic\n      statistics,\
    \ the usage PRC has to include an additional attribute\n      to qualify the specific\
    \ interface.\n      This could be achieved by linking the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic\
    \ class\n      with a frwkRoleCombo instance in a frwkFeedbackLink instance.\n\
    \      Multiple frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances will be created by the\n     \
    \ PEP, one for each interface selected by the frwkRoleCombo\n      instance. \
    \ The frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class contains the\n      frwkFeedbackIfTrafficIfIndex\
    \ attribute that allows the PDP to\n      identify each interface's individual\
    \ counters when the PEP reports\n      the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances.\n\
    \      If traffic usage collection is only desired for an individual\n      interface,\
    \ a selection criteria should be used that qualifies the\n      interface completely,\
    \ for example a frwkIfRoleCombo instance.  In\n      this case, it can be linked\
    \ to the usage class that has no\n      additional qualifying attributes, frwkFeedbackTraffic.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This PIB defines structured information that\
    \ may be sensitive when\n   transported by the COPS protocol [COPS-PR].\n   This\
    \ PIB does not contain classes that directly contain security\n   relevant information\
    \ like passwords or monetary amounts.  However,\n   unauthorized access or changes\
    \ to information defined in this PIB\n   could compromise network operations or\
    \ reveal sensitive business or\n   personal information.\n   Specifically for\
    \ the classes:\n   frwkFeedbackLinkCaps\n      This class has the ACCESS clause\
    \ 'notify'.  Access to this\n      information reveals feedback collection capabilities\
    \ of the COPS\n      client and malicious changes could affect feedback operation\
    \ by\n      misleading the server to generate corrupt feedback configuration.\n\
    \   frwkFeedbackLinkTable, frwkFeedbackAction, frwkFeedbackActionList,\n   frwkFeedbackTrafficThres,\
    \ frwkFeedbackRoleFilterSel\n      These classes have the ACCESS clause 'install'\
    \ and allow the COPS\n      server to control feedback collection and reporting\
    \ on the client.\n      Access to this information exposes the client's configuration;\n\
    \      malicious changes could disrupt network or business operations and\n  \
    \    raise privacy issues.\n   frwkFeedbackTraffic, frwkFeedbackIfTraffic\n  \
    \    These classes have the ACCESS clause 'report-only' and contain the\n    \
    \  usage information delivered from the COPS client to the server.\n      Unauthorized\
    \ access to this information may reveal detailed\n      information on the network\
    \ and its users.  Malicious changes may\n      affect network and business operations.\n\
    \   [COPS] and [COPS-PR] define mechanisms to secure the COPS protocol\n   communication\
    \ and implementations of COPS servers or clients\n   supporting this PIB MUST\
    \ follow the security guidelines specified\n   there.\n"
