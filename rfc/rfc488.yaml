  - "                      NLS Classes at Network Sites\nPurpose of this RFC\nNetwork\
    \ users have expressed interest in holding NLS classes at sites on\nthe Network,\
    \ instead of at SRI-ARC.  This RFC solicits comments from the\nNetwork community\
    \ on the desirability of doing on-site classes.\nA brief outline of course contents\
    \ is included at the end of this RFC,\ntogether with some logistic information\
    \ which we feel is necessary to\nconducting a useful class.\nPlease review this\
    \ information, and let us know whether such a class\nwould be useful if conducted\
    \ at or near your site.  We are eager to\nparticipate in this way, because we\
    \ know it will be useful to us to have\nthe benefit of consultation with experienced\
    \ Network users.\nAs we have to schedule our people's time in advance, we are\
    \ tentatively\nconsidering making trips to Washington D.C. during the first week\
    \ of\nMay, and to Boston during the first week of June, for the purpose of\nconducting\
    \ classes.  We will consider other arrangements, however,\nif they would be more\
    \ satisfactory.\nPlease respond by April 15 to Marilyn Auerbach (MFA) at the NIC\n\
    (415)326-6200 extension 3722.\nNLS Class Information\nThe class is a comprehensive\
    \ introduction to the use of NLS over the\nNetwork.  The class generally runs\
    \ for two to three days, depending on\nthe composition and interests of the participants.\n\
    For purposes of planning, the following information will be useful:\n    1.  We\
    \ have found the optimum class size to be six, with an upper\n    limit of ten.\n\
    \    2.  We need a room large enough to hold the number of students, with\n  \
    \  a teletype-type terminal and appropriate connections for each\n    student,\
    \ a flip-chart stand and a large blackboard.\nClass Outline - TNLS Course\nWe\
    \ have held NLS classes approximately a dozen times.  In all, nearly a\nhundred\
    \ people have attended these classes.  While we feel that the\ntraining has been\
    \ helpful, we also recognize that teaching the class at\nSRI-ARC tends to overlook\
    \ special problems of working through the\nNetwork and special interests of other\
    \ sites.\nThe people who conduct the class are experienced in working out\nprocedures\
    \ for using NLS in work environments.  Therefore, please accept\nthe outline below\
    \ as a flexible one, one that can be tailored to fit\nparticular applications\
    \ or needs.\nPart I:  Elementary Concepts\n    1.  Introduction to NLS\n    2.\
