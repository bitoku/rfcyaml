- title: 1.  Introduction and Scope
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   This document updates RFC 2026 ([RFC2026], BCP\
    \ 9) to remove a limit\n   on the number of Area Directors who manage an Area\
    \ in the definition\n   of \"IETF Area\".  This document also updates RFC 2418\
    \ ([RFC2418], BCP\n   25) to reflect this updated definition.\n   The change described\
    \ in this document is intended to allow the IESG\n   additional flexibility in\
    \ organizing the IETF's work.  It does not\n   make any changes to the role of\
    \ an Area and does not argue that\n   assigning more than two Area Directors to\
    \ an Area is an optimal\n   solution in the long run.  In particular, this change\
    \ is not intended\n   to increase the size of the IESG significantly.  If several\
    \ Areas\n   will require more than two Area Directors, the IESG should consider\n\
    \   investigating alternative ways of organizing the IETF's work.\n"
- title: 2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "2.  Discussion\n   In recent discussions, the IESG has explored splitting and\
    \ combining\n   Areas.  One proposal resulted in a single Area that would be managed\n\
    \   by three Area Directors.\n   An Area managed by three Area Directors conflicts\
    \ with this\n   definition in Section 14, \"DEFINITIONS OF TERMS\" of RFC 2026\n\
    \   ([RFC2026]):\n      IETF Area - A management division within the IETF.  An\
    \ Area\n      consists of Working Groups related to a general topic such as\n\
    \      routing.  An Area is managed by one or two Area Directors.\n   A similar\
    \ statement appears in Section 1, \"Introduction\" of RFC 2418\n   ([RFC2418]):\n\
    \      Each IETF area is managed by one or two Area Directors (ADs).\n   While\
    \ it's true that recent IESGs have had two Area Directors in each\n   Area except\
    \ for the General Area, the number of Area Directors in\n   each Area has varied\
    \ since the publication of RFC 1396 ([RFC1396]).\n   (For reference, see <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/past-members.html>.)\n\
    \   This variation was due to a number of factors, including workload and\n  \
    \ personal preferences, and happened as a natural part of the IESG\n   organizing\
    \ itself to do the work the IESG is chartered to do.\n   At one point, the IESG\
    \ placed three Area Directors in a single Area\n   (Scott Bradner, Deirdre Kostick,\
    \ and Michael O'Dell, in the\n   Operational & Management Requirements Area, between\
    \ IETF 36 and IETF\n   37 in 1996).\n   The last time the IESG increased the number\
    \ of Area Directors in an\n   Area was when they requested that the Nominating\
    \ Committee provide a\n   second Area Director in the Routing Area in 1999.  Although\
    \ the\n   number of Area Directors in an Area hasn't changed since then, the\n\
    \   IESG continues to be responsible for specifying the positions that\n   the\
    \ Nominating Committee fills each year.\n   It is consistent with the IESG's role\
    \ in creating and dismantling\n   entire Areas to allow the IESG flexibility in\
    \ assigning enough Area\n   Directors who have been selected by the Nominating\
    \ Committee to\n   effectively manage the working groups within an Area.\n   Note\
    \ the requirement in RFC 7437 ([RFC7437], BCP 10) that the\n   Nominating Committee\
    \ review (approximately) half the positions for\n   the IESG each year is unchanged.\
    \  The Nominating Committee may assign\n   an appropriate term duration for each\
    \ position to ensure the ideal\n   application of this rule in the future, and\
    \ this is also unchanged.\n"
