  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) (Extended) ASSOCIATION\n
    \  Object is specified in [RFC6780] and can be used generically to\n   associate
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS\n   (GMPLS) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n   [RFC7551] defines mechanisms
    for binding two point-to-point (P2P)\n   unidirectional LSPs [RFC3209] into an
    associated bidirectional LSP.\n   There are two models described in [RFC7551]
    for provisioning an\n   associated bidirectional LSP: single-sided and double-sided.
    \ In both\n   models, the reverse LSP of the bidirectional LSP may or may not
    be\n   co-routed and follow the same path as its forward LSP.\n   In some packet
    transport networks, there are requirements where the\n   reverse LSP of a bidirectional
    LSP needs to follow the same path as\n   its forward LSP [RFC6373].  The MPLS
    Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\n   [RFC6370] architecture facilitates the co-routed
    bidirectional LSP by\n   using GMPLS extensions [RFC3473] to achieve congruent
    paths.\n   However, RSVP association signaling allows enabling co-routed\n   bidirectional
    LSPs without having to deploy GMPLS extensions in the\n   existing networks.  The
    association signaling also allows taking\n   advantage of the existing TE and
    fast reroute mechanisms in the\n   network.\n   [RFC4090] defines fast reroute
    extensions for RSVP-TE LSPs, which are\n   also applicable to the associated bidirectional
    LSPs.  [RFC8271]\n   defines fast reroute procedures for GMPLS signaled bidirectional
    LSPs\n   such as coordinating bypass tunnel assignments in the forward and\n   reverse
    directions of the LSP.  The mechanisms defined in [RFC8271]\n   are also useful
    for the fast reroute of associated bidirectional\n   LSPs.\n   This document updates
    the fast reroute procedures defined in\n   [RFC4090] to support both single-sided
    and double-sided provisioned\n   associated bidirectional LSPs.  This document
    also updates the\n   procedure for associating two reverse LSPs defined in [RFC7551]
    to\n   support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The fast reroute procedures\n   can
    ensure that for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed\n   paths in the
    forward and reverse directions after fast reroute.\n"

      apply to this document:\n   o  The fast reroute procedure for the unidirectional
      LSPs is defined\n      in [RFC4090] and is not modified by this document.\n
      \  o  The fast reroute procedure when using unidirectional bypass\n      tunnels
      is defined in [RFC4090] and is not modified by this\n      document.\n   o  This

      associated bidirectional LSPs are also associated\n      bidirectional.\n   o
      \ This document assumes that the fast reroute bypass tunnels used\n      for
      protected co-routed associated bidirectional LSPs are also co-\n      routed

      of the forward LSP matches the upstream MP and PLR pair\n      of the reverse
