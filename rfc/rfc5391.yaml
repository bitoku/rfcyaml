- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   G.711.1 is a G.711 embedded wideband speech and audio coding\n\
    \   algorithm operating at 64, 80, and 96 kbps.  At 64 kbps, G.711.1 is\n   fully\
    \ interoperable with G.711.  Hence, an efficient deployment in\n   existing G.711-based\
    \ Voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructures is\n   foreseen.\n   The codec operates\
    \ on 5-ms frames, and the default sampling rate is\n   16 kHz.  Input and output\
    \ at 8 kHz are also supported for narrowband\n   modes.\n   The encoder produces\
    \ an embedded bitstream structured in three layers\n   corresponding to three\
    \ available bit rates: 64, 80, and 96 kbps.  The\n   bitstream can be truncated\
    \ at the decoder side or by any component of\n   the communication system to adjust,\
    \ \"on the fly\", the bit rate to the\n   desired value.\n   The following table\
    \ gives more details on these layers.\n               +-------+------------------------+----------+\n\

- title: 3.  RTP Header Usage
  contents:
  - "3.  RTP Header Usage\n   The format of the RTP header is specified in [RFC3550].\
    \  The payload\n   format defined in this document uses the fields of the header\
    \ in a\n   manner consistent with that specification.\n   marker (M):\n      G.711.1\
    \ does not define anything specific regarding Discontinuous\n      Transmission\
    \ (DTX), a.k.a. silence suppression.  Codec-independent\n      mechanisms may\
    \ be used, like the generic comfort-noise payload\n      format defined in [RFC3389].\n\
    \      For applications that send either no packets or occasional\n      comfort-noise\
    \ packets during silence, the first packet of a\n      talkspurt -- that is, the\
    \ first packet after a silence period\n      during which packets have not been\
    \ transmitted contiguously --\n      SHOULD be distinguished by setting the marker\
    \ bit in the RTP data\n      header to one.  The marker bit in all other packets\
    \ is zero.  The\n      beginning of a talkspurt MAY be used to adjust the playout\
    \ delay\n      to reflect changing network delays.  Applications without silence\n\
    \      suppression MUST set the marker bit to zero.\n   payload type (PT):\n \
    \     The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is\n      outside\
    \ the scope of this document, and will not be specified\n      here.  It is expected\
    \ that the RTP profile under which this\n      payload format is being used will\
    \ assign a payload type for this\n      codec or specify that the payload type\
    \ is to be bound dynamically\n      (see Section 5.3).\n   timestamp:\n      The\
    \ RTP timestamp clock frequency is the same as the default\n      sampling frequency:\
    \ 16 kHz.\n      G.711.1 has also the capability to operate with 8-kHz sampled\n\
    \      input/output signals.  It does not affect the bitstream, and the\n    \
    \  decoder does not require a priori knowledge about the sampling\n      rate\
    \ of the original signal at the input of the encoder.\n      Therefore, depending\
    \ on the implementation and the audio acoustic\n      capabilities of the devices,\
    \ the input of the encoder and/or the\n      output of the decoder can be configured\
    \ at 8 kHz; however, a\n      16-kHz RTP clock rate MUST always be used.\n   \
    \   The duration of one frame is 5 ms, corresponding to 80 samples at\n      16\
    \ kHz.  Thus, the timestamp is increased by 80 for each\n      consecutive frame.\n"
- title: 4.  Payload Format
  contents:
  - "4.  Payload Format\n   The complete payload consists of a payload header of 1\
    \ octet,\n   followed by one or more consecutive G.711.1 audio frames of the same\n\
    \   mode.\n   The mode may change between packets, but not within a packet.\n"

  - "4.2.  Audio Data\n   After this payload header, the consecutive audio frames\

    \   The size of one frame is given by the mode, as per Table 3, and the\n   actual\
    \ number of frames is easy to infer from the size of the audio\n   data part:\n\
    \      nb_frames = (size_of_audio_data) / (size_of_one_frame).\n   Only full frames\
    \ must be considered.  So if there is a remainder to\n   the division above, the\

- title: 5.  Payload Format Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.  Payload Format Parameters\n   This section defines the parameters that may\
    \ be used to configure\n   optional features in the G.711.1 RTP transmission.\n\
    \   Both A-law and mu-law G.711 are supported in the core layer L0, but\n   there\
    \ is no interoperability between A-law and mu-law.  So two media\n   types with\
    \ the same parameters will be defined: audio/PCMA-WB for\n   A-law core, and audio/PCMU-WB\
    \ for mu-law core.  This is consistent\n   with the audio/PCMA and audio/PCMU\
    \ media types separation for G.711\n   audio.\n   The parameters are defined here\
    \ as part of the media subtype\n   registrations for the G.711.1 codec.  A mapping\
    \ of the parameters\n   into the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]\
    \ is also\n   provided for those applications that use SDP.  In control protocols\n\

    \ SHOULD\n      announce G.711 support in its \"m=audio\" line, with G.711.1\n\
    \      preferred.  This will allow interoperability with both G.711.1 and\n  \

    \ subtype in addition to PCMA-WB, and/or PCMU in addition to\n      PCMU-WB.\n\
    \      Below is an example part of such an offer, for A-law:\n         m=audio\
    \ 54874 RTP/AVP 96 8\n         a=rtpmap:96 PCMA-WB/16000\n         a=rtpmap:8\

    \ i.e., the restricted\n      mode-set applies to media both to be received and\

    \ the\n      answerer MUST return either the same mode-set or a subset of this\n\
    \      mode-set.  The answerer MAY change the preference order.  If no\n     \
    \ mode-set was supplied in the offer, the anwerer MAY return a mode-\n      set\
    \ to restrict the possible modes.  In any case, the mode-set in\n      the answer\
    \ then applies for both offerer and answerer.  The\n      offerer MUST NOT send\

  contents:
  - "6.  G.711 Interoperability\n   The L0 layer of G.711.1 is fully interoperable\
    \ with G.711, and is\n   embedded in all modes of G.711.1.  This provides an easy\
    \ G.711.1 -\n   G.711 transcoding process.\n   A gateway or any other network\
    \ device receiving a G.711.1 packet can\n   easily extract a G.711-compatible\
    \ payload, without the need to decode\n   and re-encode the audio signal.  It\
    \ simply has to take the audio data\n   of the payload, and strip the upper layers\
    \ (L1 and/or L2), if any.\n   If a G.711.1 packet contains several frames, the\
    \ concatenation of the\n   L0 layers of each frame will form a G.711-compatible\
    \ payload.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Congestion Control\n   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance\
    \ with [RFC3550]\n   and any appropriate profile (for example, [RFC3551]).\n \
    \  The embedded nature of G.711.1 audio data can be helpful for\n   congestion\
    \ control, since a coding mode with a lower bit rate can be\n   selected when\
    \ needed.  This property is usable only when multiple\n   modes have been negotiated\
    \ (either no \"mode-set\" parameter in the SDP\n   or a \"mode-set\" with at least\
    \ two modes).\n   The number of frames encapsulated in each RTP payload influences\
    \ the\n   overall bandwidth of the RTP stream, due to the header overhead.\n \
    \  Packing more frames in each RTP payload can reduce the number of\n   packets\
    \ sent and hence the header overhead, at the expense of\n   increased delay and\
    \ reduced error robustness.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined\
    \ in this specification\n   are subject to the general security considerations\
    \ discussed in the\n   RTP specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate profile\
    \ (for example,\n   [RFC3551]).\n   As this format transports encoded speech/audio,\
    \ the main security\n   issues include confidentiality, integrity protection,\
    \ and\n   authentication of the speech/audio itself.  The payload format itself\n\
    \   does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  Any suitable\n   external\
    \ mechanisms, such as the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol\n   (SRTP) [RFC3711],\
    \ MAY be used.\n   This payload format and the G.711.1 encoding do not exhibit\
    \ any\n   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-end computational load,\n\
    \   and thus they are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to\n   the\
    \ receipt of pathological datagrams.  In addition, they do not\n   contain any\
    \ type of active content such as scripts.\n"
