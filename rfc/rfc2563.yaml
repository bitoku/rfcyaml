  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Operating Systems are now attempting to support ad-hoc networks\
    \ of\n   two or more systems, while keeping user configuration at a minimum.\n\
    \   To accommodate this, in the absence of a central configuration\n   mechanism\
    \ (DHCP), some OS's are automatically choosing a link-local\n   IP address which\
    \ will allow them to communicate only with other hosts\n   on the same link. \
    \ This address will not allow the OS to communicate\n   with anything beyond a\
    \ router.  However, some sites depend on the\n   fact that a host with no DHCP\
    \ response will have no IP address.  This\n   document describes a mechanism by\
    \ which DHCP servers are able to tell\n   clients that they do not have an IP\
    \ address to offer, and that the\n   client should not generate an IP address\
    \ it's own.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   With computers becoming a larger part of everyday life,\
    \ operating\n   systems must be able to support a larger range of operating\n\
    \   environments.  One aspect of this support is the selection of an IP\n   address.\
    \  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP] provides a\n   superb method\
    \ by which site administrators may supply IP addresses\n   (and other network\
    \ parameters) to network devices.  However, some\n   operating environments are\
    \ not centrally maintained, and operating\n   systems must now be able to handle\
    \ this quickly and easily.\n   IPv6 accounts for this, and allows an IPv6 stack\
    \ to assign itself a\n   global address in the absence of any other mechanism\
    \ for\n   configuration [IPv6SAC].  However, Operating System designers can't\n\
    \   wait for IPv6 support everywhere.  They need to be able to assume\n   they\
    \ will have IPv4 addresses, so that they may communicate with one\n   another\
    \ even in the smallest networks.\n   This document looks at three types of network\
    \ nodes, and how IPv4\n   address auto-configuration may be disabled on a per-subnet\
    \ (or even\n   per-node) basis.  The three types of network nodes are:\n   * A\
    \ node for which the site administrator will hand out configuration\n     information,\n\
    \   * A node on a network segment for which there is no site\n     administrator,\
    \ and\n   * A node on a network segment that has a central site administrator,\n\
    \     and that administrator chooses not to hand out any configuration\n     information\
    \ to the node.\n   The difference between the second and third cases is the clients\n\
    \   behavior.\n   In one case, the node may assign itself an IP address, and have\
    \ full\n   connectivity with other nodes on the local wire.  In the last case,\n\
    \   the node is not told what to do, and while it may assign itself a\n   network\
    \ address in the same way as case #2, this may not be what the\n   central administrator\
    \ wants.\n   The first scenario is handled by the current DHCP standard.  However,\n\
    \   the current DHCP specification [DHCP] says servers must silently\n   ignore\
    \ requests from hosts they do not know.  Because of this, DHCP\n   clients are\
    \ unable to determine whether they are on a subnet with no\n   administration,\
    \ or with administration that is choosing not to hand\n   out addresses.\n   This\
    \ document describes a method by which DHCP clients will be able\n   to determine\
    \ whether or not the network is being centrally\n   administrated, allowing it\
    \ to intelligently determine whether or not\n   it should assign itself a \"link-local\"\
    \ address.\n"

  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   DHCP client    A DHCP client is an Internet host using\
    \ DHCP to obtain\n                  configuration parameters such as a network\
    \ address.\n   DHCP server    A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns\n\

- title: 2.  The Auto-Configure Option
  contents:
  - "2.  The Auto-Configure Option\n   This option code is used to ask whether, and\
    \ be notified if, auto-\n   configuration should be disabled on the local subnet.\
    \  The auto-\n   configure option is an 8-bit number.\n        Code   Len   Value\n\
    \       +-----+-----+-----+\n       | 116 |  1  |  a  |\n       +-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \   The code for this option is 116, and its length is 1.\n   This code, along\
    \ with the IP address assignment, will allow a DHCP\n   client to determine whether\
    \ or not it should generate a link-local IP\n   address.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Auto-Configure Values
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Auto-Configure Values\n   The auto-configure option uses the following\
    \ values:\n            DoNotAutoConfigure     0\n            AutoConfigure   \
    \       1\n   When a server responds with the value \"AutoConfigure\", the client\
    \ MAY\n   generate a link-local IP address if appropriate.  However, if the\n\
    \   server responds with \"DoNotAutoConfigure\", the client MUST NOT\n   generate\
    \ a link-local IP address, possibly leaving it with no IP\n   address.\n"
- title: 2.2.  DHCP Client Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.2.  DHCP Client Behavior\n   Clients that have auto-configuration capabilities\
    \ MUST add the Auto-\n   Configure option to the list of options included in its\
    \ initial\n   DHCPDISCOVER message.  ([DHCP] Section 4.4.1)  At this time, the\n\
    \   option's value should be set to \"AutoConfigure\".\n   When a DHCPOFFER is\
    \ received, it is handled as described in [DHCP],\n   section 4.4.1, with one\
    \ exception.  If the 'yiaddr' field is\n   0x00000000, the Auto-Configure option\
    \ must be consulted.  If this\n   option is set to \"AutoConfigure\", then the\
    \ DHCPOFFER MUST be ignored,\n   and the DHCP client MAY generate a link-local\
    \ IP address.  However,\n   if this option is set to \"DoNotAutoConfigure\", then\
    \ the DHCPOFFER\n   MUST be ignored, and the client MUST NOT generate a link-local\
    \ IP\n   address.\n   If a DHCP client receives any DHCPOFFER which contains a\
    \ 'yiaddr' of\n   0x00000000, and the Auto-Configure flag says \"DoNotAutoConfigure\"\
    , in\n   the absence of a DHCPOFFER with a valid 'yiaddr', the DHCP client\n \
    \  MUST NOT generate a link-local IP address.  The amount of time a DHCP\n   client\
    \ waits to collect any other DHCPOFFERs is implementation\n   dependant.\n   DHCPOFFERs\
    \ with a 'yiaddr' of 0x00000000 will only be sent by DHCP\n   servers supporting\
    \ the Auto-Configure option when the DHCPDISCOVER\n   contained the Auto-Configure\
    \ option.  Since the DHCPDISCOVER will\n   only contain the Auto-Configure option\
    \ when a DHCP client knows how\n   to handle it, there will be no inter-operability\
    \ problems.\n   If the DHCP server does have an address to offer, the message\
    \ states\n   are the same as those described in [DHCP], section 3.\n   The following\
    \ depicts the difference in responses for non-registered\n   DHCP clients that\
    \ support the \"Auto-Configure\" option on networks\n   that have DHCP servers\
    \ that support auto-configuration and networks\n   with DHCP servers that do not.\n\

  contents:
  - "2.3.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   When a DHCP server receives a DHCPDISCOVER, it\
    \ MUST be processed as\n   described in [DHCP], section 4.3.1.  However, if no\
    \ address is chosen\n   for the host, a few additional steps MUST be taken.\n\
    \   If the DHCPDISCOVER does not contain the Auto-Configure option, it is\n  \
    \ not answered.\n   If the DHCPDISCOVER contains the Auto-Configure option, and\
    \ the site\n   administrator has specified that Auto-Configuration should be\n\
    \   disabled on the subnet the DHCPDISCOVER is originating from, or for\n   the\
    \ client originating the request, then a DHCPOFFER MUST be sent to\n   the DHCP\
    \ client.  This offer MUST be for the address 0x00000000, and\n   the Auto-Configure\
    \ option MUST be set to \"DoNotAutoConfigure\".\n   If the site administrator\
    \ allows auto-configuration on the\n   originating subnet, the DHCPDISCOVER is\
    \ not answered as before.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Mixed Environments\n   Environments containing a mixture of clients and\
    \ servers that do and\n   do not support the Auto-Configure option will not be\
    \ a problem.\n   Every DHCP transaction is between a Server and a Client, and\
    \ the\n   possible mixed scenarios between these two are listed below.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Client Supports, Server Does Not
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Client Supports, Server Does Not\n   If a DHCP client sends a request\
    \ that contains the Auto-Configure\n   tag, a DHCP server that does not know what\
    \ this tag is will respond\n   normally.  According to [DHCP] Section 4.3.1, the\
    \ server MUST NOT\n   return a value for that parameter.\n   In this case, the\
    \ server will either respond with a valid DHCPOFFER,\n   or it will not respond\
    \ at all.  In both cases, a DHCP client that\n   supports this option will never\
    \ care what the state of the option is,\n   and may auto-configure.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Servers Supports, Client Does Not
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Servers Supports, Client Does Not\n   If the Auto-Configure option is\
    \ not present in the DHCPDISCOVER, the\n   server will do nothing about it.  The\
    \ client will auto-configure if\n   it doesn't receive a response and believes\
    \ that's what it should do.\n   This scenario SHOULD not occur, as any stacks\
    \ that implement an\n   auto-configuration mechanism MUST implement this option\
    \ as well.\n"

  - "2.5.  Interaction With Other DHCP Messages\n   As this option only affects the\
    \ initial IP address selection, it does\n   not apply to subsequent DHCP messages.\
    \  If the DHCP client received a\n   lease from a DHCP server, future DHCP messages\
    \ (RENEW, INFORM, ACK,\n   etc.) have no need to fall over into an auto- configuration\
    \ state.\n   If the DHCP client's lease expires, the client falls back into the\n\
    \   INIT state, and the initial DHCPDISCOVER is sent as before.\n"

    \ section 4.4.6.\n   When a DHCP client is done with a lease, it MAY notify the\
    \ server\n   that it is finished.  For this to occur, the DHCP client already\n\
    \   received a DHCP lease, and the state of Auto-Configuration on the\n   local\
    \ wire does not matter.\n"

    \   This option is defined in [DHCPOPT], Section 9.9.\n   If the DHCP client receives\
    \ a response with the Message option set,\n   it MUST provide this information\

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   DHCP per se currently provides no authentication\
    \ or security\n   mechanisms.  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in\
    \ section 7\n   of the DHCP protocol specification [DHCP].\n   This mechanism\
    \ does add one other potential attack.  Malicious users\n   on a subnet may respond\
    \ to all DHCP requests with responses telling\n   DHCP clients that they should\
    \ NOT auto-configure on the local wire.\n   On a network where Auto-Configuration\
    \ is required, this will cause\n   all DHCP clients to not choose an address.\n"

    \ Microsoft\n   meeting at Microsoft in May, 1998.  The IP stacks in Win98 and\

    \ that actually rely on machines not getting IP addresses when\n   the DHCP servers\
    \ do not know them.\n   Walter Wong proposed a solution that would allow the DHCP\
