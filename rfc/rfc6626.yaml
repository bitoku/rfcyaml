    to Mobile\n   IPv4 [RFC5944] for mobile networks.  This specification adds support\n
    \  for dynamic allocation of mobile prefixes by the home agent.\n"

  - "3.  Dynamic Mobile Prefix Allocation\n   The following extension is defined according
    to this specification.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Mobile Client Considerations\n   According to this specification, the
      Prefix field of the Mobile\n   Network Request extension MUST be set to zero
      to indicate that the\n   Mobile Router requests mobile network prefix(es) be
      assigned to it by\n   the home agent.  In this case, the Mobile Router MAY set
      the prefix\n   length field of such extensions to zero or to a length of its
      choice\n   as a hint to the home agent.  According to this specification, Mobile\n
      \  Network Request extensions with the Prefix field set to zero MAY be\n   included
      in a registration request message either during initial\n   registration or
      during a subsequent registration.\n   When a Mobile Router receives a registration
      reply, it MUST process\n   it as defined in Mobile IPv4 [RFC5944] and [RFC5177].
      \ If one or more\n   network acknowledgement extensions are included with the
      Code field\n   set to \"Success\", the Mobile Router SHOULD treat the prefixes
      in the\n   corresponding Prefix fields as allocated prefixes and create the\n
      \  appropriate bindings as defined in [RFC5177].\n   In response to a registration
      request with a Mobile Network Request\n   extension with the Prefix field set
      to zero, if a Mobile Router\n   receives a registration reply with a network
      acknowledgement\n   extension including Code field set to 1 \"invalid prefix\",
      it may use\n   it as a hint that the home agent does not support dynamic prefix\n
      \  allocation.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Home Agent Considerations\n   A home agent receiving a Mobile Network
      Request extension with the\n   Prefix field set to zero MAY return a Mobile
      Network Acknowledgement\n   extension [RFC5177] with the Prefix field set to
      the prefix allocated\n   to the Mobile Router.  The length of that prefix is
      at the discretion\n   of the home agent.  The home agent MAY take into account
      the prefix\n   length hint if one is included in the Mobile Network Request\n
      \  extension.  Once the home agent allocates a prefix, it MUST maintain\n   the
      prefix registration table as defined in [RFC5177].\n   Alternatively, the home
      agent MAY return a Mobile Network\n   Acknowledgement extension with the Code
      field set to one of the\n   negative codes defined in [RFC5177].\n   Dynamic
      mobile prefix allocation, as defined in this specification,\n   MAY be combined
      with dynamic home address allocation, as defined in\n   [RFC5177].  In other
      words, the home address field of the\n   registration request message MAY be
      set to zero while the message\n   also includes one or more Mobile Network Request
      extensions with the\n   Prefix field also set to zero.\n   Once the home agent
      allocates a prefix, it MUST maintain the prefix\n   registration table as defined
      in [RFC5177].  The lifetime of the\n   allocated prefix will be equal to the
      lifetime of the binding cache\n   entry.  The Mobile Router may request for
      multiple mobile network\n   prefixes to be assigned by the home agent.  For
      a Mobile Network\n   Prefix for which the assignment was unsuccessful, the Code
      field in\n   the corresponding Mobile Network Acknowledgement extension should
      be\n   set to 4 (MOBNET_UNASSIGNED).\n   For dynamic prefix allocation, the
      Mobile Router's home address MAY\n   be used to identify the client if it is
      not set to zero.  Otherwise,\n   as defined in the Network Access Identifier
      (NAI) extension [RFC2794]\n   of Mobile IPv4 [RFC2794], the NAI extension needs
      to be included in\n   the registration request, in which case the same extension
      SHOULD be\n   used to identify the Mobile Router for prefix allocation purposes.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This specification operates in the security constraints
    and\n   requirements of Mobile IPv4 [RFC5944], NAI [RFC2794], and [RFC5177].\n
    \  Home agent implementations SHOULD take steps to prevent address\n   exhaustion
    attacks.  One way to limit the effectiveness of such an\n   attack is to limit
    the number and size of prefixes any one Mobile\n   Router can be allocated.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   A new value has been assigned in the Mobile Network
