  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In MPLS and MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environments, statically\n\
    \   provisioned Single-Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against\n  \
    \ tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.\n   With\
    \ statically provisioned Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each\n   segment\
    \ of the MS-PW is likewise protected from tunnel failures via\n   MPLS-level and\
    \ MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  However, static MS-\n   PWs are not protected\
    \ end-to-end against failure of one of the\n   Switching Provider Edge Routers\
    \ (S-PEs) along the path of the MS-PW.\n   This document describes how to achieve\
    \ this protection via redundant\n   MS-PWs by updating the existing procedures\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In MPLS and MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Packet Switched\
    \ Networks\n   (PSNs), pseudowires (PWs) are transported by MPLS(-TP) Label Switched\n\
    \   Paths (LSPs), also known as tunnels.\n   As described in RFC 5659 [RFC5659],\
    \ Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-\n   PWs) consist of Terminating Provider Edge\
    \ Routers PEs (T-PEs), one or\n   more Switching Provider Edge Routers (S-PEs),\
    \ and a sequence of\n   tunneled PW segments that connects one of the T-PEs with\
    \ its\n   \"adjacent\" S-PE, connects this S-PE with the next S-PE in the\n  \
    \ sequence, and so on until the last S-PE is connected by the last PW\n   segment\
    \ to the remaining T-PE.  In MPLS and MPLS-TP environments,\n   statically provisioned\
    \ Single-Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are\n   protected against tunnel failure\
    \ via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level\n   tunnel protection.  With statically provisioned\
    \ Multi-Segment\n   Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each PW segment of the MS-PW is likewise\n\
    \   protected from tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel\n  \
    \ protection.  However, tunnel protection does not protect static MS-\n   PWs\
    \ from failures of S-PEs along the path of the MS-PW.\n   RFC 6718 [RFC6718] provides\
    \ a general framework for PW protection,\n   and RFC 6870 [RFC6870], which is\
    \ based upon that framework, describes\n   protection procedures for MS-PWs that\
    \ are dynamically signaled using\n   LDP.  This document describes how to achieve\
    \ protection against S-PE\n   failure in a static MS-PW by extending RFC 6870\
    \ to be applicable for\n   statically provisioned MS-PWs pseudowires (PWs) as\
    \ well.\n   This document also contains an OPTIONAL alternative approach based\
    \ on\n   MPLS-TP Linear Protection.  This approach, described in Appendix A,\n\
    \   MUST be identically provisioned in the PE endpoints for the protected\n  \
    \ MS-PW in order to be used.  See Appendix A for further details on\n   this alternative\
    \ approach.\n   This document differs from [PW-REDUNDANCY] in that it provides\
    \ end-\n   to-end resiliency for static MS-PWs, whereas [PW-REDUNDANCY] provides\n\
    \   resiliency at intermediate S-PEs and resiliency for both dynamically\n   signaled\
    \ and static MS-PWs.\n   PWs based on the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3\
    \ (L2TPv3) are\n   outside the scope of this document.\n"

    \ CE with Redundant MS-PWs\n   In this figure, Customer Edge Router 1 (CE1) is\
    \ connected to T-PE1,\n   and CE2 is connected to T-PE2 via Attachment Circuits\
    \ (ACs).  There\n   are three MS-PWs.  PW1 is switched at S-PE1, PW2 is switched\
    \ at\n   S-PE2, and PW3 is switched at S-PE3.  This scenario provides N:1\n  \
    \ protection against S-PE failure for the subset of the path of the\n   emulated\
    \ service from T-PE1 to T-PE2.\n   The procedures in RFCs 6718 and 6870 rely on\
    \ LDP-based PW status\n   signaling to signal the state of the primary MS-PW that\
    \ is being\n   protected, and the precedence in which redundant MS-PW(s) should\
    \ be\n   used to protect the primary MS-PW should it fail.  These procedures\n\
    \   make use of information carried by the PW Status TLV, which, for\n   dynamically\
    \ signaled PWs, is carried by the LDP.\n   However, statically provisioned PWs\
    \ (SS-PWs or MS-PWs) do not use the\n   LDP for PW setup and signaling; rather,\
    \ they are provisioned by\n   network management systems or other means at each\
    \ T-PE and S-PE along\n   their paths.  They also do not use the LDP for status\
    \ signaling.\n   Rather, they use procedures defined in RFC 6478 [RFC6478] for\
    \ status\n   signaling via the PW Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n\
    \   (OAM) message using the PW Associated Channel Header (ACH).  The PW\n   Status\
    \ TLV carried via this status signaling is itself identical to\n   the PW Status\
    \ TLV carried via LDP-based status signaling, including\n   the identical PW Status\
    \ Codes.\n   Sections 6 and 7 of RFC 6870 describe the management of a primary\
    \ PW\n   and its secondary PW(s) to provide resiliency to the failure of the\n\
    \   primary PW.  They use status codes transmitted between endpoint T-PEs\n  \
    \ using the PW Status TLV transmitted by LDP.  For this management to\n   apply\
    \ to statically provisioned PWs, the PW status signaling defined\n   in RFC 6478\
    \ MUST be used for the primary and secondary PWs.  In that\n   case, the endpoint\
    \ T-PEs can then use the PW status signaling\n   provided by RFC 6478 in place\
    \ of LDP-based status signaling, so that\n   the status-signaling-based procedures\
    \ in RFC 6870 operate identically\n   to when used with LDP-based status signaling.\
    \  Note that the optional\n   S-PE Bypass Mode defined in Section 5.5 of RFC 6478\
    \ cannot be used,\n   as it requires LDP signaling.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Operational Considerations\n   Because LDP is not used between the T-PEs\

    \ the endpoint\n   T-PEs are identically provisioned regarding the use of this\
    \ document,\n   specifically whether or not MS-PW redundancy is being used, and\

- title: A.2.  Encapsulation of the PSC Protocol for Pseudowires
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Encapsulation of the PSC Protocol for Pseudowires\n   The PSC protocol\
    \ can be used to protect against defects on any LSP\n   (segment, link, or path).\
    \  In the case of MS-PW, the PSC protocol can\n   also protect failed intermediate\
    \ nodes (S-PE).  Linear protection\n   protects an LSP or PW end-to-end and if\
    \ a failure is detected,\n   switches traffic over to another (redundant) set\
    \ of resources.\n   Obviously, the protected entity does not need to be of the\
    \ same type\n   as the protecting entity.  For example, it is possible to protect\
    \ a\n   link by a path.  Likewise, it is possible to protect an SS-PW with an\n\
    \   MS-PW, and vice versa.\n   From a PSC protocol point of view, it is possible\
    \ to view an SS-PW as\n   a single-hop LSP and an MS-PW as a multiple-hop LSP.\
    \  Thus, this\n   provides end-to-end protection for the SS-PW or MS-PW.  The\
    \ Generic\n   Associated Channel (G-Ach) carrying the PSC protocol information\
    \ is\n   placed in the label stack directly beneath the PW identifier.  The\n\
    \   PSC protocol will then work as specified in RFCs 6378, 7271, and\n   7324.\n"
