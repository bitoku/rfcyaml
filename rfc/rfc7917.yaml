    to\n   advertise node administrative tags.  This optional capability allows\n
    \  tagging and grouping of the nodes in an IS-IS domain.  The node\n   administrative
    tags can be used to express and apply locally defined\n   network policies, thereby
    providing a very useful operational\n   capability.  Node administrative tags
    may be used by either IS-IS\n   itself or other applications consuming information
    propagated via IS-\n   IS.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is useful to assign a node administrative tag to a router
    in the\n   IS-IS domain and use it as an attribute associated with the node.\n
    \  The node administrative tag can be used in variety of applications.\n   For
    example:\n   (a)  Traffic-engineering applications to provide different\n        path-selection
    criteria.\n   (b)  Preference for, or pruning of, certain paths in Loop-Free\n
    \       Alternate (LFA) [RFC5286] backup selection via local policies as\n        defined
    in [RFC7916].\n   This document provides mechanisms to advertise node administrative\n
    \  tags in IS-IS for various applications, including (but not limited\n   to)
    route and path selection.  Route and path selection functionality\n   applies
    to both Traffic Engineering (TE) and non-TE applications.\n   Hence, the new sub-TLV
    for carrying node administrative tags is\n   included in the Router CAPABILITY
    TLV [RFC4971].\n"

    value that can be\n   used to identify a group of nodes in the IS-IS domain.  An
    IS-IS\n   router should advertise in the specific IS-IS level the set of groups\n
    \  of which it is a part.\n   As an example, all edge network devices in a given
    network may be\n   configured with a certain tag value, whereas all core network
    devices\n   may be configured with another, different tag value.\n"

  - "3.  Node Administrative Tag (Node-Admin-Tag) Sub-TLV\n   The new sub-TLV defined
    in this document is carried within an IS-IS\n   Router CAPABILITY TLV (IS-IS TLV
    type 242) [RFC4971] in the Link\n   State PDUs originated by the device.  Router
    CAPABILITY TLVs\n   [RFC4971] can have \"level-wide\" or \"domain-wide\" flooding
    scope.  The\n   choice of flooding scope in which a specific node administrative
    tag\n   shall be flooded is purely a matter of local policy and is defined by\n
    \  the operator's usage needs.  An operator MAY choose to advertise a\n   set
    of node administrative tags across levels and another different\n   set of node
    administrative tags within the specific level.\n   Alternatively, the operator
    may use the same node administrative tags\n   within both the \"domain-wide\"
    flooding scope and one or more\n   \"level-wide\" flooding scopes.\n   The format
    of the Node Administrative Tag (Node-Admin-Tag) sub-TLV\n   (see Section 3.1)
    does not include a topology identifier.  Therefore,\n   it is not possible to
    indicate a topology-specific context when\n   advertising node administrative
    tags.  Hence, in deployments using\n   multi-topology routing [RFC5120], advertising
    a separate set of node\n   administrative tags for each topology SHOULD NOT be
    supported.\n"

    - "4.1.  Interpretation of Node Administrative Tags\n   The meaning of node administrative
      tags is generally opaque to IS-IS.\n   A router advertising one or more node
      administrative tags may be\n   configured to do so without knowing (or even
      explicitly supporting)\n   the functionality implied by the tag.  This section
      describes general\n   rules, regulations, and guidelines for using and interpreting
      a node\n   administrative tag; these rules, regulations, and guidelines will\n
      \  facilitate interoperable implementations between vendors.\n   Interpretation
      of tag values is specific to the administrative domain\n   of a particular network
      operator.  Hence, tag values SHOULD NOT be\n   propagated outside the administrative
      domain to which they apply.\n   The meaning of a node administrative tag is
      defined by the network\n   local policy and is controlled via configuration.
      \ If a receiving\n   node does not understand the tag value, it ignores the
      specific tag\n   and floods the Router CAPABILITY TLV without any change, as
      defined\n   in [RFC4971].\n   The semantics of the tag order has no meaning.
      \ There is no implied\n   meaning to the ordering of the tags that indicates
      a certain\n   operation or set of operations that need to be performed based
      on the\n   ordering.\n   Each tag SHOULD be treated as an independent identifier
      that may be\n   used in a policy to perform a policy action.  Each tag carried
      by the\n   Node-Admin-Tag sub-TLVs should be used to indicate a characteristic\n
      \  of a node that is independent of the characteristics indicated by\n   other
      administrative tags within the same instance or another\n   instance of a Node-Admin-Tag
      sub-TLV.  The list of node\n   administrative tags carried in a Node-Admin-Tag
      sub-TLV MUST be\n   considered as an unordered list.  Whilst policies may be
      implemented\n   based on the presence of multiple tags (e.g., if tag A AND tag
      B are\n   present), they MUST NOT be reliant upon the order of the tags (i.e.,\n
      \  all policies should be considered commutative operations, such that\n   tag
      A preceding or following tag B does not change their outcome).\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Use of Node Administrative Tags\n   The node administrative tags are
      not meant to be extended by future\n   IS-IS standards.  New IS-IS extensions
      are not expected to require\n   the use of node administrative tags or define
      well-known tag values.\n   Node administrative tags are for generic use and
      do not require IANA\n   registration.  Future IS-IS extensions requiring well-known
      values\n   MAY define their own data signaling tailored to the needs of the\n
      \  feature or MAY use the Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971].\n   Node
      administrative tags are expected to be associated with a stable\n   attribute.
      \ In particular, node administrative tags MUST NOT be\n   associated with something
      whose state can oscillate frequently, e.g.,\n   the reachability of a specific
      destination.\n   While no specific limit on the number of node administrative
      tags\n   that may be advertised has been defined, it is expected that only a\n
      \  modest number of tags will be required in any deployment.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.3.  Processing Node Administrative Tag Changes\n   Multiple Node-Admin-Tag
      sub-TLVs MAY appear in a Router CAPABILITY\n   TLV, or Node-Admin-Tag sub-TLVs
      MAY be contained in different\n   instances of Router CAPABILITY TLVs.  The
      node administrative tags\n   associated with a node that originates tags for
      the purpose of any\n   computation or processing at a receiving node SHOULD
      be a superset of\n   node administrative tags from all the TLVs in all the instances
      of\n   Router CAPABILITY TLVs received in the Link State PDU(s) advertised\n
      \  by the corresponding IS-IS router.  When a Router CAPABILITY TLV is\n   received
      that changes the set of node administrative tags applicable\n   to any originating
      node, a receiving node MUST repeat any computation\n   or processing that makes
      use of node administrative tags.\n   When there is a change to, or removal of,
      an administrative\n   affiliation of a node, the node MUST re-originate the
      Router\n   CAPABILITY TLV(s) with the latest set of node administrative tags.\n
      \  On a receiving router, on detecting a change in contents (or removal)\n   of
      existing Node-Admin-Tag sub-TLV(s) or the addition of new\n   Node-Admin-Tag
      sub-TLV(s) in any instance of Router CAPABILITY\n   TLV(s), implementations
      MUST take appropriate measures to update\n   their state according to the changed
      set of node administrative tags.\n   The exact actions needed will vary, depending
      on what features are\n   associated with node administrative tags; this topic
      is outside the\n   scope of this specification.\n"

  - "5.  Applications\n   [RFC7777] lists several non-normative examples of how implementations\n
    \  might use node administrative tags.  These examples are given only to\n   demonstrate
    the generic usefulness of the router tagging mechanism.\n   An implementation
    supporting this specification is not required to\n   implement any of the use
    cases.  The following is a brief list of\n   non-normative use cases listed in

    issues.  Node\n   administrative tags, like link administrative tags (a.k.a.\n
    \  administrative groups) [RFC5305], can be used by operators to\n   indicate
    geographical location or other sensitive information.  The\n   information carried
    in node administrative tags, like link\n   administrative tags, can be leaked
    to an IGP snooper.\n   Advertisement of tag values for one administrative domain
    into\n   another involves the risk of misinterpretation of the tag values (if\n
    \  the two domains have assigned different meanings to the same values)\n   and
    may have undesirable and unanticipated side effects.\n   Security concerns for
    IS-IS are already addressed in [ISO10589],\n   [RFC5304], and [RFC5310] and are
    applicable to the mechanisms\n   described in this document.  Extended authentication
    mechanisms\n   described in [RFC5304] or [RFC5310] SHOULD be used in deployments\n
    \  where attackers have access to the physical networks, because nodes\n   included
    in the IS-IS domain are vulnerable.\n"
  title: 6.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Operational Considerations\n   Operators can assign a meaning to the node
    administrative tags that\n   is local to the operator's administrative domain.
    \ The operational\n   use of node administrative tags is analogical to the IS-IS
    prefix\n   tags [RFC5130] and BGP communities [RFC1997].  Operational discipline\n
    \  and procedures followed in configuring and using BGP communities and\n   IS-IS
    prefix tags are also applicable to the usage of node\n   administrative tags.\n
    \  Defining a language for local policies is outside the scope of this\n   document.
    \ As is the case with other policy applications, the pruning\n   policies can
    cause the path to be completely removed from the\n   forwarding plane and hence
    have the potential for a more severe\n   impact on operations (e.g., node unreachability
    due to path removal)\n   as compared to preference policies that only affect path
    selection.\n"

    and managed using routing\n   policy enhancements.  YANG [RFC6020] is a data modeling
    language used\n   to specify configuration data models.  The IS-IS YANG data model
    is\n   described in [YANG-ISIS-CFG], and the routing policy configuration\n   model
    is described in [RTG-POLICY-MODEL].  At the time of writing\n   this document,
    some work to enhance these two other documents so that\n   they include configurations
    related to node administrative tags is\n   either already in progress or shall
