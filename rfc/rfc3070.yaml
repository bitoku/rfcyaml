  - "Abstract\n   Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) describes a mechanism to tunnel\n
    \  Point-to-Point (PPP) sessions.  The protocol has been designed to be\n   independent
    of the media it runs over.  The base specification\n   describes how it should
    be implemented to run over the User Datagram\n   Protocol (UDP) and the Internet
    Protocol (IP).  This document\n   describes how L2TP is implemented over Frame
    Relay Permanent Virtual\n   Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Applicability\n   This specification is intended for those implementations which
    desire\n   to use facilities which are defined for L2TP and  applies only to the\n
    \  use of Frame Relay pont-to-point circuits.\n"
  title: Applicability
- contents:
  - "1.0 Introduction\n   L2TP [1] defines a general purpose mechanism for tunneling
    PPP over\n   various media.  By design, it insulates L2TP operation from the\n
    \  details of the media over which it operates.  The base protocol\n   specification
    illustrates how L2TP may be used in IP environments.\n   This document specifies
    the encapsulation of L2TP over native Frame\n   Relay and addresses relevant issues.\n"

      the scope of the\n   problem being addressed.  Topology:\n         +------+

      LANs\n         | ISDN |           |     Cloud     |          |\n         +------+
      \          +---------------+          |\n   An L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC)
      is a device attached to the\n   switched network fabric (e.g., PSTN or ISDN)
      or co-located with a PPP\n   end system capable of handling the L2TP protocol.
      \ The LAC need only\n   implement the media over which L2TP is to operate to
      pass traffic to\n   one or more LNS's.  It may tunnel any protocol carried within
      PPP.\n   L2TP Network Server (LNS) operates on any platform capable of PPP\n
      \  termination.  The LNS handles the server side of the L2TP protocol.\n   L2TP
      is connection-oriented.  The LNS and LAC maintain state for each\n   user that
      is attached to an LAC.  A session is created when an end-\n   to-end PPP connection
      is attempted between a user and the LNS.  The\n   datagrams related to a session
      are sent over the tunnel between the\n   LAC and LNS.  A tunnel is defined by
      an LNS-LAC pair.  The tunnel\n   carries PPP datagrams between the LAC and the
      LNS.\n   L2TP protocol operates at a level above the particular media over\n
      \  which it is carried.  However, some details of its connection to\n   media
      are required to permit interoperable implementations.  L2TP\n   over IP/UDP
      is described in the base L2TP specification [1].  Issues\n   related to L2TP
      over Frame Relay are addressed in later sections of\n   this document.\n"

    - "4.0 Encapsulation and Packet Format\n   L2TP MUST be able to share a Frame
      Relay virtual circuit (VC) with\n   other protocols carried over the same VC.
      \ The Frame Relay header\n   format for data packet needs to be defined to identify
      the protocol\n   being carried in the packets.  The Frame Relay network may
      not\n   understand these formats.\n   All protocols over this circuit MUST encapsulate
      their packets within\n   a Q.922 frame.  Additionally, frames must contain information\n
      \  necessary to identify the protocol carried within the frame relay\n   Protocol
      Data Unit (PDU), thus allowing the receiver to properly\n   process the incoming
      packet.\n   The frame format for L2TP MUST be SNAP encapsulation as defined
      in\n   RFC 1490 [6] and FRF3.1 [3].  SNAP format uses NLPID followed by\n   Organizationally
      Unique Identifier and a PID.\n   NLPID\n   The single octet identifier provides
      a mechanism to allow easy\n   protocol identification.  For L2TP NLPID value
      0x80 is used which\n   indicates the presence of SNAP header.\n   OUI & PID\n
      \  The three-octet Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 0x00-00-5E\n   identifies
      IANA who administers the meaning of the Protocol\n   Identifier (PID) 0x0007.
      \ Together they identify a distinct protocol.\n   Format of L2TP frames encapsulated

      Agreement.\n   If fragmentation is not supported, the two Frame Relay endpoints
      MUST\n   support an MTU size of at least 1526 which is based on adding the PPP\n
      \  Max-Receive-Unit size with the PPP header size with the Max L2TP\n   Header
      Size with the Frame Relay header size (PPP header size is the\n   protocol field
      size plus HDLC framing bytes, which is required by\n   L2TP).  To avoid packet
      discards on the Frame Relay interface, the\n   RECOMMENDED default Frame Relay
      MTU is 1564 based on a PPP default\n   MRU of 1500.  The means to ensure these
      MTU settings are left to\n   implementation.\n"

      setup will be triggered when\n   L2TP tries to create a tunnel.  Details of
      triggering mechanism are\n   left to implementation.  There SHALL NOT be any
      change in Frame Relay\n   SVC signaling due to L2TP.  The endpoints of the L2TP
      tunnel MUST be\n   identified by X.121/E.164 addresses in case of Frame Relay
      SVC.\n   These addresses MAY be obtained as tunnel endpoints for a user as\n
      \  defined in [4].  In case of PVCs, the Virtual Circuit to carry L2TP\n   traffic
      MAY be configured administratively.  The endpoints of the\n   tunnel MUST be
      identified by DLCI, assigned to the PVC at\n   configuration time.  This DLCI
      MAY be obtained as tunnel endpoints\n   for a user as defined in [4].\n   There
      SHALL be no framing issues between PPP and Frame Relay.  PPP\n   frames received
      by LAC from remote user are stripped of CRC, link\n   framing, and transparency
      bytes, encapsulated in L2TP, and forwarded\n   over Frame Relay tunnel.\n"
