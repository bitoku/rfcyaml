  - "1. Introduction - Robert Braden\n   Thirty years ago today, the first Request\
    \ for Comments document,\n   RFC 1, was published at UCLA (ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1.txt).\n\
    \   This was the first of a series that currently contains more than 2500\n  \
    \ documents on computer networking, collected, archived, and edited by\n   Jon\
    \ Postel for 28 years.  Jon has left us, but this 30th anniversary\n   tribute\
    \ to the RFC series is assembled in grateful admiration for his\n   massive contribution.\n\
    \   The rest of this document contains a brief recollection from the\n   present\
    \ RFC Editor Joyce K. Reynolds, followed by recollections from\n   three pioneers:\
    \ Steve Crocker who wrote RFC 1, Vint Cerf whose long-\n   range vision continues\
    \ to guide us, and Jake Feinler who played a key\n   role in the middle years\
    \ of the RFC series.\n"

  - "2. Reflections - Joyce K. Reynolds\n   A very long time ago when I was dabbling\
    \ in IP network number and\n   protocol parameter assignments with Jon Postel,\
    \ gateways were still\n   \"dumb\", the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) was in\
    \ its infancy and\n   TOPS-20 was in its heyday.  I was aware of the Request for\
    \ Comments\n   (RFCs) document series, with Jon as the RFC Editor.  I really didn't\n\
    \   know much of the innerworkings of what the task entailed.  It was\n   Jon's\
    \ job and he quietly went about publishing documents for the\n   ARPANET community.\n\
    \   Meanwhile, Jon and I would have meetings in his office to go over our\n  \
    \ specific tasks of the day.  One day, I began to notice that a pile of\n   folders\
    \ sitting to one side of his desk seemed to be growing.  A few\n   weeks later\
    \ the pile had turned into two stacks of folders.  I asked\n   him what they were.\
    \  Apparently, they contained documents for RFC\n   publication.  Jon was trying\
    \ to keep up with the increasing quantity\n   of submissions for RFC publication.\n\
    \   I mentioned to him one day that he should learn to let go of some of\n   his\
    \ work load and task it on to other people.  He listened intently,\n   but didn't\
    \ comment.  The very next day, Jon wheeled a computer stand\n   into my office\
    \ which was stacked with those documents from his desk\n   intended for RFC publication.\
    \  He had a big Cheshire cat grin on his\n   face and stated, \"I'm letting go!\"\
    , and walked away.\n   At the top of the stack was a big red three ring notebook.\
    \  Inside\n   contained the \"NLS Textbook\", which was prepared at ISI by Jon,\
    \ Lynne\n   Sims and Linda Sato for use on ISI's TENEX and TOPS-20 systems.  Upon\n\
    \   reading its contents, I learned that the NLS system was designed to\n   help\
    \ people work with information on a computer.  It included a wide\n   range of\
    \ tools, from a simple set of commands for writing, reading\n   and printing documents\
    \ to sophisticated methods for retrieving and\n   communication information. \
    \ NLS was the system Jon used to write,\n   edit and create the RFCs.  Thus began\
    \ my indoctrination to the RFC\n   publication series.\n   Operating systems and\
    \ computers have changed over the years, but\n   Jon's perseverance about the\
    \ consistency of the RFC style and quality\n   of the documents remained true.\
    \  Unfortunately, Jon did not live to\n   see the 30th Anniversary of this series\
    \ that he unfailingly nurtured.\n   Yet, the spirit of the RFC publication series\
    \ continues as we\n   approach the new millennium.  Jon would be proud.\n"

  - "3. The First Pebble: Publication of RFC 1 - Steve Crocker\n   RFC 1, \"Host Software\"\
    , issued thirty years ago on April 7, 1969\n   outlined some thoughts and initial\
    \ experiments.  It was a modest and\n   entirely forgettable memo, but it has\
    \ significance because it was\n   part of a broad initiative whose impact is still\
    \ with us today.\n   At the time RFC 1 was written, the ARPANET was still under\
    \ design.\n   Bolt, Beranek and Newman had won the all-important contract to build\n\
    \   and operate the Interface Message Processors or \"IMPs\", the\n   forerunners\
    \ of the modern routers.  They were each the size of a\n   refrigerator and cost\
    \ about $100,000 in 1969 dollars.\n   The network was scheduled to be deployed\
    \ among the research sites\n   supported by ARPA's Information Processing Techniques\
    \ Office (IPTO).\n   The first four nodes were to be at UCLA, SRI, University\
    \ of\n   California, Santa Barbara and University of Utah.  The first\n   installation,\
    \ at UCLA, was set for September 1, 1969.\n   Although there had been considerable\
    \ planning of the topology, leased\n   lines, modems and IMPs, there was little\
    \ organization or planning\n   regarding network applications.  It was assumed\
    \ the research sites\n   would figure it out.  This turned out to be a brilliant\
    \ management\n   decision at ARPA.\n   Previously, in the summer of 1968, a handful\
    \ of graduate students and\n   staff members from the four sites were called together\
    \ to discuss the\n   forthcoming network.  There was only a basic outline.  BBN\
    \ had not\n   yet won the contract, and there was no technical specification for\n\
    \   the network's operation.  At the first meeting, we scheduled future\n   meetings\
    \ at each of the other laboratories, thus setting the stage\n   for today's thrice\
    \ yearly movable feast.  Over the next couple of\n   years, the group grew substantially\
    \ and we found ourselves with\n   overflow crowds of fifty to a hundred people\
    \ at Network Working Group\n   meetings.  Compared to modern IETF meetings all\
    \ over the world with\n   attendance in excess of 1,000 people and several dozen\
    \ active working\n   groups, the early Network Working Groups were small and tame,\
    \ but\n   they seemed large and only barely manageable at the time.  One\n   tradition\
    \ that doesn't seem to have changed at all is the spirit of\n   unrestrained participation\
    \ in working group meetings.\n   Our initial group met a handful of times in the\
    \ summer and fall of\n   1968 and winter 1969.  Our earliest meetings were unhampered\
    \ by\n   knowledge of what the network would look like or how it would\n   interact\
    \ with the hosts.  Depending on your point of view, this\n   either allowed us\
    \ or forced us to think about broader and grander\n   topics.  We recognized we\
    \ would eventually have to get around to\n   dealing with message formats and\
    \ other specific details of low-level\n   protocols, but our first thoughts focused\
    \ on what applications the\n   network might support.  In our view, the 50 kilobit\
    \ per second\n   communication lines being used for the ARPANET seemed slow, and\
    \ we\n   worried that it might be hard to provide high-quality interactive\n \
    \  service across the network.  I wish we had not been so accurate!\n   When BBN\
    \ issued its Host-IMP specification in spring 1969, our\n   freedom to wander\
    \ over broad and grand topics ended.  Before then,\n   however, we tried to consider\
    \ the most general designs and the most\n   exciting applications.  One thought\
    \ that captured our imagination was\n   the idea of downloading a small interpretative\
    \ program at the\n   beginning of a session.  The downloaded program could then\
    \ control\n   the interactions and make efficient use of the narrow bandwidth\n\
    \   between the user's local machine and the back-end system the user was\n  \
    \ interacting with. Jeff Rulifson at SRI was the prime mover of this\n   line\
    \ of thinking, and he took a crack at designing a Decode-Encode\n   Language (DEL)\
    \ [RFC 5].  Michel Elie, visiting at UCLA from France,\n   worked on this idea\
    \ further and published Proposal for a Network\n   Interchange Language (NIL)\
    \ [RFC 51].  The emergence of Java and\n   ActiveX in the last few years finally\
    \ brings those early ideas to\n   fruition, and we're not done yet.  I think we\
    \ will continue to see\n   striking advances in combining communication and computing.\n\
    \   I have already suggested that the early RFCs and the associated\n   Network\
    \ Working Group laid the foundation for the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force.\
    \  Two all-important aspects of the early work\n   deserve mention, although they're\
    \ completely evident to anyone who\n   participates in the process today.  First,\
    \ the technical direction we\n   chose from the beginning was an open architecture\
    \ based on multiple\n   layers of protocol.  We were frankly too scared to imagine\
    \ that we\n   could define an all-inclusive set of protocols that would serve\n\
    \   indefinitely.  We envisioned a continual process of evolution and\n   addition,\
    \ and obviously this is what's happened.\n   The RFCs themselves also represented\
    \ a certain sense of fear.  After\n   several months of meetings, we felt obliged\
    \ to write down our\n   thoughts.  We parceled out the work and wrote the initial\
    \ batch of\n   memos.  In addition to participating in the technical design, I\
    \ took\n   on the administrative function of setting up a simple scheme for\n\
    \   numbering and distributing the notes.  Mindful that our group was\n   informal,\
    \ junior and unchartered, I wanted to emphasize these notes\n   were the beginning\
    \ of a dialog and not an assertion of control.\n   It's now been thirty years\
    \ since the first RFCs were issued.  At the\n   time, I believed the notes were\
    \ temporary and the entire series would\n   die off in a year or so once the network\
    \ was running.  Thanks to the\n   spectacular efforts of the entire community\
    \ and the perseverance and\n   dedication of Jon Postel, Joyce Reynolds and their\
    \ crew, the humble\n   series of Requests for Comments evolved and thrived.  It\
    \ became the\n   mainstay for sharing technical designs in the Internet community\
    \ and\n   the archetype for other communities as well.  Like the Sorcerer's\n\
    \   Apprentice, we succeeded beyond our wildest dreams and our worst\n   fears.\n"

  - "4. RFCs - The Great Conversation - Vint Cerf\n   A long time ago, in a network\
    \ far, far away...\n   Considering the movement of planet Earth around the Sun\
    \ and the Sun\n   around the Milky Way galaxy, that first network IS far away\
    \ in the\n   relativistic sense. It takes 200 million years for the Sun to make\n\
    \   its way around the galaxy, so thirty years is only an eyeblink on the\n  \
    \ galactic clock. But what a marvelous thirty years it has been! The\n   RFCs\
    \ document the odyssey of the ARPANET and, later, the Internet, as\n   its creators\
    \ and netizens explore, discover, build, re-build, argue\n   and resolve questions\
    \ of design, concepts and applications of\n   computer networking.\n   It has\
    \ been ultimately fascinating to watch the transformation of the\n   RFCs themselves\
    \ from their earliest, tentative dialog form to today's\n   much more structured\
    \ character. The growth of applications such as\n   email, bulletin boards and\
    \ the world wide web have had much to do\n   with that transformation, but so\
    \ has the scale and impact of the\n   Internet on our social and economic fabric.\
    \ As the Internet has taken\n   on greater economic importance, the standards\
    \ documented in the RFCs\n   have become more important and the RFCs more formal.\
    \ The dialog has\n   moved to other venues as technology has changed and the working\n\
    \   styles have adapted.\n   Hiding in the history of the RFCs is the history\
    \ of human\n   institutions for achieving cooperative work. And also hiding in\
    \ that\n   history are some heroes that haven't been acknowledged.  On this\n\
    \   thirtieth anniversary, I am grateful for the opportunity to\n   acknowledge\
    \ some of them. It would be possible to fill a book with\n   such names - mostly\
    \ of the authors of the RFCs, but as this must be a\n   brief contribution, I\
    \ want to mention four of them in particular:\n   Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, Joyce\
    \ K. Reynolds and Bob Braden.\n   Steve Crocker is a modest man and would likely\
    \ never make the\n   observation that while the contents of RFC 1 might have been\
    \ entirely\n   forgettable, the act of writing RFC 1 was indicative of the brave\
    \ and\n   ultimately clear-visioned leadership that he brought to a journey\n\
    \   into the unknown. There were no guides in those days - computer\n   networking\
    \ was new and few historical milestones prepared us for what\n   lay ahead. Steve's\
    \ ability to accommodate a diversity of views, to\n   synthesize them into coherence\
    \ and, like Tom Sawyer, to persuade\n   others that they wanted to devote their\
    \ time to working on the\n   problems that lay in the path of progress can be\
    \ found in the early\n   RFCs and in the Network Working Group meetings that Steve\
    \ led.\n   In the later work on Internet, I did my best to emulate the framework\n\
    \   that Steve invented: the International Network Working Group (INWG)\n   and\
    \ its INWG Notes, the Internet Working Group and its Internet\n   Experiment Notes\
    \ (IENs) were brazen knock-offs of Steve's\n   organizational vision and style.\n\
    \   It is doubtful that the RFCs would be the quality body of material\n   they\
    \ are today were it not for Jonathan Postel's devotion to them\n   from the start.\
    \ Somehow, Jon knew, even thirty years ago that it\n   might be important to document\
    \ what was done and why, to say nothing\n   of trying to capture the debate for\
    \ the benefit of future networkers\n   wondering how we'd reached some of the\
    \ conclusions we did (and\n   probably shake their heads...).\n   Jon was the\
    \ network's Boswell, but it was his devotion to quality and\n   his remarkable\
    \ mix of technical and editing skills that permeate many\n   of the more monumental\
    \ RFCs that dealt with what we now consider the\n   TCP/IP standards. Many bad\
    \ design decisions were re-worked thanks to\n   Jon's stubborn determination that\
    \ we all get it \"right\" - as the\n   editor, he simply would not let something\
    \ go out that didn't meet his\n   personal quality filter. There were times when\
    \ we moaned and\n   complained, hollered and harangued, but in the end, most of\
    \ the time,\n   Jon was right and we knew it.\n   Joyce K. Reynolds was at Jon's\
    \ side for much of the time that Jon was\n   the RFC editor and as has been observed,\
    \ they functioned in unison\n   like a matched pair of superconducting electrons\
    \ - and\n   superconductors they were of the RFC series. For all practical\n \
    \  purposes, it was impossible to tell which of the two had edited any\n   particular\
    \ RFC. Joyce's passion for quality has matched Jon's and\n   continues to this\
    \ day. And she has the same subtle, puckish sense of\n   humor that emerged at\
    \ unexpected moments in Jon's stewardship. One\n   example that affected me personally\
    \ was Joyce's assignment of number\n   2468 to the RFC written to remember Jon.\
    \  I never would have thought\n   of that, and it was done so subtly that it didn't\
    \ even ring a bell\n   until someone sent me an email asking whether this was\
    \ a coincidence.\n   In analog to classical mystery stories, the editor did it.\n\
    \   Another unsung hero in the RFC saga is Bob Braden - another man whose\n  \
    \ modesty belies contributions of long-standing and monumental\n   proportions.\
    \ It is my speculation that much of the quality of the\n   RFCs can be traced\
    \ to consultations among the USC/ISI team, including\n   Jon, Joyce and Bob among\
    \ others. Of course, RFC 1122 and 1123 stand\n   as two enormous contributions\
    \ to the clarity of the Internet\n   standards. For that task alone, Bob deserves\
    \ tremendous appreciation,\n   but he has led the End-to-End Research Group for\
    \ many years out of\n   which has come some of the most important RFCs that refine\
    \ our\n   understanding of optimal implementation of the protocols, especially\n\
    \   TCP.\n   When the RFCs were first produced, they had an almost 19th century\n\
    \   character to them - letters exchanged in public debating the merits\n   of\
    \ various design choices for protocols in the ARPANET. As email and\n   bulletin\
    \ boards emerged from the fertile fabric of the network, the\n   far-flung participants\
    \ in this historic dialog began to make\n   increasing use of the online medium\
    \ to carry out the discussion -\n   reducing the need for documenting the debate\
    \ in the RFCs and, in some\n   respects, leaving historians somewhat impoverished\
    \ in the process.\n   RFCs slowly became conclusions rather than debates.\n  \
    \ Jon permitted publication of items other than purely technical\n   documents\
    \ in this series. Hence one finds poetry, humor (especially\n   the April 1 RFCs\
    \ which are as funny today as they were when they were\n   published), and reprints\
    \ of valuable reference material mixed into\n   the documents prepared by the\
    \ network working groups.\n   In the early 1970s, the Advanced Research Projects\
    \ Agency was\n   conducting several parallel research programs into packet switching\n\
    \   technology, after the stunning success of this idea in the ARPANET.\n   Among\
    \ these were the Packet Radio Network, the Atlantic Packet\n   Satellite Network\
    \ and the Internet projects. These each spawned note\n   series akin to but parallel\
    \ to the RFCs. PRNET Notes, ARPA Satellite\n   System Notes (bearing the obvious\
    \ and unfortunate acronym...),\n   Internet Experiment Notes (IENs), and so on.\
    \ After the Internet\n   protocols were mandated to be used on the ARPANET and\
    \ other DARPA-\n   sponsored networks in January 1983 (SATNET actually converted\
    \ before\n   that), Internet- related notes were merged into the RFC series. For\
    \ a\n   time, after the Internet project seemed destined to bear fruit, IENs\n\
    \   were published in parallel with RFCs. A few voices, Danny Cohen's in\n   particular\
    \ (who was then at USC/ISI with Jon Postel) suggested that\n   separate series\
    \ were a mistake and that it would be a lot easier to\n   maintain and to search\
    \ a single series. Hindsight seems to have\n   proven Danny right as the RFC series,\
    \ with its dedicated editors,\n   seems to have borne the test of time far better\
    \ than its more\n   ephemeral counterparts.\n   As the organizations associated\
    \ with Internet continued to evolve,\n   one sees the RFCs adapting to changed\
    \ circumstances. Perhaps the most\n   powerful influence can be seen from the\
    \ evolution of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force from just one of several\
    \ task forces whose\n   chairpersons formed the Internet Activities Board to the\
    \ dominant,\n   global Internet Standards development organization, managed by\
    \ its\n   Internet Engineering Steering Group and operating under the auspices\n\
    \   of the Internet Society. The process of producing \"standards-track\"\n  \
    \ RFCs is now far more rigorous than it once was, carries far more\n   impact\
    \ on a burgeoning industry, and has spawned its own, relatively\n   informal \"\
    Internet Drafts\" series of short-lived documents forming\n   the working set\
    \ of the IETF working groups.\n   The dialogue that once characterized the early\
    \ RFCs has given way to\n   thrice-annual face-to-face meetings of the IETF and\
    \ enormous\n   quantities of email, as well as a growing amount of group-interactive\n\
    \   work through chat rooms, shared white boards and even more elaborate\n   multicast\
    \ conferences. The parallelism and the increasing quantity of\n   transient dialogue\
    \ surrounding the evolution of the Internet has made\n   the task of technology\
    \ historians considerably more difficult,\n   although one can sense a counter-balancing\
    \ through the phenomenal\n   amount of information accumulating in the World Wide\
    \ Web. Even casual\n   searches often turn up some surprising and sometimes embarrassing\
    \ old\n   memoranda - a number of which were once paper but which have been\n\
    \   rendered into bits by some enterprising volunteer.\n   The RFCs, begun so\
    \ tentatively thirty years ago, and persistently\n   edited and maintained by\
    \ Jon Postel and his colleagues at USC/ISI,\n   tell a remarkable story of exploration,\
    \ achievement, and dedication\n   by a growing mass of internauts who will not\
    \ sleep until the Internet\n   truly is for everyone. It is in that spirit that\
    \ this remembrance is\n   offered, and in particular, in memory of our much loved\
    \ colleague,\n   Jon Postel, without whose personal commitment to this archive,\
    \ the\n   story might have been vastly different and not nearly as remarkable.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. Reflecting on 30 years of RFCs - Jake Feinler\n   By now we know that the\
    \ first RFC was published on April 7, 1969 by\n   Steve Crocker.  It was entitled\
    \ \"Host Software\".  The second RFC was\n   published on April 9, 1969 by Bill\
    \ Duvall of SRI International (then\n   called Stanford Research Institute or\
    \ SRI), and it too was entitled\n   \"Host Software\".  RFC 2 was a response to\
    \ suggestions made in RFC 1-\n   -and so the dialog began.\n   Steve proposed\
    \ 2 experiments in RFC 1:\n   \"1)  SRI is currently modifying their on-line retrieval\
    \ system which\n   will be the major software component of the Network Documentation\n\
    \   Center [or The SRI NIC as it soon came to be known] so that it can be\n  \
    \ modified with Model 35 teletypes.  The control of the teletypes will\n   be\
    \ written in DEL [Decode-Encode Language].  All sites will write DEL\n   compilers\
    \ and use NLS [SRI Doug Engelbart's oNLine System] through\n   the DEL program\"\
    .\n   \"2)  SRI will write a DEL front end for full NLS, graphics included.\n\
    \   UCLA and UTAH will use NLS with graphics\".\n   RFC 2, issued 2 days later,\
    \ proposed detailed procedures for\n   connecting to the NLS documentation system\
    \ across the network.  Steve\n   may think RFC 1 was an \"entirely forgettable\"\
    \ document; however, as\n   an information person, I beg to differ with him. \
    \ The concepts\n   presented in this first dialog were mind boggling, and eventually\
    \ led\n   to the kind of network interchange we are all using on the web today.\n\
    \   (Fortunately, we have graduated beyond DEL and Model 35 teletypes!)\n   RFC\
    \ 1 was, I believe, a paper document.  RFC 2 was produced online\n   via the SRI\
    \ NLS system and was entered into the online SRI NLS\n   Journal.  However, it\
    \ was probably mailed to each recipient via snail\n   mail by the NIC, as email\
    \ and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) had\n   not yet been invented.\n   RFC\
    \ 3, again by Steve Crocker, was entitled, \"Documentation\n   Conventions;\"\
    \ and we see that already the need for a few ground rules\n   was surfacing. More\
    \ ground-breaking concepts were introduced in this\n   RFC.  It stated that:\n\
    \   \"The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software,\n \
    \  the strategies for using the network, and the initial experiments\n   with\
    \ the network.  Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes\n   such as\
    \ this.  Notes may be produced at any site by anybody and\n   included in this\
    \ series\".\n   It goes on to say:\n   \"The content of a NWG note may be any\
    \ thought, suggestion,\n   etc.related to the Host software or other aspect of\
    \ the network.\n   Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.\n \
    \  Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific\n   suggestions\
    \ or implementation techniques without introductory or\n   background explanation,\
    \ and explicit questions without any attempted\n   answers are all acceptable.\
    \  The minimum length for a NWG note is one\n   sentence\".\n   \"These standards\
    \ (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two\n   reasons.  First, there is\
    \ a tendency to view a written statement as\n   discussion of considerably less\
    \ than authoritative ideas.  Second,\n   there is a natural hesitancy to publish\
    \ something unpolished, and we\n   hope to ease this inhibition\".\n   Steve asked\
    \ that this RFC be sent to a distribution list consisting\n   of:\n        Bob\
    \ Kahn, BBN\n        Larry Roberts, ARPA\n        Steve Carr, UCLA\n        Jeff\
    \ Rulifson, UTAH\n        Ron Stoughton, UCSB\n        Steve Crocker, UCLA\n \
    \  Thus by the time the third RFC was published, many of the concepts of\n   how\
    \ to do business in this new networking environment had been\n   established--there\
    \ would be a working group of implementers (NWG)\n   actually discussing and trying\
    \ things out; ideas were to be free-\n   wheeling; communications would be informal;\
    \ documents would be\n   deposited (online when possible) at the NIC and distributed\
    \ freely to\n   members of the working group; and anyone with something to contribute\n\
    \   could come to the party.  With this one document a swath was\n   instantly\
    \ cut through miles of red tape and pedantic process.  Was\n   this radical for\
    \ the times or what!  And we were only up to RFC 3!\n   Many more RFCs followed\
    \ and the SRI NLS Journal became the\n   bibliographic search service of the ARPANET.\
    \  It differed from other\n   search services of the time in one important respect:\
    \  when you got a\n   \"hit\" searching the journal online, not only did you get\
    \ a citation\n   telling you such things as the author and title; you got an\n\
    \   associated little string of text called a \"link\".  If you used a\n   command\
    \ called \"jump to link\",  voila!  you got the full text of the\n   document.\
    \  You did not have to go to the library, or send an order\n   off to an issuing\
    \ agency to get a copy of the document, as was the\n   custom with other search\
    \ services of the time.  The whole document\n   itself was right there immediately!\n\
    \   Also, any document submitted to the journal could not be changed.\n   New\
    \ versions could be submitted, and these superceded old versions,\n   but again\
    \ the new versions could not be changed.  Each document was\n   given a unique\
    \ identifying number, so it was easy to track.  These\n   features were useful\
    \ in a fast-moving environment.  Documents often\n   went through several drafts\
    \ before they were finally issued as an RFC\n   or other official document, and\
    \ being able to track versions was very\n   useful.\n   The SRI NLS Journal was\
    \ revolutionary for the time; however, access\n   to it online presented several\
    \ operational problems.  Host computers\n   were small and crowded, and the network\
    \ was growing by leaps and\n   bounds; so connections had to be timed out and\
    \ broken to give\n   everyone a chance at access.  Also, the rest of the world\
    \ was still a\n   paper world (and there were no scanners or laser printers, folks!),\n\
    \   so the NIC still did a brisk business sending out paper documents to\n   requestors.\n\
    \   By 1972 when I became Principal Investigator for the NIC project, the\n  \
    \ ARPANET was growing rapidly, and more and more hosts were being\n   attached\
    \ to it.  Each host was required to have a technical contact\n   known as the\
    \ Technical Liaison, and most of the Liaison were also\n   members of the NWG.\
    \  Each Liaison was sent a set of documents by the\n   NIC called \"functional\
    \ documents\" which included the Protocol\n   Handbook (first issued by BBN and\
    \ later published by the NIC.)  The\n   content of the Protocol Handbook was made\
    \ up of key RFCs and a\n   document called \"BBN 1822\" which specified the Host-to-Imp\
    \ protocol.\n   The NWG informed the NIC as to which documents should be included\
    \ in\n   the handbook; and the NIC assembled, published, and distributed the\n\
    \   book. Alex McKenzie of BBN helped the NIC with the first version of\n   the\
    \ handbook, but soon a young fellow, newly out of grad school,\n   named Jon Postel\
    \ joined the NWG and became the NIC's contact and\n   ARPA's spokesperson for\
    \ what should be issued in the Protocol\n   Handbook.\n   No one who is familiar\
    \ with the RFCs can think of them without\n   thinking of Dr. Jonathan Postel.\
    \  He was \"Mister RFC\" to most of us.\n   Jon worked at SRI in the seventies\
    \ and had the office next to mine.\n   We were both members of Doug Engelbart's\
    \ Augmentation Research\n   Center.  Not only was Jon a brilliant computer scientist,\
    \ he also\n   cared deeply about the process of disseminating information and\n\
    \   establishing a methodology for working in a networking environment.\n   We\
    \ often had conversations way into the wee hours talking about ways\n   to do\
    \ this \"right\".  The network owes Jon a debt of gratitude for his\n   dedication\
    \ to the perpetuation of the RFCs.  His work, along with\n   that of his staff,\
    \ the NWG, the IETF, the various NICs, and CNRI to\n   keep this set of documents\
    \ viable over the years was, and continues\n   to be, a labor of love.\n   Jon\
    \ left SRI in 1976 to join USC-ISI, but by that time the die was\n   cast, and\
    \ the RFCs, NWG, Liaison, and the NIC were part of the\n   network's way of doing\
    \ business. However, the SRI NLS Journal system\n   was becoming too big for its\
    \ host computer and could not handle the\n   number of users trying to access\
    \ it.  Email and FTP had been\n   implemented by now, so the NIC developed methodology\
    \ for delivering\n   information to users via distributed information servers\
    \ across the\n   network.  A user could request an RFC by email from his host\
    \ computer\n   and have it automatically delivered to his mailbox.  Users could\
    \ also\n   purchase hardcopy subscriptions to the RFCs and copies of the\n   Protocol\
    \ Handbook, if they did not have network access.\n   The NIC worked with Jon,\
    \ ARPA, DCA, NSF, other NICs, and other\n   agencies to have secondary reference\
    \ sets of RFCs easily accessible\n   to implementers throughout the world.  The\
    \ RFCs were also shared\n   freely with official standards bodies, manufacturers\
    \ and vendors,\n   other working groups, and universities.  None of the RFCs were\
    \ ever\n   restricted or classified.  This was no mean feat when you consider\n\
    \   that they were being funded by DoD during the height of the Cold War.\n  \
    \ Many of us worked very hard in the early days to establish the RFCs\n   as the\
    \ official set of technical notes for the development of the\n   Internet.  This\
    \ was not an easy job.  There were suggestions for many\n   parallel efforts and\
    \ splinter groups.  There were naysayers all along\n   the way because this was\
    \ a new way of doing things, and the ARPANET\n   was \"coloring outside the lines\"\
    \ so to speak.  Jon, as Editor-in-\n   Chief was criticized because the RFCs were\
    \ not issued by an\n   \"official\" standards body, and the NIC was criticized\
    \ because it was\n   not an \"official\" document issuing agency.  We both strived\
    \ to marry\n   the new way of doing business with the old, and fortunately were\n\
    \   usually supported by our government sponsors, who themselves were\n   breaking\
    \ new ground.\n   Many RFCs were the end result of months of heated discussion\
    \ and\n   implementation.  Authoring one of them was not for the faint of\n  \
    \ heart.  Feelings often ran high as to what was the \"right\" way to go.\n  \
    \ Heated arguments sometimes ensued.  Usually they were confined to\n   substance,\
    \ but sometimes they got personal.  Jon would often step in\n   and arbitrate.\
    \  Eventually the NWG or the Sponsors had to say, \"It's\n   a wrap.  Issue a\
    \ final RFC\".  Jon, as Editor-in-Chief of the RFCs,\n   often took merciless\
    \ flak from those who wanted to continue\n   discussing and implementing, or those\
    \ whose ideas were left on the\n   cutting room floor.  Somehow he always managed\
    \ to get past these\n   controversies with style and grace and move on.  We owe\
    \ him and\n   others, who served on the NWG or authored RFCs, an extreme debt\
    \ of\n   gratitude for their contributions and dedication.\n   At no time was\
    \ the controversy worse than it was when DoD adopted\n   TCP/IP as its official\
    \ host-to-host protocols for communications\n   networks.  In March 1982, a military\
    \ directive was issued by the\n   Under Secretary of Defense, Richard DeLauer.\
    \  It simply stated that\n   the use of TCP and IP was mandatory for DoD communications\
    \ networks.\n   Bear in mind that a military directive is not something you discuss\
    \ -\n   the time for discussion is long over when one is issued.  Rather a\n \
    \  military directive is something you DO.  The ARPANET and its\n   successor,\
    \ the Defense Data Network, were military networks, so the\n   gauntlet was down\
    \ and the race was on to prove whether the new\n   technology could do the job\
    \ on a real operational network.  You have\n   no idea what chaos and controversy\
    \ that little 2-page directive\n   caused on the network.  (But that's a story\
    \ for another time.)\n   However, that directive, along with RFCs 791 and 793\
    \ (IP and TCP)\n   gave the RFCs as a group of technical documents stature and\n\
    \   recognition throughout the world.  (And yes, TCP/IP certainly did do\n   the\
    \ job!)\n   Jon and I were both government contractors, so of course followed\
    \ the\n   directions of our contracting officers.  He was mainly under contract\n\
    \   to ARPA, whereas the NIC was mainly under contract to DCA.  BBN was\n   another\
    \ key contractor.  For the most part we all worked as a team.\n   However, there\
    \ was frequent turnover in military personnel assigned\n   to both the ARPANET\
    \ and the DDN, and we all collaborated to try to\n   get all the new participants\
    \ informed as to what was available to\n   them when they joined the network.\
    \  We also tried to foster\n   collaboration rather than duplication of effort,\
    \ when it was\n   appropriate.  The NWG (or IETF as it is now known) and the RFCs\n\
    \   became the main vehicles for interagency collaboration as the DoD\n   protocols\
    \ began to be used on other government, academic, and\n   commercial networks.\n\
    \   I left SRI and the NIC project in 1989.  At that time there were\n   about\
    \ 30,000 hosts on what was becoming known as the Internet, and\n   just over a\
    \ 1000 RFCs had been issued.  Today there are millions of\n   hosts on the Internet,\
    \ and we are well past the 3000 mark for RFCs.\n   It was great fun to be a part\
    \ of what turned out to be a\n   technological revolution.   It is heartwarming\
    \ to see that the RFCs\n   are still being issued by the IETF, and that they are\
    \ still largely\n   based on ideas that have been discussed and implemented; that\
    \ the\n   concepts of online working groups and distributed information servers\n\
    \   are a way of life; that those little \"links\" (officially known as\n   hypertext)\
    \ have revolutionized the delivery of documents; and that\n   the government,\
    \ academia, and business are now all playing the same\n   game for fun and profit.\
    \  (Oh yes, I'm happy to see that Steve's idea\n   for integrated text and graphics\
    \ has finally come to fruition,\n   although that work took a little longer than\
    \ 2 days.)\n"

  - "6. Favorite RFCs -- The First 30 Years - Celeste Anderson\n   Five years ago,\
    \ Jon Postel and I had wanted to publish a 25th RFC\n   anniversary book, but,\
    \ alas, we were both too busy working on other\n   projects.  We determined then\

    \ the first\n   30 years of their existence.\n   Jon's untimely death in October\
    \ 1998 prevented us from completing\n   this goal.  We did, however, start to\

    \ we were going to try\n   to make them look as close to the typewritten originals\
