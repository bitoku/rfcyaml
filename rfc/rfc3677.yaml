- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Society (ISOC) provides organizational and\
    \ financial\n   support for the IETF.  As stipulated in ISOC's by-laws the IETF\
    \ is\n   called upon to name 3 Trustees to its Board (BoT), with staggered 3\n\
    \   year terms.  This requires that the IETF name one Trustee each year.\n   This\
    \ memo outlines the process by which the IETF makes that\n   selection.  This\
    \ process will also be used in the event of mid-term\n   vacancies that may arise\
    \ with IETF nominated Board positions.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview of Selection Process
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview of Selection Process\n   In brief, this document describes the\
    \ timeframe and procedures for\n   the IAB to solicit public input and make a\
    \ selection for the open\n   position each year.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Rationale\n   An alternative approach to making a selection for these positions\n\
    \   would be to use the IETF's NomCom (RFC 2727 [1] and its revisions).\n   However,\
    \ that NomCom is chartered and defined specifically to the\n   task of making\
    \ selections for IETF organization tasks, and the ISOC\n   BoT appointment process\
    \ does not fit that in 2 ways:\n   1.  the timeframe of the appointment does not\
    \ mesh with the IETF\n       appointment cycle\n   2.  the nature of the deliberations\
    \ and the type of information\n       solicited would be significantly different\
    \ for an external\n       appointment, such as this appointment to the ISOC BoT\n\
    \   The first issue (timing) could be resolved fairly easily for this\n   specific\
    \ appointment.  The second issue is more general, and not\n   reasonably reconciled\
    \ with the IETF NomCom task as currently\n   specified.\n   The process described\
    \ in RFC 2727 is oriented toward soliciting\n   feedback from the IETF community\
    \ with respect to individuals and\n   technical positions with which they have\
    \ personal experience.  To\n   make a good decision on external appointments,\
    \ in general, the NomCom\n   would have to understand the requirements for those\
    \ positions, and\n   attempt to evaluate candidates for a very different set of\
    \ skills\n   than is required of IAB/IESG members.  It might also require\n  \
    \ soliciting feedback from outside the IETF community.   There is no\n   question\
    \ that the individuals that constitute the IETF NomCom each\n   year have the\
    \ competence to carry out such a search; the issue is\n   that it is a very different\
    \ task, would require additional time and\n   resources, and therefore is a side\
    \ effort that could very well\n   undermine the effectiveness of the NomCom in\
    \ carrying out its primary\n   task for the IETF.\n   By contrast, the IAB is\
    \ chartered to be responsible for IETF external\n   liaisons, is a standing body\
    \ that works with ISOC (and the ISOC\n   Board), and therefore has a working knowledge\
    \ of the requirements of\n   the specific position discussed here.\n   At some\
    \ future point, if there is a more general need to make\n   external appointments,\
    \ the IETF may consider broadening the scope of\n   the IETF NomCom role, or create\
    \ a separate nominating committee for\n   such external non-liaison appointments.\
    \  This document proposes that\n   is not necessary or desirable for the purposes\
    \ of this one annual\n   appointment.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Desirable Qualifications and Selection Criteria for an\n    IETF-Nominated\
    \ ISOC Trustee\n   Candidates for an ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement\n\
    \   in the IETF with a particular focus on active participation in IETF\n   Working\
    \ Groups.\n   The candidate is expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical\n\
    \   competence in Internet technology, and be able to articulate\n   technology\
    \ issues such that the ISOC Board can be provided with sound\n   technical perspectives.\
    \  The candidate is also expected to be able to\n   understand the respective\
    \ roles and responsibilities of the IETF and\n   ISOC and be able to articulate\
    \ these roles within both organizational\n   communities.\n   The candidate will\
    \ also be expected to exercise all the duties of an\n   ISOC Board member, including\
    \ fiduciary responsibility, setting of\n   policies, oversight of the operation\
    \ of the Society,  representing\n   the interests of the members and stakeholders\
    \ of the Society and\n   participation in all Board meetings and Board activity\
    \ programs.\n   The candidate is not a representative or a delegate of the IETF\
    \ and\n   is not chartered to represent the IETF or the IETF Standards Process\n\
    \   within the ISOC Board or the broader ISOC community.  However it is\n   expected\
    \ that the candidate would be able to call on experts in the\n   IETF community\
    \ as required, to ensure that the ISOC Board receives\n   the highest quality\
    \ technical advice available.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Nominations and eligibility\n   Each year, the IAB will make a public call\
    \ for nominations on the\n   ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public\
    \ call will specify\n   the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the\
    \ means by\n   which the list of nominees will be published.\n   Self-nominations\
    \ are permitted.  Along with the name and contact\n   information for each candidate,\
    \ details about the candidate's\n   background and qualifications for the position\
    \ should be attached to\n   the nomination.  All IETF participants, including\
    \ working group\n   chairs, IETF NomCom members, IAB and IESG members are eligible\
    \ for\n   nomination.\n   IAB and IESG members who accept nomination will recuse\

- title: 3.2.  Selection
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Selection\n   The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons, review\
    \ the\n   nomination material, and make a selection.\n   The selection criteria\
    \ will include additional consideration of any\n   nominated candidates who are\
    \ concurrently members of the IAB or IESG\n   members such that at the time of\
    \ selection no more than two of the\n   three IETF-appointed ISOC Trustees are\
    \ IAB and IESG members.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Confirmation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Confirmation\n   The IESG will act as the confirming body for the selection.\
    \  In the\n   event that the IESG determines not to confirm the nominated\n  \
    \ candidate, the IESG will provide the IAB with the basis for this\n   determination\
    \ and the IAB will nominate another candidate.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.  Timeframe\n   ISOC expects to seat new Board members at its annual general\
    \ meeting\n   in June of each year.  Basic timeframe requirements for the IETF\n\
    \   process are as follows:\n   o  4-6 weeks for solicitation of nominations\n\
    \   o  4-6 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation and selection\n   o  4-6\
    \ weeks for confirmation (and re-selection as necessary) and\n      delivery to\
    \ ISOC\n   In January of each year, the IAB will announce the specific dates for\n\
    \   the IETF ISOC Trustee selection process for that year (taking into\n   account\
    \ the particular dates of the first IETF meeting of the year,\n   etc), following\
    \ the guidelines above.\n"

  - "3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies\n   This document describes the process for the general,\
    \ annual\n   appointment of ISOC Trustees to fill the seats of Trustees whose\n\
    \   terms are ending.  However, if an IETF-appointed Trustee is unable to\n  \
    \ serve his or her full term, the IAB may, at its discretion,\n   immediately\
    \ select a replacement to serve the remainder of the term\n   using the interim\
    \ process defined in Section 3.5.1.  If the IAB does\n   not invoke the interim\
    \ process, the next annual selection process\n   will fill the vacancy (if the\
    \ vacant term does not end at that point)\n   as well as the regular appointment\
    \ for that selection cycle.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  Interim Appointment Process\n   If the IAB elects to fill the mid-term\
