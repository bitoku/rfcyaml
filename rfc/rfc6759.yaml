- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Today, service providers and network administrators are\
    \ looking for\n   visibility into the packet content rather than just the packet\n\
    \   header.  Some network devices' Metering Processes inspect the packet\n   content\
    \ and identify the applications that are utilizing the network\n   traffic.  Applications\
    \ in this context are defined as networking\n   protocols used by networking processes\
    \ that exchange packets between\n   them (such as web applications, peer-to-peer\
    \ applications, file\n   transfer, e-mail applications, etc.).  Applications can\
    \ be further\n   characterized by other criteria, some of which are application\n\
    \   specific.  Examples include: web application to a specific domain,\n   per-user\
    \ specific traffic, a video application with a specific codec,\n   etc.\n   The\
    \ application identification is based on several different methods\n   or even\
    \ a combination of methods:\n   1. L2 (Layer 2) protocols (such as ARP (Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol),\n      PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), LLDP (Link Layer\
    \ Discovery\n      Protocol))\n   2. IP protocols (such as ICMP (Internet Control\
    \ Message Protocol),\n      IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), GRE (Generic\
    \ Routing\n      Encapsulation)\n   3. TCP or UDP ports (such as HTTP, Telnet,\
    \ FTP)\n   4. Application layer header (of the application to be identified)\n\
    \   5. Packet data content\n   6. Packets and traffic behavior\n   The exact application\
    \ identification methods are part of the Metering\n   Process internals that aim\
    \ to provide an accurate identification and\n   minimize false identification.\
    \  This task requires a sophisticated\n   Metering Process since the protocols\
    \ do not behave in a standard\n   manner.\n   1. Applications use port obfuscation\
    \ where the application runs on a\n      different port than the IANA assigned\
    \ one.  For example, an HTTP\n      server might run on TCP port 23 (assigned\
    \ to telnet in\n      [IANA-PORTS]).\n   2. IANA port registries do not accurately\
    \ reflect how certain ports\n      are \"commonly\" used today.  Some ports are\
    \ reserved, but the\n      application either never became prevalent or is not\
    \ in use today.\n   3. The application behavior and identification logic become\
    \ more and\n      more complex.\n   For that reason, such Metering Processes usually\
    \ detect applications\n   based on multiple mechanisms in parallel.  Detection\
    \ based only on\n   port matching might wrongly identify the application.  If\
    \ the\n   Metering Process is capable of detecting applications more\n   accurately,\
    \ it is considered to be stronger and more accurate.\n   Similarly, a reporting\
    \ mechanism that uses L4 port based applications\n   only, such as L4:<known port>,\
    \ would have similar issues.  The\n   reporting system should be capable of reporting\
    \ the applications\n   classified using all types of mechanisms.  In particular,\n\
    \   applications that do not have any IANA port definition.  While a\n   mechanism\
    \ to export application information should be defined, the L4\n   port being used\
    \ must be exported using the destination port\n   (destinationTransportPort at\
    \ [IANA-IPFIX]) in the corresponding IPFIX\n   record.\n   Applications could\
    \ be identified at different OSI layers, from layer\n   2 to layer 7.  For example,\
    \ the Link Layer Distribution Protocol\n   (LLDP) [LLDP] can be identified in\
    \ layer 2, ICMP can be identified in\n   layer 3 [IANA-PROTO], HTTP can be identified\
    \ in layer 4 [IANA-PORTS],\n   and Webex can be identified in layer 7.\n   While\
    \ an ideal solution would be an IANA registry for applications\n   above (or inside\
    \ the payload of) the well-known ports [IANA-PORTS],\n   this solution is not\
    \ always possible.  Indeed, the specifications for\n   some applications embedded\
    \ in the payload are not available.  Some\n   reverse engineering as well as a\
    \ ubiquitous language for application\n   identification would be required conditions\
    \ to be able to manage an\n   IANA registry for these types of applications. \
    \ Clearly, these are\n   blocking factors.\n   This document specifies the Cisco\
    \ Systems application information\n   encoding (as described in Section 4) to\
    \ export the application\n   information with the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101].  However,\
    \ the layer 7\n   application registry values are out of scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Application Information Use Cases
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Application Information Use Cases\n   There are several use cases for application\
    \ information:\n   1. Application Visibility\n      This is one of the main cases\
    \ for using application information.\n      Network administrators are using application\
    \ visibility to\n      understand the main network consumers, network trends,\
    \ and user\n      behavior.\n   2. Security Functions\n      Application knowledge\
    \ is sometimes used in security functions in\n      order to provide comprehensive\
    \ functions such as Application-based\n      firewall, URL filtering, parental\
    \ control, intrusion detection,\n      etc.\n   All of the above use cases require\
    \ exporting application information\n   to provide the network function itself\
    \ or to log the network function\n   operation.\n"

  - "2.  IPFIX Documents Overview\n   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] provides network\
    \ administrators with\n   access to IP Flow information.\n   The architecture\
    \ for the export of measured IP Flow information out\n   of an IPFIX Exporting\
    \ Process to a Collecting Process is defined in\n   the IPFIX Architecture [RFC5470],\
    \ per the requirements defined in RFC\n   3917 [RFC3917].\n   The IPFIX Architecture\
    \ [RFC5470] specifies how IPFIX Data Records and\n   Templates are carried via\
    \ a congestion-aware transport protocol from\n   IPFIX Exporting Processes to\
    \ IPFIX Collecting Processes.\n   IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information\
    \ Elements, their\n   names, types, and additional semantic information, as specified\
    \ in\n   the IPFIX information model [RFC5102].\n   In order to gain a level of\
    \ confidence in the IPFIX implementation,\n   probe the conformity and robustness,\
    \ and allow interoperability, the\n   Guidelines for IPFIX Testing [RFC5471] presents\
    \ a list of tests for\n   implementers of compliant Exporting Processes and Collecting\n\
    \   Processes.\n   The Bidirectional Flow Export [RFC5103] specifies a method\
    \ for\n   exporting bidirectional flow (biflow) information using the IPFIX\n\
    \   protocol, representing each biflow using a single Flow Record.\n   \"Reducing\
    \ Redundancy in IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) and Packet\n   Sampling (PSAMP)\
    \ Reports\" [RFC5473] specifies a bandwidth-saving\n   method for exporting Flow\
    \ or packet information, by separating\n   information common to several Flow\
    \ Records from information specific\n   to an individual Flow Record: common Flow\
    \ information is exported\n   only once.\n"

    \ manufacturer, the\n   PANA-L7-PEN MAY be used, specifying the manufacturer.\n\
    \   For example, if Exporter A (from enterprise-A) wants to export its\n   enterprise-A\
    \ L7 registry, then it uses the PANA-L7 Classification\n   Engine ID.  If Exporter\
    \ B (from enterprise-B) wants to export its\n   enterprise-B L7 registry, then\

    \ may classify the application according to another\n   vendor's application registry.\
    \  For example, an IPFIX Mediator\n   [RFC6183] may need to re-export applications\
    \ received from different\n   Exporters using different PANA-L7 application registries.\
    \  For\n   example, if Exporter C (from enterprise-C) wants to reuse enterprise-\n\
    \   D's application registry, then it uses PANA-L7-PEN with enterprise-\n   D's\
    \ PEN.\n   When reporting application information from multiple Exporters from\n\
    \   different enterprises (different PENs), the PANA-L7-PEN\n   Classification\
    \ Engine MUST be used in exported Flow Records, which\n   allows the original\
    \ enterprise ID to be reported.  The ID of the\n   enterprise that defined the\
    \ Application ID is identified by the\n   enterprise's PEN.  For example, an IPFIX\
    \ Mediator aggregates traffic\n   from some Exporters which report enterprise-E\
    \ applications and other\n   Exporters that report enterprise-F applications.\n\
    \   An example is displayed in Section 6.6.\n   Note that the PANA-L7 Classification\
    \ Engine ID is also used for\n   resolving IANA L4 port Discrepancies (see Section\

    \ to identify\n   what applications are used on the network.  Consequently, it\
    \ is\n   possible to identify what applications are being used by the users,\n\
    \   potentially threatening the privacy of those users, if not handled\n   with\
    \ great care.\n   As mentioned in Section 1.1, the application knowledge is useful\
    \ in\n   security based applications.  Security applications may impose\n   supplementary\
    \ requirements on the export of application information,\n   and these need to\
    \ be examined on a case by case basis.\n"
