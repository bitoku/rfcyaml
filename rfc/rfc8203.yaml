  - "1.  Introduction\n   It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-4
    [RFC4271]\n   session teardown in the network with a notice that was transmitted\n
    \  via offline methods such as email or telephone calls.  This document\n   updates
    [RFC4486] by specifying a mechanism to transmit a short\n   freeform UTF-8 [RFC3629]
    message as part of a Cease NOTIFICATION\n   message [RFC4271] to inform the peer
    why the BGP session is being\n   shutdown or reset.\n"

  - "2.  Shutdown Communication\n   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session
    with a BGP\n   neighbor, and it sends a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code\n
    \  \"Cease\" and Error Subcode \"Administrative Shutdown\" or\n   \"Administrative
    Reset\" [RFC4486], it MAY include an UTF-8 encoded\n   string.  The contents of
    the string are at the operator's discretion.\n   The Cease NOTIFICATION message
    with a Shutdown Communication is\n   encoded as below:\n    0                   1
    \                  2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

    \  /                 ... Shutdown Communication ...                /\n   \\                                                               \\\n

    1\n   Subcode:  the Error Subcode value MUST be one of the following\n      values:
    2 (\"Administrative Shutdown\") or 4 (\"Administrative\n      Reset\").\n   Length:
    \ this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown\n      Communication
    field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0\n      to 128 inclusive.
    \ When the length value is zero, no Shutdown\n      Communication field follows.\n
    \  Shutdown Communication:  to support international characters, the\n      Shutdown
    Communication field MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  A\n      receiving BGP speaker
    MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8 sequences.\n      Note that when the Shutdown
    Communication contains multibyte\n      characters, the number of characters will
    be less than the length\n      value.  This field is not NUL terminated.\n   Mechanisms
    concerning the reporting of information contained in the\n   Shutdown Communication
    are implementation specific but SHOULD include\n   methods such as Syslog [RFC5424].\n"
  title: 2.  Shutdown Communication

  - "3.  Operational Considerations\n   Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown
    Communication to inform\n   their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the
    BGP session and\n   include out-of-band reference materials.  An example of a
    useful\n   Shutdown Communication would be:\n   \"[TICKET-1-1438367390] software
    upgrade; back in 2 hours\"\n   \"[TICKET-1-1438367390]\" is a ticket reference
    with significance to\n   both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human-readable\n
    \  message regarding the reason for the BGP session shutdown followed by\n   an
    indication about the length of the maintenance.  The receiver can\n   now use
    the string 'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email\n   archive to find
    more details.\n"
  title: 3.  Operational Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Error Handling\n   If a Shutdown Communication with an invalid Length value,
    or an\n   invalid UTF-8 sequence is received, a message indicating this event\n
    \  SHOULD be logged for the attention of the operator.  An erroneous or\n   malformed
    Shutdown Communication itself MAY be logged in a hexdump\n   format.\n"
  title: 4.  Error Handling
- contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA references this document (in addition to [RFC4486])
    for subcodes\n   \"Administrative Shutdown\" (2) and \"Administrative Reset\"
    (4) in the\n   \"Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes\" registry under the \"Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters\" group.\n"
  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown
    Communication.\n   There are a number of security issues with Unicode.  Implementers
    and\n   operators are advised to review Unicode Technical Report #36 [UTR36]\n
    \  to learn about these issues.  UTF-8 \"Shortest Form\" encoding is\n   REQUIRED
    to guard against the technical issues outlined in [UTR36].\n   As BGP Shutdown
    Communications are likely to appear in syslog output,\n   there is a risk that
    carefully constructed Shutdown Communication\n   might be formatted by receiving
    systems in a way to make them appear\n   as additional syslog messages.  To limit
    the ability to mount such an\n   attack, the BGP Shutdown Communication is limited
    to 128 octets in\n   length.\n   Users of this mechanism should be aware that
    unless a transport that\n   provides integrity is used for the BGP session in
    question, a\n   Shutdown Communication message could be forged.  Unless a transport\n
    \  that provides confidentiality is used, a Shutdown Communication\n   message
    could be snooped by an attacker.  These issues are common to\n   any BGP message
    but may be of greater interest in the context of this\n   proposal since the information
    carried in the message is generally\n   expected to be used for human-to-human
    communication.  Refer to the\n   related considerations in [RFC4271] and [RFC4272].\n
    \  Users of this mechanism should consider applying data minimization\n   practices
    as outlined in Section 6.1 of [RFC6973] because a received\n   Shutdown Communication
    may be used at the receiver's discretion.\n"
