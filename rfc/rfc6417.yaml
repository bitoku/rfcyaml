- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The development of new technology is driven by scientific research.\n\
    \   The Internet, with its roots in the ARPANET and NSFNet, is\n   no exception.\
    \  Many of the fundamental, long-term improvements to the\n   architecture, security,\
    \ end-to-end protocols and management of the\n   Internet originate in the related\
    \ academic research communities.\n   Even shorter-term, more commercially driven\
    \ extensions are oftentimes\n   derived from academic research.  When interoperability\
    \ is required,\n   the IETF standardizes such new technology.  Timely and relevant\n\
    \   standardization benefits from continuous input and review from the\n   academic\
    \ research community.\n   For an individual researcher, it can however be quite\
    \ puzzling how to\n   begin to most effectively participate in the IETF and arguably\
    \ to a\n   much lesser degree, the IRTF.  The interactions in the IETF are\n \
    \  much different than those in academic conferences, and effective\n   participation\
    \ follows different rules.  The goal of this document is\n   to highlight such\
    \ differences and provide a rough guideline that will\n   hopefully enable researchers\
    \ new to the IETF to become successful\n   contributors more quickly.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In telecommunications, standards are essential.  More often\
    \ than not,\n   technology interoperability requires an agreement on a single\n\
    \   standard for a given problem.  However, unlike most research,\n   standards\
    \ developments are driven by particular real-world problems\n   and require solutions\
    \ that are not only theoretically correct, but\n   need to be implementable with\
    \ state-of-the-art technology in a cost-\n   effective manner, and must be incrementally\
    \ deployable in the actual\n   Internet by the involved stakeholders.  In other\
    \ words, standards\n   should be both theoretically correct and practically applicable.\
    \  In\n   the academic world, the former is often more important than the\n  \
    \ latter!\n   In the IETF, a practically applicable solution that has some well-\n\
    \   defined and acceptable deficiencies trumps a theoretically complete\n   and\
    \ optimal solution that cannot be deployed.  Likewise, a solution\n   to an interesting\
    \ theoretical problem that does not exist in the\n   deployed Internet at large\
    \ does not require urgent standardization.\n   Finally, standardization oftentimes\
    \ focuses on piecemeal improvements\n   to existing technology in order to enhance\
    \ secondary aspects, which\n   does not excite an academic researcher looking\
    \ to solve juicy\n   problems.\n   These differences between academic research\
    \ and Internet\n   standardization are the main reason why many researchers initially\n\
    \   struggle when they begin to participate in the IETF.  Symptoms of\n   this\
    \ struggle occur, for example:\n   o  for ideas that are too far outside the IETF's\
    \ areas of current\n      work\n   o  for ideas that are too high-level for the\
    \ IETF to begin protocol-\n      level work on\n   o  for proposals that solve\
    \ problems that are not expected to arise\n      for a very long time\n   o  if\
    \ there is a reluctance to give others a say in how a research\n      idea is\
    \ being made concrete, or giving over change control\n      entirely\n   o  if\
    \ there is a feeling that the IETF \"does not listen\" to them or\n      does\
    \ not have \"the right people\"\n   o  if there seems to be no working group or\
    \ other venue to bring the\n      work to\n   o  if the researchers are not interested\
    \ in topics such as security,\n      performance, and operational management --\
    \ topics that the IETF\n      will consider carefully\n   o  when the process\
    \ seems too time consuming\n   o  when the researchers do not have the resources\
    \ to keep the IETF\n      effort active for an extended period of time\n   o \
    \ if there is not a convincing enough argument for the IETF to start\n      working\
    \ on something, despite great simulation results\n   o  if the research idea is\
    \ just not implementable in today's Internet\n   This document attempts to give\
    \ some basic advice that researchers\n   might want to take into account when\
    \ deciding to approach the IETF\n   with their ideas, in order to improve their\
    \ success probability.  It\n   is intended to complement the more general advice\
    \ in [RFC4144] about\n   \"How to Gain Prominence and Influence in Standards Organizations\"\
    .\n   Other, more general advice and detailed explanations of the structure\n\
    \   and inner workings of the IETF can be found in \"The Tao of IETF\"\n   [RFC4677].\n\
    \   The authors have been involved in several research projects,\n   including\
    \ collaborative ones, which have sought to standardize some\n   of their results\
    \ at the IETF, and we hope to pass on some advice\n   (sometimes that we have\
    \ learned the hard way!).  The advice is split\n   into three groups: before you\
    \ approach the IETF; how to get the IETF\n   to start work on your proposal; and\
    \ finally how to increase the\n   chances of success once work has begun.\n"
- title: 2.  Is the IETF the Right Venue?
  contents:
  - "2.  Is the IETF the Right Venue?\n   A researcher should consider whether the\
    \ IETF is the right venue\n   before bringing a proposal to it.  A way to do so\
    \ is to imagine that\n   the IETF has standardized your proposal and it has been\
    \ deployed, and\n   ask yourself two questions:\n      1. How would the Internet\
    \ be better?\n      2. What Internet nodes would have been upgraded?\n   It is\
    \ very important to have a clear explanation about the motivation\n   for your\
    \ proposal: what would its benefits be?  What problem does it\n   solve?  Many\
    \ ideas do not bring a clear benefit to the Internet in\n   the near term (of\
    \ course they may still be fine pieces of research!).\n   In the past, the IETF\
    \ has often developed protocols that ended up not\n   being used, so it now thinks\
    \ harder about the benefits before\n   starting new work and makes sure that it\
    \ solves a current,\n   significant problem rather than one that may theoretically\
    \ arise in\n   the future.  It is best to be specific about what improvement your\n\
    \   proposal would make and the use cases in which this would be seen.\n   It\
    \ is also important to have a simple description of what additions\n   or changes\
    \ are needed and to which nodes (be they end-hosts, routers,\n   middleboxes,\
    \ etc.).  Is it substituting for an existing IETF protocol\n   or supplementing\
    \ one?  Again, it is best to be specific: Do both ends\n   need to adopt the new\
    \ protocol?  Can it fall back or interoperate\n   with the existing IETF protocol?\
    \  Do the \"first movers\" (the first\n   nodes that include your protocol) get\
    \ an improvement, or do the \"last\n   movers\" gain most?  What assumptions do\
    \ you make about the network or\n   host (perhaps that the host is multi-homed\
    \ or there are no\n   middleboxes on the path)?  While thinking about these things,\
    \ it is\n   also worthwhile considering operational practices and business\n \
    \  models.  If you will likely break some of these, you will inevitably\n   face\
    \ some opposition in the IETF.\n   If it is hard to answer these questions, it\
    \ may indicate that the\n   idea is too high-level or abstract for the IETF. \
    \ Then it may be\n   better to approach the IRTF (the research arm of the IETF);\
    \ the IETF\n   needs a specific protocol-level proposal before it can begin work,\n\
    \   while the IRTF considers work that is not yet mature enough for\n   standardization.\
    \  Another danger is that the IETF is the wrong\n   standards body, as a different\
    \ one would need to standardize your\n   proposal.\n   If your idea involves replacing\
    \ several IETF protocols and/or\n   upgrading several types of nodes simultaneously,\
    \ it is probably best\n   to rethink: the IETF finds it almost impossible to handle\
    \ radical,\n   \"clean slate\" proposals that change lots of things at once. \
    \ Perhaps\n   you can trim off a subset of your idea that's a smaller initial\
    \ step\n   requiring only an incremental change to an existing protocol, but you\n\
    \   need to consider whether it is still useful.\n   Finally, before bringing\
    \ a proposal to the IETF, you need to be aware\n   that there are intellectual\
    \ property implications.  For example, it\n   will affect any patents you want\
    \ to file.  Less obviously, you grant\n   the IETF the right to publish your contribution\
    \ and you should inform\n   the IETF if your proposal is covered by a patent.\
    \  For more\n   information about the rights you grant to the IETF, the best thing\
    \ to\n   read is the IETF's \"Note Well\" [NoteWell] and the documents linked\
    \ to\n   from there.\n"
- title: 3.  How to Get the IETF to Start Work on Your Proposal?
  contents:
  - "3.  How to Get the IETF to Start Work on Your Proposal?\n   Having decided that\
    \ the IETF is the right venue, you now need to\n   persuade the IETF to start\
    \ work on your idea.  We discuss three steps\n   that should help; they can be\
    \ done in parallel.  We then briefly\n   discuss how to form a new working group\
    \ (WG), if that is necessary.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Identify the Right Part of the IETF
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Identify the Right Part of the IETF\n   The IETF is a large organization;\
    \ therefore, you need to communicate\n   with the right part of it.  The IETF\
    \ is organized in areas such as\n   routing, security, or transport.  Within those\
    \ areas, working groups\n   are responsible for a specific topic.  The IETF consists\
    \ of over 100\n   WGs.  So, a good step is to identify whether there is already\
    \ a WG\n   suitable for your work.\n   If yes, then join the WG's mailing list\
    \ and send email and perhaps\n   write an Internet-Draft.  A WG's current set\
    \ of specific items is\n   defined in its \"Charter\"; be aware that if your proposal\
    \ falls\n   outside the WG's current charter, then it would have to be extended\n\
    \   before formal work could begin.  Most WGs think about re-chartering\n   every\
    \ year or two, although most allow for some limited discussion on\n   items outside\
    \ their current charter.\n   If no suitable WG exists, then you should identify\
    \ the right Area.\n   The WGs are clustered into \"Areas\" with a common theme\
    \ such as\n   security, with one or two Area Directors in charge of each Area.\
    \  You\n   may have to get a new WG created within the most relevant Area; this\n\
    \   is a significantly difficult step (see below).\n   Finding the right WG is\
    \ akin to finding the right conference or\n   journal to submit to.  While a poor\
    \ choice of conference will get\n   your paper rejected as irrelevant, the IETF\
    \ is friendlier, as most WG\n   Chairs and Area Directors will try to redirect\
    \ your work to a better\n   WG, if you choose poorly.  However, ending up with\
    \ the right \"venue\"\n   is critical, as only then will you collaborate with\
    \ the right group\n   of people.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Build a Community
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Build a Community\n   Standards require agreement and approval by a wide\
    \ range of people.\n   Therefore you need to persuade others of the merits of\
    \ your idea.  In\n   practice you need to go further and persuade others to do\
    \ work.  At a\n   minimum, this will be to thoroughly review your proposal and\n\
    \   preferably it will be to develop and test it with you.  The IETF\n   community\
    \ needs to see evidence of wider support, interest, and\n   commitment.  A lack\
    \ of reaction means work will not go forward\n   (silence is not consent!).  At\
    \ an early stage, support could be\n   demonstrated through comments on the mailing\
    \ list.  It is a very good\n   idea to have some Internet-Drafts jointly authored\
    \ with people from\n   beyond your research team, perhaps an industry player.\
    \  For example,\n   you could develop a \"use cases\" document with a \"user\"\
    , such as an\n   operator.\n   Working with others has the extra benefit that\
    \ it will help to\n   clarify your idea and explain better its benefits and how\
    \ it works.\n   There are many experts in the IETF who can help stress test the\
    \ idea\n   technically and advise about process and culture.  You need to get\n\
    \   some of them involved as early as possible.\n   It may well be worth trying\
    \ to hold an informal session at an IETF\n   meeting.  This can help build a community\
    \ of interest for your idea;\n   see the advice in [BAR-BOF].\n"
- title: 3.3.  Outline Your Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Outline Your Protocol\n   You also need to describe your proposal in a\
    \ way that others can\n   understand.  Your initial document should outline the\
    \ protocol.  It\n   is counter-productive to detail every aspect, unless the protocol\
    \ is\n   incredibly simple.  Firstly, too much detail swamps people with\n   information\
    \ that they cannot process.  Most people understand things\n   by learning about\
    \ them several times at increasing levels of detail.\n   Secondly, providing only\
    \ an outline makes people feel that they have\n   a chance of making worthwhile\
    \ suggestions and changes, so they are\n   more likely to actively engage with\
    \ you.  Thirdly, working out\n   details is generally something that a wider group\
    \ of people is better\n   at than an isolated individual.  Fourthly, in order\
    \ for the IETF to\n   start work, it is more important to convince the IETF that\
    \ there is a\n   problem that it needs to solve than to convince it about the\
    \ merits\n   of your solution.\n   A good idea is to document a \"protocol model\"\
    , as described in\n   [RFC4101]: \"a short description of the system in overview\
    \ form ... to\n   answer three basic questions: 1. What problem is the protocol\
    \ trying\n   to achieve?  2. What messages are being transmitted and what do they\n\
    \   mean?  3. What are the important, but unobvious, features of the\n   protocol?\"\
    \n   It is best to send your contributions in the form of an Internet-\n   Draft\
    \ (I-D).  While it may seem a burden to convert your nice paper\n   or slides\
    \ into the idiosyncratic format of an I-D, this is the format\n   that IETF people\
    \ are used to reading.  Also, extracting the IETF-\n   relevant parts of publications\
    \ into an I-D will often help to\n   identify aspects that need more work by the\
    \ IETF, such as protocol\n   details glossed over.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Establish a New Working Group
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Establish a New Working Group\n   You only need to establish a new WG if\
    \ the idea falls outside the\n   scope of existing WGs.  Establishing a new WG\
    \ nearly always requires\n   a specific session, called a \"BoF\" (Birds of a\
    \ Feather), at one of\n   the IETF's face-to-face meetings.  Here the pros and\
    \ cons of the\n   proposed WG are debated.  As part of the preparation for the\
    \ BoF, you\n   need to:\n   o  Build a community (see above)\n   o  Document the\
    \ benefits: for example, a problem statement and/or use\n      cases\n   o  Document\
    \ the architecture: for example covering assumptions and\n      requirements on\
    \ a solution\n   o  Suggest specific work items for the proposed WG, typically\
    \ the\n      protocol to be standardized and the supporting informational\n  \
    \    documents\n   Getting approval to hold a BoF and running a successful BoF\
    \ meeting\n   are both quite difficult.  Working with someone experienced and\n\
    \   reading the guidance in [RFC5434] are highly recommended.\n"

    \ Your Proposal\n   Congratulations, you got the IETF to agree to start working\

    \   section, we give some advice about ways of working that will increase\n  \
    \ the chances that the standardization runs smoothly.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Commit Enough Time, Energy, and Perseverance
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Commit Enough Time, Energy, and Perseverance\n   Those new to standards\
    \ bodies may be surprised how long and how much\n   effort it takes to standardize\
    \ something.\n   Success at the IETF requires active participation: to convince\
    \ others\n   your idea is worthwhile, to build momentum, to gain consensus.\n\
    \   Although IETF work is done mainly through mailing lists, in practice,\n  \
    \ face-to-face time is critical, especially for new or substantial\n   work. \
    \ If possible, go to the three IETF meetings a year.\n   It takes quite a long\
    \ time for a proposal to turn into an IETF\n   standard, even if the proposal\
    \ is mature when it is first presented.\n   There are many steps: building a community\
    \ of interest, convincing\n   the IETF to start work, working through suggestions\
    \ from technical\n   experts and incorporating their improvements, gaining consensus,\n\
    \   getting detailed reviews (any IETF publication gets significantly\n   more\
    \ reviews than an academic publication), going through the formal\n   IETF approval\
    \ process, and so on.  Even if you can work full time on\n   the proposal, effort\
    \ is required from other people who can't.  Also,\n   the IETF tends to work in\
    \ intensive bursts, with activity\n   concentrated in the run-up to and then at\
    \ the IETF meetings, with\n   lulls of low activity in between.\n   The IETF proceeds\
    \ by \"rough consensus\".  Unlike some other standards\n   bodies, there is no\
    \ voting and no top-down process from requirements\n   to architecture to protocol.\
    \  The downside of this is that the IETF\n   is not good at making decisions.\
    \  Hence you need to persevere and\n   guard against decisions unwinding.  On\
    \ the other hand, if the\n   consensus is to reject your proposal or there is\
    \ little interest in\n   it, persevering is likely to be a waste of time -- you\
    \ should\n   probably give up or restart at Section 2.\n   All this means that\
    \ it takes a considerable length of time to\n   complete something at the IETF.\
    \  Two years is probably a minimum.\n   So, although a typical three-year research\
    \ project sounds like plenty\n   of time to do standardization, if you haven't\
    \ already raised the idea\n   within the first year, you're probably too late\
    \ to complete\n   standardization before your project ends.  Since it's quite\
    \ likely\n   that IETF standardization won't be finished when your project ends,\n\
    \   it is particularly important to convince others to help, so that the\n   work\
    \ is more likely to be completed afterwards.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Be Open and Focus Out
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Be Open and Focus Out\n   It is helpful to come to the IETF with an open\
    \ mind-set.\n   Co-authorship is good.  Some standards bodies value trophy authors,\n\
    \   who indicate their support but don't actually do any work.  In the\n   IETF,\
    \ it is much better if co-authors are actually investing cycles\n   on developing\
    \ the proposal, whereas simple indications of support can\n   be made on the mailing\
    \ list or at the meetings.\n   In particular, if the IETF is going to standardize\
    \ something, then in\n   effect, it takes ownership; it is no longer \"yours\"\
    .  Indeed, a good\n   milestone of success is when your individual document becomes\
    \ a WG\n   draft, as then it is owned by the WG.  The research mentality is a\n\
    \   bit different, as it prizes authorship and confidentiality until\n   publication.\n\
    \   It is very important to be open to working with others.  One specific\n  \
    \ reason is to get help on aspects beyond your expertise or beyond what\n   you've\
    \ had time to think about -- perhaps how to make your protocol\n   more secure,\
    \ or how to ensure it is congestion-friendly, or how it\n   impacts network management.\
    \  The IETF ensures that any protocol it\n   standardizes has thought carefully\
    \ about such aspects.\n   Also, the IETF works by collaboration.  For example,\
    \ there may be two\n   proposals to solve a problem.  In academia their proponents\
    \ may treat\n   each other as rivals and for example write \"related work\" sections\n\
    \   that point out flaws and shortcomings of the opposition.  At the\n   IETF,\
    \ they will soon work together on a common document, typically a\n   synthesis\
    \ of the competing proposals, and be sensitive to each other\n   in order to help\
    \ build consensus.  You will also have to get support,\n   or at least not vehement\
    \ opposition, from IETF people working on\n   other topics.  So you need to be\
    \ aware of what else the IETF is doing\n   (in case your proposal conflicts) and\
    \ what other problems exist in\n   the Internet today (in case your proposal exacerbates\
    \ them).\n   Finally, collaborative research projects sometimes find it difficult\n\
    \   to be open to working with others.  Firstly, such projects typically\n   have\
    \ a consortium agreement about confidentiality -- it must not\n   prevent you\
    \ from engaging properly day-to-day with people outside the\n   project.  Secondly,\
    \ you may have to spend considerable effort on\n   intra-project coordination\
    \ -- but, an individual researcher only has\n   so much energy and enthusiasm\

- title: 4.3.  Seek Resolution, Not Perfection
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Seek Resolution, Not Perfection\n   The research mind-set is often to investigate\
    \ very thoroughly all\n   possible details about an idea -- to seek perfection\
    \ -- sometimes\n   with no particular deadline.  The IETF mind-set is to get something\n\
    \   done and out there that works, albeit imperfectly; if people find it\n   useful,\
    \ then there will be another iteration to improve it, probably\n   to meet needs\
    \ that only become apparent on widescale deployment.  The\n   philosophy is to\
    \ find a reasonable solution to the problem that\n   currently exists.  Time spent\
    \ over-optimizing may simply mean that\n   the solution has been superseded (perhaps\
    \ the problem has been solved\n   in some other way, or perhaps the problem was\
    \ so significant that a\n   different approach had to be found to avoid the problem).\n"
- title: 4.4.  Implement
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Implement\n   The IETF is very impressed by actual implementations: \"\
    running code\".\n   It helps smooth the standards process, it helps people believe\
    \ it\n   really works, and it helps you and others discover any issues.  An\n\
    \   implementation that others can download and try is extremely helpful\n   in\
    \ getting your protocol actually deployed -- presumably, that is\n   your real\
    \ objective, not simply to get an IETF standard!  In the\n   longer term, you\
    \ may need to think about how to get it incorporated\n   in the Linux kernel,\
    \ for instance.\n   Overall, it is very hard to get a protocol in actual widespread\
    \ use.\n   There are far more IETF protocols on paper than in use.\n"

  - "5.  Examples\n   In this section, we include some examples in which the authors\

    \ IETF.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Multipath TCP
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Multipath TCP\n   Multipath TCP (MPTCP) enables a regular TCP connection\
    \ to use\n   multiple paths simultaneously.  It extends TCP to allow the use of\n\
    \   multiple IP addresses by each endpoint.  This work is one output of\n   the\
    \ Trilogy research project which was brought to the IETF for\n   standardization,\
    \ and it is currently making good progress.  We\n   provide a brief overview of\
    \ the steps taken.\n   The first stage was doing some early socialization of the\
    \ main ideas\n   of MPTCP.  Presentations were made in several relevant WGs: the\n\
    \   Routing Research Group (July 2008) and the Transport Area Open\n   meeting\
    \ (July 2008 and March 2009).  In addition, a mailing list was\n   created, open\
    \ to anyone who was interested in discussing Multipath-\n   TCP-related issues\
    \ in the IETF context, and a public Web page was\n   created containing Multipath-TCP-related\
    \ material, including papers,\n   Internet-Drafts, presentations, and code.  The\
    \ feedback received was\n   encouraging enough to continue with the effort of\
    \ bringing the work\n   to the IETF.\n   Once we verified that the proposed ideas\
    \ had potential traction in\n   the IETF, the next step was to identify the proper\
    \ venue for the\n   proposed work.  There were two choices, namely, to go for\
    \ a BoF, with\n   a view to a new WG, or to try to add additional work items to\
    \ an\n   existing WG, in particular TCPM seemed a good candidate.  After\n   talking\
    \ to the Area Directors, it seemed that having a BoF was the\n   right approach,\
    \ at least for the initial discussion stage.  So, a BoF\n   proposal was submitted\
    \ to the Transport ADs for the IETF 75 meeting\n   held in Stockholm in July 2009.\
    \  The initial BoF proposal was crafted\n   by Trilogy people, but was sent to\
    \ the open mailing list for\n   discussion and modification from the rest of the\
    \ community.  The BoF\n   request was approved and the MPTCP BoF was held at the\
    \ IETF 75\n   meeting.\n   The general feedback received during the BoF was that\
    \ there was\n   enough interest and energy in the community to do this work within\n\
    \   the IETF.  A first charter draft was posted on the mailing list for\n   comments\
    \ a couple of months after the BoF.  After a month or so of\n   charter discussion\
    \ on the mailing list, the MPTCP working group was\n   created in October 2009.\
    \  The charter includes deliverables due to\n   March 2011.\n   The MPTCP working\
    \ group has, so far, made significant progress and\n   most of the milestones\
    \ have been delivered on schedule [MPTCP].\n"
- title: 5.2.  Congestion Exposure
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Congestion Exposure\n   Congestion Exposure enables sending end-hosts to\
    \ inform the network\n   about the congestion encountered by previous packets\
    \ on the same\n   flow.  This allows the network devices to act upon the congestion\n\
    \   information and the perceived user behavior.  Like the MPTCP work, it\n  \
    \ is an output of the Trilogy research project and has been\n   successfully brought\
    \ to the IETF.  We next describe the steps\n   followed to do so.\n   In this\
    \ case, early socialization included presentations at the\n   Internet Congestion\
    \ Control Research Group and the Internet Area\n   meeting at the IETF 75 meeting\
    \ in July 2009, the creation of an open\n   mailing list to discuss Congestion\
    \ Exposure related issues in the\n   IETF, and posting the related materials such\
    \ as papers, Internet\n   drafts, and code in a public web page.  In addition,\
    \ an informal,\n   open meeting (sometimes called a Bar-BoF in IETF parlance)\
    \ was held\n   during the IETF 75 meeting.\n   After processing the feedback received\
    \ in the Bar-BoF, a BoF proposal\n   was submitted to the Internet Area ADs for\
    \ the IETF 76 meeting in\n   November 2009.  The BoF was accepted and was held\
    \ as planned.  While\n   the feedback received in the BoF was positive, the IESG\
    \ was uncertain\n   about chartering a working group on this topic.  (The IESG\
    \ is the\n   IETF's management body and consists of all the Area Directors.) \
    \ In\n   order to address the remaining concerns of the IESG, another BoF was\n\
    \   held at the following IETF meeting.\n   After much debate, the CONEX WG was\
    \ approved by the IESG, but the\n   scope of its charter was limited compared\
    \ with the original proposal.\n   This was due to some concerns regarding the\
    \ proposed allocation of\n   the last bit in the IPv4 header.  The CONEX WG serves\
    \ as a good\n   example to illustrate the kind of compromise that is necessary\
    \ when\n   research aspiration meets Internet standardization.  The CONEX WG\n\
    \   [CONEX] held its first meeting at the IETF 78 meeting in July 2010.\n   Its\
    \ charter contains deliverables through November 2011.\n"
