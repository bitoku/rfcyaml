  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document analyzes the current state of the Intermediate\
    \ System\n   to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol according to the requirements\n\
    \   set forth in \"Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP)\n  \
    \ Design Guidelines\" [RFC6518] for both manual and automated key\n   management\
    \ protocols.\n   With currently published work, IS-IS meets some of the requirements\n\
    \   expected from a manually keyed routing protocol.  Integrity\n   protection\
    \ is expanded by allowing more cryptographic algorithms to\n   be used [RFC5310].\
    \  However, even with this expanded protection, only\n   limited algorithm agility\
    \ (HMAC-SHA family) is possible.  [RFC5310]\n   makes possible a basic form of\
    \ intra-connection rekeying, but with\n   some gaps as analyzed in Section 3 of\
    \ this document.\n   This document summarizes the current state of cryptographic\
    \ key usage\n   in the IS-IS protocol and several previous efforts that analyze\
    \ IS-IS\n   security.  This includes the base IS-IS specifications: [RFC1195],\n\
    \   [RFC5304], [RFC5310], and [RFC6039].\n   This document also analyzes various\
    \ threats to IS-IS (as described in\n   [RFC6862]), lists security gaps, and provides\
    \ specific\n   recommendations to thwart the threats for both manual keying and\n\
    \   automated key management mechanisms.\n"

  - "2.  Current State\n   IS-IS is specified in International Standards Organization\
    \ (ISO)\n   10589 [ISO10589], with extensions to support Internet Protocol\n \
    \  version 4 (IPv4) described in [RFC1195].  The specification includes\n   an\
    \ authentication mechanism that allows for any authentication\n   algorithm and\
    \ also specifies the algorithm for clear text passwords.\n   Further, [RFC5304]\
    \ extends the authentication mechanism to work with\n   HMAC-MD5 and also modifies\
    \ the base protocol for more effectiveness.\n   [RFC5310] provides algorithm agility,\
    \ with a new generic\n   cryptographic authentication mechanism (CRYPTO_AUTH)\
    \ for IS-IS.\n   CRYPTO_AUTH also introduces a Key ID mechanism that maps to unique\n\
    \   IS-IS SAs.\n   The following sections describe the current authentication\
    \ key usage\n   for various IS-IS messages, current key change methodologies,\
    \ and the\n   various potential security threats.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Key Usage
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Key Usage\n   IS-IS can be provisioned with a per-interface, peer-to-peer\
    \ key for\n   IIH PDUs and a group key for LSPs and SNPs.  If provisioned, IIH\n\
    \   packets can potentially use the same group key used for LSPs and\n   SNPs.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Subnetwork Independent
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Subnetwork Independent\n   Link State PDUs, Complete and partial Sequence\
    \ Number PDUs come under\n   Sub network Independent messages.  For protecting\
    \ Level-1 SNPs and\n   Level-1 LSPs, provisioned Area Authentication key is used.\
    \  Level-2\n   SNPs as well as Level-2 LSPs use the provisioned domain\n   authentication\
    \ key.\n   Because authentication is performed on the LSPs transmitted by an IS,\n\
    \   rather than on the LSP packets transmitted to a specific neighbor, it\n  \
    \ is implied that all the ISes within a single flooding domain must be\n   configured\
    \ with the same key in order for authentication to work\n   correctly.  This is\
    \ also true for SNP packets, though they are\n   limited to link-local scope in\
    \ broadcast networks.\n   If multiple instances share the circuits as specified\
    \ in [RFC6822],\n   instance-specific authentication credentials can be used to\
    \ protect\n   the LSPs and SNPs within an area or domain.  It is important to\
    \ note\n   that [RFC6822] also allows usage of topology-specific authentication\n\
    \   credentials within an instance for the LSPs and SNPs.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Subnetwork Dependent
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Subnetwork Dependent\n   IIH PDUs use the Link Level Authentication key,\
    \ which may be\n   different from that of LSPs and SNPs.  This could be particularly\n\
    \   true for point-to-point links.  In broadcast networks, it is possible\n  \
    \ to provision the same common key used for LSPs and SNPs to protect\n   IIH messages.\
    \  This allows neighbor discovery and adjacency formation\n   with more than one\
    \ neighbor on the same physical interface.  If\n   multiple instances share the\
    \ circuits as specified in [RFC6822],\n   instance-specific authentication credentials\
    \ can be used to protect\n   Hello messages.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Key Agility
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Key Agility\n   Key roll over without effecting the routing protocols operation\
    \ in\n   general and IS-IS in particular is necessary for effective key\n   management\
    \ protocol integration.\n   Current HMAC-MD5 cryptographic authentication as defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC5304], suggests a transition mode so that ISes use a set of keys\n\
    \   when verifying the authentication value to allow key changes.  This\n   approach\
    \ will allow changing the authentication key manually without\n   bringing down\
    \ the adjacency and without dropping any control packet.\n   But, this can increase\
    \ the load on the control plane for the key\n   transition duration, as each control\
    \ packet may have to be verified\n   by more than one key, and it also allows\
    \ a potential DoS attack in\n   the transition duration.\n   The above situation\
    \ is improved with the introduction of the Key ID\n   mechanism as defined in\
    \ [RFC5310].  With this, the receiver\n   determines the active SA by looking\
    \ at the Key ID field in the\n   incoming PDU and need not try with other keys\
    \ when the integrity\n   check or digest verification fails.  But, neither key\
    \ coordination\n   across the group nor an exact key change mechanism is clearly\n\
    \   defined.  [RFC5310] says:\n      Normally, an implementation would allow the\
    \ network operator to\n      configure a set of keys in a key chain, with each\
    \ key in the chain\n      having a fixed lifetime.  The actual operation of these\
    \ mechanisms\n      is outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Security Issues
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Security Issues\n   The following section analyzes various possible security\
    \ threats in\n   the current state of the IS-IS protocol.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Replay Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Replay Attacks\n   Replaying a captured protocol packet to cause damage\
    \ is a common\n   threat for any protocol.  Securing the packet with cryptographic\n\
    \   authentication information alone cannot mitigate this threat\n   completely.\
    \  Though this problem is more prevalent in broadcast\n   networks, it is important\
    \ to note that most of the IGP deployments\n   use P2P-over-lan circuits [RFC5309],\
    \ which makes it possible for an\n   adversary to replay an IS-IS PDU more easily\
    \ than the traditional P2P\n   networks.\n   In intra-session replay attacks,\
    \ a secured protocol packet of the\n   current session that is replayed can cause\
    \ damage, if there is no\n   other mechanism to confirm this is a replay packet.\
    \  In inter-session\n   replay attacks, a captured packet from one of the previous\
    \ sessions\n   can be replayed to cause damage.  IS-IS packets are vulnerable\
    \ to\n   both of these attacks, as there is no sequence number verification\n\
    \   for IIH and SNP packets.  Also with current manual key management,\n   periodic\
    \ key changes across the group are rarely done.  Thus, the\n   intra-connection\
    \ and inter-connection replay requirements are not\n   met.\n   IS-IS specifies\
    \ the use of the HMAC-MD5 [RFC5304] and HMAC-SHA-1\n   family in [RFC5310] to\
    \ protect IS-IS packets.  An adversary could\n   replay old IIHs or replay old\
    \ SNPs that would cause churn in the\n   network or bring down the adjacencies.\n\
    \   1. At the time of adjacency bring up an IS sends IIH packet with\n      empty\
    \ neighbor list (TLV 6) and with the authentication\n      information as per\
    \ the provisioned authentication mechanism.  If\n      this packet is replayed\
    \ later on the broadcast network, all ISes\n      in the broadcast network can\
    \ bounce the adjacency to create a huge\n      churn in the network.\n   2. Today,\
    \ LSPs have intra-session replay protection as the LSP header\n      contains\
    \ a 32-bit sequence number, which is verified for every\n      received packet\
    \ against the local LSP database.  But, if a node in\n      the network is out\
    \ of service (is undergoing some sort of high\n      availability condition or\
    \ an upgrade) for more than LSP refresh\n      time and the rest of the network\
    \ ages out the LSPs of the node\n      under consideration, an adversary can potentially\
    \ plunge in inter-\n      session replay attacks in the network.  If the key is\
    \ not changed\n      in the above circumstances, attack can be launched by replaying\
    \ an\n      old LSP with a higher sequence number and fewer prefixes or fewer\n\
    \      adjacencies.  This may force the receiver to accept and remove the\n  \
    \    routes from the routing table, which eventually causes traffic\n      disruption\
    \ to those prefixes.  However, as per the IS-IS\n      specification, there is\
    \ a built-in recovery mechanism for LSPs\n      from inter-session replay attacks\
    \ and it is further discussed in\n      Section 2.3.1.1.\n   3. In any IS-IS network\
    \ (broadcast or otherwise), if an old and an\n      empty Complete Sequence Number\
    \ Packet (CSNP) is replayed, this can\n      cause LSP flood in the network. \
    \ Similarly, a replayed Partial\n      Sequence Number Packet (PSNP) can cause\
    \ LSP flood in the broadcast\n      network.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.1.  Current Recovery Mechanism for LSPs
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.1.  Current Recovery Mechanism for LSPs\n   In the event of inter-session\
    \ replay attack by an adversary, as an\n   LSP with a higher sequence number gets\
    \ accepted, it also gets\n   propagated until it reaches the originating node\
    \ of the LSP.  The\n   originator recognizes the LSP is \"newer\" than in the\
    \ local database,\n   which prompts the originator to flood a newer version of\
    \ the LSP with\n   a higher sequence number than that received.  This newer version\
    \ can\n   potentially replace any versions of the replayed LSP that may exist\n\
    \   in the network.\n   However, in the above process, depending on where in the\
    \ network the\n   replay is initiated, how quickly the nodes in the network react\
    \ to\n   the replayed LSP, and how different the content in the accepted LSP\n\
    \   is determines the damage caused by the replayed LSP.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Spoofing Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Spoofing Attacks\n   IS-IS shares the same key between all neighbors\
    \ in an area or in a\n   domain to protect the LSP, SNP packets, and in broadcast\
    \ networks\n   even IIH packets.  False advertisement by a router is not within\
    \ the\n   scope of the KARP work.  However, given the wide sharing of keys as\n\
    \   described above, there is a significant risk that an attacker can\n   compromise\
    \ a key from one device and use it to falsely participate in\n   the routing,\
    \ possibly even in a very separate part of the network.\n   If the same underlying\
    \ topology is shared across multiple instances\n   to transport routing/application\
    \ information as defined in [RFC6822],\n   it is necessary to use different authentication\
    \ credentials for\n   different instances.  In this connection, based on the deployment\n\
    \   considerations, if certain topologies in a particular IS-IS instance\n   require\
    \ more protection from spoofing attacks and less exposure,\n   topology-specific\
    \ authentication credentials can be used for LSPs and\n   SNPs as facilitated\
    \ in [RFC6822].\n   Currently, possession of the key itself is used as an authentication\n\
    \   check and there is no identity check done separately.  Spoofing\n   occurs\
    \ when an illegitimate device assumes the identity of a\n   legitimate one.  An\
    \ attacker can use spoofing to launch various types\n   of attacks, for example:\n\
    \   1. The attacker can send out unrealistic routing information that\n      might\
    \ cause the disruption of network services, such as block\n      holes.\n   2.\
    \ A rogue system that has access to the common key used to protect\n      the\
    \ LSP can flood an LSP by setting the Remaining Lifetime field\n      to zero,\
    \ thereby initiating a purge.  Subsequently, this can cause\n      the sequence\
    \ number of all the LSPs to increase quickly to max out\n      the sequence number\
    \ space, which can cause an IS to shut down for\n      MaxAge + ZeroAgeLifetime\
    \ period to allow the old LSPs to age out\n      in other ISes of the same flooding\
    \ domain.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  DoS Attacks
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  DoS Attacks\n   DoS attacks using the authentication mechanism is possible\
    \ and an\n   attacker can send packets that can overwhelm the security mechanism\n\
    \   itself.  An example is initiating an overwhelming load of spoofed but\n  \
    \ integrity-protected protocol packets, so that the receiver needs to\n   process\
    \ the integrity check, only to discard the packet.  This can\n   cause significant\
    \ CPU usage.  DoS attacks are not generally\n   preventable within the routing\
    \ protocol.  As the attackers are often\n   remote, the DoS attacks are more damaging\
    \ to area-scoped or domain-\n   scoped packet receivers than link-local-scoped\
    \ packet receivers.\n"
- title: 3.  Gap Analysis and Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Gap Analysis and Security Requirements\n   This section outlines the differences\
    \ between the current state of\n   the IS-IS routing protocol and the desired\
    \ state as specified in the\n   KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].  This section\
    \ focuses on where the\n   IS-IS protocol fails to meet general requirements as\
    \ specified in the\n   threats and requirements document [RFC6862].\n   This section\
    \ also describes security requirements that should be met\n   by IS-IS implementations\
    \ that are secured by manual as well as\n   automated key management protocols.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Manual Key Management
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Manual Key Management\n   1. With CRYPTO_AUTH specification [RFC5310],\
    \ IS-IS packets can be\n      protected with the HMAC-SHA family of cryptographic\
    \ algorithms.\n      The specification provides limited algorithm agility (SHA\
    \ family).\n      By using Key IDs, it also conceals the algorithm information\
    \ from\n      the protected control messages.\n   2. Even though both intra- and\
    \ inter-session replay attacks are best\n      prevented by deploying key management\
    \ protocols with frequent key\n      change capability, basic constructs for the\
    \ sequence number should\n      be in the protocol messages.  So, some basic or\
    \ extended sequence\n      number mechanism should be in place to protect IIH\
    \ packets and SNP\n      packets.  The sequence number should be increased for\
    \ each\n      protocol packet.  This allows mitigation of some of the replay\n\
    \      threats as mentioned in Section 2.3.1.\n   3. Any common key mechanism\
    \ with keys shared across a group of\n      routers is susceptible to spoofing\
    \ attacks caused by a malicious\n      router.  A separate authentication check\
    \ (apart from the integrity\n      check to verify the digest) with digital signatures\
    \ as described\n      in [RFC2154] can effectively nullify this attack.  But this\n\
    \      approach was never deployed, which we assume is due to operational\n  \
    \    considerations at that time.  The alternative approach to thwart\n      this\
    \ threat would be to use the keys from the group key management\n      protocol.\
    \  As the group key(s) are generated by authenticating the\n      member ISes\
    \ in the group first and are then periodically rekeyed,\n      per-packet identity\
    \ or authentication checks may not be needed.\n   4. In general, DoS attacks may\
    \ not be preventable with the mechanism\n      from the routing protocol itself.\
    \  But some form of admin-\n      controlled lists at the forwarding plane can\
    \ reduce the damage.\n      There are some other forms of DoS attacks common to\
    \ any protocol\n      that are not in scope per Section 3.3 of [RFC6862].\n  \
    \ As discussed in Section 2.2, though the Key ID mechanism described in\n   [RFC5310]\
    \ helps, a better key coordination mechanism for key roll\n   over is desirable\
    \ even with manual key management.  But, [RFC5310]\n   does not specify the exact\
    \ mechanism other than requiring use of key\n   chains.  The specific requirements\
    \ are as follows:\n   a. Keys SHOULD be able to change without effecting the established\n\
    \      adjacency, ideally without any control packet loss.\n   b. Keys SHOULD\
    \ be able to change without effecting the protocol\n      operations; for example,\
    \ LSP flooding should not be held for a\n      specific Key ID availability.\n\
    \   c. Any proposed mechanism SHOULD also be incrementally deployable\n      with\
    \ key management protocols.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Key Management Protocols\n   In broadcast deployments, the keys used for\

    \  The\n   deployed group key management protocol SHOULD support rekeying.\n \
    \  In some deployments, where IS-IS point-to-point (P2P) mode is used\n   for\
    \ adjacency bring-up, subnetwork-dependent messages (e.g., IIHs)\n   can use a\
    \ different key shared between the two P2P peers, while all\n   other messages\
    \ use a group key.  When a group keying mechanism is\n   deployed, even the P2P\
    \ IIHs can be protected with the common group\n   keys.  This approach facilitates\
    \ one key management mechanism instead\n   of both pair-wise keying and group\
    \ keying protocols being deployed\n   together.  If the same circuits are shared\
    \ across multiple instances,\n   the granularity of the group can become per instance\
    \ for IIHs and per\n   instance/topology for LSPs and SNPs as specified in [RFC6822].\n\
    \   Effective key change capability within the routing protocol that\n   allows\
    \ key roll over without impacting the routing protocol operation\n   is one of\
    \ the requirements for deploying any group key mechanism.\n   Once such mechanism\
    \ is in place with the deployment of group key\n   management protocol; IS-IS\
    \ can be protected from various threats and\n   is not limited to intra- and inter-session\
    \ replay attacks and\n   spoofing attacks.\n   Specific use of cryptographic tables\
    \ [RFC7210] should be defined for\n   the IS-IS protocol.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document is mostly about security considerations\
    \ of the IS-IS\n   protocol, and it lists potential threats and security requirements\n\
    \   for mitigating these threats.  This document does not introduce any\n   new\
    \ security threats for the IS-IS protocol.  In view of openly\n   published attack\
    \ vectors, as noted in Section 1 of [RFC5310] on HMAC-\n   MD5 cryptographic authentication\
    \ mechanism, IS-IS deployments SHOULD\n   use the HMAC-SHA family [RFC5310] instead\
    \ of HMAC-MD5 [RFC5304] to\n   protect IS-IS PDUs.  For more detailed security\
    \ considerations,\n   please refer the Security Considerations section of the\
    \ IS-IS Generic\n   Cryptographic Authentication [RFC5310], the KARP Design Guide\n\
    \   [RFC6518] document, as well as the KARP threat document [RFC6862].\n"
