  - "Abstract\n   The first RFC that describes an RTP payload format for ITU\n   Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendation H.263\n   is RFC 2190.  This specification\
    \ discusses why to move RFC 2190 to\n   historic status.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ITU-T recommendation H.263 [H263] specifies the encoding\
    \ used by\n   ITU-T-compliant video-conference codecs.  The first version (version\n\
    \   1) was approved in 1996 by the ITU, and a payload format for\n   encapsulating\
    \ this H.263 bitstream in the Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (RTP) is in RFC\
    \ 2190 [RFC2190].  In 1998 the ITU approved a\n   new version of H.263 [H263P]\
    \ that is also known as H.263 plus.  This\n   version added optional features,\
    \ and a new payload format is now in\n   RFC 2429 [RFC2429].  RFC 2429 is capable\
    \ of carrying encoded video\n   bit streams that are using only the basic H.263\
    \ version 1 options.\n   RFC 2429 [RFC2429] states that it does not replace RFC\
    \ 2190, which\n   continues to be used by existing implementations and may be\
    \ required\n   for backward compatibility in new implementations.  Implementations\n\
    \   using the new features of the 1998 version of H.263 and later\n   versions\
    \ shall use the format described in RFC 2429.\n   RFC 2429 is now being revised\
    \ and will include language that will\n   make it clear that all new implementations\
    \ MUST use RFC 4629\n   [RFC4629] for encoding of any version of H.263.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119] and\n   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendation\n   RFC 2429 and RFC 4629 [RFC4629] can be used to carry new\
    \ H.263\n   payloads even if they are using only the features defined in the 1996\n\
    \   version.  All the H.263 features that are part of the 1996 version\n   are\
    \ also part of the 1998 version and later versions.\n   It is recommended that\
    \ RFC 2190 be moved to historic status and that,\n   as stated in RFC 4629 [RFC4629],\
    \ new implementations use the RFC 4629\n   and the H263-1998 and H263-2000 Media\
    \ Types.\n   This recommendation will come into effect at the publication or as\n\
    \   soon as possible after the publication of RFC 4629 [RFC4629].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the H263 video RTP\
    \ payload can be found\n   in the RFC 4629 [RFC4629].  Using the payload specification\
    \ in RFC\n   4629 instead of that in RFC 2190 does not affect the security\n \
    \  consideration since both of them refer to RFC 3550 [RFC3550] and RFC\n   3551\
    \ [RFC3551] for security considerations.\n"
