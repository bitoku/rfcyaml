  - "Abstract\n   This registers seven new mail transmission types (ESMTPA, ESMTPS,\n\
    \   ESMTPSA, LMTP, LMTPA, LMTPS, LMTPSA) for use in the \"with\" clause of\n \
    \  a Received header in an Internet message.\n"
- title: 1.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "1.  IANA Considerations\n   As directed by SMTP [2], IANA maintains a registry\
    \ [7] of \"WITH\n   protocol types\" for use in the \"with\" clause of the Received\
    \ header\n   in an Internet message.  This registry presently includes SMTP [6],\n\
    \   and ESMTP [2].  This specification updates the registry as follows:\n   o\
    \  The new keyword \"ESMTPA\" indicates the use of ESMTP when the SMTP\n     \
    \ AUTH [3] extension is also used and authentication is successfully\n      achieved.\n\
    \   o  The new keyword \"ESMTPS\" indicates the use of ESMTP when STARTTLS\n \
    \     [1] is also successfully negotiated to provide a strong transport\n    \
    \  encryption layer.\n   o  The new keyword \"ESMTPSA\" indicates the use of ESMTP\
    \ when both\n      STARTTLS and SMTP AUTH are successfully negotiated (the\n \
    \     combination of ESMTPS and ESMTPA).\n   o  The new keyword \"LMTP\" indicates\
    \ the use of LMTP [4].\n   o  The new keyword \"LMTPA\" indicates the use of LMTP\
    \ when the SMTP\n      AUTH extension is also used and authentication is successfully\n\
    \      achieved.\n   o  The new keyword \"LMTPS\" indicates the use of LMTP when\
    \ STARTTLS is\n      also successfully negotiated to provide a strong transport\n\
    \      encryption layer.\n   o  The new keyword \"LMTPSA\" indicates the use of\
    \ LMTP when both\n      STARTTLS and SMTP AUTH are successfully negotiated (the\n\
    \      combination of LSMTPS and LSMTPA).\n   o  The references for the ESMTP\
    \ and SMTP entries in the registry\n      should be updated to the latest specification\
    \ [2] since both RFC\n      821 and RFC 1869 [5] are obsoleted by RFC 2821.\n"
- title: 2.  Implementation Experience
  contents:
  - "2.  Implementation Experience\n   The ESMTPA, ESMTPS and ESMTPSA keywords have\
    \ been implemented in\n   deployed email server software for several years and\
    \ no problems have\n   been reported with their use.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Use of these additional keywords provides trace\
    \ information to\n   indicate when various high-level security framing protocols\
    \ are used\n   for hop-to-hop transport of email without exposing details of the\n\
    \   specifics of the security mechanism.  This trace information provides\n  \
    \ an informal way to track the deployment of these mechanisms on the\n   Internet\
    \ and can assist after-the-fact diagnosis of email abuse.\n   These keywords are\
    \ not normally protected in transport which means\n   they can be modified by\
    \ an active attacker.  They also do not\n   indicate the specifics of the mechanism\
    \ used, and therefore do not\n   provide any real-world security assurance.  They\
    \ should not be used\n   for mail filtering or relaying decisions except in very\
    \ controlled\n   environments.  As they are both cryptic and hidden in trace headers\n\
    \   used primarily to diagnose email problems, it is not expected they\n   will\
    \ mislead end users with a false sense of security.  Information\n   with a higher\
    \ degree of reliability can be obtained by correlating\n   the Received headers\
    \ with the logs of the various Mail Transfer\n   Agents through which the message\
    \ passed.\n   The trace information provided by these keywords and other parts\
    \ of\n   the Received header provide a significant benefit when doing after-\n\
    \   the-fact diagnosis of email abuse or problems.  Unfortunately, some\n   people\
    \ in a misguided attempt to hide information about their\n   internal servers\
    \ will strip Received headers of useful information\n   and reduce their ability\
    \ to correct security abuses after they\n   happen.  The result of such misguided\
    \ efforts is usually a reduction\n   of the overall security of the systems.\n"
