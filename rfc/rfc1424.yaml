- title: 1. Executive Summary
  contents:
  - "1. Executive Summary\n   This document describes three types of service in support\
    \ of Internet\n   Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) [1-3]: key certification, certificate-\n\
    \   revocation list (CRL) storage, and CRL retrieval. Such services are\n   among\
    \ those required of an RFC 1422 [2] certification authority.\n   Other services\
    \ such as certificate revocation and certificate\n   retrieval are left to the\
    \ certification authority to define, although\n   they may be based on the services\
    \ described in this document.\n   Each service involves an electronic-mail request\
    \ and an electronic-\n   mail reply. The request is either an RFC 1421 [1] privacy-enhanced\n\
    \   message or a message with a new syntax defined in this document. The\n   new\
    \ syntax follows the general RFC 1421 syntax but has a different\n   process type,\
    \ thereby distinguishing it from ordinary privacy-\n   enhanced messages. The\
    \ reply is either an RFC 1421 privacy-enhanced\n   message, or an ordinary unstructured\
    \ message.\n   Replies that are privacy-enhanced messages can be processed like\
    \ any\n   other privacy-enhanced message, so that the new certificate or the\n\
    \   retrieved CRLs can be inserted into the requestor's database during\n   normal\
    \ privacy-enhanced mail processing.\n   Certification authorities may also require\
    \ non-electronic forms of\n   request and may return non-electronic replies. It\
    \ is expected that\n   descriptions of such forms, which are outside the scope\
    \ of this\n   document, will be available through a certification authority's\n\
    \   \"information\" service.\n"
- title: 2. Overview of Services
  contents:
  - "2. Overview of Services\n   This section describes the three services in general\
    \ terms.\n   The electronic-mail address to which requests are sent is left to\
    \ the\n   certification authority to specify. It is expected that certification\n\
    \   authorities will advertise their addresses as part of an\n   \"information\"\
    \ service. Replies are sent to the address in the\n   \"Reply-To:\" field of the\
    \ request, and if that field is omitted, to\n   the address in the \"From:\" field.\n"
- title: 2.1 Key Certification
  contents:
  - "2.1 Key Certification\n   The key-certification service signs a certificate containing\
    \ a\n   specified subject name and public key. The service takes a\n   certification\
    \ request (see Section 3.1), signs a certificate\n   constructed from the request,\
    \ and returns a certification reply (see\n   Section 3.2) containing the new certificate.\n\
    \   The certification request specifies the requestor's subject name and\n   public\
    \ key in the form of a self-signed certificate. The\n   certification request\
    \ contains two signatures, both computed with the\n   requestor's private key:\n\
    \     1.   The signature on the self-signed certificate, having the\n        \
    \  cryptographic purpose of preventing a requestor from\n          requesting\
    \ a certificate with another party's public key.\n          (See Section 4.)\n\
    \     2.   A signature on some encapsulated text, having the\n          practical\
    \ purpose of allowing the certification authority\n          to construct an ordinary\
    \ RFC 1421 privacy-enhanced\n          message as a reply, with user-friendly\
    \ encapsulated text.\n          (RFC 1421 does not provide for messages with\n\
    \          certificates but no encapsulated text; and the self-\n          signed\
    \ certificate is not \"user friendly\" text.) The text\n          should be something\
    \ innocuous like \"Hello world!\"\n   A requestor would typically send a certification\
    \ request after\n   generating a public-key/private-key pair, but may also do\
    \ so after a\n   change in the requestor's distinguished name.\n   A certification\
    \ authority signs a certificate only if both signatures\n   in the certification\
    \ request are valid.\n   The new certificate contains the subject name and public\
    \ key from the\n   self-signed certificate, and an issuer name, serial number,\
    \ validity\n   period, and signature algorithm of the certification authority's\n\
    \   choice. (The validity period may be derived from the self-signed\n   certificate.)\
    \ Following RFC 1422, the issuer may be any whose\n   distinguished name is superior\
    \ to the subject's distinguished name,\n   typically the one closest to the subject.\
    \ The certification authority\n   signs the certificate with the issuer's private\
    \ key, then transforms\n   the request into a reply containing the new certificate\
    \ (see Section\n   3.2 for details).\n   The certification reply includes a certification\
    \ path from the new\n   certificate to the RFC 1422 Internet certification authority.\
    \ It may\n   also include other certificates such as cross-certificates that the\n\
    \   certification authority considers helpful to the requestor.\n"
- title: 2.2 CRL Storage
  contents:
  - "2.2 CRL Storage\n   The CRL storage service stores CRLs. The service takes a\
    \ CRL-storage\n   request (see Section 3.3) specifying the CRLs to be stored,\
    \ stores\n   the CRLs, and returns a CRL-storage reply (see Section 3.4)\n   acknowledging\
    \ the request.\n   The certification authority stores a CRL only if its signature\
    \ and\n   certification path are valid, following concepts in RFC 1422\n   (Although\
    \ a certification path is not required in a CRL-storage\n   request, it may help\
    \ the certification authority validate the CRL.)\n"
- title: 2.3 CRL Retrieval
  contents:
  - "2.3 CRL Retrieval\n   The CRL retrieval service retrieves the latest CRLs of\
    \ specified\n   certificate issuers. The service takes a CRL-retrieval request\
    \ (see\n   Section 3.5), retrieves the latest CRLs the request specifies, and\n\
    \   returns a CRL-retrieval reply (see Section 3.6) containing the CRLs.\n   There\
    \ may be more than one \"latest\" CRL for a given issuer, if that\n   issuer has\
    \ more than one public key (see RFC 1422 for details).\n   The CRL-retrieval reply\
    \ includes a certification path from each\n   retrieved CRL to the RFC 1422 Internet\
    \ certification authority. It\n   may also include other certificates such as\
    \ cross-certificates that\n   the certification authority considers helpful to\
    \ the requestor.\n"

  - "Security Considerations\n   The self-signed certificate (Section 3.1) prevents\

    \ Such an\n   attack would give the requestor the minor ability to pretend to\
    \ be\n   the originator of any message signed by the other party. This attack\n\
    \   is significant only if the requestor does not know the message being\n   signed,\
    \ and the signed part of the message does not identify the\n   signer. The requestor\
    \ would still not be able to decrypt messages\n   intended for the other party,\
    \ of course.\n"
