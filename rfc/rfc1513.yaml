  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines extensions to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB\
    \ for\n   managing 802.5 Token Ring networks.\n   The Remote Network Monitoring\
    \ MIB, RFC 1271, defines a framework for\n   remote monitoring functions implemented\
    \ on a network probe.  That MIB\n   defines objects broken down into nine functional\
    \ groups.  Some of\n   those functional groups, the statistics and the history\
    \ groups, have\n   a view of the data-link layer that is specific to the media\
    \ type and\n   require specific objects to be defined for each media type.  RFC\
    \ 1271\n   defined those specific objects necessary for Ethernet.  This\n   companion\
    \ memo defines those specific objects necessary for Token\n   Ring LANs.\n   In\
    \ addition, this memo defines some additional monitoring functions\n   specifically\
    \ for Token Ring.  These are defined in the Ring Station\n   Group, the Ring Station\
    \ Order Group, the Ring Station Configuration\n   Group, and the Source Routing\
    \ Statistics Group.\n"

- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16, RFC 1155\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used\n      for describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.\n      STD 16, RFC 1212 [2] defines a\
    \ more concise description mechanism,\n      which is wholly consistent with the\
    \ SMI.\n      STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n\
    \      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.\n      STD 15, RFC 1157 [4]\
    \ which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for\n      network access to managed\
    \ objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n   Managed objects are accessed via\
    \ a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.\
    \  Within a given MIB module,\n   objects are defined using STD 16, RFC 1212's\
    \ OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a\n   minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level,\
    \ and an\n   implementation-status.\n   The name is an object identifier, an administratively\
    \ assigned name,\n   which specifies an object type.  The object type together\
    \ with an\n   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation\n\
    \   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,\n  \
    \ termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax\
    \ of an object type defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that\
    \ object type.  The ASN.1[5] language is used for\n   this purpose.  However,\
    \ STD 16, RFC 1155 purposely restricts the\n   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.\
    \  These restrictions are\n   explicitly made for simplicity.\n   The access-level\
    \ of an object type defines whether it makes \"protocol\n   sense\" to read and/or\
    \ write the value of an instance of the object\n   type.  (This access-level is\
    \ independent of any administrative\n   authorization policy.)\n   The implementation-status\
    \ of an object type indicates whether the\n   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete,\
    \ or deprecated.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Host Group\n   Only Token Ring isolating errors will increment the error\
    \ counter for\n   a particular hostEntry.  The isolating errors are: LineErrors,\n\
    \   BurstErrors, ACErrors, InternalErrors, and AbortErrors.  ACErrors\n   will\
    \ increment the error counter only for the nearest upstream\n   neighbor of the\
    \ station reporting the error.  LineErrors and\n   BurstErrors will increment\
    \ the error counters for the station\n   reporting the error and its neighbor\
    \ upstream neighbor.\n   InternalErrors and AbortErrors will increment the error\
    \ counter for\n   the station reporting the error only.  In addition, congestionErrors\n\
    \   will also be counted for each hostEntry. These errors will be\n   incremented\
    \ in the host entry of the station that reports the errors\n   in an error report\
    \ frame.\n   The hostOutPkts and hostOutOctets counters shall not be incremented\n\
    \   for packets with errors.\n"

    \ with the Frame Copied Bit set\n                   5    Packet with the Address\
    \ Recognized Bit set\n   For the purpose of the packet match algorithm, the filters\
    \ assume a\n   32 byte RIF field.  Thus, when matching, the filter is compared\
    \ to\n   the packet starting at the AC byte of the packet, until the end of\n\
    \   the RIF field; then the unused RIF bytes in the filter are skipped\n   and\
    \ matching proceeds from that point.  Any filter \"care\" bits in the\n   RIF\
    \ that don't correspond to bytes in the input packet will cause the\n   filter\
    \ to fail.\n"
