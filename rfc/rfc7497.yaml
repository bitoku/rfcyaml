  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are many possible rate measurement scenarios.  This\
    \ memo\n   describes one rate measurement problem and presents a rate\n   measurement\
    \ problem statement for test protocols to measure IP\n   Performance Metrics (IPPM).\n\
    \   When selecting a form of access to the Internet, subscribers are\n   interested\
    \ in the performance characteristics of the various\n   alternatives.  Standardized\
    \ measurements can be a basis for\n   comparison between these alternatives. \
    \ There is an underlying need\n   to coordinate measurements that support such\
    \ comparisons and to test\n   control protocols to fulfill this need.  The figure\
    \ below depicts\n   some typical measurement points of access networks.\n   User\
    \     /====== Fiber =======  Access Node \\\n   Device -|------ Copper -------\
    \  Access Node -|-- Infrastructure -- GW\n   or Host  \\------ Radio ------- \
    \ Access Node /\n                               GW = Gateway\n   The access rate\
    \ scenario or use case has received widespread\n   attention of Internet-access\
    \ subscribers and seemingly all Internet-\n   industry players, including regulators.\
    \  This problem is being\n   approached with many different measurement methods.\
    \  The eventual\n   protocol solutions to this problem (and the systems that utilize\
    \ the\n   protocol) may not directly involve users, such as when tests reach\n\
    \   from the infrastructure to a service-specific device, such as a\n   residential\
    \ gateway.  However, no aspect of the problem precludes\n   users from developing\
    \ a test protocol controlled via command line\n   interfaces on both ends.  Thus,\
    \ a very wide range of test protocols,\n   active measurement methods, and system\
    \ solutions are the possible\n   outcomes of this problem statement.\n"

- title: 2.  Purpose and Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose and Scope\n   The scope and purpose of this memo is to define the\
    \ measurement\n   problem statement for test protocols conducting access rate\n\
    \   measurement on production networks.  Relevant test protocols include\n   [RFC4656]\
    \ and [RFC5357], but the problem is stated in a general way\n   so that it can\
    \ be addressed by any existing test protocol, such as\n   [RFC6812].\n   This\
    \ memo discusses possible measurement methods but does not specify\n   exact methods\
    \ that would normally be part of the solution.\n   We are interested in access\
    \ measurement scenarios with the following\n   characteristics:\n   o  The access\
    \ portion of the network is the focus of this problem\n      statement.  The user\
    \ typically subscribes to a service with\n      bidirectional access partly described\
    \ by rates in bits per second.\n      The rates may be expressed as raw capacity\
    \ or restricted capacity,\n      as described in [RFC6703].  These are the quantities\
    \ that must be\n      measured according to one or more standard metrics and for\
    \ which\n      measurement methods must also be agreed on as a part of the\n \
    \     solution.\n   o  Referring to the reference path illustrated below and defined\
    \ in\n      [RFC7398], possible measurement points include a subscriber's\n  \
    \    host, the access service demarcation point, intra IP access (where\n    \
    \  a globally routable address is present), or the gateway between\n      the\
    \ measured access network and other networks.\n   Subsc. -- Private -- Private\
    \ -- Access -- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit\n   device     Net #1     Net #2   \
    \ Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW\n               GRA = Globally Routable\
    \ Address, GW = Gateway\n   o  Rates at some links near the edge of the provider's\
    \ network can\n      often be several orders of magnitude less than link rates\
    \ in the\n      aggregation and core portions of the network.\n   o  Asymmetrical\
    \ access rates on ingress and egress are prevalent.\n   o  In many scenarios of\
    \ interest, services of extremely large-scale\n      access require low-complexity\
    \ devices participating at the user\n      end of the path, and those devices\
    \ place limits on clock and\n      control timing accuracy.\n   This problem statement\
    \ assumes that the most likely bottleneck device\n   or link is adjacent to the\
    \ remote (user-end) measurement device or is\n   within one or two router/switch\
    \ hops of the remote measurement\n   device.\n   Other use cases for rate measurement\
    \ involve situations where the\n   packet switching and transport facilities are\
    \ leased by one operator\n   from another, and the link capacity available cannot\
    \ be directly\n   determined (e.g., from device-interface utilization).  These\n\
    \   scenarios could include mobile backhaul, Ethernet service access\n   networks,\
    \ and/or extensions of layer 2 or layer 3 networks.  The\n   results of rate measurements\
    \ in such cases could be employed to\n   select alternate routing, investigate\
    \ whether capacity meets some\n   previous agreement, and/or adapt the rate of\
    \ traffic sources if a\n   capacity bottleneck is found via the rate measurement.\
    \  In the case\n   of aggregated leased networks, available capacity may also\
    \ be\n   asymmetric.  In these cases, the tester is assumed to have a sender\n\
    \   and receiver location under their control.  We refer to this scenario\n  \
    \ below as the aggregated leased-network case.\n   This memo describes protocol\
    \ support for active measurement methods\n   consistent with the IPPM working\
    \ group's traditional charter.  Active\n   measurements require synthetic traffic\
    \ streams dedicated to testing\n   and do not make measurements on user traffic.\
    \  See Section 2 of\n   [RFC2679], where the concept of a stream is first introduced\
    \ in IPPM\n   literature as the basis for collecting a sample (defined in\n  \
    \ Section 11 of [RFC2330]).\n   As noted in [RFC2330], the focus of access traffic\
    \ management may\n   influence the rate measurement results for some forms of\
    \ access, as\n   it may differ between user and test traffic if the test traffic\
    \ has\n   different characteristics, primarily in terms of the packets\n   themselves\
    \ (see Section 13 of [RFC2330] for the considerations on\n   packet type, or Type-P).\n\
    \   There are several aspects of Type-P where user traffic may be\n   examined\
    \ and selected for special treatment that may affect\n   transmission rates. \
    \ Various aspects of Type-P are known to influence\n   Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)\
    \ routing with possible rate measurement\n   variability across parallel paths.\
    \  Without being exhaustive, the\n   possibilities include:\n   o  Packet length\n\
    \   o  IP addresses\n   o  Transport protocol (e.g., where TCP packets may be\
    \ routed\n      differently from UDP)\n   o  Transport-protocol port numbers\n\
    \   This issue requires further discussion when specific solutions/\n   methods\
    \ of measurement are proposed; for this problem statement, it\n   is sufficient\
    \ to identify the problem and indicate that the solution\n   may require an extremely\
    \ close emulation of user traffic, in terms of\n   one or more factors above.\n\
    \   Although the user may have multiple instances of network access\n   available\
    \ to them, the primary problem scope is to measure one form\n   of access at a\
    \ time.  It is plausible that a solution for the single\n   access problem will\
    \ be applicable to simultaneous measurement of\n   multiple access instances,\
    \ but treatment of this scenario is beyond\n   the current scope this document.\n\
    \   A key consideration is whether or not active measurements will be\n   conducted\
    \ with user traffic present.  In-Service testing takes place\n   with user traffic\
    \ present.  Out-of-Service testing occurs during pre-\n   service assessment or\
    \ during maintenance that interrupts service\n   temporarily.  Out-of-Service\
    \ testing includes activities described as\n   \"service commissioning\", \"service\
    \ activation\", and \"planned\n   maintenance\".  Opportunistic In-Service testing\
    \ (when there is no\n   user traffic present throughout the test interval, such\
    \ as outside\n   normal business hours) is essentially equivalent to Out-of-Service\n\
    \   testing.  Both In-Service and Out-of-Service testing are within the\n   scope\
    \ of this problem.\n   It is a non-goal to solve the measurement protocol specification\n\
    \   problem in this memo.\n   It is a non-goal to standardize methods of measurement\
    \ in this memo.\n   However, the problem statement mandates support for one category\
    \ of\n   rate measurement methods in the test protocol and adequate control\n\
    \   features for the methods in the control protocol (assuming the\n   control\
    \ and test protocols are separate).\n"
- title: 3.  Active Rate Measurement
  contents:
  - "3.  Active Rate Measurement\n   This section lists features of active measurement\
    \ methods needed to\n   measure access rates in production networks.\n   Coordination\
    \ between source and destination devices through control\n   messages and other\
    \ basic capabilities described in the methods of\n   IPPM RFCs [RFC2679] [RFC2680],\
    \ and assumed for test protocols such as\n   [RFC5357] and [RFC4656], are taken\
    \ as given.\n   Most forms of active testing intrude on user performance to some\n\
    \   degree, especially In-Service testing.  One key tenet of IPPM methods\n  \
    \ is to minimize test traffic effects on user traffic in the production\n   network.\
    \  Section 5 of [RFC2680] lists the problems with high\n   measurement traffic\
    \ rates (\"too much\" traffic); the most relevant for\n   rate measurement is\
    \ the tendency for measurement traffic to skew the\n   results, followed by the\
    \ possibility of introducing congestion on the\n   access link.  Section 4 of\
    \ [RFC3148] provides additional\n   considerations.  The user of protocols for\
    \ In-Service testing MUST\n   respect these traffic constraints.  Obviously, categories\
    \ of rate\n   measurement methods that use less active test traffic than others\n\
    \   with similar accuracy are preferred for In-Service testing, and the\n   specifications\
    \ of this memo encourage traffic reduction through\n   asymmetric control capabilities.\n\
    \   Out-of-Service tests where the test path shares no links with In-\n   Service\
    \ user traffic, have none of the congestion or skew concerns.\n   Both types should\
    \ address practical matters common to all test\n   efforts, such as conducting\
    \ measurements within a reasonable time\n   from the tester's point of view and\
    \ ensuring that timestamp accuracy\n   is consistent with the precision needed\
    \ for measurement [RFC2330].\n   Out-of-Service tests where some part of the test\
    \ path is shared with\n   In-Service traffic MUST respect the In-Service constraints\
    \ described\n   above.\n   The intended metrics to be measured have strong influence\
    \ over the\n   categories of measurement methods required.  For example, using\
    \ the\n   terminology of [RFC5136], it may be possible to measure a path\n   capacity\
    \ metric while In-Service if the level of background (user)\n   traffic can be\
    \ assessed and included in the reported result.\n   The measurement architecture\
    \ MAY be either of one-way (e.g.,\n   [RFC4656]) or two-way (e.g., [RFC5357]),\
    \ but the scale and complexity\n   aspects of end-user or aggregated access measurement\
    \ clearly favor\n   two-way (with a low-complexity user-end device and round-trip\
    \ results\n   collection, as found in [RFC5357]).  However, the asymmetric rates\
    \ of\n   many access services mean that the measurement system MUST be able to\n\
    \   evaluate performance in each direction of transmission.  In the two-\n   way\
    \ architecture, both end devices MUST include the ability to launch\n   test streams\
    \ and collect the results of measurements in both (one-\n   way) directions of\
    \ transmission (this requirement is consistent with\n   previous protocol specifications,\
    \ and it is not a unique problem for\n   rate measurements).\n   The following\
    \ paragraphs describe features for the roles of test\n   packet SENDER, RECEIVER,\
    \ and results REPORTER.\n   SENDER:\n   Generate streams of test packets with\
    \ various characteristics as\n   desired (see Section 4).  The SENDER MAY be located\
    \ at the user end\n   of the access path or elsewhere in the production network,\
    \ such as at\n   one end of an aggregated leased-network segment.\n   RECEIVER:\n\
    \   Collect streams of test packets with various characteristics (as\n   described\
    \ above), and make the measurements necessary to support rate\n   measurement\
    \ at the receiving end of an access or aggregated leased-\n   network segment.\n\
    \   REPORTER:\n   Use information from test packets and local processes to measure\n\
    \   delivered packet rates and prepare results in the required format\n   (the\
    \ REPORTER role may be combined with another role, most likely the\n   SENDER).\n"
- title: 4.  Measurement Method Categories
  contents:
  - "4.  Measurement Method Categories\n   A protocol that addresses the rate measurement\
    \ problem MUST serve the\n   test stream generation and measurement functions\
    \ (SENDER and\n   RECEIVER).  The follow-up phase of analyzing the measurement\
    \ results\n   to produce a report is outside the scope of this problem and memo\n\
    \   (REPORTER).\n   For the purposes of this problem statement, we categorize\
    \ the many\n   possibilities for rate measurement stream generation as follows:\n\
    \   1.  Packet pairs, with fixed intra-pair packet spacing and fixed or\n    \
    \   random time intervals between pairs in a test stream.\n   2.  Multiple streams\
    \ of packet pairs, with a range of intra-pair\n       spacing and inter-pair intervals.\n\
    \   3.  One or more packet ensembles in a test stream, using a fixed\n       ensemble\
    \ size in packets and one or more fixed intra-ensemble\n       packet spacings\
    \ (including zero spacing, meaning that back-to-\n       back burst ensembles\
    \ and constant rate ensembles fall in this\n       category).\n   4.  One or more\
    \ packet chirps (a set of packets with specified\n       characteristics), where\
    \ inter-packet spacing typically decreases\n       between adjacent packets in\
    \ the same chirp and each pair of\n       packets represents a rate for testing\
    \ purposes.\n   The test protocol SHALL support test packet ensemble generation\n\
    \   (category 3), as this appears to minimize the demands on measurement\n   accuracy.\
    \  Other stream generation categories are OPTIONAL.\n   For all supported categories,\
    \ the following is a list of additional\n   variables that the protocol(s) MUST\
    \ be able to specify, control, and\n   generate:\n   a.  variable payload lengths\
    \ among packet streams;\n   b.  variable length (in packets) among packet streams\
    \ or ensembles;\n   c.  variable IP header markings among packet streams;\n  \
    \ d.  choice of UDP transport and variable port numbers, or choice of\n      \
    \ TCP transport and variable port numbers for two-way architectures\n       only,\
    \ or both (see below for additional requirements on TCP\n       transport generation);\
    \ and\n   e.  variable number of packet pairs, ensembles, or streams used in a\n\
    \       test session.\n   The ability to revise these variables during an established\
    \ test\n   session is OPTIONAL, as multiple test sessions could serve the same\n\
    \   purpose.  Another OPTIONAL feature is the ability to generate streams\n  \
    \ with VLAN tags and other markings.\n   For measurement systems employing TCP\
    \ as the transport protocol, the\n   ability to generate specific stream characteristics\
    \ requires a sender\n   with the ability to establish and prime the connection\
    \ such that the\n   desired stream characteristics are allowed.  See [IPPM-METRICS]\
    \ for\n   more background.\n   Beyond a simple connection handshake and the options\
    \ establishment,\n   an \"open-loop\" TCP sender requires the SENDER ability to:\n\
    \   o  generate TCP packets with well-formed headers (all fields valid),\n   \
    \   including Acknowledgement aspects;\n   o  produce packet streams at controlled\
    \ rates and variable inter-\n      packet spacings, including packet ensembles\
    \ (back-to-back at\n      server rate); and\n   o  continue the configured sending\
    \ stream characteristics despite all\n      control indications except receive-window\
    \ exhaust.\n   The corresponding TCP RECEIVER performs normally, having some ability\n\
    \   to configure the receive window sufficiently large so as to allow the\n  \
    \ SENDER to transmit at will (up to a configured target).\n   It may also be useful\
    \ (for diagnostic purposes) to provide a control\n   for the bulk transfer capacity\
    \ measurement with fully-specified (and\n   congestion-controlled) TCP senders\
    \ and receivers, as envisioned in\n   [RFC3148], but this would be a brute-force\
    \ assessment, which does not\n   follow the conservative tenets of IPPM measurement\
    \ [RFC2330].\n   Measurements for each UDP test packet transferred between SENDER\
    \ and\n   RECEIVER MUST be compliant with the singleton measurement methods\n\
    \   described in IPPM RFCs [RFC2679][RFC2680].  The timestamp information\n  \
    \ or loss/arrival status for each packet MUST be available for\n   communication\
    \ to the REPORTER function.\n"
- title: 5.  Test Protocol Control and Generation Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Test Protocol Control and Generation Requirements\n   In summary, the test\
    \ protocol must support the measurement features\n   described in the sections\
    \ above.  This requires:\n   1.  Communicating all test variables to the SENDER\
    \ and RECEIVER;\n   2.  Results collection in a one-way architecture;\n   3. \
    \ Remote device control for both one-way and two-way architectures;\n       and\n\
    \   4.  Asymmetric packet rates in a two-way measurement architecture, or\n  \
    \     coordinated one-way test capabilities with the same effect\n       (asymmetric\
    \ rates may be achieved through directional control of\n       packet rate or\
    \ packet size).\n   The ability to control and generate asymmetric rates in a\
    \ two-way\n   architecture is REQUIRED.  Two-way architectures are RECOMMENDED\
    \ to\n   include control and generation capability for both asymmetric and\n \

    \ is indicated when the result of a\n   measurement may depend on the size of\
    \ the packets used in each\n   direction, i.e., when any of the following conditions\
    \ hold:\n   o  there is a link in the path with asymmetrical capacity in opposite\n\
    \      directions (in combination with one or more of the conditions\n      below,\
    \ but their presence or specific details may be unknown to\n      the tester);\n\
    \   o  there is a link in the path that aggregates (or divides) packets\n    \
    \  into link-level frames and may have a capacity that depends on\n      packet\
    \ size, rate, or timing;\n   o  there is a link in the path where transmission\
    \ in one direction\n      influences performance in the opposite direction;\n\
    \   o  there is a device in the path where transmission capacity depends\n   \
    \   on packet header processing capacity (in other words, the capacity\n     \
    \ is sensitive to packet size);\n   o  the target application stream is nominally\
    \ MTU size packets in one\n      direction versus ACK stream in the other (noting\
    \ that there are a\n      vanishing number of symmetrical rate application streams\
    \ for which\n      rate measurement is wanted or interesting but such streams\
    \ might\n      have some relevance at this time);\n   o  the distribution of packet\
    \ losses is critical to rate assessment;\n   and possibly other circumstances\
    \ revealed by measurements comparing\n   streams with symmetrical size and asymmetrical\
    \ size.\n   Implementations may support control and generation for only symmetric\n\
    \   packet sizes when none of the above conditions hold.\n   The test protocol\
    \ SHOULD enable measurement of the capacity metric\n   [RFC5136] either Out-of-Service,\

  - "7.  Operational Considerations\n   All forms of testing originate network traffic,\
    \ either through their\n   communications for control and results collection,\
    \ from dedicated\n   measurement packet streams, or from a combination of both\
    \ types of\n   traffic.  Testing traffic primarily falls in one of two categories:\n\
    \   subscriber traffic or network management traffic.  There is an\n   ongoing\
    \ need to engineer networks so that various forms of traffic\n   are adequately\
    \ served, and publication of this memo does not change\n   this need.  Service\
    \ subscribers and authorized users SHOULD obtain\n   their network operator's\
    \ or service provider's permission before\n   conducting tests.  Likewise, a service\
    \ provider or third party SHOULD\n   obtain the subscriber's permission to conduct\
    \ tests, since they might\n   temporarily reduce service quality.  The protocol\
    \ SHOULD communicate\n   the permission status once the overall system has obtained\
    \ it, either\n   explicitly or through other means.\n   Subscribers, their service\
    \ providers and network operators, and\n   sometimes third parties, all seek to\
    \ measure network performance.\n   Capacity testing with active traffic often\
    \ affects the packet\n   transfer performance of streams traversing shared components\
    \ of the\n   test path, to some degree.  The degradation can be minimized by\n\
    \   scheduling such tests infrequently and restricting the amount of\n   measurement\
    \ traffic required to assess capacity metrics.  As a\n   result, occasional short-duration\
    \ estimates with minimal traffic are\n   preferred to measurements based on frequent\
    \ file transfers of many\n   megabytes with similar accuracy.  New measurement\
    \ methodologies\n   intended for standardization should be evaluated individually\
    \ for\n   potential operational issues.  However, the scheduled frequency of\n\
    \   testing is as important as the methods used (and schedules are not\n   typically\
    \ submitted for standardization).\n   The new test protocol feature of asymmetrical\
    \ packet size generation\n   in two-way testing is recommended in this memo. \
    \ It can appreciably\n   reduce the load and packet processing demands of each\
    \ test and\n   therefore reduce the likelihood of degradation in one direction\
    \ of\n   the tested path.  Current IETF standardized test protocols (e.g.,\n \
    \  [RFC5357] and [RFC6812]) do not possess the asymmetric size\n   generation\
    \ capability with two-way testing.\n"
