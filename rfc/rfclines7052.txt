Abstract This document defines the MIB module that contains managed objects to support the monitoring devices of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).
These objects provide information useful for monitoring LISP devices, including determining basic LISP configuration information, LISP functional status, and operational counters and other statistics.
This document describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
Specifically, the MIB for managing devices that support the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is described.
LISP [RFC6830] specifies a network based architecture and mechanisms that implement a new semantic for IP addressing using two separate name spaces:
Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), used within sites, and Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks that make up the Internet infrastructure.
To achieve this separation, LISP defines protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to RLOCs.
From a data plane perspective, LISP traffic is handled exclusively at the network layer by devices performing Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) LISP functions.
Data plane operations performed by these devices are described in [RFC6830].
Additionally, data plane interworking between legacy (Internet) and LISP sites is implemented by devices performing Proxy ITR (PITR) and Proxy ETR (PETR) functions.
The data plane operations of these devices is described in [RFC6832].
From a control plane perspective, LISP employs mechanisms related to creating, maintaining, and resolving mappings from EIDs to RLOCs.
LISP ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, and PETRs perform specific control plane functions, and these control plane operations are described in [RFC6830].
Additionally, LISP infrastructure devices supporting LISP control plane functionality include Map Servers and Map Resolvers, and the control plane operations of these devices are described in [RFC6833].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This document does not define any new terms.
All terms used in this document are listed here for completeness; the authoritative definition of each term can be found in the definition section of the respective specified reference.
[RFC6830] EID to RLOC Cache:
[RFC6830] EID to RLOC Database:
[RFC6833] Map Resolver:  [RFC6833] Map Request:  [RFC6833] Map Reply:  [RFC6833] Negative Map Reply:  [RFC6833] 5.
The objectives for this LISP MIB module are to provide a read only mechanism to support the following functions:  Provide a means for obtaining (read only)
a current status of LISP features enabled on a device, and (read only) a current status of configuration attributes related to those features.
As one example, this MIB could determine the ON/OFF status of LISP features such as ITR, ETR, PITR, PETR, MS, or MR support, specifically as related to IPv4 or IPv6 address families as well as the LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) [LCAF] with IANA assigned Address Family Number 16387.
Other examples could include obtaining the (read only) status of whether RLOC Probing is enabled, obtaining the status of whether the use of a PETR is configured, and obtaining the (read only) values of other related attributes such as the map cache limit value, or a mapping time  to live (TTL) value.
Provide a means for obtaining (read only)
the current attributes of various LISP tables, such as the EID to RLOC policy data contained in the map cache, or the local EID to RLOC policy data contained in the mapping database.
Provide a means for obtaining (read only)
the current operational statistics of various LISP functions, such as the number of packets encapsulated and decapsulated by the device.
Other counters of operational interest, depending on LISP function, include things like the current number of map cache entries, and the total number and rate of map requests received and sent by the device.
Structure of LISP MIB Module 6.1.
No LISP MIB notifications are defined.
The LISP MIB module is composed of the following tables of objects: lispFeatures
This table provides information representing the various lisp features that can be enabled on LISP devices.
This table provides information representing the mapping of a LISP Instance ID to a VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding).
lispGlobalStats  This table provides global statistics for a given Instance ID per address family on a LISP device.
This table represents the EID to RLOC database that contains the EID Prefix to RLOC mappings configured on an ETR.
In general, this table would be representative of all such mappings for a given site to which this device belongs.
This table represents the set of routing locators contained in the EID to RLOC database configured on an ETR.
This table represents the short lived, on demand table maintained on an ITR that stores, tracks, and times out EID  to RLOC mappings.
This table represents the set of locators per EID Prefix contained in the map cache table of an ITR.
This table represents the set of routing locators configured on a LISP device.
This table provides the properties of each EID Prefix that is registered with this device when configured to be a Map Server.
This table provides the properties of the different ETRs that send registers, for a given EID Prefix, to this device when configured to be a Map Server.
This table provides the properties of the different locators per EID prefix that is registered with this device when configured to be a Map Server.
This table provides the properties of all Map  Servers that this device is configured to use.
This table provides the properties of all Map  Resolvers that this device is configured to use.
This table provides the properties of all Proxy ETRs that this device is configured to use.

"Initial version of the IETF LISP MIB module.
LISP architecture can be applied to a wide variety of address families.
This textual convention is a generalization for representing addresses belonging to those address families.
For convenience, this document refers to any such address as a LISP address.
LispAddressType textual convention consists of the following four tuple: 1.
IANA Address Family Number: A field of length 2 octets, whose value is of the form following the assigned AddressFamilyNumbers textual convention described in IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB DEFINITIONS, available from http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaaddressfamilynumbers mib.
The enumerations are also listed in [IANA].
Note that this list of address family numbers is maintained by IANA.
A field of length 1 octet, whose value indicates the octet length of the next (third) field of this LispAddressType four tuple.
A field of variable length as indicated in the previous (second) field, whose value is an address of the IANA Address Family indicated in the first field of this LispAddressType four tuple.
Note that any of the IANA Address Families can be represented.
Particularly when the address family is LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) with IANA assigned Address Family Number 16387, then the first octet of this field indicates the LCAF type, and the rest of this field is same as the encoding format of the LISP Canonical Address after the length field, as defined in LCAF document.
Mask length of address: A field of length 1 octet, whose value is the mask length to be applied to the LISP address specified in the previous (third) field.
To illustrate the use of this object, consider the LISP MIB Object below titled lispMapCacheEntry.
This object begins with the following entities:
Example 1: Suppose that the IPv4 EID Prefix stored is 192.0.2.0/24.
In this case, the values within lispMapCacheEntry would be:
lispMapCacheEidLength    8 lispMapCacheEid   1, 4, 192.0.2.0, 24 ...
where 8 is the total length in octets of the next object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).
Then, the value 1 indicates the IPv4 AF (per the IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB), the value 4 indicates that the AF is 4 octets in length
, 192.0.2.0 is the IPv4 address, and the value 24 is the mask length in bits.
Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength value of 8 is used to compute the length of the fourth (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet   as computed by 8 (2   1   4)
Example 2: Suppose that the IPv6 EID Prefix stored is 2001:
In this case, the values within lispMapCacheEntry would be: lispMapCacheEidLength    20 lispMapCacheEid
where 20 is the total length in octets of the next object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).
Then, the value 2 indicates the IPv6 AF (per the IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB), the value 16 indicates that the AF is 16 octets in length, 2001:
db8:a:: is the IPv6 address, and the value 48 is the mask length in bits.
Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength value of 20 is used to compute the length of the fourth (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet   as computed by 20 (2   1   16)
As an example where LCAF is used, suppose that the IPv4 EID Prefix stored is 192.0.2.0/24 and it is part of LISP Instance ID 101.
where 11 is the total length in octets of the next object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).
Then, the value 16387 indicates the LCAF AF (see the IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB), the value 7 indicates that the LCAF AF is 7 octets in length in this case, 2 indicates that LCAF Type 2 encoding is used (see the LCAF document), 101 gives the Instance ID, 1 gives the AFI (per the IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB) for an IPv4 address,
192.0.2.0 is the IPv4 address, and 24 is the mask length in bits.
Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength value of 11 octets is used to compute the length of the last field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet   as computed by 11 (2   1
Note: all LISP header formats and locations of specific flags, bits, and fields are as given in the base LISP references of RFC 6830, RFC 6832, and RFC 6833.

Relationship to Other MIB Modules 8.1.
MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS
The LISP MIB imports the TEXTUAL CONVENTION AddressFamilyNumbers from the IANA ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS MIB DEFINITIONS [IANA].
The LISP MIB imports mib 2, Unsigned32, Counter64, Integer32, and TimeTicks from SNMPv2
The LISP MIB imports TruthValue, TEXTUAL CONVENTION, TimeStamp, and TimeTicks from SNMPv2 TC
The LISP MIB imports MODULE COMPLIANCE from SNMPv2
The LISP MIB imports MplsL3VpnName from MPLS
There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
There are no readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) that are considered sensitive.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
