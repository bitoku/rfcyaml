    \   negotiation of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing.  It\n   makes\
    \ it clear that an answerer can only include an \"a=rtcp-mux\"\n   attribute in\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5761 [RFC5761] specifies how to multiplex RTP data packets\
    \ and\n   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets on a single UDP port, and how to\n\
    \   negotiate usage of such multiplexing using the SDP offer/answer\n   mechanism\
    \ [RFC3264] with an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute.  However, the\n   text is unclear\
    \ on whether an answerer is allowed to include the\n   attribute in an answer\
    \ even if the associated offer did not contain\n   an attribute.\n   This document\
    \ updates RFC 5761 [RFC5761] by clarifying that an\n   answerer can only include\
    \ an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute in an answer if\n   the associated offer contained\
    \ the attribute.  It also clarifies that\n   the negotiation of RTP and RTCP multiplexing\
    \ is for usage in both\n   directions.\n"

- title: 3.  Update to RFC 5761
  contents:
  - "3.  Update to RFC 5761\n   This section updates Section 5.1.1 of RFC 5761 by\
    \ clarifying that an\n   answerer can only include an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute\
    \ in an answer if\n   the associated offer contained the attribute, and by clarifying\
    \ that\n   the negotiation of RTP and RTCP multiplexing is for usage in both\n\

- title: 3.1.  Update to Section 5.1.1
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Update to Section 5.1.1\n   In this section, any references to Sections\
    \ 4 and 8 are to those\n   sections in [RFC5761].\n   OLD TEXT:\n   When the Session\
    \ Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate\n   RTP sessions following\
    \ the offer/answer model [9], the \"a=rtcp-mux\"\n   attribute (see Section 8)\
    \ indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and\n   RTCP onto a single port.  The\
    \ initial SDP offer MUST include this\n   attribute at the media level to request\
    \ multiplexing of RTP and RTCP\n   on a single port.  For example:\n       v=0\n\
    \       o=csp 1153134164 1153134164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e\n    \

    \   This offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP\n   profile\
    \ with iLBC coding.  The answerer is requested to send both RTP\n   and RTCP to\
    \ port 49170 on IPv6 address 2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.\n   If the answerer\
    \ wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,\n   it MUST include a media-level\
    \ \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute in the answer.\n   The RTP payload types used in the\
    \ answer MUST conform to the rules in\n   Section 4.\n   If the answer does not\
    \ contain an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute, the offerer\n   MUST NOT multiplex RTP\
    \ and RTCP packets on a single port.  Instead,\n   it should send and receive\
    \ RTCP on a port allocated according to the\n   usual port-selection rules (either\
    \ the port pair, or a signalled port\n   if the \"a=rtcp:\" attribute [10] is\
    \ also included).  This will occur\n   when talking to a peer that does not understand\
    \ the \"a=rtcp-mux\"\n   attribute.\n   When SDP is used in a declarative manner,\
    \ the presence of an\n   \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute signals that the sender will\
    \ multiplex RTP and\n   RTCP on the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared\
    \ to receive RTCP\n   packets on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs\
    \ to be\n   made including the RTCP bandwidth.\n   NEW TEXT:\n   When the Session\
    \ Description Protocol (SDP) [8] is used to negotiate\n   RTP sessions following\
    \ the offer/answer model [9], the \"a=rtcp-mux\"\n   attribute (see Section 8)\
    \ indicates the desire to multiplex RTP and\n   RTCP onto a single port, and the\
    \ usage is always negotiated for both\n   directions.\n   If the offerer wishes\
    \ to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port,\n   the initial SDP offer MUST\
    \ include the attribute at the media level\n   to request multiplexing of RTP\
    \ and RTCP on a single port.  For\n   example:\n        v=0\n        o=csp 1153134164\

    \ 49170 RTP/AVP 97\n        a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000\n        a=rtcp-mux\n   This\
    \ offer denotes a unicast voice-over-IP session using the RTP/AVP\n   profile\
    \ with Internet Low Bit Rate Codec (iLBC) coding.  The answerer\n   is requested\
    \ to send both RTP and RTCP to port 49170 on IPv6 address\n   2001:DB8::211:24ff:fea3:7a2e.\n\
    \   If the offer contains the \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute, and if the answerer\n\
    \   wishes to multiplex RTP and RTCP onto a single port, it MUST include\n   a\
    \ media-level \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute in the answer.  The RTP payload\n   types\
    \ used in the answer MUST conform to the rules in Section 4.  If\n   the offer\
    \ does not contain the \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute, the answerer\n   MUST NOT include\
    \ an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute in the answer, and the\n   answerer MUST NOT multiplex\
    \ RTP and RTCP packets on a single port.\n   If the answer contains an \"a=rtcp-mux\"\
    \ attribute, the offerer and\n   answerer MUST multiplex RTP and RTCP packets\
    \ on a single port.\n   If the answer does not contain an \"a=rtcp-mux\" attribute,\
    \ the offerer\n   and answerer MUST NOT multiplex RTP and RTCP packets on a single\n\
    \   port.  Instead, they should send and receive RTCP on a port allocated\n  \
    \ according to the usual port-selection rules (either the port pair, or\n   a\
    \ signalled port if the \"a=rtcp:\" attribute [10] is also included).\n   This\
    \ will occur when talking to a peer that does not understand the\n   \"a=rtcp-mux\"\
    \ attribute.\n   When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an\
    \ \"a=rtcp-\n   mux\" attribute signals that the sender will multiplex RTP and\
    \ RTCP on\n   the same port.  The receiver MUST be prepared to receive RTCP packets\n\
    \   on the RTP port, and any resource reservation needs to be made\n   including\
    \ the RTCP bandwidth.\n"
