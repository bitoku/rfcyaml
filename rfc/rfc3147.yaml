- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   RFC 2784 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [1] provides\
    \ a standard\n   method for transporting one arbitrary network layer protocol\
    \ over\n   another arbitrary network layer protocol.\n   RFC 1702 Generic Routing\
    \ Encapsulation over IPv4 networks [2]\n   provides a standard method for transporting\
    \ an arbitrary network\n   layer protocol over IPv4 using GRE.\n   However no\
    \ standard method exists for transporting other network\n   layer protocols over\
    \ CLNS.  This causes lack of interoperability\n   between different vendors' products\
    \ as they provide solutions to\n   migrate from CLNS networks to IP networks.\
    \  This is a problem\n   specifically in, but not limited to, the context of management\n\
    \   networks for SONET and SDH networks elements.\n   Large networks exist for\
    \ the purpose of providing management\n   communications for SONET and SDH network\
    \ elements.  Standards\n   Bellcore GR-253-CORE [3] and ITU-T G.784 [4] mandate\
    \ that these\n   networks are based on CLNS.\n   Many vendors have already started\
    \ to offer SONET and SDH products\n   that are managed by IP instead of CLNS and\
    \ a general migration from\n   CLNS towards IP is anticipated within the industry.\n\
    \   Part of any migration strategy from CLNS to IP should provide for the\n  \
    \ co-existence of both CLNS managed and IP managed network elements in\n   the\
    \ same network.\n   Such a migration strategy should foresee the need to manage\
    \ existing\n   CLNS managed network elements that become isolated by a new IP\n\
    \   network.  Such a scenario may be tackled by tunnelling CLNP PDUs over\n  \
    \ IP using the existing GRE standard RFC 2784 [1] and informational RFC\n   1702\
    \ [2].  Networks have already been deployed that use this method.\n   Such a migration\
    \ strategy should also foresee the need to manage new\n   IP managed network elements\
    \ that are installed on the far side of\n   existing CLNS managed network.  Such\
    \ a scenario requires a method for\n   tunnelling IP over CLNS.\n"
- title: 2. GRE over CLNS advantages
  contents:
  - "2. GRE over CLNS advantages\n   Using GRE to tunnel IP over CLNS offers some\
    \ advantages.\n      In the absence of a standard for tunnelling IP over CLNS,\
    \ GRE as\n      specified in RFC 2784 [1] is the most applicable standard that\n\
    \      exists.\n      The move from CLNS to IP comes at a time when IP is itself\n\
    \      migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.  GRE defines a method to tunnel any\n    \
    \  protocol that has an Ethernet Protocol Type.  Therefore by\n      defining\
    \ a method for CLNS to transport GRE, a method will then\n      exist for CLNS\
    \ to transport any other protocol that has an\n      Ethernet Protocol Type defined\
    \ in RFC 1700 [5].  Thus GRE over\n      CLNS can be used to tunnel both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6.\n      GRE is already commonly used to tunnel CLNP PDUs over IP and\
    \ so\n      using GRE to tunnel IP over CLNS gives a common approach to\n    \
    \  tunnelling and may simplify software within network elements that\n      initiate\
    \ and terminate tunnels.\n   The only disadvantage of using GRE is the extra minimum\
    \ of four bytes\n   that will be used between CLNP header and IP payload packet.\
    \  Given\n   the large size of CLNP headers this will not make a  significant\n\
    \   difference to the performance of any network that has IP over CLNP\n   PDUs\
    \ present on it.\n"
- title: 3. Transporting GRE packets over CLNS.
  contents:
  - "3. Transporting GRE packets over CLNS.\n   It is suggested that GRE should be\
    \ transported over CLNS at the\n   lowest layer possible, which is as a transport\
    \ layer protocol over\n   the network layer.  This can be achieved by placing\
    \ the entire GRE\n   packet inside a CLNP Data Type PDU (DT PDU) as data payload.\n\
    \   The GRE packet is a GRE packet as defined in RFC 2784 [1], in other\n   words\
    \ GRE header plus payload packet.\n   Data payload is the part of a Data PDU that\
    \ is described as \"Data\" in\n   the structure of a Data PDU in ISO/IEC 8473-1\
    \ [6].\n   For convenience the structure of a Data PDU is reproduced from\n  \
    \ ISO/IEC 8473-1 [6] below:\n                                                \

- title: 4. NSAP selector (N-SEL) value.
  contents:
  - "4. NSAP selector (N-SEL) value.\n   Transport of GRE packets is a new type of\
    \ Network Service (NS) user.\n   Different Network Service users are identified\
    \ by using different\n   NSAP selector bytes also known as N-SEL bytes.\n   This\
    \ is a similar concept to the use of the IP Protocol Type used in\n   IP packets.\n\
    \   Whilst it is not strictly necessary for all vendors to use the same\n   N-SEL\
    \ values, they must use the same N-SEL value for it to be\n   possible for one\
    \ vendor's CLNS device or network element to initiate\n   a GRE tunnel which is\
    \ then terminated on a different vendor's CLNS\n   device.\n   Although N-SEL\
    \ values (other than zero) are not defined in CLNS/CLNP\n   standards, some are\
    \ defined when CLNS is used in SONET networks by\n   Bellcore GR-253-CORE [3]\
    \ whilst others are in common use.\n   As the IP protocol number for GRE is 47,\
    \ as defined in RFC 1702 [2],\n   and as 47 is not commonly used as an N-SEL value,\
    \ it is suggested\n   that 47 (decimal) should be used as an N-SEL value to indicate\
    \ to the\n   CLNS stack that the Data portion of the Data Type PDU contains a\
    \ GRE\n   packet.\n   The N-SEL byte should be set to 47 (decimal) in both the\
    \ source\n   address and the destination address of the CLNP PDU.\n   The N-SEL\
    \ value of 47 should indicate only that the payload is GRE,\n   and the device\
    \ or network element that transmits the PDU should use\n   the GRE header to indicate\
    \ what protocol (for example IPv4 or IPv6)\n   is encapsulated within the GRE\
    \ packet in conformance with RFC 2784\n   [1].  Similarly the device or network\
    \ element that receives the PDU\n   should then inspect the GRE header to ascertain\
    \ what protocol is\n   contained within the GRE packet in conformance with RFC\
    \ 2784 [1].\n"
- title: 5. Segmentation Permitted (SP) value.
  contents:
  - "5. Segmentation Permitted (SP) value.\n   It is recommended that the SP flag\
    \ in all CLNP PDUs containing GRE\n   packets should be set.\n   If the SP flag\
    \ is not set, and a CLNP PDU is too large for a\n   particular link, then a CLNS\
    \ device or network element will drop the\n   PDU.  The originator of the packet\
    \ that is inside the GRE packet will\n   not have visibility of the packet loss\
    \ or the reason for the packet\n   loss, and a black hole may form.\n"

    \ point for a GRE tunnel should treat IP packets that\n   are bigger than the\
    \ MTU size of the GRE tunnel as per RFC 1191 [7].\n   If the oversize IP packet\
    \ that is about to enter the GRE tunnel does\n   not have its Don't Fragment (DF)\
    \ bit set then it should be fragmented\n   before entering the tunnel.\n   If\
    \ the oversize IP packet that is about to enter the GRE tunnel has\n   its DF\
    \ bit set then the packet should be discarded, and an ICMP\n   unreachable error\
    \ message (in particular the \"fragmentation needed\n   and DF set\" code) should\
    \ be sent back to the originator of the packet\n   as described in RFC 1191 [7].\n"
