- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is primarily used to translate domain\n\
    \   names into IPv4 addresses using A RRs (Resource Records).  Several\n   approaches\
    \ exist to describe networks or address ranges.  This\n   document specifies a\
    \ new DNS RR type \"APL\" for address prefix lists.\n"

- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The Domain Name System [RFC1034], [RFC1035] provides a mechanism\
    \ to\n   associate addresses and other Internet infrastructure elements with\n\
    \   hierarchically built domain names.  Various types of resource records\n  \
    \ have been defined, especially those for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC2874]\n   addresses.\
    \  In [RFC1101] a method is described to publish information\n   about the address\
    \ space allocated to an organisation.  In older BIND\n   versions, a weak form\
    \ of controlling access to zone data was\n   implemented using TXT RRs describing\
    \ address ranges.\n   This document specifies a new RR type for address prefix\
    \ lists.\n"
- title: 3. APL RR Type
  contents:
  - "3. APL RR Type\n   An APL record has the DNS type of \"APL\" and a numeric value\
    \ of 42\n   [IANA].  The APL RR is defined in the IN class only.  APL RRs cause\n\
    \   no additional section processing.\n"

- title: 4.1. AFDPART for IPv4
  contents:
  - "4.1. AFDPART for IPv4\n   The encoding of an IPv4 address (address family 1)\
    \ follows the\n   encoding specified for the A RR by [RFC1035], section 3.4.1.\n\
    \   PREFIX specifies the number of bits of the IPv4 address starting at\n   the\
    \ most significant bit.  Legal values range from 0 to 32.\n   Trailing zero octets\
    \ do not bear any information (e.g., there is no\n   semantic difference between\
    \ 10.0.0.0/16 and 10/16) in an address\n   prefix, so the shortest possible AFDLENGTH\
    \ can be used to encode it.\n   However, for DNSSEC [RFC2535] a single wire encoding\
    \ must be used by\n   all.  Therefore the sender MUST NOT include trailing zero\
    \ octets in\n   the AFDPART regardless of the value of PREFIX.  This includes\
    \ cases\n   in which AFDLENGTH times 8 results in a value less than PREFIX.  The\n\
    \   AFDPART is padded with zero bits to match a full octet boundary.\n   An IPv4\
    \ AFDPART has a variable length of 0 to 4 octets.\n"
- title: 4.2. AFDPART for IPv6
  contents:
  - "4.2. AFDPART for IPv6\n   The 128 bit IPv6 address (address family 2) is encoded\
    \ in network\n   byte order (high-order byte first).\n   PREFIX specifies the\
    \ number of bits of the IPv6 address starting at\n   the most significant bit.\
    \  Legal values range from 0 to 128.\n   With the same reasoning as in 4.1 above,\
    \ the sender MUST NOT include\n   trailing zero octets in the AFDPART regardless\
    \ of the value of\n   PREFIX.  This includes cases in which AFDLENGTH times 8\
    \ results in a\n   value less than PREFIX.  The AFDPART is padded with zero bits\
    \ to\n   match a full octet boundary.\n   An IPv6 AFDPART has a variable length\
    \ of 0 to 16 octets.\n"
- title: 5. Zone File Syntax
  contents:
  - "5. Zone File Syntax\n   The textual representation of an APL RR in a DNS zone\
    \ file is as\n   follows:\n   <owner>   IN   <TTL>   APL   {[!]afi:address/prefix}*\n\
    \   The data consists of zero or more strings of the address family\n   indicator\
    \ <afi>, immediately followed by a colon \":\", an address,\n   immediately followed\
    \ by the \"/\" character, immediately followed by a\n   decimal numeric value\
    \ for the prefix length.  Any such string may be\n   preceded by a \"!\" character.\
    \  The strings are separated by\n   whitespace.  The <afi> is the decimal numeric\
    \ value of that\n   particular address family.\n"
- title: 5.1. Textual Representation of IPv4 Addresses
  contents:
  - "5.1. Textual Representation of IPv4 Addresses\n   An IPv4 address in the <address>\
    \ part of an <apitem> is in dotted\n   quad notation, just as in an A RR.  The\
    \ <prefix> has values from the\n   interval 0..32 (decimal).\n"
- title: 5.2. Textual Representation of IPv6 Addresses
  contents:
  - "5.2. Textual Representation of IPv6 Addresses\n   The representation of an IPv6\
    \ address in the <address> part of an\n   <apitem> follows [RFC2373], section\
    \ 2.2.  Legal values for <prefix>\n   are from the interval 0..128 (decimal).\n"
- title: 6. APL RR usage
  contents:
  - "6. APL RR usage\n   An APL RR with empty RDATA is valid and implements an empty\
    \ list.\n   Multiple occurrences of the same <apitem> in a single APL RR are\n\
    \   allowed and MUST NOT be merged by a DNS server or resolver.\n   <apitems>\
    \ MUST be kept in order and MUST NOT be rearranged or\n   aggregated.\n   A single\
    \ APL RR may contain <apitems> belonging to different address\n   families.  The\
    \ maximum number of <apitems> is upper bounded by the\n   available RDATA space.\n\
    \   RRSets consisting of more than one APL RR are legal but the\n   interpretation\
    \ is left to the particular application.\n"
- title: 7. Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "7. Applicability Statement\n   The APL RR defines a framework without specifying\
    \ any particular\n   meaning for the list of prefixes.  It is expected that APL\
    \ RRs will\n   be used in different application scenarios which have to be\n \
    \  documented separately.  Those scenarios may be distinguished by\n   characteristic\
    \ prefixes placed in front of the DNS owner name.\n   An APL application specification\
    \ MUST include information on\n   o  the characteristic prefix, if any\n   o \
    \ how to interpret APL RRSets consisting of more than one RR\n   o  how to interpret\
    \ an empty APL RR\n   o  which address families are expected to appear in the\
    \ APL RRs for\n      that application\n   o  how to deal with APL RR list elements\
    \ which belong to other\n      address families, including those not yet defined\n\
    \   o  the exact semantics of list elements negated by the \"!\" character\n \
    \  Possible applications include the publication of address ranges\n   similar\
    \ to [RFC1101], description of zones built following [RFC2317]\n   and in-band\
    \ access control to limit general access or zone transfer\n   (AXFR) availability\
    \ for zone data held in DNS servers.\n   The specification of particular application\
    \ scenarios is out of the\n   scope of this document.\n"

- title: 9. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Security Considerations\n   Any information obtained from the DNS should be\
    \ regarded as unsafe\n   unless techniques specified in [RFC2535] or [RFC2845]\
    \ were used.  The\n   definition of a new RR type does not introduce security\
    \ problems into\n   the DNS, but usage of information made available by APL RRs\
    \ may\n   compromise security.  This includes disclosure of network topology\n\
    \   information and in particular the use of APL RRs to construct access\n   control\
    \ lists.\n"
- title: 10. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "10. IANA Considerations\n   This section is to be interpreted as following [RFC2434].\n\
    \   This document does not define any new namespaces.  It uses the 16 bit\n  \
    \ identifiers for address families maintained by IANA in\n   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.\n\
    \   The IANA assigned numeric RR type value 42 for APL [IANA].\n"
