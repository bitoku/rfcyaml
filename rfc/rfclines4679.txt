Abstract This document describes the set of Remote Authentication Dial
In User Service Vendor Specific Attributes (RADIUS VSAs) defined by the DSL Forum.
These attributes are designed to transport Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) information that is not supported by the standard RADIUS attribute set.
It is expected that this document will be updated if and when the DSL Forum defines additional vendor specific attributes, since its primary purpose is to provide a reference for DSL equipment vendors wishing to interoperate with other vendors' products.
The DSL Forum has created additional RADIUS [RFC2865] [RFC2866] vendor specific attributes to carry DSL line identification and characterization information.
This information is forwarded from the Access Node/DSLAM to the BRAS via Vendor Specific PPPoE Tags [RFC2516], DHCP Relay Options [RFC3046], and Vendor Specific Information Suboptions [RFC4243].
This document describes the subscriber line identification and characterization information and its mapping to RADIUS VSAs by the BRAS.
The information acquired may be used to provide authentication and accounting functionality.
It may also be collected and used for management and troubleshooting purposes.
The following sections define the usage and meaning of certain specialized terms in the context of this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Technical Terms and Acronyms AAL5
The Access Node/DSLAM is a DSL signal terminator that contains a minimum of one Ethernet interface that serves as its northbound interface into which it aggregates traffic from several Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
based (subscriber ports) or Ethernet based southbound interfaces.
A BNG is an IP edge router where bandwidth and QoS policies are applied; the functions performed by a BRAS are a superset of those performed by a BNG.
BRAS Broadband Remote Access Server.
A BRAS is a BNG and is the aggregation point for the subscriber traffic.
It provides aggregation capabilities (e.g., IP, PPP, Ethernet) between the access network and the core network.
Beyond its aggregation function, the BRAS is also an injection point for policy management and IP QoS in the access network.
DSL is a technology that allows digital data transmission over wires in the local telephone network.
DSLAM Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer.
DSLAM is a device that terminates DSL subscriber lines.
The data is aggregated and forwarded to ATM  or Ethernet based aggregation networks.
The FCS is a checksum added to an Ethernet frame for error detection/correction purposes.
IPoA IP over ATM IWF Interworking Function.
The set of functions required for interconnecting two networks of different technologies (e.g., ATM and Ethernet).
IWF is utilized to enable the carriage of PPP over ATM (PPPoA) traffic over PPPoE. LLC Logical Link Control 3.
The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this document.
These Attributes MAY be transmitted in one or more RADIUS Attributes of type Vendor Specific [RFC2865].
More than one attribute MAY be transmitted in a single Vendor Specific Attribute; if this is done, the attributes SHOULD be packed as a sequence of Vendor Type/Vendor Length/Value triples following the initial Type, Length, and Vendor Id fields.
DSL Forum RADIUS VSA Definition Description
This Attribute functions as a "container", encapsulating one or more vendor specific sub attributes; the encoding follows the recommendations in [RFC2865].
A summary of the generic DSL Forum VSA format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
Type 26 for Vendor Specific Length
This field MUST be set equal to the sum of the Vendor Length fields of the sub attributes contained in the Vendor Specific Attribute, plus six
This field MUST be set to decimal 3561, the enterprise number assigned to the ADSL Forum [IANA].
This field MUST contain one or more DSL Forum Vendor Specific sub attributes, as specified below.
DSL Forum Vendor Specific Sub Attribute Encoding A summary of the sub attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
The Vendor Type field is one octet in length and contains the sub attribute type, as assigned by the DSL Forum.
The Vendor Length field is one octet and indicates the length of the entire sub attribute, including the Vendor Type, Vendor Length, and Value fields.
The Value field is zero or more octets and contains information specific to the sub attribute.
The format and length of the Value field is determined by the Vendor Type and Vendor Length fields.
The format of the value field is one of 2 data types, string or integer [RFC2865].
The following sub sections define the DSL Forum vendor specific sub  attributes.
This Attribute contains information describing the subscriber agent circuit identifier corresponding to the logical access loop port of the Access Node/DSLAM from which a subscriber's requests are initiated.
It MAY be present in both Access Request and Accounting Request packets.
A summary of the Agent Circuit Id Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right. 0
Vendor Type 1 for Agent Circuit Id
The String field contains information about the Access Node to which the subscriber is attached, along with an identifier for the subscriber's DSL port on that Access Node.
The exact syntax of the string is implementation dependent; however, a typical practice is to subdivide it into two or more space separated components, one to identify the Access Node and another the subscriber line on that node, with perhaps an indication of whether that line is Ethernet or ATM.
Example formats for this string are shown below. "
Access Node Identifier atm slot/port:vpi.vci" (when ATM/DSL is used) "Access Node Identifier eth slot/port[:vlan id]" (when Ethernet/DSL is used)
An example showing the slot and port field encoding is given below: "[Relay identifier] atm 3/0:100.33" (slot   3, port   0,
The Access Node Identifier is a unique ASCII string that does not include 'space' characters.
The syntax of the slot and port fields reflects typical practices currently in place.
The exact manner in which slots are identified is Access Node/DSLAM implementation dependent.
The vpi, vci, and vlan i
d fields (when applicable) are related to a given access loop (U interface).
The Agent Remote Id Attribute contains an operator specific, statically configured string that uniquely identifies the subscriber on the associated access loop of the Access Node/DSLAM.
In a typical subscriber environment, multiple attributes can be used to identify the user, among others: Username (for example, as defined on a PPP client); Agent Circuit Id (a static
, pre defined string sent from the Access Node/DSLAM); Agent Remote Id (an operator defined string configured on and sent by the Access Node/DSLAM).
This Attribute MAY be included in both Access Request and Accounting Request packets.
A summary of the Agent Remote Id Attribute format is shown below.

1    Zero or one instances of this Attribute MAY be present in packet.
The security of these Attributes relies on an implied trust relationship between the Access Node/DSLAM and the BRAS.
The identifiers that are inserted by the Access Node/DSLAM are unconditionally trusted; the BRAS does not perform any validity check on the information received.
These Attributes are intended to be used in environments in which the network infrastructure (the Access Node/DSLAM, the BRAS, and the entire network in which those two devices reside) is trusted and secure.
As used in this document, the word "trusted" implies that unauthorized traffic cannot enter the network except through secured and trusted devices and that all devices internal to the network are secure and trusted.
Careful consideration should be given to the potential security vulnerabilities that are present in this model before deploying this option in actual networks.
The Attributes described in this document neither increase nor decrease the security of the RADIUS protocol.
For discussions of various RADIUS vulnerabilities, see [RFC2607], [RFC3579], [RFC3162], and [RFC3580].
