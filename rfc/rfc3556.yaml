  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), RFC 3550 [1], includes
    a\n   control protocol RTCP which provides synchronization information from\n
    \  data senders and feedback information from data receivers.\n   Normally, the
    amount of bandwidth allocated to RTCP in an RTP session\n   is 5% of the session
    bandwidth.  For some applications, it may be\n   appropriate to specify the RTCP
    bandwidth independently of the\n   session bandwidth.  Using a separate parameter
    allows rate-adaptive\n   applications to set an RTCP bandwidth consistent with
    a \"typical\"\n   data bandwidth that is lower than the maximum bandwidth specified
    by\n   the session bandwidth parameter.  That allows the RTCP bandwidth to\n   be
    kept under 5% of the data bandwidth when the rate has been adapted\n   downward.\n
    \  On the other hand, there may be applications that send data at very\n   low
    rates but need to communicate extra RTCP information, such as APP\n   packets.
    \ These applications may need to specify RTCP bandwidth that\n   is higher than
    5% of the data bandwidth.\n   The RTP specification allows a profile to specify
    that the RTCP\n   bandwidth may be divided into two separate session parameters
    for\n   those participants which are active data senders and those which are\n
    \  not.  Using two parameters allows RTCP reception reports to be turned\n   off
    entirely for a particular session by setting the RTCP bandwidth\n   for non-data-senders
    to zero while keeping the RTCP bandwidth for\n   data senders non-zero so that
    sender reports can still be sent for\n   inter-media synchronization.  Turning
    off RTCP reception reports is\n   not recommended because they are needed for
    the functions listed in\n   the RTP specification, particularly reception quality
    feedback and\n   congestion control.  However, doing so may be appropriate for
    systems\n   operating on unidirectional links or for sessions that do not require\n
    \  feedback on the quality of reception or liveness of receivers and\n   that
    have other means to avoid congestion.\n   This memo defines an extension to the
    Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP) [3] to specify RTCP bandwidth for senders
    and non-senders\n   (receivers).\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  SDP Extensions\n   The Session Description Protocol includes an optional
    bandwidth\n   attribute with the following syntax:\n      b=<modifier>:<bandwidth-value>\n
    \  where <modifier> is a single alphanumeric word giving the meaning of\n   the
    bandwidth figure, and where the default units for <bandwidth-\n   value> are kilobits
    per second.  This attribute specifies the\n   proposed bandwidth to be used by
    the session or media.\n   A typical use is with the modifier \"AS\" (for Application
    Specific\n   Maximum) which may be used to specify the total bandwidth for a\n
    \  single media stream from one site (source).\n   This memo defines two additional
    bandwidth modifiers:\n      b=RS:<bandwidth-value>\n      b=RR:<bandwidth-value>\n
    \  where \"RS\" indicates the RTCP bandwidth allocated to active data\n   senders
    (as defined by the RTP spec) and \"RR\" indicates the RTCP\n   bandwidth allocated
    to other participants in the RTP session (i.e.,\n   receivers).  The exact behavior
    induced by specifying these bandwidth\n   modifiers depends upon the algorithm
    used to calculate the RTCP\n   reporting interval.  Different algorithms may be
    specified by\n   different RTP profiles.\n   For the RTP A/V Profile [2], which
    specifies that the default RTCP\n   interval algorithm defined in the RTP spec
    [1] is to be used, at\n   least RS/(RS+RR) of the RTCP bandwidth is dedicated
    to active data\n   senders.  If the proportion of senders to total participants
    is less\n   than or equal to RS/(RS+RR), each sender gets RS divided by the\n
    \  number of senders.  When the proportion of senders is greater than\n   RS/(RS+RR),
    the senders get their proportion of the sum of these\n   parameters, which means
    that a sender and a non-sender each get the\n   same allocation.  Therefore, it
    is not possible to constrain the data\n   senders to use less RTCP bandwidth than
    is allowed for non-senders.\n   A few special cases are worth noting:\n      o
    \ If RR is zero, then the proportion of participants that are\n         senders
    can never be greater than RS/(RS+RR), and therefore\n         non-senders never
    get any RTCP bandwidth independent of the\n         number of senders.\n      o
    \ Setting RS to zero does not mean that data senders are not\n         allowed
    to send RTCP packets, it only means that they are\n         treated the same as
    non-senders.  The proportion of senders (if\n         there are any) would always
    be greater than RS/(RS+RR) if RR is\n         non-zero.\n      o  If RS and RR
    are both zero, it would be unwise to attempt\n         calculation of the fraction
    RS/(RS+RR).\n   The bandwidth allocation specified by the RS and RR modifiers
    applies\n   to the total bandwidth consumed by all RTCP packet types, including\n
    \  SR, RR, SDES, BYE, APP and any new types defined in the future.  The\n   <bandwidth-value>
    for these modifiers is in units of bits per second\n   with an integer value.\n
    \     NOTE:  This specification was in conflict with the initial SDP\n      spec
    in RFC 2327 which prescribes that the <bandwidth-value> for\n      all bandwidth
    modifiers should be an integer number of kilobits\n      per second.  This discrepancy
    was forced by the fact that the\n      desired RTCP bandwidth setting may be less
    than 1 kb/s.\n      At the 44th IETF meeting in Minneapolis, two solutions were\n
    \     considered: allow fractional values, or specify that the units for\n      these
    particular modifiers would be in bits per second.  The\n      second choice was
    preferred so that the syntax would not be\n      changed.  The SDP spec is being
    modified [4] to advance to Draft\n      Standard, and will allow this change in
    semantics.\n"

  - "3.  Default values\n   If either or both of the RS and RR bandwidth specifiers
    are omitted,\n   the default values for these parameters are as specified in the
    RTP\n   profile in use for the session in question.  For the Audio/Video\n   Profile,
    RFC 3551 [2], the defaults follow the recommendations of the\n   RTP spec:\n      o
    \ The total RTCP bandwidth is 5% of the session bandwidth.  If\n         one of
    these RTCP bandwidth specifiers is omitted, its value is\n         5% minus the
    value of the other one, but not less than zero.\n         If both are omitted,
    the sender and receiver RTCP bandwidths\n         are 1.25% and 3.75% of the session
    bandwidth, respectively.\n      o  At least RS/(RS+RR) of of the RTCP bandwidth
    is dedicated to\n         active data senders.  When the proportion of senders
    is greater\n         than RS/(RS+RR) of the participants, the senders get their\n
    \        proportion of the sum of these parameters.\n   This memo does not impose
    limits on the values that may be specified\n   with the RR and RS modifiers, other
    than that they must be non-\n   negative.  However, the RTP specification and
    the appropriate RTP\n   profile may specify limits.\n"

  - "4.  Precedence\n   An SDP description consists of a session-level description
    (details\n   that apply to the whole session and all media streams) and zero or\n
    \  more media-level descriptions (details that apply only to a single\n   media
    stream).  Bandwidth specifiers may be present either at the\n   session level
    to specify the total bandwidth shared by all media, or\n   in the media sections
    to specify the bandwidth allocated to each\n   medium, or both.  This is true
    for the two RTCP bandwidth modifiers\n   defined here as well.\n   Since the bandwidth
    allocated to RTCP is a fraction of the session\n   bandwidth when not specified
    explicitly using the modifiers defined\n   here, there is an interaction between
    the session bandwidth and RTCP\n   bandwidth specifiers at the session and media
    levels of the SDP\n   description.  The precedence of these specifiers is as follows,
    with\n   (1) being the highest precedence:\n   1) Explicit RR or RS specifier
    at media level\n   2) Explicit RR or RS specifier at session level\n   3) Default
    based on session bandwidth specifier at media level\n   4) Default based on session
    bandwidth specifier at session level\n   In particular, the relationship of (2)
    and (3) means that if the RR\n   bandwidth is specified as zero at the session
    level, that turns off\n   RTCP transmission for non-data-senders in all media.\n"

    \  In this example, the explicit RTCP bandwidths for the audio medium\n   are
    equal to the defaults and so could be omitted.  However, for the\n   video medium,
    the RTCP bandwidths have been set according to a data\n   bandwidth of 64 kb/s
    even though the maximum data bandwidth is\n   specified as 256 kb/s.  This is
    based on the assumption that the\n   video data bandwidth will automatically adapt
    to a lower value based\n   on network conditions.\n"

    be registered with\n   IANA by reference to a standards-track RFC specifying the
    semantics\n   of the bandwidth modifier precisely, indicating when it should be\n
    \  used, and why the existing registered bandwidth specifiers do not\n   suffice.\n
    \  This document is intended to satisfy those requirements.\n   In the \"bwtype\"
    table of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\n   Parameters registry, the following
    two new bandwidth modifier names\n   have been registered:\n      RS\n      RR\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This memo defines bandwidth modifier keywords
    as an extension to SDP,\n   so the security considerations listed in the SDP specification
    apply\n   to session descriptions containing these modifiers as with any other.\n
    \  The bandwidth value supplied with one of these modifiers could be\n   unreasonably
    large and cause the application to send RTCP packets at\n   an excessive rate,
    resulting in a denial of service.  This is similar\n   to the risk that an unreasonable
    bandwidth could be specified for the\n   media data, though encoders generally
    have a limited bandwidth range.\n   Applications should apply validity checks
    to all parameters received\n   in an SDP description, particularly one which is
    not authenticated.\n   This memo cannot specify limits because they are dependent
    on the RTP\n   profile and application.\n"
