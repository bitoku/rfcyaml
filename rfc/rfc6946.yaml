  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header\n\
    \   without the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces (we\n  \
    \ refer to these packets as \"atomic fragments\").  Such packets are\n   typically\
    \ sent by hosts that have received an ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\"\n   error message\
    \ that advertises a Next-Hop MTU smaller than 1280 bytes,\n   and are currently\
    \ processed by some implementations as normal\n   \"fragmented traffic\" (i.e.,\
    \ they are \"reassembled\" with any other\n   queued fragments that supposedly\
    \ correspond to the same original\n   packet).  Thus, an attacker can cause hosts\
    \ to employ atomic\n   fragments by forging ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" error messages,\
    \ and then\n   launch any fragmentation-based attacks against such traffic.  This\n\
    \   document discusses the generation of the aforementioned atomic\n   fragments\
    \ and the corresponding security implications.  Additionally,\n   this document\
    \ formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722, such that IPv6\n   atomic fragments\
    \ are processed independently of any other fragments,\n   thus completely eliminating\
    \ the aforementioned attack vector.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2460] specifies the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism, which\
    \ allows\n   IPv6 packets to be fragmented into smaller pieces such that they\
    \ fit\n   in the Path-MTU to the intended destination(s).  [RFC2460] allows\n\
    \   fragments to overlap, thus leading to ambiguity in the result of the\n   reassembly\
    \ process, which could be leveraged by attackers to bypass\n   firewall rules\
    \ and/or evade Network Intrusion Detection Systems\n   (NIDS) [RFC5722].\n   [RFC5722]\
    \ forbids overlapping fragments, specifying that when\n   overlapping fragments\
    \ are detected, all the fragments corresponding\n   to that packet must be silently\
    \ discarded.\n   As specified in Section 5 of [RFC2460], when a host receives\
    \ an\n   ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" message advertising a \"Next-Hop MTU\" smaller\n\
    \   than 1280 (the minimum IPv6 MTU), it is not required to reduce the\n   assumed\
    \ Path-MTU, but must simply include a Fragment Header in all\n   subsequent packets\
    \ sent to that destination.  The resulting packets\n   will thus not actually\
    \ be fragmented into several pieces but will\n   just include a Fragment Header\
    \ with both the \"Fragment Offset\" and\n   the \"M\" flag set to 0 (we refer\
    \ to these packets as \"atomic\n   fragments\").  IPv6/IPv4 translators employ\
    \ the Fragment\n   Identification information found in the Fragment Header to\
    \ select an\n   appropriate Fragment Identification value for the resulting IPv4\n\
    \   fragments.\n   While these packets are really atomic fragments (they can be\n\
    \   processed by the IPv6 module and handed to the upper-layer protocol\n   without\
    \ waiting for any other fragments), many IPv6 implementations\n   process them\
    \ as regular fragments.  Namely, they try to perform IPv6\n   fragment reassembly\
    \ with the atomic fragment and any other fragments\n   already queued with the\
    \ same set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6\n   Destination Address, Fragment Identification}.\
    \  For example, in the\n   case of IPv6 implementations that have been updated\
    \ to support\n   [RFC5722], if a fragment with the same {IPv6 Source Address,\
    \ IPv6\n   Destination Address, Fragment Identification} is already queued for\n\
    \   reassembly at a host when an atomic fragment is received with the\n   same\
    \ set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment\n   Identification},\
    \ and both fragments overlap, all the fragments will\n   be silently discarded.\n\
    \   Processing of IPv6 atomic fragments as regular fragmented packets\n   clearly\
    \ provides an unnecessary vector to perform fragmentation-based\n   attacks against\
    \ non-fragmented traffic (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that are\n   not really split into\
    \ multiple pieces but that just include a\n   Fragment Header).\n   IPv6 fragmentation\
    \ attacks have been discussed in great detail in\n   [PREDICTABLE-ID] and [CPNI-IPv6],\
    \ and [RFC5722] describes a specific\n   firewall-circumvention attack that could\
    \ be performed by leveraging\n   overlapping fragments.  The possible IPv6 fragmentation-based\
    \ attacks\n   are, in most cases, \"ports\" of the IPv4 fragmentation attacks\n\
    \   discussed in [RFC6274].\n   Section 3 describes the generation of IPv6 atomic\
    \ fragments and how\n   they can be remotely \"triggered\" by a remote attacker.\
    \  Section 4\n   formally updates [RFC2460] and [RFC5722] such that the aforementioned\n\
    \   attack vector is eliminated.  Appendix A contains a survey of the\n   generation\
    \ and processing of IPv6 atomic fragments in different\n   versions of a number\
    \ of popular IPv6 implementations.\n"

- title: 3.  Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments
  contents:
  - "3.  Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments\n   Section 5 of [RFC2460] states:\n\
    \      \"In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv4 destination\n \
    \     (i.e., a packet that undergoes translation from IPv6 to IPv4), the\n   \
    \   originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message\n      reporting\
    \ a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  In that case, the IPv6\n      node is not required\
    \ to reduce the size of subsequent packets to\n      less than 1280, but must\
    \ include a Fragment header in those\n      packets so that the IPv6-to-IPv4 translating\
    \ router can obtain a\n      suitable Identification value to use in resulting\
    \ IPv4 fragments.\n      Note that this means the payload may have to be reduced\
    \ to 1232\n      octets (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the Fragment\n\
    \      header), and smaller still if additional extension headers are\n      used.\"\
    \n   This means that any ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" message advertising a\n   \"\
    Next-Hop MTU\" smaller than 1280 could trigger the generation of the\n   so-called\
    \ \"atomic fragments\" (i.e., IPv6 datagrams that include a\n   Fragment Header\
    \ but that are composed of a single fragment, with both\n   the \"Fragment Offset\"\
    \ and the \"M\" fields of the Fragment Header set\n   to 0).  This can be leveraged\
    \ to perform a variety of fragmentation-\n   based attacks [PREDICTABLE-ID] [CPNI-IPv6].\n\
    \      For example, an attacker could forge IPv6 fragments with an\n      appropriate\
    \ {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address,\n      Fragment Identification}\
    \ tuple, such that these malicious\n      fragments are incorrectly \"reassembled\"\
    \ by the destination host\n      together with some of the legitimate fragments\
    \ of the original\n      packet, thus leading to packet drops (and a potential\
    \ denial of\n      service).\n   From a security standpoint, this situation is\
    \ exacerbated by the\n   following factors:\n   o  Many implementations fail to\
    \ perform validation checks on the\n      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended\
    \ in Section 5.2 of\n      [RFC4443] and documented in [RFC5927].  It should be\
    \ noted that in\n      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)\n\
    \      been elicited by a connectionless transport protocol (or some\n      other\
    \ connectionless protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may\n      be virtually\
    \ impossible to perform validation checks on the\n      received ICMPv6 error\
    \ messages.\n   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 \"Packet Too\
    \ Big\"\n      error messages, the Destination Cache [RFC4861] is usually updated\n\
    \      to reflect that any subsequent packets to that destination should\n   \
    \   include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6\n      \"Packet\
    \ Too Big\" error message might affect multiple communication\n      instances\
    \ (e.g., TCP connections) with that IPv6 destination\n      address.\n   o  Some\
    \ implementations employ predictable Fragment Identification\n      values, thus\
    \ greatly improving the chances of an attacker\n      successfully performing\
    \ fragmentation-based attacks\n      [PREDICTABLE-ID].\n"
- title: 4.  Updating RFC 2460 and RFC 5722
  contents:
  - "4.  Updating RFC 2460 and RFC 5722\n   Section 4.5 of [RFC2460] and Section 4\
    \ of [RFC5722] are updated as\n   follows:\n      A host that receives an IPv6\
    \ packet that includes a Fragment\n      Header with the \"Fragment Offset\" equal\
    \ to 0 and the \"M\" flag\n      equal to 0 MUST process that packet in isolation\
    \ from any other\n      packets/fragments, even if such packets/fragments contain\
    \ the same\n      set {IPv6 Source Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment\n\
    \      Identification}.  A received atomic fragment should be\n      \"reassembled\"\
    \ from the contents of that sole fragment.\n         The Unfragmentable Part of\
    \ the reassembled packet consists of\n         all headers up to, but not including,\
    \ the Fragment Header of\n         the received atomic fragment.\n         The\
    \ Next Header field of the last header of the Unfragmentable\n         Part of\
    \ the reassembled packet is obtained from the Next Header\n         field of the\
    \ Fragment Header of the received atomic fragment.\n         The Payload Length\
    \ of the reassembled packet is obtained by\n         subtracting the length of\
    \ the Fragment Header (that is, 8) from\n         the Payload Length of the received\
    \ atomic fragment.\n      Additionally, if any fragments with the same set {IPv6\
    \ Source\n      Address, IPv6 Destination Address, Fragment Identification} are\n\
    \      present in the fragment reassembly queue when the atomic fragment\n   \
    \   is received, such fragments MUST NOT be discarded upon receipt of\n      the\
    \ \"colliding\" IPv6 atomic fragment, since IPv6 atomic fragments\n      MUST\
    \ NOT interfere with \"normal\" fragmented traffic.\n"
