  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP has three main components:\n   1. A method for encapsulating
    multi-protocol datagrams.\n   2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,
    configuring,\n      and testing the data-link connection.\n   3. A family of Network
    Control Protocols for establishing and\n      configuring different network-layer
    protocols.\n   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link,
    each\n   end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to configure and test\n
    \  the data link.  After the link has been established and optional\n   facilities
    have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, PPP must send\n   SNACP packets to
    choose and configure the SNA network-layer protocol.\n   Once SNACP has reached
    the Opened state, SNA datagrams can be sent\n   over the link.\n   The link will
    remain configured for communications until explicit LCP\n   or SNACP packets close
    the link down, or until some external event\n   occurs (an inactivity timer expires
    or network administrator\n   intervention).\n"

    - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are
      used to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are

      of the specification.\n   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective \"recommended\",
      means that there\n             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances

    - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n
      \  datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).\n             A
      datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets\n             passed to
      the data link layer.\n   frame     The unit of transmission at the data link
      layer.  A frame\n             may include a header and/or a trailer, along with
      some\n             number of units of data.\n   packet    The basic unit of
      encapsulation, which is passed across the\n             interface between the
      network layer and the data link\n             layer.  A packet is usually mapped
      to a frame; the\n             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation
      is being\n             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated
      into a\n             single frame.\n   peer      The other end of the point-to-point
      link.\n   silently discard\n             This means the implementation discards
      the packet without\n             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD
      provide the\n             capability of logging the error, including the contents
      of\n             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n
      \            in a statistics counter.\n   PIU       Path information unit.  A
      message unit consisting of a\n             transmission header (TH) alone, or
      a TH followed by a basic\n             information unit (BIU) or a BIU segment.
      \ PIU is analogous\n             to datagram.\n   TH        Transmission header.
      \ Control information, optionally\n             followed by a basic information
      unit (BIU) or a BIU\n             segment, that is created and used by path
      control to route\n             message units and to control their flow within
      the network.\n   BIU       Basic information unit.  In SNA, the unit of data
      and\n             control information passed between half-sessions.  It\n             consists
      of a request/response header (RH) followed by a\n             request/response
      unit (RU).\n   message unit\n             In SNA, the unit of data processed
      by any layer; for\n             example, a basic information unit (BIU), a path
      information\n             unit (PIU), or a request/response unit (RU).\n   NLP
      \      Network Layer Packet.  In High Performance Routing (HPR),\n             the
      message unit used to carry data over the route.\n             Network Layer
      Packet is analogous to datagram.\n"

  - "2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for SNA\n   The SNA Control Protocol (SNACP)
    is responsible for configuring,\n   enabling, and disabling SNA on both ends of
    the point-to-point link.\n   SNACP uses the same packet exchange mechanism as
    the Link Control\n   Protocol (LCP). SNACP packets may not be exchanged until
    PPP has\n   reached the Network-Layer Protocol phase.  SNACP packets received\n
    \  before this phase is reached should be silently discarded.\n   Note that there
    are actually two SNA Network Control Protocols; one\n   for SNA over LLC 802.2
    and another for SNA without LLC 802.2.  These\n   SNA NCPs are negotiated separately
    and independently of each other.\n   The SNA Control Protocol is exactly the same
    as the Link Control\n   Protocol [1] with the following exceptions:\n   Frame
    Modifications\n      The packet may utilize any modifications to the basic frame
    format\n      which have been negotiated during the Link Establishment phase.\n
    \  Data Link Layer Protocol Field\n      Exactly one SNACP packet is encapsulated
    in the PPP Information\n      field, where the PPP Protocol field indicates type
    hex 804B (SNA\n      over LLC 802.2) or hex 804D (SNA).\n   Code field\n      Only
    Codes 1 through 7 (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack,\n      Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject,
    Terminate-Request, Terminate-Ack\n      and Code-Reject) are used.  Other Codes
    should be treated as\n      unrecognized and should result in Code-Rejects.\n
    \  Timeouts\n      SNACP packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the\n
    \     Network-Layer Protocol phase. An implementation should be prepared\n      to
    wait for Authentication and Link Quality Determination to\n      finish before
    timing out waiting for a Configure-Ack or other\n      response.  It is suggested
    that an implementation give up only\n      after user intervention or a configurable
    amount of time.\n   Configuration Option Types\n      There are no Configuration
    Options for SNA or for SNA over LLC\n      802.2.\n"

    PPP must reach the\n   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the appropriate SNA Control\n
    \  Protocol must reach the Opened state.\n   The maximum length of a SNA packet
    transmitted over a PPP link is the\n   same as the maximum length of the Information
    field of a PPP\n   encapsulated packet.\n   The format of the PPP Information
    field itself is the same as that\n   defined in [1].  Detailed information on
    SNA and APPN can be found in\n   [3], [4], [5], [6], and [7].\n"
