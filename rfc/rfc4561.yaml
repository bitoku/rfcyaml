  - "1.  Introduction\n   MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) [FAST-REROUTE] is a fast recovery\
    \ local\n   protection technique used to protect Traffic Engineering LSPs from\n\
    \   link/node/Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failure.  One or more backup\n   tunnels\
    \ are pre-established to protect against the failure of a\n   link/node/SRLG.\
    \  In case of failure, every protected TE LSP\n   traversing the failed resource\
    \ is rerouted onto the appropriate\n   backup tunnel.\n   There are several requirements\
    \ on the backup tunnel path that must be\n   satisfied.  First, the backup tunnel\
    \ must not traverse the element\n   that it protects.  In addition, a primary\
    \ tunnel and its associated\n   backup tunnel should intersect at least at two\
    \ points (nodes): Point\n   of Local Repair (PLR) and Merge Point (MP).  The former\
    \ is the head-\n   end LSR of the backup tunnel, and the latter is the tail-end\
    \ LSR of\n   the backup tunnel.  The PLR is where FRR is triggered when\n   link/node/SRLG\
    \ failure happens.\n   There are different methods for computing paths for backup\
    \ tunnels at\n   a given PLR.  Specifically, a user can statically configure one\
    \ or\n   more backup tunnels at the PLR with an explicitly configured path, or\n\
    \   the PLR can be configured to automatically compute a backup path or\n   to\
    \ send a path computation request to a PCE (see [PCE-ARCH]).\n   Consider the\
    \ following scenario (Figure 1).\n   Assumptions:\n   - A multi-area network made\
    \ of three areas: 0, 1, and 2.\n   - A fast reroutable TE LSP T1 (TE LSP signaled\
    \ with the \"Local\n     Protection Desired\" bit set in the SESSION-ATTRIBUTE\
    \ object or the\n     FAST-REROUTE object) from R0 to R3.\n   - A backup tunnel\
    \ B1 from R1 to R2, not traversing ABR1, and\n     following the R1-ABR3-R2 path.\n\
    \   - The PLR R1 reroutes any protected TE LSP traversing ABR1 onto the\n    \
    \ backup tunnel B1 in case of ABR1's failure.\n             <--- area 1 --><---area\
    \ 0---><---area 2--->\n                R0-----R1-ABR1--R2------ABR2--------R3\n\
    \                       \\        /\n                        \\      /\n     \
    \                     ABR3\n      Figure 1: Use of Fast Reroute to protect a TE\
    \ LSP against an ABR\n                failure with MPLS Traffic Engineering Fast\
    \ Reroute\n   When T1 is first signaled, the PLR R1 needs to dynamically select\
    \ an\n   appropriate backup tunnel intersecting T1 on a downstream LSR.\n   However,\
    \ existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to\n   unambiguously find the\
    \ MP address in a network with inter-domain TE\n   LSP.  This document addresses\
    \ these limitations.\n   R1 needs to select an existing backup tunnel with the\
    \ following\n   properties:\n      1. The backup tunnel intersects with the primary\
    \ tunnel at the MP.\n         For the sake of illustration, in Figure 1, R1 needs\
    \ to\n         determine that T1 and B1 intersect at the node R2.\n      2. The\
    \ backup tunnel satisfies the primary LSP's request with\n         respect to\
    \ the bandwidth protection request (i.e., bandwidth\n         guaranteed for the\
    \ primary tunnel during failure), and the type\n         of protection (link or\
    \ node failure), as specified in\n         [FAST-REROUTE].\n   One technique for\
    \ the PLR to ensure that condition (1) is met\n   consists of examining the Record\
    \ Route Object (RRO) of the primary\n   tunnel to see whether any of the addresses\
    \ specified in the RRO\n   correspond to the MP.  That said, as per [RSVP-TE],\
    \ the addresses\n   specified in the RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects sent in Resv\
    \ messages\n   can be node-ids and/or interface addresses.  Hence, in Figure 1,\n\
    \   router R2 may specify interface addresses in the RROs for T1 and B1.\n   Note\
    \ that these interface addresses are different in this example.\n   The problem\
    \ of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-\n   ids can be easily\
    \ solved in the case of a single IGP area.\n   Specifically, in the case of a\
    \ single IGP area, the PLR has the\n   knowledge of all the interfaces attached\
    \ to the tail-end of the\n   backup tunnel.  This information is available in\
    \ PLR's IGP topology\n   database.  Thus, the PLR can unambiguously determine\
    \ whether a backup\n   tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on a downstream\
    \ node exists\n   and can also find the MP address regardless of how the addresses\n\
    \   carried in the RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects are specified (i.e.,\n   whether\
    \ using the interface addresses or the node-ids).  However,\n   such routing information\
    \ is not available in the case of inter-domain\n   environments.  Hence, unambiguously\
    \ making sure that condition (1)\n   above is met in the case of inter-domain\
    \ TE LSPs is not possible with\n   existing mechanisms.\n   In this document,\
    \ we define extensions to and describe the use of\n   Resource Reservation Protocol\
    \ (RSVP) [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to solve the\n   above-mentioned problem.  Note that\
    \ the requirement for the support\n   of the fast recovery technique specified\
    \ in [FAST-REROUTE] to inter-\n   domain TE LSPs has been specified in [INTER-AREA-TE-REQS]\
    \ and\n   [INTER-AS-TE-REQS].\n"

- title: 3.  Signaling Node-Ids in RROs
  contents:
  - "3.  Signaling Node-Ids in RROs\n   As mentioned above, the limitation that we\
    \ need to address is the\n   generality of the contents of the RRO IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ sub-objects, as\n   defined in [RSVP-TE].  [RSVP-TE] defines the IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ RRO sub-\n   objects.  Moreover, two additional flags are defined in\n   [FAST-REROUTE]:\
    \ the \"Local Protection Available\" and \"Local\n   Protection in Use\" bits.\n\
    \   In this document, we define the following new flag:\n   Node-id: 0x20\n  \
    \    When set, this indicates that the address specified in the RRO's\n      IPv4\
    \ or IPv6 sub-object is a node-id address, which refers to the\n      \"Router\
    \ Address\" as defined in [OSPF-TE], or \"Traffic Engineering\n      Router ID\"\
    \ as defined in [ISIS-TE].  A node MUST use the same\n      address consistently.\
    \  Once an address is used in the RRO's IPv4\n      or IPv6 sub-object, it SHOULD\
    \ always be used for the lifetime of\n      the TE LSP.\n   An IPv4 or IPv6 RRO\
    \ sub-object with the node-id flag set is also\n   called a node-id sub-object.\
    \  The problem of finding an MP address in\n   a network with inter-domain TE\
    \ LSP is solved by inserting a node-id\n   sub-object (an RRO \"IPv4\" and \"\
    IPv6\" sub-object with the 0x20 flag\n   set) in the RRO object carried in the\
    \ RSVP Resv message.\n   An implementation may decide to either:\n   1) Add the\
    \ node-id sub-object in the RRO carried in an RSVP Resv\n      message and, when\
    \ required, also add another IPv4/IPv6 sub-object\n      to record interface address.\n\
    \      Example: an inter-domain fast reroutable TE LSP would have the\n      following\
    \ two sub-objects in the RRO carried in Resv message: a\n      node-id sub-object\
    \ and a label sub-object.  If recording the\n      interface address is required,\
    \ then an additional IPv4/IPv6 sub-\n      object is added.\n   or\n   2) Add\
    \ an IPv4/IPv6 sub-object recording the interface address and,\n      when required,\
    \ add a node-id sub-object in the RRO.\n      Example: an inter-domain fast reroutable\
    \ TE LSP would have the\n      following three sub-objects in the RRO carried\
    \ in Resv message: an\n      IPv4/IPv6 sub-object recording interface address,\
    \ a label sub-\n      object, and a node-id sub-object.\n   Note also that the\
    \ node-id sub-object may have other applications\n   than Fast Reroute backup\
    \ tunnel selection.  Moreover, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that an LSR recording a node-id\
    \ address in an IPv4/IPv6\n   RRO sub-object also set the node-id flag.\n"
- title: 4.  Finding Merge Point
  contents:
  - "4.  Finding Merge Point\n   Two cases should be considered:\n   - Case 1: If\
    \ the backup tunnel destination is the MP's node-id, then\n     a PLR can find\
    \ the MP and suitable backup tunnel by simply\n     comparing the backup tunnel's\
    \ destination address with the node-id\n     included in the RRO of the primary\
    \ tunnel.\n   - Case 2: If the backup tunnel terminates at an address different\n\
    \     from the MP's node-id, then a node-id sub-object MUST also be\n     included\
    \ in the RRO of the backup tunnel.  A PLR can find the MP\n     and suitable backup\
    \ tunnel by simply comparing the node-ids present\n     in the RROs of both the\
    \ primary and backup tunnels.\n   It must be noted that although the technique\
    \ described in this\n   document for selecting an appropriate backup tunnel using\
    \ the node-id\n   sub-object applies to the case of Inter-area and Inter-AS, in\
    \ the\n   case of Inter-AS, the assumption is made that the MP's node-id (of\n\
    \   the downstream domain) does not overlap with any LSR's node-id\n   present\
    \ in the PLR's AS.\n   When both IPv4 node-id and IPv6 node-id sub-objects are\
    \ present, a\n   PLR may use any or both of them in finding the MP address.\n"
