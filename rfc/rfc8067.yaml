- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3967] notes the importance of assuring that normative\
    \ references\n   from Standards Track and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents\
    \ are\n   appropriately mature, and specifies a process for allowing normative\n\
    \   references to documents at lower maturity levels (\"downrefs\").  That\n \
    \  process starts at IETF Last Call (see Section 3 of [RFC3967]):\n      For Standards\
    \ Track or BCP documents requiring normative reference\n      to documents of\
    \ lower maturity, the normal IETF Last Call\n      procedure will be issued, with\
    \ the need for the downward reference\n      explicitly documented in the Last\
    \ Call itself.  Any community\n      comments on the appropriateness of downward\
    \ references will be\n      considered by the IESG as part of its deliberations.\n\
    \   Section 2 of [RFC3967] lists some conditions under which downrefs may\n  \
    \ make sense.  In addition to those, it has become common for working\n   groups\
    \ to produce foundational documents (which contain important\n   information such\
    \ as terminology definitions and architectural design\n   and considerations)\
    \ at Informational status, and those documents are\n   often needed as normative\
    \ references in the Standards Track protocol\n   documents that follow.\n   The\
    \ requirement to explicitly mention the downrefs and the need for\n   them in\
    \ the Last Call message has proven to be unnecessarily\n   restrictive and has\
    \ often resulted in unnecessary repetitions of Last\n   Call, with the corresponding\
    \ delay and with no real benefit.\n"
- title: 2.  The IESG's Responsibility with Respect to Downrefs
  contents:
  - "2.  The IESG's Responsibility with Respect to Downrefs\n   The process in RFC\
    \ 3967 is hereby updated to specify that explicitly\n   documenting the downward\
    \ references in the Last Call message is\n   strongly recommended but not required.\
    \  The responsible AD should\n   still check for downrefs before sending out the\
    \ Last Call notice, but\n   if an undetected downref is noticed during Last Call\
    \ or IESG review,\n   any need to repeat the Last Call is at the discretion of\
    \ the IESG.\n   However, the process in RFC 3967 is not fundamentally altered:\
    \ If the\n   IESG decides not to repeat the Last Call, the status of the affected\n\
    \   downrefs is not changed, and the process in RFC 3967 will still apply\n  \
    \ if those downrefs are used in the future.\n   This gives the IESG the responsibility\
    \ to determine the actual\n   maturity level of the downward reference with respect\
    \ to the document\n   at hand, and to decide whether or not it is necessary to\
    \ explicitly\n   ask the IETF community for comments on the downref on a case-by-case\n\
    \   basis.  In making that decision, the IESG should take into account\n   the\
    \ general discussion in RFC 3967.  The responsible AD should make\n   sure that\
    \ the omission is recorded as a comment in the datatracker.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Referencing immature protocols can have security\
    \ and stability\n   implications, and the IESG should take that into account when\n\
    \   deciding whether re-consulting the community is useful.\n"
