    \   transmission of network-protocol datagrams, encapsulated in HDLC\n   frames\
    \ with 16 bit addressing, over SONET/SDH.  The primary\n   difference with MAPOS\
    \ version 1 is that it has 16 bit address field\n   that offers significant wide\
    \ address space. This document is NOT the\n   product of an IETF working group\

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   MAPOS is a multiple access protocol for transmission of High-level\n\
    \   Datalink Control (HDLC) frames over the Synchronous Optical Network /\n  \
    \ Synchronous Digital Hierarchy(SONET/SDH)[1][2][3][4]. It provides\n   multiple\
    \ access capability to SONET/SDH, an inherently point-to-point\n   link.\n   MAPOS\
    \ version 1[5] focuses on the frame format compatibility with the\n   conventional\
    \ PPP[6], resulting with its narrow 8 bit address field.\n   In contrast to MAPOS\
    \ version 1, MAPOS 16 has a 16 bit address space.\n   In this document, header\
    \ format and its 16 bit format are described.\n   It also explains that 16 bit\
    \ addressing has minimal influence on the\n   conventional MAPOS protocol family\
    \ such as Node-Switch Protocol[7]\n   and Switch-Switch Protocol[8].\n"
- title: 2. MAPOS 16 Frame Format
  contents:
  - "2. MAPOS 16 Frame Format\n   Like MAPOS version 1, MAPOS 16 framing is based\
    \ on the HDLC-like\n   framing used in PPP-over-SONET/SDH, described in RFC-1662[6].\n\
    \   However, the address field is extended to 16 bits, and the control\n   field\
    \ in the MAPOS version 1 is omitted for maintain the 32bit\n   alignment of the\
    \ header.\n   Figure 2 shows the MAPOS 16 frame format.  Logical Link Control\n\
    \   (LLC), and Sublayer/Sub-Network Access Protocol (SNAP) are not used.\n   It\
    \ does not include the bytes for transparency.  The fields are\n   transmitted\
    \ from left to right.\n           +----------+---------------------+----------+\n\

    \                        Figure 2.  Frame format\n     Flag Sequence\n     Flag\
    \ sequence is used for frame synchronization.  Each frame begins\n     and ends\
    \ with a flag sequence 01111110 (0x7E).  If a frame\n     immediately follows\
    \ another, one flag sequence may be treated as\n     the end of the preceding\
    \ frame and the beginning of the immediately\n     following frame.  When the\
    \ line is idle, the flag sequence is to be\n     transmitted continuously on the\
    \ line.\n     Address\n     The address field contains the destination HDLC address.\
    \  A frame\n     is forwarded by a switch based on this field.  It is 16 bits\
    \ wide.\n     The LSB of the first byte indicates the continuation of this field,\n\
    \     and must always be 0. The LSB of the second byte indicates the end\n   \
    \  of this field, and must always be 1.  The MSB of the first byte is\n     used\
    \ to indicate if the frame is a unicast or multicast frame.  The\n     MSB of\
    \ 0 means unicast, with the remaining thirteen bits indicating\n     the destination\
    \ node address including two E/A bits. MSB of 1 means\n     multicast, with the\
    \ remaining thirteen bits indicating the group\n     address.  The address 0xFEFF\
    \ means that the frame is a broadcast\n     frame. The address (0x0001) is reserved\
    \ to identify the control\n     processor inside a switch.  Frames with an invalid\
    \ address should\n     be silently discarded.\n             +-------------+-+-------------+-+\n\

    \ format\n     Protocol\n     The protocol field indicates the protocol to which\
    \ the datagram\n     encapsulated in the information field belongs.  It conforms\
    \ to the\n     ISO 3309 extension mechanism, and the value for this field may\
    \ be\n     obtained from the most recent ``Assigned Numbers'' [9] and ``MAPOS\n\
    \     Version 1 Assigned Numbers'' [10].\n     Information\n     The information\
    \ field contains the datagram for the protocol\n     specified in the protocol\
    \ field.  The length of this field may\n     vary, but shall not exceed 65,280\
    \ (64K - 256) octets.\n     Frame Check Sequence (FCS)\n     By default, the frame\
    \ check sequence (FCS) field is 16-bits long.\n     Optionally, 32 bit FCS may\
    \ be used instead.  The FCS is calculated\n     over all bits of the address,\
    \ protocol, and information fields\n     prior to escape conversions.  The least\
    \ significant octet of the\n     result is transmitted first as it contains the\
    \ coefficient of the\n     highest term.\n     Inter-frame fill\n     A sending\
    \ station must continuously transmit the flag sequence as\n     inter-frame fill\
    \ after the FCS field.  The inter-frame flag\n     sequences must be silently\
    \ discarded by the receiving station.\n     When an under-run occurs during DMA\
    \ in the sending station, it must\n     abort the frame transfer and continuously\
    \ send the flag sequence to\n     indicate the error.\n"
- title: 3.2 Octet-Synchronous Framing
  contents:
  - "3.2 Octet-Synchronous Framing\n   MAPOS 16 uses the same octet stuffing procedure[6]\
    \ as MAPOS version\n   1[5]. Since SONET/SDH provides transparency, Async-Control-\n\
    \   Character-Map (ACCM) is not used.  HDLC frames are mapped into the\n   SONET/SDH\
    \ payload as follows.\n   Each HDLC frame is separated from another frame by one\
    \ or more flag\n   sequence, 01111110 (0x7E).  An escape sequence is defined to\
    \ escape\n   the flag sequence and itself.  Prior to sending the frame, but after\n\
    \   the FCS computation, every occurrence of 01111110 (0x7E) other than\n   the\
    \ flags is to be converted to the sequence 01111101 01011110 (0x7D\n   0x5E),\
    \ and the sequence 01111101 (0x7D) is to be converted to the\n   sequence 01111101\
    \ 01011101 (0x7D 0x5D).  Upon receiving a frame, this\n   conversion must be reversed\
    \ prior to FCS computation.\n"
- title: 4. Influence on MAPOS ARP, UNARP, NSP, and SSP
  contents:
  - "4. Influence on MAPOS ARP, UNARP, NSP, and SSP\n   Since all of the MAPOS protocol\
    \ family, ARP[11], UNARP[11], NSP[7],\n   and SSP[8], use 32-bit address field\
    \ for 8-bit MAPOS address, the\n   16-bit addressing has no influence on them.\
    \  Each protocol only have\n   to place a 16 bit address in the least significant\
    \ place in their 32\n   bit address fields as follows;\n   (1) MAPOS ARP and UNARP\n\
    \    16-bit addresses are placed in the least significant places of the\n    32-bit\
    \ sender and target HDLC addresses.\n   (2) NSP\n    In address assignment packet,\
    \ a 16-bit address is placed in the\n    least significant bytes of the 32-bit\
    \ address field. The rest of the\n    field is padded with zeros.\n   (3) SSP\n\
    \    In route entry of an SSP packet, the 16-bit MAPOS address is placed\n   \
    \ in the least significant bytes of the 32-bit address field.\n"
- title: 5. Mapping IP Multicast Address to MAPOS 16 Address
  contents:
  - "5. Mapping IP Multicast Address to MAPOS 16 Address\n   When transmitting IP\
    \ multicast[11], the thirteen bits of the HDLC\n   address must contain the lowest-order\
    \ thirteen bits of the IP\n   multicast group address.  Exceptions arise when\
    \ these thirteen bits\n   are either all zeros or all ones, in which case the\
    \ address 1111 1110\n   1111 1101 should be used.\n"
