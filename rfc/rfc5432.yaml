- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The offer/answer model for the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\n\
    \   assumes that endpoints somehow establish the Quality of Service (QoS)\n  \
    \ required for the media streams they establish.  Endpoints in closed\n   environments\
    \ typically agree out-of-band (e.g., using configuration\n   information) regarding\
    \ which QoS mechanism to use.  However, on the\n   Internet, there is more than\
    \ one QoS service available.\n   Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism\
    \ to negotiate which QoS\n   mechanism to use for a particular media stream. \
    \ This document\n   defines such a mechanism.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The offer/answer model [RFC3264] for SDP [RFC4566] does\
    \ not provide\n   any mechanism for endpoints to negotiate the QoS mechanism to\
    \ be used\n   for a particular media stream.  Even when QoS preconditions [RFC3312]\n\
    \   are used, the choice of the QoS mechanism is left unspecified and is\n   up\
    \ to the endpoints.\n   Endpoints that support more than one QoS mechanism need\
    \ a way to\n   negotiate which one to use for a particular media stream.  Examples\n\
    \   of QoS mechanisms are RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) [RFC2205]\n   and\
    \ NSIS (Next Steps in Signaling) [QoS-NSLP].\n   This document defines a mechanism\
    \ that allows endpoints to negotiate\n   the QoS mechanism to be used for a particular\
    \ media stream.  However,\n   the fact that endpoints agree on a particular QoS\
    \ mechanism does not\n   imply that that particular mechanism is supported by\
    \ the network.\n   Discovering which QoS mechanisms are supported at the network\
    \ layer\n   is out of the scope of this document.  In any case, the information\n\
    \   the endpoints exchange to negotiate QoS mechanisms, as defined in\n   this\
    \ document, can be useful for a network operator to resolve a\n   subset of the\
    \ QoS interoperability problem -- namely, to ensure that\n   a mechanism commonly\
    \ acceptable to the endpoints is chosen and make\n   it possible to debug potential\
    \ misconfiguration situations.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  SDP Attributes Definition\n   This document defines the 'qos-mech-send' and\
    \ 'qos-mech-recv' session\n   and media-level SDP [RFC4566] attributes.  The following\
    \ is their\n   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax, which is based\
    \ on\n   the SDP [RFC4566] grammar:\n      attribute            =/ qos-mech-send-attr\n\
    \      attribute            =/ qos-mech-recv-attr\n      qos-mech-send-attr  \
    \ = \"qos-mech-send\" \":\"\n                             [[SP] qos-mech *(SP\
    \ qos-mech)]\n      qos-mech-recv-attr   = \"qos-mech-recv\" \":\"\n         \
    \                    [[SP] qos-mech *(SP qos-mech)]\n      qos-mech          \
    \   = \"rsvp\" / \"nsis\" / extension-mech\n      extension-mech       = token\n\
    \   The 'qos-mech' token identifies a QoS mechanism that is supported by\n   the\
    \ entity generating the session description.  A token that appears\n   in a 'qos-mech-send'\
    \ attribute identifies a QoS mechanism that can be\n   used to reserve resources\
    \ for traffic sent by the entity generating\n   the session description.  A token\
    \ that appears in a 'qos-mech-recv'\n   attribute identifies a QoS mechanism that\
    \ can be used to reserve\n   resources for traffic received by the entity generating\
    \ the session\n   description.\n   The 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' attributes\
    \ are not\n   interdependent; one can be used without the other.\n   The following\
    \ is an example of an 'm' line with 'qos-mech-send' and\n   'qos-mech-recv' attributes:\n\
    \      m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0\n      a=qos-mech-send: rsvp nsis\n      a=qos-mech-recv:\
    \ rsvp nsis\n"
- title: 4.  Offer/Answer Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  Offer/Answer Behavior\n   Through the use of the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv'\n\
    \   attributes, an offer/answer exchange allows endpoints to come up with\n  \
    \ a list of common QoS mechanisms sorted by preference.  However, note\n   that\
    \ endpoints negotiate in which direction QoS is needed using other\n   mechanisms,\
    \ such as preconditions [RFC3312].  Endpoints may also use\n   other mechanisms\
    \ to negotiate, if needed, the parameters to use with\n   a given QoS mechanism\
    \ (e.g., bandwidth to be reserved).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Offerer Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Offerer Behavior\n   Offerers include a 'qos-mech-send' attribute with\
    \ the tokens\n   corresponding to the QoS mechanisms (in order of preference)\
    \ that are\n   supported in the send direction.  Similarly, offerers include a\n\
    \   'qos-mech-recv' attribute with the tokens corresponding to the QoS\n   mechanisms\
    \ (in order of preference) that are supported in the receive\n   direction.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Answerer Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Answerer Behavior\n   On receiving an offer with a set of tokens in a 'qos-mech-send'\n\
    \   attribute, the answerer takes those tokens corresponding to QoS\n   mechanisms\
    \ that it supports in the receive direction and includes\n   them, in order of\
    \ preference, in a 'qos-mech-recv' attribute in the\n   answer.  On receiving\
    \ an offer with a set of tokens in a 'qos-mech-\n   recv' attribute, the answerer\
    \ takes those tokens corresponding to QoS\n   mechanisms that it supports in the\
    \ send direction and includes them,\n   in order of preference, in a 'qos-mech-send'\
    \ attribute in the answer.\n   When ordering the tokens in a 'qos-mech-send' or\
    \ a 'qos-mech-recv'\n   attribute by preference, the answerer may take into account\
    \ its own\n   preferences and those expressed in the offer.  However, the exact\n\
    \   algorithm to be used to order such token lists is outside the scope\n   of\
    \ this specification.\n   Note that if the answerer does not have any QoS mechanism\
    \ in common\n   with the offerer, it will return empty 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-\n\
    \   recv' attributes.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Resource Reservation
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Resource Reservation\n   Once the offer/answer exchange completes, both\
    \ offerer and answerer\n   use the token lists in the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv'\n\
    \   attributes of the answer to perform resource reservations.  Offerers\n   and\
    \ answerers SHOULD attempt to use the QoS mechanism with highest\n   priority\
    \ in each direction first.  If an endpoint (the offerer or the\n   answerer) does\
    \ not succeed in using the mechanism with highest\n   priority in a given direction,\
    \ it SHOULD attempt to use the next QoS\n   mechanism in order of priority in\
    \ that direction, and so on.\n   If an endpoint unsuccessfully tries all the common\
    \ QoS mechanisms for\n   a given direction, the endpoint MAY attempt to use additional\
    \ QoS\n   mechanisms not supported by the remote endpoint.  This is because\n\
    \   there may be network entities out of the endpoint's control (e.g., an\n  \
    \ RSVP proxy) that make those mechanisms work.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Subsequent Offer/Answer Exchanges
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Subsequent Offer/Answer Exchanges\n   If, during an established session\
    \ for which the QoS mechanism to be\n   used for a given direction was agreed\
    \ upon using the mechanism\n   defined in this specification, an endpoint receives\
    \ a subsequent\n   offer that does not contain the QoS selection attribute corresponding\n\
    \   to that direction (i.e., the 'qos-mech-send' or 'qos-mech-recv'\n   attribute\
    \ is missing), the endpoints SHOULD continue using the same\n   QoS mechanism\
    \ used up to that moment.\n"
- title: 5.  Example
  contents:
  - "5.  Example\n   The following is an offer/answer exchange between two endpoints\
    \ using\n   the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' attributes.  Parts of the\n\
    \   session descriptions are omitted for clarity purposes.\n   The offerer generates\
    \ the following session description, listing both\n   RSVP and NSIS for both directions.\
    \  The offerer would prefer to use\n   RSVP and, thus, includes it before NSIS.\n\
    \      m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0\n      a=qos-mech-send: rsvp nsis\n      a=qos-mech-recv:\
    \ rsvp nsis\n   The answerer supports NSIS in both directions, but not RSVP.\n\
    \   Consequently, it returns the following session description:\n      m=audio\
    \ 55000 RTP/AVP 0\n      a=qos-mech-send: nsis\n      a=qos-mech-recv: nsis\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove\
    \ 'qos-mech-send' and\n   'qos-mech-recv' attributes from a session description.\
    \  This could\n   result in an application behaving in a non-desirable way.  For\n\
    \   example, the endpoints under attack may not be able to find a common\n   QoS\
    \ mechanism to use.\n   Consequently, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that integrity\
    \ and\n   authenticity protection be applied to SDP session descriptions\n   carrying\
    \ these attributes.  For session descriptions carried in SIP\n   [RFC3261], S/MIME\
    \ [RFC3851] is the natural choice to provide such\n   end-to-end integrity protection,\
    \ as described in [RFC3261].  Other\n   applications MAY use a different form\
    \ of integrity protection.\n"
