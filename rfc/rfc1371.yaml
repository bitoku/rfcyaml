- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   There is a pressing need for a high functionality non-proprietary\n\
    \   \"common\" Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for the TCP/IP protocol\n   family.\
    \  An IGP is the routing protocol used within a single\n   administrative domain\
    \ (commonly referred to as an \"Autonomous System\"\n   (AS).\n   By \"common\"\
    , we simply mean a protocol that is ubiquitously available\n   from all router\
    \ vendors (as in \"in common\").  Users and network\n   operators have expressed\
    \ a strong need for routers from different\n   vendors to have the capablity to\
    \ interoperate within an AS through\n   use of a common IGP.\n   Note:  Routing\
    \ between AS's is handled by a different type of routing\n   protocol, called\
    \ an \"Exterior Gateway Protocol\" (\"an EGP\", of which\n   the Border Gateway\
    \ Protocol [2] and \"The Exterior Gateway Protocol\"\n   [3] are examples.)  The\
    \ issues of routing between AS's using \"an\" EGP\n   is not considered in this\
    \ memo.\n   There are two IGPs in the Internet standards track capable of routing\n\
    \   IP traffic -- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) [4] and Integrated IS-\n   IS\
    \ [5] (based on the OSI IS-IS). These two protocols are both modern\n   \"link\
    \ state\" routing protocols, based on the Dijkstra algorithm.\n   There has been\
    \ substantial interaction and cooperation among the\n   engineers involved in\
    \ each effort, and the protocols share some\n   similar features.\n   However,\
    \ there are a number of technical design differences.  Most\n   noteably, OSPF\
    \ has been designed solely for support of the Internet\n   Protocol (IP), while\
    \ Integrated IS-IS has been designed to support\n   both IP and the OSI Connectionless\
    \ Network Layer Protocol (CLNP)\n   simultaneously.\n"
- title: 2. Multiple Internet Standard Routing Protocols Possible
  contents:
  - "2. Multiple Internet Standard Routing Protocols Possible\n   The Internet architecture\
    \ makes a distinction between \"Interior\n   Gateway Protocols (IGPs)\" and \"\
    Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)\".\n   IGPs are routing protocols used within\
    \ an Autonomous System (AS), and\n   EGPs are routing protocols used between different\
    \ AS's.\n   Therefore, the Internet architecture supports the use and\n   standardization\
    \ of multiple IGP routing protocols.  For example, it\n   is perfectly reasonable\
    \ for one standard routing protocol to be used\n   within one AS; while a second\
    \ standard routing protocol is used\n   within a second AS; at the same time that\
    \ a non-standard proprietary\n   routing protocol is used within a third AS.\n\
    \   The primary purpose for making standards is to allow\n   interoperability.\
    \  Setting a protocol standard in the Internet says,\n   in effect, \"if you wish\
    \ to use this protocol, you should do it as\n   specified in the standard so that\
    \ you can interoperate with others\n   who also wish to use this protocol.\" \
    \ It is important to understand\n   that simply specifying a standard does not,\
    \ by itself, designate a\n   requirement to use the standard.  It is merely meant\
    \ to allow\n   interoperability among those who choose to follow the standard.\n\
    \   Therefore, it is reasonable for both OSPF and Integrated IS-IS to be\n   progressed\
    \ through the Internet Standards process as appropriate\n   (based on the criteria\
    \ specified in [6]).  In addition, it is\n   possible that other IGPs may be developed\
    \ and standardized in the\n   future.\n"
- title: 3. A Common IGP
  contents:
  - "3. A Common IGP\n   Although the Internet architecture allows for multiple standard\
    \ IGP\n   routing protocols, interoperability of router products from different\n\
    \   vendors within a single AS would be greatly facilitated if a single\n   \"\
    common\" IGP were available from all router vendors.  Designating a\n   single\
    \ common IGP would have the goal of enabling multi-vendor router\n   interoperation\
    \ with a modern high functionality routing protocol.\n   However, designating\
    \ a common IGP does not mandate the use of that\n   IGP, nor would it be meant\
    \ to discourage the use of other IGPs in\n   situations where there may be sound\
    \ technical reasons to do so.\n"
- title: 4. Impact of Multi-protocol Topology and Integrated IP/CLNP Routing
  contents:
  - "4. Impact of Multi-protocol Topology and Integrated IP/CLNP Routing\n   There\
    \ are topology considerations which will affect the designation\n   of a \"common\"\
    \ Internet IGP.\n   The Internet requires support for a wide variety of protocol\
    \ suites.\n   If we consider only IP and OSI CLNP, then the Internet is expected\
    \ to\n   contain:\n   1. Pure IP AS's (in which IP is used but OSI CLNP is not\
    \ used);\n   2. Pure CLNP AS's (in which CLNP is used but IP is not used);\n \
    \  3. Dual IP/CLNP ASs, with a common topology (i.e., all links and\n      routers\
    \ in the AS support IP and CLNP, and a single common\n      topology is used for\
    \ both protocol suites);\n   4. Dual, overlapping IP/CLNP ASs with differing topologies\
    \ (i.e.,\n      some links are dual, while some are IP-only and some are\n   \
    \   CLNP-only, resulting in different topologies for IP routing and\n      CLNP\
    \ routing).\n   For (1), (i.e., a pure IP environment) any IGP capable of routing\
    \ IP\n   traffic could be used (e.g., OSPF or Integrated IS-IS).\n   For (2),\
    \ (i.e., a pure CLNP environment) any IGP capable of routing\n   CLNP traffic\
    \ could be used (e.g., OSI IS-IS or Integrated IS-IS).\n   For (3), (i.e., routing\
    \ environments in which both IP and CLNP are\n   present in a common topology)\
    \ there are two possibilities for managing\n   routing:\n   1. Separate routing\
    \ protocols could be used for each supported\n      protocol suite.  For example,\
    \ OSPF may be used for calculating\n      routes for IP traffic and OSI IS-IS\
    \ may be used for calculating\n      routes for OSI traffic.  Or Integrated IS-IS\
    \ could be used for\n      calculating routes for IP traffic and OSI IS-IS could\
    \ be used\n      for calculating routes for CLNP traffic.\n      This approach\
    \ of using separate routing protocols and management\n      for each supported\
    \ protocol family has come to be known as \"Ships\n      in the Night\" because\
    \ the two routing protocols share the\n      hardware/software resources of the\
    \ router without ever actually\n      interacting on a protocol level.\n   2.\
    \ \"Integrated routing\" could be used, in which a single routing\n      protocol\
    \ is used for both IP and CLNP.  At this time, Integrated\n      IS-IS is the\
    \ only choice for \"integrated routing\".\n   For (4), (i.e., routing environments\
    \ in which both IP and CLNP are\n   present but in an overlapping different topology)\
    \ separate routing\n   protocols are required for the IP and CLNP environments\
    \ (i.e., \"Ships\n   in the Night\").  This is equivalent to two separates cases\
    \ of (1) and\n   (2), but it is pointed out here as a separate case for completeness.\n"
- title: 5. Commitment to both IP and CLNP
  contents:
  - "5. Commitment to both IP and CLNP\n   The IAB/IETF are committed to a timely\
    \ introduction of OSI into the\n   Internet.  In recognition of this commitment,\
    \ the IETF has an entire\n   area devoted to OSI integration.\n   However, while\
    \ this introduction is taking place, it is essential\n   that existing services\
    \ based on IP be continued.  Furthermore, IESG\n   also feels that even after\
    \ more widespread introduction of CLNP, IP\n   and CLNP will continue to coexist\
    \ in the Internet for quite some\n   time.  This view is consistent with the IAB\
    \ goal of a multi-protocol\n   Internet.\n   Therefore, the IESG has a strong\
    \ commitment to the continued support\n   for IP throughout the Internet.  Maintenance\
    \ of this IP support\n   requires selection of a common IGP suitable for support\
    \ of IP, and\n   requires that this selection be based on operational experience.\n"
- title: 6. Some History
  contents:
  - "6. Some History\n   In February 1990, the IESG recommended that the question\
    \ of\n   designating a \"common\" IGP be postponed until more information was\n\
    \   available from each protocol.  More than a year has now passed since\n   the\
    \ IESG's recommendation.  There have been significant advancements\n   in specification,\
    \ implementation, and operational experience with\n   each protocol.  It is now\
    \ reasonable to re-open the consideration of\n   designating a \"common IGP\"\
    .\n   At the March 1991 meeting of the IETF, the IETF Routing Area Director\n\
    \   presented a set of criteria for the advancement of routing protocols\n   through\
    \ the Internet standards process [6].  More information\n   regarding the IAB\
    \ Internet Standards process can be found in [1].\n   Also, at the March 1991\
    \ meeting of the IETF, the OSPF Working Group\n   requested that OSPF be considered\
    \ for advancement to Draft Internet\n   Standard.  The OSPF WG submitted four\
    \ documents to the IETF to\n   support its request:\n   o a revised protocol specification\
    \ to update [4];\n   o an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB);\n   o two technical\
    \ reports giving a technical analysis and operational\n     experience with OSPF.\
    \  These reports follow the format recommended\n     in [6].\n   These four documents\
    \ have now been published as [7, 8, 9, 10]\n   respectively.\n   In summary for\
    \ OSPF:\n   o all features of OSPF have tested (although not all features have\n\
    \     been used in operation),\n   o OSPF has been shown to operate well in several\
    \ operational\n     networks containing between 10 and 30 routers,\n   o interoperation\
    \ among routers from multiple vendors has been\n     demonstrated at organized\
    \ \"bakeoffs\".\n   In May 1991, the IAB approved the IETF/IESG recommendation\
    \ to advance\n   OSPF to Draft Internet Standard.\n   Integrated IS-IS, as specified\
    \ in [5], is currently a Proposed\n   Internet Standard.  In July 1991, the status\
    \ of Integrated IS-IS is\n   as follows:\n   o There are several separate implementations\
    \ of integrated\n     IS-IS under development,\n   o Integrated IS-IS has worked\
    \ well in several multi-area operational\n     networks, one containing between\
    \ 20 and 30 routers,\n   o These recent operational results have not yet been\
    \ fully\n     documented.  Documentation, showing satisfaction of the criteria\n\
    \     given in [6] for advancing routing protocols, will be submitted\n     to\
    \ the IESG when Integrated IS-IS is submitted for Draft Internet\n     Standard\
    \ status.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1 Regarding the Common IGP for the IP Internet\n   Based on the available operational\
    \ experience and the pressing need\n   for a high functionality IGP for the IP\
    \ protocol family, the IESG\n   recommends that OSPF be designated as the common\
    \ IGP for the IP\n   portions of the Internet.  To help ensure that this IGP is\
    \ available\n   to all users, the IESG recommends that the IETF Router Requirements\n\
    \   Working Group specify OSPF as \"MUST IMPLEMENT\" in the document\n   \"Requirements\
    \ for Internet IP Routers\".\n"
- title: 7.2 Regarding Integrated Routing
  contents:
  - "7.2 Regarding Integrated Routing\n   As mentioned above, the IESG is commited\
    \ to multiprotocol\n   environments, and expects usage of OSI CLNP to increase\
    \ in the\n   Internet over time.\n   However, at this time, the IESG is not prepared\
    \ to take a position\n   regarding the preference of either \"Ships in the Night\"\
    \ or Integrated\n   routing for such mixed routing environments.  At this time,\
    \ the\n   \"Ships in the Night\" approach is most widely used in the Internet.\n\
    \   Integrated routing has the potential advantage of reducing resource\n   utilization.\
    \  However, additional operational experience is needed\n   before any potential\
    \ advantages can be fully evaluated.\n   Therefore, the IESG wishes to encourage\
    \ implementation of Integrated\n   IS-IS so that a reasonable position can be\
    \ determined based on\n   operational experience.  All implementers of Integrated\
    \ IS-IS are\n   encouraged to coordinate their activity with the IETF IS-IS Working\n\
    \   Group, which is actively collecting information on such experience.\n"
- title: 7.3 Limits of the Recommendation
  contents:
  - "7.3 Limits of the Recommendation\n   It is useful to recognize the limits of\
    \ this recommendation.  This\n   recommendation does not take a position on any\
    \ of the following\n   issues:\n   1. What IGP (if any) users should run inside\
    \ an AS. Users are free to\n      run any IGP they wish inside an AS.\n   2. What\
    \ IGP is technically superior, or has greater operational\n      utility.\n  \
    \ 3. What IGP any vendor should recommend to its users for any specific\n    \
    \  environment.\n   4. What IGP should be used within a CLNP-only environment.\n\
    \   Again, this recommendation is meant to designate one modern high\n   functionality\
    \ IGP that should be implemented by all vendors of\n   routers for the IP portion\
    \ of the Internet.  This will enable routers\n   from vendors who follow this\
    \ recommendation to interoperate within a\n   single IP Autonomous System.\n \
    \  It is not our intent to discourage the use of other routing protocols\n   in\
    \ situations where there may be sound technical reasons to do so.\n   Therefore,\
    \ developers of Internet routers are free to implement, and\n   network operators\
    \ are free to use, other Internet standard routing\n   protocols, or proprietary\
    \ non-Internet-standard routing protocols, as\n   they wish.\n"
