  - "Abstract\n   RFCs 4379 and 6424 created name spaces for Multi-Protocol Label\n\
    \   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  However, those RFCs\n  \
    \ did not create the corresponding IANA registries for Downstream\n   Mapping\

    \ Stack Address Types.\n   There is now a need to make further code point allocations\
    \ from these\n   name spaces.  This document updates RFCs 4379 and 6424 in that\
    \ it\n   creates IANA registries for that purpose.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] created name spaces for MPLS LSP\
    \ Ping.\n   However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries\n\
    \   for DS Flags, Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label\n   Stack\
    \ Address Types.\n   There is now a need to make further code point allocations\
    \ from these\n   name spaces.  In particular, [ENTROPY-LSP-PING] and [LSP-PING-LAG]\n\
    \   request new DS Flags and Multipath Type allocations.\n   This document updates\
    \ [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] in that it creates IANA\n   registries for that purpose.\n\
    \   Note that \"DS Flags\" and \"Multipath Type\" are fields included in two\n\
    \   TLVs defined in the \"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label\n   Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs\" registry: Downstream\n   Mapping (DEPRECATED)\
    \ (value 2) and Downstream Detailed Mapping (value\n   20).  Modification to either\
    \ registry will affect both TLVs.\n"
