- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2585 [RFC2585] defines the MIME media types for public\
    \ key\n   certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  This document\n\
    \   specifies a MIME media type for use with attribute certificates as\n   defined\
    \ in RFC 5755 [RFC5755].\n   Attribute certificates are ASN.1 encoded [X.680].\
    \  RFC 5755 [RFC5755]\n   tells which portions of the attribute certificate must\
    \ use the\n   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [X.690] and which portions are\n\
    \   permitted to use the basic encoding rules (BER) [X.690].  Since DER\n   is\
    \ a proper subset of BER, BER decoding all parts of a properly\n   constructed\
    \ attribute certificate will be successful.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This document registers with IANA the \"application/pkix-attr-cert\"\
    \n   Internet Media Type for use with an attribute certificate as defined\n  \
    \ in [RFC5755].  This registration follows the procedures defined in\n   BCP 13\
    \ [RFC4288].\n      Type name: application\n      Subtype name: pkix-attr-cert\n\
    \      Required parameters: None\n      Optional parameters: None\n      Encoding\
    \ considerations: binary\n      Security considerations:\n        An attribute\
    \ certificate provides authorization information.  An\n        attribute certificate\
    \ is most often used in conjunction with a\n        public key certificate [RFC5280],\
    \ and the two certificates\n        should use the same encoding of the distinguished\
    \ name as\n        described in the Security Considerations of this document.\n\
    \      Interoperability considerations:\n        The media type will be used with\
    \ HTTP to fetch attribute\n        certificates.  Other uses may emerge in the\
    \ future.\n      Published specification: RFC 5755\n      Applications that use\
    \ this media type:\n        The media type is used with a MIME-compliant transport\
    \ to\n        transfer an attribute certificate.  Attribute certificates\n   \
    \     convey authorization information, and they are most often used\n       \
    \ in conjunction with public key certificates as defined in\n        [RFC5280].\n\

  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Attribute certificate issuers must encode the\
    \ holder entity name in\n   exactly the same way as the public key certificate\
    \ distinguished\n   name.  If they are encoded differently, implementations may\
    \ fail to\n   recognize that the attribute certificate and public key certificate\n\
    \   belong to the same entity.\n"
