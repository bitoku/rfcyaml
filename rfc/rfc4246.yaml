  - "Abstract\n   The International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) is a standard\n\
    \   numbering system for the unique and international identification of\n   audiovisual\
    \ works.  This document is the definition of the formal\n   Uniform Resource Name\
    \ (URN) Namespace Identifier (NID) for ISAN.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is the definition of the formal Uniform Resource\
    \ Name\n   (URN) Namespace Identifier (NID) for ISAN.\n"
- title: 2.  URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Namespace Definition Template\n   The following template is provided\
    \ in accordance with [RFC3406].\n   Namespace ID:\n      ISAN\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n      Version: 1\n      Date: 2004 11 22\n   Declared registrant\
    \ of the namespace:\n      Name:    ISAN International Agency\n      Address:\
    \ 26 rue de St Jean, CH-1203 Geneva, Switzerland\n      Contact: Mr. Patrick Attallah,\
    \ Managing Director\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The identifier structure\
    \ is as follows:\n         URN:ISAN:<ISAN-NSS>\n      Where ISAN-NSS is conformant\
    \ to URN syntax requirements defined in\n      [RFC2141] and is further constrained\
    \ by [ISO15706] and in this\n      document.  There are two forms, one with the\
    \ version extension and\n      one without.  The formal BNF is defined in section\
    \ 2 below.\n      Examples of the two forms are:\n         URN:ISAN:0123-1230-3210-2310-1\n\
    \         URN:ISAN:1881-66C7-3420-6541-9-9F3A-0245-U\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \      ISAN, its syntax, uses and its processes are defined in\n      [ISO15706].\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Uniqueness is guaranteed by the\
    \ ISAN International Agency that\n      issues the numbers.  Numbers are not re-assigned.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      Persistence is guaranteed by\
    \ ISO Registration Authority\n      processes and contracts with the ISAN International\
    \ Agency.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      The details of the assignment\
    \ process are defined from time to\n      time by the ISAN International Agency.\
    \  However, in general, any\n      approved entity can request an ISAN number\
    \ by providing the\n      required metadata information and paying the registration\
    \ fee.\n      The ISAN International Agency may delegate to regional or market-\n\
    \      based Registration Agencies for portions of the registration\n      process.\n\
    \   Process for identifier resolution:\n      ISAN numbers are resolved by a direct\
    \ or indirect lookup with the\n      ISAN International Agency.  At this writing,\
    \ a non-commercial,\n      manual system is available online at http://www.isan.org.\
    \  The\n      resolution procedures may be modified from time to time by the\n\
    \      ISAN International Agency.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The\
    \ ISAN-NSS is unique by the nature of the ISAN International\n      Agency's number\
    \ management.  The ISAN-NSS is case-insensitive.\n      Upper and lower case characters\
    \ are treated as identical.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special\
    \ considerations.  The syntax is fully conformant with\n      [RFC2141].\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      The check digits provide syntax integrity.  Lookup is via\
    \ online\n      and offline services provided by the ISAN International Agency.\n\
    \   Scope: Global.\n"
- title: 3.  Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.  Formal Syntax\n   The following syntax specification uses an augmented Backus-Naur\
    \ Form\n   (BNF) and elements defined in the URN Syntax [RFC2141].  This syntax\n\
    \   here is derived from the syntax definition in [ISO15706], constrained\n  \
    \ to prohibit the space character as a separator.\n      <ISAN-NSS>     ::= <root>\
    \ <episode> [version]\n      <root>         ::= 3*(<hexnum> \"-\")\n      <episode>\
    \      ::= <hexnum> \"-\" <check>\n      <version>      ::= 2*(\"-\" <hexnum>)\
    \ \"-\" <check>\n      <hexnum>       ::= 4*(<hex>)\n      <check>        ::=\
    \ <upper> | <lower> | <number>\n   Note that <hex>, <upper>, <lower>, and <number>\
    \ are defined in\n   [RFC2141].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document only defines the syntax and resolution\
    \ authority for\n   the ISAN numbers.  Details of the resolution process and the\
    \ security\n   of the assignment and resolution system processes are defined\n\
    \   external to this document by the ISAN International Agency and thus\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Namespace Considerations\n   ISAN is an external numbering system managed\
    \ by an external agency\n   established by ISO.  While URN namespaces may exist\
    \ for which any\n   generic numbering system can be encoded, there is currently\
    \ no direct\n   encoding for ISAN.  An example of such a namespace is the MPEG-21\n\
    \   system.\n   ISAN numbers are reserved for use in identifying audiovisual works\n\
    \   for which there is a moving visual component, or components related\n   to\
    \ such a work (e.g. subtitling track).\n"
- title: 6. Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Community Considerations\n   The primary registrants for ISAN numbers are\
    \ the producers and\n   studios of audiovisual works (movies and television shows).\
    \  While\n   the system is not constrained to \"major\" works (any bona fide entity\n\
    \   can register any work), the primary benefits of its use come from\n   works\
    \ that are widely distributed.  The users of the ISAN system\n   range from the\
    \ studios themselves to film and video archives and\n   libraries, rights administrators,\
    \ program guide services, and\n   audience measurement services.  Its potential\
    \ for use in the Internet\n   community is as an identifier for streaming media.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a URN NID registration that\
    \ is to be entered\n   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.  It specifically requests\
    \ the\n   NID, \"ISAN\".\n"
