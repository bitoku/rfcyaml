- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In RFC 2533, \"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets\"\
    \ [1], an\n   expression format is presented for describing media feature\n  \
    \ capabilities using simple media feature tags.  This provides a format\n   for\
    \ message handling agents to describe the media feature content of\n   messages\
    \ that they can handle.  That memo also describes an algorithm\n   for finding\
    \ the common capabilities expressed by two different\n   feature expressions.\n\
    \   This memo contains two corrections to that specification:  one fixes\n   an\
    \ error in the formal syntax specification, and the other fixes an\n   error in\
    \ the feature set matching algorithm, in the rules for\n   reducing feature comparison\
    \ predicates.\n   The first of these corrections affects the normative content\
    \ of RFC\n   2533;  the second affects non-normative content.\n"
- title: 1.1 Terminology and document conventions
  contents:
  - "1.1 Terminology and document conventions\n   This specification uses syntax notation\
    \ and conventions described in\n   RFC 2234, \"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications:\
    \ ABNF\" [2].\n       NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential\n\
    \       information about the rationale behind this document.  Such\n       information\
    \ is not needed for building a conformant\n       implementation, but may help\
    \ those who wish to understand the\n       design in greater depth.\n"

- title: 2. Correction to feature expression syntax
  contents:
  - "2. Correction to feature expression syntax\n   In section 4.1, RFC 2533 defines\
    \ the syntax for a \"set\" expression as\n   follows:\n       set        =  attr\
    \ \"=\" \"[\" setentry *( \",\" setentry ) \"]\"\n       setentry   =  value \"\
    /\" range\n   The production for 'setentry' should read:\n       setentry   =\
    \  value / range\n   That is: the '/' character is not a character literal, but\
    \ separates\n   two alternative forms for 'setentry'.  This corrected syntax allows\n\
    \   the set expression examples given in section 4.2.5 of RFC 2533, such\n   as:\n\
    \       ( width=[3,4,6..17/2] )\n"
- title: 3. Correction to feature set matching reduction rules
  contents:
  - "3. Correction to feature set matching reduction rules\n   In section 5.8.2, \"\
    Rules for simplifying unordered values\", RFC 2533\n   lists the following rewriting\
    \ rules for simplifying feature tag\n   comparisons with unordered values:\n \
    \     (LE f a)  (LE f b)      -->  (LE f a),   a=b\n                         \
    \          FALSE,      otherwise\n      (LE f a)  (GE f b)      -->  FALSE,  \
    \    a!=b\n      (LE f a)  (NL f b)      -->  (LE f a)    a!=b\n             \
    \                      FALSE,      otherwise\n      (LE f a)  (NG f b)      -->\
    \  (LE f a),   a!=b\n                                   FALSE,      otherwise\n\
    \   The second of these rules is incomplete, and should read:\n      (LE f a)\
    \  (GE f b)      -->  (LE f a),   a=b\n                                   FALSE,\
    \      otherwise\n        NOTE:  implementation experience with these rules has\n\
    \        suggested a revised feaure set matching algorithm with a\n        more\
    \ useful set of simplification rules.  Apart from the\n        change noted above,\
    \ the algorithm given in RFC 2533 has\n        been implemented and shown to work\
    \ as intended, but the\n        results generated are not always in the most convenient\n\
    \        form.  It is planned to test and publish a revised\n        algorithm\
    \ at a future date.\n"
