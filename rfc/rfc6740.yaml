  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   There has been substantial\
    \ research relating to naming in the\n   Internet through the years [IEN1] [IEN19]\
    \ [IEN23] [IEN31] [IEN135]\n   [RFC814] [RFC1498] [RFC2956].  Much of that research\
    \ has indicated\n   that binding the end-to-end transport-layer session state\
    \ with a\n   specific interface of a node at a specific location is undesirable,\n\
    \   for example, creating avoidable issues for mobility, multihoming, and\n  \
    \ end-to-end security.  More recently, mindful of that important prior\n   work,\
    \ and starting well before the Routing RG was re-chartered to\n   focus on inter-domain\
    \ routing scalability, the authors have been\n   examining enhancements to certain\
    \ naming aspects of the Internet\n   Architecture.  Separately, the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB)\n   recently considered the matter of Internet evolution, including\n\
    \   naming [RFC6250].\n   Our ideas and progress so far are embodied in the ongoing\
    \ definition\n   of an experimental protocol that we call the Identifier-Locator\n\
    \   Network Protocol (ILNP).\n   Links to relevant material are all available\
    \ at:\n      http://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/\n   At the time of writing, the\
    \ main body of peer-reviewed research from\n   which the ideas in this and the\
    \ accompanying documents draw is given\n   in [LABH06], [ABH07a], [ABH07b], [ABH08a],\
    \ [ABH08b], [ABH09a],\n   [ABH09b], [RAB09], [ABH10], [RB10], [BA11], [BAK11],\
    \ and [BA12].\n   In this document, we:\n      a) describe the architectural concepts\
    \ behind ILNP and how various\n         ILNP capabilities operate: this document\
    \ deliberately focuses\n         on describing the key architectural changes that\
    \ ILNP\n         introduces and defers engineering discussion to separate\n  \
    \       documents.\n   Other documents (listed below):\n      b) show how functions\
    \ based on ILNP would be realised on today's\n         Internet by proposing an\
    \ instance of ILNP based on IPv6, which\n         we call ILNPv6 (there is also\
    \ a document describing ILNPv4,\n         which is how ILNP could be applied to\
    \ IPv4).\n      c) discuss salient operational and engineering issues impacting\n\
    \         the deployment of ILNPv6 and the impact on the Internet.\n      d) give\
    \ architectural descriptions of optional advanced\n         capabilities in advanced\
    \ deployments based on the ILNP\n         approach.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document describes the architecture for the Identifier-Locator\n\
    \   Network Protocol (ILNP) including concept of operations.  The authors\n  \
    \ recommend reading and understanding this document as the starting\n   point\
    \ to understanding ILNP.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than one engineering\n\
    \   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\n   engineering\
    \ design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents, we describe\
    \ two specific engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\" refers precisely\
    \ to an instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and backwards compatible with,\
    \ IPv6.  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n   refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that\
    \ is based upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many engineering\
    \ aspects common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].  A\
    \ full engineering specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond the\
    \ scope of this document.\n   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents\
    \ for details not\n   described here:\n   a) [RFC6741] describes engineering and\
    \ implementation considerations\n      that are common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n\
    \   b) [RFC6742] defines additional DNS resource records that support\n      ILNP.\n\
    \   c) [RFC6743] defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update message used by an\n    \
    \  ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set\
    \ of valid Locators.\n   d) [RFC6744] defines a new IPv6 Nonce Destination Option\
    \ used by\n      ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate to ILNP correspondent nodes (by\n\
    \      inclusion within the initial packets of an ILNP session) that the\n   \
    \   node is operating in the ILNP mode and (2) to prevent off-path\n      attacks\
    \ against ILNP ICMP messages.  This Nonce is used, for\n      example, with all\
    \ ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update messages that are\n      exchanged among ILNP correspondent\
    \ nodes.\n   e) [RFC6745] defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message used by\
    \ an\n      ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n\
    \      set of valid Locators.\n   f) [RFC6746] defines a new IPv4 Nonce Option\
    \ used by ILNPv4 nodes to\n      carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks\
    \ against ILNP\n      ICMP messages and also defines a new IPv4 Identifier Option\
    \ used\n      by ILNPv4 nodes.\n   g) [RFC6747] describes extensions to the Address\
    \ Resolution Protocol\n      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n   h) [RFC6748] describes\
    \ optional engineering and deployment functions\n      for ILNP.  These are not\
    \ required for the operation or use of ILNP\n      and are provided as additional\
    \ options.\n"
- title: 1.2.  History
  contents:
  - "1.2.  History\n   In 1977, Internet researchers at University College London\
    \ wrote the\n   first Internet Experiment Note (IEN), which discussed issues with\
    \ the\n   interconnection of networks [IEN1].  This identified the inclusion of\n\
    \   network-layer addresses in the transport-layer session state (e.g.,\n   TCP\
    \ checksum) as a significant problem for mobile and multihomed\n   nodes and networks.\
    \  It also proposed separation of identity from\n   location as a better approach\
    \ to take when designing the TCP/IP\n   protocol suite.  Unfortunately, that separation\
    \ did not occur, so the\n   deployed IPv4 and IPv6 Internet entangles upper-layer\
    \ protocols\n   (e.g., TCP, UDP) with network-layer routing and topology information\n\
    \   (e.g., IP Addresses) [IEN1] [RFC768] [RFC793].\n   The architectural concept\
    \ behind ILNP derives from a June 1994 note\n   by Bob Smart to the IETF SIPP\
    \ WG mailing list [SIPP94].  In January\n   1995, Dave Clark sent a similar note\
    \ to the IETF IPng WG mailing\n   list, suggesting that the IPv6 address be split\
    \ into separate\n   Identifier and Locator fields [IPng95].\n   Afterwards, Mike\
    \ O'Dell pursued this concept in Internet-Drafts\n   describing \"8+8\" [8+8]\
    \ and \"GSE\" (Global, Site, and End-system)\n   [GSE].  More recently, the IRTF\
    \ Namespace Research Group (NSRG)\n   studied this matter around the turn of the\
    \ century.  Unusually for an\n   IRTF RG, the NSRG operated on the principle that\
    \ unanimity was\n   required for the NSRG to make a recommendation.  Atkinson\
    \ was a\n   member of the IRTF NSRG.  At least one other protocol, the Host\n\
    \   Identity Protocol (HIP), also derives in part from the IRTF NSRG\n   studies\
    \ (and related antecedent work).  This current proposal differs\n   from O'Dell's\
    \ work in various ways, notably in that it does not\n   require deployment or\
    \ use of Locator rewriting.\n   The key idea proposed for ILNP is to directly\
    \ and specifically change\n   the overloaded semantics of the IP Address.  The\
    \ Internet community\n   has indicated explicitly, several times, that this use\
    \ of overloaded\n   semantics is a significant problem with the use of the Internet\n\
    \   protocol today [RFC1498] [RFC2101] [RFC2956] [RFC4984].\n   While the research\
    \ community has made a number of proposals that\n   could provide solutions, so\
    \ far there has been little progress on\n   changing the status quo.\n"

- title: 2.  Architectural Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Architectural Overview\n   ILNP takes a different approach to naming of communication\
    \ objects\n   within the network stack.  Two new data types are introduced which\n\
    \   subsume the role of the IP Address at the network and transport\n   layers\
    \ in the current IP architecture.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Identifiers and Locators
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Identifiers and Locators\n   ILNP explicitly replaces the use of IP Addresses\
    \ with two distinct\n   name spaces, each having distinct and different semantics:\n\
    \      a) Identifier: a non-topological name for uniquely identifying a\n    \
    \     node.\n      b) Locator: a topologically bound name for an IP subnetwork.\n\
    \   The use of these two new namespaces in comparison to IP is given in\n   Table\
    \ 1.  The table shows where existing names are used for state\n   information\
    \ in end-systems or protocols.\n           Layer     |          IP          |\
    \     ILNP\n      ---------------+----------------------+---------------\n   \
    \     Application  |  FQDN or IP Address  |  FQDN\n        Transport    |  IP\
    \ Address          |  Identifier\n        Network      |  IP Address         \
    \ |  Locator\n        Physical i/f |  IP Address          |  MAC address\n   \
    \   ---------------+----------------------+---------------\n      FQDN = Fully\
    \ Qualified Domain Name\n      i/f = interface\n      MAC = Media Access Control\n\
    \      Table 1: Use of Names for State Information in Various\n              Communication\
    \ Layers for IP and ILNP\n   As shown in Table 1, if an application uses a Fully\
    \ Qualified Domain\n   Name at the application-layer, rather than an IP Address\
    \ or other\n   lower-layer identifier, then the application perceives no\n   architectural\
    \ difference between IP and ILNP.  We call such\n   applications \"well-behaved\"\
    \ with respect to naming as use of the FQDN\n   at the application-layer is recommended\
    \ in [RFC1958].  Some other\n   applications also avoid use of IP Address information\
    \ within the\n   application-layer protocol; we also consider these applications\
    \ to be\n   \"well-behaved\".  Any well-behaved application should be able to\n\
    \   operate on ILNP without any changes.  Note that application-level use\n  \
    \ of IP Addresses includes application-level configuration information,\n   e.g.,\
    \ Apache web server (httpd) configuration files make extensive\n   use of IP Addresses\
    \ as a form of identity.\n   ILNP does not require applications to be rewritten\
    \ to use a new\n   Networking Application Programming Interface (API).  So existing\n\
    \   well-behaved IP-based applications should be able to work over ILNP\n   as\
    \ is.\n   In ILNP, transport-layer protocols use only an end-to-end, non-\n  \
    \ topological node Identifier in any transport-layer session state.  It\n   is\
    \ important to note that the node Identifier names the node, not a\n   specific\
    \ interface of the node.  In this way, it has different\n   semantics and properties\
    \ than either the IPv4 address, the IPv6\n   address, or the IPv6 interface identifier\
    \ [RFC791] [RFC4291].\n   The use of the ILNP Identifier value within application-layer\n\
    \   protocols is not recommended.  Instead, the use of either a FQDN or\n   some\
    \ different topology-independent namespace is recommended.\n   At the network-layer,\
    \ Locator values, which have topological\n   significance, are used for routing\
    \ and forwarding of ILNP packets,\n   but Locators are not used in upper-layer\
    \ protocols.\n   As well as the new namespaces, another significant difference\
    \ in\n   ILNP, as shown in Table 1, is that there is no binding of a routable\n\
    \   name to an interface, or Sub-Network Point of Attachment (SNPA), as\n   there\
    \ is in IP.  The existence of such a binding in IP effectively\n   binds transport\
    \ protocol flows to a specific, single interface on a\n   node.  Also, applications\
    \ that include IP Addresses in their\n   application-layer session state effectively\
    \ bind to a specific,\n   single interface on a node [RFC2460] [RFC6724].\n  \
    \ In ILNP, dynamic bindings exist between Identifier values and\n   associated\
    \ Locator values, as well as between {Identifier, Locator}\n   pairs and (physical\
    \ or logical) interfaces on the node.\n   This change enhances the Internet Architecture\
    \ by adding crisp and\n   clear semantics for the Identifier and for the Locator,\
    \ removing the\n   overloaded semantics of the IP Address [RFC1992] [RFC4984],\
    \ by\n   updating end-system protocols, but without requiring any router or\n\
    \   backbone changes.  In ILNP, the closest approximation to an IP\n   Address\
    \ is an I-L Vector (I-LV), which is a given binding between an\n   Identifier\
    \ and Locator pair, written as [I, L].  I-LVs are discussed\n   in more detail\
    \ below.\n   Where, today, IP packets have:\n   - Source IP Address, Destination\
    \ IP Address\n   instead, ILNP packets have:\n   - source I-LV, destination I-LV\n\
    \   However, it must be emphasised that the I-LV and the IP Address are\n   *not*\
    \ equivalent.\n   With these naming enhancements, we will improve the Internet\n\
    \   Architecture by adding explicit harmonised support for many\n   functions,\
    \ such as multihoming, mobility, and IPsec.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Deprecating IP Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Deprecating IP Addresses\n   ILNP places an explicit Locator and Identifier\
    \ in the IP packet\n   header, replacing the usual IP Address.  Locators are tied\
    \ to the\n   topology of the network.  They may change frequently, as the node\
    \ or\n   site changes its network connectivity.  The node Identifier is\n   normally\
    \ much more static and remains constant throughout the life of\n   a given transport-layer\
    \ session, and frequently much longer.\n   However, there are various options\
    \ for Identifier values, as\n   discussed in [RFC6741].  The way that I-LVs are\
    \ encoded into packet\n   headers is different for IPv4 and IPv6, as explained\
    \ in [RFC6741].\n   Identifiers and Locators for hosts are advertised explicitly\
    \ in DNS,\n   through the use of new Resource Records (RRs).  This is a logical\
    \ and\n   reasonable use of DNS, completely analogous to the capability that\n\
    \   DNS provides today.  At present, among other current uses, the DNS is\n  \
    \ used to map from an FQDN to a set of addresses.  As ILNP replaces IP\n   Addresses\
    \ with Identifiers and Locators, it is then clearly rational\n   to use the DNS\
    \ to map an FQDN to a set of Identifiers and a set of\n   Locators for a node.\n\
    \   The presence of ILNP Locators and Identifiers in the DNS for a DNS\n   owner\
    \ name is an indicator to correspondents that the correspondents\n   can try to\
    \ establish an ILNP-based transport-layer session with that\n   DNS owner name.\n\
    \   Specifically in response to [RFC4984], ILNP improves routing\n   scalability\
    \ by helping multihomed sites operate effectively with\n   Provider Aggregated\
    \ (PA) address prefixes.  Many multihomed sites\n   today request provider-independent\
    \ (PI) address prefixes so they can\n   provide session survivability despite\
    \ the failure of one or more\n   access links or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\
    \  ILNP provides\n   this transport-layer session survivability by having a provider-\n\
    \   independent Node Identifier (NID) value that is free of any\n   topological\
    \ semantics.  This NID value can be bound dynamically to a\n   Provider Aggregated\
    \ Locator (L) value, the latter being a topological\n   name, i.e., a PA network\
    \ prefix.  By allowing correspondents to\n   change arbitrarily among multiple\
    \ PA Locator values, survivability is\n   enabled as changes to the L values need\
    \ not disrupt transport-layer\n   sessions.  In turn, this allows an ILNP multihomed\
    \ site to have both\n   the full transport-layer and full network-layer session\
    \ resilience\n   that is today offered by PI addressing while using the equivalent\
    \ of\n   PA addressing.  In turn, this eliminates the current need to use\n  \
    \ globally visible PI routing prefixes for each multihomed site.\n"

    \ session\" and\n   \"transport-layer session\" both for IP-based networks and\
    \ ILNP-based\n   networks.\n   Today, network-layer IP sessions have 2 components:\n\
    \   - Source IP Address (A_S)\n   - Destination IP Address (A_D)\n   For example,\
    \ a tuple for an IP layer session would be:\n      <IP: A_S, A_D>\n   Instead,\

    \   - Source Identifier(s) (I_S)\n   - Destination Locator(s) (L_D)\n   - Destination\
    \ Identifier(s) (L_S)\n   and a tuple for an ILNP session would be:\n      <ILNP:\
    \ I_S, L_S, I_D, L_D>\n   The phrase \"ILNP session\" refers to an ILNP-based\
    \ network-layer\n   session, having the 4 components in the definition above.\n\
    \   For engineering efficiency, multiple transport-layer sessions between\n  \
    \ a pair of ILNP correspondents normally share a single ILNP session\n   (I-LV\
    \ pairs and associated Nonce values).  Also, for engineering\n   convenience (and\
    \ to cope with situation where different nodes, at\n   different locations, might\
    \ use the same I values), in the specific\n   implementation of ILNPv6 and ILNPv4,\
    \ we define the use of nonce\n   values:\n   - Source-to-destination Nonce value\
    \ (N_S)\n   - Destination-to-source Nonce value (N_D)\n   These are explained\
    \ in more detail in [RFC6741], with [RFC6744] for\n   ILNPv6 and [RFC6746] for\
    \ ILNPv4.\n   Today, transport-layer sessions using IP include these 5 components:\n\
    \    - Source IP Address (A_S)\n    - Destination IP Address (A_D)\n    - Transport-layer\
    \ protocol (e.g., UDP, TCP, SCTP)\n    - Source transport-layer port number (P_S)\n\
    \    - Destination transport-layer port number (P_D)\n   For example, a TCP tuple\
    \ would be:\n      <TCP: P_S, P_D, A_S, A_D>\n   Instead, transport-layer sessions\

    \ a virtual node.  For example, a single physical device might\n   contain multiple\
    \ independent virtual nodes.  Alternately, a single\n   virtual device might be\
    \ composed from multiple physical devices.  In\n   the case of a Multi-Level Secure\
    \ (MLS) system [DIA] [DoD85] [DoD87]\n   [RFC5570], each valid Sensitivity Label\
    \ of that system might be a\n   separate virtual node.\n   A node MAY have multiple\
    \ Identifier values associated with it, which\n   MAY be used concurrently.\n\
    \   In normal operation, when a node is responding to a received ILNP\n   packet\
    \ that creates a new network-layer session, the correct NID\n   value to use for\

    \ the\n   application-layer naming, through DNS name resolution, or through\n\
    \   some alternative name resolution system.  Another option is an\n   application\
    \ may be able to select different I values directly -- as\n   Identifiers are\
    \ visible above the network layer via the transport\n   protocol.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Node Identifiers Are Immutable during a Session\n   Once a Node Identifier\
    \ (NID) value has been used to establish a\n   transport-layer session, that Node\
    \ Identifier value forms part of the\n   end-to-end (invariant) transport-layer\
    \ session state and so MUST\n   remain fixed for the duration of that session.\
    \  This means, for\n   example, that throughout the duration of a given TCP session,\
    \ the\n   Source Node Identifier and Destination Node Identifier values will\n\
    \   not change.\n   In normal operation, a node will not change its set of valid\n\
    \   Identifier values frequently.  However, a node MAY change its set of\n   valid\
    \ Identifier values over time, for example, in an effort to\n   provide identity\
    \ obfuscation, while remaining subject to the\n   architectural rule of the preceding\
    \ paragraph.  When a node has more\n   than one Node Identifier value concurrently,\

    \ compatibility.  There is no semantic equivalent to an ILNP\n   Identifier in\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6 today.\n   The Modified EUI-64 syntax used by both ILNP Identifiers\
    \ and IPv6\n   interface identifiers contains a bit indicating whether the value\
    \ has\n   global scope or local scope [IEEE-EUI] [RFC4291].  ILNP Identifiers\n\
    \   have either global scope or local scope.  If they have global scope,\n   they\
    \ SHOULD be globally unique.\n   Regardless of whether an Identifier is global\
    \ scope or local scope,\n   an Identifier MUST be unique within the scope of a\
    \ given Locator\n   value to which it is bound for a given ILNP session or packet\
    \ flow.\n   As an example, with ILNPv6, the ordinary IPv6 Neighbour Discovery\n\
    \   (ND) processes ensure that this is true, just as ND ensures that no\n   two\

    \ same time.\n   Both the IEEE EUI-64 specification and the Modified EUI-64 syntax\n\

- title: 3.2.  Locators
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Locators\n   Locators are topologically significant names, analogous to\n\
    \   (sub)network routing prefixes.  The Locator names the IP subnetwork\n   that\
    \ a node is connected to.  ILNP neither prohibits nor mandates in-\n   transit\
    \ modification of Locator values.\n   A host MAY have several Locators at the\
    \ same time, for example, if it\n   has a single network interface connected to\
    \ multiple subnetworks\n   (e.g., VLAN deployments on wired Ethernet) or has multiple\
    \ interfaces\n   each on a different subnetwork.  Locator values normally have\
    \ Locator\n   Preference Indicator (LPI) values associated with them.  These LPIs\n\
    \   indicate that a specific Locator value has higher or lower preference\n  \
    \ for use at a given time.  Local LPI values may be changed through\n   local\
    \ policy or via management interfaces.  Remote LPI values are\n   normally learned\
    \ from the DNS, but the local copy of a remote LPI\n   value might be modified\
    \ by local policy relating to preferred paths\n   or prefixes.\n   Locator values\
    \ are used only at the network layer.  Locators are not\n   used in end-to-end\
    \ transport state.  For example, Locators are not\n   used in transport-layer\
    \ session state or application-layer session\n   state.  However, this does not\
    \ preclude an end-system setting up\n   local dynamic bindings for a single transport\
    \ flow to multiple\n   Locator values concurrently.\n   The routing system only\
    \ uses Locators, not Identifiers.  For unicast\n   traffic, ILNP uses longest-prefix\
    \ match routing, just as the IP\n   Internet does.\n   Section 4 below describes\
    \ in more detail how Locators are used in\n   forwarding and routing packets from\
    \ a sending node on a source\n   subnetwork to one or more receiving nodes on\
    \ one or more destination\n   subnetworks.\n   A difference from earlier proposals\
    \ [GSE] [8+8] is that, in normal\n   operation, the originating host supplies\
    \ both Source Locator and\n   Destination Locator values in the packets it sends\
    \ out.\n   Section 4.3 describes packet forwarding in more detail, while Section\n\
    \   4.4 describes packet routing in more detail.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Locator Values Are Dynamic\n   The ILNP architecture recognises that\
    \ Locator values are\n   topologically significant, so the set of Locator values\
    \ associated\n   with a node normally will need to change when the node's connectivity\n\
    \   to the Internet topology changes.  For example, a mobile or\n   multihomed\
    \ node is likely to have connectivity changes from time to\n   time, along with\
    \ the corresponding changes to the set of Locator\n   values.\n   When a node\
    \ using a specific set of Locator values changes one or\n   more of those Locator\
    \ values, then the node (1) needs to update its\n   local knowledge of its own\
    \ Locator values, (2) needs to inform all\n   active Correspondent Nodes (CNs)\
    \ of those changes to its set of\n   Locator values so that ILNP session continuity\

    \ To\n   enable this, a node that sees its Locator values have changed MUST\n\

  contents:
  - "3.3.  IP Address and Identifier-Locator Vector (I-LV)\n   Historically, an IP\
    \ Address has been considered to be an atomic\n   datum, even though it is recognised\
    \ that an IP Address has an\n   internal structure: the network prefix plus either\
    \ the host ID (IPv4)\n   or the interface identifier (IPv6).  However, this internal\
    \ structure\n   has not been used in end-system protocols; instead, all the bits\
    \ of\n   the IP Address are used.  (Additionally, in IPv4 the IPv4 subnet mask\n\
    \   uses bits from the host ID, a further confusion of the structure,\n   even\
    \ thought it is an extremely useful engineering mechanism.)\n   In ILNP, the IP\
    \ Address is replaced by an \"Identifier-Locator Vector\"\n   (I-LV).  This consists\
    \ of a pairing of an Identifier value and a\n   Locator value for that packet,\
    \ written as [I, L].  All ILNP packets\n   have Source Identifier, Source Locator,\
    \ Destination Identifier, and\n   Destination Locator values.  The I value of\
    \ the I-LV is used by\n   upper-layer protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, SCTP), so needs\
    \ to be\n   immutable.  Locators are not used by upper-layer protocols (e.g.,\n\
    \   TCP, UDP, SCTP).  Instead, Locators are similar to IP routing\n   prefixes,\
    \ and are only used to name a specific subnetwork.\n   While it is possible to\
    \ say that an I-LV is an approximation to an IP\n   Address of today, it should\
    \ be understood that an I-LV:\n      a) is not an atomic datum, being a pairing\
    \ of two data types, an\n         Identifier and a Locator.\n      b) has different\
    \ semantics and properties to an IP Address, as is\n         described in this\
    \ document.\n   In our discussion, it will be convenient sometimes to refer to\
    \ an\n   I-LV, but sometimes to refer only to an Identifier value, or only to\n\
    \   a Locator value.\n   ILNP packets always contain a source I-LV and a destination\
    \ I-LV.\n"

    \ will\n   consider the differences in end-systems' state between IP and ILNP\
    \ in\n   order to highlight the architectural changes.\n   We define a formal\
    \ notation to represent the data contained in the\n   transport-layer session\
    \ state.  We define:\n      A = IP Address\n      I = Identifier\n      L = Locator\n\
    \      P = Transport-layer port number\n   To differentiate the local and remote\
    \ values for the above items, we\n   also use suffixes, for example:\n      _L\
    \ = local\n      _R = remote\n   With IPv4 and IPv6 today, the invariant state\
    \ at the transport-layer\n   for TCP can be represented by the tagged tuple:\n\

    \        UDP  User Datagram Protocol\n   So, for example, with IP, a UDP packet\
    \ would have the tagged tuple:\n      <UDP: A_L, A_R, P_L, P_R>              \
    \                 --- (2)\n   A TCP segment carried in an IP packet may be represented\
    \ by the\n   tagged tuple binding:\n      <TCP: A_L, A_R, P_L, P_R><IP: A_L, A_R>\
    \                 --- (3)\n   and a UDP packet would have the tagged tuple binding:\n\
    \      <UDP: A_L, A_R, P_L, P_R><IP: A_L, A_R>                 --- (4)\n   In\
    \ ILNP, the transport-layer state for TCP is:\n      <TCP: I_L, I_R, P_L, P_R>\
    \                               --- (5)\n   The binding for a TCP segment within\

    \    --- (6)\n   When comparing tuple expressions (3) and (6), we see that for\
    \ IP, any\n   change to network addresses impacts the end-to-end state, but for\n\
    \   ILNP, changes to Locator values do not impact end-to-end state.  This\n  \
    \ provides end-system session state invariance, a key feature of ILNP\n   compared\
    \ to IP as it is used in some situations today.  ILNP adopts\n   the end-to-end\
    \ approach for its architecture [SRC84].  As noted\n   previously, nodes MAY have\
    \ more than one Locator concurrently, and\n   nodes MAY change their set of active\
    \ Locator values as required.\n   While these documents do not include SCTP examples,\
    \ the same notation\n   can be used, simply substituting the string \"SCTP\" for\

    \ order to\n   illustrate the intent and show the feasibility of the approach.\n\

- title: 4.1.  Basic Local Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Basic Local Configuration\n   This section uses the term \"address management\"\
    , in recognition of\n   the analogy with capabilities present in IP today.  In\
    \ this document,\n   address management is about enabling hosts to attach to a\
    \ subnetwork\n   and enabling network-layer communication between and among hosts,\n\
    \   also including:\n      a) enabling identification of a node within a site.\n\
    \      b) allowing basic routing/forwarding from a node acting as an end-\n  \
    \       system.\n   If we consider Figure 4.1, imagine that host H has been connected\
    \ to\n   the site network.  Administratively, it needs at least one I value\n\
    \   and one L value in order to be able to communicate.\n   Today, local administrative\
    \ procedures allocate IP Addresses, often\n   using various protocol mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., NETCONF-based router\n   configuration, DHCP for IPv4, DHCP for IPv6,\
    \ IPv6 Router\n   Advertisements).  Similarly, local administrative procedures\
    \ can\n   allocate I and L values as required, e.g., I_H and L_H.  This may be\n\
    \   through manual configuration.\n   Additionally, if it is expected or desired\
    \ that H might have incoming\n   communication requests, e.g., it is a server,\
    \ then the values I_H and\n   L_H can be added to the relevant name services (e.g.,\
    \ DNS, NIS/YP),\n   so that FQDN lookups for H resolve to the appropriate DNS\
    \ resource\n   records (e.g., NID, L32, L64, and LP [RFC6742]) for node H.\n \
    \  From a network operations perspective, this whole process also can be\n   automated.\
    \  As an example, consider that in Figure 3.1 the Site\n   Border Router (SBR)\
    \ is an IPv6-capable router and is connected via\n   link1 to an ISP that supports\
    \ IPv6.  The SBR will have been allocated\n   one (or more) IPv6 prefixes that\
    \ it will multicast using IPv6 Routing\n   Advertisements (RAs) into the site\
    \ network, e.g., prefix L_1.  L_1 is\n   actually a local IPv6 prefix (/64), which\
    \ is formed from an address\n   assignment by the upstream ISP, according to [RFC3177]\
    \ or [RFC6177].\n   Host H will see these RAs, for example, on its local interface\
    \ with\n   name eth0, will be able to use that prefix as a Locator value, and\n\
    \   will cache that Locator value locally.\n   Also, node H can use the mechanism\
    \ documented in either Section 2.5.1\n   of [RFC4291], in [RFC3972], [RFC4581],\
    \ [RFC4982], or in [RFC4941] in\n   order to create a default I value (say, I_H),\
    \ just as an IPv6 host\n   can.  For DNS, the I_H and L_1 values may be pre-configured\
    \ in DNS by\n   an administrator who already has knowledge of these, or added\
    \ to DNS\n   by H using Secure DNS Dynamic Update [RFC3007] to add or update the\n\
    \   correct NID and L64 records to DNS for the FQDN for H.\n"

  - "4.2.  I-L Communication Cache\n   For the purposes of explaining the concept\
    \ of operations, we talk of\n   a local I-L Communication Cache (ILCC).  This\
    \ is an engineering\n   convenience and does not form part of the ILNP architecture,\
    \ but is\n   used in our examples.  More details on the ILCC can be found in\n\
    \   [RFC6741].  The ILCC contains information that is required for the\n   operation\
    \ of ILNP.  This will include, amongst other things, the\n   current set of valid\
    \ Identifier and Locator values in use by a node,\n   the bindings between them,\
    \ and the bindings between Locator values\n   and interfaces.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Packet Forwarding
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Packet Forwarding\n   When the SBR needs to send a packet to H, it uses\
    \ local address\n   resolution mechanisms to discover the bindings between interface\n\
    \   addresses and currently active I-LVs for H.  For our example of\n   Figure\
    \ 3.1, IPv6 Neighbour Discovery (ND) can be used without\n   modification, as\
    \ the I-LV for ILNPv6 occupies the same bits as the\n   IPv6 address in the IPv6\
    \ header.  For packets from H to SBR, the same\n   basic mechanism applies, as\
    \ long as SBR supports IPv6 and even if it\n   is not ILNPv6-capable, as IPv6\
    \ ND is used unmodified for ILNPv6.\n   For Figure 3.1, assuming:\n   - SBR advertises\
    \ prefix L_1 locally, uses I value I_S, and has an\n     Ethernet MAC address\
    \ M_S on interface with local name sbr0\n   - H uses I value I_H, and has an Ethernet\
    \ MAC address of M_H on the\n     interface with local name eth0\n   then H will\
    \ have in its ILCC:\n      [I_H, L_1]                                        \
    \ --- (7a)\n      L_1, eth0                                          --- (7b)\n\
    \   After the IPv6 RA and ND mechanism has executed, the ILCC at H would\n   contain,\
    \ as well as expressions (7a) and (7b), the following entry\n   for SBR:\n   \
    \   [I_S, L_1], M_S                                    --- (8)\n   For ILNPv6,\
    \ it does not matter that the SBR is not ILNPv6-capable, as\n   the I-LV [I_S,\
    \ L_1] is physically equivalent to the IPv6 address for\n   the internal interface\
    \ sbr0.\n   At SBR, which is not ILNP-capable, there would be the following\n\
    \   entries in its local cache and configuration:\n      L_1:I_S             \
    \                              --- (9a)\n      L_1, sbr0                     \
    \                    --- (9b)\n   Expression (9a) represents a valid IPv6 ND entry:\
    \ in this case, the\n   I_S value (which is 64 bits in ILNPv6) and the L_1 values\
    \ are,\n   effectively, concatenated and treated as if they were a single IPv6\n\
    \   address.  Expression (9b) binds transmissions for L_1 to interface\n   sbr0.\
    \  (Again, sbr0 is a local, implementation-specific name, and\n   such a binding\
    \ is possible with standard tools today, for example,\n   ifconfig(8).)\n"
- title: 4.4.  Packet Routing
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Packet Routing\n   If we assume that host H is configured as in the previous\
    \ section, it\n   is now ready to send and receive ILNP packets.\n   Let us assume\
    \ that, for Figure 4.1, it wishes to contact the node CN,\n   which has FQDN cn.example.com\
    \ and is ILNP-capable.  A DNS query by H\n   for cn.example.com will result in\
    \ NID and L64 records for CN, with\n   values I_CN and L_CN, respectively, being\
    \ returned to H and stored in\n   its ILCC:\n      [I_CN, L_CN]              \
    \                       --- (10)\n   This will be considered active as long as\
    \ the TTL values for the DNS\n   records are valid.  If the TTL for an I or L\
    \ value is zero, then the\n   value is still usable but becomes stale as soon\
    \ as it has been used\n   once.  However, it is more likely that the TTL value\
    \ will be greater\n   than zero [BA11] [SBK01].\n   Once the CN's I value is known,\
    \ the upper-layer protocol, e.g., the\n   transport protocol, can set up suitable\
    \ transport-layer session\n   state:\n      <UDP: I_H, I_CN, P_H, P_CN>      \
    \               --- (11)\n   For routing of ILNP packets, the destination L value\
    \ in an ILNPv6\n   packet header is semantically equivalent to a routing prefix.\
    \  So,\n   once a packet has been forwarded from a host to its first-hop router,\n\
    \   only the destination L value needs to be used for getting the packet\n   to\
    \ the destination network.  Once the packet has arrived at the\n   router for\
    \ the site network, local mechanisms and the packet-\n   forwarding mechanism,\
    \ as described above in Section 4.3, allow the\n   packet to be delivered to the\
    \ host.\n   For our example of Figure 4.1, H will send a UDP packet over ILNP\
    \ as:\n      <UDP: I_H, I_CN, P_H, P_CN><ILNP: L_1, L_CN>     --- (12a)\n   and\
    \ CN will send UDP packets to H as:\n      <UDP: I_CN, I_H, P_CN, P_H><ILNP: L_CN,\
    \ L_1>     --- (12b)\n   The I value for H used in the transport-layer state (I_H\
    \ in\n   expression (12a)) selects the correct L value (L_1 in this case) from\n\
    \   the bindings in the ILCC (expression (7a)), and that, in turn,\n   selects\
    \ the correct interface from the ILCC (expression (7b)), as\n   described in Section\
    \ 4.2.  This gets the packet to the first hop\n   router; beyond that, the ILNPv6\
    \ packet is treated as if it were an\n   IPv6 packet.\n"
- title: 5.  Multihoming and Multi-Path Transport
  contents:
  - "5.  Multihoming and Multi-Path Transport\n   For multihoming, there are three\
    \ cases to consider:\n      a) Host Multihoming (H-MH): a single host is, individually,\n\
    \         connected to multiple upstream links, via separate routing\n       \
    \  paths, and those multiple paths are used by that host as it\n         wishes.\
    \  That is, use of multiple upstream links is managed by\n         the single\
    \ host itself.  For example, the host might have\n         multiple valid Locator\
    \ values on a single interface, with each\n         Locator value being associated\
    \ with a different upstream link\n         (provider).\n      b) Multi-Path Transport\
    \ (MTP): This is similar to using ILNP's\n         support for host multihoming\
    \ (i.e., H-MH), so we describe\n         multi-path transport here.  (Indeed,\
    \ for ILNP, this can be\n         considered a special case of H-MH.)\n      c)\
    \ Site Multihoming (S-MH): a site network is connected to\n         multiple upstream\
    \ links via separate routing paths, and hosts\n         on the site are not necessarily\
    \ aware of the multiple upstream\n         paths.  That is, the multiple upstream\
    \ paths are managed,\n         typically, through a site border router, or via\
    \ the providers.\n   Essentially, for ILNP, multihoming is implemented by enabling:\n\
    \      a) multiple Locator values to be used simultaneously by a node\n      b)\
    \ dynamic, simultaneous binding between one (or more) Identifier\n         value(s)\
    \ and multiple Locator values\n   With respect to the requirements for hosts [RFC1122],\
    \ the multihoming\n   function provided by ILNP is very flexible.  It is not useful\
    \ to\n   discuss ILNP multihoming strictly within the confines of the\n   exposition\
    \ presented in Section 3.3.4 of [RFC1122], as that text is\n   couched in terms\
    \ of relationships between IP Addresses and\n   interfaces, which can be dynamic\
    \ in ILNP.  The closest relationship\n   between ILNP multihoming and [RFC1122]\
    \ would be that certainly ILNP\n   could support the notion of \"Multiple Logical\
    \ Networks\", \"Multiple\n   Logical Hosts\", and \"Simple Multihoming\".\n"
- title: 5.1.  Host Multihoming (H-MH)
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Host Multihoming (H-MH)\n   At present, host multihoming is not common\
    \ in the deployed Internet.\n   When TCP or UDP are in use with an IP-based network-layer\
    \ session,\n   host multihoming cannot provide session resilience, because the\n\
    \   transport protocol's pseudo-header checksum binds the transport-layer\n  \
    \ session to a single IP Address of the multihomed node, and hence to a\n   single\
    \ interface of that node.  SCTP has a protocol-specific\n   mechanism to support\
    \ node multihoming; SCTP can support session\n   resilience both at present and\
    \ also without change in the proposed\n   approach [RFC5061].\n   Host multihoming\
    \ in ILNP is supported directly in each host by ILNP.\n   The simplest explanation\
    \ of H-MH for ILNP is that an ILNP-capable\n   host can simultaneously use multiple\
    \ Locator values, for example, by\n   having a binding between an I value and\
    \ two different L values, e.g.,\n   the ILCC may contain the I-LVs:\n      [I_1,\
    \ L_1]                                       --- (14a)\n      [I_1, L_2]     \
    \                                  --- (14b)\n   Additionally, a host may use\
    \ several I values concurrently, e.g., the\n   ILCC may contain the I-LVs:\n \
    \     [I_1, L_1]                                       --- (15a)\n      [I_1,\
    \ L_2]                                       --- (15b)\n      [I_2, L_2]     \
    \                                  --- (15c)\n      [I_3, L_1]               \
    \                        --- (15d)\n   Architecturally, ILNP considers these all\
    \ to be cases of multihoming:\n   the host is connected to more than one subnetwork,\
    \ each subnetwork\n   being named by a different Locator value.\n   In the cases\
    \ above, the selection of which I-LV to use would be\n   through local policy\
    \ or through management mechanisms.  Additionally,\n   suitably modified transport-layer\
    \ protocols, such as multi-path\n   transport-layer protocol implementations,\
    \ may make use of multiple\n   I-LVs.  Note that in such a case, the way in which\
    \ multiple I-LVs are\n   used would be under the control of the higher-layer protocol.\n\
    \   Recall, however, that L values also have preference -- LPI values --\n   and\
    \ these LPI values can be used at the network layer, or by a\n   transport-layer\
    \ protocol implementation, in order make use of L\n   values in a specific manner.\n\
    \   Note that, from a practical perspective, ILNP dynamically binds L\n   values\
    \ to interfaces on a node to indicate the SNPA for that L value,\n   so the multihoming\
    \ is very flexible: a node could have a single\n   interface and have multiple\
    \ L values bound to that interface.  For\n   example, for expressions (14a) and\
    \ (14b), if the end-system has a\n   single interface with local name eth0, then\
    \ the entries in the ILCC\n   will be:\n      L_1, eth0                      \
    \                 --- (16a)\n      L_2, eth0                                 \
    \      --- (16b)\n   And, if we assume that for expressions (15a-c) the end-system\
    \ has two\n   interfaces, eth0 and eth1, then these ILCC entries are possible:\n\
    \      L_1, eth0                                       --- (17a)\n      L_2, eth1\

    \   We assume that H has a single interface, eth0.  SBR will advertise\n   L_1\
    \ and L_2 internally to the site.  Host H will configure these as\n   both reachable\
    \ via its single interface, eth0, by using ILCC entries\n   as in expressions\
    \ (16a) and (16b).  When packets from H that are to\n   egress the site network\
    \ reach SBR, it can make appropriate decisions\n   on which link to use based\
    \ on the source Locator value (which has\n   been inserted by H) or based on other\
    \ local policy.\n   If, however, H has two interfaces, eth0 and eth1, then it\
    \ can use\n   ILCC entries as in expressions (17a) and (17b).\n   Note that the\
    \ values L_1 and L_2 do not need to be PI-based Locator\n   values, and can be\
    \ taken from ISP-specific PA routing prefix\n   allocations from the upstream\
    \ ISPs providing the two links.\n   Of course, this example is illustrative: many\
    \ other configurations\n   are also possible, but the fundamental mechanism remains\
    \ the same, as\n   described above.\n   If any Locator values change, then H will\
    \ discover this when it sees\n   new Locator values in RAs from SBR, and sees\
    \ that L values that were\n   previously used are no longer advertised.  When\
    \ this happens, H will:\n      a) maintain existing active network-layer sessions:\
    \ based on its\n         current ILCC entries and active sessions, send Locator\
    \ Update\n         (LU) messages to CNs to notify them of the change of L values.\n\
    \         (LU messages are synonymous to Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates.)\n     \
    \ b) if required, update its relevant DNS entries with the new L\n         value\
    \ in the appropriate DNS records, to enable correct\n         resolution for new\
    \ incoming session requests.\n   From an engineering viewpoint, H also updates\
    \ its ILCC data, removing\n   the old L value(s) and replacing with new L value(s)\
    \ as required.\n   Depending on the nature of the physical change in connectivity\
    \ that\n   the L value change represents, this may disrupt upper-level\n   protocols,\
    \ e.g., a fibre cut.  Dealing with such physical-level\n   disruption is beyond\
    \ the scope of ILNP.  However, ILNP supports\n   graceful changes in L values,\
    \ and this is explained below in Section\n   6 in the discussion on mobility support.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Site Multihoming (S-MH)\n   At present, site multihoming is common in the\
    \ deployed Internet.\n   This is primarily achieved by advertising the site's\
    \ routing\n   prefix(es) to more than one upstream Internet service provider at\
    \ a\n   given time.  In turn, this requires de-aggregation of routing\n   prefixes\
    \ within the inter-domain routing system.  This increases the\n   entropy of the\
    \ inter-domain routing system (e.g., RIB/FIB size\n   increases beyond the minimal\
    \ RIB/FIB size that would be required to\n   reach all sites).\n   Site multihoming,\
    \ in its simplest form in ILNP, is an extension of\n   the H-MH scenario described\
    \ in Section 5.1.  If we consider Figure\n   5.1, and assume that there are many\
    \ hosts in the site network, then\n   each host can choose (a) whether or not\
    \ to manage its own ILNP\n   connectivity, and (b) whether or not to use multiple\
    \ Locator values.\n   This allows maximal control of connectivity for each host.\n\
    \   Of course, with ILNPv6, just as any IPv6 router is required to\n   generate\
    \ IPv6 Router Advertisement messages with the correct routing\n   prefix information\
    \ for the link the RA is advertised upon, the SBR is\n   also required to generate\
    \ RAs containing the correct Locator value(s)\n   for the link that the RA is\
    \ advertised upon.  The correct values for\n   these RA messages are typically\
    \ configured by system administration,\n   or might be passed down from the upstream\
    \ provider.\n   To avoid a DNS Update burst when a site or (sub)network changes\n\
    \   location, a DNS record optimisation is possible by using the new LP\n   record\
    \ for ILNP.  This would change the number of DNS Updates\n   required from Order(Number\
    \ of nodes within the site/subnetwork that\n   moved) to Order(1) [RFC6742].\n"

- title: 6.  Mobility
  contents:
  - "6.  Mobility\n   ILNP supports mobility directly, rather than relying upon special-\n\
    \   purpose mobility extensions as is the case with both IPv4 [RFC2002]\n   (which\
    \ was obsoleted by [RFC5944]) and IPv6 [RFC6275].\n   There are two different\
    \ mobility cases to consider:\n      a) Host Mobility: individual hosts may be\
    \ mobile, moving across\n         administrative boundaries or topological boundaries\
    \ within an\n         IP-based network, or across the Internet.  Such hosts would\n\
    \         need to independently manage their own mobility.\n      b) Network (Site)\
    \ Mobility: a whole site, i.e., one or more IP\n         subnetworks may be mobile,\
    \ moving across administrative\n         boundaries or topological boundaries\
    \ within an IP-based\n         network, or across the Internet.  The site as a\
    \ whole needs to\n         maintain consistency in connectivity.\n         Essentially,\
    \ for ILNP, mobility is implemented by enabling:\n      a) Locator values to be\
    \ changed dynamically by a node, including\n         for active network-layer\
    \ sessions.\n      b) use of Locator Updates to allow active network-layer sessions\n\
    \         to be maintained.\n      c) for those hosts that expect incoming network-layer\
    \ or\n         transport-layer session requests (e.g., servers), updates to\n\
    \         the relevant DNS entries for those hosts.\n   It is possible that a\
    \ device is both a mobile host and part of a\n   mobile network, e.g., a smartphone\
    \ in a mobile site network.  This is\n   supported in ILNP as the mechanism for\
    \ mobile hosts and mobile\n   networks are very similar and work in harmony.\n\
    \   For mobility, there are two general features that must be supported:\n   \
    \   a) Handover (or Hand-off): when a host changes its connectivity\n        \
    \ (e.g., it has a new SNPA as it moves to a new ILNP subnetwork),\n         any\
    \ active network-layer sessions for that host must be\n         maintained with\
    \ minimal disruption (i.e., transparently) to the\n         upper-layer protocols.\n\
    \      b) Rendezvous: when a host that expects incoming network-layer or\n   \
    \      transport-layer session requests has new connectivity (e.g., it\n     \
    \    has a new SNPA as it moves to a new ILNP subnetwork), it needs\n        \
    \ to update its relevant DNS entries so that name resolution will\n         provide\
    \ the correct I and L values to remote nodes.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Mobility / Multihoming Duality in ILNP
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Mobility / Multihoming Duality in ILNP\n   Mobility and multihoming present\
    \ the same set of issues for ILNP.\n   Indeed, mobility and multihoming form a\
    \ duality: the set of Locators\n   associated with a node or site changes.  The\
    \ reason for the change\n   might be different for the case of mobility and multihoming,\
    \ but the\n   effects on the network-layer session state and on correspondents\
    \ is\n   identical.\n   With ILNP, mobility and multihoming are supported using\
    \ a common set\n   of mechanisms.  In both cases, different Locator values are\
    \ used to\n   identify different IP subnetworks.  Also, ILNP nodes that expect\n\
    \   incoming network-layer or transport-layer session requests are\n   assumed\
    \ to have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) stored in the\n   Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS), as is already done within the deployed\n   Internet.  ILNP mobility normally\
    \ relies upon the Secure Dynamic DNS\n   Update standard for mobile nodes to update\
    \ their location information\n   in the DNS.  This approach of using DNS for rendezvous\
    \ with mobile\n   systems was proposed earlier by others [PHG02].\n   Host Mobility\
    \ considers individual hosts that are individually mobile\n   -- for example,\
    \ a mobile telephone carried by a person walking in a\n   city.  Network (Site)\
    \ Mobility considers a group of hosts within a\n   local topology that move jointly\
    \ and periodically change their\n   uplinks to the rest of the Internet -- for\
    \ example, a ship that has\n   wired connections internally but one or more wireless\
    \ uplinks to the\n   rest of the Internet.\n   For ILNP, Host Mobility is analogous\
    \ to host multihoming (H-MH) and\n   Network Mobility is analogous to site multihoming\
    \ (S-MH).  So,\n   mobility and multihoming capabilities can be used together,\
    \ without\n   conflict.\n"

    \ in Figure 6.1.  As this\n   region is now in site network B, as well as site\
    \ network A, H should\n   see RAs from SBR_B for L_B, as well as the RAs for L_A\

    \         (LU messages are synonymous to Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates.)\n     \
    \ b) if required, update its relevant DNS entries with the new L\n         value\

    \ incoming network-layer or transport-layer\n         session requests.\n    \
    \     However, it can opt to do this one of two ways:\n      1) immediate handover:\
    \ the host sends Locator Update (LU) messages\n         to CNs, immediately stops\
    \ using L_A, and switches to using L_B\n         only.  In this case, its ILCC\
    \ entries change to:\n         [I_H, L_B]                                    \
    \    --- (19a)\n         L_B, ra0                                          ---\
    \ (19b)\n         There might be packets in flight to H that use L_A, and H MAY\n\
    \         choose to ignore these on reception.\n      2) soft handover: the host\
    \ sends Locator Update (LU) messages to\n         CNS, but it uses both L_A and\
    \ L_B until (i) it no longer\n         receives incoming packets with destination\
    \ Locator values set\n         to L_A within a given time period and (ii) it no\
    \ longer sees\n         RAs for L_A (i.e., it has left the overlap region and\
    \ so has\n         left site network A).  In this case, its ILCC entries change\n\
    \         to:\n         [I_H, L_A]                                        ---\
    \ (20a)\n         L_A, ra0                                          --- (20b)\n\

    \   L_B, ra0                                          --- (20d)\n   ILNP does\
    \ not mandate the use of one handover option over another.\n   Indeed, a host\
    \ may implement both and decide, through local policy or\n   other mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., under the control of a particular transport\n   protocol implementation),\
    \ to use one or other for a specific\n   transport-layer session, as required.\n\
    \   Note that if using soft handover, when in the overlap region, the\n   host\
    \ is multihomed.  Also, soft handover is likely to provide a less\n   disruptive\
    \ handover (e.g., lower packet loss) compared to immediate\n   handover, all other\
    \ things being equal.\n   There is a case where both the host and its correspondent\
    \ node are\n   mobile.  In the unlikely event of simultaneous motion that changes\n\
    \   both nodes' Locators within a very small time period, there is the\n   possibility\
    \ that communication may be lost.  If the communication\n   between the nodes\
    \ was direct (i.e., one node initiated communication\n   with another, through\
    \ a DNS lookup), a node can use the DNS to\n   discover the new Locator value(s)\
    \ for the other node.  If the\n   communication was through some sort of middlebox\
    \ providing a relay\n   service, then communication is more likely to disrupted\
    \ only if the\n   middlebox is also mobile.\n   It is also possible that high\
    \ packet loss results in Locator Updates\n   being lost, which could disrupt handover.\
    \  However, this is an\n   engineering issue and does not impact the basic concept\
    \ of operation;\n   additional discussion on this issue is provided in [RFC6741].\n\
    \   Of course, for any handover, the new end-to-end path through SBR_B\n   might\
    \ have very different end-to-end path characteristics (e.g.,\n   different end-to-end\
    \ delay, packet loss, throughput).  Also, the\n   physical connectivity on interface\
    \ ra0 as well as through SBR_B's\n   uplink may be different.  Such impacts on\
    \ end-to-end packet transfer\n   are outside the scope of ILNP.\n"

    \ Mobile Network Scenario for ILNP\n   In Figure 6.2, we assume that the site\
    \ network is mobile, and the SBR\n   has two radio interfaces ra1 and ra2.  However,\
    \ this particular\n   figure is chosen for simplicity and clarity for our scenario,\
    \ and\n   other configurations are possible, e.g., a single radio interface\n\
    \   which uses separate radio channels (separate carriers, coding\n   channels,\
    \ etc.).  In the figure, ISP_1 and ISP_2 are separate, radio-\n   based service\
    \ providers, accessible via ra1 and ra2.\n   In Figure 6.2a, the SBR has connectivity\
    \ via ISP_1 using Locator\n   value L_1.  The host H, with interface ra0 and Identifier\
    \ I_H, has an\n   established connectivity via the SBR and so has ILCC entries\
    \ as shown\n   in (21):\n      [I_H, L_1]                                    \
    \       --- (21a)\n      L_1, ra0                                            \
    \ --- (21b)\n   Note the equivalence to expressions (18a) and (18b).  As the whole\n\
    \   network moves, the SBR detects a new radio provider, ISP_2, and\n   connects\
    \ to it using ra2, as shown in Figure 6.2b, with the service\n   areas of ISP_1\
    \ and ISP_2 overlapping.  ISP_2 provides Locator L_2,\n   which the SBR advertises\
    \ into the site network along with L_1.  As\n   with the mobile host scenario\
    \ above, individual hosts may decide to\n   perform immediate handover or soft\
    \ handover.  So, the ILCC state for\n   H will be as for expressions (19a) and\
    \ (19b) and (20a)-(20d), but\n   with L_1 in place of L_A, and L_2 in place of\
    \ L_B.  Finally, as in\n   Figure 6.2c, the site network moves and is no longer\
    \ served by ISP_1,\n   and handover is complete.  Note that during the handover\
    \ the site is\n   multihomed, as in Figure 6.2b.\n"

    \ architectural change to\n   IPsec: in place of IP Addresses as used today for\
    \ IPsec SAs, ILNP\n   uses Node Identifier values instead.  Recall that Identifier\
    \ values\n   are immutable once in use, so they can be used to maintain end-to-end\n\
    \   state for any protocol that requires it.  Note from the discussion\n   above\
    \ that the Identifier values for a host remain unchanged when\n   multihoming\
    \ and mobility are in use, so IPsec using ILNP can work in\n   harmony with multihoming\
    \ and mobility [ABH08b] [ABH09a].\n   To resolve the issue of IPsec interoperability\
    \ through a Network\n   Address Translator (NAT) deployment [RFC1631] [RFC3022],\

    \ [RFC3948].\n   This architectural change does not reduce the security provided\
    \ by\n   the IPsec protocols.  In fact, had the Node Identifier namespace\n  \

    \ enhancement in\n   ILNPv6.  IPv6 Neighbour Discovery will work unchanged for\
    \ ILNPv6.\n   ILNPv6 multicasting is the same as IETF standards-track IPv6\n \
    \  multicasting.\n   ILNPv4 is backwards compatible with existing IPv4.  As the\
    \ IPv4\n   address fields are used as 32-bit Locators, using only the address\n\
    \   prefix bits of the 32-bit space, IPv4 routers also would not require\n   changes.\
    \  An IPv4 router would be unaware whether the packet being\n   forwarded were\
    \ classic IPv4 or the proposed enhancement in ILNPv4\n   [RFC6746].  ARP [RFC826]\
    \ requires enhancements to support ILNPv4\n   [RFC6747] [RFC6741].  ILNPv4 multicasting\
    \ is the same as IETF\n   standards-track IPv4 multicasting.\n   If a node supports\
    \ ILNP and intends to receive incoming network-layer\n   or transport-layer sessions,\
    \ the node's Fully Qualified Domain Name\n   (FQDN) normally will have one or\
    \ more NID records and one or more\n   Locator (i.e., L32, L64, and/or LP) records\
    \ associated with the node\n   within the DNS [RFC6741] [RFC6742].\n   When an\
    \ IP host (\"initiator\") initiates a new network-layer session\n   with a correspondent\
    \ (\"responder\"), it normally will perform a DNS\n   lookup to determine the\
    \ address(es) of the responder.  An ILNP host\n   normally will look for Node\
    \ Identifier (\"NID\") and Locator (i.e.,\n   L32, L64, and LP) records in any\
    \ received DNS replies.  DNS servers\n   that support NID and Locator (i.e., L32,\
    \ L64, and LP) records SHOULD\n   include them (when they exist) as additional\
    \ data in all DNS replies\n   to queries for DNS AAAA records [RFC6742].\n   If\
    \ the initiator supports ILNP, and from DNS information learns that\n   the responder\
    \ also supports ILNP, then the initiator will generate an\n   unpredictable ILNP\
    \ Nonce value, cache that value locally as part of\n   the network-layer ILNP\
    \ session, and will include the ILNP Nonce value\n   in its initial packet(s)\
    \ to the responder [RFC6741] [RFC6744]\n   [RFC6746].\n   If the initiator node\
    \ does not find any ILNP-specific DNS resource\n   records for the responder node,\
    \ then the initiator uses classic IP\n   for the new network-layer session with\
    \ the responder, rather than\n   trying to use ILNP for that network-layer session.\
    \  Of course,\n   multiple transport-layer sessions can concurrently share a single\n\
    \   network-layer (e.g., IP or ILNP) session.\n   If the responder node for a\
    \ new network-layer session does not\n   support ILNP and the responder node receives\
    \ initial packet(s)\n   containing the ILNP Nonce, then the responder will drop\
    \ the packet\n   and send an ICMP error message back to the initiator.  If the\n\
    \   responder node for a new network-layer session supports ILNP and\n   receives\
    \ initial packet(s) containing the ILNP Nonce, the responder\n   learns that ILNP\
    \ is in use for that network-layer session (i.e., by\n   the presence of that\
    \ ILNP Nonce).\n   If the initiator node using ILNP does not receive a response\
    \ from the\n   responder in a timely manner (e.g., within TCP timeout for a TCP\n\
    \   session) and also does not receive an ICMP Unreachable error message\n   for\
    \ that packet, OR if the initiator receives an ICMP Parameter\n   Problem error\
    \ message for that packet, then the initiator concludes\n   that the responder\
    \ does not support ILNP.  In this case, the\n   initiator node SHOULD try again\
    \ to create the new network-layer\n   session, but this time using IP (and therefore\
    \ omitting the ILNP\n   Nonce).\n   Finally, since an ILNP node also is a fully\
    \ capable IP node, the\n   upgraded node can use any standardised IP mechanisms\
    \ for\n   communicating with a legacy IP-only node.  So, ILNP will not be worse\n\
    \   than existing IP, but when ILNP is used, the enhanced capabilities\n   described\

  - "9.1.  Authentication of Locator Updates\n   All Locator Update messages are authenticated.\
    \  ILNP requires use of\n   an ILNP session nonce [RFC6744] [RFC6746] to prevent\
    \ off-path\n   attacks, and also allows use of IPsec cryptography to provide\n\
    \   stronger protection where required.\n   Ordinary network-layer sessions based\
    \ on IP are vulnerable to on-path\n   attacks unless IPsec is used.  So the Nonce\

    \ network-\n   layer sessions that are not using IPsec.\n   It is common to have\
    \ non-symmetric paths between two nodes on the\n   Internet.  To reduce the number\
    \ of on-path nodes that know the Nonce\n   value for a given session when ILNP\

    \ use of the ILNP Nonce.\n   It is important to note that, at present, a network-layer\
    \ IP-based\n   session is entirely vulnerable to on-path attacks unless IPsec\
    \ is in\n   use for that particular IP session, so the security properties of\
    \ the\n   new proposal are never worse than for existing IP.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Forged Identifier Attacks
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Forged Identifier Attacks\n   In the deployed Internet, active attacks\
    \ using packets with a forged\n   Source IP Address have been publicly known at\
    \ least since early 1995\n   [CA-1995-01].  While these exist in the deployed\
    \ Internet, they have\n   not been widespread.  This is equivalent to the issue\
    \ of a forged\n   Identifier value and demonstrates that this is not a new threat\n\
    \   created by ILNP.\n   One mitigation for these attacks has been to deploy Source\
    \ IP Address\n   filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].  Jun Bi at Tsinghua University\
    \ cites\n   Arbor Networks as reporting that this mechanism has less than 50%\n\
    \   deployment and cites an MIT analysis indicating that at least 25% of\n   the\
    \ deployed Internet permits forged Source IP Addresses.\n   In [RFC6741], there\
    \ is a discussion of an accidental use of a\n   duplicate Identifier on the Internet.\
    \  However, this sub-section\n   instead focuses on methods for mitigating attacks\
    \ based on packets\n   containing deliberately forged Source Identifier values.\n\
    \   Firstly, the recommendations of [RFC2827] and [RFC3704] remain.  So,\n   any\
    \ packets that have a forged Locator value can be easily filtered\n   using existing\
    \ widely available mechanisms.\n   Secondly, the receiving node does not blindly\
    \ accept any packet with\n   the proper Source Identifier and proper Destination\
    \ Identifier as an\n   authentic packet.  Instead, each ILNP node maintains an\
    \ ILNP\n   Communication Cache (ILCC) for each of its correspondents, as\n   described\
    \ in [RFC6741].  Information in the cache is used in\n   validating received messages\
    \ and preventing off-path attackers from\n   succeeding.  This process is discussed\
    \ more in [RFC6741].\n   Thirdly, any node can distinguish different nodes using\
    \ the same\n   Identifier value by other properties of their ILNP sessions.  For\n\
    \   example, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery prevents more than one node from\n   using\
    \ the same source I-LV at the same time on the same link\n   [RFC4861].  So, cases\
    \ of different nodes using the same Identifier\n   value will involve nodes that\
    \ have different sets of valid Locator\n   values.  A node thus can demultiplex\
    \ based on the combination of\n   Source Locator and Source Identifier if necessary.\
    \  If IPsec is in\n   use, the combination of the Source Identifier and the Security\n\
    \   Parameter Index (SPI) value would be sufficient to demux two\n   different\
    \ ILNP sessions.\n   Fourthly, deployments in high-threat environments also SHOULD\
    \ use\n   IPsec to authenticate control traffic and data traffic.  Because\n \
    \  IPsec for ILNP binds only to the Identifier values, and never to the\n   Locator\
    \ values, a mobile or multihomed node can use IPsec even when\n   its Locator\
    \ value(s) have just changed.\n   Lastly, note well that ordinary IPv4, ordinary\
    \ IPv6, Mobile IPv4, and\n   also Mobile IPv6 already are vulnerable to forged\
    \ Identifier and/or\n   forged IP Address attacks.  An attacker on the same link\
    \ as the\n   intended victim simply forges the victims MAC address and the\n \
    \  victim's IP Address.  With IPv6, when Secure Neighbour Discovery\n   (SEND)\
    \ and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) are in use,\n   the victim\
    \ node can defend its use of its IPv6 address using SEND.\n   With ILNP, when\
    \ SEND and CGAs are in use, the victim node also can\n   defend its use of its\
    \ IPv6 address using SEND.  There are no standard\n   mechanisms to authenticate\
    \ ARP messages, so IPv4 is especially\n   vulnerable to this sort of attack. \
    \ These attacks also work against\n   Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6.  In fact, when\
    \ either form of Mobile IP\n   is in use, there are additional risks, because\
    \ the attacks work not\n   only when the attacker has access to the victim's current\
    \ IP\n   subnetwork but also when the attacker has access to the victim's home\n\
    \   IP subnetwork.  Thus, the risks of using ILNP are not greater than\n   exist\
    \ today with IP or Mobile IP.\n"

    \  The firewall can verify the correct ILNP Nonce is\n   present on incoming control\
    \ packets, dropping any control packets\n   that lack the correct nonce value.\n\
    \   By always including the ILNP Nonce in ILNP-specific control messages,\n  \
    \ even when IPsec is also in use, the firewall can filter out off-path\n   attacks\
    \ against those ILNP messages without needing to perform\n   computationally expensive\
    \ IPsec processing.  In any event, a forged\n   packet from an on-path attacker\

    \ privacy\",\n   whereby the user's location might be determined by others.  The\
    \ term\n   \"location privacy\" does not have a crisp definition within the\n\
    \   Internet community at present.  Some mean the location of a node\n   relative\
    \ to the Internet's routing topology, while others mean the\n   geographic coordinates\
    \ of the node (i.e., latitude X, longitude Y).\n   The concern seems to focus\
    \ on Internet-enabled devices, most commonly\n   handheld devices such as a smartphone,\
    \ that might have 1:1 mappings\n   with individual users.\n   There is a fundamental\
    \ trade-off here.  Quality of a node's Internet\n   connectivity tends to be inversely\
    \ proportional to the \"location\n   privacy\" of that node.  For example, if\
    \ a node were to use a router\n   with NAT as a privacy proxy, routing all traffic\
    \ to and from the\n   Internet via that proxy, then (a) latency will increase\
    \ as the\n   distance increases between the node seeking privacy and its proxy,\n\
    \   and (b) communications with the node seeking privacy will be more\n   vulnerable\
    \ to communication faults -- both due to the proxy itself\n   (which might fail)\
    \ and due to the longer path (which has more points\n   of potential failure than\
    \ a more direct path would have).\n   Any Internet node that wishes for other\
    \ Internet nodes to be able to\n   initiate transport-layer or network-layer sessions\
    \ with it needs to\n   include associated address (e.g., A, AAAA) or Locator (e.g.,\
    \ L32,\n   L64, LP) records in the publicly accessible Domain Name System (DNS).\n\
    \   Information placed in the DNS is publicly accessible.  Since the goal\n  \
    \ of DNS is to distribute information to other Internet nodes, it does\n   not\
    \ provide mechanisms for selective privacy.  Of course, a node that\n   does not\
    \ wish to be contacted need not be present in the DNS.\n   In some cases, various\
    \ parties have attempted to create mappings\n   between IP Address blocks and\
    \ geographic locations.  The quality of\n   such mappings appears to vary [GUF07].\
    \  Many such mapping efforts are\n   driven themselves by efforts to comply with\
    \ legal requirements in\n   various legal jurisdictions.  For example, some content\
    \ providers\n   reportedly have licenses authorising distribution of content in\
    \ one\n   set of locations, but not in a different set of locations.\n   ILNP\
    \ does not compromise user location privacy any more than base\n   IPv6.  In fact,\
    \ by its nature ILNP provides additional choices to the\n   user to protect their\
    \ location privacy.\n"
- title: 10.2.  Identity Privacy
  contents:
  - "10.2.  Identity Privacy\n   Both ILNP and IPv6 permit use of identifier values\
    \ generated using\n   the IPv6 Privacy Address extension [RFC4941].  ILNP and\
    \ IPv6 also\n   support a node having multiple unicast addresses/locators at the\
    \ same\n   time, which facilitates changing the node's addresses/locators over\n\
    \   time.  IPv4 does not have any non-topological identifiers, and many\n   IPv4\
    \ nodes only support one IPv4 unicast address per interface, so\n   IPv4 is not\
    \ directly comparable with IPv6 or ILNP.\n   In normal operation with IPv4, IPv6,\
    \ or ILNP, a mobile node might\n   intend to be accessible for new connection\
    \ attempts from the global\n   Internet and also might wish to have both optimal\
    \ routing and maximal\n   Internet availability, both for sent and received packets.\
    \  In that\n   case, the node will want to have its addressing or location\n \
    \  information kept in the DNS and made available to others.\n   In some cases,\
    \ a mobile node might only desire to initiate network-\n   layer or transport-layer\
    \ sessions with other Internet nodes, and thus\n   not desire to be a responder,\
    \ in which case that node need not be\n   present in the DNS.  Some potential\
    \ correspondent nodes might, as a\n   matter of local security policy, decline\
    \ to communicate with nodes\n   that do not have suitable DNS records present\
    \ in the DNS.  For\n   example, some deployed IPv4-capable mail relays refuse\
    \ to communicate\n   with an initiating node that lacks an appropriate PTR record\
    \ in the\n   DNS.\n   In some cases (for example, intermittent electronic mail\
    \ access or\n   browsing specific web pages), support for long-lived network sessions\n\
    \   (i.e., where network-layer session lifetime is longer than the time\n   the\
    \ node remains on the same subnetwork) is not required.  In those\n   cases, support\
    \ for node mobility (i.e., network-layer session\n   continuity even when the\
    \ SNPA changes) is not required and need not\n   be used.\n   If an ILNP node\
    \ that is mobile chooses not to use DNS for rendezvous,\n   yet desires to permit\
    \ any node on the global Internet to initiate\n   communications with that node,\
    \ then that node may fall back to using\n   Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 instead.\n\
    \   Many residential broadband Internet users are subject to involuntary\n   renumbering,\
    \ usually when their ISP's DHCP server(s) deny a DHCP\n   RENEW request and instead\
    \ issue different IP addressing information\n   to the residential user's device(s).\
    \  In many cases, such users want\n   their home server(s) or client(s) to be\
    \ externally reachable.  Such\n   users today often use Secure DNS Dynamic Update\
    \ to update their\n   addressing or location information in the DNS entries, for\
    \ the\n   devices they wish to make reachable from the global Internet\n   [RFC2136]\
    \ [RFC3007] [LA2006].  This option exists for those users,\n   whether they use\
    \ IPv4, IPv6, or ILNP.  Users also have the option not\n   to use such mechanisms.\n"
