  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet carries a lot of unwanted traffic today.  To\
    \ gain a\n   better understanding of the driving forces behind such unwanted\n\
    \   traffic and to assess existing countermeasures, the IAB organized an\n   \"\
    Unwanted Internet Traffic\" workshop and invited experts on different\n   aspects\
    \ of unwanted traffic from operator, vendor, and research\n   communities to the\
    \ workshop.  The intention was to share information\n   among people from different\
    \ fields and organizations, fostering an\n   interchange of experiences, views,\
    \ and ideas between the various\n   communities on this important topic.  The\
    \ major goal of this workshop\n   was to stimulate discussion at a deep technical\
    \ level to assess\n   today's situation in regards to:\n   o  the kinds of unwanted\
    \ traffic that are seen on the Internet,\n   o  how bad the picture looks,\n \
    \  o  who and where are the major sources of the problem,\n   o  which solutions\
    \ work and which do not, and\n   o  what needs to be done.\n   The workshop was\
    \ very successful.  Over one and half days of\n   intensive discussions, the major\
    \ sources of the unwanted traffic were\n   identified, and a critical assessment\
    \ of the existing mitigation\n   tools was conducted.  However, due to the limitation\
    \ of available\n   time, it was impossible to cover the topic of unwanted traffic\
    \ in its\n   entirety.  Thus, for some of the important issues, only the surface\n\
    \   was touched.  Furthermore, because the primary focus of the workshop\n   was\
    \ to collect and share information on the current state of affairs,\n   it is\
    \ left as the next step to attempt to derive solutions to the\n   issues identified.\
    \  This will be done in part as activities within\n   the IAB, the IETF, and the\
    \ IRTF.\n   During the workshop, a number of product and company names were\n\
    \   cited, which are reflected in the report to a certain extent.\n   However,\
    \ a mention of any product in this report should not be taken\n   as an endorsement\
    \ of that product; there may well be alternative,\n   equally relevant or efficacious\
    \ products in the market place.\n   This report is a summary of the contributions\
    \ by the workshop\n   participants, and thus it is not an IAB document.  The views\
    \ and\n   positions documented in the report do not necessarily reflect IAB\n\
    \   views and positions.\n   The workshop participant list is attached in Appendix\
    \ A.  The agenda\n   of the workshop can be found in Appendix B.  Links to a subset\
    \ of the\n   presentations are provided in Appendix C; the rest of the\n   presentations\
    \ are of a sensitive nature, and it has been agreed that\n   they will not be\
    \ made public.  Definitions of the jargon used in\n   describing unwanted traffic\
    \ can be found in Section 9.\n"

  - "2.  The Root of All Evils: An Underground Economy\n   The first important message\
    \ this workshop would like to bring to the\n   Internet community's attention\
    \ is the existence of an underground\n   economy.  This underground economy provides\
    \ an enormous amount of\n   monetary fuel that drives the generation of unwanted\
    \ traffic.  This\n   economic incentive feeds on an Internet that is to a large\
    \ extent\n   wide open.  The open nature of the Internet fosters innovations but\n\
    \   offers virtually no defense against abuses.  It connects to millions\n   of\
    \ mostly unprotected hosts owned by millions of mostly naive users.\n   These\
    \ users explore and benefit from the vast opportunities offered\n   by the new\
    \ cyberspace, with little understanding of its vulnerability\n   to abuse and\
    \ the potential danger of their computers being\n   compromised.  Moreover, the\
    \ Internet was designed without built-in\n   auditing trails.  This was an appropriate\
    \ choice at the time, but now\n   the lack of traceability makes it difficult\
    \ to track down malicious\n   activities.  Combined with a legal system that is\
    \ yet to adapt to the\n   new challenge of regulating the cyberspace, this means\
    \ the Internet,\n   as of today, has no effective deterrent to miscreants.  The\n\
    \   unfettered design and freedom from regulation have contributed to the\n  \
    \ extraordinary success of the Internet.  At the same time, the\n   combination\
    \ of these factors has also led to an increasing volume of\n   unwanted traffic.\
    \  The rest of this section provides a more detailed\n   account of each of the\
    \ above factors.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The Underground Economy
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Underground Economy\n   As in any economic system, the underground\
    \ economy is regulated by a\n   demand and supply chain.  The underground economy,\
    \ which began as a\n   barter system, has evolved into a giant shopping mall,\
    \ commonly\n   running on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) servers.  The IRC servers\n\
    \   provide various online stores selling information about stolen credit\n  \
    \ cards and bank accounts, malware, bot code, botnets, root accesses to\n   compromised\
    \ hosts and web servers, and much more.  There are DDoS\n   attack stores, credit\
    \ card stores, PayPal and bank account stores, as\n   well as Cisco and Juniper\
    \ router stores that sell access to\n   compromised routers.  Although not everything\
    \ can be found on every\n   server, most common tools used to operate in the underground\
    \ economy\n   can be found on almost all the servers.\n   How do miscreants turn\
    \ attack tools and compromised machines into\n   real assets?  In the simplest\
    \ case, miscreants electronically\n   transfer money from stolen bank accounts\
    \ directly to an account that\n   they control, often in another country.  In\
    \ a more sophisticated\n   example, miscreants use stolen credit cards or PayPal\
    \ accounts for\n   online purchases.  To hide their trails, they often find remailers\n\
    \   who receive the purchased goods and then repackage them to send to\n   the\
    \ miscreants for a fee.  The miscreants may also sell the goods\n   through online\
    \ merchandising sites such as eBay.  They request the\n   payments be made in\
    \ cashier checks or money orders to be sent to the\n   people who provide money\
    \ laundering services for the miscreants by\n   receiving the payments and sending\
    \ them to banks in a different\n   country, again in exchange for a fee.  In either\
    \ case, the\n   destination bank accounts are used only for a short period and\
    \ are\n   closed as soon as the money is withdrawn by the miscreants.\n   The\
    \ miscreants obtain private and financial information from\n   compromised hosts\
    \ and install bots (a.k.a. zombies) on them.  They\n   can also obtain such information\
    \ from phishing attacks.  Spam\n   messages mislead naive users into accessing\
    \ spoofed web sites run by\n   the miscreants where their financial information\
    \ is extracted and\n   collected.\n   The miscreants in general are not skilled\
    \ programmers.  With money,\n   however, they can hire professional writers to\
    \ produce well phrased\n   spam messages, and hire coders to develop new viruses,\
    \ worms,\n   spyware, and botnet control packages, thereby resupplying the\n \
    \  underground market with new tools that produce more unwanted traffic\n   on\
    \ the Internet: spam messages that spread phishing attacks, botnets\n   that are\
    \ used to launch DDoS attacks, click fraud that \"earns\" income\n   by deceiving\
    \ online commercial advertisers, and new viruses and worms\n   that compromise\
    \ more hosts and steal additional financial information\n   as well as system\
    \ passwords and personal identity information.\n   The income gained from the\
    \ above illegal activities allows miscreants\n   to hire spammers, coders, and\
    \ IRC server providers.  Spammers use\n   botnets.  Direct marketing companies\
    \ set up dirty affiliate programs.\n   Some less than scrupulous banks are also\
    \ involved to earn transaction\n   fees from moving the dirty money around.  In\
    \ the underground market,\n   everything can be traded, and everything has a value.\
    \  Thus is\n   spawned unwanted traffic of all kinds.\n   The underground economy\
    \ has evolved very rapidly over the past few\n   years.  In the early days of\
    \ bots and botnets, their activities were\n   largely devoted to DDoS attacks\
    \ and were relatively easy to detect.\n   As the underground economy has evolved,\
    \ so have the botnets.  They\n   have moved from easily detectable behavior to\
    \ masquerading as normal\n   user network activity to achieve their goals, making\
    \ detection very\n   difficult even by vigilant system administrators.\n   The\
    \ drive for this rapid evolution comes to a large extent from the\n   change in\
    \ the intention of miscreant activity.  Early virus attacks\n   and botnets were\
    \ largely anarchic activities.  Many were done by\n   \"script kiddies\" to disrupt\
    \ systems without a real purpose or to\n   demonstrate the prowess of the attacker,\
    \ for example in compromising\n   systems that were touted as \"secure\".  Mirroring\
    \ the\n   commercialization of the Internet and its increasing use for\n   e-business,\
    \ miscreant activity is now mostly focused on conventional\n   criminal lines.\
    \  Systems are quietly subverted with the goal of\n   obtaining illicit financial\
    \ gain in the future, rather than causing\n   visible disruptions as was often\
    \ the aim of the early hackers.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Our Enemy Using Our Networks, Our Tools
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Our Enemy Using Our Networks, Our Tools\n   Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers\
    \ are commonly used as the command\n   and control channel for the underground\
    \ market.  These servers are\n   paid for by miscreants and are professionally\
    \ supported.  They are\n   advertised widely to attract potential consumers, and\
    \ thus are easy\n   to find.  The miscreants first talk to each other on the servers\
    \ to\n   find out who is offering what on the market, then exchange encrypted\n\
    \   private messages to settle the deals.\n   The miscreants are not afraid of\
    \ network operators seeing their\n   actions.  If their activities are interrupted,\
    \ they simply move to\n   another venue.  When ISPs take actions to protect their\
    \ customers,\n   revenge attacks are uncommon as long as the miscreants' cash\
    \ flow is\n   not disturbed.  When a botnet is taken out, they move on to the\
    \ next\n   one, as there is a plentiful supply.  However, if an IRC server is\n\
    \   taken out that disturbs their cash flow, miscreants can be ruthless\n   and\
    \ severe attacks may follow.  They currently have no fear, as they\n   know the\
    \ chances of their being caught are minimal.\n   Our enemies make good use of\
    \ the Internet's global connectivity as\n   well as all the tools the Internet\
    \ has developed.  IRC servers\n   provide a job market for the miscreants and\
    \ shopping malls of attack\n   tools.  Networking research has produced abundant\
    \ results making it\n   easier to build large scale distributed systems, and these\
    \ have been\n   adopted by miscreants to build large size, well-controlled botnets.\n\
    \   Powerful search engines also enable one to quickly find readily\n   available\
    \ tools and resources.  The sophistication of attacks has\n   increased with time,\
    \ while the skills required to launch effective\n   attacks have become minimal.\
    \  Attackers can be hiding anywhere in the\n   Internet while attacks get launched\
    \ on a global scale.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Compromised Systems Being a Major Source of Problems
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Compromised Systems Being a Major Source of Problems\n   The current Internet\
    \ provides a field ripe for exploitation.  The\n   majority of end hosts run vulnerable\
    \ platforms.  People from all\n   walks of life eagerly jump into the newly discovered\
    \ online world,\n   yet without the proper training needed to understand the full\n\
    \   implications.  This is at least partially due to most users failing\n   to\
    \ anticipate how such a great invention can be readily abused.  As a\n   result,\
    \ the Internet has ended up with a huge number of compromised\n   hosts, without\
    \ their owners being aware that it has happened.\n   Unprotected hosts can be\
    \ compromised in multiple ways.  Viruses and\n   worms can get into the system\
    \ through exploiting bugs in the existing\n   operating systems or applications,\
    \ sometimes even in anti-virus\n   programs.  A phishing site may also take the\
    \ opportunity to install\n   malware on a victim's computer when a user is lured\
    \ to the site.\n   More recently, viruses have also started being propagated through\n\
    \   popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  With multiple\n   channels\
    \ of propagation, malware has become wide-spread, and infected\n   machines include\
    \ not only home PCs (although they do represent a\n   large percentage), but also\
    \ corporate servers, and even government\n   firewalls.\n   News of new exploits\
    \ of vulnerabilities of Microsoft Windows\n   platforms is all too frequent, which\
    \ leads to a common perception\n   that the Microsoft Windows platform is a major\
    \ source of\n   vulnerability.  One of the reasons for the frequent vulnerability\n\
    \   exploits of the Windows system is its popularity in the market place;\n  \
    \ thus, a miscreant's investment in each exploit can gain big returns\n   from\
    \ infecting millions of machines.  As a result, each incident is\n   also likely\
    \ to make headlines in the news.  In reality, all other\n   platforms such as\
    \ Linux, Solaris, and MAC OS for example, are also\n   vulnerable to compromises.\
    \  Routers are not exempt from security\n   break-ins either, and using a high-end\
    \ router as a DoS launchpad can\n   be a lot more effective than using a bundle\
    \ of home PCs.\n   Quietly subverting large numbers of hosts and making them part\
    \ of a\n   botnet, while leaving their normal functionality and connectivity\n\
    \   essentially unimpaired, is now a major aim of miscreants and it\n   appears\
    \ that they are being all too successful.  Bots and the\n   functions they perform\
    \ are often hard to detect and most of the time\n   their existence are not known\
    \ to system operators or owners (hence,\n   the alternative name for hosts infected\
    \ with bots controlled by\n   miscreants - zombies); by the time they are detected,\
    \ it might very\n   well be too late as they have carried out the intended\n \
    \  (mal-)function.\n   The existence of a large number of compromised hosts is\
    \ a\n   particularly challenging problem to the Internet's security.  Not\n  \
    \ only does the stolen financial information lead to enormous economic\n   losses,\
    \ but also there has been no quick fix to the problem.  As\n   noted above, in\
    \ many cases the owners of the compromised computers\n   are unaware of the problem.\
    \  Even after being notified, some owners\n   still do not care about fixing the\
    \ problem as long as their own\n   interest, such as playing online games, is\
    \ not affected, even though\n   the public interest is endangered --- large botnets\
    \ can use multi-\n   millions of such compromised hosts to launch DDoS attacks,\
    \ with each\n   host sending an insignificant amount of traffic but the aggregate\n\
    \   exceeding the capacity of the best engineered systems.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Lack of Meaningful Deterrence
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Lack of Meaningful Deterrence\n   One of the Internet's big strengths is\
    \ its ability to provide\n   seamless interconnection among an effectively unlimited\
    \ number of\n   parties.  However, the other side of the same coin is that there\
    \ may\n   not be clear ways to assign responsibilities when something goes\n \
    \  wrong.  Taking DDoS attacks as an example, an attack is normally\n   launched\
    \ from a large number of compromised hosts, the attack traffic\n   travels across\
    \ the Internet backbone to the access network(s) linking\n   to the victims. \
    \ As one can see, there are a number of independent\n   stake-holders involved,\
    \ and it is not immediately clear which party\n   should take responsibility for\
    \ resolving the problem.\n   Furthermore, tracking down an attack is an extremely\
    \ difficult task.\n   The Internet architecture enables any IP host to communicate\
    \ with any\n   other hosts, and it provides no audit trails.  As a result, not\
    \ only\n   is there no limit to what a host may do, but also there is no trace\n\
    \   after the event of what a host may have done.  At this time, there is\n  \
    \ virtually no effective tool available for problem diagnosis or packet\n   trace\
    \ back.  Thus, tracking down an attack is labor intensive and\n   requires sophisticated\
    \ skills.  As will be mentioned in the next\n   section, there is also a lack\
    \ of incentive to report security\n   attacks.  Compounded with the high cost,\
    \ these factors make forensic\n   tracing of an attack to its root a rare event.\n\
    \   In human society, the legal systems provide protection against\n   criminals.\
    \  However, in the cyberspace, the legal systems are lagging\n   behind in establishing\
    \ regulations.  The laws and regulations aim at\n   penalizing the conduct after\
    \ the fact.  If the likelihood of\n   detection is low, the deterrence would be\
    \ minimal.  Many national\n   jurisdictions have regulations about acts of computer\
    \ fraud and\n   abuse, and they often carry significant criminal penalties.  In\
    \ the\n   US (and many other places), it is illegal to access government\n   computers\
    \ without authorization, illegal to damage protected\n   government computers,\
    \ and illegal to access confidential information\n   on protected computers. \
    \ However, the definition of \"access\" can be\n   difficult to ascertain.  For\
    \ example, is sending an ICMP (Internet\n   Control Messaging Protocol) packet\
    \ to a protected computer considered\n   illegal access?  There is a lack of technical\
    \ understanding among\n   lawmakers that would be needed to specify the laws precisely\
    \ and\n   provide effective targeting limited to undesirable acts.  Computer\n\
    \   fraud and liabilities laws provide a forum to address illegal access\n   activities\
    \ and enable prosecution of cybercriminals.  However, one\n   difficulty in prosecuting\
    \ affiliate programs using bot infrastructure\n   is that they are either borderline\
    \ legal, or there is little\n   evidence.  There is also the mentality of taking\
    \ legal action only\n   when the measurable monetary damage exceeds a high threshold,\
    \ while\n   it is often difficult to quantify the monetary damage in individual\n\
    \   cases of cyberspace crimes.\n   There is a coalition between countries on\
    \ collecting cybercriminal\n   evidence across the world, but there is no rigorous\
    \ way to trace\n   across borders.  Laws and rules are mostly local to a country,\n\
    \   policies (when they exist) are mostly enacted and enforced locally,\n   while\
    \ the Internet itself, that carries the unwanted traffic,\n   respects no borders.\
    \  One estimate suggests that most players in the\n   underground economy are\
    \ outside the US, yet most IRC servers\n   supporting the underground market may\
    \ be running in US network\n   providers, enjoying the reliable service and wide\
    \ connectivity to the\n   rest of the world provided by the networks.\n   In addition,\
    \ the definition of \"unwanted\" traffic also varies between\n   different countries.\
    \  For example, China bans certain types of\n   network traffic that are considered\
    \ legitimate elsewhere.  Yet\n   another major difficulty is the trade-off and\
    \ blurred line between\n   having audit trails to facilitate forensic analysis\
    \ and to enforce\n   censorship.  The greater ability we build into the network\
    \ to control\n   traffic, the stronger would be the monitoring requirements coming\n\
    \   from the legislators.\n   It should be emphasized that, while a legal system\
    \ is necessary to\n   create effective deterrence and sanctions against miscreants,\
    \ it is\n   by no means sufficient on its own.  Rather, it must be accompanied\
    \ by\n   technical solutions to unwanted traffic detection and damage\n   recovery.\
    \  It is also by no means a substitute for user education.\n   Only a well informed\
    \ user community can collectively establish an\n   effective defense in the cyberspace.\n"

    \   different parts of the network differs.  Below, we summarize the\n   impact\
    \ on backbone providers, access providers, and enterprise\n   customers, respectively.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Backbone Providers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Backbone Providers\n   Since backbone providers' main line of business\
    \ is packet forwarding,\n   the impact of unwanted traffic is mainly measured\
    \ by whether DDoS\n   traffic affects network availability.  Spam or malware is\
    \ not a major\n   concern because backbone networks do not directly support end\
    \ users.\n   Router compromises may exist, but they are rare events at this time.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  DDoS Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  DDoS Traffic\n   Observation shows that, in the majority of DDoS attacks,\
    \ attack\n   traffic can originate from almost anywhere in the Internet.  In\n\
    \   particular, those regions with high speed user connectivity but\n   poorly\
    \ managed end hosts are often the originating sites of DDoS\n   attacks.  The\
    \ miscreants tend to find targets that offer maximal\n   returns with minimal\
    \ efforts.\n   Backbone networks in general are well-provisioned in regard to\n\
    \   traffic capacities.  Therefore, core routers and backbone link\n   capacity\
    \ do not get affected much by most DDoS attacks; a 5Gbps\n   attack could be easily\
    \ absorbed without causing noticeable impact on\n   the performance of backbone\
    \ networks.  However, DDoS attacks often\n   saturate access networks and make\
    \ a significant impact on customers.\n   In particular, multihomed customers who\
    \ have multiple well-\n   provisioned connections for high throughput and performance\
    \ may\n   suffer from aggregated DDoS traffic coming in from all directions.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Problem Mitigation
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Problem Mitigation\n   Currently, backbone networks do not have effective\
    \ diagnosis or\n   mitigation tools against DDoS attacks.  The foremost problem\
    \ is a\n   lack of incentives to deploy security solutions.  Because IP transit\n\
    \   services are a commodity, controlling cost is essential to surviving\n   the\
    \ competition.  Thus, any expenditure tends to require a clearly\n   identified\
    \ return-on-investment (ROI).  Even when new security\n   solutions become available,\
    \ providers do not necessarily upgrade\n   their infrastructure to deploy the\
    \ solutions, as security solutions\n   are often prevention mechanisms that may\
    \ not have an easily\n   quantifiable ROI.  To survive in the competitive environment\
    \ in which\n   they find themselves, backbone providers also try to recruit more\n\
    \   customers.  Thus, a provider's reputation is important.  Due to the\n   large\
    \ number of attacks and inadequate security solution deployment,\n   effective\
    \ attacks and security glitches can be expected.  However, it\n   is not in a\
    \ provider's best interest to report all the observed\n   attacks.  Instead, the\
    \ provider's first concern is to minimize the\n   number of publicized security\
    \ incidents.  For example, a \"trouble\n   ticket\" acknowledging the problem\
    \ is issued only after a customer\n   complains.  An informal estimate suggested\
    \ that only about 10% of\n   DDoS attacks are actually reported (some other estimates\
    \ have put the\n   figure as low as 2%).  In short, there is a lack of incentives\
    \ to\n   either report problems or deploy solutions.\n   Partly as a consequence\
    \ of the lack of incentive and lack of funding,\n   there exist few DDoS mitigation\
    \ tools for backbone providers.\n   Network operators often work on their own\
    \ time to fight the battle\n   against malicious attacks.  Their primary mitigation\
    \ tools today are\n   Access Control Lists (ACL) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)\
    \ null\n   routes to black-hole unwanted traffic.  These tools can be turned on\n\
    \   locally and do not require coordination across administrative\n   domains.\
    \  When done at, or near, DDoS victims, these simple tools can\n   have an immediate\
    \ effect in reducing the DDoS traffic volume.\n   However, these tools are rather\
    \ rudimentary and inadequate, as we\n   will elaborate in Section 4.2.1.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Access Providers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Access Providers\n   A common issue that access providers share with backbone\
    \ providers is\n   the lack of incentive and the shortage of funding needed to\
    \ deploy\n   security solutions.  As with the situation with security incidents\
    \ on\n   the backbone, the number of security incidents reported by access\n \
    \  providers is estimated to be significantly lower than the number of\n   the\
    \ actual incidents that occurred.\n   Because access providers are directly connected\
    \ to end customers,\n   they also face unique problems of their own.  From the\
    \ access\n   providers' viewpoint, the most severe impact of unwanted traffic\
    \ is\n   not the bandwidth exhaustion, but the customer support load it\n   engenders.\
    \  The primary impact of unwanted traffic is on end users,\n   and access providers\
    \ must respond to incident reports from their\n   customers.  Today, access providers\
    \ are playing the role of IT help\n   desk for many of their customers, especially\
    \ residential users.\n   According to some access providers, during the Microsoft\
    \ Blaster worm\n   attack, the average time taken to handle a customer call was\
    \ over an\n   hour.  Due to the high cost of staffing the help desks, it is\n\
    \   believed that, if a customer calls the help desk just once, the\n   provider\
    \ would lose the profit they would otherwise have otherwise\n   made over the\
    \ lifetime of that customer account.\n   To reduce the high customer service cost\
    \ caused by security breaches,\n   most access providers offer free security software\
    \ to their\n   customers.  It is much cheaper to give the customer \"free\" security\n\
    \   software in the hope of preventing system compromises than handling\n   the\
    \ system break-ins after the event.  However, perhaps due to their\n   lack of\
    \ understanding of the possible security problems they may\n   face, many customers\
    \ fail to install security software despite the\n   free offer from their access\
    \ providers, or even when they do, they\n   may lack the skill needed to configure\
    \ a complex system correctly.\n   What factors may influence how quickly customers\
    \ get the security\n   breaches fixed?  Past experience suggests the following\
    \ observations:\n   o  Notification has little impact on end user repair behavior.\n\
    \   o  There is no significant difference in terms of repair behavior\n      between\
    \ different industries or between business and home users.\n   o  Users' patching\
    \ behavior follows an exponential decay pattern with\n      a time constant of\
    \ approximately 40% per month.  Thus, about 40%\n      of computers tend to be\
    \ patched very quickly when a patch is\n      released, and approximately 40%\
    \ of the remaining vulnerable\n      computers in each following month will show\
    \ signs of being\n      patched.  This leaves a few percent still unpatched after\
    \ 6\n      months.  In the very large population of Internet hosts, this\n   \
    \   results in a significant number of hosts that will be vulnerable\n      for\
    \ the rest of their life.\n   o  There is a general lack of user understanding:\
    \ after being\n      compromised, unmanaged computers may get replaced rather\
    \ than\n      repaired, and this often results in infections occurring during\n\
    \      the installation process on the replacement.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Enterprise Networks: Perspective from a Large Enterprise\n   The operators\
    \ of one big enterprise network reported their experience\n   regarding unwanted\
    \ traffic to the workshop.  Enterprises perceive\n   many forms of bad traffic\
    \ including worms, malware, spam, spyware,\n   Instant Messaging (IM), peer-to-peer\
    \ (P2P) traffic, and DoS.\n   Compared to backbone and access providers, enterprise\
    \ network\n   operators are more willing to investigate security breaches, although\n\
    \   they may hesitate to pay a high price for security solutions.  False\n   positives\
    \ are very costly.  Most operators prefer false negatives to\n   false positives.\
    \  In general, enterprises prefer prevention solutions\n   to detection solutions.\n\
    \   Deliberately created unwanted traffic (as opposed to unwanted traffic\n  \
    \ that might arise from misconfiguration) in enterprise networks can be\n   sorted\
    \ into three categories.  The first is \"Nuisance\", which\n   includes unwanted\
    \ traffic such as spam and peer-to-peer file sharing.\n   Although there were\
    \ different opinions among the workshop\n   participants as to whether P2P traffic\
    \ should, or should not, be\n   considered as unwanted traffic, enterprise network\
    \ operators are\n   concerned not only that P2P traffic represents a significant\
    \ share of\n   the total network load, but they are also sensitive to potential\n\
    \   copyright infringement issues that might lead to significant\n   financial\
    \ and legal impacts on the company as a whole.  In addition,\n   P2P file sharing\
    \ applications have also became a popular channel for\n   malware propagation.\n\
    \   The second category of unwanted traffic is labeled \"Malicious\", which\n\
    \   includes the traffic that spreads malware.  This class of traffic can\n  \
    \ be small in volume but the cost from the resulting damage can be\n   high. \
    \ The clean up after an incident also requires highly skilled\n   operators.\n\
    \   The third category of unwanted traffic is \"Unknown\": it is known that\n\
    \   there exists a class of traffic in the network that can be best\n   described\
    \ in this way, as no one knows its purpose or the locations\n   of the sources.\
    \  Malicious traffic can be obscured by encryption,\n   encapsulation, or covered\
    \ up as legitimate traffic.  The existing\n   detection tools are ineffective\
    \ for this type of traffic.  Noisy\n   worms are easy to identify, but stealth\
    \ worms can open a backdoor on\n   hosts and stay dormant for a long time without\
    \ causing any noticeable\n   detrimental effect.  This type of bad traffic has\
    \ the potential to\n   make the greatest impact on an enterprise from a threat\
    \ perspective.\n   There are more mitigation tools available for enterprise networks\n\
    \   than for backbone and access network providers; one explanation might\n  \
    \ be the greater affordability of solutions for enterprise networks.\n   The costs\
    \ of damage from a security breach can also have a very\n   significant impact\
    \ on the profits of an enterprise.  At the same\n   time, however, the workshop\
    \ participants also expressed concerns\n   regarding the ongoing arms race between\
    \ security exploits and\n   patching solutions.  Up to now, security efforts have,\
    \ by and large,\n   been reactive, creating a chain of security exploits and a\
    \ consequent\n   stream of \"fixes\".  Such a reactive mode has not only created\
    \ a big\n   security market, but also does not enable us to get ahead of\n   attackers.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Domain Name Services
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Domain Name Services\n   Different from backbone and access providers,\
    \ there also exists a\n   class of Internet service infrastructure providers.\
    \  Provision of\n   Domain Name System (DNS) services offers an example here.\
    \  As\n   reported by operators from a major DNS hosting company, over time\n\
    \   there have been increasingly significant DDoS attacks on .com, .net\n   and\
    \ root servers.\n   DNS service operators have witnessed large scale DDoS attacks.\
    \  The\n   most recent ones include reflection attacks resulting from queries\n\
    \   using spoofed source addresses.  The major damage caused by these\n   attacks\
    \ are bandwidth and resource exhaustion, which led to\n   disruption of critical\
    \ services.  The peak rate of daily DNS\n   transactions has been growing at a\
    \ much faster rate than the number\n   of Internet users, and this trend is expected\
    \ to continue.  The heavy\n   load on the DNS servers has led to increasing complexity\
    \ in providing\n   the services.\n   In addition to intentional DDoS Attacks,\
    \ some other causes of the\n   heavy DNS load included (1) well known bugs in\
    \ a small number of DNS\n   servers that still run an old version of the BIND\
    \ software, causing\n   significant load increase at top level servers; and (2)\n\
    \   inappropriately configured firewalls that allow DNS queries to come\n   out\
    \ but block returning DNS replies, resulting in big adverse impacts\n   on the\
    \ overall system.  Most of such issues have been addressed in\n   the DNS operational\
    \ guidelines drafted by the IETF DNS Operations\n   Working Group; however, many\
    \ DNS operators have not taken appropriate\n   actions.\n   At this time, the\
    \ only effective and viable mitigation approach is\n   over-engineering the DNS\
    \ service infrastructure by increasing link\n   bandwidth, the number of servers,\
    \ and the server processing power, as\n   well as deploying network anycast. \
    \ There is a concern about whether\n   the safety margin gained from over-engineering\
    \ is, or is not,\n   adequate in sustaining DNS services over future attacks.\
    \  Looking\n   forward, there are also a few new issues looming.  Two imminent\
    \ ones\n   are the expected widespread deployment of IPv6 whose new DNS software\n\
    \   would inevitably contain new bugs, and the DNS Security Extensions\n   (DNSSEC),\
    \ which could potentially be abused to generate DDoS attacks.\n"

    \ solutions, and followed\n   up with an examination of the effectiveness, or\
    \ lack of it, of the\n   existing solutions.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Internet Vulnerabilities
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Internet Vulnerabilities\n   Below is a list of known Internet vulnerabilities\
    \ and issues around\n   unwanted traffic.\n   o  Packet source address spoofing:\
    \ there has been speculation that\n      attacks using spoofed source addresses\
    \ are decreasing, due to the\n      proliferation of botnets, which can be used\
    \ to launch various\n      attacks without using spoofed source addresses.  It\
    \ is certainly\n      true that not all the attacks use spoofed addresses; however,\
    \ many\n      attacks, especially reflection attacks, do use spoofed source\n\
    \      addresses.\n   o  BGP route hijacking: in a survey conducted by Arbor Networks,\n\
    \      route hijacking together with source address spoofing are listed\n    \
    \  as the two most critical vulnerabilities on the Internet.  It has\n      been\
    \ observed that miscreants hijack bogon prefixes for spam\n      message injections.\
    \  Such hijacks do not affect normal packet\n      delivery and thus have a low\
    \ chance of being noticed.\n   o  Everything over HTTP: port scan attacks occur\
    \ frequently in\n      today's Internet, looking for open TCP or UDP ports through\
    \ which\n      to gain access to computers.  The reaction from computer system\n\
    \      management has been to close down all the unused ports, especially\n  \
    \    in firewalls.  One result of this reaction is that application\n      designers\
    \ have moved to transporting all data communications over\n      HTTP to avoid\
    \ firewall traversal issues.  Transporting \"everything\n      over HTTP\" does\
    \ not block attacks but has simply moved the\n      vulnerability from one place\
    \ to another.\n   o  Everyone comes from Everywhere: in the earlier life of the\n\
    \      Internet it had been possible to get some indication of the\n      authenticity\
    \ of traffic from a specific sender based for example\n      on the Time To Live\
    \ (TTL).  The TTL would stay almost constant\n      when traffic from a certain\
    \ sender to a specific host entered an\n      operators network, since the sender\
    \ will \"always\" set the TTL to\n      the same value.  If a change in the TTL\
    \ value occurred without an\n      accompanying change in the routing, one could\
    \ draw the conclusion\n      that this was potential unwanted traffic.  However,\
    \ since hosts\n      have become mobile, they may be roaming within an operator's\n\
    \      network and the resulting path changes may put more (or less) hops\n  \
    \    between the source and the destination.  Thus, it is no longer\n      possible\
    \ to interpret a change in the TTL value, even if it occurs\n      without any\
    \ corresponding change in routing, as an indication that\n      the traffic has\
    \ been subverted.\n   o  Complex Network Authentication: Network authentication\
    \ as it is\n      used today is far too complex to be feasible for users to use\n\
    \      effectively.  It will also be difficult to make it work with new\n    \
    \  wireless access technologies.\n         A possible scenario envisages a customers\
    \ handset that is\n         initially on a corporate wireless network.  If that\
    \ customer\n         steps out of the corporate building, the handset may get\n\
    \         connected to the corporate network through a GPRS network.  The\n  \
    \       handset may then roam to a wireless LAN network when the user\n      \
    \   enters a public area with a hotspot.  Consequently, we need\n         authentication\
    \ tools for cases when the underlying data link\n         layer technology changes\
    \ quickly, possibly during a single\n         application session.\n   o  Unused\
    \ Security Tools: Vendors and standards have produced quite a\n      number of\
    \ useful security tools; however, not all, or even most,\n      of them get used\
    \ extensively.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Existing Solutions for Backbone Providers\n   Several engineering solutions\
    \ exist that operators can deploy to\n   defend the network against unwanted traffic.\
    \  Adequate provisioning\n   is one commonly used approach that can diminish the\
    \ impact of DDoS on\n   the Internet backbone.  The solution that received most\
    \ mentions at\n   the workshop was BCP 38 on ingress filtering: universal deployment\
    \ of\n   BCP 38 can effectively block DDoS attacks using spoofed source IP\n \
    \  addresses.  At present, Access Control List (ACL) and BGP null\n   routing\
    \ are the two tools most commonly used by network operators to\n   mitigate DDoS\
    \ attacks.  They are effective in blocking DDoS attacks,\n   especially when being\
    \ applied at or near a victim's site.\n   Unfortunately, BCP 38 is not widely\
    \ deployed today.  BCP 38 may\n   require device upgrades, and is considered tedious\
    \ to configure and\n   maintain.  Although widespread deployment of BCP 38 could\
    \ benefit the\n   Internet as a whole, deployment by individual sites imposes\
    \ a certain\n   amount of cost to the site, and does not provide a direct and\n\
    \   tangible benefit in return.  In other words, BCP 38 suffers from a\n   lack\
    \ of deployment incentives.\n   Both BGP null routing and ACL have the drawback\
    \ of relying on manual\n   configuration and thus are labor intensive.  In addition,\
    \ they also\n   suffer from blocking both attack and legitimate packets.  There\
    \ is\n   also a potential that some tools could back-fire, e.g., an overly\n \
    \  long ACL list might significantly slow down packet forwarding in a\n   router.\n\
    \   Unicast Reverse Path Filtering (uRPF), which is available on some\n   routers,\
    \ provides a means of implementing a restricted form of BCP 38\n   ingress filtering\
    \ without the effort of maintaining ACLs. uRPF uses\n   the routing table to check\
    \ that a valid path back to the source\n   exists.  However, its effectiveness\
    \ depends on the specificity of the\n   routes against which source addresses\

    \ most widely deployed\n      protection products.  However, the effectiveness\
    \ of firewalls in\n      protecting enterprise confidential information can be\
    \ weakened by\n      spyware installed internally, and they are ineffective against\n\

    \ more recent development is computer admission control, where a\n   computer\
    \ is granted network access if and only if it belongs to a\n   valid user and\
    \ appears to have the most recent set of security\n   patches installed.  It is\
    \ however a more expensive solution.  A major\n   remaining issue facing enterprise\

    \ requires\n   resources which may not be available.  It also requires education\n\
    \   among the operational community to recognize the critical importance\n   of\

    \ a fundamental change to the\n   current Internet architecture, by replacing\

  contents:
  - "6.1.1.2.  Detection\n   When an attack is launched against a computer system,\
    \ the attack\n   typically leaves evidence of the intrusion in the system logs.\
    \  Each\n   type of intrusion leaves a specific kind of footprint or signature.\n\
    \   The signature can be evidence that certain software has been\n   executed,\
    \ that logins have failed, that administrative privileges\n   have been misused,\
    \ or that particular files and directories have been\n   accessed.  Administrators\
    \ can document these attack signatures and\n   use them to detect the same type\
    \ of attack in the future.  This\n   process can be automated.\n   Because each\
    \ signature is different, it is possible for system\n   administrators to determine\
    \ by looking at the intrusion signature\n   what the intrusion was, how and when\
    \ it was perpetrated, and even how\n   skilled the intruder is.\n   Once an attack\
    \ signature is available, it can be used to create a\n   vulnerability filter,\
    \ i.e., the stored attack signature is compared\n   to actual events in real time\
    \ and an alarm is given when this pattern\n   is repeated.\n   A further step\
    \ may be taken with automated vulnerability signatures,\n   i.e., when a new type\
    \ of attack is found, a vulnerability filter is\n   automatically created.  This\
    \ vulnerability filter can be made\n   available for nodes to defend themselves\

- title: 6.1.2.2.  Network Oriented DDoS Research
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.2.  Network Oriented DDoS Research\n   Research on DDoS attacks that takes\
    \ a network oriented focus may be\n   described by the following oversimplified\
    \ three steps.\n   1.  Find the bad stuff\n   2.  Set the \"evil bit\" on those\
    \ packets\n   3.  Filter out the packets with the \"evil bit\" set\n   This rather\
    \ uncomplicated scheme has to be carried out on high-speed\n   links and interfaces.\
    \  Automation is the only way of achieving this.\n   One way of indirectly setting\
    \ the \"evil bit\" is to use a normalized\n   TTL.  The logic goes: the TTL for\
    \ traffic from this sender has always\n   been \"x\", but has now suddenly become\
    \ \"y\", without any corresponding\n   change in routing.  The conclusion is that\
    \ someone is masquerading as\n   the legitimate sender.  Traffic with the \"y\"\
    \ TTL is filtered out.\n   Another idea is to give traffic received from ISPs\
    \ that are known to\n   do source address validation the \"red carpet treatment\"\
    , i.e., to set\n   the \"good bit\".  When an attack is detected, traffic from\
    \ everyone\n   that doesn't have the \"good bit\" is filtered out.  Apart from\n\
    \   reacting to the attack, this also give ISPs an incentive to do source\n  \
    \ address validation.  If they don't do it, their peers won't set the\n   \"good\
    \ bit\" and the ISP's customers will suffer, dragging down their\n   reputation.\n\
    \   Overlay networks can also be used to stop a DDoS attack.  The idea\n   here\
    \ is that traffic is not routed directly to the destination.\n   Instead, it is\
    \ hidden behind some entry points in the overlay.  The\n   entry points make sure\
    \ the sender is the host he claims he is, and in\n   that case, marks the packet\
    \ with a \"magic bit\".  Packets lacking the\n   \"magic bit\" are not forwarded\
    \ on the overlay.  This has good scaling\n   properties; you only need to have\
    \ enough capacity to tag the amount\n   of traffic you want to receive, not the\
    \ amount you actually receive.\n"

    \ is\n   analysis.  Earlier, it was common to look for the amount of traffic\n\
    \   traversing certain transport ports.  Lately, it has become common to\n   tunnel\
    \ \"everything\" over something else, and a shift has occurred\n   towards looking\
    \ for behavior and/or content.  When you see a certain\n   behavior or content\
    \ over a protocol that is not supposed to behave in\n   this way, it is likely\
    \ that something bad is going on.\n   Since this is an arms race, the miscreants\

    \ that is\n   acceptable.\n"

- title: 6.2.1.  Research and Standards
  contents:
  - "6.2.1.  Research and Standards\n   The workshop discussed how research and standardization\
    \ could\n   mutually support each other.  Quite often there is a commonality of\n\
    \   interest between the two groups.  The IAB supports the Internet\n   Research\
    \ Task Force (IRTF) as a venue for Internet research.  The\n   delta between what\
    \ is done and what could be is still substantial.\n   The discussion focused on\
    \ how standardization in general and the IETF\n   in particular can get help from\
    \ researchers.\n   Since standardization organizations don't have the economic\
    \ strength\n   to simply finance the research they need or want, other means have\
    \ to\n   be used.  One is to correctly and clearly communicate problems,\n   another\
    \ is to supply adequate and relevant information.\n   To attract the research\
    \ community to work with standardization\n   organizations, it is necessary to\
    \ identify the real problems and\n   state them in such a way that they are amenable\
    \ to solution.  General\n   unspecified problems are of no use, e.g., \"This is\
    \ an impossible\n   problem!\" or \"All the problems are because my users behave\
    \ badly!\"\n   Instead, saying \"This is an absolutely critical problem, and we\
    \ have\n   no idea how to solve it!\" is much more attractive.\n   The potential\
    \ research problem should also be communicated in a way\n   that is public.  A\
    \ researcher that wants to take on a problem is\n   helped if she/he can point\
    \ at a slide from NANOG or RIPE that\n   identifies this problem.\n   The way\
    \ researchers go about solving problems is basically to\n   identify all the existing\
    \ constraints, and then relax one of the\n   constraints and see what happens.\
    \  Therefore, rock solid constraints\n   are a show stopper, e.g., \"We can't\
    \ do that, because it has to go\n   into an ASIC!\".  Real constraints have to\
    \ be clearly communicated to\n   and understood by the researcher.\n   One reasonable\
    \ way of fostering cooperation is to entice two or three\n   people and have them\
    \ write a paper on the problem.  What will happen\n   then is that this paper\
    \ will be incrementally improved by other\n   researchers.  The vast majority\
    \ of all research goes into improving\n   on someone else's paper.\n   A second\
    \ important factor is to supply sufficient relevant\n   information.  New information\
    \ that suggests possible ways to address\n   new problems or improve on old or\
    \ partial solutions to previously\n   investigated problems are attractive.  Often,\
    \ understanding of\n   important problems comes from the operator community; when\
    \ trying to\n   initiate research from a standards perspective, keeping operators\
    \ in\n   the loop may be beneficial.\n   Today, the research community is largely\
    \ left on its own, and\n   consequently tends to generate essentially random,\
    \ untargeted\n   results.  If the right people in the standards community say\
    \ the\n   right things to the right people in the research community, it can\n\
    \   literally focus hundreds of graduate students on a single problem.\n   Problem\
    \ statements and data are needed.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2.2.  Research and the Bad Guys\n   A general problem with all research and\
    \ development is that what can\n   be used may also be misused.  In some cases,\
    \ miscreants have received\n   help from research that was never intended.\n \
    \  There are several examples of Free Nets, i.e., networks designed to\n   allow\
    \ end-users to participate without revealing their identity or\n   how and where\
    \ they are connected to the network.  The Free Nets are\n   designed based on\
    \ technologies such as onion routing or mix networks.\n   Free Nets create anonymity\
    \ that allows people to express opinions\n   without having to reveal their true\
    \ identity and thus can be used to\n   promote free speech.  However, these are\
    \ tools that can also work\n   just as well to hide illegal activities in democracies.\n\
    \   Mix networks create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of\n   proxy\
    \ servers.  A message from a sender to a receiver passes by the\n   chain of proxies.\
    \  A message is encrypted with a layered encryption\n   where each layer is understood\
    \ by only one of the proxies in the\n   chain; the actual message is the innermost\
    \ layer.  A mix network will\n   achieve untraceable communication, even if all\
    \ but one of the proxies\n   are compromised by a potential tracer.\n   Onion\
    \ routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a\n   computer network;\
    \ it is a technique that encodes routing information\n   in a set of encrypted\
    \ layers.  Onion routing is a further development\n   of mix networks.\n   Research\
    \ projects have resulted in methods for distributed command\n   and control, e.g.,\
    \ in the form of Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and\n   gossip protocols.  This\
    \ of course has legitimate uses, e.g., for\n   security and reliability applications,\
    \ but it also is extremely\n   useful for DDoS attacks and unwanted traffic in\
    \ general.\n   A lot of effort has gone into research around worms, the result\
    \ is\n   that we have a very good understanding of the characteristics of the\n\
    \   technology associated with worms and how they behave.  This is a very\n  \
    \ good basis when we want to protect against worms.  The downside is\n   that\
    \ researchers also understand how to implement future worms,\n   including knowledge\
    \ on how to design faster worms that won't leave a\n   footprint.\n"

    \   o  Update the host requirements RFC.  The Internet host requirements\n   \
    \   ([RFC1122], [RFC1123]) were developed in 1989.  The Internet has\n      gone\
    \ through fundamental changes since then, including the\n      pervasive security\

    \ developed in 1995.  As with the host requirements,\n      it is also overdue\
    \ for an update.\n   o  Update ingress filtering (BCP 38 [RFC2827] and BCP 84\
    \ [RFC3704]).\n   One immediate action that the IAB should carry out is to inform\

  contents:
  - "9.  Terminology\n   This section gives an overview of some of the key concepts\
    \ and\n   terminology used in this document.  It is not intended to be\n   complete,\
    \ but is offered as a quick reference for the reader of the\n   report.\n   ACL\n\
    \   Access Control List in the context of Internet networking refers to a\n  \
    \ set of IP addresses or routing prefixes (layer 3 or Internet layer\n   information),\
    \ possibly combined with transport protocol port numbers\n   (layer 4 or transport\
    \ layer information).  The layer 3 and/or layer 4\n   information in the packets\
    \ making up a flow entering or leaving a\n   device in the Internet is matched\
    \ against the entries in an ACL to\n   determine whether the packets should, for\
    \ example, be allowed or\n   denied access to some resources.  The ACL effectively\
    \ specifies a\n   filter to be used on a flow of packets.\n   BGP route hijacking\n\
    \   Attack in which an inappropriate route is injected into the global\n   routing\
    \ system with the intent of diverting traffic from its intended\n   recipient\
    \ either as a DoS attack (q.v.) where the traffic is just\n   dropped or as part\
    \ of some wider attack on the recipient.  Injecting\n   spurious routes specifying\
    \ addresses used for bogons can, for\n   example, provide bogus assurance to email\
    \ systems that spam is coming\n   from legitimate addresses.\n   Bogon\n   A bogon\
    \ is an IP packet that has a source address taken for a range\n   of addresses\
    \ that has not yet been allocated to legitimate users, or\n   is a private [RFC1918]\
    \ or reserved address [RFC3330].\n   Bogon prefix\n   A bogon prefix is a route\
    \ that should never appear in the Internet\n   routing table, e.g., from the private\
    \ or unallocated address blocks.\n   Bot\n   A bot is common parlance on the Internet\
    \ for a software program that\n   is a software agent.  A Bot interacts with other\
    \ network services\n   intended for people as if it were a real person.  One typical\
    \ use of\n   bots is to gather information.  The term is derived from the word\n\
    \   \"robot,\" reflecting the autonomous character in the \"virtual robot\"-\n\
    \   ness of the concept.\n   The most common bots are those that covertly install\
    \ themselves on\n   people's computers for malicious purposes, and that have been\n\
    \   described as remote attack tools.  Bots are sometimes called\n   \"zombies\"\
    .\n   Botnet\n   Botnet is a jargon term for a collection of software robots,\
    \ or bots,\n   which run autonomously.  This can also refer to the network of\n\
    \   computers using distributed computing software.  While the term\n   \"botnet\"\
    \ can be used to refer to any group of bots, such as IRC bots,\n   the word is\
    \ generally used to refer to a collection of compromised\n   machines running\
    \ programs, usually referred to as worms, Trojan\n   horses, or backdoors, under\
    \ a common command and control\n   infrastructure.\n   Click fraud\n   Click fraud\
    \ occurs in pay per click (PPC) advertising when a person,\n   automated script,\
    \ or computer program imitates a legitimate user of a\n   web browser clicking\
    \ on an ad for the purpose of generating an\n   improper charge per click.  Pay\
    \ per click advertising is when\n   operators of web sites act as publishers and\
    \ offer clickable links\n   from advertisers in exchange for a charge per click.\n\
    \   Darknet\n   A Darknet (also known as a Network Telescope, a Blackhole, or\
    \ an\n   Internet Sink) is a globally routed network that has no \"real\"\n  \
    \ machines attached and carries only a very small amount of specially\n   crafted\
    \ legitimate traffic.  It is therefore easily possible to\n   separate out and\
    \ analyze unwanted traffic that can arise from a wide\n   variety of events including\
    \ misconfiguration (e.g., a human being\n   mis-typing an IP address), malicious\
    \ scanning of address space by\n   hackers looking for vulnerable targets, backscatter\
    \ from random\n   source denial-of-service attacks, and the automated spread of\n\
    \   malicious software called Internet worms.\n   Dirty affiliate program\n  \
    \ Affiliate programs are distributed marketing programs that recruit\n   agents\
    \ to promote a product or service.  Affiliates get financially\n   compensated\
    \ for each sale associated with their unique 'affiliate\n   ID.'  Affiliates are\
    \ normally instructed by the operator of the\n   affiliate program to not break\
    \ any laws while promoting the product\n   or service.  Sanctions (typically loss\
    \ of unpaid commissions or\n   removal from the affiliate program) are normally\
    \ applied if the\n   affiliate spams or otherwise violates the affiliate program's\n\
    \   policies.\n   Dirty affiliate programs allow spamming, or if they do nominally\n\
    \   prohibit spamming, they don't actually sanction violators.  Dirty\n   affiliate\
    \ programs often promote illegal or deceptive products\n   (prescription drugs\
    \ distributed without regard to normal dispensing\n   requirements, body part\
    \ enlargement products, etc.), employ anonymous\n   or untraceable affiliates,\
    \ offer payment via anonymous online\n   financial channels, and may fail to follow\
    \ normal tax withholding and\n   reporting practices.\n   DoS attack\n   Denial-Of-Service\
    \ attack, a type of attack on a network that is\n   designed to bring the network\
    \ to its knees by flooding it with\n   useless traffic or otherwise blocking resources\
    \ necessary to allow\n   normal traffic flow.\n   DDoS attack\n   Distributed\
    \ Denial of Service, an attack where multiple compromised\n   systems are used\
    \ to target a single system causing a Denial of\n   Service (DoS) attack.\n  \
    \ Honey farm\n   A honey farm is a set of honey pots working together.\n   Honey\
    \ monkey\n   A honey monkey is a honey pot in reverse; instead of sitting and\n\
    \   waiting for miscreants, a honey monkey actively mimics the actions of\n  \
    \ a user surfing the Web.  The honey monkey runs on virtual machines in\n   order\
    \ to detect exploit sites.\n   Honey pot\n   A honey pot is a server attached\
    \ to the Internet that acts as a\n   decoy, attracting potential miscreants in\
    \ order to study their\n   activities and monitor how they are able to break into\
    \ a system.\n   Honeypots are designed to mimic systems that an intruder would\
    \ like\n   to break into but limit the intruder from having access to an entire\n\
    \   network.\n   IRC\n   Internet Relay Chat is a form of instant communication\
    \ over the\n   Internet.  It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many)\n   communication\
    \ in discussion forums called channels, but also allows\n   one-to-one communication,\
    \ originally standardized by RFC 1459\n   [RFC1459] but much improved and extended\
    \ since its original\n   invention.  IRC clients rendezvous and exchange messages\
    \ through IRC\n   servers.  IRC servers are run by many organizations for both\
    \ benign\n   and nefarious purposes.\n   Malware\n   Malware is software designed\
    \ to infiltrate or damage a computer\n   system, without the owner's informed\
    \ consent.  There are\n   disagreements about the etymology of the term itself,\
    \ the primary\n   uncertainty being whether it is a portmanteau word (of \"malicious\"\
    \n   and \"software\") or simply composed of the prefix \"mal-\" and the\n   morpheme\
    \ \"ware\".  Malware references the intent of the creator,\n   rather than any\
    \ particular features.  It includes computer viruses,\n   worms, Trojan horses,\
    \ spyware, adware, and other malicious and\n   unwanted software.  In law, malware\
    \ is sometimes known as a computer\n   contaminant.\n   Mix networks\n   Mix networks\
    \ create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of\n   proxy servers [MIX].\
    \  Each message is encrypted to each proxy; the\n   resulting encryption is layered\
    \ like a Russian doll with the message\n   as the innermost layer.  Even if all\
    \ but one of the proxies are\n   compromised by a tracer, untraceability is still\
    \ achieved.  More\n   information can be found at\n   <http://www.adastral.ucl.ac.uk/~helger/crypto/link/protocols/\n\
    \   mix.php>.\n   Onion routing\n   Onion routing is a technique for anonymous\
    \ communication over a\n   computer network, it is a technique that encodes routing\
    \ information\n   in a set of encrypted layers.  Onion routing is based on mix\
    \ cascades\n   (see mix networks (q.v.)).  More information can be found at\n\
    \   <http://www.onion-router.net/>.\n   Phishing\n   Phishing is a form of criminal\
    \ activity using social engineering\n   techniques.  It is characterized by attempts\
    \ to fraudulently acquire\n   sensitive information, such as passwords and credit\
    \ card details, by\n   masquerading as a trustworthy person or business in an\
    \ apparently\n   official electronic communication.  Phishing is typically carried\
    \ out\n   using spoofed websites, email, or an instant message.  The term\n  \
    \ phishing derives from password harvesting and the use of increasingly\n   sophisticated\
    \ lures to \"fish\" for users' financial information and\n   passwords.\n   Root\
    \ access\n   Access to a system with full administrative privileges bypassing\
    \ any\n   security restrictions placed on normal users.  Derived from the name\n\
    \   traditionally used for the 'superuser' on Unix systems.\n   Script kiddy\n\
    \   Derogatory term for an inexperienced hacker who mindlessly uses\n   scripts\
    \ and other programs developed by others with the intent of\n   compromising computers\
    \ or generating DoS attacks.\n   Spam\n   Spamming is the abuse of electronic\
    \ messaging systems to send\n   unsolicited, undesired bulk messages.  The individual\
    \ messages are\n   refereed to as spam.  The term is frequently used to refer\n\
    \   specifically to the electronic mail form of spam.\n   Spoofing\n   (IP) spoofing\
    \ is a technique where the illegitimate source of IP\n   packets is obfuscated\
    \ by contriving to use IP address(es) that the\n   receiver recognizes as a legitimate\
    \ source.  Spoofing is often used\n   to gain unauthorized access to computers\
    \ or mislead filtering\n   mechanisms, whereby the intruder sends packets into\
    \ the network with\n   an IP source address indicating that the message is coming\
    \ from a\n   legitimate host.  To engage in IP spoofing, a hacker must first use\
    \ a\n   variety of techniques to find an IP address of a valid host and then\n\
    \   modify the packet headers so that it appears that the packets are\n   coming\
    \ from that host.\n   Spyware\n   Any software that covertly gathers user information\
    \ through the\n   user's Internet connection without his or her knowledge, e.g.,\
    \ for\n   spam purposes.\n   UBE\n   Unsolicited Bulk Email: an official term\
    \ for spam.\n   UCE\n   Unsolicited Commercial Email: an official term for spam.\n\
    \   Virus\n   A program or piece of code that is loaded onto a computer without\
    \ the\n   owner's knowledge and runs without their consent.  A virus is self-\n\
    \   replicating code that spreads by inserting copies of itself into\n   other\
    \ executable code or documents, which are then transferred to\n   other machines.\
    \  Typically, the virus has a payload that causes some\n   harm to the infected\
    \ machine when the virus code is executed.\n   Worm\n   A computer worm is a self-replicating\
    \ computer program.  It uses a\n   network to send copies of itself to other systems\
    \ and it may do so\n   without any user intervention.  Unlike a virus, it does\
    \ not need to\n   attach itself to an existing program.  Worms always harm the\
    \ network\n   (if only by consuming bandwidth), whereas viruses always infect\
    \ or\n   corrupt files on a targeted computer.\n   Zombie\n   This is another\
    \ name for a bot.\n"
