  - "                         Logger Protocol Error\n   A conflict was recently discovered\
    \ between the official NCP protocol\n   as described in protocol document 1 and\
    \ the logger protocol as\n   described in RFC 66 by Steve Crocker.  Steve suggested\
    \ that we put\n   out an RFC to alert the network community to this point.\n \
    \  In RFC 66, it is proposed that an ALL allocate command be sent\n   immediately\
    \ following an RTS or STR request for connection.  This\n   conflicts with the\
    \ restriction stated in Protocol Document 1 that an\n   ALL command can be given\
    \ only for an \"open\" connection.\n   To not be required to handle an ALL command\
    \ before a connection is\n   established is a simplifying restriction that an\
    \ NCP implementation\n   may take advantage of.  For example, the Multics NCP\
    \ is currently\n   designed this way.  For this reason, and also because we believe\
    \ that\n   the NCP protocol should not be changed now except for critical\n  \
    \ reasons it is felt that the proposed logger protocol should be\n   modified\
    \ to agree with the existing NCP protocol.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alison De\
    \ La Cruz  11/00  ]\n"
