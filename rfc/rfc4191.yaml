  - "1.  Introduction\n   Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461] specifies a conceptual model\
    \ for hosts\n   that includes a Default Router List and a Prefix List.  Hosts\
    \ send\n   Router Solicitation messages and receive Router Advertisement\n   messages\
    \ from routers.  Hosts populate their Default Router List and\n   Prefix List\
    \ based on information in the Router Advertisement\n   messages.  A conceptual\
    \ sending algorithm uses the Prefix List to\n   determine if a destination address\
    \ is on-link and uses the Default\n   Router List to select a router for off-link\
    \ destinations.\n   In some network topologies where the host has multiple routers\
    \ on its\n   Default Router List, the choice of router for an off-link destination\n\
    \   is important.  In some situations, one router may provide much better\n  \
    \ performance than another for a destination.  In other situations,\n   choosing\
    \ the wrong router may result in a failure to communicate.\n   (Section 5 gives\
    \ specific examples of these scenarios.)\n   This document describes an optional\
    \ extension to Neighbor Discovery\n   Router Advertisement messages for communicating\
    \ default router\n   preferences and more-specific routes from routers to hosts.\
    \  This\n   improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router for an\n\
    \   off-link destination.\n   Note that since these procedures are applicable\
    \ to hosts only, the\n   forwarding algorithm used by the routers (including hosts\
    \ with\n   enabled IP forwarding) is not affected.\n   Neighbor Discovery provides\
    \ a Redirect message that routers can use\n   to correct a host's choice of router.\
    \  A router can send a Redirect\n   message to a host, telling it to use a different\
    \ router for a\n   specific destination.  However, the Redirect functionality\
    \ is limited\n   to a single link.  A router on one link cannot redirect a host\
    \ to a\n   router on another link.  Hence, Redirect messages do not help multi-\n\
    \   homed (through multiple interfaces) hosts select an appropriate\n   router.\n\
    \   Multi-homed hosts are an increasingly important scenario, especially\n   with\
    \ IPv6.  In addition to a wired network connection, like Ethernet,\n   hosts may\
    \ have one or more wireless connections, like 802.11 or\n   Bluetooth.  In addition\
    \ to physical network connections, hosts may\n   have virtual or tunnel network\
    \ connections.  For example, in addition\n   to a direct connection to the public\
    \ Internet, a host may have a\n   tunnel into a private corporate network.  Some\
    \ IPv6 transition\n   scenarios can add additional tunnels.  For example, hosts\
    \ may have\n   6to4 [RFC3056] or configured tunnel [RFC2893] network connections.\n\
    \   This document requires that the preference values and specific routes\n  \
    \ advertised to hosts require explicit administrative configuration.\n   They\
    \ are not automatically derived from routing tables.  In\n   particular, the preference\
    \ values are not routing metrics and it is\n   not recommended that routers \"\
    dump out\" their entire routing tables\n   to hosts.\n   We use Router Advertisement\
    \ messages, instead of some other protocol\n   like RIP [RFC2080], because Router\
    \ Advertisements are an existing\n   standard, stable protocol for router-to-host\
    \ communication.\n   Piggybacking this information on existing message traffic\
    \ from\n   routers to hosts reduces network overhead.  Neighbor Discovery shares\n\
    \   with Multicast Listener Discovery the property that they both define\n   host-to-router\
    \ interactions, while shielding the host from having to\n   participate in more\
    \ general router-to-router interactions.  In\n   addition, RIP is unsuitable because\
    \ it does not carry route lifetimes\n   so it requires frequent message traffic\
    \ with greater processing\n   overheads.\n   The mechanisms specified here are\
    \ backwards-compatible, so that hosts\n   that do not implement them continue\
    \ to function as well as they did\n   previously.\n"

- title: 3.  Conceptual Model of a Host

    \ for a host implementation\n   of default router preferences and more-specific\
    \ routes, corresponding\n   to different levels of support.  We refer to these\
    \ as type A, type B,\n   and type C.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Conceptual Data Structures for Hosts
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Conceptual Data Structures for Hosts\n   Type A hosts ignore default router\
    \ preferences and more-specific\n   routes.  They use the conceptual data structures\
    \ described in\n   Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461].\n   Type B hosts use a Default\
    \ Router List augmented with preference\n   values, but ignore all Route Information\
    \ Options.  They use the\n   Default Router Preference value in the Router Advertisement\
    \ header.\n   They ignore Route Information Options.\n   Type C hosts use a Routing\
    \ Table instead of a Default Router List.\n   (The Routing Table may also subsume\
    \ the Prefix List, but that is\n   beyond the scope of this document.)  Entries\
    \ in the Routing Table\n   have a prefix, prefix length, preference value, lifetime,\
    \ and next-\n   hop router.  Type C hosts use both the Default Router Preference\n\
    \   value in the Router Advertisement header and Route Information\n   Options.\n\
    \   When a type C host receives a Router Advertisement, it modifies its\n   Routing\
    \ Table as follows.  When processing a Router Advertisement, a\n   type C host\
    \ first updates a ::/0 route based on the Router Lifetime\n   and Default Router\
    \ Preference in the Router Advertisement message\n   header.  Then as the host\
    \ processes Route Information Options in the\n   Router Advertisement message\
    \ body, it updates its routing table for\n   each such option.  The Router Preference\
    \ and Lifetime values in a\n   ::/0 Route Information Option override the preference\
    \ and lifetime\n   values in the Router Advertisement header.  Updating each route\
    \ is\n   done as follows.  A route is located in the Routing Table based on\n\
    \   the prefix, prefix length, and next-hop router.  If the received\n   route's\
    \ lifetime is zero, the route is removed from the Routing Table\n   if present.\
    \  If a route's lifetime is non-zero, the route is added to\n   the Routing Table\
    \ if not present and the route's lifetime and\n   preference is updated if the\
    \ route is already present.\n   For example, suppose hosts receive a Router Advertisement\
    \ from router\n   X with a Router Lifetime of 100 seconds and a Default Router\n\
    \   Preference of Medium.  The body of the Router Advertisement contains\n   a\
    \ Route Information Option for ::/0 with a Route Lifetime of 200\n   seconds and\
    \ a Route Preference of Low.  After processing the Router\n   Advertisement, a\
    \ type A host will have an entry for router X in its\n   Default Router List with\
    \ a lifetime of 100 seconds.  If a type B host\n   receives the same Router Advertisement,\
    \ it will have an entry for\n   router X in its Default Router List with a Medium\
    \ preference and a\n   lifetime of 100 seconds.  A type C host will have an entry\
    \ in its\n   Routing Table for ::/0 -> router X, with a Low preference and a\n\
    \   lifetime of 200 seconds.  During processing of the Router\n   Advertisement,\
    \ a type C host MAY have a transient state, in which it\n   has an entry in its\
    \ Routing Table for ::/0 -> router X with a Medium\n   preference and a lifetime\
    \ of 100 seconds.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Conceptual Sending Algorithm for Hosts
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Conceptual Sending Algorithm for Hosts\n   Type A hosts use the conceptual\
    \ sending algorithm described in\n   Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461].\n   When a\
    \ type B host does next-hop determination and consults its\n   Default Router\
    \ List, it primarily prefers reachable routers over\n   non-reachable routers\
    \ and secondarily uses the router preference\n   values.  If the host has no information\
    \ about the router's\n   reachability, then the host assumes the router is reachable.\n\
    \   When a type C host does next-hop determination and consults its\n   Routing\
    \ Table for an off-link destination, it searches its routing\n   table to find\
    \ the route with the longest prefix that matches the\n   destination, using route\
    \ preference values as a tie-breaker if\n   multiple matching routes have the\
    \ same prefix length.  If the best\n   route points to a non-reachable router,\
    \ this router is remembered for\n   the algorithm described in Section 3.5 below,\
    \ and the next best route\n   is consulted.  This check is repeated until a matching\
    \ route is found\n   that points to a reachable router, or no matching routes\
    \ remain.\n   Again, if the host has no information about the router's\n   reachability,\
    \ then the host assumes the router is reachable.\n   If there are no routes matching\
    \ the destination (i.e., no default\n   routes and no more-specific routes), then\
    \ a type C host SHOULD\n   discard the packet and report a Destination Unreachable/No\
    \ Route To\n   Destination error to the upper layer.\n"

  - "3.3.  Destination Cache Management\n   When a type C host processes a Router\

- title: 3.5.  Router Reachability Probing
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Router Reachability Probing\n   When a host avoids using any non-reachable\
    \ router X and instead sends\n   a data packet to another router Y, and the host\
    \ would have used\n   router X if router X were reachable, then the host SHOULD\
    \ probe each\n   such router X's reachability by sending a single Neighbor\n \
    \  Solicitation to that router's address.  A host MUST NOT probe a\n   router's\
    \ reachability in the absence of useful traffic that the host\n   would have sent\
    \ to the router if it were reachable.  In any case,\n   these probes MUST be rate-limited\
    \ to no more than one per minute per\n   router.\n   This requirement allows the\
    \ host to discover when router X becomes\n   reachable and to start using router\
    \ X at that time.  Otherwise, the\n   host might not notice router X's reachability\
    \ and continue to use the\n   less-desirable router Y until the next Router Advertisement\
    \ is sent\n   by X.  Note that the router may have been unreachable for reasons\n\
    \   other than being down (e.g., a switch in the middle being down), so\n   it\
    \ may be up to 30 minutes (the maximum advertisement period) before\n   the next\
    \ Router Advertisement would be sent.\n   For a type A host (following the algorithm\
    \ in [RFC2461]), no probing\n   is needed since all routers are equally preferable.\
    \  A type B or C\n   host, on the other hand, explicitly probes unreachable, preferable\n\
    \   routers to notice when they become reachable again.\n"

    \ with a Medium preference\n      2001:db8::/32-> router Y with a High preference\n\
    \      2001:db8::/32-> router Z with a Low preference\n   and the host is sending\

    \  If routers Y and Z are not\n   reachable, then router W will be chosen and\
    \ the reachability of\n   routers Y and Z will be probed.  If routers W, Y, and\

- title: 4.  Router Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.  Router Configuration\n   Routers SHOULD NOT advertise preferences or routes\

    \ status of a link or presence of the same or another\n   prefix in the routing\
    \ table installed by another source, such as a\n   dynamic routing protocol. \
    \ If done, router implementations SHOULD\n   make sure that announcement of prefixes\

    \   Routers SHOULD NOT send more than 17 Route Information Options in\n   Router\

    \ instance, the lifetime or\n   preference of advertised routes may change, or\
    \ new routes could be\n   added.  In such cases, the router MAY transmit up to\n\
    \   MAX_INITIAL_RTR_ADVERTISEMENTS unsolicited advertisements, using the\n   same\
    \ rules as in [RFC2461].  When ceasing to be an advertising\n   interface and\

- title: 4.1.  Guidance to Administrators
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Guidance to Administrators\n   The High and Low (non-default) preference\
    \ values should only be used\n   when someone with knowledge of both routers and\
    \ the network topology\n   configures them explicitly.  For example, it could\
    \ be a common\n   network administrator, or it could be a customer request to\
    \ different\n   administrators managing the routers.\n   As one exception to this\
    \ general rule, the administrator of a router\n   that does not have a connection\
    \ to the Internet, or is connected\n   through a firewall that blocks general\
    \ traffic, should configure the\n   router to advertise a Low Default Router Preference.\n\
    \   In addition, the administrator of a router should configure the\n   router\
    \ to advertise a specific route for the site prefix of the\n   network(s) to which\
    \ the router belongs.  The administrator may also\n   configure the router to\
    \ advertise specific routes for directly\n   connected subnets and any shorter\
    \ prefixes for networks to which the\n   router belongs.\n   For example, if a\
    \ home user sets up a tunnel into a firewalled\n   corporate network, the access\
    \ router on the corporate network end of\n   the tunnel should advertise itself\
    \ as a default router, but with a\n   Low preference.  Furthermore, the corporate\
    \ router should advertise a\n   specific route for the corporate site prefix.\
    \  The net result is that\n   destinations in the corporate network will be reached\
    \ via the tunnel,\n   and general Internet destinations will be reached via the\
    \ home ISP.\n   Without these mechanisms, the home machine might choose to send\n\
    \   Internet traffic into the corporate network or corporate traffic into\n  \
    \ the Internet, leading to communication failure because of the\n   firewall.\n\
    \   It is worth noting that the network administrator setting up\n   preferences\
    \ and/or more specific routes in Routing Advertisements\n   typically does not\
    \ know which kind of nodes (Type A, B, and/or C)\n   will be connected to its\
    \ links.  This requires that the administrator\n   configure the settings that\
    \ will work in an optimal fashion\n   regardless of which kinds of nodes will\
    \ be attached.  Two examples of\n   how to do so follow.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Best Router for ::/0 vs Router Least Likely to Redirect
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Best Router for ::/0 vs Router Least Likely to Redirect\n   The best router\
    \ for the default route is the router with the best\n   route toward the wider\
    \ Internet.  The router least likely to redirect\n   traffic depends on the actual\
    \ traffic usage.  The two concepts can be\n   different when the majority of communication\
    \ actually needs to go\n   through some other router.\n   For example, consider\
    \ a situation in which you have a link with two\n   routers, X and Y.  Router\
    \ X is the best for 2002::/16.  (It's your\n   6to4 site gateway.)  Router Y is\
    \ the best for ::/0.  (It connects to\n   the native IPv6 Internet.)  Router X\
    \ forwards native IPv6 traffic to\n   router Y; router Y forwards 6to4 traffic\
    \ to router X.  If most\n   traffic from this site is sent to 2002:/16 destinations,\
    \ then router\n   X is the one least likely to redirect.\n   To make type A hosts\
    \ work well, both routers should advertise\n   themselves as default routers.\
    \  In particular, if router Y goes down,\n   type A hosts should send traffic\
    \ to router X to maintain 6to4\n   connectivity, so router X and router Y need\
    \ to be default routers.\n   To make type B hosts work well, router X should advertise\
    \ itself with\n   a High default router preference.  This will cause type B hosts\
    \ to\n   prefer router X, minimizing the number of redirects.\n   To make type\
    \ C hosts work well, router X should in addition advertise\n   the ::/0 route\
    \ with a Low preference and the 2002::/16 route with a\n   Medium preference.\
    \  A type C host will end up with three routes in\n   its routing table: ::/0\
    \ -> router X (Low), ::/0 -> router Y (Medium),\n   2002::/16 -> router X (Medium).\
    \  It will send 6to4 traffic to router\n   X and other traffic to router Y.  Type\
    \ C hosts will not cause any\n   redirects.\n   Note that when type C hosts process\
    \ the Router Advertisement from\n   router X, the Low preference for ::/0 overrides\
    \ the High default\n   router preference.  If the ::/0 specific route were not\
    \ present, then\n   a type C host would apply the High default router preference\
    \ to its\n   ::/0 route to router X.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Multi-Homed Host and Isolated Network
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Multi-Homed Host and Isolated Network\n   In another scenario, a multi-homed\
    \ host is connected to the Internet\n   via router X on one link and to an isolated\
    \ network via router Y on\n   another link.  The multi-homed host might have a\
    \ tunnel into a\n   firewalled corporate network, or it might be directly connected\
    \ to an\n   isolated test network.\n   In this situation, a type A multi-homed\
    \ host (which has no default\n   router preferences or more-specific routes) will\
    \ have no way to\n   intelligently choose between routers X and Y on its Default\
    \ Router\n   List.  Users of the host will see unpredictable connectivity\n  \
    \ failures, depending on the destination address and the choice of\n   router.\n\
    \   If the routers are configured appropriately, a multi-homed type B\n   host\
    \ in this same situation would have stable Internet connectivity,\n   but would\
    \ have no connectivity to the isolated test network.\n   If the routers are configured\
    \ appropriately, a multi-homed type C\n   host in this same situation can correctly\
    \ choose between routers X\n   and Y.  For example, router Y on the isolated network\
    \ should\n   advertise a Route Information Option for the isolated network prefix.\n\
    \   It might not advertise itself as a default router at all (zero Router\n  \
    \ Lifetime), or it might advertise itself as a default router with a\n   Low preference.\
    \  Router X should advertise itself as a default router\n   with a Medium preference.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A malicious node could send Router Advertisement\
    \ messages, specifying\n   a High Default Router Preference or carrying specific\
    \ routes, with\n   the effect of pulling traffic away from legitimate routers.\
    \  However,\n   a malicious node could easily achieve this same effect in other\
    \ ways.\n   For example, it could fabricate Router Advertisement messages with\
    \ a\n   zero Router Lifetime from the other routers, causing hosts to stop\n \
    \  using the other routes.  By advertising a specific prefix, this\n   attack\
    \ could be carried out in a less noticeable way.  However, this\n   attack has\
    \ no significant incremental impact on Internet\n   infrastructure security.\n\
    \   A malicious node could also include an infinite lifetime in a Route\n   Information\
    \ Option causing the route to linger indefinitely.  A\n   similar attack already\
    \ exists with Prefix Information Options in RFC\n   2461, where a malicious node\
    \ causes a prefix to appear as on-link\n   indefinitely, resulting in a lack of\
    \ connectivity if it is not.  In\n   contrast, an infinite lifetime in a Route\
    \ Information Option will\n   cause router reachability probing to continue indefinitely,\
    \ but will\n   not result in a lack of connectivity.\n   Similarly, a malicious\
    \ node could also try to overload hosts with a\n   large number of routes in Route\
    \ Information Options, or with very\n   frequent Route Advertisements.  Again,\
    \ this same attack already\n   exists with Prefix Information Options.\n   [RFC3756]\
    \ provides more details on the trust models, and there is\n   work in progress\
    \ in the SEND WG on securing router discovery messages\n   that will address these\
    \ problems.\n"
