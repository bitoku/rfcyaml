  - "1.  Introduction\n   LDP [RFC5036] distributes labels for Forwarding Equivalence\
    \ Classes\n   (FECs).  LDP uses FEC TLVs in LDP messages to specify FECs.  An\
    \ LDP\n   FEC TLV includes one or more FEC elements.  A FEC element includes a\n\
    \   FEC type and an optional type-dependent value.\n   RFC 5036 specifies two\
    \ FEC types (Prefix and Wildcard), and other\n   documents specify additional\
    \ FEC types; e.g., see [RFC4447] and\n   [MLDP].\n   As specified by RFC 5036,\
    \ the Wildcard FEC Element refers to all FECs\n   relative to an optional constraint.\
    \  The only constraint RFC 5036\n   specifies is one that limits the scope of\
    \ the Wildcard FEC Element to\n   \"all FECs bound to a given label\".\n   The\
    \ RFC 5036 specification of the Wildcard FEC Element has the\n   following deficiencies\
    \ that limit its utility:\n   1) The Wildcard FEC Element is untyped.  There are\
    \ situations where\n      it would be useful to be able to refer to all FECs of\
    \ a given type\n      (as another constraint).\n   2) Use of the Wildcard FEC\
    \ Element is limited to Label Withdraw and\n      Label Release messages only.\
    \  There are situations where it would\n      be useful to have a Wildcard FEC\
    \ Element, with type constraint, in\n      Label Request messages.\n   This document:\n\
    \      - addresses the above limitations by defining a Typed Wildcard FEC\n  \
    \      Element and procedures for its use.\n      - specifies use of the LDP capability\
    \ mechanism [RFC5561] at\n        session establishment time for informing a peer\
    \ that an LDP\n        speaker is capable of handling the Typed Wildcard FEC.\n\
    \      - specifies use of the Typed Wildcard FEC Element in a Label\n        Request\
    \ message.\n      - specifies the Typed Wildcard FEC Element for the Prefix FEC\n\
    \        Element specified by RFC 5036.\n   Note that this document does not change\
    \ procedures specified for the\n   LDP Wildcard FEC Element by RFC 5036.\n"

- title: 4.  Procedures for the Typed Wildcard FEC Element
  contents:
  - "4.  Procedures for the Typed Wildcard FEC Element\n   When a FEC TLV contains\
    \ a Typed Wildcard FEC Element, the Typed\n   Wildcard FEC Element MUST be the\
    \ only FEC Element in the TLV.  If an\n   LDP speaker receives a FEC TLV containing\
    \ a Typed Wildcard FEC\n   Element and any other FEC elements, then the LDP speaker\
    \ should\n   ignore the other FEC elements and continue processing as if the\n\
    \   message only contains the Typed Wildcard FEC Element.\n   An LDP implementation\
    \ that supports the Typed Wildcard FEC Element\n   MUST support its use in Label\
    \ Request, Label Withdraw, and Label\n   Release messages.\n   An LDP implementation\
    \ that supports the Typed Wildcard FEC Element\n   MUST support it for every FEC\
    \ Element Type defined in [RFC5036].\n   Receipt of a Label Request message with\
    \ a FEC TLV containing a Typed\n   Wildcard FEC Element is interpreted as a request\
    \ to send one or more\n   Label Mappings for all FECs of the type specified by\
    \ the FEC Element\n   Type field in the Typed Wildcard FEC Element encoding.\n\
    \   An LDP implementation that supports the Typed Wildcard FEC Element\n   MUST\
    \ support the following constraints whenever a Typed Wildcard FEC\n   appears\
    \ in a Label Withdraw or Label Release message:\n   1) If the message carries\
    \ an optional Label TLV, the Typed Wildcard\n      FEC Element refers to all FECs\
    \ of the specified FEC type bound to\n      the specified label.\n   2) If the\
    \ message has no Label TLV, the Typed Wildcard FEC Element\n      refers to all\
    \ FECs of the specified FEC type.\n   Backwards compatibility with a router not\
    \ supporting the Typed\n   Wildcard FEC element is ensured by the FEC procedures\
    \ defined in RFC\n   5036.  Quoting from RFC 5036:\n      If it [an LSR] encounters\
    \ a FEC Element type it cannot decode, it\n      SHOULD stop decoding the FEC\
    \ TLV, abort processing the message\n      containing the TLV, and send an \"\
    Unknown FEC\" Notification message\n      to its LDP peer signaling an error.\n\
    \   A router receiving a FEC TLV containing a Typed Wildcard FEC element\n   for\
    \ either a FEC Element Type that it doesn't support or for a FEC\n   Element Type\
    \ that doesn't support the use of wildcarding, MUST stop\n   decoding the FEC\
    \ TLV, abort processing the message containing the\n   TLV, and send an \"Unknown\
    \ FEC\" Notification message to its LDP peer\n   to signal an error.\n   A router\
    \ receiving a FEC TLV containing a Typed Wildcard FEC element\n   MAY also leverage\
    \ mechanisms defined in [RFC5919] (say, if it had\n   zero label binding for the\
    \ requested FEC type, etc.).\n"
- title: 5.  Typed Wildcard FEC Capability
  contents:
  - "5.  Typed Wildcard FEC Capability\n   As noted above, RFC 5036 FEC procedures\
    \ provide for backward\n   compatibility with an LSR not supporting the Typed\
    \ Wildcard FEC\n   Element.  However, they don't provide means for an LSR that\
    \ wishes to\n   use the Typed Wildcard FEC Element to determine whether a peer\n\
    \   supports it other than to send a message that uses the FEC Element\n   and\
    \ to wait and see how the peer responds.\n   An LDP speaker that supports the\
