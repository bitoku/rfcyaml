- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Octets 12 and 13 (counting from zero) of the TCP header\
    \ encode the\n   data offset (header length) in 4 bits, as well as 12 bits of\
    \ flags.\n   The least significant 6 bits of these were defined in [RFC0793] as\n\
    \   URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN for TCP control.  Subsequently,\n   [RFC3168]\
    \ defined the CWR and ECE flags for Explicit Congestion\n   Notification (ECN)\
    \ negotiation and signaling; [RFC3540] additionally\n   defined the NS flag for\
    \ the ECN Nonce Sum.\n   As defined in the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry\n\
    \   [IANA-IPFIX], taken from [RFC5102], the tcpControlBits Information\n   Element\
    \ for IPFIX [RFC7011] only covers the original 6 bits from\n   [RFC0793].  To\
    \ allow IPFIX to be used to measure the use of ECN, and\n   to bring the IPFIX\
    \ Information Element definition in line with the\n   current definition of the\
    \ TCP Flags header field, it is necessary to\n   revise this definition.\n   The\
    \ revised definition of the Information Element in Section 3 was\n   developed\
    \ and approved through the IE-DOCTORS process [RFC7013] in\n   August 2013.  Section\
    \ 5.1 of [RFC7013] states \"This process should\n   not in any way be construed\
    \ as allowing the IE-DOCTORS to overrule\n   IETF consensus.  Specifically, Information\
    \ Elements in the IANA\n   Information Element registry that were added with IETF\
    \ consensus\n   require IETF consensus for revision or deprecation\".  Since the\n\
    \   tcpControlBits Information Element was originally defined in\n   [RFC5102],\
    \ an IETF Proposed Standard, any revision of this\n   Information Element definition\
    \ requires IETF Consensus.  The\n   publication of this document fulfills that\
    \ requirement.\n   Section 3 defines the revised tcpControlBits Information Element\
    \ as\n   in Section 9.1 of [RFC7013].\n"

    \      definition specified that the CWR and ECE bits must be exported as\n  \
    \    zero, even if observed.  Collectors should therefore not assume\n      that\
    \ a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element\n      indicates\

    \ Templates,\n   and specifications for reduced-size encoding where appropriate,\

    \   Records, it is not expected that this will have any impact on buffer\n   sizing\
