  - "1.  Introduction\n   The dramatic growth of the Mobile Internet is accelerating\
    \ the\n   exhaustion of the available IPv4 addresses.  It is widely accepted\n\
    \   that IPv6 is necessary for the continued operation and growth of the\n   Internet\
    \ in general and of the Mobile Internet in particular.  While\n   IPv6 brings\
    \ many benefits, certain unique challenges arise when\n   deploying it in mobile\
    \ networks.  This document describes such\n   challenges and outlines the applicability\
    \ of the existing IPv6\n   deployment solutions.  As such, it can be a useful\
    \ reference document\n   for service providers as well as network designers. \
    \ This document\n   does not propose any new protocols or suggest new protocol\n\
    \   specification work.\n   The primary considerations that we address in this\
    \ document on IPv6\n   deployment in mobile networks are:\n   o  Public and Private\
    \ IPv4 address exhaustion and implications to\n      mobile network deployment\
    \ architecture;\n   o  Placement of Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality\
    \ and\n      its implications;\n   o  IPv6-only deployment considerations and\
    \ roaming implications; and\n   o  Fixed-Mobile Convergence and implications to\
    \ overall architecture.\n   In the following sections, we discuss each of these\
    \ in detail.\n   For the most part, we assume the Third Generation Partnership\
    \ Project\n   (3GPP) 3G and 4G network architectures specified in [3GPP.3G] and\n\
    \   [3GPP.4G].  However, the considerations are general enough for other\n   mobile\
    \ network architectures as well [3GPP2.EHRPD].\n"

    \     Figure 1: Mobile Network Architecture\n   A Mobile Node (MN) connects to\
    \ the mobile network either via its Home\n   Network or via a Visited Network\
    \ when the user is roaming outside of\n   the Home Network.  In the 3GPP network\
    \ architecture, an MN accesses\n   the network by connecting to an Access Point\
    \ Name (APN), which maps\n   to a mobile gateway.  Roughly speaking, an APN is\
    \ similar to a\n   Service Set Identifier (SSID) in wireless LAN.  An APN is a\
    \ logical\n   concept that can be used to specify what kinds of services, such\
    \ as\n   Internet access, high-definition video streaming, content-rich\n   gaming,\
    \ and so on, that an MN is entitled to.  Each APN can specify\n   what type of\
    \ IP connectivity (i.e., IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6) is enabled on\n   that particular\
    \ APN.\n   While an APN directs an MN to an appropriate gateway, the MN needs\
    \ an\n   end-to-end \"link\" to that gateway.  In the Long-Term Evolution (LTE)\n\
    \   networks, this link is realized through an Evolved Packet System\n   (EPS)\
    \ bearer.  In the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\n   (UMTS) networks,\
    \ such a link is realized through a Packet Data\n   Protocol (PDP) context.  The\
    \ end-to-end link traverses multiple\n   nodes, which are defined below:\n   o\
    \  Base Station (BS): The radio Base Station provides wireless\n      connectivity\
    \ to the MN.\n   o  Access Network Gateway (ANG): The ANG forwards IP packets\
    \ to and\n      from the MN.  Typically, this is not the MN's default router,\
    \ and\n      the ANG does not perform IP address allocation and management for\n\
    \      the mobile nodes.  The ANG is located either in the Home Network\n    \
    \  or in the Visited Network.\n   o  The Mobile Network Gateway (MNG): The MNG\
    \ is the MN's default\n      router, which provides IP address management.  The\
    \ MNG performs\n      functions such as offering Quality of Service (QoS), applying\n\
    \      subscriber-specific policy, and enabling billing and accounting;\n    \
    \  these functions are sometimes collectively referred to as\n      \"subscriber-management\"\
    \ operations.  The mobile network\n      architecture, as shown in Figure 1, defines\
    \ the necessary protocol\n      interfaces to enable subscriber-management operations.\
    \  The MNG is\n      typically located in the Home Network.\n   o  Border Router\
    \ (BR): As the name implies, a BR borders the Internet\n      for the mobile network.\
    \  The BR does not perform subscriber\n      management for the mobile network.\n\
    \   o  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA): The general\n    \
    \  functionality of AAA is used for subscriber authentication and\n      authorization\
    \ for services as well as for generating billing and\n      accounting information.\n\
    \      In 3GPP network environments, the subscriber authentication and\n     \
    \ the subsequent authorization for connectivity and services is\n      provided\
    \ using the \"Home Location Register\" (HLR) / \"Home\n      Subscriber Server\"\
    \ (HSS) functionality.\n   o  Policy and Charging Rule Function (PCRF): The PCRF\
    \ enables\n      applying policy and charging rules at the MNG.\n   In the rest\
    \ of this document, we use the terms \"operator\", \"service\n   provider\", and\
    \ \"provider\" interchangeably.\n"

- title: 3.1.  IPv4 Address Exhaustion
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IPv4 Address Exhaustion\n   It is generally agreed that the pool of public\
    \ IPv4 addresses is\n   nearing its exhaustion.  The IANA has exhausted the available\
    \ '/8'\n   blocks for allocation to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\n\
    \   The RIRs themselves have either \"run out\" of their blocks or are\n   projected\
    \ to exhaust them in the near future.  This has led to a\n   heightened awareness\
    \ among service providers to consider introducing\n   technologies to keep the\
    \ Internet operational.  For providers, there\n   are two simultaneous approaches\
    \ to addressing the run-out problem:\n   delaying the IPv4 address pool exhaustion\
    \ (i.e., conserving their\n   existing pool) and introducing IPv6 in operational\
    \ networks.  We\n   consider both in the following.\n   Delaying public IPv4 address\
    \ exhaustion for providers involves\n   assigning private IPv4 addressing for\
    \ end-users or extending an IPv4\n   address with the use of port ranges, which\
    \ requires tunneling and\n   additional signaling.  A mechanism such as the Network\
    \ Address\n   Translator (NAT) is used at the provider premises (as opposed to\n\
    \   customer premises) to manage the private IP address assignment and\n   access\
    \ to the Internet.  In the following, we primarily focus on\n   translation-based\
    \ mechanisms such as NAT44 (i.e., translation from\n   public IPv4 to private\
    \ IPv4 and vice versa) and NAT64 (i.e.,\n   translation from public IPv6 to public\
    \ IPv4 and vice versa).  We do\n   this because the 3GPP architecture already\
    \ defines a tunneling\n   infrastructure with the General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GPRS) Tunneling\n   Protocol (GTP), and the architecture allows for dual-stack\
    \ and\n   IPv6-only deployments.\n   In a mobile network, the IPv4 address assignment\
    \ for an MN is\n   performed by the MNG.  In the 3GPP network architecture, this\n\
    \   assignment is performed in conjunction with the Packet Data Network\n   (PDN)\
    \ connectivity establishment.  A PDN connection implies an end-\n   end link (i.e.,\
    \ an EPS bearer in 4G LTE or a PDP context in 3G UMTS)\n   from the MN to the\
    \ MNG.  There can be one or more PDN connections\n   active at any given time\
    \ for each MN.  A PDN connection may support\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic (as\
    \ in a dual-stack PDN in 4G LTE\n   networks), or it may support only one of the\
    \ two traffic types (as in\n   the existing 3G UMTS networks).  The IPv4 address\
    \ is assigned at the\n   time of PDN connectivity establishment or is assigned\
    \ using DHCP\n   after the PDN connectivity is established.  In order to delay\
    \ the\n   exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses, this IP address needs to be a\n\
    \   private IPv4 address that is translated into a shared public IPv4\n   address.\
    \  Hence, there is a need for a private-public IPv4\n   translation mechanism\
    \ in the mobile network.\n   In the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) 4G network, there\
    \ is a requirement\n   for an always-on PDN connection in order to reliably reach\
    \ a mobile\n   user in the All-IP network.  This requirement is due to the need\
    \ for\n   supporting Voice over IP service in LTE, which does not have circuit-\n\
    \   based infrastructure.  If this PDN connection were to use IPv4\n   addressing,\
    \ a private IPv4 address is needed for every MN that\n   attaches to the network.\
    \  This could significantly affect the\n   availability and usage of private IPv4\
    \ addresses.  One way to address\n   this is by making the always-on PDN (that\
    \ requires voice service) to\n   be IPv6.  The IPv4 PDN is only established when\
    \ the user needs it.\n   The 3GPP standards also specify a deferred IPv4 address\
    \ allocation on\n   a dual-stack IPv4v6 PDN at the time of connection establishment.\n\
    \   This has the advantage of a single PDN for IPv6 and IPv4 along with\n   deferring\
    \ IPv4 address allocation until an application needs it.  The\n   deferred address\
    \ allocation requires support for a dynamic\n   configuration protocol such as\
    \ DHCP as well as appropriate triggers\n   to invoke the protocol.  Such a support\
    \ does not exist today in\n   mobile phones.  The newer iterations of smartphones\
    \ could provide\n   such support.  Also, the tethering of smartphones to laptops\
    \ (which\n   typically support DHCP) could use deferred allocation depending on\n\
    \   when a laptop attaches to the smartphone.  Until appropriate triggers\n  \
    \ and host stack support is available, the applicability of the\n   address-deferring\
    \ option may be limited.\n   On the other hand, in the existing 3G UMTS networks,\
    \ there is no\n   requirement for an always-on connection even though many smartphones\n\
    \   seldom relinquish an established PDP context.  The existing so-called\n  \
    \ pre-Release-8 deployments do not support the dual-stack PDP\n   connection.\
    \  Hence, two separate PDP connections are necessary to\n   support IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ traffic.  Even though some MNs, especially the\n   smartphones, in use today\
    \ may have IPv6 stack, there are two\n   remaining considerations.  First, there\
    \ is little operational\n   experience and compliance testing with these existing\
    \ stacks.  Hence,\n   it is expected that their use in large deployments may uncover\n\
    \   software errors and interoperability problems that inhibit providing\n   services\
    \ based on IPv6 for such hosts.  Second, only a fraction of\n   current phones\
    \ in use have such a stack.  As a result, providers need\n   to test, deploy,\
    \ and operationalize IPv6 as they introduce new\n   handsets, which also continue\
    \ to need access to the predominantly\n   IPv4 Internet.\n   The considerations\
    \ from the preceeding paragraphs lead to the\n   following observations.  First,\
    \ there is an increasing need to\n   support private IPv4 addressing in mobile\
    \ networks because of the\n   public IPv4 address run-out problem.  Correspondingly,\
    \ there is a\n   greater need for private-public IPv4 translation in mobile networks.\n\
    \   Second, there is support for IPv6 in both 3G and 4G LTE networks\n   already\
    \ in the form of PDP context and PDN connections.  To begin\n   with, operators\
    \ can introduce IPv6 for their own applications and\n   services.  In other words,\
    \ the IETF's recommended model of dual-stack\n   IPv6 and IPv4 networks is readily\
    \ applicable to mobile networks with\n   the support for distinct APNs and the\
    \ ability to carry IPv6 traffic\n   on PDP/PDN connections.  The IETF dual-stack\
    \ model can be applied\n   using a single IPv4v6 PDN connection in Release-8 and\
    \ onwards but\n   requires separate PDP contexts in the earlier releases.  Finally,\n\
    \   operators can make IPv6 the default for always-on mobile connections\n   using\
    \ either the IPv4v6 PDN or the IPv6 PDN and use IPv4 PDNs as\n   necessary.\n"
- title: 3.2.  NAT Placement in Mobile Networks
  contents:
  - "3.2.  NAT Placement in Mobile Networks\n   In the previous section, we observed\
    \ that NAT44 functionality is\n   needed in order to conserve the available pool\
    \ and delay public IPv4\n   address exhaustion.  However, the available private\
    \ IPv4 pool itself\n   is not abundant for large networks such as mobile networks.\
    \  For\n   instance, the so-called NET10 block [RFC1918] has approximately 16.7\n\
    \   million private IPv4 addresses starting with 10.0.0.0.  A large\n   mobile\
    \ service provider network can easily have more than 16.7\n   million subscribers\
    \ attached to the network at a given time.  Hence,\n   the private IPv4 address\
    \ pool management and the placement of NAT44\n   functionality becomes important.\n\
    \   In addition to the developments cited above, NAT placement is\n   important\
    \ for other reasons as well.  Access networks generally need\n   to produce network\
    \ and service usage records for billing and\n   accounting.  This is true also\
    \ for mobile networks where \"subscriber\n   management\" features (i.e., QoS,\
    \ Policy, and Billing and Accounting)\n   can be fairly detailed.  Since a NAT\
    \ introduces a binding between two\n   addresses, the bindings themselves become\
    \ necessary information for\n   subscriber management.  For instance, the offered\
    \ QoS on private IPv4\n   address and the (shared) public IPv4 address may need\
    \ to be\n   correlated for accounting purposes.  As another example, the\n   Application\
    \ Servers within the provider network may need to treat\n   traffic based on policy\
    \ provided by the PCRF.  If the IP address seen\n   by these Application Servers\
    \ is not unique, the PCRF needs to be able\n   to inspect the NAT binding to disambiguate\
    \ among the individual MNs.\n   The subscriber session management information\
    \ and the service usage\n   information also need to be correlated in order to\
    \ produce harmonized\n   records.  Furthermore, there may be legal requirements\
    \ for storing\n   the NAT binding records.  Indeed, these problems disappear with\
    \ the\n   transition to IPv6.  For now, it suffices to assert that NAT\n   introduces\
    \ state, which needs to be correlated and possibly stored\n   with other routine\
    \ subscriber information.\n   Mobile network deployments vary in their allocation\
    \ of IP address\n   pools.  Some network deployments use the \"centralized model\"\
    \ where\n   the pool is managed by a common node, such as the PDN's BR, and the\n\
    \   pool shared by multiple MNGs all attached to the same BR.  This model\n  \
    \ has served well in the pre-3G deployments where the number of\n   subscribers\
    \ accessing the Mobile Internet at any given time has not\n   exceeded the available\
    \ address pool.  However, with the advent of 3G\n   networks and the subsequent\
    \ dramatic growth in the number of users on\n   the Mobile Internet, service providers\
    \ are increasingly forced to\n   consider their existing network design and choices.\
    \  Specifically,\n   providers are forced to address private IPv4 pool exhaustion\
    \ as well\n   as scalable NAT solutions.\n   In order to tackle the private IPv4\
    \ exhaustion in the centralized\n   model, there would be a need to support overlapped\
    \ private IPv4\n   addresses in the common NAT functionality as well as in each\
    \ of the\n   gateways.  In other words, the IP addresses used by two or more MNs\n\
    \   (which may be attached to the same MNG) are very likely to overlap at\n  \
    \ the centralized NAT, which needs to be able to differentiate traffic.\n   Tunneling\
    \ mechanisms such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)\n   [RFC2784] [RFC2890],\
    \ MPLS [RFC3031] VPN tunnels, or even IP-in-IP\n   encapsulation [RFC2003] that\
    \ can provide a unique identifier for a\n   NAT session can be used to separate\
    \ overlapping private IPv4 traffic\n   as described in [GI-DS-LITE].  An advantage\
    \ of centralizing the NAT\n   and using the overlapped private IPv4 addressing\
    \ is conserving the\n   limited private IPv4 pool.  It also enables the operator's\
    \ enterprise\n   network to use IPv6 from the MNG to the BR; this (i.e., the need\
    \ for\n   an IPv6-routed enterprise network) may be viewed as an additional\n\
    \   requirement by some providers.  The disadvantages include the need\n   for\
    \ additional protocols to correlate the NAT state (at the common\n   node) with\
    \ subscriber session information (at each of the gateways),\n   suboptimal MN-MN\
    \ communication, absence of subscriber-aware NAT (and\n   policy) function, and,\
    \ of course, the need for a protocol from the\n   MNG to BR itself.  Also, if\
    \ the NAT function were to experience\n   failure, all the connected gateway service\
    \ will be affected.  These\n   drawbacks are not present in the \"distributed\"\
    \ model, which we\n   discuss in the following.\n   In a distributed model, the\
    \ private IPv4 address management is\n   performed by the MNG, which also performs\
    \ the NAT functionality.  In\n   this model, each MNG has a block of 16.7 million\
    \ unique addresses,\n   which is sufficient compared to the number of mobile subscribers\n\
    \   active on each MNG.  By distributing the NAT functionality to the\n   edge\
    \ of the network, each MNG is allowed to reuse the available NET10\n   block,\
    \ which avoids the problem of overlapped private IPv4 addressing\n   at the network\
    \ core.  In addition, since the MNG is where subscriber\n   management functions\
    \ are located, the NAT state correlation is\n   readily enabled.  Furthermore,\
    \ an MNG already has existing interfaces\n   to functions such as AAA and PCRF,\
    \ which allows it to perform\n   subscriber management functions with the unique\
    \ private IPv4\n   addresses.  Finally, the MNG can also pass-through certain\
    \ traffic\n   types without performing NAT to the Application Servers located\n\
    \   within the service provider's domain, which allows the servers to\n   also\
    \ identify subscriber sessions with unique private IPv4 addresses.\n   The disadvantages\
    \ of the \"distributed model\" include the absence of\n   centralized addressing\
    \ and centralized management of NAT.\n   In addition to the two models described\
    \ above, a hybrid model is to\n   locate NAT in a dedicated device other than\
    \ the MNG or the BR.  Such\n   a model would be similar to the distributed model\
    \ if the IP pool\n   supports unique private addressing for the mobile nodes,\
    \ or it would\n   be similar to the centralized model if it supports overlapped\
    \ private\n   IP addresses.  In any case, the NAT device has to be able to provide\n\
    \   the necessary NAT session binding information to an external entity\n   (such\
    \ as AAA or PCRF), which then needs to be able to correlate those\n   records\
    \ with the user's session state present at the MNG.\n   The foregoing discussion\
    \ can be summarized as follows.  First, the\n   management of the available private\
    \ IPv4 pool has become important\n   given the increase in Mobile Internet users.\
    \  Mechanisms that enable\n   reuse of the available pool are required.  Second,\
    \ in the context of\n   private IPv4 pool management, the placement of NAT functionality\
    \ has\n   implications to the network deployment and operations.  The\n   centralized\
    \ models with a common NAT have the advantages of\n   continuing their legacy\
    \ deployments and the reuse of private IPv4\n   addressing.  However, they need\
    \ additional functions to enable\n   traffic differentiation and NAT state correlation\
    \ with subscriber\n   state management at the MNG.  The distributed models also\
    \ achieve\n   private IPv4 address reuse and avoid overlapping private IPv4 traffic\n\
    \   in the operator's core, but without the need for additional\n   mechanisms.\
    \  Since the MNG performs (unique) IPv4 address assignment\n   and has standard\
    \ interfaces to AAA and PCRF, the distributed model\n   also enables a single\
    \ point for subscriber and NAT state reporting as\n   well as policy application.\
    \  In summary, providers interested in\n   readily integrating NAT with other\
    \ subscriber management functions,\n   as well as conserving and reusing their\
    \ private IPv4 pool, may find\n   the distributed model compelling.  On the other\
    \ hand, those providers\n   interested in common management of NAT may find the\
    \ centralized model\n   more compelling.\n"

  - "3.3.  IPv6-Only Deployment Considerations\n   As we observed in the previous\
    \ section, the presence of NAT\n   functionality in the network brings up multiple\
    \ issues that would\n   otherwise be absent.  NAT should be viewed as an interim\
    \ solution\n   until IPv6 is widely available, i.e., IPv6 is available for mobile\n\
    \   users for all (or most) practical purposes.  Whereas NATs at provider\n  \
    \ premises may slow down the exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses,\n   expeditious\
    \ and simultaneous introduction of IPv6 in the operational\n   networks is necessary\
    \ to keep the Internet \"going and growing\".\n   Towards this goal, it is important\
    \ to understand the considerations\n   in deploying IPv6-only networks.\n   There\
    \ are three dimensions to IPv6-only deployments: the network\n   itself, the mobile\
    \ nodes, and the applications, represented by the\n   3-tuple {nw, mn, ap}.  The\
    \ goal is to reach the coordinate {IPv6,\n   IPv6, IPv6} from {IPv4, IPv4, IPv4}.\
    \  However, there are multiple\n   paths to arrive at this goal.  The classic\
    \ dual-stack model would\n   traverse the coordinate {IPv4v6, IPv4v6, IPv4v6},\
    \ where each\n   dimension supports co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6.  This appears\
    \ to be\n   the path of least disruption, although we are faced with the\n   implications\
    \ of supporting large-scale NAT in the network.  There is\n   also the cost of\
    \ supporting separate PDP contexts in the existing 3G\n   UMTS networks.  The\
    \ other intermediate coordinate of interest is\n   {IPv6, IPv6, IPv4}, where the\
    \ network and the MN are IPv6-only, and\n   the Internet applications are recognized\
    \ to be predominantly IPv4.\n   This transition path would, ironically, require\
    \ interworking between\n   IPv6 and IPv4 in order for the IPv6-only MNs to be\
    \ able to access\n   IPv4 services and applications on the Internet.  In other\
    \ words, in\n   order to disengage NAT (for IPv4-IPv4), we need to introduce another\n\
    \   form of NAT (i.e., IPv6-IPv4) to expedite the adoption of IPv6.\n   It is\
    \ interesting to consider the preceeding discussion surrounding\n   the placement\
    \ of NAT for IPv6-IPv4 interworking.  There is no\n   overlapping private IPv4\
    \ address problem because each IPv6 address is\n   unique and there are plenty\
    \ of them available.  Hence, there is also\n   no requirement for (IPv6) address\
    \ reuse, which means no protocol is\n   necessary in the centralized model to\
    \ disambiguate NAT sessions.\n   However, there is an additional requirement of\
    \ DNS64 [RFC6147]\n   functionality for IPv6-IPv4 translation.  This DNS64 functionality\n\
    \   must ensure that the synthesized AAAA record correctly maps to the\n   IPv6-IPv4\
    \ translator.\n   IPv6-only deployments in mobile networks need to reckon with\
    \ the\n   following considerations.  First, both the network and the MNs need\n\
    \   to be IPv6 capable.  Expedited network upgrades as well as rollout of\n  \
    \ MNs with IPv6 would greatly facilitate this.  Fortunately, the 3GPP\n   network\
    \ design for LTE already requires the network nodes and the\n   mobile nodes to\
    \ support IPv6.  Even though there are no requirements\n   for the transport network\
    \ to be IPv6, an operational IPv6\n   connectivity service can be deployed with\
    \ appropriate existing\n   tunneling mechanisms in the IPv4-only transport network.\
    \  Hence, a\n   service provider may choose to enforce IPv6-only PDN and address\n\
    \   assignment for their own subscribers in their Home Networks (see\n   Figure\
    \ 1).  This is feasible for the newer MNs when the mobile\n   network is able\
    \ to provide IPv6-only PDN support and IPv6-IPv4\n   interworking for Internet\
    \ access.  For the existing MNs, however, the\n   provider still needs to be able\
    \ to support IPv4-only PDP/PDN\n   connectivity.\n   Migration of applications\
    \ to IPv6 in MNs with IPv6-only PDN\n   connectivity brings challenges.  The applications\
    \ and services\n   offered by the provider obviously need to be IPv6-capable.\
    \  However,\n   an MN may host other applications, which also need to be IPv6-capable\n\
    \   in IPv6-only deployments.  This can be a \"long-tail\" phenomenon;\n   however,\
    \ when a few prominent applications start offering IPv6, there\n   can be a strong\
    \ incentive to provide application-layer (e.g., socket\n   interface) upgrades\
    \ to IPv6.  Also, some IPv4-only applications may\n   be able to make use of alternative\
    \ access such as WiFi when\n   available.  A related challenge in the migration\
    \ of applications is\n   the use of IPv4 literals in application layer protocols\
    \ (such as\n   XMPP) or content (as in HTML or XML).  Some Internet applications\n\
    \   expect their clients to supply IPv4 addresses as literals, and this\n   will\
    \ not be possible with IPv6-only deployments.  Some of these\n   experiences and\
    \ the related considerations in deploying an IPv6-only\n   network are documented\
    \ in [ARKKO-V6].  In summary, migration of\n   applications to IPv6 needs to be\
    \ done, and such a migration is not\n   expected to be uniform across all subsets\
    \ of existing applications.\n   Voice over LTE (VoLTE) also brings some unique\
    \ challenges.  The\n   signaling for voice is generally expected to be available\
    \ for free\n   while the actual voice call itself is typically charged on its\n\
    \   duration.  Such a separation of signaling and the payload is unique\n   to\
    \ voice, whereas an Internet connection is accounted without\n   specifically\
    \ considering application signaling and payload traffic.\n   This model is expected\
    \ to be supported even during roaming.\n   Furthermore, providers and users generally\
    \ require voice service\n   regardless of roaming, whereas Internet usage is subject\
    \ to\n   subscriber preferences and roaming agreements.  This requirement to\n\
    \   ubiquitously support voice service while providing the flexibility\n   for\
    \ Internet usage exacerbates the addressing problem and may hasten\n   provisioning\
    \ of VoLTE using the IPv6-only PDN.\n   As seen earlier, roaming is unique to\
    \ mobile networks, and it\n   introduces new challenges.  Service providers can\
    \ control their own\n   network design but not their peers' networks, which they\
    \ rely on for\n   roaming.  Users expect uniformity in experience even when they\
    \ are\n   roaming.  This imposes a constraint on providers interested in\n   IPv6-only\
    \ deployments to also support IPv4 addressing when their own\n   (outbound) subscribers\
    \ roam to networks that do not offer IPv6.  For\n   instance, when an LTE deployment\
    \ is IPv6-only, a roamed 3G network\n   may not offer IPv6 PDN connectivity. \
    \ Since a PDN connection involves\n   the radio base station, the ANG, and the\
    \ MNG (see Figure 1), it would\n   not be possible to enable IPv6 PDN connectivity\
    \ without roamed\n   network support.  These considerations also apply when the\
    \ visited\n   network is used for offering services such as VoLTE in the so-called\n\
    \   Local Breakout model; the roaming MN's capability as well as the\n   roamed\
    \ network capability to support VoLTE using IPv6 determine\n   whether fallback\
    \ to IPv4 would be necessary.  Similarly, there are\n   inbound roamers to an\
    \ IPv6-ready provider network whose MNs are not\n   capable of IPv6.  The IPv6-ready\
    \ provider network has to be able to\n   support IPv4 PDN connectivity for such\
    \ inbound roamers.  There are\n   encouraging signs that the existing deployed\
    \ network nodes in the\n   3GPP architecture already provide support for IPv6\
    \ PDP context.  It\n   would be necessary to scale this support for a (very) large\
    \ number of\n   mobile users and offer it as a ubiquitous service that can be\n\
    \   accounted for.\n   In summary, IPv6-only deployments should be encouraged\
    \ alongside the\n   dual-stack model, which is the recommended IETF approach.\
    \  This is\n   relatively straightforward for an operator's own services and\n\
    \   applications, provisioned through an appropriate APN and the\n   corresponding\
    \ IPv6-only PDP or EPS bearer.  Some providers may\n   consider IPv6-only deployment\
    \ for Internet access as well, and this\n   would require IPv6-IPv4 interworking.\
    \  When the IPv6-IPv4 translation\n   mechanisms are used in IPv6-only deployments,\
    \ the protocols and the\n   associated considerations specified in [RFC6146] and\
    \ [RFC6145] apply.\n   Finally, such IPv6-only deployments can be phased-in for\
    \ newer mobile\n   nodes, while the existing ones continue to demand IPv4-only\n\
    \   connectivity.\n   Roaming is important in mobile networks, and roaming introduces\n\
    \   diversity in network deployments.  Until IPv6 connectivity is\n   available\
    \ in all mobile networks, IPv6-only mobile network\n   deployments need to be\
    \ prepared to support IPv4 connectivity (and\n   NAT44) for their own outbound\
    \ roaming users as well as for inbound\n   roaming users.  However, by taking\
    \ the initiative to introduce IPv6-\n   only for the newer MNs, the mobile networks\
    \ can significantly reduce\n   the demand for private IPv4 addresses.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Fixed-Mobile Convergence
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Fixed-Mobile Convergence\n   Many service providers have both fixed broadband\
    \ and mobile networks.\n   Access networks are generally disparate, with some\
    \ common\n   characteristics but with enough differences to make it challenging\
    \ to\n   achieve \"convergence\".  For instance, roaming is not a consideration\n\
    \   in fixed access networks.  An All-IP mobile network service provider\n   is\
    \ required to provide voice service, whereas this is not required\n   for a fixed\
    \ network provider.  A \"link\" in fixed networks is\n   generally capable of\
    \ carrying IPv6 and IPv4 traffic, whereas not all\n   mobile networks have \"\
    links\" (i.e., PDP/PDN connections) capable of\n   supporting IPv6 and IPv4. \
    \ Indeed, roaming makes this problem worse\n   when a portion of the link (i.e.,\
    \ the Home Network in Figure 1) is\n   capable of supporting IPv6 and the other\
    \ portion of the link (i.e.,\n   the Visited Network in Figure 1) is not.  Such\
    \ architectural\n   differences, as well as policy and business model differences\
    \ make\n   convergence challenging.\n   Nevertheless, within the same provider's\
    \ space, some common\n   considerations may apply.  For instance, IPv4 address\
    \ management is a\n   common concern for both of the access networks.  This implies\
    \ that\n   the same mechanisms discussed earlier, i.e., delaying IPv4 address\n\
    \   exhaustion and introducing IPv6 in operational networks, apply for\n   the\
    \ converged networks as well.  However, the exact solutions\n   deployed for each\
    \ access network can vary for a variety of reasons,\n   such as:\n   o  Tunneling\
    \ of private IPv4 packets within IPv6 is feasible in fixed\n      networks where\
    \ the endpoint is often a cable or DSL modem.  This\n      is not the case in\
    \ mobile networks where the endpoint is an MN\n      itself.\n   o  Encapsulation-based\
    \ mechanisms such as 6rd [RFC5969] are useful\n      where the operator is unable\
    \ to provide native or direct IPv6\n      connectivity and a residential gateway\
    \ can become a tunnel\n      endpoint for providing this service.  In mobile networks,\
    \ the\n      operator could provide IPv6 connectivity using the existing mobile\n\
    \      network tunneling mechanisms without introducing an additional\n      layer\
    \ of tunneling.\n   o  A mobile network provider may have Application Servers\
    \ (e.g., an\n      email server) in its network that require unique private IPv4\n\
    \      addresses for MN identification, whereas a fixed network provider\n   \
    \   may not have such a requirement or the service itself.\n   These examples\
    \ illustrate that the actual solutions used in an access\n   network are largely\
    \ determined by the requirements specific to that\n   access network.  Nevertheless,\
    \ some sharing between an access and\n   core network may be possible depending\
    \ on the nature of the\n   requirement and the functionality itself.  For example,\
    \ when a fixed\n   network does not require a subscriber-aware feature such as\
    \ NAT, the\n   functionality may be provided at a core router while the mobile\n\
    \   access network continues to provide the NAT functionality at the\n   mobile\
    \ gateway.  If a provider chooses to offer common subscriber\n   management at\
    \ the MNG for both fixed and wireless networks, the MNG\n   itself becomes a convergence\
    \ node that needs to support the\n   applicable transition mechanisms for both\
    \ fixed and wireless access\n   networks.\n   Different access networks of a provider\
    \ are more likely to share a\n   common core network.  Hence, common solutions\
    \ can be more easily\n   applied in the core network.  For instance, configured\
    \ tunnels or\n   MPLS VPNs from the gateways from both mobile and fixed networks\
    \ can\n   be used to carry traffic to the core routers until the entire core\n\
    \   network is IPv6-enabled.\n   There can also be considerations due to the use\
    \ of NAT in access\n   networks.  Solutions such as Femto Networks rely on a fixed\
    \ Internet\n   connection being available for the Femto Base Station to communicate\n\
    \   with its peer on the mobile network, typically via an IPsec tunnel.\n   When\
    \ the Femto Base Station needs to use a private IPv4 address, the\n   mobile network\
    \ access through the Femto Base Station will be subject\n   to NAT policy administration\
    \ including periodic cleanup and purge of\n   NAT state.  Such policies affect\
    \ the usability of the Femto Network\n   and have implications to the mobile network\
    \ provider.  Using IPv6 for\n   the Femto (or any other access technology) could\
    \ alleviate some of\n   these concerns if the IPv6 communication could bypass\
    \ the NAT.\n   In summary, there is interest in Fixed-Mobile Convergence, at least\n\
    \   among some providers.  While there are benefits to harmonizing the\n   network\
    \ as much as possible, there are also idiosyncrasies of\n   disparate access networks\
    \ that influence the convergence.  Perhaps\n   greater harmonization is feasible\
    \ at the higher service layers, e.g.,\n   in terms of offering unified user experience\
    \ for services and\n   applications.  Some harmonization of functions across access\
    \ networks\n   into the core network may be feasible.  A provider's core network\n\
    \   appears to be the place where most convergence is feasible.\n"
- title: 4.  Summary and Conclusion

  - "4.  Summary and Conclusion\n   IPv6 deployment in mobile networks is crucial\
    \ for the Mobile\n   Internet.  In this document, we discussed the considerations\
    \ in\n   deploying IPv6 in mobile networks.  We summarize the discussion in\n\
    \   the following:\n   o  IPv4 address exhaustion and its implications to mobile\
    \ networks:\n      As mobile service providers begin to deploy IPv6, conserving\
    \ their\n      available IPv4 pool implies the need for network address\n    \
    \  translation in mobile networks.  At the same time, providers can\n      make\
    \ use of the 3GPP architecture constructs such as APN and PDN\n      connectivity\
    \ to introduce IPv6 without affecting the predominantly\n      IPv4 Internet access.\
    \  The IETF dual-stack model [RFC4213] can be\n      applied to the mobile networks\
    \ readily.\n   o  The placement of NAT functionality in mobile networks: Both\
    \ the\n      centralized and distributed models of private IPv4 address pool\n\
    \      management have their relative merits.  By enabling each MNG to\n     \
    \ manage its own NET10 pool, the distributed model achieves reuse of\n      the\
    \ available private IPv4 pool and avoids the problems associated\n      with the\
    \ non-unique private IPv4 addresses for the MNs without\n      additional protocol\
    \ mechanisms.  The distributed model also\n      augments the \"subscriber management\"\
    \ functions at an MNG, such as\n      readily enabling NAT session correlation\
    \ with the rest of the\n      subscriber session state.  On the other hand, existing\
    \ deployments\n      that have used the centralized IP address management can\
    \ continue\n      their legacy architecture by placing the NAT at a common node.\n\
    \      The centralized model also achieves private IPv4 address reuse but\n  \
    \    needs additional protocol extensions to differentiate overlapping\n     \
    \ addresses at the common NAT as well as to integrate with policy\n      and billing\
    \ infrastructure.\n   o  IPv6-only mobile network deployments: This deployment\
    \ model is\n      feasible in the LTE architecture for an operator's own services\n\
    \      and applications.  The existing MNs still expect IPv4 address\n      assignment.\
    \  Furthermore, roaming, which is unique to mobile\n      networks, requires that\
    \ a provider support IPv4 connectivity when\n      its (outbound) users roam into\
    \ a mobile network that is not IPv6-\n      enabled.  Similarly, a provider needs\
    \ to support IPv4 connectivity\n      for (inbound) users whose MNs are not IPv6-capable.\
    \  The IPv6-IPv4\n      interworking is necessary for IPv6-only MNs to access\
    \ the IPv4\n      Internet.\n   o  Fixed-Mobile Convergence: The examples discussed\
    \ illustrate the\n      differences in the requirements of fixed and mobile networks.\n\
    \      While some harmonization of functions may be possible across the\n    \
    \  access networks, the service provider's core network is perhaps\n      better-suited\
    \ for converged network architecture.  Similar gains\n      in convergence are\
    \ feasible in the service and application layers.\n"
