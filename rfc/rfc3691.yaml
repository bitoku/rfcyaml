  - "Abstract\n   This document defines an UNSELECT command that can be used to close\n\
    \   the current mailbox in an Internet Message Access Protocol - version\n   4\
    \ (IMAP4) session without expunging it.  Certain types of IMAP\n   clients need\
    \ to release resources associated with the selected\n   mailbox without selecting\
    \ a different mailbox.  While IMAP4 provides\n   this functionality (via a SELECT\
    \ command with a nonexistent mailbox\n   name or reselecting the same mailbox\
    \ with EXAMINE command), a more\n   clean solution is desirable.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Certain types of IMAP clients need to release resources\
    \ associated\n   with the selected mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.\n\
    \   While [IMAP4] provides this functionality (via a SELECT command with\n   a\
    \ nonexistent mailbox name or reselecting the same mailbox with\n   EXAMINE command),\
    \ a more clean solution is desirable.\n   [IMAP4] defines the CLOSE command that\
    \ closes the selected mailbox as\n   well as permanently removes all messages\
    \ with the \\Deleted flag set.\n   However [IMAP4] lacks a command that simply\
    \ closes the mailbox\n   without expunging it.  This document defines the UNSELECT\
    \ command for\n   this purpose.\n   A server which supports this extension indicates\
    \ this with a\n   capability name of \"UNSELECT\".\n   \"C:\" and \"S:\" in examples\
    \ show lines sent by the client and server\n   respectively.\n   The keywords\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\" in\n   this\
    \ document when typed in uppercase are to be interpreted as\n   defined in \"\
    Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"\n   [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 2.  UNSELECT Command
  contents:
  - "2.  UNSELECT Command\n   Arguments:  none\n   Responses:  no specific responses\
    \ for this command\n   Result:     OK - unselect completed, now in authenticated\
    \ state\n               BAD - no mailbox selected, or argument supplied but\n\
    \                     none permitted\n      The UNSELECT command frees server's\
    \ resources associated with the\n      selected mailbox and returns the server\
    \ to the authenticated\n      state.  This command performs the same actions as\
    \ CLOSE, except\n      that no messages are permanently removed from the currently\n\
    \      selected mailbox.\n   Example:    C: A341 UNSELECT\n               S: A341\
    \ OK Unselect completed\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   It is believed that this extension doesn't raise\
    \ any additional\n   security concerns not already discussed in [IMAP4].\n"
- title: 4.  Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "4.  Formal Syntax\n   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur\n\
    \   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].  Non-terminals\n   referenced\
    \ but not defined below are as defined by [IMAP4].\n   Except as noted otherwise,\
    \ all alphabetic characters are case-\n   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower\
    \ case characters to define\n   token strings is for editorial clarity only. \
    \ Implementations MUST\n   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.\n\
    \   command-select  /= \"UNSELECT\"\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a\
    \ standards track or\n   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently\
    \ located\n   at:\n      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities\n\
    \   This document defines the UNSELECT IMAP capabilities.  IANA has added\n  \
    \ this capability to the registry.\n"
- title: 6.  Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "6.  Acknowledgments\n   UNSELECT command was originally implemented by Tim Showalter\
    \ in Cyrus\n   IMAP server.\n   Also, the author of the document would like to\
    \ thank Vladimir Butenko\n   and Mark Crispin for reminding that UNSELECT has\
    \ to be documented.\n   Also thanks to Simon Josefsson for pointing out that there\
    \ are\n   multiple ways to implement UNSELECT.\n"
