- title: Summary
  contents:
  - "Summary\n   This white paper discusses accounting requirements for IPng. It\n\
    \   recommends that all IPng packets carry accounting tags, which would\n   vary\
    \ in size. In the simplest case a tag would simply be a voucher\n   identifying\
    \ the party responsible for the packet. At other times tags\n   should also carry\
    \ other higher-level accounting information.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   The Internet Accounting Model - described in RFC 1272 - specifies\
    \ how\n   accounting information is structured, and how it is collected for use\n\
    \   by accounting aplications.  The model is very general, with\n   accounting\
    \ variables being defined for various layers of a protocol\n   stack.  The group's\
    \ work has so far concentrated on the lower layers,\n   but the model can be extended\
    \ simply by defining the variables\n   required, e.g., for session and application\
    \ layers.\n   Brian Carpenter [1] suggests that IPng packets should carry\n  \
    \ authenticated (source, destination, transaction) triplets, which\n   could be\
    \ used for policy-based routing and accounting. The following\n   sections explain\
    \ how the transaction field - hereafter called an\n   'accounting tag' - could\
    \ be used.\n"
- title: Lower-layer (Transport) Accounting
  contents:
  - "Lower-layer (Transport) Accounting\n   At the lower (network) layers the tag\
    \ would simply be a voucher. This\n   means it is an arbitrary string which identifies\
    \ the party\n   responsible, i.e., willing to pay for, a packet. It would initially\n\
    \   be set by the host which originates the packet, hence at that stage\n   the\
    \ tag would identify the user who sent it.\n   A tag could be changed at various\
    \ points along a packet's path. This\n   could be done as part of the routing\
    \ policy processing so as to\n   reflect changes of the party responsible over\
    \ each section of the\n   path. For example:\n        user - provider        \
    \   tag identifies user\n        provider A - provider B   tag identifies provider\
    \ A\n   The tag could be used by accounting meters to identify the party\n   responsible\
    \ for a traffic flow, without having to deduce this using\n   tables of rules.\
    \ This should considerably simplify accounting for\n   transit traffic across\
    \ intermediate networks.\n"
- title: Higher-layer (Session and Application) Accounting
  contents:
  - "Higher-layer (Session and Application) Accounting\n   At higher layers there\
    \ is a clear need to measure accounting\n   variables and communicate them to\
    \ various points along a packet's\n   path, for example an application server\
    \ may wish to inform a client\n   about its usage of resources. A tag containing\
    \ this information could\n   be read by meters at any point along the packet's\
    \ path for charging\n   purposes, and could also be used by the client to inform\
    \ the user of\n   charges incurred.\n   It would make the collection of accounting\
    \ data much simpler if this\n   information was carried in a standard tag within\
    \ each packet, rather\n   than having different protocols provide this service\
    \ in differing\n   ways.\n   For 'old' applications which remain unaware of the\
    \ tag field, a meter\n   could be placed at a gateway for the application's host.\
    \ This\n   'gateway' meter could determine what the application is by watching\n\
    \   its streams of packets, then set an appropriate value in thir tag\n   fields.\n"
- title: Structure of the accounting tag
  contents:
  - "Structure of the accounting tag\n   The two uses of tags outlined above must\
    \ be able to coexist. Since\n   many - indeed most - of the packets will only\
    \ carry a voucher, it\n   seems simplest to keep this as part of the routing tuple\
    \ (see below).\n   For the application variables, a separate tag seems sensible.\
    \ This\n   would simply contain a list of the variables.  Having two tags in\n\
    \   this way would keep separate the management of routers and meters.\n   If\
    \ the encryption/digital signature overhead of the second tag proves\n   to be\
    \ too high, it should be possible to combine this with the\n   voucher.\n   The\
    \ fine detail of this, or at least the way variables are packed\n   into the tags,\
    \ could be standardised by the Accounting Working Group\n   in due course. For\
    \ the purpose of IPng all that is required is the\n   ability to carry one or\
    \ two variable-size objects in every packet.\n"

  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n       For IPng to provide reliable transport in a hostile\
    \ environment,\n       routing and accounting information, i.e., the (source,\
    \ dest,\n       network-tag) and (application-tag) tuples, must be tamper-proof.\n\
    \       Routers and meters which need to use the tuples will need to hold\n  \
    \     appropriate keys for them. Network operators will have to plan\n       for\
    \ this, for example by determining which routers need which\n       sets of keys.\
    \ This will be neccessary in any case for reliable\n       policy-based routing,\
    \ so the extra work required to set up\n       accounting meters should be acceptable.\n"
