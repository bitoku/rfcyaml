  - "1.  Introduction\n   As documented in [RFC3345], routing information reduction\
    \ by BGP\n   Route Reflection [RFC4456] or BGP Confederation [RFC5065] can result\n\
    \   in persistent Internal BGP (IBGP) route oscillations with certain\n   routing\
    \ setups and network topologies.  Except for a couple of\n   artificially engineered\
    \ network topologies, the MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)\n   attribute [RFC4271] has played\
    \ a pivotal role in virtually all known\n   persistent IBGP route oscillations.\
    \  For the sake of brevity, we use\n   the term \"MED-induced route oscillation\"\
    \ hereafter to refer to a\n   persistent IBGP route oscillation in which the MED\
    \ plays a role.\n   In order to eliminate MED-induced route oscillations and to\
    \ achieve\n   consistent routing in a network, a route reflector or a confederation\n\
    \   Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) needs to advertise more than\n   just\
    \ the best path for an address prefix.  Our goal is to identify\n   the necessary\
    \ set of paths for an address prefix that needs to be\n   advertised by a route\
    \ reflector or a confederation ASBR to prevent\n   the condition.\n   In this\
    \ document, we describe two sets of paths for an address prefix\n   that can be\
    \ advertised by a BGP route reflector or confederation ASBR\n   to eliminate MED-induced\
    \ route oscillations in a network.  The first\n   set involves all the available\
    \ paths, and would achieve the same\n   routing consistency as the full IBGP mesh.\
    \  The second set, which is\n   a subset of the first one, involves the neighbor-AS-based\
    \ Group Best\n   Paths, and would be sufficient to eliminate MED-induced route\n\
    \   oscillations (subject to certain commonly adopted topological\n   constraints).\n\
    \   These paths can be advertised using the mechanism described in\n   ADD-PATH\
    \ [RFC7911] for advertising multiple paths.  No other\n   assumptions in functionality\
    \ beyond the base BGP specification\n   [RFC4271] are made.\n"

- title: 3.  Advertise All the Available Paths
  contents:
  - "3.  Advertise All the Available Paths\n   Observe that in a network that maintains\
    \ a full IBGP mesh, all the\n   BGP speakers have consistent and equivalent routing\
    \ information.\n   Such a network is thus free of MED-induced route oscillations\
    \ and\n   other routing inconsistencies such as forwarding loops.\n   Therefore,\
    \ one approach is to allow a route reflector or a\n   confederation ASBR to advertise\
    \ all the available paths for an\n   address prefix.  Clearly this approach would\
    \ yield the same amount of\n   routing information and achieve the same routing\
    \ consistency as the\n   full IBGP mesh in a network.  In this document, \"Available\
    \ Paths\"\n   refers to the advertisement of all the available paths.\n   This\
    \ approach can be implemented using the mechanism described in\n   ADD-PATH [RFC7911]\
    \ for advertising multiple paths for certain\n   prefixes.\n   For the sake of\
    \ scalability, the advertisement of multiple paths\n   should be limited to those\
    \ prefixes that are affected by MED-induced\n   route oscillation in a network\
    \ carrying a large number of alternate\n   paths.  A detailed description of how\
    \ these oscillations can occur\n   can be found in [RFC3345]; the description\
    \ of how a node would\n   locally detect such conditions is outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Advertise the Group Best Paths
  contents:
  - "4.  Advertise the Group Best Paths\n   The term \"neighbor-AS\" for a route refers\
    \ to the neighboring\n   autonomous system (AS) from which the route was received.\
    \  The\n   calculation of the neighbor-AS is specified in Section 9.1.2.2 of\n\
    \   [RFC4271], and Section 5.3 of [RFC5065].  By definition, the MED is\n   comparable\
    \ only among routes with the same neighbor-AS.  Thus, the\n   route selection\
    \ procedures specified in [RFC4271] would conceptually\n   involve two steps:\
    \ first, organize the paths for an address prefix\n   into groups according to\
    \ their respective neighbor-ASes, and\n   calculate the most preferred one (termed\
    \ \"Group Best Path\") for each\n   of the groups; then, calculate the overall\
    \ best path among all the\n   Group Best Paths.\n   As a practice that is generally\
    \ recommended (in [RFC4456] and\n   [RFC5065]) and widely adopted, a route reflection\
    \ cluster or a\n   confederation sub-AS should be designed such that BGP routes\
    \ from\n   within the cluster (or confederation sub-AS) are preferred over\n \
    \  routes from other clusters (or confederation sub-AS) when the\n   decision\
    \ is based on the IGP cost to the BGP NEXT_HOP.  This is\n   typically done by\
    \ setting IGP metrics for links within a cluster (or\n   confederation sub-AS)\
    \ to be much smaller than the IGP metrics for the\n   links between the clusters\
    \ (or confederation sub-AS).  This practice\n   helps achieve consistent routing\
    \ within a route reflection cluster or\n   a confederation sub-AS.\n   When the\
    \ aforementioned practice for devising a route reflection\n   cluster or confederation\
    \ sub-AS is followed in a network, we claim\n   that the advertisement of all\
    \ the Group Best Paths by a route\n   reflector or a confederation ASBR is sufficient\
    \ to eliminate\n   MED-induced route oscillations in the network.  This claim\
    \ is\n   validated in Appendix A.\n   Note that a Group Best Path for an address\
    \ prefix can be identified\n   by the combination of the address prefix and the\
    \ neighbor-AS.  Thus,\n   this approach can be implemented using the mechanism\
    \ described in\n   ADD-PATH [RFC7911] for advertising multiple paths, and in this\
    \ case,\n   the neighbor-AS of a path may be used as the path identifier of the\n\
    \   path.\n   It should be noted that the approach of advertising the Group Best\n\
    \   Paths requires certain topological constraints to be satisfied in\n   order\
    \ to eliminate MED-induced route oscillation.  Specific\n   topological considerations\
    \ are described in [RFC3345].\n"

    \ be eliminated by simple\n   configuration workarounds.  As carrying additional\
    \ paths impacts the\n   memory usage and routing convergence in a network, it\
    \ is recommended\n   that the impact be evaluated and the approach of using a\n\
    \   configuration workaround be considered in deciding whether to deploy\n   the\
    \ proposed mechanism in a network.  In addition, the advertisement\n   of multiple\
    \ paths should be limited to those prefixes that are\n   affected by MED-induced\
    \ route oscillation.\n   While the route reflectors or confederation ASBRs in\
    \ a network need\n   to advertise the Group Best Paths or Available Paths, the\
    \ vast\n   majority of the BGP speakers in the network only need to receive the\n\
    \   Group Best Paths or Available Paths, which would involve only minor\n   software\
    \ changes.\n   It should be emphasized that, in order to eliminate MED-induced\
    \ route\n   oscillations in a network using the approach of advertising the Group\n\
    \   Best Paths, the recommended practice for devising a route reflection\n   cluster\
    \ or confederation sub-AS with respect to the IGP metrics\n   ([RFC4456] [RFC5065])\
    \ should be followed.\n   It is expected that the approach of advertising the\
    \ Group Best Paths\n   would be adequate to achieve consistent routing for the\
    \ vast majority\n   of the networks.  For a network that has a large number of\
    \ alternate\n   paths, the approach should be a good choice as the number of paths\n\
    \   advertised by a reflector or a confederation ASBR is bounded by the\n   number\
    \ of the neighbor-ASes for a particular address prefix.  The\n   additional states\
    \ for an address prefix would also be per neighbor-AS\n   rather than per path.\
    \  The number of neighbor-ASes for a particular\n   address prefix is typically\
    \ small because of the limited number of\n   upstream providers for a customer\
    \ and the nature of advertising only\n   customer routes at the inter-exchange\
    \ points.\n   The approach of advertising the Group Best Paths, however, may still\n\
    \   be inadequate for certain networks to avoid other routing\n   inconsistencies\
    \ such as forwarding loops.  The required topological\n   constraints could also\
    \ be operationally challenging.  In these cases\n   the approach of advertising\
    \ the Available Paths may be used, but\n   should be limited to those prefixes\
    \ that are affected by MED-induced\n   route oscillation in a network carrying\
    \ a large number of alternate\n   paths.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Why the Group Best Paths Are Adequate
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Why the Group Best Paths Are Adequate\n   It is assumed that the\
    \ following common practice is followed.  A\n   route reflection cluster or a\
    \ confederation sub-AS should be designed\n   such that the IGP metrics for links\
    \ within a cluster (or\n   confederation sub-AS) are much smaller than the IGP\
    \ metrics for the\n   links between the clusters (or confederation sub-AS).  This\
    \ practice\n   helps achieve consistent routing within a route reflection cluster\
    \ or\n   a confederation sub-AS.\n   Observe that in a network that maintains\
    \ full IBGP mesh only, the\n   paths that survive the (Local_Pref, AS-PATH Length,\
    \ Origin, and MED)\n   comparisons [RFC4271] would contribute to route selection\
    \ in the\n   network.\n   Consider a route reflection cluster that sources one\
    \ or more paths\n   that would survive the (Local_Pref, AS-PATH Length, Origin,\
    \ and MED)\n   comparisons among all the paths in the network.  One of these\n\
    \   surviving paths would be selected as the Group Best Path by the route\n  \
    \ reflector in the cluster.  Due to the constraint on the IGP metrics\n   as described\
    \ previously, this path would remain as the Group Best\n   Path and would be advertised\
    \ to all other clusters even after a path\n   is received from another cluster.\n\
    \   On the other hand, when no path in a route reflection cluster would\n   survive\
    \ the (Local_Pref, AS-PATH Length, Origin, and MED) comparisons\n   among all\
    \ the paths in the network, the Group Best Path (when it\n   exists) for a route\
    \ reflector would be from another cluster.\n   Clearly, the advertisement of the\
    \ Group Best Path by the route\n   reflector to the clients only depends on the\
    \ paths received from\n   other clusters.\n   Therefore, there is no MED-induced\
    \ route oscillation in the network\n   as the advertisement of a Group Best Path\
    \ to a peer does not depend\n   on the paths received from that peer.\n   The\
    \ claim for the confederation can be validated similarly.\n"
