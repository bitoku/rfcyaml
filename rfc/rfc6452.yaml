    Names\n   for Applications (IDNA) derived character properties related to the\n
    \  three code points, existing in Unicode 5.2, that changed property\n   values
    when version 6.0 was released.  The consensus is that no\n   update is needed

  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specifies an algorithm that was defined
    when\n   version 5.0 (later updated to version 5.2) [Unicode5.2] was the\n   current
    version of Unicode, and it also defines a derived property\n   value based on
    that algorithm.  Unicode 6.0 [Unicode6] has changed\n   GeneralCategory of three
    code points that were allocated in\n   Unicode 5.2 or earlier.  This implies that
    the derived property value\n   differs depending on whether the property definitions
    used are from\n   Unicode 5.2 or 6.0.  These are non-backward-compatible changes
    as\n   described in Section 5.1 of RFC 5892.\n   The three code points are:\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  IETF Consensus\n   No change to RFC 5892 is needed based on the changes made
    in\n   Unicode 6.0.\n   This consensus does not imply that no changes will be
    made to\n   RFC 5892 for all future updates of The Unicode Standard.\n   This
    RFC has been produced because 6.0 is the first version of\n   Unicode to be released
    since IDNA2008 was published.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the derived property value registry
    according to\n   RFC 5892 and the property values defined in The Unicode Standard\n
    \  version 6.0.\n"
  title: 3.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   When the algorithm presented in RFC 5892 is applied
    using the\n   property definitions of Unicode Standard version 6.0, the result
    will\n   be different from when it is applied using the property definitions\n
    \  of Unicode 5.2 for the three code points discussed in this document.\n   The
    three code points are unlikely to occur in internationalized\n   domain names,
    however, so the security implications of the changes\n   are minor.\n"
