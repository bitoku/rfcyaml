    \        University of Southern California\nThe University of Southern California\
    \ Image Processing Institute in\nconjunction with the Advanced Research Projects\
    \ Agency, Information\nProcessing Techniques Office is sponsoring a technical\
    \ meeting on\ndigital image processing software systems.  The meeting will be\
    \ held at\nUSC on July 17-18, 1973.  The purpose of the meeting is to consider\
    \ the\nexisting hardware facilities and software systems suitable for large\n\
    scale image processing operations over the ARPANET.  Additionally,\npreliminary\
    \ consideration will be given to the potential development of\nuniversal image\
    \ processing software that will be of utility to the\nentire image processing\
    \ R & D community.\nRepresentatives of interested organizations are invited to\
    \ attend the\ntechnical meeting.  Attendees should contact:\n         Professor\
