Abstract This document defines managed objects which describe the behavior of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) entity.
This document obsoletes RFC 1907, Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2).
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which describe the behavior of an SNMP entity, as defined in the SNMP architecture STD 62, [RFC3411].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

The MIB module for SNMP entities.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 3418; see the RFC itself for full legal notices. "
This revision of this MIB module was published as RFC 3418."
This revision of this MIB module was published as RFC 1907."
The initial revision of this MIB module was published as RFC 1450."
"A textual description of the entity.
This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating system, and networking software."
"The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity.
This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed.
For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'."
"The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re initialized."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person.
If no contact information is known, the value is the zero length string."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
An administratively assigned name for this managed node.
By convention, this is the node's fully qualified domain name.
If the name is unknown, the value is the zero length string."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor').
If the location is unknown, the value is the zero length string."
"A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer.
The value is a sum.
This sum initially takes the value zero.
Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L 1) is added to the sum.
For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3 1)).
In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4 1)   2^(7 1)).
For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing the capabilities of the local SNMP application acting as a command responder with respect to various MIB modules.
SNMP entities having dynamically configurable support of MIB modules will have a dynamically varying number of conceptual rows."
{ system 9 } sysOREntry OBJECT
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry (conceptual row) in the sysORTable."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"A textual description of the capabilities identified by the corresponding instance of sysORID."
"The value of sysUpTime at the time this conceptual row was last instantiated."
"The total number of community based SNMP messages (for example,  SNMPv1) delivered to the SNMP entity which used an SNMP community name not known to said entity.
Also, implementations which authenticate community based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s).
It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value."
"The total number of community based SNMP messages (for example, SNMPv1) delivered to the SNMP entity which represented an SNMP operation that was not allowed for the SNMP community named in the message.
The precise conditions under which this counter is incremented (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements its access control mechanism and how its applications interact with that access control mechanism.
It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any access control mechanism which is used to control access to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value."
"Indicates whether the SNMP entity is permitted to generate authenticationFailure traps.
The value of this object overrides any configuration information; as such, it provides a means whereby all authenticationFailure traps may be disabled.
Note that it is strongly recommended that this object be stored in non volatile memory so that it remains constant across re initializations of the network management system."
"The total number of Confirmed Class PDUs (such as GetRequest PDUs, GetNextRequest PDUs, GetBulkRequest PDUs, SetRequest PDUs, and InformRequest PDUs) delivered to the SNMP entity which were silently dropped because the size of a reply containing an alternate Response Class PDU (such as a Response PDU) with an empty variable bindings field was greater than either a local constraint or the maximum message size associated with the originator of the request."
"The total number of Confirmed Class PDUs (such as GetRequest PDUs, GetNextRequest PDUs, GetBulkRequest PDUs, SetRequest PDUs, and InformRequest PDUs) delivered to the SNMP entity which were silently dropped because the transmission of the (possibly translated) message to a proxy target failed in a manner (other than a time out) such that no Response Class PDU (such as a Response PDU) could be returned."
The authoritative identification of the notification currently being sent.
This variable occurs as the second varbind in every SNMPv2
Trap PDU and InformRequest PDU."
The authoritative identification of the enterprise associated with the trap currently being sent.
When an SNMP proxy agent is mapping an RFC1157 Trap PDU into a SNMPv2 Trap PDU, this variable occurs as the last varbind."
{ snmpMIBObjects 5 } coldStart NOTIFICATION TYPE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself and that its configuration may have been altered."
A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMP entity, supporting a notification originator application, is reinitializing itself such that its configuration is unaltered."
authenticationFailure NOTIFICATION TYPE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMP entity has received a protocol message that is not properly authenticated.
While all implementations of SNMP entities MAY be capable of generating this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates whether this trap will be generated."
An advisory lock used to allow several cooperating command generator applications to coordinate their use of the SNMP set operation.
This object is used for coarse grain coordination.
To achieve fine grain coordination, one or more similar objects might be defined within each MIB group, as appropriate."

snmpOutTraps } STATUS  obsolete DESCRIPTION
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the View based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
