    flow.\n   IAC DON'T STATUS\n      Sender refuses to carry on any further discussion
    of the current\n      status of options.\n   IAC WON'T STATUS\n      Sender refuses
    to carry on any further discussion of the current\n      status of options.\n
    \  IAC SB STATUS SEND IAC SE\n      Sender requests receiver to transmit his (the
    receiver's)\n      perception of the current status of Telnet options. The code
    for\n      SEND is 1. (See below.)\n   IAC SB STATUS IS ... IAC SE\n      Sender
    is stating his perception of the current status of Telnet\n      options. The
    code for IS is 0. (See below.)\n"

  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   This option allows a user/process to verify
    the current status of\n   TELNET options (e.g., echoing) as viewed by the person/process
    on the\n   other end of the TELNET connection. Simply renegotiating options\n"
  title: 4. Motivation for the Option
- contents:
  - "5. Description of the Option\n   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant
    permission for future\n   discussion. The actual exchange of status information
    occurs within\n   option subcommands (IAC SB STATUS...).\n   Once the two hosts
    have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the\n   WILL STATUS is free to transmit
    status information, spontaneously or\n   in response to a request from the sender
    of the DO. At worst, this\n   may lead to transmitting the information twice.
    Only the sender of\n   the DO may send requests (IAC SB STATUS SEND IAC SE) and
    only the\n   sender of the WILL may transmit actual status information (within
    an\n   IAC SB STATUS IS ... IAC SE command).\n   IS has the subcommands WILL,
    DO and SB. They are used EXACTLY as used\n   during the actual negotiation of
    TELNET options, except that SB is\n   terminated with SE, rather than IAC SE.
    Transmission of SE, as a\n   regular data byte, is accomplished by doubling the
    byte (SE SE).\n   Options that are not explicitly described are assumed to be
    in their\n   default states. A single IAC SB STATUS IS ... IAC SE describes the\n
    \  condition of ALL options.\n"
