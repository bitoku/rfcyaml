    \  framework for annotating types in an ASN.1 specification with\n   encoding
    instructions [X.680-1] that alter how values of those types\n   are encoded according

    [GSER], and in particular\n   defines an encoding instruction, the CHOICE-OF-STRINGS
    encoding\n   instruction, to provide a machine-processable representation for
    the\n   declaration of a GSER ChoiceOfStrings type.\n   The CHOICE-OF-STRINGS
    encoding instruction SHOULD be used instead of\n   simply declaring a ChoiceOfStrings
    type.\n"

    \  type, and \"value\" shall be taken to mean an ASN.1 abstract value,\n   unless
    qualified otherwise.\n   A reference to an ASN.1 production [X.680] (e.g., Type,

  - "3.  Notation for GSER Encoding Instructions\n   The grammar of ASN.1 permits
    the application of encoding instructions\n   [X.680-1], through type prefixes
    and encoding control sections, that\n   modify how abstract values are encoded
    by nominated encoding rules.\n   The generic notation for type prefixes and encoding
    control sections\n   is defined by the ASN.1 basic notation [X.680] [X.680-1],
    and\n   includes an encoding reference to identify the specific encoding\n   rules
    that are affected by the encoding instruction.\n   The encoding reference that
    identifies the Generic String Encoding\n   Rules is literally GSER.\n   The specific
    notation for an encoding instruction for a particular\n   set of encoding rules
    is left to the specification of those encoding\n   rules.  Consequently, this
    companion document to the GSER\n   specification [GSER] defines the notation for
    GSER encoding\n   instructions.  Specifically, it elaborates the EncodingInstruction\n
    \  and EncodingInstructionAssignmentList placeholder productions of the\n   ASN.1
    basic notation.\n   In the context of the GSER encoding reference the EncodingInstruction\n
    \  production is defined as follows, using the conventions of the ASN.1\n   basic
    notation:\n      EncodingInstruction ::=\n          ChoiceOfStringsInstruction\n
    \  In the context of the GSER encoding reference the\n   EncodingInstructionAssignmentList
    production (which only appears in\n   an encoding control section) is empty:\n
    \     EncodingInstructionAssignmentList ::= empty\n"
  title: 3.  Notation for GSER Encoding Instructions
- contents:
  - "4.  The CHOICE-OF-STRINGS Encoding Instruction\n   The CHOICE-OF-STRINGS encoding
    instruction allows a GSER encoder to\n   encode the alternative of a CHOICE (of
    restricted string types)\n   without the leading identifier.  The optional PrecedenceList
    also\n   allows a specification writer to alter the order in which a GSER\n   decoder
    will consider the alternatives of the CHOICE as it determines\n   which alternative
    has been encoded when the identifier is absent.\n   The notation for a CHOICE-OF-STRINGS
    encoding instruction is defined\n   as follows:\n      UnionInstruction ::= \"CHOICE-OF-STRINGS\"
    AlternativesPrecedence ?\n      AlternativesPrecedence ::= \"PRECEDENCE\" PrecedenceList\n
    \     PrecedenceList ::= identifier PrecedenceList ?\n   The Type in the EncodingPrefixedType
    for a CHOICE-OF-STRINGS encoding\n   instruction SHALL be:\n   (a) a BuiltinType
    that is a ChoiceType, or\n   (b) a ConstrainedType that is not a TypeWithConstraint
    where the Type\n       in the ConstrainedType is one of (a) to (d), or\n   (c)
    a BuiltinType that is a PrefixedType that is a TaggedType where\n       the Type
    in the TaggedType is one of (a) to (d), or\n   (d) a BuiltinType that is a PrefixedType
    that is an\n       EncodingPrefixedType where the Type in the EncodingPrefixedType\n
    \      is one of (a) to (d).\n   The effect of this condition is to force the
    CHOICE-OF-STRINGS\n   encoding instruction to be textually co-located with the
    CHOICE type\n   definition to which it applies.  This makes it clear to a reader
    that\n   the encoding instruction applies to every use of the CHOICE type no\n
    \  matter how it might be referenced.\n   The ChoiceType in case (a) is said to
    be \"subject to\" the CHOICE-OF-\n   STRINGS encoding instruction.\n   The Type
    of each NamedType of the ChoiceType in case (a) MUST be:\n   (1) the NumericString,
    PrintableString, TeletexString (T61String),\n       VideotexString, IA5String,
    GraphicString, VisibleString\n       (ISO646String), GeneralString, BMPString,
    UniversalString, or\n       UTF8String type, or\n   (2) a type notation that references
    a type that is one of (1) to (4),\n       or\n   (3) a constrained type where
    the type that is constrained is one of\n       (1) to (4), or\n   (4) a prefixed
    type where the type that is prefixed is one of (1) to\n       (4).\n      ASIDE:
    A tagged type is a special case of a prefixed type.  An\n      effect of case
    (4) is that tagging is not significant.\n   The ASN.1 restricted string type in
    case (1) MUST be different for\n   each NamedType in the ChoiceType, i.e., no
    two alternatives have the\n   same restricted string type.\n   If case (3) applies
    to any NamedType, then the constraint in case (3)\n   MUST be the same for each
    NamedType, i.e., either none of the\n   alternatives has a constraint, or all
    of the alternatives have\n   exactly the same constraint.\n   Each identifier
    in the PrecedenceList MUST be the identifier of a\n   NamedType of the ChoiceType.\n
    \  A particular identifier SHALL NOT appear more than once in the same\n   PrecedenceList.\n"

    - "4.1.  Effect on GSER Encodings\n   A value of a CHOICE type is encoded according
      to the <ChoiceValue>\n   [GSER] Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF] rule.  The
      ABNF for\n   <ChoiceValue> is reproduced here for convenience:\n      ChoiceValue
      \          = IdentifiedChoiceValue /\n                              ChoiceOfStringsValue\n
      \     IdentifiedChoiceValue = identifier \":\" Value\n      ChoiceOfStringsValue
      \ = StringValue\n   The <IdentifiedChoiceValue> rule MUST be used to encode
      values of a\n   CHOICE type where the ChoiceType is not subject to a CHOICE-OF-\n
      \  STRINGS encoding instruction.\n   The chosen alternative of a value of a
      CHOICE type corresponds to\n   some NamedType in the definition of the type.
      \ The <identifier> in\n   the <IdentifiedChoiceValue> is the identifier of this
      NamedType.\n   Either the <IdentifiedChoiceValue> rule or the <ChoiceOfStringsValue>\n
      \  rule is used to encode values of a CHOICE type where the ChoiceType\n   is
      subject to a CHOICE-OF-STRINGS encoding instruction.\n   If <ChoiceOfStringsValue>
      has been used, then a GSER decoder MUST\n   determine the chosen alternative
      by considering the alternatives of\n   the CHOICE in the order prescribed below
      and accepting the first\n   alternative that allows all of the characters in
      the <StringValue>.\n   If the CHOICE-OF-STRINGS encoding instruction has a PrecedenceList,\n
      \  then the alternatives of the ChoiceType referenced by the\n   PrecedenceList
      are considered in the order identified by that\n   PrecedenceList, and then
      the remaining alternatives are considered in\n   the order of their definition
      in the ChoiceType.  If the CHOICE-OF-\n   STRINGS encoding instruction does
      not have a PrecedenceList, then all\n   the alternatives of the ChoiceType are
      considered in the order of\n   their definition in the ChoiceType.\n   A GSER
      encoder MUST use <IdentifiedChoiceValue> if a GSER decoder\n   would determine
      the chosen alternative to be something other than the\n   chosen alternative
      of the CHOICE value being encoded; otherwise,\n   <ChoiceOfStringsValue> MAY
      be used.\n   Example\n      Consider this type definition:\n         [GSER:CHOICE-OF-STRINGS
      PRECEDENCE basicName] CHOICE {\n             extendedName  UTF8String,\n             basicName
      \    PrintableString\n         }\n      If a <ChoiceOfStringsValue> has been
      used, then a GSER decoder\n      would first consider whether the <StringValue>
      was a valid\n      basicName (a PrintableString) before considering whether
      it was a\n      valid extendedName (a UTF8String).\n"

      the previous declaration [GSER] of the DirectoryString\n   type as a ChoiceOfStrings

      \     }\n   The uTF8String alternative did not appear in the second edition
      of\n   the SelectedAttributeTypes ASN.1 module of X.520 [X.520-2].  For\n   compatibility,
      applications using GSER with the second edition of\n   X.520 MUST add this encoding
      instruction:\n      [GSER:CHOICE-OF-STRINGS PRECEDENCE printableString]\n   immediately
      before the \"CHOICE\" keyword in the definition of the\n   DirectoryString type.\n
