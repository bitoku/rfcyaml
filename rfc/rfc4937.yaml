- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n   Authority (IANA) regarding the registration of values related to\
    \ the\n   PPP over Ethernet Protocol (PPPoE), defined in [RFC2516], in\n   accordance\
    \ with BCP 26, [RFC2434].  It also reserves PPPoE TAG values\n   as well as PPPoE\
    \ packet Code fields, which are or have been in use on\n   the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined\
    \ in BCP\n   26:  \"name space\", \"registration\".\n   The following policies\
    \ are used here with the meanings defined in BCP\n   26: \"First Come First Served\"\
    .\n"
- title: 1.2.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are often\
    \ capitalized.  The key\n   words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this document\n   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   The PPPoE protocol, as defined in [RFC2516], defines\
    \ two name spaces\n   that require registration, the PPPoE TAG and the PPPoE Code\
    \ field.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Registration Policies for PPPoE TAG Values
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Registration Policies for PPPoE TAG Values\n   IANA has set up a registry\
    \ of \"PPPoE TAG Values\".  These are 16-bit\n   values.  PPPoE TAG values already\
    \ in use are specified as reserved in\n   this document.  All other TAG values\
    \ between 0 and 65535 are to be\n   assigned by IANA, using the \"First Come First\
    \ Served\" policy defined\n   in [RFC2434].\n   A TAG-Name and a description for\
    \ the usage, as well as a point of\n   contact, MUST be provided for any assignment\
    \ from this registry.  A\n   document reference SHOULD also be provided.\n"
