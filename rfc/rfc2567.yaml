  - "Abstract\n   This document is one of a set of documents, which together describe\n\
    \   all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an\n   application\
    \ level protocol that can be used for distributed printing\n   using Internet\
    \ tools and technologies.  This document takes a broad\n   look at distributed\
    \ printing functionality, and it enumerates real-\n   life scenarios that help\
    \ to clarify the features that need to be\n   included in a printing protocol\
    \ for the Internet.  It identifies\n   requirements for three types of users:\
    \ end users, operators, and\n   administrators.  The design goals document calls\
    \ out a subset of end\n   user requirements that are satisfied in IPP/1.0. Operator\
    \ and\n   administrator requirements are out of scope for version 1.0.\n   The\
    \ full set of IPP documents includes:\n   Design Goals for an Internet Printing\
    \ Protocol (this document)\n   Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol\
    \ for the\n   Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2568]\n   Internet Printing Protocol/1.0:\
    \ Model and Semantics [RFC2568]\n   Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and\
    \ Transport [RFC2565]\n   Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Implementer's Guide\
    \ [ipp-iig]\n   Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]\n   The \"Rationale\
    \ for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the\n   Internet Printing Protocol\"\
    \ document describes IPP from a high level\n   view, defines a roadmap for the\
    \ various documents that form the suite\n   of IPP specifications, and gives background\
    \ and rationale for the\n   IETF working group's major decisions.\n   The \"Internet\
    \ Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics\" document\n   describes a simplified\
    \ model consisting of abstract objects, their\n   attributes, and their operations\
    \ that is independent of encoding and\n   transport.  The model consists of a\
    \ Printer and a Job object.  The\n   Job optionally supports multiple documents.\
    \  IPP 1.0 semantics allow\n   end-users and operators to query printer capabilities,\
    \ submit print\n   jobs, inquire about the status of print jobs and printers,\
    \ and cancel\n   print jobs.  This document also addresses security,\n   internationalization,\
    \ and directory issues.\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and\
    \ Transport\" document\n   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and\
    \ attributes defined\n   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1.  It defines the\
    \ encoding rules\n   for a new Internet media type called \"application/ipp\"\
    .\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Implementer's Guide\" document\n \
    \  gives insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP\n   objects.\
    \  It is intended to help them understand IPP/1.0 and some of\n   the considerations\
    \ that may assist them in the design of their client\n   and/or IPP object implementations.\
    \  For example, a typical order of\n   processing requests is given, including\
    \ error checking.  Motivation\n   for some of the specification decisions is also\
    \ included.\n   The \"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols\" document gives some\n\
    \   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer\n   Daemon)\
    \ implementations.\n"

- title: 1. INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   The IPP protocol is heavily influenced by the printing model\n\
    \   introduced in the Document Printing Application (DPA) [ISO10175]\n   standard.\
    \  Although DPA specifies both end user and administrative\n   features, IPP version\
    \ 1.0 (IPP/1.0) focuses only on end user\n   functionality.\n"
- title: 2. TERMINOLOGY
  contents:
  - "2. TERMINOLOGY\n   Internet Printing for the purposes of this document is the\n\
    \   application of Internet tools, programs, servers and networks to\n   allow\
    \ end-users to print to a remote printer using, after initial\n   setup or configuration,\
    \ the same methods, operations and paradigms as\n   would be used for a locally\
    \ attached or a local area network attached\n   printer.  This could include the\
    \ use of HTTP servers and browsers and\n   other applications for providing static,\
    \ dynamic and interactive\n   printer locating services, user installation, selection,\n\
    \   configuration, print job submission, printer capability inquiry and\n   status\
    \ inquiry of remote printers and jobs.\n   For the purposes of this document,\
    \ a WEB Browser is software\n   available from a number of sources including but\
    \ not limited to the\n   following:  Microsoft Internet Explorer, NCSA Mosaic,\
    \ Netscape\n   Navigator, Sun Hot Java!.  The major task of these products is\
    \ to use\n   the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) to retrieve, interpret and\n\
    \   display Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).  These products are often a\n  \
    \ part of a complete Internet Printing system because they are often\n   used\
    \ as a means of obtaining the status of or more information about\n   the printing\
    \ system; however, they may not be present in all\n   implementations.\n   Throughout\
    \ this document, 'printer' shall be interpreted to include\n   any device which\
    \ is capable of marking on a piece of media using any\n   available technology.\
    \  These design goals do not include support for\n   multi-tiered printing solutions\
    \ involving servers (single or\n   multiple) logically in front of the actual\
    \ printing device yet all\n   such configurations shall be supported but shall\
    \ appear to the end-\n   user as only a single device.\n   Throughout this document\
    \ 'driver' refers to the code installed in\n   some client operating system to\
    \ generate the print data stream for\n   the intended printer. Some computing\
    \ environments may not include a\n   separate printer driver.  Rather, the generation\
    \ of the proper print\n   data stream is accomplished in an application on that\
    \ computer. How\n   such a computer environment or application is updated to support\
    \ a\n   new printer now made available using IPP is outside the scope of IPP.\n\
    \   The actual details for installing a printer driver are operating\n   system\
    \ dependent and are also outside the scope of IPP. See also\n   section 4.1 (SECURITY\
    \ CONSIDERATIONS) for security implications of\n   driver download and installation.\n\
    \   The IPP protocol will support the following physical configurations:\n   -\
    \ An IPP client talking to an IPP Printer object imbedded in a\n     single, physical\
    \ output device.\n   - An IPP Client talking to a server containing one or more\
    \ IPP\n     Printer objects. Each Printer object is associated with exactly one\n\
    \     physical output device supported by the server. The protocol\n     between\
    \ the server and the output devices is undefined.\n   - An IPP Client talking\
    \ to an IPP Printer object in a server. The\n     Printer object is associated\
    \ with one or more physical output\n     devices, but the client only sees the\
    \ Printer object, which is an\n     abstraction and represents all of the associated\
    \ physical output\n     devices. The protocol between the server and the physical\
    \ output\n     devices is undefined.\n   Throughout this document, certain design\
    \ goals will be identified as\n   not being a part of version 1.0 (or V1.0) of\
    \ the protocol or as being\n   satisfied by means outside of IPP.  IPP is assumed\
    \ to be one part, an\n   enabler, of a complete Internet Printing solution.  For\
    \ example\n   printer instance creation is not performed by but is enabled by\
    \ the\n   protocol.  Globally, none of the operator or administrators wants and\n\
    \   needs are included in the design goals for version 1.0.  Some of the\n   end-user\
    \ wants and needs may also be excluded from version 1.0 and\n   will be so noted\
    \ in the description of them.  Subsequent versions of\n   the protocol (e.g. V2.0)\
    \ may include support for these initially\n   excluded wants and needs.\n"
- title: 3. DESIGN GOALS
  contents:
  - "3. DESIGN GOALS\n   The next three sections identify the design goals for an\
    \ Internet\n   printing protocol from three roles assumed by humans: end-user,\n\
    \   operator, and administrator.  The goals defined here are only those\n   that\
    \ need to be addressed by an Internet printing protocol.  Other\n   wants and\
    \ needs, such as that the operator needs physical access to\n   the printer (e.g.\
    \ to be able to load paper or clear jams) are not\n   covered by this document.\
    \  Section 5 contains scenarios which provide\n   more detailed examples of the\
    \ entire process including discovery,\n   status, printing and end-of-job reporting.\n"
- title: 3.1. END-USER
  contents:
  - "3.1. END-USER\n   An end-user of a printer accepting jobs through the Internet\
    \ is one\n   of the roles in which humans act.  The end-user is the person that\n\
    \   will submit a job to be printed on the printer.\n   The wants and needs of\
    \ the end-user are broken down into six\n   categories: finding/locating a printer,\
    \ creating a local instance of\n   a printer, viewing printer status, viewing\
    \ printer capabilities,\n   submitting a print job, viewing print job status,\
    \ altering the\n   attributes of a print job.\n"
- title: 3.1.1. Finding or locating a printer.
  contents:
  - "3.1.1. Finding or locating a printer.\n   End-users want to be able to find and\
    \ locate printers to which they\n   are authorized to print.  They want to be\
    \ able to perform this\n   function using a standard WEB browser or other application.\
    \  Multiple\n   criteria can be applied to find the printers needed.  These criteria\n\
    \   include but are not limited to:\n   - by name (Printer 1, Joes-color-printer,\
    \ etc.)\n   - by geographic location (bldg 1, Kentucky, etc.)\n   - by capability\
    \ or attribute (color, duplex, legal paper, etc.)\n   Additionally, while it is\
    \ outside of scope of IPP, end-users want to\n   be able to limit the scope of\
    \ their searching to:\n   - inside a functional sub-domain\n   - include only\
    \ a particular domain (lexmark.com)\n   - exclude specified domains\n   While\
    \ an Internet printing protocol may not of itself include this\n   function, IPP\
    \ must define and enable a directory schema which will\n   provide the necessary\
    \ information for a directory service\n   implementation to consistently represent\
    \ printers by their IPP\n   attributes.\n"
- title: 3.1.2. Create an instance of the printer.
  contents:
  - "3.1.2. Create an instance of the printer.\n   After finding the desired printer,\
    \ an end-user needs to be able to\n   create a local instance of that printer\
    \ within the end-user operating\n   system or desktop.  This local instance will\
    \ vary depending upon the\n   printing paradigm of the operating system.  For\
    \ example, some UNIX\n   users will only want a queue or a reference to a remote\
    \ printer\n   created on their machine while other UNIX users and Windows NT users\n\
    \   will want the queue and also the necessary icons and registry entries\n  \
    \ to be created and initialized.  Where required, drivers may need to\n   be downloaded\
    \ from some repository and installed on the computer.\n   All necessary decompressing,\
    \ unpacking, and other installation\n   actions should occur without end-user\
    \ interaction or intervention\n   excepting initial approval by the end-user.\
    \  Once the local instance\n   of the printer has been installed, it shall appear\
    \ to the end-user of\n   the operating system and to the applications running\
    \ there as any\n   other printer (local, local area network connected, or network\n\
    \   operating system connected) on the end-user desktop or environment.\n   IPP's\
    \ role in this goal is simply to enable the creation of the\n   printer instance\
    \ providing information such as where to locate a\n   printer driver for this\
    \ printer, as an attribute of an IPP Printer.\n"
- title: 3.1.3. Viewing the status and capabilities of a printer.
  contents:
  - "3.1.3. Viewing the status and capabilities of a printer.\n   Before using a selected\
    \ printer or, in fact at any time, the end-user\n   needs the ability to verify\
    \ the characteristics and status of both\n   printers and jobs queued for that\
    \ printer.  When checking the\n   characteristics of a printer, the end-user typically\
    \ wants to be able\n   to determine the capability of the device, e.g.:\n   -\
    \ supported media, commonly paper, by size and type\n   - paper handling capability,\
    \ e.g. duplex, collating, finishing\n   - color capability\n   When checking the\
    \ status of the printer and its print jobs, the end-\n   user typically wants\
    \ to be able to determine:\n   - is the printer on-line?\n   - what are the defaults\
    \ to be used for printing?\n   - how many jobs are queued for the printer?\n \
    \  - how are job priorities assigned? (outside the scope of IPP)\n"
- title: 3.1.4. Submitting a print job.
  contents:
  - "3.1.4. Submitting a print job.\n   Once the desired printer has been located\
    \ and installed, the end-user\n   wants to print to that printer from normal applications\
    \ using\n   standard methods.  These normal applications include such programs\
    \ as\n   word processors, spreadsheets, data-base applications, WEB browsers,\n\
    \   production printing applications, etc.  Additionally, the end-user\n   may\
    \ want to print a file already existing on the end-user's computer\n   -- \"simple\
    \ push\".  In addition to printing from an application and\n   simple push, the\
    \ end-user needs to have the ability to submit a print\n   job by reference. \
    \ Printing by reference is defined to mean as\n   submitting a job by providing\
    \ a reference to an existing document.\n   The reference, a URI, will be resolved\
    \ before the actual print\n   process occurs.  Submitting a job by reference relieves\
    \ the user from\n   downloading the document from the remote server and then sending\
    \ it\n   via IPP to the printer.  This saves both time and network bandwidth.\n\
    \   Some means shall be provided to determine if the format of a job\n   matches\
    \ the capability of the printer.  This can be done by one of\n   the following\
    \ (all of which are outside of scope of the IPP\n   protocol):\n      - the end-user\
    \ selects the correct printer driver\n      - the printer automatically selects\
    \ the proper interpreter\n      - the end-user uses some other manual procedure.\n\
    \   A standard action shall be defined should the job's requirements not\n   match\
    \ the capabilities of the printer.\n   Because the end-user does not want to know\
    \ the details of the\n   underlying printing process, the protocol must support\
    \ job-to-printer\n   capability matching (all implementations are not necessarily\
    \ required\n   to implement this function.)  This matching capability requires\n\
    \   knowing both the printer's capabilities and attributes and those\n   capabilities\
    \ and attributes required by the job.  Actions taken when\n   a print job requires\
    \ capabilities or attributes that are not\n   available on the printer vary and\
    \ can include but are not limited to:\n   - rejecting the print job\n   - redirecting\
    \ the print job to another printer (Not in V1.0)\n   - printing the job, accepting\
    \ differences in the appearance\n   Print jobs will also be submitted by background\
    \ or batch applications\n   without human intervention.\n   End-users need the\
    \ ability to set certain print job parameters at the\n   time the job is submitted.\
    \  These parameters include but are not\n   limited to:\n   - number of copies\n\
    \   - single or two sided printing\n   - finishing\n   - job priority\n"
- title: 3.1.5. Viewing the status of a submitted print job.
  contents:
  - "3.1.5. Viewing the status of a submitted print job.\n   After a job has been\
    \ submitted to a printer, the end-user needs a way\n   to view the status of that\
    \ job (i.e. job waiting, job printing, job\n   done) and to determine where the\
    \ job is in the print queue.\n   In addition to the need to inquire about the\
    \ status of a print job,\n   automatic notification of the completion of that\
    \ job is also\n   required.\n   Notification means are not defined by the protocol\
    \ but the protocol\n   must provide a means of enabling and disabling the notification.\n"
- title: 3.1.6. Canceling a Print Job
  contents:
  - "3.1.6. Canceling a Print Job\n   While a job is waiting to be printed or has\
    \ been started but not yet\n   completed, the original creator/submitter of the\
    \ print job (i.e. the\n   end-user) shall be able to cancel the job entirely (job\
    \ is waiting)\n   or the remaining portion of it (job is printing.)  Altering\
    \ the print\n   job itself is not a V1.0 design goal.\n"
- title: 3.2. OPERATOR (NOT REQUIRED FOR V1.0)
  contents:
  - "3.2. OPERATOR (NOT REQUIRED FOR V1.0)\n   An operator of a printer accepting\
    \ jobs through the Internet is one\n   of the roles in which humans act.  The\
    \ operator has the\n   responsibility of monitoring the status of the printer\
    \ as well as\n   managing and controlling the jobs at the device.  These\n   responsibilities\
    \ include but are not limited to the replenishing of\n   supplies (ink, toner,\
    \ paper, etc.), the clearing of minor errors\n   (paper jams, etc.) and the re-prioritization\
    \ of end-user jobs.\n   Operator wants and needs will not be addressed by V1.0\
    \ of the\n   protocol.\n   The wants and needs of the operator include all those\
    \ of the end-user\n   but may include additional privileges.  For example, an\
    \ operator may\n   be able to view all print jobs on a printer while the end-user\
    \ might\n   only be able to see his own jobs.\n"
- title: 3.2.1. Alerting.
  contents:
  - "3.2.1. Alerting.\n   One of the required operator functions is having the ability\
    \ to\n   discover or to be alerted to changes in the status of a printer\n   particularly\
    \ those changes that cause a printer to stop printing and\n   to be able to correct\
    \ those problems.  As such, an Internet printing\n   protocol shall be able to\

    \ and needs of the administrator include all those of the\n   end-user and, in\
    \ some environments, some or all of those of the\n   operator.  Minimally, the\
    \ administrator must also have the tools,\n   programs, utilities and supporting\
    \ protocols available to be able to:\n   - create an instance of a printer\n \
    \  - create, edit and maintain the list of authorized end-users\n   - create,\

- title: 4. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "4. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROTOCOL\n   The protocol to be defined by an Internet printing\
    \ working group will\n   address the wants and needs of the end-user (V1.0). \
    \ It will not, at\n   least initially, address the operator or administrator wants\
    \ and\n   needs (V2.0).\n   The protocol defined shall be independent of the operating\
    \ system of\n   both the client and the server.  Generally, any platform capable\
    \ of\n   supporting a WEB Browser should be capable of being a client.\n   Generally,\
    \ any platform providing a WEB/HTTP server and printing\n   services should be\
    \ capable of being a server.  Usage of the WEB\n   Browser and Server is not required\
    \ for IPP; the operating system,\n   operating system extensions or other applications\
    \ may provide IPP\n   functionality directly.\n   In many environments such as\
    \ Windows 95, Windows NT and OS/2, the\n   print data is created and transmitted\
    \ to the printer on the fly\n   rather than being created, spooled and then transmitted\
    \ to the\n   printer (a typical UNIX method.)  The Internet Printing Protocol\
    \ must\n   properly handle either methodology and make this transparent to the\n\
    \   end-user.\n"
- title: 4.1. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  contents:
  - "4.1. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n   It is required that the Internet Printing Protocol\
    \ be able to operate\n   within a secure environment. Wherever reasonable, IPP\
    \ ought to make\n   use of existing security protocols and services. IPP will\
    \ not invent\n   new security features when the design goals described in this\n\
    \   document can be met by existing protocols and services. Examples of\n   such\
    \ services include Secure Socket Layer Version 3 (SSL3) [SSL] and\n   HTTP Digest\
    \ Access Authentication [RFC2069].  Note: SSL3 is not on\n   the IETF standards\
    \ track.\n   Since we cannot anticipate the security levels or the specific\n\
    \   threats that any given IPP print administrator may be concerned with,\n  \
    \ IPP must be capable of operating with different security mechanisms\n   and\
    \ policies as required by the individual installation. The initial\n   security\
    \ needs of IPP are derived from two primary considerations.\n   First, the printing\
    \ environments described in this document take into\n   account that the client,\
    \ the Printer, and the document to be printed\n   may each exist in different\
    \ security domains. When objects are in\n   different security domains the design\
    \ goals for authentication and\n   message protection may be much stronger than\
    \ when they are all in the\n   same domain.\n   Secondly, the sensitivity and\
    \ value of the content being printed will\n   vary from one instance of a print\
    \ job to another. For example, a\n   publicly available document does not need\
    \ the same level of\n   protection as a payroll document does.  Message protection\
    \ design\n   goals include data origin authentication, privacy, integrity, and\n\
    \   non-repudiation.\n   In many environments (e.g. Windows, OS/2) a printer driver\
    \ may be\n   needed to create the proper datastream for printer.  This document\n\
    \   discusses downloading such a new driver from a variety of sources.\n   Downloading\
    \ and installing any software, including drivers) on a\n   computer exposes that\
    \ computer to a number of security risks\n   including but not limited to:\n \
    \     - defective software\n      - malicious software (e.g. Trojan horses)\n\
    \      - inappropriate software (i.e. software doing something\n        deemed\
    \ unreasonable by the user.)\n   As such, proper security considerations and actions\
    \ need to be taken\n   by the user and/or a system administrator to prevent the\
    \ compromising\n   of the computer.  Administrators should configure downloading\n\
    \   mechanism for printer drivers in such a way as to be able to verify\n   the\
    \ source of driver software and encrypt or otherwise protect that\n   software\
    \ during download.\n   Examples including security considerations can be found\
    \ in sections 5\n   (IPP SCENARIOS) and 10 (APPENDIX - DETAILED SCENARIOS) later\
    \ in this\n   document.\n"
