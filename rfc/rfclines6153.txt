Abstract This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) options to enable a mobile node to discover Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) entities in an IP network.
ANDSF is being developed in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and provides inter system mobility policies and access network specific information to the mobile nodes (MNs).
Introduction Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is being defined in 3GPP [3GPPTS23.402] to provide necessary network discovery and selection assistance data to the mobile nodes for multi access network scenarios where 3GPP access network level solutions are not sufficient for the mobile nodes to perform network discovery and selection of non 3GPP networks.
The information provided by ANDSF contains inter system mobility policies and access network specific data to assist the mobile node with performing the inter system handover.
This set of information can either be provisioned in the mobile node by the home operator or provided to the mobile node (MN) dynamically by the ANDSF over the S14 reference point as defined in [3GPPTS23.402] and [3GPPTS24.302].
In 3GPP, the ANDSF is located either in the subscriber's home operator or visited network and needs to be known to the MN or discovered by the MN.
According to [3GPPTS23.402] and [3GPPTS24.302], the ANDSF is discovered through interaction with the Domain Name Service function or the DHCP server function.
This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options called the ANDSF IP Address Options, which allow the MN to locate an ANDSF server.

ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for
DHCPv4 This section describes the ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4.
Length Length (in bytes) of the option excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' fields; 'Length' field is set to 4N, where N is the number of IPv4 addresses carried in the option IP Address IPv4 address(es) of ANDSF server(s)
ANDSF servers MUST be listed in order of preference, and the client SHOULD process them in decreasing order of preference.
ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6
This section describes the ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6.
All values in the option are represented in network byte order.
Length Length (in bytes) of the option excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Length' fields; 'Length' field is set to 16N, where N is the number of IPv6 addresses carried in the option IP Address IPv6 address(es) of
ANDSF servers MUST be listed in order of preference, and the client SHOULD process them in decreasing order of preference.
Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv4 The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv4 options follow the rules for DHCP options in [RFC2131].
The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server either during initial association with a network or when the policy and access network information is required from ANDSF.
It MAY also request the IP address of an ANDSF server when the network information is outdated or the mobile node does not have any ANDSF information.
In order to request an address of a ANDSF server, the mobile node (DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv4 Address Option in the Parameter Request List (PRL) in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].
The DHCP client MAY initiate a new DHCP exchange or piggyback on other DHCP message exchanges.
DHCP client handling PRL options are specified in [RFC2131], Section 4.4.
Usage of ANDSF Options for DHCPv6
The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCPv6 options follow the rules for DHCP options in [RFC3315].
The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an ANDSF server according to the scenarios described in Section 4.1.1.
In order to discover the address of an ANDSF server, the mobile node (DHCP client) MUST include an ANDSF IPv6 Address Option in the Option Request Option (ORO) in the respective DHCP messages as defined in [RFC3315].
The DHCP client MAY initiate a new DHCP exchange or piggyback on other DHCP message exchanges.
DHCP client handling ORO options are specified in [RFC3315], Sections 17.1 and 18.1.
If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own response, an MN could be led to contact a rogue ANDSF server.
A modified response could also be used to mount an amplification attack.
The DHCP authentication option described in [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] MAY be used to mitigate the above attacks.
In deployments where DHCP authentication is not available, 3GPP specific lower layer security services can be used to protect DHCP messages [3GPPTS33.402].
The 3GPP ANDSF framework also provides additional mechanisms that can be used to mitigate the above attacks and to protect message exchanges between an ANDSF client and server at the higher layer [3GPPTS33.402].
This document defines two new DHCP options as described in Sections 2 and 3: ANDSF IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4 (OPTION IPv4 Address ANDSF)
142 ANDSF IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6
