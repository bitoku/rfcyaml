- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) defined in [RFC5654]\
    \ is a\n   profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks.  The\n\
    \   MPLS-TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and\n   Management\
    \ (OAM) tools defined by the IETF [RFC6669] that are used to\n   meet the OAM\
    \ functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].\n   ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1]\
    \ documents MPLS-TP OAM.  This\n   Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as\
    \ documented in [Y.1731].\n   The messages in [G.8113.1] are defined to be carried\
    \ in a new Generic\n   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type in the MPLS Generic Associated\n\
    \   Channel.  In order to carry these messages in an interoperable\n   fashion,\
    \ a Generic Associated Channel Type from the IANA maintained\n   registry \"Pseudowire\
    \ Associated Channel Types\" is to be used.\n   To fulfill the request from ITU-T\
    \ SG15 in [LS370] and to allow\n   deployment of the [G.8113.1] OAM solution without\
    \ using an\n   experimental G-ACh Type, IANA has assigned a G-ACh Type <0x8902>\
    \ for\n   use by the ITU-T for [G.8113.1].  This G-ACh Type is known as the\n\
    \   \"G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type\".\n   A number of experts in the IETF do not consider\
    \ that the development\n   or deployment of a second protocol solution within\
    \ the same\n   architectural problem space is necessary or advisable [RFC6670].\n"

- title: 3.  Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type\n   The G-ACh Type assigned by this\
    \ document MUST only be used for OAM\n   messages, as defined in the ITU-T Recommendation\
    \ [G.8113.1], carried\n   in the G-ACh.  The OAM messages and procedures carried\
    \ behind this\n   G-ACh Type are restricted to only those that address the OAM\n\
    \   functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].  Other message types\n   MUST\
    \ NOT be carried behind this G-ACh Type.\n   All ITU-T Recommendations are subject\
    \ to updates by errata,\n   corrigenda, amendments, or complete revisions.  In\
    \ any update of\n   [G.8113.1], the G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST\
    \ NOT be used\n   for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements\
    \ in\n   [RFC5860].  An update of [G.8113.1] may use the G-ACh Type assigned\n\
    \   by this document to support the OAM functions identified in\n   [RFC5860].\
    \  When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is\n   approved, the reference\
    \ to [G.8113.1], provided in this document,\n   should be updated to show the\
    \ approval date of the new version.\n   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document\
    \ may be used on any transport\n   construct that uses the G-ACh, e.g., MPLS-TP\
    \ Sections, MPLS-TP LSPs,\n   or PWs as described in [G.8113.1].\n"

    \ defined, the\n   \"security considerations MUST be described in the relevant\
    \ associated\n   channel type specification\".  The IETF takes this opportunity\
