  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document presents terminology to be used for documents\
    \ and\n   discussions within the Seamoby Working Group.  Other mobility related\n\
    \   working groups could take advantage of this terminology, in order to\n   create\
    \ a common terminology for the area of mobility in IP networks.\n   Some terms\
    \ and their definitions that are not directly related to the\n   IP world are\
    \ included for the purpose of harmonizing the terminology.\n   For example, 'Access\
    \ Point' and 'base station' refer to the same\n   component, from the point of\
    \ view of IP, but 'Access Router' has a\n   very different meaning.  The presented\
    \ terminology may also, it is\n   hoped, be adequate to cover mobile ad-hoc networks.\n\
    \   The proposed terminology is not meant to assert any new terminology.\n   Rather\
    \ the authors would welcome discussion on more exact definitions\n   as well as\
    \ missing or unnecessary terms.  This work is a\n   collaborative enterprise between\
    \ people from many different\n   engineering backgrounds and so already presents\
    \ a first step in\n   harmonizing the terminology.\n   The terminology in this\
    \ document is divided into several sections.\n   First, there is a list of terms\
    \ for general use and mobile access\n   networks followed by terms related to\
    \ handovers, and finally some\n   terms used within the MANET and NEMO working\
    \ groups.\n"
- title: 2.  General Terms
  contents:
  - "2.  General Terms\n   Bandwidth\n      The total width of the frequency band\
    \ available to or used by a\n      communications channel.  Usually measured in\
    \ Hertz (Hz).  The\n      bandwidth of a channel limits the available channel\
    \ capacity.\n   Bandwidth utilization\n      The actual rate of information transfer\
    \ achieved over a link,\n      expressed as a percentage of the theoretical maximum\
    \ channel\n      capacity on that link, according to Shannon's Law.\n   Beacon\n\
    \      A control message broadcast by a node (especially, a base station)\n  \
    \    informing all the other nodes in its neighborhood of the\n      continuing\
    \ presence of the broadcasting node, possibly along with\n      additional status\
    \ or configuration information.\n   Binding Update (BU)\n      A message indicating\
    \ a mobile node's current mobility binding, and\n      in particular its care-of\
    \ address.\n   Care-of-Address (CoA)\n      An IP address associated with a mobile\
    \ node while visiting a\n      foreign link; the subnet prefix of this IP address\
    \ is a foreign\n      subnet prefix.  A packet addressed to the mobile node which\n\
    \      arrives at the mobile node's home network when the mobile node is\n   \
    \   away from home and has registered a Care-of Address will be\n      forwarded\
    \ to that address by the Home Agent in the home network.\n   Channel\n      A\
    \ subdivision of the physical medium allowing possibly shared\n      independent\
    \ uses of the medium.  Channels may be made available by\n      subdividing the\
    \ medium into distinct time slots, or distinct\n      spectral bands, or decorrelated\
    \ coding sequences.\n   Channel access protocol\n      A protocol for mediating\
    \ access to, and possibly allocation of,\n      the various channels available\
    \ within the physical communications\n      medium.  Nodes participating in the\
    \ channel access protocol agree\n      to communicate only when they have uncontested\
    \ access to one of\n      the channels, so that there will be no interference.\n\
    \   Channel capacity\n      The total capacity of a link to carry information\
    \ (typically bits)\n      per unit time.  With a given bandwidth, the theoretical\
    \ maximum\n      channel capacity is given by Shannon's Law.  The actual channel\n\
    \      capacity of a channel is determined by the channel bandwidth, the\n   \
    \   coding system used, and the signal to noise ratio.\n   Control message\n \
    \     Information passed between two or more network nodes for\n      maintaining\
    \ protocol state, which may be unrelated to any specific\n      application.\n\
    \   Distance vector\n      A characteristic of some routing protocols in which,\
    \ for each\n      desired destination, a node maintains information about the\n\
    \      distance to that destination, and a vector (next hop) towards that\n  \
    \    destination.\n   Fairness\n      A property of channel access protocols whereby\
    \ a medium is made\n      fairly available to all eligible nodes on the link.\
    \  Fairness does\n      not strictly imply equality, especially in cases where\
    \ nodes are\n      given link access according to unequal priority or classification.\n\
    \   Flooding\n      The process of delivering data or control messages to every\
    \ node\n      within the network under consideration.\n   Foreign subnet prefix\n\
    \      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP\n  \
    \    address which identifies a node's foreign link within the Internet\n    \
    \  topology.\n   Forwarding node\n      A node which performs the function of\
    \ forwarding datagrams from\n      one of its neighbors to another.\n   Home Address\
    \ (HoA)\n      An IP address assigned to a mobile node, used as the permanent\n\
    \      address of the mobile node.  This address is within the mobile\n      node's\
    \ home link.  Standard IP routing mechanisms will deliver\n      packets destined\
    \ for a mobile node's home address to its home link\n      [9].\n   Home Agent\
    \ (HA)\n      A router on a mobile node's home link with which the mobile node\n\
    \      has registered its current care-of address.  While the mobile node\n  \
    \    is away from home, the home agent intercepts packets on the home\n      link\
    \ destined to the mobile node's home address, encapsulates\n      them, and tunnels\
    \ them to the mobile node's registered care-of\n      address.\n   Home subnet\
    \ prefix\n      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an\
    \ IP\n      address which identifies a node's home link within the Internet\n\
    \      topology (i.e., the IP subnet prefix corresponding to the mobile\n    \
    \  node's home address, as defined in [9]).\n   Interface\n      A node's point\
    \ of attachment to a link.\n   IP access address\n      An IP address (often dynamically\
    \ allocated) which a node uses to\n      designate its current point of attachment\
    \ to the local network.\n      The IP access address is typically to be distinguished\
    \ from the\n      mobile node's home address; in fact, while visiting a foreign\n\
    \      network the IP access address may be considered unsuitable for use\n  \
    \    as an end-point address by any but the most short-lived\n      applications.\
    \  Instead, the IP access address is typically used as\n      the care-of address\
    \ of the node.\n   Link\n      A communication facility or physical medium that\
    \ can sustain data\n      communications between multiple network nodes, such\
    \ as an Ethernet\n      (simple or bridged).  A link is the layer immediately\
    \ below IP.\n      In a layered network stack model, the Link Layer (Layer 2)\
    \ is\n      normally below the Network (IP) Layer (Layer 3), and above the\n \
    \     Physical Layer (Layer 1).\n   Asymmetric link\n      A link with transmission\
    \ characteristics which are different\n      depending upon the relative position\
    \ or design characteristics of\n      the transmitter and the receiver of data\
    \ on the link.  For\n      instance, the range of one transmitter may be much\
    \ higher than the\n      range of another transmitter on the same medium.\n  \
    \ Link establishment\n      The process of establishing a link between the mobile\
    \ node and the\n      local network.  This may involve allocating a channel, or\
    \ other\n      local wireless resources, possibly including a minimum level of\n\
    \      service or bandwidth.\n   Link-layer trigger (L2 Trigger)\n      Information\
    \ from the link layer that informs the network layer of\n      the detailed events\
    \ involved in handover sequencing at the link\n      layer.  L2 triggers are not\
    \ specific to any particular link layer,\n      but rather represent generalizations\
    \ of link layer information\n      available from a wide variety of link layer\
    \ protocols [4].\n   Link state\n      A characterization of some routing protocols\
    \ in which every node\n      within the network is expected to maintain information\
    \ about every\n      link within the network topology.\n   Link-level acknowledgment\n\
    \      A protocol strategy, typically employed over wireless media,\n      requiring\
    \ neighbors to acknowledge receipt of packets (typically\n      unicast only)\
    \ from the transmitter.  Such strategies aim to avoid\n      packet loss or delay\
    \ resulting from lack of, or unwanted\n      characteristics of, higher level\
    \ protocols.  Link-layer\n      acknowledgments are often used as part of Automatic\
    \ Repeat-Request\n      (ARQ) algorithms for increasing link reliability.\n  \
    \ Local broadcast\n      The delivery of data to every node within range of the\n\
    \      transmitter.\n   Loop-free\n      A property of routing protocols whereby\
    \ the path taken by a data\n      packet from source to destination never traverses\
    \ through the same\n      intermediate node twice before arrival at the destination.\n\
    \   Medium Access Protocol (MAC)\n      A protocol for mediating access to, and\
    \ possibly allocation of,\n      the physical communications medium.  Nodes participating\
    \ in the\n      medium access protocol can communicate only when they have\n \
    \     uncontested access to the medium, so that there will be no\n      interference.\
    \  When the physical medium is a radio channel, the\n      MAC is the same as\
    \ the Channel Access Protocol.\n   Mobile network prefix\n      A bit string that\
    \ consists of some number of initial bits of an IP\n      address which identifies\
    \ the entire mobile network within the\n      Internet topology.  All nodes in\
    \ a mobile network necessarily have\n      an address containing this prefix.\n\
    \   Mobility factor\n      The relative frequency of node movement, compared to\
    \ the frequency\n      of application initiation.\n   Multipoint relay (MPR)\n\
    \      A node which is selected by its one-hop neighbor to re-transmit\n     \
    \ all broadcast messages that it receives.  The message must be new\n      and\
    \ the time-to-live field of the message must be greater than\n      one.  Multipoint\
    \ relaying is a technique to reduce the number of\n      redundant re-transmissions\
    \ while diffusing a broadcast message in\n      the network.\n   Neighbor\n  \
    \    A \"neighbor\" is any other node to which data may be propagated\n      directly\
    \ over the communications medium without relying on the\n      assistance of any\
    \ other forwarding node.\n   Neighborhood\n      All the nodes which can receive\
    \ data on the same link from one\n      node whenever it transmits data.\n   Next\
    \ hop\n      A neighbor which has been selected to forward packets along the\n\
    \      way to a particular destination.\n   Payload\n      The actual data within\
    \ a packet, not including network protocol\n      headers which were not inserted\
    \ by an application.  Note that\n      payloads are different between layers:\
    \  application data is the\n      payload of TCP, which are the payload of IP,\
    \ which three are the\n      payload of link layer protocols etc.  Thus, it is\
    \ important to\n      identify the scope when talking about payloads.\n   Prefix\n\
    \      A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an\n     \
    \ address.\n   Routing table\n      The table where forwarding nodes keep information\
    \ (including next\n      hop) for various destinations.\n   Route entry\n    \
    \  An entry for a specific destination (unicast or multicast) in the\n      routing\
    \ table.\n   Route establishment\n      The process of determining a route between\
    \ a source and a\n      destination.\n   Route activation\n      The process of\
    \ putting a route into use after it has been\n      determined.\n   Routing proxy\n\
    \      A node that routes packets by overlays, e.g., by tunneling,\n      between\
    \ communicating partners.  The Home Agent and Foreign Agent\n      are examples\
    \ of routing proxies, in that they receive packets\n      destined for the mobile\
    \ node and tunnel them to the current\n      address of the mobile node.\n   Shannon's\
    \ Law\n      A statement defining the theoretical maximum rate at which error-\n\
    \      free digits can be transmitted over a bandwidth-limited channel in\n  \
    \    the presence of noise.  No practical error correction coding\n      system\
    \ exists that can closely approach the theoretical\n      performance limit given\
    \ by Shannon's law.\n   Signal strength\n      The detectable power of the signal\
    \ carrying the data bits, as seen\n      by the receiver of the signal.\n   Source\
    \ route\n      A source route from node A to node B is an ordered list of IP\n\
    \      addresses, starting with the IP address of node A and ending with\n   \
    \   the IP address of the node B.  Between A and B, the source route\n      includes\
    \ an ordered list of intermediate hops between A and B, as\n      well as the\
    \ interface index of the interface through which the\n      packet should be transmitted\
    \ to reach the next hop.  The list of\n      intermediate hops might not include\

    \      Same as flooding, but used in contrast to local broadcast.\n   Subnet\n\
    \      A subnet is a logical group of connected network nodes.  In IP\n      networks,\

  - "3.  Mobile Access Networks and Mobile Networks\n   In order to support host mobility\
    \ a set of nodes towards the network\n   edge may need to have specific functions.\
    \  Such a set of nodes forms\n   a mobile access network that may or may not be\
    \ part of the global\n   Internet.  Figure 1 presents two examples of such access\
    \ network\n   topologies.  The figure depicts a reference architecture which\n\
    \   illustrates an IP network with components defined in this section.\n   We\
    \ intend to define the concept of the Access Network (AN) which may\n   also support\
    \ enhanced mobility.  It is possible that to support\n   routing and QoS for mobile\
    \ nodes, existing routing protocols (e.g.,\n   Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)\
    \ [14]) may not be appropriate to\n   maintain forwarding information for these\
    \ mobile nodes as they change\n   their points of attachment to the Access Network.\
    \  These new\n   functions are implemented in routers with additional capabilities.\n\
    \   We can distinguish three types of Access Network components: Access\n   Routers\
    \ (AR) which handle the last hop to the mobile, typically over\n   a wireless\
    \ link; Access Network Gateways (ANG) which form the\n   boundary on the fixed\
    \ network side and shield the fixed network from\n   the specialized routing protocols;\
    \ and (optionally) other internal\n   Access Network Routers which may also be\
    \ needed in some cases to\n   support the functions.  The Access Network consists\
    \ of the equipment\n   needed to support this specialized routing, i.e., AR or\
    \ ANG.  AR and\n   ANG may be the same physical nodes.\n   In addition, we present\
    \ a few basic terms on mobile networks, that\n   is, mobile network, mobile router\
    \ (MR), and mobile network node\n   (MNN).  More terminology for discussing mobile\
    \ networks can be found\n   in [13].  A more thorough discussion of mobile networks\
    \ can be found\n   in the working group documents of the NEMO Working Group.\n\
    \   Note: this reference architecture is not well suited for people\n   dealing\
    \ with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET).\n                                     \

    \      functionality) or a Mobile Router (forwarding functionality).\n   Mobile\
    \ Host (MH)\n      A mobile node that is an end host and not a router.  A Mobile\
    \ Host\n      is capable of sending and receiving packets, that is, being a\n\
    \      source or destination of traffic, but not a forwarder of it.\n   Fixed\
    \ Node (FN)\n      A node, either a host or a router, unable to change its point\
    \ of\n      attachment to the network and its IP address without breaking open\n\
    \      sessions.\n   Mobile network\n      An entire network, moving as a unit,\
    \ which dynamically changes its\n      point of attachment to the Internet and\
    \ thus its reachability in\n      the topology.  The mobile network is composed\
    \ of one or more IP-\n      subnets and is connected to the global Internet via\
    \ one or more\n      Mobile Routers (MR).  The internal configuration of the mobile\n\
    \      network is assumed to be relatively stable with respect to the MR.\n  \
    \ Mobile Router (MR)\n      A router capable of changing its point of attachment\
    \ to the\n      network, moving from one link to another link.  The MR is capable\n\
    \      of forwarding packets between two or more interfaces, and possibly\n  \
    \    running a dynamic routing protocol modifying the state by which it\n    \
    \  does packet forwarding.\n      A MR acting as a gateway between an entire mobile\
    \ network and the\n      rest of the Internet has one or more egress interface(s)\
    \  and one\n      or more ingress interface(s).  Packets forwarded upstream to\
    \ the\n      rest of the Internet are transmitted through one of the MR's\n  \
    \    egress interface; packets forwarded downstream to the mobile\n      network\
    \ are transmitted through one of the MR's ingress interface.\n   Ingress interface\n\
    \      The interface of a MR attached to a link inside the mobile\n      network.\n\
    \   Egress interface\n      The interface of a MR attached to the home link if\

    \ the Mobile\n      Node can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer\n\
    \      immediately below IP.\n   Access Point (AP)\n      An Access Point is a\
    \ layer 2 device which is connected to one or\n      more Access Routers and offers\
    \ the wireless link connection to the\n      Mobile Node.  Access Points are sometimes\
    \ called base stations or\n      access point transceivers.  An Access Point may\
    \ be a separate\n      entity or co-located with an Access Router.\n   Radio Cell\n\
    \      The geographical area within which an Access Point provides radio\n   \
    \   coverage, i.e., where radio communication between a Mobile Node\n      and\
    \ the specific Access Point is possible.\n   Access Network Router (ANR)\n   \
    \   An IP router in the Access Network.  An Access Network Router may\n      include\
    \ Access Network specific functionalities, for example,\n      related to mobility\
    \ and/or QoS.  This is to distinguish between\n      ordinary routers and routers\
    \ that have Access Network-related\n      special functionality.\n   Access Router\
    \ (AR)\n      An Access Network Router residing on the edge of an Access Network\n\
    \      and connected to one or more Access Points.  The Access Points may\n  \
    \    be of different technology.  An Access Router offers IP\n      connectivity\
    \ to Mobile Nodes, acting as a default router to the\n      Mobile Nodes it is\
    \ currently serving.  The Access Router may\n      include intelligence beyond\
    \ a simple forwarding service offered by\n      ordinary IP routers.\n   Access\
    \ Network Gateway (ANG)\n      An Access Network Router that separates an Access\
    \ Network from\n      other IP networks, much in the same way as an ordinary gateway\n\
    \      router.  The Access Network Gateway looks to the other IP networks\n  \
    \    like a standard IP router.  In a small network, an ANG may also\n      offer\
    \ the services of an AR, namely offer the IP connectivity to\n      the mobile\

- title: 4.1.  Scope of Handover
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Scope of Handover\n   Layer 2 handover\n      A handover where the MN changes\
    \ APs (or some other aspect of the\n      radio channel) connected to the same\
    \ AR's interface.  This type of\n      handover is transparent to the routing\
    \ at the IP layer (or it\n      appears simply as a link layer reconfiguration\
    \ without any\n      mobility implications).\n   Intra-AR handover\n      A handover\
    \ which changes the AR's network interface to the mobile.\n      That is, the\
    \ Serving AR remains the same but routing changes\n      internal to the AR take\
    \ place.\n   Intra-AN handover\n      A handover where the MN changes ARs inside\
    \ the same AN.  Such a\n      handover is not necessarily visible outside the\
    \ AN.  In case the\n      ANG serving the MN changes, this handover is seen outside\
    \ the AN\n      due to a change in the routing paths.  Note that the ANG may\n\
    \      change for only some of the MN's data flows.\n   Inter-AN handover\n  \
    \    A handover where the MN moves to a new AN.  This requires support\n     \
    \ for macro mobility.  Note that this would have to involve the\n      assignment\
    \ of a new IP access address (e.g., a new care-of\n      address) to the MN.\n\
    \   Intra-technology handover\n      A handover between equipment of the same\
    \ technology.\n   Inter-technology handover\n      A handover between equipment\
    \ of different technologies.\n   Horizontal handover\n      This involves MNs\
    \ moving between access points of the same type\n      (in terms of coverage,\
    \ data rate and mobility), such as, UMTS to\n      UMTS, or WLAN to WLAN.\n  \
    \ Vertical handover\n      This involves MNs moving between access points of different\
    \ type,\n      such as, UMTS to WLAN.\n   Note that the difference between a horizontal\
    \ and vertical handover\n   is vague.  For example, a handover from an AP with\
    \ 802.11b WLAN link\n   to an AP with 802.11g WLAN link may be considered as either\
    \ a\n   vertical or a horizontal handover, depending on an individual's point\n\
    \   of view.\n   Note also that the IP layer sees network interfaces and IP addresses,\n\
    \   rather than specific technologies used by those interfaces.  Thus,\n   horizontal\
    \ and vertical handovers may or may not be noticed at the IP\n   layer.  Usually\
    \ a handover can be noticed if the IP address assigned\n   to the interface changes,\
    \ the network interface itself changes (which\n   can also change the IP address),\
    \ or there is a link outage, for\n   example, when the mobile node moves out of\
    \ coverage for a while.  For\n   example, in a GPRS network a horizontal handover\
    \ happens usually\n   unnoticed by the IP layer.  Similarly, a WLAN horizontal\
    \ handover may\n   be noticed if the IP address of the interface changes.  On\
    \ the other\n   hand, vertical handovers often change the network interface and\
    \ are,\n   therefore, noticed on the IP layer.  Still, some specific network\n\
    \   cards may be able to switch between access technologies (e.g., GPRS\n   to\
    \ UMTS) without changing the network interface.  Moreover, either of\n   the two\
    \ handovers may or may not result in changing the AR.  For\n   example, an AR\
    \ could control WLAN and Bluetooth access points, and\n   the mobile node could\
    \ do horizontal and vertical handovers under the\n   same AR without changing\
    \ its IP address or even the network\n   interface.\n"

    \ is also either proactive or reactive (e):\n      Planned handover\n        \
    \ A proactive (expected) handover where some signaling can be\n         done in\
    \ advance of the MN getting connected to the new AR,\n         e.g., building\
    \ a temporary tunnel from the previous AR to the\n         new AR.\n      Unplanned\
    \ handover\n         A reactive (unexpected) handover where no signaling is done\
    \ in\n         advance of the MN's move from the previous AR to the new AR.\n\

    \ or at least support macro\n   diversity combining.  Essentially, this refers\
    \ to the fact that a\n   single MN is able to send and receive over two independent\
    \ radio\n   channels ('diversity branches') at the same time; the information\n\
    \   received over different branches is compared and that from the better\n  \

  - "4.6.  Paging, and Mobile Node States and Modes\n   Mobile systems may employ\
    \ the use of MN states in order to operate\n   more efficiently without degrading\
    \ the performance of the system.\n   The term 'mode' is also common and means\
    \ the same as 'state'.\n   A MN is always in one of the following three states:\n\
    \   Active state\n      When the AN knows the MN's SAR and the MN can send and\
    \ receive IP\n      packets.  The access link may not be active, but the radio\
    \ layer\n      is able to establish one without assistance from the network\n\
    \      layer.  The MN has an IP address assigned.\n   Dormant state\n      A state\
    \ in which the mobile restricts its ability to receive\n      normal IP traffic\
    \ by reducing its monitoring of radio channels.\n      The AN knows the MN's Paging\
    \ Area, but the MN has no SAR and so\n      packets cannot be delivered to the\
    \ MN without the AN initiating\n      paging.  Often also called Idle state.\n\
    \      Time-slotted dormant mode\n         A dormant mode implementation in which\
    \ the mobile alternates\n         between periods of not listening for any radio\
    \ traffic and\n         listening for traffic.  Time-slotted dormant mode\n  \
    \       implementations are typically synchronized with the network so\n     \
    \    the network can deliver paging messages to the mobile during\n         listening\
    \ periods.\n   Inactive state\n      the MN is in neither the Active nor Dormant\
    \ State.  The MN is no\n      longer listening for any packets, not even periodically,\
    \ and not\n      sending packets.  The MN may be in a powered off state, it may\n\
    \      have shut down all interfaces to drastically conserve power, or it\n  \
    \    may be out of range of a radio access point.  The MN does not\n      necessarily\
    \ have an IP access address from the AN.\n   Note: in fact, as well as the MN\
    \ being in one of these three states,\n   the AN also stores which state it believes\
    \ the MN is in.  Normally\n   these are consistent; the definitions above assume\
    \ so.\n   Here are some additional definitions for paging, taking into account\n\
    \   the above state definitions.\n   Paging\n      A procedure initiated by the\
    \ Access Network to move a Dormant MN\n      into the Active State.  As a result\
    \ of paging, the MN establishes\n      a SAR and the IP routes are set up.\n \
    \  Location updating\n      A procedure initiated by the MN, by which it informs\
    \ the AN that\n      it has moved into a new paging area.\n   Paging area\n  \
    \    A part of the Access Network, typically containing a number of\n      ARs/APs,\
    \ which corresponds to some geographical area.  The AN\n      keeps and updates\
    \ a list of all the Dormant MNs present in the\n      area.  If the MN is within\
    \ the radio coverage of the area it will\n      be able to receive paging messages\
    \ sent within that Paging Area.\n   Paging area registrations\n      Signaling\
    \ from a dormant mode mobile node to the network, by which\n      it establishes\
    \ its presence in a new paging area.  Paging Area\n      Registrations thus enable\
    \ the network to maintain a rough idea of\n      where the mobile is located.\n\
    \   Paging channel\n      A radio channel dedicated to signaling dormant mode\
    \ mobiles for\n      paging purposes.  By current practice, the paging channel\
    \ carries\n      only control traffic necessary for the radio link, although some\n\
    \      paging protocols have provision for carrying arbitrary traffic\n      (and\
    \ thus could potentially be used to carry IP).\n   Traffic channel\n      The\
    \ radio channel on which IP traffic to an active mobile is\n      typically sent.\
    \  This channel is used by a mobile that is actively\n      sending and receiving\
    \ IP traffic, and is not continuously active\n      in a dormant mode mobile.\
    \  For some radio link protocols, this may\n      be the only channel available.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Context Transfer
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Context Transfer\n   Context\n      The information on the current state\
    \ of a routing-related service\n      required to re-establish the routing-related\
    \ service on a new\n      subnet without having to perform the entire protocol\
    \ exchange with\n      the MN from scratch.\n   Feature context\n      The collection\

    \ context associated with a MN is the collection\n      of one or more feature\
    \ contexts.\n   Context transfer\n      The movement of context from one router\

    \ services on\n      a new subnet or collection of subnets.\n   Routing-related\
    \ service\n      A modification to the default routing treatment of packets to\
    \ and\n      from the MN.  Initially establishing routing-related services\n \
    \     usually requires a protocol exchange with the MN.  An example of a\n   \
    \   routing-related service is header compression.  The service may\n      also\
    \ be indirectly related to routing, for example, security.\n      Security may\
    \ not affect the forwarding decision of all\n      intermediate routers, but a\
    \ packet may be dropped if it fails a\n      security check (can't be encrypted,\

- title: 4.9.  Types of Mobility
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Types of Mobility\n   We can differentiate between host and network mobility,\
    \ and various\n   types of network mobility.  Terminology related more to applications\n\
    \   such as the Session Initiation Protocol, such as personal mobility,\n   is\
    \ out of scope for this document.\n      Host mobility support\n         Refers\
    \ to the function of allowing a mobile node to change its\n         point of attachment\
    \ to the network, without interrupting IP\n         packet delivery to/from that\
    \ node.  There may be different sub-\n         functions depending on what the\
    \ current level of service is\n         being provided; in particular, support\
    \ for host mobility\n         usually implies active and dormant modes of operation,\n\
    \         depending on whether the node has any current sessions or not.\n   \
    \      Access Network procedures are required to keep track of the\n         current\
    \ point of attachment of all the MNs or establish it at\n         will.  Accurate\
    \ location and routing procedures are required in\n         order to maintain\
    \ the integrity of the communication.  Host\n         mobility is often called\
    \ 'terminal mobility'.\n      Network mobility support\n         Refers to the\
    \ function of allowing an entire network to change\n         its point of attachment\
    \ to the Internet, and, thus, its\n         reachability in the topology, without\
    \ interrupting IP packet\n         delivery to/from that mobile network.\n   Two\
    \ subcategories of mobility can be identified within both host\n   mobility and\
    \ network mobility:\n      Global mobility\n         Same as Macro mobility.\n\
    \      Local mobility\n         Same as Micro mobility.\n      Macro mobility\n\
    \         Mobility over a large area.  This includes mobility support and\n  \
    \       associated address registration procedures that are needed when\n    \
    \     a MN moves between IP domains.  Inter-AN handovers typically\n         involve\
    \ macro-mobility protocols.  Mobile-IP can be seen as a\n         means to provide\
    \ macro mobility.\n      Micro mobility\n         Mobility over a small area.\
    \  Usually this means mobility within\n         an IP domain with an emphasis\
    \ on support for active mode using\n         handover, although it may include\
    \ idle mode procedures also.\n         Micro-mobility protocols exploit the locality\
    \ of movement by\n         confining movement related changes and signaling to\
    \ the access\n         network.\n      Local mobility management\n         Local\
    \ mobility management (LMM) is a generic term for protocols\n         dealing\
    \ with IP mobility management confined within the access\n         network.  LMM\
    \ messages are not routed outside the access\n         network, although a handover\
    \ may trigger Mobile IP messages to\n         be sent to correspondent nodes and\
    \ home agents.\n"
