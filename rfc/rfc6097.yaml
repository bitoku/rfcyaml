  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] deployment would\
    \ benefit from\n   a functionality where a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) can dynamically\n\
    \   discover a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for a Mobile Node (MN)\n   attaching\
    \ to a PMIPv6 domain.  The purpose of the dynamic discovery\n   functionality\
    \ is to reduce the amount of static configuration in the\n   MAG.  Other drivers\
    \ for the dynamic discovery of an LMA include LMA\n   load balancing solutions\
    \ and selecting an LMA based on desired\n   services (i.e., allowing service-specific\
    \ routing of traffic)\n   [RFC5149].  This document describes several possible\
    \ dynamic LMA\n   discovery approaches and makes a recommendation of the preferred\
    \ one.\n   The following list briefly introduces solution approaches that will\n\
    \   be discussed in this document.  The approaches discussed do not\n   include\
    \ all possible discovery mechanisms, but are limited to those\n   considered to\
    \ fit most simply into the PMIPv6 environment.\n   o  LMA Address is retrieved\
    \ from the Authentication, Authorization,\n      and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure\
    \ during the network access\n      authentication procedure when the MN attaches\
    \ to the MAG.\n   o  LMA Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is retrieved from\
    \ the AAA\n      infrastructure during the network access authentication, followed\n\
    \      by a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup.\n   o  LMA FQDN is derived from the\
    \ MN identity received from the lower\n      layers during the network attachment,\
    \ followed by a DNS lookup.\n   o  LMA FQDN or IP address is received from the\
    \ lower layers during\n      the network attachment.  The reception of an FQDN\
    \ from the lower\n      layers is followed by a DNS lookup.\n   o  LMA FQDN is\
    \ derived from the service selection indication received\n      from lower layers\
    \ during the network attachment, followed by a DNS\n      lookup.\n   When an\
    \ MN performs a handover from one MAG to another, the new MAG\n   must use the\
    \ same LMA that the old MAG was using.  This is required\n   for session continuity.\
    \  The LMA discovery mechanism in the new MAG\n   should be able to return the\
    \ information of the same LMA that was\n   being used by the old MAG.  This document\
    \ also discusses solutions\n   for LMA discovery during a handover.\n"
- title: 2.  AAA-Based Discovery Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.  AAA-Based Discovery Solutions\n   This section presents an LMA discovery\
    \ solution that requires a MAG\n   to be connected to an AAA infrastructure (as\
    \ described in [RFC5779],\n   for instance).  The AAA infrastructure is also assumed\
    \ to be aware of\n   PMIPv6.  An MN attaching to a PMIPv6 domain is typically\
    \ required to\n   provide authentication for network access and to be authorized\
    \ for\n   mobility services before the MN is allowed to send or receive any IP\n\
    \   packets or even complete its IP level configuration.\n   The AAA-based LMA\
    \ discovery solution hooks into the network access\n   authentication and authorization\
    \ process.  The MAG also has the role\n   of a Network Access Server (NAS) at\
    \ this step.  While the MN is\n   attaching to the network, the PMIPv6-related\
    \ parameters are\n   bootstrapped in parallel with authentication for the network\
    \ access\n   and authorization for the mobility services.  The bootstrapping of\n\
    \   PMIPv6 parameters involves the policy profile download over the AAA\n   infrastructure\
    \ to the MAG (see Appendix A of [RFC5213]).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Receiving the LMA Address during Network Access Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Receiving the LMA Address during Network Access Authentication\n   After\
    \ the MN has been successfully authenticated for network access\n   and authorized\
    \ for the mobility service, the MAG receives the LMA IP\n   address from the AAA\
    \ server over the AAA infrastructure.  The LMA IP\n   address information would\
    \ be part of the AAA message that ends the\n   successful authentication and authorization\
    \ portion of the AAA\n   exchange.\n   Once the MAG receives the LMA IP address,\
    \ it sends a Proxy Binding\n   Update (PBU) message for the newly authenticated\
    \ and authorized MN.\n   The MAG expects that the LMA returned by the AAA server\
    \ is able to\n   provide mobility session continuity for the MN, i.e., after a\n\
    \   handover, the LMA would be the same one the MN already has a mobility\n  \
    \ session set up with.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Receiving the LMA FQDN during Network Access Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Receiving the LMA FQDN during Network Access Authentication\n   This solution\
    \ is similar to the procedure described in Section 2.1.\n   The difference is\
    \ that the MAG receives an FQDN of the LMA instead of\n   the IP address(es).\
    \  The MAG has to query the DNS infrastructure in\n   order to resolve the FQDN\
    \ to the LMA IP address(es).\n   The LMA FQDN might be a generic name for a PMIPv6\
    \ domain that\n   resolves to one or more LMAs in the PMIPv6 domain.  Alternatively,\n\
    \   the LMA FQDN might be resolved to exactly one LMA within the PMIPv6\n   domain.\
    \  The latter approach would obviously be useful if a new\n   target MAG, after\
    \ a handover, resolved the LMA FQDN to the LMA IP\n   address where the MN mobility\
    \ session is already located.\n   The procedures described in this section and\
    \ in Section 2.1 may also\n   be used together.  For example, the AAA server might\
    \ return a generic\n   LMA FQDN during the MN's initial attachment, and once the\
    \ LMA gets\n   selected, return the LMA IP address during the subsequent attachments\n\
    \   to other MAGs in the PMIPv6 domain.  In order for this to work, the\n   resolved\
    \ and selected LMA IP address must be updated to the remote\n   policy store.\
    \  For example, the LMA could perform the policy store\n   update using the AAA\
    \ infrastructure once it receives the initial PBU\n   from the MAG for the new\
    \ mobility session.\n"
- title: 3.  Discovery Solutions Based on Data from Lower Layers
  contents:
  - "3.  Discovery Solutions Based on Data from Lower Layers\n   The following section\
    \ discusses solutions where a MAG acquires\n   information from layers below the\
    \ IP layer.  Based on this\n   information, the MAG is able to determine which\
    \ LMA to contact when\n   the MN attaches to the MAG.  The lower layers discussed\
    \ here are not\n   explicitly defined but include different radio access technologies\n\
    \   and tunneling solutions such as an Internet Key Exchange version 2\n   (IKEv2)\
    \ [RFC5996] IPsec tunnel [RFC4303].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Mobile Node Identity
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Mobile Node Identity\n   A MAG acquires\
    \ an MN identity from lower layers.  The MAG can use the\n   information embedded\
    \ in the identity to construct a generic LMA FQDN\n   (based on some pre-configured\
    \ formatting rules) and then proceed to\n   resolve the LMA IP address(es) using\
    \ the DNS.  Obviously, the MN\n   identity must embed information that can be\
    \ used to uniquely identify\n   the entity hosting and operating the LMA for the\
    \ MN.  Examples of\n   such MN identities are the International Mobile Subscriber\
    \ Identity\n   (IMSI) and the Globally Unique Temporary User Equipment Identity\n\
    \   (GUTI) [3GPP.23.003].  These MN identities contain information that\n   can\
    \ uniquely identify the operator to whom the subscription belongs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Receiving the LMA FQDN or IP Address from Lower Layers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Receiving the LMA FQDN or IP Address from Lower Layers\n   The solution\
    \ described here is similar to the solution discussed in\n   Section 3.1.  A MAG\
    \ receives an LMA FQDN or an IP address from lower\n   layers, for example, as\
    \ a part of the normal lower-layer signaling\n   when the MN attaches to the network.\
    \  IKEv2 could be an existing\n   example of such lower-layer signaling where\
    \ IPsec is the \"lower\n   layer\" for the MN [3GPP.24.302].  IKEv2 has an IKEv2\n\
    \   Identification - Responder (IDr) payload, which is used by the IKEv2\n   initiator\
    \ (i.e., the MN in this case) to specify which of the\n   responder's identities\
    \ (i.e., the LMA in this case) it wants to talk\n   to.  And here the responder\
    \ identity could be an FQDN or an IP\n   address of the LMA (as the IKEv2 identification\
    \ payload can be an IP\n   address or an FQDN).  Another existing example is the\
    \ Access Point\n   Name Information Element (APN IE) [3GPP.24.008] used in 3GPP\
    \ radio\n   network access signaling and capable of carrying an FQDN.  However,\n\
    \   in general, this means the MN is also the originator of the LMA\n   information.\
    \  The LMA information content as such can be transparent\n   to the MN, meaning\
    \ the MN does not associate the information with any\n   LMA function.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Service Name
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Constructing the LMA FQDN from a Service Name\n   Some network access technologies\
    \ (including tunneling solutions)\n   allow the MN to signal the service name\
    \ that identifies a particular\n   service or the external network it wants to\
    \ access [3GPP.24.302]\n   [RFC5996].  If the MN-originated service name also\
    \ embeds the\n   information of the entity hosting the service, or the hosting\n\
    \   information can be derived from other information available at the\n   same\
    \ time (e.g., see Section 3.1), then the MAG can construct a\n   generic LMA FQDN\
    \ (e.g., based on some pre-defined formatting rules)\n   providing an access to\
    \ the service or the external network.  The\n   pre-defined formatting rules [3GPP.23.003]\
    \ are usually agreed on\n   among operators that belong to the same inter-operator\
    \ roaming\n   consortium or by network infrastructure vendors defining an open\n\
    \   networking system architecture.\n   Once the MAG has the FQDN, it can proceed\
    \ to resolve the LMA IP\n   address(es) using the DNS.  An example of such a service\
    \ or external\n   network name is the Access Point Name (APN) [3GPP.23.003] that\n\
    \   contains the information of the operator providing the access to the\n   given\
    \ service or the external network.  For example, an FQDN for an\n   \"ims\" APN\
    \ could be \"ims.apn.epc.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org\".\n"
- title: 4.  Handover Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Handover Considerations\n   Whenever an MN moves and attaches to a new MAG\
    \ in a PMIPv6 domain,\n   all the MAGs that the MN attaches to should use the\
    \ same LMA.  If\n   there is only one LMA per PMIPv6 domain, then there is no\
    \ issue.  If\n   there is a context transfer mechanism available between the MAGs,\n\
    \   then the new MAG knows the LMA information from the old MAG.  Such a\n   mechanism\
    \ is described in [RFC5949].  If the MN-related context is\n   not transferred\
    \ between the MAGs, then a mechanism to deliver the\n   current LMA information\
    \ to the new MAG is required.\n   Relying on DNS during handovers is not generally\
    \ a working solution\n   if the PMIPv6 domain has more than one LMA, unless the\
    \ DNS\n   consistently assigns a specific LMA for each given MN.  In most cases\n\
    \   described in Section 3, where the MAG derives the LMA FQDN, there is\n   no\
    \ prior knowledge whether the LMA FQDN resolves to one or more LMA\n   IP address(es)\
    \ in the PMIPv6 domain.  However, depending on the\n   deployment and deployment-related\
    \ regulations (such as inter-operator\n   roaming consortium agreements), the\
    \ situation might not be this\n   desperate.  For example, a MAG might be able\
    \ to synthesize an\n   LMA-specific FQDN (e.g., out of an MN identity or some\
    \ other\n   service-specific parameters).  Alternatively, the MAG could use (for\n\
    \   example), an MN identity as an input to an algorithm that\n   deterministically\
    \ assigns the same LMA out of a pool of LMAs\n   (assuming the MAG has, e.g.,\
    \ learned a group of LMA FQDNs via an SRV\n   [RFC2782] query).  These approaches\
    \ would guarantee that DNS always\n   returns the same LMA Address to the MAG.\n\
    \   Once the MN completes its initial attachment to a PMIPv6 domain, the\n   information\
    \ about the LMA that is selected to serve the MN is stored\n   in the policy store\
    \ (or the AAA server).  The LMA information is\n   conveyed to the policy store\
    \ by the LMA after the initial attachment\n   is completed [RFC5779].  Typically,\
    \ AAA infrastructure is used for\n   exchanging information between the LMA and\
    \ the policy store.\n   When the MN moves and attaches to another MAG in the PMIPv6\
    \ domain,\n   then the AAA server delivers the existing LMA information to the\
    \ new\n   MAG as part of the authentication and authorization procedure as\n \
    \  described in Section 2.1.\n"
- title: 5.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.  Recommendations\n   This document discussed several solution approaches for\
    \ a dynamic LMA\n   discovery.  All discussed solution approaches actually require\n\
    \   additional functionality or infrastructure support that the base\n   PMIPv6\
    \ specification [RFC5213] does not require.\n   Solutions in Section 3 all depend\
    \ on lower layers being able to\n   provide information that a MAG can then use\
    \ to query the DNS and\n   discover a suitable LMA.  The capabilities of the lower\
    \ layers and\n   the interactions with them are generally out of scope of the\
    \ IETF,\n   and specific to a certain system and architecture.\n   Solutions in\
    \ Section 2 depend on the existence of an AAA\n   infrastructure, which is able\
    \ to provide to a MAG either an LMA IP\n   address or an LMA FQDN.  While there\
    \ can be system- and architecture-\n   specific details regarding the AAA interactions\
    \ and the use of DNS,\n   the dynamic LMA discovery can be implemented in an access-\
    \ and\n   technology-agnostic manner, and work in the same way across\n   heterogeneous\
    \ environments.  Therefore, using AAA-based LMA discovery\n   solutions is recommended\
    \ by this document.  Furthermore, following\n   the guidance in Section 4, Paragraph\
    \ 4.1 of [RFC1958], the use of\n   FQDNs should be preferred over IP addresses\
    \ in the context of\n   AAA-based LMA discovery solutions.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The use of DNS for obtaining the IP address of\
    \ a mobility agent\n   carries certain security risks.  These are explained in\
    \ detail in\n   Section 9.1 of [RFC5026].  However, the risks described in [RFC5026]\n\
    \   are mitigated to a large extent in this document, since the MAG and\n   the\
    \ LMA belong to the same PMIPv6 domain.  The DNS server that the\n   MAG queries\
    \ is also part of the same PMIPv6 domain.  Even if the MAG\n   obtains the IP\
    \ address of a bogus LMA from a bogus DNS server,\n   further harm is prevented\
    \ since the MAG and the LMA should\n   authenticate each other before exchanging\
    \ PMIPv6 signaling messages.\n   [RFC5213] specifies the use of IKEv2 between\
    \ the MAG and the LMA to\n   authenticate each other and set up IPsec security\
    \ associations for\n   protecting the PMIPv6 signaling messages.\n   The AAA infrastructure\
    \ may be used to transport the LMA-discovery-\n   related information between\
    \ the MAG and the AAA server via one or\n   more AAA brokers and/or AAA proxies.\
    \  In this case, the MAG-to-AAA-\n   server communication relies on the security\
