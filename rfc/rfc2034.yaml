- title: 1.  Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service [RFC-821,\
    \ RFC-\n   1869] whereby an SMTP server augments its responses with the enhanced\n\
    \   mail system status codes defined in RFC 1893.  These codes can then\n   be\
    \ used to provide more informative explanations of error conditions,\n   especially\
    \ in the context of the delivery status notifications format\n   defined in RFC\
    \ 1894.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, various extensions\n\
    \   have been requested by parts of the Internet community. In\n   particular,\
    \ in the modern, international, and multilingual Internet a\n   need exists to\
    \ assign codes to specific error conditions that can be\n   translated into different\
    \ languages. RFC 1893 defines such a set of\n   status codes and RFC 1894 defines\
    \ a mechanism to send such coded\n   material to users. However, in many cases\
    \ the agent creating the RFC\n   1894 delivery status notification is doing so\
    \ in response to errors\n   it received from a remote SMTP server.\n   As such,\
    \ remote servers need a mechanism for embedding enhanced\n   status codes in their\
    \ responses as well as a way to indicate to a\n   client when they are in fact\
    \ doing this. This memo uses the SMTP\n   extension mechanism described in RFC\
    \ 1869 to define such a mechanism.\n"
- title: 3.  Framework for the Enhanced Error Statuses Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  Framework for the Enhanced Error Statuses Extension\n   The enhanced error\
    \ statuses transport extension is laid out as\n   follows:\n   (1)   the name\
    \ of the SMTP service extension defined here is\n         Enhanced-Status-Codes;\n\
    \   (2)   the EHLO keyword value associated with the extension is\n         ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES;\n\
    \   (3)   no parameter is used with the ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES EHLO\n         keyword;\n\
    \   (4)   the text part of all 2xx, 4xx, and 5xx SMTP responses\n         other\
    \ than the initial greeting and any response to\n         HELO or EHLO are prefaced\
    \ with a status code as defined\n         in RFC 1893. This status code is always\
    \ followed by one\n         or more spaces.\n   (5)   no additional SMTP verbs\
    \ are defined by this extension;\n         and,\n   (6)   the next section specifies\
    \ how support for the\n         extension affects the behavior of a server and\
    \ client\n         SMTP.\n"
- title: 4.  The Enhanced-Status-Codes service extension
  contents:
  - "4.  The Enhanced-Status-Codes service extension\n   Servers supporting the Enhanced-Status-Codes\
    \ extension must preface\n   the text part of almost all response lines with a\
    \ status code. As in\n   RFC 1893, the syntax of these status codes is given by\
    \ the ABNF:\n        status-code ::= class \".\" subject \".\" detail\n      \
    \  class       ::= \"2\" / \"4\" / \"5\"\n        subject     ::= 1*3digit\n \
    \       detail      ::= 1*3digit\n   These codes must appear in all 2xx, 4xx,\
    \ and 5xx response lines other\n   than initial greeting and any response to HELO\
    \ or EHLO. Note that 3xx\n   responses are NOT included in this list.\n   All\
    \ status codes returned by the server must agree with the primary\n   response\
    \ code, that is, a 2xx response must incorporate a 2.X.X code,\n   a 4xx response\
    \ must incorporate a 4.X.X code, and a 5xx response must\n   incorporate a 5.X.X\
    \ code.\n   When responses are continued across multiple lines the same status\n\
    \   code must appear at the beginning of the text in each line of the\n   response.\n\
    \   Servers supporting this extension must attach enhanced status codes\n   to\
    \ their responses regardless of whether or not EHLO is employed by\n   the client.\n"
- title: 5.  Status Codes and Negotiation
  contents:
  - "5.  Status Codes and Negotiation\n   This specification does not provide a means\
    \ for clients to request\n   that status codes be returned or that they not be\
    \ returned; a\n   compliant server includes these codes in the responses it sends\n\
    \   regardless of whether or not the client expects them.  This is\n   somewhat\
    \ different from most other SMTP extensions, where generally\n   speaking a client\
    \ must specifically make a request before the\n   extended server behaves any\
    \ differently than an unextended server.\n   The omission of client negotiation\
    \ in this case is entirely\n   intentional: Given the generally poor state of\
    \ SMTP server error code\n   implementation it is felt that any step taken towards\
    \ more\n   comprehensible error codes is something that all clients, extended\
    \ or\n   not, should benefit from.\n   IMPORTANT NOTE:  The use of this approach\
    \ in this extension should be\n   seen as a very special case.  It MUST NOT be\
    \ taken as a license for\n   future SMTP extensions to dramatically change the\
    \ nature of SMTP\n   client-server interaction without proper announcement from\
    \ the server\n   and a corresponding enabling command from the client.\n"
