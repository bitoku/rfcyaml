- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IMAP [RFC3501] clients typically fetch the set of rights\
    \ granted on\n   mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the\
    \ logged-\n   in user.  In order to do that, the client is forced to issue a LIST\n\
    \   or LSUB command to list all available mailboxes, followed by a\n   MYRIGHTS\
    \ command for each mailbox found.  This document defines an\n   extension to the\
    \ to IMAP LIST command that is identified by the\n   capability string \"LIST-MYRIGHTS\"\
    .  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension\n   allows the client to request the set of rights\
    \ that the logged-in\n   user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other\
    \ information\n   typically returned by the LIST command.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" indicates lines\
    \ sent by a client that is connected\n   to a server.  \"S:\" indicates lines\
    \ sent by the server to the client.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",\
    \ \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when,\
    \ they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command
  contents:
  - "3.  MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command\n   [RFC4314] defines the MYRIGHTS\
    \ command, which is used by an IMAP\n   client to determine the set of rights\
    \ that the logged-in user has\n   been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently,\
    \ a client will have to\n   look up the rights for some or all of the mailboxes\
    \ returned by the\n   LIST command.  Doing so in multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes\n\
    \   bandwidth and can degrade performance if the client does not pipeline\n  \
    \ the requests.\n   This document extends the LIST command with a new \"MYRIGHTS\"\
    \ return\n   option [RFC5258] that allows the client to request all of the desired\n\
    \   information in a single command.  For each listable mailbox matching\n   the\
    \ list pattern and selection options, the server MUST return an\n   untagged LIST\
    \ response and SHOULD also return an untagged MYRIGHTS\n   response containing\
    \ the set of rights granted to the logged-in user.\n   The ordering of the responses\
    \ is significant only in that the server\n   MUST NOT send a MYRIGHTS response\
    \ for a given mailbox before it sends\n   the LIST response for that mailbox.\n\
    \   If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a given\n   mailbox,\
    \ it does not send the MYRIGHTS reply for that mailbox.\n   Client authors ought\
    \ to note that generating the MYRIGHTS responses\n   for a large number of mailboxes\
    \ may be an expensive operation for the\n   server.  Clients SHOULD use a suitable\
    \ match pattern and/or selection\n   option to limit the set of mailboxes returned\
    \ to only those in whose\n   rights they are interested.\n"
- title: 4.  Examples
  contents:
  - "4.  Examples\n   In this example, the \"bar\" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has\
    \ no\n   MYRIGHTS reply.\n   C: A01 LIST \"\" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)\n   S: * LIST\
    \ () \".\" \"INBOX\"\n   S: * MYRIGHTS \"INBOX\" lrswipkxtecda\n   S: * LIST ()\
    \ \".\" \"foo\"\n   S: * MYRIGHTS \"foo\" lrs\n   S: * LIST (\\NonExistent) \"\
    .\" \"bar\"\n   S: A01 OK List completed.\n   In this example, the LIST reply\
    \ for the \"foo\" mailbox is returned\n   because it has matching children, but\
    \ no MYRIGHTS reply is returned,\n   because \"foo\" itself doesn't match the\
    \ selection criteria.\n   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) \"\" % RETURN\
    \ (MYRIGHTS)\n   S: * LIST (\\Subscribed) \".\" \"INBOX\"\n   S: * MYRIGHTS \"\

    ))\n   S: A02 OK List completed.\n"
- title: 5.  Formal Syntax
  contents:
  - "5.  Formal Syntax\n   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur\n\
    \   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Terms not defined here are\n   taken\
    \ from [RFC5258].\n   return-option =/ \"MYRIGHTS\"\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security considerations described\
    \ in [RFC4314],\n   this extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload\
    \ the\n   server by requesting MYRIGHTS information for a large number of\n  \
    \ mailboxes.  However, as noted in the introduction, existing clients\n   already\
    \ try to do that by generating a large number of MYRIGHTS\n   commands for each\
    \ mailbox in which they are interested.  While\n   performing MYRIGHTS information\
    \ retrieval for big lists of mailboxes,\n   a server implementation needs to make\
    \ sure that it can still serve\n   other IMAP connections and yield execution\
    \ to other connections, when\n   necessary.\n"
