Dr. Roberts informs me that it is now unlikely that he will be able to attend the Monday afternoon session of the NWG meeting, but that he will be able to attend the Tuesday evening session.
Accordingly, the topics of "Network Planning" and "other ARPA Projects" are moved to Tuesday evening, and on Monday afternoon, we will take up as many of the items originally scheduled for Tuesday evening as we can.
The relevant reading for Wednesday evening is RFC #131, not #113.
In general attendees should read all of the RFC's since the last NWG meeting.
