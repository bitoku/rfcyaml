- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Autonomous System 0 was listed in the IANA Autonomous System\
    \ Number\n   Registry as \"Reserved - May be use [sic] to identify non-routed\n\
    \   networks\" ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).\n   [RFC6491] specifies that AS 0 in a Route\
    \ Origin Attestation (ROA) is\n   used to mark a prefix and all its more specific\
    \ prefixes as not to be\n   used in a routing context.  This allows a resource\
    \ holder to signal\n   that a prefix (and the more specifics) should not be routed\
    \ by\n   publishing a ROA listing AS 0 as the only origin.  To respond to this\n\
    \   signal requires that BGP implementations not accept or propagate\n   routes\
    \ containing AS 0.\n   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found\
    \ in any BGP\n   specification.  This document corrects this omission, most\n\
    \   importantly in the case of the AS_PATH.  This represents an update to\n  \
    \ the error handling procedures given in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of\n   [RFC4271]\
    \ by specifying the behavior in the presence of AS 0.\n   At least two implementations\
    \ discard routes containing AS 0, and this\n   document codifies this behavior.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Notation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Notation\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.  Behavior\n   A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an\
    \ AS\n   number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, or\n   AS4_AGGREGATOR\
    \ attributes.\n   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the\
    \ AS_PATH\n   or AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be\n\
    \   handled by the procedures specified in [RFC7606].\n   An UPDATE message that\
    \ contains the AS number of zero in the AS4_PATH\n   or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute\
    \ MUST be considered as malformed and be\n   handled by the procedures specified\
    \ in [RFC6793].\n   If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message,\
    \ it\n   MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code\n \
    \  \"OPEN Message Error\" and subcode \"Bad Peer AS\" (see Section 6 of\n   [RFC4271]).\
    \  A router MUST NOT initiate a connection claiming to be\n   AS 0.\n   Authors\
    \ of future protocol extensions that carry the Autonomous\n   System number are\
    \ encouraged to keep in mind that AS 0 is reserved\n   and to provide clear direction\
    \ on how to handle AS 0.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has updated the registry for \"16-bit Autonomous\
    \ System\n   Numbers\" so that the entry for AS 0 is simply \"Reserved\".\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   By allowing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure\
    \ (RPKI) resource\n   holder to issue a ROA saying that AS 0 is the only valid\
    \ origin for a\n   route, we allow them to state that a particular address resource\
    \ is\n   not in use.  By ensuring that all implementations that see AS 0 in a\n\
    \   route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party from announcing\n  \
    \ routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those resources.\n   In addition,\
    \ by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an\n   AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH)\
    \ containing AS 0, this document makes the\n   behavior better defined.\n"
