  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is the\
    \ much larger\n   address space for IPv6, which also goes hand-in-hand with much\
    \ larger\n   subnet sizes.  This change has a significant impact on the\n   feasibility\
    \ of TCP and UDP network scanning, whereby an automated\n   process is run to\
    \ detect open ports (services) on systems that may\n   then be subject to a subsequent\
    \ attack.  Today many IPv4 sites are\n   subjected to such probing on a recurring\
    \ basis.  Such probing is\n   common in part due to the relatively dense population\
    \ of active hosts\n   in any given chunk of IPv4 address space.\n   The 128 bits\
    \ of IPv6 [1] address space is considerably bigger than\n   the 32 bits of address\
    \ space in IPv4.  In particular, the IPv6\n   subnets to which hosts attach will\
    \ by default have 64 bits of host\n   address space [2].  As a result, traditional\
    \ methods of remote TCP or\n   UDP network scanning to discover open or running\
    \ services on a host\n   will potentially become less feasible, due to the larger\
    \ search space\n   in the subnet.  Similarly, worms that rely on off-link network\n\
    \   scanning to propagate may also potentially be more limited in impact.\n  \
    \ This document discusses this property of IPv6 and describes related\n   issues\
    \ for IPv6 site network administrators to consider, which may be\n   useful when\
    \ planning site address allocation and management\n   strategies.\n   For example,\
    \ many worms, like Slammer, rely on such address scanning\n   methods to propagate,\
    \ whether they pick subnets numerically (and thus\n   probably topologically)\
    \ close to the current victim, or subnets in\n   random remote networks.  The\
    \ nature of these worms may change, if\n   detection of target hosts between sites\
    \ or subnets is harder to\n   achieve by traditional methods.  However, there\
    \ are other worms that\n   propagate via methods such as email, for which the\
    \ methods discussed\n   in this text are not relevant.\n   It must be remembered\
    \ that the defence of a network must not rely\n   solely on the unpredictable\
    \ sparseness of the host addresses on that\n   network.  Such a feature or property\
    \ is only one measure in a set of\n   measures that may be applied.  This document\
    \ discusses various\n   measures that can be used by a site to mitigate attacks\
    \ as part of an\n   overall strategy.  Some of these have a lower cost to deploy\
    \ than\n   others.  For example, if numbering hosts on a subnet, it may be as\n\
    \   cheap to number hosts without any predictable pattern as it is to\n   number\
    \ them sequentially.  In contrast, use of IPv6 privacy\n   extensions [3] may\
    \ complicate network management (identifying which\n   hosts use which addresses).\n\
    \   This document complements the transition-centric discussion of the\n   issues\
    \ that can be found in Appendix A of \"IPv6 Transition/\n   Co-existence Security\
    \ Considerations\" [12], which takes a broad view\n   of security issues for transitioning\
    \ networks.  The reader is also\n   referred to a recent paper by Bellovin on\
    \ network worm propagation\n   strategies in IPv6 networks [13].  This paper discusses\
    \ some of the\n   issues included in this document, from a slightly different\n\
    \   perspective.\n"

  - "2.  Target Address Space for Network Scanning\n   There are significantly different\
    \ considerations for the feasibility\n   of plain, brute-force IPv4 and IPv6 address\
    \ scanning.\n"
- title: 2.1.  IPv4
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPv4\n   A typical IPv4 subnet may have 8 bits reserved for host addressing.\n\
    \   In such a case, a remote attacker need only probe at most 256\n   addresses\
    \ to determine if a particular service is running publicly on\n   a host in that\
    \ subnet.  Even at only one probe per second, such a\n   scan would take under\
    \ 5 minutes to complete.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IPv6\n   A typical IPv6 subnet will have 64 bits reserved for host addressing.\n\
    \   In such a case, a remote attacker in principle needs to probe 2^64\n   addresses\
    \ to determine if a particular open service is running on a\n   host in that subnet.\
    \  At a very conservative one probe per second,\n   such a scan may take some\
    \ 5 billion years to complete.  A more rapid\n   probe will still be limited to\
    \ (effectively) infinite time for the\n   whole address space.  However, there\
    \ are ways for the attacker to\n   reduce the address search space to scan against\
    \ within the target\n   subnet, as we discuss below.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Reducing the IPv6 Search Space
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Reducing the IPv6 Search Space\n   The IPv6 host address space through\
    \ which an attacker may search can\n   be reduced in at least two ways.\n   First,\
    \ the attacker may rely on the administrator conveniently\n   numbering their\
    \ hosts from [prefix]::1 upward.  This makes scanning\n   trivial, and thus should\
    \ be avoided unless the host's address is\n   readily obtainable from other sources\
    \ (for example, it is the site's\n   published primary DNS or email Mail Exchange\
    \ (MX) server).\n   Alternatively, if hosts are numbered sequentially, or using\
    \ any\n   regular scheme, knowledge of one address may expose other available\n\
    \   addresses to scan.\n   Second, in the case of statelessly autoconfiguring\
    \ [1] hosts, the\n   host part of the address will usually take a well-known format\
    \ that\n   includes the Ethernet vendor prefix and the \"fffe\" stuffing.  For\n\
    \   such hosts, the search space can be reduced to 48 bits.  Further, if\n   the\
    \ Ethernet vendor is also known, the search space may be reduced to\n   24 bits,\
    \ with a one probe per second scan then taking a less daunting\n   194 days. \
    \ Even where the exact vendor is not known, using a set of\n   common vendor prefixes\
    \ can reduce the search.  In addition, many\n   nodes in a site network may be\
    \ procured in batches, and thus have\n   sequential or near sequential Media Access\
    \ Control (MAC) addresses;\n   if one node's autoconfigured address is known,\
    \ scanning around that\n   address may yield results for the attacker.  Again,\
    \ any form of\n   sequential host addressing should be avoided if possible.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Dual-Stack Networks
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Dual-Stack Networks\n   Full advantage of the increased IPv6 address space\
    \ in terms of\n   resilience to network scanning may not be gained until IPv6-only\n\
    \   networks and devices become more commonplace, given that most IPv6\n   hosts\
    \ are currently dual stack, with (more readily scannable) IPv4\n   connectivity.\
    \  However, many applications or services (e.g., new\n   peer-to-peer applications)\
    \ on the (dual-stack) hosts may emerge that\n   are only accessible over IPv6,\
    \ and that thus can only be discovered\n   by IPv6 address scanning.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Defensive Scanning
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Defensive Scanning\n   The problem faced by the attacker for an IPv6 network\
    \ is also faced\n   by a site administrator looking for vulnerabilities in their\
    \ own\n   network's systems.  The administrator should have the advantage of\n\
    \   being on-link for scanning purposes though.\n"
- title: '3.  Alternatives for Attackers: Off-Link'
  contents:
  - "3.  Alternatives for Attackers: Off-Link\n   If IPv6 hosts in subnets are allocated\
    \ addresses 'randomly', and as a\n   result IPv6 network scanning becomes relatively\
    \ infeasible, attackers\n   will need to find new methods to identify IPv6 addresses\
    \ for\n   subsequent scanning.  In this section, we discuss some possible paths\n\
    \   attackers may take.  In these cases, the attacker will attempt to\n   identify\
    \ specific IPv6 addresses for subsequent targeted probes.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Gleaning IPv6 Prefix Information\n   Note that in IPv6, an attacker would\
    \ not be able to search across the\n   entire IPv6 address space as they might\
    \ in IPv4.  An attacker may\n   learn general prefixes to focus their efforts\
    \ on by observing route\n   view information (e.g., from public looking-glass\
    \ services) or\n   information on allocated address space from Regional Internet\n\
    \   Registries (RIRs).  In general, this would only yield information at\n   most\
    \ at the /48 prefix granularity, though some specific /64 prefixes\n   may be\
    \ observed from route views on some parts of some networks.\n"
- title: 3.2.  DNS Advertised Hosts
  contents:
  - "3.2.  DNS Advertised Hosts\n   Any servers that are DNS listed, e.g., MX mail\
    \ relays, or web\n   servers, will remain open to probing from the very fact that\
    \ their\n   IPv6 addresses will be published in the DNS.\n   While servers are\
    \ relatively easy to find because they are DNS-\n   published, any systems that\
    \ are not DNS-published will be much harder\n   to locate via traditional scanning\
    \ than is the case for IPv4\n   networks.  It is worth noting that where a site\
    \ uses sequential host\n   numbering, publishing just one address may lead to\
    \ a threat upon the\n   other hosts.\n"
- title: 3.3.  DNS Zone Transfers
  contents:
  - "3.3.  DNS Zone Transfers\n   In the IPv6 world, a DNS zone transfer is much more\
    \ likely to narrow\n   the number of hosts an attacker needs to target.  This\
    \ implies that\n   restricting zone transfers is (more) important for IPv6, even\
    \ if it\n   is already good practice to restrict them in the IPv4 world.\n   There\
    \ are some projects that provide Internet mapping data from\n   access to such\
    \ transfers.  Administrators may of course agree to\n   provide such transfers\
    \ where they choose to do so.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Log File Analysis
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Log File Analysis\n   IPv6 addresses may be harvested from recorded logs,\
    \ such as web site\n   logs.  Anywhere else where IPv6 addresses are explicitly\
    \ recorded may\n   prove a useful channel for an attacker, e.g., by inspection\
    \ of the\n   (many) Received from: or other header lines in archived email or\n\
    \   Usenet news messages.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Application Participation
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Application Participation\n   More recent peer-to-peer applications often\
    \ include some centralised\n   server that coordinates the transfer of data between\
    \ peers.  The\n   BitTorrent application builds swarms of nodes that exchange\
    \ chunks of\n   files, with a tracker passing information about peers with available\n\
    \   chunks of data between the peers.  Such applications may offer an\n   attacker\
    \ a source of peer IP addresses to probe.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Multicast Group Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Multicast Group Addresses\n   Where an Embedded Rendezvous Point (RP) [7]\
    \ multicast group address\n   is known, the unicast address of the RP is implied\
    \ by the group\n   address.  Where unicast-prefix-based multicast group addresses\
    \ [5]\n   are used, specific /64 link prefixes may also be disclosed in traffic\n\
    \   that goes off-site.  An administrator may thus choose to put aside\n   /64\
    \ bit prefixes for multicast group addresses that are not in use\n   for normal\
    \ unicast routing and addressing.  Alternatively, a site may\n   simply use their\
    \ non-specific /48 site prefix allocation to generate\n   RFC3306 multicast group\
    \ addresses.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Transition Methods
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Transition Methods\n   Specific knowledge of the target network may be\
    \ gleaned if that\n   attacker knows it is using 6to4 [4], ISATAP [10], Teredo\
    \ [11], or\n   other techniques that derive low-order bits from IPv4 addresses\n\
    \   (though in this case, unless they are using IPv4 NAT, the IPv4\n   addresses\
    \ may be probed anyway).\n   For example, the current Microsoft 6to4 implementation\
    \ uses the\n   address 2002:V4ADDR::V4ADDR while older Linux and FreeBSD\n   implementations\
    \ default to 2002:V4ADDR::1.  This leads to specific\n   knowledge of specific\
    \ hosts in the network.  Given one host in the\n   network is observed as using\
    \ a given transition technique, it is\n   likely that there are more.\n   In the\
    \ case of Teredo, the 64-bit node identifier is generated from\n   the IPv4 address\
    \ observed at a Teredo server along with a UDP port\n   number.  The Teredo specification\
    \ also allows for discovery of other\n   Teredo clients on the same IPv4 subnet\

- title: 5.  Tools to Mitigate Scanning Attacks
  contents:
  - "5.  Tools to Mitigate Scanning Attacks\n   There are some tools that site administrators\
    \ can apply to make the\n   task for IPv6 network scanning attackers harder. \
    \ These methods arise\n   from the considerations in the previous section.\n \
    \  The author notes that at his current (university) site, there is no\n   evidence\
    \ of general network scanning running across subnets.\n   However, there is network\
    \ scanning over IPv6 connections to systems\n   whose IPv6 addresses are advertised\
    \ (DNS servers, MX relays, web\n   servers, etc.), which are presumably looking\
    \ for other open ports on\n   these hosts to probe further.  At the time of writing,\
    \ DHCPv6 [6] is\n   not yet in use at the author's site, and clients use stateless\n\
    \   autoconfiguration.  Therefore, the author's site does not yet have\n   sequentially\
    \ numbered client hosts deployed as may typically be seen\n   in today's IPv4\
    \ DHCP-served networks.\n"
- title: 5.1.  IPv6 Privacy Addresses
  contents:
  - "5.1.  IPv6 Privacy Addresses\n   Hosts in a network using IPv6 privacy extensions\
    \ [3] will typically\n   only connect to external systems using their current\
    \ (temporary)\n   privacy address.  The precise behaviour of a host with a stable\n\
    \   global address and one or more dynamic privacy address(es) when\n   selecting\
    \ a source address to use may be operating-system-specific,\n   or configurable,\
    \ but typical behaviour when initiating a connection\n   is use of a privacy address\
    \ when available.\n   While an attacker may be able to port scan a privacy address,\
    \ if they\n   do so quickly upon observing or otherwise learning of the address,\n\
    \   the threat or risk is reduced due to the time-constrained value of\n   the\
    \ address.  One implementation of RFC 4941 already deployed has\n   privacy addresses\
    \ active (used by the node) for one day, with such\n   addresses reachable for\
    \ seven days.\n   Note that an RFC 4941 host will usually also have a separate\
    \ static\n   global IPv6 address by which it can also be reached, and that may\
    \ be\n   DNS-advertised if an externally reachable service is running on it.\n\
    \   DHCPv6 can be used to serve normal global addresses and IPv6 privacy\n   addresses.\n\
    \   The implication is that while privacy addresses can mitigate the\n   long-term\
    \ value of harvested addresses, an attacker creating an IPv6\n   application server\
    \ to which clients connect will still be able to\n   probe the clients by their\
    \ privacy address when they visit that\n   server.  The duration for which privacy\
    \ addresses are valid will\n   impact the usefulness of such observed addresses\
    \ to an external\n   attacker.  For example, a worm that may spread using such\
    \ observed\n   addresses may be less effective if it relies on harvested privacy\n\
    \   addresses.  The frequency with which such address get recycled could\n   be\
    \ increased, though this may increase the complexity of local\n   network management\
    \ for the administrator, since doing so will cause\n   more addresses to be used\
    \ over time in the site.\n   A further option here may be to consider using different\
    \ addresses\n   for specific applications, or even each new application instance,\n\
    \   which may reduce exposure to other services running on the same host\n   when\
    \ such an address is observed externally.\n"

  - "6.  Conclusions\n   Due to the much larger size of IPv6 subnets in comparison\
    \ to IPv4, it\n   will become less feasible for traditional network scanning methods\
    \ to\n   detect open services for subsequent attacks, assuming the attackers\n\
    \   are off-site and services are not listed in the DNS.  If\n   administrators\
    \ number their IPv6 subnets in 'random', non-predictable\n   ways, attackers,\
    \ whether they be in the form of automated network\n   scanners or dynamic worm\
    \ propagation, will need to make wider use of\n   new methods to determine IPv6\
    \ host addresses to target (e.g., looking\n   to obtain logs of activity from\
    \ a site and scanning addresses around\n   the ones observed).  Such numbering\
    \ schemes may be very low cost to\n   deploy in comparison to conventional sequential\
    \ numbering, and thus,\n   a useful part of an overall defence-in-depth strategy.\
    \  Of course, if\n   those systems are dual-stack, and have open IPv4 services\
    \ running,\n   they will remain exposed to traditional probes over IPv4 transport.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are no specific security considerations\
    \ in this document\n   outside of the topic of discussion itself.  However, it\
    \ must be noted\n   that the 'security through obscurity' discussions and commentary\n\
    \   within this text must be noted in their proper context.  Relying\n   purely\
    \ on obscurity of a node address is not prudent, rather the\n   advice here should\
    \ be considered as part of a 'defence-in-depth'\n   approach to security for a\
    \ site or network.  This also implies that\n   these measures require coordination\
    \ between network administrators\n   and those who maintain DNS services, though\
    \ this is common in most\n   scenarios.\n"
