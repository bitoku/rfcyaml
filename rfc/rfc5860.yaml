  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see [9]\
    \ and [1]),\n   the rationales for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\
    \ (OAM)\n   are twofold as it can serve:\n   o  as a network-oriented functionality,\
    \ used by a transport network\n      operator to monitor his network infrastructure\
    \ and to implement\n      internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general\
    \ behavior and\n      the level of performance of his network (e.g., protection\n\
    \      mechanism in case of node or link failure).  As an example, fault\n   \
    \   localization is typically associated with this use case.\n   o  as a service-oriented\
    \ functionality, used by a transport service\n      provider to monitor services\
    \ offered to end customers in order to\n      be able to react rapidly in case\
    \ of a problem and to be able to\n      verify some of the Service Level Agreement\
    \ (SLA) parameters (e.g.,\n      using performance monitoring) negotiated with\
    \ the end customers.\n      Note that a transport service could be provided over\
    \ several\n      networks or administrative domains that may not all be owned\
    \ and\n      managed by the same transport service provider.\n   More generally,\
    \ OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in\n   transport networks\
    \ as it contributes to:\n   o  the reduction of operational complexity and costs,\
    \ by allowing for\n      efficient and automatic detection, localization, and\
    \ handling and\n      diagnosis of defects, as well as by minimizing service\n\
    \      interruptions and operational repair times.\n   o  the enhancement of network\
    \ availability, by ensuring that defects\n      (for example, those resulting\
    \ in misdirected customer traffic) and\n      faults are detected, diagnosed,\
    \ and dealt with before a customer\n      reports the problem.\n   o  meeting\
    \ service and performance objectives, as the OAM\n      functionality allows for\
    \ SLA verification in a multi-maintenance\n      domain environment and allows\
    \ for the determination of service\n      degradation due, for example, to packet\
    \ delay or packet loss.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope of This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope of This Document\n   This document lists architectural and functional\
    \ requirements for the\n   OAM functionality of MPLS-TP.  These requirements apply\
    \ to\n   pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and Sections.\n   These\
    \ requirements are derived from the set of requirements specified\n   by ITU-T\
    \ and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 [10].\n   By covering transport\
    \ specificities, these requirements complement\n   those identified in RFC 4377\
    \ [11]; yet, some requirements may be\n   similar.\n   This document only lists\
    \ architectural and functional OAM\n   requirements.  It does not detail the implications\
    \ of their\n   applicability to the various types (e.g., point-to-point, point-to-\n\
    \   multipoint, unidirectional, bidirectional, etc.) of PWs, LSPs, and\n   Sections.\
    \  Furthermore, this document does not provide requirements\n   on how the protocol\
    \ solution(s) should behave to achieve the\n   functional objectives.  Please\
    \ see [12] for further information.\n   Note that the OAM functions identified\
    \ in this document may be used\n   for fault-management, performance-monitoring,\
    \ and/or protection-\n   switching applications.  For example, connectivity verification\
    \ can\n   be used for fault management by detecting failure conditions, but may\n\
    \   also be used for performance monitoring through its contribution to\n   the\
    \ evaluation of performance metrics (e.g., unavailability time).\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ it is outside the scope of this document to specify\n   which function should\
    \ be used for which application.\n   Note also that it is anticipated that implementers\
    \ may wish to\n   implement OAM message handling in hardware.  Although not a\n\
    \   requirement, this fact could be taken as a design consideration.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements Language and Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements Language and Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119 [2].\n   Although this document is not a protocol specification,\
    \ the use of\n   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers\n\
    \   producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this\n   document.\n\
    \   In this document, we:\n   o  refer to the inability of a function to perform\
    \ a required action\n      as a fault.  This does not include an inability due\
    \ to preventive\n      maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions.\
    \  See\n      also ITU-T G.806 [3].\n   o  refer to the situation in which the\
    \ density of anomalies has\n      reached a level where the ability to perform\
    \ a required function\n      has been interrupted as a defect.  See also ITU-T\
    \ G.806 [3].\n   o  refer to OAM actions that are carried out continuously or\
    \ at least\n      over long periods of time, permitting proactive reporting of\
    \ fault\n      and/or performance results as proactive OAM.\n   o  refer to OAM\
    \ actions that are initiated via manual intervention\n      for a limited time\
    \ to carry out troubleshooting as on-demand OAM.\n   o  refer to a Label Edge\
    \ Router (LER), for a given LSP or Section,\n      and to a PW Terminating Provider\
    \ Edge (T-PE), for a given PW, as\n      an End Point.  Further, we refer to a\
    \ Label Switching Router\n      (LSR), for a given LSP, and to a PW Switching\
    \ Provider Edge\n      (S-PE), for a given PW, as an Intermediate Point.  This\
    \ document\n      does not make a distinction between End Points (e.g., source\
    \ and\n      destination) as it can be inferred from the context of the\n    \
    \  sentences.\n   o  use the term \"node\" as a general reference to End Points\
    \ and\n      Intermediate Points.\n   o  refer to both segment and concatenated\
    \ segments as segments (see\n      [1] for definitions relating to the term \"\
    segment\" as well as for\n      other definitions relating to MPLS-TP).\n   o\
    \  refer to both single segment PWs and multi-segment PWs as PWs.\n   o  refer\
    \ to both bidirectional associated LSPs and bidirectional co-\n      routed LSPs\
    \ as bidirectional LSPs.\n"
- title: 2.  OAM Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  OAM Requirements\n   This section lists the requirements by which the OAM\
    \ functionality of\n   MPLS-TP should abide.\n   The requirements listed below\
    \ may be met by one or more OAM\n   protocols; the definition or selection of\
    \ these protocols is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   RFC 5654 [1]\
    \ states (Requirement #2) that the MPLS-TP design, SHOULD\n   as far as reasonably\
    \ possible, reuse existing MPLS standards.  This\n   general requirement applies\
    \ to MPLS-TP OAM.  MPLS-TP OAM is defined\n   in this document through a set of\
    \ functional requirements.  These\n   requirements will be met by protocol solutions\
    \ defined in other\n   documents.  The way in which those protocols are operated\
    \ and the way\n   in which a network operator can control and use the MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM\n   functions SHOULD be as similar as possible to the mechanisms and\n \
    \  techniques used to operate OAM in other transport technologies.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  Scope of OAM
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Scope of OAM\n   The protocol solution(s) developed to meet the requirements\n\
    \   identified in this document MUST at least be applicable to point-to-\n   point\
    \ bidirectional PWs, point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSPs,\n   and point-to-point\
    \ bidirectional Sections.  Section 2.2 provides\n   additional information with\
    \ regard to the applicability to point-to-\n   point associated bidirectional\
    \ LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional\n   LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs.\n\
    \   The service emulated by a PW may span multiple domains.  An LSP may\n   also\
    \ span multiple domains.  The protocol solution(s) MUST be\n   applicable to end-to-end\
    \ and to segments.  More generally, it MUST be\n   possible to operate OAM functions\
    \ on a per-domain basis and across\n   multiple domains.\n   Since LSPs may be\
    \ stacked, the protocol solution(s) MUST be\n   applicable on any LSP, regardless\
    \ of the label stack depth.\n   Furthermore, it MUST be possible to estimate OAM\
    \ fault and\n   performance metrics of a single PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate\n\
    \   of PW or LSP segments.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Independence
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Independence\n   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the\
    \ underlying\n   tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.\n\
    \   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a PW\n   may\
    \ emulate.\n   Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP, or Section SHOULD be\n\
    \   independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP,\n   or\
    \ Section.  In other words, only the OAM functions operated on a\n   given LSP\
    \ (for example) should be used to achieve the OAM objectives\n   for that LSP.\n\
    \   The protocol solution(s) MUST support the capability to be\n   concurrently\
    \ and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.\n   Therefore, any OAM\
    \ function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP\n   SHOULD be independent of the\
    \ OAM function(s) operated on the end-to-\n   end PW or LSP.  It SHOULD also be\
    \ possible to distinguish an OAM\n   packet running over a segment of a PW or\
    \ LSP from another OAM packet\n   running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP\n   SHOULD be independent\
    \ of the OAM function(s) applied to other\n   segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.\n\
    \      Note: Independence should not be understood in terms of isolation\n   \
    \   as there can be interactions between OAM functions operated, for\n      example,\
    \ on two different LSPs.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Data Plane
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Data Plane\n   OAM functions operate in the data plane.  OAM packets\
    \ MUST run in-\n   band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP, or Section\
    \ MUST\n   follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW, LSP, or\n\
    \   Section.  This is often referred to as fate sharing.\n   It MUST be possible\
    \ to discriminate user traffic from OAM packets.\n   This includes a means to\
    \ differentiate OAM packets from user traffic\n   as well as the capability to\
    \ apply specific treatment to OAM packets,\n   at the nodes processing these OAM\
    \ packets.\n   As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP,\
    \ a\n   mechanism for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM\n\
    \   messages on a PW, LSP, or Section, MUST be provided.  Such mechanism\n   SHOULD\

    \ PW OAM messages.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  OAM and IP Capabilities
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  OAM and IP Capabilities\n   There are environments where IP capabilities\
    \ are present in the data\n   plane.  IP/MPLS environments are examples of such\
    \ environments.\n   There are also environments where IP capabilities may not\
    \ be present\n   in the data plane.  MPLS-TP environments are examples of environments\n\
    \   where IP capabilities might or might not be present.\n      Note: Presence\
    \ or absence of IP capabilities is deployment\n      scenario dependent.\n   It\
    \ MUST be possible to deploy the OAM functionality in any of these\n   environments.\
    \  As a result, it MUST be possible to operate OAM\n   functions with or without\
    \ relying on IP capabilities, and it MUST be\n   possible to choose to make use\
    \ of IP capabilities when these are\n   present.\n   Furthermore, the mechanism\
    \ required for enabling the encapsulation\n   and differentiation of OAM messages\
    \ (see Section 2.1.3) MUST support\n   the capability to differentiate OAM messages\
    \ of an OAM function\n   operated by relying on IP capabilities (e.g., using encapsulation\
    \ in\n   an IP header) from OAM messages of an OAM function operated without\n\
    \   relying on any IP capability.\n   Note that IP capabilities include the capability\
    \ to form a standard\n   IP header, to encapsulate a payload in an IP header,\
    \ to parse and\n   analyze the fields of an IP header, and to take actions based\
    \ on the\n   content of these fields.\n   For certain functions, OAM messages\
    \ need to incorporate\n   identification information (e.g., of source and/or destination\n\
    \   nodes).  The protocol solution(s) MUST at least support\n   identification\
    \ information in the form of an IP addressing structure\n   and MUST also be extensible\

    \ and encryption in place.  This will\n   prevent unauthorized access to MPLS-TP\
    \ equipment and it will prevent\n   third parties from learning about sensitive\
    \ information about the\n   transport network.\n   OAM systems (network management\
    \ stations) SHOULD be designed such\n   that OAM functions cannot be accessed\
    \ without authorization.\n   OAM protocol solutions MUST include the facility\
    \ for OAM messages to\n   authenticated to prove their origin and to make sure\
    \ that they are\n   destined for the receiving node.  The use of such facilities\
    \ MUST be\n   configurable.\n   An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP, or Section\
    \ MUST NOT be\n   forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP, or Section,\
