  - "Abstract\n   This document defines an additional mode of the link-layer assisted\n\
    \   RObust Header Compression (ROHC) profile, also known as the zero-byte\n  \
    \ profile, beyond the two defined in RFC 3242.  Zero-byte header\n   compression\
    \ exists in order to prevent the single-octet ROHC header\n   from pushing a packet\
    \ voice stream into the next higher fixed packet\n   size for the radio.  It is\
    \ usable in certain widely deployed older\n   air interfaces.  This document adds\
    \ the zero-byte operation for ROHC\n   Bidirectional Reliable mode (R-mode) to\
    \ the ones specified for\n   Unidirectional (U-mode) and Bidirectional Optimistic\
    \ (O-mode) modes\n   of header compression in RFC 3242.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3242] defines a zero-byte solution for compression of\
    \ IP/UDP/RTP\n   packets only for Unidirectional (U-) and Bidirectional Optimistic\n\
    \   (O-) modes [RFC3095].  The present specification extends the profile\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC3242] to provide zero-byte support for Bidirectional\n   Reliable (R-)\
    \ mode.  This specification and [RFC3242] allow a\n   header-free packet format\
    \ to be used in all modes to replace the\n   majority of the 1-octet headers of\
    \ ROHC RTP packets sent during\n   normal operation.  Specifically, the compressor\
    \ operating in R-mode\n   is allowed to deliver a No-Header Packet (NHP) when\
    \ [RFC3242] would\n   have required it to deliver a ROHC Reliable Packet Type\
    \ Zero (R-0)\n   packet [RFC3095].\n   For simplification, this profile is defined\
    \ in the form of the\n   additions and exceptions to [RFC3242] that are required\
    \ to extend the\n   RFC 3242 profile with zero-byte support for R-mode.  All terminology\n\
    \   used in this document is the same as in [RFC3242].\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.2.  Additional interface, assisting layer to compressor\n   To improve the\
    \ compression efficiency of this profile in some\n   specific cases, e.g., when\
    \ the AL operates in such a way that it\n   often becomes unsafe to send NHPs,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED to implement\n   this additional interface.  Here, the word\
    \ \"unsafe\" means that the\n   compressor allows the AL to send NHP but the AL\
    \ cannot guarantee that\n   the RTP SN of the NHP will be correctly decompressed\
    \ at the receiving\n   side.  The interface is used to carry update_request as\
    \ described in\n   section 3.  Note that this interface is not required in the\
    \ sense\n   that the impossibility of implementing such an interface should not\n\
    \   be an obstacle to implement this profile over a specific link.\n"
- title: 3.  R-mode operation
  contents:
  - "3.  R-mode operation\n   For the R-mode, this profile extends ROHC RTP by performing\
    \ a mapping\n   of the R-0 packet to the NHP packet.  Note that R-0 is the only\
    \ type\n   of packets in R-mode that can be replaced with NHP.\n   On the receiving\
    \ side, the RTP SN of an NHP is determined by the\n   decompressor as = SN_Ref_D\
    \ + Offset_D, where SN_Ref_D is the RTP SN\n   of the last update packet received\
    \ by the decompressor, and Offset_D\n   the sequence number offset between the\
    \ NHP and the last update\n   packet.  How to derive Offset_D depends on the implementation\
    \ of this\n   profile over a specific link technology and must be specified in\
    \ the\n   implementation document(s).  For example, it can be calculated by\n\
    \   counting the total number of non-context-updating packets (including\n   NHPs)\
    \ and packet loss indications received since the last successful\n   context update.\
    \  Alternatively, it can be derived using the link\n   timing in the case where\
    \ the linear mapping between RTP SN and link\n   timing is maintained.\n   On\
    \ the transmitting side, the AL follows the same rule defined in\n   section 4.1.1\
    \ of [RFC3242] to determine whether it can send NHP or\n   not, with one modification.\
    \  That is, when the AL determines that it\n   has become unsafe (see section\
    \ 2.2) to send NHPs, the AL records the\n   corresponding RTP SN as SN_break.\
    \  Then it waits until the rule is\n   satisfied again and SN_ACKed > SN_break\
    \ before it resumes sending\n   NHPs.  The latter condition is essentially the\
    \ counterpart of\n   optimistic approach agreement [RFC3242, section 4.3] of U/O-mode\n\
    \   which states that when the AL in U/O-mode determines it is unsafe to\n   send\
    \ NHP, it must send headers in the subsequent X packets, where X\n   is some agreed\
    \ number.  There are two reasons for the difference: a)\n   R-mode relies on acknowledgements\
    \ to synchronize contexts, instead of\n   optimistic approach principle as in\
    \ U/O-mode; and b) R-0 packets do\n   not update decompressor context while UO-0\
    \ packets do.  To meet the\n   condition SN_ACKed > SN_break, the AL can either\
    \ wait passively for\n   the compressor to send a context update packet (e.g.,\
    \ R-0-CRC\n   triggered by 6-bit SN wrap-around), or send an update_request via\
    \ the\n   interface from AL to the compressor (section 2.2) to request the\n \
    \  compressor to send a context updating packet.  The update_request\n   carries\
    \ the last SN_break.  Upon receiving an update_request, the\n   compressor SHOULD\
    \ use a context updating packet (e.g. R-0-CRC) when\n   sending the next packet.\
    \  Context updating packets are handled as in\n   [RFC3095].\n   Note: the passive\
    \ waiting as described above might take a long time\n   in the worst case, during\
    \ which NHPs cannot be sent.  Therefore,\n   sending update_request via the optional\
    \ AL to compressor interface is\n   RECOMMENDED to improve the worst case performance.\n\
    \   Note: the update_request may be lost if the AL and compressor are at\n   different\
    \ locations and the channel between them is unreliable, but\n   such a loss only\
    \ delays the AL from resuming sending NHP.  Therefore,\n   how frequent the AL\
    \ sends update_request is an implementation issue.\n   For example, the AL may\
    \ send one update_request for each packet it\n   receives from the compressor\
    \ until the conditions to send NHP are\n   met.\n   Note: as no CRC field is present\
    \ in R-0 packets, only the function\n   related to RTP SN and packet type identifier\
    \ needs to be replaced.\n   In addition, NHP packets and packet loss indications\
    \ in R-mode do not\n   update either the compressor or the decompressor context\
    \ (as opposed\n   to U/O-mode).  Consequently, the secure reference principle\
    \ [RFC3095,\n   section 5.5] is not affected in any way and there is no loss of\n\
    \   robustness in this profile compared to ROHC RTP.\n"
- title: 4.  Differences between R-mode and U/O-mode
  contents:
  - "4.  Differences between R-mode and U/O-mode\n   This section clarifies some differences\
    \ between R-mode and U/O-mode\n   in this profile.\n   a) CRC replacement\n  \
    \    Unlike U/O-mode, CRC replacement [RFC3242, section 3.3] is not an\n     \
    \ issue for R-mode since R-0 packets do not carry CRC field.\n   b) Periodic context\
    \ verification\n      For U/O-mode, periodic context verification [RFC3242, section\
    \ 4.6]\n      is RECOMMENDED to provide additional protection against damage\n\
    \      propagation after CRC is replaced.  For R-mode, since there is no\n   \
    \   CRC replacement (see above), no change to ROHC RTP is needed in\n      this\
    \ regard.  In particular, R-mode has this feature naturally\n      built-in, since\
    \ the sending of R-0-CRC when 6-bit SN wraps around\n      implicitly provides\
    \ periodic context verification for R-mode.\n   c) CV-REQUEST option\n      For\
    \ the same reasons as above, the decompressor operating in R-\n      mode SHOULD\
    \ NOT send CV-REQUEST [RFC3242, section 4.5] to\n      compressor.  This is to\
    \ avoid unnecessary overhead on the feedback\n      channel.\n   d) Context Check\
    \ Packet (CCP)\n      When CCP [RFC3242, section 4.1.3] is used, compressor operating\
    \ in\n      R-mode SHOULD set C-bit to 0 (zero) and not generate 7-bit CRC if\n\
    \      computation cost at compressor and decompressor causes concern.\n     \
    \ The use of the CRC field in CCP to perform decompressor context\n      verification\
    \ is not critical in R-mode (see last note of section 3\n      and item b) above).\n\
    \   e) Handling of Acknowledgements (ACKs)\n      Special care in the realization\
    \ of ACKs should be taken for R-mode\n      implementations.  It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to avoid the use of\n      interspersed feedback packets [RFC3095, section 5.2.1]\
    \ to carry\n      ACK information.  The reason is that interspersed feedback packets\n\
    \      will interrupt the RTP SN sequencing and thus temporarily disable\n   \
    \   the sending of NHPs.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of ROHC RTP [RFC3095,\

    \ a denial-of-\n   service attack scenario where an intruder injects bogus CCP\
    \ packets\n   onto the link using random CRC values, the CRC check will fail for\n\
    \   incorrect reasons at the decompressor side.  This would obviously\n   greatly\
    \ reduce the advantages of ROHC and any extra efficiency\n   provided by this\
    \ profile due to unnecessary context invalidation,\n   feedback messages and refresh\
    \ packets.  However, the same remarks\n   related to the presence of such an intruder\
    \ apply.\n"
