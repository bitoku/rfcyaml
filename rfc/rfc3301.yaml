  - "1. Introduction\n   L2TP [RFC2661] defines the procedures for tunneling PPP sessions\n\
    \   between a so called L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and an L2TP\n   Network\
    \ Server (LNS).  The main focus of [RFC2661] is on supporting\n   HDLC based ISDN/PSTN\
    \ access networks.\n   This document augments the procedures described in [RFC2661]\
    \ to\n   further support ATM SVC or PVC based access networks.  Support for\n\
    \   ATM access networks requires extensions to the present L2TP\n   procedures\
    \ so as to cope with :\n   (a) the traffic management aspects of ATM connections\
    \ (e.g.\n       asymmetric bandwidth allocation and service category selection\n\
    \       capabilities),\n   (b) the addressing format to be used in switched ATM\
    \ networks [AESA]\n       and\n   (c) the limitations imposed on LCP negotiation\
    \ by transporting PPP\n       over AAL5 over the access network segment of the\
    \ PPP connection\n       [RFC2364].\n   Within this document, the necessary extensions\
    \ to [RFC2661] are\n   defined to cope with issues (a) and (b), issue (c) which\
    \ is not\n   specific to ATM may be solved as described in [L2TP_link].\n"

    \ is to extend L2TP support to allow for user / LAC\n   communication based on\
    \ ATM access network technology.\n"
- title: 2.2 Connection Establishment
  contents:
  - "2.2 Connection Establishment\n   Due to the wide variety of existing signalling\
    \ protocols and ATM\n   service categories, and their support or non-support within\
    \ ATM based\n   access networks, this document takes as approach to provide for\
    \ a\n   flexible identification of ATM connection characteristics while\n   establishing\
    \ outgoing and incoming L2TP calls.  The procedures as\n   defined within this\
    \ document allow the allocation of asymmetric\n   bandwidth and service category\
    \ selection in terms of real or non-real\n   time requirements on the ATM portion\
    \ of the access network.\n   As such, the detailed signalling protocol specific\
    \ information\n   elements that are necessary for switched VC service, are explicitly\n\
    \   not negotiated during call establishment over the L2TP tunnel.\n   In order\
    \ to identify the endpoint of the ATM connection within the\n   ATM access network,\
    \ SVCs can be established on the basis of the ATM\n   end system addressing format\
    \ [AESA].  For PVC based services, the PVC\n   can either be referred to by using\
    \ the ATM end system addressing\n   procedure (Called/Calling Number), or by making\
    \ use of a textual name\n   (Service Name).  The latter is inspired by the procedures\
    \ defined\n   within [Auto_PVC].\n"

  - "2.3 LCP negotiation\n   The procedures described within this document may be\
    \ combined with\n   the procedures described in [L2TP_link] to limit LCP negotiation\n\

    \ relative to [RFC2661].\n"
- title: 3.1 ATM connectivity
  contents:
  - "3.1 ATM connectivity\n   Prior to initiating the PPP protocol layer, a Virtual\
    \ Connection (VC)\n   MUST be established between the user and the Network Access\
    \ Server\n   (LAC).  This virtual connection MAY either be a preconfigured\n \
    \  Permanent VC(PVC), where the access network provider, NAS and user\n   agree\
    \ beforehand on the characteristics of the PVC, or MAY be an on-\n   demand switched\
    \ VC(SVC), where the negotiation between user, network\n   and NAS takes place\
    \ by means of an ATM signalling protocol.  Note\n   that for establishing PVCs,\
    \ alternative use may be made of the\n   procedures as described in [Auto_PVC].\n\
    \   In both cases, the user is referred to as the virtual dial-in user.\n   Prior\
    \ to accepting the switched connection from the virtual dial-in\n   user, the\
    \ LAC MAY check with the LNS whether the call should be\n   accepted.  In the\
    \ latter situation, the LAC MAY determine based upon\n   parameters available\
    \ within the call establishment message that this\n   concerns a virtual dial\
    \ in user, or MAY undertake a partial\n   authentication of the end system/user,\
    \ in order to bind the end\n   system/user with a specific LNS.\n   For PVC based\
    \ users, the LAC MAY be triggered by the arrival of an\n   LCP Configure Request,\
    \ or PPP Authentication request message from the\n   virtual dial-in user to initiate\
    \ conversation with the LNS.  Note\n   that the exact timing of triggering communication\
    \ between LAC and LNS\n   is outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 3.2 Tunnel establishment
  contents:
  - "3.2 Tunnel establishment\n   If no tunnel connection currently exists to the\
    \ desired LNS, one is\n   initiated.  During the tunnel establishment, LNS and\
    \ LAC indicate\n   bearer and framing capabilities to each other, according to\
    \ normal\n   procedures.\n   The bearer capability is extended to allow the LAC\
    \ to indicate its\n   support of ATM bearer devices.  Positive receipt of this\
    \ indication,\n   allows both LAC and LNS to use the extensions as defined within\
    \ this\n   document to support ATM based incoming and outgoing calls.\n   If no\
    \ compatibility between LNS and LAC exists according to the\n   extensions defined\
    \ within this document, no tunnel establishment can\n   take place.  This would\
    \ be because the LAC does not support any\n   bearer capability which is expected\
    \ by the LNS (e.g., an ATM based\n   LAC, that only signals the \"Broadband\"\
    \ Bearer Capability), or vice\n   versa.  It is however encouraged that LAC or\
    \ LNS implementations\n   would allow for seamless interworking with peer devices\
    \ which do not\n   implement the extensions defined within this document.  This\
    \ could be\n   implemented by allowing a graceful fallback to digital bearer\n\
    \   capability.\n"

- title: 3.3.1 Incoming Call Establishment
  contents:
  - "3.3.1 Incoming Call Establishment\n   The ATM connection between the virtual\
    \ Dial-in user and LAC MAY\n   either be dynamically or statically established.\
    \  When the VC\n   connection is dynamically established (Switched VC), the LAC\
    \ will\n   receive a SETUP message over the interface that connects it to the\n\
    \   ATM network.  This specification does not assume any specific\n   interface\
    \ type (UNI or NNI).  Permanent VC connections MAY either be\n   manually configured,\
    \ or configured by use of the extensions to the\n   ILMI procedures as defined\
    \ by [Auto_PVC].\n   For switched VC connections, the LAC MAY select the peer\
    \ LNS on the\n   basis of connection establishment information, or by allowing\
    \ partial\n   PPP authentication of the virtual Dial-in user.  The connection\n\
    \   establishment information that can be used by the LAC include Called\n   Party\
    \ AESA, Called Party AESA Subaddress, Calling Party AESA or\n   Calling Party\
    \ AESA Subaddress.\n   For Permanent VC connections, the LAC MAY be triggered\
    \ by (a) the\n   establishment of the PVC, (b) by an LCP configure request, (c)\
    \ by\n   partially authenticating the virtual Dial-in user, or (d) by means\n\
    \   outside the scope of this specification.\n   Within the ICRQ, the LAC MUST\
    \ indicate a broadband bearer in the\n   Bearer Type AVP (B bit set to 1), MAY\
    \ include the Service Category\n   AVP, and MAY include the Service Name AVP.\
    \  If the LNS would not\n   support the B Bearer bit, it will return an error\
    \ on the ICRQ\n   message.  In such a case, the implementation MAY decide to fall\
    \ back\n   to digital bearer capability, and SHOULD refrain from using the\n \
    \  extensions defined within this document.  Further, the ICRQ message\n   MAY\
    \ contain the VPI/VCI identifier AVP.  This identifier can further\n   be used\
    \ at the LNS for management purposes next to or alternative to\n   the Physical\
    \ Channel ID AVP.\n   Within the ICCN, both Tx Connect Speed AVP and Rx Connect\
    \ Speed\n   SHOULD be used if an asymetric connection has been established.\n"
- title: 3.3.2 Outgoing Call Establishment
  contents:
  - "3.3.2 Outgoing Call Establishment\n   Within an OCRQ, the LNS MUST indicate to\
    \ the LAC minimum and maximum\n   speeds for receive and transmit traffic (from\
    \ the LAC perspective).\n   This is to allow for the bi-directional asymmetric\
    \ nature of ATM\n   traffic contracts.  Note that in order to support UBR connections\n\
    \   between LAC and user, the Minimum BPS MUST be set to zero.\n   Further during\
    \ OCRQ, the LNS MAY include the required Service\n   Category AVP, i.e., indicating\
    \ real time (rt) or non-real time (nrt)\n   transport services.  The combination\
    \ of minimum and maximum receive\n   and transmit speed, and the indication of\
    \ the required service\n   category allows the LAC to establish an ATM connection\
    \ according to\n   its own capabilities, and the ATM access network capabilities,\n\
    \   however within the service requirement for the PPP layer.\n   Real time connectivity\
    \ can be provided by either CBR or rt-VBR ATM\n   service categories, non-real\
    \ time connectivity can be provided by\n   UBR, nrt-VBR, ABR or GFR ATM service\
    \ categories.\n   Further the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC in OCRQ message the\
    \ called\n   number according to the format described in this document (NSAP\n\
    \   format).  When the called number carries an all zero payload, the LAC\n  \
    \ SHOULD look at the Service Name AVP to bind the tunnel call to an ATM\n   VC\
    \ connection.\n   Next to the normal AVPs, the OCRP message MAY contain the VPI/VCI\n\
    \   identifier AVP.  This identifier can further be used at the LNS for\n   management\
    \ purposes next to or alternative to the Physical Channel ID\n   AVP.\n"

    \ with certain ATM traffic parameters.  This authorization may be\n   performed\
