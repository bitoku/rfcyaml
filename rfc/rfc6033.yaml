- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the conventions for using several\n\
    \   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\n   encrypted\
    \ key package content type [RFC6032].  Specifically, it\n   includes conventions\
    \ necessary to implement the following CMS content\n   types: EnvelopedData [RFC5652],\
    \ EncryptedData [RFC5652], and\n   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].\n   This document\
    \ does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers\n   to previously defined\
    \ algorithms.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  EnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "2.  EnvelopedData\n   EnvelopedData [RFC5652] supports a number of key management\n\
    \   techniques.  Implementations that claim conformance to this document\n   MUST\
    \ support the key transport mechanisms and SHOULD support the key\n   agreement\
    \ mechanisms as defined below.  Other techniques MAY be\n   supported.\n   When\
    \ key transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be\n   supported and RSA\
    \ Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption\n   Padding (RSAES-OAEP) [RFC3560]\
    \ SHOULD be supported.\n   When key agreement is used, Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman\
    \ (DH)\n   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.\n   Since the content type is used to\
    \ carry a cryptographic key and its\n   attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally\
    \ used to encrypt one\n   key with another is employed.  Regardless of the key\
    \ management\n   technique choice, implementations MUST support AES-128 Key Wrap\
    \ with\n   Padding [RFC5649] as the content-encryption algorithm.\n   Implementations\
    \ SHOULD support AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding\n   [RFC5649] as the content-encryption\
    \ algorithm.\n   When key agreement is used, a key wrap algorithm is also specified\
    \ to\n   wrap the content-encryption key.  If the content-encryption algorithm\n\
    \   is AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap algorithm MUST be\n  \
    \ AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  If the content-encryption\n   algorithm\
    \ is AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap\n   algorithm MUST be AES-256\
    \ Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].\n"
- title: 3.  EncryptedData
  contents:
  - "3.  EncryptedData\n   EncryptedData [RFC5652] requires that keys be managed by\
    \ other means;\n   therefore, the only algorithm specified is the content-encryption\n\
    \   algorithm.  Since the content type is used to carry a cryptographic\n   key\
    \ and its attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally used to\n   encrypt one\
    \ key with another is employed.  Implementations MUST\n   support AES-128 Key\
    \ Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  Implementations\n   SHOULD support AES-256 Key\
    \ Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].\n"
- title: 4.  AuthEnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "4.  AuthEnvelopedData\n   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083], like EnvelopedData, supports\
    \ a number of\n   key management techniques.  The key management requirements\
    \ for\n   AuthEnvelopedData are the same as for EnvelopedData.  The difference\n\
    \   is the content-encryption algorithm.  Implementations MUST support\n   128-bit\
    \ AES-Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) [RFC5084] and SHOULD\n   support 256-bit AES-GCM\
    \ [RFC5084].  Implementations MAY also support\n   AES-Counter with CBC-MAC (AES-CCM)\
    \ [RFC5084].\n"
- title: 5.  Signed Data
  contents:
  - "5.  Signed Data\n   Implementations of SignedData [RFC5652] MUST support the\
    \ signature\n   scheme RSA [RFC3370] [RFC5754] and SHOULD support the signature\n\
    \   schemes RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) [RFC4056] and\n  \
    \ Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) [RFC3370] [RFC5754].  Additionally,\n   implementations\
    \ MUST support in concert with these signature schemes\n   the hash function SHA-256\
    \ [RFC5754] and it SHOULD support the hash\n   function SHA-1 [RFC3370].\n"
- title: 6.  Public Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "6.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement SignedData, EnvelopedData,\
    \ and\n   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an\n\
    \   implementation supports RSA, RSAES-OAEP, DH, RSASSA-PSS, or DSA, then\n  \
    \ it MUST support key lengths from 1024 bits to 2048 bits, inclusive.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3560],\
    \ [RFC4056],\n   [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5649], [RFC5652], [RFC5754], and [RFC6032]\n\
    \   apply.\n   The choice of content-encryption algorithms for this document was\n\
    \   based on [RFC5649]: \"In the design of some high assurance\n   cryptographic\
    \ modules, it is desirable to segregate cryptographic\n   keying material from\
    \ other data.  The use of a specific cryptographic\n   mechanism solely for the\
    \ protection of cryptographic keying material\n   can assist in this goal\". \
    \ Unfortunately, there is no AES-GCM or\n   AES-CCM mode that provides the same\
    \ properties.  If an AES-GCM and\n   AES-CCM mode that provides the same properties\
    \ is defined, then this\n   document will be updated to adopt that algorithm.\n\
    \   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some algorithms\n   and\
    \ key sizes. [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which\n   certain numbers\
    \ of bits of security are appropriate, and some\n   environments may find these\
    \ time frames useful.\n"
