  - "1.  Background and Intended Use\n   In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such
    as those accessible using\n   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    [RFC4510], an object\n   is identified by its distinguished name (DN).  However,
    DNs are not\n   stable identifiers.  That is, a new object may be identified by
    a DN\n   that previously identified another (now renamed or deleted) object.\n
    \  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is \"an identifier unique\n   across
    both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs\"\n   [RFC4122].  UUIDs
    are used in a wide range of systems.\n   This document describes the 'entryUUID'
    operational attribute, which\n   holds the UUID assigned to the object by the
    server.  Clients may use\n   this attribute to distinguish objects identified
    by a particular\n   distinguished name or to locate a particular object after
    renaming.\n   This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and\n   'uuidOrderingMatch'
    matching rules, and the 'entryUUID' attribute\n   type.\n   Schema definitions
    are provided using LDAP description formats\n   [RFC4512].  Definitions provided
    here are formatted (line wrapped)\n   for readability.\n   In this document, the
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are
    to be interpreted as described in BCP 14\n   [RFC2119].\n"

    - "2.1.  UUID Syntax\n   A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [RFC4122] is a
      16-octet (128-\n   bit) value that identifies an object.  The ASN.1 [X.680]
      type UUID is\n   defined to represent UUIDs as follows:\n       UUID ::= OCTET
      STRING (SIZE(16))\n             -- constrained to an UUID [RFC4122]\n   In LDAP,
      UUID values are encoded using the [ASCII] character string\n   representation
      described in [RFC4122].  For example,\n   \"597ae2f6-16a6-1027-98f4-d28b5365dc14\".\n

      same as the\n   'octetStringMatch' [X.520][RFC4517] matching rule.  The rule
      differs\n   from 'octetStringMatch' in that the assertion value is encoded using\n
      \  the UUID string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING\n   string
      representation.\n   The following is an LDAP matching rule description suitable

    composed from attribute\n   values of the entry, which are commonly descriptive
    of the object the\n   entry represents.  Although deployers are encouraged to
    use naming\n   attributes whose values are widely disclosable [RFC4514], entries
    are\n   often named using information that cannot be disclosed to all\n   parties.
    \ As UUIDs do not contain any descriptive information of the\n   object they identify,
    UUIDs may be used to identify a particular\n   entry without disclosure of its
