  - "1.  Introduction\n   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) are constructed\
    \ from\n   subsystems that may include wavelength division multiplexed links,\n\
    \   tunable transmitters and receivers, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop\n   Multiplexers\
    \ (ROADMs), wavelength converters, and electro-optical\n   network elements. \
    \ A WSON is a Wavelength Division Multiplexing\n   (WDM)-based optical network\
    \ in which switching is performed\n   selectively based on the center wavelength\
    \ of an optical signal.\n   As an optical signal progresses along its path, it\
    \ may be altered by\n   the various physical processes in the optical fibers and\
    \ devices it\n   encounters.  When such alterations result in signal degradation,\n\
    \   these processes are usually referred to as \"impairments\".  Optical\n   impairments\
    \ accumulate along the path (without 3R regeneration\n   [G.680]) traversed by\
    \ the signal.  They are influenced by the type of\n   fiber used, the types and\
    \ placement of various optical devices, and\n   the presence of other optical\
    \ signals that may share a fiber segment\n   along the signal's path.  The degradation\
    \ of the optical signals due\n   to impairments can result in unacceptable bit\
    \ error rates or even a\n   complete failure to demodulate and/or detect the received\
    \ signal.\n   In order to provision an optical connection (an optical path) through\n\
    \   a WSON, a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and\n   impairment\
    \ constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal\n   paths through the\
    \ network.  The determination of appropriate paths is\n   known as Impairment-Aware\
    \ Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA).\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label\
    \ Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] provides\n   a set of control plane protocols that\
    \ can be used to operate networks\n   ranging from packet switch capable networks\
    \ to those networks that\n   use time division multiplexing and WDM.  The Path\
    \ Computation Element\n   (PCE) architecture [RFC4655] defines functional computation\n\
    \   components that can be used in cooperation with the GMPLS control\n   plane\
    \ to compute and suggest appropriate paths.  [RFC4054] provides\n   an overview\
    \ of optical impairments and their routing (path selection)\n   implications for\
    \ GMPLS.  This document uses [G.680] and other ITU-T\n   Recommendations as references\
    \ for the optical data plane aspects.\n   This document provides a framework for\
    \ applying GMPLS protocols and\n   the PCE architecture to the control and operation\
    \ of IA-RWA for\n   WSONs.  To aid in this evaluation, this document provides\
    \ an overview\n   of the subsystems and processes that comprise WSONs and describes\n\
    \   IA-RWA models based on the corresponding ITU-T Recommendations, so\n   that\
    \ the information requirements for use by GMPLS and PCE systems\n   can be identified.\
    \  This work will facilitate the development of\n   protocol extensions in support\
    \ of IA-RWA within the GMPLS and PCE\n   protocol families.\n"

- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   There are deployment scenarios for WSONs where not all\
    \ possible paths\n   will yield suitable signal quality.  There are multiple reasons;\n\
    \   below is a non-exhaustive list of examples:\n   o  WSONs are evolving and\
    \ are using multi-degree optical cross-\n      connects in such a way that network\
    \ topologies are changing from\n      rings (and interconnected rings) to general\
    \ mesh.  Adding network\n      equipment such as amplifiers or regenerators to\
    \ ensure that all\n      paths are feasible leads to an over-provisioned network.\
    \  Indeed,\n      even with over-provisioning, the network could still have some\n\
    \      infeasible paths.\n   o  Within a given network, the optical physical interface\
    \ may change\n      over the network's life; e.g., the optical interfaces might\
    \ be\n      upgraded to higher bitrates.  Such changes could result in paths\n\
    \      being unsuitable for the optical signal.  Moreover, the optical\n     \
    \ physical interfaces are typically provisioned at various stages of\n      the\
    \ network's life span, as needed, by traffic demands.\n   o  There are cases where\
    \ a network is upgraded by adding new optical\n      cross-connects to increase\
    \ network flexibility.  In such cases,\n      existing paths will have their feasibility\
    \ modified while new\n      paths will need to have their feasibility assessed.\n\
    \   o  With the recent bitrate increases from 10G to 40G and 100G over a\n   \
    \   single wavelength, WSONs will likely be operated with a mix of\n      wavelengths\
    \ at different bitrates.  This operational scenario will\n      impose impairment\
    \ constraints due to different physical behavior\n      of different bitrates\
    \ and associated modulation formats.\n   Not having an impairment-aware control\
    \ plane for such networks will\n   require a more complex network design phase\
    \ that needs to take into\n   account the evolving network status in terms of\
    \ equipment and traffic\n   at the beginning stage.  In addition, network operations\
    \ such as path\n   establishment will require significant pre-design via non-control-\n\
    \   plane processes, resulting in significantly slower network\n   provisioning.\n\
    \   It should be highlighted that the impact of impairments and use in\n   determination\
    \ of path viability is not sufficiently well established\n   for general applicability\
    \ [G.680]; it will depend on network\n   implementations.  The use of an impairment-aware\
    \ control plane, and\n   the set of information distributed, will need to be evaluated\
    \ on a\n   case-by-case scenario.\n"
- title: 4.  Impairment-Aware Optical Path Computation
  contents:
  - "4.  Impairment-Aware Optical Path Computation\n   The basic criterion for path\
    \ selection is whether one can\n   successfully transmit the signal from a transmitter\
    \ to a receiver\n   within a prescribed error tolerance, usually specified as\
    \ a maximum\n   permissible BER.  This generally depends on the nature of the\
    \ signal\n   transmitted between the sender and receiver and the nature of the\n\
    \   communications channel between the sender and receiver.  The optical\n   path\
    \ utilized (along with the wavelength) determines the\n   communications channel.\n\
    \   The optical impairments incurred by the signal along the fiber and at\n  \
    \ each optical network element along the path determine whether the BER\n   performance\
    \ or any other measure of signal quality can be met for a\n   signal on a particular\
    \ end-to-end path.\n   Impairment-aware path calculation also needs to take into\
    \ account\n   when regeneration is used along the path.  [RFC6163] provides\n\
    \   background on the concept of optical translucent networks that\n   contain\
    \ transparent elements and electro-optical elements such as OEO\n   regenerations.\
    \  In such networks, a generic light path can go through\n   a number of regeneration\
    \ points.\n   Regeneration points could happen for two reasons:\n    (i) Wavelength\
    \ conversion is performed in order to assist RWA in\n        avoiding wavelength\
    \ blocking.  This is the impairment-free case\n        covered by [RFC6163].\n\
    \   (ii) The optical signal without regeneration would be too degraded to\n  \
    \      meet end-to-end BER requirements.  This is the case when RWA\n        takes\
    \ into consideration impairment estimation covered by this\n        document.\n\
    \   In the latter case, an optical path can be seen as a set of\n   transparent\
    \ segments.  The calculation of optical impairments needs\n   to be reset at each\
    \ regeneration point so each transparent segment\n   will have its own impairment\
    \ evaluation.\n         +---+    +----+   +----+     +-----+     +----+    +---+\n\

- title: 4.1.1.  Impairment-Aware Computation Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Impairment-Aware Computation Scenarios\n   A. No Concern for Impairments\
    \ or Wavelength Continuity Constraints\n      This situation is covered by existing\
    \ GMPLS with local wavelength\n      (label) assignment.\n   B. No Concern for\
    \ Impairments, but Wavelength Continuity Constraints\n      This situation is\
    \ applicable to networks designed such that every\n      possible path is valid\
    \ for the signal types permitted on the\n      network.  In this case, impairments\
    \ are only taken into account\n      during network design; after that -- for\
    \ example, during optical\n      path computation -- they can be ignored.  This\
    \ is the case\n      discussed in [RFC6163] where impairments may be ignored by\
    \ the\n      control plane and only optical parameters related to signal\n   \
    \   compatibility are considered.\n   C. Approximated Impairment Estimation\n\
    \      This situation is applicable to networks in which impairment\n      effects\
    \ need to be considered but where there is a sufficient\n      margin such that\
    \ impairment effects can be estimated via such\n      approximation techniques\
    \ as link budgets and dispersion [G.680]\n      [G.Sup39].  The viability of optical\
    \ paths for a particular class\n      of signals can be estimated using well-defined\
    \ approximation\n      techniques [G.680] [G.Sup39].  This is generally known\
    \ as the\n      linear case, where only linear effects are taken into account.\n\
    \      Note that adding or removing an optical signal on the path should\n   \
    \   not render any of the existing signals in the network non-viable.\n      For\
    \ example, one form of non-viability is the occurrence in\n      existing links\
    \ of transients of sufficient magnitude to impact the\n      BER of existing signals.\n\
    \      Much work at ITU-T has gone into developing impairment models at\n    \
    \  this level and at more detailed levels.  Impairment\n      characterization\
    \ of network elements may be used to calculate\n      which paths are conformant\
    \ with a specified BER for a particular\n      signal type.  In such a case, the\
    \ impairment-aware (IA) path\n      computation can be combined with the RWA process\
    \ to permit more\n      optimal IA-RWA computations.  Note that the IA path computation\n\
    \      may also take place in a separate entity, i.e., a PCE.\n   D. Accurate\
    \ Impairment Computation\n      This situation is applicable to networks in which\
    \ impairment\n      effects must be more accurately computed.  For these networks,\
    \ a\n      full computation and evaluation of the impact to any existing\n   \
    \   paths need to be performed prior to the addition of a new path.\n      Currently,\
    \ no impairment models are available from ITU-T, and this\n      scenario is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Impairment Computation and Information-Sharing Constraints
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Impairment Computation and Information-Sharing Constraints\n   In GMPLS,\
    \ information used for path computation is standardized for\n   distribution amongst\
    \ the elements participating in the control plane,\n   and any appropriately equipped\
    \ PCE can perform path computation.  For\n   optical systems, this may not be\
    \ possible.  This is typically due to\n   only portions of an optical system being\
    \ subject to standardization.\n   In ITU-T Recommendations [G.698.1] and [G.698.2],\
    \ which specify\n   single-channel interfaces to multi-channel DWDM systems, only\
    \ the\n   single-channel interfaces (transmit and receive) are specified, while\n\
    \   the multi-channel links are not standardized.  These DWDM links are\n   referred\
    \ to as \"black links\", since their details are not generally\n   available.\
    \  However, note that the overall impact of a black link at\n   the single-channel\
    \ interface points is limited by [G.698.1] and\n   [G.698.2].\n   Typically, a\
    \ vendor might use proprietary impairment models for DWDM\n   spans in order to\
    \ estimate the validity of optical paths.  For\n   example, models of optical\
    \ nonlinearities are not currently\n   standardized.  Vendors may also choose\
    \ not to publish impairment\n   details for links or a set of network elements,\
    \ in order not to\n   divulge their optical system designs.\n   In general, the\
    \ impairment estimation/validation of an optical path\n   for optical networks\
    \ with black links in the path could not be\n   performed by a general-purpose\
    \ IA computation entity, since it would\n   not have access to or understand the\
    \ black-link impairment\n   parameters.  However, impairment estimation (optical\
    \ path validation)\n   could be performed by a vendor-specific IA computation\
    \ entity.  Such\n   a vendor-specific IA computation entity could utilize standardized\n\
    \   impairment information imported from other network elements in these\n   proprietary\
    \ computations.\n   In the following, the term \"black links\" will be used to\
    \ describe\n   these computation and information-sharing constraints in optical\n\
    \   networks.  From the control plane perspective, the following options\n   are\
    \ considered:\n   1. The authority in control of the black links can furnish a\
    \ list of\n      all viable paths between all viable node pairs to a computation\n\
    \      entity.  This information would be particularly useful as an input\n  \
    \    to RWA optimization to be performed by another computation entity.\n    \
    \  The difficulty here is that such a list of paths, along with any\n      wavelength\
    \ constraints, could get unmanageably large as the size\n      of the network\
    \ increases.\n   2. The authority in control of the black links could provide\
    \ a\n      PCE-like entity a list of viable paths/wavelengths between two\n  \
    \    requested nodes.  This is useful as an input to RWA optimizations\n     \
    \ and can reduce the scaling issue previously mentioned.  Such a\n      PCE-like\

- title: 4.2.  IA-RWA Computation and Control Plane Architectures
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IA-RWA Computation and Control Plane Architectures\n   From a control plane\
    \ point of view, optical impairments are\n   additional constraints to the impairment-free\
    \ RWA process described\n   in [RFC6163].  In IA-RWA, there are conceptually three\
    \ general\n   classes of processes to be considered: Routing (R), Wavelength\n\
    \   Assignment (WA), and Impairment Validation (IV), i.e., estimation.\n   Impairment\
    \ validation may come in many forms and may be invoked at\n   different levels\
    \ of detail in the IA-RWA process.  All of the\n   variations of impairment validation\
    \ discussed in this section are\n   based on scenario C (\"Approximated Impairment\
    \ Estimation\") as\n   discussed in Section 4.1.1.  From a process point of view,\
    \ the\n   following three forms of impairment validation will be considered:\n\
    \   o  IV-Candidates\n      In this case, an IV process furnishes a set of paths\
    \ between two\n      nodes along with any wavelength restrictions, such that the\
    \ paths\n      are valid with respect to optical impairments.  These paths and\n\
    \      wavelengths may not actually be available in the network, due to\n    \
    \  its current usage state.  This set of paths could be returned in\n      response\
    \ to a request for a set of at most K valid paths between\n      two specified\
    \ nodes.  Note that such a process never directly\n      discloses optical impairment\
    \ information.  Note also that this\n      case includes any paths between the\
    \ source and destination that\n      may have been \"pre-validated\".\n      In\
    \ this case, the control plane simply makes use of candidate\n      paths but\
    \ does not have any optical impairment information.\n      Another option is when\
    \ the path validity is assessed within the\n      control plane.  The following\
    \ cases highlight this situation.\n   o  IV-Approximate Verification\n      Here,\
    \ approximation methods are used to estimate the impairments\n      experienced\
    \ by a signal.  Impairments are typically approximated\n      by linear and/or\
    \ statistical characteristics of individual or\n      combined components and\
    \ fibers along the signal path.\n   o  IV-Detailed Verification\n      In this\
    \ case, an IV process is given a particular path and\n      wavelength through\
    \ an optical network and is asked to verify\n      whether the overall quality\
    \ objectives for the signal over this\n      path can be met.  Note that such\
    \ a process never directly\n      discloses optical impairment information.\n\
    \   The next two cases refer to the way an impairment validation\n   computation\
    \ can be performed from a decision-making point of view.\n   o  IV-Centralized\n\
    \      In this case, impairments to a path are computed at a single\n      entity.\
    \  The information concerning impairments, however, may\n      still be gathered\
    \ from network elements.  Depending on how\n      information is gathered, this\
    \ may put additional requirements on\n      routing protocols.  This topic will\
    \ be detailed in later sections.\n   o  IV-Distributed\n      In the distributed\
    \ IV process, approximate degradation measures\n      such as OSNR, dispersion,\
    \ DGD, etc., may be accumulated along the\n      path via signaling.  Each node\
    \ on the path may already perform\n      some part of the impairment computation\
    \ (i.e., distributed).  When\n      the accumulated measures reach the destination\
    \ node, a decision on\n      the impairment validity of the path can be made.\
    \  Note that such a\n      process would entail revealing an individual network\
    \ element's\n      impairment information, but it does not generally require\n\
    \      distributing optical parameters to the entire network.\n   The control\
    \ plane must not preclude the possibility of concurrently\n   performing one or\
    \ all of the above cases in the same network.  For\n   example, there could be\
    \ cases where a certain number of paths are\n   already pre-validated (IV-Candidates),\
    \ so the control plane may set\n   up one of those paths without requesting any\
    \ impairment validation\n   procedure.  On the same network, however, the control\
    \ plane may\n   compute a path outside the set of IV-Candidates for which an\n\
    \   impairment evaluation can be necessary.\n   The following subsections present\
    \ three major classes of IA-RWA path\n   computation architectures and review\
    \ some of their respective\n   advantages and disadvantages.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Combined Routing, WA, and IV\n   From the point of view of optimality,\
    \ reasonably good IA-RWA\n   solutions can be achieved if the PCE can conceptually/algorithmically\n\
    \   combine the processes of routing, wavelength assignment, and\n   impairment\
    \ validation.\n   Such a combination can take place if the PCE is given (a) the\n\
    \   impairment-free WSON information as discussed in [RFC6163] and (b)\n   impairment\
    \ information to validate potential paths.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Separate Routing, WA, or IV\n   Separating the processes of routing,\
    \ WA, and/or IV can reduce the\n   need for the sharing of different types of\
    \ information used in path\n   computation.  This was discussed for routing, separate\
    \ from WA, in\n   [RFC6163].  In addition, as was discussed in Section 4.1.2,\
    \ some\n   impairment information may not be shared, and this may lead to the\n\
    \   need to separate IV from RWA.  In addition, if IV needs to be done at\n  \
    \ a high level of precision, it may be advantageous to offload this\n   computation\
    \ to a specialized server.\n   The following conceptual architectures belong in\
    \ this general\n   category:\n   o  R + WA + IV\n      separate routing, wavelength\
    \ assignment, and impairment\n      validation.\n   o  R + (WA & IV)\n      routing\
    \ separate from a combined wavelength assignment and\n      impairment validation\
    \ process.  Note that impairment validation is\n      typically wavelength dependent.\
    \  Hence, combining WA with IV can\n      lead to improved efficiency.\n   o \
    \ (RWA) + IV\n      combined routing and wavelength assignment with a separate\n\
    \      impairment validation process.\n   Note that the IV process may come before\
    \ or after the RWA processes.\n   If RWA comes first, then IV is just rendering\
    \ a yes/no decision on\n   the selected path and wavelength.  If IV comes first,\
    \ it would need\n   to furnish a list of possible (valid with respect to impairments)\n\
    \   routes and wavelengths to the RWA processes.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Distributed WA and/or IV
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Distributed WA and/or IV\n   In the non-impairment RWA situation [RFC6163],\
    \ it was shown that a\n   distributed WA process carried out via signaling can\
    \ eliminate the\n   need to distribute wavelength availability information via\
    \ an\n   interior gateway protocol (IGP).  A similar approach can allow for\n\
    \   the distributed computation of impairment effects and avoid the need\n   to\
    \ distribute impairment characteristics of network elements and\n   links by routing\
    \ protocols or by other means.  Therefore, the\n   following conceptual options\
    \ belong to this category:\n   o  RWA + D(IV)\n      combined routing and wavelength\
    \ assignment and distributed\n      impairment validation.\n   o  R + D(WA & IV)\n\
    \      routing separate from a distributed wavelength assignment and\n      impairment\
    \ validation process.\n   Distributed impairment validation for a prescribed network\
    \ path\n   requires that the effects of impairments be calculated by approximate\n\
    \   models with cumulative quality measures such as those given in\n   [G.680].\
    \  The protocol encoding of the impairment-related information\n   from [G.680]\
    \ would need to be agreed upon.\n   If distributed WA is being done at the same\
    \ time as distributed IV,\n   then it is necessary to accumulate impairment-related\
    \ information for\n   all wavelengths that could be used.  The amount of information\
    \ is\n   reduced somewhat as potential wavelengths are discovered to be in use\n\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Information Model for Impairments\n   As previously discussed, most IA-RWA\
    \ scenarios rely, to a greater or\n   lesser extent, on a common impairment information\
    \ model.  A number of\n   ITU-T Recommendations cover both detailed and approximate\
    \ impairment\n   characteristics of fibers, a variety of devices, and a variety\
    \ of\n   subsystems.  An impairment model that can be used as a guideline for\n\
    \   optical network elements and assessment of path viability is given\n   in\
    \ [G.680].\n   It should be noted that the current version of [G.680] is limited\
    \ to\n   networks composed of a single WDM line system vendor combined with\n\
    \   OADMs and/or PXCs from potentially multiple other vendors.  This is\n   known\
    \ as \"situation 1\" and is shown in Figure 1-1 of [G.680].  It is\n   planned\
    \ in the future that [G.680] will include networks\n   incorporating line systems\
    \ from multiple vendors, as well as OADMs\n   and/or PXCs from potentially multiple\
    \ other vendors.  This is known\n   as \"situation 2\" and is shown in Figure\
    \ 1-2 of [G.680].\n   For the case of distributed IV, this would require more\
    \ than an\n   impairment information model.  It would need a common impairment\n\
    \   \"computation\" model.  In the distributed IV case, one needs to\n   standardize\
    \ the accumulated impairment measures that will be conveyed\n   and updated at\
    \ each node.  Section 9 of [G.680] provides guidance in\n   this area, with specific\
    \ formulas given for OSNR, residual\n   dispersion, polarization mode dispersion/polarization-dependent\
    \ loss,\n   and effects of channel uniformity.  However, specifics of what\n \
    \  intermediate results are kept and in what form would need to be\n   standardized\
    \ for interoperability.  As noted in [G.680], this\n   information may possibly\
    \ not be sufficient, and in such a case, the\n   applicability would be network\
    \ dependent.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Routing
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Routing\n   Different approaches to path/wavelength impairment validation\
    \ give\n   rise to different demands placed on GMPLS routing protocols.  In the\n\
    \   case where approximate impairment information is used to validate\n   paths,\
    \ GMPLS routing may be used to distribute the impairment\n   characteristics of\
    \ the network elements and links based on the\n   impairment information model\
    \ previously discussed.\n   Depending on the computational alternative, the routing\
    \ protocol may\n   need to advertise information necessary to the impairment validation\n\
    \   process.  This can potentially cause scalability issues, due to the\n   high\
    \ volume of data that need to be advertised.  Such issues can be\n   addressed\
    \ by separating data that need to be advertised only rarely\n   from data that\
    \ need to be advertised more frequently, or by adopting\n   other forms of awareness\
    \ solutions as described in previous sections\n   (e.g., a centralized and/or\
    \ external IV entity).\n   In terms of scenario C in Section 4.1.1, the model\
    \ defined by [G.680]\n   will apply, and the routing protocol will need to gather\
    \ information\n   required for such computations.\n   In the case of distributed\
    \ IV, no new demands would be placed on the\n   routing protocol.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Signaling\n   The largest impacts on signaling occur in the cases where\
    \ distributed\n   impairment validation is performed.  In this case, it is necessary\
    \ to\n   accumulate impairment information, as previously discussed.  In\n   addition,\
    \ since the characteristics of the signal itself, such as\n   modulation type,\
    \ can play a major role in the tolerance of\n   impairments, this type of information\
    \ will need to be implicitly or\n   explicitly signaled so that an impairment\
    \ validation decision can be\n   made at the destination node.\n   It remains\
    \ for further study whether it may be beneficial to include\n   additional information\
    \ to a connection request, such as desired\n   egress signal quality (defined\
    \ in some appropriate sense) in\n   non-distributed IV scenarios.\n"
- title: 5.4.  PCE
  contents:
  - "5.4.  PCE\n   In Section 4.2, a number of computational architectural alternatives\n\
    \   were given that could be used to meet the various requirements and\n   constraints\
    \ of Section 4.1.  Here, the focus is on how these\n   alternatives could be implemented\
    \ via either a single PCE or a set of\n   two or more cooperating PCEs, and the\

  - "5.4.2.  IV-Candidates + RWA\n   In this situation, as shown in Figure 2(b), two\
    \ separate processes\n   are involved in the IA-RWA computation.  This requires\
    \ two\n   cooperating path computation entities: one for the IV-Candidates\n \

    \ needs to be coordinated.  This could be done with yet another\n   PCE, or this\

    \ architectures that\n   incorporate knowledge of impairments in optical networks.\
    \  If such an\n   architecture is put into use within a network, it will by its\
    \ nature\n   contain details of the physical characteristics of an optical\n \
    \  network.  Such information would need to be protected from\n   intentional\
    \ or unintentional disclosure, similar to other network\n   information used within\
    \ intra-domain protocols.\n   This document does not require changes to the security\
    \ models within\n   GMPLS and associated protocols.  That is, the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE,\
    \ and\n   PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.  However,\n   satisfying\
    \ the requirements for impairment information dissemination\n   using the existing\
    \ protocols may significantly affect the loading of\n   those protocols and may\
    \ make the operation of the network more\n   vulnerable to active attacks such\
    \ as injections, impersonation, and\n   man-in-the-middle attacks.  Therefore,\
    \ additional care may be\n   required to ensure that the protocols are secure\
    \ in the impairment-\n   aware WSON environment.\n   Furthermore, the additional\
    \ information distributed in order to\n   address impairment information represents\
    \ a disclosure of network\n   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private.\n\
    \   Consideration should be given to securing this information.  For a\n   general\
    \ discussion on MPLS- and GMPLS-related security issues, see\n   the MPLS/GMPLS\
    \ security framework [RFC5920] and, in particular, text\n   detailing security\
    \ issues when the control plane is physically\n   separated from the data plane.\n"
