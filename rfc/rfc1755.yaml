  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the ATM call control signaling exchanges needed\n
    \  to support Classical IP over ATM implementations as described in RFC\n   1577
    [LAUB94]. ATM endpoints will incorporate ATM signaling services\n   as specified
    in the ATM Forum User-Network Interface (UNI)\n   Specification Version 3.1 [ATMF94].
    IP over ATM implementations\n   utilize the services of local ATM signaling entities
    to establish and\n   release ATM connections. This memo should be used to define
    the\n   support required by IP over ATM implementations from their local ATM\n
    \  signaling entities.\n   This document is an implementors guide intended to
    foster\n   interoperability among RFC 1577, RFC 1483, and UNI ATM signaling.  It\n
    \  applies to IP hosts and routers which are also ATM endsystems and\n   assumes
    ATM networks that completely implement the ATM Forum UNI\n   Specification Version
    3.1. Unless explicitly stated, no distinction\n   is made between the Private
    and Public UNI.\n   UNI 3.1 is considered an erratum to the UNI 3.0 specification.
    It has\n   been produced by the ATM Forum, largely for reasons of alignment with\n
    \  Recommendation Q.2931. Although UNI 3.1 is based on UNI 3.0 there are\n   several
    changes that make the two versions incompatible. A\n   description of how to support
    IP over ATM using UNI 3.0 is found in\n   Appendix B.\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   In a Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) environment, ATM virtual\n
    \  channel connections (VCCs) are dynamically established and released\n   as
    needed. This is accomplished using the ATM call/connection control\n   signaling
    protocol, which operates between ATM endsystems and the ATM\n   network.  The
    signaling entities use the signaling protocol to\n   establish and release calls
    (association between ATM endpoints) and\n   connections (VCCs).  Signaling procedures
    include the use of\n   addressing to locate ATM endpoints and allocation of resource
    in the\n   network for the connection.  It also provides indication and\n   negotiation
    between ATM endpoints for selection of end-to-end\n   protocols and their parameters.
    \ This memo describes how the\n   signaling protocol is used in support of IP
    over ATM, and, in\n   particular, the information exchanged in the signaling protocol
    to\n   effect this support.\n   IP address to ATM address resolution and routing
    issues are not in\n   the scope of this memo, and are treated as part of IP in

    provide implementation\n   guidelines on how multiple ATM connections between
    peer systems\n   SHOULD be managed, to prevent connection thrashing and related\n
    \  problems.\n"
  title: 3.  Use of Protocol Procedures
- contents:
  - "3.1.  VC Establishment\n   The owner of an existing VCC is defined to be the
    entity within the\n   ATM endsystem that establishes the connection.  An ATM endsystem
    MAY\n   establish an ATM call when it has a datagram to send and either there\n
    \  is no existing VCC that it can use for this purpose, it chooses not\n   to
    use an existing VCC, (e.g., for reasons of route optimization or\n   quality of
    service), or the VCC owner does not allow sharing.\n   To reduce the latency of
    the address resolution procedure at the\n   called station, the following procedure
    MAY be used:\n   If a VCC is established using the LLC/SNAP encapsulation, the
    calling\n   endstation of the VCC MAY send an InARP_REQUEST to the called\n   endstation
    after the connection is established (i.e. received a\n   CONNECT message) and
    before the calling endstation sends the first\n   data packet.  In addition, the
    calling endstation MAY send its data\n   packets without waiting for the InARP_REPLY.
    An endstation MAY\n   respond, generate, and manage its ATMARP table according
    to the\n   procedures specified in RFC1293 [BRAD92], Section 7, \"Protocol\n   Operation\",
    during the life time of the VCC.\n   To avoid establishing multiple VCCs to the
    same endstation, a called\n   endstation MAY associate the calling party number
    in the SETUP\n   message with the established VCC. This VCC MAY be used to transmit\n
    \  data packets destined to a endstation whose ATMARP resolution results\n   in
    an ATM address that is the same as the associated calling party\n   number.  Sharing
    of VCCs is subject to the policies configured at the\n   endstation as described
    in section 4.3 of this recommendation.\n"
  title: 3.1.  VC Establishment
- contents:
  - "3.2.  Multiprotocol Support on VCs\n   When two ATM endsystems run multiple protocols,
    an ATM connection MAY\n   be shared among two or more datagram protocol entities,
    as long as\n   the VCC owner allows sharing and if the encapsulation allows proper\n
    \  multiplexing and demultiplexing (i.e. the LLC/SNAP encapsulation).\n   This
    indication of sharing a VCC MAY be by configuration or via an\n   API.  Similarly,
    the Internet layer supports multiplexing of multiple\n   end-to-end transport
    sessions.  To properly detect idle connections\n   while sharing a VCC among more
    than one higher layer protocol\n   entities, the ATM endsystem MUST monitor the
    traffic at the lowest\n   multiplexing layer.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.3.  Support for Multiple VCs\n   An ATMARP server or client MAY establish an
    ATM call when it has a\n   datagram to send and either there is no existing VCC
    that it can use\n   for this purpose, it chooses not to use an existing VCC, or
    the owner\n   of the VCC does not allow sharing. Note that there might be VCCs
    to\n   the destination which are used for IP, but an ARP server might prefer\n
    \  to use a separate VCC for ARP only. The ATMARP server or client MAY\n   maintain
    or release the call as specified in RFC 1577. However, if\n   the VCC is shared
    among several protocol entities, the ATMARP client\n   or server SHALL NOT disconnect
    the call as suggested in RFC 1577.\n   Systems MUST be able to support multiple
    connections between peer\n   systems (without regard to which peer system initiated
    each\n   connection).  They MAY be configured to only allow one such\n   connection
    at a time.\n   If a receiver accepts more than one call from a single source,
    that\n   receiver MUST then accept incoming PDUs on the additional\n   connection(s),
    and MAY transmit on the additional connections.\n   Receivers SHOULD NOT accept
    the incoming call, only to close the\n   connection or ignore PDUs from the connection.\n
    \  Because opening multiple connections is specifically allowed,\n   algorithms
    to prevent connection call collision, such as the one\n   found in section 8.4.3.5
    of ISO/IEC 8473 [ISO8473], MUST NOT be\n   implemented.\n   While allowing multiple
    connections is specifically desired and\n   allowed, implementations MAY choose
    (by configuration) to permit only\n   a single connection to some destinations.
    \ Only in such a case, if a\n   colliding incoming call is received while a call
    request is pending,\n   the incoming call MUST be rejected.  Note that this MAY
    result in a\n   failure to establish a connection.  In such a case, each system
    MUST\n   wait at least a configurable collision retry time in the range 1 to\n
    \  10 seconds before retrying.  Systems MUST add a random increment,\n   with
    exponential backoff.\n"

  - "3.4.  VC Teardown\n   Either endsystem MAY close a connection. If the connection
    is closed\n   or reset while a datagram is being transmitted, the datagram is
    lost.\n   Systems SHOULD be able to configure a minimum holding time for\n   connections
    to remain open as long as the endpoints are up.  (Note\n   that holding time,
    the time the connection has been open, differs\n   from idle time.)  A suggested
    default value for the minimum holding\n   time is 60 seconds.\n   Because some
    public networks MAY charge for connection holding time,\n   and connections MAY
    be a scarce resource in some networks or\n   endsystems, each system implementing
    a Public ATM UNI interface MUST\n   support the use of a configurable inactivity
    timer to clear\n   connections that are idle for some period of time.  The timer's
    range\n   SHOULD include a range from a small number of minutes to \"infinite\".\n
    \  A default value of 20 minutes is RECOMMENDED. Systems which only\n   implement
    a Private ATM UNI interface SHOULD support the inactivity\n   timer.  If implemented,
    the inactivity timer MUST monitor traffic in\n   both directions of the connection.\n"

  - "4.  Brief Overview of UNI Call Setup Signaling Procedures and Messages\n   This
    section provides a summary of point-to-point signaling\n   procedures. Readers
    are referred to [ATMF93].\n   UNI signaling messages used for point-to-point call/connection\n
    \  control are the following:\n               Call Setup                       Call
    Release\n               ----------                       ------------\n                 SETUP
    \                            RELEASE\n                 CALL PROCEEDING                   RELEASE
    COMPLETE\n                 CONNECT\n                 CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE\n   An
    ATM endpoint initiates a call request by sending a SETUP message\n   to the network.
    The network processes the call request to determine\n   if the call can be progressed.
    If so, the network indicates the value\n   of the newly allocated VPCI/VCI in
    its first response to the the\n   SETUP message, which is either a CALL PROCEEDING
    or CONNECT message.\n   If a call cannot be accepted, by the network or destination
    ATM end-\n   point, a RELEASE COMPLETE is sent.  At the destination ATM endpoint,\n
    \  the network offers the call using the SETUP message.  If the\n   destination
    endpoint is able to accept the call, it responds with a\n   CONNECT message (which
    MAY be preceded by a CALL PROCEEDING);\n   otherwise, it sends a RELEASE COMPLETE
    message.  See Appendix A,\n   Section 2 for guidance on the use of the CALL PROCEEDING
    message.\n   Call release can be initiated by either endpoint or (rarely) by the\n
    \  network.  When an endpoint wishes to release a call, it sends a\n   RELEASE
    message to the network. The network responds with a RELEASE\n   COMPLETE message,
    frees up resources associated with the call, and\n   initiates clearing toward
    the other endpoint. The network initiates\n   clearing by sending a RELEASE message
    to the ATM endpoint, which\n   reponds by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message.
    \ Upon receipt of the\n   RELEASE COMPLETE message, the network frees any resources
    associated\n   with the call.\n"

  - "5.  Overview of Call Establishment Message Content\n   Signaling messages are
    structured to contain mandatory and optional\n   variable length information elements
    (IEs).  IEs are further\n   subdivided into octet groups, which in turn are divided
    into fields.\n   IEs contain information related to the call, which is relevant
    to the\n   network, the peer endpoint or both.  Selection of optional IEs and\n
    \  the content of mandatory and optional IEs in a call establishment\n   message
    determines the parties to and nature of the communication\n   over the ATM connection.
    For example, the call establishment message\n   for a call which will be used
    for constant bitrate video over AAL 1\n   will have different contents than a
    call which will be used for IP\n   over AAL 5.\n   A SETUP message which establishes
    an ATM connection to be used for IP\n   and multiprotocol interconnection calls
    MUST contain the following\n   IEs:\n        AAL Parameters\n        ATM Traffic
    Descriptor\n        Broadband Bearer Capability\n        Broadband Low Layer Information\n
    \       QoS Parameter\n        Called Party Number\n        Calling Party Number\n
    \  and MAY, under certain circumstance contain the following IEs:\n        Calling
    Party Subaddress\n        Called Party Subaddress\n        Transit Network Selection\n
    \  In UNI 3.1, the AAL Parameters and the Broadband Low Layer\n   Information
    IEs are optional in a SETUP message.  However, in support\n   of IP over ATM these
    two IEs MUST be included. Appendix A shows an\n   example SETUP message coded

  - "6.2.1.  Framework for Protocol Layering\n   The support of connectionless services
    from a connection oriented\n   link layer exposes general problems of connection
    management,\n   specifically the problems of connection acceptance, assignment
    of\n   quality of service, and connection shutdown. For a connection to be\n   associated
    with the correct protocol on the called host, it is\n   necessary for information
    about one or more layers of protocol\n   identification to be associated with
    a connection \"management entity\"\n   or \"endpoint\".  This association is what
    we call a binding in this\n   memo.  In this section we attempt to describe a
    framework for a\n   usable binding or service architecture given the available
    IEs in the\n   ATM call control messages.\n   It is important to distinguish between
    two basic uses of protocol\n   identification elements present in the UNI setup
    message. The first\n   is the description of the protocol encapsulation that will
    be used on\n   the data packet over the virtual connection, the second is the
    entity\n   that will be responsible for managing the call. All protocols present\n
    \  in various IEs MUST be used to encapsulate the call, but the most\n   specific,
    or highest, layer specified SHOULD manage the call. This\n   defines a hierarchy
    of services and provides a framework for\n   applications, including LLC and IP,
    to terminate calls. This\n   hierarchy provides a clear mechanism for support
    of higher level\n   protocol and application bindings, when their use and specification\n
    \  is defined in the appropriate standards bodies.\n   In general, it would be
    desirable to allow data packets to be stored\n   directly into an application's
    address space after connection is\n   established.  This is possible only if we
    have both encapsulation and\n   managing entity indications in the signaling message.\n
    \  The B-LLI is the only information element currently available in UNI\n   3.1
    for designating protocol endpoints. It contains codepoints that\n   describe layer
    2 and layer 3 protocol entities associated with the\n   call. There are other
    information elements under consideration in the\n   ATM Forum and ITU, which could
    come to play a significant role in the\n   description of application to connection
    binding, but their use is\n   not yet defined, and they are not part of the framework
    described by\n   RFC 1577. They include B-HLI, for containing information for
    a higher\n   layer protocol, Network Layer Information (NLI) to contain\n   information
    for the network layer, and UUI, which is meant to carry\n   information for use
    by the top level application.\n   The following figure shows a B-LLI that MAY
    be used for specifying in\n   call setup that IP will manage the call and that

  - "7.1.  ATM Traffic Descriptor\n   The ATM traffic descriptor characterizes the
    ATM virtual connection\n   in terms of peak cell rate (PCR), sustainable cell
    rate (SCR), and\n   maximum burst size.  This information is used to allocate
    resources\n   (e.g., bandwidth, buffering) in the network.  In general, the ATM\n
    \  traffic descriptor for supporting multiprotocol interconnection over\n   ATM
    will be driven by factors such as the capacity of the network,\n   conformance
    definition supported by the network, performance of the\n   ATM endsystem and
    (for public networks) cost of services.\n   The most convenient model of IP behavior
    corresponds to the Best\n   Effort Capability (see section 3.6.2.4 of [ATMF93]).
    If this\n   capability is offered by the ATM network(s), it MAY be requested by\n
    \  including the Best Effort Indicator, the peak cell rate forward\n   (CLP=0+1)
    and peak cell rate backward (CLP=0+1) fields in the ATM\n   Traffic Descriptor
    IE. When the Best Effort Capability is used, no\n   guarantees are provided by
    the network, and in fact, throughput may\n   be zero at any time.  This type of
    behavior is also described by RFC\n   1633 [BRAD94].\n          Format and field

    service is desired for IP, more specific traffic\n   parameters MAY be specified
    and the Best Effort capability not used.\n   Doing so includes use of two other
    traffic-related IEs and is\n   discussed in the following paragraphs and sections.\n
    \  The Traffic Descriptor IE is accompanied by the Broadband Bearer\n   Capability
    IE and the QoS Parameter IE.  Together these define the\n   signaling view of

    of traffic management capabilities, as\n   specified by using the three IEs. The

    parameters which all\n   IP over ATM endsystems MUST support in their ATM signaling.

    \  provides the procedure for an ATM endsystem to learn its own ATM\n   address
    from the ATM network, for use in populating the Calling Party\n   Number IE.  Section
    5.4.5.14 [ATMF94] describes the syntax and\n   semantics of the calling party
    subaddress IE.\n   RFC 1577 RECOMMENDS that a router be able to provide multiple
    LIS\n   support with a single physical ATM interface that may have one or\n   more
    individual ATM endsystem addresses.  Use of the Selector field\n   in the NSAPAs
    and E.164 addresses (in the NSAP format) is identified\n   as a way to differentiate
    up to 256 different LISs for the same ESI.\n   Therefore, an IP router MAY associate
    the IP addresses of the various\n   LISs it supports with distinct ATM addresses
    differentiated only by\n   the SEL field. If an IP router does this association,
    then its\n   signaling entity MUST carry in the SETUP message the ATM addresses\n

    IP entity it is requesting a call to. These ATM addresses are\n   carried in the

    used to support multiple\n   LISs.  Note: multiple LIS support is the only recommended
    use of the\n   SEL field. Use of this field is not recommended for selection of\n

    Message\n   Use of the CALL PROCEEDING message is beneficial in implementations\n
    \  where the called party's ATM signaling entity and AAL Users are\n   decoupled.
    An arriving SETUP may result in an immediate CALL\n   PROCEEDING response from
    the called party's ATM signaling entity,\n   while it locally queries the called
    IP-ATM entity to see if the\n   SETUP's conditions are acceptable. The acceptance
    of the SETUP's\n   conditions would then cause the ATM signaling entity to issue
    a\n   CONNECT back to the switch. The two possible refusal modes at the\n   called
    party then become:\n           a) Called party has no IP-ATM entity resident.
    Issue RELEASE\n              COMPLETE in response to SETUP.\n           b) Called
    party has a resident IP-ATM entity, so CALL PROCEEDING\n              was issued.
    The IP-ATM entity rejects the call request, so a\n              RELEASE is issued
    instead (to be acknowledged by the network\n              with RELEASE COMPLETE).\n"

  - "Appendix B. IP over ATM using UNI 3.0 Signaling\n   This appendix describes how
    to support IP over ATM using UNI 3.0\n   signalling.  Differences in the coding
    or semantics of each relevant\n   IE is given.\n   1. AAL parameter\n   Values
    for maximum SDU size may range from one (not zero) to 64K.\n   A 'mode' field
    is an allowable field in UNI 3.0. Nevertheless, this\n   'mode' field SHOULD be
    omitted from the AAL Parameters IE and MUST be\n   ignored by the destination
    endsystem.\n   2. Traffic Management Related IEs\n   In UNI 3.0 issues of traffic
    management were less understood than in\n   UNI 3.1. UNI 3.0 does not contain
    a guide to coordinating the use of\n   the User Cell Rate IE (Traffic Descriptor
    IE in UNI 3.1), Broadband\n   Bearer Capability IE, and QoS parameters IE. Therefore,
    the\n   recommendation for specifying parameters in these IEs is the same as\n
    \  that given above when using UNI 3.1.  The following section merely\n   describes
    relevant differences in names and code values.\n   2.1 ATM User Cell Rate (instead
    of ATM Traffic Descriptor)\n   The ATM Traffic Descriptor IE is refered to as
    'ATM User Cell Rate'\n   IE in UNI 3.0. Also, the value for the cause 'user cell
    rate\n   unavailable' is #51.\n   2.3 QoS parameters\n   The two-bit 'coding standard'
    field of the General Information octet\n   in the IE header, should be set to
    '11' inidicating that the IE is a\n   standard defined for the network (as opposed
    to an ITU-TS standard)\n   present on the network side of the interface.\n   3.
    ATM Addressing Information\n   In UNI 3.1, the 'ATM Endsystem Address' type was
    introduced to\n   differentiate ATM addresses from OSI NSAPs. In UNI 3.0, 'ATM\n
    \  Endsystem Address' is not a valid type. Therefore, in the called and\n   calling
    party subaddress IEs the three-bit 'type of subaddress' field\n   MUST specify
    'NSAP' (value = 001) when using the subaddress IE to\n   carry ATM addresses.\n
    \  4. Dealing with Failure of Call Establishment\n   In UNI 3.0 the there are
    certain cause values which are different\n   than UNI 3.1. Two relevant differences
    are the following:\n      'AAL Parameter Cannot Be Supported' is #93 (#78 in UNI
    3.1), and\n      'User Cell Rate Unavailable' is #51 (#37 in UNI 3.1).\n"

  - 'Appendix D.  Frame Relay Interworking

    '
  - "1.  RFC 1490 over FR-SSCS vs. RFC 1483 over null-SSCS\n   Procedures for Frame
    Relay to ATM signaling interworking have not yet\n   been specified by ITU-T,
    the ATM Forum, or the Frame Relay Forum. If\n   an ATM endsystem wishes to use
    FR-SSCS, FR-SSCS and RFC 1490\n   encapsulation must both be be specified in the
    SETUP message.\n   Nevertheless, since neither LLC encapsulation nor VC-multiplexing\n
    \  will interoperate when used over FR-SSCS, these two encapsulations\n   cannot
    be negotiated as alternatives to RFC 1490 encapsulation (see\n   Section 4, Encapsulation
    Negotiation).\n   In ATM environments the SSCS layer is part of the AAL functionality.\n
    \  The SSCS serves to coordinate the needs of a protocol above with the\n   requirements
    of next lower layer, the Common Part Convergence\n   Sublayer (CPCS). For example,
    the UNI ATM signaling protocol runs on\n   top of a signaling SSCS which among
    other things provides an assured\n   transfer service for signaling messages.
    Since the SSCS is considered\n   part of the AAL, the SSCS type is specified as
    one of the parameters\n   in the AAL Parameters IE.  To date there has not been
    an SSCS defined\n   for data transmission in ATM and this type field is usually
    set to\n   'null'.\n   The exception occurs when doing FR interworking where an
    ATM\n   endsystem may choose to use the FR-SSCS over AAL 5 in order to\n   communicate
    with a FR endsystem.  In that case the SSCS type in the\n   AAL Parameters IE
    of the SETUP message is set to 'FR-SSCS'.\n   Also included in a SETUP message
    is an indication in the B-LLI IE of\n   the protocol layers to be used above the
    AAL. In particular, ATM\n   connections established to carry connectionless network
    interconnect\n   traffic require a layer above the AAL for multiplexing multiple\n
    \  protocols over a single VC [HEIN 93]. As mentioned above, RFC 1577\n   defines
    LLC as default multiplexing layer for IP over AAL5.\n   Specification of the SSCS
    restricts the encapsulation protocol used\n   over it, since RFC 1483 (in addition
    to applicable ITU standards)\n   defines the use of RFC 1490 encapsulation over
    the FR-SSCS, and LLC\n   or null encapsulation otherwise.  The fact that it is
    not possible,\n   in the UNI 3.0 signaling specification, to negotiate between
    the FR-\n   SSCS and null-SSCS can result in interoperability restrictions\n   between
    stations that implement and wish to use the FR-SSCS and those\n   that do not,
    even though they both are using IP. The guidelines in\n   the following section
    were developed to decrease the chance that such\n   interoperability restrictions
    occur.\n"
  - "2.  Scenarios for Interworking\n   The following discussion uses the terms \"network
    interworking\" and\n   \"service interworking\".  \"Network interworking\" uses
    FR-SSCS over\n   AAL5 between the InterWorking Unit (IWU) and the ATM endsystem,
    and\n   the ATM endsystem is aware that the other endpoint is a FR/ATM\n   Network
    IWU.  \"Service interworking\" aims to make the operation\n   transparent to the
    ATM endsystem by adding encapsulation translation\n   and other payload processing
    in the FR/ATM Service IWU to allow the\n   ATM endsystem to operate as if it were
    talking to another ATM\n   endsystem.\n   The most common scenario where FR-SSCS
    could be negotiated is between\n   an ATM endsystem and a FR/ATM network IWU to
    allow connectivity among\n   an ATM endsystem and a FR endsystem residing behind
    a FR/ATM network\n   IWU.\n                     --------        --------\n      -------
    \      |        |      |        |       -------\n     |   A   |      | FR/ATM
    |      |   ATM  |      |   B   |\n     |  (FR) |----->|  IWU   |----->| switch
    |----->| (ATM) |\n      -------       |        |      |        |       -------\n
    \                    --------        --------\n             |      |        |
    \                     |\n              ----->          --------------------->\n
    \            FR call                 ATM call\n   A network IWU can place a call
    to an ATM host (on behalf of a FR\n   host) by signaling for FR-SSCS and assuming
    that the ATM endsystem\n   supports FR-SSCS. The B-LLI IE SHALL be encoded to
    indicate RFC 1490\n   encapsulation and the SSCS type field of the AAL Parameters
    IE SHALL\n   be coded to indicate FR-SSCS.  If the FR-SSCS negotiation fails\n
    \  because the called ATM host does not support FR-SSCS, the IWU can\n   retry
    the call negotiating for LLC encapsulation or VC-multiplexing.\n   However, the
    IWU can only attempt the retry if it is able to do FR-\n   ATM service interworking.
    Such service interworking adds extra\n   processing overhead during the call.\n
    \  The even more problematic case occurs when a call is requested in the\n   opposite
    direction, i.e. when an ATM host places a call to a host\n   residing behind an
    IWU.\n                     --------        --------\n      -------       |        |
    \     |        |       -------\n     |   B   |      | FR/ATM |      |   ATM  |
    \     |   A   |\n     |  (FR) |<-----|  IWU   |<-----| switch |<-----| (ATM) |\n
    \     -------       |        |      |        |       -------\n                     --------
    \       --------\n             |      |        |                      |\n              <-----
    \         <---------------------\n             FR call                 ATM call\n
    \  Not knowing that the destination resides behind an IWU, the calling\n   host
    will negotiate for the default LLC encapsulation (possibly\n   requesting VC-multiplexing
    as an alternative).  In this situation the\n   IWU can accept the call and do
    the necessary service interworking or\n   reject the call specifying 'AAL Parameters
    not supported'. If the IWU\n   rejects the call it risks the possibility that
    calling host does not\n   support FR-SSCS or simply does not retry and the call
    will never be\n   established.\n"
  - "3.  Possible Alternatives\n   While Frame Relay interworking is possible, it
    is not possible to\n   negotiate FR-SSCS with LLC encapsulation or VC-multiplexing,
    which\n   decreases the chances of completing an ATM call.  However,\n   interoperability
    can be increased using the following alternatives:\n   1. Maintaining external
    knowledge that a particular destination uses\n   FR-SSCS.  This knowledge can
    be configured, or in the future added to\n   some network host database.\n   2.
    In the absence of such external knowledge, an ATM endsystem is\n   required to
    negotiate for the default LLC encapsulation (possibly\n   requesting VC-multiplexing
    as an alternative).  There are three sub-\n   cases:\n   2a. The IWU supports
    service interworking and network interworking,\n   and prefers service interworking.
    \ The IWU simply accepts the call\n   using LLC encapsulation.\n   2b. The IWU
    supports service interworking and network interworking,\n   and prefers network
    interworking.  The IWU simply accepts the call,\n   but attempts to open a parallel
    connection back to the original ATM\n   endsystem negotiating the FR-SSCS use.
    \ If the connection is\n   accepted, the IWU closes the service interworking connection.\n
    \  2c. The IWU supports network interworking only.  The IWU rejects the\n   call
    specifying 'AAL Parameters not supported', and then attempts to\n   open a connection
    back to the original ATM endsystem negotiating the\n   FR-SSCS use.\n"
  - "4.  Encapsulation negotiation\n   The call/connection control signaling protocol
    includes a mechanism\n   to support negotiation of encapsulation for endsystems
    that support\n   more than one. This section describes the procedures for negotiation\n
    \  of an encapsulation.\n   The B-LLI negotiation procedures (see Annex C of [ATMF93])
    are\n   initiated by the calling ATM endsystem by including up to three\n   instances
    of the B-LLI IE in the SETUP message in descending order of\n   preference (following
    the rule for repeating IE in section 5.4.5.1 of\n   [ATMF93]).\n   The following
    is the list of the three possible combinations that B-\n   LLI IE instances MAY
    be included in the SETUP message.  Each instance\n   is referred to by its encapsulation
    name as it appears in RFC 1483,\n   and corresponding section labels from Appendix
    D of the ATM Forum UNI\n   3.0 specification.\n     a) LLC/SNAP encapsulation
    (D.3.1)\n   In this case, the calling ATM endsystem can only send and receive\n
    \  packets preceded by an LLC/SNAP identification. This memo requires\n   that
    hosts and routers which are ATM endsystems implement LLC/SNAP\n   encapsulation.\n
    \    b) VC-multiplexing (D.3.2) and LLC/SNAP (D.3.1)\n   The calling ATM endsystem
    prefers to use VC multiplexing, but is\n   willing to agree to use LLC/SNAP encapsulation
    instead, if the called\n   ATM endsytem only supports LLC/SNAP.\n     c) RFC 1490
    encapsulation (NLPID multiplexing) over FRSSCS\n       (D.3.3, omitting octets
    7a and 7b and MUST have FR-SSCS in SSCS\n       type of AAL Parameters IE.)\n
    \  The calling ATM endsystem can only send and receive packets using RFC\n   1490
    encapsulation (NLPID multiplexing) over FRSSCS.  Use of RFC 1490\n   encapsulation
    presently cannot be negotiated as an alternative to LLC\n   encapsulation or VC-multiplexing.
    \ If the B-LLI IE is encoded to\n   indicate RFC 1490 encapsulation, the SSCS
    type field of the AAL\n   Parameters IE SHALL coded to indicate FRSSCS.  Note
    that the AAL\n   Parameters IE can not be coded to indicate both NULL and FR-SSCS
    and\n   neither LLC encapsulation nor VC-multiplexing will be interoperable\n
    \  when used over FR-SSCS.\n   The called ATM endsystem SHALL select the encapsulation
    method it is\n   able to support from the B-LLI IE present in SETUP message.  If
    it\n   supports more than one of the encapsulations indicated in the SETUP\n   message,
    it MUST select the one which appears first in the SETUP\n   message.  The called
    ATM endsystem then includes the B-LLI IE content\n   corresponding to the selected
    encapsulation in the CONNECT message.\n   If the called endsystem does not support
    any encapsulation indicated\n   in the incoming SETUP message, it SHALL clear
    the call with cause\n   #88, incompatible destination.  If the received SETUP
    message does\n   not include the B-LLI IE, the call SHALL be cleared with cause
    #21,\n   \"call rejected\", with diagnostics indicating rejection reason =\n   information
    element missing and the B-LLI IE identifier.  As\n   described in Annex C of [ATMF93],
    if the calling ATM endpoint\n   receives a CONNECT message that does not contain
    a B-LLI IE, it SHALL\n   assume the encapsulation indicated in the first BLLI
    IE that it\n   included in the SETUP message.\n"
