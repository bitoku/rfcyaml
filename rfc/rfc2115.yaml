  - "3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The major components of the SNMPv2\
    \ Network Management framework are\n   described in the documents listed below.\n\
    \   o    RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management\n        Information\
    \ (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and\n        naming objects for the\
    \ purpose of management.\n   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core\
    \ set of\n        managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \   o    RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access\n        to\
    \ managed objects.\n   The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs\
    \ to suit\n   the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the\n   MIB.\
    \  Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract\n   Syntax Notation\
    \ One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, each\n   object type is named\
    \ by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an\n   administratively assigned name. The\
    \ object type together with an\n   object instance serves to uniquely identify\
    \ a specific instantiation\n   of the object. For human convenience, often a textual\
    \ string, termed\n   the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Frame Relay Operational Model\n   For the purposes of understanding this\
    \ document, Frame Relay is\n   viewed as a multi-access media, not as a group\
    \ of point- to-point\n   connections. This model proposes that Frame Relay is\
    \ a single\n   interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations\n\
    \   or neighbors (virtual connections). This view enables a network\n   manager\
    \ the ability to group all virtual connections with their\n   corresponding physical\
    \ connection thereby allowing simpler\n   diagnostics and trouble shooting.\n\
    \   With the extension of the interfaces MIB, it is possible to configure\n  \
    \ frame relay DLCs as individual interfaces and create ifTable entries\n   for\
    \ each. This is not recommended and is not directly supported by\n   this MIB.\
    \ Additionally, in the presence of demand circuits creation\n   of individual\
    \ ifEntries for each is not possible.\n   Should the user wish to group DLCs together\
    \ to associate them with a\n   higher layer, or to associate a DLC with an unnumbered\
    \ point-to-point\n   service, the frame relay DTE MIB provides an entry in the\n\
    \   frCircuitEntry record. For example, suppose one were to configure a\n   company\
    \ proprietary protocol to run above several of the frame relay\n   VCs. The basic\
    \ layering would look something like the following:\n      IP (ipaddrEntry 1 )\
    \  IP (ipaddrEntry 2)  IP (ipaddrEntry 3)\n         |                    |   \

- title: 4.2.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Textual Conventions\n   One new data type is introduced as a textual convention\
    \ in this MIB\n   document.  This textual convention enhances the readability\
    \ of the\n   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if\n\
    \   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of this\n   textual\
    \ conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics of any\
    \ managed objects.  The use of this is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory\
    \ method used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always\
    \ encoded by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no\
    \ changes to the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate this textual\
    \ conventions which is\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers\
    \ in pursuit\n   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.\n\
    \   The new data type is DLCI.  DLCI refers to the range 0..DLCINumber,\n   and\
    \ is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection Indices.\n   DLCINumber is,\
    \ by definition, the largest possible DLCI value\n   possible under the configured\
    \ Q.922 Address Format.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Structure of MIB\n   The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining\
    \ the Data Link\n   Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the\
    \ Circuits,\n   and a third describing errors.\n   During normal operation, Frame\
    \ Relay virtual circuits will be added,\n   deleted and change availability. The\
    \ occurrence of such changes is of\n   interest to the network manager and therefore,\
    \ one trap is defined,\n   intended to be corollary to the SNMP \"Link Up\" and\
