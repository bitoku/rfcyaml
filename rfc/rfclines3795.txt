Abstract This document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies in an attempt to clarify the necessary steps in re designing and re implementing specifications to become network address independent, or at least, to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.
This transition requires several interim steps, one of them being the evolution of current IPv4 dependent specifications to a format independent of the type of IP addressing schema used.
Hence, it is hoped that specifications will be re designed and re implemented to become network address independent, or at least to dually support IPv4 and IPv6.
To achieve that step, it is necessary to survey and document all IPv4 dependencies experienced by current standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs.
Hence, this document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies that deployed IETF Application Area
The exhaustive documentation of IPv4 addresses usage in currently deployed IETF documented standards has now been broken into seven documents conforming to current IETF main areas, i.e., Applications, Internet, Operations and Management, Routing, Sub IP, and Transport.
A general overview of the documentation, as well as followed methodology and historical perspective can be found in [1].
This document represents one of the seven blocks, and its scope is limited to surveying possible IPv4 dependencies in IETF Application Area documented Standards.
The remainder sections are organized as follows.
Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe, respectively, the raw analysis of Internet Standards [2]:
Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.
For each section, standards are analysed by their RFC number, in sequential order, i.e., from RFC 1 to RFC 3200.
Exceptions to this are some RFCs above RFC 3200.
They have been included, given that they obsoleted RFCs within the range 1 3200.
Also, the comments presented for each RFC are raw in their nature, i.e., each RFC is simply analysed in terms of possible IPv4 addressing dependencies.
Finally, Section 7 presents a global overview of the data described in the previous sections, and suggests possible future steps.
Full Standards Internet Full Standards have attained the highest level of maturity on the standards track process.
They are commonly referred to as "Standards", and represent fully technical mature specifications that are widely implemented and used throughout the Internet.

"A port command would be: PORT h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2 where h1 is the high order
8 bits of the internet host address.
" This is a clear reference to an IPv4 address.
In sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, on reply codes, the code: "227 Entering Passive Mode (h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2)" also needs to be reworked for IPv6 addressing.

Draft Standards Draft Standards is the nomenclature given to specifications that are on the penultimate maturity level of the IETF standards track process.
They are considered to be final specifications, which may only experience changes to solve specific problems found.
A specification is only considered to be a Draft Standard if there are at least two known independent and interoperable implementations.
Hence, Draft Standards are usually quite mature and widely used.

Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation Section
3.2.1 (Common Variables) provides the following variable definitions: "Peer Address (peer.peeraddr, pkt.peeraddr), Peer Port (peer.peerport, pkt.peerport):
These are the 32 bit Internet address and 16 bit port number of the peer.
Host Address (peer.hostaddr, pkt.hostaddr), Host Port (peer.hostport, pkt.hostport): These are the 32 bit Internet address and 16 bit port number of the host.
They are included among the state variables to support multi homing."
Section 3.4.3 (Receive Procedure) defines the following procedure: "The source and destination Internet addresses and ports in the IP and UDP headers are matched to the correct peer.
If there is no match a new instantiation of the protocol machine is created and the association mobilized."
Section 3.6 (Access Control Issues) proposes a simple authentication scheme in the following way: "If a more comprehensive trust model is required, the design can be based on an access control list with each entry consisting of a 32 bit Internet address, 32 bit mask and three bit mode.
If the logical AND of the source address (pkt.peeraddr) and the mask in an entry matches the corresponding address in the entry and the mode (pkt.mode) matches the mode in the entry, the access is allowed; otherwise an ICMP error message is returned to the requestor.
Through appropriate choice of mask, it is possible to restrict requests by mode to individual addresses, a particular subnet or net addresses, or have no restriction at all.
The access control list would then serve as a filter controlling which peers could create associations."
(B.3 Commands) defines the following command: "Set Trap Address/Port (6):
The command association identifier, status and data fields are ignored.
The address and port number for subsequent trap messages are taken from the source address and port of the control message itself.
The initial trap counter for trap response messages is taken from the sequence field of the command.
The response association identifier, status and data fields are not significant.
Implementations should include sanity timeouts which prevent trap transmissions if the monitoring program does not renew this information after a lengthy interval.
The address clearly assumes the IPv4 version.
Also, there are numerous places in sample code and in algorithms that use the above mentioned variables.
It seems that there is no reason to modify the actual protocol.
A small number of textual changes and an update to implementations, so they can understand both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, will suffice to have a NTP version that works on both network layer protocols.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP/1.1 Section 3.2.2
(http URL) states: "The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol.
This section defines the scheme specific syntax and semantics for http URLs.
If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.
The semantics are that the identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request URI for the resource is abs path (section 5.1.2).
The use of IP addresses in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever possible (see RFC 1900 [24]).
" The text is version neutral, but it is unclear whether individual implementations will support IPv6 addresses.
In fact, the use of the ":"separator in IPv6 addresses will cause misinterpretation when parsing URI's.
There are other discussions regarding a server recognizing its own IP addresses, spoofing DNS/IP address combinations, as well as issues regarding multiple HTTP servers running on a single IP interface.
Again, the text is version neutral, but clearly, such statements represent implementation issues.

The 32 bit official ARPA Internet host address (may be any one of the addresses for multi homed hosts) and a 32 bit number representing the terminal on the specified host.
The host address of [0.0.0.0] is defined to be "unknown", the terminal number of FFFFFFFF (hex, r or 1 in decimal) is defined to be "unknown" and the terminal number of FFFFFFFE (hex, or  2 in decimal) is defined to be "detached" for processes that are not attached to a terminal.
The clear reference to 32 bit numbers, and to the use of literal addresses in the form [0.0.0.0] is clearly an IPv4 dependency.
Thus, the text above needs to be re written.

The rightmost domain label will never start with a digit, though, which syntactically distinguishes all domain names from the IP addresses.
Clearly, this is only valid when using IPv4 addresses.

: Architecture of the WHOIS  service
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1913: Architecture of the WHOIS  Index Service Section 6.5.
(Query referral) makes the following statement: "When referrals are included in the body of a response to a query, each referral is listed in a separate SERVER TO ASK block as shown below.
# SERVER TO ASK Version number: //
version number of index software, used to insure //
compatibility Body of Query: //
the original query goes here
Port number to which to connect, if different from the // WHOIS  port number" The syntax used does not present specific IPv4 dependencies, but implementations should be modified to check, in incoming packets, which IP version was used by the original request, so they can determine whether or not to return an IPv6 address.
: How to Interact with a Whois  Mesh Section 4 (Caching) states the following: "A client can cache all information it gets from a server for some time.
For example records, IP addresses of Whois  servers, the Directory of Services server etc.
A client can itself choose for how long it should cache the information.
The IP address of the Directory of Services server might not change for a day or two, and neither might any other information."
(Caching a Whois  servers hostname) contains: "
An example of cached information that might change is the cached hostname, IP address and portnumber which a client gets back in a servers to ask response.
That information is cached in the server since the last poll, which might occurred several weeks ago.
Therefore, when such a connection fails, the client should fall back to use the serverhandle instead, which means that it contacts the Directory of Services server and queries for a server with that serverhandle.
By doing this, the client should always get the last known hostname.
An algorithm for this might be: response :  servers to ask response from server A IP address :  find ip address for response.hostname in DNS connect to ip address at port response.portnumber if connection fails { connect to Directory of Services server query for host with serverhandle response.serverhandle response :  response from Directory of Services server IP address :
find ip address for response.hostname in DNS connect to ip address at port response.portnumber
Hence, IPv6 compliance will be implementation dependent.

If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 575 (client software may choose to ignore the optional port number in order to increase security).
The <vemmiservice> part is optional and may be omitted.
IPv4 dependencies may relate to the possibility of the <host> portion containing an IPv4 address, as defined in RFC 1738 (see section 5.31.

Service Location Protocol Section 7.
(Service Type Request Message Format) and Section 9.
(Service Registration Message Format) have an 80 bit field from addr spec (see below) which cannot support IPv6 addresses.
(Previous Responders' Address Specification) states: "The previous responders' Address Specification is specified as <Previous Responders' Address Specification
i.e., a list separated by commas with no intervening white space.
The Address Specification is the address of the Directory Agent or Service Agent which supplied the previous response.
The format for Address Specifications in Service Location is defined in section 20.4.
The comma delimiter is required between each <addr spec
The use of dotted decimal IP address notation should only be used in environments which have no Domain Name Service."
(Address Specification in Service Location) there is also the following reference to addr spec: "The address specification used in Service Location is: <addr spec
dotted decimal IP address notation
When no Domain Name Server is available, SAs and DAs must use dotted decimal conventions for IP addresses.
Otherwise, it is preferable to use a fully qualified domain name wherever possible as renumbering of host addresses will make IP addresses invalid over time.
(Protocol Requirements) defines the requirements for each of the elements of this protocol.
Several IPv4 statements are made, but the syntax used is sufficiently neutral to apply to the use of IPv6.
(Configurable Parameters and Default Values) states: "There are several configuration parameters for Service Location.
Default values are chosen to allow protocol operation without the need for selection of these configuration parameters, but other values may be selected by the site administrator.
The configurable parameters will allow an implementation of Service Location to be more useful in a variety of scenarios.
All Service Location entities must use multicast by default.
The ability to use broadcast messages must be configurable for UAs and SAs.
Broadcast messages are to be used in environments where not all Service Location entities have hardware or software which supports multicast.
Multicast Radius Multicast requests should be sent to all subnets in a site.
The default multicast radius for a site is 32.
This value must be configurable.
The value for the site's multicast TTL may be obtained from DHCP using an option which is currently unassigned."
Once again, nothing here precludes IPv6, Section 23.
A range of 1024 contiguous multicast addresses for use as Service Specific Discovery Multicast Addresses will be assigned by IANA.
Clearly, the statements above require specifications related to the use of IPv6 multicast addresses with equivalent functionality.

Server Cache Synchronization Protocol Appendix B, part 2.0.1 (Mandatory Common Part) states: "
This is a database lookup key that uniquely identifies a piece of data which the originator of a CSA Record wishes to synchronize with its peers for a given "Protocol ID/Server Group ID" pair.
This key will generally be a small opaque byte string which SCSP will associate with a given piece of data in a cache.
Thus, for example, an originator might assign a particular 4 byte string to the binding of an IP address with that of an ATM address.
Generally speaking, the originating server of a CSA record is responsible for generating a Cache Key for every element of data that the given server originates and which the server wishes to synchronize with its peers in the SG.
" The statement above is simply meant as an example.

(TIP Transaction Manager Identification and Connection Establishment): "The <hostport> component comprises: <host>[:<port>]
where <host> is either a <dns name> or an <ip address>; and <port> is a decimal number specifying the port at which the transaction manager (or proxy) is listening for requests to establish TIP connections.
If the port number is omitted, the standard TIP port number (3372) is used.
> is a standard name, acceptable to the domain name service.
It must be sufficiently qualified to be useful to the receiver of the command.
> is an IP address, in the usual form: four decimal numbers separated by period characters.
This section has to be re written to become IP version neutral.
Besides adding a reference to the use of IPv6 addresses, the "host" field should only be defined as a "dns name".
However, if the use of literal IP addresses is to be included, the format specified in RFC 2372 has to be followed.
(TIP Uniform Resource Locators): "A TIP URL takes the form: tip://<transaction manager address>?<transaction string> where <transaction manager address
> identifies the TIP transaction manager (as defined in Section 7 above); and <transaction string
> specifies a transaction identifier, which may take one of two forms (standard or non standard)
A standard transaction identifier, conforming to the proposed Internet Standard for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as specified by RFC2141; where <NID> is the Namespace Identifier, and <NSS> is the Namespace Specific String.
The Namespace ID determines the syntactic interpretation of the Namespace Specific String.
The Namespace Specific String is a sequence of characters representing a transaction identifier (as defined by <NID>).
The rules for the contents of these fields are specified by [6] (valid characters, encoding, etc.).
This format of <transaction string> may be used to express global transaction identifiers in terms of standard representations.
might be <iso> or <xopen
e.g., tip://123.123.123.123/?urn:xopen:xid Note that Namespace Ids require registration.
See [7] for details on how to do this.
" There are other references in section 8, regarding the use of literal IP addresses.
Therefore, this section also needs to be re written, and special care should be taken to avoid the use of IP (either IPv4 or IPv6)
However, if such use is exemplified, the format specified in RFC 2732 has to be respected.
POP URL Scheme Section 3.
(POP Scheme) states: "A POP URL is of the general form: pop://<user>;auth <auth>@<host>:<port>
RFC 1738 (please refer to section 5.31) has a potential IPv4 limitation.
Hence, RFC 2384 will only be IPv6 compliant when RFC 1738 becomes properly updated.

FTP Extensions for IPv6 and NATs
This RFC documents an IPv6 extension and hence, it is not considered in the context of the current discussion.
RFC 2445: Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) Section 4.8.4.7 (Unique Identifier) states: "
UID Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique identifier for the calendar component.
Non standard property parameters can be specified on this property.
The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.
The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.
The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique.
There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this.
The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the [RFC 822] addr spec.
Using a date/time value on the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since no two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at the same time.
Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED that the right hand side contain some domain identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within the scope of that domain."
Although the above does not explicitly state the use of IPv4 addresses, it addresses the explicit use of RFC 822 (obsoleted by RFC 2822).
To become IPv6 compliant it should follow the guidelines for RFC 2822 (see section 5.129).

UAs SHOULD implement this discovery algorithm.
SAs MUST use this to discover all available DAs in their scope, if they are not already configured with DA addresses by some other means."
And later: "A SA silently drops all requests which include the SA's address in the <PRList
An SA which has multiple network interfaces MUST check if any of the entries in the <PRList>
equal any of its interfaces.
An entry in the PRList which does not conform to an IPv4 dotted decimal address is ignored:  The rest of the <PRList> is processed normally and an error is not returned."
To become IPv6 compliant, this protocol requires a new version.

Internet Message Format Section 3.4.1
(Addr spec specification) contains: "The domain portion identifies the point to which the mail is delivered.
In the dot atom form, this is interpreted as an Internet domain name (either a host name or a mail exchanger name) as described in [STD3, STD13, STD14].
In the domain literal form, the domain is interpreted as the literal Internet address of the particular host.
In both cases, how addressing is used and how messages are transported to a particular host is covered in the mail transport document [RFC2821].
These mechanisms are outside of the scope of this document.
The local part portion is a domain dependent string.
In addresses, it is simply interpreted on the particular host as a name of a particular mailbox.
Literal IP addresses should be avoided.
However, in case they are used, there should be a reference to the format described in RFC 2732.

Experimental RFCs Experimental RFCs belong to the category of "non standard" specifications.
This group involves specifications considered "off  track", e.g., specifications that haven't yet reach an adequate standardization level, or that have been superseded by more recent specifications.
Experimental RFCs represent specifications that are currently part of some research effort, and that are often propriety in nature, or used in limited arenas.
They are documented to the Internet community in order to allow potential interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.
In a few cases, they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution of an acknowledged problem.
Resource Location Protocol Section 3.1 (Request Messages) contains: "<
This message parallels the <Who Provides?
> message with the "third party" variant described above.
The confirming host is required to return at least its own IP address (if it provides the named resource) as well as the IP addresses of any other hosts it believes may provide the named resource.
The confirming host though, may never return an IP address for a resource which is the same as an IP address listed with the resource name in the request message.
In this case it must treat the resource as if it was unsupported at that IP address and omit it from any reply list.
This message parallels the <
> message again with the "third party" variant described above.
As before, the confirming host is required to return its own IP address as well as the IP addresses of any other hosts it believes may provide the named resource and is prohibited from returning the same IP address in the reply resource specifier as was listed in the request resource specifier.
As in the <Do You Provide?
> case and for the same reason, this message also may not be broadcast.
" Throughout this section, there are several other references to IP address.
To avoid ambiguity, a reference to IPv6 addressing should be added.
(Resource Lists) presents the following qualifier format: "In addition, resource specifiers in all <Who Anywhere Provides?
> messages also contain an additional qualifier following the <Protocol ID
This qualifier has the format  //
where <IPLength> is the number of IP addresses containing in the following <IP  Address List> (the <IP Address List> field thus occupies the last 4 <IPLength
> octets in its resource specifier).
In request messages, this is the maximum number of qualifying addresses which may be included in the corresponding reply resource specifier.
Although not particularly useful, it may be 0 and in that case provides no space for qualifying the resource name with IP addresses in the returned specifier.
In reply messages, this is the number of qualifying addresses known to provide the resource.
It may not exceed the number specified in the corresponding request specifier.
This field may not be 0 in a reply message unless it was supplied as 0 in the request message and the confirming host would have returned
one or more IP addresses had any space been provided.
> is a list of four octet IP addresses used to qualify the resource specifier with respect to those particular addresses.
In reply messages, these are the IP addresses of the confirming host (when appropriate) and the addresses of any other hosts known to provide that resource (subject to the list length limitations).
In request messages, these are the IP addresses of hosts for which resource information may not be returned.
In such messages, these addresses should normally be initialized to some "harmless" value (such as the address of the querying host) unless it is intended to specifically exclude the supplied addresses from consideration in any reply messages.
This section requires re writing considering the 128 bit length of IPv6 addresses, and will clearly impact implementations.

This survey contemplates 257 RFCs, having 34 (12.84%) been identified as having some form of IPv4 dependency.
Results are broken down as follows:
identified, the majority simply require minor actions, such as adding a caveat to IPv6 addressing that would avoid ambiguity, or re writing a section to avoid IP version dependent syntax.
The remaining instances are documented below.
The authors have attempted to organize the results in a format that allows easy referencing by other protocol designers.
RFC 959: STD 9 File Transfer Protocol Problems have already been fixed in [5].
RFC 1305: Network Time Protocol (version 3): Specification, Implementation and Analysis As documented in Section 4.4.
above, there are too many specific references to the use of 32 bit IPv4 addresses.
An updated specification to support NTP over IPv6 is needed.
However, there has been some work related with this issue, as an already expired work in progress, allegedly documents.
Also, there is at least one IPv6 NTP implementation.
URI Syntax URI's allow the literal use of IPv4 addresses but have no specific recommendations on how to represent literal IPv6 addresses.
This problem has already been addressed in [3].
HTTP/1.1 HTTP allows the literal use of IPv4 addresses, but has no specific recommendations on how to represent literal IPv6 addresses.
This problem has already been addressed in [3].
There is a dependency in the definition of the TTYLOC Number which would require an updated version of the protocol.
However, since this functionality is of marginal value today, an updated version might not make sense.

The Coherent File Distribution Protocol
The packet format of this protocol depends on IPv4, and would require updating to add IPv6 support.

RFC 2307: Using LDAP as a NIS
This document tries to provide IPv6 support but it relies on an outdated format for IPv6 addresses.
Thus, there is the need for an IPv6 compliant version.
This document provides an exhaustive documentation of current IETF documented standards IPv4 address dependencies.
Such process does not have security implications in itself.
