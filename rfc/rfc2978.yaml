- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) (RFC-2045, RFC-2046,\n\
    \   RFC-2047, RFC-2184) and various other Internet protocols are capable\n   of\
    \ using many different charsets.  This in turn means that the\n   ability to label\
    \ different charsets is essential.\n   Note: The charset registration procedure\
    \ exists solely to associate a\n   specific name or names with a given charset\
    \ and to give an indication\n   of whether or not a given charset can be used\
    \ in MIME text objects.\n   In particular, the general applicability and appropriateness\
    \ of a\n   given registered charset to a particular application is a protocol\n\
    \   issue, not a registration issue, and is not dealt with by this\n   registration\
    \ procedure.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Definitions and Notation\n   The following sections define terms used in\
    \ this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Notation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Notation\n   This document occasionally uses terms that appear\
    \ in capital letters.\n   When the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate\
    \ particular\n   requirements of this specification.  A discussion of the meanings\
    \ of\n   these terms appears in [RFC-2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Character
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Character\n   A member of a set of elements used for the organization,\
    \ control, or\n   representation of data.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Charset
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Charset\n   The term \"charset\" (referred to as a \"character set\" in\
    \ previous\n   versions of this document) is used here to refer to a method of\n\
    \   converting a sequence of octets into a sequence of characters.  This\n   conversion\
    \ may also optionally produce additional control information\n   such as directionality\
    \ indicators.\n   Note that unconditional and unambiguous conversion in the other\n\
    \   direction is not required, in that not all characters may be\n   representable\
    \ by a given charset and a charset may provide more than\n   one sequence of octets\
    \ to represent a particular sequence of\n   characters.\n   This definition is\
    \ intended to allow charsets to be defined in a\n   variety of different ways,\
    \ from simple single-table mappings such as\n   US-ASCII to complex table switching\
    \ methods such as those that use\n   ISO 2022's techniques.  However, the definition\
    \ associated with a\n   charset name must fully specify the mapping to be performed.\
    \  In\n   particular, use of external profiling information to determine the\n\
    \   exact mapping is not permitted.\n   HISTORICAL NOTE: The term \"character\
    \ set\" was originally used in MIME\n   to describe such straightforward schemes\
    \ as US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1\n   which consist of a small set of characters and\
    \ a simple one-to-one\n   mapping from single octets to single characters.  Multi-octet\n\
    \   character encoding schemes and switching techniques make the\n   situation\
    \ much more complex.  As such, the definition of this term\n   was revised to\
    \ emphasize both the conversion aspect of the process,\n   and the term itself\
    \ has been changed to \"charset\" to emphasize that\n   it is not, after all,\
    \ just a set of characters.  A discussion of\n   these issues as well as specification\
    \ of standard terminology for use\n   in the IETF appears in RFC 2130.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Coded Character Set
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Coded Character Set\n   A Coded Character Set (CCS) is a one-to-one mapping\
    \ from a set of\n   abstract characters to a set of integers.  Examples of coded\n\
    \   character sets are ISO 10646 [ISO-10646], US-ASCII [US-ASCII], and\n   the\
    \ ISO-8859 series [ISO-8859].\n"
- title: 1.5.  Character Encoding Scheme
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Character Encoding Scheme\n   A Character Encoding Scheme (CES) is a mapping\
    \ from a Coded Character\n   Set or several coded character sets to a set of octet\
    \ sequences.  A\n   given CES is sometimes associated with a single CCS; for example,\n\
    \   UTF-8 applies only to ISO 10646.\n"
- title: 2.  Charset Registration Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Charset Registration Requirements\n   Registered charsets are expected to\
    \ conform to a number of\n   requirements as described below.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Required Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Required Characteristics\n   Registered charsets MUST conform to the definition\
    \ of a \"charset\"\n   given above.  In addition, charsets intended for use in\
    \ MIME content\n   types under the \"text\" top-level type MUST conform to the\n\
    \   restrictions on that type described in RFC 2045.  All registered\n   charsets\
    \ MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME\n   text.\n   All\
    \ charsets which are constructed as a composition of one or more\n   CCS's and\
    \ a CES MUST either include the CCS's and CES they are based\n   on in their registration\
    \ or else cite a definition of their CCS's and\n   CES that appears elsewhere.\n\
    \   All registered charsets MUST be specified in a stable, openly\n   available\
    \ specification.  Registration of charsets whose\n   specifications aren't stable\
    \ and openly available is forbidden.\n"
- title: 2.2.  New Charsets
  contents:
  - "2.2.  New Charsets\n   This registration mechanism is not intended to be a vehicle\
    \ for the\n   design and definition of entirely new charsets.  This is due to\
    \ the\n   fact that the registration process does NOT contain adequate review\n\
    \   mechanisms for such undertakings.\n   As such, only charsets defined by other\
    \ processes and standards\n   bodies, or specific profiles or combinations of\
    \ such charsets, are\n   eligible for registration.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Naming Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Naming Requirements\n   One or more names MUST be assigned to all registered\
    \ charsets.\n   Multiple names for the same charset are permitted, but if multiple\n\
    \   names are assigned a single primary name for the charset MUST be\n   identified.\
    \ All other names are considered to be aliases for the\n   primary name and use\
    \ of the primary name is preferred over use of any\n   of the aliases.\n   Each\
    \ assigned name MUST uniquely identify a single charset.  All\n   charset names\
    \ MUST be suitable for use as the value of a MIME content\n   type charset parameter\
    \ and hence MUST conform to MIME parameter value\n   syntax.  This applies even\
    \ if the specific charset being registered\n   is not suitable for use with the\
    \ \"text\" media type.\n   All charsets MUST be assigned a name that provides\
    \ a display string\n   for the associated \"MIBenum\" value defined below.  These\
    \ \"MIBenum\"\n   values are defined by and used in the Printer MIB [RFC-1759].\
    \  Such\n   names MUST begin with the letters \"cs\" and MUST contain no more\
    \ than\n   40 characters (including the \"cs\" prefix) chosen from from the\n\
    \   printable subset of US-ASCII.  Only one name beginning with \"cs\" may\n \
    \  be assigned to a single charset.  If no name of this form is\n   explicitly\
    \ defined IANA will assign an alias consisting of \"cs\"\n   prepended to the\
    \ primary charset name.\n   Finally, charsets being registered for use with the\
    \ \"text\" media type\n   MUST have a primary name that conforms to the more restrictive\
    \ syntax\n   of the charset field in MIME encoded-words [RFC-2047, RFC-2184] and\n\
    \   MIME extended parameter values [RFC-2184].  A combined ABNF\n   definition\
    \ for such names is as follows:\n     mime-charset = 1*mime-charset-chars\n  \
    \   mime-charset-chars = ALPHA / DIGIT /\n                \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\"\
    \ / \"%\" / \"&\" /\n                \"'\" / \"+\" / \"-\" / \"^\" / \"_\" /\n\
    \                \"`\" / \"{\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n     ALPHA        = \"A\"..\"\
    Z\"    ; Case insensitive ASCII Letter\n     DIGIT        = \"0\"..\"9\"    ;\
    \ Numeric digit\n"
- title: 2.4.  Functionality Requirement
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Functionality Requirement\n   Charsets MUST function as actual charsets:\
    \ Registration of things\n   that are better thought of as a transfer encoding,\
    \ as a media type,\n   or as a collection of separate entities of another type,\
    \ is not\n   allowed.  For example, although HTML could theoretically be thought\n\
    \   of as a charset, it is really better thought of as a media type and\n   as\
    \ such it cannot be registered as a charset.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Usage and Implementation Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Usage and Implementation Requirements\n   Use of a large number of charsets\
    \ in a given protocol may hamper\n   interoperability.  However, the use of a\
    \ large number of undocumented\n   and/or unlabeled charsets hampers interoperability\
    \ even more.\n   A charset should therefore be registered ONLY if it adds significant\n\
    \   functionality that is valuable to a large community, OR if it\n   documents\
    \ existing practice in a large community.  Note that charsets\n   registered for\
    \ the second reason should be explicitly marked as being\n   of limited or specialized\
    \ use and should only be used in Internet\n   messages with prior bilateral agreement.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Publication Requirements\n   Charset registrations MAY be published in\
    \ RFCs, however, RFC\n   publication is not required to register a new charset.\n\
    \   The registration of a charset does not imply endorsement, approval,\n   or\
    \ recommendation by the IANA, IESG, or IETF, or even certification\n   that the\
    \ specification is adequate.  It is expected that\n   applicability statements\
    \ for particular applications will be\n   published from time to time that recommend\
    \ implementation of, and\n   support for, charsets that have proven particularly\
    \ useful in those\n   contexts.\n   Charset registrations SHOULD include a specification\
    \ of mapping from\n   the charset into ISO 10646 if specification of such a mapping\
    \ is\n   feasible.\n"
- title: 2.7.  MIBenum Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.7.  MIBenum Requirements\n   Each registered charset MUST also be assigned\
    \ a unique enumerated\n   integer value.  These \"MIBenum\" values are defined\
    \ by and used in the\n   Printer MIB [RFC-1759].\n   A MIBenum value for each\
    \ charset will be assigned by IANA at the time\n   of registration.  MIBenum values\
    \ are not assigned by the person\n   registering the charset.\n"
- title: 3.  Charset Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Charset Registration Procedure\n   The following procedure has been implemented\
    \ by the IANA for review\n   and approval of new charsets.  This is not a formal\
    \ standards\n   process, but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow\n\
    \   community comment and sanity checking without excessive time delay.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Present the Charset to the Community
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Present the Charset to the Community\n   Send the proposed charset registration\
    \ to the \"ietf-\n   charsets@iana.org\" mailing list.  (Information about joining\
    \ this\n   list is available on the IANA Website, http://www.iana.org.)  This\n\
    \   mailing list has been established for the sole purpose of reviewing\n   proposed\
    \ charset registrations. Proposed charsets are not formally\n   registered and\
    \ must not be used; the \"x-\" prefix specified in RFC\n   2045 can be used until\
    \ registration is complete.\n   The posting of a charset to the list initiates\
    \ a two week public\n   review process.\n   The intent of the public posting is\
    \ to solicit comments and feedback\n   on the definition of the charset and the\
    \ name chosen for it.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Charset Reviewer
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Charset Reviewer\n   When the two week period has passed and the registration\
    \ proposer is\n   convinced that consensus has been achieved, the registration\n\
    \   application should be submitted to IANA and the charset reviewer.\n   The\
    \ charset reviewer, who is appointed by the IETF Applications Area\n   Director(s),\
    \ either approves the request for registration or rejects\n   it.  Rejection may\
    \ occur because of significant objections raised on\n   the list or objections\
    \ raised externally.  If the charset reviewer\n   considers the registration sufficiently\
    \ important and controversial,\n   a last call for comments may be issued to the\
    \ full IETF.  The charset\n   reviewer may also recommend standards track processing\
    \ (before or\n   after registration) when that appears appropriate and the level\
    \ of\n   specification of the charset is adequate.\n   The charset reviewer must\
    \ reach a decision and post it to the ietf-\n   charsets mailing list within two\
    \ weeks.  Decisions made by the\n   reviewer may be appealed to the IESG.\n"
- title: 3.3.  IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IANA Registration\n   Provided that the charset registration has either\
    \ passed review or\n   has been successfully appealed to the IESG, the IANA will\
    \ register\n   the charset, assign a MIBenum value, and make its registration\n\
    \   available to the community.\n"
- title: 4.  Location of Registered Charset List
  contents:
  - "4.  Location of Registered Charset List\n   Charset registrations will be posted\
    \ in the anonymous FTP file\n   \"ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets\"\
    \ and all\n   registered charsets will be listed in the periodically issued\n\
    \   \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC [currently RFC-1700].  The description of the\n \
    \  charset MAY also be published as an Informational RFC by sending it\n   to\
    \ \"rfc-editor@isi.edu\" (please follow the instructions to RFC\n   authors [RFC-1543]).\n"
