    \   discipline to the future development of the Session Initiation\n   Protocol\
    \ (SIP).  There have been concerns with regards to new SIP\n   proposals.  Specifically,\
    \ that the addition of new SIP features can\n   be damaging towards security and/or\
    \ greatly increase the complexity\n   of the protocol.  The Transport Area directors,\
    \ along with the SIP\n   and Session Initiation Proposal Investigation (SIPPING)\
    \ working group\n   chairs, have provided suggestions for SIP modifications and\n\
    \   extensions.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. History and Development\n   The IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [3]\
    \ was originally\n   developed for initiation of multimedia sessions.  Internet\n\
    \   multimedia, voice over IP, IP telephony, and SIP have become quite\n   popular,\
    \ both inside IETF and with other standards groups, and the\n   applications of\
    \ SIP have grown.  One result of this popularity has\n   been a continual flood\
    \ of suggestions for SIP modifications and\n   extensions.  The task for IETF\
    \ management of SIP has been to keep the\n   protocol development focused on SIP's\
    \ core strengths and the\n   applications it does best.\n"
- title: 2.1 The IETF SIP Working Group
  contents:
  - "2.1 The IETF SIP Working Group\n   The IETF SIP Working Group has been chartered\
    \ to be the \"owner\" of\n   the SIP protocol [3], as long as the working group\
    \ exists.  All\n   changes or extensions to SIP must first exist as SIP Working\
    \ Group\n   documents.  The SIP Working group is charged with being the guardian\n\
    \   of the SIP protocol for the Internet, and therefore should only\n   extend\
    \ or change the SIP protocol when there are compelling reasons\n   to do so.\n\
    \   Documents that must be handled by the SIP working group include new\n   SIP\
    \ methods, new SIP option tags, new response codes, and new\n   standards track\
    \ SIP headers.  With the exception of \"P-\" headers\n   described in Section\
    \ 4.1, all SIP extensions must be standards track\n   and must be developed in\
    \ the IETF based upon requirements provided by\n   the SIPPING Working Group.\n\
    \   IETF working groups do not live forever; typically, mailing lists\n   continue\
    \ after the working group is concluded. If the SIP Working\n   Group has closed\
    \ and no suitable replacement or follow-on working\n   group is active, the Transport\
    \ Area directors will the use the non-\n   working group standards track document\
    \ process (described in section\n   6.1.2 of RFC 2026--IETF Standards Process\
    \ [2]) using the SIP and\n   SIPPING mailing lists and designated experts from\
    \ the SIP community\n   for advice. The IETF will remain the home of extensions\
    \ of SIP and\n   the requirement of standards track action will remain as defined\
    \ in\n   the rest of this document.  The rate of growth of extensions of any\n\
    \   protocol in the IETF is hoped to be low.\n   It is appropriate for any working\
    \ group to develop SIP event packages\n   [4], but the working group must have\
    \ charter approval to do so.  The\n   IETF will also require (Individual) RFC\
    \ publication for the\n   registration of event packages developed outside the\
    \ scope of an IETF\n   working group.  Requirements for publishing event packages\
    \ are\n   described in detail in Section 4.3.\n"
- title: 2.2 The IETF SIPPING Working Group
  contents:
  - "2.2 The IETF SIPPING Working Group\n   The IETF Session Initiation Protocol Proposal\
    \ Investigation (sipping)\n   Working Group is chartered to be a filter in front\
    \ of the SIP Working\n   Group.  This working group will investigate requirements\
    \ for\n   applications of SIP, some of which may lead to requests for\n   extensions\
    \ to SIP.  These requirements may come from the community at\n   large, or from\
    \ individuals who are reporting the requirements as\n   determined by another\
    \ standards body.  The SIPPING Working Group will\n   also not live forever, with\
    \ similar consideration to the sections\n   above.\n   The SIPPING Working Group\
    \ may determine: that these requirements can\n   be satisfied by SIP without modifications,\
    \ that the requirements are\n   not sufficiently general to warrant a change to\
    \ SIP, that the\n   requirements justify a change to SIP, or that the requirements\
    \ should\n   be combined with other requirements to solve a more general problem\n\
    \   or solve the same problem in a more flexible way.\n   Because the SIP protocol\
    \ gets so much attention, some application\n   designers may want to use it just\
    \ because it is there, such as for\n   controlling household appliances.  SIPPING\
    \ should act as a filter,\n   accepting only requirements which play to the best\
    \ strengths of SIP,\n   such as realtime presence.\n   When the SIPPING working\
    \ group decides on a set of requirements, it\n   forwards them to the SIP working\
    \ group.  The SIPPING Working Group\n   may also document usage or applications\
    \ of SIP which do not require\n   any protocol extensions.\n   The SIPPING working\
    \ group also acts as a filter for proposed event\n   packages as described in\
    \ Section 4.3.\n"
- title: 3. SIP Change Process
  contents:
  - "3. SIP Change Process\n   Anyone who thinks that the existing SIP protocol is\
    \ applicable to\n   their application, yet not sufficient for their task must\
    \ write an\n   individual Internet-Draft explaining the problem they are trying\
    \ to\n   solve, why SIP is the applicable protocol, and why the existing SIP\n\
    \   protocol will not work.  The Internet-Draft must include a detailed\n   set\
    \ of requirements (distinct from solutions) that SIP would need to\n   meet to\
    \ solve the particular problem.  The Internet-Draft must also\n   describe in\
    \ detail any security issues that arise from meeting those\n   requirements. \
    \ After the Internet-Draft is published, the authors\n   should send a note to\
    \ the SIPPING Working Group mailing list to start\n   discussion on the Internet-Draft.\n\
    \   The SIPPING working group chairs, in conjunction with the Transport\n   Area\
    \ Directors, will determine if the particular problems raised in\n   the requirements\
    \ Internet-Draft warrants being added to the SIPPING\n   charter based on the\
    \ mailing list discussion.  The SIPPING working\n   group should consider whether\
    \ the requirements can be merged with\n   other requirements from other applications,\
    \ and refine the ID\n   accordingly.\n   If the chairs and the ADs both feel that\
    \ the particular new problems\n   should be added to the SIPPING Working Group\
    \ charter, then the ADs\n   will present the proposed SIPPING charter modifications\
    \ to the IESG\n   and IAB, in accordance with the usual process for charter expansion.\n\
    \   If the IESG (with IAB advice) approves of the charter changes, the\n   SIPPING\
    \ working group can then work on the problems described in the\n   Internet-Draft.\n\
    \   In a separate Internet-Draft, the authors may describe a set of\n   changes\
    \ to SIP that would meet the requirements.  The Internet-Draft\n   would then\
    \ be passed to the SIP working group for consideration (if\n   warranted).  The\
    \ SIP working group is not required to adopt the\n   proposed solution from this\
    \ additional Internet-Draft.\n   The SIPPING working group may also evaluate such\
    \ proposals for\n   extensions if the requirements are judged to be appropriate\
    \ to SIP,\n   but are not sufficiently general for standards track activity. \
    \ The\n   SIPPING working group will attempt to determine if the new proposal\n\
    \   meets the requirements for publication as a \"P-\" header, as described\n\
    \   in Section 4.1, within a specific scope of applicability.\n   The Transport\
    \ ADs may, on a case by case basis, support a process in\n   which the requirements\
    \ analysis is implicit and the SIP working group\n   requests the addition of\
    \ a charter item for an extension without a\n   full SIPPING process as described.\
    \  This will be the exception.\n   With respect to standardization, this process\
    \ means that SIP\n   extensions come only from the IETF, the body that created\
    \ SIP.  The\n   IETF will not publish a SIP extension RFC outside of the processes\n\
    \   described here.\n   The SIP Working Group is required to protect the architectural\n\
    \   integrity of SIP and must not add features that do not have general\n   use\
    \ beyond the specific case.  Also, they must not add features just\n   to make\
    \ a particular function more efficient at the expense of\n   simplicity or robustness.\n\
    \   Some working groups besides SIPPING generate requirements for SIP\n   solutions\
    \ and/or extensions as well.  At the time this document was\n   written, these\
    \ include SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence\n   Leveraging Extensions (simple),\
    \ Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting\n   InTernet Service (spirits), and Telephone\
    \ Number Mapping (enum).\n"
- title: 4. Extensibility and Architecture
  contents:
  - "4. Extensibility and Architecture\n   In an idealized protocol model, extensible\
    \ design would be self-\n   contained, and it would be inherent that new extensions\
    \ and new\n   headers would naturally have an architectural coherence with the\n\
    \   original protocol.\n   However, this idealized vision has not been attained\
    \ in the world of\n   standards track protocols.  While, interoperability implications\
    \ can\n   be addressed by capabilities negotiation rules, the effects of adding\n\
    \   features that overlap, or that deal with a point solution and are not\n  \
    \ general, are much harder to control with rules.  Therefore, the\n   Transport\
    \ Area calls for architectural guardianship and application\n   of Occam's Razor\
    \ by the SIP Working Group.\n   In keeping with the IETF tradition of \"running\
    \ code and rough\n   consensus\", it is valid to allow for the development of\
    \ SIP\n   extensions that are either not ready for standards track, but might\n\
    \   be understood for that role after some running code, or are private\n   or\
    \ proprietary in nature, because a characteristic motivating them is\n   usage\
    \ that is known not to fit the Internet architecture for SIP.  We\n   call these\
    \ \"P-\" headers, for \"preliminary\", \"private\", or\n   \"proprietary\".\n\
    \   There are two key issues to consider with respect to keeping the \"P-\"\n\
    \   header extension space \"safe\":\n   1.  Clearly indicating the unarchitected\
    \ or not-yet understood nature\n       of the extension.\n   2.  Preventing identity\
    \ conflicts between extensions.\n"
- title: '4.1 Indicating a "P-" Header:'
  contents:
  - "4.1 Indicating a \"P-\" Header:\n   Use of an \"X-\" prefix on textual identifiers\
    \ has been widely used to\n   indicate experimental extensions in other protocols.\
    \  This approach\n   is applied in modified form here by use of a \"P-\" header\
    \ extension.\n   However, there are a number of stronger constraints for \"P-\"\
    \ headers,\n   including documentation that get Expert and IESG review, and other\n\
    \   SIP protocol criteria described below.\n   Informational SIP Headers can be\
    \ registered as \"P-\" headers if all of\n   the following conditions are met:\n\
    \   1.  A designated expert (as defined in RFC 2434 [4]) MUST review the\n   \
    \    proposal for applicability to SIP and conformance to these\n       guidelines.\
    \  The Expert Reviewer will send email to the Transport\n       Area Directors\
    \ on this determination.  The expert reviewer can\n       cite one or more of\
    \ the guidelines that haven't been followed in\n       his/her opinion.\n   2.\
    \  The proposed extension MUST NOT define SIP option tags, response\n       codes,\
    \ or methods.\n   3.  The function of the proposed header MUST NOT overlap with\
    \ current\n       or planned chartered extensions.\n   4.  The proposed header\
    \ MUST be of a purely informational nature, and\n       MUST NOT significantly\
    \ change the behavior of SIP entities which\n       support it.  Headers which\
    \ merely provide additional information\n       pertinent to a request or a response\
    \ are acceptable.  If the\n       headers redefine or contradict normative behavior\
    \ defined in\n       standards track SIP specifications, that is what is meant\
    \ by\n       significantly different behavior.\n   5.  The proposed header MUST\
    \ NOT undermine SIP security in any sense.\n       The Internet Draft proposing\
    \ the new header MUST address security\n       issues in detail as if it were\
    \ a Standards Track document.  Note\n       that, if the intended application\
    \ scenario makes certain\n       assumptions regarding security, the security\
    \ considerations only\n       need to meet the intended application scenario rather\
    \ than the\n       general Internet case.  In any case, security issues need to\
    \ be\n       discussed for arbitrary usage scenarios (including the general\n\
    \       Internet case).\n   6.  The proposed header MUST be clearly documented\
    \ in an (Individual\n       or Working Group) Informational RFC, and registered\
    \ with IANA.\n   7.  An applicability statement in the Informational RFC MUST\
    \ clearly\n       document the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its\n\
    \       limitations and why it is not suitable for the general use of SIP\n  \
    \     in the Internet.\n   Any implementation of a \"P-\" header (meaning \"not\
    \ specified by a\n   standards-track RFC issued through the SIP Working Group\"\
    ) MUST\n   include a \"P-\" prefix on the header, as in \"P-Headername\".  Note\
    \ that\n   \"P-\" extensions are not IETF standards of any kind, and MUST NOT\
    \ be\n   required by any production deployment considered compliant to IETF\n\
    \   specifications.  Specifically, implementations are only SIP compliant\n  \
    \ if a) they fall back to baseline behavior when they ignore all P-\n   headers,\
    \ and b) when using P- headers they do not contradict any\n   normative behavior.\n"
- title: '4.2 Preventing Identity Conflicts Between P-Extensions:'
  contents:
  - "4.2 Preventing Identity Conflicts Between P-Extensions:\n   In order to prevent\
    \ identity conflicts between P-headers, this\n   document provides an IANA process\
    \ (See: \"IANA Considerations\" below)\n   to register the P-headers.  The handling\
    \ of unknown P-headers is to\n   ignore them, however, section 4.1 is to be taken\
    \ seriously, and users\n   of P-headers will have best results with adherence.\
    \  All implemented\n   P-headers SHOULD meet the P-Header requirements in 4.1.\
    \  Any P-header\n   used outside of a very restricted research or teaching environment\n\
    \   (such as a student lab on implementing extensions) MUST meet those\n   requirements\
    \ and MUST be documented in an RFC and be IANA registered.\n   IANA registration\
    \ is permitted when the IESG approves the internet-\n   draft.\n"
- title: 4.3 SIP Event Packages
  contents:
  - "4.3 SIP Event Packages\n   events [4] defines two different types of event packages:\
    \ normal\n   event packages, and event template-packages.  Event template-packages\n\
    \   can only be created and registered by the publication of a Standards\n   Track\
    \ RFC (from an IETF Working Group).  Normal event packages can be\n   created\
    \ and registered by the publication of any Working Group RFC\n   (Informational,\
    \ Standards Track, Experimental), provided that the RFC\n   is a chartered working\
    \ group item.\n   Individuals may also wish to publish SIP Event packages.  Individual\n\
    \   proposals for registration of a SIP event package MUST first be\n   published\
    \ as Internet-drafts for review by the SIPPING Working Group,\n   or the working\
    \ group, mailing list, or expert designated by the\n   Transport Area Directors\
    \ if the SIPPING Working Group has closed.\n   Proposals should include a strong\
    \ motivational section, a thorough\n   description of the proposed syntax and\
    \ semantics, event package\n   considerations, security considerations, and examples\
    \ of usage.  The\n   author should submit his or her proposal as an individual\
    \ Internet-\n   Draft, and post an announcement to the working group mailing list\
    \ to\n   begin discussion.  The SIPPING Working Group will determine if the\n\
    \   proposed package is a) an inappropriate usage of SIP, b) applicable\n   to\
    \ SIP but not sufficiently interesting, general, or in-scope to\n   adopt as a\
    \ working group effort, c) contrary to similar work planned\n   in the Working\
    \ Group, or d) should be adopted as or merged with\n   chartered work.\n   The\
    \ IETF requires (Individual) RFC publication for registration of\n   event packages\

    \      guidelines.  The Expert Reviewer will send email to the IESG on\n     \
    \  this determination.  The expert reviewer can cite one or more of\n       the\
    \ guidelines that have not been followed in his/her opinion.\n   2.  The proposed\

    \       behavior of SIP events [4], SIP [3], or related standards track\n    \
    \   extensions.\n   5.  The proposed package MUST NOT undermine SIP security in\
    \ any\n       sense.  The Internet Draft proposing the new package MUST address\n\
    \       security issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track\n       document.\
    \  Security issues need to be discussed for arbitrary\n       usage scenarios\

    \ with IANA.  The\n       package MUST document all the package considerations\
    \ required in\n       Section 5 of SIP events [4].\n   7.  If determined by the\
    \ expert reviewer or the chairs or ADs of the\n       SIPPING WG, an applicability\
    \ statement in the Informational RFC\n       MUST clearly document the useful\

  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   RFC 3261 [3] directs the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA)\n   to establish a registry for SIP method names, a registry\
    \ for SIP\n   option tags, and a registry for SIP response codes, and to amend\
    \ the\n   practices used for the existing registry for SIP headers.\n   With the\
    \ exception of P-headers, entries go into these registries\n   only by approval\
    \ of an Internet-Draft as a standards track RFC.\n   Each RFC shall include an\
    \ IANA Considerations section which directs\n   IANA to create appropriate registrations.\
    \  Registration shall be done\n   at the time the IESG announces its approval\
    \ of the draft containing\n   the registration requests.\n   Standard headers\
    \ and messages MUST NOT begin with the leading\n   characters \"P-\".\n   \"P-\"\
    \ header names MUST begin with the leading characters \"P-\".  No\n   \"P-\" header\
    \ which conflicts with (would, without the \"P-\" prefix have\n   the same name\
    \ as) an existing standards track header is allowed.\n   Each registration of\

    \ without the \"P-\" prefix.  However, the\n   reserved name without the \"P-\"\
    \ will not explicitly appear in the\n   registry.  It will only appear if there\

    \  Please do not accept\n   the registration of IANA-Greeting when you see:  P-IANA-Greeting.\n\
    \   P-header's \"reserved standard names\" MUST NOT be used in a SIP\n   implementation\
    \ prior to standardization of the header.\n   Short forms of headers MUST only\
    \ be assigned to standards track\n   headers.  In other words, P-headers MUST\
    \ NOT have short forms.\n   Similarly, RFC 3265 [4] directs the IANA to establish\
    \ a registry for\n   SIP event packages and SIP event template packages.  For\
    \ event\n   template packages, entries go into this registry only by approval\
    \ of\n   a draft for standards track RFC.  For ordinary event packages,\n   entries\
    \ go into this registry only by approval of a draft for RFC (of\n   any type).\
    \  In either case, the IESG announcement of approval\n   authorizes IANA to make\
