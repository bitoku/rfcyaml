Abstract Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
usages, such as Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) and NAT discovery, are defined in this document to allow an application layer to negotiate STUN usages within the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.
ALPN protocol identifiers defined in this document apply to both TLS and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).
Introduction STUN can be securely transported using TLS over TCP (referred to as TLS [RFC5246]), as specified in [RFC5389], or TLS over UDP (referred to as DTLS [RFC6347]), as specified in [RFC7350].
ALPN [RFC7301] enables an endpoint to positively identify an application protocol in TLS/DTLS and distinguish it from other TLS/ DTLS protocols.
With ALPN, the client sends the list of supported application protocols as part of the TLS/DTLS ClientHello message.
The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol as part of the TLS/DTLS ServerHello message.
Application protocol negotiation can thus be accomplished within the TLS/DTLS handshake, without adding network round trips.
STUN protocol usages, such as TURN [RFC5766], can be used to identify the purpose of a flow without initiating a session.
This document proposes the following ALPN labels to identify STUN protocol [RFC5389]
stun.turn':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN over (D)TLS for TURN
stun.nat discovery':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN over (D)TLS for NAT discovery
The following entries have been added to the "Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by [RFC7301].
The "stun.turn" label identifies the use of TURN usage (D)TLS: Protocol: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
The "stun.nat discovery" label identifies the use of STUN for the purposes of NAT discovery over (D)TLS:
Protocol: NAT discovery using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Identification Sequence:
0x73 0x74 0x75 0x6E 0x2E
This document (RFC 7443) 3.
The ALPN STUN protocol identifier does not introduce any specific security considerations beyond those detailed in the TLS ALPN Extension specification [RFC7301].
It also does not impact the security of TLS/DTLS session establishment or application data exchange.
