  - "1.  Introduction\n   In some situations, there is a need for Mobile IPv4 entities,\
    \ such as\n   the home agent (HA), foreign agent (FA) and mobile node (MN) to\
    \ send\n   and receive asynchronous notification messages during a mobility\n\
    \   session.  In this context, 'Asynchronous messages' is used to mean\n   messages\
    \ that are not synchronous with the Registration Request and\n   Registration\
    \ Reply messages of the base Mobile IP (MIP) specification\n   [RFC5944].  The\
    \ base Mobile IP specification does not have a\n   provision for this.\n   In\
    \ order to rectify that, this document defines a generic\n   notification message\
    \ and a notification model that can be used by\n   Mobile IPv4 entities to send\
    \ various notifications.  It also defines\n   a corresponding acknowledgement\
    \ message to make it possible to ensure\n   reliable delivery of notifications.\
    \  Only the following extensions\n   may be present in these new messages, as\
    \ defined by this document:\n      - MN-HA Authentication Extension\n      - MN-FA\
    \ Authentication Extension\n      - FA-HA Authentication Extension\n      - Message\
    \ String Extension\n   The semantics of receiving a generic notification message\
    \ with a\n   Message String Extension are null; i.e., it has no effect on the\n\
    \   state of a mobile node's existing registration.  See Section 3.1 for\n   some\
    \ application examples that motivate the new messages defined in\n   this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology\
    \ used\n   in [RFC4917] and [RFC5944].  In addition, this document frequently\n\
    \   uses the following terms:\n   Notification Message\n      A message from a\
    \ mobility agent to a an MN or other mobility\n      agent, or from an MN to a\
    \ mobility agent, to asynchronously notify\n      it about an event that is relevant\
    \ to the mobility service it is\n      currently providing.\n   Generic Notification\
    \ Message\n      A Notification Message in the context of Mobile IPv4 with a\n\
    \      well-defined envelope format and extensibility, and with certain\n    \
    \  limitations on how extensions may be defined and used, but\n      otherwise\
    \ generally available for notification purposes within the\n      Mobile IPv4\
    \ protocol.  Abbreviated 'GNM' in this document.\n   Generic Notification Acknowledgement\
    \ Message\n      An acknowledgement of a received Generic Notification Message.\n\
    \      Abbreviated 'GNAM' in this document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Notification Message - Examples
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Notification Message - Examples\n   The simplest usage scenario for a notification\
    \ message is one where\n   the notification has no semantic meaning within the\
    \ protocol; it is\n   only carrying a message that can be displayed to a user\
    \ or an\n   operator (depending on which is the receiving entity -- see more on\n\
    \   this below, in Section 3.2).  Examples of such usage are messages\n   from\
    \ operator to user about billing- or service-related events (\"You\n   have used\
    \ nearly all of your prepaid quota; there are only XX MB left\n   -- please purchase\
    \ further service if you are going to need it.\"; or\n   \"You have now used data\
    \ transfer services for the amount of $XXX\n   since your last bill; this is above\
    \ the notification threshold for\n   your account.\") or messages about service\
    \ interruptions, and more.\n   These examples are all supported by the use of\
    \ the Mobile IPv4\n   Generic Notification Message together with the Message String\n\
    \   Extension, as defined in this document.\n   There are also other examples,\
    \ which cannot be implemented solely\n   using the messages and extensions defined\
    \ in this document.  Some of\n   these are described briefly below, and covered\
    \ slightly more\n   extensively in Section 5.\n   One example of an application\
    \ of an extended Generic Notification\n   Message is that during handover between\
    \ CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO and\n   Wireless LAN, the PPP resource on the CDMA side has\
    \ to be removed on\n   the FA (Packet Data Serving Node) to avoid over-charging\
    \ subscribers.\n   To address this, the Registration Revocation Message was defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC3543], but it would have been preferable to have had it defined\n\
    \   as a separate message (i.e., the Generic Notification Message) with a\n  \
    \ Registration Revocation extension.\n   Other applications are:\n   o  HA switch-over\
    \ (before the HA decides to go off-line, it would\n      like to notify the MNs\
    \ to register with another candidate HA),\n   o  Network Mobility (NEMO) prefix\
    \ changes (an MN is notified by the\n      HA about NEMO prefix changes and service-\
    \ or billing-related\n      events; this is an operational requirement),\n   o\
    \  load balancing (the HA wants to move some of the registered MNs to\n      other\
    \ HAs),\n   o  service termination (due to end of prepaid time), and\n   o  service\
    \ interruption (due to system maintenance).\n"

    \ is a message\n   sent from the HA to the FA(s) or MN to notify the receiving\

    \ for\n   this is clearly laid out in [RFC3543].\n   Another example would be\

    \ for the DNS\n   server or another network server.  Again, this is a case where\

- title: 5.2.  Extension Specification

  - "5.2.  Extension Specification\n   In order to avoid making the MIPv4 Generic\
    \ Notification Message a\n   generic protocol extension mechanism by which new\
    \ protocol mechanisms\n   could be implemented without appropriate discussion\
    \ and approval, any\n   new extensions that are to be used with the Generic Notification\n\
    \   Message must be registered with IANA, where registration is limited\n   by\
    \ the 'RFC Required' policy defined in [RFC5226].\n   If additional extensions\
    \ are specified for use with the Generic\n   Notification Message, the practice\
    \ exemplified in [RFC5944] and\n   related specifications should be followed.\
    \  Generally, it has not\n   been necessary so far to provide versioning support\
    \ within individual\n   extensions; in a few cases, it has been necessary to define\
    \ new\n   extensions with new extension numbers where a generalization of a\n\
    \   pre-existing extension has been needed.  With the current rate of\n   extension\
    \ number consumption, that seems to be an acceptable\n   approach.\n   If at some\
    \ point extensions are specified for use with the Generic\n   Notification Message\
    \ that overlap with pre-existing notification\n   messages, the authors of the\
    \ specification should consider providing\n   a method to flag which notification\
    \ messages are supported, and which\n   notification message usage is requested,\
    \ in a manner similar to the\n   way tunneling method capabilities and usage requests\
    \ are flagged in\n   the Mobile IPv4 base specification [RFC5944].\n   Encoded\
    \ in the extension number of Mobile IPv4 extensions is the\n   notion of 'skippable'\
    \ and 'not skippable' extensions; see Section 1.8\n   of [RFC5944].  This notion\
    \ is also applicable when extensions are\n   used with the Generic Notification\
    \ Message: It is not required that a\n   receiver understand a skippable extension,\
    \ but a non-skippable\n   extension needs to be handled according to Section 1.8\
    \ of [RFC5944]\n   (i.e., the message must be silently discarded if the extension\
    \ is not\n   recognized).  This document does not specify any change from the\n\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This specification operates with the security\
    \ constraints and\n   requirements of [RFC5944].  This means that when this message\
    \ is\n   transmitted between the MN and the HA, the MN-HA AE is REQUIRED; when\n\
    \   this message is transmitted between the MN and the FA, the MN-FA AE\n   is\
    \ REQUIRED; when this message is transmitted between the FA and the\n   HA, the\
    \ FA-HA AE is REQUIRED.  It extends the operations of the MN,\n   HA, and FA defined\
    \ in [RFC5944] to notify each other about some\n   events.  The GNM defined in\
    \ this specification could carry\n   information that modifies the mobility bindings.\
    \  Therefore, the\n   message MUST be integrity protected.  Replay protection\
    \ MUST also be\n   guaranteed.\n   RFC 5944 provides replay protection only for\
    \ Registration Requests\n   sent by the MN.  There is no mechanism for replay\
    \ protection for\n   messages initiated by an FA or HA.  The 64-bit Identification\
    \ field\n   specified in this document (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) for the GNM is used\n\
    \   to provide replay protection for the notification messages initiated\n   by\
    \ the FA or HA.\n"

  - "7.1.  Replay Protection for GNMs and GNAMs\n   The Identification field is used\
    \ to let the receiving node verify\n   that a GNM has been freshly generated by\
    \ the sending node, not\n   replayed by an attacker from some previous notification.\
    \  Two methods\n   are described in this section: timestamps (REQUIRED) and \"\
    nonces\"\n   (OPTIONAL).  All senders and receivers MUST implement timestamp-based\n\
    \   replay protection.  These nodes MAY also implement nonce-based replay\n  \
    \ protection\n   The style of replay protection in effect between any two peer\

    \   A sending node and its receiving node MUST agree on which method of\n   replay\
    \ protection will be used.  The interpretation of the\n   Identification field\
    \ depends on the method of replay protection as\n   described in the subsequent\
    \ subsections.\n   Whatever method is used, the low-order 32 bits of the Identification\n\
    \   field MUST be copied unchanged from the GNM to the GNAM.  The\n   receiver\

    \ corresponding replies.  The receiver MUST verify that\n   the low-order 32 bits\
    \ of any GNAM Identification field are identical\n   to the bits it sent in the\
    \ GNM.\n   The Identification in a new GNM MUST NOT be the same as in an\n   immediately\
    \ preceding GNM, and SHOULD NOT repeat while the same\n   security context is\
    \ being used between the MN and the HA.\n"
- title: 7.1.1.  Replay Protection Using Timestamps
  contents:
  - "7.1.1.  Replay Protection Using Timestamps\n   The basic principle of timestamp\
    \ replay protection is that the node\n   generating a message inserts the current\
    \ time of day, and the node\n   receiving the message checks that this timestamp\
    \ is sufficiently\n   close to its own time of day.  Unless specified differently\
    \ in the\n   security association between the nodes, a default value of 7 seconds\n\
    \   MAY be used to limit the time difference.  This value SHOULD be\n   greater\
    \ than 3 seconds.  Obviously, the two nodes must have\n   adequately synchronized\
    \ time-of-day clocks.  As with any messages,\n   time synchronization messages\
    \ may be protected against tampering by\n   an authentication mechanism determined\
    \ by the security context\n   between the two nodes.\n   In this document, the\
    \ timestamps are used, and the sender MUST set\n   the Identification field to\
    \ a 64-bit value formatted as specified by\n   the Network Time Protocol (NTP)\
    \ [RFC5905].  The low-order 32 bits of\n   the NTP format represent fractional\
    \ seconds.  Note, however, that\n   when using timestamps, the 64-bit Identification\
    \ used in a GNM from\n   the sender MUST be greater than that used in any previous\
    \ GNM, as the\n   receiver uses this field also as a sequence number.  Without\
    \ such a\n   sequence number, it would be possible for a delayed duplicate of\
    \ an\n   earlier GNM to arrive at the receiver (within the clock\n   synchronization\
    \ required by the receiver), and thus be applied out of\n   order, mistakenly\
    \ altering the sender's current status.\n   Upon receipt of a GNM with an authorization-enabling\
    \ extension, the\n   receiver MUST check the Identification field for validity.\
    \  In order\n   to be valid, the timestamp contained in the Identification field\
    \ MUST\n   be close enough to the receiver's time-of-day clock and the timestamp\n\
    \   MUST be greater than all previously accepted timestamps for the\n   requesting\
    \ sender.  Time tolerances and re-synchronization details\n   are specific to\
    \ a particular mobility security association.\n   If the timestamp is valid, the\
    \ receiver copies the entire\n   Identification field into the GNAM, and it returns\
    \ the GNAM to the\n   sender.  If the timestamp is not valid, the receiver copies\
    \ only the\n   low-order 32 bits into the GNAM, and supplies the high-order 32\
    \ bits\n   from its own time of day.  In this latter case, the receiver MUST\n\
    \   reject the notification by returning Code 69, 133, or 197\n   (notification\
    \ Identification mismatch) in the GNAM.\n   Furthermore, the receiver MUST verify\
    \ that the low-order 32 bits of\n   the Identification in the GNAM are identical\
    \ to those in the rejected\n   GNM attempt, before using the high-order bits for\
    \ clock re-\n   synchronization.\n"
- title: 7.1.2.  Replay Protection Using Nonces
  contents:
  - "7.1.2.  Replay Protection Using Nonces\n   The basic principle of nonce replay\
    \ protection is that node A\n   includes a new random number in every message\
    \ to node B, and checks\n   that node B returns that same number in its next message\
    \ to node A.\n   Both messages use an authentication code to protect against\n\
    \   alteration by an attacker.  At the same time, node B can send its own\n  \
    \ nonces in all messages to node A (to be echoed by node A), so that it\n   too\
    \ can verify that it is receiving fresh messages.\n   The receiver may be expected\
    \ to have resources for computing pseudo-\n   random numbers useful as nonces,\
    \ according to [RFC4086].  It inserts\n   a new nonce as the high-order 32 bits\
    \ of the Identification field of\n   every GNAM.  The receiver copies the low-order\
    \ 32 bits of the\n   Identification field from the GNM into the low-order 32 bits\
    \ of the\n   Identification field in the GNAM.  When the sender receives an\n\
    \   authenticated GNAM from the receiver, it saves the high-order 32 bits\n  \
    \ of the Identification field for use as the high-order 32 bits of its\n   next\
    \ GNM.\n   The sender is responsible for generating the low-order 32 bits of the\n\
    \   Identification field in each GNM.  Ideally, it should generate its\n   own\
    \ random nonces.  However, it may use any expedient method,\n   including duplication\
    \ of the random value sent by the receiver.  The\n   method chosen is of concern\
    \ only to the sender because it is the node\n   that checks for valid values in\
    \ the GNAM.  The high-order and low-\n   order 32 bits of the Identification chosen\
    \ SHOULD both differ from\n   their previous values.  For each notification message,\
    \ the receiver\n   uses a new high-order value and the sender uses a new low-order\n\
    \   value.\n   If a GNM is rejected because of an invalid nonce, the GNAM always\n\
    \   provides the sender with a new nonce to be used in the next message.\n   Thus,\
    \ the nonce protocol is self-synchronizing.\n"
