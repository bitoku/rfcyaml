  - "1.  Introduction\n   GEOPRIV is a standard for the transmission of location information\n\
    \   and privacy policies over the Internet.  Location information is a\n   description\
    \ of a particular spatial location, which may be\n   represented as coordinates\
    \ (via longitude, latitude, and so on), as\n   civil addresses (such as postal\
    \ addresses), or in other ways.\n   GEOPRIV focuses on the privacy and security\
    \ issues, from both a\n   technology perspective and a policy perspective, of\
    \ sharing location\n   information over the Internet; it essentially defines a\
    \ secure\n   container class capable of carrying both location information and\n\
    \   policy data governing the distribution of this information.  GEOPRIV\n   also\
    \ defines the concept of a 'using protocol' -- a protocol that\n   carries the\
    \ GEOPRIV location object.\n   Presence is a service defined in RFC2778 [2] that\
    \ allows users of a\n   communications service to monitor one another's availability\
    \ and\n   disposition in order to make decisions about communicating.  Presence\n\
    \   information is highly dynamic, and it generally characterizes whether\n  \
    \ a user is online or offline, busy or idle, away from communications\n   devices\
    \ or nearby, and the like.\n   This document shows the applicability of presence\
    \ to GEOPRIV and\n   shows that a presence protocol could be a suitable using\
    \ protocol for\n   GEOPRIV.  This document is not intended to demonstrate that\
    \ presence\n   is the only method by which GEOPRIV location objects might be\n\
    \   distributed.  However, there are numerous applications of GEOPRIV\n   that\
    \ depend on the fundamental subscription/notification architecture\n   that also\
    \ underlies presence.\n"
- title: 2.  Framework Analysis
  contents:
  - "2.  Framework Analysis\n   The GEOPRIV framework [1] defines four primary network\
    \ entities: a\n   Location Generator, a Location Server, a Location Recipient,\
    \ and a\n   Rule Holder.  Three interfaces between these entities are defined,\n\
    \   including a publication interface and a notification interface.\n   GEOPRIV\
    \ specifies that a 'using protocol' is employed to transport\n   location objects\
    \ from one place to another.  If the publication\n   interface and notification\
    \ interface are network connections, then a\n   using protocol would be responsible\
    \ for the transmission of the\n   location object.  Location Recipients may request\
    \ that a Location\n   Server provide them with GEOPRIV location information concerning\
    \ a\n   particular Target.  The Location Generator publishes Location\n   Information\
    \ to a Location Server, which, in coordination with\n   policies set by the Rule\
    \ Maker, distributes the location information\n   to Location Recipients as necessary.\n\
    \   The GEOPRIV requirements document shows three scenarios for the use\n   of\
    \ the GEOPRIV protocol.  In some of these scenarios (such as the\n   third), a\
    \ Location Recipient sends some kind of message to the\n   Location Server to\
    \ request the periodic transmission of location\n   information.  The location\
    \ of a GEOPRIV Target is likely to vary over\n   time (if the Target is a person,\
    \ or something similarly mobile), and\n   consequently the concept of a persistent\
    \ subscription to the location\n   of a Target resulting in periodic notification\
    \ is valuable to\n   GEOPRIV.  In other scenarios, a Location Recipient may request\
    \ a one-\n   time notification of the geographical location of the Target.\n \
    \  GEOPRIV places few requirements on using protocols.  However, it is\n   clear\
    \ from the description above that there must be some mechanism\n   allowing Location\
    \ Recipients to establish a persistent subscription\n   in order to receive regular\
    \ notification of the geographical location\n   of a Target as their location\
    \ changes over time.  There must also be\n   a way for Location Generators to\
    \ publish location information to a\n   Location Server that applies further policies\
    \ for distribution.\n   This document adopts a model in which the using protocol\
    \ is\n   responsible for requesting subscriptions, handling publications, and\n\
    \   sending notifications.  There are other models for GEOPRIV in which\n   these\
    \ operations might be built into location objects themselves.\n   However, there\
    \ is a significant amount of pre-existing work in the\n   IETF related to managing\
    \ publications, subscriptions, and\n   notifications for data sets that vary over\
    \ time.  In fact, these\n   concepts all correspond exactly to architectures for\
    \ presence that\n   have been developed in support of real-time communications\n\
    \   applications such as instant messaging, voice and video sessions.\n   Note\
    \ that in some GEOPRIV scenarios, the Location Recipient does not\n   actively\
    \ request the location of a Target; rather, it receives an\n   unsolicited notification\
    \ of Target's location.  This document focuses\n   on the use of presence only\
    \ for scenarios in which the Location\n   Recipient actively solicits location\
    \ information.  However, it is\n   possible that many of these base operations\
    \ of the\n   subscription/notification framework of presence could be reused for\n\
    \   cases in which the Location Recipient is passive.\n"
- title: 3.  Presence Architecture for GEOPRIV
  contents:
  - "3.  Presence Architecture for GEOPRIV\n   The Common Profile for Presence [4]\
    \ (CPP) defines a set of operations\n   for delivery of presence information.\
    \  These primarily consist of\n   subscription operations and notification operations.\
    \  A subscription\n   creates a persistent connection between a 'watcher' (which\n\
    \   corresponds to the Location Recipient of GEOPRIV) and a 'presentity'\n   (which\
    \ corresponds roughly to the GEOPRIV target).  When a watcher\n   subscribes to\
    \ a presentity, a persistent connection is created;\n   notifications of presence\
    \ information will henceforth be sent to the\n   watcher as the presence information\
    \ changes.  CPP also supports\n   unsubscriptions (terminating the persistent\
    \ subscription) and fetches\n   (one-time requests for presence information that\
    \ do not result in a\n   persistent subscription).\n   CPP provides a number of\
    \ attributes of these operations that flesh\n   out the presence system.  There\
    \ is a system for automatically\n   expiring subscriptions if they are not refreshed\
    \ at user-defined\n   intervals (in order to eliminate stale subscriptions). \
    \ There are\n   transaction and subscription identifiers used to correlate messages,\n\
    \   and a URI scheme (\"pres:\") is defined to identify watchers and\n   presentities.\n\
    \   The IETF IMPP WG has also defined an XML data format for presence\n   information,\
    \ called the Presence Information Data Format [5] (PIDF).\n   PIDF is a body that\
    \ is carried by presence protocols and that\n   contains presence information,\
    \ including the current state of a\n   presentity.  PIDF is discussed in more\
    \ detail in Section 4.\n   At a high level, then, the presence architecture seems\
    \ to have\n   considerable applicability to the problem of delivering GEOPRIV\n\
    \   information.  However, the CPP framework is an abstract framework:\n   it\
    \ doesn't actually specify a protocol, instead it specifies a\n   framework and\
    \ a set of requirements to which presence protocols must\n   conform.  Also, CPP\
    \ does not define any concept similar to a Location\n   Server.\n   However, the\
    \ IETF has standardized protocols that instantiate this\n   framework, such as\
    \ SIMPLE [6] and XMPP [7].  XMPP and SIMPLE both\n   have architectural elements\
    \ comparable to a Location Server: points\n   where presentities register their\
    \ availability, and where policies\n   for distributing presence can be managed.\
    \  The presence community has\n   also defined a policy protocol and schema set\
    \ called XCAP [8] through\n   which authorization policies can be provisioned\
    \ in a presence server.\n   In summary, like GEOPRIV, presence requires an architecture\
    \ for\n   publication, subscription, and notification for a mutable set of data\n\
    \   associated with a principal.  Presence has already tackled many of\n   the\
    \ harder issues associated with subscription management, including\n   subscription\
    \ expiration, development of identifiers for principals,\n   and defining document\
    \ formats for presence information.  Rather than\n   reinvent work that has been\
    \ done elsewhere in the IETF, GEOPRIV has\n   reused this existing work by specifying\
    \ presence protocols as GEOPRIV\n   using protocols.  Moreover, the existing foundational\
    \ presence tools\n   developed in IMPP, such as PIDF, have immediate applicability\
    \ to the\n   efforts underway in GEOPRIV to develop objects for sharing location\n\
    \   information.\n"
- title: 4.  GEOPRIV Extensions to PIDF
  contents:
  - "4.  GEOPRIV Extensions to PIDF\n   As was mentioned above, the presence architecture\
    \ developed in the\n   IETF IMPP WG has defined a format for presence information\
    \ called\n   PIDF.  PIDF is an XML format that provides presence information about\n\
    \   a presentity.  Primarily, this consists of status information, but it\n  \
    \ also optionally includes contact addresses (a way of reaching the\n   presentity),\
    \ timestamps, and textual notes with arbitrary content.\n   PIDF is an extensible\
    \ format.  It defines an XML element for\n   representing the status of a presentity\
    \ (the status element), and it\n   gives some guidance as to how this element\
    \ might be extended.\n   Although the authors of PIDF viewed geographical location\
    \ as a\n   potential category of presence information, baseline PIDF defines no\n\
    \   format for location information.\n   PIDF meets the security requirements\
    \ given in RFC2779 [3] (see\n   especially sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3), which\
    \ parallel those of the\n   GEOPRIV location object given in the GEOPRIV requirements\
    \ [1].  CPP\n   and PIDF specify mechanisms for mutual authentication of participants\n\
    \   in a presence exchange as well as for confidentiality and integrity\n   properties\
    \ for presence information.\n   In short, many of the requirements of GEOPRIV\
    \ objects map well onto\n   the capabilities of PIDF.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   GEOPRIV information, like presence information,\
    \ has very sensitive\n   security requirements.  The requirements of RFC2779 [3],\
    \ which are\n   instantiated by CPP, PIDF, and XCAP, in addition to the various\n\
    \   derivative concrete presence protocols, such as XMPP and SIMPLE, map\n   well\
    \ onto the security requirements of the GEOPRIV protocol, as\n   defined in the\
    \ GEOPRIV requirements document and the GEOPRIV threat\n   analysis [9] document.\
    \  Specifically, the presence security\n   requirements call for authentication\
    \ of watchers, integrity and\n   confidentiality properties, and similar measures\
    \ to prevent abuse of\n   presence information.\n"
