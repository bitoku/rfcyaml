Abstract This document describes how Kerberos Version 5 [1] is used with the telnet protocol.
It describes an telnet authentication suboption to be used with the telnet authentication option [2].
This mechanism can also used to provide keying material to provide data confidentiality services in conjunction with the telnet encryption option [3].
Command Names and Codes Authentication Types KERBEROS V5    2 Sub option Commands
Command Meanings IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication type pair> AUTH
This is used to pass the Kerberos V5 [1] KRB AP REQ message to the remote side of the connection.
The first octet of the <authentication type pair> value is KERBEROS V5, to indicate that Version 5 of Kerberos is being used.
The Kerberos V5 authenticator in the KRB AP REQ message must contain a Kerberos V5 checksum of the two byte authentication type pair.
This checksum must be verified by the server to assure that the authentication type pair was correctly negotiated.
The Kerberos V5 authenticator must also include the optional subkey field, which shall be filled in with a randomly chosen key.
This key shall be used for encryption purposes if encryption is negotiated, and shall be used as the negotiated session key (i.e., used as keyid 0) for the purposes of the telnet encryption option; if the subkey is not filled in, then the ticket session key will be used instead.
If data confidentiality services is desired the ENCRYPT US  ING TELOPT flag must be set in the authentication type pair as specified in [2].
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair>
This command indicates that the authentication was successful.
If the AUTH HOW MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of the authentication type pair, the RESPONSE command must be sent before the ACCEPT command is sent.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair> REJECT <optional reason for rejection>
This command indicates that the authentication was not successful, and if there is any more data in the sub option, it is an ASCII text message of the reason for the rejection.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair>
RESPONSE <KRB AP REP message> IAC SE
This command is used to perform mutual authentication.
It is only used when the AUTH HOW MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of the authentication type pair.
After an AUTH command is verified, a RESPONSE command is sent which contains a Kerberos V5 KRB AP REP message to perform the mutual authentication.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication type pair
> FORWARD <KRB CRED message> IAC SE
This command is used to forward kerberos credentials for use by the remote session.
The credentials are passed as a Kerberos V5 KRB CRED message which includes, among other things, the forwarded Kerberos ticket and a session key associated with the ticket.
Part of the KRB CRED message is encrypted in the key previously exchanged for the telnet session by the AUTH suboption.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication type pair
> FORWARD ACCEPT IAC SE
This command indicates that the credential forwarding was successful.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication type pair
> FORWARD REJECT <optional reason for rejection>
This command indicates that the credential forwarding was not successful, and if there is any more data in the suboption, it is an ASCII text message of the reason for the rejection.
If the second octet of the authentication type pair has the AUTH WHO bit set to AUTH CLIENT TO SERVER, then the client sends the initial AUTH command, and the server responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
In addition, if the AUTH HOW bit is set to AUTH HOW MUTUAL, the server will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.
If the second octet of the authentication type pair has the AUTH WHO bit set to AUTH SERVER TO CLIENT, then the server sends the initial AUTH command, and the client responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
In addition, if the AUTH HOW bit is set to AUTH HOW MUTUAL, the client will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.
The Kerberos principal used by the server will generally be of the form "host/<hostname>@realm".
That is, the first component of the Kerberos principal is "host"; the second component is the fully qualified lower case hostname of the server; and the realm is the Kerberos realm to which the server belongs.
Any Telnet IAC characters that occur in the KRB AP REQ or KRB AP REP messages, the KRB CRED structure, or the optional rejection text string must be doubled as specified in [4].
Otherwise the following byte might be mis interpreted as a Telnet command.
Examples User "joe" may wish to log in as user "pete" on machine "foo".
If "pete" has set things up on "foo" to allow "joe" access to his account, then the client would send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete" IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION
<KRB AP REQ MESSAGE> IAC SE
The server would then authenticate the user as "joe" from the KRB AP REQ MESSAGE, and if the KRB AP REQ MESSAGE was accepted by Kerberos, and if "pete" has allowed "joe" to use his account, the server would then continue the authentication sequence by sending a RESPONSE (to do mutual authentication, if it was requested) followed by the ACCEPT.
If forwarding has been requested, the client then sends IAC SB AUTHENTICATION
KERBEROS V5 CLIENT MUTUAL FORWARD <KRB CRED structure with credentials to be forwarded> IAC SE.
If the server succeeds in reading the forwarded credentials, the server sends FORWARD ACCEPT else, a FORWARD REJECT is sent back.
[ The server is now free to request authentication information. ]
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION SEND KERBEROS V5
CLIENT MUTUAL KERBEROS V5 CLIENT ONE WAY IAC SE
[ The server has requested mutual Version 5 Kerberos authentication.
If mutual authentication is not supported, then the server is willing to do one way authentication.
The client will now respond with the name of the user that it wants to log in as, and the Kerberos ticket.
] IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete" IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS KERBEROS V5 CLIENT
IAC SE [ Since mutual authentication is desired, the server sends across a RESPONSE to prove that it really is the right server.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY KERBEROS V5 CLIENT MUTUAL RESPONSE <KRB AP REP message> IAC SE
[ The server responds with an ACCEPT command to state that the authentication was successful.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY KERBEROS V5 CLIENT MUTUAL ACCEPT IAC SE [ If so requested, the client now sends the FORWARD command to forward credentials to the remote site.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS KER  BEROS V5 CLIENT MUTUAL FORWARD <KRB CRED message> IAC SE
[ The server responds with a FORWARD ACCEPT command to state that the credential forwarding was successful.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY KERBEROS V5 CLIENT MUTUAL FORWARD ACCEPT IAC SE 5.
The selection of the random session key in the Kerberos V5 authenticator is critical, since this key will be used for encrypting the telnet data stream if encryption is enabled.
It is strongly advised that the random key selection be done using cryptographic techniques that involve the Kerberos ticket's session key.
For example, using the current time, encrypting it with the ticket session key, and then correcting for key parity is a strong way to generate a subsession key, since the ticket session key is assumed to be never disclosed to an attacker.
Care should be taken before forwarding a user's Kerberos credentials to the remote server.
If the remote server is not trustworthy, this could result in the user's credentials being compromised.
Hence, the user interface should not forward credentials by default
; it would be far safer to either require the user to explicitly request credentials forwarding for each connection, or to have a trusted list of hosts for which credentials forwarding is enabled, but to not enable credentials forwarding by default for all machines.
The IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME name IAC SE message is unprotected in this protocol.
Its contents should be verified by a secure method after authentication completes before it is used.
The authentication type KERBEROS V5 and its associated suboption values are registered with IANA.
Any suboption values used to extend the protocol as described in this document must be registered with IANA before use.
IANA is instructed not to issue new suboption values without submission of documentation of their use.
