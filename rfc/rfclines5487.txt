Abstract RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre shared key cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).
However, all those cipher suites use SHA 1 in their Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.
This document describes a set of pre shared key cipher suites for TLS that uses stronger digest algorithms (i.e., SHA 256 or SHA 384) and another set that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).
The benefits of pre shared symmetric key vs. public /private key pair based authentication for the key exchange in TLS have been explained in the Introduction of [RFC4279].
This document leverages the already defined algorithms for the application of newer, generally regarded stronger, cryptographic primitives and building blocks.
TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] adds support for authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) cipher modes [RFC5116].
This document describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] in Galois Counter Mode [GCM] (AES GCM) with various pre shared key (PSK) authenticated key exchange mechanisms ([RFC4279] and [RFC4785]) in cipher suites for TLS.
This document also specifies PSK cipher suites for TLS that replace SHA 1 by SHA 256 or SHA 384 [SHS].
[RFC4785] describe PSK cipher suites for TLS.
However, all of the RFC 4279 and the RFC 4785 cipher suites use HMAC SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.
Due to recent analytic work on SHA 1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away from SHA 1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.
Related TLS cipher suites with key exchange algorithms that are authenticated using public/private key pairs have recently been specified:
RSA , DSS , and Diffie Hellman based cipher suites in [RFC5288], and
ECC based cipher suites with SHA 256/384 and AES GCM in [RFC5289].
The reader is expected to become familiar with these two memos prior to studying this document.
The cipher suites defined in Section 3 can be negotiated, whatever the negotiated TLS version is.
The cipher suites defined in Section 2 can be negotiated in TLS version 1.2 or higher.
The applicability statement in [RFC4279] applies to this document as well.

PSK, DHE PSK, and RSA PSK Key Exchange Algorithms with AES GCM
The following six cipher suites use the new authenticated encryption modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode [GCM].
The cipher suites with the DHE PSK key exchange algorithm (TLS DHE PSK WITH AES 128 GCM SHA256 and TLS DHE PSK WITH AES 256 GCM SHA348) provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
CipherSuite TLS PSK WITH AES 128 GCM
GCM is used as described in [RFC5288].
The PSK, DHE PSK, and RSA PSK key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC4279].
The Pseudo Random Function (PRF)
algorithms SHALL be as follows:
For cipher suites ending with  SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
For cipher suites ending with  SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 384 as the hash function.
Implementations MUST send a TLS Alert 'bad record mac' for all types of failures encountered in processing the AES GCM algorithm.
PSK, DHE PSK, and RSA PSK Key Exchange with SHA 256/384
The first two cipher suites described in each of the following three sections
use AES [AES] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode [MODES] for data confidentiality, whereas the other two cipher suites do not provide data confidentiality; all cipher suites provide integrity protection and authentication using HMAC based MACs.
PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with SHA 256/384 CipherSuite TLS PSK WITH AES 128
0x00,0xB1}; The above four cipher suites are the same as the corresponding cipher suites in RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 (with names ending in " SHA" in place of " SHA256" or " SHA384"), except for the hash and PRF algorithms, as explained below.
For cipher suites with names ending in " SHA256":
The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
When negotiated in a version of TLS prior to 1.2, the PRF from that version is used; otherwise, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
For cipher suites with names ending in " SHA384":
The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA 384 as the hash function.
When negotiated in a version of TLS prior to 1.2, the PRF from that version is used; otherwise, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 384 as the hash function.

RSA PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with SHA 256/384 CipherSuite TLS RSA PSK WITH AES 128
The security considerations in [RFC4279], [RFC4785], and [RFC5288] apply to this document as well.
In particular, as authentication  only cipher suites (with no encryption) defined here do not support confidentiality, care should be taken not to send sensitive information (such as passwords) over connections protected with one of the cipher suites with NULL encryption defined in this document.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned the following values for the cipher suites defined in this document: CipherSuite TLS PSK WITH AES 128 GCM
