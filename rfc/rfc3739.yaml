  - "Abstract\n   This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for\n\
    \   identity certificates issued to natural persons.\n   The profile defines specific\
    \ conventions for certificates that are\n   qualified within a defined legal framework,\
    \ named Qualified\n   Certificates.  However, the profile does not define any\
    \ legal\n   requirements for such Qualified Certificates.\n   The goal of this\
    \ document is to define a certificate profile that\n   supports the issuance of\
    \ Qualified Certificates independent of local\n   legal requirements.  The profile\
    \ is however not limited to Qualified\n   Certificates and further profiling may\
    \ facilitate specific local\n   needs.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification is one part of a family of standards\
    \ for the X.509\n   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet.  It is based\
    \ on\n   [X.509] and [RFC 3280], which defines underlying certificate formats\n\
    \   and semantics needed for a full implementation of this standard.\n   This\
    \ profile includes specific mechanisms intended for use with\n   Qualified Certificates.\
    \  The term Qualified Certificates and the\n   assumptions that affect the scope\
    \ of this document are discussed in\n   Section 2.\n   Section 3 defines requirements\
    \ on certificate information content.\n   This specification provides profiles\
    \ for two certificate fields:\n   issuer and subject.  It also provides profiles\
    \ for four certificate\n   extensions defined in RFC 3280: subject alternate name,\
    \ subject\n   directory attributes, certificate policies, and key usage, and it\n\
    \   defines two additional extensions: biometric information and\n   qualified\
    \ certificate statements.  The certificate extensions are\n   presented in the\
    \ 1997 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680],\n   but in conformance with\
    \ RFC 3280 the 1988 ASN.1 module in Appendix A\n   contains all normative definitions\
    \ (the 1997 module in Appendix A is\n   informative).\n   In Section 4, some security\
    \ considerations are discussed in order to\n   clarify the security context in\
    \ which the standard may be utilized.\n   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1\
    \ structures that are not\n   already defined in RFC 3280.  Appendix B contains\
    \ a note on\n   attributes.  Appendix C contains an example certificate.\n   The\
    \ appendices sections are followed by the References, Authors\n   Addresses, and\
    \ the Full Copyright Statement.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Changes since RFC 3039
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Changes since RFC 3039\n   This specification obsoletes RFC 3039.  This\
    \ specification differs\n   from RFC 3039 in the following basic areas:\n    \
    \  *  Some editorial clarifications have been made to introductory\n         sections\
    \ to clarify that this profile is generally applicable\n         to a broad type\
    \ of certificates, even if its prime purpose is\n         to facilitate issuance\
    \ of Qualified Certificates.\n      *  To align with RFC 3280, support for domainComponent\
    \ and title\n         attributes in subject names are included, and postalAddress\
    \ is\n         no longer supported.\n      *  To align with actual usage, support\
    \ for the title attribute in\n         the subject directory attributes extension\
    \ is no longer\n         supported.\n      *  To better facilitate broad applicability\
    \ of this profile, some\n         constraints on key usage settings in the key\
    \ usage extension\n         have been removed.\n      *  A new qc-Statement reflecting\
    \ this second version of the\n         profile has been defined in Section 3.2.6.1.\
    \  This profile\n         obsoletes RFC 3039, but the qc-statement reflecting\
    \ compliance\n         with RFC 3039 is also defined for backwards compatibility.\n"

  - "1.2.  Definitions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ BCP 14, [RFC 2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements and Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements and Assumptions\n   The term \"Qualified Certificate\" is used\
    \ by the European Directive on\n   Electronic Signature [EU-ESDIR] to refer to\
    \ a specific type of\n   certificates, with appliance in European electronic signature\n\
    \   legislation.  This specification is intended to support this class of\n  \
    \ certificates, but its scope is not limited to this application.\n   Within this\
    \ standard, the term \"Qualified Certificate\" is used\n   generally, describing\
    \ a certificate whose primary purpose is to\n   identify a person with a high\
    \ level of assurance, where the\n   certificate meets some qualification requirements\
    \ defined by an\n   applicable legal framework, such as the European Directive\
    \ on\n   Electronic Signature [EU-ESDIR].  The actual mechanisms that decide\n\
    \   whether a certificate should or should not be considered a \"Qualified\n \
    \  Certificate\" in regard to any legislation are outside the scope of\n   this\
    \ standard.\n   Harmonization in the field of identity certificates issued to\
    \ natural\n   persons, in particular Qualified Certificates, is essential within\n\
    \   several aspects that fall outside the scope of RFC 3280.  The most\n   important\
    \ aspects that affect the scope of this specification are:\n   -  Definition of\
    \ names and identity information in order to identify\n      the associated subject\
    \ in a uniform way.\n   -  Definition of information which identifies the CA and\
    \ the\n      jurisdiction under which the CA operates when issuing a particular\n\
    \      certificate.\n   -  Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified\n\
    \      Certificates.\n   -  Definition of information structure for storage of\
    \ biometric\n      information.\n   -  Definition of a standardized way to store\
    \ predefined statements\n      with relevance for Qualified Certificates.\n  \
    \ -  Requirements for critical extensions.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Properties
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Properties\n   This profile accommodates profiling needs for Qualified\
    \ Certificates\n   based on the assumptions that:\n   -  Qualified Certificates\
    \ are issued by a CA that makes a statement\n      that the certificate serves\
    \ the purpose of a Qualified\n      Certificate, as discussed in Section 2.2.\n\
    \   -  The Qualified Certificate indicates a certificate policy\n      consistent\
    \ with liabilities, practices, and procedures undertaken\n      by the CA, as\
    \ discussed in Section 2.3.\n   -  The Qualified Certificate is issued to a natural\
    \ person (living\n      human being).\n   -  The Qualified Certificate contains\
    \ a name which may be either\n      based on the real name of the subject or a\
    \ pseudonym.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Statement of Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Statement of Purpose\n   This profile defines conventions to declare within\
    \ a certificate that\n   it serves the purpose of being a Qualified Certificate.\
    \  This enables\n   the CA to explicitly define this intent.\n   The function\
    \ of this declaration is thus to assist any concerned\n   entity in evaluating\
    \ the risk associated with creating or accepting\n   signatures that are based\
    \ on a Qualified Certificate.\n   This profile defines two ways to include this\
    \ information:\n   -  As information defined by a certificate policy included\
    \ in the\n      certificate policies extension, and\n   -  As a statement included\
    \ in the Qualified Certificates Statements\n      extension.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Policy Issues
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Policy Issues\n   Certain policy aspects define the context in which this\
    \ profile is to\n   be understood and used.  It is however outside the scope of\
    \ this\n   profile to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern\n\
    \   services that issue or utilize certificates according to this\n   profile.\n\
    \   It is however an underlying assumption in this profile that a\n   responsible\
    \ issuing CA will undertake to follow a certificate policy\n   that is consistent\
    \ with its liabilities, practices, and procedures.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Uniqueness of names
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Uniqueness of names\n   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501\
    \ [X.501] as a\n   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct\
    \ that\n   identifies a particular object from among a set of all objects.  The\n\
    \   distinguished name MUST be unique for each subject entity certified\n   by\
    \ the one CA as defined by the issuer name field, for the whole life\n   time\
    \ of the CA.\n"
- title: 3.  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile
  contents:
  - "3.  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile\n   This section defines certificate\
    \ profiling conventions.  The profile\n   is based on the Internet certificate\
    \ profile RFC 3280, which in turn\n   is based on the X.509 version 3 format.\
    \  For full implementation of\n   this section, implementers are REQUIRED to consult\
    \ the underlying\n   formats and semantics defined in RFC 3280.\n   ASN.1 definitions,\
    \ relevant for this section that are not supplied by\n   RFC 3280, are supplied\
    \ in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Basic Certificate Fields
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Basic Certificate Fields\n   This section provides additional details regarding\
    \ the contents of\n   two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields are the\
    \ issuer and\n   subject fields.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Issuer
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Issuer\n   The issuer field SHALL identify the organization responsible\
    \ for\n   issuing the certificate.  The name SHOULD be an officially registered\n\
    \   name of the organization.\n   The distinguished name of the issuer SHALL be\
    \ specified using an\n   appropriate subset of the following attributes:\n   \
    \   domainComponent;\n      countryName;\n      stateOrProvinceName;\n      organizationName;\n\
    \      localityName; and\n      serialNumber.\n   The domainComponent attribute\
    \ is defined in [RFC 2247], all other\n   attributes are defined in [RFC 3280]\
    \ and [X.520].\n   Additional attributes MAY be present, but they SHOULD NOT be\n\
    \   necessary to identify the issuing organization.\n   A relying party MAY have\
    \ to consult associated certificate policies\n   and/or the issuer's CPS, in order\
    \ to determine the semantics of name\n   fields.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Subject
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Subject\n   The subject field of a certificate compliant with this profile\
    \ SHALL\n   contain a distinguished name of the subject (see 2.4 for definition\n\
    \   of distinguished name).\n   The subject field SHALL contain an appropriate\
    \ subset of the\n   following attributes:\n      domainComponent;\n      countryName;\n\
    \      commonName;\n      surname;\n      givenName;\n      pseudonym;\n     \
    \ serialNumber;\n      title;\n      organizationName;\n      organizationalUnitName;\n\
    \      stateOrProvinceName; and\n      localityName.\n   The domainComponent attribute\
    \ is defined in [RFC 2247], all other\n   attributes are defined in [RFC 3280]\
    \ and [X.520].\n   Other attributes MAY also be present; however, the use of other\n\
    \   attributes MUST NOT be necessary to distinguish one subject name from\n  \
    \ another subject name.  That is, the attributes listed above are\n   sufficient\
    \ to ensure unique subject names.\n   Of these attributes, the subject field SHALL\
    \ include at least one of\n   the following:\n      Choice   I:  commonName\n\
    \      Choice  II:  givenName\n      Choice III:  pseudonym\n      The countryName\
    \ attribute value specifies a general context in\n      which other attributes\
    \ are to be understood.  The country\n      attribute does not necessarily indicate\
    \ the subject's country of\n      citizenship or country of residence, nor does\
    \ it have to indicate\n      the country of issuance.\n   Note: Many X.500 implementations\
    \ require the presence of countryName\n   in the DIT.  In cases where the subject\
    \ name, as specified in the\n   subject field, specifies a public X.500 directory\
    \ entry, the\n   countryName attribute SHOULD always be present.\n      The commonName\
    \ attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name\n      of the subject. \
    \ This MAY be in the subject's preferred\n      presentation format, or a format\
    \ preferred by the CA, or some\n      other format.  Pseudonyms, nicknames, and\
    \ names with spelling\n      other than defined by the registered name MAY be\
    \ used.  To\n      understand the nature of the name presented in commonName,\n\
    \      complying applications MAY have to examine present values of the\n    \
    \  givenName and surname attributes, or the pseudonym attribute.\n   Note: Many\
    \ client implementations presuppose the presence of the\n   commonName attribute\
    \ value in the subject field and use this value to\n   display the subject's name\
    \ regardless of present givenName, surname,\n   or pseudonym attribute values.\n\
    \      The surname and givenName attribute types SHALL be used in the\n      subject\
    \ field if neither the commonName attribute nor the\n      pseudonym attribute\
    \ is present.  In cases where the subject only\n      has a givenName, the surname\
    \ attribute SHALL be omitted.\n      The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present,\
    \ contain a\n      pseudonym of the subject.  Use of the pseudonym attribute MUST\
    \ NOT\n      be combined with use of any of the attributes surname and/or\n  \
    \    givenName.\n      The serialNumber attribute type SHALL, when present, be\
    \ used to\n      differentiate between names where the subject field would\n \
    \     otherwise be identical.  This attribute has no defined semantics\n     \
    \ beyond ensuring uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY contain a\n      number\
    \ or code assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a\n      government\
    \ or civil authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to\n      ensure that the\
    \ serialNumber is sufficient to resolve any subject\n      name collisions.\n\
    \      The title attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to store a\n    \
    \  designated position or function of the subject within the\n      organization\
    \ specified by present organizational attributes in the\n      subject field.\
    \  The association between the title, the subject,\n      and the organization\
    \ is beyond the scope of this document.\n      The organizationName and the organizationalUnitName\
    \ attribute\n      types SHALL, when present, be used to store the name and relevant\n\
    \      information of an organization with which the subject is\n      associated.\
    \  The type of association between the organization and\n      the subject is\
    \ beyond the scope of this document.\n      The stateOrProvinceName and the localityName\
    \ attribute types\n      SHALL, when present, be used to store geographical information\n\
    \      with which the subject is associated.  If an organizationName\n      value\
    \ is also present, then the stateOrProvinceName and\n      localityName attribute\
    \ values SHALL be associated with the\n      specified organization.  The type\
    \ of association between the\n      stateOrProvinceName and the localityName and\
    \ either the subject or\n      the organizationName is beyond the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes\n\
    \   named in this section.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Certificate Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Certificate Extensions\n   This section provides additional details regarding\
    \ the contents of\n   four certificate extensions defined in RFC 3280: Subject\
    \ Alternative\n   Name, Subject directory attributes, Certificate policies, and\
    \ Key\n   usage.  This section also defines two additional extensions:\n   biometric\
    \ information and qualified certificate statements.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Subject Alternative Name
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Subject Alternative Name\n   If the subjectAltName extension is present,\
    \ and it contains a\n   directoryName name, then the directoryName MUST follow\
    \ the\n   conventions specified in section 3.1.2 of this profile.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Subject Directory Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Subject Directory Attributes\n   The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension\
    \ MAY be present and MAY\n   contain additional attributes associated with the\
    \ subject, as a\n   complement to present information in the subject field and\
    \ the\n   subject alternative name extension.\n   Attributes suitable for storage\
    \ in this extension are attributes\n   which are not part of the subject's distinguished\
    \ name, but which MAY\n   still be useful for other purposes (e.g., authorization).\n\
    \   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.\n   Compliant implementations\
    \ SHALL be able to interpret the following\n   attributes:\n      dateOfBirth;\n\
    \      placeOfBirth;\n      gender;\n      countryOfCitizenship; and\n      countryOfResidence.\n\
    \   Other attributes MAY be included according to local definitions.\n      The\
    \ dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value\n      of the date\

    \ 12.00.00 (noon) down\n      to the granularity of seconds, in order to prevent\
    \ accidental\n      change of date due to time zone adjustments.  For example,\
    \ a birth\n      date of September 27, 1959 is encoded as \"19590927120000Z\"\
    .\n      Compliant certificate parsing applications SHOULD ignore any time\n \
    \     data and just present the contained date without any time zone\n      adjustments.\n\
    \      The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value\n   \

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The legal value of a digital signature that is\
    \ validated with a\n   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the\
    \ policy\n   governing the use of the associated private key.  Both the private\n\
    \   key holder, as well as the relying party, should make sure that the\n   private\
    \ key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key\n   holder.\n   Since\
    \ the public keys are for public use with legal implications for\n   involved\
    \ parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issue\n   certificates as\
    \ Qualified Certificates.  The associated private keys\n   must be unique for\
    \ the subject, and must be maintained under the\n   subject's sole control.  That\
    \ is, a CA should not issue a qualified\n   certificate if the means to use the\
    \ private key is not protected\n   against unintended usage.  This implies that\
    \ the CA has some\n   knowledge about the subject's cryptographic module.\n  \
    \ The CA must further verify that the public key contained in the\n   certificate\
    \ is legitimately representing the subject.\n   CAs should not issue CA certificates\
    \ with policy mapping extensions\n   indicating acceptance of another CA's policy\
    \ unless these conditions\n   are met.\n   Combining the nonRepudiation bit in\
    \ the keyUsage certificate\n   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security\
    \ implications\n   depending on the context in which the certificate is to be\
    \ used.\n   Applications validating electronic signatures based on such\n   certificates\
    \ should determine whether the present key usage\n   combination is appropriate\
    \ for their use.\n   The ability to compare two qualified certificates to determine\
    \ if\n   they represent the same physical entity is dependent on the semantics\n\
    \   of the subjects' names.  The semantics of a particular attribute may\n   be\
    \ different for different issuers.  Comparing names without\n   knowledge of the\
    \ semantics of names in these particular certificates\n   may provide misleading\
    \ results.\n   This specification is a profile of RFC 3280.  The security\n  \
    \ considerations section of that document applies to this specification\n   as\
    \ well.\n"

    \ dump, and the\n   DER-encoding of a certificate issued in conformance with this\n\
    \   profile.  The example has been developed with the help of the OSS\n   ASN.1\
    \ compiler.  The certificate has the following characteristics:\n      1.  The\
    \ certificate is signed with RSA and the SHA-1 hash\n          algorithm\n   \
    \   2.  The issuer's distinguished name is (using the syntax specified\n     \
    \     in [RFC 2253]):  O=GMD - Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik\n       \
    \   GmbH, C=DE\n      3.  The subject's distinguished name is (using the syntax\n\
    \          specified in [RFC 2253]): GN=Petra+SN=Barzin, O=GMD\n          - Forschungszentrum\
    \ Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE\n      4.  The certificate was issued on 1 February,\
    \ 2004 and will expire\n          on 1 February, 2008\n      5.  The certificate\
    \ contains a 1024 bit RSA key\n      6.  The certificate includes a critical key\
    \ usage extension\n          exclusively indicating non-repudiation\n      7.\
    \  The certificate includes a certificate policy identifier\n          extension\
    \ indicating the practices and procedures undertaken\n          by the issuing\
    \ CA (object identifier 1.3.36.8.1.1).  The\n          certificate policy object\
    \ identifier is defined by TeleTrust,\n          Germany.\n      8.  The certificate\
    \ includes a subject directory attributes\n          extension containing the\
    \ following attributes:\n              date of birth:         October, 14th 1971\n\
    \              place of birth:        Darmstadt\n              country of citizenship:Germany\n\
    \              gender:                Female\n      9.  The certificate includes\
    \ a qualified statement certificate\n          extension indicating that the naming\
    \ registration authority's\n          name is \"municipality@darmstadt.de\".\n\
    \      10. The certificate includes, in conformance with RFC 3280, an\n      \
    \    authority key identifier extension.\n"
