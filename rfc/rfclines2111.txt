Abstract The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, "cid:" and "mid:" allow references to messages and the body parts of messages.
For example, within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include embedded references to other parts of the same message.
The use of [MIME] within email to convey Web pages and their associated images requires a URL scheme to permit the HTML to refer to the images or other data included in the message.
The Content ID Uniform Resource Locator, "cid:", serves that purpose.
Similarly Net News readers use Message IDs to link related messages together.
The Message ID URL provides a scheme, "mid:", to refer to such messages as a "resource".
The "mid" (Message ID) and "cid" (Content ID)
URL schemes provide identifiers for messages and their body parts.
The "mid" scheme uses (a part of)
the message id of an email message to refer to a specific message.
The "cid" scheme refers to a specific body part of a message; its use is generally limited to references to other body parts in the same message as the referring body part.
The "mid" scheme may also refer to a specific body part within a designated message, by including the content ID's address.
The terms "body part" and "MIME entity" are used interchangeably.
They refer to the headers and body of a MIME message, either the message itself or one of the body parts contained in a Multipart message.
The MID and CID URL Schemes RFC1738 [URL] reserves the "mid" and "cid" schemes for Message ID and Content ID respectively.
This memorandum defines the syntax for those URLs.
Because they use the same syntactic elements they are presented together.
A "mid" URL with only a "message id" refers to an entire message.
With the appended "content id", it refers to a body part within a message, as does a "cid" URL.
The Content ID of a MIME body part is required to be globally unique.
However, in many systems that store messages, body parts are not indexed independently their context (message).
The "mid" URL long form was designed to supply the context needed to support interoperability with such systems.
A implementation conforming to this specification is required to support the "mid" URL long form (message id/content id).
Conforming implementations can choose to, but are not required to, take advantage of the content id's uniqueness and interpret a "cid" URL to refer to any body part within the message store.
In limited circumstances (e.g., within multipart/alternate), a single message may contain several body parts that have the same Content ID.
That occurs, for example, when identical data can be accessed through different methods [MIME, sect.
In those cases, conforming implementations are required to use the rules of the containing MIME entity (e.g., multi part/alternate) to select the body part to which the Content ID refers.
For example, "mid:foo4%25foo1@bar.net" corresponds to Message ID: <foo4%foo1@bar.net
A "mid" URL is converted to a Message ID or Message ID/Content ID pair in a similar fashion.
Both message id and content
id are required to be globally unique.
That is, no two different messages will ever have the same Message ID addr spec; no different body parts will ever have the same Content ID addr spec.
A common technique used by many message systems is to use a time and date stamp along with the local host's domain name, e.g., 950124.162336@XIson.com.
Some Examples The following message contains an HTML body part that refers to an image contained in another body part.
Both body parts are contained in a Multipart/Related MIME entity.
The HTML IMG tag contains a cidurl which points to the image.
A simple example Mime Version: 1.0 Content Type: multipart/related; boundary "boundary example 1"; type Text/HTML
Text/HTML; charset US ASCII ...
text of the HTML document, which might contain a hyperlink to the other body part, for example through a statement such as: <IMG SRC "cid:
foo4 foo1@bar.net" ALT "IETF logo">
boundary example 1 Content ID:
foo4 foo1@bar.net Content Type: IMAGE/
The following message points to another message (hopefully still in the recipient's message store).
Here's how to do it Content type:
The URLs defined here provide an addressing or referencing mechanism.
The values of these URLs disclose no more about the originators environment than the corresponding Message ID and Content ID values.
Where concern exists about such disclosures the originator of a message using mid and cid URLs must take precautions to insure that confidential information is not disclosed.
Those precautions should already be in place to handle existing mail use of the Message ID and Content ID.
