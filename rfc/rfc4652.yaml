- title: '4.  Requirements: Overview'
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements: Overview\n   The following functionality is expected from GMPLS\
    \ routing protocols\n   to instantiate the ASON hierarchical routing architecture\
    \ realization\n   (see [G.7715] and [G.7715.1]):\n   - Routing Areas (RAs) shall\
    \ be uniquely identifiable within a\n     carrier's network, each having a unique\
    \ RA Identifier (RA ID)\n     within the carrier's network.\n   - Within a RA\
    \ (one level), the routing protocol shall support\n     dissemination of hierarchical\
    \ routing information (including\n     summarized routing information for other\
    \ levels) in support of an\n     architecture of multiple hierarchical levels\
    \ of RAs; the number of\n     hierarchical RA levels to be supported by a routing\
    \ protocol is\n     implementation specific.\n   - The routing protocol shall\
    \ support routing information based on a\n     common set of information elements\
    \ as defined in [G.7715] and\n     [G.7715.1], divided between attributes pertaining\
    \ to links and\n     abstract nodes (each representing either a sub-network or\
    \ simply a\n     node).  [G.7715] recognizes that the manner in which the routing\n\
    \     information is represented and exchanged will vary with the routing\n  \
    \   protocol used.\n   - The routing protocol shall converge such that the distributed\n\
    \     Routing DataBases (RDB) become synchronized after a period of time.\n  \
    \ To support dissemination of hierarchical routing information, the\n   routing\
    \ protocol must deliver:\n   - Processing of routing information exchanged between\
    \ adjacent levels\n     of the hierarchy (i.e., Level N+1 and N), including reachability\n\
    \     and (upon policy decision) summarized topology information.\n   - Self-consistent\
    \ information at the receiving level resulting from\n     any transformation (filter,\
    \ summarize, etc.) and forwarding of\n     information from one Routing Controller\
    \ (RC) to RC(s) at different\n     levels when multiple RCs are bound to a single\
    \ RA.\n   - A mechanism to prevent re-introduction of information propagated\n\
    \     into the Level N RA's RC back to the adjacent level RA's RC from\n     which\
    \ this information has been initially received.\n   Note: The number of hierarchical\
    \ levels to be supported is routing\n   protocol specific and reflects a containment\
    \ relationship.\n   Reachability information may be advertised either as a set\
    \ of UNI\n   Transport Resource address prefixes, or as a set of associated\n\
    \   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP) link IDs/SNPP link ID prefixes, assigned\n  \
    \ and selected consistently in their applicability scope.  The formats\n   of\
    \ the control plane identifiers in a protocol realization are\n   implementation\
    \ specific.  Use of a routing protocol within a RA\n   should not restrict the\
    \ choice of routing protocols for use in other\n   RAs (child or parent).\n  \
    \ As ASON does not restrict the control plane architecture choice,\n   either\
    \ a co-located architecture or a physically separated\n   architecture may be\
    \ used.  A collection of links and nodes, such as a\n   sub-network or RA, must\
    \ be able to represent itself to the wider\n   network as a single logical entity\
    \ with only its external links\n   visible to the topology database.\n"
- title: 5.  Evaluation
  contents:
  - "5.  Evaluation\n   This section evaluates support of existing IETF routing protocols\n\
    \   with respect to the requirements summarized from [RFC4258] in Section\n  \
    \ 4.  Candidate routing protocols are Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)\n   (OSPF\
    \ and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)) and\n   BGP.  The latter\
    \ is not addressed in the current version of this\n   document.  BGP is not considered\
    \ a candidate protocol mainly because\n   of the following reasons:\n   - Non-support\
    \ of TE information exchange.  Each BGP router advertises\n     only its path\
    \ to each destination in its vector for loop avoidance,\n     with no costs or\
    \ hop counts; each BGP router knows little about\n     network topology.\n   -\
    \ BGP can only advertise routes that are eligible for use (local RIB)\n     or\
    \ routing loops can occur; there is one best route per prefix, and\n     that\
    \ is the route that is advertised.\n   - BGP is not widely deployed in optical\
    \ equipment and networks.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Terminology and Identification
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Terminology and Identification\n   - Pi is a physical (bearer/data/transport\
    \ plane) node.\n   - Li is a logical control plane entity that is associated to\
    \ a single\n     data plane (abstract) node.  The Li is identified by the TE\n\
    \     Router_ID.  The latter is a control plane identifier defined as\n     follows:\n\
    \        [RFC3630]: Router_Address (top level) TLV of the Type 1 TE LSA\n    \
    \    [RFC3784]: Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV (Type 134)\n     Note: This\
    \ document does not define what the TE Router ID is.  This\n     document simply\
    \ states the use of the TE Router ID to identify Li.\n     [RFC3630] and [RFC3784]\
    \ provide the definitions.\n   - Ri is a logical control plane entity that is\
    \ associated to a\n     control plane \"router\".  The latter is the source for\
    \ topology\n     information that it generates and shares with other control plane\n\
    \     \"routers\".  The Ri is identified by the (advertising) Router_ID\n    \
    \    [RFC2328]: Router ID (32-bit)\n        [RFC1195]: IS-IS System ID (48-bit)\n\
    \     The Router_ID, which is represented by Ri and which corresponds to\n   \
    \  the RC_ID [RFC4258], does not enter into the identification of the\n     logical\
    \ entities representing the data plane resources such as\n     links.  The Routing\
    \ DataBase (RDB) is associated to the Ri.  Note\n     that, in the ASON context,\
    \ an arrangement consisting of multiple\n     Ris announcing routing information\
    \ related to a single Li is under\n     evaluation.\n   Aside from the Li/Pi mappings,\
    \ these identifiers are not assumed to\n   be in a particular entity relationship\
    \ except that the Ri may have\n   multiple Lis in its scope.  The relationship\
    \ between Ri and Li is\n   simple at any moment in time: an Li may be advertised\
    \ by only one Ri\n   at any time.  However, an Ri may advertise a set of one or\
    \ more Lis.\n   Thus, the routing protocol MUST be able to advertise multiple\
    \ TE\n   Router IDs (see Section 5.7).\n   Note: Si is a control plane signaling\
    \ function associated with one or\n   more Lis.  This document does not assume\
    \ any specific constraint on\n   the relationship between Si and Li.  This document\
    \ does not discuss\n   issues of control plane accessibility for the signaling\
    \ function, and\n   it makes no assumptions about how control plane accessibility\
    \ to the\n   Si is achieved.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  RA Identification\n   G.7715.1 notes some necessary characteristics for\
    \ RA identifiers,\n   e.g., that they may provide scope for the Ri, and that they\

    \ ID\n   format itself is allowed to be derived from any global address space.\n\
    \   Provisioning of RA IDs for uniqueness is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n\
    \   Under these conditions, GMPLS link state routing protocols provide\n   the\
    \ capability for RA Identification without further modification.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Routing Information Exchange
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Routing Information Exchange\n   In this section, the focus is on routing\
    \ information exchange Ri\n   entities (through routing adjacencies) within a\
    \ single hierarchical\n   level.  Routing information mapping between levels require\
    \ specific\n   processing (see Section 5.5).\n   The control plane does not transport\
    \ Pi identifiers, as these are\n   data plane addresses for which the Li/Pi mapping\
    \ is kept (link)\n   local; see, for instance the transport LMP document [RFC4394]\
    \ where\n   such an exchange is described.  Example: The transport plane\n   identifier\
    \ is the Pi (the identifier assigned to the physical\n   element) that could be,\
    \ for instance, \"666B.F999.AF10.222C\", whereas\n   the control plane identifier\
    \ is the Li (the identifier assigned by\n   the control plane), which could be,\
    \ for instance, \"192.0.2.1\".\n   The control plane exchanges the control plane\
    \ identifier information,\n   but not the transport plane identifier information\
    \ (i.e., not\n   \"666B.F999.AF10.222C\", but only \"192.0.2.1\").  The mapping\
    \ Li/Pi is\n   kept local.  So, when the Si receives a control plane message\n\
    \   requesting the use of \"192.0.2.1\", Si knows locally that this\n   information\
    \ refers to the data plane entity identified by the\n   transport plane identifier\
    \ \"666B.F999.AF10.222C\".\n   Note also that the Li and Pi addressing spaces\
    \ may be identical.\n   The control plane carries:\n   1) its view of the data\
    \ plane link end-points and other link\n      connection end-points.\n   2) the\
    \ identifiers scoped by the Lis, i.e., referred to as an\n      associated IPv4/IPv6\
    \ addressing space.  Note that these\n      identifiers may be either bundled\
    \ TE link addresses or component\n      link addresses.\n   3) when using OSPF\
    \ or ISIS as the IGP in support of traffic\n      engineering, [RFC3477] RECOMMENDS\
    \ that the Li value (referred to\n      the \"LSR Router ID\") be set to the TE\
    \ Router ID value.\n   Therefore, OSPF and IS-IS carry sufficient node identification\n\
    \   information without further modification.\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  Link Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Link Attributes\n   [RFC4258] provides a list of link attributes and\
    \ characteristics that\n   need to be advertised by a routing protocol.  All TE\
    \ link attributes\n   and characteristics are currently handled by OSPF and IS-IS\
    \ (see\n   Table 1) with the exception of Local Adaptation support.  Indeed,\n\
    \   GMPLS routing does not currently consider the use of dedicated TE\n   link\
    \ attribute(s) to describe the cross/inter-layer relationships.\n   In addition,\
    \ the representation of bandwidth requires further\n   consideration.  GMPLS Routing\
    \ defines an Interface Switching\n   Capability Descriptor (ISCD) that delivers\
    \ information about the\n   (maximum/ minimum) bandwidth per priority of which\
    \ an LSP can make\n   use.  This information is usually used in combination with\
    \ the\n   Unreserved Bandwidth sub-TLV that provides the amount of bandwidth\n\
    \   not yet reserved on a TE link.\n   In the ASON context, other bandwidth accounting\
    \ representations are\n   possible, e.g., in terms of a set of tuples <signal_type;\
    \ number of\n   unallocated timeslots>.  The latter representation may also require\n\
    \   definition of additional signal types (from those defined in\n   [RFC3946])\
    \ to represent support of contiguously concatenated signals,\n   i.e., STS-(3xN)c\
    \ SPE / VC-4-Nc, N = 4, 16, 64, 256.\n   However, the method proposed in [RFC4202]\
    \ is the most straightforward\n   without requiring any bandwidth accounting change\
    \ from an LSR\n   perspective (in particular, when the ISCD sub-TLV information\
    \ is\n   combined with the information provided by the Unreserved Bandwidth\n\

    \   hierarchical levels of RAs beyond the ability to support abstraction\n   as\
    \ discussed above.  However, if RCs bound to adjacent levels of the\n   RA hierarchy\
    \ are allowed to redistribute routing information in both\n   directions between\
    \ adjacent levels of the hierarchy without any\n   additional mechanisms, they\
    \ would not be able to determine looping of\n   routing information.\n   To prevent\
    \ this looping of routing information between levels, IS-IS\n   [RFC1195] allows\
    \ only advertising routing information upward in the\n   level hierarchy and disallows\
    \ the advertising of routing information\n   downward in the hierarchy.  [RFC2966]\
    \ defines the up/down bit to\n   allow advertising downward in the hierarchy the\
    \ \"IP Internal\n   Reachability Information\" TLV (Type 128) and \"IP External\n\

    \ level, the up/down bit is\n   set to 1, indicating that it has traveled down\
    \ the hierarchy.\n   Routing information that has the up/down bit set to 1 may\
    \ only be\n   advertised down the hierarchy, i.e., to lower levels.  This mechanism\n\
    \   applies independently of the number of levels.  However, this\n   mechanism\
    \ does not apply to the \"Extended IS Reachability\" TLV (Type\n   22) used to\
    \ propagate the summarized topology (see Section 5.3),\n   traffic engineering\

  - "5.6.  Routing Protocol Convergence\n   Link state protocols have been designed\
    \ to propagate detected\n   topological changes (such as interface failures and\
    \ link attributes\n   modification).  The convergence period is short and involves\
    \ a\n   minimum of routing information exchange.\n   Therefore, existing routing\
    \ protocol convergence involves mechanisms\n   that are sufficient for ASON applications.\n"
- title: 5.7.  Routing Information Scoping
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Routing Information Scoping\n   The routing protocol MUST support a single\
    \ Ri advertising on behalf\n   of more than one Li.  Since each Li is identified\
    \ by a unique TE\n   Router ID, the routing protocol MUST be able to advertise\
    \ multiple TE\n   Router IDs.  That is, for [RFC3630], multiple Router Addresses\
    \ and\n   for [RFC3784] multiple Traffic Engineering Router Ids.\n   The Link\
    \ sub-TLV that is currently part of the top level Link TLV\n   associates the\
    \ link to the Router_ID.  However, having the Ri\n   advertising on behalf of\
    \ multiple Lis creates the following issue, as\n   there is no longer a 1:1 relationship\
    \ between the Router_ID and the\n   TE Router_ID, but a 1:N relationship is possible\
    \ (see Section 5.1).\n   As the link-local and link-remote (unnumbered) ID association\
    \ may not\n   be unique per abstract node (per Li unicity), the advertisement\
    \ needs\n   to indicate the remote Lj value and rely on the initial discovery\n\
    \   process to retrieve the {Li;Lj} relationship(s).  In brief, as\n   unnumbered\
    \ links have their ID defined on per Li bases, the remote Lj\n   needs to be identified\
    \ to scope the link remote ID to the local Li.\n   Therefore, the routing protocol\
    \ MUST be able to disambiguate the\n   advertised TE links so that they can be\
    \ associated with the correct\n   TE Router ID.\n   Moreover, when the Ri advertises\
    \ on behalf multiple Lis, the routing\n   protocol MUST be able to disambiguate\
    \ the advertised reachability\n   information (see Section 5.3.3) so that it can\
    \ be associated with the\n   correct TE Router ID.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  ASON Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following terms:\n\
    \   Administrative domain (see Recommendation G.805): For the purposes of\n  \
    \ [G.7715.1], an administrative domain represents the extent of\n   resources\
    \ that belong to a single player such as a network operator,\n   a service provider,\
    \ or an end-user.  Administrative domains of\n   different players do not overlap\
    \ amongst themselves.\n   Control plane: Performs the call control and connection\
    \ control\n   functions.  Through signaling, the control plane sets up and releases\n\
    \   connections and may restore a connection in case of a failure.\n   (Control)\
    \ Domain: Represents a collection of (control) entities that\n   are grouped for\
    \ a particular purpose.  The control plane is\n   subdivided into domains matching\
    \ administrative domains.  Within an\n   administrative domain, further subdivisions\
    \ of the control plane are\n   recursively applied.  A routing control domain\
    \ is an abstract entity\n   that hides the details of the RC distribution.\n \
    \  External NNI (E-NNI): Interfaces are located between protocol\n   controllers\
    \ between control domains.\n   Internal NNI (I-NNI): Interfaces are located between\
    \ protocol\n   controllers within control domains.\n   Link (see Recommendation\
    \ G.805): A \"topological component\" that\n   describes a fixed relationship\
    \ between a \"subnetwork\" or \"access\n   group\" and another \"subnetwork\"\
    \ or \"access group\".  Links are not\n   limited to being provided by a single\
    \ server trail.\n   Management plane: Performs management functions for the Transport\n\
    \   Plane, the control plane, and the system as a whole.  It also\n   provides\
    \ coordination between all the planes.  The following\n   management functional\
    \ areas are performed in the management plane:\n   performance, fault, configuration,\
    \ accounting, and security\n   management\n   Management domain (see Recommendation\
    \ G.805): A management domain\n   defines a collection of managed objects that\
    \ are grouped to meet\n   organizational requirements according to geography,\
    \ technology,\n   policy, or other structure, and for a number of functional areas\
    \ such\n   as fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security\n  \
    \ (FCAPS), for the purpose of providing control in a consistent manner.\n   Management\
    \ domains can be disjoint, contained, or overlapping.  As\n   such, the resources\
    \ within an administrative domain can be\n   distributed into several possible\
    \ overlapping management domains.\n   The same resource can therefore belong to\
    \ several management domains\n   simultaneously, but a management domain shall\
    \ not cross the border of\n   an administrative domain.\n   Subnetwork Point (SNP):\
    \ The SNP is a control plane abstraction that\n   represents an actual or potential\
    \ transport plane resource.  SNPs (in\n   different subnetwork partitions) may\
    \ represent the same transport\n   resource.  A one-to-one correspondence should\
    \ not be assumed.\n   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set of SNPs that are grouped\
    \ together\n   for the purposes of routing.\n   Termination Connection Point (TCP):\
    \ A TCP represents the output of a\n   Trail Termination function or the input\
    \ to a Trail Termination Sink\n   function.\n   Transport plane: Provides bi-directional\
    \ or unidirectional transfer\n   of user information, from one location to another.\
    \  It can also\n   provide transfer of some control and network management information.\n\
    \   The Transport Plane is layered; it is equivalent to the Transport\n   Network\
    \ defined in G.805 Recommendation.\n   User Network Interface (UNI): Interfaces\
    \ are located between protocol\n   controllers between a user and a control domain.\
    \  Note: There is no\n   routing function associated with a UNI reference point.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  ASON Routing Terminology
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  ASON Routing Terminology\n   This document makes use of the following\
    \ terms:\n   Routing Area (RA): An RA represents a partition of the data plane,\n\
    \   and its identifier is used within the control plane as the\n   representation\
    \ of this partition.  Per [G.8080], an RA is defined by\n   a set of sub-networks,\
    \ the links that interconnect them, and the\n   interfaces representing the ends\
    \ of the links exiting that RA.  An RA\n   may contain smaller RAs inter-connected\
    \ by links.  The limit of\n   subdivision results in an RA that contains two sub-networks\n\
    \   interconnected by a single link.\n   Routing Database (RDB): Repository for\
    \ the local topology, network\n   topology, reachability, and other routing information\
    \ that is updated\n   as part of the routing information exchange and that may\
    \ additionally\n   contain information that is configured.  The RDB may contain\
    \ routing\n   information for more than one Routing Area (RA).\n   Routing Components:\
    \ ASON routing architecture functions.  These\n   functions can be classified\
    \ as being protocol independent (Link\n   Resource Manager or LRM, Routing Controller\
    \ or RC) and protocol\n   specific (Protocol Controller or PC).\n   Routing Controller\
    \ (RC): Handles (abstract) information needed for\n   routing and the routing\
    \ information exchange with peering RCs by\n   operating on the RDB.  The RC has\
    \ access to a view of the RDB.  The\n   RC is protocol independent.\n   Note:\
    \ Since the RDB may contain routing information pertaining to\n   multiple RAs\
    \ (and possibly to multiple layer networks), the RCs\n   accessing the RDB may\
    \ share the routing information.\n   Link Resource Manager (LRM): Supplies all\
    \ the relevant component and\n   TE link information to the RC.  It informs the\
    \ RC about any state\n   changes of the link resources it controls.\n   Protocol\
    \ Controller (PC): Handles protocol-specific message exchanges\n   according to\
    \ the reference point over which the information is\n   exchanged (e.g., E-NNI,\
    \ I-NNI) and internal exchanges with the RC.\n   The PC function is protocol dependent.\n"
