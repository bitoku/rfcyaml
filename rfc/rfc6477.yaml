- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages\n\
    \   ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across\n   national\
    \ and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS\n   Elements of\
    \ Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T\n   X.400 (1992) international\
    \ standards and are specified in STANAG 4406\n   Edition 2 and ACP 123.  This\
    \ document specifies message header fields\n   and associated processing for RFC\
    \ 5322 (Internet Message Format) to\n   provide a comparable messaging service.\
    \  In addition, this document\n   provides for a STANAG 4406 / Internet Email\
    \ Gateway that supports\n   message conversion.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5322] defines a protocol for the format of electronic\
    \ messages\n   exchanged on the Internet.  MMHS is a military specification defined\n\
    \   in ACP 123 [ACP123] (also specified in STANAG 4406 [STANAG-4406]),\n   which\
    \ defines a number of extensions to the basic X.400 (1992)\n   protocol for the\
    \ services required by military messaging.\n   This document supports translating\
    \ most of the Elements of Service\n   defined in ACP 123 [ACP123] to Internet\
    \ message header fields (see\n   Section 5 for more details).  This specification\
    \ is written to extend\n   the Mime Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay (MIXER) specification\n\
    \   [RFC2156] to enable inter-conversion in a MIXER gateway with the\n   X.400\
    \ Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS) heading extensions\n   defined in ACP\
    \ 123 / STANAG 4406, Annex A.\n   The document is aimed at the ability to represent\
    \ MMHS messages as\n   RFC 5322 messages.  All RFC 5322 header fields defined\
    \ in this\n   document are prefixed with the string \"MMHS-\" to distinguish them\n\
    \   from any other header fields.\n   Unless stated otherwise, all header fields\
    \ described in this document\n   are OPTIONAL in an Internet Message.\n   This\
    \ document is structured as follows: Section 3 and its subsections\n   formally\
    \ define new Internet header fields and show some examples.\n   Section 4 provides\
    \ Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) syntax for them.\n   Section 5 provides some\
    \ background information about which features\n   of ACP 123 / STANAG 4406 were\
    \ not implemented in this specification.\n   Subsequent sections talk about additional\
    \ requirements for gatewaying\n   to/from ACP 123 / STANAG 4406 and ACP 127 [ACP127]\
    \ environments,\n   respectively.\n"

  - "6.  Gatewaying with ACP 123 / STANAG 4406\n   The header fields defined in this\
    \ specification are designed to be\n   mapped with ACP 123 Annex A1 heading extensions\
    \ as part of a MIXER\n   mapping according to [RFC2156].  The syntax of these\
    \ headings is\n   defined such that mapping is mechanical.  OR Names SHOULD be\
    \ mapped\n   with Internet Email addresses according to [RFC2156].\n   This section\
    \ summarizes how a gateway between [ACP123] and [RFC5322]\n   conformant to this\
    \ specification operates.\n   If an incoming X.400 message is encoded as P772,\
    \ [RFC5322] header\n   fields MUST be generated according to this specification\
    \ for all ACP\n   123 heading extensions where an equivalent header is defined\
    \ in this\n   specification.  For the three heading extensions where no mapping\
    \ is\n   defined, the heading extension MAY be discarded or mapped in a\n   proprietary\
    \ manner.  If a Distribution Extension is encoded, this MAY\n   be discarded or\
    \ represented as a comment (<CFWS>).  The whole message\n   MAY be signed according\
    \ to [RFC5652].  These rules also apply to\n   heading extensions in forwarded\
    \ messages.  MM-Message MUST be treated\n   as a forwarded message for the purposes\
    \ of MIXER mapping.  If an ACP\n   127 Notification Request is present, this MAY\
    \ be discarded or\n   represented as a comment (<CFWS>).\n   Incoming X.400 notifications\
    \ are encoded according to [RFC2156].  If\n   an ACP 127 Notification Response\
    \ is present, this MAY be discarded or\n   mapped in a proprietary manner.\n \
    \  If an incoming SMTP message contains any of the header fields defined\n   in\
    \ this specification, the outgoing X.400 message MUST be encoded as\n   P772.\
    \  The outgoing message MAY be encoded as P772 for other reasons,\n   for instance,\
    \ policy or characteristics such as the message\n   containing a military body\
    \ part.  The X.400 message might be signed\n   according to ACP 123 Annex B [ACP123]\
    \ or STANAG 4406 Annex G\n   [STANAG-4406].  message/rfc822 body parts included\
    \ in the message\n   SHOULD be mapped to MM-Message and the heading mapping rules\
    \ applied.\n   Generated P772 messages SHOULD follow the following rules, generating\n\
    \   heading extensions if needed.\n   a.  Extended Authorization is required.\
    \  If the MMHS-Extended-\n       Authorization-Info header field is absent, then\
    \ the default value\n       is taken from the Date header field.\n   b.  Primary\
    \ Precedence is required if the To header field is present.\n       If the MMHS-Primary-Precedence\
    \ header field is absent, the\n       message need not be considered a Military\
    \ Message and can be\n       handled according to a local policy.\n   c.  Copy\
    \ Precedence is required if the Cc header field is present and\n       there is\
    \ an MMHS-Copy-Precedence header field that is different\n       from the MMHS-Primary-Precedence\
    \ header field.\n   d.  For Message-ID fields, ACP 123 applies additional constraints\n\
    \       over X.400, leading to the following rules in addition to\n       [RFC2156],\
    \ which SHOULD be followed by a gateway following this\n       specification.\n\
    \       1.  The local identifier MUST be at least 15 characters long.  If\n  \
    \         the [RFC2156] generated value is shorter than this, then it\n      \
    \     is padded with spaces to 15 characters.  This value will\n           correctly\
    \ reverse map.\n       2.  The OR Address part is required, and it is not usually\n\
    \           generated by an [RFC2156] mapping.  It is mandatory in ACP\n     \
    \      123.  The gateway SHOULD generate an OR Address in a manner\n         \
    \  that can be reverse mapped.  It MAY use the OR Address to\n           encode\
    \ long message ids that cannot be encoded in the local\n           identifier.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Annex B of [ACP123] describes how MMHS messages\
    \ can be protected in\n   an X.400 environment.  Similar protection can be provided\
    \ using\n   S/MIME [RFC5751] and/or DKIM [RFC6376].  In particular, DKIM can be\n\
    \   used to protect against alteration, deletion, or insertion of header\n   fields\
    \ specified in this document that can affect disposition and\n   quality of service\
    \ applied to processing of the protected Internet\n   message by receiving gateways/endpoints\
    \ that support this\n   specification.  (Note that most of the header fields defined\
    \ in this\n   document might affect processing of the message by the receiving\n\
    \   gateway/end system, MMHS-Subject-Indicator-Codes and MMHS-Primary-\n   Precedence/MMHS-Copy-Precedence\
    \ header fields being the most\n   important examples.  For example, alteration\
    \ of the MMHS-Primary-\n   Precedence header field value might affect processing\
    \ speed of the\n   message by the recipient Message Transfer Agent (MTA).)\n \
    \  When the original message header fields are digitally signed, the act\n   of\
    \ gatewaying messages with such header fields to/from an Internet\n   environment\
    \ from/to an ACP 123 environment breaks digital signatures.\n   The gateway can\
    \ sign the translated message itself (e.g., with DKIM),\n   but a message recipient\
    \ would be unable to verify that the message\n   was generated by the original\
    \ sender.\n"
