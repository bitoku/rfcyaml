- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is intended to describe how to transport telephony\n\
    \   signalling protocols, used in classic telephony systems, over IP\n   networks.\
    \  As described in [RFC2719], the whole architecture is\n   called SIGTRAN (Signalling\
    \ Transport) and is composed of a transport\n   protocol (SCTP) and several User\
    \ Adaptation Layers (UALs).  The\n   transport protocol SCTP has been developed\
    \ to fulfill the stringent\n   requirements of telephony signalling networks [RFC3257].\
    \  The set of\n   UALs has also been introduced to make it possible for different\n\
    \   signalling protocols to use the SCTP layer.\n"

    \          Figure 1: Telephony SIGnalling TRANsport Protocol Stack\n   The components\
    \ of the protocol stack are:\n   1.  Adaptation layers used when the telephony\
    \ application needs to\n       preserve an existing primitive interface (e.g.,\
    \ management\n       indications or data operation primitives for a particular\n\
    \       user/application protocol).\n   2.  SCTP, specially configured to meet\
    \ the telephony application\n       performance requirements.\n   3.  The standard\
    \ Internet Protocol.\n   The telephony signalling protocols to be transported\
    \ can be:\n   o  [RFC3332] SS7 MTP3 users: SCCP, ISUP, TUP...\n   o  [RFC3331]\
    \ SS7 MTP2 users: MTP3\n   o  [RFC3868] SS7 SCCP users: RANAP, MAP(+TCAP), INAP(+TCAP)...\n\
    \   o  [RFC3057] ISDN Q.921 users: Q.931\n   o  [RFC3807] V5.2 / DSS1\n   o  ....\n\
    \   The user adaptation layers (UALs) are a set of protocols that\n   encapsulate\
    \ a specific signalling protocol to be transported over\n   SCTP.  The adaption\
    \ is done in a way that the upper signalling\n   protocols, which are relayed,\
    \ remain unaware that the lower layers\n   are different from the original lower\
    \ telephony signalling layers.\n   In that sense, the upper interface of the user\
    \ adaptation layers\n   needs to be the same as the upper layer interface is to\
    \ its original\n   lower layer.  If a MTP user is being relayed over the IP network,\
    \ the\n   related UAL used to transport the MTP user will have the same upper\n\
    \   interface as MTP has.\n   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol was designed\
    \ to fulfill the\n   stringent transport requirements that classical signalling\
    \ protocols\n   have and is therefore the recommended transport protocol to use\
    \ for\n   this purpose.\n   SCTP provides the following functions:\n   o  Reliable\
    \ Data Transfer\n   o  Multiple streams to help avoid head-of-line blocking\n\
    \   o  Ordered and unordered data delivery on a per-stream basis\n   o  Bundling\
    \ and fragmentation of user data\n   o  Congestion and flow control\n   o  Support\
    \ for continuous monitoring of reachability\n   o  Graceful termination of association\n\
    \   o  Support of multi-homing for added reliability\n   o  Protection against\
    \ blind denial-of-service attacks\n   o  Protection against blind masquerade attacks\n\
    \   SCTP is used as the transport protocol for telephony signalling\n   applications.\
    \  Message boundaries are preserved during data transport\n   by SCTP, so each\
    \ UAL can specify its own message structure within the\n   SCTP user data.  The\
    \ SCTP user data can be delivered by the order of\n   transmission within a stream\
    \ (in sequence delivery) or unordered.\n   SCTP can be used to provide redundancy\
    \ at the transport layer and\n   below.  Telephony applications needing this level\
    \ of redundancy can\n   make use of SCTP's multi-homing support.\n   SCTP can\
    \ be used for telephony applications where head-of-line\n   blocking is a concern.\
    \  Such an application should use multiple\n   streams to provide independent\
    \ ordering of telephony signalling\n   messages.\n"
- title: 3.  Issues for Transporting Telephony Signalling over SCTP
  contents:
  - "3.  Issues for Transporting Telephony Signalling over SCTP\n   Transport of telephony\
    \ signalling requires special considerations.\n   In order to use SCTP, an implementation\
    \ must take special care to\n   meet the performance, timing, and failure management\
    \ requirements.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Congestion Control\n   The basic mechanism of congestion control in SCTP\
    \ has been described\n   in [RFC2960].  SCTP congestion control sometimes conflicts\
    \ with the\n   timing requirements of telephony signalling application messages\n\
    \   which are transported by SCTP.  During congestion, messages may be\n   delayed\
    \ by SCTP, thus sometimes violating the timing requirements of\n   those telephony\
    \ applications.\n   In an engineered network (e.g., a private intranet), in which\
    \ network\n   capacity and maximum traffic are very well controlled, some telephony\n\
    \   signalling applications may choose to relax the congestion control\n   rules\
    \ of SCTP in order to satisfy the timing requirements.  In order\n   to do this,\
    \ they should employ their own congestion control\n   mechanisms.  This must be\
    \ done without destabilizing the network;\n   otherwise, it would lead to potential\
    \ congestion collapse of the\n   network.\n   Some telephony signalling applications\
    \ may have their own congestion\n   control and flow control techniques.  These\
    \ techniques may interact\n   with the congestion control procedures in SCTP.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Detection of Failures
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Detection of Failures\n   Often, telephony systems must have no single\
    \ point of failure in\n   operation.\n   The UAL must meet certain service availability\
    \ and performance\n   requirements according to the classical signalling layers\
    \ they are\n   replacing.  Those requirements may be specific for each UAL.\n\
    \   For example, telephony systems are often required to be able to\n   preserve\
    \ stable calls during a component failure.  Therefore, error\n   situations at\
    \ the transport layer and below must be detected quickly\n   so that the UAL can\
    \ take appropriate steps to recover and preserve\n   the calls.  This poses special\
    \ requirements on SCTP to discover\n   unreachability of a destination address\
    \ or a peer.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) Calculation
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Retransmission TimeOut (RTO) Calculation\n   The SCTP protocol parameter\
    \ RTO.Min value has a direct impact on the\n   calculation of the RTO itself.\
    \  Some telephony applications want to\n   lower the value of the RTO.Min to less\
    \ than 1 second.  This would\n   allow the message sender to reach the maximum\n\
    \   number-of-retransmission threshold faster in the case of network\n   failures.\
    \  However, lowering RTO.Min may have a negative impact on\n   network behaviour\
    \ [ALLMAN99].\n   In some rare cases, telephony applications might not want to\
    \ use the\n   exponential timer back-off concept in RTO calculation in order to\n\
    \   speed up failure detection.  The danger of doing this is that, when\n   network\
    \ congestion occurs, not backing off the timer may worsen the\n   congestion situation.\
    \  Therefore, this strategy should never be used\n   on the public Internet.\n\
    \   It should be noted that not using delayed SACK will also increase the\n  \
    \ speed of failure detection.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Heartbeat
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Heartbeat\n   For faster detection of (un)availability of idle paths,\
    \ the telephony\n   application may consider lowering the SCTP parameter HB.interval.\
    \  It\n   should be noted this might result in a higher traffic load.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Maximum Number of Retransmissions
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Maximum Number of Retransmissions\n   Setting Path.Max.Retrans and Association.Max.Retrans\
    \ SCTP parameters\n   to lower values will speed up both destination address and\
    \ peer\n   failure detection.  However, if these values are set too low, the\n\
    \   probability of false fault detections might increase.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Shorten End-to-End Message Delay
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Shorten End-to-End Message Delay\n   Telephony applications often require\
    \ short end-to-end message delays.\n   The method described in Section 3.2.1 for\
    \ lowering RTO may be\n   considered.  The different paths within a single association\
    \ will\n   have a different RTO, so using the path with the lowest RTO will lead\n\
    \   to a shorter end-to-end message delay for the application running on\n   top\
    \ of the UALs.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Bundling Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Bundling Considerations\n   Bundling small telephony signalling messages\
    \ at transmission helps\n   improve the bandwidth usage efficiency of the network.\
    \  On the\n   downside, bundling may introduce additional delay to some of the\n\
    \   messages.  This should be taken into consideration when end-to-end\n   delay\
    \ is a concern.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Stream Usage
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Stream Usage\n   Telephony signalling traffic is often composed of multiple,\n\
    \   independent message sequences.  It is highly desirable to transfer\n   those\
    \ independent message sequences in separate SCTP streams.  This\n   reduces the\
    \ probability of head-of-line blocking in which the\n   retransmission of a lost\
    \ message affects the delivery of other\n   messages not belonging to the same\
    \ message sequence.\n"
- title: 4.  User Adaptation Layers
  contents:
  - "4.  User Adaptation Layers\n   Users Adaptation Layers (UALs) are defined to\
    \ encapsulate different\n   signalling protocols for transport over SCTP/IP.\n\
    \   There are UALs for both access signalling (DSS1) and trunk signalling\n  \
    \ (SS7).  A brief description of the standardized UALs follows in the\n   next\
    \ sub-sections.\n   The delivery mechanism in several UALs supports:\n   o  Seamless\
    \ operation of UALs user peers over an IP network\n      connection.\n   o  The\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   UALs are designated to carry signalling messages\
    \ for telephony\n   services.  As such, UALs must involve the security needs of\
    \ several\n   parties: the end users of the services, the network providers, and\n\
    \   the applications involved.  Additional requirements may come from\n   local\
    \ regulation.  Although some security needs overlap, any security\n   solution\
    \ should fulfill all the different parties' needs.  See\n   specific Security\
    \ Considerations in each UAL Technical specification\n   for details (for general\
    \ security principles of SIGTRAN, see\n   [RFC3788]).\n   SCTP only tries to increase\
    \ the availability of a network.  SCTP does\n   not contain any protocol mechanisms\
    \ directly related to communication\n   security, i.e., user message authentication,\
    \ integrity, or\n   confidentiality functions.  For such features, SCTP depends\
    \ on\n   security protocols.  In the field of system security, SCTP includes\n\
    \   mechanisms for reducing the risk of blind denial-of-service attacks\n   as\
    \ described in Section 11 of [RFC2960].\n   This document does not add any new\
    \ components to the protocols\n   included in the discussion.  For secure use\
    \ of the SIGTRAN protocols,\n   readers should go through the \"Security Considerations\
    \ for SIGTRAN\n   Protocols\" [RFC3788]).  According to that document, the use\
    \ of the\n   IPsec is the main requirement to secure SIGTRAN protocols in the\n\
    \   Internet, but Transport Layer Security (TLS) is also considered a\n   perfectly\
    \ valid option for use in certain scenarios (see [RFC3436]\n   for more information\
    \ on using TLS with SCTP).  Recommendations of\n   usage are also included.\n"
