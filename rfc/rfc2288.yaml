- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The ongoing work of several IETF working groups, most recently\
    \ in the\n   Uniform Resource Names working group, has culminated the development\n\
    \   of a syntax for Uniform Resource Names (URNs).   The functional\n   requirements\
    \ and overall framework for Uniform Resource Names are\n   specified in RFC 1737\
    \ [Sollins & Masinter] and the specification for\n   the URN syntax is RFC 2141\
    \ [Moats].\n   As part of the validation process for the development of URNs the\n\
    \   IETF working group has agreed that it is important to demonstrate\n   that\
    \ the current URN syntax proposal can accommodate existing\n   identifiers from\
    \ well established namespaces.  One such\n   infrastructure for assigning and\
    \ managing names comes from the\n   bibliographic community.  Bibliographic identifiers\
    \ function as names\n   for objects that exist both in print and, increasingly,\
    \ in electronic\n   formats.  This memo demonstrates the feasibility of supporting\
    \ three\n   representative bibliographic identifiers within the currently\n  \
    \ proposed URN framework and syntax.\n   Note that this document does not purport\
    \ to define the \"official\"\n   standard way of moving these bibliographic identifiers\
    \ into URNs; it\n   merely demonstrates feasibility.  It has not been developed\
    \ in\n   consultation with these standards bodies and maintenance agencies\n \
    \  that oversee the existing bibliographic identifiers.  Any actual\n   Internet\
    \ standard for encoding these bibliographic identifiers as\n   URNs will need\
    \ to be developed in consultation with the responsible\n   standards bodies and\
    \ maintenance agencies.\n   In addition, there are several open questions with\
    \ regard to the\n   management and registry of Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) for\
    \ URNs.\n   For purposes of illustration, we have used the three NIDs \"ISBN\"\
    ,\n   \"ISSN\" and \"SICI\" for the three corresponding bibliographic\n   identifiers\
    \ discussed in this document.  While we believe this to be\n   the most appropriate\
    \ choice, it is not the only one.  The NIDs could\n   be based on the standards\
    \ body and standard number (e.g.  \"US-ANSI-\n   NISO-Z39.56-1997\" rather than\
    \ \"SICI\").  Alternatively, one could lump\n   all bibliographic identifiers\
    \ into a single \"BIBLIOGRAPHIC\" name\n   space, and structure the namespace-specific\
    \ string to specify which\n   identifier is being used.  Any final resolution\
    \ of this must wait for\n   the outcome of namespace management discussions in\
    \ the working group\n   and the broader IETF community.\n   For the purposes of\
    \ this document, we have selected three major\n   bibliographic identifiers (national\
    \ and international) to fit within\n   the URN framework.  These are the International\
    \ Standard Book Number\n   (ISBN) [ISO1], the International Standard Serials Number\
    \ (ISSN)\n   [NISO1,ISO2, ISO3], and the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier\n\
    \   (SICI) [NISO2].  An ISBN is used to identify a monograph (book).  An\n   ISSN\
    \ is used to identify serial publications (journals, newspapers)\n   as a whole.\
    \   A SICI augments the ISSN in order to identify\n   individual issues of serial\
    \ publications, or components within those\n   issues (such as an individual article,\
    \ or the table of contents of a\n   given issue).  The ISBN and ISSN are defined\
    \ in the United States by\n   standards issued by the National Information Standards\
    \ Organization\n   (NISO) and also by parallel international standards issued\
    \ under the\n   auspices of the International Organization for Standardization\
    \ (ISO).\n   NISO is the ANSI-accredited standards body serving libraries,\n \
    \  publishers and information services.  The SICI code is defined by a\n   NISO\
    \ document in the United States and does not have a parallel\n   international\
    \ standards document at present.\n   Many other bibliographic identifiers are\
    \ in common use (for example,\n   CODEN, numbers assigned by major bibliographic\
    \ utilities such as OCLC\n   and RLG, national library numbers such as the Library\
    \ of Congress\n   Control Number) or are under development.  While we do not discuss\n\
    \   them in this document, many of these will also need to be supported\n   within\
    \ the URN framework as it moves to large scale implementation.\n   The issues\
    \ involved in supporting those additional identifiers are\n   anticipated to be\
    \ broadly similar to those involved in supporting\n   ISBNs, ISSNs, and SICIs.\n"
- title: 2. Identification vs. Resolution
  contents:
  - "2. Identification vs. Resolution\n   It is important to distinguish between the\
    \ resource identified by a\n   URN and the resources a URN resolver that can reasonably\
    \ return when\n   attempting to resolve an identifier.  For example, the ISSN\
    \ 0040-781X\n   identifies the popular magazine \"Time\" -- all of it, every issue\
    \ for\n   from the start of publication to present.  Resolving such an\n   identifier\
    \ should not result in the equivalent of hundreds of\n   thousands of pages of\
    \ text and photos being dumped to the user's\n   machine.  It is more reasonable\
    \ for ISSNs to resolve to a\n   navigational system, such as an HTML-based search\
    \ form, so the user\n   may select issues or articles of interest.  ISBNs and\
    \ SICIs, on the\n   other hand, do identify finite, manageably-sized objects,\
    \ but these\n   objects may still be large enough that resolution to a hierarchical\n\
    \   system is appropriate.\n   In addition, the materials identified by an ISSN,\
    \ ISBN or SICI may\n   exist only in printed or other physical form, not electronically.\n\
    \   The best that a resolver may be able to offer is information about\n   where\
    \ to get the physical resource, such as library holdings or a\n   bookstore or\
    \ publisher order form.  The URN Framework provides\n   resolution services that\
    \ may be used to describe any differences\n   between the resource identified\
    \ by a URN and the resource that would\n   be returned as a result of resolving\
    \ that URN.\n"

  - "3.1 Overview\n   An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) identifies an edition\
    \ of\n   a monographic work.  The ISBN is defined by the standard\n   NISO/ANSI/ISO\
    \ 2108:1992 [ISO1]\n   Basically, an ISBN is a ten-digit number (actually, the\
    \ last digit\n   can be the letter \"X\" as well, as described below) which is\
    \ divided\n   into four variable length parts usually separated by hyphens when\n\
    \   printed.  The parts are as follows (in this order):\n   * a group identifier\
    \ which specifies a group of publishers, based on\n   national, geographic or\
    \ some other criteria,\n   * the publisher identifier,\n   * the title identifier,\n\
    \   * and a modulus 11 check digit, using X instead of 10.\n   The group and publisher\
    \ number assignments are managed in such a way\n   that the hyphens are not needed\
    \ to parse the ISBN unambiguously into\n   its constituent parts.  However, the\
    \ ISBN is normally transmitted and\n   displayed with hyphens to make it easy\
    \ for human beings to recognize\n   these parts without having to make reference\
    \ to or have knowledge of\n   the number assignments for group and publisher identifiers.\n"

    \ rules are\n   appropriate.  Prior to comparing two ISBN URNs for equivalence,\

    \ paperbound vs.  hardbound versions of the same work, electronic vs.\n   printed\
    \ versions of the same work, or versions of the same work\n   distinguished in\
    \ some other way (e.g., published for example in the\n   US and in Europe).  The\

    \ and a new edition\n   is itself somewhat subjective).  The use of ISBNs within\
    \ the URN\n   framework simply reflects these existing practices.  Note that it\
    \ is\n   likely that an ISBN URN will often resolve to many instances of the\n\
    \   work (many URLs).\n"

  - "5.1 Overview\n   The standard for Serial Item and Contribution Identifiers (SICI)\n\
    \   codes, which has recently been extensively revised, is defined by\n   NISO/ANSI\
    \ Z39.56-1997 [NISO2].  The maintenance agency for the SICI\n   code is the UnCover\
    \ Corporation.\n   SICI codes can be used to identify an issue of a serial, or\
    \ a\n   specific contribution (e.g., an article, or the table of contents)\n \
    \  within an issue of a serial.  SICI codes are not assigned, they are\n   constructed\
    \ based on information about the issue or issue component\n   in question.\n \
    \  The complete syntax for the SICI code will not be discussed here; see\n   NISO/ANSI\
    \ Z39.56-1997 [NISO2] for details.  However, an example and\n   brief review of\
    \ the major components is needed to understand the\n   relationship with the ISSN\
    \ and how this identifier differs from an\n   ISSN.  An example of a SICI code\
    \ is: 0015-\n   6914(19960101)157:1<62:KTSW>2.0.TX;2-F\n   The first nine characters\
    \ are the ISSN identifying the serial title.\n   The second component, in parentheses,\
    \ is the chronology information\n   giving the date the particular serial issue\
    \ was published.  In this\n   example that date was January 1, 1996.  The third\
    \ component, 157:1,\n   is enumeration information (volume, number) for the particular\
    \ issue\n   of the serial.  These three components comprise the \"item segment\"\
    \ of\n   a SICI code.  By augmenting the ISSN with the chronology and/or\n   enumeration\
    \ information, specific issues of the serial can be\n   identified.  The next\
    \ segment, <62:KTSW>, identifies a particular\n   contribution within the issue.\
    \  In this example we provide the\n   starting page number and a title code constructed\
    \ from the initial\n   characters of the title.  Identifiers assigned to a contribution\
    \ can\n   be used in the contribution segment if page numbers are\n   inappropriate.\
    \  The rest of the identifier is the control segment,\n   which includes a check\
    \ character.  Interested readers are encouraged\n   to consult the standard for\
    \ an explanation of the fields in that\n   segment.\n"

  - "5.3 Additional Considerations\n   Since the serial is identified by an ISSN,\
    \ some of the ambiguity\n   currently found in the assignment of ISSNs carries\
    \ over into SICI\n   codes.  In cases where an ISSN may refer to a serial that\
    \ exists in\n   multiple formats, the SICI contains a qualifier that specifies\
    \ the\n   format type (for example, print, microform, or electronic).  SICI\n\
    \   codes may be constructed from a variety of sources (the actual issue\n   of\
    \ the  serial, a citation or a record from an abstracting service)\n   and, as\
    \ such are based on the principle of using all available\n   information, so there\
    \ may be multiple SICI codes representing the\n   same article [NISO2, Appendix\
    \ D].  For example, one code might be\n   constructed with access to both chronology\
    \ and enumeration (that is,\n   date of issue and volume, issue and page number),\
    \ another code might\n   be constructed based only on enumeration information\
