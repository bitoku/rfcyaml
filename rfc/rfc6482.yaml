- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure\
    \ (RPKI)\n   is to improve routing security.  (See [RFC6480] for more\n   information.)\
    \  As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow\n   entities to verify\
    \ that an AS has been given permission by an IP\n   address block holder to advertise\
    \ routes to one or more prefixes\n   within that block.  A ROA provides this function.\n\
    \   The ROA makes use of the template for RPKI digitally signed objects\n   [RFC6488],\
    \ which defines a Crytopgraphic Message Syntax (CMS)\n   [RFC5652] wrapper for\
    \ the ROA content as well as a generic validation\n   procedure for RPKI signed\
    \ objects.  Therefore, to complete the\n   specification of the ROA (see Section\
    \ 4 of [RFC6488]), this document\n   defines:\n      1. The OID that identifies\
    \ the signed object as being a ROA.\n         (This OID appears within the eContentType\
    \ in the\n         encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed\n\
    \         attribute in the signerInfo object).\n      2. The ASN.1 syntax for\
    \ the ROA eContent.  (This is the payload\n         that specifies the AS being\
    \ authorized to originate routes as\n         well as the prefixes to which the\
    \ AS may originate routes.)\n         The ROA eContent is ASN.1 encoded using\
    \ the Distinguished\n         Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].\n      3. An additional\
    \ step required to validate ROAs (in addition to\n         the validation steps\
    \ specified in [RFC6488]).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms\
    \ and concepts\n   described in \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate\n\
    \   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\" [RFC5280] and \"X.509\n  \
    \ Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers\" [RFC3779].\n   Additionally,\
    \ this document makes use of the RPKI signed object\n   profile [RFC6488]; thus,\
    \ familiarity with that document is assumed.\n   Note that the RPKI signed object\
    \ profile makes use of certificates\n   adhering to the RPKI Resource Certificate\
    \ Profile [RFC6487]; thus,\n   familiarly with that profile is also assumed.\n\

- title: 2.  The ROA Content-Type
  contents:
  - "2.  The ROA Content-Type\n   The content-type for a ROA is defined as routeOriginAuthz\
    \ and has the\n   numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.24.\n   This OID\
    \ MUST appear both within the eContentType in the\n   encapContentInfo object\
    \ as well as the content-type signed attribute\n   in the signerInfo object (see\
    \ [RFC6488]).\n"
- title: 3.  The ROA eContent
  contents:
  - "3.  The ROA eContent\n   The content of a ROA identifies a single AS that has\
    \ been authorized\n   by the address space holder to originate routes and a list\
    \ of one or\n   more IP address prefixes that will be advertised.  If the address\n\
    \   space holder needs to authorize multiple ASes to advertise the same\n   set\
    \ of address prefixes, the holder issues multiple ROAs, one per AS\n   number.\
    \  A ROA is formally defined as:\n      RouteOriginAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {\n\
    \         version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\n         asID  ASID,\n         ipAddrBlocks\
    \ SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF ROAIPAddressFamily }\n      ASID ::= INTEGER\n  \
    \    ROAIPAddressFamily ::= SEQUENCE {\n         addressFamily OCTET STRING (SIZE\
    \ (2..3)),\n         addresses SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..MAX)) OF ROAIPAddress }\n  \
    \    ROAIPAddress ::= SEQUENCE {\n         address IPAddress,\n         maxLength\
    \ INTEGER OPTIONAL }\n      IPAddress ::= BIT STRING\n   Note that this content\
    \ appears as the eContent within the\n   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).\n"
- title: 3.1.  version
  contents:
  - "3.1.  version\n   The version number of the RouteOriginAttestation MUST be 0.\n"
- title: 3.2.  asID
  contents:
  - "3.2.  asID\n   The asID field contains the AS number that is authorized to originate\n\
    \   routes to the given IP address prefixes.\n"
- title: 3.3.  ipAddrBlocks
  contents:
  - "3.3.  ipAddrBlocks\n   The ipAddrBlocks field encodes the set of IP address prefixes\
    \ to\n   which the AS is authorized to originate routes.  Note that the syntax\n\
    \   here is more restrictive than that used in the IP address delegation\n   extension\
    \ defined in RFC 3779.  That extension can represent\n   arbitrary address ranges,\
    \ whereas ROAs need to represent only\n   prefixes.\n   Within the ROAIPAddressFamily\
    \ structure, addressFamily contains the\n   Address Family Identifier (AFI) of\
    \ an IP address family.  This\n   specification only supports IPv4 and IPv6. \
    \ Therefore, addressFamily\n   MUST be either 0001 or 0002.\n   Within a ROAIPAddress\
    \ structure, the addresses field represents\n   prefixes as a sequence of type\
    \ IPAddress.  (See [RFC3779] for more\n   details).  If present, the maxLength\
    \ MUST be an integer greater than\n   or equal to the length of the accompanying\
    \ prefix, and less than or\n   equal to the length (in bits) of an IP address\
    \ in the address family\n   (32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).  When present, the\
    \ maxLength\n   specifies the maximum length of the IP address prefix that the\
    \ AS is\n   authorized to advertise.  (For example, if the IP address prefix is\n\
    \   203.0.113/24 and the maxLength is 26, the AS is authorized to\n   advertise\
    \ any more specific prefix with a maximum length of 26.  In\n   this example,\
    \ the AS would be authorized to advertise 203.0.113/24,\n   203.0.113.128/25,\
    \ or 203.0.113.0/25, but not 203.0.113.0/27.)  When\n   the maxLength is not present,\
    \ the AS is only authorized to advertise\n   the exact prefix specified in the\
    \ ROA.\n   Note that a valid ROA may contain an IP address prefix (within a\n\
    \   ROAIPAddress element) that is encompassed by another IP address\n   prefix\
    \ (within a separate ROAIPAddress element).  For example, a ROA\n   may contain\
    \ the prefix 203.0.113/24 with maxLength 26, as well as the\n   prefix 203.0.113.0/28\
    \ with maxLength 28.  (Such a ROA would authorize\n   the indicated AS to advertise\
    \ any prefix beginning with 203.0.113\n   with a minimum length of 24 and a maximum\
    \ length of 26, as well as\n   the specific prefix 203.0.113.0/28.)  Additionally,\
    \ a ROA MAY contain\n   two ROAIPAddress elements, where the IP address prefix\
    \ is identical\n   in both cases.  However, this is NOT RECOMMENDED as, in such\
    \ a case,\n   the ROAIPAddress with the shorter maxLength grants no additional\n\
    \   privileges to the indicated AS and thus can be omitted without\n   changing\
    \ the meaning of the ROA.\n"
- title: 4.  ROA Validation
  contents:
  - "4.  ROA Validation\n   Before a relying party can use a ROA to validate a routing\n\
    \   announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ROA.  To\n   validate\
    \ a ROA, the relying party MUST perform all the validation\n   checks specified\
    \ in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional\n   ROA-specific validation\
    \ step.\n   o  The IP address delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the\n\
    \      end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each\n    \
    \  IP address prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the set of IP\n      addresses\
    \ specified by the EE certificate's IP address delegation\n      extension.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There is no assumption of confidentiality for\
    \ the data in a ROA; it\n   is anticipated that ROAs will be stored in repositories\
    \ that are\n   accessible to all ISPs, and perhaps to all Internet users.  There\
    \ is\n   no explicit authentication associated with a ROA, since the PKI used\n\
    \   for ROA validation provides authorization but not authentication.\n   Although\
    \ the ROA is a signed, application-layer object, there is no\n   intent to convey\
    \ non-repudiation via a ROA.\n   The purpose of a ROA is to convey authorization\
    \ for an AS to\n   originate a route to the prefix(es) in the ROA.  Thus, the\
    \ integrity\n   of a ROA MUST be established.  The ROA specification makes use\
    \ of the\n   RPKI signed object format; thus, all security considerations in\n\
    \   [RFC6488] also apply to ROAs.  Additionally, the signed object\n   profile\
    \ uses the CMS signed message format for integrity; thus, ROAs\n   inherit all\
    \ security considerations associated with that data\n   structure.\n   The right\
    \ of the ROA signer to authorize the target AS to originate\n   routes to the\
    \ prefix(es) is established through use of the address\n   space and AS number\
    \ PKI described in [RFC6480].  Specifically, one\n   MUST verify the signature\
    \ on the ROA using an X.509 certificate\n   issued under this PKI, and check that\
    \ the prefix(es) in the ROA match\n   those in the certificate's address space\
    \ extension.\n"
