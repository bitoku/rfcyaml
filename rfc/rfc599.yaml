  - "A.  INTRODUCTION\n   In July 1971, CCN published RFC #189 defining NETRJS, a\
    \ private\n   protocol for remote job entry.  NETRJS provides a Network interface\n\
    \   to CCN's rje program called RJS (Remote Job Service).(3)  As noted in\n  \
    \ an earlier RFC,(6) \"RJS\" is the proper name of a software package\n   existing\
    \ ony at CCN, not a generic term for rje.\n   For over two years now, CCN has\
    \ provided rje service to the Network\n   using NETRJS.  We know of the following\
    \ distinct implementations of\n   NETRJS user porgrams:\n      RAND          \
    \   OS/MVT on 370/158 (originally on 360/65)\n      UCLA-NMC         SEX on Sigma\
    \ 7\n      Illinois         ANTS on PDP-11\n      Utah             Tenex on PDP-10\n\
    \      MIT-DMCG         ITS on PDP-10\n      Harvard          DEC system on PDP-10\n\
    \      UCSB             OS/MVT on 360/75\n      ISI,BBN,NIC,I4   Tenex on PDP-10\n\
    \   We apologize to anyone slighted by omission from this list.  Writing\n   a\
    \ new user process for NETRJS has proved to be a modest and\n   straightforward\
    \ task.\n   During the month of October, 1973, CCN processed 1373 batch jobs via\n\
    \   NETRJS.  The complete statistics are:\n        1,373          Jobs submitted\n\
    \        1,105          Jobs \"printed\"\n            0          Jobs \"punched\"\
    \n"

  contents:
  - "B.  NEW ICP SOCKETS\n   At the request of the Socket Czar, Jon Postel, (see RFC\
    \ #433) we\n   intend to move the NETRJS ICP sockets from 11, 13, and 15 to 71,\
    \ 73,\n   and 75, respectively.  At present, NETRJS is available from either\n\
    \   socket subspace, so system programmers responsible for maintaining\n   NETRJS\
    \ user processes can switch over at their leisure.  We plan to\n   \"decommit\"\
    \ sockets 11, 13, and 15 on July 1, 1974.\n   Those hosts which access NETRJS\
    \ via socket 1 are unaffected.\n"
- title: C.  NEW NETRJS
  contents:
  - "C.  NEW NETRJS\n   Last Fall, CCN installed a new implementation of its NETRJS\
    \ server.\n   An internal NETRJS rewrite was necessitated by other system changes\n\
    \   and was timed to coincide with installation on September 5 of the\n   \"last\
    \ release\" of OS/360, Release 21.7.  The new version of NETRJS\n   contains a\
    \ number of internal improvements over the original version\n   written two years\
    \ ago.  There are also a few external differences, as\n   follows:\n      1. No\
    \ More Squish\n         The long-standing \"squish\" problem in NETRJS has been\
    \ fixed.\n         This problem arose because of the \"squishiness\" of Network\
    \ data\n         transfer, i.e. the variable delay between originator and\n  \
    \       receiver processes due to NCP buffering.  The result was that a\n    \
    \     short print output file could be \"transmitted\" by RJS,\n         dequeued,\
    \ and discarded at CCN before the first message had\n         actually reached\
    \ the remote host.  If the remote host crashed\n         or the user tried to\
    \ cancel (and save) the output stream, it\n         was too late; the output was\
    \ lost in the \"squish\".  We were\n         careless about this in the first\
    \ version.  Now NETRJS awaits\n         the RFNM from the end-of-data mark before\
    \ telling RJS to\n         discard the job output.\n"

    \    2. Timeouts\n         The new verson is a little tougher on timeouts, to\
    \ free CCN\n         resources when users are slow.\n            a. Signon Timeout\n\
    \               If the user, after connecting to NETRJS and receiving the\n  \
    \             READY message, fails to send a valid SIGNON command\n          \
    \     within 3 minutes, CCN will close the Telnet connections.\n            b.\
    \ Data Transfer Timeout\n               (1)  CCN will abort the READER data transfer\
    \ connection\n               if the user site leaves the connection open without\n\
    \               sending any bits for 5 minutes.\n               (2)  CCN will\
    \ abort the PRINTER or PUNCH data transfer\n               connection if the user\
    \ site stops accepting bits for 5\n               minutes.\n      3. New Messages\n\
    \         The NETRJS messages to the remote terminal have been revised to\n  \
    \       better distinguish problems at CCN, at the user site, or in the\n    \
    \     Network.  See Reference 8 for a complete list.\n      4. Subsystem Interrupt\n\
    \         The user can send a Control-C to terminate his NETRJS session\n    \
    \     either before or after signon.  Continuation is not possible\n         after\
    \ the Control-C.\n         This provides an escape for a user who for some reason\
    \ can't\n         signon or signoff or close his Telnet connection.  If the user\n\
    \         entered via the RJS command in Socket 1, Control C will return\n   \
    \      him to the Server Telnet command level.\n   One other improvement will\
    \ reduce user frustration:  NETRJS now\n   returns an INVALID SIGNON message if\
    \ the user enters anything but a\n   valid SIGNON command after initially connecting\
    \ to the NETRJS server.\n"

- title: D.  CLARIFICATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO NETRJS PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "D.  CLARIFICATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO NETRJS PROTOCOL\n   Over the past two years,\
    \ system programmers writing NETRJS user\n   processes have pointed out areas\
    \ of the protocol which were poorly\n   defined in RFC #189.  In addition a few\
    \ minor changes have been made,\n   largely as the result of implementation accidents.\n\
    \      1.  The jobname header of a print file does not have an ASA\n         \
    \ carriage control byte.  However, it will be encoded in the\n          format\
    \ (compressed or truncated) selected by a particular\n          VRBT.\n      2.\
    \  The punch connection sends 81 byte records, the first byte\n          being\
    \ a blank carriage control character.  This is contrary to\n          RFC #189\
    \ and is illogical; it was an implementation bug which\n          we kept for\
    \ compatibility.\n      3.  Page 3 of RFC #189 defined fixed values for the user's\
    \ data\n          transfer sockets relative to his Telnet sockets.  In fact,\n\
    \          NETRJS does not enforce these user data transfer sockets but\n    \
    \      will accept RFC's for any user sockets.\n      4.  RFC #189 specified a\
    \ choice of two character mappings for the\n          virtual remote batch terminal:\
    \  EBCDIC and ASCII (-68).  An\n          ASCII-63 mapping was later added for\
    \ the convenience of users\n          with Model 33-like keyboards (RAND, actually).\
    \  The ASCII-63\n          mapping is selected by doing an ICP to socket 75 or\
    \ by\n          entering \"TTYRJS\" in CN's Telnet Server.  figure 1 shows the\n\
    \          actual ASCII-63 mapping in use today.  This supercedes the\n      \
    \    earlier version of the mapping, shown in RFC 338.\n      5.  The ASCII-68\
    \ mapping specified in RFC 189 was also changed to\n          provide unique mappings\
    \ for all ASCII characters.  The present\n          ASCII-68 mapping used by both\
    \ NETRJS and TSO at CCN is shown\n          in Figure 1.\n"
- title: E.  RJS TERMINAL OPTIONS
  contents:
  - "E.  RJS TERMINAL OPTIONS\n   When a new NETRJS virtual terminal is defined, certain\
    \ options are\n   available; these options are listed below.  If the user does\
    \ not\n   specify otherwise, CCN will use truncated data format and turn all\n\
    \   other options on.\n      1. Truncated/Compressed Data Format\n         As\
    \ explained in RFC 189, a virtual remote batch terminal under\n         RJS may\
    \ use either the turncated data format (default) or the\n"

    \       compressed format for printer and punch output.  With the\n         truncated\
    \ format, CCN merely removes trailing blanks from each\n         output line;\
    \ if compressed format is specified, CCN will also\n         encode strings of\
    \ inbedded blanks or other repeated characters.\n         CCN will accept either\
    \ format in the card reader stream,\n         regardless of the terminal option.\
    \  See Reference 9 for\n         discussion of the virtues of compression.\n \
    \     2. Automatic Coldstart Job Resubmission\n         If \"R\" (Restart) is\
    \ specified in the accounting field on the\n         JOB card and if this option\
    \ is chosen, RJS will automatically\n         resubmit the job from the beginning\
    \ if the CCN operating system\n         should be \"coldstarted\" before all output\
    \ from the job is\n         returned.  Otherwise, the job will be lost and must\
    \ be\n         resubmitted from the remote terminal in case of a coldstart.\n\
    \      3. Automatic Output RESTART\n         With this option, transmission of\
    \ printer output which is\n         interrupted by a broken connection always\
    \ starts over at the\n         beginning.  Without this option, the output is\
    \ backspaced\n         approximately one page when restarted, unless the user\
    \ forces\n         the output to start over from the beginning with a RESTART\n\
    \         command when the printer connection is re-opened and before\n      \
    \   printing begins.\n      4. Password Protection\n         This option allows\
    \ a password to be supplied when a terminal is\n         signed on, preventing\
    \ unauthorized use of the terminal ID.\n      5. Suppression of Punch Separator\
    \ and Large Letters.\n         This option suppresses both separator cards which\
    \ RJS normally\n         puts in front of each punched output deck, and separator\
    \ pages\n         on printed output containing the job name in large block\n \
    \        letters.  These separators are an operational aid when the\n        \
    \ ouptut is directed to a real printer or punch, but generally\n         undesirable\
    \ for an ARPA user who is saving the output in a file\n         for on-line examination.\n"

  - "F.  WARNING ON TENEX NETRJS USER PROCESS (6)\n   The Tenex implementation of\
    \ NETRJS user program is a command normally\n   called \"RJS\".  This program\
    \ has some pitfalls of which users should\n   be aware.\n      1.  For strictly\
    \ historical reasons, the commonly-available\n          version of the Tenex RJS\
    \ command uses Socket 15, and\n          therefore, the ASCII-63 translation.\
    \  We hope to propagate\n          soon a version which uses the ASCII-68 mapping\
    \ via Socket 73,\n          and stamp out the earlier version.\n      2.  The\
    \ Tenex RJS command fails to recognize the US character\n          sometimes used\
    \ instead of CR LF as end-of-line.  As noted in\n          RFC 571, the Tenex\
    \ user FTP program has the same problem.\n      3.  The Tenex RJS command truncates\
