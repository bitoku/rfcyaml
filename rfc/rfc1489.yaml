  - "Introduction\n   Though the proposed character set \"koi8-r\" is not currently\
    \ an\n   international standard, there is very large user community (including\n\
    \   Relcom Net) supporting it.  Factually, \"koi8-r\" is de-facto standard\n \
    \  for Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.\n   This\
    \ is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes\n   \"koi8-r\"\
    \ should be registered.\n   MIME character set name: koi8-r\n   Published specification:\
    \ This standard is unpublished, but based on\n   several published standards:\
    \ GOST 19768-74 (old-koi8), ISO 6937/8\n   (not registered) and variations: INIS-cyrillic,\
    \ ISO 5427.\n"
