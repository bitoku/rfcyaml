  - "2. Introduction\n   This document describes the SPIRITS protocol requirements,\
    \ based on\n   the architecture presented in RFC 3136.  (SPIRITS stands for \"\
    Service\n   in the PSTN/IN Requesting InTernet Service.\")  The purpose of the\n\
    \   protocol is to support services that originate in the Public Switched\n  \
    \ Telephone Network (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions between the\n   PSTN\
    \ and the Internet.  Such services are called SPIRITS services.\n   (Internet\
    \ Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet\n   Call Forwarding\
    \ are examples of SPIRIT services, but the protocol is\n   to define the building\
    \ blocks from which many other services can be\n   built.)  On the PSTN side,\
    \ the SPIRITS services are initiated from\n   the Intelligent Network (IN) entities;\
    \ the earlier IETF work on the\n   PSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted\
    \ in the protocol (RFC 2848)\n   in support of the services initiated the other\
    \ way around--from the\n   Internet to PSTN.\n   To this end, this document lists\
    \ general requirements for the SPIRITS\n   protocol as well as those pertinent\
    \ to IN, Wireless IN, and PINT\n   building blocks.  The document also presents\
    \ the SPIRITS WG consensus\n   on the choice of the SPIRITS signaling protocol.\
    \  The joint\n   PINT/SPIRITS architecture (described in [1]) is depicted in Figure\
    \ 1.\n   It is assumed that the Spirits Client is either co-located with the\n\
    \   IN Service Control Function (SCF) or communicates with it (over the\n   PSTN-specific\
    \ interface D) in such a way so as to act on behalf of\n   the PSTN/IN.  (This\
    \ assumption is confirmed by current\n   implementations, as reported in [2].)\n\
    \   The SPIRITS services are invoked (and, subsequently, the SPIRITS\n   protocol\
    \ is initiated) when a message from a SPIRITS Client (located\n   in the IN Service\
    \ Control Point [SCP] or Service Node [SN]) arrives\n   on interface C to the\
    \ SPIRITS gateway.  The Spirits gateway processes\n   the message and, in turn,\
    \ passes it on over the Interface B to the\n   SPIRITS server.  In most practically\
    \ important cases, the request\n   from a SPIRITS client is ultimately caused\
    \ by a request from a\n   Central Office (i.e., a telephone switch) sent to either\
    \ the SCP or\n   SN, although the Internet-based service initiation by these elements\n\
    \   that had not been triggered by the Central Office is theoretically\n   possible.\
    \  (Definitely, none of the SPIRITS benchmark services are\n   initiated in such\
    \ a way, so, for the purposes of the SPIRITS protocol\n   development, it should\
    \ be assumed that the service invocation was a\n   direct result of an earlier\
    \ action by the Service Switching\n   Function.)\n                           \

    \             Figure 1. Joint PINT/SPIRITS Architecture\n   With PINT (and that\
    \ also applies to the PINT architecture and\n   protocol as described in [3]),\
    \ the service request to the PINT Server\n   is always initiated by the PINT Client\
    \ over the interface A.  The PINT\n   Server can either be co-located with the\
    \ IN Service Control or a\n   similar entity (referred to as \"Executive System\"\
    \ by [3]) or\n   communicate with it over the PSTN-specific interface E.\n   As\
    \ Figure 1 shows, the PINT Client and SPIRITS Server are co-located\n   in Subscriber's\
    \ IP Host.  In fact, both can be implemented to run as\n   one process.  No provision\
    \ is made for interactions between the PINT\n   Client and Spirits Server.  Similarly,\
    \ the PINT Server/PINT Gateway\n   and SPIRITS gateway are assumed to be co-located,\
    \ too.  This\n   assumption is convenient but not essential; the PINT Server could\n\
    \   also be co-located with the SPIRITS Client.  In either case, no\n   specific\
    \ provision is made to define interworking between either the\n   PINT Server\
    \ and Spirits Gateway or PINT Server and SPIRITS Client\n   other than by listing\
    \ the overall PINT-related requirements.\n   Since the currently deployed worldwide\
    \ wireless networks are based on\n   circuit switching, they are considered PSTN\
    \ networks for the SPIRITS\n   purposes.  Adding SPIRITS type of services to wireless\
    \ networks can\n   allow new services to be developed (for example geolocation\n\
    \   information can be handled in the IP network).\n   Nevertheless, there are\
    \ certain peculiarities of wireless networks,\n   which force considerations to\
    \ be made in the protocol\n   requirements and in the SPIRITS architecture.\n\
    \   A particular Wireless IN standard development being considered here\n   is\
    \ CAMEL phase 3, standardized by the Third Generation Partnership\n   group (3GPP).\
    \  The relevant service and architectural considerations\n   and protocol requirements\
    \ are presented later in this document.  As\n   far as the architecture is concerned,\
    \ certain wireless events are\n   generated by Home Location Register (HLR), which\
    \ may, but does not\n   have to, be part of the Mobile Switching Center (MSC)\
    \ (a wireless\n   equivalent of the SSP).  These events are communicated to Service\n\
    \   Control, at which point they use the same mechanism for invoking\n   SPIRITS\
    \ services that the IN would.\n   The rest of this document addresses the general\
    \ requirements,\n   IN Requirements, specific Wireless IN requirements, PINT\n\
    \   Requirements, the protocol development methodology, and security\n   issues,\
    \ in that order.\n"
- title: 3. General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. General Requirements\n   Based on the success of extending SIP for PINT ([3])\
    \ and, especially,\n   the results of pre-SPIRITS implementations reported in\
    \ [2], the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7] has been chosen as the\n\
    \   signaling base protocol for SPIRITS.\n   Thus, it is a requirement that specific\
    \ SPIRITS-related parameters be\n   carried in a manner consistent with SIP practices.\
    \  In particular,\n   either Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] or Multi-purpose\n\
    \   Internet Mail Extensions MIME [5-6] may be used for this purpose.\n   Except\
    \ for the proposed new SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY mechanism [4], and\n   extensions already\
    \ defined in PINT, no new SIP extensions are\n   foreseen; instead the SPIRITS\
    \ protocol is to rely on the above\n   extension mechanisms.\n   It is by no means\
    \ a requirement that any SPIRITS implementation\n   automatically support PINT\
    \ services.  The SPIRITS protocol must be\n   defined in a manner where, as the\
    \ minimum, it can support only the\n   basic notification mechanism without relying\
    \ on PINT services or\n   otherwise relying on persistent interactions with PSTN.\n\
    \   Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated [2] that combining PINT\n   building\
    \ blocks with those of SPIRITS is beneficial to building rich,\n   enhanced PSTN/Internet\
    \ services, so the SPIRITS protocol must meet\n   the PINT-related requirements\
    \ listed in section 7 of this document.\n   One specific example demonstrating\
    \ the application of the latter\n   requirement, which is elaborated on further\
    \ in this document, is as\n   follows: Implementation of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY is not\
    \ mandatory as far\n   as the minimum SPIRITS protocol is concerned.  Thus, the\
    \ initial PSTN\n   (Detection Point) notification will always arrive via the SIP\
    \ INVITE\n   method; however, to implement persistent interactions with the PSTN,\n\
    \   the SUBSCRIBE method may be used to obtain further notifications of\n   the\
    \ PSTN events.  Subsequently, these events will be reported on by\n   means of\
    \ the NOTIFY method.\n"
- title: 4. IN Requirements
  contents:
  - "4. IN Requirements\n   The interface immediately relevant to IN is that between\
    \ the SPIRITS\n   Client and SPIRITS Gateway (interface C).  A typical message\
    \ (which\n   starts a SPIRITS service) looks like this:\n   C -> G: <Event Notification>,\
    \ <Parameter-List (DP)>\n   The relevant events correspond to the detection points\
    \ (DPs) of the\n   IN Basic Call State Model (BCSM).  The <Parameter-List> is\
    \ a function\n   of a specific DP; it contains the parameters relevant to it.\
    \  The\n   following requirements apply:\n   1) The list of the DPs to be covered\
    \ encompasses those defined in the\n      IN Capability Set 3 BCSM as well as\
    \ those which relate to the\n      Wireless IN (WIN) specified by the IMT 2000\
    \ project in ITU-T.\n   2) Not all parameters associated with such DPs are needed\
    \ by the\n      SPIRITS benchmark services, nor may all the parameters be needed\n\
    \      in SPIRITS.  The selection of the relevant parameters is part of\n    \
    \  the SPIRITS protocol definition.\n   3) It is desirable to avoid semantic overload\
    \ of protocol messages.\n      (One way to achieve that is to match each type\
    \ of an event with a\n      message that corresponds to it.)  As the SPIRITS protocol\
    \ is\n      designed as a set of extensions to another (existing) protocol\n \
    \     with the defined message set, the syntax and semantics of the\n      extensions\
    \ should be defined with this requirement in mind.\n   4) The ITU-T Recommendations\
    \ use the abstract syntax notation (ASN.1)\n      to specify the semantics of\
    \ the IN Application Protocol (INAP)\n      parameters, which are expected to\
    \ be binary-encoded.  Neither the\n      use of the ASN.1, nor the requirement\
    \ for binary encoding are the\n      typical requirements for the IETF application\
    \ protocols.\n      Recognizing that, provisions must be made for careful\n  \
    \    specification of the conversion of the INAP parameters to text,\n      which\
    \ must preserve their original semantics.  The actual\n      conversion of the\
    \ parameters is the function of the SPIRITS\n      Client.\n      In order to\
    \ issue an initial query (or a notification) to service\n      control, a switch\
    \ must have such a DP set.  This can be done\n      statically via service management\
    \ (this particular action should\n      be left to implementation and thus is\
    \ considered outside of the\n      scope of SPIRITS Protocol) or dynamically--but\
    \ only for the\n      purpose of a particular call--from the service control.\
    \  In the\n      latter case, it is part of the SPIRITS (or PINT) protocol to\n\
    \      request the event notification from the service control.  The SIP\n   \
    \   specific event notification scheme [4] should be specifically\n      considered.\
    \  This function can be performed by either the Spirits\n      Client or PINT\
    \ Server, the distinction being further discussed in\n      the next section.\
    \  Assuming that it is performed by the SPIRITS\n      Client, the relevant message\
    \ should look like:\n      G->C: SUBSCRIBE <Event> <Mode> <DP-specific parameters>,\n\
    \      where <Event> refers to a particular DP; <Mode> determines whether\n  \
    \    the Event Detection Point (EDP) is to be armed as EDP Request\n      (EDP-R),\
    \ EDP Notification (EDP-N), or TDP-R (the need for TDP-N is\n      not foreseen\
    \ because it would not provide any additional\n      capability for SPIRITS);\
    \ and the <DP-specific parameters> is the\n      list of the values of the parameters\
    \ associated with the EDP (for\n      example, if the DP in question is O_No_Answer,\
    \ then the value of\n      the appropriate timer should be included in the list).\
    \  Note that\n      such a subscription may also originate at a) PINT Client or\
    \ b)\n      SPIRITS Gateway, either of which may (but does not have to) have a\n\
    \      locally significant definition of the <Event>.  In either case, it\n  \
    \    is the function of the SPIRITS Client to translate the definition\n     \
    \ of the Event into a particular DP (or set of DPs) when passing the\n      message\
    \ to Service Control.  To summarize, for the case when PINT\n      and SPIRITS\
    \ events are defined in a way where they do not refer to\n      the BCSM DPs,\
    \ it is the function of the SPIRITS Client to define a\n      mapping:\n     \
    \ Event -> DP List,\n      for each event for which the PSTN notification is needed.\n\
    \      The list of CS-3 DPs envisioned in SPIRITS is:\n      -  origination_attempt_authorized\
    \ (the SPIRITS service can control\n         call attempts, (for example, to limit\
    \ calls during specific\n         time periods)\n      -  collected_information\
    \ and analyzed_information (for SPIRITS\n         outgoing call screening)\n \
    \     -  o_answer, o_term_seized, and t_answer (to release SPIRITS\n         resources\
    \ after the call is complete and perform relevant OA&M\n         actions such\
    \ as creating a record of attempts to reach a party\n         via various means\
    \ like land-line phone, cell phone, SMS, or\n         paging.)\n      -  o_no_answer,\
    \ route_select_failure, and t_no_answer (to re-route\n         a call)\n     \
    \ -  o_called_party_busy (to re-route a call and for Internet Call\n         Waiting)\n\
    \      -  o_mid_call and t_mid_call (to assist a midcall action)\n      -  o_abandon,\
    \ o_disconnect, t_abandon, and t_disconnect  (to\n         terminate a SPIRITS\
    \ service and release the resources and\n         perform relevant OA&M actions\
    \ such as creating a record of\n         attempts to reach a party via various\
    \ means like land-line\n         phone, cell phone, SMS, or paging.)\n   In addition,\
    \ the following DPs are relevant to the present SPIRITS\n   milestone services:\n\
    \      - termination_attempt_authorized\n      - facility_selected_and_available\
    \ (could be used in SPIRITS\n         Internet Caller-ID)\n      - t_busy (for\

- title: 5. Wireless-IN-related Requirements
  contents:
  - "5. Wireless-IN-related Requirements\n   Wireless IN covers several types of \"\
    calls,\" which are neither\n   circuit switched nor have an effect on circuit\
    \ switched calls.  For\n   this reason, those are not considered in SPIRITS requirements.\
    \  To\n   further clarify this point, the types of \"calls\" not considered are:\n\
    \      -  USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data)\n      -  GPRS (General\
    \ Packet Radio System)\n      -  SMS (Short Message System)\n         The types\
    \ of calls relevant to SPIRITS are as follows:\n      a) Voice Calls.  In this\
    \ case no new DP is needed since CAMEL DPs\n         are included in CS2.  The\
    \ only special case is \"Not Reachable\"\n         (when it is detected that the\
    \ mobile user is out of coverage or\n         has switched off), which is mapped\
    \ as a special cause in the\n         Busy DP.  Since the Busy DP parameters would\
    \ be received (if a\n         SPIRITS service has subscribed to Busy), it would\
    \ be possible\n         to distinguish a \"busy\" from a \"not reachable\" situation.\n\
    \         This translates into the requirement that one of the parameters\n  \
    \       in the Event Notification message (from SPIRITS Client to\n         SPIRITS\
    \ Gateway, over the interface C) denotes the \"cause\" for\n         the Busy\
    \ Detection Point.\n         Another aspect of difference, when compared to PSTN,\
    \ is setting\n         of static DPs.  In CAMEL networks, this is done in the\
    \ Home\n         Location Register (HLR) (and copied to the VLR during location\n\
    \         update).  It is important to note this difference, even though\n   \
    \      it has no effect on  SPIRITS protocol.\n      b) Mobility Management events.\
    \  This allows a SPIRITS server to be\n         notified of changes of location\
    \ of a mobile user.  The events\n         would only be applicable to mobile users\
    \ reachable through a\n         Circuit-Switched network.  To provide for this\
    \ function, the\n         subscription marks must be set in the subscriber's HLR.\
    \  This\n         is equivalent to setting TDPs in the SSP.  In this case, the\n\
    \         marks in the HLR (which are copied to the Visitor Location\n       \
    \  Register [VLR] on location update) are not mapped into Trigger\n         Detection\
    \ Points.\n         As with TDP setting, this is outside of the scope of SPIRITS\n\
    \         protocol.\n         In order to support this function in SPIRITS, the\
    \ SPIRITS\n         protocol should be able to map the CAMEL specific operations\n\
    \         into events notification to the SPIRITS client.  Since the SCP\n   \
    \      receives the information about the mobility state, this\n         involves\
    \ the C interface.  (This is just an extension of the DP\n         notification\
    \ mechanism from the SPIRITS client to the SPIRITS\n         gateway).\n     \
    \    The events (which are not DP-related) which need notifications\n        \
    \ are:\n            -  Location Update in the same VLR service area\n        \
    \    -  Location Update in another VLR service area\n            -  IMSI attach\n\
    \            -  MS initiated IMSI detach\n            -  Network initiated IMSI\
    \ detach.\n         With this mechanism, the SPIRITS services can use the user-\n\
    \         profile-based location information.  For example, the Internet\n   \
    \      Call Waiting service can re-direct the call to a mobile phone.\n      c)\
    \ Supplementary Services Notification.\n         This mechanism makes a SPIRITS\
    \ server aware of a subscriber\n         having invoked one of the following supplementary\
    \ services:\n         Explicit Call Transfer, Call Deflection, Call Completion\
    \ on\n         Busy Subscriber, or Multi-Party.\n"
- title: 6. PINT-related Requirements
  contents:
  - "6. PINT-related Requirements\n   Before a SPIRITS service can be invoked, the\
    \ relevant IP Host must be\n   registered.  Thus, Registration is an essential\
    \ service, which is\n   initiated from the IP side.  The registration information\
    \ is\n   ultimately used by the PSTN to authenticate the subscriber.\n   Depending\
    \ on the model, this can be done in two ways with the present\n   architecture:\n\
    \   1) The PINT Client issues the appropriate Register message over the\n   interface\
    \ A, which is then passed by the PINT server to the SPIRITS\n   Gateway and SPIRITS\
    \ Client:\n   PINT C.: -- Register --> PINT S. [--> SPIRITS Gateway --> SPIRITS\n\
    \   C.].  In this case the SPIRITS Client (co-located with the service\n   control)\
    \ is responsible for record keeping and the authentication.\n   2) The PINT Client\
    \ issues the appropriate Register message to the\n   PINT Server, which then passes\
    \ this information to the PSTN service\n   control \"by magic\".\n   The second\
    \ model is much easier to handle, because it involves only\n   one relevant interface\
    \ (\"A\"); however it assumes no interworking\n   between PINT and SPIRITS except\
    \ that the SPIRITS Client finds \"by\n   magic\" that a friendly and expecting\
    \ IP Host is alive and well.\n   Finally, in the event PINT is not implemented,\
    \ the SIP SUBSCRIBE\n   mechanism can be used.\n   As noted in the previous section,\
    \ the existing SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY PINT\n   building blocks [3] must be extended\
    \ for their use in SPIRITS for the\n   purposes of setting DPs/getting DP event\
    \ notifications.  (A more\n   general SIP mechanism for the same PINT-introduced\
    \ block is described\n   in [4]; it provides the necessary mechanism for specifying\
    \ relevant\n   events.)  Conversely, the same building blocks for the functional\n\
    \   capabilities can be used in both PINT and SPIRITS protocols.  Note,\n   however,\
    \ that in SPIRITS the PSTN notification may arrive without a\n   particular subscription\
    \ to an event (in the case of a statically set\n   DP).\n"

    \ the set\n   of messages), the PSTN events associated with each detection point\
    \ of\n   the Basic Call State Model should be examined.  To date, the CS-3\n \

- title: 9. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Security Considerations\n   Overall, the basic aspects of security apply to\
    \ SPIRITS protocol:\n   -  Authentication:\n      In the communications between\
    \ the SPIRITS Client and SPIRITS\n      Gateway as well as the SPIRITS Gateway\
    \ and SPIRITS Server, it is\n      required that the information be sent between\
    \ known and trusted\n      partners.\n   -  Integrity:\n      It is a requirement\
    \ that no exchanged data be modified in transit.\n   -  Confidentiality:\n   \
    \   It is a requirement that any private user information or\n      confidential\
    \ network data be protected by the protocol (typically\n      through encryption,\
    \ for which the protocol should allow a choice\n      in the algorithm selection.\n\
    \   -  Availability:\n      It is a requirement that the communicating endpoints\
    \ remain in\n      service for authorized use only.\n   In addition, the protocol\
    \ should support non-repudiation for those\n   control messages pertinent to charging\
    \ the PSTN subscriber.\n   As Figure 1 demonstrates, there are two distinct communications\n\
    \   interfaces, B and C.  The B interface is, in general, across the\n   public\
    \ Internet and is thus most vulnerable to security attacks\n   resulting in theft\
    \ or denial of service.  The C interface, on the\n   other hand is likely to be\
    \ implemented across a service providers\n   intranet, where the security measures\
    \ should be applied at the\n   discretion of the service provider.  Even then,\
    \ because at least one\n   IP host (the PINT gateway) is connected to the Internet,\
    \ special\n   measures (e.g., installation of firewalls, although this particular\n\
    \   measure alone may be insufficient) need to be taken to protect the\n   interface\
    \ C and the rest of the network from security attacks.\n   The assumption that\
    \ the PINT Client and SPIRITS server are co-\n   located, dictates that the security\
    \ considerations for the A and B\n   interfaces are exactly same.  Detailed security\
    \ requirements and\n   solutions for interface A (and, consequently, B) can be\
    \ found in RFC\n   2848 [3].\n   Possible security attacks can result in both\
    \ theft and denial of\n   services.  In addition, such attacks may violate the\
    \ privacy of a\n   PSTN subscriber.  For example, with Internet Call Waiting,\
    \ a\n   fraudulent registration (or a manipulation of integrity of a valid\n \
    \  registration) may force a network operator to provide to an\n   authorized\
    \ party a full log of attempted telephone calls (accompanied\n   by the identification\
    \ of callers).  Furthermore, the calls may be\n   diverted to wrong recipients\
    \ (who may further defraud the\n   unsuspecting calling party).  In this case,\
    \ the calling party is\n   using only the PSTN and thus expecting the security\
    \ of communications\n   that are typical of the PSTN.  The PSTN service providers\
    \ may be\n   liable for the consequences of establishing wrong connections.  In\n\
    \   addition, the PSTN service providers may be liable for inadvertent\n   divulging\
    \ of the private information of the subscriber.\n   The service and network providers\
    \ need to review the possibilities of\n   the security attacks and prepare the\
    \ means of protection from them.\n   Some of this may be achieved by using the\
    \ means outside of those\n   provided by the protocol itself.  For example, administrative\n\
    \   information (such as statistics collected by PINT MIB or SPIRITS MIB)\n  \
    \ can help in determining violations and thwarting them.  As far as the\n   protocol\
    \ is concerned, it must provide the means for authenticating a\n   subscriber\
    \ as well as a session.  It must also provide a capability\n   to carry encrypted\
    \ information in its body.\n"
