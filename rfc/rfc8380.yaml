  - "3.  Directory Assistance to Non-RBridge\n   With directory assistance [RFC7067]
    [RFC8171], a non-RBridge node can\n   learn if a data packet needs to be forwarded
    across the RBridge\n   domain and, if so, the corresponding egress RBridge.\n
    \  Suppose the RBridge domain boundary starts at network switches (not\n   virtual
    switches embedded on servers).  (See Figure 1 for a high-\n   level diagram of
    a typical data center network.)  A directory can\n   assist virtual switches embedded
    on servers to encapsulate with a\n   proper TRILL header by providing the nickname
    of the egress RBridge\n   edge to which the destination is attached.  The other
    information\n   needed to encapsulate can be learned either by listening to TRILL\n
    \  ES-IS and/or IS-IS Hellos [RFC7176] [RFC8171], which will indicate\n   the
    MAC address and nickname of appropriate local edge RBridges, or\n   by configuration.\n
    \  If it is not known whether a destination is attached to one or more\n   edge
    RBridges, based on the directory, the non-RBridge node can\n   forward the data
    frames natively, i.e., not encapsulating with any\n   TRILL header.  Or, if the
    directory is known to be complete, the non-\n   RBridge node can discard such

    \  When a TRILL-encapsulated data packet reaches the ingress RBridge,\n   that
    RBridge simply performs the usual TRILL processing and forwards\n   the pre-encapsulated
    packet to the RBridge that is specified by the\n   egress nickname field of the
    TRILL header.  When an ingress RBridge\n   receives a native Ethernet frame in
    an environment with complete\n   directory information, the ingress RBridge doesn't
    flood or forward\n   the received data frames when the destination MAC address
    in the\n   Ethernet data frames is unknown.\n   When all end nodes attached to
    an ingress RBridge pre-encapsulate\n   with a TRILL header for traffic across
    the TRILL domain, the ingress\n   RBridge doesn't need to encapsulate any native
    Ethernet frames to the\n   TRILL domain.  The attached nodes can be connected
    to multiple edge\n   RBridges by having multiple ports or through a bridged LAN.
    \ All\n   RBridge edge ports connected to one bridged LAN can receive and\n   forward
    pre-encapsulated traffic; this can greatly improve the\n   overall network utilization.
    \ However, it is still necessary to, for\n   example, designate AF ports to be
    sure that multi-destination packets\n   from the TRILL campus are only egressed
    through one RBridge.\n   Item 8 of Section 4.6.2 of the TRILL base protocol specification\n
    \  [RFC6325] specifies that an RBridge port can be configured to accept\n   TRILL-encapsulated
    frames from a neighbor that is not an RBridge.\n   When a TRILL frame arrives
    at an RBridge whose nickname matches the\n   destination nickname in the TRILL
    header of the frame, the processing\n   is exactly as normal: as specified in
    [RFC6325], the RBridge\n   decapsulates the received TRILL frame and forwards
    the decapsulated\n   frame to the target attached to its edge ports.  When the
    destination\n   MAC address of the decapsulated Ethernet frame is not in the egress\n
    \  RBridge's local MAC attachment tables, the egress RBridge floods the\n   decapsulated
    frame to all attached links in the frame's VLAN, or\n   drops the frame (if the
    egress RBridge is configured with that\n   policy).\n   We call a node that, as
    specified herein, only performs TRILL\n   encapsulation, but doesn't participate
    in RBridge's IS-IS routing, a\n   TRILL Encapsulating Node (TRILL-EN).  The TRILL
    Encapsulating Node\n   can pull (MAC and VLAN) <-> Edge RBridge mapping from directory\n
    \  servers [RFC8171].  In order to do this, a TRILL-EN MUST support\n   TRILL
    ES-IS [RFC8171].\n   Upon receiving or locally generating a native Ethernet frame,
    the\n   TRILL-EN checks the (MAC and VLAN) <-> Edge RBridge mapping and\n   performs
    the corresponding TRILL encapsulation if the mapping entry\n   is found as shown
    in Figure 2.  If the destination MAC address and\n   VLAN of the received Ethernet
    frame doesn't exist in the mapping\n   table and there is no positive reply from
    pull requests to a\n   directory, the Ethernet frame is dropped or is forwarded
    in native\n   form to an edge RBridge, depending on the TRILL-EN configuration.\n

      of thousands of virtualized\n   servers, setting the TRILL boundary at the servers'
      virtual switches\n   will create a TRILL domain with hundreds of thousands of
      RBridge\n   nodes; this could lead to TRILL nickname exhaustion and challenges
      to\n   IS-IS.  On the other hand, setting the TRILL boundary at aggregation\n
      \  switches that have many virtualized servers attached can limit the\n   number
      of RBridge nodes in a TRILL domain, but introduces the issue\n   of having very
      large (MAC and VLAN) <-> Edge RBridge mapping tables\n   that need to be maintained
      by edge RBridges.\n   Allowing non-RBridge nodes to pre-encapsulate data frames
      with TRILL\n   headers makes it possible to have a TRILL domain with a reasonable\n
      \  number of RBridge nodes in a large data center.  All the TRILL-ENs\n   attached
      to one RBridge can be represented by one TRILL nickname,\n   which can avoid
      the nickname exhaustion problem.\n"

    - "5.2.  Reduce MAC Tables for Switches on Bridged LANs\n   When hosts in a VLAN
      (or subnet) span across multiple edge RBridges\n   and each edge RBridge has
      multiple VLANs enabled, the switches on the\n   bridged LANs attached to the
      edge RBridges are exposed to all MAC\n   addresses among all the VLANs enabled.\n
      \  For example, for an Access Switch with 40 physical servers attached,\n   where
      each server has 100 VMs, there are 4000 hosts under the Access\n   Switch.  If
      indeed hosts/VMs can be moved anywhere, the worst case\n   for the Access Switch
      is when all those 4000 VMs belong to different\n   VLANs, i.e., the Access Switch
      has 4000 VLANs enabled.  If each VLAN\n   has 200 hosts, this Access Switch's
      MAC table potentially has\n   200 * 4000 = 800,000 entries.\n   If the virtual
      switches on servers pre-encapsulate the data frames\n   destined for hosts attached
      to remote edge RBridges, the outer MAC\n   destination address of those TRILL-encapsulated
      data frames will be\n   the MAC address of a local RBridge edge, i.e., the ingress
      RBridge.\n   The switches on the local bridged LAN don't need to keep the MAC\n
      \  entries for remote hosts attached to other edge RBridges.\n   But the TRILL
      traffic from nodes attached to other RBridges is\n   decapsulated and has the
      true source and destination MACs.  One\n   simple way to prevent local bridges
      from learning remote hosts' MACs\n   and adding to their MAC tables, if that
      would be a problem, is to\n   disable this data-plane learning on local bridges.
      \ With the\n   assistance of a directory, the local bridges can be pre-configured\n
      \  with MAC addresses of local hosts.  The local bridges can always send\n   frames
      with unknown destination MAC addresses to the ingress RBridge.\n   In an environment
      where a large number of VMs are instantiated in one\n   server, the number of
      remote MAC addresses could be very large.  If\n   it is not feasible to disable
      learning and pre-configure MAC tables\n   for local bridges and all important
      traffic is IP, one effective\n   method to minimize local bridges' MAC table
      size is to use the\n   server's MAC address to hide MAC addresses of the attached
      VMs.  That\n   is, the server acting as an edge node uses its own MAC address
      in the\n   source MAC address field of the packets originated from a host (or\n
      \  VM).  When the Ethernet frame arrives at the target edge node (the\n   egress),
      the target edge node can send the packet to the\n   corresponding destination
      host based on the packet's IP address.\n   Very often, the target edge node
      communicates with the embedded VMs\n   via a Layer 2 virtual switch.  In this
      case, the target edge node can\n   construct the proper Ethernet header with
      the assistance of the\n   directory.  The information from the directory includes
      the proper\n   mapping of host IP to MAC.\n"

    any pull\n   directory client.  See Section 4 of [RFC8171].\n"
  title: 6.  Manageability Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   If the TRILL-ENs are not trusted, they can forge
    arbitrary ingress\n   and egress nicknames in the TRILL Headers of the TRILL Data
    packets\n   they construct.  With data-plane learning, decapsulating a TRILL Data\n
    \  packet at an egress RBridge associates the inner source MAC address\n   with
    the ingress nickname in the TRILL Header (assuming that MAC\n   address is unicast).
    \ Thus, if those ingress nicknames are forged,\n   incorrect learning will occur
    and future traffic destined for the\n   inner source MAC will be sent to the wrong
    RBridge for egress.\n   Because of this, an RBridge port should not be configured
    to accept\n   encapsulated TRILL data frames on a link were it does not have an\n
    \  RBridge adjacency unless the end stations on that link are trusted.\n   As
    with any end station, TRILL-ENs can forge the outer MAC addresses\n   of packets
    they send.  (See Section 6 of [RFC6325].) Because they\n   pre-encapsulate, they
    can also forge inner MAC addresses.\n   The pre-encapsulation performed by TRILL-ENs
    also means they can send\n   data in any VLAN; this means they must be trusted
    in order to enforce\n   a security policy based on VLANs.  (See Section 6.1 of
    [RFC6325].)\n   Use of directory-assisted encapsulation by TRILL-ENs essentially\n
    \  involves those TRILL-ENs spoofing edge RBridges to which they are\n   connected;
    this is another reason that TRILL-ENs should be trusted\n   nodes.  Such spoofing
    cannot cause persistently looping traffic\n   because TRILL has a hop count in
    the TRILL header [RFC6325] so that,\n   should there be a loop, a TRILL packet
    caught in that loop (i.e., an\n   encapsulated frame) will be discarded.  (In
    the potentially more\n   dangerous case of multidestination packets (as compared
    with known\n   unicast) where copies could multiply due to forks in the distribution\n
    \  tree, a Reverse Path Forwarding Check is also used [RFC6325] to\n   discard
    packets that appear to be on the wrong link or when there is\n   disagreement
    about the distribution tree.)\n   The mechanism described in this document requires
    a TRILL-EN to be\n   aware of the MAC address(es) of the TRILL edge RBridge(s)
    to which\n   the TRILL-EN is attached and the egress RBridge nickname from which\n
    \  the destination of the packets is reachable.  With that information,\n   TRILL-ENs
    can learn a substantial amount about the topology of the\n   TRILL domain.  Therefore,
    there could be a potential security risk\n   when the TRILL-ENs are not trusted
    or are compromised.\n   If the path between the directory and a TRILL-EN is attacked,
    false\n   mappings can be sent to the TRILL-EN causing packets from the TRILL-\n
    \  EN to be sent to wrong destinations, possibly violating security\n   policy
    as to which end stations should receive what data.  Therefore,\n   a combination
    of authentication and encryption is RECOMMENDED between\n   the directory and
    TRILL-EN.  The entities involved will need to\n   properly authenticate with each
    other, provide session encryption,\n   maintain security patch levels, and configure
    their systems to allow\n   minimal access and running processes to protect sensitive\n
    \  information.\n   For added security against the compromise of data due to its\n
    \  misdelivery for any reason, including the above, end-to-end\n   encryption
    and authentication should be considered; that is,\n   encryption and authentication
    from source end station to destination\n   end station.\n   For Pull Directory
    and TRILL ES-IS security considerations, see\n   [RFC8171].\n"
