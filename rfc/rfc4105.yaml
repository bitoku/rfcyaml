  - "1.  Introduction\n   The set of MPLS Traffic Engineering components, defined\
    \ in [RSVP-TE],\n   [OSPF-TE], and [ISIS-TE], which supports the requirements\
    \ defined in\n   [TE-REQ], is used today by many network operators to achieve\
    \ major\n   Traffic Engineering objectives defined in [TE-OVW].  These objectives\n\
    \   include:\n      - Aggregated Traffic measurement\n      - Optimization of\
    \ network resources utilization\n      - Support for services requiring end-to-end\
    \ QoS guarantees\n      - Fast recovery against link/node/Shared Risk Link Group\
    \ (SRLG)\n        failures\n   Furthermore, the applicability of MPLS to traffic\
    \ engineering in IP\n   networks is discussed in [TE-APP].\n   The set of MPLS\
    \ Traffic Engineering mechanisms, to date, has been\n   limited to use within\
    \ a single Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area.\n   This document discusses the\
    \ requirements for an inter-area MPLS\n   Traffic Engineering mechanism that may\
    \ be used to achieve the same\n   set of objectives across multiple IGP areas.\n\
    \   Basically, it would be useful to extend MPLS TE capabilities across\n   IGP\
    \ areas to support inter-area resources optimization, to provide\n   strict QoS\
    \ guarantees between two edge routers located within\n   distinct areas, and to\
    \ protect inter-area traffic against Area Border\n   Router (ABR) failures.\n\
    \   First, this document addresses current uses of MPLS Traffic\n   Engineering\
    \ within a single IGP area.  Then, it discusses a set of\n   functional requirements\
    \ that a solution must or should satisfy in\n   order to support inter-area MPLS\
    \ Traffic Engineering.  Because the\n   scope of requirements will vary between\
    \ operators, some requirements\n   will be mandatory (MUST), whereas others will\
    \ be optional (SHOULD).\n   Finally, a set of evaluation criteria for any solution\
    \ meeting these\n   requirements is given.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Intra-Area Resource Optimization\n   MPLS TE can be used within an area\
    \ to redirect paths of aggregated\n   flows away from over-utilized resources\
    \ within a network.  In a small\n   scale, this may be done by explicitly configuring\
    \ a path to be used\n   between two routers.  On a grander scale, a mesh of LSPs\
    \ can be\n   established between central points in a network.  LSPs paths can\
    \ be\n   defined statically in configuration or arrived at by an algorithm\n \
    \  that determines the shortest path given administrative constraints\n   such\
    \ as bandwidth.  In this way, MPLS TE allows for greater control\n   over how\
    \ traffic demands are routed over a network topology and\n   utilize a network's\
    \ resources.\n   Note also that TE LSPs allow measuring traffic matrix in a simple\
    \ and\n   scalable manner.  The aggregated traffic rate between two LSRs is\n\
    \   easily measured by accounting of traffic sent onto a TE LSP\n   provisioned\
    \ between the two LSRs in question.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Intra-Area QoS Guarantees
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Intra-Area QoS Guarantees\n   The DiffServ IETF working group has defined\
    \ a set of mechanisms\n   described in [DIFF-ARCH], [DIFF-AF], and [DIFF-EF] or\
    \ [MPLS-DIFF],\n   that can be activated at the edge of or over a DiffServ domain\
    \ to\n   contribute to the enforcement of a QoS policy (or set of policies),\n\
    \   which can be expressed in terms of maximum one-way transit delay,\n   inter-packet\
    \ delay variation, loss rate, etc.  Many Operators have\n   some or full deployment\
    \ of DiffServ implementations in their networks\n   today, either across the entire\
    \ network or at least at its edge.\n   In situations where strict QoS bounds are\
    \ required, admission control\n   inside the backbone of a network is in some\
    \ cases required in\n   addition to current DiffServ mechanisms.  When the propagation\
    \ delay\n   can be bounded, the performance targets, such as maximum one-way\n\
    \   transit delay, may be guaranteed by providing bandwidth guarantees\n   along\
    \ the DiffServ-enabled path.\n   MPLS TE can be simply used with DiffServ: in\
    \ that case, it only\n   ensures aggregate QoS guarantees for the whole traffic.\
    \  It can also\n   be more intimately combined with DiffServ to perform per-class\
    \ of\n   service admission control and resource reservation.  This requires\n\
    \   extensions to MPLS TE called DiffServ-Aware TE, which are defined in\n   [DSTE-PROTO].\
    \  DS-TE allows ensuring strict end-to-end QoS\n   guarantees.  For instance,\
    \ an EF DS-TE LSP may be provisioned between\n   voice gateways within the same\
    \ area to ensure strict QoS to VoIP\n   traffic.\n   MPLS TE allows computing\
    \ intra-area shortest paths, which satisfy\n   various constraints, including\
    \ bandwidth.  For the sake of\n   illustration, if the IGP metrics reflects the\
    \ propagation delay, it\n   allows finding a minimum propagation delay path, which\
    \ satisfies\n   various constraints, such as bandwidth.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Fast Recovery within an IGP Area\n   As quality-sensitive applications\
    \ are deployed, one of the key\n   requirements is to provide fast recovery mechanisms,\
    \ allowing traffic\n   recovery to be guaranteed on the order of tens of msecs,\
    \ in case of\n   network element failure.  Note that this cannot be achieved by\n\
    \   relying only on classical IGP rerouting.\n   Various recovery mechanisms can\
    \ be used to protect traffic carried\n   onto TE LSPs.  They are defined in [MPLS-RECOV].\
    \  Protection\n   mechanisms are based on the provisioning of backup LSPs that\
    \ are used\n   to recover traffic in case of failure of protected LSPs.  Among\
    \ those\n   protection mechanisms, local protection (also called Fast Reroute)\
    \ is\n   intended to achieve sub-50ms recovery in case of link/node/SRLG\n   failure\
    \ along the LSP path [FAST-REROUTE].  Fast Reroute is currently\n   used by many\
    \ operators to protect sensitive traffic inside an IGP\n   area.\n   [FAST-REROUTE]\
    \ defines two modes for backup LSPs.  The first, called\n   one-to-one backup,\
    \ consists of setting up one detour LSP per\n   protected LSP and per element\
    \ to protect.  The second, called\n   facility backup, consists of setting up\
    \ one or several bypass LSPs to\n   protect a given facility (link or node). \
    \ In case of failure, all\n   protected LSPs are nested into the bypass LSPs (benefiting\
    \ from the\n   MPLS label stacking property).\n"
- title: 4.3.  Intra-Area MPLS TE and Routing
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Intra-Area MPLS TE and Routing\n   There are several possibilities for\
    \ directing traffic into intra-area\n   TE LSPs:\n   1) Static routing to the\
    \ LSP destination address or any other\n      addresses.\n   2) IGP routes beyond\
    \ the LSP destination, from an IGP SPF perspective\n      (IGP shortcuts).\n \
    \  3) BGP routes announced by a BGP peer (or an MP-BGP peer) that is\n      reachable\
    \ through the TE LSP by means of a single static route to\n      the corresponding\
    \ BGP next-hop address (option 1) or by means of\n      IGP shortcuts (option\
    \ 2).  This is often called BGP recursive\n      routing.\n   4) The LSP can be\
    \ advertised as a link into the IGP to become part of\n      IGP database for\
    \ all nodes, and thus can be taken into account\n      during SPF for all nodes.\
    \  Note that, even if similar in concept,\n      this is different from the notion\
    \ of Forwarding-Adjacency, as\n      defined in [LSP-HIER].  Forwarding-Adjacency\
    \ is when the LSP is\n      advertised as a TE-link into the IGP-TE to become\
    \ part of the TE\n      database and taken into account in CSPF.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Inter-Area Traffic Engineering Problem Statement\n   As described in Section\
    \ 4, MPLS TE is deployed today by many\n   operators to optimize network bandwidth\
    \ usage, to provide strict QoS\n   guarantees, and to ensure sub-50ms recovery\
    \ in case of link/node/SRLG\n   failure.\n   However, MPLS-TE mechanisms are currently\
    \ limited to a single IGP\n   area.  The limitation comes more from the Routing\
    \ and Path\n   computation components than from the signaling component.  This\
    \ is\n   basically because the hierarchy limits topology visibility of head-\n\
    \   end LSRs to their IGP area, and consequently head-end LSRs can no\n   longer\
    \ run a CSPF algorithm to compute the shortest constrained path\n   to the tail-end,\
    \ as CSPF requires the whole topology to compute an\n   end-to-end shortest constrained\
    \ path.\n   Several operators have multi-area networks, and many operators that\n\
    \   are still using a single IGP area may have to migrate to a multi-area\n  \
    \ environment, as their network grows and single area scalability\n   limits are\
    \ approached.\n   Thus, those operators may require inter-area traffic engineering\
    \ to:\n   - Perform inter-area resource optimization.\n   - Provide inter-area\
    \ QoS guarantees for traffic between edge nodes\n     located in different areas.\n\
    \   - Provide fast recovery across areas, to protect inter-area traffic\n    \
    \ in case of link or node failure, including ABR node failures.\n   For instance,\
    \ an operator running a multi-area IGP may have voice\n   gateways located in\
    \ different areas.  Such VoIP transport requires\n   inter-area QoS guarantees\
    \ and inter-area fast protection.\n   One possible approach for inter-area traffic\
    \ engineering could\n   consist of deploying MPLS TE on a per-area basis, but\
    \ such an\n   approach has several limitations:\n   - Traffic aggregation at the\
    \ ABR levels implies some constraints that\n     do not lead to efficient traffic\
    \ engineering.  Actually, this per-\n     area TE approach might lead to sub-optimal\
    \ resource utilization, by\n     optimizing resources independently in each area.\
    \  What many\n     operators want is to optimize their resources as a whole; in\
    \ other\n     words, as if there was only one area (flat network).\n   - This\
    \ does not allow computing an inter-area constrained shortest\n     path and thus\
    \ does not ensure end-to-end QoS guarantees across\n     areas.\n   - Inter-area\
    \ traffic cannot be protected with local protection\n     mechanisms such as [FAST-REROUTE]\
    \ in case of ABR failure.\n   Therefore, existing MPLS TE mechanisms have to be\
    \ enhanced to support\n   inter-area TE LSPs.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Overview of Requirements for Inter-Area MPLS TE
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Overview of Requirements for Inter-Area MPLS TE\n   For the reasons mentioned\
    \ above, it is highly desired to extend the\n   current set of MPLS-TE mechanisms\
    \ across multiple IGP areas in order\n   to support the intra-area applications\
    \ described in Section 4 across\n   areas.\n   The solution MUST allow setting\
    \ up inter-area TE LSPs; i.e., LSPs\n   whose path crosses at least two IGP areas.\n\
    \   Inter-area MPLS-TE extensions are highly desired in order to provide:\n  \
    \ - Inter-area resources optimization.\n   - Strict inter-area QoS guarantees.\n\
    \   - Fast recovery across areas, particularly to protect inter-area\n     traffic\
    \ against ABR failures.\n   It may be desired to compute inter-area shortest paths\
    \ that satisfy\n   some bandwidth constraints or any other constraints, as is\
    \ currently\n   possible within a single IGP area.  For the sake of illustration,\
    \ if\n   the IGP metrics reflects the propagation delay, it may be necessary\n\
    \   to be able to find the optimal (shortest) path satisfying some\n   constraints\
    \ (e.g., bandwidth) across multiple IGP areas.  Such a path\n   would be the inter-area\

    \ the ability to compute inter-area\n   shortest paths satisfying a set of constraints\
    \ (i.e., bandwidth).\n"

- title: 5.3.1.  Preserving the IGP Hierarchy Concept
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Preserving the IGP Hierarchy Concept\n   The absence of a full link-state\
    \ topology database makes the\n   computation of an end-to-end optimal path by\
    \ the head-end LSR not\n   possible without further signaling and routing extensions.\
    \  There are\n   several reasons that network operators choose to break up their\n\
    \   network into different areas.  These often include scalability and\n   containment\
    \ of routing information.  The latter can help isolate most\n   of a network from\
    \ receiving and processing updates that are of no\n   consequence to its routing\
    \ decisions.  Containment of routing\n   information MUST not be compromised to\
    \ allow inter-area traffic\n   engineering.  Information propagation for path-selection\
    \ MUST\n   continue to be localized.  In other words, the solution MUST entirely\n\
    \   preserve the concept of IGP hierarchy.\n"
- title: 5.3.2.  Preserving Scalability
  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  Preserving Scalability\n   Achieving the requirements listed in this\
    \ document MUST be performed\n   while preserving the IGP scalability, which is\
    \ of the utmost\n   importance.  The hierarchy preservation objective addressed\
    \ in the\n   above section is actually an element to preserve IGP scalability.\n\
    \   The solution also MUST not increase IGP load unreasonably, which\n   could\
    \ compromise IGP scalability.  In particular, a solution\n   satisfying those\
    \ requirements MUST not require the IGP to carry some\n   unreasonable amount\
    \ of extra information and MUST not unreasonably\n   increase the IGP flooding\
    \ frequency.\n   Likewise, the solution MUST also preserve scalability of RSVP-TE\n\
    \   ([RSVP-TE]).\n   Additionally, the base specification of MPLS TE is architecturally\n\
    \   structured and relatively devoid of excessive state propagation in\n   terms\
    \ of routing or signaling.  Its strength in extensibility can\n   also be seen\
    \ as an Achilles heel, as there is no real limit to what\n   is possible with\
    \ extensions.  It is paramount to maintain\n   architectural vision and discretion\
    \ when adapting it for use for\n   inter-area MPLS TE.  Additional information\
    \ carried within an area or\n   propagated outside of an area (via routing or\
    \ signaling) should be\n   neither excessive, patchwork, nor non-relevant.\n \
    \  Particularly, as mentioned in Section 5.2, it may be desired for some\n   inter-area\
    \ TE LSP carrying highly sensitive traffic to compute a\n   shortest inter-area\
    \ path, satisfying a set of constraints such as\n   bandwidth.  This may require\
    \ an additional routing mechanism, as base\n   CSPF at head-end can no longer\
    \ be used due to the lack of topology\n   and resource information.  Such a routing\
    \ mechanism MUST not\n   compromise the scalability of the overall system.\n"

- title: 7.7.  Support of Diversely-Routed Inter-Area TE LSPs
  contents:
  - "7.7.  Support of Diversely-Routed Inter-Area TE LSPs\n   There are several cases\
    \ where the ability to compute diversely-routed\n   TE-LSP paths may be desirable.\
    \  For instance, in the case of LSP\n   protection, primary and backup LSPs should\
    \ be diversely routed.\n   Another example is the requirement to set up multiple\
    \ diversely-\n   routed TE LSPs between a pair of LSRs residing in different IGP\n\
    \   areas.  For instance, when a single TE LSP satisfying the bandwidth\n   constraint\
    \ cannot be found between two end-points, a solution would\n   consist of setting\
    \ up multiple TE LSPs so that the sum of their\n   bandwidth satisfy the bandwidth\

    \ routed in order to minimize\n   the impact of a failure, on the traffic between\

    \ to determine an\n   optimal placement.  For instance, the placement of two diversely\n\

    \ cumulative cost.  The placement of two diversely-routed LSPs\n   for protection\
    \ purposes may consist of minimizing the cost of the\n   primary LSP while bounding\

    \ to reoptimize an inter-area\n   TE LSP locally within an area; i.e., while retaining\
    \ the same set of\n   transit ABRs.  The reoptimization process in that case MAY\
