  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   1.1 The Internet Domain Name System\n   The Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) provides for the translation between\n   host names and addresses.  Within\
    \ the Internet, this means\n   translating from a name such as \"venera.isi.edu\"\
    , to an IP address\n   such as \"128.9.0.32\".  The DNS is a set of protocols\
    \ and databases.\n   The protocols define the syntax and semantics for a query\
    \ language to\n   ask questions about information located by DNS-style names.\
    \  The\n   databases are distributed and replicated.  There is no dependence on\n\
    \   a single central server, and each part of the database is provided in\n  \
    \ at least two servers.\n   The assignment of the 32-bit IP addresses is a separate\
    \ activity.  IP\n   addresses are assigned by the Network Information Center\n\
    \   (Hostmaster@NIC.DDN.MIL).\n   In addition to translating names to addresses\
    \ for hosts that are on\n   the Internet, the DNS provides for registering DNS-style\
    \ names for\n   other hosts reachable (via electronic mail) through gateways or\
    \ mail\n   relays.  The records for such name registration point to an Internet\n\
    \   host (one with an IP address) that acts as a mail forwarder for the\n   registered\
    \ host.  For example, the host \"bah.rochester.ny.us\" is\n   registered in the\
    \ DNS with a pointer to the mail relay\n   \"relay1.uu.net\".  This type of pointer\
    \ is called an MX record.\n   This gives electronic mail users a uniform mail\
    \ addressing syntax and\n   avoids making users aware of the underlying network\
    \ boundaries.\n   The reason for the development of the domain system was growth\
    \ in the\n   Internet.  The host name to address mappings were maintained by the\n\
    \   Network Information Center (NIC) in a single file, called HOSTS.TXT,\n   which\
    \ was FTPed by all the hosts on the Internet.  The network\n   population was\
    \ changing in character.  The timeshared hosts that made\n   up the original ARPANET\
    \ were being replaced with local networks of\n   workstations.  Local organizations\
    \ were administering their own names\n   and addresses, but had to wait for the\
    \ NIC to make changes in\n   HOSTS.TXT to make the changes visible to the Internet\
    \ at large.\n   Organizations also wanted some local structure on the name space.\n\
    \   The applications on the Internet were getting more sophisticated and\n   creating\
    \ a need for general purpose name service.  The idea of a\n   hierarchical name\
    \ space, with the hierarchy roughly corresponding to\n   organizational structure,\
    \ and names using \".\" as the character to\n   mark the boundary between hierarcy\
    \ levels.  A design using a\n   distributed database and generalized resources\
    \ was implemented.\n   The domain system provides standard formats for resource\
    \ data,\n   standard methods for querying the database, and standard methods for\n\
    \   name servers to refresh local data from other name servers.\n   1.2  Top-Level\
    \ Domains\n   The top-level domains in the DNS are EDU, COM, GOV, MIL, ORG, INT,\n\
    \   and NET, and all the 2-letter country codes from the list of\n   countries\
    \ in ISO-3166.\n   Even though the intention was that any educational institution\
    \ any\n   where in the world could be registered under the EDU domain, in\n  \
    \ practice it has turned out with few exceptions only those in the\n   United\
    \ States have registered under EDU, similiary with COM (for\n   commercial). In\
    \ other countries, everything is registered under the\n   2-letter country code,\
    \ often with some subdivision.  For example, in\n   Korea (KR) the second level\
    \ names are AC for academic community, CO\n   for commercial, GO for government,\
    \ and RE for research.  However each\n   country may go it's own way about organizing\
    \ its domain, and many\n   have.\n   Their are no plans of putting all of the\
    \ organizational domains .EDU\n    .GOV .COM etc., under .US.\n   However, there\
    \ are some states registered in the .GOV domain (11 by 2\n   letter code), and\
    \ 3 by full names)\n           ca.gov          la.gov          ohio.gov      \
    \  va.gov\n           co.gov          md.gov          or.gov          wa.gov\n\
    \           hawaii.gov      nc.gov          sc.gov\n           ia.gov        \
    \  ny.gov          texas.gov\n   Other names sometimes appear as top-level domain\
    \ names.  Some people\n   have made up names in the DNS style without coordinating\
    \ or\n   registering  with the DNS management.  Some names that typically\n  \
    \ appear are \".BITNET\", \".UUCP\", and two-letter codes for continents,\n  \
    \ such as \".NA\" for North America (this conflicts with the official\n   Internet\
    \ code for Namibia).\n   For example, the DNS style name \"KA7EEJ.CO.USA.NA\"\
    \ is used in the\n   amateur radio network.  These addresses are never supposed\
    \ to show up\n   on the Internet but they do occasionally.  The amateur radio\
    \ network\n   people created their own naming scheme, and it interferes sometimes\n\
    \   with Internet addresses.\n   1.3  The US Domain\n   The US Domain is an official\
    \ top-level domain in the DNS of the\n   Internet community.  It is registered\
    \ with the Network Information\n   Center.  The domain administrators are Jon\
    \ Postel and Ann Westine\n   Cooper at the Information Sciences Institute of the\
    \ University of\n   Southern California (USC-ISI).\n   US is the ISO-3166 2-letter\
    \ country code for the United States and\n   thus the US Domain is established\
    \ as a top-level domain and\n   registered with the NIC the same way other country\
    \ domains are.\n   Because organizations in the United States have registered\
    \ primarily\n   in the EDU and COM domains, little use was initially made of the\
    \ US\n   domain.\n   In the past, the computers registered in the US Domain were\
    \ primarily\n   owned by small companies or individuals with computers at home.\n\
    \   However, the US Domain has grown and currently registers hosts in\n   federal\
    \ government agencies, state government agencies, K12 schools,\n   community colleges,\
    \ private schools, libraries, county agencies, and\n   city utilities, to name\
    \ a few.\n   The administration of the US Domain was managed solely by the Domain\n\
    \   Registrar in the past.  However, due to the increase of hosts,\n   administration\
    \ of subdomains is being delegated to others.\n   Any computer in the United States\
    \ may be registered in the US Domain.\n"
- title: 2. NAMING STRUCTURE
  contents:
  - "2. NAMING STRUCTURE\n   The US Domain hierarchy is based on political geography.\
    \  The\n   namespace under .US is the state namespace, then the city namespace,\n\
    \   then organization or computer name and so on.\n   For example:\n         \
    \ SPK.WA.US\n         VANC.WA.US\n   There is of course no problem with running\
    \ out of names.\n   The things that are named are individual computers.\n   If\
    \ you register now in one city and then move, the database can be\n   updated\
    \ with a new name in your new city, and a pointer can be set up\n   from your\
    \ old name to your new name.  This type of pointer is called\n   a CNAME record.\n\
    \   The use of un-registered names is not effective and causes problems\n   for\
    \ other users.  Inventing your own name and using it without\n   registering is\
    \ not a good idea.\n   2.1  State Codes\n   The state codes are the two letter\
    \ US Postal abbreviations.\n   2.2  City Codes or Locality Names\n   Cities may\
    \ be named (designated) by their full name (spelled out with\n   hyphens replacing\
    \ spaces (e.g., Los-Angeles or New-York)), or by a\n   city code.  The first choice\
    \ is the full city name, the second choice\n   is the city codes from Western\
    \ Union's \"City Mnemonics\" list, and a\n   third choice is a code for your city\
    \ chosen by the applicant.\n   However, it is very desirable that all users in\
    \ the same city use the\n   same designator for the city.\n   Abbreviated city\
    \ names are a good idea, particularly when the city\n   name is long, as there\
    \ is much to type already.  One of the problems\n   is that the city codes in\
    \ the Western Union City Mnemonics list are\n   sometimes not very good abbreviations.\
    \  Users sometimes tend to\n   prefer abbreviations that are commonly used already\
    \ from that region.\n   Such as SF for San Francisco, MPK for Menlo Park.\n  \
    \ Exceptions have been made in the abbreviations, even though this\n   causes\
    \ extra work to keep track of these abbreviations.  One\n   abbreviation for one\
    \ city.  Applicants are told what codes are\n   currently in use, however, if\
    \ a city code is not used yet, and they\n   would prefer to use a different code\
    \ that is more common among the\n   natives, then the new code is allowed.  However,\
    \ once it's\n   registered, then everyone else who registers in that city will\
    \ have\n   to use that code or spell out the full city name.\n   Some applicants\
    \ have tried to get a copy of the Western Union City\n   Mnemonics code list but\
    \ it is no longer available from Western Union.\n   However, we do have a copy\
    \ but it is not online. If you are\n   requesting an abbreviated city code please\
    \ let us know and we will\n   gladly look it up for you.\n   2.3  Examples of\
    \ Names\n   For small entities like individuals or small businesses there is\n\
    \   usually no problem with selecting locality based names.\n         For example:\
    \  Zuckys.Santa-Monica.CA.US\n   For large entities like large corporations with\
    \ multiple facilities\n   in several cities or states this often seems like a\
    \ unreasonable\n   constraint (especially when compared with the alternative of\n\
    \   registering directly in the .COM domain).  However, a company does\n   have\
    \ a headquarters office in a particular locality and so could\n   register with\
    \ that name.\n         For example:  IBM.Armonk.NY.US\n             EXAMPLES OF\

    \   categories, such as:\n                   K12.<state>.US   =   kindegarten\
    \ thru 12th grade\n                    CC.<state>.US   =   community colleges\n\

    \   =   state government agencies\n                <org-name>.FED.US   =   federal\
    \ government agencies\n   The Appendix-I contains the current US Domain Names\
    \ BNF, but in\n   actuality, the names under these subdomains may vary according\
    \ to the\n   decision of the administrators of these subdomains.\n   Some users\
    \ would like names associated with a greater metropolitan\n   area or region like\
    \ the \"Bay Area\" or \"Tri-Cities\".  One problem with\n   this is that these\
    \ names are not necessarily unique within a state.\n   The best thing to do in\
    \ this case is to use the larger metropolitan\n   city in your host name.  Cities\
    \ and in some cases counties are used.\n"

  - "3. REGISTRATION\n   3.1  Requirements\n   Anyone requesting to register a host\
    \ in the US Domain is sent a copy\n   of the US Domain policy and procedure, and\
    \ must fill out a US Domain\n   questionnaire.\n   The US Domain template, is\
    \ similar to the NIC Domain template\n   however, it is not the same.  To request\
    \ a copy of the US Domain\n   questionnaire, send a message to the US Domain registrar\
    \ (us-\n   domain@isi.edu).\n      Note:  If you are registering a name in a delegated\
    \ zone\n             (see Section 3.3.6).  Please register with the\n        \
    \     contact for that zone.\n   The key people must have electronic mailboxes\
    \ (that work).  Please\n   provide all the information indicated in the \"Administrator\"\
    \ and\n   \"Technical Contact\" slot.  This person will be the point of contact\n\
    \   for any administrative and policy questions about the domain.\n   The administrator\
    \ is usually the person who manages the organization\n   being registered. The\
    \ technical contact can also be administrator, or\n   the systems person, or someone\
    \ who is familiar with the technical\n   details of the Internet. The technical\
    \ contact should have a valid\n   working e-mail address. This is necessary in\
    \ case something goes\n   wrong.\n   It is important that your \"Return-Path\"\
    \ and \"From\" field indicate an\n   Internet style address.  UUCP style addresses\
    \ such as \"host1!user\"\n   will not work. This is fine within the UUCP world,\
    \ but not the\n   Internet.  If you want people on the Internet to be able to\
    \ send mail\n   to you, your return path needs to be an Internet style address:\
    \ such\n   as host1!user@internet.gateway.host or user@internet.gateway.host.\n\
    \   It is also possible to register through one of the Internet service\n   providers\
    \ that have established working relationships with the US\n   domain administrator.\n\
    \   If everything checks out, turn around time for registering a host is\n   usually\
    \ a day or two.  The nameservers are updated anywhere from 12\n   to 24 hours\
    \ later.\n   There are two ways to be registered in the US Domain, directly, or\
    \ by\n   delegation.\n   3.2  Direct Entries\n   Direct entry in the database\
    \ of the US Domain appeals most to\n   individuals and small companies.  Fill\
    \ out the application and send\n   it directly to the US Domain administrator.\
    \  If you are in an area\n   where the zone is delegated to someone else your\
    \ request will be\n   forwarded to the zone administrator for your registration.\n\
    \   3.2.1 UUCP Hosts\n   Many applicants have hosts in the UUCP world.  Some are\
    \ one hop away,\n   some two and three hops away from their \"Internet Forwarder\"\
    , this is\n   ok.  What is important is getting an Internet host to be your\n\
    \   forwarder.  If you do not already have an Internet forwarder, there\n   are\
    \ several businesses that provide this service for a fee, such as\n   UUNET.UU.NET\
    \ (postmaster@uunet.uu.net), PSI (postmaster@UU2.PSI.COM)\n   and CERFNET (help@cerf.net).\
    \  Sometimes local colleges in your area\n   are already on the Internet and may\
    \ be willing to act as an Internet\n   Forwarder.  You would need to work this\
    \ out with the systems\n   administrator we cannot make these arrangements for\
    \ you.\n   Although we work with UUCP service providers, the Internet US Domain\n\
    \   registration is not affiliated with the registration of UUCP Map\n   entries.\
    \  The UUCP map entry does not provide us with sufficient\n   information.  If\
    \ you do not have a copy of the US Domain\n   questionnaire template, please send\
    \ a message to: us-domain@isi.edu\n   and request one.  See Appendix-II.\n   This\
    \ is not an appropriate registration for the US Domain.\n     #N starl\n     #S\

    \ as a central site for a USENET group\n   where other UUCP sites will feed from\
    \ you, that's fine.  These UUCP\n   sites do not need to register.  If however,\
    \ the other sites become a\n   subdomain of your hostname, then we will need to\
    \ register them\n   individually or add a wildcard record.\n           For example:\
    \          bah.rochester.ny.us\n                           host1.bah.rochester.ny.us\n\

    \   To use US Domain names for non-IP hosts, there must be a forwarder\n   host\
    \ that is an IP host.  There must be an adminstrative agreement\n   and a technical\
    \ procedure for relaying mail between the non-IP host\n   and the forwarder host.\n\
    \   Case 1:\n   -------\n   Your host is not an IP host but does talk directly\
    \ with a host that\n   is an IP host.\n                                      \
    \            +-----------------+\n   +----------+            +---------+     \
    \       |                 |\n   |your-host |---UUCP-----|forwarder|----IP/TCP--|\
    \    INTERNET     |\n   +----------+            +---------+            |     \
    \            |\n                                                  +-----------------+\n\
    \   \"Forwarder\" must be an IP host on the Internet.\n   You must ask \"forwarder\"\
    \ if they are willing to be the internet\n   forwarder for \"your-host\".\n  \
    \ In the US Domain of the DNS data base there must be an entry like\n   this:\n\
    \          \"your-host\"  MX  10  \"forwarder\"\n   This must be entered by the\

    Forwarder\" must be an IP host on the internet.\n   You must ask \"forwarder\"\
    \ if they are willing to be the Internet\n   Forwarder for \"Your-Host\".  You\
    \ must ask \"path-host\" to relay your\n   mail.\n   In the US Domain of the DNS\
    \ DataBase there must be an entry like this:\n          \"your-host\"  MX  10\
    \  \"forwarder\"\n   This must be entered by the US Domain Administrator.\n  \
    \ In the \"forwarder\" routing tables there must be information about\n   \"your-host\"\
    \ with a rule like: If I see mail for \"your-host\" I will\n   send it via UUCP\
    \ to \"path-host\" by calling phone number \"123-4567\".\n   and \"path-host\"\
    \ must also know how to relay the mail to \"your-host\".\n   Note: It is assumed\
    \ that \"path-host\" is already MXed to \"forwarder\".\n   It is not appropriate\
    \ to ask to MX \"your-host\" to \"path-host\" (this\n   is sometimes called double\
    \ MXing).  The host on the right hand side\n   of an MX entry must be a host on\
    \ the Internet with an IP address\n   (e.g., 128.9.2.32).\n   3.3  Delegated Subdomains\n\
    \   The administrator of the US Domain is responsible for the assignment\n   of\
    \ all the DNS names that end with \".US\".  Of course, one person or\n   even\
    \ one group can't handle all this in the long run so portions of\n   the name\
    \ space are delegated to others.\n   Delegation of cities, companies within cities,\
    \ schools (K12),\n   community colleges (CC), libraries (LIB), state government\
    \ (STATE),\n   and federal government agencies, departments, etc., is acceptable\
    \ and\n   practical.\n   For a delegated portion of the namespace, for example\
    \ a city, no\n   alterations can be made to that name, no abbreviations added,\
    \ etc.\n   unless applied for.\n   Sometimes there may be two people running name\
    \ servers in the same\n   city because different portions of the name space has\
    \ been delegated\n   to them.  For example, someone may be delegated the <city>.<state>.US\n\
    \   name space, and someone else from a state government agency may have\n   the\
    \ .STATE.<state>.US, portion.  For example, Fred may run the name\n   servers\
    \ for Sacramento.CA.US and Joe may run the name servers for\n   STATE.CA.US in\
    \ Sacramento.\n   If a company would like to have wildcard records added, or run\
    \ their\n   own name servers in a city that we have delegated name space to, this\n\
    \   is ok.\n   Delegation of the whole State namespace is not yet implemented.\
    \  The\n   delegated part of the name space is in the form of:\n             \
    \       .STATE.<state>.US.\n                      .K12.<state>.US.\n         \
    \              .CC.<state>.US.\n                      .LIB.<state>.US.\n     \
    \   .<org-name>.<city>.<state>.US.\n         .CITY.<city-name>.<state>.US.\n \
    \                  .<org-name>.FED.US.\n   3.3.1  Schools\n   As schools begin\
    \ to join the Internet, there ought to be a consistent\n   scheme for naming them.\
    \  A \"K12\" name branch has been established in\n   each state in the US Domain\
    \ for this purpose.\n   Public schools are usually organized by districts which\
    \ can be larger\n   or smaller than a city or county.\n   It makes sense to name\
    \ schools within districts.  However districts\n   often have the same name as\
    \ a city or county so there has to be a way\n   to distinguish a public school\
    \ district name from some other type of\n   locality name.  The keyword \"K12\"\
    \ is used for this.\n   In some districts, the same school name is used at different\
    \ levels,\n   for example, Washington Elementary School and Washington High School.\n\
    \   We suggest that when necessary the keywords \"Elementary\", \"Middle\",\n\
    \   and \"High\" be used to distinguish these schools.  These keywords\n   would\
    \ only be used when they are needed, if the school's name is\n   unique without\
    \ such keywords don't use them.\n   Typical K12 school names currently used are\
    \ like:\n              IVY.PRS.K12.NJ.US\n              DMHS.JCPS.K12.KY.US\n\
    \              OHS.EUNION.K12.CA.US\n              BOHS.BREA.K12.CA.US\n   These\
    \ names could be long.  Given the large number of schools,\n   organizing by school\
    \ district and state seems appropriate.  When\n   there are many things to name\
    \ some of the names must be long.\n   In some cases there may be appropriate abbreviations\
    \ that can be\n   used.  For example Hamilton High School in Los Angeles could\
    \ be:\n              Hami.Hi.LA.K12.CA.US\n      Some School Examples:\n     \
    \ ---------------------\n      Hamilton.High.LA-Unified.K12.CA.US        <== a\
    \ public school\n      Sherman-Oaks.Elem.LA-Unified.K12.CA.US    <== a public\
    \ school\n      John-Muir.Middle.Santa-Monica.K12.CA.US   <== a public school\n\
    \      Crossroads-School.Santa-Monica.CA.US      <== a private school\n      SMCC.CC.CA.US\
    \                             <== a community college\n      Northridge.CSU.STATE.CA.US\
    \                <== a state university\n   If a school has a bunch of PCs, then\
    \ each PC should have a name.\n   Suppose they are named \"alpha\", \"beta\",\
    \ ... then if they belong to a\n   school named \"Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US\"\
    \ their names would be:\n                alpha.Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US.\n\
    \                beta.Lincoln.High.Lakewood.K12.CA.US\n           ...\n   3.2.2\
    \  State Agencies\n   US Domain namespace has been delegated to the state goverment\n\
    \   agencies.  For example, in the State of Minnesota, the subdomain is\n   STATE.MN.US\n\
    \   This means that the person running the namservers for state.mn.us are\n  \
    \ responsible for naming agencies, of the state govermnent.  For\n   example:\n\
    \      State Agencies:\n      ---------------\n      Senate.STATE.MN.US      <==\
    \ State Senate\n      MDH.STATE.MN.US         <== Dept. of Health\n      CALTRANS.STATE.CA.US\
    \    <== Dept. of Transportation\n      DMV.STATE.CA.US         <== Dept. of Motor\
    \ Vehicles\n   3.3.3  Federal Agencies\n   A federal namespace has been delegated\
    \ to the federal government\n   agencies.  For example the subdomain for the Federal\
    \ Reserve Bank of\n   Minneapolis is MNPL.FRB.FED.US. Other examples are listed\
    \ below.\n      Federal Government Agencies:\n      ---------------------------\n\
    \      Senate.FED.US   <====  US Senate\n      DOD.FED.US      <====  US Defense\
    \ Dept.\n      USPS.FED.US     <====  US Postal Service\n      VA.FED.US     \
    \  <====  US Veterans Administration\n      IRS.FED.US      <====  US Internal\
    \ Revenue Service\n      Yosemite.NPS.Interior.FED.US    <====  A Federal agency\n\
    \   3.3.4  Delegation Requirements\n   When a subdomain is delegated, the following\
    \ requirements must be\n   met:\n      1)  There must be a knowledgeable and competent\
    \ technical contact,\n          familiar with the Internet Domain Name System.\
    \  This\n          requirement is easily satisified if the technical contact\n\
    \          already runs some other nameservers.\n      2)  Organizations requesting\
    \ delegations must provide at least two\n          independent (robust and reliable)\
    \ DNS name servers in\n          physically separate locations on the Internet.\n\
    \      3)  The subdomain must accept all applicants on an equal basis.\n     \
    \ 4)  The subdomain must provide timely processing of requests.  To\n        \
    \  do this it is helpful to have several individuals\n          knowledgeable\
    \ about the procedures so that the operations are\n          not delayed due to\
    \ one persons unavailability (for example by\n          being on vacation).\n\
    \   3.3.5  Delegation Procedures\n   The procedure that is followed when a subdomain\
    \ is delegated includes\n   the following steps:\n      1)  Evaluate the technical\
    \ contact's experience with DNS.  Make\n          sure there is a need for the\
    \ proposed delegation.  Make sure\n          the technical contact has the information\
    \ about the US Domain\n          and the suggested naming structure.\n      2)\
    \  Note: In the past there was the concept of a \"coordinator\" for\n        \
    \  a group or a club or \"Domain Park\". They would arrange to\n          coordinate\
    \ the registration of all the computers used by\n          members of the club\
    \ and forward all the information for the\n          group to the US Domain Administrator.\
    \  Most coordinators have\n          moved into the position of administrator\
    \ of that now delegated\n          subdomain.\n      3)  Add the new technical\
    \ contact to the \"us-dom-adm\" mailing list\n          for distributing updates\
    \ to the US Domain policies and\n          procedures, or other pertinent information.\n\
    \      4)  Delete any hosts from our zone file that belongs in the newly\n   \
    \       delegated subdomain and make sure they now have the hosts in\n       \
    \   their zone file.\n      5)  Send them a copy of the zone file so their initial\
    \ zone file\n          is identical to ours. For example:\n            mil.wi.us.\
    \   86400   SOA spool.mu.edu. manager.spool.mu.edu. (\n                      \

    \  showing the name, address, e-mail, and phone number of the\n          technical\
    \ contact for the delegated subdomain and the name of\n          the delegated\

    \      7)  Check to see that delegated subdomain name servers are up and\n   \
    \       running, and make sure the delegated hosts are installed in\n        \
    \  their zone file.  Now delete any hosts from the US Domain zone\n          file\
    \ that belongs in the newly delegated subdomain.\n      8)  Inform the technical\
    \ contact of the newly delegated subdomain\n          that wildcard records are\
    \ allowed in the zone file under the\n          organizational subdomain but no\
    \ wildcard records are allowed\n          under the \"city\" or \"state\" domain.\n\
    \   3.3.6   Subdomain Contacts\n   Approximately 680 individual hosts are registered,\

  - "4. DATABASE INFORMATION\n   4.1. Name Servers\n   Name servers are the repositories\
    \ of information that make up the\n   domain database.  The database is divided\
    \ up into sections called\n   zones, which are distributed among the name servers.\
    \  While name\n   servers can have several optional functions and sources of data,\
    \ the\n   essential task of a name server is to answer queries using data in\n\
    \   its zones.  The response to a query can always be generated using\n   only\
    \ local data, and either contains the answer to the question or a\n   referral\
    \ to other name servers \"closer\" to the desired information.\n   A given zone\
    \ will be available from several name servers to insure\n   its availability in\
    \ spite of host or communication link failure.\n   Every zone is required to be\
    \ available on at least two servers, and\n   many zones have more redundancy than\
    \ that.\n   The US Domain is currently supported by six name servers.\n      \
    \     venera.isi.edu\n           ns.isi.edu\n           ns.hercules.csl.sri.com\n\
    \           nnsc.nsf.net\n           ns.uu.net\n           adm.brl.mil\n   4.2\
    \ Zone Files\n   A \"zone\" is a registry of domains kept by a particular organization.\n\
    \   A zone registry is \"authoritative\", that is, the master copy of the\n  \
    \ registry is kept by the zone organization, and this copy is, by\n   definition,\
    \ always up-to-date.  Copies of this registry may be\n   distributed to other\
    \ places and kept in caches, but these caches are\n   not authoritative, and may\
    \ be out-of-date.\n   Every zone has at least one node, and hence domain name,\
    \ for which it\n   is authoritative, and all of the nodes in a particular zone\
    \ are\n   connected.  Given the tree structure, every zone has a highest node\n\
    \   which is closer to the root than any other node in the zone.  The\n   name\
    \ of this node is often used to identify the zone.  The data that\n   describes\
    \ a zone has four major parts:\n        1) Authoritative data for all nodes within\
    \ the zone.\n        2) Data that defines the top node of the zone\n         \
    \  (can be thought of as part of the authoritative data).\n        3) Data that\
    \ describes delegated subzones, i.e., cuts\n           around the bottom of the\
    \ zone,\n        4) Data that allows access to name servers for subzones\n   \
    \        (sometimes called \"glue\" data).\n   The zone administrator has to maintain\
    \ the zones at all the\n   namservers which are authoritative for the zone.  When\
    \ the changes\n   are made they must be distributed to all of the name servers.\n\
    \   Copies of the zone files are not available unless you are on the\n   Internet.\
    \  To look at the zone files use the \"dig\" program of the DNS\n   domain name\
    \ system.\n        dig   @nshost  host-your-checking  axfr\n   4.3 Resource Records\n\
    \   Records in the zone data files are called resource records (RRs).\n   The\
    \ standard Resource records (RR) are specified in STD 13, RFC 1034\n   and STD\
    \ 13, RFC 1035 (3,4).  An RR has a standard format as shown.\n               \
    \   <name> [<ttl>] [<class>] <type> <data>\n   The first field is always the name\
    \ of the domain record.  The second\n   field is an optional time to live field.\
    \  This specifies how long\n   this data will be stored in the data base.  The\
    \ third field is the\n   address class; the class field specifies the protocol\
    \ group most\n   often this is the Internet class \"IN\".  The fourth field states\
    \ the\n   type of the resource record.  The fields after that are dependent on\n\
    \   the Type of RR. The fifth field is the data field which is defined\n   differently\
    \ for each type and class of data.  Here is a list of the\n   current commonly\
    \ used types.\n           SOA     Start of Authority\n           NS      Name\
    \ Server\n           A       Internet Address\n           CNAME   Canonical Name\
    \ (nickname pointer)\n           HINFO   Host Information\n           WKS    \
    \ Well Known Services\n           MX      Mail Exchanger\n           PTR     Pointer\n\
    \   What do the fields mean?\n           foo.LA.CA.US.    604800    MX   10  \
    \   Venera.ISI.EDU.\n           (1)              (2)       (3)  (4)    (5)\n \
    \          1)  domain name\n           2)  time to live information\n        \
    \   3)  mail exchanger record\n           4)  preference value to determine (if\
    \ more than one\n               forwarder) which mailer to use first, lower number\n\
    \               higher preference\n           5)  the Internet forwarding host.\n\
    \   4.3.1  A Records\n   Internet (IP) Address.  The data for an \"A\" record\
    \ is an Internet\n   address in a dotted decimal form.  A sample \"A\" record\
    \ might look\n   like:\n           venera.isi.edu.          A      128.9.0.32\n\
    \              (name)               (A)     (address)\n   The name field is the\
    \ machine name, and the address is the network\n   address. There should be only\
    \ one \"A\" record for each address of a\n   host.\n   4.3.2  CNAME Records\n\
    \   Canonical Name resource record, CNAME, specifies an alias for a\n   canonical\
    \ name. This is essentially a pointer to the official name\n   for the requested\
    \ name.  All other RRs appear under this official\n   name.  A machine named FERNWOOD.MPK.CA.US\
    \ may want to have the\n   nickname ANTERIOR.MPK.CA.US.  In that case, the following\
    \ RR would be\n   used:\n           anterior.mpk.ca.us.     CNAME      fernwood.mpk.ca.us.\n\
    \            (alias nickname)                   (canonical name)\n   Nicknames\
    \ (the name associated with the RR is the nickname) may be\n   added for awhile\
    \ when a host changes its name, usually because it\n   moves to another state.\
    \  It helps to have this CNAME pointer so if\n   any mail comes to the old address\
    \ it will get forwarded to the new\n   one.  There cannot be any other RRs associated\
    \ with a nickname of the\n   same class.\n   4.3.3  MX Records\n   Mail Exchanger\
    \ records, MX, are used to specify a machine that knows\n   how to deliver mail\
    \ to a machine that is not directly connected to\n   the Internet.  For example,\
    \ venera.isi.edu is the mail gateway that\n   knows how to deliver mail to foo.la.ca.us,\
    \ but other machines on the\n   network cannot deliver mail directly to foo.la.ca.us.\
    \  These two\n   machines may have a private connection or use a different transport\n\
    \   medium (such as uucp).  The preference value (10) is the order that a\n  \
    \ mailer should follow when there is more than one way to deliver mail\n   to\
    \ a single machine.  The lower the number the higher the preference.\n       \
    \    foo.LA.CA.US.  604800  MX  10  Venera.ISI.EDU.\n           foo.LA.CA.US.\
    \  604800  MX  20  relay1.uu.net.\n   4.3.4   HINFO Records\n   Host information\
    \ resource records, HINFO is for host specific data.\n   This lists the hardware\
    \ and operating system that are running at the\n   listed host.  It should be\
    \ noted that a space separates the hardware\n   information and the operating\
    \ system information.  If you want to\n   include a space in the machine name\
    \ you must quote the name.  Host\n   information is not specific to any class,\
    \ so ANY may be used for the\n   address class.  There should be one HINFO record\
    \ for each host.\n   acb.la.ca.us.       HINFO       VAX-11/780      UNIX\n  \
    \                                 (Hardware)      (Operating System)\n   The official\
    \ HINFO types can be found in the latest Assigned Numbers\n   RFC, the most recent\
    \ edition being RFC 1340.  The hardware type is\n   called the Machine Name, and\
    \ the software type is called the System\n   Name.\n   The information users supply\
    \ about this is often inconsistent or\n   incomplete.  Please follow the terms\
    \ in the current \"Assigned\n   Numbers\".\n   4.3.5  PTR Records\n   A Domain\
    \ Name Pointer record, PTR, allows special names to point to\n   some other location\
    \ in the domain data base.  These are typically\n   used in setting up reverse\
    \ pointers for the special IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   domain.  PTR names should be unique\
    \ to the zone.\n         0.0.9.128.in-addr.arpa     PTR    isi-net.isi.edu.\n\
    \             (special name)                  (real name)\n   A PTR record is\
    \ to be added to the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain for every A\n   record registered in\
    \ the US Domain.  These PTR records need to be\n   added by the administrator\
    \ of the network where the host is\n   connected.  The US Domain administration\
    \ does not administer the\n   network and cannot make these entries in the DNS\
    \ database.\n   4.4  Wildcards\n   The wildcard records are of the form \"*.<anydomain>\"\
    , where\n   <anydomain> is any domain name.  The wildcards potentially apply to\n\
    \   descendents of <anydomain>, but not to <anydomain> itself.\n   For example,\
    \ suppose a large company located in California with a\n   large, non-IP/TCP,\
    \ network wanted to create a mail gateway.  If the\n   company was called DWP.LA.CA.US,\
    \ and the IP/TCP capable gateway\n   machine (Internet forwarder) was called ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV,\
    \ the\n   following RRs might be entered into the .US zone.\n           dwp.la.ca.us\
    \    MX      10       ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV\n         *.dwp.la.ca.us    MX      10\
    \       ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV\n   The wildcard record *.DWP.LA.CA.US would cause\
    \ an MX query for any\n   domain name ending in DWP.LA.CA.US to return an MX RR\
    \ pointing at\n   ELROY.JPL.NASA.GOV. The entry without the \"*\" is needed so\
    \ the host\n   dwp can be found.\n   In the US Domain, wildcard records are allowed\
    \ in our zone files\n   under the organizational subdomain (and where noted otherwise)\
    \ but no\n   wildcard records are allowed under the \"City\" or \"State\" domain.\n\
    \       The authors strongly believe that it is in everyone's\n       interest\
    \ and good for the Internet to have each host\n       explicitly registered (that\
    \ is, we believe that wildcards\n       should not be used), we also realize that\
    \ not everyone\n       agrees with this belief.  Thus, we will allow wildcard\n\
    \       records in the US Domain under groups or organizations.\n       For example,\
    \ *.DWP.LA.CA.US.\n       The reason we feel single entries are the best is by\
    \ the mere\n       fact that if anyone wanted to find one of the hosts in the\n\
    \       domain name system it would be there, and problems can be\n       detected\
    \ more easily.  When using wildcards records all the\n       hosts under a subdomain\
    \ are hidden.\n"
