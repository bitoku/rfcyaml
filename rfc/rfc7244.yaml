- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190]\
    \ or the\n   multimedia session, a receiver may not synchronize playout across\
    \ the\n   multimedia session or layered video session until RTCP Sender Report\n\
    \   (SR) packets have been received on all components of RTP sessions.\n   The\
    \ components of RTP sessions are per-media-type RTP sessions for\n   the multimedia\
    \ sessions or per-layer RTP sessions for the layered\n   video sessions.  For\
    \ multicast sessions, the Initial Synchronization\n   Delay metric varies with\
    \ the session bandwidth, the number of\n   members, and the number of senders\
    \ in the session.  The RTP Flow\n   Initial Synchronization Delay Metrics Block\
    \ defined in this document\n   can be used to report such a metric, i.e., the\
    \ Initial\n   Synchronization Delay to receive all the RTP streams belonging to\
    \ the\n   same multimedia session or layered video session.  In the absence of\n\
    \   packet loss, the Initial Synchronization Delay is equal to the\n   average\
    \ time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP\n   session with the\
    \ longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of\n   packet loss, the media\
    \ synchronization should rely on the in-band\n   mapping of RTP and NTP-format\
    \ timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the\n   reporting interval has passed, and\
    \ the next RTCP SR packet is sent.\n   Receivers of the RTP Flow Initial Synchronization\
    \ Delay Metrics Block\n   could use this metric to compare with targets (i.e.,\
    \ Service Level\n   Agreement or thresholds of the system) to help ensure the\
    \ quality of\n   real-time application performance.\n   In an RTP multimedia session,\
    \ there can be an arbitrary number of\n   streams carried in different RTP sessions,\
    \ with the same RTCP CNAME.\n   These streams may be not synchronized with each\
    \ other.  For example,\n   one audio stream and one video stream belong to the\
    \ same session, and\n   the audio stream is transmitted lagging behind the video\
    \ stream for\n   multiple tens of milliseconds [TR-126].  The RTP Flow Synchronization\n\
    \   Offset block can be used to report such synchronization offset\n   between\
    \ video and audio streams.  This block is also applied to the\n   case where an\
    \ RTP session can contain media streams with media from\n   multiple media types.\
    \  The metrics defined in the RTP Flow\n   Synchronization Offset Metrics Block\
    \ can be used by the network\n   manager for troubleshooting and dealing with\
    \ user-experience issues.\n"

    \ Offset: 64 bits\n      The synchronization offset of the reporting RTP stream\

    \ units for reporting RTP packet i, Sj is the NTP\n      timestamp from the reference\

    \      [RFC6051], Si and Sj should be obtained directly from the RTP\n      packets\
    \ where NTP timestamps are available.  If not, Si and Sj\n      should be calculated\
    \ from their corresponding RTP timestamps.  The\n      value of the Synchronization\
    \ Offset is represented using a 64-bit\n      signed NTP-format timestamp as defined\
    \ in [RFC5905], which is a\n      64-bit signed fixed-point number with the integer\
    \ part in the\n      first 32 bits and the fractional part in the last 32 bits.\
    \  A\n      positive value of the Synchronization Offset means that the\n    \
    \  reporting stream leads before the reference stream, while a\n      negative\
    \ one means the reporting stream lags behind the reference\n      stream.  The\
    \ Synchronization Offset of zero means the stream is\n      the reference stream.\n\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   When using Secure RTP [RFC3711], or other media-layer\
    \ security,\n   reporting accurate synchronization offset information can expose\
    \ some\n   details about the timing of the cryptographic operations that are\n\
    \   used to protect the media.  There is a possibility that this timing\n   information\
    \ might enable a side-channel attack on the encryption. For\n   environments where\
    \ this attack is a concern, implementations need to\n   take care to ensure cryptographic\
    \ processing and media compression\n   take the same amount of time irrespective\
    \ of the media content, to\n   avoid the potential attack.\n   Besides this, it\
    \ is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no\n   new security considerations\
    \ beyond those described in [RFC3611].\n"
