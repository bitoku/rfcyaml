  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   The MOS Metrics Report Block can be used in any application\
    \ of RTP\n   for which QoE (Quality-of-Experience) measurement algorithms are\n\
    \   defined.\n   The factors that affect real-time audio/video application quality\
    \ can\n   be split into two categories.  The first category consists of\n   transport-specific\
    \ factors such as packet loss, delay, and jitter\n   (which also translates into\
    \ losses in the playback buffer).  The\n   factors in the second category consists\
    \ of content- and codec-related\n   factors such as codec type and loss recovery\
    \ technique, coding bit\n   rate, packetization scheme, and content characteristics\n\
    \   Transport-specific factors may be insufficient to infer real-time\n   media\
    \ quality as codec related parameters and the interaction between\n   transport\
    \ problems and application-layer protocols can have a\n   substantial effect on\
    \ observed media quality.  Media quality may be\n   measured using algorithms\
    \ that directly compare input and output\n   media streams, or it may be estimated\
    \ using algorithms that model the\n   interaction between media quality, protocol,\
    \ and encoded content.\n   Media quality is commonly expressed in terms of MOS;\
    \ however, it is\n   also represented by a range of indexes and other scores.\n\
    \   The measurement of media quality has a number of applications:\n   o  Detecting\
    \ problems with media delivery or encoding that is\n      impacting user-perceived\
    \ quality.\n   o  Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real-time data\n\
    \      quality requirements.\n   o  Determining which system techniques to use\
    \ in a given situation\n      and when to switch from one technique to another\
    \ as system\n      parameters change (for example, as discussed in [G.1082]).\n\
    \   o  Prequalifying a network to assess its ability to deliver an\n      acceptable\
    \ end-user-perceived quality level.\n"

- title: 3.  MOS Metrics Block
  contents:
  - "3.  MOS Metrics Block\n   A multimedia application MOS Metric is commonly expressed\
    \ as a MOS.\n   The MOS is usually on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents\n\
    \   excellent and 1 represents unacceptable; however, it can use other\n   ranges\
    \ (for example, 0 to 10 ).  The term \"MOS\" originates from\n   subjective testing\
    \ and is used to refer to the mean of a number of\n   individual opinion scores.\
    \  Therefore, there is a well-understood\n   relationship between MOS and user\
    \ experience; hence, the industry\n   commonly uses MOS as the scale for objective\
    \ test results.\n   Subjective tests can be used for measuring live network traffic;\n\
    \   however, the use of objective or algorithmic measurement techniques\n   allows\
    \ much larger scale measurements to be made.  Within the scope\n   of this document,\
    \ mean opinion scores are obtained using objective or\n   estimation algorithms.\
    \  ITU-T or ITU-R recommendations (e.g.,\n   [BS.1387-1], [G.107], [G.107.1],\
    \ [P.862], [P.862.1], [P.862.2],\n   [P.863], [P.564], [G.1082], [P.1201.1], [P.1201.2],\
    \ [P.1202.1],\n   [P.1202.2]) define methodologies for assessment of the performance\
    \ of\n   audio and video streams.  Other international and national standards\n\
    \   organizations such as EBU, ETSI, IEC, and IEEE also define QoE\n   algorithms\
    \ and methodologies, and the intent of this document is not\n   to restrict its\
    \ use to ITU recommendations but to suggest that ITU\n   recommendations be used\
    \ where they are defined.\n   This block reports the media quality in the form\
    \ of a MOS range\n   (e.g., 1-5, 0-10, or 0-100, as specified by the calculation\n\
    \   algorithm); however, it does not report the MOS that includes\n   parameters\
    \ outside the scope of the RTP stream, for example,\n   signaling performance,\
    \ mean time to repair (MTTR), or other factors\n   that may affect the overall\
    \ user experience.\n   The MOS Metric reported in this block gives a numerical\
    \ indication of\n   the perceived quality of the received media stream, which\
    \ is\n   typically measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances\n\
    \   of this Metrics Block refer by synchronization source (SSRC) to the\n   separate\
    \ auxiliary Measurement Information block [RFC6776] which\n   describes measurement\
    \ periods in use (see RFC 6776, Section 4.2).\n   This Metrics Block relies on\
    \ the measurement period in the\n   Measurement Information block indicating the\
    \ span of the report.\n   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP\
    \ packet as the\n   Measurement Information block.  Receivers MUST verify that\
    \ the\n   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as\n\
    \   this Metrics Block.  If not, this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.\n"

    \   Segment Type (S): 1 bit\n      This field is used to identify the segment\

    \ or higher and High Definition (HD) or higher resolution video have\n   'h' resolution,\
    \ wideband speech (7 kHz) and video with resolution\n   between SD and HD has\

    \ the MOS reference; for example, MOS\n   values for narrowband, wideband, super-wideband\
    \ codecs occupy the\n   same range but SHOULD be reported in different value.\
    \  For video\n   application, MOS scores for SD resolution, HD resolution video\
    \ also\n   occupy the same ranges and SHOULD be reported in different value.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage\n   When SDP is used in offer/answer context, the SDP\
    \ Offer/Answer usage\n   defined in [RFC3611] applies.  In the offer/answer context,\
    \ the\n   signaling described above might be used in three ways:\n   o  asymmetric\
    \ behavior (segment extensions sent in only one\n      direction),\n   o  the\
    \ offer of mutually exclusive alternatives, or\n   o  the offer of more segments\
    \ than can be sent in a single session.\n   A direction attribute MAY be included\
    \ in a \"calgextmap\"; without it,\n   the direction implicitly inherits, of course,\
    \ from the RTCP stream\n   direction.\n   Segment extensions, with their directions,\
    \ MAY be signaled for an\n   \"inactive\" stream.  An extension direction MUST\
    \ be compatible with\n   the stream direction.  If a segment extension in the\
    \ SDP offer is\n   marked as \"sendonly\" and the answerer desires to receive\
    \ it, the\n   extension MUST be marked as \"recvonly\" in the SDP answer.  An\n\
    \   answerer that has no desire to receive the extension or does not\n   understand\
    \ the extension SHOULD NOT include it in the SDP answer.\n   If a segment extension\
    \ is marked as \"recvonly\" in the SDP offer and\n   the answerer desires to send\
    \ it, the extension MUST be marked as\n   \"sendonly\" in the SDP answer.  An\
    \ answerer that has no desire to, or\n   is unable to, send the extension SHOULD\
    \ NOT include it in the SDP\n   answer.\n   If a segment extension is offered\
    \ as \"sendrecv\", explicitly or\n   implicitly, and asymmetric behavior is desired,\
    \ the SDP MAY be\n   modified to modify or add direction qualifiers for that segment\n\
    \   extension.\n   A \"mosref\" attribute and \"MOS Type\" attribute MAY be included\
    \ in a\n   calgextmap; if not present, the \"mosref\" and \"MOS Type\" MUST be\
    \ as\n   defined in the QoE estimation algorithm referenced by the name\n   attribute\
    \ (e.g., P.1201.1 [P.1201.1] indicates lower resolution used\n   while P.1201.2\
    \ [P.1201.2] indicates higher resolution used) or\n   payload type carried in\
    \ the segment extension (e.g., EVRC-WB\n   [RFC5188] indicates using Wideband\
    \ Codec).  However, not all payload\n   types or MOS algorithm names indicate\
    \ resolution to be used and MOS\n   type to be used.  If an answerer receives\
    \ an offer with a \"mosref\"\n   attribute value it doesn't support (e.g.,the\
    \ answerer only supports\n   \"l\" and receives \"h\" from offerer), the answer\
    \ SHOULD reject the\n   mosref attribute value offered by the offerer.\n   If\
    \ the answerer wishes to reject a \"mosref\" attribute offered by the\n   offerer,\
    \ it sets identifiers associated with segment extensions in\n   the answer to\
    \ the value in the range 4096-4351.  The rejected answer\n   MUST contain a \"\
    mosref\" attribute whose value is the value of the SDP\n   offer.\n   Local identifiers\
    \ in the valid range (inclusive) in an offer or\n   answer must not be used more\
    \ than once per media section.  A session\n   update MAY change the direction\
    \ qualifiers of segment extensions\n   under use.  A session update MAY add or\
    \ remove segment extension(s).\n   Identifier values in the valid range MUST NOT\
    \ be altered (remapped).\n   If a party wishes to offer mutually exclusive alternatives,\
    \ then\n   multiple segment extensions with the same identifier in the\n   (unusable)\
    \ range 4096-4351 MAY be offered; the answerer SHOULD select\n   at most one of\
    \ the offered extensions with the same identifier, and\n   remap it to a free\
    \ identifier in the valid range for that extension\n   to be usable.  Note that\
    \ the two segment types defined in Section 3\n   are also exclusive alternatives.\n\
    \   If more segment extensions are offered in the valid range, the\n   answerer\
    \ SHOULD choose those that are desired and place the offered\n   identifier value\
    \ \"as is\" in the SDP answer.\n   Similarly, if more segment extensions are offered\
    \ than can be fit in\n   the valid range, identifiers in the range 4096-4351 MAY\
    \ be offered;\n   the answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired and remap\
    \ them to a\n   free identifier in the valid range.\n   Note that the range 4096-4351\
    \ for these negotiation identifiers is\n   deliberately restricted to allow expansion\
    \ of the range of valid\n   identifiers in the future.  Segment extensions with\
    \ an identifier\n   outside the valid range cannot, of course, be used.\n   Example:\n\
    \   Note - port numbers, RTP profiles, payload IDs and rtpmaps, etc.,\n   have\
    \ all been omitted for brevity.\n   The offer:\n   a=rtcp-xr:mos-metric=calg:4906=P1201_l,calg:4906=P1202_l,\
    \ calg:\n   4907=G107\n   The answerer is interested in transmission P.1202.1\
    \ on a lower\n   resolution application, but it doesn't support P.1201.1 on a\
    \ lower\n   resolution application at all.  It is interested in transmission\n\
    \   G.107.  Therefore, it adjusts the declarations:\n   a=rtcp-xr:mos-metric=calg:1=P1202_l,calg:2=G107\n"
