- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Traffic Engineering Working Group has developed requirements\
    \ for\n   inter-area and inter-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n\
    \   Engineering in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].\n   Various proposals have subsequently\
    \ been made to address some or all\n   of these requirements through extensions\
    \ to the Resource Reservation\n   Protocol Traffic Engineering extensions (RSVP-TE)\
    \ and to the Interior\n   Gateway Protocols (IGPs) (i.e., Intermediate System\
    \ to Intermediate\n   System (IS-IS) and OSPF).\n   This document introduces the\
    \ techniques for establishing Traffic\n   Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths\
    \ (LSPs) across multiple domains.\n   In this context and within the remainder\
    \ of this document, we\n   consider all source-based and constraint-based routed\
    \ LSPs and refer\n   to them interchangeably as \"TE LSPs\" or \"LSPs\".\n   The\
    \ functional components of these techniques are separated into the\n   mechanisms\
    \ for discovering reachability and TE information, for\n   computing the paths\
    \ of LSPs, and for signaling the LSPs.  Note that\n   the aim of this document\
    \ is not to detail each of those techniques,\n   which are covered in separate\
    \ documents referenced from the sections\n   of this document that introduce the\
    \ techniques, but rather to propose\n   a framework for inter-domain MPLS Traffic\
    \ Engineering.\n   Note that in the remainder of this document, the term \"MPLS\
    \ Traffic\n   Engineering\" is used equally to apply to MPLS and Generalized MPLS\n\
    \   (GMPLS) traffic.  Specific issues pertaining to the use of GMPLS in\n   inter-domain\
    \ environments (for example, policy implications of the\n   use of the Link Management\
    \ Protocol [RFC4204] on inter-domain links)\n    are covered in separate documents\
    \ such as [GMPLS-AS].\n   For the purposes of this document, a domain is considered\
    \ to be any\n   collection of network elements within a common sphere of address\n\
    \   management or path computational responsibility.  Examples of such\n   domains\
    \ include IGP areas and Autonomous Systems.  Wholly or\n   partially overlapping\
    \ domains (e.g., path computation sub-domains of\n   areas or ASes) are not within\
    \ the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Nested Domains
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Nested Domains\n   Nested domains are outside the scope of this document.\
    \  It may be\n   that some domains that are nested administratively or for the\n\
    \   purposes of address space management can be considered as adjacent\n   domains\
    \ for the purposes of this document; however, the fact that the\n   domains are\
    \ nested is then immaterial.  In the context of MPLS TE,\n   domain A is considered\
    \ to be nested within domain B if domain A is\n   wholly contained in domain B,\
    \ and domain B is fully or partially\n   aware of the TE characteristics and topology\
    \ of domain A.\n"
- title: 2.  Signaling Options
  contents:
  - "2.  Signaling Options\n   Three distinct options for signaling TE LSPs across\
    \ multiple domains\n   are identified.  The choice of which options to use may\
    \ be influenced\n   by the path computation technique used (see section 3), although\
    \ some\n   path computation techniques may apply to multiple signaling options.\n\
    \   The choice may further depend on the application to which the TE LSPs\n  \
    \ are put and the nature, topology, and switching capabilities of the\n   network.\n\
    \   A comparison of the usages of the different signaling options is\n   beyond\
    \ the scope of this document and should be the subject of a\n   separate applicability\
    \ statement.\n"
- title: 2.1.  LSP Nesting
  contents:
  - "2.1.  LSP Nesting\n   Hierarchical LSPs form a fundamental part of MPLS [RFC3031]\
    \ and are\n   discussed in further detail in [RFC4206].  Hierarchical LSPs may\n\
    \   optionally be advertised as TE links.  Note that a hierarchical LSP\n   that\
    \ spans multiple domains cannot be advertised in this way because\n   there is\
    \ no concept of TE information that spans domains.\n   Hierarchical LSPs can be\
    \ used in support of inter-domain TE LSPs.  In\n   particular, a hierarchical\
    \ LSP may be used to achieve connectivity\n   between any pair of Label Switching\
    \ Routers (LSRs) within a domain.\n   The ingress and egress of the hierarchical\
    \ LSP could be the edge\n   nodes of the domain in which case connectivity is\
    \ achieved across the\n   entire domain, or they could be any other pair of LSRs\
    \ in the domain.\n   The technique of carrying one TE LSP within another is termed\
    \ LSP\n   nesting.  A hierarchical LSP may provide a TE LSP tunnel to transport\n\
    \   (i.e., nest) multiple TE LSPs along a common part of their paths.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ a TE LSP may carry (i.e., nest) a single LSP in a\n   one-to-one mapping.\n\
    \   The signaling trigger for the establishment of a hierarchical LSP may\n  \
    \ be the receipt of a signaling request for the TE LSP that it will\n   carry,\
    \ or may be a management action to \"pre-engineer\" a domain to be\n   crossed\
    \ by TE LSPs that would be used as hierarchical LSPs by the\n   traffic that has\
    \ to traverse the domain.  Furthermore, the mapping\n   (inheritance rules) between\
    \ attributes of the nested and the\n   hierarchical LSPs (including bandwidth)\
    \ may be statically pre-\n   configured or, for on-demand hierarchical LSPs, may\
    \ be dynamic\n   according to the properties of the nested LSPs.  Even in the\
    \ dynamic\n   case, inheritance from the properties of the nested LSP(s) can be\n\
    \   complemented by local or domain-wide policy rules.\n   Note that a hierarchical\
    \ LSP may be constructed to span multiple\n   domains or parts of domains.  However,\
    \ such an LSP cannot be\n   advertised as a TE link that spans domains.  The end\
    \ points of a\n   hierarchical LSP are not necessarily on domain boundaries, so\
    \ nesting\n   is not limited to domain boundaries.\n   Note also that the Interior/Exterior\
    \ Gateway Protocol (IGP/EGP)\n   routing topology is maintained unaffected by\
    \ the LSP connectivity and\n   TE links introduced by hierarchical LSPs even if\
    \ they are advertised\n   as TE links.  That is, the routing protocols do not\
    \ exchange messages\n   over the hierarchical LSPs, and LSPs are not used to create\
    \ routing\n   adjacencies between routers.\n   During the operation of establishing\
    \ a nested LSP that uses a\n   hierarchical LSP, the SENDER_TEMPLATE and SESSION\
    \ objects remain\n   unchanged along the entire length of the nested LSP, as do\
    \ all other\n   objects that have end-to-end significance.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Contiguous LSP
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Contiguous LSP\n   A single contiguous LSP is established from ingress\
    \ to egress in a\n   single signaling exchange.  No further LSPs are required\
    \ to be\n   established to support this LSP so that hierarchical or stitched LSPs\n\
    \   are not needed.\n   A contiguous LSP uses the same Session/LSP ID along the\
    \ whole of its\n   path (that is, at each LSR).  The notions of \"splicing\" together\n\
    \   different LSPs or of \"shuffling\" Session or LSP identifiers are not\n  \
    \ considered.\n"
- title: 2.3.  LSP Stitching
  contents:
  - "2.3.  LSP Stitching\n   LSP Stitching is described in [STITCH].  In the LSP stitching\
    \ model,\n   separate LSPs (referred to as a TE LSP segments) are established\
    \ and\n   are \"stitched\" together in the data plane so that a single end-to-end\n\
    \   Label Switched Path is achieved.  The distinction is that the\n   component\
    \ LSP segments are signaled as distinct TE LSPs in the\n   control plane.  Each\
    \ signaled TE LSP segment has a different source\n   and destination.\n   LSP\
    \ stitching can be used in support of inter-domain TE LSPs.  In\n   particular,\
    \ an LSP segment may be used to achieve connectivity\n   between any pair of LSRs\
    \ within a domain.  The ingress and egress of\n   the LSP segment could be the\
    \ edge nodes of the domain in which case\n   connectivity is achieved across the\
    \ entire domain, or they could be\n   any other pair of LSRs in the domain.\n\
    \   The signaling trigger for the establishment of a TE LSP segment may\n   be\
    \ the establishment of the previous TE LSP segment, the receipt of a\n   setup\
    \ request for TE LSP that it plans to stitch to a local TE LSP\n   segment, or\
    \ a management action.\n   LSP segments may be managed and advertised as TE links.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Hybrid Methods
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Hybrid Methods\n   There is nothing to prevent the mixture of signaling\
    \ methods\n   described above when establishing a single, end-to-end, inter-domain\n\
    \   TE LSP.  It may be desirable in this case for the choice of the\n   various\
    \ methods to be reported along the path, perhaps through the\n   Record Route\
    \ Object (RRO).\n   If there is a desire to restrict which methods are used, this\
    \ must be\n   signaled as described in the next section.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Control of Downstream Choice of Signaling Method
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Control of Downstream Choice of Signaling Method\n   Notwithstanding the\
    \ previous section, an ingress LSR may wish to\n   restrict the signaling methods\
    \ applied to a particular LSP at domain\n   boundaries across the network.  Such\
    \ control, where it is required,\n   may be achieved by the definition of appropriate\
    \ new flags in the\n   SESSION-ATTRIBUTE object or the Attributes Flags TLV of\
    \ the\n   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object [RFC4420].  Before defining a mechanism to\n \
    \  provide this level of control, the functional requirement to control\n   the\
    \ way in which the network delivers a service must be established.\n   Also, due\
    \ consideration must be given to the impact on\n   interoperability since new\
    \ mechanisms must be backwards compatible,\n   and care must be taken to avoid\
    \ allowing standards-conformant\n   implementations that each supports a different\
    \ functional subset in\n   such a way that they are not capable of establishing\
    \ LSPs.\n"
- title: 3.  Path Computation Techniques
  contents:
  - "3.  Path Computation Techniques\n   The discussion of path computation techniques\
    \ within this document is\n   limited significantly to the determination of where\
    \ computation may\n   take place and what components of the full path may be determined.\n\
    \   The techniques used are closely tied to the signaling methodologies\n   described\
    \ in the previous section in that certain computation\n   techniques may require\
    \ the use of particular signaling approaches and\n   vice versa.\n   Any discussion\
    \ of the appropriateness of a particular path\n   computation technique in any\
    \ given circumstance is beyond the scope\n   of this document and should be described\
    \ in a separate applicability\n   statement.\n   Path computation algorithms are\
    \ firmly out of the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Management Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Management Configuration\n   Path computation may be performed by offline\
    \ tools or by a network\n   planner.  The resultant path may be supplied to the\
    \ ingress LSR as\n   part of the TE LSP or service request, and encoded by the\
    \ ingress LSR\n   as an Explicit Route Object (ERO) on the Path message that is\
    \ sent\n   out.\n   There is no reason why the path provided by the operator should\
    \ not\n   span multiple domains if the relevant information is available to the\n\
    \   planner or the offline tool.  The definition of what information is\n   needed\
    \ to perform this operation and how that information is\n   gathered, is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Head-End Computation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Head-End Computation\n   The head-end, or ingress, LSR may assume responsibility\
    \ for path\n   computation when the operator supplies part or none of the explicit\n\
    \   path.  The operator must, in any case, supply at least the\n   destination\
    \ address (egress) of the LSP.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Multi-Domain Visibility Computation
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Multi-Domain Visibility Computation\n   If the ingress has sufficient\
    \ visibility of the topology and TE\n   information for all of the domains across\
    \ which it will route the LSP\n   to its destination, then it may compute and\
    \ provide the entire path.\n   The quality of this path (that is, its optimality\
    \ as discussed in\n   section 3.5) can be better if the ingress has full visibility\
    \ into\n   all relevant domains rather than just sufficient visibility to\n  \
    \ provide some path to the destination.\n   Extreme caution must be exercised\
    \ in consideration of the\n   distribution of the requisite TE information.  See\
    \ section 4.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Partial Visibility Computation
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Partial Visibility Computation\n   It may be that the ingress does not\
    \ have full visibility of the\n   topology of all domains, but does have information\
    \ about the\n   connectedness of the domains and the TE resource availability\
    \ across\n   the domains.  In this case, the ingress is not able to provide a\n\
    \   fully specified strict explicit path from ingress to egress.\n   However,\
    \ for example, the ingress might supply an explicit path that\n   comprises:\n\
    \      - explicit hops from ingress to the local domain boundary\n      - loose\
    \ hops representing the domain entry points across the\n        network\n    \
    \  - a loose hop identifying the egress.\n   Alternatively, the explicit path\
    \ might be expressed as:\n      - explicit hops from ingress to the local domain\
    \ boundary\n      - strict hops giving abstract nodes representing each domain\
    \ in\n        turn\n      - a loose hop identifying the egress.\n   These two\
    \ explicit path formats could be mixed according to the\n   information available\
    \ resulting in different combinations of loose\n   hops and abstract nodes.\n\
    \   This form of explicit path relies on some further computation\n   technique\
    \ being applied at the domain boundaries.  See section 3.3.\n   As with the multi-domain\
    \ visibility option, extreme caution must be\n   exercised in consideration of\
    \ the distribution of the requisite TE\n   information.  See section 4.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Local Domain Visibility Computation
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Local Domain Visibility Computation\n   A final possibility for ingress-based\
    \ computation is that the ingress\n   LSR has visibility only within its own domain,\
    \ and connectivity\n   information only as far as determining one or more domain\
    \ exit points\n   that may be suitable for carrying the LSP to its egress.\n \
    \  In this case, the ingress builds an explicit path that comprises\n   just:\n\
    \      - explicit hops from ingress to the local domain boundary\n      - a loose\
    \ hop identifying the egress.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Domain Boundary Computation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Domain Boundary Computation\n   If the partial explicit path methods described\
    \ in sections 3.2.2 or\n   3.2.3 are applied, then the LSR at each domain boundary\
    \ is\n   responsible for ensuring that there is sufficient path information\n\
    \   added to the Path message to carry it at least to the next domain\n   boundary\
    \ (that is, out of the new domain).\n   If the LSR at the domain boundary has\
    \ full visibility to the egress\n   then it can supply the entire explicit path.\
    \  Note, however, that the\n   ERO processing rules of [RFC3209] state that it\
    \ should only update\n   the ERO as far as the next specified hop (that is, the\
    \ next domain\n   boundary if one was supplied in the original ERO) and, of course,\n\
    \   must not insert ERO subobjects immediately before a strict hop.\n   If the\
    \ LSR at the domain boundary has only partial visibility (using\n   the definitions\
    \ of section 3.2.2), it will fill in the path as far as\n   the next domain boundary,\
    \ and will supply further domain/domain\n   boundary information if not already\
    \ present in the ERO.\n   If the LSR at the domain boundary has only local visibility\
    \ into the\n   immediate domain, it will simply add information to the ERO to\
    \ carry\n   the Path message as far as the next domain boundary.\n   Domain boundary\
    \ path computations are performed independently from\n   each other.  Domain boundary\
    \ LSRs may have different computation\n   capabilities, run different path computation\
    \ algorithms, apply\n   different sets of constraints and optimization criteria,\
    \ and so\n   forth, which might result in path segment quality that is\n   unpredictable\
    \ to and out of the control of the ingress LSR.  A\n   solution to this issue\
    \ lies in enhancing the information signaled\n   during LSP setup to include a\
    \ larger set of constraints and to\n   include the paths of related LSPs (such\
    \ as diverse protected LSPs) as\n   described in [GMPLS-E2E].\n   It is also the\
    \ case that paths generated on domain boundaries may\n   produce loops.  Specifically,\
    \ the paths computed may loop back into a\n   domain that has already been crossed\
    \ by the LSP.  This may or may not\n   be a problem, and might even be desirable,\
    \ but could also give rise\n   to real loops.  This can be avoided by using the\
    \ recorded route (RRO)\n   to provide exclusions within the path computation algorithm,\
    \ but in\n   the case of lack of trust between domains it may be necessary for\
    \ the\n   RRO to indicate the previously visited domains.  Even this solution\n\
    \   is not available where the RRO is not available on a Path message.\n   Note\
    \ that when an RRO is used to provide exclusions, and a loop-free\n   path is\
    \ found to be not available by the computation at a downstream\n   border node,\
    \ crankback [CRANKBACK] may enable an upstream border node\n   to select an alternate\
    \ path.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Path Computation Element
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Path Computation Element\n   The computation techniques in sections 3.2\
    \ and 3.3 rely on topology\n   and TE information being distributed to the ingress\

    \ computing\n   paths.  Note that there may be scaling concerns with distributing\
    \ the\n   required information; see section 4.\n   An alternative technique places\
    \ the responsibility for path\n   computation with a Path Computation Element\
    \ (PCE) [RFC4655].  There\n   may be either a centralized PCE, or multiple PCEs\
    \ (each having local\n   visibility and collaborating in a distributed fashion\
    \ to compute an\n   end-to-end path) across the entire network and even within\
    \ any one\n   domain.  The PCE may collect topology and TE information from the\n\

    \ depending on the\n   constraints applied to the path computation.  In a multi-domain\n\
    \   environment, the definitions are multiplied so that an optimal route\n   might\
    \ be defined as the route that would be computed in the absence\n   of domain\
    \ boundaries.  Alternatively, another constraint might be\n   applied to the path\
    \ computation to reduce or limit the number of\n   domains crossed by the LSP.\n\
    \   It is easy to construct examples that show that partitioning a\n   network\
    \ into domains, and the resulting loss or aggregation of\n   routing information\
    \ may lead to the computation of routes that are\n   other than optimal.  It is\
    \ impossible to guarantee optimal routing in\n   the presence of aggregation /\

    \ is collected into a TE Database (TED)\n   on which path computation algorithms\
    \ operate either directly or by\n   first constructing a network graph.\n   The\
    \ path computation techniques described in the previous section\n   make certain\
    \ demands upon the distribution of reachability\n   information and the TE capabilities\
    \ of nodes and links within domains\n   as well as the TE connectivity across\
    \ domains.\n   Currently, TE information is distributed within domains by additions\n\
    \   to IGPs [RFC3630], [RFC3784].\n   In cases where two domains are interconnected\
    \ by one or more links\n   (that is, the domain boundary falls on a link rather\
    \ than on a node),\n   there should be a mechanism to distribute the TE information\n\
    \   associated with the inter-domain links to the corresponding domains.\n   This\
    \ would facilitate better path computation and reduce TE-related\n   crankbacks\
    \ on these links.\n   Where a domain is a subset of an IGP area, filtering of\
    \ TE\n   information may be applied at the domain boundary.  This filtering\n\
    \   may be one way or two way.\n   Where information needs to reach a PCE that\
    \ spans multiple domains,\n   the PCE may snoop on the IGP traffic in each domain,\
    \ or play an\n   active part as an IGP-capable node in each domain.  The PCE might\n\
    \   also receive TED updates from a proxy within the domain.\n   It is possible\
    \ that an LSR that performs path computation (for\n   example, an ingress LSR)\
    \ obtains the topology and TE information of\n   not just its own domain, but\
    \ other domains as well.  This information\n   may be subject to filtering applied\
    \ by the advertising domain (for\n   example, the information may be limited to\
    \ Forwarding Adjacencies\n   (FAs) across other domains, or the information may\
    \ be aggregated or\n   abstracted).\n   Before starting work on any protocols\

    \ be given to TE extensions to existing protocols such as BGP, and\n   how the\
    \ information advertised may be fed to the IGPs.  It must be\n   noted that any\
    \ extensions that cause a significant increase in the\n   amount of processing\
    \ (such as aggregation computation) at domain\n   boundaries, or a significant\
    \ increase in the amount of information\n   flooded (such as detailed TE information)\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  LSP Re-Optimization\n   Re-optimization is the process of moving a TE LSP\
    \ from one path to\n   another, more preferable path (where no attempt is made\
    \ in this\n   document to define \"preferable\" as no attempt was made to define\n\
    \   \"optimal\").  Make-before-break techniques are usually applied to\n   ensure\
    \ that traffic is disrupted as little as possible.  The Shared\n   Explicit style\
    \ is usually used to avoid double booking of network\n   resources.\n   Re-optimization\
    \ may be available within a single domain.\n   Alternatively, re-optimization\
    \ may involve a change in route across\n   several domains or might involve a\
    \ choice of different transit\n   domains.\n   Re-optimization requires that all\
    \ or part of the path of the LSP be\n   re-computed.  The techniques used may\
    \ be selected as described in\n   section 3, and this will influence whether the\
    \ whole or part of the\n   path is re-optimized.\n   The trigger for path computation\
    \ and re-optimization may be an\n   operator request, a timer, information about\
    \ a change in availability\n   of network resources, or a change in operational\
    \ parameters (for\n   example, bandwidth) of an LSP.  This trigger must be applied\
    \ to the\n   point in the network that requests re-computation and controls re-\n\
    \   optimization and may require additional signaling.\n   Note also that where\
    \ multiple mutually-diverse paths are applied\n   end-to-end (i.e., not simply\
    \ within protection domains; see section\n   5.5) the point of calculation for\
    \ re-optimization (whether it is PCE,\n   ingress, or domain entry point) needs\
    \ to know all such paths before\n   attempting re-optimization of any one path.\
    \  Mutual diversity here\n   means that a set of computed paths has no commonality.\
    \  Such\n   diversity might be link, node, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG), or even\n\
    \   domain disjointedness according to circumstances and the service\n   being\
    \ delivered.\n   It may be the case that re-optimization is best achieved by\n\
    \   recomputing the paths of multiple LSPs at once.  Indeed, this can be\n   shown\
    \ to be most efficient when the paths of all LSPs are known, not\n   simply those\
    \ LSPs that originate at a particular ingress.  While this\n   problem is inherited\
    \ from single domain re-optimization and is out of\n   scope within this document,\

    \ domain\n   that contains the failure.  That retry may be attempted by nodes\n\
    \   wholly within the domain, or the failure may be referred back to the\n   LSR\
    \ at the domain boundary.\n   If the failure cannot be bypassed within the domain\
    \ where the failure\n   occurred (perhaps there is no suitable alternate route,\
    \ perhaps\n   rerouting is not allowed by domain policy, or perhaps the Path\n\
    \   message specifically bans such action), the error must be reported\n   back\
    \ to the previous or head-end domain.\n   Subsequent repair attempts may be made\
    \ by domains further upstream,\n   but will only be properly effective if sufficient\

    \ back\n   upstream [CRANKBACK].  Note that there is a tension between this\n\

    \ may be applicable at domain boundaries.\n   Further attempts to signal the failed\
    \ LSP may apply the information\n   about the failures as constraints to path\
    \ computation, or may signal\n   them as specific path exclusions [EXCLUDE].\n\

    \  A backup TE LSP is configured and signaled at each hop, and\n   activated upon\
    \ detecting or being informed of a network element\n   failure.  The node immediately\

    \ the set of protected TE LSPs\n   onto the appropriate backup tunnel(s) and around\
    \ the failed resource.\n   In the context of inter-domain TE, there are several\
    \ different\n   failure scenarios that must be analyzed.  Provision of suitable\n\
    \   solutions may be further complicated by the fact that [RFC4090]\n   specifies\
    \ two distinct modes of operation referred to as the \"one to\n   one mode\" and\
    \ the \"facility back-up mode\".\n   The failure scenarios specific to inter-domain\

    \   Although it may be possible to apply the same techniques for Fast\n   Reroute\
    \ (FRR) to the different methods of signaling inter-domain LSPs\n   described\
    \ in section 2, the results of protection may be different\n   when it is the\

    \ in applicability\n   statements or, in the case of a change in base behavior,\
    \ in\n   implementation guidelines specific to the signaling techniques.\n   Note\
    \ that after local repair has been performed, it may be desirable\n   to re-optimize\
    \ the LSP (see section 5.1).  If the point of re-\n   optimization (for example,\
    \ the ingress LSR) lies in a different\n   domain to the failure, it may rely\

    \  That is, all\n   security procedures for existing protocols in the MPLS context\n\
    \   continue to apply for the intra-domain cases.\n   Inter-domain security may\
    \ be considered as a more important and more\n   sensitive issue than intra-domain\
    \ security since in inter-domain\n   traffic engineering control and information\
    \ may be passed across\n   administrative boundaries.  The most obvious and most\
    \ sensitive case\n   is inter-AS TE.\n   All of the intra-domain security measures\
    \ for the signaling and\n   routing protocols are equally applicable in the inter-domain\
    \ case.\n   There is, however, a greater likelihood of them being applied in the\n\
    \   inter-domain case.\n   Security for inter-domain MPLS TE is the subject of\
    \ a separate\n   document that analyzes the security deployment models and risks.\n\
    \   This separate document must be completed before inter-domain MPLS TE\n   solution\
    \ documents can be advanced.\n   Similarly, the PCE procedures [RFC4655] are subject\
    \ to security\n   measures for the exchange computation information between PCEs\
    \ and\n   for LSRs that request path computations from a PCE.  The requirements\n\
    \   for this security (set out in [RFC4657]) apply whether the LSR and\n   PCE\
    \ (or the cooperating PCEs) are in the same domain or lie across\n   domain boundaries.\n\
    \   It should be noted, however, that techniques used for (for example)\n   authentication\
    \ require coordination of secrets, keys, or passwords\n   between sender and receiver.\
    \  Where sender and receiver lie within a\n   single administrative domain, this\
    \ process may be simple.  But where\n   sender and receiver lie in different administrative\
    \ domains, cross-\n   domain coordination between network administrators will\
    \ be required\n   in order to provide adequate security.  At this stage, it is\
    \ not\n   proposed that this coordination be provided through an automatic\n \
    \  process or through the use of a protocol.  Human-to-human\n   coordination\
    \ is more likely to provide the required level of\n   confidence in the inter-domain\
    \ security.\n   One new security concept is introduced by inter-domain MPLS TE.\
    \  This\n   is the preservation of confidentiality of topology information.  That\n\
    \   is, one domain may wish to keep secret the way that its network is\n   constructed\
    \ and the availability (or otherwise) of end-to-end network\n   resources.  This\
    \ issue is discussed in sections 3.4.2, 5.2, and 5.8\n   of this document.  When\
    \ there is a requirement to preserve inter-\n   domain topology confidentiality,\
    \ policy filters must be applied at\n   the domain boundaries to avoid distributing\
    \ such information.  This\n   is the responsibility of the domain that distributes\
    \ information, and\n   it may be adequately addressed by aggregation of information\
    \ as\n   described in the referenced sections.\n   Applicability statements for\
    \ particular combinations of signaling,\n   routing, and path computation techniques\
