  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast\n   (SSM) service and its deployment using the PIM-SM and IGMP/MLD\n\
    \   protocols.  The network layer service provided by SSM is a \"channel\",\n\
    \   identified by an SSM destination IP address (G) and a source IP\n   address\
    \ S.  An IPv4 address range has been reserved by IANA for use\n   by the SSM service.\
    \  An SSM destination address range already exists\n   for IPv6.  A source S transmits\
    \ IP datagrams to an SSM destination\n   address G.  A receiver can receive these\
    \ datagrams by subscribing to\n   the channel (Source, Group) or (S,G).  Channel\
    \ subscription is\n   supported by version 3 of the IGMP protocol for IPv4 and\
    \ version2 of\n   the MLD protocol for IPv6.  The interdomain tree for forwarding\
    \ IP\n   multicast datagrams is rooted at the source S, and is constructed\n \
    \  using the PIM Sparse Mode [9] protocol.\n   This document is not intended to\
    \ be a standard for Source-Specific\n   Multicast (SSM).  Instead, its goal is\
    \ to serve as an introduction to\n   SSM and its benefits for anyone interested\
    \ in deploying SSM services.\n   It provides an overview of SSM and how it solves\
    \ a number of problems\n   faced in the deployment of inter-domain multicast.\
    \  It outlines\n   changes to protocols and applications both at end-hosts and\
    \ routers\n   for supporting SSM, with pointers to more detailed documents where\n\
    \   appropriate.  Issues of interoperability with the multicast service\n   model\
    \ defined by RFC 1112 are also discussed.\n   This memo is a product of the Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast (SSM) Working\n   Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.\n\
    \   The keywords \"MUST\"\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\

- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This section defines some terms that are used in the rest\
    \ of this\n   document:\n      Any-Source Multicast (ASM): This is the IP multicast\
    \ service model\n      defined in RFC 1112 [25].  An IP datagram is transmitted\
    \ to a\n      \"host group\", a set of zero or more end-hosts (or routers)\n \
    \     identified by a single IP destination address (224.0.0.0 through\n     \
    \ 239.255.255.255 for IPv4).  End-hosts may join and leave the group\n      any\
    \ time, and there is no restriction on their location or number.\n      Moreover,\
    \ this model supports multicast groups with arbitrarily\n      many senders -\
    \ any end-host (or router) may transmit to a host\n      group, even if it is\
    \ not a member of that group.\n      Source-Specific Multicast (SSM): This is\
    \ the multicast service\n      model defined in [5].  An IP datagram is transmitted\
    \ by a source S\n      to an SSM destination address G, and receivers can receive\
    \ this\n      datagram by subscribing to channel (S,G).  SSM provides host\n \
    \     applications with a \"channel\" abstraction, in which each channel\n   \
    \   has exactly one source and any number of receivers.  SSM is\n      derived\
    \ from earlier work in EXPRESS [1].  The address range 232/8\n      has been assigned\
    \ by IANA for SSM service in IPv4.  For IPv6, the\n      range FF3x::/96 is defined\
    \ for SSM services [21].\n      Source-Filtered Multicast (SFM): This is a variant\
    \ of the ASM\n      service model, and uses the same address range as ASM\n  \
    \    (224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255).  It extends the ASM service model as\n     \
    \ follows.  Each \"upper layer protocol module\" can now request data\n      sent\
    \ to a host group G by only a specific set of sources, or can\n      request data\
    \ sent to host group G from all BUT a specific set of\n      sources.  Support\
    \ for source filtering is provided by version 3 of\n      the Internet Group Management\
    \ Protocol (or IGMPv3) [3] for IPv4,\n      and version 2 of the Multicast Listener\
    \ Discovery (or MLDv2) [22]\n      protocol for IPv6.  We shall henceforth refer\
    \ to these two\n      protocols as \"SFM-capable\".  Earlier versions of these\n\
    \      protocols - IGMPv1/IGMPv2 and MLDv1 - do not provide support for\n    \
    \  source-filtering, and are referred to as \"non-SFM-capable\".  Note\n     \
    \ that while SFM is a different model than ASM from a receiver\n      standpoint,\
    \ there is no distinction between the two for a sender.\n   For the purpose of\
    \ this document, we treat the scoped multicast model\n   of [12] to be a variant\
    \ of ASM since it does not explicitly restrict\n   the number of sources, but\
    \ only requires that they be located within\n   the scope zone of the group.\n"
- title: 3.  The IGMP/PIM-SM/MSDP/MBGP Protocol Suite for ASM
  contents:
  - "3.  The IGMP/PIM-SM/MSDP/MBGP Protocol Suite for ASM\n   As of this writing,\
    \ all multicast-capable networks support the ASM\n   service model.  One of the\
    \ most common multicast protocol suites for\n   supporting ASM consists of IGMP\
    \ version 2 [2], PIM-SM [8,9], MSDP\n   [13] and MBGP [26].  IGMPv2 is the most\
    \ commonly used protocol for\n   hosts to specify membership in a multicast group,\
    \ and nearly all\n   multicast routers support (at least) IGMPv2.  In case of\
    \ IPv6, MLDv1\n   [21] is the commonly used protocol.\n   Although a number of\
    \ protocols such as PIM-DM [10], CBT [24,11],\n   DVMRP [6], etc. exist for building\
    \ multicast tree among all receivers\n   and sources in the same administrative\
    \ domain, PIM-SM [8,9] is the\n   most widely used protocol.  PIM-SM builds a\
    \ spanning multicast tree\n   rooted at a core rendezvous point or RP for all\
    \ group members within\n   a single administrative domain.  A 'first-hop' router\
    \ adjacent to a\n   multicast source sends the source's traffic to the RP for\
    \ its domain.\n   The RP forwards the data down the shared spanning tree to all\n\
    \   interested receivers within the domain.  PIM-SM also allows receivers\n  \
    \ to switch to a source-based shortest path tree.\n   As of this writing, multicast\
    \ end-hosts with SFM capabilities are not\n   widely available.  Hence a client\
    \ can only specify interest in an\n   entire host group and receives data sent\
    \ from any source to this\n   group.\n   Inter-domain multicast service (i.e.,\
    \ where sources and receivers are\n   located in different domains) requires additional\
    \ protocols - MSDP\n   [13] and MBGP [26] are the most commonly used ones.  An\
    \ RP uses the\n   MSDP protocol to announce multicast sources to RPs in other\
    \ domains.\n   When an RP discovers a source in a different domain transmitting\
    \ data\n   to a multicast group for which there are interested receivers in its\n\
    \   own domain, it joins the shortest-path source based tree rooted at\n   that\
    \ source.  It then redistributes the data received to all\n   interested receivers\
    \ via the intra-domain shared tree rooted at\n   itself.\n   MBGP defines extensions\
    \ to the BGP protocol to support the\n   advertisement of reachability information\
    \ for multicast routes.  This\n   allows an autonomous system (AS) to support\
    \ incongruent unicast and\n   multicast routing topologies, and thus implement\
    \ separate routing\n   policies for each.\n   However, the last-hop routers of\
    \ interested receivers may eventually\n   switch to a shortest-path tree rooted\
    \ at the source that is\n   transmitting the data.\n"
- title: 4.  Problems with Current Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.  Problems with Current Architecture\n   There are several deployment problems\
    \ associated with current\n   multicast architecture:\n      A) Address Allocation:\n\
    \         Address allocation is one of core deployment challenges posed\n    \
    \     by the ASM service model.  The current multicast architecture\n        \
    \ does not provide a deployable solution to prevent address\n         collisions\
    \ among multiple applications.  The problem is much\n         less serious for\
    \ IPv6 than for IPv4 since the size of the\n         multicast address space is\
    \ much larger.  A static address\n         allocation scheme, GLOP [17] has been\
    \ proposed as an interim\n         solution for IPv4; however, GLOP addresses\
    \ are allocated per\n         registered AS, which is inadequate in cases where\
    \ the number of\n         sources exceeds the AS numbers available for mapping.\
    \  RFC 3138\n         expands on RFC 2770 to allow routing registries to assign\n\
    \         multicast addresses from the GLOP space corresponding to the\n     \
    \    RFC 1930 private AS space [27].  This space is referred to as\n         the\
    \ EGLOP (Extended GLOP) address space.  Proposed longer-term\n         solutions\
    \ such as the Multicast Address Allocation Architecture\n         [14] are generally\
    \ perceived as being too complex (with respect\n         to the dynamic nature\
    \ of multicast address allocation) for\n         widespread deployment.\n    \
    \  B) Lack of Access control:\n         In the ASM service model, a receiver cannot\
    \ specify which\n         specific sources it would like to receive when it joins\
    \ a given\n         group.  A receiver will be forwarded data sent to a host group\n\
    \         by any source.  Moreover, even when a source is allocated a\n      \
    \   multicast group address to transmit on, it has no way of\n         enforcing\
    \ that no other source will use the same address.  This\n         is true even\
    \ in the case of IPv6, where address collisions are\n         less likely due\
    \ to the much larger size of the address space.\n      C) Inefficient handling\
    \ of well-known sources:\n         In cases where the address of the source is\
    \ well known in\n         advance of the receiver joining the group, and when\
    \ the\n         shortest forwarding path is the preferred forwarding mode, then\n\
    \         shared tree mechanisms are not necessary.\n"
- title: '5.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM): Benefits and Requirements'
  contents:
  - "5.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM): Benefits and Requirements\n   As mentioned\
    \ before, the Source Specific Multicast (SSM) service\n   model defines a \"channel\"\
    \ identified by an (S,G) pair, where S is a\n   source address and G is an SSM\
    \ destination address.  Channel\n   subscriptions are described using an SFM-capable\
    \ group management\n   protocol such as IGMPv3 or MLDv2.  Only source-based forwarding\
    \ trees\n   are needed to implement this model.\n   The SSM service model alleviates\
    \ all of the deployment problems\n   described earlier:\n      A) Address Allocation:\
    \ SSM defines channels on a per-source basis,\n         i.e., the channel (S1,G)\
    \ is distinct from the channel (S2,G),\n         where S1 and S2 are source addresses,\
    \ and G is an SSM\n         destination address.  This averts the problem of global\n\
    \         allocation of SSM destination addresses, and makes each source\n   \
    \      independently responsible for resolving address collisions for\n      \
    \   the various channels that it creates.\n      B) Access Control: SSM lends\
    \ itself to an elegant solution to the\n         access control problem.  When\
    \ a receiver subscribes to an (S,G)\n         channel, it receives data sent only\
    \ by the source S.  In\n         contrast, any host can transmit to an ASM host\
    \ group.  At the\n         same time, when a sender picks a channel (S,G) to transmit\
    \ on,\n         it is automatically ensured that no other sender will be\n   \
    \      transmitting on the same channel (except in the case of\n         malicious\
    \ acts such as address spoofing).  This makes it much\n         harder to \"spam\"\
    \ an SSM channel than an ASM multicast group.\n      C) Handling of well-known\
    \ sources: SSM requires only\n         source-based forwarding trees; this eliminates\
    \ the need for a\n         shared tree infrastructure.  This implies that neither\
    \ the\n         RP-based shared tree infrastructure of PIM-SM nor the MSDP\n \
    \        protocol is required.  Thus the complexity of the multicast\n       \
    \  routing infrastructure for SSM is low, making it viable for\n         immediate\
    \ deployment.  Note that there is no difference in how\n         MBGP is used\
    \ for ASM and SSM.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.4.  IGMPv3/MLDv2 Host Reporting and Querier\n   In order to use SSM service,\
    \ an end-host must be able to specify a\n   channel address, consisting of a source's\
    \ unicast address and an SSM\n   destination address.  IGMP version 2 [3] and\
    \ MLD version 1 [19]\n   allows an end-host to specify only a destination multicast\
    \ address.\n   The ability to specify an SSM channel address c is provided by\
    \ IGMP\n   version 3 [3] and MLD version 2 [20].  These protocols support\n  \
    \ \"source filtering\", i.e., the ability of an end-system to express\n   interest\
    \ in receiving data packets sent only by SPECIFIC sources, or\n   from ALL BUT\
    \ some specific sources.  In fact, IGMPv3 provides a\n   superset of the capabilities\
    \ required to realize the SSM service\n   model.\n   A detailed discussion of\
    \ the use of IGMPv3 in the SSM destination\n   address range is provided in [4].\n\
    \   The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol used by an IPv6\n   router\
    \ to discover the presence of multicast listeners on its\n   directly attached\
    \ links, and to discover the multicast addresses that\n   are of interest to those\
    \ neighboring nodes.  MLD version 1 is derived\n   from IGMPv2 and does not provide\
    \ the source filtering capability\n   required for the SSM service model.  MLD\
    \ version 2 is derived from,\n   and provides the same support for source-filtering\
    \ as, IGMPv3.  Thus\n   IGMPv3 (or MLDv2 for IPv6) provides a host with the ability\
    \ to\n   request the network for an SSM channel subscription.\n"
- title: 6.5.  PIM-SSM Routing
  contents:
  - "6.5.  PIM-SSM Routing\n   [9] provides guidelines for how a PIM-SM implementation\

    \ in the SSM address range.  In order to comply\n   with [5] several changes to\
    \ the PIM-SM protocol are required, as\n   described in [9].  The most important\
    \ changes in PIM-SM required for\n   compliance with [5] are:\n   -  When a DR\
    \ receives an (S,G) join request with the address G in the\n      SSM address\
    \ range, it MUST initiate a (S,G) join, and NEVER a\n      (*,G) join.\n   - \
    \ Backbone routers (i.e., routers that do not have directly attached\n      hosts)\
    \ MUST NOT propagate (*,G) joins for group addresses in the\n      SSM address\
    \ range.\n   -  Rendezvous Points (RPs) MUST NOT accept PIM Register messages\
    \ or\n      (*,G) Join messages in the SSM address range.\n   Note that only a\

- title: 7.  Interoperability with Existing Multicast Service Models
  contents:
  - "7.  Interoperability with Existing Multicast Service Models\n   Interoperability\
    \ with ASM is one of the most important issues in\n   moving to SSM deployment,\
    \ since both models are expected to be used\n   at least in the foreseeable future.\
    \  SSM is the ONLY service model\n   for the SSM address range - the correct protocol\

    \ be offered for\n   the non-SSM address range, where receivers can issue (*,G)\

    \ if ASM is supported.  [9] specifies operational\n   recommendations to help\
    \ ensure that MSDP does not interfere with the\n   ability of a network to support\
    \ the SSM service model.  Specifically,\n   [9] states that RPs must not accept,\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   SSM does not introduce new security considerations\
    \ for IP multicast.\n   It can help in preventing denial-of-service attacks resulting\
    \ from\n   unwanted sources transmitting data to a multicast channel (S, G).\n\
    \   However no guarantee is provided.\n"
