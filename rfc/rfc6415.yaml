  - "1.  Introduction\n   Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host\
    \ policy or\n   metadata, where \"host\" is not a single resource but the entity\n\
    \   controlling the collection of resources identified by Uniform\n   Resource\
    \ Identifiers (URIs) with a common URI host [RFC3986], which\n   can be served\
    \ by one or more servers.\n   While web protocols have a wide range of metadata\
    \ needs, they often\n   use metadata that is concise, has simple syntax requirements,\
    \ and can\n   benefit from storing their metadata in a common location used by\n\
    \   other related protocols.\n   Because there is no URI or representation available\
    \ to describe a\n   host, many of the methods used for associating per-resource\
    \ metadata\n   (such as HTTP headers) are not available.  This often leads to\
    \ the\n   overloading of the root HTTP resource (e.g., 'http://example.com/')\n\
    \   with host metadata that is not specific or relevant to the root\n   resource\
    \ itself.\n   This document defines a lightweight metadata document format for\n\
    \   describing hosts (thus the name \"host-meta\"), intended for use by\n   web-based\
    \ protocols.  This document also registers the well-known URI\n   suffix \"host-meta\"\
    \ in the Well-Known URI Registry established by\n   [RFC5785].\n   In addition,\
    \ there are times when a host-wide scope for policy or\n   metadata is too coarse-grained.\
    \ host-meta provides two mechanisms for\n   providing resource-specific information:\n\
    \   o  Link Templates - links using a URI template instead of a fixed\n      target\
    \ URI, providing a way to define generic rules for generating\n      resource-specific\
    \ links by applying the individual resource URI to\n      the template.\n   o\
    \  Link-based Resource Descriptor Documents (LRDD, pronounced 'lard')\n      -\
    \ descriptor documents providing resource-specific information,\n      typically\
    \ information that cannot be expressed using link\n      templates.  LRDD documents\
    \ are linked to resources or host-meta\n      documents using link templates with\
    \ the \"lrdd\" relation type.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Example
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Example\n   The following is a simple host-meta document including both\
    \ host-wide\n   and resource-specific information for the 'example.com' host:\n\
    \   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n   <XRD xmlns='http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'>\n\

    \ />\n     <Link rel='author'\n      template='http://example.com/author?q={uri}'\
    \ />\n   </XRD>\n   The host-wide information that applies to the host in its\
    \ entirety\n   provided by the document includes:\n   o  An \"http://protocol.example.net/version\"\
    \ host property with a\n      value of \"1.0\".\n   o  A link to the host's copyright\
    \ policy (\"copyright\").\n   The resource-specific information provided by the\
    \ document includes:\n   o  A link template for receiving real-time updates (\"\
    hub\") about\n      individual resources.  Since the template does not include\
    \ a\n      template variable, the target URI is identical for all resources.\n\
    \   o  A LRDD document link template (\"lrdd\") for obtaining additional\n   \
    \   resource-specific information contained in a separate document for\n     \
    \ each individual resource.\n   o  A link template for finding information about\
    \ the author of\n      individual resources (\"author\").\n"

  - "1.1.1.  Processing Resource-Specific Information\n   When looking for information\
    \ about an individual resource -- for\n   example, the resource identified by\

    \ found, producing the\n   following links:\n    <Link rel='hub'\n     href='http://example.com/hub'\

    \ rel='author'\n        href='http://example.com/john' />\n     </XRD>\n   Together,\
    \ the information available about the individual resource\n   (presented as an\
    \ Extensible Resource Descriptor (XRD) document for\n   illustration purposes)\

    \   than the link found in the LRDD document because the host-meta link\n   appears\
    \ before the \"lrdd\" link.\n   On the other hand, the \"author\" link found in\
    \ the LRDD document has a\n   higher priority than the link found in the host-meta\
    \ document because\n   it appears after the \"lrdd\" link.\n"

    \ included from\n   [RFC3986]: reserved, unreserved, and pct-encoded.\n"
- title: 2.  Obtaining host-meta Documents
  contents:
  - "2.  Obtaining host-meta Documents\n   The client obtains the host-meta document\
    \ for a given host by sending\n   an HTTP [RFC2616] or an HTTPS [RFC2818] GET\
    \ request to the host for\n   the \"/.well-known/host-meta\" path, using the default\
    \ ports defined\n   for each protocol (e.g., port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for\
    \ HTTPS).\n   The scope and meaning of host-meta documents obtained via other\n\
    \   protocols or ports is undefined.\n   The server MUST support at least one\
    \ protocol but MAY support both.\n   If both protocols are supported, they MUST\
    \ produce the same document.\n   The decision as to which protocol is used to\
    \ obtain the host-meta\n   document has significant security ramifications, as\
    \ described in\n   Section 5.\n   For example, the following request is used to\
    \ obtain the host-meta\n   document for the 'example.com' host:\n     GET /.well-known/host-meta\
    \ HTTP/1.1\n     Host: example.com\n   If the server response indicates that the\
    \ host-meta resource is\n   located elsewhere (a 301, 302, or 307 response status\
    \ code), the\n   client SHOULD try to obtain the resource from the location provided\n\
    \   in the response.  This means that the host-meta document for one host\n  \
    \ MAY be retrieved from another host.  Likewise, if the resource is not\n   available\
    \ or does not exist (e.g., a 404 or 410 response status\n   code), the client\
    \ SHOULD infer that metadata is not available via\n   this mechanism.\n   The\
    \ host-meta document SHOULD be served with the\n   \"application/xrd+xml\" media\
    \ type.\n"
- title: 3.  The host-meta Document
  contents:
  - "3.  The host-meta Document\n   The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document\
    \ format as defined by\n   [OASIS.XRD-1.0], which provides a simple and extensible\
    \ XML-based\n   schema for describing resources.  This specification defines\n\
    \   additional processing rules needed to describe hosts.  Documents MAY\n   include\
    \ any elements included in the XRD 1.0 schema that are not\n   explicitly excluded\
    \ by this specification.\n   The server MAY offer alternative representations\
    \ of any XRD document\n   it serves (host-meta, LRDD, or other XRD-based documents).\
    \  The\n   client MAY request a particular representation using the HTTP\n   \"\
    Accept\" request header field.  If no \"Accept\" request header field\n   is included\
    \ with the request, or if the client requests an\n   \"application/xrd+xml\" representation,\
    \ the server MUST respond using\n   the REQUIRED XRD 1.0 XML representation described\
    \ in Section 3.1.\n   Applications using the host-meta document MAY require the\
    \ server to\n   provide a specific alternative representation in addition to the\n\
    \   XRD 1.0 XML representation when explicitly requested by the client.\n   A\
    \ JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Resource Descriptor, known as\n   JRD, is\
    \ described in Appendix A.  It is RECOMMENDED that servers\n   offer the JRD representation\
    \ in addition to the XRD representation.\n"
- title: 3.1.  XML Document Format
  contents:
  - "3.1.  XML Document Format\n   The host-meta document root MUST be an \"XRD\"\
    \ element.  The document\n   SHOULD NOT include a \"Subject\" element, as at this\
    \ time no URI is\n   available to identify hosts.  The use of the \"Alias\" element\
    \ in\n   host-meta is undefined and NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   The subject (or \"context\
    \ IRI\", as defined by [RFC5988]) of the XRD\n   \"Property\" and \"Link\" elements\
    \ is the host described by the host-meta\n   document.  However, the subject of\
    \ \"Link\" elements with a \"template\"\n   attribute is the individual resource\
    \ whose URI is applied to the link\n   template, as described in Section 3.1.1.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  The "Link" Element
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  The \"Link\" Element\n   The XRD \"Link\" element, when used with the\
    \ \"href\" attribute, conveys\n   a link relation between the host described by\
    \ the document and a\n   common target URI.\n   For example, the following link\
    \ declares a common copyright license\n   for the entire scope:\n     <Link rel='copyright'\
    \ href='http://example.com/copyright' />\n   However, a \"Link\" element with\
    \ a \"template\" attribute conveys a\n   relation whose context is an individual\
    \ resource within the host-meta\n   document scope, and whose target is constructed\
    \ by applying the\n   context resource URI to the template.  The template string\
    \ MAY\n   contain a URI string without any variables to represent a resource-\n\
    \   level relation that is identical for every individual resource.\n   For example,\
    \ a blog with multiple authors can provide information\n   about each article's\
    \ author by providing an endpoint with a parameter\n   set to the URI of each\
    \ article.  Each article has a unique author,\n   but all share the same pattern\
    \ of where that information is located:\n     <Link rel='author'\n      template='http://example.com/author?article={uri}'\
    \ />\n"
- title: 3.1.1.1.  Template Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.1.  Template Syntax\n   This specification defines a simple template syntax\
    \ for URI\n   transformation.  A template is a string containing brace-enclosed\n\
    \   (\"{}\") variable names marking the parts of the string that are to be\n \
    \  substituted by the corresponding variable values.\n   Before substituting template\
    \ variables, values MUST be encoded using\n   UTF-8, and any character other than\
    \ unreserved (as defined by\n   [RFC3986]) MUST be percent-encoded per [RFC3986].\n\
    \   This specification defines a single variable -- \"uri\" -- as the\n   entire\
    \ context resource URI.  Protocols MAY define additional\n   relation-specific\
    \ variables and syntax rules, but SHOULD only do so\n   for protocol-specific\
    \ relation types, and MUST NOT change the meaning\n   of the \"uri\" variable.\
    \  If a client is unable to successfully process\n   a template (e.g., unknown\
    \ variable names, unknown or incompatible\n   syntax), the parent \"Link\" element\
    \ SHOULD be ignored.\n   The template syntax ABNF follows:\n    URI-Template =\
    \  *( uri-char / variable )\n    variable     =  \"{\" var-name \"}\"\n    uri-char\
    \     =  ( reserved / unreserved / pct-encoded )\n    var-name     =  %x75.72.69\
    \ / ( 1*var-char ) ; \"uri\" or other names\n    var-char     =  ALPHA / DIGIT\
    \ / \".\" / \"_\"\n   For example:\n    Input:    http://example.com/r?f=1\n \
    \   Template: http://example.org/?q={uri}\n    Output:   http://example.org/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fr%3Ff%3D1\n"
- title: 4.  Processing host-meta Documents
  contents:
  - "4.  Processing host-meta Documents\n   Once the host-meta document has been obtained,\
    \ the client processes\n   its content based on the type of information desired:\
    \ host-wide or\n   resource-specific.\n   Clients usually look for a link with\
    \ a specific relation type or\n   other attributes.  In such cases, the client\
    \ does not need to process\n   the entire host-meta document and all linked LRDD\
    \ documents, but\n   instead process the various documents in their prescribed\
    \ order until\n   the desired information is found.\n   Protocols using host-meta\
    \ must indicate whether the information they\n   seek is host-wide or resource-specific\
    \ -- for example, \"obtain the\n   first host-meta resource-specific link using\
    \ the 'author' relation\n   type\".  If both types are used for the same purpose\
    \ (e.g., first look\n   for resource-specific, then look for host-wide), the protocol\
    \ must\n   specify the processing order.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Host-Wide Information
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Host-Wide Information\n   When looking for host-wide information, the client\
    \ MUST ignore any\n   \"Link\" elements with a \"template\" attribute, as well\
    \ as any link\n   using the \"lrdd\" relation type.  All other elements are scoped\
    \ as\n   host-wide.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Resource-Specific Information
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Resource-Specific Information\n   Unlike host-wide information, which is\
    \ contained solely within the\n   host-meta document, resource-specific information\
    \ is obtained from\n   host-meta link templates, as well as from linked LRDD documents.\n\
    \   When looking for resource-specific information, the client constructs\n  \
    \ a resource descriptor by collecting and processing all the host-meta\n   link\
    \ templates.  For each link template:\n   1.  The client applies the URI of the\
    \ desired resource to the\n       template, producing a resource-specific link.\n\
    \   2.  If the link's relation type is other than \"lrdd\", the client adds\n\
    \       the link to the resource descriptor in order.\n   3.  If the link's relation\
    \ type is \"lrdd\":\n       3.1.  The client obtains the LRDD document by following\
    \ the\n             scheme-specific rules for the LRDD document URI.  If the\n\
    \             document URI scheme is \"http\" or \"https\", the document is\n\
    \             obtained via an HTTP \"GET\" request to the identified URI.\n  \
    \           If the HTTP response status code is 301, 302, or 307, the\n      \
    \       client MUST follow the redirection response and repeat the\n         \
    \    request with the provided location.\n       3.2.  The client adds any links\
    \ found in the LRDD document to the\n             resource descriptor in order,\
    \ except for any link using the\n             \"lrdd\" relation type (processing\
    \ is limited to a single\n             level of inclusion).  When adding links,\
    \ the client SHOULD\n             retain any extension attributes and child elements\
    \ if\n             present (e.g., <Property> or <Title> elements).\n       3.3.\
    \  The client adds any resource properties found in the LRDD\n             document\
    \ to the resource descriptor in order (e.g., <Alias>\n             or <Property>\
    \ child elements of the LRDD document <XRD>\n             root element).\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The host-meta document is designed to be used\

    \ any such\n   application MUST review the specific security implications of using\n\
    \   host-meta documents.  By itself, this specification does not provide\n   any\
    \ protections or guarantees that any given host-meta document is\n   under the\
    \ control of the appropriate entity as required by each\n   application.\n   The\
    \ metadata returned by the host-meta resource is presumed to be\n   under the\
    \ control of the appropriate authority and representative of\n   all the resources\
    \ described by it.  If this resource is compromised\n   or otherwise under the\
    \ control of another party, it may represent a\n   risk to the security of the\
    \ server and data served by it, depending\n   on the applications using it.\n\
    \   Applications utilizing the host-meta document where the authenticity\n   of\
    \ the information is necessary MUST require the use of the HTTPS\n   protocol\
    \ and MUST NOT produce a host-meta document using other means.\n   In addition,\
    \ such applications MUST require that any redirection\n   leading to the retrieval\
    \ of a host-meta document also utilize the\n   HTTPS protocol.\n   Since the host-meta\
    \ document is authoritative for the entire host,\n   not just the authority (combination\
    \ of scheme, host, and port) of the\n   host-meta document server, applications\
    \ MUST ensure that using a\n   host-meta document for another URI authority does\
    \ not represent a\n   potential security exploit.\n   Protocols using host-meta\
    \ templates must evaluate the construction of\n   their templates as well as any\
    \ protocol-specific variables or syntax\n   to ensure that the templates cannot\
    \ be abused by an attacker.  For\n   example, a client can be tricked into following\
    \ a malicious link due\n   to a poorly constructed template that produces unexpected\
    \ results\n   when its variable values contain unexpected characters.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  JRD Document Format
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  JRD Document Format\n   The JRD document format -- a general-purpose\
    \ XRD 1.0 representation\n   -- uses the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format\
    \ defined in\n   [RFC4627].  JRD uses the same elements and processing rules described\n\
    \   in Section 3.1.  The JRD format is designed to include the same base\n   functionality\
    \ provided by the XML format, with the exception of\n   extensibility, as extensibility\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n   specification.\n   The client MAY request a\
    \ JRD representation using the HTTP \"Accept\"\n   request header field with a\
    \ value of \"application/json\".  The server\n   MUST include the HTTP \"Content-Type\"\
    \ response header field with a\n   value of \"application/json\".  Any other \"\
    Content-Type\" value (or lack\n   thereof) indicates that the server does not\
    \ support the JRD format.\n   Alternatively, the client MAY request a JRD representation\
    \ by\n   requesting the \"host-meta.json\" well-known document, by making a GET\n\
    \   request for \"/.well-known/host-meta.json\", following the same process\n\
    \   used for \"/.well-known/host-meta\".  If the server does not support\n   serving\
    \ a JRD representation at this location, the server MUST\n   respond with an HTTP\
    \ 404 (Not Found) status code.\n   XRD elements are serialized into a JSON object\
    \ as follows:\n   o  The XML document declaration and \"XRD\" element are discarded.\n\
    \   o  The \"Subject\" element is included as a name/value pair with the\n   \
    \   name 'subject', and value included as a string.\n   o  The \"Expires\" element\
    \ is included as a name/value pair with the\n      name 'expires', and value included\
    \ as a string.\n   o  \"Alias\" elements are included as a single name/value pair\
    \ with the\n      name 'aliases', and value a string array containing the values\
    \ of\n      each element in order.\n   o  \"Property\" elements are included as\
    \ a single name/value pair with\n      the name 'properties', and value an object\
    \ with each element\n      included as a name/value pair with the value of the\
    \ \"type\"\n      attribute as name, and element value included as a string value.\n\
    \      The values of properties with empty values (i.e., using the\n      REQUIRED\
    \ \"xsi:nil='true'\" attribute) are included as null.  If\n      more than one\
    \ \"Property\" element is present with the same \"type\"\n      attribute, only\
    \ the last instance is included.\n   o  \"Link\" elements are included as a single\
    \ name/value pair with the\n      name 'links', and value an array with each element\
    \ included as an\n      object.  Each attribute is included as a name/value pair\
    \ with the\n      attribute name as name, and value included as a string.\n  \
    \ o  \"Link\" child \"Property\" elements are included using the same\n      method\
    \ as XRD-level \"Property\" elements using a name/value pair\n      inside the\
    \ link object.\n   o  \"Link\" child \"Title\" elements are included as a single\
    \ object with\n      the name 'titles', and value an object with each element\
    \ included\n      as a name/value pair with the value of the \"xml:lang\" attribute\
    \ as\n      name, and element value included as a string value.  The names of\n\
    \      elements without an \"xml:lang\" attribute are added with the name\n  \
    \    'default'.  If more than one \"Title\" element is present with the\n    \
    \  same (or no) \"xml:lang\" attribute, only the last instance is\n      included.\n\
    \   o  The conversion of any other element is left undefined.\n   For example,\
