  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the approval of the 802.11 standard by the IEEE in\
    \ 1997,\n   wireless LANs (WLANs) began a slow entry into enterprise networks.\n\
    \   The limited data rates of the original 802.11 standard, only 1 and 2\n   Mbps,\
    \ limited the widespread adoption of the technology.  802.11\n   found wide deployment\
    \ in vertical applications, such as inventory\n   management, point of sale, and\
    \ transportation management.  Pioneering\n   enterprises began to deploy 802.11,\
    \ mostly for experimentation.\n   In 1999, the IEEE approved the 802.11a and 802.11b\
    \ amendments to the\n   base standard, increasing the available data rate to 54\
    \ and 11 Mbps,\n   respectively, and expanding to a new radio band.  This removed\
    \ one of\n   the significant factors holding back adoption of 802.11 in large\n\
    \   enterprise networks.  These large deployments were bound by the\n   definition\
    \ and functionality of an 802.11 Access Point (AP), as\n   described in the 802.11\
    \ standard.  The techniques required extensive\n   use of layer 2 bridging and\
    \ widespread VLANs to ensure the proper\n   operation of higher layer protocols.\
    \  Deployments of 802.11 WLANs as\n   large as several thousand APs have been\
    \ described.\n   Large deployments of 802.11 WLANs have introduced several problems\n\
    \   that require solutions.  The limitations on the scalability of\n   bridging\
    \ should come as no surprise to the networking community, as\n   similar limitations\
    \ arose in the early 1980s for wired network\n   bridging during the expansion\
    \ and interconnection of wired local area\n   networks.  This document will describe\
    \ the problems introduced by the\n   large-scale deployment of 802.11 WLANs in\
    \ enterprise networks.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   Large WLAN deployments introduce several problems.\
    \  First, each AP is\n   an IP-addressable device requiring management, monitoring,\
    \ and\n   control.  Deployment of a large WLAN will typically double the number\n\
    \   of network infrastructure devices that require management.  This\n   presents\
    \ a significant additional burden to the network\n   administration resources\
    \ and is often a hurdle to adoption of\n   wireless technologies, particularly\
    \ because the configuration of each\n   access point is nearly identical to the\
    \ next.  This near-sameness\n   often leads to misconfiguration and improper operation\
    \ of the WLAN.\n   Second, distributing and maintaining a consistent configuration\n\
    \   throughout the entire set of access points in the WLAN is\n   problematic.\
    \  Access point configuration consists of both long-term\n   static information\
    \ (such as addressing and hardware settings) and\n   more dynamic provisioning\
    \ information (such as individual WLAN\n   settings and security parameters).\
    \  Large WLAN installations that\n   have to update dynamic provisioning information\
    \ in all the APs in the\n   WLAN require a prolonged phase-over time.  As each\
    \ AP is updated, the\n   WLAN will not have a single, consistent configuration.\n\
    \   Third, dealing effectively with the dynamic nature of the WLAN medium\n  \
    \ itself is difficult.  Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium\n   (shared\
    \ with APs in the same WLAN, with APs in other WLANs, and with\n   devices that\
    \ are not APs at all), parameters controlling the wireless\n   medium on each\
    \ AP must be monitored frequently and modified in a\n   coordinated fashion to\
    \ maximize WLAN performance.  This must be\n   coordinated among all the access\
    \ points, to minimize the interference\n   of one access point with its neighbors.\
    \  Manually monitoring these\n   metrics and determining a new, optimum configuration\
    \ for the\n   parameters related to the wireless medium is a task that takes\n\
    \   significant time and effort.\n   Fourth, securing access to the network and\
    \ preventing installation of\n   unauthorized access points is challenging.  Physical\
    \ locations for\n   access points are often difficult to secure since their location\
    \ must\n   often be outside of a locked network closet or server room.  Theft\
    \ of\n   an access point, with its embedded secrets, allows a thief to obtain\n\
    \   access to the resources secured by those secrets.\n   Recently, to address\
    \ some, or all, of the above problems, multiple\n   vendors have begun offering\
    \ proprietary solutions that combine\n   aspects of network switching, centralized\
    \ control and management, and\n   distributed wireless access in a variety of\
    \ new architectures.  Since\n   interoperable solutions allow enterprises and\
    \ service providers a\n   broader choice, a standardized, interoperable interface\
    \ between\n   access points and a centralized controller addressing the problems\n\
    \   seems desirable.\n   In currently fielded devices, the physical portions of\
    \ this network\n   system are one or more 802.11 access points (APs) and one or\
    \ more\n   central control devices, alternatively described as controllers (or\n\
    \   as access controllers, ACs).  Ideally, a network designer would be\n   able\
    \ to choose one or more vendors for the APs and one or more\n   vendors for the\
    \ central control devices in sufficient numbers to\n   design a network with 802.11\
    \ wireless access to meet the designer's\n   requirements.\n   Current implementations\
    \ are proprietary and are not interoperable.\n   This is due to a number of factors,\
    \ including the disparate\n   architectural choices made by the various manufacturers.\
    \  A taxonomy\n   of the architectures employed in the existing products in the\
    \ market\n   will provide the basis of an output document to be provided to the\n\
    \   IEEE 802.11 Working Group.  This taxonomy will be utilized by the\n   802.11\
    \ Working Group as input to their task of defining the\n   functional architecture\
    \ of an access point.  The functional\n   architecture, including descriptions\
    \ of detailed functional blocks,\n   interfaces, and information flow, will be\
    \ reviewed by CAPWAP to\n   determine if further work is necessary to apply or\
    \ develop standard\n   protocols providing for multi-vendor interoperable implementations\
    \ of\n   WLANs built from devices that adhere to the newly appearing\n   hierarchical\
    \ architecture using a functional split between an access\n   point and an access\
    \ controller.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The devices used in WLANs control network access\
    \ and provide for the\n   delivery of packets between hosts using the WLAN and\
    \ other hosts on\n   the WLAN or elsewhere on the Internet.  Therefore, the functions\
    \ for\n   control and provisioning of wireless access points, require\n   protection\
    \ to prevent misuse of the devices.\n   Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity\
    \ requirements should\n   address central management, monitoring, and control\
    \ of wireless\n   access points that should be addressed.  Once an AP and AC have\
    \ been\n   authenticated to each other, a single level of authorization allowing\n\
    \   monitoring, control, and provisioning may not be sufficient.  The\n   requirement\
    \ for more than a single level of authorization should be\n   determined.  Physical\
    \ security should also be addressed for those\n   devices that contain sensitive\
    \ security parameters that might\n   compromise the security of the system, if\
    \ those parameters were to\n   fall into the hands of an attacker.\n   To provide\
    \ comprehensive radio coverage, APs are often installed in\n   locations that\
    \ are difficult to secure.  The CAPWAP architecture may\n   reduce the consequences\
    \ of a stolen AP.  If high-value secrets, such\n   as a RADIUS shared secret,\
    \ are stored in the AC, then the physical\n   loss of an AP does not compromise\
    \ these secrets.  Further, the AC can\n   easily be located in a physically secure\
    \ location.  Of course,\n   concentrating all the high-value secrets in one place\
    \ makes the AC an\n   attractive target, and strict physical, procedural, and\
    \ technical\n   controls are needed to protect the secrets.\n"
