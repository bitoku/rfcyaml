  - "Description\n   All Hebrew text when transferred via e-mail must first be translated\n\
    \   into ISO-8859-8, and then encoded using either Quoted-Printable\n   (preferable)\
    \ or Base64, as defined in MIME.\n   The following table provides the four most\

    \   which is in hexadecimal.\n   ISO 8859-8 8-bit ASCII is also known as IBM Codepage\
    \ 862.\n   The default directionality of the text is visual.  This means that\n\
    \   the Hebrew text is encoded from left to right (even though Hebrew\n   text\
    \ is entered right to left) and is transmitted from left to right\n   via the\
    \ standard MIME mechanisms.  Other methods to control\n   directionality are supported\
    \ and are covered in the complementary RFC\n   1556, \"Handling of Bi-directional\
    \ Texts in MIME\".\n   All discussion regarding Hebrew in email, as well as discussions\
    \ of\n   Hebrew in other TCP/IP protocols, is discussed in the ilan-\n   h@vm.tau.ac.il\
    \ list.  To subscribe send mail to listserv@vm.tau.ac.il\n   with one line of\
    \ text as follows:\n                    subscribe ilan-h firstname lastname\n"
- title: MIME Considerations
  contents:
  - "MIME Considerations\n   Mail that is sent that contains Hebrew must contain the\
    \ following\n   minimum amount of MIME headers:\n         MIME-Version: 1.0\n\
    \         Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8\n         Content-transfer-encoding:\
    \ BASE64 | Quoted-Printable\n   Users should keep their text to within 72 columns\
    \ so as to allow\n   email quoting via the prefixing of each line with a \">\"\
    .  Users\n   should also realize that not all MIME implementations handle email\n\
    \   quoting properly, so quoting email that contains Hebrew text may lead\n  \
    \ to problems.\n   In the future, when all email systems implement fully transparent\
    \ 8-\n   bit email as defined in RFC 1425 and RFC 1426 this standard will\n  \
    \ become partially obsolete.  The \"Content-type:\" field will still be\n   necessary,\
    \ as well as directionality (which might be implicit for\n   8BIT, but is something\
    \ for future discussion),  but the \"Content-\n   transfer-encoding\" will be\
    \ altered to use 8BIT rather than Base64 or\n   Quoted-Printable.\n"
- title: Optional
  contents:
  - "Optional\n   It is recommended, although not required, to support Hebrew encoding\n\
    \   in mail headers as specified in RFC 1522.  Specifically, the Q-\n   encoding\
    \ format is to be the default method used for encoding Hebrew\n   in Internet\
    \ mail headers and not the B-encoding method.\n"
- title: Caveats
  contents:
  - "Caveats\n   Within Israel there are in excess of 40 Listserv lists which will\
    \ now\n   start using Hebrew for part of their conversations.  Normally,\n   Listserv\
    \ will deliver mail from a distribution list with a\n   \"shortened\" header,\
    \ one that does not include the extra MIME headers.\n   This will cause the MIME\
    \ encoding to be left intact and the user\n   agent decoding software will not\
    \ be able to interpret the mail.  Each\n   user is able to customize how Listserv\
    \ delivers mail.  For lists that\n   contain Hebrew, users should send mail to\
    \ Listserv with the following\n   command:\n                             set listname\
    \ full\n   where listname is the name of the list which the user wants full,\n\
    \   unabridged headers to appear.  This will update their private entry\n   and\
    \ all subsequent mail from that list will be with full RFC822\n   headers, including\
    \ MIME headers.\n   In addition, Listserv usually maintains automatic archives\
    \ of all\n   postings to a list.  These archives, contained in the file \"listname\n\
    \   LOGyymm\", do not contain the MIME headers, so all encoding\n   information\
    \ will be lost.  This is a limitation of the Listserv\n   software.\n"
