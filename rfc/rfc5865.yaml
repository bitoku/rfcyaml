  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document requests one Differentiated Services Code
    Point (DSCP)\n   from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class
    of\n   real-time traffic.  This class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding\n   (EF)
    [RFC3246] [RFC3247] Per-Hop Behavior.  It is also admitted using\n   a CAC procedure
    involving authentication, authorization, and capacity\n   admission.  This differs
    from a real-time traffic class that conforms\n   to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop
    Behavior but is not subject to\n   capacity admission or subject to very coarse
    capacity admission.\n   In addition, this document recommends that certain classes
    of video\n   described in [RFC4594] be treated as requiring capacity admission.\n
    \  Real-time traffic flows have one or more potential congestion points\n   between
    the endpoints.  Reserving capacity for these flows is\n   important to application
    performance.  All of these applications have\n   low tolerance to jitter (aka
    delay variation) and loss, as summarized\n   in Section 2, and most (except for
    multimedia conferencing) have\n   inelastic flow behavior from Figure 1 of [RFC4594].
    \ Inelastic flow\n   behavior and low jitter/loss tolerance are the service\n
    \  characteristics that define the need for admission control behavior.\n   One
    of the reasons behind the requirement for capacity admission is\n   the need for
    classes of traffic that are handled under special\n   policies.  Service providers
    need to distinguish between special-\n   policy traffic and other classes, particularly
    the existing Voice\n   over IP (VoIP) services that perform no capacity admission
    or only\n   very coarse capacity admission and can exceed their allocated\n   resources.\n
    \  The requested DSCP applies to the Telephony Service Class described\n   in
    [RFC4594].\n   Since video classes have not had the history of mixing admitted
    and\n   non-admitted traffic in the same Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) as has\n   occurred
    for EF, an additional DSCP code point is not recommended\n   within this document
    for video.  Instead, the recommended \"best\n   practice\" is to perform admission
    control for all traffic in three of\n   the video classes from [RFC4594]:\n   o
    \ The Interactive Real-Time Traffic (CS4, used for Video\n      conferencing and
    Interactive gaming),\n   o  The Broadcast TV (CS3) for use in a video on demand
    context, and\n   o  The AF4 Multimedia Conferencing (video conferencing).\n   Other
    video classes are believed not to have the current problem of\n   confusion with
    unadmitted traffic and therefore would not benefit\n   from the notion of a separate
    DSCP for admitted traffic.  Within an\n   ISP and on inter-ISP links (i.e., within
    networks whose internal\n   paths are uniform at hundreds of megabits per second
    or faster), one\n   would expect all of this traffic to be carried in the Real-Time\n
    \  Traffic (RTP) class described in [RFC5127].\n"

      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
      2119 [RFC2119].\n   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document.\n
      \  PHB:   A Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) is the externally observable\n          forwarding
      behavior applied at a Differentiated Services\n          compliant node to a
      DS behavior aggregate [RFC2475].  It may\n          be thought of as a program
      configured on the interface of an\n          Internet host or router, specified
      in terms of drop\n          probabilities, queuing priorities or rates, and
      other handling\n          characteristics for the traffic class.\n   DSCP:  The
      Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), as defined in\n          [RFC2474],
      is a value that is encoded in the DS field, and\n          that each DS Node
      MUST use to select the PHB that is to be\n          experienced by each packet
      it forwards [RFC3260].  It is a\n          6-bit number embedded into the 8-bit
      TOS (type of service)\n          field of an IPv4 datagram or the Traffic Class
      field of an\n          IPv6 datagram.\n   CAC:   Call Admission Control includes
      concepts of authorization and\n          capacity admission.  \"Authorization\"
      refers to any procedure\n          that identifies a user, verifies the authenticity
      of the\n          identification, and determines whether the user is authorized\n
      \         to use the service under the relevant policy.  \"Capacity\n          Admission\"
      refers to any procedure that determines whether\n          capacity exists supporting
      a session's requirements under some\n          policy.\n          In the Internet,
      these are separate functions; while in the\n          Public Switched Telephone
      Network (PSTN), they and call\n          routing are carried out together.\n
      \  UNI:   A User/Network Interface (UNI) is the interface (often a\n          physical
      link or its virtual equivalent) that connects two\n          entities that do
      not trust each other, and in which one (the\n          user) purchases connectivity
      services from the other (the\n          network).\n          Figure 1 shows
      two user networks connected by what appears to\n          each of them to be
      a single network (\"The Internet\", access to\n          which is provided by
      their service provider) that provides\n          connectivity services to other
      users.\n          UNIs tend to be the bottlenecks in the Internet, where users\n
      \         purchase relatively low amounts of bandwidth for cost or\n          service
      reasons, and as a result are most subject to\n          congestion issues and
      therefore issues requiring traffic\n          conditioning and service prioritization.\n
      \  NNI:   A Network/Network Interface (NNI) is the interface (often a\n          physical
      link or its virtual equivalent) that connects two\n          entities that trust
      each other within limits, and in which the\n          two are seen as trading
      services for value.  Figure 1 shows\n          three service networks that together
      provide the connectivity\n          services that we call \"the Internet\".
      \ They are different\n          administrations and are very probably in competition,
      but\n          exchange contracts for connectivity and capacity that enable\n
      \         them to offer specific services to their customers.\n          NNIs
      may not be bottlenecks in the Internet if service\n          providers contractually
      agree to provision excess capacity at\n          them, as they commonly do.
      \ However, NNI performance may\n          differ by ISP, and the performance
      guarantee interval may\n          range from a month to a much shorter period.
      \ Furthermore, a\n          peering point NNI may not have contractual performance\n
      \         guarantees or may become overloaded under certain conditions.\n          They
      are also policy-controlled interfaces, especially in BGP.\n          As a result,
      they may require a traffic prioritization policy.\n   Queue: There are multiple
      ways to build a multi-queue scheduler.\n          Weighted Round Robin (WRR)
      literally builds multiple lists and\n          visits them in a specified order,
      while a calendar queue\n          (often used to implement Weighted Fair Queuing,
      or WFQ) builds\n          a list for each time interval and queues at most a
      stated\n          amount of data in each such list for transmission during that\n
      \         time interval.  While these differ dramatically in\n          implementation,
      the external difference in behavior is\n          generally negligible when
      they are properly configured.\n          Consistent with the definitions used
      in the Differentiated\n          Services Architecture [RFC2475], these are
      treated as\n          equivalent in this document, and the lists of WRR and
      the\n          classes of a calendar queue will be referred to uniformly as\n
      \         \"queues\".\n                                        _.--------.\n

      \  permits the use of capacity admission in implementing the service,\n   but
      present implementations either provide no capacity admission\n   services or
      do so in a manner that depends on specific traffic\n   engineering.  In the
      context of the Internet backbone, the two are\n   essentially equivalent; the
      edge network depends on specific\n   engineering by the service provider that
      might not be present,\n   especially in a mobile environment.\n   However, services
      are being requested of the network that would\n   specifically make use of capacity
      admission, and would distinguish\n   among users or the uses of available Voice-over-IP
      or Video-over-IP\n   capacity in various ways.  Various agencies would like
      to provide\n   services as described in RFC [RFC4190] or in Section 2.6 of\n
      \  [RFC4504].\n   This requires the use of capacity admission to differentiate

    - "2.1.  Potential Implementations of EF in This Model\n   There are at least
      two possible ways to implement isolation between\n   the Capacity Admitted PHB
      and the Expedited Forwarding PHB in this\n   model.  They are to implement separate
      classes as a set of\n   o  Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting
      of a policer\n      and a queue, with the queues enjoying different priorities,
      or\n   o  Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting of a policer\n
      \     but feeding into a common queue or multiple queues at the same\n      priority.\n
      \  We will explain the difference and describe in what way they differ\n   in
      operation.  The reason this is necessary is that there is current\n   confusion
      in the industry.\n   The multi-priority model is shown in Figure 2.  In this
      model,\n   traffic from each service class is placed into a separate priority\n
      \  queue.  If data is present in more than one queue, traffic from one\n   of
      them will always be selected for transmission.  This has the\n   effect of transferring
      jitter from the higher-priority queue to the\n   lower-priority queues, and
      reordering traffic in a way that gives the\n   higher-priority traffic a smaller
      average queuing delay.  Each queue\n   must have its own policer, however, to
      protect the network from\n   errors and attacks; if a traffic class thinks it
      is carrying a\n   certain data rate but an abuse sends significantly more, the
      effect\n   of simple prioritization would not preserve the lower priorities
      of\n   traffic, which could cause routing to fail or otherwise impact a\n   service
      level agreement (SLA).\n                                                .\n

      queue.  Unlike the multi-\n   priority model, the jitter experienced by the
      traffic classes in this\n   case is the same, as there is only one queue, but

      \  (WFQ, WRR, etc.)\n             Figure 3: Implementation as a Data Plane Policer\n
      \  The difference between the two operationally is, as stated, the\n   issues
      of loss due to policing and distribution of jitter.\n   If the two traffic classes
      are, for example, voice and video,\n   datagrams containing video data can be
      relatively large (often of\n   variable sizes up to the path MTU), while datagrams
      containing voice\n   are relatively small, on the order of only 40 to 200 bytes,
      depending\n   on the codec.  On lower-speed links (less than 10 MBPS), the jitter\n
      \  introduced by video to voice can be disruptive, while at higher\n   speeds,
      the jitter is nominal compared to the jitter requirements of\n   voice.  Therefore,
      at access network speeds, [RFC4594] recommends the\n   separation of video and
      voice into separate queues, while at optical\n   speeds, [RFC5127] recommends
      that they use a common queue.\n   If, on the other hand, the two traffic classes
      are carrying the same\n   type of application with the same jitter requirements,
      then giving\n   one preference in this sense does not benefit the higher-priority\n
      \  traffic and may harm the lower-priority traffic.  In such a case,\n   using
      separate policers and a common queue is a superior approach.\n"

    - "2.2.  Capacity Admission Control\n   There are at least six major ways that
      capacity admission is done or\n   has been proposed to be done for real-time
      applications.  Each will\n   be described below, and Section 3 will judge which
      ones are likely to\n   meet the requirements of the Admitted Telephony service
      class.  These\n   include:\n   o  Drop Precedence used to force sessions to
      voluntarily exit,\n   o  Capacity admission control by assumption or engineering,\n
      \  o  Capacity admission control by call counting,\n   o  Endpoint capacity
      admission performed by probing the network,\n   o  Centralized capacity admission
      control via bandwidth broker, and\n   o  Distributed capacity admission control
      using protocols such as\n      Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) or Next
      Steps in Signaling\n      (NSIS).\n   The problem with dropping traffic to force
      users to hang up is that\n   it affects a broad class of users -- if there is
      capacity for N calls\n   and the N+1 calls are active, data is dropped randomly
      from all\n   sessions to ensure that offered load doesn't exceed capacity.  On\n
      \  very fast links, that is acceptable, but on lower speed links it can\n   seriously
      affect call quality.  There is also a behavioral issue\n   involved here, in
      which users who experience poor quality calls tend\n   to hang up and call again,
      making the problem better -- then worse.\n   The problem with capacity admission
      by assumption, which is widely\n   deployed in today's VoIP environment, is
      that it depends on the\n   assumptions made.  One can do careful traffic engineering
      to ensure\n   needed bandwidth, but this can also be painful, and has to be\n
      \  revisited when the network is changed or network usage changes.\n   The problem
      with call-counting-based admission control is that it\n   gets exponentially
      worse the farther you get from the control point\n   (e.g., it lacks sufficient
      scalability on the outskirts of the\n   network).\n   There are two fundamental
      problems with depending on the endpoint to\n   perform capacity admission: it
      may not be able to accurately measure\n   the impact of the traffic it generates
      on the network, and it tends\n   to be greedy (e.g., it doesn't care).  If the
      network operator is\n   providing a service, he must be able to guarantee the
      service, which\n   means that he cannot trust systems that are not controlled
      by his\n   network.\n   The problem with capacity controls via a bandwidth broker
      is that\n   centralized servers lack far away awareness, and also lack effective\n
      \  real-time reaction to dynamic changes in all parts of the network at\n   all
      instances of time.\n   The problem with mechanisms that do not enable the association
      of a\n   policy with the request is that they do not allow for multi-policy\n
      \  services, which are becoming important.\n   The operator's choice of admission
      procedure MUST, for this DSCP,\n   ensure the following:\n   o  The actual links
      that a session uses have enough bandwidth to\n      support it.\n   o  New sessions
      are refused admission if there is inadequate\n      bandwidth under the relevant
      policy.\n   o  A user is identified and the correct policy is applied if multiple\n
      \     policies are in use in a network.\n   o  Under periods of network stress,
      the process of admission of new\n      sessions does not disrupt existing sessions,
      unless the service\n      explicitly allows for disruption of calls.\n"

    - "2.3.  Recommendations on Implementation of an Admitted Telephony\n      Service
      Class\n   When coupled with adequate Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting
      (AAA) and capacity admission procedures as described in\n   Section 2.2, either
      of the two PHB implementations described in\n   Section 2.1 is sufficient to
      provide the services required for an\n   Admitted Telephony service class.  If
      preemption is required, Section\n   2.3.5.2 of [RFC4542] provides the tools
      for carrying out the\n   preemption.  If preemption is not in view, or if used
      in addition to\n   preemptive services, the application of different thresholds\n
      \  depending on call precedence has the effect of improving the\n   probability
      of call completion by admitting preferred calls at a time\n   when other calls
      are being refused.  Routine and priority traffic can\n   be admitted using the
      same DSCP value, as the choice of which calls\n   are admitted is handled in
      the admission procedure executed in the\n   control plane, not the policing
      of the data plane.\n   On the point of what protocols and procedures are required
      for\n   authentication, authorization, and capacity admission, we note that\n
      \  clear standards do not exist at this time for bandwidth brokers, NSIS\n   has
      not been finalized at this time and in any event is limited to\n   unicast sessions,
      and that RSVP has been standardized and has the\n   relevant services.  We therefore
      RECOMMEND the use of a protocol,\n   such as RSVP, at the UNI.  Procedures at
      the NNI are business matters\n   to be discussed between the relevant networks,
      and are RECOMMENDED\n   but NOT REQUIRED.\n"

    [RFC4594] discussed in this\n   document:\n   Telephony class: The Telephony Service
    Class in RFC 4594 does not\n                    involve capacity admission, but
    depends on\n                    application layer admission that only estimates\n
    \                   capacity, and does that through static engineering.\n                    In
    addition to that class, a separate Admitted\n                    Telephony Class
    is added that performs capacity\n                    admission dynamically.\n

    class consistent\n   with [RFC3246] and [RFC3247] in the \"Differentiated Services
    Field\n   Codepoints\" registry.  It implements the Telephony Service Class\n
    \  described in [RFC4594] at lower speeds and is included in the Real-\n   Time
    Treatment Aggregate [RFC5127] at higher speeds.  The code point\n   value should
    be from pool 1 within the dscp-registry.  The value is\n   parallel with the existing
    EF code point (101110), as IANA assigned\n   the code point 101100 -- keeping

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   A major requirement of this service is effective
    use of a signaling\n   protocol, such as RSVP, with the capabilities to identify
    its user as\n   either an individual or a member of some corporate entity, and
    assert\n   a policy such as \"normal\", \"routine\", or some level of \"priority\".\n
    \  This capability, one has to believe, will be abused by script kiddies\n   and
    others if the proof of identity is not adequately strong or if\n   policies are
    written or implemented improperly by the carriers.  This\n   goes without saying,
    but this section is here for it to be said.\n   Many of the security considerations
    from RFC 3246 [RFC3246] apply to\n   this document, as well as the security considerations
    in RFC 2474 and\n   RFC 4542.  RFC 4230 [RFC4230] analyzes RSVP, providing some
    gap\n   analysis to the NSIS WG as they started their work.  Keep in mind\n   that
    this document is advocating RSVP at the UNI only, while RFC 4230\n   discusses
    (mostly) RSVP from a more complete point of view (i.e., e2e\n   and edge2edge).
    \ When considering the RSVP aspect of this document,\n   understanding Section
    6 of RFC 4230 is a good source of information.\n"
