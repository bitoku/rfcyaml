    \ designing\n   an Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR) that will run BGP\n\
    \   [RFC1267] with other ASBRs external to the AS, and OSPF [RFC1247] as\n   its\
    \ IGP.\n   This document defines how the following fields in OSPF and attributes\n\
    \   in BGP are to be set when interfacing between BGP and OSPF at an\n   ASBR:\n\
    \           OSPF cost and type      vs. BGP INTER-AS METRIC\n           OSPF tag\
    \                vs. BGP ORIGIN and AS_PATH\n           OSPF Forwarding Address\
    \ vs. BGP NEXT_HOP\n   For a more general treatise on routing and route exchange\
    \ problems,\n   please refer to [ROUTE-LEAKING] and [NEXT-HOP] by Philip Almquist.\n\
    \   This document uses the two terms \"Autonomous System\" and \"Routing\n   Domain\"\
    .  The definitions for the two are below:\n   The term Autonomous System is the\
    \ same as is used in the BGP-3 RFC\n   [RFC1267], given below:\n        \"The\
    \ use of the term Autonomous System here stresses the fact\n        that, even\
    \ when multiple IGPs and metrics are used, the\n        administration of an AS\
    \ appears to other ASs to have a single\n        coherent interior routing plan\
    \ and presents a consistent picture\n        of what networks are reachable through\
    \ it.  From the standpoint\n        of exterior routing, an AS can be viewed as\
    \ monolithic:\n        reachability to networks directly connected to the AS must\
    \ be\n        equivalent from all border gateways of the AS.\"\n   The term Routing\
    \ Domain was first used in [ROUTE-LEAKING] and is\n   given below:\n         \
    \ \"A Routing Domain is a collection of routers which coordinate\n          their\
    \ routing knowledge using a single (instance of) a routing\n          protocol.\"\
    \n     This document follows the conventions embodied in the Host\n     Requirements\
    \ RFCs [RFC1122, RFC1123], when using the terms \"MUST\",\n     \"SHOULD\", and\
    \ \"MAY\" for the various requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  Route Exchange
  contents:
  - "2.  Route Exchange\n   This section discusses the constraints that must be met\
    \ to exchange\n   routes between an external BGP session with a peer from another\
    \ AS\n   and internal OSPF routes.\n   BGP does not carry subnet information in\
    \ routing updates.  Therefore,\n   when referring to a subnetted network in the\
    \ OSPF routing domain, we\n   consider the equivalent network route in the context\
    \ of BGP.\n   Multiple subnet routes for a subnetted network in OSPF are collapsed\n\
    \   into one network route when exported into BGP.\n   2.1.  Exporting OSPF routes\
    \ into BGP\n      1.   The administrator MUST be able to selectively export OSPF\n\
    \           routes into BGP via an appropriate filter mechanism.\n           This\
    \ filter mechanism MUST support such control with the\n           granularity\
    \ of a single network.\n           Additionally, the administrator MUST be able\
    \ to filter based\n           on the OSPF tag and the various sub-fields of the\
    \ OSPF tag.\n           The settings of the tag and the sub-fields are defined\
    \ in\n           section 4 in more detail.\n           o    The default MUST be\
    \ to export no routes from OSPF into\n                BGP.  A single configuration\
    \ parameter MUST permit all\n                OSPF inter-area and intra-area routes\
    \ to be exported\n                into BGP.\n                OSPF external routes\
    \ of type 1 and type 2 MUST never be\n                exported into BGP unless\
    \ they are explicitly configured.\n      2.   When configured to export a network,\
    \ the ASBR MUST advertise\n           a network route for a subnetted network,\
    \ as long as at least\n           one subnet in the subnetted network is reachable\
    \ via OSPF.\n      3.   The network administrator MUST be able to statically\n\
    \           configure the BGP attribute INTER-AS METRIC to be used for\n     \
    \      any network route.\n           o    By default, the INTER_AS METRIC MUST\
    \ not be set.  This\n                is because the INTER_AS METRIC is an optional\
    \ attribute\n                in BGP.\n           Explanatory text: The OSPF cost\
    \ and the BGP INTER-AS METRIC\n           are of different widths.  The OSPF cost\
    \ is a two level\n           metric.  The BGP INTER-AS METRIC is only an optional\
    \ non-\n           transitive attribute.  Hence, a more complex BGP INTER-AS\n\
    \           METRIC-OSPF cost mapping scheme is not necessary.\n      4.   When\
    \ an ASBR is advertising an OSPF route to network Y to\n           external BGP\
    \ neighbours and learns that the route has become\n           unreachable, the\
    \ ASBR MUST immediately propagate this\n           information to the external\
    \ BGP neighbours.\n      5.   An implementation of BGP and OSPF on an ASBR MUST\
    \ have a\n           mechanism to set up a minimum amount of time that must elapse\n\
    \           between the learning of a new route via OSPF and subsequent\n    \
    \       advertisement of the route via BGP to the external\n           neighbours.\n\
    \           o    The default value for this setting MUST be 0, indicating\n  \
    \              that the route is to be advertised to the neighbour BGP\n     \
    \           peers instantly.\n                Note that [RFC1267] mandates a mechanism\
    \ to dampen the\n                inbound advertisements from adjacent neighbours.\n\
    \   2.2.  Importing BGP routes into OSPF\n      1.   BGP implementations SHOULD\
    \ allow an AS to control\n           announcements of BGP-learned routes into\
    \ OSPF.\n           Implementations SHOULD support such control with the\n   \
    \        granularity of a single network.  Implementations SHOULD also\n     \
    \      support such control with the granularity of an autonomous\n          \
    \ system, where the autonomous system may be either the\n           autonomous\
    \ system that originated the route or the autonomous\n           system that advertised\
    \ the route to the local system\n           (adjacent autonomous system).\n  \
    \         o    The default MUST be to export no routes from BGP into\n       \
    \         OSPF.  Administrators must configure every route they\n            \
    \    wish to import.\n                A configuration parameter MAY allow an administrator\
    \ to\n                configure an ASBR to import all the BGP routes into the\n\
    \                OSPF routing domain.\n      2.   The administrator MUST be able\
    \ to configure the OSPF cost and\n           the OSPF metric type of every route\
    \ imported into OSPF.\n           o    The OSPF cost MUST default to 1; the OSPF\
    \ metric type\n                MUST default to type 2.\n      3.   Routes learned\
    \ via BGP from peers within the same AS MUST not\n           be imported into\
    \ OSPF.\n      4.   The ASBR MUST never generate a default route into the OSPF\n\
    \           routing domain unless explicitly configured to do so.\n          \
    \ A possible criterion for generating default into an IGP is to\n           allow\
    \ the administrator to specify a set of (network route,\n           AS_PATH, default\
    \ route cost, default route type) tuples.  If\n           the ASBR learns of the\
    \ network route for an element of the\n           set, with the corresponding\
    \ AS_PATH, then it generates a\n           default route into the OSPF routing\
    \ domain, with cost\n           \"default route cost\" and type, \"default route\
    \ type\".  The\n           lowest cost default route will then be injected into\
    \ the OSPF\n           routing domain.\n           This is the recommended method\
    \ for originating default routes\n           in the OSPF routing domain.\n"

- title: 4.  Setting OSPF tags, BGP ORIGIN and AS_PATH attributes
  contents:
  - "4.  Setting OSPF tags, BGP ORIGIN and AS_PATH attributes\n   The OSPF external\
    \ route tag is a \"32-bit field attached to each\n   external route . . . It may\
    \ be used to communicate information\n   between AS boundary routers; the precise\
    \ nature of such information\n   is outside the scope of [the] specification.\"\
    \ [RFC1247]\n   OSPF imports information from various routing protocols at all\
    \ its\n   ASBRs.  In some instances, it is possible to use protocols other than\n\
    \   EGP or BGP across autonomous systems.  It is important, in BGP, to\n   differentiate\
    \ between routes that are external to the OSPF routing\n   domain but must be\
    \ considered internal to the AS, as opposed to\n   routes that are external to\
    \ the AS.\n   Routes that are internal to the AS and that may or may not be\n\
    \   external to the OSPF routing domain will not come to the various BGP\n   speakers\
    \ from other BGP speakers within the same autonomous system\n   via BGP.  Therefore,\
    \ ASBRs running BGP must have knowledge of this\n   class of routes so that they\
    \ can advertise these routes to the\n   various external AS without waiting for\
    \ BGP updates from other BGP\n   speakers within the same autonomous system about\
    \ these routes.\n   Additionally, in the specific instance of an AS intermixing\
    \ routers\n   running EGP and BGP as exterior gateway routing protocols and using\n\
    \   OSPF as an IGP, then within the autonomous system, it may not be\n   necessary\
    \ to run BGP with every ASBR running EGP and not running BGP,\n   if this information\
    \ can be carried in the OSPF tag field.\n   We use the external route tag field\
    \ in OSPF to intelligently set the\n   ORIGIN and AS_PATH attributes in BGP. \
    \ Both the ORIGIN and AS_PATH\n   attributes are well-known, mandatory attributes\
    \ in BGP.  The exact\n   mechanism for setting the tags is defined below.\n  \
    \ The tag is broken up into sub-fields shown below.  The various sub-\n   fields\
    \ specify the characteristics of the route imported into the\n   OSPF routing\

    \      a border router.\n           For backward compatibility, the Automatic\
    \ bit must default to\n           0 and the network administrator must have a\
    \ mechanism to\n           enable automatic tag generation.  Nothing must be inferred\n\
    \           about the characteristics of the OSPF route from the tag\n       \
    \    bits, unless the tag has been automatically generated.\n      o    The Completeness\
    \ characteristic bit is set when the source of\n           the incoming route\
    \ is known precisely, for instance, from an\n           IGP within the local autonomous\
    \ system or EGP at one of the\n           autonomous system's boundaries.  It\
    \ refers to the status of\n           the path information carried by the routing\
    \ protocol.\n      o    The PathLength characteristic sub-field is set depending\
    \ on\n           the length of the AS_PATH that the protocol could have\n    \
    \       carried when importing the route into the OSPF routing\n           domain.\
    \  The length bits will indicate whether the AS_PATH\n           attribute for\
    \ the length is zero, one, or greater than one.\n           Routes imported from\
    \ an IGP will usually have an AS_PATH of\n           length of 0, routes imported\
    \ from an EGP will have an AS_PATH\n           of length 1, BGP and routing protocols\
    \ that support complete\n           path information, either as AS_PATHs or routing\
    \ domain paths,\n           will indicate a path greater than 1.\n           The\
    \ OSPF tag is not wide enough to carry path information\n           about routes\
    \ that have an associated PathLength greater than\n           one.  Path information\
    \ about these routes will have to be\n           carried via BGP to other ASBRs\
    \ within the same AS.  Such\n           routes must not be exported from OSPF\
    \ into BGP.\n   4.2.  Configuration parameters for setting the OSPF tag\n    \

    \ addresses are used to avoid extra hops between multiple\n   routers that share\

    \   Both BGP and OSPF have equivalents of forwarding addresses.  In BGP,\n   the\
    \ NEXT_HOP attribute is a well-known, mandatory attribute.  OSPF\n   has a Forwarding\
    \ address field.  We will discuss how these are to be\n   filled in various situations.\n\
    \   Consider the 4 router situation below:\n   RT1 and RT2 are in one autonomous\
    \ system, RT3 and RT4 are in another.\n   RT1 and RT3 are talking BGP with each\

    \          RT3 MUST always fill the OSPF Forwarding Address with the BGP\n   \
    \       NEXT_HOP attribute for the route to network X.\n     - Exporting network\
    \ Y to BGP:\n          Consider a network Y, internal to the OSPF routing domain,\n\
    \          RT3's route to network Y is via RT4, and network Y is to be\n     \
    \     exported via BGP to RT1.\n          If network Y is not a subnetted network,\
    \ RT3 MUST fill the\n          NEXT_HOP attribute for network Y with the address\
    \ of RT4.\n          This is to avoid requiring packets to take an extra hop\n\
