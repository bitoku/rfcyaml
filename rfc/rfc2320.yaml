  - "1.  Introduction\n  This document is a product of the Internetworking Over NBMA\
    \ Working\n  Group.  Its purpose is to define a MIB module for extending the\n\
    \  traditional MIBs supported by a TCP/IP implementation to support\n  Classical\
    \ IP and ARP over ATM.\n  Many MIB related RFCs and Internet Drafts have been\
    \ considered in the\n  development of this document.  The ones that are considered\
    \ central to\n  the extensions defined by this document are:\n         o RFC 2011\
    \ -  SNMPv2 Management Information Base for the\n                   Internet Protocol\
    \ using SMIv2 [9].  The IP over ATM\n                   (IPOA) MIB provides extensions\
    \ to the IP Group for\n                   handling IP over ATM flows.  A basic\
    \ understanding of\n                   the IP Group is essential for understanding\
    \ this\n                   document.\n         o RFC 2233 - The Interfaces Group\
    \ MIB (IF-MIB) using SMIv2,\n                   reference [2].  This document\
    \ is important since it\n                   provides several very useful enhancements\
    \ over the\n                   interface group defined in RFC 1213 (reference\
    \ [5])\n                   that aid in handling ATM related interfaces.\n    \
    \     o RFC 1695 - Definitions of Managed Objects for ATM Management\n       \
    \            [4] (ATM-MIB).  Support of this MIB is REQUIRED for\n           \
    \        implementing the layers between AAL5 and ATM.  The\n                \
    \   contents of this MIB will not explicitly be addressed\n                  \
    \ here.  The ATM-MIB provides a basis for managing ATM\n                   interface\
    \ layering and management of:\n                    - ATM Switched Virtual Connections\
    \ (SVCs)\n                    - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)\n  The\
    \ ATM Forum UNI ILMI MIB is specified by the ATM Forum in various\n  versions\
    \ of the UNI specification.  The ILMI MIBs being defined are\n  not supported\
    \ via SNMP agents but via SNMP requests sent over an ATM\n  network to an ATM\
    \ entity encapsulated in an AAL5 header.  Support of\n  the ILMI MIB(s) is considered\
    \ out of the scope of this document.\n  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",\
    \ \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n  document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119, reference\n  [10].\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n  The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of seven major\n  components.  They are:\n  o RFC 1902 [1]\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n    describing and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.\n  o RFC 1903 [6] defines textual conventions\
    \ for SNMPv2.\n  o RFC 1904 [8] defines conformance statements for SNMPv2.\n \
    \ o RFC 1905 [7] defines transport mappings for SNMPv2.\n  o RFC 1906 [12] defines\
    \ the protocol operations used for network\n    access to managed objects.\n \
    \ o RFC 1907 [13] defines the Management Information Base for SNMPv2.\n  o RFC\
    \ 1908 [14] specifies coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.\n  The Framework\
    \ permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n  experimentation and\
    \ evaluation.\n  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SNMPv2\
    \ SMI.\n  A semantically identical MIB conforming to the SNMPv1 SMI can be\n \
    \ produced through the appropriate translation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n  defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n  defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\
    \ an administratively assigned name.  The object type\n  together with an object\
    \ instance serves to uniquely identify a\n  specific instantiation of the object.\
    \  For human convenience, we often\n  use a textual string, termed the descriptor,\
    \ to refer to the object\n  type.\n"
- title: 3.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "3.  Structure of the MIB\n  The Classical ARP and IP over ATM (IPOA) MIB structure\
    \ is split into\n  three components:\n    o Basic Support MIB Definitions\n  \
    \  o Client Supported MIB Definitions\n    o Server Supported MIB Definitions\n\
    \  All IP and ARP over ATM entities, both clients and ATMARP Servers, are\n  REQUIRED\
    \ to support the MIB definitions in the Basic Support MIB\n  Definitions section.\
    \  Clients need to additionally support the MIB\n  definitions outlined in the\
    \ Client specific section and ATMARP Servers\n  MUST additionally support the\
    \ ATMARP Server specific MIB definitions.\n  Implementation of the Definitions\
    \ of Managed Objects for ATM\n  Management [4] defines the modeling of the various\
    \ layers within an\n  ATM Interface.  This modeling is assumed as a prerequisite\
    \ for the\n  IPOA-MIB.  The IPOA-MIB makes no assumptions on how this layering\
    \ is\n  actually implemented within a system.  Several of the MIB tables\n  defined\
    \ by the IPOA-MIB, like the base TCP/IP MIBs, require that an\n  ifIndex exist\
    \ that points to an ATM Interface.  Refer to the ATM-MIB\n  [4] for the definition\
    \ of ATM Interface layering.\n  The use of an IP over ATM Virtual Interface layer\
    \ is NOT explicitly\n  REQUIRED by the IPOA-MIB.  The use of virtual layers above\
    \ an ATM-MIB\n  defined interface layer is not absolutely necessary for modeling\
    \ the\n  attachment of IP to an ATM network.  The IPOA-MIB refers to use of a\n\
    \  generic ifIndex object, whose value SHOULD reflect that of some\n  specific\
    \ ATM related interface as determined by an implementation.  It\n  is up to the\
    \ implementers of this MIB to determine their own ATM\n  interface layering (assuming\
    \ compliance with the IF-MIB and the ATM-\n  MIB).\n  The Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA) ifType ipOverAtm(114)\n  was created for use by systems that\
    \ require a virtual IP over ATM\n  interface layer.  The IF-MIB's ifStackTable\
    \ SHOULD be used to show the\n  relationship between virtual IP over ATM interfaces\
    \ and the actual ATM\n  physical interface layers.  The current set of ifType\
    \ values can be\n  accessed via the IANA homepage at: \"http://www.iana.org/iana/\"\
    .\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Basic Support MIB Definitions\n  Basic support that MUST be implemented\
    \ by both Clients and ATMARP\n  Servers consists of:\n    o ATM Logical IP Subnet\

    \ Remote Server Table\n    o ATM VC Table\n    o ATM Config PVC Table\n    o Notifications\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) Table
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) Table\n  The ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS)\
    \ Table defines the subnets that this\n  system is a member of for purposes of\
    \ reaching destinations over an\n  ATM transport.  The LIS table is indexed by\
    \ the subnet address\n  (ipoaLisSubnetAddr) and not ifIndex.  The ipoaLisIfMappingTable\n\
    \  described in the next section provides the mapping between Logical IP\n  Subnets\
    \ and the interface layer.  It is possible that the same LIS can\n  be reached\
    \ via different ATM interfaces.\n  The ipAddrTable and the ipoaClientTable provides\
    \ the mapping from a\n  local IP address to an ATM interface.  One or more ipAddrTable\
    \ entries\n  can point to the same ipoaLisEntry.  An ipAddrEntry's ipAdEntAddr\n\
    \  ANDed with its ipAdEntNetMask SHOULD equal an ipoaLisEntry's\n  ipoaLisSubnetAddr.\
    \  Given that an interface can be multi-homed, each\n  local IP address associated\
    \ with an interface requires an entry in the\n  ipAddrTable.  Each ipAddrTable\
    \ entry for a local IP address associated\n  with an ATM interface SHOULD map\
    \ to an entry in the ipoaLisTable.\n  The bulk of the objects in an ipoaLisEntry\
    \ exists to control ATMARP\n  for a particular LIS. In a PVC only environment\
    \ it is implementation\n  dependent as to whether this table should be supported:\n\
    \         ipoaLisInactivityTimer\n         ipoaLisMinHoldingTime\n         ipoaLisQDepth\n\
    \         ipoaLisMaxCalls\n         ipoaLisCacheEntryAge\n         ipoaLisRetries\n\
    \         ipoaLisTimeout\n  The value of an ipoaLisMaxCalls object defines the\
    \ maximum number of\n  VCs that can be established simultaneously per LIS.  The\
    \ value of an\n  ipoaLisDefaultPeakCellRate object defines the best effort default\
    \ peak\n  cell rate in both the forward and backward directions when\n  establishing\
    \ VCCs (Virtual Channel Connections).  Refer to RFC 1755,\n  ATM Signaling Support\
    \ for IP over ATM (reference [11]), for a\n  definition of the use of this object's\
    \ value.\n  The ipAddrTable's ipAdEntReasmMaxSize is the \"The size of the largest\n\
    \  IP datagram which this entity can re-assemble from incoming IP\n  fragmented\
    \ datagrams received on this interface\" and is different from\n  the ipoaLisTable's\
    \ ipoaLisDefaultMtu with is the default MTU used\n  within an LIS.  Note that\
    \ this is the default MTU, not the actual MTU\n  (which is represented as ipoaVcNegotiatedMtu\
    \ in the ipoaVcTable).\n  The ipoaLisRowStatus object enables entries in the ipoaLisTable\
    \ to be\n  created or deleted via SNMP.  Creation of an ipoaLisTable entry\n \
    \ results in the addition of a corresponding ipAddrTable entry and an\n  ipoaLisIfMappingTable\
    \ entry.  Creation of multiple ipAddrTable entries\n  and ipoaLisIfMappingTable\
    \ entries for the same LIS is not addressed by\n  this document.  When ipoaLisRowStatus\
    \ is changed from active(1) to\n  notInService(2) or from active(1) to destroy(6),\
    \ this has the side-\n  effect of removing all entries from the ipNetToMediaTable\
    \ that are\n  associated with this LIS (in other words, it flushes the entity's\n\
    \  ATMARP cache).  It also removes the ipoaVcTable entries that were\n  associated\
    \ with those ipNetToMediaTable entries.  Destroying the row\n  removes the corresponding\
    \ entries in the ipoaArpSrvrTable,\n  ipoaArpClientTable, ipoaLisIfMappingTable,\
    \ and the\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable.\n  Entries in both the ipNetToMediaTable\
    \ and the ipoaVcTable that are\n  associated with an ipoaConfigPvcEntry are not\
    \ affected by changes to\n  ipoaLisRowStatus.\n"

- title: 3.1.3.  ATMARP Remote Server Table
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  ATMARP Remote Server Table\n  Entries in the ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable exists\
    \ to locally configure the\n  remote ATMARP Servers that exist on a per LIS and\
    \ interface basis.\n  Classical IP and ARP over ATM [3] requires that at least\
    \ one ATMARP\n  Server be configured per LIS where SVC traffic is intended.  PVC\
    \ usage\n  doesn't require use of ATMARP.  No ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable entries\n\
    \  SHOULD be configured for a LIS where only PVCs will be used.  An entry\n  in\
    \ the ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable is indexed by the subnet address of the\n  LIS (ipoaLisSubnetAddr),\
    \ the ATM address of the remote ATMARP Server\n  (ipoaArpRemoteSrvrAtmAddr) and\
    \ an interface ifIndex\n  (ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex) value.\n  The object ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIpAddr\
    \ in an ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry is set\n  with the IP Address of the Remote ATMARP\
    \ Server when a VC to the\n  Remote ATMARP Server is established.  A value of\
    \ 0.0.0.0 SHOULD be\n  used when the IP address of the Remote ATMARP Server is\
    \ not known.\n  Once ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIpAddr is set then the ipoaVcTable can be\n\
    \  searched using ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex and ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIpAddr to\n  find\
    \ the VC in use to the Remote ATMARP Server.\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex is defined\
    \ to have the textual convention of\n  InterfaceIndexOrZero.  Adding ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex\
    \ to the index\n  clause allows a system to have a VC to a ATMARP Remote Server\
    \ on a per\n  LIS and interface basis.  An entry in this table SHOULD exist for\
    \ each\n  interface on a per LIS basis.  Each interface would then have a\n  separate\
    \ VC to the Remote ATMARP Server for ATMARP purposes.\n  An implementation that\
    \ wants to use a single VC MAY use an\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex value of 0 when\
    \ configuring an\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry for the associating LIS.  If\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIfIndex\
    \ is 0 then an implementation dependent method\n  MAY be used for finding the\
    \ VPI and VCI of the VC in use to the Remote\n  ATMARP Server.  For example, search\
    \ the ipoaVcTable for a match\n  between ipNetToMediaNetAddress and ipoaArpRemoteSrvrIpAddr\
    \ from an\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry, ignoring ipNetToMediaIfIndex.  Since a single\n\
    \  VC is being used the first match SHOULD correspond to the correct VC.\n  If\
    \ a PVC is intended to be used to communicate with a remote ATMARP\n  Server then\
    \ the ipoaConfigPvcTable MUST be used to create and activate\n  the PVC prior\
    \ to activating a ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry.\n  The object ipoaArpRemoteSrvrRowStatus\
    \ allows for row creation and\n  deletion of entries in the ipoaArpRemoteSrvrTable.\
    \  The objects\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrAdminStatus and ipoaArpRemoteSrvrOperStatus\
    \ exist to\n  control and reflect the operational use of a Remote ATMARP Server\n\
    \  defined by an ipoaArpRemoteSrvrEntry.  The object\n  ipoaArpRemoteSrvrOperStatus\
    \ SHOULD have a value of up(1) when an SVC\n  has been established to the Remote\
    \ ATMARP Server or if using a PVC\n  when the InATMARP reply with the IP Address\
    \ of the Remote ATMARP\n  Server has been received.  The value of down(2) SHOULD\

    \ ANDed with its corresponding ipAdEntAddr yield the\n  subnet of the LIS which\
    \ can be used as an index into the ipoaLisTable\n  (ipoaLisSubnetAddr).  The ipAddrTable's\
    \ ipAdEntIfIndex points to an\n  interface ifTable entry via an ifIndex value.\
    \  The attachment point\n  for IP into an ATM network is via an ATM interface's\
    \ ifIndex.  Each\n  ipoaArpClientEntry MUST point to an ATM interface via its\n\
    \  corresponding ipAddrEntry.\n  ipoaArpClientAtmAddr is the local ATM address\
    \ associated with the\n  corresponding ATM ifTable entry.  ipoaArpClientSrvrInUse\
    \ is the ATM\n  address of the ATMARP Server being used for a particular client.\
    \  If\n  SVCs are not being used then the value of this object is a zero-length\n\
    \  OCTET STRING.\n  It is sometimes possible for a system to have multiple IP\
    \ addresses\n  configured within the same IP subnet.  The indexing of this table\n\
    \  would seem to preclude that.  However, it is possible to have\n  additional\
    \ entries in the ipAddrTable with the same ifIndex and with\n  the same subnet\
    \ address.  The mechanism for adding these multiple\n  entries to the ipAddrTable\
    \ (which is read-only) is beyond the scope of\n  this document.\n  The counter\
    \ object ipoaArpClientInArpInvalidInReqs is \"The number of\n  times that this\
    \ client detected an invalid InATMARP request.\" This\n  object SHOULD be incremented\
    \ when processing fails for an InATMARP\n  request (e.g., for incorrect InATMARP\
    \ request structure fields).  The\n  object ipoaArpClientInArpInvalidOutReqs is\
    \ defined as \"The number of\n  times that this client did not receive an InATMARP\
    \ reply.\"  This is\n  different from ipoaArpClientArpNoSrvrResps which counts\
    \ the number of\n  times no response was received from an ATMARP request.\n  InATMARP\
    \ retransmission processing is not controlled by objects in the\n  ipoaLisTable.\
    \  In general, the ipoaLisTable objects relate to ATMARP\n  Server processing.\
    \  Configuration of InATMARP retransmission\n  processing is considered to be\
    \ implementation dependent and not\n  defined by the IPOA-MIB.\n  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD use local policy for defining both InATMARP\n  timeout and retry count\
    \ values.  This policy would be expected to\n  differ for sending an InATMARP\
    \ Request over a PVC as opposed to an\n  SVC.  For transmission of an InATMARP\
    \ Request over a SVC a timeout of\n  60 seconds with a retry count of 3 is suggested.\
    \  InATMARP\n  transmission over a PVC should differ since its retry limit may\
    \ need\n  to be infinite in order to ensure that InATMARP Request processing\n\
    \  eventually occurs.\n"

    \ the LIS\n  it is a member of, and various InATMARP and ATMARP statistics.\n\
    \  An entry in this table provides information about an ATMARP Server\n  within\
    \ a LIS and is indexed by ipAdEntAddr (a local IP Address from an\n  IP Address\
    \ Table entry) and ipoaArpSrvrAddr (an ATM Address associated\n  with the ATMARP\
    \ Server).\n  Entries MAY be created by a management application using the\n \
    \ ipoaArpSrvrRowStatus object.  Entries in this table MAY also be\n  created by\
    \ the system and not by a management application, for example\n  via ILMI.\n \
    \ Entries in this table MAY be deleted by setting the\n  ipoaArpSrvrRowStatus\
    \ object to destroy(6).  This includes entries that\n  were added by the system\

    \ Servers where the local IP\n  address being associated with each ATMARP Server\
    \ is the same (for\n  example a non-multihomed host), the ATM Address (ipoaArpSrvrAddr)\n\
    \  uniquely identifies a particular ATMARP Server.  On a host supporting\n  multiple\
    \ ATMARP Servers having a single ATM Interface with a single\n  ATM Address, the\
    \ ipAdEntAddr MUST be used to uniquely identify an\n  entry in the ipoaArpSrvrTable.\n\

    \ or no local IP Address (ipAdEntAddr) and the same ATM Address\n  (ipoaArpSrvrAddr)\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n  Certain management information defined in this\
    \ MIB MAY be considered\n  sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore,\
    \ authentication of\n  received SNMP requests and controlled access to management\
    \ information\n  SHOULD be employed in such environments.  The method for this\n\
    \  authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative Framework, and\n  has\
    \ not been expanded by this MIB.\n  Several objects in this MIB allow write access\
    \ or provide for row\n  creation.  Allowing this support in a non-secure environment\
    \ can have\n  a negative effect on network operations.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n\
    \  implementers seriously consider whether set operations or row creation\n  be\
    \ allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication of request\n  origin.\
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that without such support that the\n  following objects be\
    \ implemented as read-only:\n      o ipoaLisDefaultMtu\n      o ipoaLisDefaultEncapsType\n\
    \      o ipoaLisInactivityTimer\n      o ipoaLisMinHoldingTime\n      o ipoaLisQDepth\n\

    \      o ipoaArpSrvrLis\n      o ipoaArpRemoteSrvrAdminStatus, show status as\
    \ being either\n        up(1) when a VC exists to the Remote ATMARP Server or\n\
    \        otherwise down(2).  Don't allow set support.\n        ipoaArpRemoteSrvrOperStatus\
