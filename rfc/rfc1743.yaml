  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing\n   subnetworks\
    \ which use the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring technology described\n   in 802.5 Token\
    \ Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications,\n   IEEE Standard 802.5-1989\
    \ [7].  This memo is a replacement for RFC\n   1231.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n           describing\
    \ and naming objects for the purpose of management.\n      o    STD 17, RFC 1213\
    \ [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n           objects for the Internet\
    \ suite of protocols.\n      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative\
    \ and other\n           architectural aspects of the framework.\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network\n           access to managed\
    \ objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This memo defines three tables: the 802.5 Interface Table, which\n\
    \   contains state and parameter information which is specific to 802.5\n   interfaces,\
    \ the 802.5 Statistics Table, which contains 802.5\n   interface statistics, and\
    \ the 802.5 Timer Table, which contains the\n   values of 802.5-defined timers.\
    \ A managed system will have one entry\n   in the 802.5 Interface Table and one\
    \ entry in the 802.5 Statistics\n   Table for each of its 802.5 interfaces.  The\
    \ 802.5 Timer Table is\n   obsolete, but its definition has been retained in this\
    \ memo for\n   backward compatibility.\n   This memo also defines OBJECT IDENTIFIERs,\
    \ some to identify interface\n   tests for use with the ifTestTable [6], and some\
    \ to identify Token\n   Ring interface Chip Sets.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MAC Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MAC Addresses\n   All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module\
    \ use the\n   MacAddress textual convention [5] for which the address is in the\n\
    \   \"canonical\" order defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were\n   transmitted\
    \ least significant bit first, even though 802.5 requires\n   MAC addresses to\
    \ be transmitted most significant bit first.\n   16-bit addresses, if needed,\
    \ are represented by setting their upper 4\n   octets to all zeros, i.e., AAFF\
    \ would be represented as 00000000AAFF.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1213
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1213\n   When this MIB module is used in conjunction\
    \ with the \"old\" (i.e.,\n   pre-RFC 1573) interfaces group, the relationship\
    \ between an 802.5\n   interface and an interface in the context of the RFC 1213\
    \ is one-\n   to-one.  That is, the value of an ifIndex object instance for an\n\
    \   802.5 interface can be directly used to identify corresponding\n   instances\
    \ of the objects defined in this memo.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1573
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1573\n   RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires\
    \ that any MIB module\n   which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific\
    \ areas\n   within the Interface MIB.  These areas were intentionally left vague\n\
    \   in RFC 1573 to avoid over constraining the MIB module, thereby\n   precluding\
    \ management of certain media-types.\n   Section 3.3 of RFC 1573 enumerates several\
    \ areas which a media-\n   specific MIB module must clarify.  Each of these areas\
    \ is addressed\n   in a following subsection.  The implementor is referred to\
    \ RFC 1573\n   in order to understand the general intent of these areas.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Layering Model
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Layering Model\n   For the typical usage of this IEEE 802.5 MIB module,\
    \ there will be no\n   sub-layers \"above\" or \"below\" the 802.5 interface.\
    \  However, this MIB\n   module does not preclude such layering.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  Virtual Circuits\n   802.5 does not support virtual circuits.\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  ifTestTable
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  ifTestTable\n   This MIB module defines two tests for 802.5 interfaces:\
    \ Insertion and\n   Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not required.\n"
- title: 3.3.4.  ifRcvAddressTable
  contents:
  - "3.3.4.  ifRcvAddressTable\n   The ifRcvAddressTable is defined to contains all\
    \ MAC addresses,\n   unicast, multicast (group) and broadcast, for which an interface\
    \ will\n   receive packets.  For 802.5 interfaces, its use includes functional\n\
    \   addresses. The format of the address, contained in\n   ifRcvAddressAddress,\
    \ is the same as for ifPhysAddress.\n   For functional addresses on a particular\
    \ 802.5 interface, only one\n   ifRcvAddressTable entry is required.  That entry\
    \ is the one for the\n   address which has the functional address bit ANDed with\
    \ the bit mask\n   of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept\n\
    \   frames.\n"
- title: 3.3.5.  ifPhysAddress
  contents:
  - "3.3.5.  ifPhysAddress\n   For an 802.5 interface, ifPhysAddress contains the\
    \ interface's IEEE\n   MAC address, stored as an octet string of length 6, in\
    \ IEEE 802.1a\n   \"canonical\" order, i.e., the Group Bit is positioned as the\
    \ low-order\n   bit (0x01) of the first octet.\n"
- title: 3.3.6.  ifType
  contents:
  - "3.3.6.  ifType\n   The objects defined in this memo apply to each interface for\
    \ which\n   the ifType has the value:\n                  iso88025-tokenRing(9)\n"

  contents:
  - "APPENDIX A - Changes from RFC 1231\n   This memo has the following differences\
    \ from RFC 1231:\n   (1)  This memo is formatted using the SNMPv2 SMI.\n   (2)\
    \  The relationship of the \"open\" and \"close\" states of\n        dot5Commands\
    \ to the value of ifAdminStatus has been\n        clarified.  In particular, the\
    \ setting of one affects the\n        value of the other.\n   (3)  The relationship\
    \ dot5RingSpeed and ifSpeed has been\n        clarified.  In particular, ifSpeed\
    \ indicates the current\n        ring-speed; dot5RingSpeed indicates the ring-speed\
    \ at the\n        next insertion into the ring.  If the interface doesn't\n  \
    \      support changing ring-speed, then dot5RingSpeed can only be\n        set\
    \ to its current value.  When dot5RingSpeed has the value\n        'unknown(1)',\
    \ the ring-speed is to be set to the ring's\n        actual ring-speed.\n   (4)\
    \  Write-access to dot5ActMonParticipate is not required, and a\n        change\
    \ to the value of dot5ActMonParticipate does not take\n        effect until the\
    \ next Active Monitor election.\n   (5)  Write-access to dot5Functional is not\
    \ required.\n   (6)  A new object, dot5LastBeaconSent has been defined to contain\n\
    \        the timestamp of the last beacon frame sent.\n   (7)  The dot5TimerTable\
    \ has been designated as obsolete.\n   (8)  Text has been added describing the\
    \ applicability of RFC 1573\n        [6] to 802.5 interfaces.\n   (9)  Other minor\
    \ editorial changes.\n"
