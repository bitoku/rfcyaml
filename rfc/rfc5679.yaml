  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE 802.21 [IEEE802.21] defines three distinct service
    types to\n   facilitate link-layer handovers across heterogeneous technologies:\n
    \  a) MIH Information Service (MIHIS)\n      IS provide a unified framework to
    the higher-layer entities across\n      the heterogeneous network environment
    to facilitate discovery and\n      selection of multiple types of networks existing
    within a\n      geographical area, with the objective to help the higher-layer\n
    \     mobility protocols to acquire a global view of the heterogeneous\n      networks
    and perform seamless handover across these networks.\n   b) MIH Event Service
    (MIHES)\n      Events may indicate changes in state and transmission behavior
    of\n      the physical, data link and logical link layers, or predict state\n
    \     changes of these layers.  The Event Services may also be used to\n      indicate
    management actions or command status on the part of the\n      network or some
    management entity.\n   c) MIH Command Service (MIHCS)\n      The command service
    enables higher layers to control the physical,\n      data link, and logical link
    layers.  The higher layers may control\n      the reconfiguration or selection
    of an appropriate link through a\n      set of handover commands.\n   In IEEE
    terminology, these services are called Media Independent\n   Handover (MIH) services.
    \ While these services may be co-located, the\n   different pattern and type of
    information they provide do not\n   necessitate the co-location.\n   \"Service
    Management\" service messages, i.e., MIH registration, MIH\n   capability discovery
    and MIH event subscription messages, are\n   considered as MIHES and MIHCS when
    transporting MIH messages over L3\n   transport.\n   A Mobile Node (MN) may make
    use of any of these MIH service types\n   separately or any combination of them.\n
    \  It is anticipated that a Mobility Server will not necessarily host\n   all
    three of these MIH services together, thus there is a need to\n   discover the
    MIH service types separately.\n   This document defines a number of application
    service tags that allow\n   service location without relying on rigid domain naming
    conventions.\n"

  - "2.  Discovering a Mobility Server\n   The Dynamic Delegation Discovery System
    (DDDS) [RFC3401] is used to\n   implement lazy binding of strings to data, in
    order to support\n   dynamically configured delegation systems.  The DDDS functions
    by\n   mapping some unique string to data stored within a DDDS database by\n   iteratively
    applying string transformation rules until a terminal\n   condition is reached.
    \ When DDDS uses DNS as a distributed database\n   of rules, these rules are encoded
    using the Naming Authority Pointer\n   (NAPTR) Resource Record (RR).  One of these
    rules is the First Well\n   Known Rule, which says where the process starts.\n
    \  In current specifications, the First Well Known Rule in a DDDS\n   application
    [RFC3403] is assumed to be fixed, i.e., the domain in the\n   tree where the lookups
    are to be routed to, is known.  This document\n   proposes the input to the First
    Well Known Rule to be dynamic, based\n   on the search path the resolver discovers
    or is configured with.\n   The search path of the resolver can either be pre-configured,\n
    \  discovered using DHCP, or learned from a previous MIH Information\n   Services
    (IS) query [IEEE802.21] as described in [RFC5677].\n   When the MN needs to discover
    Mobility Services in its home domain,\n   the input to the First Well Known Rule
    MUST be the MN's home domain,\n   which is assumed to be pre-configured in the
    MN.\n   When the MN needs to discover Mobility Services in a local (visited)\n
    \  domain, it SHOULD use DHCP as described in [RFC5678] to discover the\n   IP
    address of the server hosting the desired service, and contact it\n   directly.
    \ In some instances, the discovery may result in a per\n   protocol/application
    list of domain names that are then used as\n   starting points for the subsequent
    NAPTR lookups.  If neither the IP\n   address or domain name can be discovered
    with the above procedure,\n   the MN MAY request a domain search list, as described
    in [RFC3397]\n   and [RFC3646], and use it as input to the DDDS application.\n
    \  The MN may also have a list of cached domain names of Service\n   Providers,
    learned from a previous MIH Information Services (IS)\n   query [IEEE802.21].
    \ If the cache entries have not expired, they can\n   be used as input to the
    DDDS application.\n   When the MN does not find valid domain names using the procedures\n
    \  above, it MUST stop any attempt to discover MIH services.\n   The dynamic rule
    described above SHOULD NOT be used for discovering\n   services other than MIH
    services described in this document, unless\n   stated otherwise by a future specification.\n
    \  The procedures defined here result in an IP address, port, and\n   transport
    protocol where the MN can contact the Mobility Server that\n   hosts the service
    the MN is looking for.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Selecting a Mobility Service\n   The MN should know the characteristics
      of the Mobility Services\n   defined in [IEEE802.21], and based on that, it
      should be able to\n   select the service it wants to use to facilitate its handover.
      \ The\n   services it can choose from are:\n      - Information Services (MIHIS)\n
      \     - Event Services (MIHES)\n      - Command Services (MIHCS)\n   The service
      identifiers for the services are \"MIHIS\", \"MIHES\", and\n   \"MIHCS\", respectively.
      \ The server supporting any of the above\n   services MUST support at least
      UDP and TCP as transport, as described\n   in [RFC5677].  SCTP and other transport
      protocols MAY also be\n   supported.\n"
    title: 2.1.  Selecting a Mobility Service
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Selecting the Transport Protocol\n   After the desired service has been
      chosen, the client selects the\n   transport protocol it prefers to use.  Note
      that transport selection\n   may impact the handover performance.\n   The services
      relevant for the task of transport protocol selection\n   are those with NAPTR
      service fields with values \"ID+M2X\", where ID is\n   the service identifier
      defined in the previous section, and X is a\n   letter that corresponds to a
      transport protocol supported by the\n   domain.  This specification defines
      M2U for UDP, M2T for TCP and M2S\n   for SCTP.  This document also establishes
      an IANA registry for\n   mappings of NAPTR service name to transport protocol.\n
      \  These NAPTR [RFC3403] records provide a mapping from a domain to the\n   SRV
      [RFC2782] record for contacting a server with the specific\n   transport protocol
      in the NAPTR services field.  The resource record\n   MUST contain an empty
      regular expression and a replacement value,\n   which indicates the domain name
      where the SRV record for that\n   particular transport protocol can be found.
      \ If the server supports\n   multiple transport protocols, there will be multiple
      NAPTR records,\n   each with a different service value.  As per [RFC3403], the
      client\n   discards any records whose services fields are not applicable.\n
      \  The MN MUST discard any service fields that identify a resolution\n   service
      whose value is not \"M2X\", for values of X that indicate\n   transport protocols
      supported by the client.  The NAPTR processing as\n   described in RFC 3403
      will result in the discovery of the most\n   preferred transport protocol of
      the server that is supported by the\n   client, as well as an SRV record for
      the server.\n   As an example, consider a client that wishes to find MIHIS service
      in\n   the example.com domain.  The client performs a NAPTR query for that\n
      \  domain, and the following NAPTR records are returned:\n           Order Pref
      Flags  Service     Regexp       Replacement\n   IN NAPTR  50   50   \"s\"  \"MIHIS+M2T\"
      \   \"\"  _MIHIS._tcp.example.com\n   IN NAPTR  90   50   \"s\"  \"MIHIS+M2U\"
      \   \"\"  _MIHIS._udp.example.com\n   This indicates that the domain does have
      a server providing MIHIS\n   services over TCP and UDP, in that order of preference.
      \ Since the\n   client supports TCP and UDP, TCP will be used, targeted to a
      host\n   determined by an SRV lookup of _MIHIS._tcp.example.com.  That lookup\n
      \  would return:\n   ;;          Priority  Weight    Port        Target\n        IN
      \ SRV    0        1      XXXX   server1.example.com\n        IN  SRV    0        2
      \     XXXX   server2.example.com\n   where XXXX represents the port number at
      which the service is\n   reachable.\n   If no NAPTR records are found, the client
      constructs SRV queries for\n   those transport protocols it supports, and does
      a query for each.\n   Queries are done using the service identifier \"_MIHIS\"
      for the MIH\n   Information Service, \"_MIHES\" for the MIH Event Service and
      \"_MIHCS\"\n   for the MIH Command Service.  A particular transport is supported
      if\n   the query is successful.  The client MAY use any transport protocol\n
      \  it desires that is supported by the server.\n   Note that the regexp field
      in the NAPTR example above is empty.  The\n   regexp field MUST NOT be used
      when discovering MIH services, as its\n   usage can be complex and error prone.
      \ Also, the discovery of the MIH\n   services does not require the flexibility
      provided by this field over\n   a static target present in the TARGET field.\n
      \  If the client is already configured with the information about which\n   transport
      protocol is used for a mobility service in a particular\n   domain, it can directly
      perform an SRV query for that specific\n   transport using the service identifier
      of the Mobility Service.  For\n   example, if the client knows that it should
      be using TCP for MIHIS\n   service, it can perform a SRV query directly for\n
      \  _MIHIS._tcp.example.com.\n"

    - "2.3.  Determining the IP Address and Port\n   Once the server providing the
      desired service and the transport\n   protocol has been determined, the next
      step is to determine the IP\n   address and port.\n   The response to the SRV
      DNS query contains the port number in the\n   Port field of the SRV RDATA.\n
      \  According to the specification of SRV RRs in [RFC2782], the TARGET\n   field
      is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that MUST have one or\n   more address
      records; the FQDN must not be an alias, i.e., there MUST\n   NOT be a CNAME
      or DNAME RR at this name.  Unless the SRV DNS query\n   already has reported
      a sufficient number of these address records in\n   the Additional Data section
      of the DNS response (as recommended by\n   [RFC2782]), the MN needs to perform
      A and/or AAAA record lookup(s) of\n   the domain name, as appropriate.  The
      result will be a list of IP\n   addresses, each of which can be contacted using
      the transport\n   protocol determined previously.\n"

    protocols is to be maintained by IANA.\n   The registration in the RFC MUST include

- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   A list of known threats to services using DNS
    is documented in\n   [RFC3833].  For most of those identified threats, the DNS
    Security\n   Extensions [RFC4033] does provide protection.  It is therefore\n
    \  recommended to consider the usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] and the aspects\n   of
    DNSSEC Operational Practices [RFC4641] when deploying IEEE 802.21\n   Mobility
    Services.\n   In deployments where DNSSEC usage is not feasible, measures should
    be\n   taken to protect against forged DNS responses and cache poisoning as\n
    \  much as possible.  Efforts in this direction are documented in\n   [RFC5452].\n
    \  Where inputs to the procedure described in this document are fed via\n   DHCP,
    DHCP vulnerabilities can also cause issues.  For instance, the\n   inability to
    authenticate DHCP discovery results may lead to the\n   mobility service results
    also being incorrect, even if the DNS\n   process was secured.\n"
