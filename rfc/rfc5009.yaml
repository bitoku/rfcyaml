- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the use of the P-Early-Media header\
    \ field for\n   use within SIP [1] messages in certain SIP networks to authorize\
    \ the\n   cut-through of backward and/or forward early media when permitted by\n\
    \   the early media policies of the networks involved.  The P-Early-Media\n  \
    \ header field is intended for use in a SIP network, such as a 3GPP IMS\n   [13][14]\
    \ that has the following characteristics: its early media\n   policy prohibits\
    \ the exchange of early media between end users; it is\n   interconnected with\
    \ other SIP networks that have unknown, untrusted,\n   or different policies regarding\
    \ early media; and it has the\n   capability to \"gate\" (enable/disable) the\
    \ flow of early media to/from\n   user equipment.\n   Within an isolated SIP network,\
    \ it is possible to gate early media\n   associated with all endpoints within\
    \ the network to enforce a desired\n   early media policy among network endpoints.\
    \  However, when a SIP\n   network is interconnected with other SIP networks,\
    \ only the boundary\n   node connected to the external network can determine which\
    \ early\n   media policy to apply to a session established between endpoints on\n\
    \   different sides of the boundary.  The P-Early-Media header field\n   provides\
    \ a means for this boundary node to communicate this early\n   media policy decision\
    \ to other nodes within the network.\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability Statement\n   The use of this extension is only applicable\
    \ inside a \"Trust Domain\"\n   as defined in RFC 3325 [6].  Nodes in such a Trust\
    \ Domain are\n   explicitly trusted by its users and end-systems to authorize\
    \ early\n   media requests only when allowed by early media policy within the\n\
    \   Trust Domain.\n   This document does NOT offer a general early media authorization\n\
    \   model suitable for inter-domain use or use in the Internet at large.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ since the early media requests are not cryptographically\n   certified, they\
    \ are subject to forgery, replay, and falsification in\n   any architecture that\
    \ does not meet the requirements of the Trust\n   Domain.\n   An early media request\
    \ also lacks an indication of who specifically\n   is making or modifying the\
    \ request, and so it must be assumed that\n   the Trust Domain is making the request.\
    \  Therefore, the information\n   is only meaningful when securely received from\
    \ a node known to be a\n   member of the Trust Domain.\n   Although this extension\
    \ can be used with parallel forking, it does\n   not improve on the known problems\
    \ with early media and parallel\n   forking, as described in RFC 3960 [4], unless\
    \ one can assume the use\n   of symmetric RTP.\n   Despite these limitations,\
    \ there are sufficiently useful specialized\n   deployments that meet the assumptions\
    \ described above, and can accept\n   the limitations that result, to warrant\
    \ publication of this\n   mechanism.  An example deployment would be a closed\
    \ network that\n   emulates a traditional circuit switched telephone network.\n"

- title: 4.  Background on Early Media Authorization
  contents:
  - "4.  Background on Early Media Authorization\n   PSTN networks typically provide\
    \ call progress information as backward\n   early media from the terminating switch\
    \ towards the calling party.\n   PSTN networks also use forward early media from\
    \ the calling party\n   towards the terminating switch under some circumstances\
    \ for\n   applications, such as digit collection for secondary dialing.  PSTN\n\
    \   networks typically allow backward and/or forward early media since\n   they\
    \ are used for the purpose of progressing the call to the answer\n   state and\
    \ do not involve the exchange of data between endpoints.\n   In a SIP network,\
    \ backward early media flows from the User Agent\n   Server (UAS) towards the\
    \ User Agent Client (UAC).  Forward early\n   media flows from the UAC towards\
    \ the UAS.  SIP networks by default\n   allow both forms of early media, which\
    \ may carry user data, once the\n   media path is established.  Early media is\
    \ typically desirable with a\n   PSTN gateway as UAS, but not with SIP user equipment\
    \ as UAS.\n   To prevent the exchange of user data within early media while\n\
    \   allowing early media via PSTN gateways, a SIP network may have a\n   policy\
    \ to prohibit backward early media from SIP user equipment and\n   to prohibit\
    \ forward media towards SIP user equipment, either of which\n   may contain user\
    \ data.  A SIP network containing both PSTN gateways\n   and SIP end devices,\
    \ for example, can maintain such an early media\n   policy by gating \"off\" any\
    \ early media with a SIP end device acting\n   as UAS, gating \"on\" early media\
    \ with a SIP end device acting as UAC,\n   and gating \"on\" early media at each\
    \ PSTN gateway.\n   Unfortunately, a SIP network interconnected with another SIP\
    \ network\n   may have no means of assuring that the interconnected network is\n\
    \   implementing a compatible early media policy, thus allowing the\n   exchange\
    \ of user data within early media under some circumstances.\n   For example, if\
    \ a network \"A\" allows all early media with user\n   equipment as UAC and an\
    \ interconnected network \"B\" allows all early\n   media with user equipment\
    \ as UAS, any session established between\n   user equipment as UAC in \"A\" and\
    \ user equipment as UAS in \"B\" will\n   allow bidirectional user data exchange\
    \ as early media.  Other\n   combinations of early media policies may also produce\
    \ similar\n   undesirable results.\n   The purpose of the extension is to allow\
    \ a SIP network interconnected\n   to other SIP networks with different early\
    \ media policies to\n   correctly identify and enable authorized early media according\
    \ to its\n   policies.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Backward Early Media
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Backward Early Media\n   Backward early media in the PSTN typically comprises\
    \ call progress\n   information, such as ringing feedback (\"ringback\"), or announcements\n\
    \   regarding special handling such as forwarding.  It may also include\n   requests\
    \ for further information, such as a credit card number to be\n   entered as forward\
    \ early media in the form of Dual Tone Multi-\n   Frequency (DTMF) tones or speech.\
    \  Backward early media of this type\n   provides information to the calling party\
    \ strictly for the purpose of\n   progressing the call and involves no exchange\
    \ of data between end\n   users.  The usual PSTN charging policy assumes that\
    \ no data is\n   exchanged between users until the call has been answered.\n \
    \  A terminating SIP User Agent (UA) outside of the SIP network, on the\n   other\
    \ hand, may provide any user data in a backward early media\n   stream.  Thus,\
    \ if the network implements the usual early media\n   policy, the network equipment\
    \ gating the backward early media flow\n   for the originating UA must distinguish\
    \ between authorized early\n   media from a terminating SIP endpoint and unauthorized\
    \ early media\n   from another SIP device outside of the network.  Given the assumption\n\
    \   of a transitive trust relationship between SIP servers in the\n   network,\
    \ this can be accomplished by including some information in a\n   backward SIP\
    \ message that identifies the presence of authorized\n   backward early media.\
    \  Since it is necessary to verify that this\n   indication comes from a trusted\
    \ source, it is necessary for each\n   server on the path back to the originating\
    \ UA to be able to verify\n   the trust relationship with the previous server\
    \ and to remove such an\n   indication when it cannot do so.  A server on the\
    \ boundary to an\n   untrusted SIP network can assure that no indication of authorized\n\
    \   backward early media passes from an external UAS to a UAC within the\n   network.\
    \  Thus, the use of a private header field that can be\n   modified by SIP proxies\
    \ is to be preferred over the use of a\n   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\
    \ (MIME) attachment that cannot\n   be modified in this way.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Forward Early Media
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Forward Early Media\n   Forward early media is less common than backward\
    \ early media in the\n   PSTN.  It is typically used to collect secondary dialed\
    \ digits, to\n   collect credit card numbers, or to collect other DTMF or speech\n\
    \   responses for the purpose of further directing the call.  Forward\n   early\
    \ media in the PSTN is always directed toward a network server\n   for the purpose\
    \ of progressing a call and involves no exchange of\n   data between end users.\n\
    \   A terminating SIP UA outside of the SIP network, on the other hand,\n   may\
    \ receive any user data in a forward early media stream.  Thus, if\n   the network\
    \ implements the usual early media policy, the network\n   equipment gating the\
    \ forward early media flow for the originating UA\n   must distinguish between\
    \ a terminating endpoint that is authorized to\n   receive forward early media,\
    \ and another SIP device outside of the\n   network that is not authorized to\
    \ receive forward early media\n   containing user data.  This authorization can\
    \ be accomplished in the\n   same manner as for backward early media by including\
    \ some information\n   in a backward SIP message that identifies that the terminating\
    \ side\n   is authorized to receive forward early media.\n"
- title: 5.  Applicability of RFC 3959 and RFC 3960
  contents:
  - "5.  Applicability of RFC 3959 and RFC 3960\n   The private header extension defined\
    \ in this document is applicable\n   to the gateway model defined in RFC 3960\
    \ [4], since the PSTN gateway\n   is the primary requestor of early media in an\
    \ IMS.  For the same\n   reason, neither the application server model of RFC 3960,\
    \ nor the\n   early-session disposition type defined in RFC 3959 [3] is applicable.\n\
    \   The gateway model of RFC 3960 [4] allows for individual networks to\n   create\
    \ local policy with respect to the handling of early media, but\n   does not address\
    \ the case where a network is interconnected with\n   other networks with unknown,\
    \ untrusted, or different early media\n   policies.  Without the kind of information\
    \ in the P-Early-Media\n   header field, it is not possible for the network to\
    \ determine whether\n   cut-through of early media could lead to the transfer\
    \ of data between\n   end-users during session establishment.\n   Thus, the private\
    \ header extension in this document is a natural\n   extension of the gateway\
    \ model of RFC 3960 [4] that is applicable\n   within a transitive trust domain.\n"
- title: 6.  Overview of Operation
  contents:
  - "6.  Overview of Operation\n   This document defines a new P-Early-Media header\
    \ field for the\n   purpose of requesting and authorizing requests for backward\
    \ and/or\n   forward early media.  A UAC capable of recognizing the P-Early-Media\n\
    \   header field may include the header field in an INVITE request.  The\n   P-Early-Media\
    \ header field in an INVITE request contains the\n   \"supported\" parameter.\n\
    \   As members of the Trust Domain, each proxy receiving an INVITE\n   request\
    \ must decide whether to insert or delete the P-Early-Media\n   header field before\
    \ forwarding.\n   A UAS receiving an INVITE request can use the presence of the\
    \ P-\n   Early-Media header field in the request to decide whether to request\n\
    \   early media authorization in subsequent messages towards the UAC.\n   After\
    \ receiving an incoming INVITE request, the UAS requesting\n   backward and/or\
    \ forward early media will include the P-Early-Media\n   header field in a message\
    \ towards the UAC within the dialog,\n   including direction parameter(s) that\
    \ identify for each media line in\n   the session whether the early media request\
    \ is for backward media,\n   forward media, both, or neither.  The UAS can change\
    \ its request for\n   early media by including a modified P-Early-Media header\
    \ field in a\n   subsequent message towards the UAC within the dialog.\n   Each\
    \ proxy in the network receiving the P-Early-Media header field in\n   a message\
    \ towards the UAC has the responsibility for assuring that\n   the early media\
    \ request comes from an authorized source.  If a P-\n   Early-Media header field\
    \ arrives from either an untrusted source, a\n   source not allowed to send backward\
    \ early media, or a source not\n   allowed to receive forward early media, then\
    \ the proxy may remove the\n   P-Early-Media header field or alter the direction\
    \ parameter(s) of the\n   P-Early-Media header field before forwarding the message,\
    \ based on\n   local policy.\n   A proxy in the network not receiving the P-Early-Media\
    \ header field\n   in a message towards the UAC may insert one based on local\
    \ policy.\n   If the proxy also performs gating of early media, then it uses the\n\
    \   parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media header field to decide whether to\n   open\
    \ or close the gates for backward and forward early media flow(s)\n   between\
    \ the UAs.  The proxy performing gating of early media may also\n   add a \"gated\"\
    \ parameter to the P-Early-Media header field before\n   forwarding the message\
    \ so that other gating proxies in the path can\n   choose to leave open their\
    \ gates.\n   If the UAC is a trusted server within the network (e.g., a PSTN\n\
    \   gateway), then the UAC may use the parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media\n   header\
    \ field in messages received from the UAS to decide whether to\n   perform early\
    \ media gating or cut-through and to decide whether or\n   not to render backward\
    \ early media in preference to generating\n   ringback based on the receipt of\
    \ a 180 Ringing response.\n   If the UAC is associated with user equipment, then\
    \ the network will\n   have assigned a proxy the task of performing early media\
    \ gating, so\n   that the parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media header field received\
    \ at\n   such a UAC do not require that the UAC police the early media\n   flow(s),\
    \ but they do provide additional information that the UAC may\n   use to render\
    \ media.\n   The UAC and proxies in the network may also insert, delete, or modify\n\
    \   the P-Early-Media header field in messages towards the UAS within the\n  \
    \ dialog according to local policy, but the interpretation of the\n   header field\
    \ when used in this way is a matter of local policy and\n   not defined herein.\
    \  The use of direction parameter(s) in this header\n   field could be used to\
    \ inform the UAS of the final early media\n   authorization status.\n"
- title: 7.  Limitations of the P-Early-Media Header Field
  contents:
  - "7.  Limitations of the P-Early-Media Header Field\n   The P-Early-Media header\
    \ field does not apply to any SDP with\n   Content-Disposition: early-session\
    \ [3].\n   When parallel forking occurs, there is no reliable way to correlate\n\
    \   early media authorization in a dialog with the media from the\n   corresponding\
    \ endpoint unless one can assume the use of symmetric\n   RTP, since the SDP messages\
    \ do not identify the RTP source address of\n   any media stream.  When a UAC\
    \ or proxy receives multiple early\n   dialogs and cannot accurately identify\
    \ the source of each media\n   stream, it SHOULD use the most restrictive early\
    \ media authorization\n   it receives on any of the dialogs to decide the policy\
    \ to apply\n   towards all received media.  When early media usage is desired\
    \ for\n   any reason and one cannot assume the use of symmetric RTP, it is\n \
    \  advisable to disable parallel forking using callerprefs [9].\n   Although the\
    \ implementation of media gating is outside the scope of\n   this extension, note\
    \ that media gating must be implemented carefully\n   in the presence of NATs\
    \ and protocols that aid in NAT traversal.\n   Media gating may also introduce\
    \ a potential for media clipping that\n   is similar to that created during parallel\
    \ forking or any other\n   feature that may disable early media, such as custom\
    \ ringback.\n"
- title: 8.  The P-Early-Media Header Field
  contents:
  - "8.  The P-Early-Media Header Field\n   The P-Early-Media header field with the\
    \ \"supported\" parameter MAY be\n   included in an INVITE request to indicate\
    \ that the UAC or a proxy on\n   the path recognizes the header field.\n   A network\
    \ entity MAY request the authorization of early media or\n   change a request\
    \ for authorization of early media by including the\n   P-Early-Media header field\
    \ in any message allowed by Table 1 within\n   the dialog towards the sender of\
    \ the INVITE request.  The P-Early-\n   Media header field includes one or more\
    \ direction parameters where\n   each has one of the values: \"sendrecv\", \"\
    sendonly\", \"recvonly\", or\n   \"inactive\", following the convention used for\
    \ Session Description\n   Protocol (SDP) [7][8] stream directionality.  Each parameter\
    \ applies,\n   in order, to the media lines in the corresponding SDP messages\n\
    \   establishing session media.  Unrecognized parameters SHALL be\n   silently\
    \ discarded.  Non-direction parameters are ignored for\n   purposes of early media\

    \ the excess SHALL be silently discarded.\n   If there are fewer direction parameters\
    \ than media lines, the value\n   of the last direction parameter SHALL apply\
    \ to all remaining media\n   lines.  A message directed towards the UAC containing\
    \ a P-Early-Media\n   header field with no recognized direction parameters SHALL\
    \ NOT be\n   interpreted as an early media authorization request.\n   The parameter\
    \ value \"sendrecv\" indicates a request for authorization\n   of early media\
    \ associated with the corresponding media line, both\n   from the UAS towards\
    \ the UAC and from the UAC towards the UAS (both\n   backward and forward early\
    \ media).  The value \"sendonly\" indicates a\n   request for authorization of\
    \ early media from the UAS towards the UAC\n   (backward early media), and not\
    \ in the other direction.  The value\n   \"recvonly\" indicates a request for\
    \ authorization of early media from\n   the UAC towards the UAS (forward early\
    \ media), and not in the other\n   direction.  The value \"inactive\" indicates\
    \ either a request that no\n   early media associated with the corresponding media\
    \ line be\n   authorized, or a request for revocation of authorization of\n  \
    \ previously authorized early media.\n   The P-Early-Media header field in any\
    \ message within a dialog towards\n   the sender of the INVITE request MAY also\
    \ include the non-direction\n   parameter \"gated\" to indicate that a network\
    \ entity on the path\n   towards the UAS is already gating the early media, according\
    \ to the\n   direction parameter(s).  When included in the P-Early-Media header\n\
    \   field, the \"gated\" parameter SHALL come after all direction\n   parameters\
    \ in the parameter list.\n   When receiving a message directed toward the UAC\
    \ without the P-\n   Early-Media header field and no previous early media authorization\n\
    \   request has been received within the dialog, the default early media\n   authorization\
    \ depends on local policy and may depend on whether the\n   header field was included\
    \ in the INVITE request.  After an early\n   media authorization request has been\
    \ received within a dialog, and a\n   subsequent message is received without the\
    \ P-Early-Media header\n   field, the previous early media authorization remains\
    \ unchanged.\n   The P-Early-Media header field in any message within a dialog\
    \ towards\n   the UAS MAY be ignored or interpreted according to local policy.\n\
    \   The P-Early-Media header field does not interact with SDP\n   offer/answer\
    \ procedures in any way.  Early media authorization is not\n   influenced by the\
    \ state of the SDP offer/answer procedures (including\n   preconditions and directionality)\
    \ and does not influence the state of\n   the SDP offer/answer procedures.  The\
    \ P-Early-Media header field may\n   or may not be present in messages containing\
    \ SDP.  The most recently\n   received early media authorization applies to the\
    \ corresponding media\n   line in the session established for the dialog until\
    \ receipt of the\n   200 OK response to the INVITE request, at which point all\
    \ media lines\n   in the session are implicitly authorized.  Early media flow\
    \ in a\n   particular direction requires that early media in that direction is\n\
    \   authorized, that media flow in that direction is enabled by the SDP\n   direction\
    \ attribute for the stream, and that any applicable\n   preconditions [11] are\
    \ met.  Early media authorization does not\n   override the SDP direction attribute\

  - "8.1.  Procedures at the User Agent Client\n   A User Agent Client MAY include\
    \ the P-Early-Media header field with\n   the \"supported\" parameter in an INVITE\
    \ request to indicate that it\n   recognizes the header field.\n   A User Agent\
    \ Client receiving a P-Early-Media header field MAY use\n   the parameter(s) of\
    \ the header field to gate or cut-through early\n   media, and to decide whether\
    \ to render early media from the UAS to\n   the UAC in preference to any locally\
    \ generated ringback triggered by\n   a 180 Ringing response.  If a proxy is providing\
    \ the early media\n   gating function for the User Agent Client, then the gateway\
    \ model of\n   RFC 3960 [4] for rendering of early media is applicable.  A User\n\
    \   Agent Client without a proxy in the network performing early media\n   gating\
    \ that receives a P-Early-Media header field SHOULD perform\n   gating or cut-through\
    \ of early media according to the parameter(s) of\n   the header field.\n"

    \ header field with\n   appropriate parameters(s) in any message allowed in table\
    \ 1 towards\n   the UAC within the dialog.  A User Agent Server MAY request changes\n\
    \   in early media authorization by inserting a P-Early-Media header\n   field\
    \ with appropriate parameter(s) in any subsequent message allowed\n   in table\
    \ 1 towards the UAC within the dialog.\n   If the P-Early-Media header field is\
    \ not present in the INVITE\n   request, the User Agent Server MAY choose to suppress\
    \ early media\n   authorization requests and MAY choose to execute alternate early\n\
    \   media procedures.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Procedures at the Proxy
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Procedures at the Proxy\n   When forwarding an INVITE request, a proxy\
    \ MAY add, retain, or delete\n   the P-Early-Media header field, depending on\
    \ local policy and the\n   trust relationship with the sender and/or receiver\

    \ on\n   local policy and the trust relationship with the sender and/or\n   receiver\
    \ of the message.  In addition, if the proxy controls the\n   gating of early\
    \ media for the User Agent Client, it SHOULD use the\n   contents of the P-Early-Media\
    \ header field to gate the early media,\n   according to the definitions of the\

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The use of this extension is only applicable\
    \ inside a \"Trust Domain\",\n   as defined in RFC 3325 [6].  This document does\
    \ NOT offer a general\n   early media authorization model suitable for inter-domain\
    \ use or use\n   in the Internet at large.\n   There are no confidentiality concerns\
    \ associated with the P-Early-\n   Media header field.  It is desirable to maintain\
    \ the integrity of the\n   direction parameters in the header field across each\
    \ hop between\n   servers to avoid the potential for unauthorized use of early\
    \ media.\n   It is assumed that the P-Early-Media header field is used within\
    \ the\n   context of the 3GPP IMS trust domain or a similar trust domain,\n  \
    \ consisting of a collection of SIP servers maintaining pair wise\n   security\
    \ associations.\n   Within the trust domain of a network it is only necessary\
    \ to police\n   the use of the P-Early-Media header field at the boundary to user\n\
    \   equipment served by the network and at the boundary to peer networks.\n  \
    \ It is assumed that boundary servers in the trust domain of a network\n   will\
    \ have local policy for the treatment of the P-Early-Media header\n   field as\
    \ it is sent to or received from any possible server external\n   to the network.\
    \  Since boundary servers are free to modify or remove\n   any P-Early-Media header\
    \ field in SIP messages forwarded across the\n   boundary, the integrity of the\
    \ P-Early-Media header field can be\n   verified to the extent that the connections\
    \ to external servers are\n   secured.  The authenticity of the P-Early-Media\
    \ header field can only\n   be assured to the extent that the external servers\
    \ are trusted to\n   police the authenticity of the header field.\n"
