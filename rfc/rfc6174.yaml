  - "Abstract\n   The IETF Datatracker tool needs to be enhanced to make it possible\n\
    \   for Working Group (WG) Chairs to provide IETF participants with more\n   information\
    \ about the status and progression of WG documents than is\n   currently possible.\n\
    \   This document defines new states and status annotation tags that need\n  \
    \ to be added to the Datatracker to enable WG Chairs and their\n   Delegates to\
    \ track the status of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that are\n   associated with their\
    \ WGs.  This document also describes the meaning\n   of all previously implemented\
    \ I-D states and substate annotation tags\n   currently used by IETF Area Directors\
    \ to indicate the status of I-Ds\n   that have been sent to the IESG for evaluation\
    \ and publication.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Datatracker is a web-based system for managing\
    \ information\n   about Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs, IPR disclosures, liaison\n\
    \   statements, and several other important aspects of the IETF process\n   [IDTRACKER].\n\
    \   The Datatracker is currently able to track and report on the status\n   of\
    \ I-Ds that have been submitted to the IESG for evaluation and\n   publication.\
    \  Appendix A of this document describes all of the\n   document states and substate\
    \ annotation tags used by IETF Area\n   Directors (ADs) to indicate the status\
    \ of I-Ds that have been sent to\n   the IESG.\n   In contrast, the Datatracker\
    \ has almost no ability to indicate the\n   status and progression of I-Ds before\
    \ they are sent to the IESG.  The\n   Datatracker can only track the availability\
    \ status of I-Ds today\n   (e.g., \"Active\", Expired\", \"Withdrawn\", \"Replaced\
    \ by\") and in some\n   cases indicate which IETF Working Group (WG) an I-D is\
    \ associated\n   with (if any).\n   Section 3 of this document contains a summary\
    \ of the Datatracker's\n   current ability to track and report on the status of\
    \ I-Ds in the IETF\n   document stream.  The IETF document stream is defined in\
    \ Section\n   5.1.1 of RFC 4844 [RFC4844].\n   Section 4 of this document defines\
    \ several new I-D states and I-D\n   status annotation tags that need to be added\
    \ to the Datatracker to\n   enable status tracking and reporting for WG I-Ds.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   A \"working group I-D\" (WG I-D) is\
    \ an Internet-Draft that has achieved\n   consensus for adoption as a work item\
    \ by a WG (compared to an\n   individual submission I-D that has not, or has not\
    \ yet, achieved\n   consensus).\n   The terms \"WG I-D\", \"WG document\", and\
    \ \"WG draft\" are used\n   synonymously throughout this document.  The same is\
    \ true for the\n   plural case of each term.\n   The terms \"WG document\" and\
    \ \"WG draft\" are not intended to apply to\n   any other document that may be\
    \ reviewed, discussed, or produced by an\n   IETF working group.  Working group\
    \ meeting materials such as Blue\n   Sheets, agendas, jabber logs, scribe's notes,\
    \ minutes, and\n   presentation slides are not to be considered \"WG documents\"\
    \ or \"WG\n   drafts\" in the context of this document.\n   The phrase \"WG status\
    \ of an I-D\" is to be interpreted as referring to\n   the state that an I-D is\
    \ in, as defined in Section 4.2 of this\n   document.  This phrase does not refer\
    \ to an I-D's availability status\n   (e.g., \"Expired\", \"Active\", \"Replaced\
    \ by\") as described in Section\n   3.1, or to any of the IESG states used by\
    \ Area Directors to describe\n   the status of I-Ds they may be evaluating.\n"

  - "3.  I-D States Already Implemented by the Datatracker\n   This section describes\
    \ capabilities that are currently implemented in\n   the Datatracker to track\
    \ the status of I-Ds in the IETF document\n   stream.\n   The document availability\
    \ states described in Section 3.1 are\n   applicable to every I-D submitted to\
    \ the IETF.\n   The IESG document states and substate annotation tags described\
    \ in\n   Section 3.2 and Appendix A are only applicable to I-Ds that have been\n\
    \   submitted to the IESG for evaluation and publication.\n   The Datatracker\
    \ currently has no I-D states or I-D status annotation\n   tags to describe the\
    \ WG status of any I-D.\n"
- title: 3.1.  I-D Availability States
  contents:
  - "3.1.  I-D Availability States\n   The Datatracker currently maintains availability\
    \ status information\n   for every I-D submitted to the IETF.  The I-D availability\
    \ states are\n   as follows:\n      - Expired\n      - Active\n      - Replaces\n\
    \      - Replaced by\n      - Withdrawn by Submitter\n      - Withdrawn by IETF\n\
    \      - RFC\n   The first four I-D availability states are explained in the following\n\
    \   subsections.  The other states are self-explanatory.\n   Note that the Datatracker\
    \ describes the status of some I-Ds with the\n   phrase \"I-D Exists\".  \"I-D\
    \ Exists\" is the state that is manufactured\n   by the Datatracker to describe\
    \ I-Ds for which it has no other status\n   information.  For example, the tool\
    \ currently uses \"I-D Exists\" to\n   describe I-Ds that are not expired and\
    \ that have not been sent to the\n   IESG.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Expired
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Expired\n   An \"Expired\" I-D is a document that is more than six months\
    \ old and\n   that has not been updated or replaced by a newer I-D or an RFC.\n\
    \   Every I-D has a normal lifespan of 185 days.  An I-D will expire and\n   be\
    \ deleted from the I-D repository after six months unless it is\n   updated or\
    \ replaced by a newer version.  One exception is that an I-D\n   undergoing official\
    \ evaluation by the IESG will not be expired before\n   its status is resolved\
    \ (e.g., the I-D is published as an RFC).  IESG\n   states that do not relate\
    \ to a formal request to publish a document\n   (e.g., \"AD is Watching\") do\
    \ not prevent an I-D from expiring.\n   [AUTHGUIDE]\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Active
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Active\n   An \"Active\" I-D is a document that is less than six months\
    \ old and\n   has not been updated or replaced by a newer I-D or an RFC.\n   The\
    \ \"Active\" availability state is applicable to individual I-Ds and\n   WG I-Ds.\
    \  The Datatracker may also use \"Active\" to describe the\n   status of I-Ds\
    \ under formal evaluation by the IESG and I-Ds in the\n   RFC Editor Queue.  As\
    \ a result, the \"Active\" I-D availability state\n   cannot be used to determine\
    \ if an I-D is actively being developed by\n   a WG. [WGDTSPEC]\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Replaces and Replaced By
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Replaces and Replaced By\n   The Datatracker uses \"Replaces\" and \"\
    Replaced by\" to describe I-Ds\n   that have been renamed and subsequently resubmitted\
    \ to the I-D\n   repository for some reason.\n   Two common uses of \"Replaced\
    \ by\" are as follows:\n   -  The filename of an individual I-D that is being\
    \ considered for\n      adoption by a WG typically includes the name of its author\
    \ (e.g.,\n      'draft-author-wgname-topic-nn').  If the individual I-D is adopted\n\
    \      by a WG it will be \"Replaced by\" a newer draft having a filename\n  \
    \    that includes the string 'ietf-' (e.g., 'draft-ietf-wgname-\n      topic-00');\
    \ when the newer WG I-D is submitted to the I-D\n      repository, it \"Replaces\"\
    \ the older individual submission I-D.\n   -  The Datatracker also uses \"Replaced\
    \ by\" to describe the final\n      state of an I-D that has been published as\
    \ an RFC; the I-D was\n      \"Replaced By\" the RFC.\n   Note that getting correct\
    \ \"Replaces\" and \"Replaced by\" data into the\n   Datatracker currently requires\
    \ an explicit request by a WG Chair.\n   Without such a request, an individual\
    \ submission I-D will co-exist\n   with the newer WG I-D that replaces it until\
    \ the individual\n   submission I-D eventually expires.\n   The Datatracker's\
    \ ability to track \"Replaces\" and \"Replaced by\"\n   information may need to\
    \ be extended in the future to handle more\n   complex cases such as the following:\n\
    \   -  Two or more I-Ds are merged into (i.e., \"Replaced by\") a single\n   \
    \   I-D; in such cases, the availability status of the (one) new I-D\n      should\
    \ indicate that the draft \"Replaces\" two or more older and\n      previously\
    \ separate I-Ds; and\n   -  One I-D is split or divided into two or more new I-Ds;\
    \ in this\n      case the availability status should indicate that one (older)\
    \ I-D\n      was \"Replaced by\" two or more newer I-Ds.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IESG Document States
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IESG Document States\n   In addition to tracking the availability status\
    \ of every I-D, the\n   Datatracker also maintains detailed information about\
    \ the status and\n   progression of I-Ds that have been sent to the IESG for evaluation\n\
    \   and publication.\n   All of the states used by Area Directors to indicate\
    \ the status of\n   I-Ds under evaluation by the IESG are defined in [IESGSTAT]\
    \ and are\n   reproduced for convenience in Appendix A.\n   The following subsections\
    \ describe some common interactions between\n   three of the IESG I-D states and\
    \ normal IETF WG processes.  These\n   interactions are relevant to several of\
    \ the new WG I-D states defined\n   in Section 4.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Publication Requested
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Publication Requested\n   When a WG has determined that at least rough\
    \ consensus exists within\n   the WG to advance an I-D, progressing the document\
    \ is then the\n   responsibility of the IESG (unless the IESG returns the I-D\
    \ to the WG\n   for further development). [RFC2418]\n   The \"Publication Requested\"\
    \ state describes an I-D for which a formal\n   request has been sent to the IESG\
    \ to advance/publish the I-D as an\n   RFC, following the procedures specified\
    \ in Section 7.5 of RFC 2418\n   [RFC2418].  This state does not mean that an\
    \ Area Director has\n   reviewed the I-D or that any official action has been\
    \ taken on the\n   I-D other than to note that its publication has been requested.\n\
    \   Many WG drafts enter the IESG state machine for the first time via\n   the\
    \ \"Publication Requested\" state.  When an I-D advances through the\n   IESG\
    \ process, its IESG state will change to reflect its progress.\n   This said,\
    \ the WG status of the I-D should not change unless an AD or\n   the IESG sends\
    \ the I-D back to the WG for further development.  The\n   WG state of an I-D\
    \ that is being progressed by the IESG is \"Submitted\n   to IESG for Publication\"\
    , as defined in Section 4.2.10.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  AD Evaluation
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  AD Evaluation\n   The \"AD Evaluation\" state describes an I-D that the\
    \ responsible Area\n   Director has begun to review.  The purpose of the AD's\
    \ review is to\n   verify that the I-D is ready for advancement before an IETF\
    \ Last Call\n   is started or before the document is progressed to the IESG as\
    \ a\n   whole.\n   After evaluating an I-D, the responsible AD may decide that\
    \ the\n   document needs to be revised before it can be progressed further.\n\
    \   The AD may send a working group I-D back to the WG that created it\n   for\
    \ revision.\n   When an AD sends an I-D back to a WG for revision, the Datatracker\n\
    \   will report the IESG state and substate status of the document as \"AD\n \
    \  Evaluation: Revised I-D Needed\".  If the required revisions are\n   extensive,\
    \ a WG Chair may decide to change the WG state of the I-D\n   from \"Submitted\
    \ to IESG for Publication\" to another WG state (e.g.,\n   \"Waiting for WG Chair\
    \ Go-Ahead\" or \"WG Document\") for as long as it\n   takes the revised I-D to\
    \ be developed.  The IESG status of the I-D\n   will continue to be \"AD Evaluation:\

- title: 3.2.3.  IESG Evaluation
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  IESG Evaluation\n   The \"IESG Evaluation\" state describes an I-D that\

    \ that are\n   blocking approval of the document are called \"DISCUSS\" comments.\
    \  A\n   \"DISCUSS\" with serious issues may cause a WG I-D to be returned to\n\
    \   the WG for revision.\n   If the IESG sends an I-D back to a WG for more development,\

    \ be moved by the Datatracker into the\n      WG state called \"Submitted to IESG\

    \ Chairs or\n   their Delegates to log in to the Datatracker to manually input\
    \ the\n   appropriate WG state to describe the WG status of an I-D.\n   Note that\
    \ Figure 1 includes an arc from the \"Submitted to IESG for\n   Publication\"\

    \ state should be used to indicate\n   when an I-D is being considered for adoption\
    \ by an IETF WG.  An I-D\n   that is in this state is actively being considered\
    \ for adoption and\n   has not yet achieved consensus, preference, or selection\
    \ in the WG.\n   This state may be used to describe an I-D that someone has asked\
    \ a WG\n   to consider for adoption, if the WG Chair has agreed with the\n   request.\
    \  This state may also be used to identify an I-D that a WG\n   Chair asked an\
    \ author to write specifically for consideration as a\n   candidate WG item [WGDTSPEC],\
    \ and/or an I-D that is listed as a\n   'candidate draft' in the WG's charter.\n\

    \ out of the WG state machine and\n   revert back to having no stream-specific\

    \ ability to correctly capture \"Replaces\" information for\n   WG drafts and\
    \ correct \"Replaced by\" information for individual\n   submission I-Ds that\
    \ have been replaced by WG drafts.\n   This state is needed because the Datatracker\
    \ uses the filename of an\n   I-D as a key to search its database for status information\
    \ about the\n   I-D, and because the filename of a WG I-D is supposed to be different\n\

  - "4.3.3.  Awaiting Merge with Other Document\n   This tag means a decision has\
    \ been made by someone (e.g., the\n   document author, editor, or the WG Chair)\
    \ to merge the I-D with one\n   or more other I-Ds from the same (or another)\
    \ working group.\n   If the result of the merge is a new I-D having a different\
    \ title,\n   then the old I-D may be declared as being a \"Dead WG Document\"\
    .  In\n   such a case, the annotation tag should be changed from \"Awaiting\n\
    \   Merge with Other Document\" to \"Other - see Comment Log\" and a\n   description\
    \ of the merge should be entered into the log for\n   posterity.\n   The Datatracker's\
    \ regular 'Replaced by' information should also be\n   set for the old I-Ds to\
    \ make it easier to find the new merged\n   document from the old documents.\n\
    \   If the result of the merge operation is a revision to the old I-D,\n   this\

- title: 4.3.4.  Author or Editor Needed
  contents:
  - "4.3.4.  Author or Editor Needed\n   This tag means an I-D has lost a primary\
    \ author or editor, and that\n   further work on the I-D cannot continue in an\
    \ effective or efficient\n   manner until a new author or editor is found.\n \
    \  This tag should be removed after a new primary author or editor is\n   found.\n"
- title: 4.3.5.  Waiting for Referenced Document
  contents:
  - "4.3.5.  Waiting for Referenced Document\n   This tag means that completion of\
    \ the I-D is on-hold because the\n   draft has a dependency on one or more other\
    \ documents.  A typical\n   example is where an I-D depends on another IETF document\
    \ that has not\n   yet progressed to a point where it may be referenced; the dependency\n\
    \   may be on one or more documents in other IETF Working Groups or on\n   work\
    \ in progress documents in other SDOs.\n   This tag should be removed after the\
    \ dependency is cleared.\n"
- title: 4.3.6.  Waiting for Referencing Document
  contents:
  - "4.3.6.  Waiting for Referencing Document\n   This tag means that completion of\
    \ the I-D is on-hold because one or\n   more other documents are dependent on\
    \ it, and the WG Chair wants to\n   submit all of the documents to the IESG (for\
    \ publication)\n   simultaneously.  This tag is the inverse of 4.3.5.\n   This\

- title: 4.3.8.  Revised I-D Needed - Issue raised by AD
  contents:
  - "4.3.8.  Revised I-D Needed - Issue raised by AD\n   This annotation means the\

- title: 4.3.10.  Doc Shepherd Followup Underway
  contents:
  - "4.3.10.  Doc Shepherd Followup Underway\n   This annotation tag may be used to\
    \ indicate that the Document\n   Shepherd for the WG document has begun working\
    \ on the writeup\n   required to submit the document (to the IESG) for publication.\n\
    \   It is possible that too many I-Ds may arrive in a shepherd's queue in\n  \
    \ too short a time, and the shepherd cannot create satisfactory\n   writeups for\
    \ all of the documents simultaneously.\n   When this annotation tag is set, it\
    \ means the Document Shepherd has\n   started work on the writeup for the I-D.\
    \  The absence or resetting of\n   this annotation tag for an I-D in the \"WG\
    \ Consensus: Waiting for\n   Writeup\" state indicates the writeup has not yet\

- title: 4.3.11.  Other - see Comment Log
  contents:
  - "4.3.11.  Other - see Comment Log\n   This annotation tag is a catch-all to indicate\
    \ that someone (e.g., an\n   author or editor of the document, the WG Chair, the\

  contents:
  - "5.  Intended Maturity Level of WG Drafts\n   The IESG requires a WG I-D to have\

    \ Proposed Standard,\n   Experimental) before the I-D is submitted to the IESG\
    \ for evaluation\n   and publication.  This information is also often requested\
    \ by IETF\n   participants.\n   I-D maturity levels were first defined in Sections\
    \ 4 and 5 of RFC\n   2026 [RFC2026].  The names of the maturity levels in use\

    \ this Appendix) do not stay with the IESG until\n   the day they are published\
    \ as RFCs.  After evaluation, the IESG may\n   declare that some I-Ds deserve\
    \ a \"Do Not Publish\" label.  Other I-Ds\n   may become \"Dead\".  Some I-Ds\
    \ may get sent back to their originators\n   (WGs or otherwise), and the rest\
