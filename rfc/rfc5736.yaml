- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This is a direction to [IANA] concerning the creation and\
    \ management\n   of the IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry.  The registry\
    \ will\n   be used for recording IETF protocol assignments from 192.0.0.0/24 and\n\
    \   any other address prefixes allocated to the registry in the future,\n   as\
    \ described in Section 3.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Block
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Block\n   [RFC5735] records the assignment\
    \ of an IPv4 address prefix to IANA\n   for IETF protocol assignments.\n     \
    \ 192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol\n      assignments.\n\
    \   This address allocation to IANA is intended to support IETF protocol\n   assignments.\
    \  A more general view of the roles of IANA with respect\n   to address allocation\
    \ functions is documented in [RFC2860]:\n      4.3. [...]  Note that [...] (b)\
    \ assignments of specialised address\n      blocks (such as multicast or anycast\
    \ blocks), and (c) experimental\n      assignments are not considered to be policy\
    \ issues, and shall\n      remain subject to the provisions of this Section 4.\
    \  (For purposes\n      of this MOU, the term \"assignments\" includes allocations.)\n\
    \   The reference to Section 4 here is to the general technical work for\n   the\
    \ IANA as described in [RFC2860]:\n      4.1.  The IANA will assign and register\
    \ Internet protocol\n      parameters only as directed by the criteria and procedures\n\
    \      specified in RFCs, including Proposed, Draft, and full Internet\n     \
    \ Standards and Best Current Practice documents, and any other RFC\n      that\
    \ calls for IANA assignment.\n   This document directs IANA to designate special\
    \ purpose address\n   blocks in compliance with [RFC2860].\n   This document directs\
    \ IANA to open an IPv4 Special Purpose Address\n   Registry for the management\
    \ of these IANA-designated address blocks.\n   Special Purpose registrations to\
    \ be made from this registry include\n   addresses for IETF protocol assignments\
    \ and other special purpose\n   cases, as documented in IESG-reviewed RFCs, according\
    \ to the\n   provisions described in Section 4.1 of [RFC2860].\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA maintains an \"IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address\
    \ Registry\".  The\n   registry records current IANA address designations from\
    \ the IANA-\n   managed IPv4 Special Purpose address pool.\n   This recommendation\
    \ concerns the management of the address pool used\n   for IETF protocol assignments\
    \ as documented in [RFC5735] -- namely,\n   192.0.0.0/24.  Following the policies\
    \ outlined in [RFC5226], further\n   assignments of address space to IANA for\
    \ subsequent designation of\n   address prefixes for the purposes listed here\
    \ shall be undertaken\n   only through an IETF Review action.\n   IANA may make\
    \ Special Purpose address designations to support testing\n   or experimental\
    \ usage activities initiated by the IETF, or for\n   specialised use of a designated\
    \ address block in a context (e.g.,\n   anycast) associated with an Internet Standards\
    \ Track protocol.  All\n   such address designations must be documented in the\
    \ \"IANA\n   Considerations\" section of an IESG-reviewed RFC.\n   The IANA IPv4\
    \ Special Purpose Address Registry records, for all\n   current address designations\
    \ undertaken by IANA:\n   1.  The designated address prefix.\n   2.  The RFC that\
    \ called for the IANA address designation.\n   3.  The date the designation was\
    \ made.\n   4.  The date the use designation is to be terminated (if specified\
    \ as\n       a limited-use designation).\n   5.  The nature of the purpose of\
    \ the designated address (e.g.,\n       unicast experiment or protocol service\
    \ anycast).\n   6.  For experimental unicast applications and otherwise as\n \
    \      appropriate, the registry will also identify the entity and\n       related\
    \ contact details to whom the address designation has been\n       made.\n   7.\
    \  The registry will also note, for each designation, the intended\n       routing\
    \ scope of the address, indicating whether the address is\n       intended to\
    \ be routable only in scoped, local, or private\n       contexts, or whether the\
    \ address prefix is intended to be routed\n       globally.\n   8.  The date in\
    \ the IANA registry is the date of the IANA action,\n       i.e., the day IANA\
    \ records the allocation.\n   The IANA registry notes, as a general comment, that\
    \ address prefixes\n   listed in the IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry are\
    \ not\n   guaranteed routability in any particular local or global context.\n\
    \   IANA will not maintain further sub-registries for any IPv4 Special\n   Purpose\
    \ address block designated according to this direction.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security of the Internet's routing system relies\
    \ on the ability to\n   authenticate an assertion of unique control of an address\
    \ block.\n   Measures to authenticate such assertions rely on validation that\
    \ the\n   address block forms part of an existing allocated address block, and\n\
    \   that there is a trustable and unique reference in the IANA address\n   registries.\n\
    \   This registry is intended to provide an authoritative source of\n   information\
    \ regarding the currency and intended purpose of IPv4\n   Special Purpose address\
    \ blocks that are designated from the IANA-\n   administered IPv4 Special Purpose\
    \ address pool.  This is a small step\n   towards the creation of a comprehensive\
    \ registry framework that can\n   be used as a trust point for commencing a chain\
    \ of address\n   validation.  Consideration should be given to the use of file\n\
    \   signatures and associated certificate mechanisms to allow\n   applications\
    \ to confirm that the registry contents are current, and\n   that they have been\
    \ published by the IANA.\n"
