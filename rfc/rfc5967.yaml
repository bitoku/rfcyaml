  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a media type used to carry PKCS #10\n  \
    \ certification requests as defined in RFC 2986.  It carries over the\n   original\
    \ specification from RFC 2311, which recently has been moved\n   to Historic status,\
    \ and properly links it to RFC 2986.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2311] first defined the application/pkcs10 media type.\
    \  When\n   [RFC2633] was published, the application/pkcs10 section was dropped,\n\
    \   but for some reason the text was not incorporated into the PKCS #10\n   document\
    \ [RFC2986].  [RFC2311] was moved to Historic status by\n   [RFC5751].  To ensure\
    \ the IANA media type registration points to a\n   non-Historic document, this\
    \ document updates [RFC2986] with the\n   definition of the application/pkcs10\
    \ media type and an IANA\n   registration based on [RFC4288].\n   The text for\
    \ Section 2 is adapted from Section 3.7 of [RFC2311].\n"

- title: 2.  Creating a Certification Request
  contents:
  - "2.  Creating a Certification Request\n   A typical application that allows a\
    \ user to generate cryptographic\n   information has to submit that information\
    \ to a Certification\n   Authority (CA), who transforms it into a certificate.\
    \  PKCS #10\n   [RFC2986] describes a syntax for certification requests.\n   The\
    \ details of certification requests and the process of obtaining a\n   certificate\
    \ are beyond the scope of this memo.  Instead, only the\n   format of data used\
    \ in application/pkcs10 is defined.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of the application/pkcs10 Body
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of the application/pkcs10 Body\n   PKCS #10 defines the ASN.1 type\
    \ CertificationRequest for use in\n   submitting a certification request.  For\
    \ transfer to a CA, this\n   abstract syntax needs to be encoded and identified\
    \ in a unique\n   manner.  When the media type application/pkcs10 is used, the\
    \ body\n   MUST be a CertificationRequest.\n   A robust application SHOULD output\
    \ Distinguished Encoding Rules\n   (DER), but allow Basic Encoding Rules (BER)\
    \ or DER on input.\n   Data produced by BER or DER is 8-bit, but some transports\
    \ are limited\n   to 7-bit data.  In such cases, a suitable 7-bit transfer encoding\n\
    \   MUST be applied; in MIME-compatible transports, the base64 encoding\n   [RFC4648]\
    \ SHOULD be used with application/pkcs10, although any 7-bit\n   transfer encoding\
    \ may work.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Sending and Receiving an application/pkcs10 Body Part
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Sending and Receiving an application/pkcs10 Body Part\n   For sending a\
    \ certificate-signing request, the application/pkcs10\n   message format MUST\
    \ be used to convey a PKCS #10 certificate-signing\n   request.  Note that for\
    \ sending certificates and Certificate\n   Revocation Lists (CRLs) without any\
    \ signed content, the\n   application/pkcs7-mime message format MUST be used to\
    \ convey a\n   degenerate PKCS #7 signedData \"certs-only\" message [RFC5751].\n\
    \   To send an application/pkcs10 body, the application generates the\n   cryptographic\
    \ information for the user.  The details of the\n   cryptographic information\
    \ are beyond the scope of this memo.\n   Step 1. The cryptographic information\
    \ is placed within a PKCS #10\n           CertificationRequest.\n   Step 2. The\
    \ CertificationRequest is encoded according to BER or DER\n           (preferred,\
    \ DER).\n   Step 3. As a typical step, the encoded CertificationRequest is also\n\
    \           base64 encoded so that it is 7-bit data suitable for transfer\n  \
    \         in ESMTP.  This then becomes the body of an\n           application/pkcs10\
    \ body part.\n   The result might look like this:\n      Content-Type: application/pkcs10;\
    \ name=smime.p10\n      Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n      Content-Disposition:\
    \ attachment; filename=smime.p10\n      rfvbnj756tbBghyHhHUujhJhjH77n8HHGT9HG4VQpfyF467GhIGfHfYT6\n\

    \      0GhIGfHfQbnj756YT64V\n   A typical application only needs to send a certification\
    \ request.  It\n   is a Certification Authority that has to receive and process\
    \ the\n   request.  The steps for recovering the CertificationRequest from the\n\
    \   message are straightforward but are not presented here.  The\n   procedures\
    \ for processing the certification request are beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n"
