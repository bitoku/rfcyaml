  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the transmission of IPv4 over Ethernet,\
    \ as\n   well as IPv6 over Ethernet, in an access network deploying the IEEE\n\
    \   802.16 cellular radio transmission technology.  The Ethernet on top\n   of\
    \ IEEE 802.16 is realized by bridging connections that IEEE 802.16\n   provides\
    \ between a base station and its associated subscriber\n   stations.  Due to the\
    \ resource constraints of radio transmission\n   systems and the limitations of\
    \ the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control\n   (MAC) functionality for the realization\
    \ of an Ethernet, the\n   transmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 may\
    \ considerably\n   benefit by adding IP-specific support functions in the Ethernet\
    \ over\n   IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with standard IP\n\
    \   over Ethernet behavior.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE 802.16 [802.16] specifies a fixed-to-mobile, broadband\
    \ wireless\n   access system.\n   The IEEE 802.16 standard defines a packet CS\
    \ (Convergence Sublayer)\n   for interfacing with specific packet-based protocols\
    \ as well as a\n   generic packet CS (GPCS) to provide an upper-layer, protocol-\n\
    \   independent interface.  This document describes transmission of IPv4\n   and\
    \ IPv6 over Ethernet via the Ethernet-specific part of the packet\n   CS as well\
    \ as of the GPCS in the access network based on IEEE 802.16.\n   Ethernet has\
    \ been originally architected and designed for a shared\n   medium while the IEEE\
    \ 802.16 uses a point-to-multipoint architecture\n   like other cellular radio\
    \ transmission systems.  Hence, Ethernet on\n   top of IEEE 802.16 is realized\
    \ by bridging between IEEE 802.16 radio\n   connections that connect a BS (Base\
    \ Station) and its associated SSs\n   (Subscriber Stations).\n   Under the resource\
    \ constraints of radio transmission systems and the\n   particularities of the\
    \ IEEE 802.16 for the realization of Ethernet,\n   it makes sense to add IP-specific\
    \ support functions in the Ethernet\n   layer above IEEE 802.16 while maintaining\
    \ full compatibility with\n   standard IP over Ethernet behavior.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  MAC Addressing in IEEE 802.16\n   Each SS has a unique 48-bit MAC address;\
    \ the 48-bit MAC address is\n   used during the initial ranging process for the\
    \ identification of the\n   SS and may be verified by the succeeding PKM (Privacy\
    \ Key Management)\n   authentication phase.  Out of the successful authentication,\
    \ the BS\n   establishes and maintains the list of attached SSs based on their\
    \ MAC\n   addresses, purely for MAC management purposes.\n   While MAC addresses\
    \ are assigned to all the BSs as well as the SSs,\n   the forwarding of packets\
    \ over the air is only based on the CID value\n   of the particular connection\
    \ in the IEEE 802.16 MAC header.  Not\n   relying on the MAC addresses in the\
    \ payload for reception of a radio\n   frame allows for the transport of arbitrary\
    \ source and destination\n   MAC addresses in Ethernet frames between an SS and\
    \ its BS.  This is\n   required for bridging Ethernet frames toward an SS that\
    \ is attached\n   to a bridge connected to another network.\n   Due to the managed\
    \ assignment of the service flows and associated CID\n   values to individual\
    \ SSs, the BS is able to bundle all unicast\n   connections belonging to a particular\
    \ SS into a single link on the\n   network side, as shown in Figure 1, so that\
    \ it provides a single\n   layer-2 link between the SS and its associated wired\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  IEEE 802.16 Ethernet Link Model\n   To realize Ethernet on top of IEEE\
    \ 802.16, all the point-to-point\n   connections belonging to an SS MUST be connected\

    \ to\n   today's switched Ethernet with twisted pair wires or fibres\n   connecting\
    \ the hosts to a bridge (\"Switch\").\n   The network-side bridging function can\
    \ be realized either by a single\n   centralized network-side bridge or by multiple\
    \ interconnected\n   bridges, preferably arranged in hierarchical order.  The\
    \ single\n   centralized network-side bridge allows best control of the\n   broadcasting\
    \ and forwarding behavior of the Ethernet over IEEE\n   802.16.  Appendix B explains\
    \ the issues of a distributed bridging\n   architecture when no assumptions about\

    \  The\n   network-side bridging function SHOULD filter these broadcast\n   DHCPOFFER\
    \ and DHCPACK messages and forward the broadcast messages\n   only to the host\
    \ defined by the client hardware address in the chaddr\n   information element.\n\
    \   Alternatively, the DHCP Relay Agent Information option (option 82)\n   [RFC3046]\
    \ MAY be used to avoid DHCPv4 broadcast replies.  Option 82\n   consists of two\
    \ types of sub-options: Circuit ID and Remote ID.  The\n   DHCPv4 Relay Agent\
    \ is usually located on the network-side bridging\n   function as the Layer 2\
    \ DHCPv4 Relay Agent.  The port number of the\n   network-side bridging function\

    \ and communicate with DHCPv6 servers or Relay Agents on\n   their link.  Hence,\
    \ DHCPv6-related packets are unicasted or\n   multicasted.  The network-side bridging\

    \ Section 7.1.1.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Address Resolution Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Address Resolution Considerations\n   In the IPv4-over-Ethernet case, ARP\
    \ Requests are usually broadcasted\n   to all hosts on the same link in order\
    \ to resolve an Ethernet MAC\n   address, which would disturb all hosts on the\
    \ same link.  Proxy ARP\n   provides the function in which a device on the same\
    \ link as the hosts\n   answers ARP Requests instead of the remote host.  When\
    \ transmitting\n   IPv4 packets over the IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link, the Proxy\
    \ ARP\n   mechanism is used by the network-side bridging function to avoid\n \
    \  broadcasting ARP Requests over the air.\n   The network-side bridging function\
    \ SHOULD maintain an ARP cache large\n   enough to accommodate ARP entries for\
    \ all its serving SSs.  The ARP\n   cache SHOULD be updated by any packets including\
    \ ARP Requests from\n   SSs in the same way the normal layer-2 bridging device\
    \ is updating\n   its Filtering Database according to [802.1D].\n   Upon receiving\
    \ an ARP Request from an SS, the network-side bridging\n   function SHOULD unicast\
    \ an ARP Reply back to the SS with the Ethernet\n   address of the target host,\
    \ provided that the target address matches\n   an entry in the ARP cache.  However,\
    \ in case of receiving an ARP\n   Request from a host behind a subscriber-side\
    \ bridge, the network-side\n   bridging function SHOULD discard the request if\
    \ the target host is\n   also behind the same subscriber-side bridge, i.e., on\
    \ the same port\n   of the network-side bridge.  Otherwise, the ARP Request MAY\
    \ be\n   flooded.  The network-side bridging function SHOULD silently discard\n\
    \   any received self-ARP Request.\n   In the IPv6-over-Ethernet case, Neighbor\
    \ Solicitation messages are\n   multicasted to the solicited-node multicast address\
    \ for the address\n   resolution, including a duplicate address detection.  The\
    \ solicited-\n   node multicast address facilitates the efficient querying of\
    \ hosts\n   without disturbing all hosts on the same link.  The network-side\n\
    \   bridging function SHOULD transmit the Neighbor Solicitation messages\n   specified\
    \ in Section 7.1.1.\n"
- title: 8.  Public Access Recommendations
  contents:
  - "8.  Public Access Recommendations\n   In the public access scenario, direct communication\
    \ between nodes is\n   restricted because of security and accounting issues. \
    \ Figure 4\n   depicts the public access scenario.\n   In this scenario, the AR\
    \ is connected to a network-side bridge.  The\n   AR MAY perform security filtering,\
    \ policing, and accounting of all\n   traffic from hosts, e.g., like an NAS (Network\
    \ Access Server).\n   If the AR functions as the NAS, all the traffic from SSs\
    \ SHOULD be\n   forwarded to the AR, not bridged at the network-side bridging\n\
    \   function -- even in the case of traffic between SSs served by the\n   same\
    \ AR.  The bridge SHOULD forward upstream traffic from hosts\n   toward the AR\
    \ but MUST perform normal bridging operation for\n   downstream traffic from the\
    \ AR and MUST bridge SEcure Neighbor\n   Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] messages to\
    \ allow applicability of\n   security schemes.\n   In the IPv4-over-Ethernet case,\
    \ MAC-Forced Forwarding (MAC-FF)\n   [RFC4562] can be used for the public access\
    \ network to ensure that\n   traffic from all hosts is always directed to the\
    \ AR.  The MAC-FF is\n   performed in the network-side bridging function; thus,\
    \ the bridge\n   filters broadcast ARP Requests from all the hosts and responds\
    \ to the\n   ARP Requests with an Ethernet MAC address of the AR.\n   In the IPv6-over-Ethernet\
    \ case, unique IPv6 prefixes per SS can be\n   assigned because doing so forces\
    \ all IPv6 packets from SSs to be\n   transferred to the AR and thus results in\
    \ layer-3 separation between\n   SSs.  Alternatively, common IPv6 prefixes can\
    \ be assigned to all SSs\n   served by the same AR in order to exploit the efficient\
    \ multicast\n   support of Ethernet link in the network side.  In this case, a\
    \ Prefix\n   Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861] carrying the common IPv6 prefixes\n\
    \   SHOULD be advertised with the On-link flag (L-Flag) reset so that it\n   is\
    \ not assumed that the addresses matching the prefixes are available\n   on-link.\n\
    \   The AR should relay packets between SSs within the same AR.\n            \

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This recommendation does not introduce new vulnerabilities\
    \ to IPv4\n   and IPv6 specifications or operations.  The security of the IEEE\n\
    \   802.16 air interface between SSs and BS is the subject of [802.16],\n   which\
    \ provides the capabilities of admission control and ciphering of\n   the traffic\
    \ carried over the air interface.  A Traffic Encryption Key\n   (TEK) is generated\
    \ by the SS and BS on completion of successful\n   mutual authentication and is\
    \ used to secure the air interface.\n   The IEEE 802.16 Ethernet link model described\
    \ in Section 5.1\n   represents a bridged (switched) Ethernet architecture with\
    \ point-to-\n   point links between the SS and its bridge port.  Even though the\n\
    \   bridged Ethernet model prevents messaging between SSs on the same\n   link\
    \ without passing through the bridge, it is still vulnerable,\n   e.g., by malicious\
    \ reconfiguration of the address table of the bridge\n   in the learning process.\
    \  This recommendation does not cause new\n   security issues beyond those that\
    \ are already known for the bridged\n   Ethernet architecture.  For example, link\
    \ security mechanisms\n   according to [802.1AE] can be used on top of this recommendation\
    \ to\n   resolve the security issues of the bridged Ethernet.\n   As the generic\
    \ IP over Ethernet network using IEEE 802.16 emulates a\n   standard Ethernet\
    \ link, existing IPv4 and IPv6 security mechanisms\n   over Ethernet can still\
    \ be used.  The public access network using\n   IEEE 802.16 can secure isolation\
    \ of each of the upstream links\n   between hosts and AR by adopting SEcure Neighbor\
    \ Discovery (SEND)\n   [RFC3971] for securing neighbor discovery processes.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Multicast CID Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Multicast CID Deployment Considerations\n   Multicast CIDs are a\
    \ highly efficient means to distribute the same\n   information concurrently to\
    \ multiple SSs under the same BS.  However,\n   the deployment of multicast CIDs\
    \ for multicast or broadcast data\n   services suffers from the following drawbacks.\n\
    \   A drawback of multicast CIDs for Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 is the\n   unidirectional\
    \ nature of multicast CIDs.  While it is possible to\n   multicast information\
    \ downstream to a number of SSs in parallel,\n   there are no upstream multicast\
    \ connections.  In the upstream\n   direction, unicast CIDs have to be used for\
    \ sending multicast\n   messages over the air to the BS, requiring a special multicast\n\
    \   forwarding function for sending the information back to the other SSs\n  \
    \ on a multicast CID.  While similar in nature to a bridging function,\n   there\
    \ is no appropriate forwarding model available. [802.1D] cannot\n   take advantage\
    \ of the multicast CIDs because it relies on unicast\n   connections or bidirectional\
    \ broadcast connections.\n   A further drawback of deploying multicast CIDs for\
    \ distributing\n   broadcast control messages, like ARP Requests, is the inability\
    \ to\n   prevent the waking up of dormant-mode SSs by messages not aimed for\n\
    \   them.  Whenever a message is sent over a multicast CID, all\n   associated\
    \ stations have to power up and receive and process the\n   message.  While this\
    \ behavior is desirable for multicast and\n   broadcast traffic, it is harmful\
    \ for link-layer broadcast control\n   messages aimed for a single SS, like an\
    \ ARP Request.  All other SSs\n   are wasting scarce battery power for receiving,\
    \ decoding, and\n   discarding the message.  Low power consumption is an extremely\n\
    \   important aspect in a wireless communication.\n   Furthermore, it should be\
    \ kept in mind that multicast CIDs are only\n   efficient for a large number of\
    \ subscribed SSs in a cell.  Due to\n   incompatibility with advanced radio-layer\
    \ algorithms based on\n   feedback information from the receiver side, multicast\
    \ connections\n   require much more radio resources for transferring the same\n\
    \   information as unicast connections.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Centralized vs. Distributed Bridging
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Centralized vs. Distributed Bridging\n   This specification introduces\
    \ a network-side bridging function, which\n   can be realized either by a centralized\
    \ device or by multiple\n   interconnected bridges in a distributed manner.  One\
    \ common\n   implementation of the distributed model is the scenario where a\n\
    \   bridge is directly attached to the BS, such that the interface\n   between\
    \ BS and bridging function becomes a software interface within\n   the operation\
    \ system of the BS/bridge device.\n   The operational enhancements described in\
    \ Section 7 of this document\n   are based on the availability of additional information\
    \ about all the\n   hosts attached to the Ethernet.  Flooding all ports of the\
    \ bridge can\n   be avoided when a priori information is available to determine\
    \ the\n   port to which an Ethernet frame has to be delivered.\n   Best performance\
    \ can be reached by a centralized database containing\n   all information about\
    \ the hosts attached to the Ethernet.  A\n   centralized database can be established\
    \ by either a centralized\n   bridge device or a hierarchical bridging structure\
    \ with dedicated\n   uplink and downlink ports like in the public access case,\
    \ where the\n   uppermost bridge is able to retrieve and maintain all the\n  \
    \ information.\n   As the generic case of the IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16\
    \ link\n   model does not make any assumptions about the location of the AR (an\n\
    \   AR may eventually be attached to an SS), a centralized bridging\n   system\
    \ is recommended for the generic case.  In the centralized\n   system, every connection\
    \ over the air of a link should be attached to\n   a single centralized bridge.\n\
    \   A distributed bridging model is appropriate, in particular, for the\n   public\
    \ access mode, where Ethernet frames, which do not have entries\n   in the bridge\
    \ behind the BS, are sent upstream until finally reaching\n   a bridge that has\
    \ an entry for the destination MAC address.\n"
