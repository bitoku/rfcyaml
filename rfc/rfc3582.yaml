  - "Abstract\n   This document outlines a set of goals for proposed new IPv6 site-\n\
    \   multihoming architectures.  It is recognised that this set of goals\n   is\
    \ ambitious and that some goals may conflict with others.  The\n   solution or\
    \ solutions adopted may only be able to satisfy some of the\n   goals presented\
    \ here.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Site-multihoming, i.e., connecting to more than one IP service\n\
    \   provider, is an essential component of service for many sites which\n   are\
    \ part of the Internet.\n   Current IPv4 site-multihoming practices have been\
    \ added on to the\n   CIDR architecture [1], which assumes that routing table\
    \ entries can\n   be aggregated based upon a hierarchy of customers and service\n\
    \   providers.\n   However, it appears that this hierarchy is being supplanted\
    \ by a\n   dense mesh of interconnections [6].  Additionally, there has been an\n\
    \   enormous growth in the number of multihomed sites.  For purposes of\n   redundancy\
    \ and load-sharing, the multihomed address blocks are\n   introduced into the\
    \ global table even if they are covered by a\n   provider aggregate.  This contributes\
    \ to the rapidly-increasing size\n   of both the global routing table and the\
    \ turbulence exhibited within\n   it, and places stress on the inter-provider\
    \ routing system.\n   Continued growth of both the Internet and the practice of\
    \ site-\n   multihoming will seriously exacerbate this stress.  The site-\n  \
    \ multihoming architecture for IPv6 should allow the routing system to\n   scale\
    \ more pleasantly.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   A \"site\" is an entity autonomously operating a network\
    \ using IP, and\n   in particular, determining the addressing plan and routing\
    \ policy for\n   that network.  This definition is intended to be equivalent to\n\
    \   \"enterprise\" as defined in [2].\n   A \"transit provider\" operates a site\
    \ that directly provides\n   connectivity to the Internet to one or more external\
    \ sites.  The\n   connectivity provided extends beyond the transit provider's\
    \ own site.\n   A transit provider's site is directly connected to the sites for\n\
    \   which it provides transit.\n   A \"multihomed\" site is one with more than\
    \ one transit provider.\n   \"Site-multihoming\" is the practice of arranging\
    \ a site to be\n   multihomed.\n   The term \"re-homing\" denotes a transition\
    \ of a site between two\n   states of connectedness due to a change in the connectivity\
    \ between\n   the site and its transit providers' sites.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Capabilities of IPv4 Multihoming
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Capabilities of IPv4 Multihoming\n   The following capabilities of current\
    \ IPv4 multihoming practices\n   should be supported by an IPv6 multihoming architecture.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Redundancy
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Redundancy\n   By multihoming, a site should be able to insulate itself\
    \ from certain\n   failure modes within one or more transit providers, as well\
    \ as\n   failures in the network providing interconnection among one or more\n\
    \   transit providers.\n   Infrastructural commonalities below the IP layer may\
    \ result in\n   connectivity which is apparently diverse, sharing single points\
    \ of\n   failure.  For example, two separate DS3 circuits ordered from\n   different\
    \ suppliers and connecting a site to independent transit\n   providers may share\
    \ a single conduit from the street into a building;\n   in this case, physical\
    \ disruption (sometimes referred to as\n   \"backhoe-fade\") of both circuits\
    \ may be experienced due to a single\n   incident in the street.  The two circuits\
    \ are said to \"share fate\".\n   The multihoming architecture should accommodate\
    \ (in the general case,\n   issues of shared fate notwithstanding) continuity\
    \ of connectivity\n   during the following failures:\n   o  Physical failure,\
    \ such as a fiber cut, or router failure,\n   o  Logical link failure, such as\
    \ a misbehaving router interface,\n   o  Routing protocol failure, such as a BGP\
    \ peer reset,\n   o  Transit provider failure, such as a backbone-wide IGP failure,\
    \ and\n   o  Exchange failure, such as a BGP reset on an inter-provider\n    \
    \  peering.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Load Sharing
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Load Sharing\n   By multihoming, a site should be able to distribute\
    \ both inbound and\n   outbound traffic between multiple transit providers.  This\
    \ goal is\n   for concurrent use of the multiple transit providers, not just the\n\
    \   usage of one provider over one interval of time and another provider\n   over\
    \ a different interval.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Performance
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Performance\n   By multihoming, a site should be able to protect itself\
    \ from\n   performance difficulties directly between the site's transit\n   providers.\n\
    \   For example, suppose site E obtains transit from transit providers T1\n  \
    \ and T2, and there is long-term congestion between T1 and T2.  The\n   multihoming\
    \ architecture should allow E to ensure that in normal\n   operation, none of\
    \ its traffic is carried over the congested\n   interconnection T1-T2.  The process\
    \ by which this is achieved should\n   be a manual one.\n   A multihomed site\
    \ should be able to distribute inbound traffic from\n   particular multiple transit\
    \ providers according to the particular\n   address range within their site which\
    \ is sourcing or sinking the\n   traffic.\n"
- title: 3.1.4.  Policy
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Policy\n   A customer may choose to multihome for a variety of policy\
    \ reasons\n   beyond technical scope (e.g., cost, acceptable use conditions, etc.)\n\
    \   For example, customer C homed to ISP A may wish to shift traffic of a\n  \
    \ certain class or application, NNTP, for example, to ISP B as matter\n   of policy.\
    \  A new IPv6 multihoming proposal should provide support\n   for site-multihoming\
    \ for external policy reasons.\n"
- title: 3.1.5.  Simplicity
  contents:
  - "3.1.5.  Simplicity\n   As any proposed multihoming solution must be deployed\
    \ in real\n   networks with real customers, simplicity is paramount.  The current\n\
    \   multihoming solution is quite straightforward to deploy and maintain.\n  \
    \ A new IPv6 multihoming solution should not be substantially more\n   complex\
    \ to deploy and operate (for multihomed sites or for the rest\n   of the Internet)\
    \ than current IPv4 multihoming practices.\n"
- title: 3.1.6.  Transport-Layer Survivability
  contents:
  - "3.1.6.  Transport-Layer Survivability\n   Multihoming solutions should provide\
    \ re-homing transparency for\n   transport-layer sessions; i.e., exchange of data\
    \ between devices on\n   the multihomed site and devices elsewhere on the Internet\
    \ may proceed\n   with no greater interruption than that associated with the transient\n\
    \   packet loss during the re-homing event.\n   New transport-layer sessions should\
    \ be able to be created following a\n   re-homing event.\n   Transport-layer sessions\
    \ include those involving transport-layer\n   protocols such as TCP, UDP and SCTP\
    \ over IP.  Applications which\n   communicate over raw IP and other network-layer\
    \ protocols may also\n   enjoy re-homing transparency.\n"
- title: 3.1.7.  Impact on DNS
  contents:
  - "3.1.7.  Impact on DNS\n   Multi-homing solutions either should be compatible\
    \ with the observed\n   dynamics of the current DNS system, or the solutions should\n\
    \   demonstrate that the modified name resolution system required to\n   support\
    \ them is readily deployable.\n"
- title: 3.1.8.  Packet Filtering
  contents:
  - "3.1.8.  Packet Filtering\n   Multihoming solutions should not preclude filtering\
    \ packets with\n   forged or otherwise inappropriate source IP addresses at the\n\
    \   administrative boundary of the multihomed site, or at the\n   administrative\
    \ boundaries of any site in the Internet.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Scalability\n   Current IPV4 multihoming practices contribute to the\
    \ significant\n   growth currently observed in the state held in the global inter-\n\
    \   provider routing system; this is a concern, both because of the\n   hardware\
    \ requirements it imposes, and also because of the impact on\n   the stability\
    \ of the routing system.  This issue is discussed in\n   great detail in [6].\n\
    \   A new IPv6 multihoming architecture should scale to accommodate\n   orders\
    \ of magnitude more multihomed sites without imposing\n   unreasonable requirements\
    \ on the routing system.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Impact on Routers
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Impact on Routers\n   The solutions may require changes to IPv6 router\
    \ implementations, but\n   these changes should be either minor, or in the form\
    \ of logically\n   separate functions added to existing functions.\n   Such changes\
    \ should not prevent normal single-homed operation, and\n   routers implementing\
    \ these changes should be able to interoperate\n   fully with hosts and routers\
    \ not implementing them.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Impact on Hosts
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Impact on Hosts\n   The solution should not destroy IPv6 connectivity\
    \ for a legacy host\n   implementing RFC 3513 [3], RFC 2460 [4], RFC 3493 [5],\
    \ and other\n   basic IPv6 specifications current in April 2003.  That is to say,\
    \ if\n   a host can work in a single-homed site, it should still be able to\n\
    \   work in a multihomed site, even if it cannot benefit from site-\n   multihoming.\n\
    \   It would be compatible with this goal for such a host to lose\n   connectivity\
    \ if a site lost connectivity to one transit provider,\n   despite the fact that\
    \ other transit provider connections were still\n   operational.\n   If the solution\
    \ requires changes to the host stack, these changes\n   should be either minor,\
    \ or in the form of logically separate\n   functions added to existing functions.\n\
    \   If the solution requires changes to the socket API and/or the\n   transport\
    \ layer, it should be possible to retain the original socket\n   API and transport\
    \ protocols in parallel, even if they cannot benefit\n   from multihoming.\n \
    \  The multihoming solution may allow host or application changes if\n   that\
    \ would enhance transport-layer survivability.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  Interaction between Hosts and the Routing System
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  Interaction between Hosts and the Routing System\n   The solution may\
    \ involve interaction between a site's hosts and its\n   routing system; such\
    \ an interaction should be simple, scalable and\n   securable.\n"
- title: 3.2.5.  Operations and Management
  contents:
  - "3.2.5.  Operations and Management\n   It should be possible for staff responsible\
    \ for the operation of a\n   site to monitor and configure the site's multihoming\
    \ system.\n"
- title: 3.2.6.  Cooperation between Transit Providers
  contents:
  - "3.2.6.  Cooperation between Transit Providers\n   A multihoming strategy may\
    \ require cooperation between a site and its\n   transit providers, but should\
    \ not require cooperation (relating\n   specifically to the multihomed site) directly\
    \ between the transit\n   providers.\n   The impact of any inter-site cooperation\
    \ that might be required to\n   facilitate the multihoming solution should be\
    \ examined and assessed\n   from the point of view of operational practicality.\n"
- title: 3.2.7.  Multiple Solutions
  contents:
  - "3.2.7.  Multiple Solutions\n   There may be more than one approach to multihoming,\
    \ provided all\n   approaches are orthogonal (i.e., each approach addresses a\
    \ distinct\n   segment or category within the site multihoming problem).  Multiple\n\
    \   solutions will incur a greater management overhead, however, and the\n   adopted\
    \ solutions should attempt to cover as many multihoming\n   scenarios and goals\
    \ as possible.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   A multihomed site should not be more vulnerable\
    \ to security breaches\n   than a traditionally IPv4-multihomed site.\n   Any\
    \ changes to routing practices made to accommodate multihomed sites\n   should\
    \ not cause non-multihomed sites to become more vulnerable to\n   security breaches.\n"
