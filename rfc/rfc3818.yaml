- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working\n\
    \   group (pppext) includes the responsibility to \"actively advance PPP's\n \
    \  most useful extensions to full standard, while defending against\n   further\
    \ enhancements of questionable value.\"  In support of that\n   charter, the allocation\
    \ of PPP protocol and other assigned numbers\n   will no longer be \"first come\
    \ first served.\"\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Point-to-Point protocol (PPP, RFC 1661 [1]) is a mature\
    \ protocol\n   with a large number of subprotocols, encapsulations and other\n\
    \   extensions.  The main protocol as well as its extensions involve many\n  \
    \ name spaces in which values must be assigned.\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp-numbers\
    \ contains a list of the\n   address spaces and their current assignments.\n \
    \  Historically, initial values in new name spaces have often been\n   chosen\
    \ in the RFCs creating the name spaces.  The IANA made\n   subsequent assignments\
    \ with a \"First Come First Served\" policy.  This\n   memo changes that policy\
    \ for some PPP address spaces.\n   Most of the PPP names spaces are quiescent,\
    \ but some continue to\n   attract proposed extensions.  Extensions of PPP have\
    \ been defined in\n   RFCs that are \"Informational\" and so are not subject to\
    \ review.\n   These extensions usually require values assigned in one or more\
    \ of\n   the PPP name spaces.  Making these allocations require \"IETF\n   Consensus\"\
    \ will ensure that proposals are reviewed.\n"
- title: Terminology
  contents:
  - "Terminology\n   The terms \"name space\", \"assigned value\", and \"registration\"\
    \ are used\n   here with the meanings defined in BCP 26 [2].  The policies \"\
    First\n   Come First Served\" and \"IETF Consensus\" used here also have the\n\
    \   meanings defined in BCP 26.\n"
