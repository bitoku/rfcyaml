  - "Abstract\n   When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks, it has to
    be\n   re-authenticated.  If the home network has both multiple\n   Authentication
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers and Home\n   Agents (HAs) in use, the
    Home AAA server may not have sufficient\n   information to process the re-authentication
    correctly (i.e., to\n   ensure that the same HA continues to be used).  This document
    defines\n   a Mobile IP extension that carries identities for the Home AAA and
    HA\n   servers in the form of Network Access Identifiers (NAIs).  The\n   extension
    allows a Home Agent to pass its identity (and that of the\n   Home AAA server)
    to the mobile node, which can then pass it on to the\n   local AAA server when
    changing its point of attachment.  This\n   extension may also be used in other
    situations requiring\n   communication of a NAI between Mobile IP nodes.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   When building networks one would like to be able to have
    redundancy.\n   In order to achieve this, one might place multiple AAA servers
    in one\n   domain.  When a mobile node registers via a visited network, the\n
    \  authentication will be handled by one of the AAA servers in the home\n   domain.
    \ At a later point, when the mobile node moves to another\n   visited domain it
    again has to be authenticated.  However, due to the\n   redundancy offered by
    the AAA protocol, it can not be guaranteed that\n   the authentication will be
    handled by the same AAAH server as the\n   previous one, which can result in the
    new AAAH not knowing to which\n   HA the session was assigned.  This document
    defines a Mobile IP\n   extension which can be used to distribute the information
    needed to\n   resolve this.\n   Furthermore, the only information that is normally
    available about\n   the home agent in the registration request is the IP address
    as\n   defined in RFC 3344 [5].  Unfortunately this may not be enough since\n
    \  some AAA infrastructures (such as Diameter [6]) use realm based\n   routing;
    such a AAA infrastructure needs to know the FQDN identity of\n   the home agent
    to be able to correctly handle the assignment of the\n   home agent.  A reverse
    DNS lookup would only disclose the identity of\n   the Mobile IP interface for
    that HA IP address, which may or may not\n   have a one-to-one correspondence
    with the home agent FQDN identity.\n   This is a reason for the HA to also include
    its own identity in the\n   registration reply.  The MIP v4 extension defined
    in this document\n   also has a subtype defined by which this may be done.  The
    HA\n   identity can then be included by the mobile node in later\n   registration
    requests when changing the point of attachment.\n"

      agent adds a NAI Carrying Extension to a\n   registration message, the extension
      MUST appear prior to any\n   authentication extensions.\n   In the event the
      foreign agent adds a NAI Carrying Extension to a\n   registration message, the
      extension MUST appear prior to any\n   authentication extensions added by the
      FA.\n   If an HA has appended a NAI Carrying Extension to a Registration\n   Reply
      to an MN, and does not receive the NAI extension in subsequent\n   Registration
      Request messages from the MN, the HA can assume that the\n   MN does not understand
      this NAI extension.  In this case, the HA\n   SHOULD NOT append this NAI extension
      to further Registration Reply\n   messages to the MN.\n"

    Extension.  It\n   contains the NAI of the HA in the form hostname@realm.  Together
    the\n   hostname and realm form the complete FQDN (hostname.realm) of the HA.\n
    \  A Home Agent using this extension MUST provide it in the first\n   Registration
    Reply sent to a Mobile Node which is not currently\n   registered.  The extension
    only need to be included in subsequent\n   Registration Replies if the same extension
    is included in\n   Registration Requests received from the same Mobile Node.\n
    \  A mobile node using this extension MUST, if it receives it in a\n   registration
    reply message, provide it in every subsequent\n   registration request when re-authentication
    is needed.  Failure to\n   re-authenticate, for instance because no AAAH can be
    reached, will\n   result in termination of the Mobile-IP session.  Upon initiation
    of a\n   new session a new HA Identity NAI may be provided to the Mobile node,\n
    \  and the requirement above will apply to the newly received NAI.\n   If the
    mobile node requires a specific home agent and it has the NAI\n   available it
    MUST provide this extension in its initial registration\n   request.\n   A foreign
    agent which receives the Home Agent NAI by this extension\n   in a registration
    request SHOULD include the Home Agent NAI when\n   requesting Mobile Node authentication
    through the AAA infrastructure\n   if the AAA protocol used can carry the information.\n"

  - "5.  AAAH Identity subtype\n   The AAAH identity uses subtype 2 of the NAI Carrying
    Extension.  It\n   contains the NAI of the home AAA server in the form hostname@realm.\n
    \  Together the hostname and realm form the complete FQDN\n   (hostname.realm)
    of the home AAA server.\n   If several AAA servers exist in the Home Network,
    a Home Agent\n   providing AAAH selection support according to this document MUST\n
    \  provide the AAAH identity in the first Registration Reply sent to the\n   Mobile
    Node.  The extension only needs to be included in subsequent\n   Registration
    Replies if the same extension is included in\n   Registration Requests received
    from the same Mobile Node.\n   A mobile node SHOULD save the latest AAAH Identity
    received in a\n   registration reply message and SHOULD provide the AAAH Identity
    in\n   every registration request sent when re-authenticating, for\n   efficiency
    reasons.  Failure to reach the indicated AAAH during re-\n   authentication will
    result in a new AAAH Identity NAI being returned\n   (which should then be saved
    and provided in subsequent registration\n   requests).  Similarly, failure to
    re-authenticate, for instance\n   because no AAAH can be reached, will result
    in termination of the\n   Mobile-IP session; on initiation of a new session, a
    new AAAH\n   Identity NAI may be provided to the Mobile Node for re-use during\n
    \  later re-registrations.\n   A foreign agent which receives the AAAH NAI by
    this extension in a\n   registration request SHOULD include the AAAH NAI provided
    when\n   requesting Mobile Node authentication through the AAA infrastructure\n
    \  if the AAA protocol used can carry the information.\n"

    that are used\n   to carry mobility agent and AAA server identities, in the form
    of\n   Network Access Identifiers.  The Mobile IP messages that carry this\n   extension
    MUST be authenticated as described in [4], unless other\n   authentication methods
    have been agreed upon.  Therefore, this\n   specification does not lessen the
    security of Mobile IP messages.\n   It should be noted that the identities sent
    in the extensions\n   specified herein MAY be sent in the clear over the network.
    \ However,\n   the authors do not envision that this information would create\n
    \  security issues.\n"

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines one new mobile IP extension,
    and one new Mobile\n   IP extension sub-type numbering space to be managed by
    IANA.\n   Section 3 defines a new Mobile IP extension, the Mobile IP NAI\n   Carrying
    Extension.  The type number for this extension is 136.  This\n   extension introduces
    a new sub-type numbering space where the values\n   1 and 2 have been assigned
    in this document.  Approval of new Mobile\n   IP NAI Carrying Extension sub-type
    numbers is subject to Expert\n   Review, and a specification is required [3].\n
    \  The content and format for this extension is not specific to AAA\n   NAIs,
    so if in the future new NAIs are defined which do not strictly\n   fall within
    the category of AAA NAIs, they may nevertheless be\n   accommodated within the
    subtype numbering space defined for the NAI\n   Carrying Extension defined in
    this document.\n   The NAI Carrying Extension should be assigned a type value
    from both\n   the IANA number space for Mobile IPv4 skippable extensions and from\n
    \  the IANA number space for Mobile IPv4 advertisement extensions.\n   Ideally,
    the numbers assigned from these two numbering spaces should\n   have the same
    value.\n"
