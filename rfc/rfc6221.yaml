  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC3315] are deployed to forward DHCPv6
    messages\n   between clients and servers when they are not on the same IPv6 link\n
    \  and are often implemented alongside a routing function in a common\n   node.
    \ A Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) allows Relay Agent\n   Information to
    be inserted by an access node that performs a link-\n   layer bridging (i.e.,
    non-routing) function.  An LDRA resides on the\n   same IPv6 link as the client
    and a DHCPv6 Relay Agent or server, and\n   is functionally the equivalent of
    the Layer 2 Relay Agent proposed\n   for DHCPv4 operation in [L2RA].\n   Unlike
    a DHCPv6 Relay Agent specified in [RFC3315], an LDRA does not\n   implement any
    IPv6 control functions (e.g., ICMPv6) or have any\n   routing capability in the
    node.\n"

  - "2.  Background\n   A variety of different link-layer network topologies exist
    for the\n   aggregation of IPv6 nodes into one or more routers.  In Layer 2\n
    \  aggregation networks (IEEE 802.1D bridging or similar) that have many\n   nodes
    on a single link, a DHCPv6 server or DHCP Relay Agent would\n   normally be unaware
    of how a DHCP client is attached to the network.\n   The LDRA allows Relay Agent
    Information, including the Interface-ID\n   option [RFC3315], to be inserted by
    the access node so that it may be\n   used by the DHCPv6 server for client identification.
    \ A typical\n   application in a broadband service provider could be equivalent
    to a\n   Layer 2 DHCP Relay Agent as described in the Broadband Forum TR-101\n
    \  report [TR-101] and in [L2RA].\n"

    - "7.3.  Relay Agent in Front of LDRA\n   The client and server are on different
      IPv6 links, separated by one\n   or more relay agents that will typically act
      as a router, and there\n   is an [RFC3315] Relay Agent on the client-facing
      interface of the\n   LDRA.  The LDRA will send Relay-Forward messages upstream
      towards the\n   second relay agent, which in turn will process the messages.\n

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The security issues pertaining to DHCPv6 Relay
    Agents as specified in\n   Section 23 of [RFC3315] are also applicable to LDRAs.
    \ The LDRA\n   SHOULD implement some form of rate-limiting on client-originated\n
    \  traffic in order to prevent excessive process utilisation.  The\n   traffic
    to be rate-limited can be easily identified since the LDRA\n   listens only to
    client-originated IPv6 traffic sent to the\n   All_DHCPv6_Servers_and_Relay_Agents
    address on UDP port 547 and does\n   not process any other client-originated traffic.
    \ As DHCP is session-\n   oriented, messages in excess of the rate-limit may be
    silently\n   discarded.\n   The hop-count-based determination of the trustworthiness
    of the LDRA\n   can be easily defeated by a rogue relay agent on the network-facing\n
    \  interface of the LDRA.\n"
