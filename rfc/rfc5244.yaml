  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document extends the set of telephony events defined\
    \ within the\n   framework of RFC 4733 [4] to include signalling events that can\n\
    \   appear on a circuit in the telephone network.  Most of these events\n   correspond\
    \ to signals within one of several channel-associated\n   signalling systems still\
    \ in use in the PSTN.\n   Trunks (or circuits) in the PSTN are the media paths\
    \ between\n   telephone switches.  A succession of protocols have been developed\n\
    \   using tones and electrical conditions on individual trunks to set up\n   telephone\
    \ calls using them.  The events defined in this document\n   support an application\
    \ where such PSTN signalling is carried between\n   two gateways without being\
    \ signalled in the IP network: the \"RTP\n   trunk\" application.\n   In the \"\
    RTP trunk\" application, RTP is used to replace a normal\n   circuit-switched\
    \ trunk between two nodes.  This is particularly of\n   interest in a telephone\
    \ network that is still mostly\n   circuit-switched.  In this case, each end of\
    \ the RTP trunk encodes\n   audio channels into the appropriate encoding, such\
    \ as G.723.1 [13] or\n   G.729 [14].  However, this encoding process destroys\
    \ in-band\n   signalling information that is carried using the least-significant\n\
    \   bit (\"robbed bit signalling\") and may also interfere with in-band\n   signalling\
    \ tones, such as the MF (multi-frequency) digit tones.\n   In a typical application,\
    \ the gateways may exchange roles from one\n   call to the next: they must be\
    \ capable of either sending or receiving\n   each implemented signal in Table\
    \ 1.\n   This document defines events related to four different signalling\n \
    \  systems.  Three of these are based on the exchange of multi-frequency\n   tones.\
    \  The fourth operates on digital trunks only, and makes use of\n   low-order\
    \ bits stolen from the encoded media.  In addition, this\n   document defines\
    \ tone events for supporting tasks such as continuity\n   testing of the media\
    \ path.\n      Implementors are warned that the descriptions of signalling\n \
    \     systems given below are incomplete.  They are provided to give\n      context\
    \ to the related event definitions, but omit many details\n      important to\
    \ implementation.\n"

  - "2.  Event Definitions\n   Table 1 lists all of the events defined in this document.\
    \  As\n   indicated in Table 8 (Appendix A) of RFC 4733 [4], use of some of the\n\
    \   RFC 2833 [11] event codes has been deprecated because their\n   specification\
    \ was ambiguous, erroneous, or redundant.  In fact, the\n   degree of change from\
    \ Section 3.14 of RFC 2833 is such that\n   implementations of the present document\
    \ will be fully backward\n   compatible with RFC 2833 implementations only in\
    \ the case of full\n   ABCD-bit signalling.  This document expands and improves\
    \ the coverage\n   of signalling systems compared to RFC 2833.\n   Note that the\
    \ IANA registry for telephony event codes was set up by\n   RFC 4733, not by RFC\
    \ 2833.  Thus, event code assignments originally\n   made in RFC 2833 appear in\

- title: 2.1.1.  Signalling System No. 5 Line Signals
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Signalling System No. 5 Line Signals\n   No. 5 line signalling uses tones\
    \ at two frequencies: 2400 and 2600\n   Hz.  The tones are used singly for most\
    \ signals, but together for the\n   Clear-forward and Release-guard.  (This reduces\
    \ the chance of an\n   accidental call release due to carried media content duplicating\
    \ one\n   of the frequencies.)  The specific signal indicated by a tone depends\n\
    \   on the stage of call set-up at which it is applied.\n   No events are defined\
    \ in support of No. 5 line signalling.  However,\n   implementations MAY use the\
    \ AB bit events described in Section 2.4\n   and shown in Table 1 to propagate\
    \ SS No. 5 line signals.  If they do\n   so, they MUST use the following mappings.\
    \  These mappings are based\n   on an underlying mapping equating A=0 to presence\
    \ of 2400 Hz signal\n   and B=0 to presence of 2600 Hz signal in the indicated\
    \ direction.\n   o  both 2400 and 2600 Hz present: event code 208;\n   o  2400\
    \ Hz present: event code 210;\n   o  2600 Hz present: event code 209;\n   o  neither\
    \ signal present: event code 211.\n   The initial event report for each signal\
    \ SHOULD be generated as soon\n   as the signal is recognized, and in any case\
    \ no later than the time\n   of recognition as indicated in ITU-T Recommendation\
    \ Q.141, Table 1\n   (i.e., 40 ms for \"seizing\" and \"proceed-to-send\", 125\
    \ ms for all\n   other signals).  The packetization interval following the initial\n\
    \   report SHOULD be chosen with considerations of reliable transmission\n   given\
    \ first priority.  Note that the receiver must supply its own\n   volume values\
    \ for converting these events back to tones.  Moreover,\n   the receiver MAY extend\
    \ the playout of \"seizing\" until it has\n   received the first report of a KP\
    \ event (see below), so that it has\n   better control of the interval between\
    \ ending of the seizing signal\n   and start of KP playout.\n      The KP has\
    \ to be sent beginning 80 +/- 20 ms after the SS No. 5\n      \"seizing\" signal\

  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Signalling System R2 Register Signals\n   In R2 signalling, the signalling\
    \ sequence is initiated from the\n   outgoing exchange by sending a line \"seizing\"\
    \ signal.  After the line\n   \"seizing\" signal (and \"seizing acknowledgment\"\
    \ signal in R2D), the\n   signalling sequence continues using MF register signals.\
    \  ITU-T\n   Recommendation Q.441 classifies the forward MF register signals\n\
    \   (upper frequencies) into Groups I and II, the backward MF register\n   signals\
    \ (lower frequencies) into Groups A and B.  These groups are\n   significant with\
    \ respect both to what sort of information they convey\n   and where they can\
    \ occur in the signalling sequence.\n   The tones used in R2 register signalling\
    \ are combinations of two out\n   of six frequencies.  National versions may be\
    \ reduced to 10 signals\n   (two out of five frequencies) or 6 signals (two out\
    \ of four\n   frequencies).\n   R2 register signalling is a compelled tone signalling\
    \ protocol,\n   meaning that one tone is played until an \"acknowledgment or directive\n\
    \   for the next tone\" is received that indicates that the original tone\n  \
    \ should cease.  A R2 forward register signal is acknowledged by a\n   backward\
    \ signal.  A backward signal is acknowledged by the end of the\n   forward signal.\
    \  In exceptional circumstances specified in ITU-T Rec.\n   Q.442, the downstream\
    \ entity may send backward signals autonomously\n   rather than in response to\
    \ specific forward signals.\n   In R2 signalling, the signalling sequence is initiated\
    \ from the\n   outgoing exchange by sending a forward Group I signal.  The first\n\
    \   forward signal is typically the first digit of the called number.\n   The\
    \ incoming exchange typically replies with a backward Group A-1\n   indicating\
    \ to the outgoing exchange to send the next digit of the\n   called number.\n\
    \   The tones have meaning; however, the meaning varies depending on\n   where\
    \ the tone occurs in the signalling.  The meaning may also depend\n   on the country.\
    \  Thus, to avoid an unmanageable number of events,\n   this document simply provides\
    \ means to indicate the 15 forward and 15\n   backward MF R2 tones (i.e., using\
    \ event codes 176-190 and 191-205,\n   respectively, as shown in Table 1).  The\
    \ frequency pairs for these\n   tones are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.\n   Note\
    \ that a naive strategy for onward relay of R2 inter-register\n   signals may\
    \ result in unacceptably long call setup times and timeouts\n   when the call\
    \ passes through several exchanges as well as a gateway\n   before terminating.\
    \  Several strategies are available for speeding up\n   the transfer of signalling\
    \ information across a given relay point.\n   In the worst case, the relay point\

- title: 2.4.  ABCD Transitional Signalling for Digital Trunks
  contents:
  - "2.4.  ABCD Transitional Signalling for Digital Trunks\n   ABCD is a 4-bit signalling\
    \ system used by digital trunks, where A, B,\n   C, and D are the designations\
    \ of the individual bits.  Signalling may\n   be 16-state (all four bits used),\
    \ 4-state (A and B bits used), or\n   2-state (A-bit only used).  ABCD signalling\
    \ events are all mutually\n   exclusive states.  The most recent state transition\
    \ determines the\n   current state.\n   When using Extended Super Frame (ESF)\
    \ T1 framing, signalling\n   information is sent as robbed bits in frames 6, 12,\
    \ 18, and 24.  A D4\n   superframe only transmits 4-state signalling with A and\
    \ B bits.  On\n   the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications (CEPT)\
    \ E1\n   frame, all signalling is carried in timeslot 16, and two channels of\n\
    \   16-state (ABCD) signalling are sent per frame.  ITU-T Recommendation\n   G.704\
    \ [10] gives the details of ABCD bit placement within the various\n   framing\
    \ arrangements.\n   The meaning of ABCD signals varies with the application. \
    \ One example\n   of a specification of ABCD signalling codes is T1.403.02 [16],\
    \ which\n   reflects North American practice for \"loop\" signalling as opposed\
    \ to\n   the trunk signalling discussed in previous sections.\n   Since ABCD information\
    \ is a state rather than a changing signal,\n   implementations SHOULD use the\
    \ following triple-redundancy mechanism,\n   similar to the one specified in ITU-T\
    \ Rec. I.366.2 [15], Annex L.  At\n   the time of a transition, the same ABCD\
    \ information is sent 3 times\n   at an interval of 5 ms.  If another transition\
    \ occurs during this\n   time, then this continues.  After a period of no change,\
    \ the ABCD\n   information is sent every 5 seconds.\n   As shown in Table 1, the\
    \ 16 possible states are represented by event\n   codes 144 to 159, respectively.\
    \  Implementations using these event\n   codes MUST map them to and from the ABCD\
    \ information based on the\n   following principles:\n   1.  State numbers are\
    \ derived from the used subset of ABCD bits by\n       treating them as a single\
    \ binary number, where the A bit is the\n       high-order bit.\n   2.  State\
    \ numbers map to event codes by order of increasing value\n       (i.e., state\
    \ number 0 maps to event code 144, ..., state number\n       15 maps to event\
    \ code 159).\n   If only the A and B bits are being used, then the mapping to\
    \ event\n   codes shall be as follows:\n   o  A=0, B=0 maps to event code 208;\n\
    \   o  A=0, B=1 maps to event code 209;\n   o  A=1, B=0 maps to event code 210;\n\
    \   o  A=1, B=1 maps to event code 211;\n   Finally, if only the A bit is used,\n\
    \   o  A = 0 maps to event code 206;\n   o  A = 1 maps to event code 207;\n  \
    \    Separate event codes are assigned to A-bit and AB-bit signalling\n      because,\
    \ as indicated in Rec. G.704 [10], when the B, C, and D\n      bits are unused,\
    \ their default values differ between transmission\n      systems.  By specifying\
    \ codes for only the used bits, this memo\n      allows the receiving gateway\
    \ to fill in the remaining bits\n      according to local configuration.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Continuity Tones
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Continuity Tones\n   Continuity tones are used for testing circuit continuity\
    \ during call\n   setup.  Two basic procedures are used.  In international practice,\n\
    \   clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.724 [8] describes a procedure\n   applicable\
    \ to four-wire trunk circuits, where a single 2000 +/- 20 Hz\n   check-tone is\
    \ transmitted from the initiating telephone switch.  The\n   remote switch sets\
    \ up a loopback, and the continuity check passes if\n   the sending switch can\
    \ detect the tone on the return path.  Clause 8\n   of Q.724 describes the procedure\
    \ for two-wire trunk circuits.  The\n   two-wire procedure involves two tones:\
    \ a 2000 Hz tone sent in the\n   forward direction and a 1780 +/- 20 Hz tone sent\
    \ in response.\n   Note that implementations often send a slightly different check-tone,\n\
    \   e.g., 2010 Hz, because of undesirable aliasing properties of 2000 Hz.\n  \
    \ If implementations use the telephone-events payload type to propagate\n   continuity\
    \ check-tones, they MUST map these tones to event codes as\n   follows:\n   o\
    \  For four-wire continuity testing, the 2000 Hz check-tone is mapped\n      to\
    \ event code 121.\n   o  For two-wire continuity testing, the initial 2000 Hz\
    \ check-tone Hz\n      tone is mapped to event code 121.  The 1780 Hz continuity\n\
    \      verify-tone is mapped to event code 122.\n"

- title: 3.  Congestion Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Congestion Considerations\n   The ability to adapt to congestion varies with\
    \ the signalling system\n   being used and also differs between line and register\
    \ signals.\n   With the specific exception of register signalling for S.S. No.\
    \ 5 and\n   R1/MF, the signals described in this document are fairly tolerant\
    \ of\n   lengthened durations, should these be necessary.  Thus in congested\n\
    \   conditions, the sender may adapt by lengthening the reporting\n   interval\
    \ for the tones concerned.  At the receiving end, if a tone is\n   being played\
    \ out and an under-run occurs due to delayed or lost\n   packets, it is best to\
    \ continue playing the tone until the next\n   packet arrives.  Interrupting a\
    \ tone prematurely, with or without\n   resumption, can cause the call setup attempt\
    \ to fail, whereas\n   extended playout just increases the call setup time.\n\
    \   Register signalling for S.S. No. 5 and R1/MF is subject to time\n   constraints.\
    \  Both the tone signals and the silent periods between\n   them have specified\
    \ durations and tolerances of the order of 5 to 10\n   ms.  The durations of the\
    \ individual tones are of the order of two to\n   three packetization intervals\
    \ (55/68 ms, with the initial KP lasting\n   100 ms).  The critical requirement\
    \ for transmission of the\n   telephony-event payload is that the receiver knows\
    \ which signal to\n   play out at a given moment.  It is less important that the\
    \ receiver\n   receive timely notification of the end of each tone.  Rather, it\n\
    \   should play out the sequence with the durations specified by the\n   signalling\
    \ standard instead of the actual durations reported.\n   These considerations\
    \ suggest that as soon as a register signal has\n   been reliably identified,\
    \ the sender should emit a report of that\n   tone.  It should then provide an\
    \ update within 5 ms for reliability\n   and no more updates until reporting the\
    \ end of the tone.\n   Increasing the playout buffer at the receiver during register\n\
    \   signalling will increase reliability.  This has to be weighed against\n  \
    \ the implied increase in call setup time.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The events for which event codes are provided\
    \ in this document relate\n   directly to the setup, billing, and takedown of\
    \ telephone calls.  As\n   such, they are subject, using the terminology of RFC\
    \ 3552 [12], to\n   threats to both communications and system security.  The attacks\
    \ of\n   concern are:\n   o  confidentiality violations (monitoring of calling\
    \ and called\n      numbers);\n   o  establishment of unauthorized telephone connections\
    \ through\n      message insertion;\n   o  hijacking of telephone connections\
    \ through message insertion or\n      man-in-the-middle modification of messages;\n\
    \   o  denial of service to individual telephone calls through message\n     \
    \ insertion, modification, deletion, or delay.\n   These attacks can be prevented\
    \ by the use of appropriate\n   confidentiality, authentication, or integrity\
    \ protection.  If\n   confidentiality, authentication, or integrity protection\
    \ are needed,\n   then Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [3] SHOULD be\
    \ used\n   with automated key management.\n   Additional security considerations\
    \ are described in RFC 4733 [4].\n"
