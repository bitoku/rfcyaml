  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a model for managing Routing Bridges\n
    \  (RBridges), also known as TRILL Switches, as defined in [RFC6325].\n   RBridges
    provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration\n   using IS-IS routing
    and encapsulation of traffic.  RBridges are\n   compatible with previous IEEE
    802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4\n   and IPv6 routers and end nodes.  They
    are as invisible to current IP\n   routers as bridges are and, like routers, they
    terminate the bridge\n   spanning tree protocol.  In creating an RBridge management
    model, the\n   device is viewed primarily as a customer bridge.  For a discussion
    of\n   the problem addressed by TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots\n   of
    Links), see [RFC5556].\n   RBridges support features specified for transparent
    bridges in\n   IEEE 802.1, and the corresponding MIB modules are used to manage\n
    \  those features.  For IS-IS purposes, the corresponding MIB module is\n   used
    to manage the protocol.  This MIB module specifies those objects\n   that are
    TRILL-specific and hence not available in other MIB modules.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
  title: 2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
- contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   The RBridge MIB module is intended as an overall framework for\n
    \  managing RBridges, also known as TRILL Switches.  Where possible, the\n   MIB
    references existing MIB definitions in order to maximize reuse.\n   This results
    in a considerable emphasis on the relationship with\n   other MIB modules.\n   Starting
    with the physical interfaces, there are requirements for\n   certain elements
    of the IF-MIB to be implemented.  These elements are\n   required in order to
    connect the per-port parameters to higher-level\n   functions of the physical
    device.\n   Transparent bridging, VLANs, traffic classes, and multicast filtering\n
    \  are supported by the TRILL protocol, and the corresponding management\n   is
    expected to conform to the BRIDGE-MIB module [RFC4188] and to the\n   P-BRIDGE-MIB
    and Q-BRIDGE-MIB modules [RFC4363].\n   The IS-IS routing protocol is used in
    order to determine the optimum\n   pair-wise forwarding path.  This protocol is
    managed using the IS-IS\n   MIB module defined in [RFC4444].  Since the TRILL
    protocol specifies\n   the use of a single level and a fixed area address of zero,
    some\n   IS-IS MIB objects are not applicable.  Some IS-IS MIB objects are\n   used
    in the TRILL protocol.\n"

      left vague in the Interfaces MIB module to avoid\n   over-constraining the MIB,
      thereby precluding management of certain\n   media types.  Section 4 of [RFC2863]
      enumerates several areas that a\n   media-specific MIB module must clarify.

  title: 7.  Definition of the RBridge MIB Module
- contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB relates to a system that will provide
    network connectivity\n   and packet-forwarding services.  As such, improper manipulation
    of\n   the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service\n   to
    a large number of end-users.\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  The following tables and objects in the RBRIDGE-MIB can be\n   manipulated
    to interfere with the operation of RBridges:\n   o  rbridgeBaseUniMultipathEnable
    affects the ability of the RBridge\n      to route unicast traffic over multiple
    paths, and\n      rbridgeBaseMultiMultipathEnable affects the ability of the RBridge\n
    \     to route multi-destination traffic over multiple paths.\n   o  rbridgeBasePortTable
    contains a number of objects that may affect\n      network connectivity.  Actions
    that may be triggered by\n      manipulating objects in this table include disabling
    of an RBridge\n      port, discarding of native packets, disabling learning, and\n
    \     others.\n   o  rbridgeEsadiTable contains objects that affect the operation
    of\n      the ESADI protocol used for learning, and manipulation of the\n      objects
    contained therein can be used to confuse the learning\n      ability of RBridges.\n
    \  o  rbridgeDtreePriority can affect computation of distribution trees\n      within
    an RBridge campus, thereby affecting the forwarding of\n      multi-destination
    traffic.\n   o  rbridgeTrillMinMtuDesired can affect the size of packets being\n
    \     used to exchange information between RBridges.\n   Some of the readable
    objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)
    may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It
    is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
    and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
    over\n   the network via SNMP.  For example, access to network topology and\n
    \  RBridge attributes can reveal information that should not be\n   available
    to all users of the network.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include
    adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using
    IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n
    \  access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB
    module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by
    the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance
    to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy
    via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm
    [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
    Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n
    \  [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior
    to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
    and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n   For other RBridge security considerations, see [RFC6325].\n"
