    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\

    \                   i. A value of 0 represents the\n                      'IPv4\
    \ Explicit NULL Label'.  This label\n                      value is only legal\
    \ at the bottom of the\n                      label stack.  It indicates that\
    \ the label\n                      stack must be popped, and the forwarding\n\
    \                      of the packet must then be based on the\n             \
    \         IPv4 header.\n                  ii. A value of 1 represents the\n  \
    \                    'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is\n            \
    \          legal anywhere in the label stack except at\n                     \
    \ the bottom.  When a received packet\n                      contains this label\
    \ value at the top of\n                      the label stack, it is delivered\
    \ to a\n                      local software module for processing.\n        \
    \              The actual forwarding of the packet\n                      is determined\
    \ by the label beneath it\n                      in the stack.  However, if the\
    \ packet is\n                      forwarded further, the Router Alert Label\n\
    \                      should be pushed back onto the label stack\n          \
    \            before forwarding.  The use of this label\n                     \
    \ is analogous to the use of the\n                      'Router Alert Option'\
    \ in IP packets\n                      [RFC2113].  Since this label\n        \
    \              cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,\n                    \
    \  it is not associated with a\n                      particular network layer\
    \ protocol.\n                 iii. A value of 2 represents the\n             \
    \         'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label\n                      value\
    \ is only legal at the bottom of the\n                      label stack.  It indicates\
    \ that the label\n                      stack must be popped, and the forwarding\n\
    \                      of the packet must then be based on the\n             \
    \         IPv6 header.\n                  iv. A value of 3 represents the\n  \
    \                    'Implicit NULL Label'.\n                      This is a label\
    \ that an LSR may assign and\n                      distribute, but which never\
    \ actually\n                      appears in the encapsulation.  When an\n   \
    \                   LSR would otherwise replace the label\n                  \
    \    at the top of the stack with a new label,\n                      but the\
    \ new label is 'Implicit NULL',\n                      the LSR will pop the stack\
    \ instead of\n                      doing the replacement.  Although\n       \
    \               this value may never appear in the\n                      encapsulation,\

    \ 4-15 are reserved.\n              * The frame relay label can be either 10-bits\
    \ or\n                23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the\n     \
    \           upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,\n                respectively.\n\

    \ bits MUST be zero.\n              * The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains\

    \  Instead, it\n   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other\
    \ MPLS\n   MIB modules to define management objects.\n   Meaningful security considerations\

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has made a MIB OID assignment under the transmission\
    \ branch,\n   that is, assigned the mplsStdMIB under { transmission 166 }.  This\n\
    \   sub-id is requested because 166 is the ifType for mpls(166) and is\n   available\
    \ under transmission.\n   In the future, MPLS related standards track MIB modules\
    \ should be\n   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to\
    \ manage\n   that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards\n\
    \   Action as specified in [RFC2434].\n   The IANA has also assigned { mplsStdMIB\
    \ 1 } to the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB\n   specified in this document.\n"
