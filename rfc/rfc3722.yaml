- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The iSCSI protocol [RFC3720] provides a way for hosts to\
    \ access SCSI\n   [SAM2] devices over an IP network.  The iSCSI end-points, called\n\
    \   initiators and targets, each have a globally-unique name, defined in\n   [RFC3721].\n\
    \   An iSCSI name is a string of UTF-8 [RFC3629] characters that includes\n  \
    \ a type designator, a naming authority based on domain names, and a\n   unique\
    \ part within the naming authority.  The unique part may be\n   generated based\
    \ on anything the naming authority deems useful, and\n   may include user input.\n\
    \   These names may need to be transcribed (sent between two\n   administrators\
    \ via email, voice, paper, etc), so a case-insensitive\n   comparison would be\
    \ desirable.  However, these names must often be\n   compared by initiator and\
    \ target implementations, most of which are\n   done in simple, embedded software.\
    \  This makes case-sensitive\n   comparison highly desirable for these implementors.\n\
    \   However, a completely case-sensitive implementation would result in\n   identifiers\
    \ such as \"example-name\" and \"Example-Name\" being\n   different, which could\
    \ lead to confusion as these names are\n   transcribed.\n   The goal, then, is\
    \ to generate iSCSI names that can be transcribed\n   and entered by users, and\
    \ also compared byte-for-byte, with minimal\n   confusion.  To attain these goals,\
    \ iSCSI names are generalized using\n   a normalized character set (converted\
    \ to lower case or equivalent),\n   with no white space allowed, and very limited\
    \ punctuation.\n   For those using only ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F), the\n\
    \   following characters are allowed:\n   -  ASCII dash character ('-' = U+002d)\n\
    \   -  ASCII dot character ('.' = U+002e)\n   -  ASCII colon character (':' =\
    \ U+003a)\n   -  ASCII lower-case characters ('a'..'z' = U+0061..U+007a)\n   -\
    \  ASCII digit characters ('0'..'9' = U+0030..U+0039)\n   In addition, any upper-case\
    \ characters input via a user interface\n   MUST be mapped to their lower-case\
    \ equivalents.\n   This document specifies the valid character set for iSCSI names,\n\
    \   along with the rules for normalizing and generating iSCSI names based\n  \
    \ on user input or other information that contains international\n   characters.\n\
    \   In particular, it defines the following, as required by [RFC3454]:\n   - \
    \ The intended applicability of the profile: internationalized iSCSI\n      names.\n\
    \   -  The character repertoire that is the input and output to\n      stringprep:\
    \ Unicode 3.2, specified in section 3.\n   -  The mappings used: specified in\
    \ section 4.\n   -  The Unicode normalization used: specified in section 5.\n\
    \   -  The characters that are prohibited as output: specified in section\n  \
    \    6.\n   This profile MUST be used with the iSCSI protocol.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   Examples in this document use the notation for code points and names\n   from\
    \ the Unicode Standard [Unicode3.2] and ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646].\n   For example,\
    \ the letter \"a\" may be represented as either \"U+0061\" or\n   \"LATIN SMALL\
    \ LETTER A\".  In the lists of prohibited characters, the\n   \"U+\" is left off\
    \ to make the lists easier to read.  The comments for\n   character ranges are\
    \ shown in square brackets (such as \"[SYMBOLS]\")\n   and do not come from the\
    \ standards.\n"

  - "4.  Mapping\n   This profile specifies mapping using the following tables from\n\
    \   [RFC3454].  The following mapping tables MUST be used when generating\n  \

  contents:
  - "6.  Prohibited Output\n   This profile specifies prohibiting using the following\
    \ tables from\n   [RFC3454].  Characters appearing within these tables MUST NOT\
    \ be used\n   within an iSCSI name.\n      Table C.1.1\n      Table C.1.2\n  \
    \    Table C.2.1\n      Table C.2.2\n      Table C.3\n      Table C.4\n      Table\

    \ Important note: this profile MUST be used with the iSCSI protocol.\n   The iSCSI\
    \ protocol has additional naming rules that are checked\n   outside of this profile.\n\
    \   In addition, this profile adds the following prohibitions.  The full\n   set\
    \ of prohibited characters are those from the tables above plus\n   those listed\
    \ individually below.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2.  Currently-prohibited ASCII characters\n   Some of the ASCII characters\
    \ that are currently prohibited in iSCSI\n   names by [RFC3721] are also used\
    \ in protocol elements such as URIs.\n   Some examples are described in [RFC2396]\
    \ and [RFC2732].  Note that\n   there are many other RFCs that define additional\
    \ URI schemes.\n   The other characters in the range U+0000 to U+007F that are\
    \ not\n   currently allowed are prohibited in iSCSI names to reserve them for\n\
    \   future use in protocol elements.  Note that the dash (U+002D), dot\n   (U+002E),\
    \ and colon (U+003A) are not prohibited.\n   The following characters MUST NOT\
    \ be used in iSCSI names:\n      0000-002C; [ASCII CONTROL CHARACTERS and SPACE\
    \ through ,]\n      002F; [ASCII /]\n      003B-0040; [ASCII ; through @]\n  \

  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   ISO/IEC 10646 has many characters that look similar.\
    \  In many cases,\n   users of security protocols might do visual matching, such\
    \ as when\n   comparing the names of trusted third parties.  This profile does\n\
    \   nothing to map similar-looking characters together.\n   iSCSI names may be\
    \ used by an initiator to verify that a target it\n   has discovered is the correct\
    \ one, and by a target to verify that an\n   initiator is to be allowed access.\
    \  If these names are interpreted\n   and compared differently by different iSCSI\
    \ implementations, an\n   initiator could gain access to the wrong target, or\
    \ could be denied\n   access to a legitimate target.\n"
