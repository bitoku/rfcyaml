- title: 6.1  Network Addresses
  contents:
  - "6.1  Network Addresses\n This  Addendum  defines the Network Service Access Point\
    \ (NSAP)\n address. Since the term \"network address\" is commonly used in different\n\
    \ contexts to refer to different things a more specific description of\n this\
    \ concept is introduced below.\n 6.1.1  Subnetwork Address\n  In one context,\
    \ the term \"network address\" may be used to refer to the\n  point at which a\
    \ real end system, real subnetwork, or interworking\n  unit is attached to a real\
    \ subnetwork, or to the point at which the\n  subnetwork service is offered within\
    \ an end or intermediate system.\n  In the case of attachment to a public data\
    \ network, this point is\n  called a DTE/DCE interface, and the term \"DTE address\"\
    \ is used in\n  reference to it.\n  The  specific term \"subnetwork address\"\
    \ (or \"subnetwork point of\n  attachment address\") is used in this case, as\
    \ illustrated in Figure\n  6-1:\n                                           subnetwork\

    \          by subnetwork address                                      \n     \
    \               Figure 6-1 - Subnetwork Address\n  The subnetwork address is the\
    \ information that a real subnetwork needs\n  to identify a particular real end\
    \ system, another real subnetwork, or\n  interworking unit that is attached to\
    \ that real subnetwork.\n  In the public network environment, the subnetwork address\
    \ is what the\n  public network operates on.\n   Note: The point identified by\
    \ a subnetwork address is a point of\n   interconnection between a real end system\
    \ or interworking unit and a\n   real subnetwork (in particular, in a public data\
    \ network environment,\n   a DTE/DCE interface), and is not an OSI Service Access\
    \ Point.\n 6.1.2  NSAP address\n  In another context, the term \"network address\"\
    \ is used to refer to the\n  Network Service Access Point (NSAP) at which the\
    \ OSI Network Service\n  is made available to a Network Service user by the Network\
    \ Service\n  provider.\n  The specific term \"NSAP address\" is used in this case,\
    \ as illustrated\n  in Figure 6-2:\n                         Network Service User\
    \ \n   layer 4                                                          \n   ______________________________\

    \ identified           \n                                          by NSAP address\
    \           \n                       Network Service Provider \n             \
    \          Figure 6-2 - NSAP Address\n  The NSAP address is the information that\
    \ the OSI Network Service\n  provider needs to identify a particular Network Service\
    \ Access Point.\n  The values of the called address, calling address, and responding\n\
    \  address parameters in the N-CONNECT primitive, of the responding\n  address\
    \ parameter in the N_DISCONNECT primitive, and of the source\n  address and destination\
    \ address parameters in the N-UNIDATA primitive,\n  are NSAP addresses.\n  Note\
    \ that since the Network Service primitives are conceptual, no\n  particular encoding\
    \ of the NSAP address is specified by the Network\n  Service Definition.\n  In\
    \ both CCITT and ISO usage, the terms \"Network Address\" (with both\n  the N\
    \ and the A printed in capital letters) and \"global network\n  address\" are\
    \ synonymous with the term \"NSAP address\". Use of the term\n  \"NSAP address\"\
    \ is preferred when it is essential to avoid confusion,\n  particularly in spoken\
    \ references where \"capitalization\" is not\n  possible.\n 6.1.3  Network Protocol\
    \ Address Information\n  In a third context, the term \"network address\" is used\
    \ to refer to an\n  address that is carried as network protocol control information\
    \ in a\n  network protocol data unit (NPDU).\n  The specific term \"network protocol\
    \ address information\" (NPAI) is\n  used in this case.\n  In the public network\
    \ environment, NPAI is also known as an \"address\n  signal\" or as the \"coding\
    \ of an address signal\".\n  There is a relationship between the NSAP address\
    \ that appears in\n  Network Service primitives and the NPAI that appears in a\
    \ Network\n  Layer protocol, in that the semantics of the NSAP address is preserved\n\
    \  by the NPAI.  The syntax and encoding of NPAI are defined by Network\n  layer\
    \ Protocol standards, which also specify the relationship between\n  the NSAP\
    \ address and the NPAI encoding employed by the protocol.\n"

- title: 7.1  Hierarchical Structure of NSAP Addresses
  contents:
  - "7.1  Hierarchical Structure of NSAP Addresses\n NSAP addresses are based on the\
    \ concept of hierarchical addressing\n domains, as explained in Clause 6.  Each\
    \ domain may be further\n partitioned into subdomains.  Accordingly, NSAP addresses\
    \ have a\n hierarchical structure.\n The conceptual structure of NSAP addresses\
    \ follows the principle that,\n at any level of the hierarchy, an initial part\
    \ of the address\n unambiguously identifies a subdomain, and the rest is allocated\
    \ by the\n management of the subdomain to unambiguously identify either a lower\n\
    \ level subdomain or an NSAP within the subdomain. The part of the\n address that\
    \ identifies the subdomain depends on the level at which the\n address is viewed.\n\
    \  Note:  This conceptual structure should not be considered as implying\n  any\
    \ detailed administration of NSAP addresses.\n Graphical representation of the\
    \ hierarchical structure of NSAP\n addresses may be made according to an inverted\

  - "7.2 Global Identification of any NSAP\n In the context of Open Systems Interconnection,\
    \ it is possible to\n identify any NSAP within the global network addressing domain\
    \ (see\n Clause 6.2.1). Consequently,\n  a)  At any Network Service Access Point,\
    \ it is possible to identify\n      any other Network Service Access Point, within\
    \ any OSI end system;\n  b)  A global Network Address can therefore be defined\
    \ to unambiguously\n      identify any Network Service Access Point;\n  c)  The\
    \ OSI protocols established between correspondent Network\n      entities convey\
    \ the complete information contained in a Network\n      Address (see Clause 6.1.4);\n\
    \  d)  An NSAP address identifies the same NSAP regardless of which\n      NS-user\
    \ enunciated the address; and\n  e)  An NS-user, when given an NSAP address of\
    \ the NS-provider in a\n      primitive Indication, may subsequently use that\
    \ NSAP address in\n      another instance of communication with the corresponding\
    \ NSAP.\n Some restrictions may be placed on communications in the context of\n\
    \ OSI, on the basis of: technical feasibility of an interconnection,\n security,\
    \ charging, etc. Such considerations are not related to Network\n Layer addressing,\
    \ and therefore are not discussed in this Addendum.\n  Note:  The global identification\
    \ of NSAPs should not be taken to imply\n  the universal availability of directory\
    \ functions required to enable\n  communication among all NSAPs to which NSAP\
    \ addresses have been\n  allocated.\n"

  - "7.3 Route Independence\n Network Service users cannot derive routing information\
    \ from an NSAP\n address. They cannot influence the Network Service provider's\
    \ choice of\n route by means of the source and destination NSAP addresses. Similarly,\n\
    \ they cannot deduce from the source and destination NSAP addresses the\n route\
    \ that was used by the Network Service provider. This is not\n intended to exclude\
    \ the possibility that an OSI end system may need to\n influence the route selected\
    \ for a particular instance of communication\n with another OSI end system. (In\
    \ particular, it may need to influence\n the selection of intermediate systems\
    \ to be used, and the paths to be\n taken between them.) The means whereby such\
    \ an influence may be exerted\n is, however, not the NSAP address. Elements of\
    \ Network Layer protocol\n may be required to control routing within intermediate\
    \ systems; such\n elements of protocol are distinct from the network protocol\
    \ address\n information (NPAI).\n Notwithstanding the restrictions imposed on\
    \ the use that a Network\n Service user may make of an NSAP address, it is recognized\
    \ that NSAP\n addresses should be constructed in such a way that routing through\n\
    \ interconnected subnetworks is facilitated. That is, the Network Service\n provider\
    \ and relay-entities in particular, may take advantage of the\n address structure\
    \ to achieve economical processing of routing aspects.\n"

  - "7.4 Service Type Independence\n It may be necessary for Network Service users\
    \ to distinguish Network\n Layer services of different types (such as point-to-point\
    \ versus\n multipoint services, and connection-mode versus connectionless-mode\n\
    \ services). The nature of such service types is not explicitly contained\n in\
    \ the semantics of the NSAP address. Similarly, Network Layer quality\n of service\
    \ characteristics (such as throughput, transit delay, etc.)\n are not explicitly\
    \ specified by the NSAP address.\n"

    \ parts. The first part\n is the Initial Domain Part (IDP).  The second part is\
    \ the Domain\n Specific Part (DSP). This is illustrated by Figure 8-2.\n Following\
    \ the conceptual structure of NSAP addresses described in\n Clause 7.1, the IDP\

  contents:
  - "8.2  Network Address Abstract Syntax\n The Network Address is defined in this\
    \ Addendum in terms of an abstract\n syntax which expresses the semantics of the\
    \ Network Address. The use of\n this abstract syntax as a descriptive device enables\
    \ this Addendum to\n convey, in written form, a complete definition of the Network\
    \ Address\n without restricting it to the specific encoding of the NPAI. It also\n\
    \ enables this Addendum to identify two alternative preferred concrete\n synataxes\
    \ of the Network Address, to which reference may be made by\n Network Layer protocol\
    \ specification standards so as to unambiguously\n define the way in which the\
    \ Network Address is encoded as NPAI.\n 8.2.1  Abstract Syntax and Allocation\
    \ of the IDP\n  This clause defines the abstract syntax of the AFI, the currently\n\
    \  allocated values of the AFI, and the IDI formats corresponding to the\n  allocated\
    \ AFI values. Among the currently allocated values of the\n  AFIsare values reserved\
    \ for assignment to new IDI formats which may be\n  identified by ISO or CCITT.\
    \ Assignment of these AFI values to new IDI\n  formats by either ISO or CCITT\
    \ must be accompanied by appropriate\n  modification of this Addendum according\
    \ to the rules established by\n  ISO for revising International Standards. Allocation\
    \ of new AFI values\n  will be by joint agreement between ISO and CCITT, and will\
    \ require an\n  appropriate modification of this Addendum.\n  The abstract syntax\
    \ of the IDP is decimal digits. The allocation of\n  the AFI (see Clause 8.1.1)\
    \ ensures that the first decimal digit of the\n  IDP can never be zero.  This\
    \ provides a escape mechanism for use by\n  protocols that expect to hold incomplete\
    \ NSAP addresses in a field\n  that normally carries a complete NSAP address.\
    \ When the NSAP address\n  is represented as binary octets, the representation\
    \ of the IDP is as\n  defined in Clause 8.3.1.\n  The length of the IDP depends\
    \ on the IDI format specified by the value\n  of the AFI. The IDP length associated\
    \ with each IDI format is given in\n  clause 8.2.1.2.\n  8.2.1.1 Abstract Syntax\
    \ and Allocation of the AFI\n   The AFI consists of an integer with a value between\
    \ 0 and 99 with an\n   abstract syntax of two decimal digits.  The values of the\

    \    The IDI consists of a public switched telephone network (PSTN)\n    number\
    \ of up to 12 digits allocated according to CCITT\n    Recommendation E.163, commencing\

    \    The use of a particular IDI format as the basis for allocating an\n    NSAP\
    \ address does not constrain routing to that NSAP to go through\n    any particular\
    \ subnetwork. For example, the use of the E.163 IDI\n    format as the basis for\
    \ allocating an NSAP address does not mean\n    that access to the NSAP necessarily\
    \ involves use of the telephony\n    subnetwork (see clause 7.3).\n   Note 4:\n\
    \    Formats a, c, d, and e are based on specific CCITT numbering plans,\n   \
    \ and as such may be affected by any changes to those plans.  It\n    should be\
    \ understood that in identifying and describing these\n    formats, this Addendum\
    \ observes the current status of CCITT work on\n    numbering plans, and does\
    \ not establish any preference or position\n    whatsoever concerning the way\
    \ in which CCITT may choose to modify\n    the plans, or their relationships with\
    \ one another, in the future.\n    Changes to this may be necessary to take any\
    \ such further work by\n    CCITT into account.  For example, the CCITT numbering\
    \ plans in some\n    cases may provide escape mechanisms (such as a zero, 8, or\
    \ 9 prefix)\n    from one numbering plan to another.  This results in the possibility\n\
    \    of a choice that must be made concerning which of formats a, c, d,\n    and\
    \ e should be used for the allocation of NSAP addresses, and may\n    also lead\
    \ to suggestions that it is not necessary to include all of\n    the formats a,\
    \ c, d, and e in this Addendum.  Such choices, however,\n    are made within the\
    \ context and responsibility of CCITT, and no\n    preference for one choice or\
    \ another is made or implied by this\n    Addendum.\n 8.2.2 Abstract Syntax and\
    \ Allocation of the DSP\n  Values of the DSP are allocated by the authority identified\
    \ by the IDI\n  in the syntax identified by the AFI (see clauses 8.1.1.2 and 8.2.1.2).\n\
    \  The allocating authority specifies the format and semantics of the\n  DSP.\
    \ If the authority identified by the IDI authorizes one or  more\n  authorities\
    \ to allocate semantic parts of the DSP, then all those\n  authorities must allocate\
    \ using the same abstract syntax used by the\n  parent authority.\n  An authority\
    \ may choose to allocate NSAP addresses with the DSP in a\n  decimal or binary\
    \ abstract syntax for all IDI formats, and may choose\n  to allocate NSAP addresses\
    \ with the DSP in a character (ISO 646) or\n  National Character abstract syntax\
    \ when the IDI format is \"Local\" (see\n  Table 8-2). Clause 9 describes the\
    \ latter case in detail.\n 8.2.3 Abstract Syntax of the DSP\n  The DSP may be\
    \ allocated by the responsible authority in one of four\n  syntaxes, depending\
    \ on the value of the AFI:\n  a)  Binary:      The DSP consists of zero or more\
    \ binary octets, up to\n                    the maximum specified in Table 8-3.\n\
    \  b)  Decimal:     The DSP consists of zero or more decimal digits, up\n    \
    \                to the maximum specified in Table 8-3.\n  c)  Character:   The\
    \ DSP consists of zero or more of those graphic,\n                    characters\
    \ with no national variant, plus the space\n                    character, from\
    \ ISO 646, up to the maximum specified\n                    in Table 8-3.\n  d)\
    \  National Character:  The DSP consists of zero or more characters\n        \
    \            from a character set determined by the allocating\n             \
    \       authority, up to the maximum specified in Table 8-3.\n  Table 8-3 gives\
    \ the maximum length of the DSP in its abstract syntax\n  for each of the IDI\
    \ formats defined in clause 8.2.1.2. The\n  corresponding total NSAP address lengths\
    \ are given in clause 8.4.\n"

    \ \n  c)  the DSP, with an abstract syntax of a variable number of one and\n \
    \    only one of the following types: binary octets, decimal digits,\n     characters,\
    \ or national characters.\n This Addendum does not specify the way in which the\
    \ semantics of an\n NSAP address are encoded in Network Layer protocols by a concrete\n\
    \ syntax in NPAI (see Note following this clause).  These encodings are\n specified\
    \ in Network Layer protocol standards.\n  Note:  Encoding implies more than a\
    \ concrete syntax, such as the order\n  of bit transmission, representation as\
    \ tones or other signals, etc.\n Nevertheless, this Addendum identifies two alternative\
    \ concrete\n syntaxes (see clauses 8.3.1 and 8.3.2) of the Network Address.\n\
    \ Reference to these may be made by Network Layer protocol specification\n standards.\
    \ It is possible that the concrete syntax used to encode the\n Network Address\
    \ as NPAI in a Network Layer protocol may be chosen to be\n identical to one of\
    \ these concrete syntaxes. It is not required that\n this be the case, however\
    \ (see clause 9).\n The entire NSAP address taken as a whole may be represented\
    \ explicitly\n as a string of either decimal digits (decimal concrete syntax)\
    \ or\n binary octets (binary concrete syntax) as defined below.  Network Layer\n\
    \ protocol specifications making reference to this Addendum shall specify\n the\
    \ way in which either the decimal concrete syntax or the binary\n concrete syntax\
    \ of the NSAP address (or both) is encoded as NPAI (see\n clause 6.1.3).\n 8.3.1\
    \  Binary Concrete Syntax\n  The binary concrete syntax is generated by:\n   a)\
    \  using two semi-octets to represent the two digits of the AFI,\n       yielding\
    \ a value for each semi-octet in the rage 0000-1001;\n   b)  padding the IDI with\
    \ leading zero digits if necessary to obtain\n       the maximum IDI length (specified\
    \ for each IDI format in clause\n       8.2.1.2), then using a semi-octet to represent\
    \ the value of each\n       decimal  digit (including leading padding digits,\
    \ if preset),\n       yielding a value in the range 0000-1001; and, if the DSP\
    \ syntax\n       is not decimal digits, using the semi-octet value 1111 as a pad\n\
    \       after the final semi-octet (if necessary) to obtain an integral\n    \
    \   number of octets;\n   c) representing a decimal syntax DSP using the technique\
    \ described in\n       (b);\n   d)  representing a binary syntax DSP directly\
    \ as binary octets;\n   e)  when the IDI format is \"Local\", representing an\
    \ ISO 646 character\n       syntax DSP by converting each character to a number\
    \ in the range\n       32-127 using the ISO 646 encoding, with zero parity and\
    \ the\n       parity bit in the most significant position, reducing the value\n\
    \       by 32, giving a number in the range 0-95, encoding this result as\n  \
    \     a pair of decimal digits; and applying the technique described in\n    \
    \   (b); and\n   f)  when the IDI format is \"Local\", representing a National\
    \ Character\n       syntax DSP by converting each national character to either\
    \ one or\n       two octets according to the rules specified by the authority\n\
    \       responsible for allocating NSAP addresses including national\n       character\
    \ DSP syntaxes.\n 8.3.2  Decimal Concrete Syntax\n  The decimal concrete syntax\
    \ is generated by:\n   a)  representing the two digits of the AFI directly as\
    \ two decimal\n       digits;\n   b)  padding the IDI with leading zero digits\
    \ if necessary to obtain\n       the maximum IDI length (specified for each IDI\
    \ format in Clause\n       8.2.1.2), representing the result directly as decimal\
    \ digits;\n   c)  representing a decimal syntax DSP directly as decimal digits;\n\
    \   d)  representing a binary syntax DSP as follows:\n    Taking the octets in\
    \ pairs, convert each octet of the pair to a\n    number in the range 0-255; this\
    \ generates six decimal digits,\n    abcdef, of which digits a and d may take\
    \ on only the values o, 1, or\n    2. The pair of octets is represented by the\
    \ sequence of five digits\n    gbcef, where the value of digit g is given in Table\
    \ 8-4:\n                        Table 8-4:  Values of g.\n                   \

- title: C.1  IDI FORMATS (Clause 8.2.1.2)
  contents:
  - "C.1  IDI FORMATS (Clause 8.2.1.2)\n The rationale for the use of the specific\
    \ IDI formats identified in\n Clause 8.2.1.2 is to allow the allocation and assignment\
    \ of NSAP\n addresses to be based on existing, well-established network numbering\n\
    \ plans and organization-identification standards.\n The CCITT numbering plans\
    \ are included so as to allow for the\n designation of the organization to which\
    \ a number is assigned as an\n authority for the assignment of NSAP addresses.\
    \ If the organization\n identified by a particular number from one of these plans\
    \ chooses not\n to define any further sub-addressing beyond that number, then\
    \ the\n number itself constitutes an NSAP address when it is used in the OSI\n\
    \ environment. This flexibility allows number allocated from the four\n CCITT\
    \ numbering plans identified in Clause 8.2.1.2 to be used directly\n as NSAP addresses,\
    \ with the addition of nothing more than the initial\n AFI digits that identify\
    \ the plan.\n The ISO DCC format is included so as to allow for the designation,\n\
    \ where permitted by national regulations, of the organization that\n represents\
    \ a country in ISO (or an appropriately sponsored\n organization) as an authority\
    \ for the assignment of\n geographically-based NSAP addresses. The way in which\
    \ addresses are\n allocated and assigned in the ISO DCC format is determined by\
    \ the\n designated organization, which might, for example, be the national\n standards\
    \ body that represents a country in ISO.\n The ISO 6523-ICD format is included\
    \ so as to allow for the designation,\n where permitted by national regulations,\
    \ of an organization that may or\n may not be tied to a particular country as\
    \ an authority for the\n assignment of NSAP addresses according to the hierarchy\
    \ appropriate for\n that organization (which may not be based on geographical\
    \ or national\n boundaries).  The way which addresses are allocated and assigned\
    \ in the\n ISO 6523-ICD format is determined by the designated organization, which\n\
    \ might, for example, be the United Nations World Health Organization.\n The Local\
    \ format is included so as to allow for proprietary or other\n non-standard network\
    \ addressing schemes to coexist with the standard\n OSI network addressing scheme.\
    \  Use of the Local format for  these\n non-standard address ensures that they\
    \ cannot be confused with standard\n OSI network addresses. This capability will\
    \ be useful in the evolution\n of existing networks to OSI, and for the accommodation\
    \ of non-OSI\n addressing schemes that may be used in proprietary network\n architectures\
    \ or for testing and other interim purposes. It should be\n emphasized that\n\
    \ the Local format is not intended to give non-OSI schemes a permanent\n place\
    \ in OSI, but rather to permit the OSI network addressing sheme to\n be used wherever\
    \ possible without risk of conflict with other schemes\n (which can be encapsulated\
    \ safely under the Local format).\n"

  - "C.2  RESERVATION OF AFI VALUES 00-09 (Table 8-2)\n The reservation of AFI values\
    \ beginning with the digit 0 is intended to\n allow for the use of an initial\
    \ 0 to handle special cases, such as:\n  a)  as an escape to some other addressing\
    \ scheme;\n  b)  as a technique for the optimization of NSAP address encoding\
    \ in\n      Network Layer protocols, when the different parts of the NSAP\n  \
    \    address semantics are encoded in different fields of the protocol\n     \
    \ header;\n  c)  as a way to indicate, in a protocol header, that a field that\n\
    \      ordinarily contains a full NSAP address in fact contains something\n  \
    \    less than a full address (for example, a shorthand form that omits\n    \
    \  specification of the higher-order domains, which might be used for\n      communication\
    \ within a particular subdomain environment).\n There may be other cases in which\
    \ the use of an initial 0 digit is\n found to be useful. This Addendum merely\
    \ reserves the AFI values 00-09,\n and does not specify how they might be used;\
    \ all such uses are outside\n the scope of this Addendum.\n"
- title: C.3  DERIVATION OF THE CONCRETE SYNTAXES (Clause 8.3)
  contents:
  - "C.3  DERIVATION OF THE CONCRETE SYNTAXES (Clause 8.3)\n In describing the two\
    \ \"preferred\" concrete syntaxes of the NSAP\n address, Clauses 8.3.1 and 8.3.2\
    \ introduce two types of padding:\n padding with zero digits at the beginning\
    \ of an IDI, and padding with a\n semi-octet with the value 1111 at the end of\
    \ the binary encoding of an\n IDI with an odd number of decimal digits.\n The\
    \ first type of padding is necessary because some of the IDI formats\n allow the\
    \ IDI to consist of a variable number of digits. Since there is\n no explicit\
    \ syntactic marker between the IDI and the DSP, the only way\n to find the end\
    \ of the IDI is to know how long it is. The AFI, which\n identifies which IDI\
    \ format is used, allows only the maximum length of\n that IDI to be determined.\
    \  Rather than introduce either a specific\n syntactic marker or a new field containing\
    \ the length of the IDI\n (either of which would have greatly complicated the\
    \ encoding and\n parsing of NSAP addresses), the Addendum specifies that for encoding\n\
    \ purposes the IDI must first be padded out to its maximum length. Note\n that\
    \ this does not apply to the DSP; only to the IDI.\n The second type of padding\
    \ is necessary to ensure that a binary\n encoding of the IDI consists of an integral\
    \ number of binary octets.\n"
