    \   protocol that will allow each Administrative Domain (AD) in the\n   growing\
    \ Internet (and internets in general) to independently express\n   and enforce\
    \ policies regarding the flow of packets to, from, and\n   through its resources.\
    \ (FOOTNOTE 1: The material presented here\n   incorporates discussions held with\

    \ Working Group.)  This\n   document articulates the requirements for policy based\
    \ routing and\n   should be used as input to the functional specification and\n\
    \   evaluation of proposed protocols.\n   Two critical assumptions will shape\
    \ the type of routing mechanism\n   that is devised: (1) the topological organization\
    \ of ADs, and (2) the\n   type and variability of policies expressed by ADs. \
    \ After justifying\n   our assumptions regarding AD topology we present a taxonomy,\
    \ and\n   specific examples, of policies that must be supported by a PR\n   protocol.\
    \  We conclude with a brief discussion of policy routing\n   mechanisms proposed\
    \ in previous RFCs (827, 1102, 1104, 1105).  Future\n   RFCs will elaborate on\
    \ the architecture and protocols needed to\n   support the requirements presented\

- title: 3  BACKGROUND
  contents:
  - "3  BACKGROUND\n   The Research Internet has evolved from a single backbone wide\
    \ area\n   network with many connected campus networks, to an internet with\n\
    \   multiple cross-country backbones, regional access networks, and a\n   profusion\
    \ of campus networks. (FOOTNOTE 2: The term Research Internet\n   refers to a\
    \ collection of government, university, and some private\n   company, networks\
    \ that are used by researchers to access shared\n   computing resources (e.g.,\
    \ supercomputers), and for research related\n   information exchange (e.g., distribution\
    \ of software, technical\n   documents, and email). The networks that make up\
    \ the Research\n   Internet run the DOD Internet Protocol [1].)  At times during\
    \ its\n   development the Research Internet topology appeared somewhat chaotic.\n\
    \   Overlapping facilities and lateral (as opposed to hierarchical)\n   connections\
    \ seemed to be the rule rather than the exception.  Today\n   the Research Internet\
    \ topology is becoming more regular through\n   coordination of agency investment\
    \ and adoption of a hierarchy similar\n   to that of the telephone networks'.\
    \  The result is several\n   overlapping wide area backbones connected to regional\
    \ networks, which\n   in turn connect to campus networks at universities, research\n\
    \   laboratories, and private companies. However, the telephone network\n   has\
    \ lateral connections only at the highest level, i.e., between long\n   haul carriers.\
    \  In the Research Internet there exist lateral\n   connections at each level\
    \ of the hierarchy, i.e., between campus (and\n   regional) networks as well.\n\
    \   Additional complexity is introduced in the Research Internet by\n   virtue\
    \ of connections to private networks. Many private companies are\n   connected\
    \ to the Research Internet for purposes of research or\n   support activities.\
    \ These private companies connect in the same\n   manner as campuses, via a regional\
    \ network or via lateral links to\n   other campuses. However, many companies\
    \ have their own private wide\n   area networks which physically overlap with\
    \ backbone and/or regional\n   networks in the research internet, i.e., private\
    \ vertical bypass\n   links.\n   Implicit in this complex topology are organizational\
    \ boundaries.\n   These boundaries define Administrative Domains (ADs) which preclude\n\
    \   the imposition of a single, centralized set of policies on all\n   resources.\
    \  The subject of this paper is the policy requirements for\n   resource usage\
    \ control in the Research Internet.\n   In the remainder of this section we describe\
    \ the policy routing\n   problem in very general terms. Section 4 examines the\
    \ constraints and\n   requirements that makes the problem challenging, and leads\
    \ us to\n   conclude that a new generation of routing and resource control\n \
    \  protocols are needed. Section 5 provides more detail on our\n   assumptions\
    \ as to the future topology and configuration of\n   interconnected ADs. We return\
    \ to the subject of policy requirements\n   in Section 7 and categorize the different\
    \ types of policies that ADs\n   in the research internet may want to enforce.\
    \  Included in this\n   section are examples of FRICC policy statements.  (FOOTNOTE\
    \ 3: The\n   Federal Research Internet Coordinating Committee (FRICC) is made\
    \ up\n   of representatives of each of the major agencies that are involved in\n\
    \   networking. They have been very effective in coordinating their\n   efforts\
    \ to eliminate inefficient redundancy and have proposed a plan\n   for the next\
    \ 10 years of internetworking for the government,\n   scientific, and education\
    \ community [2].)  Section 7 identifies types\n   of policy statements that are\
    \ problematic to enforce due to their\n   dynamics, granularity, or performance\
    \ implications. Several proposed\n   mechanisms for supporting PR (including RFCs\
    \ 827, 1102, 1104, 1105)\n   are discussed briefly in Section 8. Future RFCs will\
    \ elaborate on the\n   architecture and protocols needed to support the requirements\n\
    \   presented here.\n"
- title: 3.1  POLICY ROUTING
  contents:
  - "3.1  POLICY ROUTING\n   Previous protocols such as the Exterior Gateway Protocol\
    \ (EGP)[3]\n   embodied a limited notion of policy and ADs. In particular,\n \
    \  autonomous system boundaries constrained the flow of routing database\n   information,\
    \ and only indirectly affected the flow of packets\n   themselves.  We consider\
    \ an Administrative Domain (AD) to be a set of\n   hosts and network resources\
    \ (gateways, links, etc.) that is governed\n   by common policies.  In large internets\
    \ that cross organization\n   boundaries, e.g., the Research Internet, inter-AD\
    \ routes must be\n   selected according to policy-related parameters such as cost\
    \ and\n   access rights, in addition to the traditional parameters of\n   connectivity\
    \ and congestion. In other words, Policy Routing (PR) is\n   needed to navigate\
    \ through the complex web of policy boundaries\n   created by numerous interconnected\
    \ ADs. Moreover, each AD has its own\n   privileges and perspective and therefore\
    \ must make its own evaluation\n   of legal and preferred routes.  Efforts are\
    \ now underway to develop a\n   new generation of routing protocol that will allow\
    \ each AD to\n   independently express and enforce policies regarding the flow\
    \ of\n   packets to, from, and through its resources [4].  (FOOTNOTE 4:  These\n\
    \   issues are under investigation by the IAB Autonomous Networks\n   Research\
    \ Group and the IAB Open Routing Working Group. For further\n   information contact\
    \ the author.)\n   The purpose of this paper is to articulate the requirements\
    \ for such\n   policy based routing. Two critical assumptions will shape the type\
    \ of\n   routing mechanism that is devised:\n   * The topological organization\
    \ of ADs, and\n   * The type and variability of policies expressed by ADs.\n \
    \  We make use of the policies expressed by owners of current Research\n   Internet\
    \ resources and private networks connected to the Research\n   Internet to generalize\
    \ types of policies that must be supported. This\n   top down effort must be done\
    \ with attention to the technical\n   implications of the policy statements if\
    \ the result is to be useful\n   in guiding technical development. For example,\
    \ some ADs express the\n   desire to enforce local constraints over how packets\
    \ travel to their\n   destination. Other ADs are only concerned with preventing\
    \ use of\n   their own network resources by restricting transit.  Still other\
    \ ADs\n   are concerned primarily with recovering the expense of carrying\n  \
    \ traffic and providing feedback to users so that users will limit\n   their own\
    \ data flows; in other words they are concerned with\n   charging.  We refer to\
    \ ADs whose primary concern is communication to\n   and from hosts within their\
    \ AD as stub and to ADs whose primary\n   concern is carrying packets to and from\
    \ other ADs as transit}.  If we\n   address control of transit alone, for example,\
    \ the resulting\n   mechanisms will not necessarily allow an AD to control the\
    \ flow of\n   its packets from source to destination, or to implement flexible\n\
    \   charging schemes.  (FOOTNOTE 5: Gene Tsudik uses the analogy of\n   international\
    \ travel to express the need for source and transit\n   controls. Each country\
    \ expresses its own policies about travel to and\n   through its land.  Travel\
    \ through one country enroute to another is\n   analogous to transit traffic in\
    \ the network world. A traveler\n   collects policy information from each of the\
    \ countries of interest\n   and plans an itinerary that conforms to those policies\
    \ as well as the\n   preferences of the traveler and his/her home nation.  Thus\
    \ there is\n   both source and transit region control of routing.)  Our purpose\
    \ is\n   to articulate a comprehensive set of requirements for PR as input to\n\
    \   the functional specification, and evaluation, of proposed protocols.\n"
- title: 4  WHY THE PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT
  contents:
  - "4  WHY THE PROBLEM IS DIFFICULT\n   Before proceeding with our description of\
    \ topology and policy\n   requirements this section outlines several assumptions\
    \ and\n   constraints, namely: the lack of global authority, the need to\n   support\
    \ network resource sharing as well as network interconnection,\n   the complex\
    \ and dynamic mapping of users to ADs and privileges, and\n   the need for accountability\
    \ across ADs.  These assumptions limit the\n   solution space and raise challenging\
    \ technical issues.\n   The purpose of policy based routing is to allow ADs to\
    \ interconnect\n   and share computer and network resources in a controlled manner.\n\
    \   Unlike many other problems of resource control, there is no global\n   authority.\
    \ Each AD defines its own policies with respect to its own\n   traffic and resources.\
    \ However, while we assume no global authority,\n   and no global policies, we\
    \ recognize that complete autonomy implies\n   no dependence and therefore no\
    \ communication.  The multi-organization\n   internets addressed here have inherent\
    \ regions of autonomy, as well\n   as requirements for interdependence. Our mechanisms\
    \ should allow ADs\n   to design their boundaries, instead of requiring that the\
    \ boundaries\n   be either impenetrable or eliminated.\n   One of the most problematic\
    \ aspects of the policy routing\n   requirements identified here is the need to\
    \ support both network\n   resource sharing and interconnection across ADs. An\
    \ example of\n   resource sharing is two ADs (e.g., agencies, divisions, companies)\n\
    \   sharing network resources (e.g., links, or gateways and links) to\n   take\
    \ advantage of economies of scale.  Providing transit services to\n   external\
    \ ADs is another example of network resource sharing.\n   Interconnection is the\
    \ more common example of ADs interconnecting\n   their independently used network\
    \ resources to achieve connectivity\n   across the ADs, i.e., to allow a user\
    \ in one AD to communicate with\n   users in another AD. In some respects, network\
    \ resource control is\n   simpler than network interconnection control since the\
    \ potential\n   dangers are fewer (i.e., denial of service and loss of revenue\
    \ as\n   compared with a wide range of attacks on end systems through network\n\
    \   interconnection). However, controlled network resource sharing is\n   more\
    \ difficult to support.  In an internet a packet may travel\n   through a number\
    \ of transit ADs on its way to the destination.\n   Consequently, policies from\
    \ all transit ADs must be considered when a\n   packet is being sent, whereas\
    \ for stub-AD control only the policies\n   of the two end point ADs have to be\
    \ considered. In other words,\n   controlled network resource sharing and transit\
    \ require that policy\n   enforcement be integrated into the routing protocols\
    \ themselves and\n   can not be left to network control mechanisms at the end\
    \ points.\n   (FOOTNOTE 6&7: Another difference is that in the interconnect case,\n\
    \   traffic traveling over AD A's network resources always has a member\n   of\
    \ AD A as its source or destination (or both).  Under resource\n   sharing arrangements\
    \ members of both AD A and B are connected to the\n   same resources and consequently\
    \ intra-AD traffic (i.e., packets\n   sourced and destined for members of the\
    \ same AD) travels over the\n   resources. This distinction is relevant to the\
    \ writing of policies in\n   terms of principal affiliation.  Economies of scale\
    \ is one motivation\n   for resource sharing. For example, instead of interconnecting\n\
    \   separately to several independent agency networks, a campus network\n   may\
    \ interconnect to a shared backbone facility.  Today,\n   interconnection is achieved\
    \ through a combination of AD specific and\n   shared arrangements. We expect\
    \ this mixed situation to persist for\n   \"well-connected\" campuses for reasons\
    \ of politics, economics, and\n   functionality (e.g., different characteristics\
    \ of the different\n   agency-networks). See Section 5 for more discussion.)\n\
    \   Complications also result from the fact that legitimate users of an\n   AD's\
    \ resources are not all located in that AD. Many users (and their\n   computers)\
    \ who are funded by, or are affiliated with, a particular\n   agency's program\
    \ reside within the AD of the user's university or\n   research laboratory.  They\
    \ reside in a campus AD along with users who\n   are legitimate users of other\
    \ AD resources.  Moreover, any one person\n   may be a legitimate user of multiple\
    \ AR resources under varying\n   conditions and constraints (see examples in Section\
    \ 6). In addition,\n   users can move from one AD to another. In other words,\
    \ a user's\n   rights can not be determined solely based on the AD from which\
    \ the\n   user's communications originate.  Consequently, PR must not only\n \
    \  identify resources, it must identify principals and associate\n   different\
    \ capabilities and rights with different principals.  (The\n   term principal\
    \ is taken from the computer security community[7].)\n   One way of reducing the\
    \ compromise of autonomy associated with\n   interconnection is to implement mechanisms\
    \ that assure\n   accountability} for resources used. Accountability may be enforced\
    \ a\n   priori, e.g., access control mechanisms applied before resource usage\n\
    \   is permitted.  Alternatively, accountability may be enforced after\n   the\
    \ fact, e.g., record keeping or metering that supports detection\n   and provides\
    \ evidence to third parties (i.e., non-repudiation).\n   Accountability mechanisms\
    \ can also be used to provide feedback to\n   users as to consumption of resources.\
    \ Internally an AD often decides\n   to do away with such feedback under the premise\
    \ that communication is\n   a global good and should not be inhibited. There is\
    \ not necessarily a\n   \"global good\" across AD boundaries. Therefore, it becomes\
    \ more\n   appropriate to have resource usage visible to users, whether or not\n\
    \   actual charging for usage takes place.  Another motivation that\n   drives\
    \ the need for accountability across AD boundaries is the\n   greater variability\
    \ in implementations. Different implementations of\n   a single network protocol\
    \ can vary greatly as to their efficiency\n   [8].  We can not assume control\
    \ over implementation across AD\n   boundaries.  Feedback mechanisms such as metering\
    \ (and charging in\n   some cases) would introduce a concrete incentive for ADs\
    \ to employ\n   efficient and correct implementations.  PR should allow an AD\
    \ to\n   advertise and apply such accounting measures to inter-AD traffic.\n \
    \  In summary, the lack of global authority, the need to support network\n   resource\
    \ sharing as well as network interconnection, the complex and\n   dynamic mapping\
    \ of users to ADs and rights, and the need for\n   accountability across ADs,\
    \ are characteristics of inter-AD\n   communications which must be taken into\
    \ account in the design of both\n   policies and supporting technical mechanisms.\n"
- title: 5  TOPOLOGY MODEL OF INTERNET
  contents:
  - "5  TOPOLOGY MODEL OF INTERNET\n   Before discussing policies per se, we outline\
    \ our model of inter-AD\n   topology and how it influences the type of policy\
    \ support required.\n   Most members of the Internet community agree that the\
    \ future Internet\n   will connect on the order of 150,000,000 termination points\
    \ and\n   100,000 ADs. However, there are conflicting opinions as to the AD\n\
    \   topology for which we must design PR mechanisms.  The informal\n   argument\
    \ is described here.\n   SIMPLE AD TOPOLOGY AND POLICY MODEL Some members of the\
    \ Internet\n   community believe that the current complex topology of interconnected\n\
    \   ADs is a transient artifact resulting from the evolutionary nature of\n  \
    \ the Research Internet's history.  (FOOTNOTE 9: David Cheriton of\n   Stanford\
    \ University articulated this side of the argument at an\n   Internet workshop\
    \ in Santa Clara, January, 1989). The critical points\n   of this argument relate\
    \ to topology and policy. They contend that in\n   the long term the following\
    \ three conditions will prevail:\n   * The public carriers will provide pervasive,\
    \ competitively\n     priced, high speed data services.\n   * The resulting topology\
    \ of ADs will  be\n     stub (not transit) ADs connected to regional\n     backbones,\
    \ which in turn interconnect via multiple,\n     overlapping long haul backbones,\
    \ i.e., a  hierarchy with\n     no lateral connections between stub-ADs or regionals,\n\
    \     and no vertical bypass links.\n   * The policy requirements of the backbone\
    \ and stub-ADs\n     will be based only on charging for resource usage at the\n\
    \     stub-AD to backbone-AD boundary, and to settling accounts\n     between\
    \ neighboring backbone providers (regional to long haul,\n     and long haul to\
    \ long haul).\n   Under these assumptions, the primary requirement for general\
    \ AD\n   interconnect is a metering and charging protocol. The routing\n   decision\
    \ can be modeled as a simple least cost path with the metric\n   in dollars and\
    \ cents. In other words, restrictions on access to\n   transit services will be\
    \ minimal and the functionality provided by\n   the routing protocol need not\
    \ be changed significantly from current\n   day approaches.\n   COMPLEX AD TOPOLOGY\
    \ AND POLICY MODEL The counter argument is that a\n   more complex AD topology\
    \ will persist. (FOOTNOTE 10:  Much of the\n   remainder of this paper attempts\
    \ to justify and provide evidence for\n   this statement.) The different assumptions\
    \ about AD topology lead to\n   the significantly different assumptions about\
    \ AD policies.\n   This model assumes that the topology of ADs will in many respects\n\
    \   agree with the previous model of increased commercial carrier\n   participation\
    \ and resulting hierarchical structure. However, we\n   anticipate unavoidable\
    \ and persistent exceptions to the hierarchy.\n   We assume that there will be\
    \ a relatively small number of long haul\n   transit ADs (on the order of 100),\
    \ but that there may be tens of\n   thousands of regional ADs and hundreds of\
    \ thousands of stub ADs\n   (e.g., campuses, laboratories, and private companies).\
    \  The competing\n   long haul offerings will differ, both in the services provided\
    \ and in\n   their packaging and pricing.  Regional networks will overlap less\
    \ and\n   will connect campus and private company networks. However, many\n  \
    \ stub-ADs will retain some private lateral links for political,\n   technical,\
    \ and reliability reasons.  For example, political\n   incentives cause organizations\
    \ to invest in bypass links that are not\n   always justifiable on a strict cost\
    \ comparison basis; specialized\n   technical requirements cause organizations\
    \ to invest in links that\n   have characteristics (e.g., data rate, delay, error,\
    \ security) not\n   available from public carriers at a competitive rate; and\
    \ critical\n   requirements cause organizations to invest in redundant back up\
    \ links\n   for reliability reasons.  These exceptions to the otherwise regular\n\
    \   topology are not dispensible. They will persist and must be\n   accommodated,\
    \ perhaps at the expense of optimality; see Section 5 for\n   more detail.  In\
    \ addition, many private companies will retain their\n   own private long haul\
    \ network facilities. (FOOTNOTE 11:  While\n   private voice networks also exist,\
    \ private data networks are more\n   common.  Voice requirements are more standardized\
    \ because voice\n   applications are more uniform than are data applications,\
    \ and\n   therefore the commercial services more often have what the voice\n \
    \  customer wants at a price that is competitive with the private\n   network\
    \ option. Data communication requirements are still more\n   specialized and dynamic.\
    \  Thus, there is less opportunity for economy\n   of scale in service offerings\
    \ and it is harder to keep up to date\n   with customer demand. For this reason\
    \ we expect private data networks\n   to persist for the near future. As the telephone\
    \ companies begin to\n   introduce the next generation of high speed packet switched\
    \ services,\n   the scenario should change. However, we maintain that the result\
    \ will\n   be a predominance, but not complete dominance, of public carrier use\n\
    \   for long haul communication.  Therefore, private data networks will\n   persist\
    \ and the routing architecture must accommodate controlled\n   interconnection.)\
    \  Critical differences between the two models follow\n   from the difference\
    \ in assumptions regarding AD topology. In the\n   complex case, lateral connections\
    \ must be supported, along with the\n   means to control the use of such connections\
    \ in the routing\n   protocols.\n   The different topologies imply different policy\
    \ requirements.  The\n   first model assumes that all policies can be expressed\
    \ and enforced\n   in terms of dollars and cents and distributed charging schemes.\
    \ The\n   second model assumes that ADs want more varied control over their\n\
    \   resources, control that can not be captured in a dollars and cents\n   metric\
    \ alone. We describe the types of policies to be supported and\n   provide examples\
    \ in the following section, Section 6. In brief, given\n   private lateral links,\
    \ ADs must be able to express access and\n   charging related restrictions and\
    \ privileges that discriminate on an\n   AD basis.  These policies will be diverse,\
    \ dynamic, and new\n   requirements will emerge over time, consequently support\
    \ must be\n   extensible.  For example, the packaging and charging schemes of\
    \ any\n   single long haul service will vary over time and may be relatively\n\
    \   elaborate (e.g., many tiers of service, special package deals, to\n   achieve\
    \ price discrimination).\n   Note that these assumptions about complexity do not\
    \ preclude some\n   collection of ADs from \"negotiating away\" their policy differences,\n\
    \   i.e., forming a federation, and coordinating a simplified inter-AD\n   configuration\
    \ in order to reduce the requirements for inter-AD\n   mechanisms.  However, we\
    \ maintain that there will persist collections\n   of ADs that will not and can\
    \ not behave as a single federation; both\n   in the research community and, even\
    \ more predominantly, in the\n   broader commercial arena.  Moreover, when it\
    \ comes to interconnecting\n   across these federations, non-negotiable differences\
    \ will arise\n   eventually.  It is our goal to develop mechanisms that are applicable\n\
    \   in the broader arena.\n   The Internet community developed its original protocol\
    \ suite with\n   only minimal provision for resource control [9].  This was\n\
    \   appropriate at the time of development based on the assumed community\n  \
    \ (i.e., researchers) and the ground breaking nature of the technology.\n   The\
    \ next generation of network technology is now being designed to\n   take advantage\
    \ of high speed media and to support high demand traffic\n   generated by more\
    \ powerful computers and their applications [10].  As\n   with TCP/IP we hope\
    \ that the technology being developed will find\n   itself applied outside of\
    \ the research community. This time it would\n   be inexcusable to ignore resource\
    \ control requirements and not to pay\n   careful attention to their specification.\n\
    \   Finally, we look forward to the Internet structure taking advantage\n   of\
    \ economies of scale offered by enhanced commercial services.\n   However, in\
    \ many respects the problem that stub-ADs may thus avoid,\n   will be faced by\
    \ the multiple regional and long haul carriers\n   providing the services. The\
    \ carriers' charging and resource control\n   policies will be complex enough\
    \ to require routing mechanisms similar\n   to ones being proposed for the complex\

  - "6  POLICY TYPES\n   This section outlines a taxonomy of internet policies for\
    \ inter-AD\n   topologies that allow lateral and bypass links.  The taxonomy is\n\
    \   intended to cover a wide range of ADs and internets. Any particular\n   PR\
    \ architecture we design should support a significant subset of\n   these policy\
    \ types but may not support all of them due to technical\n   complexity and performance\
    \ considerations.  The general taxonomy is\n   important input to a functional\
    \ specification for PR. Moreover, it\n   can be used to evaluate and compare the\
    \ suitability and completeness\n   of existing routing architectures and protocols\
    \ for PR; see Section\n   8.\n   We provide examples from the Research Internet\
    \ of the different\n   policy types in the form of resource usage policy statements.\
    \ These\n   statements were collected through interviews with agency\n   representatives,\
    \ but they do not represent official policy. These\n   sample policy statements\
    \ should not} be interpreted as agency policy,\n   they are provided here only\
    \ as examples.\n   Internet policies fall into two classes, access and charging.\
    \  Access\n   policies specify who can use resources and under what conditions.\n\
    \   Charging policies specify the metering, accounting, and billing\n   implemented\
    \ by a particular AD.\n"
- title: 6.1  TAXONOMY OF ACCESS POLICIES
  contents:
  - "6.1  TAXONOMY OF ACCESS POLICIES\n   We have identified the following types of\
    \ access policies that ADs\n   may wish to enforce. Charging policies are described\
    \ in the\n   subsequent section. Section 6.3 provides more specific examples of\n\
    \   both access and charging policies using FRICC policy statements.\n   Access\
    \ policies typically are expressed in the form: principals of\n   type x can have\
    \ access to resources of type y under the following\n   conditions, z. The policies\
    \ are categorized below according to the\n   definition of y and z.  In any particular\
    \ instance, each of the\n   policy types would be further qualified by definition\
    \ of legitimate\n   principals, , x, i.e., what characteristics x must have in\
    \ order to\n   access the resource in question.\n   We refer to access policies\
    \ described by stub and transit ADs.  The\n   two roles imply different motivations\
    \ for resource control, however\n   the types of policies expressed are similar;\
    \ we expect the supporting\n   mechanisms to be common as well.\n   Stub and transit\
    \ access policies may specify any of the following\n   parameters:\n   * SOURCE/DESTINATION\n\
    \   Source/Destination policies prevent or restrict communication\n   originated\
    \ by or destined for particular ADs (or hosts or user\n   classes within an AD).\n\
    \   * PATH\n   Path sensitive policies specify which ADs may or may not be passed\n\
    \   through en route to a destination. The most general path sensitive\n   policies\
    \ allow stub and transit ADs to express policies that depend\n   on any component\
    \ in the AD path. In other words, a stub AD could\n   reject a route based on\
    \ any AD (or combination of ADs) in the route.\n   Similarly, a transit AD could\
    \ express a packet forwarding policy that\n   behaves differently depending upon\
    \ which ADs a packet has passed\n   through, and is going to pass through, en\
    \ route to the destination.\n   Less ambitious (and perhaps more reasonable) path\
    \ sensitive policies\n   might only discriminate according to the immediate neighbor\
    \ ADs\n   through which the packet is traveling (i.e., a stub network could\n\
    \   reject a route based on the first transit AD in the route, and a\n   transit\
    \ AD could express a packet forwarding policy that depends upon\n   the previous,\
    \ and the subsequent, transit ADs in the route.)\n   * QUALITY/TYPE OF SERVICE(QOS\
    \ OR TOS)\n   This type of policy restricts access to special resources or\n \
    \  services.  For example, a special high throughput, low delay link may\n   be\
    \ made available on a selective basis.\n   * RESOURCE GUARANTEE\n   These policies\
    \ provide a guaranteed percentage of a resource on a\n   selective, as needed\
    \ basis.  In other words, the resource can be used\n   by others if the preferred-AD's\
    \ offered load is below the guaranteed\n   level of service.  The guarantee may\
    \ be to always carry intra-AD\n   traffic or to always carry inter-AD traffic\
    \ for a specific AD.\n   *  TEMPORAL\n   Temporal policies restrict usage based\
    \ on the time of day or other\n   time related parameters.\n   *  HIGH LEVEL PROTOCOL\n\
    \   Usage may be restricted to a specific high level protocol such as\n   mail\
    \ or file transfer. (Alternatively, such policies can be\n   implemented as source/destination\
    \ policies by configuring a host(s)\n   within an AD as an application relay and\
    \ composing policy terms that\n   allow inter-AD access to only that host.)\n\
    \   *  RESOURCE LIMIT\n   There may be a limit on the amount of traffic load a\
    \ source may\n   generate during a particular time interval, e.g., so many packets\
    \ in\n   a day, hour, or minute.\n   *  AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS\n   Conditions\
    \ may be specified regarding the authenticability of\n   principal identifying\
    \ information. Some ADs might require some form\n   of cryptographic proof as\
    \ to the identity and affiliations of the\n   principal before providing access\
    \ to critical resources.\n   The above policy types usually exist in combination\
    \ for a particular\n   AD, i.e., an AD's policies might express a combination\
    \ of transit,\n   source/destination, and QOS restrictions. This taxonomy will\
    \ evolve\n   as PR is applied to other domains.\n   As will be seen in Section\
    \ 6.3 an AD can express its charging and\n   access policies in a single syntax.\
    \ Moreover, both stub and transit\n   policies can co-exist. This is important\
    \ since some ADs operate as\n   both stub and transit facilities and require such\
    \ hybrid control.\n"
- title: 6.2 TAXONOMY OF CHARGING POLICIES
  contents:
  - "6.2 TAXONOMY OF CHARGING POLICIES\n   Stub and transit charging policies  may\
    \ specify the following\n   parameters:\n   *  UNIT OF ACCOUNTING (e.g., dollars\
    \ or credits).\n   *  BASIS FOR CHARGING (e.g., per Kbyte or per Kpkt).\n   *\
    \  ACTUAL CHARGES (e.g., actual numbers such as $.50/Mbyte).\n   *  WHO IS CHARGED\
    \ OR PAID (e.g., originator of packet,\n      immediate neighbor from whom packet\
    \ was received, destination\n      of packet, a third party collection agent).\n\
    \   *  WHOSE PACKET COUNT is used (e.g., source, destination, the\n      transit\
    \ AD's own count, the count of some upstream or\n      downstream AD).\n   * \
    \ BOUND ON CHARGES (e.g., to limit the  amount that a stub\n      AD is willing\
    \ to spend, or the amount that a transit AD is\n      willing to carry.)\n   The\
    \ enforcement of these policies may be carried out during route\n   synthesis\
    \ or route selection [4].\n"
- title: 6.3  EXAMPLE POLICY STATEMENTS
  contents:
  - "6.3  EXAMPLE POLICY STATEMENTS\n   The following policy statements were collected\
    \ in the fall of 1988\n   through interviews with representatives of the federal\
    \ agencies most\n   involved in supporting internetworking. Once again we emphasize\
    \ that\n   these are not official policy statements. They are presented here to\n\
    \   provide concrete examples of the sort of policies that agencies would\n  \
    \ like to enforce.\n   Expressing policies as Policy Terms (PTs)\n   Each policy\
    \ is described in English and then expressed in a policy\n   term (PT) notation\
    \ suggested by Dave Clark in [4].  Each PT\n   represents a distinct policy of\
    \ the AD that synthesized it.  The\n   format of a PT is:\n    [(H{src},AD{src},AD{ent}),(H{dst},AD{dst},AD{exit}),UCI,\
    \ Cg,Cb]\n   Hsrc stands for source host, ADsrc for source AD, ADent for entering\n\
    \   AD (i.e., neighboring AD from which traffic is arriving directly),\n   Hdst\
    \ for destination host, ADdst for destination AD, ADexit for exit\n   AD (i.e.,neighboring\
    \ AD to which traffic is going directly), UCI for\n   user class identifier, and\
    \ Cg and Cb for global and bilateral\n   conditions, respectively. The purpose\
    \ of a PT is to specify that\n   packets from some host, H{src}, (or a group of\
    \ hosts) in a source AD,\n   AD{src}, are allowed to enter the AD in question\
    \ via some directly\n   connected AD, AD{ent}, and exit through another directly\
    \ connected\n   AD, AD{exit}, on its way to a host, H{dst}, (or a group of hosts)\
    \ in\n   some destination AD, AD{dst}.  User Class Identifier (UCI) allows for\n\
    \   distinguishing between various user classes, e.g., Government,\n   Research,\
    \ Commercial, Contract, etc.  Global Conditions (Cg)\n   represent billing and\
    \ other variables.  Bilateral Conditions (Cb)\n   relate to agreements between\
    \ neighboring ADs, e.g., related to\n   metering or charging.  In the example\
    \ policy terms provided below we\n   make use of the following abbreviations:\
    \ Fricc for\n   {DOE,NASA,DCA,NSF}, F for Federal Agency, Re for Regional, U for\n\
    \   University, Co for Commercial Corporation, and Cc for Commercial\n   Carrier.\
    \ A hyphen, -, means no applicable matches.\n   By examining a PT we can identify\
    \ the type of policy represented, as\n   per the taxonomy presented earlier.\n\
    \   *  If an AD specifies a policy term that has a null (-) entry for\n      the\
    \ ADexit, then it is disallowing transit for some group of users,\n      and it\
    \ is a transit policy.\n   *  If an AD specifies a  policy term that lists itself\n\
    \      explicitly as ADsrc or ADdst, it is expressing restrictions on who\n  \
    \    can access particular resources within its boundaries, or on who inside\n\
    \      can obtain external access. In other words the AD is expressing a\n   \
    \   source/destination policy.\n   *  If ADexit or ADentr is specified then the\
    \ policy expressed is an\n      exit/entrance path policy.\n   *  If the global\
    \ conditions include charging, QOS, resource\n      guarantee,  time of day, higher\
    \ level application, resource limit, or\n      authentication related information\
    \ it is obviously a charging, QOS,\n      resource guarantee, temporal, higher\
    \ level application, resource\n      limit, or authentication policy, respectively.\n\
    \   As seen below, any one PT typically incorporates a combination of\n   policy\
    \ types.\n"

    \ beginning with articulation of desired policies.  Now we feel\n   compelled\
    \ to mention requirements that are clearly problematic from\n   the bottom up\
    \ perspective of technical feasibility.\n   *  Non-interference policies are of\
    \ the form \"I will provide\n      access for principals x to resources y so long\
    \ as it does not\n      interfere with my internal usage.\" The problem with such\
    \ policies\n      is that access to an AD at any point in time is contingent upon\
    \ a\n      local, highly dynamic, parameter that is not globally available.\n\
    \      Therefore such a policy term could well result in looping,\n      oscillations,\
    \ and excessive route (re)computation overhead,\n      both unacceptable. Consequently,\
    \ this is one type of policy that\n      routing experts suggest would be difficult\
    \ to support in a very\n      large decentralized internetwork.\n   *  Granularity\
    \ can also be problematic, but not as devistating as\n      highly dynamic PR\
    \ contingencies. Here the caution is less specific.\n      Very fine grain policies,\
    \ which restrict access to particular\n      hosts, or are contingent upon very\
    \ fine grain user class\n      identification, may be achieved more efficiently\
    \ with network\n      level access control [11] or end system controls instead\
    \ of\n      burdening the inter-AD routing mechanism.\n   *  Security  is expensive,\
    \ as always. Routing protocols are subject\n      to fraud through impersonation,\
    \ data substitution, and denial of\n      service. Some of the proposed mechanisms\
    \ provide some means for\n      detection and non-repudiation. However, to achieve\
    \ a priori\n      prevention of resource misuse is expensive in terms of per\n\
    \      connection or per packet cryptographic overhead. For some\n      environments\
    \ we firmly believe that this will be necessary and\n      we would prefer an\
    \ architecture that would accommodate such\n      variability [12].\n   In general,\
    \ it is difficult to predict the impact of any particular\n   policy term. Tools\
    \ will be needed to assist people in writing and\n   validating policy terms.\n"
- title: 8  PROPOSED MECHANISMS
  contents:
  - "8  PROPOSED MECHANISMS\n   Previous routing protocols have addressed a narrower\
    \ definition of\n   PR, as appropriate for the internets of their day. In particular,\
    \ EGP\n   [3], DGP[13], and BGP[6] incorporate a notion of policy restrictions\n\
    \   as to where routing database information travels. None are intended\n   to\
    \ support policy based routing of packets as described here.  More\n   recent\
    \ routing proposals such as Landmark [14] and Cartesian [15]\n   could be used\
    \ to restrict packet forwarding but are not suited to\n   source/destination,\
    \ and some of the condition-oriented, policies. We\n   feel these policy types\
    \ are critical to support. We note that for\n   environments (e.g., within an\
    \ AD substructure) in which the simple-\n   AD-topology conjecture holds true,\
    \ these alternatives may be\n   suitable.\n   RFC 1104 [5] provides a good description\
    \ of shorter term policy\n   routing requirements. Braun classifies three types\
    \ of mechanisms,\n   policy based distribution of route information, policy based\
    \ packet\n   forwarding, and policy based dynamic allocation of network resources.\n\
    \   The second class is characterized by Dave Clark's PR architecture,\n   RFC\
    \ 1102 [4]. With respect to the longer term requirements laid out\n   in this\
    \ document, only this second class is expressive and flexible\n   enough to support\
    \ the multiplicity of stub and transit policies. In\n   other words, the power\
    \ of the PR approach (e.g., RFC1102) is not just\n   in the added granularity\
    \ of control pointed out by Braun, i.e., the\n   ability to specify particular\
    \ hosts and user classes. Its power is in\n   the ability to express and enforce\
    \ many types of stub and transit\n   policies and apply them on a discriminatory\
    \ basis to different ADs.\n   In addition, this approach provides explicit support\
    \ for stub ADs to\n   control routes via the use of source routing.  (FOOTNOTE\
    \ 12:\n   Moreover, the source routing approach loosens the requirements for\n\
    \   every AD to share a complete view of the entire internet by allowing\n   the\
    \ source to detect routing loops.)  (FOOTNOTE 13:  The match\n   between RFC1102\

  - "9  SUMMARY\n   Along with the emergence of very high speed applications and media,\n\
    \   resource management has become a critical issue in the Research\n   Internet\
    \ and internets in general. A fundamental characteristic of\n   the resource management\
    \ problem is allowing administratively ADs to\n   interconnect while retaining\
    \ control over resource usage. However, we\n   have lacked a careful articulation\
    \ of the types of resource\n   management policies that need to be supported.\
    \  This paper addresses\n   policy requirements for the Research Internet.  After\
    \ justifying our\n   assumptions regarding AD topology we presented a taxonomy\
    \ and\n   examples of policies that must be supported by a PR protocol.\n"
