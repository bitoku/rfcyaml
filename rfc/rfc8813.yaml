  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5480] specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject
    Public\n   Key Information field in certificates that support Elliptic Curve\n
    \  Cryptography.  As part of these semantics, it defines what\n   combinations
    are permissible for the values of the key usage\n   extension [RFC5280].  [RFC5480]
    specifies 7 of the 9 values; it makes\n   no mention of the keyEncipherment and
    dataEncipherment key usage\n   bits.  This document corrects this omission by
    updating Section 3 of\n   [RFC5480] to make it clear that neither keyEncipherment
    nor the\n   dataEncipherment key usage bits are set for key agreement algorithms\n
    \  defined therein.  The additions are to be made to the end of\n   Section 3
    of [RFC5480].\n"

  - "3.  Updates to Section 3\n   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
    that indicates\n   id-ecPublicKey in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following
    values\n   MUST NOT be present:\n      keyEncipherment; and\n      dataEncipherment.\n
    \  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates\n   id-ecDH
    or id-ecMQV in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following\n   values also MUST NOT
    be present:\n      keyEncipherment; and\n      dataEncipherment.\n"
