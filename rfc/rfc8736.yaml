- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header\
    \ format\n   defined in the PIM Sparse Mode specification [RFC7761].  The common\n\
    \   header definition contains eight reserved bits.  While all message\n   types\
    \ use this common header, there is no document formally\n   specifying that these\
    \ bits are to be used per message type.\n   This document refers to the bits specified\
    \ as \"reserved\" in the\n   common PIM header [RFC7761] as \"PIM message type\
    \ Flag Bits\" or,\n   simply, \"Flag Bits\", and it specifies that they are to\
    \ be separately\n   used on a per-message-type basis.  It creates a registry containing\n\
    \   the per-message-type usage.\n   This document updates [RFC7761] and [RFC3973]\
    \ by defining the use of\n   the currently Reserved field in the PIM common header.\
    \  This document\n   further updates [RFC7761] and [RFC3973], along with [RFC5015],\n\
    \   [RFC5059], [RFC6754], and [RFC8364], by specifying the use of the\n   currently\
    \ reserved bits for each PIM message.\n   The currently defined PIM message types\
    \ are in the range from 0 to\n   15.  That type space is almost exhausted.  Message\
    \ type 15 was\n   reserved by [RFC6166] for type space extension.  In Section\
    \ 5, this\n   document specifies the use of the Flag Bits for message types 13,\
    \ 14,\n   and 15 in order to extend the PIM type space.  This document\n   obsoletes\
    \ [RFC6166].\n"

  - "3.  PIM Header Common Format\n   The common PIM header is defined in Section\
    \ 4.9 of [RFC7761].  This\n   document updates the definition of the Reserved\
    \ field and refers to\n   that field as \"PIM message type Flag Bits\" or, simply,\
    \ \"Flag Bits\".\n   The new common header format is as below.\n       0     \

- title: 4.  Flag Bit Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.  Flag Bit Definitions\n   Unless otherwise specified, all the flag bits for\
    \ each PIM type are\n   Reserved [RFC8126].  They MUST be set to zero on transmission,\
    \ and\n   they MUST be ignored upon receipt.  The specification of a new PIM\n\
    \   type MUST indicate whether the bits should be treated differently.\n   When\
    \ defining flag bits, it is helpful to have a well-defined way of\n   referring\
    \ to a particular bit.  The most significant of the flag\n   bits, the bit immediately\
    \ following the Type field, is referred to as\n   bit 7.  The least significant,\
    \ the bit right in front of the Checksum\n   field, is referred to as bit 0. \
