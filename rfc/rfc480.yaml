  - "                     Host-Dependent FTP Parameters\nThis memo is in response\
    \ to (and support of) one of the points raised by\nBob Braden (RTB) of UCLA-CCN\
    \ in RFC #430, \"COMMENTS ON FILE TRANSFER\nPROTOCOL\" (see -- 13299,), namely\
    \ that raised in Section D., \"Site-\nDependent FTP Parameters\".\nThe NIC has\
    \ been confronted with similar problems (and tentatively\ndecided upon similar\
    \ solutions) in designing mechanisms which would\nenable a user to use FTP to\
    \ retrieve from the NIC, in sequential form, a\nVIEW of some portion for an NLS\
    \ tree-structured file.\nTo be done without modification to FTP, this task requires\
    \ the user to\ncommunicate information -- a filename, a statement address, viewspecs,\n\
    and the name of a conversion algorithm -- to SRI-ARC's server FTP\nprocess in\
    \ a manner that is transparent to the user's user FTP process.\nWe currently intend\
    \ to require the user to embed this information in the\npathname of FTP's STOR\
    \ and RETR commands by appending to a standard\nTENEX filename, a field of the\
    \ form:\n    ;x <program> [ / <parameters> ]\nwhere <program> identifies an arbitrary\
    \ program to be dispatched by\nSRI-ARC's server FTP process, with a pointer to\
    \ the file being stored or\nretrieved as an argument.  <parameters> is optional\
    \ and, if present, is\nalso passed to the program.\nTo store and retrieve NLS\
    \ files in sequential form, we will require that\n<program> be 'NLS' and <parameters>\
    \ be of the form.\n    [ T: <conversion-algorithm> ] [ S: <statement address>\
    \ ] [ V:\n    <viewspecs> ]\nwhere each of the three items is optional, and any\
    \ that appear are\nseparated by commas.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie\
    \ with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n"
