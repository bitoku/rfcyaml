    \ XML-\n   based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or\n\

    \ the end host, e.g., in the access network, is\n   desirable.  In disaster situations\
    \ with intermittent network\n   connectivity, such a LoST server placement provides\
    \ benefits\n   regarding the resiliency of emergency service communication.\n\
    \   This document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST server\n   using\
    \ the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol [RFC5222]\n\
    \   describes an XML-based protocol for mapping service identifiers and\n   geospatial\
    \ or civic location information to service contact Uniform\n   Resource Locators\
    \ (URLs).\n   In order to interact with a LoST server, the LoST client needs to\n\
    \   discover the server's IP address.  Several mechanisms can be used to\n   learn\
    \ this address, including manual configuration.  In environments\n   where the\
    \ access network itself either deploys a LoST server or knows\n   a third party\
    \ that operates a LoST server, DHCP can provide the end\n   host with a domain\
    \ name.  This domain name is then used as input to\n   the DNS-based resolution\
    \ mechanism described in LoST [RFC5222] that\n   reuses the URI-enabled NAPTR\
    \ specification (see [RFC4848]).\n   This document specifies a DHCPv4 and a DHCPv6\
    \ option that allows LoST\n   clients to discover local LoST servers.\n   Section\
    \ 2 provides terminology.  Section 3 shows the encoding of the\n   domain name.\
    \  Section 4 describes the DHCPv4 option while Section 5\n   describes the DHCPv6\
    \ option, with the same functionality.  IANA and\n   Security Considerations complete\
    \ the document in Sections 7 and 8.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\n\
    \   [RFC2119].\n   Within this document, we use terminology from [RFC5012] and\n\
    \   [RFC5222].\n"
- title: 3.  Domain Name Encoding
  contents:
  - "3.  Domain Name Encoding\n   This section describes the encoding of the domain\
    \ name used in the\n   DHCPv4 option shown in Section 4 and also used in the DHCPv6\
    \ option\n   shown in Section 5.\n   The domain name is encoded according to Section\
    \ 3.1 of RFC 1035\n   [RFC1035] whereby each label is represented as a one-octet\
    \ length\n   field followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain name\n\
    \   ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by\n   a\
    \ length byte of zero.  The high-order two bits of every length octet\n   MUST\
    \ be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit\n   the label\
    \ to 63 octets or less.  To simplify implementations, the\n   total length of\
    \ a domain name (i.e., label octets and label length\n   octets) is restricted\
    \ to 255 octets or less.\n"
- title: 4.  LoST Server DHCPv4 Option
  contents:
  - "4.  LoST Server DHCPv4 Option\n   The LoST server DHCPv4 option carries a DNS\
    \ (RFC 1035 [RFC1035])\n   fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to be used by the\
    \ LoST client to\n   locate a LoST server.\n   The DHCP option for this encoding\
    \ has the following format:\n         Code    Len   LoST Server Domain Name\n\
    \         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----\n         | 137 |  n\

    \ Note that the length field in the DHCPv4\n   option represents the length of\
    \ the entire domain name encoding,\n   whereas the length fields in the domain\
    \ name encoding (see Section 3)\n   is the length of a single domain name label.\n\

    \ List option, as described in [RFC2131].\n   The encoding of the domain name\
