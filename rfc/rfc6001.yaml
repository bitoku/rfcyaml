  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945]\
    \ extends\n   MPLS to handle multiple switching technologies: packet switching\n\
    \   (PSC), Layer 2 switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)\n   Switching,\
    \ wavelength switching (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC).  A\n   GMPLS switching\
    \ type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of a node\n   to forward data of\
    \ a particular data plane technology, and uniquely\n   identifies a control plane\
    \ LSP region.  LSP regions are defined in\n   [RFC4206].  A network comprised\
    \ of multiple switching types (e.g.,\n   PSC and TDM) controlled by a single GMPLS\
    \ control plane instance is\n   called a Multi-Region Network (MRN).\n   A data\
    \ plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of\n   terminating\
    \ and/or switching data traffic of a particular format.\n   For example, LSC,\
    \ TDM VC-11, and TDM VC-4-64c represent three\n   different layers.  A network\
    \ comprising transport nodes participating\n   in different data plane switching\
    \ layers controlled by a single GMPLS\n   control plane instance is called a Multi-Layer\
    \ Network (MLN).\n   The applicability of GMPLS to multiple switching technologies\n\
    \   provides the unified control and operations for both LSP provisioning\n  \
    \ and recovery.  This document covers the elements of a single GMPLS\n   control\
    \ plane instance controlling multiple layers within a given TE\n   domain.  A\
    \ TE domain is defined as group of Label Switching Routers\n   (LSRs) that enforces\
    \ a common TE policy.  A Control Plane (CP)\n   instance can serve one, two, or\
    \ more layers.  Other possible\n   approaches, such as having multiple CP instances\
    \ serving disjoint\n   sets of layers, are outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   The next sections provide the procedural aspects in terms of routing\n   and\
    \ signaling for such environments as well as the extensions\n   required to instrument\
    \ GMPLS to provide the capabilities for MLN/MRN\n   unified control.  The rationales\
    \ and requirements for Multi-\n   Layer/Region networks are set forth in [RFC5212].\
    \  These requirements\n   are evaluated against GMPLS protocols in [RFC5339] and\
    \ several areas\n   where GMPLS protocol extensions are required are identified.\n\
    \   This document defines GMPLS routing and signaling extensions so as to\n  \
    \ cover GMPLS MLN/MRN requirements.\n"

- title: 2.  Summary of the Requirements and Evaluation
  contents:
  - "2.  Summary of the Requirements and Evaluation\n   As identified in [RFC5339],\
    \ most MLN/MRN requirements rely on\n   mechanisms and procedures (such as local\
    \ procedures and policies, or\n   specific TE mechanisms and algorithms) that\
    \ are outside the scope of\n   the GMPLS protocols, and thus do not require any\
    \ GMPLS protocol\n   extensions.\n   Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols\
    \ and procedures have been\n   identified in [RFC5339]:\n   o GMPLS routing extensions\
    \ for the advertisement of the internal\n     adjustment capability of hybrid\
    \ nodes.  See Section 3.2.2 of\n     [RFC5339].\n   o GMPLS signaling extensions\
    \ for constrained multi-region signaling\n     (Switching Capability inclusion/exclusion).\
    \  See Section 3.2.1 of\n     [RFC5339].  An additional eXclude Route Object (XRO)\
    \ Label\n     subobject is also defined since it was absent from [RFC4874].\n\
    \   o GMPLS signaling extensions for the setup/deletion of virtual TE\n     links\
    \ (as well as exact trigger for its actual provisioning).  See\n     Section 3.1.1.2\
    \ of [RFC5339].\n   o GMPLS routing and signaling extensions for graceful TE link\n\
    \     deletion.  See Section 3.1.1.3 of [RFC5339].\n   The first three requirements\
    \ are addressed in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of\n   this document, respectively.  The\
    \ fourth requirement is addressed in\n   [RFC5710] with additional context provided\
    \ by [RFC5817].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor (IACD)\n   In the MRN context,\
    \ nodes that have at least one interface that\n   supports more than one switching\
    \ capability are called hybrid nodes\n   [RFC5212].  The logical composition of\
    \ a hybrid node contains at\n   least two distinct switching elements that are\
    \ interconnected by\n   \"internal links\" to provide adjustment between the supported\n\
    \   switching capabilities.  These internal links have finite capacities\n   that\
    \ MUST be taken into account when computing the path of a multi-\n   region TE-LSP.\
    \  The advertisement of the internal adjustment\n   capability is required as\
    \ it provides critical information when\n   performing multi-region path computation.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Overview\n   In an MRN environment, some LSRs could contain multiple switching\n\
    \   capabilities, such as PSC and TDM or PSC and LSC, all under the\n   control\
    \ of a single GMPLS instance.\n   These nodes, hosting multiple Interface Switching\
    \ Capabilities (ISCs)\n   [RFC4202], are required to hold and advertise resource\
    \ information on\n   link states and topology, just like other nodes (hosting\
    \ a single\n   ISC).  They may also have to consider some portions of internal\
    \ node\n   resources use to terminate hierarchical LSPs, since in circuit-\n \
    \  switching technologies (such as TDM, LSC, and FSC) LSPs require the\n   use\
    \ of resources allocated in a discrete manner (as predetermined by\n   the switching\
    \ type).  For example, a node with PSC+LSC hierarchical\n   switching capability\
    \ can switch a lambda LSP, but cannot terminate\n   the Lambda LSP if there is\
    \ no available (i.e., not already in use)\n   adjustment capability between the\
    \ LSC and the PSC switching\n   components.  Another example occurs when L2SC\
    \ (Ethernet) switching\n   can be adapted in the Link Access Procedure-SDH (LAPS)\
    \ X.86 and\n   Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) for instance, before reaching the\
    \ TDM\n   switching matrix.  Similar circumstances can occur, for example, if\
    \ a\n   switching fabric that supports both PSC and L2SC functionalities is\n\
    \   assembled with LSC interfaces enabling \"lambda\" encoding.  In the\n   switching\
    \ fabric, some interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and\n   perform frame (or\
    \ cell) switching whilst other interfaces can\n   terminate Lambda LSPs and perform\
    \ packet switching.\n   Therefore, within multi-region networks, the advertisement\
    \ of the so-\n   called adjustment capability to terminate LSPs (not the interface\n\
    \   capability since the latter can be inferred from the bandwidth\n   available\
    \ for each switching capability) provides the information to\n   take into account\
    \ when performing multi-region path computation.\n   This concept enables a node\
    \ to discriminate the remote nodes (and\n   thus allows their selection during\
    \ path computation) with respect to\n   their adjustment capability, e.g., to\
    \ terminate LSPs at the PSC or\n   LSC level.\n   Hence, we introduce the capability\
    \ of discriminating the (internal)\n   adjustment capability from the (interface)\
    \ switching capability by\n   defining an Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor\
    \ (IACD).\n   A more detailed problem statement can be found in [RFC5339].\n"

    \ is carried in the routing protocols or how it is processed when it is\n   received\
    \ [RFC4201], [RFC4203].\n   The receiving LSR uses its Link State Database to\

- title: 4.  Multi-Region Signaling
  contents:
  - "4.  Multi-Region Signaling\n   Section 6.2 of [RFC4206] specifies that when a\
    \ region boundary node\n   receives a Path message, the node determines whether\
    \ or not it is at\n   the edge of an LSP region with respect to the Explicit Route\
    \ Object\n   (ERO) carried in the message.  If the node is at the edge of a\n\
    \   region, it must then determine the other edge of the region with\n   respect\
    \ to the Explicit Route Object (ERO), using the IGP database.\n   The node then\
    \ extracts from the ERO the sub-sequence of hops from\n   itself to the other\
    \ end of the region.\n   The node then compares the sub-sequence of hops with\
    \ all existing\n   Forwarding Agency LSPs (FA-LSPs) originated by the node:\n\
    \   o If a match is found, that FA-LSP has enough unreserved bandwidth\n     for\
    \ the LSP being signaled, and the Generalized PID (G-PID) of the\n     FA-LSP\
    \ is compatible with the G-PID of the LSP being signaled, the\n     node uses\
    \ that FA-LSP as follows.  The Path message for the\n     original LSP is sent\
    \ to the egress of the FA-LSP.  The previous hop\n     (PHOP) in the message is\
    \ the address of the node at the head-end of\n     the FA-LSP.  Before sending\
    \ the Path message, the ERO in that\n     message is adjusted by removing the\
    \ subsequence of the ERO that\n     lies in the FA-LSP, and replacing it with\
    \ just the endpoint of the\n     FA-LSP.\n   o If no existing FA-LSP is found,\
    \ the node sets up a new FA-LSP.\n     That is, it initiates a new LSP setup just\
    \ for the FA-LSP.\n     Note: compatible G-PID implies that traffic can be processed\
    \ by\n     both ends of the FA-LSP without dropping traffic after its\n     establishment.\n\
    \   Applying the procedure of [RFC4206] in an MRN environment MAY lead to\n  \
    \ the setup of single-hop FA-LSPs between each pair of nodes.\n   Therefore, considering\
    \ that the path computation is able to take into\n   account richness of information\
    \ with regard to the SC available on\n   given nodes belonging to the path, it\
    \ is consistent to provide enough\n   signaling information to indicate the SC\
    \ to be used and over which\n   link.  Particularly, in case a TE link has multiple\
    \ SCs advertised as\n   part of its ISCD sub-TLVs, an ERO does not provide a mechanism\
    \ to\n   select a particular SC.\n   In order to limit the modifications to existing\
    \ RSVP-TE procedures\n   ([RFC3473] and referenced), this document defines a new\
    \ subobject of\n   the eXclude Route Object (XRO), see [RFC4874], called the Switching\n\
    \   Capability subobject.  This subobject enables (when desired) the\n   explicit\
    \ identification of at least one switching capability to be\n   excluded from\
    \ the resource selection process described above.\n   Including this subobject\
    \ as part of the XRO that explicitly indicates\n   which SCs have to be excluded\
    \ (before initiating the procedure\n   described here above) over a specified\
    \ TE link, solves the ambiguous\n   choice among SCs that are potentially used\
    \ along a given path and\n   give the possibility to optimize resource usage on\
    \ a multi-region\n   basis.  Note that implicit SC inclusion is easily supported\
    \ by\n   explicitly excluding other SCs (e.g., to include LSC, it is required\n\
    \   to exclude PSC, L2SC, TDM, and FSC).\n   The approach followed here is to\
    \ concentrate exclusions in XRO and\n   inclusions in ERO.  Indeed, the ERO specifies\
    \ the topological\n   characteristics of the path to be signaled.  Usage of Explicit\n\
