  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"IS-IS TLV Codepoints\" registry was created by [RFC3563]
    and\n   extended by [RFC6233].  The assignment policy for the registry is\n   \"Expert
    Review\" as defined in [RFC5226].  As documents related to\n   IS-IS are developed,
    the codepoints required for the protocol\n   extensions are reviewed by the Designated
    Experts and added to the\n   IANA-managed registry.  As these documents are published
    as RFCs, the\n   registries are updated to reference the relevant RFC.\n   In
    the case of TLVs supporting prefix advertisement, currently\n   separate sub-TLV
    registries are maintained for each TLV.  These\n   registries need to be combined
    into a common sub-TLV registry similar\n   to what has been done for neighbor
    advertisement TLVs.\n   In some cases, there is a need to allocate codepoints
    defined in\n   Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that seem likely to eventually gain Working\n
    \  Group approval, without waiting for those I-Ds to be published as\n   RFCs.
    \ This can be achieved using Expert Review, and this document\n   sets out guidance
    for the Designated Experts to apply when reviewing\n   allocations from the registry.\n"

  - "2.  IS Neighbor Sub-TLV Registry\n   There was an existing common sub-TLV registry
    named \"Sub-TLVs for\n   TLVs 22, 141, and 222\".  [RFC5311] defines the IS Neighbor
    Attribute\n   TLV (23) and the MT IS Neighbor Attribute TLV (223).  The format
    of\n   these TLVs is identical to TLVs 22 and 222, respectively.  The IS\n   Neighbor
    sub-TLV registry has been extended to include these two\n   TLVs.  Settings for
    inclusion of each sub-TLV are identical to the\n   settings for TLVs 22 and 222,
    respectively.\n"

  - "3.  Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV Registry\n   Previously, there existed separate
    sub-TLV registries for TLVs 135,\n   235, 236, and 237.  As in the case of the
    IS Neighbor TLVs discussed\n   in the previous section, assignment of sub-TLVs
    applicable to one or\n   more of these TLVs is intended to be common.  Therefore,
    the existing\n   separate sub-TLV registries have been combined into a single
    registry\n   entitled \"Sub-TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237\".  As existing\n
    \  sub-TLV assignments are common to all the TLVs, this represents no\n   change
    to the protocol -- only a clearer representation of the\n   intended sub-TLV allocation
    strategy.  The format of the registry is\n   as shown below:\n   Type  Description
    \                      135 235 236 237  Reference\n   ----  ------------                      ---
    --- --- ---  ---------\n   0     Unassigned\n   1     32-bit Administrative Tag
    Sub-TLV  y   y   y   y   [RFC5130]\n   2     64-bit Administrative Tag Sub-TLV
    \ y   y   y   y   [RFC5130]\n   3-255 Unassigned\n"

  - "4.  Guidance for Designated Experts\n   When new I-Ds are introduced requiring
    new codepoints, it is\n   advantageous to be able to allocate codepoints without
    waiting for\n   them to progress to RFC.  The reasons this is advantageous are\n
    \  described in [RFC7120].  However, the procedures in [RFC7120] for\n   early
    allocation do not apply to registries, such as the \"IS-IS TLV\n   Codepoints\"
    registry, that utilize the \"Expert Review\" allocation\n   policy.  In such cases,
    what is required is that a request be made to\n   the Designated Experts who MAY
    approve the assignments according to\n   the guidance that has been established
    for the registry concerned.\n   The following guidance applies specifically to
    the \"IS-IS TLV\n   Codepoints\" registry.\n   1.  Application for a codepoint
    allocation MAY be made to the\n       Designated Experts at any time.\n   2.  The
    Designated Experts SHOULD only consider requests that arise\n       from I-Ds
    that have already been accepted as Working Group\n       documents or that are
    planned for progression as AD Sponsored\n       documents in the absence of a
    suitably chartered Working Group.\n   3.  In the case of Working Group documents,
    the Designated Experts\n       SHOULD check with the Working Group chairs that
    there is\n       consensus within the Working Group to make the allocation at
    this\n       time.  In the case of AD Sponsored documents, the Designated\n       Experts
    SHOULD check with the AD for approval to make the\n       allocation at this time.\n
    \  4.  The Designated Experts SHOULD then review the assignment requests\n       on
    their technical merit.  The Designated Experts SHOULD NOT seek\n       to overrule
    IETF consensus, but they MAY raise issues for further\n       consideration before
    the assignments are made.\n   5.  Once the Designated Experts have granted approval,
    IANA will\n       update the registry by marking the allocated codepoints with
    a\n       reference to the associated document as normal.\n   6.  In the event
    that the document fails to progress to RFC, the\n       Expiry and deallocation
    process defined in [RFC7120] MUST be\n       followed for the relevant codepoints
    -- noting that the\n       Designated Experts perform the role assigned to Working
    Group\n       chairs.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document provides guidance to the Designated
    Experts appointed\n   to manage allocation requests in the \"IS-IS TLV Codepoints\"
    registry.\n   IANA has updated the registry that was specified as \"Sub-TLVs for\n
    \  TLVs 22, 141, and 222\" to be named \"Sub-TLVs for TLVs 22, 23, 141,\n   222,
    and 223\".\n   Per this document, the existing sub-TLV registries for TLVs 135,
    235,\n   236, and 237 have been combined into a single registry -- the\n   \"Sub-TLVs
    for TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237\" registry -- as described\n   in Section 3.\n"
