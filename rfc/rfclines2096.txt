This memo defines an update to RFC 1354, "IP Forwarding Table MIB", for Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR).
That document was developed by the Router Requirements Working Group as an update to RFC 1213's ipRouteTable, with the display of multiple routes as a primary objective.
The significant difference between this MIB and RFC 1354 is the recognition (explicitly discussed but by consensus left to future work) that CIDR routes may have the same network number but different network masks.
Note that this MIB obsoletes a number of objects from RFC 1354.
The reader should pay careful attention to the STATUS field.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three major components.
the MIB II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
the protocol, RFC 1157 [6] and/or RFC 1905 [4], the protocol for accessing managed information.
Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [3], and conformance statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
The MIB consists of two tables and two global objects.
The object ipForwardNumber indicates the number of current routes.
This is primarily to avoid having to read the table in order to determine this number.
The ipForwardTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to display multipath IP Routes.
This is in turn obsoleted by the ipCidrRouteTable.
The ipCidrRouteTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to display multipath IP Routes having the same network number but differing network masks.
