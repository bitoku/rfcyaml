  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 6310 [RFC6310] specifies the mapping and notification\
    \ of defect\n   states between a pseudowire (PW) and the Attachment Circuit (AC)\
    \ of\n   the end-to-end emulated service.  It standardizes the behavior of\n \
    \  Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to PW and AC defects for a number\n   of\
    \ technologies (e.g., Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame\n   Relay (FR))\
    \ emulated over PWs in MPLS and MPLS/IP Packet Switched\n   Networks (PSNs). \
    \ However, [RFC6310] does not describe this function\n   for the Ethernet PW service\
    \ owing to its unique characteristics.\n   This document specifies the mapping\
    \ of defect states between ACs and\n   associated Ethernet PWs connected in accordance\
    \ with the PWE3\n   architecture [RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet\n\
    \   service.  This document augments the mapping of defect states between\n  \
    \ a PW and associated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in\n   [RFC6310].\
    \  Similar to [RFC6310], the intent of this document is to\n   standardize the\
    \ behavior of PEs with respect to failures on Ethernet\n   ACs and PWs, so that\
    \ there is no ambiguity about the alarms generated\n   and consequent actions\
    \ undertaken by PEs in response to specific\n   failure conditions.\n"

- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   There are a number of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n\
    \   (OAM) technologies defined for Ethernet, providing various\n   functionalities.\
    \  This document covers the following Ethernet OAM\n   mechanisms and their interworking\
    \ with PW OAM mechanisms:\n   -  Ethernet Link OAM [802.3]\n   -  Ethernet Local\
    \ Management Interface (E-LMI) [MEF16]\n   -  Ethernet Continuity Check (CC) [CFM]\
    \ [Y.1731]\n   -  Ethernet Alarm Indication Signaling (AIS) and Remote Defect\n\
    \      Indication (RDI) [Y.1731]\n   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] allows some link\
    \ defect states to be\n   detected and communicated across an Ethernet link. \
    \ When an Ethernet\n   AC is an Ethernet physical port, there may be some application\
    \ of\n   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3].  Further, E-LMI [MEF16] also allows for\n\
    \   some Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) defect states to be communicated\n   across\
    \ an Ethernet User Network Interface (UNI) where Ethernet UNI\n   constitutes\
    \ a single-hop Ethernet link (i.e., without any bridges\n   compliant with IEEE\
    \ 802.1Q/.1ad in between).  There may be some\n   application of E-LMI [MEF16]\
    \ for failure notification across single-\n   hop Ethernet ACs in certain deployments\
    \ that specifically do not\n   support IEEE Connectivity Fault Management [CFM]\
    \ and/or ITU-T Y.1731\n   [Y.1731], simply referred to as CFM and Y.1731, respectively,\
    \ in this\n   document.  Mechanisms based on Y.1731 and CFM are applicable in\
    \ all\n   types of Ethernet ACs.  Ethernet Link OAM and E-LMI are optional, and\n\
    \   their applicability is called out, where applicable.\n   Native service (NS)\
    \ OAM may be transported transparently over the\n   corresponding PW as user data.\
    \  This is referred to as the \"single\n   emulated OAM loop mode\" per [RFC6310].\
    \  For Ethernet, as an example,\n   CFM continuity check messages (CCMs) between\
    \ two Maintenance Entity\n   Group End Points (MEPs) can be transported transparently\
    \ as user data\n   over the corresponding PW.  At MEP locations, service failure\
    \ is\n   detected when CCMs are not received over an interval that is 3.5\n  \
    \ times the local CCM transmission interval.  This is one of the\n   failure conditions\
    \ detected via continuity check.  MEP peers can\n   exist between customer edge\
    \ (CE) endpoints (MEPs of a given\n   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) reside on\
    \ the CEs), between PE pairs\n   (the MEPs of a given MEG reside on the PEs),\
    \ or between the CE and PE\n   (the MEPs of a given MEG reside on the PE and CE),\
    \ as long as the MEG\n   level nesting rules are maintained.  It should be noted\
    \ that Ethernet\n   allows the definition of up to 8 MEG levels, each comprised\
    \ of MEPs\n   (Down MEPs and Up MEPs) and Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate\n\
    \   Points (MIPs).  These levels can be nested or touching.  MEPs and\n   MIPs\
    \ generate and process messages in the same MEG level.  Thus, in\n   this document,\
    \ when we refer to messages sent by a MEP or a MIP to a\n   peer MEP or MIP, these\
    \ MEPs and MIPs are in the same MEG level.\n   When interworking two networking\
    \ domains, such as native Ethernet and\n   PWs to provide an end-to-end emulated\
    \ service, there is a need to\n   identify the failure domain and location even\
    \ when a PE supports both\n   the NS OAM mechanisms and the PW OAM mechanisms.\
    \  In addition,\n   scalability constraints may not allow running proactive monitoring,\n\
    \   such as CCMs with transmission enabled, at a PE to detect the failure\n  \
    \ of an EVC across the PW domain.  Thus, network-driven alarms\n   generated upon\
    \ failure detection in the NS or PW domain and their\n   mappings to the other\
    \ domain are needed.  There are also cases where\n   a PE MAY not be able to process\
    \ NS OAM messages received on the PW\n   even when such messages are defined,\
    \ as in the case of Ethernet,\n   necessitating the need for fault notification\
    \ message mapping between\n   the PW domain and the NS domain.\n   For Multi-Segment\
    \ PWs (MS-PWs) [RFC5659], Switching PEs (S-PEs) are\n   not aware of the NS. \
    \ Thus, failure detection and notification at\n   S-PEs will be based on PW OAM\
    \ mechanisms.  Mapping between PW OAM and\n   NS OAM will be required at the Terminating\
    \ PEs (T-PEs) to propagate\n   the failure notification to the EVC end points.\n"

  - "4.4.1.  PW Receive Defect State Entry and Exit\n   As described in Section 6.2.1\
    \ of [RFC6310], PE1 will enter the PW\n   receive defect state if one or more\
    \ of the following occur:\n   -  It receives a Forward Defect Indication (FDI)\
    \ from PE2 either\n      indicating a receive defect on the remote AC or indicating\
    \ that\n      PE2 detected or was notified of a downstream PW fault.\n   -  It\
    \ detects loss of connectivity on the PSN tunnel upstream of PE1,\n      which\
    \ affects the traffic it receives from PE2.\n   -  It detects a loss of PW connectivity\
    \ through VCCV-BFD, VCCV-Ping,\n      or NS OAM mechanisms (i.e., CC) when enabled,\
    \ which affects the\n      traffic it receives from PE2.\n   Note that if the\
    \ PW LDP control session between the PEs fails, the PW\n   is torn down and needs\
    \ to be re-established.  However, the consequent\n   actions towards the ACs are\
    \ the same as if the PW entered the receive\n   defect state.\n   PE1 will exit\
    \ the PW receive defect state when the following\n   conditions are met.  Note\
    \ that this may result in a transition to the\n   PW operational state or the\
    \ PW transmit defect state.\n   -  All previously detected defects have disappeared.\n\
    \   -  PE2 cleared the FDI, if applicable.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Ethernet Native Service Management\n   This appendix is informative.\n\
    \   Ethernet OAM mechanisms are broadly classified into two categories:\n   Fault\
    \ Management (FM) and Performance Monitoring (PM).  ITU-T Y.1731\n   [Y.1731]\
    \ provides coverage for both FM and PM while IEEE CFM [CFM]\n   provides coverage\
    \ for a subset of FM functions.\n   Ethernet OAM also introduces the concept of\
    \ a Maintenance Entity\n   (ME), which is used to identify the entity that needs\
    \ to be managed.\n   An ME is inherently a point-to-point association.  However,\
    \ in the\n   case of a multipoint association, a Maintenance Entity Group (MEG)\n\
    \   consisting of different MEs is used.  IEEE 802.1 uses the concept of\n   a\
    \ Maintenance Association (MA), which is used to identify both point-\n   to-point\
    \ and multipoint associations.  Each MEG/MA consists of MEG\n   End Points (MEPs)\
    \ that are responsible for originating OAM frames.\n   In between the MEPs, there\
    \ can also be MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs)\n   that do not originate OAM frames\
    \ but do respond to OAM frames from\n   MEPs.\n   Ethernet OAM allows for hierarchical\
    \ Maintenance Entities to allow\n   for simultaneous end-to-end and segment monitoring.\
    \  This is achieved\n   by having a provision of up to 8 MEG levels (MD levels),\
    \ where each\n   MEP or MIP is associated with a specific MEG level.\n   It is\
    \ important to note that the FM mechanisms common to both IEEE\n   CFM [CFM] and\
    \ ITU-T Y.1731 [Y.1731] are completely compatible.\n   The common FM mechanisms\
    \ include:\n   1) Continuity Check Message (CCM)\n   2) Loopback Message (LBM)\
    \ and Loopback Reply (LBR)\n   3) Link Trace Message (LTM) and Link Trace Reply\
    \ (LTR)\n   CCMs are used for fault detection, including misconnections and\n\
    \   misconfigurations.  Typically, CCMs are sent as multicast frames or\n   unicast\
    \ frames and also allow RDI notifications.  LBM and LBR are\n   used to perform\
    \ fault verification, while also allowing for MTU\n   verification and CIR/EIR\
    \ (Committed Information Rate / Excess\n   Information Rate) measurements.  LTM\
    \ and LTR can be used for\n   discovering the path traversed between a MEP and\
    \ another target\n   MIP/MEP in the same MEG.  LTM and LTR also allow for fault\n\
    \   localization.\n   In addition, ITU-T Y.1731 [Y.1731] also specifies the following\
    \ FM\n   functions:\n   4) Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)\n   AIS allows for fault\
    \ notification to downstream and upstream nodes.\n   Further, ITU-T Y.1731 [Y.1731]\
    \ also specifies the following PM\n   functions:\n   5) Loss Measurement Message\
    \ (LMM) and Loss Measurement Reply (LMR)\n   6) Delay Measurement Message (DMM)\
    \ and Delay Measurement Reply (DMR)\n   7) 1-way Delay Measurement (1DM)\n   While\
    \ LMM and LMR are used to measure Frame Loss Ratio (FLR), DMM and\n   DMR are\
    \ used to measure single-ended (aka two-way) Frame Delay (FD)\n   and Frame Delay\
    \ Variation (FDV, also known as Jitter).  1DM can be\n   used for dual-ended (aka\
    \ one-way) FD and FDV measurements.\n"
