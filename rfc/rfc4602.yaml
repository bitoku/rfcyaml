  - "1.  Introduction\n   This analysis provides supporting documentation to advance\
    \ the\n   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing\n   protocol\
    \ from the IETF Experimental status to Proposed Standard.\n   PIM-SM was first\
    \ published as RFC 2117 [RFC2117] in 1997 and then\n   again as RFC 2362 [RFC2362]\
    \ in 1998.  The protocol was classified as\n   Experimental in both of these documents.\
    \  The PIM-SM protocol\n   specification was then rewritten in whole in order\
    \ to more fully\n   specify the protocol.  It is this new specification that is\
    \ to be\n   advanced to Proposed Standard.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC 1264 Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC 1264 Requirements\n   Section 4.0 of RFC 1264 [RFC1264] describes the\
    \ requirements for\n   routing protocols to advance to Proposed Standard.  Each\
    \ requirement\n   is listed below along with an explanation of how the requirement\
    \ has\n   been satisfied.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Documents Specifying the Protocol and Its Usage
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Documents Specifying the Protocol and Its Usage\n   The authors of the\
    \ new PIM-SM specification [RFC4601] have taken\n   considerable care to fully\
    \ specify the protocol operation.  It\n   removes all known ambiguities and tries\
    \ to normalize corner cases\n   that existed in the previous specification.  It\
    \ has been used to\n   provide several interoperable implementations by developers\
    \ that were\n   not authors of the specification.  These implementations will\
    \ be\n   described below.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Management Information Base\n   A Management Information Base for PIM is\
    \ currently specified in RFC\n   2934 [RFC2934].  This MIB has many implementations\
    \ and has been used\n   by network management applications for several years.\
    \  Updates to\n   this MIB to support IPv6 and other improvements based on operation\n\
    \   experience are in progress in the PIM Working Group of the IETF.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Explicit Security Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Explicit Security Architecture\n   The new PIM Sparse-Mode protocol specification\
    \ contains an extensive\n   security section explaining its security features\
    \ and limitations.\n   Data integrity protection and groupwise data origin authentication\
    \ is\n   provided for PIM protocol messages.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Implementation Existence
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Implementation Existence\n   There are at least 4 known independent implementations\
    \ of the new\n   protocol specification, and there are over 6 independent\n  \
    \ implementations of a previous version (RFC 2362) of the\n   specification. \
    \ The new specification was carefully written to be\n   backward compatible with\
    \ the old specification allowing\n   implementations compliant with RFC 2362 to\
    \ also be compliant with the\n   new specification.\n   The 4 implementations\
    \ of the new version are described below.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5.1.  Cisco\n   The Cisco implementation has undergone extensive laboratory\
    \ testing\n   as well as testing in production deployments.  It is found to\n\
    \   interoperate with implementations of earlier versions of the PIM\n   Sparse-Mode\
    \ protocol specification.\n"
- title: 2.5.2.  XORP
  contents:
  - "2.5.2.  XORP\n   The XORP PIM-SM implementation has been thoughtfully tested\n\
    \   internally by the XORP project.  The emphasis during testing has been\n  \
    \ on correctness.  In a typical setup, a PIM-SM router's behavior is\n   tested\
    \ by connecting it to external packet generators and observers.\n   The packet\
    \ generators are used to generate messages such as IGMP and\n   PIM-SM control\
    \ packets, and multicast data packets.  The packet\n   observers are used to observe\
    \ the PIM-SM control packets generated by\n   the PIM-SM router under test, and\
    \ to observe the data packets that\n   may be forwarded by that router.  In addition,\
    \ the router's command-\n   line interface has been used to observe its internal\
    \ state during\n   some of the tests.\n   The test scenarios have been designed\
    \ to follow the protocol\n   specification closely (e.g., a separate test has\
    \ been created for\n   each event in the various protocol state machines, etc).\
    \  All test\n   scenarios are described in detail in the XORP PIM-SM Test Suite\n\
    \   [XORP-TEST].\n   The major tested features are:\n   1.  Multicast data forwarding.\n\
    \   2.  PIM Hello messages exchange, PIM router neighbor discovery,\n       option\
    \ exchange, and DR election.\n   3.  PIM Register messages transmission and reception,\
    \ PIM Register\n       state machine, and multicast data packets encapsulation\
    \ and\n       decapsulation.\n   4.  Transmission and reception of PIM Join/Prune\
    \ messages and\n       upstream and downstream protocol state machines.  The tests\n\
    \       consider the following state: (*,*,RP), (*,G), (S,G), and\n       (S,G,rpt).\n\
    \   5.  Transmission and reception of PIM Assert messages and the per-\n     \
    \  interface (*,G) and (S,G) Assert state machines.\n   6.  PIM Bootstrap mechanism:\
    \ transmission, reception, and forwarding\n       of PIM Bootstrap messages (BSMs),\
    \ transmission and reception of\n       PIM Cand-RP-Adv messages, candidate and\
    \ non-candidate Bootstrap\n       Router (BSR) state machines, creating the RP-Set\
    \ at the BSR,\n       receiving and using the RP-Set, and semantic fragmentation\
    \ of\n       BSMs.\n   In the final tests, the tested router behaved as specified\
    \ in the\n   PIM-SM protocol specification.  All issues found in the protocol\n\
    \   specification itself have been corrected in earlier versions of the\n   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5.3.  Procket Networks\n   The Procket Networks implementation was deployed\
    \ in many research and\n   service provider networks and showed interoperability\
    \ with new and\n   old Cisco Systems implementations as well as Juniper Networks\n\
    \   implementations.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Suitability
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Suitability\n   PIM Sparse-Mode is a protocol for efficiently routing multicast\n\
    \   groups that may span wide-area (and inter-domain) Internets.  PIM\n   uses\
    \ the underlying unicast routing to provide reverse-path\n   information for multicast\
    \ tree building, but it is not dependent on\n   any particular unicast routing\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Authentication Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Authentication Mechanisms\n   PIM specifies the use of the IP security\
    \ (IPsec) authentication\n   header (AH) to provide data integrity protection\
    \ and groupwise data\n   origin authentication of protocol messages.  The specific\
    \ AH\n   authentication algorithm and parameters, including the choice of\n  \
    \ authentication algorithm and the choice of key, are configured by the\n   network\
    \ administrator.  The threats associated with receiving forged\n   PIM messages\
    \ are outlined in the security considerations section of\n   the protocol specification.\n"
