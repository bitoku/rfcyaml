  - "1.  Introduction\n   Synchronization of an Open Mobile Alliance Converged Address\
    \ Book\n   [OMA-CAB], using Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronization [OMA-DS],\n\
    \   commonly uses vCard as an exchange format between the DS Server and\n   the\
    \ DS Client.  In order to properly perform synchronization of an\n   OMA-CAB,\
    \ the CAB specification defines some CAB contact fields not\n   already defined\
    \ in the vCard base specification.  This document\n   reuses the definitions found\
    \ in the OMA-CAB specification and\n   describes them as vCard extensions.  The\
    \ following sections define\n   the necessary Properties and Parameters.\n"
- title: 1.1.  A Brief Introduction to the Converged Address Book
  contents:
  - "1.1.  A Brief Introduction to the Converged Address Book\n   The Converged Address\
    \ Book (CAB) Enabler provides consistent\n   mechanisms to manage contact information\
    \ both in user-facing\n   applications and in support of network-facing activities.\
    \  At the\n   core of this enabler is a network-based contact repository in which\
    \ a\n   user can store contact information.  That information can be\n   retrieved\
    \ by any CAB-enabled device.  The network-based repository is\n   also able to\
    \ provide specific contact information to other users and\n   to keep their copies\
    \ up to date whenever the information is changed.\n   The CAB Enabler provides\
    \ synchronization of the contact information\n   available in the user device(s)\
    \ with the network-based contact\n   repository.\n   The CAB Enabler also manages\
    \ the distribution of a user's own contact\n   information.  In essence, a user\
    \ fills out a Personal Contact Card,\n   which includes all the information a\
    \ user wishes to store about\n   himself or herself.\n   Because systems that\
    \ are supporting the CAB Enabler are likely\n   supporting multiple users, the\
    \ CAB Enabler also defines a search\n   paradigm that permits other users to query\
    \ those systems to locate\n   information about the available users.\n   The CAB\
    \ Enabler supports many different types of information.  It\n   therefore has\
    \ a data model that is flexible and extensible.  It\n   manages traditional types\
    \ of contact information (such as name,\n   address, email, phone number, mobile\
    \ number) as well as new types of\n   information (such as websites, blogs, presence\
    \ subscription\n   references).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology Used in This Document\n   Syntax specifications shown here\
    \ use the augmented Backus-Naur Form\n   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234] and\
    \ are specified as in the base\n   vCard specification [RFC6350].\n"
- title: '2.  vCard Extensions: Properties'
  contents:
  - "2.  vCard Extensions: Properties\n   The following sections define the CAB Properties.\n\
    \   Note:\n   Some string-value vCard properties are defined herein for which\
    \ no\n   specific list of allowed strings is specified.  For those properties,\n\
    \   it is intended that de facto taxonomies might develop.  One vCard\n   can,\
    \ for example, specify a hobby of \"philately\", while another uses\n   \"stamp\
    \ collecting\", and a third has \"old postage stamps\".  Usage, not\n   specification,\
    \ may lead to a preference over time for a single term.\n   In general, these\
    \ are meant to be understood by humans, rather than\n   to be used for automated\
    \ categorization that might require standard\n   terms and registries.\n"
