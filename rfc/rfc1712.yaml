  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the format of a new Resource Record (RR) for\n\
    \   the Domain Naming System (DNS), and reserves a corresponding DNS type\n  \
    \ mnemonic and numerical code.  This definition deals with associating\n   geographical\
    \ host location mappings to host names within a domain.\n   The data shown in\
    \ this document is fictitious and does not\n   necessarily reflect the real Internet.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   It has been a long standing problem to relate IP numbers\
    \ to\n   geographical locations. The availability of Geographical location\n \
    \  information has immediate applications in network management.  Such\n   information\
    \ can be used to supplement the data already provided by\n   utilities such as\
    \ whois [Har85], traceroute [VJ89], and nslookup\n   [UCB89].  The usefulness\
    \ and functionality of these already widely\n   used tools would be greatly enhanced\
    \ by the provision of reliable\n   geographical location information.\n   The\
    \ ideal way to manage and maintain a database of information, such\n   as geographical\
    \ location of internet hosts, is to delegate\n   responsibility to local domain\
    \ administrators. A large distributed\n   database could be implemented with a\
    \ simple mechanism for updating\n   the local information.  A query mechanism\
    \ also has to be available\n   for checking local entries, as well as inquiring\
    \ about data from\n   non-local domains.\n"
- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The Internet continues to grow at an ever increasing rate with\
    \ IP\n   numbers allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis.  Deciding when\n\
    \   and how to setup a database of geographical information about\n   internet\
    \ hosts presented a number of options.  The uumap project\n   [UU85] was the first\
    \ serious attempt to collect geographical location\n   data from sites and store\
    \ it centrally.  This project met with\n   limited success because of the difficulty\
    \ in maintaining and updating\n   a large central database.  Another problem was\
    \ the lack of tools for\n   the checking the data supplied, this problem resulted\
    \ in some\n   erroneous data entering the database.\n"
- title: '2.1 SNMP:'
  contents:
  - "2.1 SNMP:\n   Using an SNMP get request on the sysLocation MIB (Management\n\
    \   Information Base) variable was also an option, however this would\n   require\
    \ the host to be running an appropriate agent with public read\n   access.  It\
    \ was also felt that MIB data should reflect local\n   management data (e.g.,\
    \ \"this\" host is on level 5 room 74) rather than\n   a hosts geographical position.\
    \  This view is supported in the\n   examples given in literature in this area\
    \ [ROSE91].\n"
- title: '2.2 X500:'
  contents:
  - "2.2 X500:\n   The X.500 Directory service [X.500.88] defined as part of the ISO\n\
    \   standards also appears as a potential provider of geographical\n   location\
    \ data. However due to the limited implementations of this\n   service it was\
    \ decided to defer this until this service gains wider\n   use and acceptance\
    \ within the Internet community.\n"
- title: '2.3 BIND:'
  contents:
  - "2.3 BIND:\n   The DNS [Mock87a][Mock87b] represents an existing system ideally\n\
    \   suited to the provision of host specific information. The DNS is a\n   widely\
    \ used and well-understood mechanism for providing a distributed\n   database\
    \ of such information and its extensible nature allows it to\n   be used to disseminate\
    \ virtually any information.  The most commonly\n   used DNS implementation is\
    \ the Berkeley Internet Name Domain server\n   BIND [UCB89].  The information\
    \ we wished to make available needed to\n   be updated locally but available globally;\
    \ a perfect match with the\n   services provided by the DNS. Current DNS servers\
    \ provide a variety\n   of useful information about hosts in their domain but\
    \ lack the\n   ability to report a host's geographical location.\n"

    \ precision with an acceptable average encoded record\n   length.\n"
- title: 4. The GPOS RR
  contents:
  - "4. The GPOS RR\n   The geographical location is defined with the mnemonic GPOS\
    \ and type\n   code 27.\n   GPOS has the following format:\n           <owner>\
    \ <ttl> <class> GPOS <longitude> <latitude> <altitude>\n   A floating point format\
    \ was chosen to specify geographical locations\n   for reasons of simplicity.\
    \  This also guarantees a concise\n   unambiguous description of a location by\
    \ enforcing three compulsory\n   numerical values to be specified.\n   The owner,\
    \ ttl, and class fields are optional and default to the last\n   defined value\
    \ if omitted. The longitude is a floating point number\n   ranging from -90 to\
    \ 90 with positive values indicating locations\n   north of the equator.  For\
    \ example Perth, Western Australia is\n   located at 32^ 7` 19\" south of the\
    \ equator which would be specified\n   as -32.68820.  The latitude is a number\
    \ ranging from -180.0 to 180.0.\n   For example Perth, Western Australia is located\
    \ at 116^ 2' 25\" east\n   of the prime meridian which would be specified as 116.86520.\
    \  Curtin\n   University, Perth is also 10 meters above sea-level.\n   The valid\
    \ GPOS record for a host at Curtin University in  Perth\n   Western Australia\
    \ would therefore be:\n                GPOS -32.6882 116.8652 10.0\n   There is\
    \ no limit imposed on the number of decimal places, although\n   the length of\
    \ the encoded string is limited to 256 characters for\n   each field. It is also\
    \ suggested that administrators limit their\n   entries to the minimum number\
    \ of necessary characters in each field.\n"
- title: 5. Master File Format
  contents:
  - "5. Master File Format\n   Each host requires its own GPOS field in the corresponding\
    \  DNS RR to\n   explicitly specify its geographical location and altitude.  If\
    \ the\n   GPOS field is omitted, a DNS enquiry will return no position\n   information\
    \ for that host.\n   Consider the following example:\n"
