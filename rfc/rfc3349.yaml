- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Each BEEP profile [1] is identified by a URI [2].  The BEEP\n\
    \   specification uses URIs to identify a BEEP profile both:\n   o  statically,\
    \ when a profile is formally defined (RFC 3080's Section\n      5.1); and,\n \
    \  o  dynamically, during channel management (RFC 3080's Section 2.3.1).\n   If\
    \ the BEEP profile appears on the standards-track [3], then the IANA\n   is responsible\
    \ for assigning the URI associated with the BEEP\n   profile.  Otherwise, the\
    \ entity specifying the BEEP profile is free\n   to assign a URI under its administration\
    \ to the profile.\n   If a working group of the IETF is developing a BEEP profile,\
    \ then,\n   during the development process, it is desirable to use a transient\n\
    \   identifier for the profile.  Further, it is desirable that the\n   transient\
    \ identifier be associated with the working group.\n   This memo defines the practice\
    \ for making such an assignment.  Note\n   that this practice does not apply to\
    \ activities outside of working\n   groups -- anyone able to assign a URL is capable\
    \ of defining a URI\n   for the purposes of identifying the BEEP profiles that\
    \ they develop.\n"
- title: 2. Practice
  contents:
  - "2. Practice\n   When a working group is formed, the IETF secretariat assigns\
    \ a brief\n   mnemonic prefix to the working group, e.g., \"provreg\" or \"sacred\"\
    .\n   When a working group begins development of a document which specifies\n\
    \   a BEEP profile, the working group chair assigns a transient\n   identifier\
    \ of the form \"http://iana.org/beep/transient/XXX/YYY\" where\n   \"XXX\" is\
    \ the working group's mnemonic and \"YYY\" is a unique string.\n   Although the\
    \ resulting URI must conform to the URI syntax, the \"YYY\"\n   portion is otherwise\
    \ arbitrary.  For example, it may contain a sub-\n   hierarchy (e.g., \"epp/1.0\"\
    ).\n   For example,\n       http://iana.org/beep/transient/provreg/epp/1.0\n \
    \      http://iana.org/beep/transient/sacred/pdm\n   might be assigned by the\
    \ chairs of the \"provreg\" and \"sacred\" working\n   groups, respectively.\n\
    \   Following this, the working group chair completes a BEEP profile\n   registration\
    \ template, and submits this information to the IANA.\n   Note that although the\
    \ IETF hasn't established a practice with\n   respect to the use of capitalization\
    \ in URLs employed for namespace\n   purposes, the W3C has a lowercase-only policy.\
    \  Working group chairs\n   are encouraged to consider this when making assignments.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   This document describes an administrative convention\
    \ and raises no\n   additional security considerations.  Of course, each BEEP-based\n\
    \   protocol has its own set of security considerations, which should be\n   described\
    \ in the relevant specification.\n"
