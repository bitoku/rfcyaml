This RFC describes the policy for the registration of second level domains under the ".MIL" domain.
The ".MIL" domain is delegated from the root authority to the US Department of Defense (DoD).
Only US military services, unified or specified commands, and operating agencies of the DoD which do not report through military service chains can be registered as a second level domain under the ".MIL" domain.
All other DoD organizations will register through their respective second level domain administrators using the registration procedures established by those offices.
The ".MIL" domain is administered by the DoD Network Information Center (NIC).
The domain names under the ".MIL" will be descriptive of the organization they will service.
The domain name length is preferred to be 12 characters or less, and must be unique (first come first serve if duplicates occur).
Each second level domain under the ".MIL" domain will be supported by at least two name servers.
Preferably these servers will be located in two separate networks.
All DNS servers supporting subdomains of the ".MIL" domain must be in the ".MIL" domain.
Prospective second level domain administrators in the ".MIL" domain will request registration using the template provided by the DoD NIC.
The templates are available via anonymous FTP or interactively via the DoD NIC World Wide Web Homepage.
The domain request template shall be submitted to the DoD NIC hostmaster (hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil).
The DoD NIC hostmaster will only accept domain registration templates from registered ".MIL" users.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
