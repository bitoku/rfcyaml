  - "Abstract\n   This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing\n
    \  architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The extension presented\n   in
    this document allows for unicast-prefix-based assignment of\n   multicast addresses.
    \ By delegating multicast addresses at the same\n   time as unicast prefixes,
    network operators will be able to identify\n   their multicast addresses without
    needing to run an inter-domain\n   allocation protocol.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3180 [RFC3180] defines an allocation mechanism (called
    \"GLOP\") in\n   233/8 whereby an Autonomous System (AS) number is embedded in
    the\n   middle 16 bits of an IPv4 multicast address, resulting in 256\n   multicast
    addresses per AS.  Advantages of this mechanism include the\n   ability to get
    multicast address space without an inter-domain\n   multicast address allocation
    protocol, and the ease of determining\n   the AS that was assigned the address
    for debugging and auditing\n   purposes.\n   Some disadvantages of GLOP include:\n
    \  o  RFC 4893 [RFC4893] expands the size of an AS number to 4 bytes,\n      and
    GLOP cannot work with 4-byte AS numbers.\n   o  When an AS covers multiple sites
    or organizations, administration\n      of the multicast address space within
    an AS must be handled by\n      other mechanisms, such as manual administrative
    effort or the\n      Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP)\n
    \     [RFC2730].\n   o  During debugging, identifying the AS does not immediately
    identify\n      the correct organization when an AS covers multiple organizations.\n
    \  o  Only 256 addresses are automatically available per AS, and\n      obtaining
    any more requires administrative effort.\n   More recently, a mechanism [RFC3306]
    has been developed for IPv6 that\n   provides a multicast range to every IPv6
    subnet, which is at a much\n   finer granularity than an AS.  As a result, the
    first three\n   disadvantages above are avoided (and the last disadvantage does
    not\n   apply to IPv6 due to the extended size of the address space).\n   Another
    advantage of providing multicast space to a subnet, rather\n   than just to an
    entire AS, is that multicast address assignments\n   within the range need only
    be coordinated within the subnet.\n   This document specifies a mechanism similar
    to [RFC3306], whereby a\n   range of global IPv4 multicast address space is provided
    to each\n   organization that has unicast address space.  A resulting advantage\n
    \  over GLOP is that the mechanisms in IPv4 and IPv6 become more\n   similar.\n
    \  This document does not obsolete or update RFC 3180, as the mechanism\n   described
    in RFC 3180 is still required for organizations with prefix\n   allocations more
    specific than /24.  Organizations using RFC 3180\n   allocations may continue
    to do so.  In fact, it is conceivable that\n   an organization might use both
    RFC 3180 allocations and the\n   allocation method described in this document.\n"

  - "3.  Address Space\n   A multicast address with the prefix 234/8 indicates that
    the address\n   is a Unicast-Based Multicast (UBM) address.  The remaining 24
    bits\n   are used as follows:\n   Bits:  |   0 thru 7   |         8 thru N        |
    \  N+1 thru 31   |\n          +-------+--------------------+-----------------------------+\n
    \  Value: |     234      |      Unicast Prefix     |    Group ID     |\n          +-------+--------------------+-----------------------------+\n
    \  For organizations with a /24 or shorter prefix, the unicast prefix of\n   the
    organization is appended to the common /8.  Any remaining bits\n   may be assigned
    by any mechanism the organization wishes.\n   For example, an organization that
    has a /16 prefix assigned might\n   choose to assign multicast addresses manually
    from the /24 multicast\n   prefix derived from the above method.  Alternatively,
    the\n   organization might choose to delegate the use of multicast addresses\n
    \  to individual subnets that have a /24 or shorter unicast prefix, or\n   it
    might choose some other method.\n   Organizations with a prefix length longer
    than 24 do not receive any\n   multicast address space from this mechanism; in
    such cases, another\n   mechanism must be used.\n   Compared to GLOP, an AS will
    receive more address space via this\n   mechanism if it has more than a /16 for
    unicast space.  An AS will\n   receive less address space than it does from GLOP
    if it has less than\n   a /16.\n   The organization that is assigned a UBM address
    can be determined by\n   taking the multicast address, shifting it left by 8 bits,
    and\n   identifying who has been assigned the address space covering the\n   resulting
    unicast address.\n   The embedded unicast prefix MUST be a global unicast prefix
    (i.e., no\n   loopback, multicast, link-local, or private-use IP address space).\n
    \  In addition, since global unicast addresses are not permanently\n   assigned,
    UBM addresses MUST NOT be hard-coded in applications.\n"

  - "4.  Examples\n   The following are a few examples of the structure of unicast-prefix-\n
    \  based multicast addresses.\n   o  Consider an organization that has been assigned
    the global unicast\n      address space 192.0.2.0/24.  This means that organization
    can use\n      the global multicast address 234.192.0.2 without coordinating with\n
    \     any other entity.  Someone who sees this multicast address and\n      wants
    to find who is using it can mentally shift the address left\n      by 8 bits to
    get 192.0.2.0, and can then look up who has been\n      assigned unicast address
    space that includes that address.\n   o  Consider an organization that has been
    assigned a larger address\n      space, x.y.0.0/16.  This organization can use
    the global multicast\n      address space 234.x.y.0/24 without coordinating with
    any other\n      entity, and can assign addresses within this space by any\n      mechanism
    the organization wishes.  Someone who sees a multicast\n      address (say) 234.x.y.10
    and wants to find who is using it can\n      mentally shift the address left by
    8 bits to get x.y.10.0, and can\n      then look up who has been assigned unicast
    address space that\n      includes that address.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The same well-known intra-domain security techniques
    can be applied\n   as with GLOP.  Furthermore, when dynamic allocation is used
    within a\n   prefix, the approach described here may have the effect of reduced\n
    \  exposure to denial-of-service attacks, since the topological area\n   within
    which nodes compete for addresses within the same prefix is\n   reduced from an
    entire AS to only within an individual organization\n   or an even smaller area.\n"
