  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document examines a wide range of conferencing requirements\
    \ for\n   tightly coupled SIP (RFC 3261 [2]) conferencing.\n   The requirements\
    \ are grouped by subjects in various areas allowing\n   solutions to progress\
    \ in parallel.\n   Separate documents will map the requirements to existing protocol\n\
    \   primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce new\n   protocols\
    \ as needed.\n   Together, these documents will provide a guide for building\n\
    \   interoperable SIP conferencing applications.\n   The terms \"MAY\", \"SHOULD\"\
    , and \"MUST\" are to be interpreted as\n   described in RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 2.  An Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  An Overview\n   A SIP conference is an association of SIP user agents (i.e.,\n\
    \   conference participants) with a central point (i.e., a conference\n   focus),\
    \ where the focus has direct peer-wise relationships with the\n   participants\
    \ by maintaining a separate SIP dialog with each.\n   The focus is a SIP user\
    \ agent that has abilities to host SIP\n   conferences including their creation,\
    \ maintenance, and manipulation\n   using SIP call control means and potentially\
    \ other non-SIP means.\n   In this tightly coupled model, the SIP conference graph\
    \ is always a\n   star.  The conference focus maintains the correlation among\n\
    \   conference's dialogs internally.\n   The conference focus can be implemented\
    \ either by a participant or by\n   a separate application server.\n   In the\
    \ first case, a focus is typically capable of hosting a simple\n   ad hoc conference\
    \ only.  We envision that such basic conference can\n   be established using SIP\
    \ call control primitives only.\n   A dedicated conference server, in addition\
    \ to the basic features,\n   offers richer functionality including simultaneous\
    \ conferences, large\n   scalable conferences, reserved conferences, and managed\
    \ conferences.\n   A conferencing server can support any subset of the advanced\n\
    \   conferencing functions presented in this document.\n   The media graph of\
    \ a SIP conference can be centralized,\n   decentralized, or any combination of\
    \ both, and potentially differ per\n   media type.  In the centralized case, the\
    \ media sessions are\n   established between the focus and each one of the participants.\
    \  In\n   the de-centralized (i.e., distributed) case, the media graph is a\n\
    \   (multicast or multi-unicast) mesh among the participants.\n   Consequently,\
    \ the media processing (e.g., mixing) can be performed\n   either by the focus\
    \ alone or by the participants.\n   Conference participants and third parties\
    \ can have different roles\n   and privileges in a certain conference.  For example,\
    \ conferencing\n   policy can state that the rights to disconnect from and to\
    \ invite to\n   a conference are limited to the conference chair only.\n   Throughout\
    \ the document, by conference policies we mean a set of\n   parameters and rules\
    \ (e.g., maximum number of participants, needs\n   chair-person supervision or\
    \ not, password protected or not, duration,\n   or a way of media mixing) that\
    \ are defined at the onset of a\n   conference.  Typically, conference policies\
    \ would be specified by a\n   conference creator and need special privileges to\
    \ be manipulated.\n   Throughout the document, by a conference state we mean a\
    \ set of\n   information describing the conference in progress.  This includes\n\
    \   participants' information (such as dialog identifiers), media\n   sessions\
    \ in progress, the current loudest speaker, the current chair,\n   etc.\n"

    \ these functions by automata MUST be defined.\n   REQ-1: Discovery of a location\

    \ or a participant.  It is expected that\n   conferences will be governed by a\
    \ set of authorization rules defined\n   as a part of the conference policy. \
    \ In order for the conference\n   policy to be implemented, the focus needs to\
    \ be able to authenticate\n   potential participants.  Normal SIP mechanisms including\
    \ Digest\n   authentication and certificates can be used [2].  These conference-\n\
    \   specific security requirements will be discussed in detail in the\n   protocol\
    \ documents.\n   Conferencing also has privacy implications.  Some of these are\n\
    \   discussed in this document.  Standard SIP mechanisms for a user agent\n  \
