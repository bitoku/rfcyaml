- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Time zone information serves as a basic protocol element in\n  \
    \ protocols, such as the calendaring suite and DHCP.  The Time Zone\n   (TZ) Database\
    \ specifies the indices used in various protocols, as\n   well as their semantic\
    \ meanings, for all localities throughout the\n   world.  This database has been\
    \ meticulously maintained and\n   distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers,\
    \ coordinated by a\n   single volunteer who is now planning to retire.  This memo\
    \ specifies\n   procedures involved with maintenance of the TZ database and\n\
    \   associated code, including how to submit proposed updates, how\n   decisions\
    \ for inclusion of those updates are made, and the selection\n   of a designated\
    \ expert by and for the time zone community.  The\n   intent of this memo is,\
    \ to the extent possible, to document existing\n   practice and provide a means\
    \ to ease succession of the database\n   maintainers.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has specified several standards that make use of\
    \ time zone\n   information.  Time zone names are used in DHCP to configure devices\n\
    \   with correct local time [RFC4833].  Time zone names can appear in the\n  \
    \ TZID field of calendaring VEVENTs [RFC5545].  The normative reference\n   for\
    \ these values is the TZ Database [TZDB].  From the early 1980s\n   through 2011,\
    \ that database, which has been in use on nearly all UNIX\n   systems, Java systems,\
    \ and other sorts of systems, was hosted at the\n   U.S. National Institutes of\
    \ Health (NIH).  The database consists of\n   both historic and current entries\
    \ for geographies throughout the\n   world.  Associated with the database is a\
    \ reference implementation of\n   ISO/IEC 9899 C [ISO9899C] and IEEE 1003.1 [IEEE1003.1]\
    \ POSIX time\n   functions that can be used to convert time values.\n   The database\
    \ was previously maintained by volunteers who participated\n   in the <tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov>\
    \ mailing list that was also hosted at\n   the NIH.  The database itself is updated\
    \ approximately twenty times\n   per year, depending on the year, based on information\
    \ these experts\n   provide to the maintainer.  Arthur David Olson has maintained\
    \ the\n   database, coordinated the mailing list, and provided a release\n   platform\
    \ since the database's inception.  With his retirement now\n   approaching, it\
    \ is necessary to provide a means for this good work to\n   continue.\n   The\
    \ time zone community has requested that the IETF adopt the ongoing\n   maintenance\
    \ of the Time Zone Database.  The time zone community would\n   like the IETF\
    \ to maintain it in a consistent fashion to its\n   administration of the Internet\
    \ protocol parameters and values.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority):  For purposes\
    \ of this\n      RFC, IANA is a role, not an organization.  The IANA Considerations\n\
    \      defined in this RFC will be provided by the Internet Corporation\n    \
    \  for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in accordance with the\n      IETF-ICANN\
    \ \"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Technical Work\n      of the Internet\
    \ Assigned Numbers Authority\", which was signed and\n      ratified in March\
    \ of 2000[RFC2860].\n   TZ Database:  The Time Zone Database, sometimes referred\
    \ to as the\n      \"Olson Database\".  This database consists of information\
    \ about\n      offsets from UTC for different localities, including daylight\n\
    \      saving time (DST) transition information.\n   TZ Coordinator:  The person\
    \ or people who maintain and manage release\n      of the TZ Database.  The TZ\
    \ Coordinator also has responsibility\n      for managing the TZ mailing list.\
    \  The TZ Coordinator is an IANA\n      Designated Expert, as defined in Section\
    \ 3.2 of [RFC5226], except\n      as regards to appeals, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5 of this document.\n      Roughly speaking, this means that the IESG will choose\
    \ one or more\n      experts to manage the TZ database, code, and mailing list.\
    \  The TZ\n      Coordinator will also lead work to develop appropriate service\n\
    \      metrics.  There SHALL be a single lead individual and at least one\n  \
    \    backup individual for this function.\n   TZ mailing list:  The forum where\
    \ matters relating to the TZ database\n      and supporting code are discussed.\n\
    \   The rest of this document specifies the following:\n   1.  Transferring and\
    \ maintenance of the TZ mailing list;\n   2.  Procedures for selecting a technical\
    \ expert who will play the\n       role of TZ Coordinator and release manager\
    \ for the TZ database;\n   3.  Procedures for updating the TZ database;\n   4.\
    \  Maintenance and ownership of reference code; and\n   5.  Ownership of the database.\n"
- title: 2.  The TZ Mailing List
  contents:
  - "2.  The TZ Mailing List\n   For many years, the TZ mailing list has been the\
    \ forum where\n   discussion of changes to the TZ database and support files would\
    \ take\n   place.  In addition, the TZ mailing list is used to announce releases\n\
    \   of the database.  Currently, the TZ mailing list is administered by\n   the\
    \ TZ Coordinator.\n   This list membership, formerly at the NIH, has been transitioned\
    \ to\n   the IANA mail server.  Its address, moving forward, is <tz@iana.org>.\n\
    \   Subscriptions are processed at\n   <https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz/>.\
    \  The TZ Coordinator will\n   continue to manage the list.  While the TZ Coordinator\
    \ may establish\n   other rules of governance for the list, members of that list\
    \ will be\n   informed that a condition of participating on the list is that all\n\
    \   contributions to the list are released to the public domain, and that\n  \
    \ by placing their contribution in the public domain, contributors\n   waive forever\
    \ any intellectual property claims.\n   The list will be used just as it has been:\
    \ to learn of, discuss, and\n   confirm TZ definition changes, as well as to serve\
    \ as an announcement\n   list for new versions of the database.\n"
- title: 3.  Making Updates to the TZ Database
  contents:
  - "3.  Making Updates to the TZ Database\n   Updates to the TZ database are made\
    \ by the TZ Coordinator in\n   consultation with the TZ mailing list.  The TZ\
    \ Coordinator is\n   empowered to decide, as the designated expert, appropriate\
    \ changes,\n   but SHOULD take into account views expressed on the mailing list.\n\
    \   The TZ Coordinator will also decide the timing of database releases.\n   Today,\
    \ the release itself consists of several archive files that are\n   downloaded\
    \ from a well-known location.\n   Moving forward, the TZ database, supporting\
    \ code, and any appropriate\n   supporting information SHOULD be cryptographically\
    \ signed prior to\n   release using well known public keys, along with any appropriate\n\
    \   supporting information and distributed from\n   <http://www.iana.org/time-zones>.\n\
    \   The criteria for updates to the database include the following:\n   1.  New\
    \ TZ names (e.g., locations) are only to be created when the\n       scope of\
    \ the region a name was envisioned to cover is no longer\n       accurate.\n \
    \  2.  In order to correct historical inaccuracies, a new TZ name MAY be\n   \
    \    added when it is necessary to indicate what was the consensus\n       view\
    \ at a given time and location.  Such TZ names are usually not\n       added when\
    \ the inaccuracy was prior to 1970.\n   3.  Changes to existing entries SHALL\
    \ reflect the consensus on the\n       ground in the region covered by that entry.\n\
    \   To be clear, the TZ Coordinator SHALL NOT set time zone policy for a\n   region\
    \ but use judgment and whatever available sources exist to\n   assess what the\
    \ average person on street would think the time\n   actually is, or in case of\
    \ historical corrections, was.\n"
- title: 4.  Selecting or Replacing a TZ Coordinator
  contents:
  - "4.  Selecting or Replacing a TZ Coordinator\n   From time to time it will be\
    \ necessary to appoint a new TZ\n   Coordinator.  This could occur for a number\
    \ of reasons:\n   o  The TZ Coordinator is retiring (as Arthur David Olson is)\
    \ or has\n      announced that he or she will be unable to continue to perform\
    \ the\n      function;\n   o  The TZ Coordinator is missing, has become incapacitated,\
    \ or has\n      died; or\n   o  The TZ Coordinator is not performing the function\
    \ in accordance\n      with community wishes.\n   In any of these cases, members\
    \ of the community should raise the\n   issue on the TZ mailing list and attempt\
    \ to reach consensus on a new\n   candidate to fulfill the role of TZ Coordinator.\
    \  If rough consensus\n   cannot be reached easily, the Area Directors of the\
    \ IETF Applications\n   Area should attempt to guide the members of the community\
    \ to rough\n   consensus.  The candidate that is agreed upon by the community\n\
    \   through rough consensus shall be presented to the IESG for\n   confirmation.\
    \  If rough consensus cannot be reached, even with\n   guidance from the Applications\
    \ Area Directors, the IESG shall use\n   whatever means it has at its disposal\
    \ to choose a candidate who in\n   its best judgment will be able to fulfill the\
    \ role of TZ Coordinator.\n"
- title: 5.  Appealing Database Decisions
  contents:
  - "5.  Appealing Database Decisions\n   The TZ Coordinator makes decisions based\
    \ on expertise, as well as\n   with guidance from the TZ mailing list.  If a member\
    \ of the community\n   has a concern with an individual decision made by the TZ\
    \ Coordinator\n   with regard to the TZ database, the individual shall proceed\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   1.  Attempt to resolve the concern directly with the TZ\
    \ Coordinator.\n   2.  If a resolution cannot be reached directly with the TZ\n\
    \       Coordinator, express the concern to the community and attempt to\n   \
    \    achieve rough consensus regarding a resolution on the TZ mailing\n      \
    \ list.  The Area Directors of the IETF Applications Area may at\n       their\
    \ discretion attempt to guide the members of the community to\n       rough consensus.\n\
    \   3.  As a last resort, if a resolution cannot be reached on the TZ\n      \
    \ mailing list, appeal to the IESG for a resolution.  The appellant\n       must\
    \ show that the decision made by the TZ Coordinator (a) was\n       materially\
    \ in error and (b) has caused material harm.  In its\n       deliberations regarding\
    \ an appeal, the IESG shall weigh all the\n       evidence presented to it and\
    \ use its best judgment in determining\n       a resolution.\n"
- title: 6.  Maintenance and Distribution of Reference Code
  contents:
  - "6.  Maintenance and Distribution of Reference Code\n   Currently, the maintainer\
    \ of the TZ database also maintains reference\n   code, most of which is public\
    \ domain.  The reference implementation\n   shall be distributed along with an\
    \ associated cryptographic signature\n   verifiable by a public key.  Several\
    \ files from this software are\n   currently distributed under license.  Where\
    \ they exist, licenses\n   SHALL NOT be changed.\n"
- title: 7.  Database Ownership
  contents:
  - "7.  Database Ownership\n   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution\
    \ or an IETF\n   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated\
    \ work\n   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public\n\
    \   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\n   to\
    \ the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n   Should any\
    \ claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n   the organization\
    \ that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\n   this RFC, under the\
    \ memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\n   currently ICANN, may act in accordance\
    \ with all competent court\n   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN\
    \ or the IETF Trust\n   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution\
    \ to the\n   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that\n   contribution\
    \ or in the TZ Database.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   This section documents the following IANA actions:\n\
    \   o  Assistance on request of the IESG in selection of the TZ\n      Coordinator,\
    \ based on the procedures set forth above.\n   o  Maintenance of a repository\
    \ for the TZ database and associated\n      reference code.  The TZ Coordinator\
    \ SHALL be named by the IESG as\n      described above, and will act as the maintainer\
    \ of the database\n      and code, as described above.\n   o  Creation of appropriate\
    \ access for the TZ Coordinator to maintain\n      the database, as well as necessary\
    \ tooling that may be required,\n      so long as no direct software costs are\
    \ incurred.\n   o  Establishment of security of the system upon which the database\n\
    \      resides.  Both current and historical versions of the database\n      will\
    \ be stored and distributed via HTTP/HTTPS.\n   o  Maintenance of a cryptographic\
    \ private key that is used to sign\n      the database and that will survive a\
    \ change of TZ Coordinator.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The distribution of the database is currently\
    \ not secured.  This memo\n   states that the TZ database SHOULD be distributed\
    \ with a valid\n   cryptographic signature moving forward.\n"
