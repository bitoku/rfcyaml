    \   questions (FAQs) posed by IETF meeting attendees regarding travel\n   logistics\
    \ and local information.  It is intended to assist those who\n   are willing to\
    \ provide local information, so that if they wish to\n   pre-populate answers\
    \ to some or all of these questions either in the\n   IETF wiki or a meeting-specific\
    \ site, they have a reasonably complete\n   list of ideas to draw from.  It is\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IETF attendees come from all over the world.  The typical\
    \ IETF\n   meeting has representatives from over 50 countries.  It is quite\n\
    \   likely that a large portion of the participants in any given IETF are\n  \
    \ newcomers to the specific location where it is being held or even to\n   the\
    \ country or region itself.  As a result, they are going to have\n   questions\
    \ regarding their personal travel needs and logistics that\n   may only be answerable\
    \ by someone who has been to the area before,\n   someone who lives there, and/or\
    \ someone who speaks the local\n   language.\n   The IETF, the Secretariat, and\
    \ any local host organizations\n   responsible for the logistics of making IETF\
    \ meetings happen are not\n   travel agencies, but they often can and do assist\
    \ with identifying\n   and hosting the common information that most attendees\
    \ wish to have\n   while they are planning their trip.  This document attempts\
    \ to cover\n   the most commonly asked questions and categories for information.\n\
    \   This document is not intended to provide answers to these questions\n   for\
    \ every possible location in which IETF meetings may be held.\n   Rather, it is\
    \ intended to provide a set of FAQs for use by the hosts\n   and others who have\
    \ experience with the area where the event is being\n   held, so that questions\
    \ and answers can be handled efficiently,\n   rather than waiting until someone\
    \ sends an email to the meeting\n   attendees mailing list in the days leading\
    \ up to the meeting.\n"
- title: 2.  Why is this document necessary?
  contents:
  - "2.  Why is this document necessary?\n   In reading this document, one may ask,\
    \ \"Isn't that why search engines\n   and travel sites exist?\"  Although we can\
    \ sometimes find what we're\n   looking for with search engines, that results\
    \ in hundreds of people\n   spending time searching, which is not very efficient.\
    \  In addition,\n   despite the widely held belief that if it is published on\
    \ the\n   Internet, it must be true, sometimes the information that is\n   available\
    \ is either inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date, so it may\n   be less reliable\
    \ than firsthand information from someone who has been\n   there.  Also, no matter\
    \ how much online translation has improved,\n   some of the most useful local\
    \ travel sites may be difficult for non-\n   native speakers to navigate and find\
    \ information, because navigation\n   buttons, graphics, and other active content\
    \ are typically not\n   machine-translatable, and non-native speakers may not\
    \ realize when\n   machine translation is inaccurate in a critical way.  Lastly,\
    \ while\n   the companies that serve as hosts for IETF meetings often have\n \
    \  participants attending IETF, the folks who are responsible for\n   handling\
    \ the details of hosting an IETF may not be regular attendees.\n   Therefore,\
    \ this document, especially Section 3, is intended to be\n   something that can\
    \ be provided to host event organizers that may not\n   have much familiarity\
    \ with the IETF, so that they have a better sense\n   of the information that\
    \ attendees will find helpful.\n   The format of this document was chosen so that\
    \ it captures the FAQs,\n   but usually not their answers.  This is because IETF\
    \ RFCs are\n   typically static and infrequently updated, which does not make\
    \ them a\n   particularly suitable format to contain location-specific\n   information.\
    \  The questions found in this document are a result of\n   informal review of\
    \ the attendees mailing lists from past meetings and\n   feedback from many individuals;\
    \ they are believed to be reasonably\n   static from one meeting to the next.\
    \  This document is not\n   necessarily all-inclusive, but it should serve as\
    \ a reasonable\n   baseline such that a static format like an RFC is appropriate.\
    \  It is\n   likely that this RFC will need to be revised periodically -- a clue\n\
    \   that this is necessary will be when, over the course of multiple\n   meetings,\
    \ multiple additional questions that are not covered by this\n   document repeatedly\
    \ surface on the attendees mailing list and thus\n   become FAQs.\n   The answers\
    \ to this document's questions are expected to be stored in\n   a location that\
    \ is easily updated by multiple parties, so that site-\n   specific information\
    \ can be refined and updated as often as\n   necessary, thereby creating a living\
    \ document.  There are several\n   options as to where to store this location-specific\
    \ living document.\n   For some past IETF meetings, the hosting organization or\
    \ an\n   individual [HIROSHIMA] has set up a special website.  The best recent\n\
    \   examples of these, in terms of the information provided, are\n   www.ietf75.se\
    \ and ietf71.comcast.net.  Unfortunately, these types of\n   sites are not maintained\
    \ indefinitely once the IETF meeting for which\n   they were set up has concluded,\
    \ so the only way to review them as\n   examples is to use the Internet Wayback\
    \ Machine [WEBARCHIVE].  Such a\n   website has been a source of much additional\
    \ information about the\n   location and is always quite helpful.  If the host\
    \ decides to set up\n   a site like this, the hope is that this document will\
    \ provide\n   guidance as to the type of information with which to populate such\
    \ a\n   site.  However, it is by no means a requirement that the host set up\n\
    \   an external website.  Further, not every IETF meeting has a local\n   host,\
    \ or even a host at all.  In these cases, the need for the same\n   set of information\
    \ is not lessened, but the IETF will be more reliant\n   on the willingness of\
    \ those with experience in the area where the\n   meeting will be held to share\
    \ the benefit of that experience with\n   others.  The IETF has provided a hosted\
    \ wiki [WIKI] that can simply\n   be populated with the same sorts of information.\
    \  This has the added\n   benefit of having a single location where additional\
    \ information can\n   be provided by experienced travelers, locals, and host\n\
    \   representatives alike; it is therefore not completely reliant on the\n   host.\
    \  In the case where the IETF-hosted wiki is to be used, this\n   document may\
    \ serve as a framework of categories that could be pre-\n   built when the site-specific\
    \ page is set up, so that others can begin\n   populating the information.\n"
- title: 3.  Helpful Information
  contents:
  - "3.  Helpful Information\n   There are a number of general categories of information\
    \ listed below.\n   Some sections, such as Sections 3.1 and 3.2, contain information\n\
    \   necessary for travel; the rest can be considered nice to have.  All\n   of\
    \ it comes from actual FAQs from the attendees mailing lists.\n   Much of the\
    \ needed information may already be available in another\n   form online.  There\
    \ is no need to reproduce information that can be\n   found on external websites,\
    \ so simply providing pointers to\n   information already available in other locations\
    \ is quite\n   appropriate.  However, it is very helpful if some validation and\n\
    \   vetting of the provided information is performed in order to avoid\n   outdated\
    \ or inaccurate information.  Additionally, because this is a\n   static and location-agnostic\
    \ document, it's quite likely that some\n   questions are either irrelevant or\
    \ confusing for some locations.\n   Therefore, \"not really relevant here\" and\
    \ \"we don't know\" may be\n   valid answers to some of these questions.  In those\
    \ cases, it's\n   better to say this explicitly rather than to simply omit the\
    \ section,\n   as this will confirm that the information was not simply omitted.\n\
    \   The main thing to remember when providing information in these\n   categories\
    \ is that those traveling to the event have not been there\n   before, so one\
    \ should not assume a high level of background knowledge\n   about the area, its\
    \ customs, etc.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Travel
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Travel\n   o  Recommended airport(s) for domestic and international connections.\n\
    \      To avoid confusion, include the appropriate International Air\n      Transport\
    \ Association (IATA) airport code(s) whenever possible.\n   o  Non-flight options\
    \ to get to the city where the meeting is being\n      held (e.g., if there are\
    \ convenient rail travel options).\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Transit between the Airport or Train Station and Primary Hotels
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Transit between the Airport or Train Station and Primary Hotels\n   Information\
    \ in this section is especially critical if the airport is\n   significantly distant\
    \ from the venue or use of a taxi is otherwise\n   impractical or not recommended\
    \ (e.g., if attendees must use a train\n   or long-distance bus to get to the\
    \ venue from the airport).  If train\n   travel options are provided as an alternative\
    \ to flying, it is\n   recommended that the list below be provided for those options\
    \ as well\n   (e.g., transit between the train station and primary hotel).\n \
    \  o  Estimated travel time.  This is also important for return travel\n     \
    \ from the venue to the airport.  It is worth noting any\n      recommendations\
    \ about leaving extra time if airport security and\n      check-in is always busy\
    \ or if there will be significant\n      differences in travel time due to rush\
    \ hour traffic.\n   o  Shuttles (if applicable).\n   o  Arranging transit directly\
    \ with the hotel (if applicable).  Hotels\n      sometimes provide car service\
    \ or are willing to pay taxi bills\n      upon your arrival so that the charges\
    \ can be added to the hotel\n      bill instead of requiring local currency. \
    \ It is helpful to know\n      in advance if this is common or uncommon in the\
    \ local area.\n"

    \ fares\n   o  Description of \"official\" taxis if appropriate\n   o  Links to\
    \ websites or phone numbers for remote/pre-booking taxis\n   o  How to find the\
    \ taxi stand at the airport/train station\n   o  Printable local-language address\
    \ card to show taxi driver in case\n      of language barrier\n   o  Ride sharing\

- title: 3.1.1.2.  Mass Transit
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.2.  Mass Transit\n   Navigating an unfamiliar mass transit system can be\
    \ challenging.\n   Things that seem obvious to locals may not be obvious to visitors.\n\
    \   o  English map\n   o  How and where to purchase farecards/tokens\n   o  How\
    \ to use tickets/tokens (where to insert them, how to get them\n      stamped,\
    \ how to transfer, etc.)\n   o  How trains/buses are labeled and how to identify\
    \ the destination\n      of a particular train/bus\n   o  The general frequency\
    \ of service -- in particular, whether one\n      should just go to the station\
    \ or consult a schedule first\n   o  Which transit system to use for which destination\
    \ (when there are\n      multiple transit systems in the area)\n   o  Nearby stations\
    \ and how to identify a station entrance (common\n      logo, color, etc.)\n \
    \  o  It may be helpful to advise when things are not commonly labeled\n     \
    \ in a western character set (e.g., place signs) and provide\n      pictures or\
    \ unicode text representations of the signage as it will\n      appear.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Getting Around near the Conference Venue
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Getting Around near the Conference Venue\n   The same information relevant\
    \ for airport transit will likely be\n   relevant here, including taxi and mass\
    \ transit information.  If\n   possible, walking directions between the conference\
    \ venue and the\n   hotel(s) should be provided if the venue is not co-located\
    \ with the\n   hotel.\n   Additionally, it is helpful to note if having a vehicle\
    \ available\n   (rental or personal car) is a help or a hindrance in getting around\n\
    \   in the local area.  For example, it may not be recommended to try to\n   drive\
    \ in the area near the conference venue due to:\n   o  Parking availability and\
    \ costs\n   o  Congestion charges and other restrictions on when and where one\n\
    \      can drive\n   o  Traffic\n"

    \  colleagues, either related to IETF work, other shop talk, or anything\n   *but*\
    \ shop talk.  During IETF's lunch break, approximately 1000\n   people are simultaneously\
    \ looking for reasonably priced lunch\n   options, with time frames ranging from\
    \ \"grab and go\" for a working\n   lunch to 75 minutes for a sit-down meal. \
    \ When meetings have\n   concluded for the day, the wide variety of attendees\
    \ means that\n   people are looking for all types of food, all price ranges, and\n\
    \   atmospheres ranging from a place suitable for an in-depth\n   conversation\
    \ to a table at the bar.  The more information that is\n   available about the\
    \ food and drink options nearby, the better.  This\n   information is especially\
    \ helpful during the first few days of the\n   conference, because the number\

    \ IETFers\n      to try to hold a \"soccer BoF\" -- a pick-up soccer game sometime\n\
    \      during the week of IETF.  Thus, a field appropriate for soccer in\n   \
    \   close proximity to the venue is useful information to have.\n   o  Running/walking\

  - "3.7.  Tourism and Souvenirs\n   While this is certainly not necessary information\
    \ for the primary\n   goal of an IETF attendee, many attendees earmark a day or\
    \ two on\n   either side of the conference for sightseeing, so this is an\n  \
    \ opportunity to highlight local attractions.  Links to sites\n   containing information\
    \ about walking tours, local tourist attractions\n   and the like are certainly\
    \ appreciated.  If there are events\n   scheduled adjacent to IETF such as music\
    \ or food festivals, cultural\n   events, etc., attendees are happy to hear about\
    \ these events as well.\n   Additionally, many attendees choose to purchase souvenirs\
    \ as gifts or\n   for personal use.  In addition to the standard \"tourist-trap\"\
    \ items\n   such as t-shirts and knick-knacks, many attendees look for items that\n\
    \   are locally crafted, local specialties, or otherwise significant to\n   the\
    \ local area and culture.  This is another topic that can be\n   highlighted in\
    \ the information provided to attendees.\n"
