- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Previously, RFCs (e.g., [RFC4844]) contained a number of\
    \ elements\n   that were there for historical, practical, and legal reasons. \
    \ They\n   also contained boilerplate material to clearly indicate the status\
    \ of\n   the document and possibly contained \"Notes\" to indicate how the\n \
    \  document interacts with IETF Standards-Track documents.\n   As the RFC Series\
    \ has evolved over the years, there has been\n   increasing concern over appropriate\
    \ labeling of the publications to\n   make clear the status of each RFC and the\
    \ status of the work it\n   describes.  Chiefly, there is a requirement that RFCs\
    \ published as\n   part of the IETF's review process not be easily confused with\
    \ RFCs\n   that may have had a very different review and approval process.\n \
    \  Various adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving\n   text\
    \ of \"Notes\" included in the published RFC.\n   With the definition of the different\
    \ RFC streams [RFC4844], it is\n   appropriate to formalize the definition of\
    \ the various pieces of\n   standard RFC boilerplate and introduce some adjustments\
    \ to ensure\n   better clarity of expression of document status, aligned with\
    \ the\n   review and approval processes defined for each stream.\n   This memo\
    \ identifies and describes the common elements of RFC\n   boilerplate structure.\
    \  It describes the content required for each\n   kind of information.  Details\
    \ of the exact textual and layout\n   requirements are left to a web page maintained\
    \ by the IAB, with due\n   consultation with the community, for ease of maintenance.\
    \  This\n   document obsoletes [RFC5741].\n   The changes introduced by this memo\
    \ should be implemented as soon as\n   practically possible after the document\
    \ has been approved for\n   publication.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards\n   Users of RFCs should be aware that\
    \ while all Internet Standards-\n   related documents are published as RFCs, not\
    \ all RFCs are Internet\n   Standards-related documents.\n   The IETF is responsible\
    \ for maintaining the Internet Standards\n   Process, which includes the requirements\
    \ for developing, reviewing,\n   and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs. \
    \ The IETF also produces\n   non-Standards-Track documents (Informational, Experimental,\
    \ and\n   Historic).  All documents published as part of the IETF Stream are\n\
    \   reviewed by the appropriate IETF bodies.\n   Documents published in streams\
    \ other than the IETF stream are not\n   generally reviewed by the IETF for such\
    \ things as security,\n   congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with\
    \ deployed\n   protocols.  They have also not been subject to approval by the\n\
    \   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), including an IETF-wide\n   last\
    \ call.  Therefore, the IETF disclaims, for any of the non-IETF\n   stream documents,\
    \ any knowledge of the fitness of those RFCs for any\n   purpose.\n   Refer to\
    \ [RFC2026], [RFC5742], [RFC4844], [RFC6410], and [RFC7127]\n   and their successors\
    \ for current details of the IETF process and RFC\n   streams.\n"
- title: 3.  RFC Structural Elements
  contents:
  - "3.  RFC Structural Elements\n   This section describes the elements that are\
    \ commonly found in RFCs\n   published today.  This document specifies information\
    \ that is\n   required in these publications.  Exact specification of the textual\n\
    \   values required therein are provided by an IAB web page\n   (https://www.iab.org/documents/headers-boilerplate).\n\
    \   As noted above, this web page is maintained by the IAB with due\n   consultation\
    \ with the community.  Following such consultation, if the\n   IAB decides to\
    \ make any changes to this material, the changes will be\n   announced in a similar\
    \ fashion to other IAB statements.  The initial\n   text to be used in that web\
    \ page is included in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 3.1.  The Title Page Header
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Title Page Header\n   The information at the front of the RFC includes\
    \ the name and\n   affiliation of the authors as well as the RFC publication month\
    \ and\n   year.\n   There is a set of additional information that is needed at\
    \ the front\n   of the RFC.  Historically, this has been presented with the\n\
    \   information below in a left hand column, and the author-related\n   information\
    \ described above in the right.\n   <document source>  This describes the area\
    \ where the work originates.\n      Historically, all RFCs were labeled \"Network\
    \ Working Group\".\n      Network Working Group refers to the original version\
    \ of today's\n      IETF when people from the original set of ARPANET sites and\n\
    \      whomever else was interested -- the meetings were open -- got\n      together\
    \ to discuss, design, and document proposed protocols\n      [RFC3].  Here, we\
    \ obsolete the term \"Network Working Group\" in\n      order to indicate the\
    \ originating stream.\n      The <document source> is the name of the RFC stream,\
    \ as defined in\n      [RFC4844] and its successors.  At the time of this publication,\n\
    \      the streams, and therefore the possible entries are:\n      *  Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force\n      *  Internet Architecture Board\n      *  Internet\
    \ Research Task Force\n      *  Independent Submission\n   Request for Comments:\
    \  <RFC number>  This indicates the RFC number,\n      assigned by the RFC Editor\
    \ upon publication of the document.  This\n      element is unchanged.\n   <subseries\
    \ ID> <subseries number>  Some document categories are also\n      labeled as\
    \ a subseries of RFCs.  These elements appear as\n      appropriate for such categories,\
    \ indicating the subseries and the\n      documents number within that series.\
    \  Currently, there are\n      subseries for BCPs [RFC2026] and STDs [RFC1311].\
    \  These subseries\n      numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For example, when\
    \ a new RFC\n      obsoletes or updates an old one, the same subseries number\
    \ is\n      used.  Also, several RFCs may be assigned the same subseries\n   \
    \   number: a single STD, for example, may be composed of several\n      RFCs,\
    \ each of which will bear the same STD number.  This element\n      is unchanged.\n\
    \   [<RFC relation>:<RFC number[s]>]  Some relations between RFCs in the\n   \
    \   series are explicitly noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new\n     \
    \ RFC may update one or more earlier RFCs.  Currently two\n      relationships\
    \ are defined: \"Updates\" and \"Obsoletes\" [RFC7322].\n      Variants like \"\
    Obsoleted by\" are also used (e.g, in [RFC5143]).\n      Other types of relationships\
    \ may be defined by the RFC Editor and\n      may appear in future RFCs.\n   Category:\
    \ <category>  This indicates the initial RFC document\n      category of the publication.\
    \  These are defined in [RFC2026].\n      Currently, this is always one of: Standards\
    \ Track, Best Current\n      Practice, Experimental, Informational, or Historic.\
    \  This element\n      is unchanged.\n"
- title: 3.2.  The Status of This Memo
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The Status of This Memo\n   The \"Status of This Memo\" describes the category\
    \ of the RFC,\n   including the distribution statement.\n   The \"Status of This\
    \ Memo\" will start with a single sentence\n   describing the status.  It will\
    \ also include a statement describing\n   the stream-specific review of the material\
    \ (which is stream\n   dependent).  This is an important component of status,\
    \ insofar as it\n   clarifies the breadth and depth of review, and gives the reader\
    \ an\n   understanding of how to consider its content.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Paragraph 1
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Paragraph 1\n   The first paragraph of the \"Status of This Memo\" section\
    \ contains a\n   single sentence, clearly standing out.  The sentence will clearly\n\
    \   identify the stream-specific status of the document.  The text to be\n   used\
    \ is defined by the stream, with a review for clarity by the IAB\n   and RFC Series\
    \ Editor.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Paragraph 2
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Paragraph 2\n   The second paragraph of the \"Status of This Memo\" will\
    \ include a\n   paragraph describing the type of review and exposure the document\
    \ has\n   received.  This is defined on a per-stream basis, subject to general\n\
    \   review and oversight by the RFC Editor and IAB.  The IAB defines a\n   specific\
    \ structure defined to ensure there is clarity about review\n   processes and\
    \ document types.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Paragraph 3
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Paragraph 3\n   The boilerplate ends with a reference to where further\
    \ relevant\n   information can be found.  This information may include, subject\
    \ to\n   the RFC Editor's discretion, information about whether the RFC has\n\
    \   been updated or obsoleted, the RFC's origin, a listing of possible\n   errata,\
    \ information about how to provide feedback and suggestion, and\n   information\
    \ on how to submit errata as described in [ERRATA].  The\n   exact wording and\
    \ URL is subject to change (at the RFC Editor's\n   discretion), but the current\
    \ text is:\n      Information about the current status of this document, any errata,\n\
    \      and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at\n      http://www.rfc-editor.org/<static-path>/rfc<rfc-no>.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Noteworthy
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Noteworthy\n   Note that the text in paragraph 1 and 2 of the boilerplate\
    \ indicate\n   the initial status of a document.  During their lifetime, documents\n\
    \   can change status to, for example, Historic.  This cannot be\n   reflected\
    \ in the document itself and will need be reflected in the\n   information referred\
    \ to in Section 5.\n"
- title: 4.  Additional Notes
  contents:
  - "4.  Additional Notes\n   Exceptionally, a review and publication process may\
    \ prescribe\n   additional notes that will appear as labeled notes after the\n\
    \   \"Abstract\".\n   This is no longer a common feature of recent RFCs.  It is\
    \ the goal of\n   this document to continue to ensure that the overall RFC structure\
    \ is\n   adequately clear so that such notes are unnecessary or (at least)\n \
    \  truly exceptional.\n"
- title: 5.  Other Structural Information in RFCs
  contents:
  - "5.  Other Structural Information in RFCs\n   RFCs contain other structural informational\
    \ elements.  The RFC Editor\n   is responsible for the positioning and layout\
    \ of these structural\n   elements.  Note also that new elements may be introduced\
    \ or obsoleted\n   using a process consistent with [RFC4844].  These additions\
    \ may or\n   may not require documentation in an RFC.\n   Currently, the following\
    \ structural information is available in RFCs:\n   Copyright Notice:  A copyright\
    \ notice with a reference to BCP 78\n      [BCP78] and an Intellectual Property\
    \ statement referring to BCP 78\n      and BCP 79 [BCP79].  The content of these\
    \ statements are defined\n      by those BCPs.\n   ISSN:  The International Standard\
    \ Serial Number [ISO.3297.2007]:\n      ISSN 2070-1721.  The ISSN uniquely identifies\

    \ is published.\n      The ISSN itself has no significance other than the unique\n\
    \      identification of a serial publication.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document tries to clarify the descriptions\
    \ of the status of an\n   RFC.  Misunderstanding the status of a memo could cause\n\
    \   interoperability problems, hence security and stability problems.\n"
- title: 7.  RFC Editor Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  RFC Editor Considerations\n   The RFC Editor is responsible for maintaining\
    \ the consistency of the\n   RFC series.  To that end, the RFC Editor maintains\
    \ an \"RFC Style\n   Guide\" [RFC7322].  In this memo, we mention a few explicit\
    \ structural\n   elements that the RFC Editor needs to maintain.  The conventions\
    \ for\n   the content and use of all current and future elements are documented\n\
    \   in the style guide.\n   Adding a reference to the stream in the header of\
    \ RFCs is only one\n   method for clarifying from which stream an RFC originated.\
    \  The RFC\n   Editor is encouraged to add such indication in, for example, indices\n\

    \ (at the\n   time of publication, at http://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/status-\n\
    \   memos.txt).  When in conflict, the following sections are\n   authoritative.\n"
- title: A.2.1.  First Paragraph
  contents:
  - "A.2.1.  First Paragraph\n   The following are the approved texts for use in the\
    \ first paragraph\n   of the \"Status of This Memo\" portion of an RFC.  See Section\
    \ 3.3 of\n   RFC 7841.\n   For 'Standards Track' documents:  \"This is an Internet\

- title: A.2.2.  Second Paragraph
  contents:
  - "A.2.2.  Second Paragraph\n   See Section 3.4 of RFC 7841.\n   The second paragraph\
    \ may include some text that is specific to the\n   initial document category.\
    \  When a document is Experimental or\n   Historic, the second paragraph opens\
    \ with:\n   Experimental:  \"This document defines an Experimental Protocol for\n\
    \      the Internet community.\"\n   Historic:  \"This document defines a Historic\
    \ Document for the\n      Internet community.\"\n   The text that follows is stream\
    \ dependent -- these are initial values\n   and may be updated by stream definition\
    \ document updates and recorded\n   by the IAB on the web page.\n   IETF Stream:\
    \  \"This document is a product of the Internet Engineering\n      Task Force\
    \ (IETF).\"\n      If there has been an IETF consensus call per IETF process,\
    \ this\n      additional text should be added: \"It represents the consensus of\n\
    \      the IETF community.  It has received public review and has been\n     \
    \ approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering\n      Group (IESG).\"\
    \  If there has not been such a consensus call, then\n      this simply reads:\
    \ \"It has been approved for publication by the\n      Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG).\"\n   IAB Stream:  \"This document is a product of the Internet\
    \ Architecture\n      Board (IAB), and represents information that the IAB has\
    \ deemed\n      valuable to provide for permanent record.\"\n      If the document\
    \ represents IAB consensus, this additional text\n      should be added: \"It\
    \ represents the consensus of the Internet\n      Architecture Board (IAB).\"\n\
    \   IRTF Stream:  \"This document is a product of the Internet Research\n    \
    \  Task Force (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-\n      related\
    \ research and development activities.  These results might\n      not be suitable\
    \ for deployment.\"\n      In addition, a sentence indicating the consensus base\
    \ within the\n      IRTF may be added: \"This RFC represents the consensus of\
    \ the\n      <insert_name> Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force\n\

    \  \"This is a contribution to the RFC\n      Series, independently of any other\
    \ RFC stream.  The RFC Editor has\n      chosen to publish this document at its\
    \ discretion and makes no\n      statement about its value for implementation\
    \ or deployment.\"\n   For non-IETF stream documents, a reference to Section 2\
    \ of this RFC\n   is added with the following sentence: \"Documents approved for\n\
    \   publication by the [stream approver -- currently, one of: \"IAB\",\n   \"\
    IRSG\", or \"RFC Editor\"] are not a candidate for any level of\n   Internet Standard;\
    \ see Section 2 of RFC 7841.\"\n   For IETF stream documents, a similar reference\
    \ is added: \"Further\n   information on (BCPs or Internet Standards) is available\
    \ in Section 2\n   of RFC 7841.\" for BCP and Standard Track documents; \"Not\
    \ all\n   documents approved by the IESG are a candidate for any level of\n  \
