  - "1.  Introduction\n   Certain individual IP addresses and IP address ranges are
    treated\n   specially by network implementations and, consequently, are not\n
    \  suitable for use as unicast addresses.  For example, IPv4 addresses\n   224.0.0.0
    to 239.255.255.255 are multicast addresses [RFC5735], with\n   224.0.0.1 being
    the \"all hosts\" multicast address [RFC1112]\n   [RFC5771].  Another example
    is 127.0.0.1, the IPv4 \"local host\"\n   address [RFC5735].\n   Analogous to
    Special-Use IPv4 Addresses [RFC5735], the Domain Name\n   System (DNS) [RFC1034][RFC1035]
    has its own concept of reserved\n   names, such as \"example.com.\", \"example.net.\",
    and \"example.org.\", or\n   any name falling under the top-level pseudo-domain
    \"invalid.\"\n   [RFC2606].  However, \"Reserved Top Level DNS Names\" [RFC2606]
    does\n   not state whether implementations are expected to treat such names\n
    \  differently, and if so, in what way.\n   This document specifies under what
    circumstances special treatment is\n   appropriate, and in what ways.\n"

  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   When IP multicast was created [RFC1112], implementations
    had to be\n   updated to understand what an IP multicast address means and what
    to\n   do with it.  Adding IP multicast to a networking stack entailed more\n
    \  than merely adding the right routing table entries for those\n   addresses.
    \ Moreover, supporting IP multicast entails some level of\n   commonality that
    is consistent across all conformant hosts,\n   independent of what networks those
    hosts may be connected to.  While\n   it is possible to build a private isolated
    network using whatever\n   valid unicast IP addresses and routing topology one
    chooses\n   (regardless of whether those unicast IP addresses are already in use\n
    \  by other hosts on the public Internet), the IPv4 multicast address\n   224.0.0.1
    is always the \"all hosts\" multicast address, and that's not\n   a local decision.\n
    \  Similarly, if a domain name has special properties that affect the\n   way
    hardware and software implementations handle the name, that apply\n   universally
    regardless of what network the implementation may be\n   connected to, then that
    domain name may be a candidate for having the\n   IETF declare it to be a Special-Use
    Domain Name and specify what\n   special treatment implementations should give
    to that name.  On the\n   other hand, if declaring a given name to be special
    would result in\n   no change to any implementations, then that suggests that
    the name\n   may not be special in any material way, and it may be more\n   appropriate
    to use the existing DNS mechanisms [RFC1034] to provide\n   the desired delegation,
    data, or lack-of-data, for the name in\n   question.  Where the desired behaviour
    can be achieved via the\n   existing domain name registration processes, that
    process should be\n   used.  Reservation of a Special-Use Domain Name is not a
    mechanism\n   for circumventing normal domain name registration processes.\n   As
    an example, suppose there were to be an IETF document specifying\n   that a particular
    name (or set of names) is guaranteed to produce an\n   NXDOMAIN (\"Name Error\"
    [RFC1035]) result.  Such a document falls\n   within the responsibilities of the
    IETF.  The IETF is responsible for\n   protocol rules.  The IETF defines name
    character set, length limits,\n   syntax, the fact that in DNS \"A\" is equivalent
    to \"a\", etc.\n   [RFC1034] [RFC1035].  Portions of the namespace created by
    those\n   rules are given to ICANN to manage, but, due to established DNS\n   protocol
    rules, ICANN is not free to allocate \"COM\" and \"com\" to two\n   different
    name servers.  The IETF has responsibility for specifying\n   how the DNS protocol
    works, and ICANN is responsible for allocating\n   the names made possible by
    that DNS protocol.  Now, suppose a\n   developer were to use this special \"guaranteed
    nonexistent\" name,\n   \"knowing\" that it's guaranteed to return NXDOMAIN, and
    suppose also\n   that the user's DNS server fails to return NXDOMAIN for this
    name.\n   The developer's software then fails.  Who do the user and/or\n   developer
    complain to?  ICANN?  The IETF?  The DNS server operator?\n   If the developer
    can't depend on the special \"guaranteed nonexistent\"\n   name to always return
    NXDOMAIN, then the special name is worthless,\n   because it can't be relied on
    to do what it is supposed to.  For this\n   special \"guaranteed nonexistent\"
    name to have any use, it has to be\n   defined to return NXDOMAIN, BY PROTOCOL,
    for all installations, not\n   just by ICANN allocation on the public Internet.
    \ ICANN has no\n   jurisdiction over how users choose to configure their own private
    DNS\n   servers on their own private networks, but developers need a protocol\n
    \  specification that states that returning positive answers for the\n   special
    \"guaranteed nonexistent\" name is a protocol violation on\n   *all* networks,
    not just the public Internet.  Hence, the act of\n   defining such a special name
    creates a higher-level protocol rule,\n   above ICANN's management of allocable
    names on the public Internet.\n"
  title: 3.  Applicability
- contents:
  - "4.  Procedure\n   If it is determined that special handling of a name is required
    in\n   order to implement some desired new functionality, then an IETF\n   \"Standards
    Action\" or \"IESG Approval\" specification [RFC5226] MUST be\n   published describing
    the new functionality.\n   The specification MUST state how implementations determine
    that the\n   special handling is required for any given name.  This is typically\n
    \  done by stating that any fully qualified domain name ending in a\n   certain
    suffix (i.e., falling within a specified parent pseudo-\n   domain) will receive
    the special behaviour.  In effect, this carves\n   off a sub-tree of the DNS namespace
    in which the modified name\n   treatment rules apply, analogous to how IP multicast
    [RFC1112] or IP\n   link-local addresses [RFC3927] [RFC4862] carve off chunks
    of the IP\n   address space in which their respective modified address treatment\n
    \  rules apply.\n   The specification also MUST state, in each of the seven \"Domain
    Name\n   Reservation Considerations\" categories below, what special treatment,\n
    \  if any, is to be applied.  If in all seven categories the answer is\n   \"none\",
    then possibly no special treatment is required and requesting\n   reservation
    of a Special-Use Domain Name may not be appropriate.\n"
  title: 4.  Procedure
- contents:
  - "5.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations\n   An IETF \"Standards Action\" or
    \"IESG Approval\" document specifying\n   some new naming behaviour, which requires
    a Special-Use Domain Name\n   be reserved to implement this desired new behaviour,
    needs to contain\n   a subsection of the \"IANA Considerations\" section titled
    \"Domain Name\n   Reservation Considerations\" giving answers in the seven categories\n
    \  listed below.  In the case of algorithmically generated DNS names,\n   the
    specifying document needs to clearly identify the set of names\n   generated by
    the algorithm that would require the proposed special\n   treatment.\n   1.  Users:\n
    \      Are human users expected to recognize these names as special and\n       use
    them differently?  In what way?\n   2.  Application Software:\n       Are writers
    of application software expected to make their\n       software recognize these
    names as special and treat them\n       differently?  In what way?  (For example,
    if a human user enters\n       such a name, should the application software reject
    it with an\n       error message?)\n   3.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries:\n
    \      Are writers of name resolution APIs and libraries expected to\n       make
    their software recognize these names as special and treat\n       them differently?
    \ If so, how?\n   4.  Caching DNS Servers:\n       Are developers of caching domain
    name servers expected to make\n       their implementations recognize these names
    as special and treat\n       them differently?  If so, how?\n   5.  Authoritative
    DNS Servers:\n       Are developers of authoritative domain name servers expected
    to\n       make their implementations recognize these names as special and\n       treat
    them differently?  If so, how?\n   6.  DNS Server Operators:\n       Does this
    reserved Special-Use Domain Name have any potential\n       impact on DNS server
    operators?  If they try to configure their\n       authoritative DNS server as
    authoritative for this reserved name,\n       will compliant name server software
    reject it as invalid?  Do DNS\n       server operators need to know about that
    and understand why?\n       Even if the name server software doesn't prevent them
    from using\n       this reserved name, are there other ways that it may not work
    as\n       expected, of which the DNS server operator should be aware?\n   7.
    \ DNS Registries/Registrars:\n       How should DNS Registries/Registrars treat
    requests to register\n       this reserved domain name?  Should such requests
    be denied?\n       Should such requests be allowed, but only to a specially-\n
    \      designated entity?  (For example, the name \"www.example.org\" is\n       reserved
    for documentation examples and is not available for\n       registration; however,
    the name is in fact registered; and there\n       is even a web site at that name,
    which states circularly that the\n       name is reserved for use in documentation
    and cannot be\n       registered!)\n"

      \"example.\", \"example.com.\", \"example.net.\",\n   \"example.org.\", and
      any names falling within those domains, are\n   special in the following ways:\n
      \  1.  Users SHOULD understand that example names are reserved for use\n       in
      documentation.\n   2.  Application software SHOULD NOT recognize example names
      as\n       special and SHOULD use example names as they would other domain\n
      \      names.\n   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD NOT recognize
      example\n       names as special and SHOULD NOT treat them differently.  Name\n
      \      resolution APIs SHOULD send queries for example names to their\n       configured
      caching DNS server(s).\n   4.  Caching DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example
      names as special\n       and SHOULD resolve them normally.\n   5.  Authoritative
      DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize example names as\n       special.\n   6.  DNS
      server operators SHOULD be aware that example names are\n       reserved for
      use in documentation.\n   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests
      to register\n       example names in the normal way to any person or entity.
      \ All\n       example names are registered in perpetuity to IANA:\n        Domain

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document outlines the circumstances in which
    reserving a domain\n   name for special use is appropriate, and the procedure
    for having\n   that Special-Use Domain Name recorded by IANA.  Any document\n
    \  requesting such a Special-Use Domain Name needs to contain an\n   appropriate
    \"Security Considerations\" section which describes any\n   security issues relevant
    to that special use.\n"

  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created a new registry of Special-Use Domain
    Names,\n   initially populated with the private-address reverse-mapping domains\n
    \  and the Reserved Top Level DNS Names outlined above in Section 6.\n   When
    IANA receives a request to record a new \"Special-Use Domain\n   Name\", it should
    verify, in consultation with the IESG, that the IETF\n   \"Standards Action\"
    or \"IESG Approval\" document [RFC5226] includes the\n   required \"Domain Name
    Reservation Considerations\" section stating how\n   the special meaning of this
    name affects the behavior of hardware,\n   software, and humans in the seven categories.
    \ If IANA and the IESG\n   determine that special handling of this \"Special-Use
    Domain Name\" is\n   appropriate, IANA should record the Special-Use Domain Name,
    and a\n   reference to the specification that documents it, in the registry.\n"
