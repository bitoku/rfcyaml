- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   GMPLS [RFC3473] introduced explicit support for bidirectional\
    \ Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs).  The defined support matched the switching\n\
    \   technologies covered by GMPLS, notably Time Division Multiplexing\n   (TDM)\
    \ and lambdas; specifically, it only supported bidirectional LSPs\n   with symmetric\
    \ bandwidth allocation.  Symmetric bandwidth\n   requirements are conveyed using\
    \ the semantics objects defined in\n   [RFC2205] and [RFC2210].\n   Recent work\
    \ ([GMPLS-PBBTE] and [MEF-TRAFFIC]) has looked at extending\n   GMPLS to control\
    \ Ethernet switching.  In this context, there has been\n   discussion of the support\
    \ of bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric\n   bandwidth.  (That is, bidirectional\
    \ LSPs that have different\n   bandwidth reservations in each direction.)  This\
    \ discussion motivated\n   the extensions defined in this document, which may\
    \ be used with any\n   switching technology to signal asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional\n\
    \   LSPs.  The procedures described in this document are experimental.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   Bandwidth parameters are transported within RSVP ([RFC2210],\n\
    \   [RFC3209], and [RFC3473]) via several objects that are opaque to\n   RSVP.\
    \  While opaque to RSVP, these objects support a particular model\n   for the\
    \ communication of bandwidth information between an RSVP\n   session sender (ingress)\
    \ and receiver (egress).  The original model\n   of communication, defined in\
    \ [RFC2205] and maintained in [RFC3209],\n   used the SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC\
    \ objects in Path messages and the\n   FLOWSPEC object in Resv messages.  The\
    \ SENDER_TSPEC object was used\n   to indicate a sender's data generation capabilities.\
    \  The FLOWSPEC\n   object was issued by the receiver and indicated the resources\
    \ that\n   should be allocated to the associated data traffic.  The ADSPEC\n \
    \  object was used to inform the receiver and intermediate hops of the\n   actual\
    \ resources allocated for the associated data traffic.\n   With the introduction\
    \ of bidirectional LSPs in [RFC3473], the model\n   of communication of bandwidth\
    \ parameters was implicitly changed.  In\n   the context of [RFC3473] bidirectional\
    \ LSPs, the SENDER_TSPEC object\n   indicates the desired resources for both upstream\
    \ and downstream\n   directions.  The FLOWSPEC object is simply confirmation of\
    \ the\n   allocated resources.  The definition of the ADSPEC object is either\n\
    \   unmodified and only has meaning for downstream traffic, or is\n   implicitly\
    \ or explicitly ([RFC4606] and [MEF-TRAFFIC]) irrelevant.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Approach Overview
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Approach Overview\n   The approach for supporting asymmetric bandwidth\
    \ bidirectional LSPs\n   defined in this document builds on the original RSVP\
    \ model for the\n   transport of traffic-related parameters and GMPLS's support\
    \ for\n   bidirectional LSPs.  An alternative approach was considered and\n  \
    \ rejected in favor of the more generic approach presented below.  For\n   reference\
    \ purposes only, the rejected approach is summarized in\n   Appendix A.\n   The\
    \ defined approach is generic and can be applied to any switching\n   technology\
    \ supported by GMPLS.  With this approach, the existing\n   SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC,\
    \ and FLOWSPEC objects are complemented with the\n   addition of new UPSTREAM_TSPEC,\
    \ UPSTREAM_ADSPEC, and\n   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.  The existing objects are\
    \ used in the\n   original fashion defined in [RFC2205] and [RFC2210], and refer\
    \ only\n   to traffic associated with the LSP flowing in the downstream\n   direction.\
    \  The new objects are used in exactly the same fashion as\n   the old objects,\
    \ but refer to the upstream traffic flow.  Figure 1\n   shows the bandwidth-related\
    \ objects used for asymmetric bandwidth\n   bidirectional LSPs.\n            \

  contents:
  - "A.1.  Applicability\n   This section presents an alternate method for the support\
    \ of\n   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP establishment with a single\n\
    \   RSVP-TE signaling session.  This approach differs in applicability\n   and\
    \ generality from the approach presented in the main body of this\n   document.\
    \  In particular, this approach is technology-specific; it\n   uses the ADSPEC\
    \ object to carry traffic parameters for upstream data\n   and requires the Metro\
    \ Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Traffic\n   Parameter, while the approach presented\
    \ above is suitable for use\n   with any technology.\n   The generalized asymmetric\
    \ bandwidth bidirectional LSP presented in\n   the main body of this document\
    \ has the benefit of being applicable to\n   any switching technology, but requires\
    \ support for three new types of\n   object classes, i.e., the UPSTREAM_TSPEC,\
    \ UPSTREAM_ADSPEC, and\n   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.\n   The solution presented\
    \ in this section is based on the\n    Ethernet-specific ADSPEC object, and is\
    \ referred to as the \"ADSPEC\n   Object\" approach.  This approach limits applicability\
    \ to cases where\n   the [MEF-TRAFFIC] traffic parameters are appropriate, and\
    \ to\n   switching technologies that define no use for the ADSPEC object.\n  \
    \ While ultimately it is this limited scope that has resulted in this\n   approach\
    \ being relegated to an Appendix, the semantics of this\n   approach are quite\
    \ simple in that they only require the definition of\n   a new ADSPEC object C-Type.\n\
    \   In summary, the \"ADSPEC Object\" approach presented in this section\n   SHOULD\
    \ NOT be implemented.\n"
- title: A.2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Overview\n   The \"ADSPEC Object\" approach is specific to Ethernet and\
    \ uses [MEF-\n   TRAFFIC] traffic parameters.  This approach is not generic and\
    \ is\n   aimed at providing asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs for just\n\
    \   Ethernet transport.  With this approach, the ADSPEC object carries\n   the\
    \ traffic parameters for the upstream data flow.  SENDER_TSPEC\n   object is used\
    \ to indicate the traffic parameters for the downstream\n   data flow.  The FLOWSPEC\
    \ object provides confirmation of the\n   allocated downstream resources.  Confirmation\
    \ of the upstream\n   resource allocation is a Resv message, as any resource allocation\n\
    \   failure for the upstream direction will always result in a PathErr\n   message.\
    \  Figure 2 shows the bandwidth-related objects used in the\n   first approach.\n\

    \ Bidirectional LSPs Using ADSPEC Object\n   In the \"ADSPEC Object\" approach,\
    \ the setup of an asymmetric bandwidth\n   bidirectional LSP would be signaled\
    \ using the bidirectional\n   procedures defined in [RFC3473] together with the\
    \ inclusion of a new\n   ADSPEC object.  The new ADSPEC object would be specific\
    \ to Ethernet\n   and could be called the Ethernet Upstream Traffic Parameter\
    \ ADSPEC\n   object.  The Ethernet Upstream Traffic Parameter ADSPEC object would\n\
    \   use the Class-Number 13 and C-Type UNASSIGNED (this approach should\n   not\
    \ be implemented).  The format of the object would be the same as\n   the Ethernet\
    \ SENDER_TSPEC object defined in [MEF-TRAFFIC].\n   This approach would not modify\
    \ behavior of symmetric bandwidth LSPs.\n   Per [MEF-TRAFFIC], such LSPs are signaled\
    \ either without an ADSPEC or\n   with an INTSERV ADSPEC.\n   The defined approach\
    \ could be reused to support asymmetric bandwidth\n   bidirectional LSPs for other\
    \ types of switching technologies.  All\n   that would be needed would be to define\
    \ the proper ADSPEC object.\n"
- title: A.3.  Procedures
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Procedures\n   Using the approach presented in this section, the process\
    \ of\n   establishing an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP would follow\n\
    \   the process of establishing a symmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP,\n   as\
    \ defined in Section 3 of [RFC3473], with two modifications.  These\n   modifications\
    \ would be followed when an incoming Path message is\n   received containing an\
    \ Upstream_Label object and the Ethernet\n   Upstream Traffic Parameter ADSPEC\
    \ object.\n   The first modification to the symmetric bandwidth process would\
    \ be\n   that when allocating the upstream label, the bandwidth associated\n \
    \  with the upstream label would be taken from the Ethernet Upstream\n   Traffic\
    \ Parameter ADSPEC object, see Section 3.1 of [RFC3473].\n   Consistent with [RFC3473],\
    \ a node that is unable to allocate a label\n   or internal resources based on\
    \ the contents of the ADSPEC object,\n   would issue a PathErr message with a\
    \ \"Routing problem/MPLS label\n   allocation failure\" indication.\n   The second\
    \ modification would be that the ADSPEC object would not be\n   modified by transit\
    \ nodes.\n"
- title: A.4.  Compatibility
  contents:
  - "A.4.  Compatibility\n   The approach presented in this section reuses semantics\
    \ and\n   procedures defined in [RFC3473].  To indicate the use of asymmetric\n\
    \   bandwidth, a new ADSPEC object C-type would be defined.  Per\n   [RFC2205],\
    \ nodes not supporting the approach should not recognize\n   this new C-type and\
    \ respond with an \"Unknown object C-Type\" error.\n"
