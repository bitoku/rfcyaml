- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) specification\
    \ [2]\n   allows a Call Agent to specify a new NotifiedEntity parameter in\n \
    \  order to redirect one or more endpoints to a new Call Agent.  This\n   must\
    \ be done in a NotificationRequest or a connection handling\n   command.  However,\
    \ because these commands affect endpoint or\n   connection state, such a request\
    \ cannot typically be sent to a group\n   of endpoints with a single command.\
    \  This means that if a new Call\n   Agent takes over for a failed one, the new\
    \ Call Agent must redirect\n   endpoints one at a time.  If there is a large number\
    \ of endpoints\n   (e.g., within a large trunking gateway), this could take considerable\n\
    \   time.\n   This document defines a new redirect and reset package for MGCP\
    \ that\n   allows the Call Agent to redirect a group of endpoints without\n  \
    \ affecting endpoint or connection state.\n   Also included is a new NotifiedEntityList\
    \ parameter, which is similar\n   to the NotifiedEntity parameter but allows for\
    \ multiple domain names\n   to be provided.  This allows the Call Agent to more\
    \ accurately direct\n   endpoints to a preferred ordered list of alternate Call\
    \ Agents.\n   A third capability contained in this package is the ability to reset\n\
    \   and re-initialize one or more groups of endpoints efficiently.  This\n   capability\
    \ is useful in Call Agent failover situations.\n"

    \ to a collection of endpoints specified by an\n         \"all of\" wildcard.\
    \  This is useful if a new Call Agent takes\n         over from a previous one\
    \ and wants to redirect endpoint(s) to\n         send messages to it from now\
    \ on.\n      *  Allows a Call Agent to request one or more groups of endpoints\n\
    \         to do a reset, which can be useful following certain types of\n    \
    \     failures.\n"
- title: 2.1.  NotifiedEntityList Extension Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.1.  NotifiedEntityList Extension Parameter\n   The NotifiedEntityList parameter\
    \ is encoded as \"NL\" and is followed\n   by a colon and a comma-separated list\
    \ of NotifiedEntity values as\n   defined in the MGCP specification [2], as follows:\n\
    \      RED/NL: ca1@myca.whatever.net, ca2@mybackupca.whatever.net\n   The NotifiedEntityList\
    \ works in a way similar to the NotifiedEntity\n   parameter, except that it allows\
    \ multiple domain names to be listed.\n   The NotifiedEntityList thus specifies\
    \ a new \"notified entity\" for the\n   endpoint.\n   The NotifiedEntityList parameter\
    \ is optional in any command or\n   response where the NotifiedEntity parameter\
    \ is allowed.  Following a\n   restart, the NotifiedEntityList is initially empty,\
    \ unless\n   provisioned otherwise.  In subsequent commands, it retains its\n\
    \   current value until explicitly changed.  If both a NotifiedEntity\n   parameter\
    \ and a non-empty NotifiedEntityList parameter have been set\n   (not necessarily\
    \ at the same time), the NotifiedEntity parameter\n   value will be viewed as\
    \ being implicitly added to the beginning of\n   the NotifiedEntityList parameter.\
    \  The NotifiedEntity parameter thus\n   always defines the first domain name\
    \ to contact unless it has\n   explicitly been set to empty.  In that case, the\
    \ NotifiedEntityList\n   defines the \"notified entity\".  If the NotifiedEntityList\
    \ is also\n   empty, then the normal MGCP handling of an empty \"notified entity\"\
    \n   applies.  We will refer to the list of domain names that result from\n  \
    \ the above rules as the \"notified entity list\".\n   When the \"notified entity\
    \ list\" is non-empty, transmission is first\n   attempted with the first domain\
    \ name in the list, as in the normal\n   MGCP retransmission procedures described\
    \ in [2].  Each of the IP\n   addresses for this domain name MUST first be tried\
    \ as specified in\n   [2], and if this is unsuccessful, each of the IP-addresses\
    \ for the\n   second domain name MUST then be attempted, etc., following the normal\n\
    \   MGCP retransmission procedures, with \"N\" (the number of\n   retransmissions)\
    \ set to zero for each domain name (see Section 4.3 in\n   [2]).  Whenever retransmission\
    \ to a new domain name is initiated, the\n   default retransmission timer value\
    \ (RTO), etc., SHOULD be used.  The\n   estimator (T-DELAY) and measurements (AAD\
    \ and ADEV) used for the\n   transmission to the previous domain name are considered\
    \ obsolete.\n   Note, however, that the maximum transaction lifetime considerations\n\
    \   apply as usual; therefore, retransmission to any of the IP addresses\n   for\
    \ any of the domain names MUST NOT occur more than T-Max seconds\n   after the\
    \ command is initially sent, irrespective of where it was\n   sent.  The Max1\
    \ DNS query MAY be performed for each of the domain\n   names, or it MAY simply\
    \ be performed for the first domain name.  The\n   Max2 DNS query however MUST\
    \ NOT be performed for any but the last\n   domain name.  Also note that only\
    \ the last IP-address for the last\n   domain name can reach Max2 retransmissions;\
    \ therefore, retransmission\n   to all IP addresses other than the last IP address\
    \ of the last domain\n   name in the list MUST end after Max1 retransmissions.\n\
    \   The current value of the NotifiedEntityList parameter can be audited\n   via\
    \ AuditEndpoint; the value of the NotifiedEntity parameter will not\n   be included\
    \ here and must be audited separately.  Support for the\n   NotifiedEntityList\
    \ in AuditConnection is permissible, but it is\n   neither required nor recommended.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  EndpointList and EndpointMap Extension Parameters\n   A simple \"all-of\"\
    \ wildcard, as defined in [2], may not be sufficient\n   to accurately specify\
    \ endpoints of interest.  An example of this is a\n   case where a Call Agent\
    \ fails over, resulting in a state mismatch for\n   endpoints involved with transient\
    \ calls.  To re-synchronize, the Call\n   Agent can use the reset extension parameter\
    \ described in section 2.4\n   of this document, to ensure that idle endpoints\
    \ are in fact idle.\n   However, these endpoints may be randomly distributed across\
    \ the\n   available endpoints in a large trunk gateway.\n   To satisfy this requirement,\
    \ the RED package introduces some new\n   parameters that may be used to specify\
    \ the endpoints of interest for\n   the EndpointConfiguration Command.  These\
    \ are the EndpointList and\n   the EndpointMap extension parameters.  These parameters\
    \ MUST only be\n   used when a virtual endpoint corresponding to the gateway is\n\
    \   specified as the LocalEndpointName, such as:\n      EPCF 1200 MG@gw1.whatever.net\
    \ MGCP 1.0\n   where \"MG\" is the virtual endpoint name associated with the gateway.\n\
    \   The EndPointList parameters is a list of endpoint names that can\n   include\
    \ one or more lines in the following format:\n      \"RED/EL:\" 0*WSP RangedLocalName\
    \ 0*(\",\" 0*WSP RangedLocalName)\n   RangedLocalName is a LocalEndpointName that\
    \ may include the range\n   wildcard notation described in Appendix E (section\
    \ E.5) of [2] as\n   well as an \"all\" wildcard, but the two forms MUST NOT be\
    \ mixed in a\n   single command:\n      RangeWildcard  = \"*\" / \"[\" NumericalRange\
    \ *(\",\" NumericalRange)\"]\"\n      NumericalRange = 1*(DIGIT) [ \"-\" 1*(DIGIT)\
    \ ]\n   Example:\n      RED/EL: ds/ds1-1/[1-24], ds/ds1-2/[1-24], ds/ds1-3/[1-24]\n\
    \   Including an EndpointMap parameter with the following format can\n   further\
    \ specify the endpoints:\n      \"RED/MP:\" 0*WSP TrueOrFalse 0*(TrueOrFalse)\n\
    \      TrueOrFalse = \"T\" / \"F\"\n   \"T\" indicates that the command should\
    \ be applied to the corresponding\n   endpoint, and \"F\" indicates that it should\
    \ not.  This parameter can\n   be used in conjunction with the reset extension\
    \ parameter described\n   in section 2.4 of this document to force arbitrarily\
    \ distributed\n   endpoints into an idle state.\n   If the EndpointMap parameter\
    \ is used, it MUST be immediately preceded\n   (i.e., on the previous line) by\
    \ an EndPointList parameter to specify\n   the endpoints the EndpointMap is referring\
    \ to (the EndPointList MUST\n   NOT contain the \"all\" wildcard).  Several EndpointList\
    \ and\n   EndpointMap parameter lines can be provided.  It is considered an\n\
    \   error if an EndpointMap parameter extends beyond the endpoints\n   specified\
    \ in the preceding EndPointList parameter.  In that case,\n   return code 800\
    \ MUST be used (see section 2.5).\n   The EndpointList and EndpointMap parameters\
    \ MUST only be used with\n   the EndpointConfiguration command.  The EndpointList\
    \ parameter MAY be\n   provided without an EndpointMap parameter.  However, as\
    \ indicated\n   earlier, an EndpointMap parameter MUST be immediately preceded\
    \ by an\n   EndpointList parameter.  Neither of these parameters is auditable.\n\
    \   For an example of EndpointMap parameter usage, see Section 2.4.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Application to Out-of-Service Endpoints
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Application to Out-of-Service Endpoints\n   Note that the EndpointConfiguration\
    \ command is normally only valid\n   for in-service endpoints.  If an EndpointConfiguration\
    \ request is\n   sent to a wildcarded LocalEndpointName [2] and any of the endpoints\n\
    \   specified are out-of-service, the command will fail with return code\n   501\
    \ (endpoint not ready).\n   However, as long as the gateway is in service and\
    \ able to respond to\n   MGCP commands, it can apply the endpoint configuration\
    \ command to\n   endpoints specified by the EndpointList and/or EndpointMap parameters\n\
    \   (regardless of whether those endpoints are in-service).  Of course,\n   the\
    \ endpoint configuration information will not be maintained over\n   gateway restarts\
    \ (as the Call Agent would have to reapply the\n   endpoint configuration after\
    \ it receives an RSIP with the restart\n   method \"restart\").  For example,\
    \ if a new \"notified entity\" was\n   provided, it would have no effect since\
    \ the provisioned value would\n   be used upon restart.\n   EndpointList and/or\
    \ EndpointMap parameters MUST only be used with a\n   virtual endpoint name corresponding\
    \ to the gateway (as indicated\n   above).  If it is used with any other endpoint\
    \ name (whether wild-\n   carded or not), then error code 801 (section 2.5) MUST\
    \ be returned.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Redirect
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Redirect\n   A new extension parameter for use with the EndpointConfiguration\n\
    \   command is defined.  A new NotifiedEntity value can be included with\n   a\
    \ \"RED/N\" parameter as follows:\n      EPCF 1200 *@gw1.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n\
    \      RED/N: ca1@ca1234.whatever.net\n   This changes the \"notified entity\"\
    \ for the endpoint(s) to the value\n   specified.  If the \"all of\" wildcard\
    \ convention is used, the\n   NotifiedEntity value replaces all of the existing\
    \ \"notified entities\"\n   for those endpoints.  If NotifiedEntity is omitted\
    \ in a subsequent\n   EndpointConfiguration command, the \"notified entity\" remains\n\
    \   unchanged.\n   If the \"notified entity\" is a domain name that resolves to\
    \ multiple\n   IP addresses, one of the resolved addresses MUST be selected. \
    \ If one\n   of those IP addresses is the IP address of the Call Agent sending\
    \ the\n   request, that IP address SHOULD be selected first.\n   The NotifiedEntityList\
    \ parameter can also be specified in an endpoint\n   configuration command, such\

    \ 2.2, it can also apply this to the gateway\n   virtual endpoint:\n      EPCF\
    \ 1200 MG@gw1.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n      RED/EL: *\n      RED/NL: ca1@myca.whatever.net,\
    \ ca2@mybackupca.whatever.net\n   Note that the outcome of this command is not\
    \ affected by the service\n   state of the endpoints on the gateway.\n   As indicated\
    \ in section 2.1, the NotifiedEntityList (\"RED/NL\")\n   parameter may be used\
    \ with any command for which a NotifiedEntity\n   parameter is allowed.  However,\
    \ the \"RED/N\" parameter SHOULD only be\n   used with the endpoint configuration\
