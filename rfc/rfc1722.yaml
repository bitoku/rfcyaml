  - "2.  Introduction\n   This report describes how RIP-2 may be useful within the
    Internet.\n   In essence, the environments in which RIP-2 is the IGP of choice
    is a\n   superset of the environments in which RIP-1, as defined in RFC 1058\n
    \  [1], has traditionally been used.  It is important to remember that\n   RIP-2
    is an extension to RIP-1; RIP-2 is not a new protocol.  Thus,\n   the operational
    aspects of distance-vector routing protocols, and\n   RIP-1 in particular, within
    an autonomous system are well understood.\n   It should be noted that RIP-2 is
    not intended to be a substitute for\n   OSPF in large autonomous systems; the
    restrictions on AS diameter and\n   complexity which applied to RIP-1 also apply
    to RIP-2.  Rather, RIP-2\n   allows the smaller, simpler, distance-vector protocol
    to be used in\n   environments which require authentication or the use of variable\n
    \  length subnet masks, but are not of a size or complexity which\n   require
    the use of the larger, more complex, link-state protocol.\n   The remainder of
    this report describes how each of the extensions to\n   RIP-1 may be used to increase
    the overall usefullness of RIP-2.\n"

    - "3.1 Subnet Masks\n   The original impetus behind the creation of RIP-2 was
      the desire to\n   include subnet masks in the routing information exchanged
      by RIP.\n   This was needed because subnetting was not defined when RIP was
      first\n   created.  As long as the subnet mask was fixed for a network, and\n
      \  well known by all the nodes on that network, a heuristic could be\n   used
      to determine if a route was a subnet route or a host route.\n   With the advent
      of variable length subnetting, CIDR, and\n   supernetting, it was no longer
      possible for a heuristic to reasonably\n   distinguish between network, subnet,
      and host routes.\n   By using the 32-bit field immediately following the IP
      address in a\n   RIP routing entry, it became possible to positively identify
      a\n   route's type.  In fact, one could go so far as to say that the\n   inclusion
      of the subnet mask effictively creates a 64-bit address\n   which eliminates
      the network, subnet, host distinction.\n   Therefore, the inclusion of subnet
      masks in RIP-2 allows it to be\n   used in an AS which requires precise knowledge
      of the subnet mask for\n   a given route, but does not otherwise require OSPF.\n"

    - "3.2. Next Hop\n   The purpose of the Next Hop field is to eliminate packets
      being\n   routed through extra hops in the system.  It is particularly useful\n
      \  when RIP is not being run on all of the routers on a network.\n   Consider
      the following example topology:\n      -----   -----         -----   -----\n
      \     |IR1|   |IR2|         |XR1|   |XR2|\n      --+--   --+--         --+--
      \  --+--\n        |       |             |       |\n      --+-------+-------------+-------+--\n
      \       |--------RIP-2--------|\n   The Internal Routers (IR1 and IR2) are only
      running RIP-2.  The\n   External Routers (XR1 and XR2) are both running BGP,
      for example;\n   however, only XR1 is running BGP and RIP-2.  Since XR2 is not
      running\n   RIP-2, the IRs will not know of its existance and will never use
      it\n   as a next hop, even if it is a better next hop than XR1.  Of course,\n
      \  XR1 knows this and can indicate, via the Next Hop field, that XR2 is\n   the
      better next hop for some routes.\n   Another use for Next Hop has also been
      found.  Consider the following\n   example topology:\n           -----\n           |COR|\n
      \          -----\n           /   \\\n          /     \\\n      -----     -----
      \    -----\n      |RO1|-----|RO2|=====| R |\n      -----     -----     -----\n
      \  The three links between the Central Office Router (COR) and the\n   Remote
      Office routers (RO1 and RO2) are all Dial-On-Demand (DOD)\n   links.  The link
      between RO2 and R is a fixed link.  Once all of the\n   routers have been initialized,
      the only routes they know about are\n   the configured static routes for the
      DOD links.  Assume that\n   connections between COR and RO1, and COR and RO2
      are established and\n   RIP information is passing between the routers.  RO1
      will ignore\n   COR's route to RO2 because it already has a better one; however,
      it\n   will learn to reach R via COR.\n   If we assume that RO1 and RO2 are
      only capable of establishing one\n   link at a time, then RO1 will not be able
      to reach RO2; however, RO1\n   will be able to reach R.  Worse still, if we
      assume that traffic\n   stops and the DOD links drop due to inactivity, an attempt
      by RO1 to\n   reach R will trigger the dialing of two links (through COR).  Of\n
      \  course, once RO1 establishes a link to RO2, the problem corrects\n   itself
      because the new route to R is one hop shorter.\n   To correct this problem,
      the routers may use the Next Hop field to\n   indicate their next hop.  Consider
      the following route advertisements\n   during the period described above (before
      the RO1/RO2 link has ever\n   been established):\n      Sender  Recvr   Route
      \  NextHop  Metric\n      =======================================\n      RO2
      \    COR     R       0        1\n      ---------------------------------------\n
      \     COR     RO1     RO2     0        1\n                      R       RO2
      \     2\n      ---------------------------------------\n   When R01 receives
      the two routes from COR, it will ignore the route\n   for RO2, as mentioned
      above.  However, since R is not in RO1's\n   routing table, it will add it using
      a next hop of RO2 (because RO2 is\n   directly connected, after a fashion).
      \ Note that COR does count\n   itself in R's metric; this is less than accurate,
      but entirely safe\n   and correctable (when the RO1/RO2 link comes up).  Suppose,
      now, that\n   the RO1/RO2 link did not exist.  RO1 would ignore the specification\n
      \  of RO2 as the next hop to R and use COR, as it would if no Next Hop\n   had
      been specified.\n   Note that this is not a recursive algorithm; it only works
      to\n   eliminate a single extra hop from the path.  There are methods by\n   which
      this mechanism might be extended to include larger\n   optimizations, but the
      potential to create routing loops has not been\n   sufficiently analyzed to
      specify them here.\n"

    - "3.3 Authentication\n   The need for authentication in a routing protocol is
      obvious.  It is\n   not usually important to conceal the information in the
      routing\n   messages, but it is essential to prevent the insertion of bogus\n
      \  routing information into the routers.  So, while the authentication\n   mechanism
      specified in RIP-2 is less than ideal, it does prevent\n   anyone who cannot
      directly access the network (i.e., someone who\n   cannot sniff the routing
      packets to determine the password) from\n   inserting bogus routing information.\n
      \  However, the specification does allow for additional types of\n   authentication
      to be incorporated into the protocol.  Unfortunately,\n   because of the original
      format of RIP packets, the amount of space\n   available for providing authentication
      information is only 16 octets.\n"

    - "3.4 Multicasting\n   The RIP-2 protocol provides for the IP multicasting of
      periodic\n   advertisements.  This feature was added to decrease the load on\n
      \  systems which do not support RIP-2.  It also provides a mechanism\n   whereby
      RIP-1 routers will never receive RIP-2 routes.  This is a\n   feature when correct
      use of an advertised route depends on knowing\n   the precise subnet mask, which
      would be ignored by a RIP-1 router.\n"

  - "4.  Conclusion\n   Because the basic protocol is unchanged, RIP-2 is as correct
    a\n   routing protocol as RIP-1.  The enhancements make RIP-2 useful in\n   environments
    which RIP-1 could not handle, but which do not\n   necessitate the use of OSPF
    by virtue of requirements which RIP-2\n   does not satisfy.\n"
