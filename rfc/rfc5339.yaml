  - "1.  Introduction\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to handle multiple\
    \ switching\n   technologies: packet switching, layer-2 switching, TDM (Time Division\n\
    \   Multiplexing) switching, wavelength switching, and fiber switching\n   (see\
    \ [RFC3945]).  The Interface Switching Capability (ISC) concept is\n   introduced\
    \ for these switching technologies and is designated as\n   follows: PSC (Packet\
    \ Switch Capable), L2SC (Layer-2 Switch Capable),\n   TDM capable, LSC (Lambda\
    \ Switch Capable), and FSC (Fiber Switch\n   Capable).  The representation, in\
    \ a GMPLS control plane, of a\n   switching technology domain is referred to as\
    \ a region [RFC4206].  A\n   switching type describes the ability of a node to\
    \ forward data of a\n   particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies\
    \ a network\n   region.\n   A data plane switching layer describes a data plane\
    \ switching\n   granularity level.  For example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c\
    \ are\n   three different layers.  [RFC5212] defines a Multi-Layer Network\n \
    \  (MLN) to be a Traffic Engineering (TE) domain comprising multiple\n   data\
    \ plane switching layers either of the same ISC (e.g., TDM) or\n   different ISC\
    \ (e.g., TDM and PSC) and controlled by a single GMPLS\n   control plane instance.\
    \  [RFC5212] further defines a particular case\n   of MLNs.  A Multi-Region Network\
    \ (MRN) is defined as a TE domain\n   supporting at least two different switching\
    \ types (e.g., PSC and\n   TDM), either hosted on the same device or on different\
    \ ones, and\n   under the control of a single GMPLS control plane instance.\n\
    \   The objectives of this document are to evaluate existing GMPLS\n   mechanisms\
    \ and protocols ([RFC3945], [RFC4202], [RFC3471], [RFC3473])\n   against the requirements\
    \ for MLNs and MRNs, defined in [RFC5212].\n   From this evaluation, we identify\
    \ several areas where additional\n   protocol extensions and modifications are\
    \ required in order to meet\n   these requirements, and we provide guidelines\
    \ for potential\n   extensions.\n   A summary of MLN/MRN requirements is provided\
    \ in Section 2.  Then\n   Section 3 evaluates whether current GMPLS protocols\
    \ and mechanisms\n   meet each of these requirements.  When the requirements are\
    \ not met\n   by existing protocols, the document identifies whether the required\n\
    \   mechanisms could rely on GMPLS protocols and procedure extensions, or\n  \
    \ whether it is entirely out of the scope of GMPLS protocols.\n   Note that this\
    \ document specifically addresses GMPLS control plane\n   functionality for MLN/MRN\
    \ in the context of a single administrative\n   control plane partition.  Partitions\
    \ of the control plane where\n   separate layers are under distinct administrative\
    \ control are for\n   future study.\n   This document uses terminologies defined\
    \ in [RFC3945], [RFC4206], and\n   [RFC5212].\n"

- title: 3.1.1.1.  Control of FA-LSPs Setup/Release
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.1.  Control of FA-LSPs Setup/Release\n   In a Multi-Layer Network, FA-LSPs\
    \ are created, modified, and released\n   periodically according to the change\
    \ of incoming traffic demands from\n   the upper layer.\n   This implies a TE\
    \ mechanism that takes into account the demands\n   matrix, the TE topology, and\
    \ potentially the current VNT, in order to\n   compute and setup a new VNT.\n\
    \   Several functional building blocks are required to support such a TE\n   mechanism:\n\
    \   - Discovery of TE topology and available resources.\n   - Collection of upper-layer\
    \ traffic demands.\n   - Policing and scheduling of VNT resources with regard\
    \ to traffic\n     demands and usage (that is, decision to setup/release FA-LSPs).\n\
    \     The functional component in charge of this function is called a VNT\n  \
    \   Manager (VNTM) [PCE-INTER].\n   - VNT Path Computation according to TE topology,\
    \ potentially taking\n     into account the old (existing) VNT in order to minimize\
    \ changes.\n     The functional component in charge of VNT computation may be\n\
    \     distributed on network elements or may be performed on an external\n   \
    \  element (such as a Path Computation Element (PCE), [RFC4655]).\n   - FA-LSP\
    \ setup/release.\n   GMPLS routing protocols provide TE topology discovery.  GMPLS\n\
    \   signaling protocols allow setting up/releasing FA-LSPs.\n   VNTM functions\
    \ (resources policing/scheduling, decision to\n   setup/release FA-LSPs, FA-LSP\
    \ configuration) are out of the scope of\n   GMPLS protocols.  Such functionalities\
    \ can be achieved directly on\n   layer-border Label Switching Routers (LSRs),\
    \ or through one or more\n   external tools.  When an external tool is used, an\
    \ interface is\n   required between the VNTM and the network elements so as to\n\
    \   setup/release FA-LSPs.  This could use standard management interfaces\n  \
    \ such as [RFC4802].\n   The set of traffic demands of the upper layer is required\
    \ for the VNT\n   Manager to take decisions to setup/release FA-LSPs.  Such traffic\n\
    \   demands include satisfied demands, for which one or more upper-layer\n   LSP\
    \ have been successfully setup, as well as unsatisfied demands and\n   future\
    \ demands, for which no upper layer LSP has been setup yet.  The\n   collection\
    \ of such information is beyond the scope of GMPLS\n   protocols.  Note that it\
    \ may be partially inferred from parameters\n   carried in GMPLS signaling or\
    \ advertised in GMPLS routing.\n   Finally, the computation of FA-LSPs that form\
    \ the VNT can be\n   performed directly on layer-border LSRs or on an external\
    \ element\n   (such as a Path Computation Element (PCE), [RFC4655]), and this\
    \ is\n   independent of the location of the VNTM.\n   Hence, to summarize, no\
    \ GMPLS protocol extensions are required to\n   control FA-LSP setup/release.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.2.  Virtual TE Links
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.2.  Virtual TE Links\n   A virtual TE link is a TE link between two upper\
    \ layer nodes that is\n   not actually associated with a fully provisioned FA-LSP\
    \ in a lower\n   layer.  A virtual TE link represents the potentiality to setup\
    \ an\n   FA-LSP in the lower layer to support the TE link that has been\n   advertised.\
    \  A virtual TE link is advertised as any TE link,\n   following the rules in\
    \ [RFC4206] defined for fully provisioned TE\n   links.  In particular, the flooding\
    \ scope of a virtual TE link is\n   within an IGP area, as is the case for any\
    \ TE link.\n   If an upper-layer LSP attempts (through a signaling message) to\
    \ make\n   use of a virtual TE link, the underlying FA-LSP is immediately\n  \
    \ signaled and provisioned (provided there are available resources in\n   the\
    \ lower layer) in the process known as triggered signaling.\n   The use of virtual\
    \ TE links has two main advantages:\n   - Flexibility: allows the computation\
    \ of an LSP path using TE links\n     without needing to take into account the\
    \ actual provisioning status\n     of the corresponding FA-LSP in the lower layer;\n\
    \   - Stability: allows stability of TE links in the upper layer, while\n    \
    \ avoiding wastage of bandwidth in the lower layer, as data plane\n     connections\
    \ are not established until they are actually needed.\n   Virtual TE links are\
    \ setup/deleted/modified dynamically, according to\n   the change of the (forecast)\
    \ traffic demand, operator's policies for\n   capacity utilization, and the available\
    \ resources in the lower layer.\n   The support of virtual TE links requires two\
    \ main building blocks:\n   - A TE mechanism for dynamic modification of virtual\
    \ TE link\n     topology;\n   - A signaling mechanism for the dynamic setup and\
    \ deletion of virtual\n     TE links.  Setting up a virtual TE link requires a\
    \ signaling\n     mechanism that allows an end-to-end association between virtual\
    \ TE\n     link end points with the purpose of exchanging link identifiers as\n\
    \     well as some TE parameters.\n   The TE mechanism responsible for triggering/policing\
    \ dynamic\n   modification of virtual TE links is out of the scope of GMPLS\n\
    \   protocols.\n   Current GMPLS signaling does not allow setting up and releasing\n\
    \   virtual TE links.  Hence, GMPLS signaling must be extended to support\n  \
    \ virtual TE links.\n   We can distinguish two options for setting up virtual\
    \ TE links:\n   - The Soft FA approach consists of setting up the FA-LSP in the\n\
    \     control plane without actually activating cross connections in the\n   \
    \  data plane.  On the one hand, this requires state maintenance on\n     all\
    \ transit LSRs (N square issue), but on the other hand, this may\n     allow for\
    \ some admission control.  Indeed, when a Soft FA is\n     activated, the resources\
    \ may no longer be available for use by\n     other Soft FAs that have common\
    \ links.  These Soft FA will be\n     dynamically released, and corresponding\
    \ virtual TE links will be\n     deleted.  The Soft FA LSPs may be setup using\
    \ procedures similar to\n     those described in [RFC4872] for setting up secondary\
    \ LSPs.\n   - The remote association approach simply consists of exchanging\n\
    \     virtual TE link IDs and parameters directly between TE link end\n     points.\
    \  This does not require state maintenance on transit LSRs,\n     but reduces\
    \ admission control capabilities.  Such an association\n     between virtual TE\
    \ link end points may rely on extensions to the\n     Resource Reservation Protocol\
    \ - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n     Automatically Switched Optical Network\
    \ (ASON) call procedure\n     [RFC4974].\n   Note that the support of virtual\
    \ TE links does not require any GMPLS\n   routing extension.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.3.  Traffic Disruption Minimization during FA Release
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.3.  Traffic Disruption Minimization during FA Release\n   Before deleting\
    \ a given FA-LSP, all nested LSPs have to be rerouted\n   and removed from the\
    \ FA-LSP to avoid traffic disruption.  The\n   mechanisms required here are similar\
    \ to those required for graceful\n   deletion of a TE link.  A Graceful TE link\
    \ deletion mechanism allows\n   for the deletion of a TE link without disrupting\
    \ traffic of TE-LSPs\n   that were using the TE link.\n   Hence, GMPLS routing\
    \ and/or signaling extensions are required to\n   support graceful deletion of\
    \ TE links.  This may utilize the\n   procedures described in [GR-SHUT]: a transit\
    \ LSR notifies a head-end\n   LSR that a TE link along the path of an LSP is going\
    \ to be torn down,\n   and also withdraws the bandwidth on the TE link so that\
    \ it is not\n   used for new LSPs.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.4.  Stability
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.4.  Stability\n   The stability of upper-layer LSP may be impaired if the\
    \ VNT undergoes\n   frequent changes.  In this context, robustness of the VNT\
    \ is defined\n   as the capability to smooth the impact of these changes and avoid\n\
    \   their subsequent propagation.\n   Guaranteeing VNT stability is out of the\
    \ scope of GMPLS protocols and\n   relies entirely on the capability of the TE\
    \ and VNT management\n   algorithms to minimize routing perturbations.  This requires\
    \ that the\n   algorithms take into account the old VNT when computing a new VNT,\n\
    \   and try to minimize the perturbation.\n   Note that a full mesh of lower-layer\
    \ LSPs may be created between\n   every pair of border nodes between the upper\
    \ and lower layers.  The\n   merit of a full mesh of lower-layer LSPs is that\
    \ it provides\n   stability to the upper-layer routing.  That is, the forwarding\
    \ table\n   used in the upper layer is not impacted if the VNT undergoes changes.\n\
    \   Further, there is always full reachability and immediate access to\n   bandwidth\
    \ to support LSPs in the upper layer.  But it also has\n   significant drawbacks,\
    \ since it requires the maintenance of n^2\n   RSVP-TE sessions (where n is the\
    \ number of border nodes), which may\n   be quite CPU- and memory-consuming (scalability\
    \ impact).  Also, this\n   may lead to significant bandwidth wastage.  Note that\
    \ the use of\n   virtual TE links solves the bandwidth wastage issue, and may\
    \ reduce\n   the control plane overload.\n"

- title: 3.1.4.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Scalability\n   As discussed in [RFC5212]), MRN/MLN routing mechanisms\
    \ must be\n   designed to scale well with an increase of any of the following:\n\
    \      - Number of nodes\n      - Number of TE links (including FA-LSPs)\n   \
    \   - Number of LSPs\n      - Number of regions and layers\n      - Number of\
    \ Interface Switching Capability Descriptors (ISCDs) per\n        TE link.\n \
    \  GMPLS routing provides the necessary advertisement functions and is\n   based\
    \ on IETF-designed IGPs.  These are known to scale relatively\n   well with the\
    \ number of nodes and links.  Where there are multiple\n   regions or layers,\
    \ there are two possibilities.\n      1.  If a single routing instance distributes\
    \ information about\n         multiple network layers, the effect is no more than\
    \ to increase\n         the number of nodes and links in the network.\n      2.\
    \  If the MLN is fully integrated (i.e., constructed from hybrid\n         nodes),\
    \ there is an increase in the number of nodes and links\n         (as just mentioned),\
    \ and also a potential increase in the\n         amount of ISCD information advertised\
    \ per link.  This is a\n         relatively small amount of information (e.g.,\
    \ 36 bytes in OSPF\n         [RFC4203]) per switching type, and each interface\
    \ is unlikely\n         to have more than two or three switching types.\n   The\
    \ number of LSPs in a lower layer that are advertised as TE links\n   may impact\
    \ the scaling of the routing protocol.  A full mesh of FA-\n   LSPs in the lower\
    \ layer would lead to n^2 TE links, where n is the\n   number of layer-border\
    \ LSRs.  This must be taken into consideration\n   in the VNT management process.\
    \  This is an operational matter beyond\n   the scope of GMPLS protocols.\n  \
    \ Since it requires the maintenance of n^2 RSVP-TE sessions (which may\n   be\
    \ quite CPU- and memory-consuming), a full mesh of LSPs in the lower\n   layer\
    \ may impact the scalability of GMPLS signaling.  The use of\n   virtual TE links\

  - "3.1.5.2.  OAM\n   At the time of writing, the development of OAM tools for GMPLS\n\
    \   networks is at an early stage.  GMPLS OAM requirements are addressed\n   in\
    \ [GMPLS-OAM].\n   In general, the lower layer network technologies contain their\
    \ own\n   technology-specific OAM processes (for example, SDH/SONET, Ethernet,\n\
    \   and MPLS).  In these cases, it is not necessary to develop additional\n  \
    \ OAM processes, but GMPLS procedures may be desirable to coordinate\n   the operation\
    \ and configuration of these OAM processes.\n   [ETH-OAM] describes some early\
    \ ideas for this function, but more work\n   is required to generalize the technique\
    \ to be applicable to all\n   technologies and to MLN.  In particular, an OAM\
    \ function operating\n   within a server layer must be controllable from the client\
    \ layer, and\n   client layer control plane mechanisms must map and enable OAM\
    \ in the\n   server layer.\n   Where a GMPLS-controlled technology does not contain\
    \ its own OAM\n   procedures, this is usually because the technology cannot support\n\
    \   in-band OAM (for example, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)\n   networks).\
    \  In these cases, there is very little that a control plane\n   can add to the\
    \ OAM function since the presence of a control plane\n   cannot make any difference\
    \ to the physical characteristics of the\n   data plane.  However, the existing\
    \ GMPLS protocol suite does provide\n   a set of tools that can help to verify\
    \ the data plane through the\n   control plane.  These tools are equally applicable\
    \ to network\n   technologies that do contain their own OAM.\n   - Route recording\
    \ is available through the GMPLS signaling protocol\n     [RFC3473], making it\
    \ possible to check the route reported by the\n     control plane against the\
    \ expected route.  This mechanism also\n     includes the ability to record and\
    \ report the interfaces and labels\n     used for the LSP at each hop of its path.\n\
    \   - The status of TE links is flooded by the GMPLS routing protocols\n     [RFC4203]\
    \ and [RFC4205] making it possible to detect changes in the\n     available resources\
    \ in the network as an LSP is set up.\n   - The GMPLS signaling protocol [RFC3473]\
    \ provides a technique to\n     place an LSP into a \"test\" mode so that end-to-end\
    \ characteristics\n     (such as power levels) may be sampled and modified.\n\
    \   - The Link Management Protocol [RFC4204] provides a mechanism for\n     fault\
    \ isolation on an LSP.\n   - GMPLS signaling [RFC3473] provides a Notify message\
    \ that can be\n     used to report faults and issues across the network.  The\
    \ message\n     includes scaling features to allow one message to report the\n\
    \     failure of multiple LSPs.\n   - Extensions to GMPLS signaling [RFC4783]\
    \ enable alarm information to\n     be collected and distributed along the path\
    \ of an LSP for more easy\n     coordination and correlation.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Advertisement of Adjustment Capacities\n   In the MRN context, nodes\
    \ supporting more than one switching\n   capability on at least one interface\
    \ are called hybrid nodes\n   [RFC5212].  Conceptually, hybrid nodes can be viewed\
    \ as containing at\n   least two distinct switching elements interconnected by\
    \ internal\n   links that provide adjustment between the supported switching\n\
    \   capabilities.  These internal links have finite capacities and must\n   be\
    \ taken into account when computing the path of a multi-region TE-\n   LSP.  The\
    \ advertisement of the adjustment capacities is required, as\n   it provides critical\
    \ information when performing multi-region path\n   computation.\n   The term\
    \ \"adjustment capacity\" refers to the property of a hybrid\n   node to interconnect\
    \ different switching capabilities it provides\n   through its external interfaces\
    \ [RFC5212].  This information allows\n   path computation to select an end-to-end\
    \ multi-region path that\n   includes links of different switching capabilities\
    \ that are joined by\n   LSRs that can adapt the signal between the links.\n \
    \  Figure 1a below shows an example of a hybrid node.  The hybrid node\n   has\
    \ two switching elements (matrices), which support TDM and PSC\n   switching,\
    \ respectively.  The node has two PSC and TDM ports (Port1\n   and Port2, respectively).\
    \  It also has an internal link connecting\n   the two switching elements.\n \
    \  The two switching elements are internally interconnected in such a\n   way\
    \ that it is possible to terminate some of the resources of the TDM\n   Port2;\
    \ also, they can provide adjustment of PSC traffic that is\n   received/sent over\
    \ the internal PSC interface (#b).  Two ways are\n   possible to set up PSC LSPs\
    \ (Port1 or Port2).  Available resources\n   advertisement (e.g., Unreserved and\
    \ Min/Max LSP Bandwidth) should\n   cover both ways.\n                       \

    \ Figure 1b.  Hybrid node.\n   Let's assume that all interfaces are STM16 (with\
    \ VC4-16c capable as\n   Max LSP bandwidth).  After setting up several PSC LSPs\
    \ via port #a\n   and setting up and terminating several TDM LSPs via port #d\
    \ and port\n   #b, a capacity of only 155 Mb is still available on port #b.\n\
    \   However, a 622 Mb capacity remains on port #a, and VC4-5c capacity\n   remains\
    \ on port #d.\n   When computing the path for a new VC4-4c TDM LSP, one must know\
    \ that\n   this node cannot terminate this LSP, as there is only a 155 Mb\n  \
    \ capacity still available for TDM-PSC adjustment.  Hence, the TDM-PSC\n   adjustment\
    \ capacity must be advertised.\n   With current GMPLS routing [RFC4202], this\
    \ advertisement is possible\n   if link bundling is not used and if two TE links\
    \ are advertised for\n   Link1.\n   We would have the following TE link advertisements:\n\
    \   TE link 1 (Port1):\n     - ISCD sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622\
    \ Mb\n     - Unreserved bandwidth = 622 Mb.\n   TE link 2 (Port2):\n     - ISCD\
    \ #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,\n     - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC\
    \ with Max LSP bandwidth = 155 Mb,\n     - Unreserved bandwidth (equivalent):\
    \ 777 Mb.\n   The ISCD #2 in TE link 2 actually represents the TDM-PSC adjustment\n\
    \   capacity.\n   However, if for obvious scalability reasons, link bundling is\
    \ done,\n   then the adjustment capacity information is lost with current GMPLS\n\
    \   routing, as we have the following TE link advertisement:\n   TE link 1 (Port1\
    \ + Port2):\n     - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,\n  \
    \   - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622 Mb,\n     - Unreserved\
    \ bandwidth (equivalent): 1399 Mb.\n   With such a TE link advertisement, an element\
    \ computing the path of a\n   VC4-4c LSP cannot know that this LSP cannot be terminated\
    \ on the\n   node.\n   Thus, current GMPLS routing can support the advertisement\
    \ of the\n   adjustment capacities, but this precludes performing link bundling\n\
    \   and thus faces significant scalability limitations.\n   Hence, GMPLS routing\
    \ must be extended to meet this requirement.  This\n   could rely on the advertisement\
    \ of the adjustment capacities as a new\n   TE link attribute (that would complement\
    \ the Interface Switching\n   Capability Descriptor TE link attribute).\n   Note:\
    \ Multiple ISCDs MAY be associated with a single switching\n   capability.  This\
    \ can be performed to provide (e.g., for TDM\n   interfaces) the Min/Max LSP Bandwidth\
    \ associated to each layer (or\n   set of layers) for that switching capability.\
    \  For example, an\n   interface associated to TDM switching capability and supporting\
    \ VC-12\n   and VC-4 switching can be associated to one ISCD sub-TLV or two ISCD\n\
    \   sub-TLVs.  In the first case, the Min LSP Bandwidth is set to VC-12\n   and\
    \ the Max LSP Bandwidth to VC-4.  In the second case, the Min LSP\n   Bandwidth\
    \ is set to VC-12 and the Max LSP Bandwidth to VC-12, in the\n   first ISCD sub-TLV;\
    \ and the Min LSP Bandwidth is set to VC-4 and the\n   Max LSP Bandwidth to VC-4,\
    \ in the second ISCD sub-TLV.  Hence, in the\n   first case, as long as the Min\
    \ LSP Bandwidth is set to VC-12 (and not\n   VC-4), and in the second case, as\
    \ long as the first ISCD sub-TLV is\n   advertised, there is sufficient capacity\
    \ across that interface to\n   setup a VC-12 LSP.\n"

    \   policies.\n   - It must be possible to enable end-to-end OAM on an upper-layer\
    \ LSP.\n     This function appears to the ingress LSP as normal LSP-based OAM\n\
    \     [GMPLS-OAM], but at layer boundaries, depending on the technique\n     used\
    \ to span the lower layers, client-layer OAM operations may need\n     to be mapped\
    \ to server-layer OAM operations ([RFC5212], Section\n     5.10).\n     o See\
    \ Section 3.1.5.2.\n   - Client-layer control plane mechanisms must map and enable\
    \ OAM in\n     the server layer ([RFC5212], Section 5.10).\n     o See Section\
    \ 3.1.5.2.\n   - OAM operation enabled for an LSP in a client layer must operate\
    \ for\n     that LSP along its entire length ([RFC5212], Section 5.10).\n    \
    \ o See Section 3.1.5.2.\n   - OAM function operating within a server layer must\
    \ be controllable\n     from the client layer.  Such control should be subject\
    \ to policy at\n     the layer boundary ([RFC5212], Section 5.10).\n     o This\
    \ is an implementation matter.\n   - The status of a server layer LSP must be\
    \ available to the client\n     layer.  This information should be configurable\
    \ to be automatically\n     notified to the client layer at the layer boundary,\
    \ and should be\n     subject to policy ([RFC5212], Section 5.10).\n     o This\
    \ is an implementation matter.\n   - Implementations may use standardized techniques\
    \ (such as MIB\n     modules) to convey status information between layers.\n \
    \    o This is an implementation matter.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC5212] sets out the security requirements\
    \ for operating a MLN or\n   MRN.  These requirements are, in general, no different\
    \ from the\n   security requirements for operating any GMPLS network.  As such,\
    \ the\n   GMPLS protocols already provide adequate security features.  An\n  \
    \ evaluation of the security features for GMPLS networks may be found\n   in [MPLS-SEC],\
    \ and where issues or further work is identified by that\n   document, new security\
    \ features or procedures for the GMPLS protocols\n   will need to be developed.\n\
    \   [RFC5212] also identifies that where the separate layers of a MLN/MRN\n  \
    \ are operated as different administrative domains, additional security\n   considerations\
    \ may be given to the mechanisms for allowing inter-\n   layer LSP setup.  However,\
    \ this document is explicitly limited to the\n   case where all layers under GMPLS\
    \ control are part of the same\n   administrative domain.\n   Lastly, as noted\
    \ in [RFC5212], it is expected that solution documents\n   will include a full\
    \ analysis of the security issues that any protocol\n   extensions introduce.\n"
