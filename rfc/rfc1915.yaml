    \ of RFC 1602 ...........    5\n1.  Variance\n1.1.  The Problem\n1.1.1.  History\n\
    \   The PPP Working group has developed two protocols, one to control\n   compression\
    \ on PPP links; the Compression Control Protocol (CCP),\n   documented in draft-ietf-pppext-compression-04.txt.\
    \ The second is the\n   Encryption Control Protocol (ECP), used to control encryption\
    \ on\n   serial links, documented in draft-ietf-pppext-encryption-03.txt.\n  \
    \ During the development of these protocols, the Motorola Corporation\n   informed\
    \ the IETF that they may infringe on certain patents held by\n   Motorola, specificlally\
    \ U.S. patents 5,245,614 and 5,130,993.\n   After development of the protocols\
    \ was completed, they were submitted\n   to the IESG for standardization. At this\
    \ point, because of the\n   outstanding patent claims, their progress was halted.\
    \ Per the\n   procedures of RFC 1602, the IESG Secretariat attempted to gain the\n\
    \   licenses required by RFC 1602. In particular, per section 5.6 of RFC\n   1602,\
    \ an attempt was made to acquire a form of the license and make\n   it publically\
    \ available via the Internet.\n   Motorola would prefer to provide a general statement\
    \ indicating that\n   licenses will be made available \"to any party under reasonable\
    \ terms\n   and conditions that are demonstrably free of unfair discrimination.\"\
    \n1.1.2.  Other Attempted Solutions\n   An attempt was made to have the PPP working\
    \ group develop revised\n   versions of CCP and ECP that would not infringe on\
    \ the patents. While\n   technically possible, the proposed technical changes\
    \ are viewed by\n   some members of the working group as much less technically\
    \ desireable\n   than the original CCP and ECP and, in fact, these members have\
    \ stated\n   quite clearly that they will implement the original CCP regardless\
    \ of\n   the protocol standardized by the working group or accepted by the\n \
    \  IESG. Note that while other members of the working group accepted the\n   proposed\
    \ changes, they did so more out of a sense that it was the\n   only viable alternative\
    \ rather than because of the alternative's\n   technical merits. In short, technical\
    \ changes did not meet with the\n   IETF's traditional benchmark of Rough Consensus.\n\
    1.2.  Variance to Procedures in RFC 1602\n   The variance to the procedures of\
    \ RFC 1602 are as follows.\n   Section 5.6 of RFC 1602 (relevant portions are\
    \ included as Appendix\n   B) requires that, to use proprietary technology in\
    \ an Internet\n   Standard, the holder of the technology 1) Agree to provide the\
    \ ISOC a\n   free license to use the technology and to grant to others a license\n\
    \   to use the technology on fair and non-discriminatory terms, 2) That a\n  \
    \ form of this license be made electronically available on the\n   Internet, and\
    \ 3) That anyone may execute this license by downloading\n   a copy of the form,\
    \ fulfilling its requirements, and mailing an\n   executed copy to the licenser.\
    \ Standards track documents are not\n   allowed to advance until these conditions\
    \ are met.\n   The variance proposed in this request would allow the CCP and ECP\
    \ to\n   advance onto the standards track without meeting the above\n   conditions.\
    \ All that the community would obtain would be an assurance\n   from the license\
    \ holder that it will make licenses available.\n1.3.  The Solution\n   Within\
    \ the Variance Procedure (published as RFC 1871), the IESG\n   grants a variance\
    \ on behalf of the PPP Working Group, to the\n   procedures of RFC 1602 to allow\
    \ the IESG to adopt the CCP and ECP as\n   originally developed. The IESG accepts\
    \ the statement by G.  David\n   Forney of Motorola, date 5 June 1995, (attached\
    \ as Appendix A) that\n   Motorola will make licenses available to use the technology\
    \ covered\n   by U.S. patents 5,245,614 and 5,130,993.\n1.4.  Perceived Benefits\n\
    \   The benefit to the community in adopting this procedure is that the\n   IESG\
    \ would then be able to standardize the CCP and ECP and the\n   community would\
    \ gain a standardized method of controlling data\n   compression and encryption\
    \ on PPP links. That this protocol has been\n   under development for well over\
    \ a year shows that the capabilities\n   provided by the protocol are needed in\
    \ the community.\n1.5.  Perceived Risks\n   This variance will raise the possibility\
    \ that licenses are not\n   granted in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. The\
    \ license holder,\n   if it were so inclined, could treat each request differently,\n\
    \   advancing some, delaying others, and so on. This would be counter to\n   the\
    \ IETF's long, honorable, and successful, tradition of openness and\n   equal\
    \ access to technology.\nSecurity Considerations\n   Security issues are not discussed\
    \ in this memo.\nAuthor's Address\n   Frank Kastenholz\n   FTP Software, Inc\n\

    \ RE: License agreement for CCP and ECP\nMessage-Id: <\"Macintosh */PRMD=MOT/ADMD=MOT/C=US/\"\
    @MHS>\nDear Mr. Coya:\n  Thank you for your e-mail message of June 1.\nMotorola\
    \ has had a license agreement for these patents available for\nsome time, and\
    \ has already provided it to several requesting\ncompanies.  It would be most\
    \ unusual, however, to attach such an\nagreement to a standard.  Providing contact\
    \ information should\nsuffice.  It could say something like this:\n***\nMotorola,\
    \ Inc. has advised the IETF that it holds two patents that it\nbelieves to be\
    \ essential to the CCP and ECP standards, U.S. 5,245,614\nand U.S.  5,130,993,\
    \ and has declared its willingness to make licenses\nto these patents available\
    \ to any party under reasonable terms and\nconditions that are demonstrably free\
    \ of unfair discrimination.\nParties interested in obtaining such a license may\
    \ contact:\nMr. John A. Fisher\nVice President and Intellectual Property Licensing\
    \ Counsel\nMotorola, Inc.\n1303 E. Algonquin Road\nSchaumburg, Ill. 60196\n***\n\
    \  I trust that this statement will be satisfactory.\n  Sincerely,\n  G. David\
    \ Forney, Jr.\n  Vice President\n3.  APPENDIX B -- Relevant Section of RFC 1602\n\
    5.6.  Assurances\nThe agreement on assurances set forth below will normally be\n\
    entered into between the owner of rights and ISOC at the time a\nstandards track\
    \ document in which proprietary rights are claimed\nreaches the \"Proposed Standard\"\
    \ stage of maturity:\n     This is an agreement between ______________(hereinafter\n\
    called \"Rights Holder\") and the Internet Society on behalf of\nitself and its\
    \ trustees, officers, employees, contractors and\nagents, the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board, Internet Engineering\nSteering Group, Internet Engineering Task Force,\
    \ and other task\nforces, committees and groups coordinated by the Internet Society\n\
    (hereinafter called \"ISOC\"), and for the benefit of all users of\nthe Internet\
    \ and users of any other networks which implement and\nuse Internet Standards\
    \ (hereinafter together with ISOC called\n\"Internet community\").  This agreement\
    \ takes effect when signed on\nbehalf of the Rights Holder and the Internet Society.\n\
    \     The Rights Holder represents that it has or will have rights\nin patent\
    \ applications, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and\nother proprietary rights\
    \ in various countries (hereinafter called\n\"Rights\") which may block or impede\
    \ the ability of the Internet\ncommunity to implement and operate under the standards\
    \ set forth\nin ISOC standards document ____,____, and ____(the listed\nstandards\
    \ and any similar or related standards now existing or\nlater developed are together\
    \ hereinafter called \"Standards\").  The\nRights as they presently exist are\
    \ listed on attached Schedule A.\nThe Rights Holder further agrees to review the\
    \ Rights listed in\nSchedule A from time to time, and, in particular, immediately\n\
    prior to the elevation of the Standards to the Internet Standard\nlevel of maturity\
    \ in accordance with the Internet Standards\nProcess, and to inform the Executive\
    \ Director of the Internet\nEngineering Task Force Secretariat promptly upon learning\
    \ of any\nnew Rights in the Standards that should be added to the list in\nSchedule\
    \ A.\n     The Rights Holder believes and affirms that it will derive\nbenefits\
    \ by permitting ISOC and the Internet community to\nimplement and operate under\
    \ the Standards without interference of\nany of the Rights.  The policy of ISOC\
    \ is not to propose, adopt,\nor continue to maintain the Standards unless written\
    \ assurances\nare given by the Rights Holder with respect to proprietary rights.\n\
    Accordingly, in consideration of the benefits noted above and\nother good and\
    \ valuable consideration, the Rights Holder makes the\nassurances set forth herein.\n\
    \     The Rights Holder grants to ISOC a cost-free, perpetual,\nnon-exclusive,\
    \ world-wide license under the Rights with respect to\nimplementing and operating\
    \ under the Standards.  The license\nextends to all activities of ISOC involving\
    \ the Standards without\nlimit, including the rights to reproduce, distribute,\
    \ propose,\ntest, develop, analyze, enhance, revise, adopt, maintain,\nwithdraw,\
    \ perform and display publicly, and prepare derivative\nworks in any form whatsoever\
    \ and in all languages, and to\nauthorize others to do so.  The Rights Holder\
    \ also grants ISOC\npermission to use the name and address of Rights Holder in\n\
    connection with the Standards.\n     The Rights Holder relinquishes any right\
    \ or claim in any\ntrade secret which is part of the Rights, and makes the trade\n\
    secrets available without restriction to the Internet community.\nThe Rights Holder\
    \ hereby acknowledges that ISOC assumes no\nobligation to maintain any confidentiality\
    \ with respect to any\naspect of the Standards, and warrants that the Standards\
    \ do not\nviolate the rights of others.\n     The Rights Holder assures ISOC that\
    \ the Rights Holder shall\ngrant to any member of the Internet community, as a\
    \ beneficiary of\nthis agreement, a non-exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license\n\
    under the Rights, with respect to operating under the Standards\nfor a reasonable\
    \ royalty and under other terms which are\nreasonable considering the objective\
    \ of ISOC to assure that all\nmembers of the Internet community will be able to\
    \ operate under\nthe Standards at a minimal cost.  The license discussed in this\n\
    paragraph shall permit the licensee to make, have made, test,\nenhance, implement,\
    \ and use methods, works, computer programs, and\nhardware as needed or desirable\
    \ for operating under the Standards.\nEvery license shall include a clause automatically\
    \ modifying the\nterms of the license to be as favorable as the terms of any other\n\
    license under the Rights previously or later granted by the Rights\nHolder.\n\
    \     A form of the license shall always be publicly accessible on\nthe Internet,\
    \ and shall become effective immediately when the\nmember of the Internet community\
    \ executes it and posts it for\ndelivery to the Rights Holder either by mail or\
    \ electronically.\nThe initial version of the license shall be in the form attached\n\
    as Schedule B.\n     The Rights Holder represents and warrants that its rights\
    \ are\nsufficient to permit it to grant the licenses and give the other\nassurances\
    \ recited in this agreement.  The Rights Holder further\nrepresents and warrants\
    \ that it does not know of any rights of any\nother party in any country which\
    \ would block or impede the ability\nof ISOC and the Internet community to implement\
    \ or operate under\nthe Standards, or that would prevent the Rights Holder from\n\
    granting the licenses and other assurances in this agreement.\n     This agreement\
    \ shall not be construed to obligate the ISOC to\npropose, adopt, develop, or\
    \ maintain any of the Standards or any\nother standard.\n"
