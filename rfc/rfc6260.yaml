  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a convention by which Delay-Tolerant\n\
    \   Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] \"convergence-layer\"\n  \
    \ adapters may represent endpoint identifiers (EIDs) in a compressed\n   form\
    \ within the primary blocks of bundles, provided those endpoint\n   identifiers\
    \ conform to the structure prescribed by this convention.\n   Each DTN bundle's\
    \ primary block contains the following four BP\n   endpoint identifiers, of which\
    \ any two, any three, or even all four\n   may be lexically identical: the endpoint\
    \ identifiers of the bundle's\n   source, destination, report-to endpoint, and\
    \ current custodian.  Each\n   EID is a Uniform Record Identifier (URI) as defined\
    \ by [RFC3986].\n   More specifically, each BP EID is a URI consisting of a \"\
    scheme name\"\n   followed by \":\", followed by a sequence of characters --\n\
    \   historically, termed the \"scheme-specific part\" (SSP) in DTN\n   specifications\
    \ -- conforming to URI syntax as defined by RFC 3986.\n   A degree of block compression\
    \ is provided by the design of the\n   primary block: the scheme names and scheme-specific\
    \ parts of the four\n   endpoints' IDs -- up to eight NULL-terminated strings\
    \ -- are\n   concatenated at the end of the block in a variable-length character\n\
    \   array called a \"dictionary\", enabling each EID to be represented by a\n\
    \   pair of integers indicating the offsets (within the dictionary) of\n   the\
    \ EID's scheme name and scheme-specific part.  Duplicate strings\n   may be omitted\
    \ from the dictionary, so the actual number of\n   concatenated NULL-terminated\
    \ strings in the dictionary may be less\n   than eight, and two or more of the\
    \ scheme name or scheme-specific\n   part offsets in the block may have the same\
    \ value.  Moreover, the\n   eight offsets in the primary block are encoded as\
    \ Self-Delimiting\n   Numeric Values (SDNVs), which shrink to fit the encoded\
    \ values; when\n   the total length of the dictionary is less than 127 bytes,\
    \ all eight\n   offsets can be encoded into just eight bytes.\n   However, these\
    \ strategems do not prevent the scheme names and\n   especially the scheme-specific\
    \ parts themselves from being lengthy\n   strings of ASCII text.  It is therefore\
    \ still possible for the length\n   of a bundle's primary header to be a very\
    \ large fraction of the total\n   length of the bundle when the bundle's payload\
    \ is relatively small,\n   as is anticipated for a number of DTN applications\
    \ such as space\n   flight operations (and as is in any case true of bundles carrying\
    \ BP\n   administrative records).\n   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE)\
    \ convention was developed\n   to improve DTN transmission efficiency for such\
    \ applications by\n   further reducing the number of bytes used by convergence-layer\n\
    \   adapters to represent EIDs in the primary blocks of bundles.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Constraints
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Constraints\n   The only valid scheme name for BP EIDs identified to date\
    \ is \"dtn\".\n   Although no specification of valid SSP syntax for URIs composed\n\
    \   within the \"dtn\" scheme has yet been formally defined, the syntax on\n \
    \  which rough agreement has been reached in practice is unsuitable for\n   CBHE's\
    \ compression procedures.  For the purposes of CBHE, then, this\n   document defines\
    \ an additional URI scheme named \"ipn\".  As noted in\n   Section 4, IANA has\
    \ registered this new URI scheme.\n   Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE)\
    \ is possible only when all\n   endpoint IDs in the primary block of a given bundle\
    \ are \"CBHE\n   conformant\".  The following two forms of endpoint ID are CBHE\n\
    \   conformant: (a) the null endpoint ID \"dtn:none\" and (b) any endpoint\n \
    \  ID formed within the \"ipn\" scheme.\n   The SSP of every URI formed within\
    \ the \"ipn\" scheme must comprise:\n   1.  A sequence of ASCII numeric digits\
    \ representing an integer in the\n       range 1 to (2^64 - 1), termed the \"\
    node number\" of the URI.\n   2.  An ASCII period ('.') character.\n   3.  A sequence\
    \ of ASCII numeric digits representing an integer in the\n       range 0 to (2^64\
    \ - 1), termed the \"service number\" of the URI.\n   The node number notionally\
    \ identifies a BP node.  However, since CBHE\n   is not used universally in Delay-Tolerant\
    \ Networking, it must not be\n   assumed that all BP nodes are identified by node\
    \ numbers.\n   Negative integers and integers larger than (2^64 - 1) cannot be\
    \ used\n   as node numbers because they cannot be encoded into the SDNVs that\n\
    \   are used for representation of scheme name and SSP offsets in the\n   primary\
    \ blocks of bundles and therefore could not be compressed as\n   described later\
    \ in this specification.  Node number zero is reserved\n   for representation\
    \ of the null endpoint ID in the compressed form\n   described later; decompressing\
    \ a compressed null EID must always\n   yield the standard null endpoint ID URI\
    \ \"dtn:none\".\n   The service number notionally functions as a de-multiplexing\
    \ token.\n   When the bundle payload is a protocol data unit of some protocol\
    \ that\n   has its own de-multiplexing identifiers, the service number may\n \
    \  function in a manner similar to that of the protocol number in an IP\n   packet,\
    \ characterizing the encapsulated protocol; alternatively, the\n   service number\
    \ may function in a manner similar to that of the port\n   number in a UDP datagram.\
    \  Service numbers enable inbound bundles'\n   application data units to be de-multiplexed\
    \ to instances of\n   application functionality that are designed to process them,\
    \ so that\n   effective communication relationships can be developed between bundle\n\
    \   producers and consumers.\n   A service number must not be negative or exceed\
    \ (2^64 - 1) for the\n   same reason that a node number must not do so.\n   For\
    \ example, \"ipn:9.37\" would be a CBHE-conformant endpoint ID.\n   Conversion\
    \ of a CBHE-conformant EID to and from a tuple of two\n   integers is therefore\
    \ straightforward: all characters in the EID\n   other than the node number and\
    \ service number are constant (as\n   defined by the \"ipn\" scheme definition),\
    \ and the node number and\n   service number are taken as the two integers of\
    \ the tuple.  This ease\n   of conversion enables an array of pairs of integers\
    \ to serve the same\n   function as a dictionary of ASCII string EIDs.\n   Note,\
    \ however, that CBHE decompression cannot faithfully recreate the\n   dictionary\
    \ of a compressed primary block from an array of integer\n   pairs unless the\
    \ order of the scheme names and scheme-specific part\n   strings in the dictionary\
    \ of the original, uncompressed block is\n   known.  (The Bundle Protocol Specification\
    \ does not require that the\n   strings in the dictionary appear in any particular\
    \ order and does not\n   require that redundant strings be omitted from the dictionary.)\n\
    \   Therefore, a further precondition to CBHE compression is that the\n   strings\
    \ in the dictionary of the bundle to be compressed must be\n   exactly as follows,\
    \ in this order and without addition:\n   1.  The scheme name of the destination\
    \ endpoint ID.\n   2.  The scheme-specific part of the destination endpoint ID.\n\
    \   3.  The scheme name of the source endpoint ID, if and only if\n       different\
    \ from any prior string in the dictionary.\n   4.  The scheme-specific part of\
    \ the source endpoint ID, if and only\n       if different from any prior string\
    \ in the dictionary.\n   5.  The scheme name of the report-to endpoint ID, if\
    \ and only if\n       different from any prior string in the dictionary.\n   6.\
    \  The scheme-specific part of the report-to endpoint ID, if and\n       only\
    \ if different from any prior string in the dictionary.\n   7.  The scheme name\
    \ of the current custodian endpoint ID, if and only\n       if different from\
    \ any prior string in the dictionary.\n   8.  The scheme-specific part of the\
    \ current custodian endpoint ID, if\n       and only if different from any prior\
    \ string in the dictionary.\n   Note: this constraint implies that a bundle that\
    \ includes any\n   extension blocks containing EID-references to endpoint IDs\
    \ other than\n   the block's destination, source, report-to, and current custodian\n\
    \   cannot be CBHE compressed since such compression would result in a\n   dictionary\
    \ that would deviate from this structure.\n"

    \ noted above, URIs of the IPN\n   scheme are encoded exclusively in US-ASCII\
    \ characters.\n   Security considerations:\n   o  Reliability and consistency:\
    \ none of the BP endpoints identified\n      by the URIs of the IPN scheme are\
    \ guaranteed to be reachable at\n      any time, and the identity of the processing\
    \ entities operating on\n      those endpoints is never guaranteed by the Bundle\
    \ Protocol itself.\n      Bundle authentication as defined by the Bundle Security\
    \ Protocol\n      is required for this purpose.\n   o  Malicious construction:\
    \ malicious construction of a conformant\n      IPN-scheme URI is limited to the\
    \ malicious selection of node\n      numbers and the malicious selection of service\
    \ numbers.  That is,\n      a maliciously constructed IPN-scheme URI could be\
    \ used to direct a\n      bundle to an endpoint that might be damaged by the arrival\
    \ of that\n      bundle or, alternatively, to declare a false source for a bundle\n\
    \      and thereby cause incorrect processing at a node that receives the\n  \
    \    bundle.  In both cases (and indeed in all bundle processing), the\n     \
    \ node that receives a bundle should verify its authenticity and\n      validity\
    \ before operating on it in any way.\n   o  Back-end transcoding: the limited\
    \ expressiveness of URIs of the\n      IPN scheme effectively eliminates the possibility\

    \ IPN-scheme URIs.\n   o  Sensitive information: because IPN-scheme URIs are used\

    \ of\n      disclosure of sensitive information due to interception of these\n\
    \      URIs is minimal.  Examination of IPN-scheme URIs could be used to\n   \
    \   support traffic analysis; where traffic analysis is a plausible\n      danger,\

    \ a bundle\n   that includes any extension blocks containing EID-references to\n\
    \   endpoint IDs other than the block's destination, source, report-to,\n   and\
    \ current custodian cannot be CBHE compressed, bundles cannot be\n   compressed\
    \ under those conditions.\n   Specifically, the specification detailed above implies\
    \ that a bundle\n   cannot be CBHE compressed when the security-source endpoint\
    \ for the\n   Bundle Authentication Block (BAB) is noted in the dictionary\n \
    \  (typically, because there is no other way for the receiving bundle\n   protocol\
