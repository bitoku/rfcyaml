- title: 1.  Introduction and Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Background\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) [1] [2] is a\
    \ widely deployed system\n   used, among other things, to translate host names\
    \ into IP addresses.\n   Several protocols use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)\
    \ to refer to\n   data.  By defining a URI scheme for DNS data, the gap between\
    \ these\n   two worlds is bridged.  The DNS URI scheme defined here can be used\n\
    \   to reference any data stored in the DNS.\n   Data browsers may support DNS\
    \ URIs by forming DNS queries and\n   rendering DNS responses using HTML [12],\
    \ which is similar to what is\n   commonly done for FTP [6] resources.  Applications\
    \ that are\n   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [7] aware may tag\
    \ DNS\n   data retrieved using this scheme with the text/dns or application/dns\n\
    \   types as specified in [15].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [3].\n"
- title: 2.  Usage Model
  contents:
  - "2.  Usage Model\n   Refer to section 1 of [5] for an in-depth discussion of URI\n\
    \   classifications.  In particular, the reader is assumed to be familiar\n  \
    \ with the distinction between \"name\" and \"locator\".  This section\n   describes\
    \ how the DNS URI scheme is intended to be used and outlines\n   future work that\
    \ may be required to use URIs with the DNS for some\n   applications.\n   The\
    \ URI scheme described in this document focuses on the data stored\n   in the\
    \ DNS.  As such, there is no provision to specify any of the\n   fields in the\
    \ actual DNS protocol.  This is intended so that the URI\n   may be used even\
    \ in situations where the DNS protocol is not used\n   directly.  Two examples\
    \ for this are zone file editors and DNS-\n   related configuration files, which\
    \ may use this URI scheme to\n   identify data.  The application would not use\
    \ the DNS protocol to\n   resolve the URIs.\n   A limitation of this design is\
    \ that it does not accommodate all\n   protocol parameters within the DNS protocol.\
    \  It is expected that,\n   for certain applications, a more detailed URI syntax\
    \ that maps more\n   closely to the DNS protocol may be required.  However, such\
    \ a URI\n   definition is not included in this document.  This document specifies\n\
    \   a URI that is primarily intended to name DNS resources, but it can\n   also\
    \ be used to locate said resources for simple, yet common,\n   applications.\n"
- title: 3.  DNS URI Registration
  contents:
  - "3.  DNS URI Registration\n   This section contains the registration template\
    \ for the DNS URI\n   scheme in accordance with [11].\n   URL scheme name: \"\
    dns\".\n   URL scheme syntax: A DNS URI designates a DNS resource record set,\n\
    \   referenced by domain name, class, type, and, optionally, the\n   authority.\
    \  The DNS URI follows the generic syntax from RFC 3986 [5]\n   and is described\
    \ using ABNF [4].  Strings are not case sensitive, and\n   free insertion of linear-white-space\
    \ is not permitted.\n   dnsurl          = \"dns:\" [ \"//\" dnsauthority \"/\"\
    \ ]\n                     dnsname [\"?\" dnsquery]\n   dnsauthority    = host\
    \ [ \":\" port ]\n                                ; See RFC 3986 for the\n   \
    \                             ; definition of \"host\" and \"port\".\n   dnsname\
    \         = *pchar\n                                ; See RFC 3986 for the\n \
    \                               ; definition of \"pchar\".\n                 \
    \               ; The \"dnsname\" field may be a\n                           \
    \     ; \"relative\" or \"absolute\" name,\n                                ;\
    \ as per RFC 1034, section 3.1.\n                                ; Note further\
    \ that an empty\n                                ; \"dnsname\" value is to be\n\
    \                                ; interpreted as the root itself.\n         \
    \                       ; See below on relative dnsnames.\n   dnsquery       \
    \ = dnsqueryelement [\";\" dnsquery]\n   dnsqueryelement = ( \"CLASS=\" dnsclassval\
    \ ) / ( \"TYPE=\" dnstypeval )\n                                ; Each clause\
    \ MUST NOT be used more\n                                ; than once.\n   dnsclassval\
    \     = 1*digit / \"IN\" / \"CH\" /\n                     <Any IANA registered\
    \ DNS class mnemonic>\n   dnstypeval      = 1*digit / \"A\" / \"NS\" / \"MD\"\
    \ /\n                     <Any IANA registered DNS type mnemonic>\n   Unless specified\
    \ in the URI, the authority (\"dnsauthority\") is\n   assumed to be locally known,\
    \ the class (\"dnsclassval\") to be the\n   Internet class (\"IN\"), and the type\
    \ (\"dnstypeval\") to be the Address\n   type (\"A\").  These default values match\
    \ the typical use of DNS: to\n   look up addresses for host names.\n   A dnsquery\
    \ element MUST NOT contain more than one occurrence of the\n   \"CLASS\" and \"\
    TYPE\" fields.  For example, both \"dns:\n   example?TYPE=A;TYPE=TXT\" and \"\
    dns:example?TYPE=A;TYPE=A\" are invalid.\n   However, the fields may occur in\
    \ any order, so that both \"dns:\n   example?TYPE=A;CLASS=IN\" and \"dns:example?CLASS=IN;TYPE=A\"\
    \ are valid.\n   The digit representation of types and classes MAY be used when\
    \ a\n   mnemonic for the corresponding value is not well known (e.g., for\n  \
    \ newly introduced types or classes), but it SHOULD NOT be used for the\n   types\
    \ or classes defined in the DNS specification [2].  All\n   implementations MUST\
    \ recognize the mnemonics defined in [2].\n   To avoid ambiguity, relative \"\
    dnsname\" values (i.e., those not ending\n   with \".\") are assumed to be relative\
    \ to the root.  For example, \"dns:\n   host.example\" and \"dns:host.example.\"\
    \ both refer to the same owner\n   name; namely, \"host.example.\".  Further,\
    \ an empty \"dnsname\" value is\n   considered a degenerative form of a relative\
    \ name, which refers to\n   the root (\".\").\n   To resolve a DNS URI using the\
    \ DNS protocol [2], a query is created,\n   using as input the dnsname, dnsclassval,\
    \ and dnstypeval from the URI\n   string (or the appropriate default values).\
    \  If an authority\n   (\"dnsauthority\") is given in the URI string, this indicates\
    \ the\n   server that should receive the DNS query.  Otherwise, the default DNS\n\
    \   server should receive it.\n   Note that DNS URIs could be resolved by other\
    \ protocols than the DNS\n   protocol, or by using the DNS protocol in some other\
    \ way than as\n   described above (e.g., multicast DNS).  DNS URIs do not require\
    \ the\n   use of the DNS protocol, although it is expected to be the typical\n\
    \   usage.  The previous paragraph only illustrates how DNS URIs are\n   resolved\
    \ using the DNS protocol.\n   A client MAY want to check that it understands the\
    \ dnsclassval and\n   dnstypeval before sending a query, so that it will be able\
    \ to\n   understand the response.  However, a typical example of a client that\n\
    \   would not need to check dnsclassval and dnstypeval would be a proxy\n   that\
    \ would just treat the received answer as opaque data.\n   Character encoding\
    \ considerations: Characters are encoded as per RFC\n   3986 [5].  The DNS protocol\
    \ does not consider character sets; it\n   simply transports opaque data.  In\
    \ particular, the \"dnsname\" field of\n   the DNS URI is to be considered an\
    \ internationalized domain name\n   (IDN) unaware domain name slot, in the terminology\
    \ of RFC 3940 [14].\n   The considerations for \"host\" and \"port\" are discussed\
    \ in [5].\n   Because \".\" is used as the DNS label separator, an escaping mechanism\n\
    \   is required to encode a \".\" that is part of a DNS label.  The\n   escaping\
    \ mechanism is described in section 5.1 of RFC 1035 [2].  For\n   example, a DNS\
    \ label of \"exa.mple\" can be escaped as \"exa\\.mple\" or\n   \"exa\\046mple\"\
    .  However, the URI specification disallows the \"\\\"\n   character from occurring\
    \ directly in URIs, so it must be escaped as\n   \"%5c\".  The single DNS label\
    \ \"exa.mple\" is thus encoded as \"exa%\n   5c.mple\".  The same mechanism can\
    \ be used to encode other characters,\n   for example, \"?\" and \";\".  Note\
    \ that \".\" and \"%2e\" are equivalent\n   within dnsname and are interchangeable.\n\
    \   This URI specification allows all possible domain names to be\n   encoded,\
    \ provided the encoding rules are observed per [5]).  However,\n   certain applications\
    \ may restrict the set of valid characters.  Care\n   should be taken so that\
    \ invalid characters in these contexts do not\n   cause harm.  In particular,\
    \ host names in the DNS have certain\n   restrictions.  It is up to these applications\
    \ to limit this subset;\n   this URI scheme places no restrictions.\n   Intended\
    \ usage: Whenever it is useful for DNS resources to be\n   referenced by protocol-independent\
    \ identifiers.  Often, this occurs\n   when the data is more important than the\
    \ access method.  Since\n   software in general has coped without this so far,\
    \ it is not\n   anticipated to be implemented widely, nor migrated to by existing\n\
    \   systems, but specific solutions (especially security-related) may\n   find\
    \ this appropriate.\n   Applications and/or protocols that use this scheme include\n\
    \   Security-related software, DNS administration tools, and network\n   programming\
    \ packages.\n   Interoperability considerations: The data referenced by this URI\n\
    \   scheme might be transferred by protocols that are not URI aware (such\n  \
    \ as the DNS protocol).  This is not anticipated to have any serious\n   interoperability\
    \ impact.\n   Interoperability problems may occur if one entity understands a\
    \ new\n   DNS class/type mnemonic that another entity does not.  This is an\n\
    \   interoperability problem for DNS software in general, although it is\n   not\
    \ a major practical problem for current DNS deployments, as the DNS\n   types\
    \ and classes are fairly static.  To guarantee interoperability,\n   implementations\
    \ can use integers for all mnemonics not defined in\n   [2].\n   Interaction with\
    \ Binary Labels [10] or other extended label types has\n   not been analyzed.\
    \  However, binary labels appear to be infrequently\n   used in practice.\n  \

  - "4.  Examples\n   A DNS URI is of the following general form.  This is intended\
    \ to\n   illustrate, not define, the scheme:\n   dns:[//authority/]domain[?CLASS=class;TYPE=type]\n\
    \   The following illustrates a URI for a resource with the absolute name\n  \
    \ \"www.example.org.\", the Internet (IN) class, and the Address (A)\n   type:\n\
    \   dns:www.example.org.?clAsS=IN;tYpE=A\n   Since the default class is IN and\
    \ the default type is A, the same\n   resource can be identified by a shorter\
    \ URI using a relative name:\n   dns:www.example.org\n   The following illustrates\
    \ a URI for a resource with the name\n   \"simon.example.org\" for the CERT type\
    \ in the Internet (IN) class:\n   dns:simon.example.org?type=CERT\n   The following\
    \ illustrates a URI for a resource with the name\n   \"ftp.example.org\", in the\
    \ Internet (IN) class and the address (A)\n   type, but from the DNS authority\
    \ 192.168.1.1 instead of the default\n   authority:\n   dns://192.168.1.1/ftp.example.org?type=A\n\
    \   The following illustrates various escaping techniques.  The owner\n   name\
    \ would be \"world wide web.example\\.domain.org\", where \"\\.\"\n   denotes\
    \ the character \".\" as part of a label, and \".\" denotes the\n   label separator:\n\
    \   dns:world%20wide%20web.example%5c.domain.org?TYPE=TXT\n   The following illustrates\
    \ a strange but valid DNS resource:\n   dns://fw.example.org/*.%20%00.example?type=TXT\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   If a DNS URI references domains in the Internet\
    \ DNS environment, both\n   the URI itself and the information referenced by the\
    \ URI is public\n   information.  If a DNS URI is used within an \"internal\"\
    \ DNS\n   environment, both the DNS URI and the data referenced should be\n  \
    \ handled using the same considerations that apply to DNS data in the\n   \"internal\"\
    \ environment.\n   If information referenced by DNS URIs are used to make security\n\
    \   decisions (such data includes, but is not limited to, certificates\n   stored\
    \ in the DNS [9]), implementations may need to employ security\n   techniques\
    \ such as Secure DNS [16], CMS [13], or OpenPGP [8], to\n   protect the data during\
    \ transport.  How to implement this will depend\n   on the usage scenario, and\
    \ it is not up to this URI scheme to define\n   how the data referenced by DNS\
    \ URIs should be protected.\n   If applications accept unknown dnsqueryelement\
    \ values in a URI (e.g.,\n   URI \"dns:www.example.org?secret=value\") without\
    \ knowing what the\n   \"secret=value\" dnsqueryelement means, a covert channel\
    \ used to \"leak\"\n   information may be enabled.  The implications of covert\
    \ channels\n   should be understood by applications that accept unknown\n   dnsqueryelement\
    \ values.\n   Slight variations, such as the difference between upper and lower\n\
    \   case in the dnsname field, can be used as a covert channel to leak\n   information.\n"
