  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 5104 by fixing a shortcoming in the\n\
    \   specification language of the Codec Control Message Full Intra\n   Request\
    \ (FIR) description when using it with layered codecs.  In\n   particular, a decoder\
    \ refresh point needs to be sent by a media\n   sender when a FIR is received\
    \ on any layer of the layered bitstream,\n   regardless of whether those layers\
    \ are being sent in a single or in\n   multiple RTP flows.  The other payload-specific\
    \ feedback messages\n   defined in RFC 5104 and RFC 4585 (which was updated by\
    \ RFC 5506) have\n   also been analyzed, and no corresponding shortcomings have\

  - "1.  Introduction and Problem Statement\n   The \"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time\
    \ Transport Control Protocol\n   (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)\" [RFC4585]\
    \ and \"Codec Control\n   Messages in the RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback\
    \ (AVPF)\"\n   [RFC5104] specify a number of payload-specific feedback messages\
    \ that\n   a media receiver can use to inform a media sender of certain\n   conditions\
    \ or to make certain requests.  The feedback messages are\n   being sent as RTCP\
    \ receiver reports, and RFC 4585 specifies timing\n   rules that make the use\
    \ of those messages practical for time-\n   sensitive codec control.\n   Since\
    \ the time those RFCs were developed, layered codecs have gained\n   in popularity\
    \ and deployment.  Layered codecs use multiple sub-\n   bitstreams called \"layers\"\
    \ to represent the content in different\n   fidelities.  Depending on the media\
    \ codec and its RTP payload format\n   in use, a number of options exist on how\
    \ to transport those layers in\n   RTP.  Summarizing \"A Taxonomy of Semantics\
    \ and Mechanisms for Real-\n   Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Sources\" [RFC7656]):\n\
    \      single layers or groups of layers may be sent in their own RTP\n      streams\
    \ in Multiple RTP streams on a Single media Transport (MRST)\n      or Multiple\
    \ RTP streams on Multiple media Transports (MRMT) mode;\n      using media-codec\
    \ specific multiplexing mechanisms, multiple\n      layers may be sent in a single\
    \ RTP stream in Single RTP stream on\n      a Single media Transport (SRST) mode.\n\
    \   The dependency relationship between layers in a truly layered,\n   pyramid-shaped\
    \ bitstream forms a directed graph, with the base layer\n   at the root.  Enhancement\
    \ layers depend on the base layer and\n   potentially on other enhancement layers,\
    \ and the target layer and all\n   layers it depends on have to be decoded jointly\
    \ in order to recreate\n   the uncompressed media signal at the fidelity of the\
    \ target layer.\n   Such a layering structure is assumed henceforth; for more\
    \ exotic\n   layering structures, please see Section 5.\n   Implementation experience\
    \ has shown that the Full Intra Request (FIR)\n   command as defined in [RFC5104]\
    \ is underspecified when used with\n   layered codecs and when more than one RTP\
    \ stream is used to transport\n   the layers of a layered bitstream at a given\
    \ fidelity.  In\n   particular, from the [RFC5104] specification language, it\
    \ is not\n   clear whether a FIR received for only a single RTP stream of multiple\n\
    \   RTP streams covering the same layered bitstream necessarily triggers\n   the\
    \ sending of a decoder refresh point (as defined in [RFC5104],\n   Section 2.2)\
    \ for all layers, or only for the layer that is\n   transported in the RTP stream\
    \ that the FIR request is associated\n   with.\n   This document fixes this shortcoming\
    \ by:\n   a.  Updating the definition of the decoder refresh point (as defined\n\
    \       in [RFC5104], Section 2.2) to cover layered codecs, in line with\n   \
    \    the corresponding definitions used in a popular layered codec\n       format,\
    \ namely H.264/SVC (Scalable Video Coding) [H.264].\n       Specifically, a decoder\
    \ refresh point, in conjunction with\n       layered codecs, resets the state\
    \ of the whole decoder, which\n       implies that it includes hard or gradual\
    \ single-layer decoder\n       refresh for all layers;\n   b.  Requiring a media\
    \ sender to send a decoder refresh point after\n       the media sender has received\
    \ a FIR over an RTCP stream\n       associated with any of the RTP streams over\
    \ which a part of the\n       layered bitstream is transported;\n   c.  Requiring\
    \ that a media receiver send the FIR on the RTCP stream\n       associated with\
    \ the base layer.  The option of receiving FIR on\n       the enhancement-layer-associated\
    \ RTCP stream as specified in\n       point b) above is kept for backward compatibility;\
    \ and\n   d.  Providing guidance on how to detect that a layered bitstream is\n\
    \       in use for which the above rules apply.\n   While, clearly, the reaction\
    \ to FIR for layered codecs in [RFC5104]\n   and the companion documents is underspecified,\
    \ it appears that this\n   is not the case for any of the other payload-specific\
    \ codec control\n   messages defined in [RFC4585] and [RFC5104].  A brief summary\
    \ of the\n   analysis that led to this conclusion is also included in this\n \
    \  document.\n"

- title: 3.  Updated Definition of Decoder Refresh Point
  contents:
  - "3.  Updated Definition of Decoder Refresh Point\n   The remainder of this section\
    \ replaces the definition of decoder\n   refresh point in Section 2.2 of [RFC5104]\
    \ in its entirety.\n   Decoder Refresh Point: A bit string, packetized in one\
    \ or more RTP\n   packets, that completely resets the decoder to a known state.\n\
    \   Examples for \"hard\" single-layer decoder refresh points are Intra\n   pictures\
    \ in H.261 [H.261], H.263 [H.263], MPEG-1 [MPEG-1], MPEG-2\n   [MPEG-2], and MPEG-4\
    \ [MPEG-4]; Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (IDR)\n   pictures in H.264 [H.264]\
    \ and H.265 [H.265]; and keyframes in VP8\n   [RFC6386] and VP9 [VP9-BITSTREAM].\
    \  \"Gradual\" decoder refresh points\n   may also be used; see, for example,\
    \ H.264 [H.264].  While both \"hard\"\n   and \"gradual\" decoder refresh points\
    \ are acceptable in the scope of\n   this specification, in most cases the user\
    \ experience will benefit\n   from using a \"hard\" decoder refresh point.\n \
    \  A decoder refresh point also contains all header information above\n   the\
    \ syntactical level of the picture layer that is conveyed in-band.\n   In [H.264],\
    \ for example, a decoder refresh point contains those\n   parameter set Network\
    \ Adaptation Layer (NAL) units that generate\n   parameter sets necessary for\
    \ the decoding of the following slice/data\n   partition NAL units.  (That is,\
    \ assuming the parameter sets have not\n   been conveyed out of band.)\n   When\
    \ a layered codec is in use, the above definition -- in\n   particular, the requirement\
    \ to completely reset the decoder to a\n   known state -- implies that the decoder\
    \ refresh point includes hard\n   or gradual single-layer decoder refresh points\
    \ for all layers.\n"
- title: 4.  Full Intra Request for Layered Codecs
  contents:
  - "4.  Full Intra Request for Layered Codecs\n   A media receiver or middlebox may\
    \ decide to send a FIR command based\n   on the guidance provided in Section 4.3.1\
    \ of [RFC5104].  When sending\n   the FIR command, it MUST target the RTP stream\
    \ that carries the base\n   layer of the layered bitstream, and this is done by\
    \ setting the\n   Feedback Control Information (FCI) (and, in particular, the\n\
    \   synchronization source (SSRC) field therein) to refer to the SSRC of\n   the\
    \ forward RTP stream that carries the base layer.\n   When a Full Intra Request\
    \ command is received by the designated media\n   sender in the RTCP stream associated\
    \ with any of the RTP streams in\n   which any layer of a layered bitstream are\
    \ sent, the designated media\n   sender MUST send a decoder refresh point (Section\
    \ 3) as defined above\n   at its earliest opportunity.  The requirements related\
    \ to congestion\n   control on the forward RTP streams as specified in Sections\
    \ 3.5.1 and\n   5 of [RFC5104] apply for the RTP streams both in isolation and\n\
    \   combined.\n   Note: the requirement to react to FIR commands associated with\n\
    \   enhancement layers is included for robustness and backward-\n   compatibility\
    \ reasons.\n"
- title: 5.  Identifying the Use of Layered Bitstreams (Informative)
  contents:
  - "5.  Identifying the Use of Layered Bitstreams (Informative)\n   The above modifications\
    \ to RFC 5104 unambiguously define how to deal\n   with FIR commands when layered\
    \ bitstreams are in use.  However, it is\n   surprisingly difficult to identify\
    \ the use of a layered bitstream.\n   In general, it is expected that implementers\
    \ know when layered\n   bitstreams (in its commonly understood sense: with inter-layer\n\
    \   prediction between pyramid-arranged layers) are in use and when not\n   and\
    \ can therefore implement the above updates to RFC 5104 correctly.\n   However,\
    \ there are scenarios in which layered codecs are employed\n   creating non-pyramid-shaped\
    \ bitstreams.  Those scenarios may be\n   viewed as somewhat exotic today but\
    \ clearly are supported by certain\n   video coding syntaxes, such as H.264/SVC.\
    \  When blindly applying the\n   above rules to those non-pyramid-arranged layering\
    \ structures,\n   suboptimal system behavior would result.  Nothing would break,\
    \ and\n   there would not be an interoperability failure, but the user\n   experience\
    \ may suffer through the sending or receiving of decoder\n   refresh points at\
    \ times or on parts of the bitstream that are\n   unnecessary from a user experience\
    \ viewpoint.  Therefore, this\n   informative section is included that provides\
    \ the current\n   understanding of when a layered bitstream is in use and when\
    \ not.\n   The key observation made here is that the RTP payload format\n   negotiated\
    \ for the RTP streams, in isolation, is not necessarily an\n   indicator for the\
    \ use of a layered bitstream.  Some layered codecs\n   (including H.264/SVC) can\
    \ form decodable bitstreams including only\n   (one or more) enhancement layers,\
    \ without the base layer, effectively\n   creating simulcastable sub-bitstreams\
    \ within a single scalable\n   bitstream (as defined in the video coding standard),\
    \ but without\n   inter-layer prediction.  In such a scenario, it is potentially,\n\
    \   though not necessarily, counterproductive to send a decoder refresh\n   point\
    \ on all layers for that payload format and media source.  It is\n   beyond the\
    \ scope of this document to discuss optimized reactions to\n   FIRs received on\
    \ RTP streams carrying such exotic bitstreams.\n   One good indication of the\
    \ likely use of pyramid-shaped layering with\n   inter-layer prediction is when\
    \ the various RTP streams are \"bound\"\n   together on the signaling level. \
    \ In an SDP environment, this would\n   be the case if they are marked as being\
    \ dependent on each other using\n   \"The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping\
    \ Framework\" [RFC5888]\n   and layer dependency [RFC5583].\n"

    \ TSTR request communicates guidance of the\n   preferred trade-off between spatial\
    \ quality and frame rate.  A\n   technical equivalent of TSTR/TSTN has seen deployment\
    \ for many years\n   in non-scalable systems.\n   TSTR and TSTN messages include\
    \ an SSRC target, which, similarly to\n   FIR, may refer to an RTP stream carrying\
    \ a base layer, an enhancement\n   layer, or multiple layers.  Therefore, the\
    \ current understanding is\n   that the semantics of the message applies to the\
    \ layers present in\n   the targeted RTP stream.\n   It is noted that per-layer\
    \ TSTR/TSTN is a mechanism that is, in some\n   ways, counterproductive in a system\
    \ using layered codecs.  Given a\n   sufficiently complex layered bitstream layout,\
    \ a sending system has\n   flexibility in adjusting the spatio/temporal quality\

    \ structure accordingly -- which can involve more than\n   just the addressed\
    \ RTP stream.\n   Until there is a sufficient critical mass of implementation\
    \ practice,\n   it is probably prudent for an implementer not to assume either\
    \ of the\n   two options or any middle ground that may exist between the two.\n\
    \   Instead, it is suggested that an implementation be liberal in\n   accepting\
    \ TSTR messages and upon receipt, responding in TSTN\n   indicating \"no change\"\
    .  Further, it is suggested that new\n   implementations do not send TSTR messages\
    \ except when operating in\n   SRST mode as defined in [RFC7656].  Finally, implementers\
