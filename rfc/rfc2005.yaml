  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Protocol Overview\n   Mobile IP provides an efficient, scalable mechanism
    for node mobility\n   within the Internet.  Using Mobile IP, nodes may change
    their point-\n   of-attachment to the Internet without changing their IP address.\n
    \  This allows them to maintain transport and higher-layer connections\n   while
    moving.  Node mobility is realized without the need to\n   propagate host-specific
    routes throughout the Internet routing\n   fabric.  The protocol is documented
    in [MIP-PROTO].\n   In brief, Mobile IP routing works as follows.  Packets destined
    to a\n   mobile node are routed first to its home network -- a network\n   identified
    by the network prefix of the mobile node's (permanent)\n   home address.  At the
    home network, the mobile node's home agent\n   intercepts such packets and tunnels
    them to the mobile node's most\n   recently reported care-of address.  At the
    endpoint of the tunnel,\n   the inner packets are decapsulated and delivered to
    the mobile node.\n   In the reverse direction, packets sourced by mobile nodes
    are routed\n   to their destination using standard IP routing mechanisms.\n   Thus,
    Mobile IP relies on protocol tunneling to deliver packets to\n   mobile nodes
    that are away from their home network.  The mobile\n   node's home address is
    hidden from routers along the path from the\n   home agent to the mobile node
    due to the presence of the tunnel.  The\n   encapsulating packet is destined to
    the mobile node's care-of address\n   -- a topologically significant address --
    to which standard IP\n   routing mechanisms can deliver packets.\n   The Mobile
    IP protocol defines the following:\n   - an authenticated registration procedure
    by which a mobile node\n     informs its home agent(s) of its care-of address(es);\n
    \  - an extension to ICMP Router Discovery [RFC1256] which allows mobile\n     nodes
    to discover prospective home agents and foreign agents; and\n   - the rules for
    routing packets to and from mobile nodes, including\n     the specification of
    one mandatory tunneling mechanism ([MIP-IPinIP])\n     and several optional tunneling
    mechanisms ([MIP-MINENC] and\n     [RFC1701]).\n"

  - "2. Applicability\n   Mobile IP is intended to solve node mobility across changes
    in IP\n   subnet.  It is just as suitable for mobility across homogeneous media\n
    \  as it is for mobility across heterogeneous media.  That is, Mobile IP\n   facilitates
    node movement from one Ethernet segment to another as\n   well as it accommodates
    node movement from an Ethernet segment to a\n   wireless LAN.\n   One can think
    of Mobile IP as solving the \"macro\" mobility management\n   problem.  It is
    less well suited for more \"micro\" mobility management\n   applications -- for
    example, handoff amongst wireless transceivers,\n   each of which covers only
    a very small geographic area.  In this\n   later situation, link-layer mechanisms
    for link maintenance (i.e.\n   link-layer handoff) might offer faster convergence
    and less overhead\n   than Mobile IP.\n   Mobile IP scales to handle a large number
    of mobile nodes in the\n   Internet.  Without route optimization as described
    in [MIP-OPTIM],\n   however, the home agent is a potential load point when serving
    many\n   mobile nodes.  When home agents become overburdened, additional home\n
    \  agents can be added -- and even dynamically discovered by mobile\n   nodes
    -- using mechanisms defined in the Mobile IP documents.\n   Finally, it is noted
    that mobile nodes are assigned (home) IP\n   addresses largely the same way in
    which stationary hosts are assigned\n   long-term IP addresses; namely, by the
    authority who owns them.\n   Properly applied, Mobile IP allows mobile nodes to
    communicate using\n   only their home address regardless of their current location.
    \ Mobile\n   IP, therefore, makes no attempt to solve the problems related to\n
    \  local or global, IP address, renumbering.\n"

  - "3. Security\n   Mobile IP mandates the use of cryptographically strong authentication\n
    \  for all registration messages exchanged between a mobile node and its\n   home
    agent.  Optionally, strong authentication can be used between\n   foreign agents
    and mobile nodes or home agents.  Replay protection is\n   realized via one of
    two possible mechanisms -- timestamps or nonces.\n   Due to the unavailability
    of an Internet key management protocol,\n   agent discovery messages are not required
    to be authenticated.\n   All Mobile IP implementations are required to support,
    at a minimum,\n   keyed MD5 authentication with manual key distribution.  Other\n
    \  authentication and key distribution algorithms may be supported.\n   Mobile
    IP defines security mechanisms only for the registration\n   protocol.  Implementations
    requiring privacy and/or authentication of\n   data packets sent to and from a
    mobile node should use the IP\n   security protocols described in RFCs 1827 and
    1826 for this purpose.\n"

    23-27, 1995 in which\n   interoperability of several implementations was demonstrated.
    \ The\n   following major features of the Mobile IP protocol were tested:\n   1)
    \ Mobile Nodes receiving and processing Agent Advertisements.\n   2)  Agents receiving
    Agent Solicitations and responding with Agent\n       Advertisements.\n   3)  Mobile
    Nodes registering with foreign agents on foreign networks.\n   4)  Packets being
    received by the mobile node after having been\n       tunneled by the home agent
    and de-tunneled by the foreign agent.\n   5)  Packets from the mobile node being
    routed directly to their\n       destinations.\n   6)  Mobile nodes discovering
    that their connectivity/subnet had\n       changed and re-registering at their
    new location.\n   7)  Mobile nodes discovering that their current foreign agent
    had\n       rebooted and therefore re-registering with that foreign agent.\n   8)
    \ The required form of tunneling (IP-in-IP encapsulation\n       [MIP-IPinIP])
    as well as the one of the optional forms of tunneling;\n       namely, Minimal
    Encapsulation [MIP-MINENC].\n   9)  Mobile nodes de-registering upon returning
    to their home network.\n   10) Registrations being rejected for authentication
    failures,\n       including invalid authenticators as well as mismatched\n       identification
    values (replay protection).\n   11) TCP connections remaining open (with data
    flowing) while a mobile\n       node moved from its home network to a foreign
    network and then\n       back again to the home network.\n   Interoperability
    of at least two independent implementations was\n   demonstrated for all of the
    features listed above.\n"

    \  that the Mobile IP working group has satisfied the requirements set\n   forth
    in [RFC1264] for the advancement of Mobile IP to Proposed\n   Standard RFC.  Specifically,
    the technical specification document is\n   stable, a MIB has been written, the
    security architecture has been\n   set forth in accordance with IAB principles,
    and several independent\n   implementations have been demonstrated to be interoperable.\n"
