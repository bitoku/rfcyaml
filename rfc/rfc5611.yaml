  - "2.  L2TPv3 Extensions\n   The L2TPv3 Control Connection is responsible for 3
    main operations:\n   1. Establishment and validation of a pseudowire (PW) session.\n
    \  2. Ending (tearing down) of a pseudowire session.\n   3. Transferring of End
    Point status.\n   Tearing down of the session for a TDM pseudowire is performed\n
    \  following the L2TPv3 tear-down operations as described in Section\n   3.4.3
    of [RFC3931].\n   [RFC5086] and [RFC4553] describe how to transfer the Attachment\n
    \  Circuit (AC) status via the data plane.  Therefore, the Set-Link-Info\n   (SLI)
    message described in [RFC3931] SHOULD NOT be used for conveying\n   this status
    for the PWs in question.\n   [RFC3931] specifies that the Circuit Status Attribute-Value
    Pair\n   (AVP) MUST be present in the ICRQ/ICRP (Incoming-Call-Request /\n   Incoming-Call-Reply)
    messages.  It also specifies that the N bit in\n   this AVP should be set during
    the PW setup, even if the specific AC\n   does not provide any way to convey the
    \"new AC\" indication.\n   Accordingly, the Circuit Status AVP for the PWs in
    question, when\n   used in the ICRQ/ICRP messages, MUST always have both N and
    A bits\n   set.\n   The next sections describe the extensions to L2TPv3 for establishment\n
    \  and validation of TDM pseudowire sessions.\n   There are two new AVPs for the
    Session Management messages.  One AVP\n   describes the TDM pseudowire attributes.
    \ The second AVP describes\n   the RTP attributes for this TDM pseudowire.\n"

      Bit Rate field contains the value that represents the bit rate of\n   the local
      AC in the units of 64 Kbit/s, encoded as an unsigned 16-bit\n   integer.  Its
      usage for all types of TDM PWs employs the following\n   semantics:\n   1) For
      structure-agnostic emulation, this parameter MUST be set to\n      one of the
      following values (see [RFC4553]):\n      a) Structure-agnostic E1 emulation

      T3 emulation  - 699\n   2) For CESoPSN PWs, this parameter MUST be set to the
      number of DS0\n      channels in the corresponding attachment circuit.\n   Note:
      For structure-agnostic T1 emulation, the values 24 and 25 do\n   not reflect
      the exact bit rate and are used for convenience only.\n   Note: The semantics
      of the Bit Rate field defined above are\n   consistent with those of the CEP/TDM
      Bit-Rate interface parameter as\n   defined in [RFC5287].\n   The Payload Bytes
      field contains the value representing the number of\n   TDM payload bytes in
      the PW packet and is used with the following\n   semantics:\n   1) For structure-agnostic
      emulation, any value of the Payload Bytes\n      can be specified.\n   2) For
      CESoPSN PWs:\n      a) The specified value MUST be an integer multiple of the
      number\n         of DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment circuit.\n
      \     b) In addition to that, for trunk-specific NxDS0 with Channel-\n         Associated
      Signaling (CAS), the number of the trunk frames per\n         multiframe fragment
      (value resulting from the Payload Bytes\n         divided by the number of DS0
      channels) MUST be an integer\n         divisor of the number of frames per corresponding
      trunk\n         multiframe.\n   The Reserved bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission
      and MUST be\n   ignored on reception.\n   The SP bits define support for the
      CESoPSN-application signaling\n   packets (see [RFC5086]) and MUST be used as
      follows:\n   1) Set to '01' for the CESoPSN PWs carrying TDM data packets and\n
      \     expecting CE application signaling packets in a separate PW.\n   2) Set
      to '10' for a PW carrying CE application signaling packets\n      with the data
      packets in a separate PW.\n   3) Set to '11' for a CESoPSN PW carrying both
      TDM data and signaling\n      packets.\n   4) Set to '00' for Structure-Agnostic
      Time-Division Multiplexing over\n      Packet (SAToP) PWs and for CESoPSN PWs
      not using separate\n      signaling packets.\n   The CAS bits define the trunk
      type for trunk-specific CESoPSN\n   services with CAS.  These bits MUST be set
      to:\n   1) For trunk-specific CESoPSN with CAS:\n      a) '01' in the case of
      an E1 trunk\n      b) '10' in the case of a T1/ESF trunk\n      c) '11' in the

      directions of a TDM PW.  This AVP MAY be hidden\n   (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).
      \ The M bit for this AVP SHOULD be set to\n   0.  The Length (before hiding)
      of this AVP is 16.\n   The D bit indicates the timestamping mode (absolute or
      differential)\n   in the RTP header.  These modes are described in, e.g., Section
      4.3.2\n   of [RFC4553].  If the D bit is set to 1, then the differential\n   timestamping
      mode is used; otherwise, the absolute timestamping mode\n   is used.  Timestamping
      modes can be used independently for the two\n   directions of a TDM PW.\n   The
      C bit indicates the ordering of the RTP header and the Control\n   Word as following:\n
      \  o If the C bit is set to 1, the RTP header appears after the Control\n     Word
      in the data channel of the TDM pseudowire.  This mode is\n     described in
      [RFC4553] and [RFC5086] as SAToP/CESoPSN encapsulation\n     over IPv4/IPv6
      PSN with L2TPv3 demultiplexing, respectively.\n   o If the C bit is set to 0,
      the RTP header appears before the Control\n     Word.  This mode is described
      as the old mode of the SAToP/CESoPSN\n     encapsulation over L2TPv3 in Appendix
      A of [RFC4553] and Appendix C\n     of [RFC5086], respectively.\n   PT is the
      payload type expected in the RTP header.  A value of 0\n   indicates that the
      receiver shall not check payload type to detect\n   malformed packets.\n   Timestamp
      Clock Frequency is the clock frequency used for\n   timestamping in units of
      8 KHz.\n   SSRC indicates the expected value of the synchronization source\n
      \  (SSRC) ID in the RTP header.  A 0 in this field means that the SSRC\n   ID
      will not be used for detecting misconnections.  Since L2TP\n   provides an alternative
      security mechanism using cookies, if the\n   cookie length is larger than 0,
      the SSRC SHOULD be 0.\n"

  - "3.  Creation of the TDM Pseudowire Session\n   When an L2TP Control Connection
    Endpoint (LCCE) wants to open a\n   Session for a TDM PW, it MUST include the
    TDM PW AVP (in any case)\n   and the RTP AVP (if and only if the RTP header is
    used) in the ICRQ\n   or OCRQ (Outgoing-Call-Request) message.  The LCCE peer
    must validate\n   the TDM PW AVP and make sure it can meet the requirements derived\n
    \  from the RTP AVP (if it exists).  If the peer agrees with the TDM\n   AVP,
    it will send an appropriate ICRP or OCRP (Outgoing-Call-Reply)\n   message with
    the matching RTP AVP (if needed).  The initiator needs\n   to validate that it
    can supply the requirements derived from the\n   received RTP AVP.\n   The two
    peers MUST agree on the values in the TDM PW AVP:\n   1. Bit Rate values MUST
    be equal on both sides.  If they are\n      different, the connection will be
    rejected with Result Code 30 and\n      Error Code 1.\n   2. In the case of trunk-specific
    CESoPSN with CAS, the trunk type (as\n      encoded in the CAS bits of the TDM
    AVP) MUST be the same for the\n      two sides.  Otherwise, the connection will
    be rejected with Result\n      Code 30 and Error Code 2.\n   3. If one side does
    not support the Payload Bytes value proposed by\n      the other one, the connection
    will be rejected with Result Code 30\n      and Error Code 3.\n   4. If one side
    cannot send the RTP header as requested by the other\n      side, the connection
    will be rejected with Result Code 30 and\n      Error Code 4.\n   5. If one side
    can send the RTP header but not with the requested\n      timestamp clock frequency,
    the connection will be rejected with\n      Result Code 30 and Error Code 5.\n
    \  If CE signaling for a CESoPSN basic PW is transported in a separate\n   PW
    instance, then the two PW instances:\n   1. MUST use the same PW type.\n   2.
    MUST use the same values in all the fields of the TDM AVP\n      excluding the
    SP field, which must be set to '01' for the TDM data\n      PW and to '10' for
    the PW carrying CE application signaling.\n   3. MUST both either use or not use
