GUIDELINES FOR THE SPECIFICATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN SPECIFIC PART (DSP) OF THE ISO STANDARD NSAP ADDRESS
There is a substantial amount of interest in providing guidance to private address administration authorities on preferred formats and semantics for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP address.
In particular it is felt that use of a limited number of preferred DSP formats would allow organizations to easily use intermediate and end systems from a variety of suppliers.
This technical report specifies the way in which the DSP may be constructed so as to facilitate efficient address assignment.
1.  Scope and Field of Application
This Technical Report specifies a recommended syntax  and interpretation for the Domain Specific Part of an NSAP address.
NSAP Address Administration Authorities are urged to use this format when the equipment comprising an addressing domain is of a heterogeneous nature.
This section to be suppled) 4.
Abbreviations (This section to be supplied) 5.
This section provides a summary of the major points contained in DIS 8348/DAD2, as they are relevant to this technical report.
Network addresses are defined to be hierarchical.
An authority may either assign a complete address, or else may identify a subdomain of its own addressing domain within which addresses may be further assigned by an identified authority for the subdomain.
This is done in such a way that all addresses are unique.
When an authority identifies a subdomain, this creates in effect a prefix which applies to all addresses assigned within the subdomain.
Certain methods of assigning authority are recognized within the body of DIS 8348/DAD 2.
These take account of existing addressing standards such as X.121.
The abstract structure of an address is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1:  NSAP Address Structure
The components of this structure are as follows.
This is the part of the address whose entire content is standardized.
It consists of two parts, the AFI and the IDI.
AFI:  Authority and Format Identifier
This specifies the format of the IDI, the authority responsible for allocating IDI values, and the syntax of the DSP.
This identifies the subdomain from which DSP values are allocated, and the authority responsible for allocating the values.
The contents and semantics of the DSP are not specified in DIS 8348/DAD2.
Its abstract syntax is however defined by the AFI.
In most cases, this means that the DSP abstract syntax can be either binary or decimal.
IDI formats specified in DIS 8348/
DAD2 identify a number of authorities for IDI allocation.
These are: 1.  X.121 (Public data network numbering)
April 1986 ANSI Guidelines 3.
ISO DCC (Geographical address assignment under ISO authority.
A subset of the DCC values used in X.121 have been used to designate the national addressing authorities)
ICD (Non geographic address assignment under ISO authority,
using the International Code Designators according to ISO 6523) 7.
Local (the IDI is null and the entire address is contained in the DSP).

Recommendations 7.1  X.121 DSP format guidelines Description of Binary syntax
The length of the DSP can be determined since the total address length is known, and the IDP has fixed length for any given AFI value.
If DSP is present, a DSP of 2 or less octets is an NSAP selector.
between 3 and 9 octets is interpreted in the manner described below.
The length of the subnetwork identification is fixed at two octets  (16  bits).
