- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DKIM [RFC6376] signs email messages by creating hashes of\
    \ the message\n   headers and content and signing the header hash with a digital\n\
    \   signature.  Message recipients fetch the signature verification key\n   from\
    \ the DNS where it is stored in a TXT record.\n   The defining documents, RFC\
    \ 6376 [RFC6376] and its predecessors,\n   specify a single signing algorithm,\
    \ RSA [RFC8017], and recommend key\n   sizes of 1024 to 2048 bits (but require\
    \ verification of 512-bit\n   keys).  As discussed in US-CERT Vulnerability Note\
    \ VU#268267\n   [VULNOTE], the operational community has recognized that shorter\
    \ keys\n   compromise the effectiveness of DKIM.  While 1024-bit signatures are\n\
    \   common, stronger signatures are not.  Widely used DNS configuration\n   software\
    \ places a practical limit on key sizes, because the software\n   only handles\
    \ a single 256-octet string in a TXT record, and RSA keys\n   significantly longer\
    \ than 1024 bits don't fit in 256 octets.\n   Due to the recognized weakness of\
    \ the SHA-1 hash algorithm (see\n   [RFC6194]) and the wide availability of the\
    \ SHA-256 hash algorithm\n   (it has been a required part of DKIM [RFC6376] since\
    \ it was\n   originally standardized in 2007), the SHA-1 hash algorithm MUST NOT\n\
    \   be used.  This is being done now to allow the operational community\n   time\
    \ to fully shift to SHA-256 in advance of any SHA-1-related\n   crisis.\n"

  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\

    \ they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Updates to DKIM Signing and Verification Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Updates to DKIM Signing and Verification Requirements\n   This document updates\
    \ [RFC6376] as follows:\n   o  Section 3.1 of this document updates Section 3.3\
    \ of [RFC6376].\n   o  Section 3.2 of this document updates Section 3.3.3 of [RFC6376].\n\
    \   o  The algorithm described in Section 3.3.1 of [RFC6376] is now\n      historic\
    \ and no longer used by DKIM.\n   Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 of [RFC6376] are not\
    \ affected.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Signing and Verification Algorithms
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Signing and Verification Algorithms\n   DKIM supports multiple digital\
    \ signature algorithms.  Two algorithms\n   are defined by this specification\
    \ at this time: rsa-sha1 and\n   rsa-sha256.  Signers MUST sign using rsa-sha256.\
    \  Verifiers MUST be\n   able to verify using rsa-sha256.  rsa-sha1 MUST NOT be\
    \ used for\n   signing or verifying.\n   DKIM signatures identified as having\
    \ been signed with historic\n   algorithms (currently, rsa-sha1) have permanently\
    \ failed evaluation\n   as discussed in Section 3.9 of [RFC6376].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Key Sizes\n   Selecting appropriate key sizes is a trade-off between cost,\n\
    \   performance, and risk.  Since short RSA keys more easily succumb to\n   off-line\
    \ attacks, Signers MUST use RSA keys of at least 1024 bits for\n   all keys. \
    \ Signers SHOULD use RSA keys of at least 2048 bits.\n   Verifiers MUST be able\
    \ to validate signatures with keys ranging from\n   1024 bits to 4096 bits, and\
    \ they MAY be able to validate signatures\n   with larger keys.  Verifier policies\
    \ can use the length of the\n   signing key as one metric for determining whether\
    \ a signature is\n   acceptable.  Verifiers MUST NOT consider signatures using\
    \ RSA keys of\n   less than 1024 bits as valid signatures.\n   DKIM signatures\
    \ with insufficient key sizes (currently, rsa-sha256\n   with less than 1024 bits)\
    \ have permanently failed evaluation as\n   discussed in Section 3.9 of [RFC6376].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not change the Security Considerations\
    \ of\n   [RFC6376].  It reduces the risk of signature compromise due to weak\n\
    \   cryptography.  The SHA-1 risks discussed in Section 3 of [RFC6194]\n   are\
    \ resolved due to rsa-sha1 no longer being used by DKIM.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the Reference and Status fields\
    \ of the \"sha1\"\n   registration in the \"DKIM Hash Algorithms\" registry. \
    \ The\n   registration now appears as follows:\n                 +------+---------------------+----------+\n\
