- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form)\
    \ supports US-\n   ASCII string literals.  The matching of these literals is done\
    \ in a\n   case-insensitive manner.  While this is often the desired behavior,\n\
    \   in some situations, case-sensitive matching of string literals is\n   needed.\
    \  Literals for case-sensitive matching must be specified using\n   the numeric\
    \ representation of those characters, which is inconvenient\n   and error prone\
    \ both to write and read.\n   This document extends ABNF to have two different\
    \ types of US-ASCII\n   string literals.  One type is matched using case-sensitive\
    \ matching,\n   while the other is matched using case-insensitive matching.  These\n\
    \   types are denoted using type prefixes similar to the type prefixes\n   used\
    \ with numeric values.  If no prefix is used, then case-\n   insensitive matching\
    \ is used (as is consistent with previous\n   behavior).\n   This document is\
    \ structured as a set of changes to the full ABNF\n   specification [RFC5234].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Updates to RFC 5234\n   This document makes changes to two parts of [RFC5234].\
    \  The two\n   changes are as follows:\n   o  Replace the last half of Section\
    \ 2.3 of [RFC5234] (beginning with\n      \"ABNF permits the specification of\
    \ literal text strings\") with the\n      contents of Section 2.1.\n   o  Replace\
    \ the <char-val> rule in Section 4 of [RFC5234] with the\n      contents of Section\
    \ 2.2.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Terminal Values - Literal Text Strings
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Terminal Values - Literal Text Strings\n   ABNF permits the specification\
    \ of literal text strings directly,\n   enclosed in quotation marks.  Hence:\n\
    \         command     =  \"command string\"\n   Literal text strings are interpreted\
    \ as a concatenated set of\n   printable characters.\n   NOTE:\n   The character\
    \ set for these strings is US-ASCII.\n   Literal text strings in ABNF may be either\
    \ case sensitive or case\n   insensitive.  The form of matching used with a literal\
    \ text string is\n   denoted by a prefix to the quoted string.  The following\
    \ prefixes are\n   allowed:\n         %s          =  case-sensitive\n        \
    \ %i          =  case-insensitive\n   To be consistent with prior implementations\
    \ of ABNF, having no prefix\n   means that the string is case insensitive and\
    \ is equivalent to having\n   the \"%i\" prefix.\n   Hence:\n         rulename\
    \ = %i\"aBc\"\n   and:\n         rulename = \"abc\"\n   will both match \"abc\"\
    , \"Abc\", \"aBc\", \"abC\", \"ABc\", \"aBC\", \"AbC\", and\n   \"ABC\".\n   In\
    \ contrast:\n         rulename = %s\"aBc\"\n   will match only \"aBc\" and will\
    \ not match \"abc\", \"Abc\", \"abC\", \"ABc\",\n   \"aBC\", \"AbC\", or \"ABC\"\
    .\n   In the past, the numerical specification of individual characters was\n\
    \   used to define a case-sensitive rule.\n   For example:\n         rulename\
    \    =  %d97 %d98 %d99\n   or\n         rulename    =  %x61.62.63\n   will match\
    \ only the string that comprises only the lowercase\n   characters, abc.  Using\
    \ a literal text string with a prefix has a\n   clear readability advantage over\
    \ the old way.\n"
