  - "1.  Introduction\n   RTP [RFC3550] provides a transport for real-time media flows\
    \ such as\n   audio and video together with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), which\n\
    \   provides periodic feedback about the media streams received in a\n   specific\
    \ duration.  In addition, RTCP can be used for timely feedback\n   about individual\
    \ events to report (e.g., packet loss) [RFC4585].\n   Both long-term and short-term\
    \ feedback enable a media sender to adapt\n   its media transmission and/or encoding\
    \ dynamically to the observed\n   path characteristics.\n   [RFC3611] defines\
    \ RTCP Extended Reports as a detailed reporting\n   framework to provide more\
    \ than just the coarse Receiver Report (RR)\n   statistics.  The detailed reporting\
    \ may enable a media sender to\n   react more appropriately to the observed networking\
    \ conditions as\n   these can be characterized better, although at the expense\
    \ of extra\n   overhead.\n   In addition to lost packets, [RFC3611] defines the\
    \ notion of\n   \"discarded\" packets: packets that were received but dropped\
    \ from the\n   de-jitter buffer because they were either too early (for buffering)\n\
    \   or too late (for playout).  The \"discard rate\" metric is part of the\n \
    \  VoIP metrics report block even though it is not just applicable to\n   audio:\
    \ it is specified as the fraction of discarded packets since the\n   beginning\
    \ of the session.  See Section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611].  The\n   discard metric is\
    \ believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP\n   applications that use\
    \ a de-jitter buffer [RFC5481].\n   Recently proposed extensions to the Extended\
    \ Reports (XR) reporting\n   suggest enhancing the discard metric:\n   o  Reporting\
    \ the number of discarded packets in a measurement\n      interval, i.e., during\
    \ either the last reporting interval or since\n      the beginning of the session,\
    \ as indicated by a flag in the\n      suggested XR report [RFC7002].  If an endpoint\
    \ needs to report\n      packet discard due to other reasons than early- and late-arrival\n\
    \      (for example, discard due to duplication, redundancy, etc.)  then\n   \
    \   it should consider using the Discarded Packets Report Block\n      [RFC7002].\n\
    \   o  Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a\n      measurement\
    \ interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the\n      duration of the session\
    \ [RFC7003].\n   o  Reporting run-length encoding of a discarded packet during\
    \ a\n      measurement interval, i.e., between a set of sequence numbers\n   \
    \   [RFC7097].\n   However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely\n\
    \   the number of RTP payload bytes that were discarded.  While this\n   information\
    \ could in theory be derived from high-frequency reporting\n   on the number of\
    \ discarded packets [RFC7002] or from the Discard RLE\n   (Run Length Encoding)\
    \ report [RFC7097], these two mechanisms do not\n   appear feasible.  The former\
    \ would require an unduly high amount of\n   reporting that still might not be\
    \ sufficient due to the non-\n   deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets.  The\
    \ latter incurs\n   significant complexity (by storing a map of sequence numbers\
    \ and\n   packet sizes) and reporting overhead.\n   An XR block is defined in\
    \ this document to indicate the number of RTP\n   payload bytes discarded, per\
    \ interval or for the duration of the\n   session, similar to the other XR blocks.\n"

    \ 8 bits. A Bytes Discarded Packets Report Block is\n   identified by the constant\
    \ 26.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits. It is used to indicate whether the\n\
    \   discard metric is an Interval or a Cumulative metric, that is,\n   whether\
    \ the reported value applies to the most recent measurement\n   interval duration\
    \ between successive reports (I=10, the Interval\n   Duration) or to the accumulation\
    \ period characteristic of cumulative\n   measurements (I=11, the Cumulative Duration).\
    \  Since the bytes\n   discarded are not measured at a particular time instance\
    \ but over one\n   or several reporting intervals, the metric MUST NOT be reported\
    \ as a\n   Sampled Metric (I=01).  In addition, the value I=00 is reserved and\n\
    \   MUST NOT be sent, and it MUST be discarded when received.\n   Early bit (E):\
    \ It is introduced to distinguish between packets\n   discarded due to early arrival\
    \ and those discarded due to late\n   arrival.  The E bit is set to '1' if it\
    \ reports bytes discarded due\n   to early arrival and is set to '0' if it reports\
    \ bytes discarded due\n   to late arrival.  If a duplicate packet is received\
    \ and discarded,\n   these duplicate packets are ignored and not reported.  In\
    \ case both\n   early and late discarded packets shall be reported, two Bytes\n\
    \   Discarded report blocks MUST be included.\n   Reserved: 5 bits.  This field\
    \ is reserved for future definition.  In\n   the absence of such definition, the\
    \ bits in this field MUST be set to\n   zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.\n\
    \   Block length: 16 bits.  It MUST be set to 2, in accordance with the\n   definition\
    \ of this field in [RFC3611].  The block MUST be discarded\n   if the block length\
    \ is set to a different value.\n   Number of RTP payload bytes discarded: It is\
    \ a 32-bit unsigned\n   integer value indicating the total number of bytes discarded.\
    \  The\n   'bytes discarded' corresponds to the RTP payload size of every RTP\n\
    \   packet that is discarded (due to early or late arrival).  Hence, the\n   'bytes\
    \ discarded' ignores the size of any RTP header extensions and\n   the size of\
    \ the padding bits.  Also the discarded packet is\n   associated to the interval\
    \ in which it was discarded, not when it was\n   expected.\n   If the Interval\
    \ Metric flag is set as I=11, the value in the field\n   indicates the number\
    \ of RTP payload bytes discarded from the start of\n   the session; if the Interval\
    \ Metric flag is set as I=10, it indicates\n   the number of bytes discarded in\
    \ the most recent reporting interval.\n   If the XR block follows a Measurement\
    \ Information Block [RFC6776] in\n   the same RTCP compound packet, then the cumulative\
    \ (I=11) or the\n   interval (I=10) for this report block corresponds to the values\
    \ of\n   the \"measurement duration\" in the Measurement Information Block.\n\
    \   If the receiver sends the Bytes Discarded Report Block without the\n   Measurement\
    \ Information Block, then the Bytes Discarded Report Block\n   MUST be sent in\
    \ conjunction with an RTCP Receiver Report (RR) as a\n   compound RTCP packet.\n"

  - "4.  Protocol Operation\n   This section describes the behavior of the reporting\
    \ node (i.e., the\n   media receiver) and the media sender.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)\n   The media receiver MAY send the Bytes Discarded\
    \ Reports as part of\n   the regularly scheduled RTCP packets as per RFC 3550.\
    \  It MAY also\n   include Bytes Discarded Reports in immediate or early feedback\n\
    \   packets as per [RFC4585].\n   Transmission of the RTCP XR Bytes Discarded\
    \ Report is up to the\n   discretion of the media receiver, as is the reporting\
    \ granularity.\n   However, it is RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signals\
    \ the bytes\n   discarded packets using the method defined in this document. \
    \ When\n   reporting several metrics in a single RTCP packet, the reporting\n\
    \   intervals for the report blocks are synchronized, therefore the media\n  \
    \ receiver may choose to additionally send the Discarded Packets\n   [RFC7002]\
    \ or Discard RLE [RFC7097] Report Block to assist the media\n   sender in correlating\
    \ the bytes discarded to the packets discarded in\n   that particular interval.\n\
    \   If all packets over a reporting period were discarded, the media\n   receiver\
    \ MAY use the Discarded Packets Report Block [RFC7002]\n   instead.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Media Sender
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Media Sender\n   The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving\
    \ any\n   Bytes Discarded reports.  If Bytes Discarded reports are generated by\n\
    \   the media receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all these reports\n  \
    \ being received, nor can the media sender rely on a regular generation\n   pattern\
    \ from the media receiver.\n   However, if the media sender receives any RTCP\
    \ reports but no Bytes\n   Discarded report blocks and is aware that the media\
    \ receiver supports\n   Bytes Discarded report blocks, it MAY assume that no packets\
    \ were\n   discarded by the media receiver.\n   The media sender SHOULD accept\
    \ the Bytes Discarded Report Block only\n   if it is received in a compound RTCP\
    \ receiver report or if it is\n   preceded by a Measurement Information Block\
    \ [RFC6776].  Under all\n   other circumstances, it MUST ignore the block.\n"
- title: 5.  SDP Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.  SDP Signaling\n   A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal\
    \ its support\n   for the report block specified in this document or use them\
    \ without\n   any prior signaling (see Section 5 of [RFC3611]).\n   For signaling\
    \ in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in [RFC3611]\n   MUST be used.  The\
    \ SDP [RFC4566] attribute 'xr-format' defined in RFC\n   3611 is augmented to\
    \ indicate the Bytes Discarded metric.  This is\n   described in the following\
    \ ABNF [RFC5234]:\n   rtcp-xr-attrib = \"a=\" \"rtcp-xr\" \":\" [xr-format *(SP\
    \ xr-format)]\n                    CRLF   ; defined in [RFC3611]\n   xr-format\
    \       =/ xr-discard-bytes\n   xr-discard-bytes = \"discard-bytes\"\n   The parameter\
    \ 'discard-bytes' to indicate support for the Bytes\n   Discarded Report Block\
    \ is defined in Section 3.\n   When SDP is used in the offer/answer context, the\
    \ mechanism defined\n   in [RFC3611] for unilateral \"rtcp-xr\" attribute parameters\
    \ applies\n   (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3611]).\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Bytes Discarded block does not provide per-packet\
    \ statistics,\n   hence the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph\n\
    \   3 of [RFC3611] does not apply.  In some situations, returning very\n   detailed\
    \ error information (e.g., over-range measurement or\n   measurement unavailable)\
    \ using this report block can provide an\n   attacker with insight into the security\
    \ processing.  For example,\n   assume that the attacker sends a packet with a\
    \ stale timestamp (i.e.,\n   time in the past) to the receiver.  If the receiver\
    \ now sends a\n   discard report with the same number of bytes as the payload\
    \ of the\n   injected packet, the attacker can infer that no security processing\n\
    \   was performed.  If, on the other hand, the attacker does not receive\n   a\
    \ discard report, it can equivalently assume that the security\n   procedures\
    \ were performed on the packet.\n   Implementers should therefore consider the\
    \ guidance in [RFC7202] for\n   using appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where\
    \ security is a\n   concern, the implementation should apply encryption and\n\
    \   authentication to the report block.  For example, this can be\n   achieved\
    \ by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP\n   profile as defined\
    \ in [RFC3711]; an appropriate combination of the\n   two profiles (an \"SAVPF\"\
    ) is specified in [RFC5124].  However, other\n   mechanisms also exist (documented\
    \ in [RFC7201]) and might be more\n   suitable.\n   The Bytes Discarded report\
    \ is employed by the sender to perform\n   congestion control, typically, for\
    \ calculating goodput (i.e.,\n   throughput that is useful).  In these cases,\
    \ an attacker MAY drive\n   the endpoint to lower its sending rate and under-utilize\
    \ the link;\n   therefore, media senders should choose appropriate security measures\n\
    \   to mitigate such attacks.\n   Lastly, the security considerations of [RFC3550],\
    \ [RFC3611], and\n   [RFC4585] apply.\n"
