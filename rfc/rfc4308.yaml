- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IPsec, Internet Key Exchange (IKE), and IKEv2 protocols rely\
    \ on\n   security algorithms to provide privacy and authentication between the\n\
    \   initiator and responder.  There are many such algorithms available,\n   and\
    \ two IPsec systems cannot interoperate unless they are using the\n   same algorithms.\
    \  This document specifies optional suites of\n   algorithms and attributes that\
    \ can be used to simplify the\n   administration of IPsec when used in manual\
    \ keying mode, with IKEv1\n   or with IKEv2.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a companion to IPsec [RFC2401] and its\
    \ two key\n   exchange protocols, IKE [RFC2409] and IKEv2 [IKEv2].  Like most\n\
    \   security protocols, IPsec, IKE, and IKEv2 allow users to chose which\n   cryptographic\
    \ algorithms they want to use to meet their security\n   needs.\n   Implementation\
    \ experience with IPsec in manual key mode and with IKE\n   has shown that there\
    \ are so many choices for typical system\n   administrators to make that it is\
    \ difficult to achieve\n   interoperability without careful pre-agreement.  Because\
    \ of this, the\n   IPsec Working Group agreed that there should be a small number\
    \ of\n   named suites that cover typical security policies.  These suites may\n\
    \   be presented in the administrative interface of the IPsec system.\n   These\
    \ suites, often called \"UI suites\" (\"user interface suites\"), are\n   optional\
    \ and do not prevent implementers from allowing individual\n   selection of the\
    \ security algorithms.\n   Although the UI suites listed here are optional to\
    \ implement, this\n   document is on the standards track because implementers\
    \ who call\n   particular suites by the names used here have to conform to the\n\
    \   suites listed in this document.  These suites should not be\n   considered\
    \ extensions to IPsec, IKE, and IKEv2, but instead\n   administrative methods\
    \ for describing sets of configurations.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  UI Suites
  contents:
  - "2.  UI Suites\n   This section lists optional, non-mandatory suites that may\
    \ be\n   presented to system administrators to ease the burden of choosing\n \
    \  among the many options in IPsec systems.  These suites cannot cover\n   all\
    \ of the options that an administrator needs to select.  Instead,\n   they give\
    \ values for a subset of the options.\n   Note that these UI suites are simply\
    \ collections of values for some\n   options in IPsec.  Use of UI suites does\
    \ not change the IPsec, IKE,\n   or IKEv2 protocols in any way.  Specifically,\
    \ the transform\n   substructure in IKE and IKEv2 must be used to give the value\
    \ for each\n   specified option regardless of whether or not UI suites are used.\n\
    \   Implementations that use UI suites SHOULD also provide a management\n   interface\
    \ for specifying values for individual cryptographic options.\n   That is, it\
    \ is unlikely that UI suites are a complete solution for\n   matching the security\
    \ policies of many IPsec users, and therefore an\n   interface that gives a more\
    \ complete set of options should be used as\n   well.\n   IPsec implementations\
    \ that use these UI suites SHOULD use the suite\n   names listed here.  IPsec\
    \ implementations SHOULD NOT use names\n   different than those listed here for\
    \ the suites that are described,\n   and MUST NOT use the names listed here for\
    \ suites that do not match\n   these values.  These requirements are necessary\
    \ for interoperability.\n   Note that the suites listed here are for use of IPsec\
    \ in virtual\n   private networks.  Other uses of IPsec will probably want to\
    \ define\n   their own suites and give them different names.\n   Additional suites\
    \ can be defined by RFCs.  The strings used to\n   identify UI suites are registered\
    \ by IANA.\n"
