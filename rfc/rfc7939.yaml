        and may include\n   a list of notification-specific variables.  Section 7
        contains the\n   notification definitions, which includes the variable lists.
        \ At\n   least one IP address of the router that originates the notification\n

      - contents:
        - "5.1.3.1.  Ignoring Initial Activity\n   The majority of critical events
          occur when NHDP is first enabled on a\n   router, at which time, the symmetric
          neighbors and 2-hop neighbors of\n   the router are discovered.  During
          this initial period, a potential\n   flood of notifications is unnecessary
          since the events are expected.\n   To avoid unnecessary notifications, a
          router SHOULD NOT originate\n   expected notifications until a predefined
          and administratively\n   configured time interval has elapsed.  It is RECOMMENDED
          that this\n   time interval be at least 3 times nhdpHelloInterval so that
          symmetric\n   neighbors are discovered.  The suppression window for notifications\n
          \  is started when the nhdpIfStatus transitions from its default value\n
          \  of 'false(2)' to 'true(1)'.\n"

        - "5.1.3.2.  Throttling Notifications\n   The mechanism for throttling the
          notifications is the same as in\n   [RFC4750] (i.e., the number of transmitted
          notifications per time is\n   bounded).\n   Appropriate values for the window
          time and upper bound are to be\n   administratively configured and depend
          on the deployment of the\n   MANET.  If NHDP is deployed on a lossy, wireless
          medium, sending too\n   many notifications in a short time interval may
          lead to collisions\n   and dropped packets.  In particular, in dense deployments
          of routers\n   running NHDP (i.e., where each router has many neighbors),
          a change\n   of the local topology may trigger many notifications at the
          same\n   time.  [RFC4750] recommends \"7 traps with a window time of 10\n
          \  seconds\" as the upper bound.  As NHDP is expected to be deployed in\n
          \  more lossy channels than OSPF, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a lower\n
          \  threshold for the number of notifications per time than that.\n   Specifically,
          it is RECOMMENDED that the threshold value for the\n   objects reflecting
          the change be set to a value of '10' and the\n   DEFAULT values for these
          objects within the Notifications Group be\n   set to this value.  Further,
          a time window for the change objects is\n   defined within this MIB module.
          \ If the number of occurrences exceeds\n   the change threshold within the
          previous change window, then it is\n   RECOMMENDED that the notification
          be sent.  Furthermore, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that the value for this window
          be set to at least 5 times\n   the nhdpHelloInterval.\n   The following
          objects are used to define the thresholds and time\n   windows for specific
          notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB module:\n   nhdpNbrStateChangeThreshold,
          nhdpNbrStateChangeWindow,\n   nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeThreshold, and nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeWindow.\n"

      a set of controls.  The\n   authoritative list of configuration controls within
      the NHDP-MIB\n   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally,
      an attempt\n   was made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all\n   configuration
      objects defined in [RFC6130].  For all of the\n   configuration parameters,
      the same constraints and default values of\n   these parameters as defined in
      [RFC6130] are followed.  Refer to\n   [RFC5148] for guidance on setting jitter-related
      parameters, e.g.,\n   nhdpMaxJitter.\n"
    title: 5.2.  The Configuration Group
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  The State Group\n   The State Group reports current state information
      of a router running\n   NHDP.  The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed
      to contain the\n   complete set of state information defined within the information\n
      \  bases specified in Sections 6, 7, and 8 of [RFC6130].\n   Two constructs,
      i.e., TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, are defined to support the\n   tables in the State
      Group.  NHDP stores and indexes information\n   through sets of (dynamically
      defined) addresses, i.e., address sets.\n   Within SMIv2, it is not possible
      to index tables with variably\n   defined address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs
      are defined\n   to provide a local mapping between NHDP-managed address sets
      and\n   SMIv2 table indexing.  These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex and\n
      \  NeighborRouterIndex.  These are locally (to the router) defined,\n   unique
      identifiers of virtual neighbors and neighbor interfaces.  Due\n   to the nature
      of NHDP, the local router may have identified distinct\n   address sets but
      is not able to associate these as a single\n   interface.  Hence, two or more
      NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple\n   distinct address sets may, in fact,
      be related to a common neighbor\n   interface.  This ambiguity may also hold
      with respect to the\n   assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.  The local MIB
      agent is\n   responsible for managing, aggregating, and retiring the defined\n
      \  indexes and for updating MIB tables using these indexes as the local\n   router
      learns more about its neighbors' topologies.  These constructs\n   are used
      to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and\n   to correlate
      table entries to address sets, virtual neighbor\n   interfaces, and virtual
      neighbors within the MANET.\n"

      \ This MIB\n   module defines several objects that can be polled in order to,
      e.g.,\n   calculate histories or monitor frequencies of changes.  This may help\n

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration,
    monitoring,\n   and notification of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood\n
    \  Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130].  NHDP allows routers to acquire\n   topological
    information up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging\n   HELLO messages.  The
    information acquired by NHDP may be used by\n   routing protocols.  The neighborhood
    information, exchanged between\n   routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols
    as a baseline for\n   calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay
    set\n   selection for network-wide transmissions, etc.\n   There are a number
    of management objects defined in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause
    of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive
    or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.  The support for SET operations
    in a non-secure\n   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
    \ These\n   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  nhdpIfStatus - This writable object turns on or off the NHDP\n      process
    for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher-level\n      protocol functions,
    e.g., routing, would fail, causing network-\n      wide disruptions.\n   o  nhdpHelloInterval,
    nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval -\n      These writable objects
    control the rate at which HELLO messages\n      are sent on an interface.  If
    set at too high a rate, this could\n      represent a form of denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack by overloading\n      interface resources.\n   o  nhdpHystAcceptQuality,
    nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,\n      and nhdpInitialPending - These
    writable objects affect the\n      perceived quality of the NHDP links and hence
    the overall\n      stability of the network.  If improperly set, these settings
    could\n      result in network-wide disruptions.\n   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - This
    table contains writable objects that\n      affect the overall performance and
    stability of the NHDP process.\n      Failure of the NHDP process would result
    in network-wide failure.\n      Particularly sensitive objects from this table
    are discussed in\n      the previous list items.  This is the only table in the
    NHDP-MIB\n      module with writable objects.\n   Some of the readable objects
    in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)
    may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It
    is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
    and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
    over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The object contains information on discovered\n      neighbors,
    specifically their IP address in the\n      nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object.  This
    information provides an\n      adversary broad information on the members of the
    MANET, located\n      within this single table.  This information can be used
    to\n      expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without having\n
    \     to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.  This\n      object
    is the index into the table and has a MAX-ACCESS of\n      'not-accessible'.  However,
    this information can be exposed using\n      SNMP operations.\n   MANET technology
    is often deployed to support communications of\n   emergency services or military
    tactical applications.  In these\n   applications, it is imperative to maintain
    the proper operation of\n   the communications network and to protect sensitive
    information\n   related to its operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to provide\n
    \  support for the Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in\n   combination
    with TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate
    security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n
    \  there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n
    \  Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the\n   SNMPv3
    framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance to the
    SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy via
    the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm
    [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
    Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n
    \  [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior
    to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
    and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility
    to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"

    MANET protocols in operation on the router to perform routing,\n   multicast forwarding,
    and other functions with ad hoc and mobile\n   networks.  In the following, three
    example scenarios are listed where\n   this MIB module is useful:\n   o  For a
    Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - It is common\n      for the vehicles
    comprising the MANET being forward deployed at a\n      remote location, e.g.,
    the site of a natural disaster, to be off-\n      loaded in a parking lot where
    an initial configuration of the\n      networking devices is performed.  The configuration
    is loaded into\n      the devices from a fixed location Network Operations Center
    (NOC)\n      at the parking lot, and the vehicles are stationary at the parking\n
    \     lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based\n      methods
    for configuration management from the co-located NOC are\n      necessary for
    this deployment option.\n   o  For Mobile Vehicles with Low-Bandwidth Satellite
    Link to a Fixed\n      NOC - Here, the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry
    multiple\n      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth,\n
    \     on-the-move satellite connection that interconnects a fix NOC to\n      the
    nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring\n      and fault management
    from the fixed NOC are necessary for this\n      deployment option.\n   o  For
    Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for\n      larger vehicles,
    a hierarchical network management arrangement is\n      useful.  Centralized network
    management is performed from a fixed\n      NOC while local management is performed
    locally from within the\n      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration,
    monitoring,\n      and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.\n"
