  - "1.  Introduction\n   PANA [RFC5191] is a UDP-based protocol to perform an Extensible\n
    \  Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication between a PANA Client\n   (PaC)
    and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA).\n   Various types of payload are exchanged
    as part of the network access\n   authentication and authorization.  These payloads
    are carried in PANA\n   Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).  AVPs can be integrity protected
    using\n   the AUTH AVP when EAP authentication generates cryptographic keying\n
    \  material.  AVPs are transmitted in the clear (i.e., not encrypted).\n   Certain
    payload types need to be delivered privately (e.g., network\n   keys, private
    identifiers, etc.).  This document defines a mechanism\n   for applying encryption
    to selected AVPs.\n"

    - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are

      \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",

    title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Details\n   This document extends the AVP set defined in Section 8 of [RFC5191]\n
    \  by defining two new AVPs: the Encryption-Algorithm AVP (see Section\n   4)
    and the Encryption-Encap AVP (see Section 5).  Two new encryption\n   keys, PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY
    and PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY, are defined to encrypt\n   AVPs from the PaC to the PAA
    and AVPs from the PAA to the PaC,\n   respectively (see Section 3).\n   When encryption
    is needed, the required algorithm is negotiated as\n   follows: the PAA SHALL
    send the initial PANA-Auth-Request carrying\n   one or more Encryption-Algorithm
    AVPs supported by it.  The PaC SHALL\n   select one of the algorithms from this
    AVP, and it SHALL respond with\n   the initial PANA-Auth-Answer carrying one Encryption-Algorithm
    AVP\n   for the selected algorithm.  Once PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY and\n   PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY
    have been generated, a PANA message MAY contain an\n   Encryption-Encap AVP.\n"

  - "3.  Encryption Keys\n   PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY is used for encrypting the AVP payload
    of the\n   Encryption-Encap AVP sent in a PANA message from the PaC to the PAA.\n
    \  PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY SHALL be computed according to the following\n   formula:\n

    version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC5996].\n      -  The pseudo-random function (PRF) to be
    used for the prf+\n         function SHALL be negotiated using the PRF-Algorithm
    AVP in the\n         initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-Auth-Answer exchange with\n
    \        the 'S' (Start) bit set as described in Section 4.1 of\n         [RFC5191].\n
    \     -  MSK is the master session key (MSK) generated by the EAP method\n         [RFC3748].
    \ PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY and PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY MUST be\n         recalculated whenever
    a new MSK is generated by the EAP method.\n      -  \"IETF PANA PaC Encr\" and
    \"IETF PANA PAA Encr\" are the ASCII\n         code representations of the respective
    non-NULL terminated\n         strings (excluding the double quotes around them).\n
    \     -  I_PAR and I_PAN are the initial PANA-Auth-Request and\n         PANA-Auth-Answer
    messages (the PANA header and the following\n         PANA AVPs) with the 'S'
    (Start) bit set, respectively.\n      -  PaC_nonce and PAA_nonce are values of
    the Nonce AVP carried in\n         the first non-initial PANA-Auth-Answer and
    PANA-Auth-Request\n         messages in the authentication and authorization phase
    or the\n         first PANA-Auth-Answer and PANA-Auth-Request messages in the\n
    \        re-authentication phase, respectively.\n      -  Key_ID is the value
    of the Key-Id AVP.\n   The length of PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY and PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY depends
    on the\n   encryption algorithm in use.\n"

    SHALL support AES128_CTR.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  AES128_CTR Encryption Algorithm\n   The AES128_CTR encryption algorithm
      uses the AES-CTR (Counter) mode\n   of operation as specified in [NIST_SP800_38A]
      using the AES-128 block\n   cipher.  The formatting function and counter generation
      function, as\n   specified in Appendix A of [NIST_SP800_38C], are used with
      the\n   following parameters:\n         n = 12,\n         q = 3\n   The 12-octet
      nonce consists of a 4-octet Key-Id, a 4-octet Session\n   ID, and a 4-octet
      Sequence Number in that order where each 4-octet\n   value is encoded in network
      byte order.  The Session ID and Sequence\n   Number values SHALL be the same
      as those in the PANA message carrying\n   the key Encryption-Encap AVP.  The
      Key-Id value SHALL be the same as\n   the one used for deriving PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY
      and PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY.\n   The output blocks of the encryption processing are
      encoded as\n   OctetString data in the Value field of a Encryption-Encap AVP.\n
      \  Note that the first counter block used for encryption is Ctr_1, where\n   \"_1\"
      denotes \"subscript 1\" as described in Appendix A.3 of\n   [NIST_SP800_38C].
      \ For example, given the following:\n         Key-Id = 0x55667788,\n         Session
      ID = 0xaabbccdd,\n         Sequence Number = 0x11223344\n   The first counter
      block used for encryption will be:\n         0x0255667788aabbccdd11223344000001\n
      \  where the initial 0x02 represents the Flags field of the counter\n   block.\n
      \  The nonce meets the requirement of uniqueness-per-key usage provided\n   that
      the sequence number does not wrap.  Therefore, for the purpose\n   of generating
      new keys:\n      -  If Encryption-Encap AVPs are being sent from the PaC to
      the PAA\n         and the sequence number is about to wrap, the PaC SHALL\n
      \        initiate PANA re-authentication as described in Section 4.3 of\n         [RFC5191].\n
      \     -  If Encryption-Encap AVPs are being sent from the PAA to the PaC\n         and
      the sequence number is about to wrap, the PAA SHALL\n         initiate PANA
      re-authentication as described in Section 4.3 of\n         [RFC5191].\n   Re-authentication
      ensures the generation of a new MSK [RFC3748] and\n   thus a new PANA_PAC_ENCR_KEY
      and PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY.\n"

  - "5.  Encryption-Encap AVP\n   The Encryption-Encap AVP (AVP code 12) is used to
    encrypt one or more\n   PANA AVPs.  The format of the Encryption-Encap AVP depends
    on the\n   negotiated encryption algorithm.\n   When the negotiated encryption
    algorithm identifier is AES128_CTR\n   (code 1), AVP data payload is occupied
    by the encrypted AVPs.\n   There SHALL be only one Encryption-Encap AVP in a PANA

    or\n   PANA_PAA_ENCR_KEY, and the encryption algorithm negotiated by the\n   Encryption-Algorithm
    AVP.  The Encryption-Encap AVP SHALL only be\n   used if the EAP method generates
