  - "Abstract\n   RFC 7344 specifies how DNS trust can be maintained across key\n\
    \   rollovers in-band between parent and child.  This document elevates\n   RFC\
    \ 7344 from Informational to Standards Track.  It also adds a\n   method for initial\
    \ trust setup and removal of a secure entry point.\n   Changing a domain's DNSSEC\
    \ status can be a complicated matter\n   involving multiple unrelated parties.\
    \  Some of these parties, such as\n   the DNS operator, might not even be known\
    \ by all the organizations\n   involved.  The inability to disable DNSSEC via\
    \ in-band signaling is\n   seen as a problem or liability that prevents some DNSSEC\
    \ adoption at\n   a large scale.  This document adds a method for in-band signaling\
    \ of\n   these DNSSEC status changes.\n   This document describes reasonable policies\
    \ to ease deployment of the\n   initial acceptance of new secure entry points\
    \ (DS records).\n   It is preferable that operators collaborate on the transfer\
    \ or move\n   of a domain.  The best method is to perform a Key Signing Key (KSK)\n\
    \   plus Zone Signing Key (ZSK) rollover.  If that is not possible, the\n   method\
    \ using an unsigned intermediate state described in this\n   document can be used\
    \ to move the domain between two parties.  This\n   leaves the domain temporarily\
    \ unsigned and vulnerable to DNS\n   spoofing, but that is preferred over the\
    \ alternative of validation\n   failures due to a mismatched DS and DNSKEY record.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   CDS (Child DS) and CDNSKEY (Child DNSKEY) [RFC7344] records\
    \ are used\n   to signal changes in secure entry points.  This is one method to\n\
    \   maintain delegations that can be used when the DNS operator has no\n   other\
    \ way to inform the parent that changes are needed.  This\n   document elevates\
    \ [RFC7344] from Informational to Standards Track.\n   In addition, [RFC7344]\
    \ lacks two different options for full automated\n   operation to be possible.\
    \  It does not define a method for the\n   initial trust establishment, leaving\
    \ it open to each parent to come\n   up with an acceptance policy.  Additionally,\
    \ [RFC7344] does not\n   provide a \"delete\" signal for the child to inform the\
    \ parent that the\n   DNSSEC security for its domain must be removed.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Introducing a DS Record
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Introducing a DS Record\n   Automated insertion of DS records has been\
    \ limited for many zones by\n   the requirement that all changes pass through\
    \ a \"Registry\" of the\n   child zone's parent.  This has significantly hindered\
    \ deployment of\n   DNSSEC at a large scale for DNS hosters, as the child zone\
    \ owner is\n   often not aware or able to update DNS records such as the DS record.\n\
    \   This document describes a few possible methods for the parent to\n   accept\
    \ a request by the child to add a DS record to its zone.  These\n   methods have\
    \ different security properties that address different\n   deployment scenarios,\
    \ all resulting in an automated method of trust\n   introduction.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Removing a DS Record
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Removing a DS Record\n   This document introduces the delete option for\
    \ both CDS and CDNSKEY,\n   allowing a child to signal to the parent to turn off\
    \ DNSSEC.  When a\n   domain is moved from one DNS operator to another, sometimes\
    \ it is\n   necessary to turn off DNSSEC to facilitate the change of DNS\n   operator.\
    \  Common scenarios include:\n   1.  Alternative to doing a proper DNSSEC algorithm\
    \ rollover due to\n       operational limitations such as software limitations.\n\
    \   2.  Moving from a DNSSEC operator to a non-DNSSEC-capable operator.\n   3.\
    \  Moving to an operator that cannot or does not want to do a proper\n       DNSSEC\
    \ rollover.\n   4.  When moving between two DNS operators that use disjoint sets\
    \ of\n       algorithms to sign the zone, an algorithm rollover cannot be\n  \
    \     performed.\n   5.  The domain holder no longer wants DNSSEC enabled.\n \
    \  The lack of a \"remove my DNSSEC\" option is cited as a reason why some\n \
    \  operators cannot deploy DNSSEC, as this is seen as an operational\n   risk.\n\
    \   Turning off DNSSEC reduces the security of the domain and thus should\n  \
    \ only be done carefully, and that decision should be fully under the\n   child\
    \ domain's control.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Notation
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Notation\n   Signaling can happen via CDS or CDNSKEY records.  The only\n\
    \   differences between the two records are how information is\n   represented\
    \ and who calculates the DS digest.  For clarity, this\n   document uses the term\
    \ \"CDS\" to mean \"either CDS or CDNSKEY\".\n   When this document uses the word\
    \ \"parent\", it implies an entity that\n   is authorized to insert DS records\
    \ into the parent zone on behalf of\n   the child domain.  Which entity this exactly\
    \ is does not matter.  It\n   could be the Registrar or Reseller that the child\
    \ domain was\n   purchased from.  It could be the Registry that the domain is\n\
    \   registered in when allowed.  Or it could be some other entity.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The Three Uses of CDS
  contents:
  - "2.  The Three Uses of CDS\n   In general, there are three operations that a domain\
    \ wants to\n   instruct its parent to perform:\n   1.  Enable DNSSEC validation,\
    \ i.e., place an initial DS Resource\n       Record Set (RRset) in the parent.\n\
    \   2.  Roll over the KSK.  This means updating the DS records in the\n      \
    \ parent to reflect the new set of KSKs at the child.  This could\n       be an\
    \ ADD operation, a DELETE operation on one or more records\n       while keeping\
    \ at least one DS RR, or a full REPLACE operation.\n   3.  Turn off DNSSEC validation,\
    \ i.e., delete all the DS records.\n   KSK rollover is covered in [RFC7344]. \
    \ It is considered the safest\n   use case of a CDS/CDNSKEY record as it makes\
    \ no change to the trust\n   relationship between parent and child.  Introduction\
    \ and removal of\n   DS records are defined in this document.  As these CDS/CDNSKEY\
    \ use\n   cases create or end the trust relationship between the parent and\n\
    \   child, these use cases should be carefully implemented and monitored.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The Meaning of the CDS RRset
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Meaning of the CDS RRset\n   The semantic meaning of publishing a CDS\
    \ RRset is interpreted to\n   mean:\n      Publishing a CDS or CDNSKEY record\
    \ signals to the parent that the\n      child desires that the corresponding DS\
    \ records be synchronized.\n      Every parent or parental agent should have an\
    \ acceptance policy of\n      these records for the three different use cases\
    \ involved: Initial\n      DS publication, Key rollover, and Returning to Insecure.\n\
    \   In short, the CDS RRset is an instruction to the parent to modify the\n  \
    \ DS RRset if the CDS and DS Resets differ.\n   The acceptance policy for CDS\
    \ in the rollover case is \"seeing\"\n   according to [RFC7344].  The acceptance\
    \ policy in the Delete case is\n   seeing a (validly signed) CDS RRset with the\
    \ delete operation\n   specified in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Enabling DNSSEC via CDS/CDNSKEY
  contents:
  - "3.  Enabling DNSSEC via CDS/CDNSKEY\n   There are number of different models\
    \ for managing initial trust, but\n   in the general case, the child wants to\
    \ enable global validation.  As\n   long as the child is insecure, DNS answers\
    \ can be forged.  The goal\n   is to promote the child from insecure to secure\
    \ as soon as reasonably\n   possible by the parent.  This means that the period\
    \ from the child's\n   publication of CDS/CDNSKEY RRset to the parent publishing\
    \ the\n   synchronized DS RRset should be as short as possible.\n   One important\
    \ use case is how a third-party DNS operator can upload\n   its DNSSEC information\
    \ to the parent, so the parent can publish a DS\n   record for the child.  In\
    \ this case, there is a possibility of\n   setting up some kind of authentication\
    \ mechanism and submission\n   mechanism that is outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Below are some policies that parents can use.  These policies assume\n   that\
    \ the notifications can be verified or authenticated.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Accept Policy via Authenticated Channel
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Accept Policy via Authenticated Channel\n   In this case, the parent is\
    \ notified via authenticated channel UI/API\n   that a CDS/CDNSKEY RRset exists.\
    \  In the case of a CDS RRset, the\n   parent retrieves the CDS RRset and inserts\
    \ the corresponding DS RRset\n   as requested.  In the case of CDNSKEY, the parent\
    \ retrieves the\n   CDNSKEY RRset and calculates the DS record(s).  Parents may\
    \ limit the\n   DS record type based on local policy.  Parents SHOULD NOT refuse\
    \ CDS/\n   CDNSKEY updates that do not (yet) have a matching DNSKEY in the child\n\
    \   zone.  This will allow the child to pre-publish a spare (and\n   potentially\
    \ offline) DNSKEY.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Accept with Extra Checks
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Accept with Extra Checks\n   In this case, the parent checks that the source\
    \ of the notification\n   is allowed to request the DS insertion.  The checks\
    \ could include\n   whether this is a trusted entity, whether the nameservers\
    \ correspond\n   to the requester, whether there have been any changes in registration\n\
    \   in the last few days, etc.  The parent can also send a notification\n   requesting\
    \ a confirmation, for example, by sending email to the\n   registrant requesting\
    \ a confirmation.  The end result is that the CDS\n   RRset is accepted at the\
    \ end of the checks or when the out-of-band\n   confirmation is received.  Any\
    \ extra checks should have proper rate\n   limiting in place to prevent abuse.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Accept after Delay
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Accept after Delay\n   In this case, if the parent deems the request valid,\
    \ it starts\n   monitoring the CDS RRset at the child nameservers over a period\
    \ of\n   time to make sure nothing changes.  After some time or after a number\n\
    \   of checks, preferably from different vantage points in the network,\n   the\
    \ parent accepts the CDS RRset as a valid signal to update its DS\n   RRset for\
    \ this child.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Accept with Challenge
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Accept with Challenge\n   In this case, the parent instructs the requester\
    \ to insert some\n   record into the child domain to prove it has the ability\
    \ to do so\n   (i.e., it is the operator of the zone).  This method imposes a\
    \ new\n   task on the parent to monitor the child zone to see if the challenge\n\
    \   has been added to the zone.  The parent should verify that the\n   challenge\
    \ is published by all the child's nameservers and should test\n   for this challenge\
    \ from various diverse network locations to increase\n   the security of this\
    \ method as much as possible.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Accept from Inception
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Accept from Inception\n   If a parent is adding a new child domain that\
    \ is not currently\n   delegated at all, it could use the child CDS/CDNSKEY RRset\
    \ to\n   immediately publish a DS RRset along with the new NS RRset.  This\n \
    \  would ensure that the new child domain is never active in an insecure\n   state.\n"
- title: 4.  DNSSEC Delete Algorithm
  contents:
  - "4.  DNSSEC Delete Algorithm\n   This document defines the previously reserved\
    \ DNS Security Algorithm\n   Number of value 0 in the context of CDS and CDNSKEY\
    \ records to mean\n   that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed.\
    \  The value 0\n   remains reserved for the DS and DNSKEY records.\n   No DNSSEC\
    \ validator can treat algorithm 0 as a valid signature\n   algorithm.  If a validator\
    \ sees a DNSKEY or DS record with this\n   algorithm value, it must treat it as\
    \ unknown.  Accordingly, the zone\n   is treated as unsigned unless there are\
    \ other algorithms present.  In\n   general, the value 0 should never be used\
    \ in the context of DNSKEY\n   and DS records.\n   The CERT record [RFC4398] defines\
    \ the value 0 similarly to mean the\n   algorithm in the CERT record is not defined\
    \ in DNSSEC.\n   The contents of the CDS or CDNSKEY RRset MUST contain one RR\
    \ and only\n   contain the exact fields as shown below.\n      CDS 0 0 0 0\n \
    \     CDNSKEY 0 3 0 0\n   The keying material payload is represented by a single\
    \ 0.  This\n   record is signed in the same way as regular CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets\
    \ are\n   signed.\n   Strictly speaking, the CDS record could be \"CDS X 0 X 0\"\
    \ as only the\n   DNSKEY algorithm is what signals the DELETE operation, but for\n\
    \   clarity, the \"0 0 0 0\" notation is mandated -- this is not a\n   definition\
    \ of DS digest algorithm 0.  The same argument applies to\n   \"CDNSKEY 0 3 0\
    \ 0\"; the value 3 in the second field is mandated by\n   [RFC4034], Section 2.1.2.\n\
    \   Once the parent has verified the CDS/CDNSKEY RRset and it has passed\n   other\
    \ acceptance tests, the parent MUST remove the DS RRset.  After\n   waiting a\
    \ sufficient amount of time -- depending on the parental TTLs\n   -- the child\
    \ can start the process of turning off DNSSEC.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Turning off DNSSEC reduces the security of the\
    \ domain and thus should\n   only be done as a last resort in preventing DNSSEC\
    \ validation errors\n   due to mismatched DS and DNSKEY records.\n   Users should\
    \ keep in mind that re-establishing trust in delegation\n   can be hard and takes\
    \ time.  Before deciding to complete the rollover\n   via an unsigned state, all\
    \ other options should be considered first.\n   A parent SHOULD ensure that when\
    \ it is allowing a child to become\n   securely delegated, it has a reasonable\
    \ assurance that the CDS/\n   CDNSKEY RRset used to bootstrap the security is\
    \ visible from a\n   geographically and topologically diverse view.  It SHOULD\
    \ also ensure\n   that the zone validates correctly if the parent publishes the\
    \ DS\n   record.  A parent zone might also consider sending an email to its\n\
    \   contact addresses to give the child zone a warning that security will\n  \
    \ be enabled after a certain amount of wait time -- thus allowing a\n   child\
    \ administrator to cancel the request.\n   This document describes a few possible\
    \ acceptance criteria for the\n   initial trust establishment.  Due to a large\
    \ variety of legal\n   frameworks surrounding parent domains (Top-Level Domain\
    \ (TLDs) in\n   particular), this document cannot give a definitive list of valid\n\
    \   acceptance criteria.  Parental zones should look at the listed\n   methods\
    \ and pick the most secure method possible within their legal\n   and technical\
    \ scenario, possibly further securing the acceptance\n   criteria, as long as\
    \ the deployed method still enables a fully\n   automated method for non-direct\
    \ parties such as third-party DNS\n   hosters.\n"
