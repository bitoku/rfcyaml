Abstract This document describes the use of the Edwards curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).
The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
[RFC7296] can use arbitrary signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].
[RFC7427] defines the SIGNATURE HASH
ALGORITHMS notification where each side of the IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.
This assumes that all signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed by a signature phase.
This made sense because most signature algorithms either cannot sign messages bigger than their key or truncate messages bigger than their key.
[RFC8032] defines signature methods that do not require prehashing of the message.
Unlike other methods, these accept messages of arbitrary size, so no prehashing is required.
These methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448; they use the Edwards 25519 and the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks") curves, respectively.
Although that document also defines prehashed versions of these algorithms, those versions are not recommended for protocols where there is minimal burden in buffering the entire message so as to make it practical to make two passes over the message.
This is true of IKEv2.
See Section 8.5 of [RFC8032] for that recommendation.
EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that should be used in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data Format in Section 3 of RFC 8032.
[RFC8410] defines the object identifiers (OIDs) for these signature methods.
For convenience, these OIDs are repeated in Appendix A.
In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done, we define a new value in the SIGNATURE HASH ALGORITHMS notification to indicate that no hashing is performed.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
This document defines a new value called "Identity" (5) in the "IKEv2 Hash Algorithms" registry for use in the SIGNATURE HASH ALGORITHMS notification.
Inserting this new value into the notification indicates that the receiver supports at least one signature algorithm that accepts messages of arbitrary size such as Ed25519 and Ed448.
Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the "Identity" hash and MUST NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the "Identity" hash.
The prehashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph, respectively) MUST NOT be used in IKE.
The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that accept an input of arbitrary size.
It MUST NOT be used if none of the supported and configured algorithms have this property.
On the other hand, there is no good reason to prehash the inputs where the signature algorithm has that property.
For this reason, implementations MUST have the "Identity" value in the SIGNATURE HASH
ALGORITHMS notification when EdDSA is supported and configured.
Implementations SHOULD NOT have other hash algorithms in the notification if all supported and configured signature algorithms have this property.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned the value 5 for the algorithm with the name "Identity" in the "IKEv2 Hash Algorithms" registry with this document as reference.
