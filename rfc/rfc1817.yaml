  - "Abstract\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is used in the Internet as\
    \ the\n   primary mechanism to improve scalability of the Internet routing\n \
    \  system. This document represents the IAB's (Internet Architecture\n   Board)\
    \ evaluation of the current and near term implications of CIDR\n   on organizations\
    \ that use Classful routing technology.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ([RFC1518], [RFC1519]) is\n\
    \   deployed in the Internet as the primary mechanism to improve scaling\n   property\
    \ of the Internet routing system. Essential to CIDR is the\n   generalization\
    \ of the concept of variable length subnet masks (VLSM)\n   and the elimination\
    \ of classes of network numbers (A, B, and C). The\n   interior (intra-domain)\
    \ routing protocols that support CIDR are OSPF,\n   RIP II, Integrated IS-IS,\
    \ and E-IGRP.  The exterior (inter-domain)\n   routing protocol that supports\
    \ CIDR is BGP-4.  Protocols like RIP,\n   BGP-3, EGP, and IGRP do not support\
    \ CIDR.\n"
- title: Implications of CIDR
  contents:
  - "Implications of CIDR\n   Deployment of CIDR has certain implications on the segments\
    \ of the\n   Internet that are still using routing technology that can not support\n\
    \   CIDR. Existing sites that rely solely on a default route for their\n   external\
    \ connectivity may not require support of VLSM capable routing\n   technology\
    \ for their interior routing and CIDR for their exterior\n   routing. All sites\
    \ lacking support for VLSM and CIDR capable routing\n   must rely on a default\
    \ route, which consequently may result in a\n   various degree of suboptimal routing.\
    \  Organizations that operate as\n   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are expected\
    \ to be able to support\n   VLSM and CIDR.\n   It is expected that in the near\
    \ future the IANA will instruct the\n   Internet Registries to begin allocating\
    \ IP addresses out of the\n   former Class A address space (64.0.0.0 through 126.0.0.0).\
    \ The\n   allocated blocks are going to be of variable size (based on the\n  \
    \ actual sites' requirements).  Sites that will use these addresses\n   will have\
    \ to support CIDR-capable routing protocols. All the\n   providers will be required\
    \ to support CIDR-capable routing protocols\n   as well. Sites that do not use\
    \ these addresses would be required to\n   continue relying on a default route,\
    \ which in turn may result in a\n   various degree of suboptimal routing. If a\
    \ site wants to avoid the\n   suboptimality (introduced by using default route),\
    \ the site will need\n   to transition to CIDR-capable routing protocols.\n"
