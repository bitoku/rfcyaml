  - "4.  Motivation for the option.\n   The SUPDUP-OUTPUT  protocol  provides  a means
    to access  the virtual\n   display  support provided by the SUPDUP protocol (see
    RFC 734) within\n   the context  of a standard  TELNET connection. This allows
    occasional\n   display-oriented  programs  at non-display-oriented  servers  to
    take\n   advantage  of the standardized  display  support  provided by SUPDUP.\n
    \  This cannot  be done with the standard  SUPDUP protocol or the TELNET\n   SUPDUP
    option (RFC 736), for they both require that all communication\n   after the negotiation
    \ to  use  SUPDUP  has  been  completed  proceed\n   according  to the protocol
    \ of RFC 734.   This places upon the server\n   total responsibility  for screen
    \ management  for the duration of the\n   connection,  which, by hypothesis, the
    non-display oriented server is\n   not willing to accept.\n   User TELNET  programs
    \ at display-oriented  user hosts provide  local\n   screen  management  by mapping
    \ the NVT commands of TELNET into local\n   screen   management   commands;   often,
    \  this  involves  scrolling,\n   end-of-page  processing, line clearing etc.
    \ The SUPDUP-OUTPUT option\n   allows  a display-oriented  application program
    at the server side to\n   take over  screen  management  explicitly,  via  the
    \ SUPDUP  display\n   control repertoire.  TELNET remains in effect throughout.
    \ The IAC IP\n   and other TELNET commands are still valid.\n   By means of the
    SUPDUP-OUTPUT  option,  display-oriented programs can\n   run  on  the  server
    \  host,  and  control  the  user  host's  screen\n   explicitly.   The user TELNET
    process sends a description of the user\n   terminal  (as specified in RFC 734)
    to the server TELNET process as a\n   subnegiotiation  block when the SUPDUP-OUTPUT
    \ negotiation  has  been\n   successfully  completed.   The server  TELNET  process
    sends explicit\n   screen  control commands via subnegotiation blocks to the user
    TELNET\n   process.\n"

  - "5.  Description of the option.\n   The SUPDUP-OUTPUT protocol may only be initiated
    by the server TELNET\n   process.   A server  TELNET  process wishing to take
    advantage of the\n   SUPDUP-OUTPUT  protocol will initiate a negotiation for it
    by sending\n   IAC WILL SUPDUP-OUTPUT.   The user  TELNET  process  must  accept
    \ or\n   refuse  the offer by  sending  IAC  DO  SUPDUP-OUTPUT  or  IAC  DON'T\n
    \  SUPDUP-OUTPUT.\n   If the user  TELNET  process  agrees  to  support  the  SUPDUP-OUTPUT\n
    \  option,   it  must  follow   the  sending  of  IAC  DO  SUPDUP-OUTPUT\n   immediately
    \  with  a  description  of  the  user's  terminal.   This\n   information  is
    described in RFC 734 as the \"terminal parameters.\" It\n   is to be sent as a
    series  of six-bit  bytes,  one byte per eight-bit\n"

    \  blocks as described below.\n   The server  TELNET  process  can specify explicit
    control of the user\n   host's  screen  by  the  sending  of  subnegotiation  blocks
    \ of  the\n   SUPDUP-OUTPUT  option.   The format  of such  a  block,  as  seen
    \ in\n   eight-bit TELNET data bytes, is:\n   IAC SB SUPDUP-OUTPUT 2 N TD1 TD2
    TD3 ... TDn SCx SCy IAC SE\n   The byte of \"2\"  is a command  code,  for compatibility

    characters\n   of SUPDUP  output  of RFC 734.  N is a byte containing a count
    of the\n   number  of TDm's in this transmission.  N may be zero, and may not
    be\n   greater than 254 (decimal).  SCx and SCy are two bytes specifying the\n
    \  anticipated horizontal and vertical (respectively) coordinates of the\n   cursor
    of the user host's screen after the latter has interpreted all\n   the %TDCODEs
    in this transmission.\n   The motivation  for the SCx SCy screen  position  specification
    is to\n   allow hosts running the ITS operating system, which will transmit the\n
    \  TDCODEs  directly  into the local output  system, to assert the \"main\n   program
    \ level\"  screen  position  without  any interpretation of the\n   transmitted
    TDCODE sequence by the user TELNET program.\n   The user TELNET  process must
    manage the position of the local cursor\n   with respect  to standard  TELNET
    NVT commands and output, and SUPDUP\n   OUTPUT  transmissions.   The user TELNET
    \ process may assume that the\n   server  TELNET  process is managing both NVT
    and SUPDUP-OUTPUT output\n   in an integrated way.\n   The SUPDUP-OUTPUT  option
    makes no statement about how input is sent;\n   this may be negotiated via other
    options.  By default, NVT input will\n   be used.   The user-to-server  screen
    \ management commands of RFC 734\n   are NOT implicitly handled by IAC WILL SUPDUP-OUTPUT.\n"
