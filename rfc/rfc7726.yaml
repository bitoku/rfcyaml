  - "1.  Background\n   [RFC5884] defines the procedures to bootstrap and maintain
    BFD\n   sessions for an <MPLS LSP, FEC> using a Label Switched Path (LSP)\n   ping.
    \ While Section 4 of [RFC5884] specifies that multiple BFD\n   sessions can be
    established for an <MPLS LSP, FEC> tuple, the\n   procedures to bootstrap and
    maintain multiple BFD sessions\n   concurrently over an <MPLS LSP, FEC> are not
    clearly specified.\n   Additionally, the procedures of removing BFD sessions bootstrapped
    on\n   the egress Label Switching Router (LSR) are unclear.  This document\n   provides
    those clarifications without deviating from the principles\n   outlined in [RFC5884].\n
    \  The ability for an ingress LSR to establish multiple BFD sessions for\n   an
    <MPLS LSP, FEC> tuple is useful in scenarios such as LSPs based on\n   Segment
    Routing [SEG-ROUTING] or LSPs having Equal-Cost Multipath\n   (ECMP).  The process
    used by the ingress LSR to determine the number\n   of BFD session(s) to be bootstrapped
    for an <MPLS LSP, FEC> tuple and\n   the mechanism used to construct those session(s)
    are outside the\n   scope of this document.\n"

    - "2.1.  Procedures for Establishment of Multiple BFD Sessions\n   Section 4 of
      [RFC5884] specifies the procedure for bootstrapping BFD\n   sessions using LSP
      ping.  It further states that \"a BFD session\n   SHOULD be established for
      each alternate path that is discovered.\"\n   This requirement has been the
      source of some ambiguity as the\n   procedures of establishing concurrent, multiple
      sessions have not\n   been explicitly specified.  This ambiguity can also be
      attributed in\n   part to the text in Section 7 of [RFC5884] forbidding either
      end to\n   change local discriminator values in BFD control packets after the\n
      \  session reaches the UP state.  The following procedures are described\n   to
      clarify the ambiguity based on the interpretation of the authors'\n   reading
      of the referenced sections:\n   At the ingress LSR:\n      MPLS LSP ping can
      be used to bootstrap multiple BFD sessions for a\n      given <MPLS LSP, FEC>.
      \ Each LSP ping MUST carry a different\n      discriminator value in the BFD
      discriminator TLV [RFC5884].\n   The egress LSR needs to perform the following:\n
      \     If the validation of the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) in the\n      MPLS
      Echo request message succeeds, check the discriminator\n      specified in the
      BFD discriminator TLV of the MPLS Echo request.\n      If there is no local
      session that corresponds to the (remote)\n      discriminator received in the
      MPLS Echo request, a new session is\n      bootstrapped and a local discriminator
      is allocated.  The\n      validation of a FEC is a necessary condition to be
      satisfied to\n      create a new BFD session at the egress LSR.  However, the
      policy\n      or procedure, if any, to be applied by the egress LSR before\n
      \     allowing a new BFD session to be created is outside the scope of\n      this
      document.  Such policies or procedures could consider\n      availability of
      system resources before allowing a session to be\n      created.  When the egress
      LSR disallows the creation of a BFD\n      session due to policy, it MUST drop
      the MPLS Echo request message.\n      Ensure the uniqueness of the <MPLS LSP,
      FEC, Remote Discriminator>\n      tuple.\n      Except for the clarification
      mentioned above, the remaining\n      procedures of BFD session establishment
      are as specified in\n      Sections 4-6 of [RFC5884].\n"

    - "2.3.  Procedures for Removing BFD Sessions at the Egress LSR\n   [RFC5884]
      does not specify an explicit procedure for deleting BFD\n   sessions.  The procedure
      for removing a BFD session established by an\n   out-of-band discriminator exchange
      using the MPLS LSP ping can\n   improve resource management (e.g., memory),
      especially in scenarios\n   involving thousands or more of such sessions.  A
      few observations are\n   made here:\n      The BFD session MAY be removed in
      the egress LSR if the BFD\n      session transitions from UP to DOWN.  This
      can either be done\n      immediately after the BFD session transitions from
      UP to DOWN or\n      after the expiry of a configurable timer started after
      the BFD\n      session state transitions from UP to DOWN at the egress LSR to\n
      \     reduce flapping by adding hysteresis.\n      The BFD session on the egress
      LSR MAY be removed by the ingress\n      LSR by using the BFD diagnostic code
      AdminDown(7) as specified in\n      [RFC5880].  When the ingress LSR wants to
      remove a session without\n      triggering any state change at the egress, it
      MAY transmit BFD\n      packets indicating the State as Down(1), diagnostic
      code\n      AdminDown(7) detectMultiplier number of times.  Upon receiving\n
      \     such a packet, the egress LSR MAY remove the BFD session, without\n      triggering
      a change of state.\n      The procedures to be followed at the egress LSR when
      BFD\n      session(s) remain in the DOWN state for a significant amount of\n
      \     time is a local matter.  Such procedures are outside the scope of\n      this
      document.\n      All BFD sessions established with the FEC MUST be removed\n
      \     automatically if the FEC is removed.\n      The egress MUST use the discriminators
      exchanged when the session\n      was brought UP to indicate any session state
      change to the\n      ingress.  The egress SHOULD reset this to zero after transmitting\n
      \     bfd.detectMult number of packets if the BFD session transitions to\n      DOWN
      state.\n"

    - "2.4.  Changing Discriminators for a BFD Session\n   The discriminators of a
      BFD session established over an MPLS LSP\n   cannot be changed when it is in
      UP state.  The BFD session could be\n   removed after a graceful transition
      to AdminDown state using the BFD\n   diagnostic code AdminDown.  A new session
      could be established with a\n   different discriminator.  The initiation of
      the transition from the\n   UP to DOWN state can be done by either the ingress
      LSR or the egress\n   LSR.\n"

  - "3.  Backwards Compatibility\n   The procedures clarified by this document are
    fully backward\n   compatible with an existing implementation of [RFC5884].  While
    the\n   capability to bootstrap and maintain multiple BFD sessions may not be\n
    \  present in current implementations, the procedures outlined by this\n   document
    can be implemented as a software upgrade without affecting\n   existing sessions.
    \ In particular, the egress LSR needs to support\n   multiple BFD sessions per
    <MPLS LSP, FEC> before the ingress LSR is\n   upgraded.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document clarifies the mechanism to bootstrap
    multiple BFD\n   sessions per <MPLS LSP, FEC>.  BFD sessions, naturally, use system\n
    \  and network resources.  More BFD sessions means more resources will\n   be
    used.  It is highly important to ensure that only a minimum number\n   of BFD
    sessions are provisioned per FEC and that bootstrapped BFD\n   sessions are properly
    deleted when they are no longer required.\n   Additionally, security measures
    described in [RFC4379] and [RFC5884]\n   are to be followed.\n"
