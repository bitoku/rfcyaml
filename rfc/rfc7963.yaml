    \ ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to control the\n   full\
    \ set of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features.  However, these\n   specifications\
    \ do not cover the additional Optical channel Data Unit\n   (ODU) containers defined\
    \ in G.Sup43 (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2).\n   This document defines new Signal\
    \ Types for these additional\n   containers.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC7139] updates the portions of text related to the Optical\
    \ channel\n   Data Unit (ODU) described in [RFC4328] to provide extensions to\n\
    \   Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to\n   support\
    \ control for [G.709-v3] in the OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-\n   TDM FLOWSPEC\
    \ objects.  However, it does not specify Signal Types for\n   the ODU1e, ODU3e1,\
    \ and ODU3e2 containers defined in [G.Sup43].  This\n   document provides RSVP-TE\
    \ signaling extensions to support these\n   additional Signal Types.\n   These\
    \ containers are non-standard data-plane frame formats (not\n   defined in ITU-T\
    \ Recommendations).  They are among some of the intra-\n   domain approaches used\
    \ in networks to transport 10GBASE-R signals in\n   optical transport networks.\
    \  As a supplement, [G.Sup43] does not\n   guarantee interoperability in the data\
    \ plane for these containers.\n"
- title: 2.  RSVP-TE Extension for Additional Signal Types
  contents:
  - "2.  RSVP-TE Extension for Additional Signal Types\n   [RFC7139] defines the format\
    \ of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM\n   SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects.\
    \  These traffic parameters\n   have a Signal Type field.  This document defines\
    \ the Signal Types for\n   ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2, as defined in the IANA Considerations\n\
    \   section.  They are allocated via the Specification Required policy\n   added\
    \ to the subregistry by [RFC7892].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any additional\
    \ security issues\n   beyond those identified in [RFC7139].\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA maintains the \"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label\
    \ Switching\n   (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters\" registry that contains the \"OTN\
    \ Signal\n   Type\" subregistry.  IANA has added the following three allocations\n\
    \   for ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2 in the subregistry via the\n   Specification\
    \ Required policy [RFC5226]:\n   Value            Type\n   -----            ----\n\
    \   23               ODU1e  (10Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])\n   26               ODU3e1\
    \ (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])\n   27               ODU3e2 (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])\n\
    \   These Signal Types are carried in the Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM\n   SENDER_TSPEC\
    \ and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].\n"
