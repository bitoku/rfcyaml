  - "1. Introduction\n   Interworking between X.400(88) and MIME is achieved by [4],\
    \ which\n   complements RFC-1327 [2], which in turn specifies the interworking\n\
    \   between X.400(88) and RFC-822 based mail.\n   Interworking between X.400(88)\
    \ and X.400 (84) is achieved by RFC-1328\n   [3]. That document does not describe\
    \ what to do in the case where\n   body parts arrive at the gateway that cannot\
    \ be adequately\n   represented in the X.400(84) system.\n   This document describes\
    \ how RFC-1328 must be modified in order to\n   provide adequate support for the\
    \ scenarios:\n      SMTP(MIME) -> X.400(84)\n      X.400(84) -> SMTP(MIME)\n \
    \  It replaces chapter 6 of RFC-1328. The rest of RFC-1328 is NOT\n   obsoleted.\n\
    \   NOTE: A desireable side-effect of HARPOON is that a standardized\n   method\
    \ for the identification and transmission of multimedia and\n   binary data (like\
    \ spreadsheets) between X.400/84 UAs is achieved.\n   While this method is not\
    \ compatible with current proprietary\n   approaches, we believe that it requires\
    \ less invasive changes to\n   current UAs than other possible methods.\n   This\
    \ memo updates RFC 1328.  HARPOON is a pure name, and has no\n   meaning.  Please\
    \ send comments to the MIME-MHS mailing list\n   <mime-mhs@surnet.nl>.\n"
- title: 2.  Basic approach
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic approach\n   The approach is to imagine that the connection X.400(84)\
    \ <->\n   SMTP(MIME) never happens. This, of course, is an illusion, but can be\n\
    \   a very useful illusion.\n   All mail will therefore go on one of the paths\n\
    \      X.400(84) -> X.400(88) -> SMTP(MIME)\n      SMTP(MIME) -> X.400(88) ->\
    \ X.400(84)\n   when it goes between a MIME user and an X.400(84) user.\n   The\
    \ approach at the interface between X.400(88) and X.400(84) is:\n      o  Convert\
    \ what you can\n      o  Encapsulate what you have to\n      o  Never drop a message\n\
    \   Of course, for X.400/88 body parts that are already defined in\n   X.400/84,\
    \ no downgrading should be done. In particular, multi-body\n   messages should\
    \ remain multi-body messages, IA5 messages including\n   IA5 messages encoded\
    \ as Extended Body Parts) should remain IA5\n   messages, and G3Fax messages should\
    \ remain G3Fax messages.\n"

    '
- title: 3.1.  EBP conversions to Basic
  contents:
  - "3.1.  EBP conversions to Basic\n   Some body parts are defined by X.400(88) as\
    \ having both a Basic form\n   and an Extended form. These are listed in Annex\
    \ B of X.420.\n   For all of these, the transformation from the Extended Body\
    \ Part to\n   the Basic Body Part takes the form of putting the PARAMETERS and\
    \ the\n   DATA members together in a SEQUENCE.\n   This transformation should\
    \ be applied by the gateway in order to\n   allow (for example) X.400(88) systems\
    \ that use the Extended form of\n   the IA5 body part to communicate with X.400(84)\
    \ systems.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Encapsulation format
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Encapsulation format\n   For any body part that cannot be used directly\
    \ in X.400(84), the\n   following IA5Text body part is made:\n   -  Content =\
    \ IA5String\n   -  First bytes of content: (the description is in USASCII, with\
    \ C\n      escape sequences used to represent control characters):\n       MIME-version:\
    \ <version>\\r\\n\n           Content-type: <the proper MIME content type>\\r\\\
    n\n         Content-transfer-encoding: <quoted-printable or base64>\\r\\n\n  \
    \       <Possibly other Content headings here, terminated by\\r\\n>\n        \
    \ \\r\\n\n      <Here follows the bytes of the content, as per [4], encoded in\
    \ the\n      proper encoding>\n   All implementations MUST place the MIME-version:\
    \ header first in the\n   body part. Headers that are placed by [2] and [4] into\
    \ other parts of\n   the message MUST NOT be placed in the MIME body part.\n \
    \  This includes RFC-822 headings carried as heading-extensions, which\n   must\
    \ be placed in a new IA5 body part starting with the string \"RFC-\n   822-HEADERS\"\
    , as specified in [2], Appendix G.\n   Other heading-extensions are still handled\
    \ as described in chapter 5\n   of RFC 1328: They are dropped.\n   Since all X.400(88)\
    \ body parts can be represented in MIME by using\n   the x400-bp MIME content-type,\
    \ this conversion will never fail.\n   In the reverse direction, any IA5 body\
    \ part that starts with the\n   token \"MIME-Version:\" will be subjected to conversion\
    \ according to\n   [4] before including the body part into an X.400(88) message.\n"
- title: 4.  Implications
  contents:
  - "4.  Implications\n   The implications are several:\n   - People with X.400(84)\
    \ readers who have the ability to save messages\n     to file will now be able\
    \ to save MIME multimedia messages\n   - People who can use features like the\
    \ \"Mailcaps\" file to identify\n     what to do about a bodypart can now grab\
    \ implementations of MIME\n     that can run as subprograms and achieve at least\
    \ some multimedia\n     functionality\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in [1] and [4] (beware\
    \ of trojans that\n   can hit you if your UA automagically starts programs for\
    \ you) are now\n   relevant also for X.400(84) systems.\n"
