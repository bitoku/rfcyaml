- title: 1.  Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy
  contents:
  - "1.  Pervasive Monitoring Is a Widespread Attack on Privacy\n   Pervasive Monitoring\
    \ (PM) is widespread (and often covert)\n   surveillance through intrusive gathering\
    \ of protocol artefacts,\n   including application content, or protocol metadata\
    \ such as headers.\n   Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g.,\
    \ correlation,\n   timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic\n\
    \   keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive\n   monitoring.\
    \  PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very\n   large scale, rather\
    \ than by introducing new types of technical\n   compromise.\n   The IETF community's\
    \ technical assessment is that PM is an attack on\n   the privacy of Internet\
    \ users and organisations.  The IETF community\n   has expressed strong agreement\
    \ that PM is an attack that needs to be\n   mitigated where possible, via the\
    \ design of protocols that make PM\n   significantly more expensive or infeasible.\
    \  Pervasive monitoring was\n   discussed at the technical plenary of the November\
    \ 2013 IETF meeting\n   [IETF88Plenary] and then through extensive exchanges on\
    \ IETF mailing\n   lists.  This document records the IETF community's consensus\
    \ and\n   establishes the technical nature of PM.\n   The term \"attack\" is used\
    \ here in a technical sense that differs\n   somewhat from common English usage.\
    \  In common English usage, an\n   attack is an aggressive action perpetrated\
    \ by an opponent, intended\n   to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked\
    \ party.  The term is\n   used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent\
    \ of\n   communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.  An\n \
    \  attack may change the content of the communication, record the\n   content\
    \ or external characteristics of the communication, or through\n   correlation\
    \ with other communication events, reveal information the\n   parties did not\
    \ intend to be revealed.  It may also have other\n   effects that similarly subvert\
    \ the intent of a communicator.\n   [RFC4949] contains a more complete definition\
    \ for the term \"attack\".\n   We also use the term in the singular here, even\
    \ though PM in reality\n   may consist of a multifaceted set of coordinated attacks.\n\
    \   In particular, the term \"attack\", used technically, implies nothing\n  \
    \ about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.  The\n   motivation for\
    \ PM can range from non-targeted nation-state\n   surveillance, to legal but privacy-unfriendly\
    \ purposes by commercial\n   enterprises, to illegal actions by criminals.  The\
    \ same techniques to\n   achieve PM can be used regardless of motivation.  Thus,\
    \ we cannot\n   defend against the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring\
    \ by\n   other actors no matter how benevolent some might consider them to be,\n\
    \   since the actions required of the attacker are indistinguishable from\n  \
    \ other attacks.  The motivation for PM is, therefore, not relevant for\n   how\
    \ PM is mitigated in IETF protocols.\n"
- title: 2.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring
  contents:
  - "2.  The IETF Will Work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring\n   \"Mitigation\" is\
    \ a technical term that does not imply an ability to\n   completely prevent or\
    \ thwart an attack.  Protocols that mitigate PM\n   will not prevent the attack\
    \ but can significantly change the threat.\n   (See the diagram on page 24 of\
    \ RFC 4949 for how the terms \"attack\"\n   and \"threat\" are related.)  This\
    \ can significantly increase the cost\n   of attacking, force what was covert\
    \ to be overt, or make the attack\n   more likely to be detected, possibly later.\n\
    \   IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet\n   communications\
    \ and there are guidelines [RFC3552] for applying these\n   in protocol design.\
    \  But those standards generally do not address PM,\n   the confidentiality of\
    \ protocol metadata, countering traffic\n   analysis, or data minimisation.  In\
    \ all cases, there will remain some\n   privacy-relevant information that is inevitably\
    \ disclosed by\n   protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once\
    \ only\n   available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely\n   accessible.\
    \  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide\n   range of similar\
    \ attacks.\n   It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties\n\
    \   of our standards.  The IETF will work to mitigate the technical\n   aspects\
    \ of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.\n   The ways in\
    \ which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as\n   mitigation and\
    \ attack techniques evolve and so are not described\n   here.\n   Those developing\
    \ IETF specifications need to be able to describe how\n   they have considered\
    \ PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work\n   to be published, be able\
    \ to justify related design decisions.  This\n   does not mean a new \"pervasive\
    \ monitoring considerations\" section is\n   needed in IETF documentation.  It\
    \ means that, if asked, there needs\n   to be a good answer to the question \"\
    Is pervasive monitoring relevant\n   to this work and if so, how has it been considered?\"\
    \n   In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing\n   technology\
    \ is reused, may significantly impact the vulnerability of a\n   protocol to PM.\
    \  Those developing IETF specifications therefore need\n   to consider mitigating\
    \ PM when making architectural decisions.\n   Getting adequate, early review of\
    \ architectural decisions including\n   whether appropriate mitigation of PM can\
    \ be made is important.\n   Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the\
    \ process is very\n   costly.\n   While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring\
    \ that might fit the\n   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any\
    \ attack, e.g.,\n   network management functions monitor packets or flows and\
    \ anti-spam\n   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring\
    \ can\n   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate\n  \
    \ transparency [RFC6962] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure\n   in\
    \ ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.  However, there\n   is clear\
    \ potential for monitoring mechanisms to be abused for PM, so\n   this tension\
    \ needs careful consideration in protocol design.  Making\n   networks unmanageable\
    \ to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome,\n   but ignoring PM would go against\
    \ the consensus documented here.  An\n   appropriate balance will emerge over\
    \ time as real instances of this\n   tension are considered.\n   Finally, the\
    \ IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not\n   control the implementation\
    \ or deployment of our specifications\n   (though IETF participants do develop\
    \ many implementations), nor does\n   the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol\
    \ stack.  Moreover, the\n   non-technical (e.g., legal and political) aspects\
    \ of mitigating\n   pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.\
    \  The\n   broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM,\
    \ if\n   it is to be fully addressed.\n   To summarise: current capabilities permit\
    \ some actors to monitor\n   content and metadata across the Internet at a scale\
    \ never before\n   seen.  This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.\n\
    \   The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate\n   pervasive\
    \ monitoring attacks.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Process Note\n   In the past, architectural statements of this sort, e.g.,\
    \ [RFC1984]\n   and [RFC2804], have been published as joint products of the Internet\n\
    \   Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board\n  \
    \ (IAB).  However, since those documents were published, the IETF and\n   IAB\
    \ have separated their publication \"streams\" as described in\n   [RFC4844] and\
    \ [RFC5741].  This document was initiated after\n   discussions in both the IESG\
    \ and IAB, but is published as an IETF-\n   stream consensus document, in order\
    \ to ensure that it properly\n   reflects the consensus of the IETF community\
    \ as a whole.\n"
