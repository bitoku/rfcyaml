- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the conventions for using several\n\
    \   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\n   key\
    \ package receipt and error content types [RFC7191].  Specifically,\n   it includes\
    \ conventions necessary to implement SignedData [RFC5652],\n   EnvelopedData [RFC5652],\
    \ EncryptedData [RFC5652], and\n   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].\n   This document\
    \ does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers\n   to previously defined\
    \ algorithms.  In fact, the algorithm\n   requirements in this document are the\
    \ same as those in [RFC5959],\n   [RFC6033], [RFC6160], [RFC6161], and [RFC6162]\
    \ with the following\n   exceptions: the content-encryption algorithm is AES in\
    \ Cipher Block\n   Chaining (CBC) mode as opposed to AES Key Wrap with Message\
    \ Length\n   Indicator (MLI) and the key-wrap algorithm is AES Key Wrap as opposed\n\
    \   to AES Key Wrap with MLI.  The rationale for the difference is that\n   the\
    \ receipt and error content types are not keys; therefore, AES Key\n   Wrap with\
    \ MLI is not appropriate for the content-encryption\n   algorithm.  If an implementation\
    \ is not using AES Key Wrap with MLI\n   as the content-encryption algorithm,\
    \ then there's no need to keep the\n   key-wrap algorithm the same as the content\
    \ encryption algorithm.\n   NOTE: [RFC7191] only requires that the key package\
    \ receipt be signed.\n"

  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\
    \ RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  SignedData
  contents:
  - "2.  SignedData\n   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MUST support\
    \ the\n   signature scheme RSA [RFC3370] and SHOULD support the signature\n  \
    \ schemes RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) [RFC4056] and\n   Digital\
    \ Signature Algorithm (DSA) [RFC3370].  Additionally,\n   implementations MUST\
    \ support the hash function SHA-256 [RFC5754] in\n   concert with these signature\
    \ schemes, and they SHOULD support the\n   hash function SHA-1 [RFC3370].  Implementations\
    \ can also choose the\n   to support Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\
    \ (ECDSA)\n   [RFC5753] and [RFC6090].\n"
- title: 3.  EnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "3.  EnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports EnvelopedData, then it MUST\
    \ implement\n   key transport and it MAY implement key agreement.\n   When key\
    \ transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be\n   supported, and RSA Encryption\
    \ Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption\n   Padding (RSAES-OAEP) [RFC3560] SHOULD\
    \ be supported.\n   When key agreement is used, Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral-static\n\
    \   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.  When key agreement is used, Elliptic\n   Curve\
    \ Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [RFC5753] [RFC6090] MAY be supported.\n   Regardless of\
    \ the key management technique choice, implementations\n   MUST support AES-128\
    \ in CBC mode [AES] as the content-encryption\n   algorithm.  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD support AES-256 in CBC mode [AES]\n   as the content-encryption algorithm.\n\
    \   When key agreement is used, the same length for the underlying block\n   algorithm\
    \ MUST be used.  If the content-encryption algorithm is\n   AES-128 in CBC mode,\
    \ then the key-wrap algorithm MUST be AES-128 Key\n   Wrap [RFC3394].  If the\
    \ content-encryption algorithm is AES-256 in\n   CBC mode, then the key-wrap algorithm\
    \ MUST be AES-256 Key Wrap\n   [RFC3394].\n"
- title: 4.  EncryptedData
  contents:
  - "4.  EncryptedData\n   If an implementation supports EncryptedData, then it MUST\
    \ implement\n   AES-128 in CBC mode [AES] and SHOULD implement AES-256 in CBC\
    \ mode\n   [AES].\n   NOTE: EncryptedData requires that keys be managed by other\
    \ means;\n   therefore, the only algorithm specified is the content-encryption\n\
    \   algorithm.\n"
- title: 5.  AuthEnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "5.  AuthEnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports AuthEnvelopedData, then\
    \ it MUST\n   implement the EnvelopedData recommendations except for the content-\n\
    \   encryption algorithm, which, in this case, MUST be AES-GCM [RFC5084];\n  \
    \ the 128-bit version MUST be implemented, and the 256-bit version\n   SHOULD\
    \ be implemented.  Implementations MAY also support AES-CCM\n   [RFC5084].\n"
- title: 6.  Public Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "6.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement SignedData, EnvelopedData,\
    \ and\n   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an\n\
    \   implementation supports RSA, RSASSA-PSS, DSA, RSAES-OAEP, or Diffie-\n   Hellman,\
    \ then it MUST support key lengths from 1024-bit to 2048-bit,\n   inclusive. \
    \ If an implementation supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST\n   support keys on\
    \ the P-256 curve [RFC6090].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3394],\
    \ [RFC3560],\n   [RFC4056], [RFC5084], [RFC5652], [RFC5753], and [RFC5754] apply.\n\
    \   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some algorithms\n   and\
    \ key sizes.  [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which\n   certain numbers\
    \ of bits of security are appropriate, and some\n   environments may find these\
    \ time frames useful.\n"
