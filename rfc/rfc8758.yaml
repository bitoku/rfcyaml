- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The usage of RC4 suites (also designated as \"arcfour\"\
    ) for SSH is\n   specified in [RFC4253] and [RFC4345].  [RFC4253] specifies the\n\
    \   allocation of the \"arcfour\" cipher for SSH.  [RFC4345] specifies and\n \
    \  allocates the \"arcfour128\" and \"arcfour256\" ciphers for SSH.  RC4\n   encryption\
    \ has known weaknesses [RFC7465] [RFC8429]; therefore, this\n   document starts\
    \ the deprecation process for their use in Secure Shell\n   (SSH) [RFC4253]. \
    \ Accordingly, [RFC4253] is updated to note the\n   deprecation of the RC4 ciphers,\
    \ and [RFC4345] is moved to Historic\n   status, as all ciphers it specifies MUST\
    \ NOT be used.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Updates to RFC 4253
  contents:
  - "2.  Updates to RFC 4253\n   [RFC4253] is updated to prohibit arcfour's use in\
    \ SSH.  [RFC4253],\n   Section 6.3 allocates the \"arcfour\" cipher by defining\
    \ a list of\n   defined ciphers in which the \"arcfour\" cipher appears as optional,\
    \ as\n   shown in Table 1.\n   | arcfour | OPTIONAL | the ARCFOUR stream cipher\
    \                    |\n   |         |          | with a 128-bit key         \
    \                  |\n   This document updates the status of the \"arcfour\" ciphers\
    \ in the list\n   found in [RFC4253], Section 6.3 by moving it from OPTIONAL to\
    \ MUST\n   NOT.\n   | arcfour | MUST NOT | the ARCFOUR stream cipher         \
    \           |\n   |         |          | with a 128-bit key                  \
    \         |\n   [RFC4253] defines the \"arcfour\" ciphers with the following text:\n\
    \   |  The \"arcfour\" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit\n   |\
    \  keys.  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the\n   |  RC4\
    \ cipher [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) has problems with weak\n   |  keys, and\
    \ should be used with caution.\n   This document updates [RFC4253], Section 6.3\
    \ by replacing the text\n   above with the following text:\n   |  The \"arcfour\"\
    \ cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit\n   |  keys.  The Arcfour cipher\
    \ is compatible with the RC4 cipher\n   |  [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) has\
    \ known weaknesses [RFC7465]\n   |  [RFC8429] and MUST NOT be used.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has updated the \"Encryption Algorithm Names\"\
    \ subregistry in\n   the \"Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters\" registry [IANA].\
    \  The\n   registration procedure is IETF review, which is achieved by this\n\
    \   document.  The registry has been updated as follows:\n           | Encryption\
    \ Algorithm Name | Reference | Note     |\n           | arcfour              \
    \     | RFC 8758  | HISTORIC |\n           | arcfour128                | RFC 8758\
