- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org)\
    \ is\n   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols\n  \
    \ which have been designed, created or are maintained by the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2780 [RFC2780] provides the IANA\n   guidance in the\
    \ assignment of parameters for fields in newly\n   developed protocols.  This\
    \ memo expands on section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780\n   and attempts to codify existing\
    \ IANA practice used in the assignment\n   IPv4 multicast addresses.\n   The terms\
    \ \"Specification Required\", \"Expert Review\", \"IESG Approval\",\n   \"IETF\
    \ Consensus\", and \"Standards Action\", are used in this memo to\n   refer to\
    \ the processes described in [RFC2434].  The keywords MUST,\n   MUST NOT, MAY,\
    \ OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\n   SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are\
    \ to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n   In general, due\
    \ to the relatively small size of the IPv4 multicast\n   addresses space, further\
    \ assignment of IPv4 multicast address space\n   is recommended only in limited\
    \ circumstances.  Specifically, the IANA\n   should only assign addresses in those\
    \ cases where the dynamic\n   selection (SDP/SAP), GLOP, SSM or Administratively\
    \ Scoped address\n   spaces cannot be used.  The guidelines described below are\
    \ reflected\n   in http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.\n"
- title: 2. Definition of Current Assignment Practice
  contents:
  - "2. Definition of Current Assignment Practice\n   Unlike IPv4 unicast address\
    \ assignment, where blocks of addresses are\n   delegated to regional registries,\
    \ IPv4 multicast addresses are\n   assigned directly by the IANA.  Current assignments\
    \ appear as follows\n   [IANA]:\n   224.0.0.0   - 224.0.0.255     (224.0.0/24)\
    \  Local Network Control Block\n   224.0.1.0   - 224.0.1.255     (224.0.1/24)\
    \  Internetwork Control Block\n   224.0.2.0   - 224.0.255.0                  \
    \ AD-HOC Block\n   224.1.0.0   - 224.1.255.255   (224.1/16)    ST Multicast Groups\n\
    \   224.2.0.0   - 224.2.255.255   (224.2/16)    SDP/SAP Block\n   224.252.0.0\
    \ - 224.255.255.255               DIS Transient Block\n   225.0.0.0   - 231.255.255.255\
    \               RESERVED\n   232.0.0.0   - 232.255.255.255 (232/8)       Source\
    \ Specific Multicast\n                                               Block\n \
    \  233.0.0.0   - 233.255.255.255 (233/8)       GLOP Block\n   234.0.0.0   - 238.255.255.255\
    \               RESERVED\n   239.0.0.0   - 239.255.255.255 (239/8)       Administratively\
    \ Scoped\n                                               Block\n   The IANA generally\
    \ assigns addresses from the Local Network Control,\n   Internetwork Control,\
    \ and AD-HOC blocks.  Assignment guidelines for\n   each of these blocks, as well\
    \ as for the Source Specific Multicast,\n   GLOP and Administratively Scoped Blocks,\
    \ are described below.\n"
- title: 3. Local Network Control Block (224.0.0/24)
  contents:
  - "3. Local Network Control Block (224.0.0/24)\n   Addresses in the Local Network\
    \ Control block are used for protocol\n   control traffic that is not forwarded\
    \ off link.  Examples of this\n   type of use include OSPFIGP All Routers (224.0.0.5)\
    \ [RFC2328].\n"
- title: 3.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780 [RFC2780],\
    \ assignments from the\n   Local Network Control block follow an Expert Review,\
    \ IESG Approval or\n   Standards Action process.  See [IANA] for the current set\
    \ of\n   assignments.\n"
- title: 4. Internetwork Control Block (224.0.1/24)
  contents:
  - "4. Internetwork Control Block (224.0.1/24)\n   Addresses in the Internetwork\
    \ Control block are used for protocol\n   control that must be forwarded through\
    \ the Internet.  Examples\n   include 224.0.1.1 (NTP [RFC2030]) and 224.0.1.68\
    \ (mdhcpdiscover\n   [RFC2730]).\n"
- title: 4.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "4.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC 2780 [RFC2780],\
    \ assignments from the\n   Internetwork Control block follow an Expert Review,\
    \ IESG Approval or\n   Standards Action process.  See [IANA] for the current set\
    \ of\n   assignments.\n"
- title: 5. AD-HOC Block (224.0.2.0/24 - 224.0.255.0/24)
  contents:
  - "5. AD-HOC Block (224.0.2.0/24 - 224.0.255.0/24)\n   Addresses in the AD-HOC block\
    \ have traditionally been assigned for\n   those applications that don't fit in\
    \ either the Local or Internetwork\n   Control blocks.  These addresses are globally\
    \ routed and are\n   typically used by applications that require small blocks\
    \ of\n   addressing (e.g., less than a /24).\n"
- title: 5.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "5.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   In general, the IANA SHOULD NOT assign addressing\
    \ in the AD-HOC\n   Block.  However, the IANA may under special special circumstances,\n\
    \   assign addressing from this block.  Pursuant to section 4.4.2 of RFC\n   2780\
    \ [RFC2780], assignments from the AD-HOC block follow an Expert\n   Review, IESG\
    \ Approval or Standards Action process.  See [IANA] for\n   the current set of\
    \ assignments.\n"
- title: 6. SDP/SAP Block (224.2/16)
  contents:
  - "6. SDP/SAP Block (224.2/16)\n   Addresses in the SDP/SAP block are used by applications\
    \ that receive\n   addresses through the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974]\
    \ for use\n   via applications like the session directory tool (such as SDR [SDR]).\n"
- title: 6.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "6.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Since addresses in the SDP/SAP block are chosen\
    \ randomly from the\n   range of addresses not already in use [RFC2974], no IANA\
    \ assignment\n   policy is required.  Note that while no additional IANA assignment\
    \ is\n   required, addresses in the SDP/SAP block are explicitly for use by\n\
    \   SDP/SAP and MUST NOT be used for other purposes.\n"
- title: 7. Source Specific Multicast Block (232/8)
  contents:
  - "7. Source Specific Multicast Block (232/8)\n   The Source Specific Multicast\
    \ (SSM) is an extension of IP Multicast\n   in which traffic is forwarded to receivers\
    \ from only those multicast\n   sources for which the receivers have explicitly\
    \ expressed interest,\n   and is primarily targeted at one-to-many (broadcast)\
    \ applications.\n   Note that this block as initially assigned to the VMTP transient\n\
    \   groups [IANA].\n"
- title: 7.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "7.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Because the SSM model essentially makes the entire\
    \ multicast address\n   space local to the host, no IANA assignment policy is\
    \ required.\n   Note, however, that while no additional IANA assignment is required,\n\
    \   addresses in the SSM block are explicitly for use by SSM and MUST NOT\n  \
    \ be used for other purposes.\n"
- title: 8. GLOP Block (233/8)
  contents:
  - "8. GLOP Block (233/8)\n   Addresses in the GLOP block are globally scoped statically\
    \ assigned\n   addresses.  The assignment is made by mapping a domain's autonomous\n\
    \   system number into the middle two octets of 233.X.Y.0/24.  The\n   mapping\
    \ and assignment is defined in [RFC2770].\n"
- title: 8.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "8.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Because addresses in the GLOP block are algorithmically\
    \ pre-assigned,\n   no IANA assignment policy is required.  In addition, RFC 3138\n\
    \   [RFC3138] delegates assignment of the GLOP sub-block mapped by the\n   RFC\
    \ 1930 [RFC1930] private AS space (233.252.0.0 - 233.255.255.255)\n   to the Internet\
    \ Routing Registries.  Note that while no additional\n   IANA assignment is required,\
    \ addresses in the GLOP  block are\n   assigned for use as defined in RFC 2770\
    \ and MUST NOT be used for\n   other purposes.\n"
- title: 9. Administratively Scoped Address Block (239/8)
  contents:
  - "9. Administratively Scoped Address Block (239/8)\n   Addresses in the Administratively\
    \ Scoped Address block are for local\n   use within a domain and are described\
    \ in [RFC2365].\n"
- title: 9.1. Assignment Guidelines
  contents:
  - "9.1. Assignment Guidelines\n   Since addresses in this block are local to a domain,\
    \ no IANA\n   assignment policy is required.\n"
- title: 9.1.1. Relative Offsets
  contents:
  - "9.1.1. Relative Offsets\n   The relative offsets [RFC2365] are used to ensure\
    \ that a service can\n   be located independent of the extent of the enclosing\
    \ scope (see RFC\n   2770 for details).  Since there are only 256 such offsets,\
    \ the IANA\n   should only assign a relative offset to a protocol that provides\
    \ an\n   infrastructure supporting service.  Examples of such services include\n\
    \   the Session Announcement Protocol [RFC2974].  Pursuant to section\n   4.4.2\
    \ of RFC 2780 [RFC2780], assignments of Relative Offsets follow\n   an Expert\
    \ Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action process.  See\n   [IANA] for the current\
    \ set of assignments.\n"
- title: 10. Annual Review
  contents:
  - "10. Annual Review\n   Given the dynamic nature of IPv4 multicast and its associated\
    \ infra-\n   structure, and the previously undocumented IPv4 multicast address\n\
    \   assignment guidelines, the IANA should conduct an annual review of\n   currently\
    \ assigned addresses.\n"
- title: 10.1. Address Reclamation
  contents:
  - "10.1. Address Reclamation\n   During the review described above, addresses that\
    \ were mis-assigned\n   should, where possible, be reclaimed or reassigned.\n\
    \   The IANA should also review assignments in the AD-HOC, DIS Transient\n   Groups,\
    \ and ST Multicast Groups blocks and reclaim those addresses\n   that are not\
    \ in use on the global Internet (i.e, those applications\n   which can use SSM,\
    \ GLOP, or Administratively Scoped addressing, or\n   are not globally routed).\n"
- title: 11. Use of IANA Reserved Addresses
  contents:
  - "11. Use of IANA Reserved Addresses\n   Applications MUST NOT use addressing in\
    \ the IANA reserved blocks.\n"
- title: 12. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12. Security Considerations\n   The assignment guidelines described in this document\
    \ do not alter the\n   security properties of either the Any Source or Source\
    \ Specific\n   multicast service models.\n"
