  - "                         ROLE MAILBOXES\nOccasionally it is necessary to send\
    \ mail to someone on the net who is\nknown only as the incumbent in an official\
    \ position.  Often the mail is\nundeliverable because of employee turnover.  \n\
    We have also had such a problem at NBS and have therefore created MAIL\naddress\
    \ synonyms such as SYSTEMS, MANAGEMENT, and LIAISON to ensure that\nmail is correctly\
    \ delivered no matter who the incumbent happens to be.  \nI suggest that all systems\
    \ which permit MAIL address synonyms install\nthem.  I further suggest that the\
    \ NIC or the ARPANet management select a\nstandardized set of synonyms, thus increasing\
    \ their utility.\n"
