- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used for file-sharing, streaming,\
    \ and\n   real-time communications exchange large amounts of data in\n   connections\
    \ established among the peers themselves and are\n   responsible for an important\
    \ part of the Internet traffic.  Since\n   applications have generally no knowledge\
    \ of the underlying network\n   topology, the traffic they generate is frequent\
    \ cause of congestions\n   in inter-domain links and significantly contributes\
    \ to the raising of\n   transit costs paid by network operators and Internet Service\n\
    \   Providers (ISPs).\n   One approach to reduce congestions and transit costs\
    \ caused by P2P\n   applications consists of enhancing the peer selection process\
    \ with\n   the introduction of proximity information.  This allows the peers to\n\
    \   identify the topologically closer resource among all the instances of\n  \
    \ the resources they are searching through.  Several solutions\n   following such\
    \ an approach have recently been proposed [Choffnes]\n   [Aggarwal] [Xie], some\
    \ of which are now being considered for\n   standardization in the IETF [ALTO].\
    \  While this document serves to\n   inform the protocol work going on in the\
    \ IETF ALTO working group,\n   this document does not specify a protocol of any\
    \ kind, nor is this\n   document a product of the IETF.\n   Despite extensive\
    \ research based on simulations and field trials, it\n   is hard to predict how\
    \ proposed solutions would perform in a real-\n   world systems made of millions\
    \ of peers.  For this reason, possible\n   effects and side effects of optimization\
    \ techniques based on P2P\n   traffic localization have been a matter of frequent\
    \ debate.  This\n   document describes some of the most interesting effects, referencing\n\
    \   relevant studies that have addressed them and trying to determine\n   whether\
    \ and in what measure they are likely to happen.\n   Each possible effect -- or\
    \ myth -- is examined in three phases:\n   o  Facts: in which a list of relevant\
    \ data is presented, usually\n      collected from simulations or field trials;\n\
    \   o  Discussion: in which the reasons supporting and opposing the myth\n   \
    \   are discussed based on the facts previously listed;\n   o  Conclusions: in\
    \ which the authors try to express a reasonable\n      measure of the plausibility\
    \ of the myth.\n      Note: Even though a myth is an unfounded or false notion,\
    \ we have\n      nonetheless chosen to provocatively assign a confirmation\n \
    \     likelihood to each of the myths in Section 3.  This is a\n      whimsical,\
    \ but we believe effective, attempt that was inspired by\n      the TV show \"\
    Mythbusters\", wherein each myth was \"busted\", deemed\n      \"plausible\",\
    \ or \"confirmed\" by the end of the show.\n   This document represents the consensus\
    \ of the P2PRG.  The first\n   version of this document appeared in February 2009,\
    \ and there was a\n   sizeable discussion on the contents of the document thereafter.\
    \  The\n   document has been improved by incorporating comments from experts in\n\
    \   the area of peer-to-peer networks as well as casual, but informed,\n   users\
    \ of such networks.  The IRTF community has helped improve the\n   number of facts\
    \ and quality of discussion and enhanced the\n   trustworthiness of the conclusions\
    \ documented.\n   This document essentially represents the view of the participating\n\
    \   P2PRG IRTF community between 2009 and the latter part of 2010; as\n   such,\
    \ it is like a snapshot: frozen in time.  While some aspects are\n   confirmed\
    \ with references to pertinent literature, other aspects\n   reflect the state\
    \ of discussions in the RG at the time of writing and\n   may require further\
    \ investigation beyond the publication date of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   Terminology defined in [RFC5693] is reused here; other definitions\n\
    \   should be consistent with the terminology in that document.\n   Seeder:\n\
    \      A peer that has a complete copy of the content it is sharing, and\n   \
    \   still offers it for upload.  The term \"seeder\" is adopted from\n      BitTorrent\
    \ terminology and is used in this document to indicate\n      upload-only peers\
    \ that are also in other kinds of P2P\n      applications.\n   Leecher:\n    \
    \  A peer that has not yet completed the download of a specific\n      content\
    \ (but usually has already started offering for upload the\n      part it is in\
    \ possession of).  The term \"leecher\" is adopted from\n      BitTorrent terminology\
    \ and is used in this document to indicate\n      peers that are both uploading\
    \ and downloading and are used in\n      other kinds of P2P applications.\n  \
    \ Swarm:\n      The group of peers that are uploading and/or downloading pieces\
    \ of\n      the same content.  The term \"swarm\" is commonly used in\n      BitTorrent,\
    \ to indicate all seeders and leechers exchanging chunks\n      of a particular\
    \ file; however, in this document, it is used more\n      generally (e.g., in\
    \ the case of P2P streaming applications) to\n      refer to all peers receiving\
    \ and/or transmitting the same media\n      stream.\n   Tit-for-Tat:\n      A\
    \ content exchange strategy where the amount of data sent by a\n      leecher\
    \ to another leecher is roughly equal to the amount of data\n      received from\
    \ it.  P2P applications, most notably BitTorrent,\n      adopt such an approach\
    \ to maximize resources shared by the users.\n   Surplus Mode:\n      The status\
    \ of a swarm where the upload capacity exceeds the\n      download demand.  A\
    \ swarm in surplus mode is often referred to as\n      \"well seeded\".\n   Transit:\n\
    \      The service through which a network can exchange IP packets with\n    \
    \  all other networks to which it is not directly connected.  The\n      transit\
    \ service is always regulated by a contract, according to\n      which the customer\
    \ (i.e., a network operator or an ISP) pays the\n      transit provider per amount\
    \ of data exchanged.\n   Peering:\n      The direct interconnection between two\
    \ separate networks for the\n      purpose of exchanging traffic without requiring\
    \ a transit\n      provider.  Peering is usually regulated by agreements taking\
    \ in\n      account the amount of traffic generated by each party in each\n  \
    \    direction.\n"

    \   2.  Data observed in Comcast's P4P trial [RFC5632] show a 34%\n       reduction\

    \     have also shown that on a global scale, i.e., 214,443 torrents,\n      \

    \ show an increase\n       in download rates between 13% and 85%.  Interestingly,\
    \ the data\n       collected in the experiment also indicate that fine-grained\n\
    \       localization is less effective in improving download performance\n   \
    \    compared to lower levels of localization.\n   3.  Data collected in the Ono\
    \ experiment [Choffnes] show a 31%\n       average download rate improvement.\n\
    \       *  In networks where the ISP provides higher bandwidth for\n         \
    \ in-network traffic (e.g., as in the case of a Romanian ISP\n          (RDSNET),\
    \ described in [Choffnes]), the increase is\n          significantly higher.\n\
    \       *  In networks with relatively low uplink bandwidth (as the case\n   \
    \       of Easynet, described in [Choffnes]), traffic localization\n         \
    \ slightly degrades application performance.\n   4.  Simulations of the \"oracle-based\"\

    \ in download times\n       between 16% and 34%.\n   5.  Simulations by Bell Labs\
    \ [Seetharaman] indicate that localization\n       is not as effective in all\
    \ scenarios and that the user experience\n       can suffer in certain locality-aware\
    \ swarms based on the actual\n       implementation of locality.\n   6.  Experiments\
    \ with real clients run by researchers at INRIA\n       [LeBlond] have shown that\
    \ the measured application performance is\n       a function of the degree of\

    \ traffic.  Furthermore, they\n       have also shown that, in the case of severe\

    \       regular BitTorrent.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Discussion

  - "3.2.2.  Discussion\n   It seems that traffic localization techniques often cause\
    \ an\n   improvement in application performance.  However, it must be noted\n\
    \   that such beneficial effects heavily depend on the network\n   infrastructures.\
    \  In some cases, for example, in networks with\n   relatively low uplink bandwidth,\
    \ localization seems to be useless if\n   not harmful.  Also, beneficial effects\
    \ depend on the swarm size;\n   imposing locality when only a small set of local\

- title: 3.4.2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.4.2.  Discussion\n   This is a key topic for network operators and ISPs, and\
    \ it certainly\n   deserves to be analyzed more accurately.  Some random thoughts\n\
    \   follow.\n   It seems reasonable to expect different effects depending on the\n\
    \   kinds of agreements.  For example:\n   o  ISPs with different customer bases:\
    \ the ISP whose customers\n      generate more P2P traffic can achieve a greater\
    \ reduction of\n      cross-domain traffic and thus could probably be in a position\
    \ to\n      renegotiate the contract ruling the peering agreement;\n   o  ISPs\
    \ with similar customer bases:\n      *  ISPs with different access technologies:\
    \ customers of the ISP\n         that provides higher bandwidth -- and, in particular,\
    \ higher\n         uplink bandwidth -- will have more incentives for keeping their\n\
    \         P2P traffic local.  Consequently, the ISP with a better\n         infrastructure\
    \ will be able to achieve a greater reduction in\n         cross-domain traffic\
    \ and will be probably in a position to\n         re-negotiate the peering agreement;\n\
    \      *  ISPs with similar access technologies: both ISPs would achieve\n   \
    \      roughly the same reduction in cross-domain traffic; thus, the\n       \
    \  conditions under which the peering agreement had been\n         established\
    \ would not change much.\n   As a consequence of the reasoning above, it seems\
    \ sensible to expect\n   that the simple fact that one ISP starts localizing its\
    \ P2P traffic\n   will be a strong incentive for the ISPs it peers with to do\
    \ that as\n   well.\n   It's worth noting that traffic manipulation techniques\
    \ have been\n   reportedly used by ISPs to obtain peering agreements [Norton]\
    \ with\n   larger ISPs.  One of the most used techniques involves injecting\n\
    \   forged traffic into the target ISP's network, in order to increase\n   its\
    \ transit costs.  Such a technique aims at increasing the relevance\n   of the\
    \ source ISP in the target's transit bill and thus motivate the\n   latter to\
    \ sign a peering agreement.  However, traffic injection is\n   exclusively unidirectional\
    \ and easy to detect.  On the other hand, if\n   a localization-like service were\
    \ used to direct P2P requests toward\n   the target network, the resulting traffic\
    \ would appear fully\n   legitimate and, since in popular applications that follow\
    \ the\n   tit-for-tat approach peers tend to upload to the peers they download\n\
    \   from, in many cases also bidirectional.\n"

  - "3.5.2.  Discussion\n   It is actually very hard to predict how the economics\
    \ of transit\n   provision would be affected by the tricks some transit providers\n\
    \   could play on their customers making use of P2P traffic localization\n   --\
    \ or, in this particular case, de-localization -- techniques.  This\n   is also\
    \ a key topic for ISPs, definitely worth an accurate\n   investigation.\n   Probably,\
    \ the only lesson transit and peering agreement have taught\n   us so far [CogentVsAOL]\
    \ [SprintVsCogent] is that, at the end of the\n   day, no economic factor, no\
    \ matter how relevant it is, is able to\n   isolate different networks from each\
    \ other.\n"

  - "3.6.  Swarm Weakening\n   Peer selection techniques based on locality information\
    \ are certainly\n   beneficial in areas where the density of peers is high enough,\
    \ but\n   may cause damages otherwise.  Some studies have tried to understand\n\
    \   to what extent locality can be pushed without damaging peers in\n   isolated\
    \ parts of the network.\n"

  - "3.6.1.  Facts\n   1.  Experiments with real BitTorrent clients run by researchers\
    \ at\n       INRIA [LeBlond] have shown that, in BitTorrent, even when peer\n\
    \       selection is heavily based on locality, swarms do not get\n       damaged.\n\
    \   2.  Simulations by Bell Labs [Seetharaman] indicate that the user\n      \
    \ experience can suffer in certain locality-aware swarms based on\n       the\
    \ actual implementation of locality.\n"
- title: 3.6.2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.6.2.  Discussion\n   It seems reasonable to expect that excessive traffic localization\n\
    \   will cause some degree of deterioration in P2P swarms based on the\n   tit-for-tat\
    \ approach, and the damages of such deterioration will\n   likely affect most\
    \ users in networks with lower density of peers.\n   However, while [LeBlond]\
    \ shows that BitTorrent is extremely robust,\n   the level of tolerance to locality\
    \ for different P2P algorithms\n   should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.7.  Improved P2P Caching\n   P2P caching has been proposed as a possible solution\
    \ to reduce cross-\n   domain as well as uplink P2P traffic.  Since the cache\
    \ servers\n   ultimately act as seeders, a cache-aware localization service would\n\
    \   allow a seamless integration of a caching infrastructure with P2P\n   applications\
    \ [EDGE-CACHES].\n"
- title: 3.7.1.  Facts
  contents:
  - "3.7.1.  Facts\n   1.  A traffic analysis performed in a major Israeli ISP [Leibowitz]\n\
    \       has shown that P2P traffic has a theoretical caching potential of\n  \
    \     67% byte-hit-rate.\n"
- title: 3.7.2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.7.2.  Discussion\n   P2P caching may be beneficial for both ISPs and network\
    \ users, and\n   locality-based optimizations may help the ISP to direct the peers\n\
    \   towards caches.  Anyway, it is hard to figure at this point in time\n   if\
    \ the positive effects of localization will make caching superfluous\n   or not\
    \ economically justifiable for the ISP.\n"
