- title: 3.1.  Extra Colon in IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Extra Colon in IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address\n   The ABNF [4] for generating\
    \ IPv6 literals in RFC 3261 [1] is\n   incorrect.  When generating IPv4-mapped\
    \ IPv6 addresses, the\n   production rule may actually generate the following\
    \ construct:\n   [2001:db8:::192.0.2.1] - Note the extra colon before the IPv4\n\
    \   address.\n   The correct construct, of course, would only include two colons\n\
    \   before the IPv4 address.\n      Historically, the ABNF pertaining to IPv6\
    \ references in RFC 3261\n      was derived from Appendix B of RFC 2373 [7], which\
    \ was flawed to\n      begin with (see errata for RFC 2373 [8]).  RFC 2373 has\
    \ been\n      subsequently obsoleted by RFC 4291 [6].\n   The ABNF for IPv6reference\
    \ is reproduced from RFC 3261 below:\n     IPv6reference  =  \"[\" IPv6address\
    \ \"]\"\n     IPv6address    =  hexpart [ \":\" IPv4address ]\n     IPv4address\
    \    =  1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT\n     hexpart  \
    \      =  hexseq / hexseq \"::\" [ hexseq ] / \"::\" [ hexseq ]\n     hexseq \
    \        =  hex4 *( \":\" hex4)\n     hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG\n   Note that\
    \ the ambiguity occurs in the <IPv6address> production rule\n   where the <IPv4address>\
    \ non-terminal is prefixed by the \":\" token.\n   Because the <hexpart> production\
    \ rule is defined such that two of its\n   alternatives already include the \"\
    ::\" token, this may yield to the\n   faulty construction of an IPv6-mapped IPv4\
    \ address with an extra\n   colon when expanding those alternatives.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Comparing URIs with Textual Representation of IP Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Comparing URIs with Textual Representation of IP Addresses\n   In SIP,\
    \ URIs are compared for a variety of reasons.  Registrars\n   compare URIs when\
    \ they receive a binding update request, for\n   instance.  Section 19.1.4 of\
    \ RFC 3261 [1] provides the rules for\n   comparing URIs.  Among other rules,\
    \ it states that:\n      For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and\
    \ port\n      components must match.\n   Does the above rule then imply that the\
    \ following URIs are equal:\n      sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128] = sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]?\n\
    \      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1] = sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]?\n      sip:bob@[0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38]\
    \ = sip:bob@\n      [::FFFF:129.144.52.38]?\n   In all of the above examples,\
    \ the textual representation of the IPv6\n   address is different, but these addresses\
    \ are binary equivalents\n   (implementers are also urged to consult Section 5\
    \ of this document\n   for recommendations on IPv6 address text representations).\
    \  Section\n   19.1.4 of RFC 3261 does not provide any rule for URIs containing\n\
    \   different textual representations of IPv6 addresses that all\n   correspond\
    \ to the same binary equivalent.\n      Note that the same ambiguity occurs for\
    \ IPv4 addresses, i.e., is\n      192.0.2.128 = 192.00.02.128?  However, IPv6,\
    \ with its compressed\n      notation and the need to represent hybrid addresses\
    \ (like IPv4-\n      mapped IPv6 addresses) makes the representation issue more\
    \ acute.\n      The resolution discussed in Section 4.2 applies to textual\n \
    \     representations of both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Resolution for Extra Colon in IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address\n   The resolution\
    \ to this ambiguity is simply to use the correct ABNF\n   for the <IPv6address>\
    \ production rule from Appendix A of RFC 3986\n   [3].  For the sake of completeness,\
    \ it is reproduced below:\n     IPv6address   =                             6(\
    \ h16 \":\" ) ls32\n                    /                       \"::\" 5( h16\

    \         / [ *6( h16 \":\" ) h16 ] \"::\"\n     h16           = 1*4HEXDIG\n \
    \    ls32          = ( h16 \":\" h16 ) / IPv4address\n     IPv4address   = dec-octet\
    \ \".\" dec-octet \".\" dec-octet \".\" dec-octet\n     dec-octet     = DIGIT\
    \                 ; 0-9\n                    / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99\n\
    \                    / \"1\" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199\n                   \

    \        ; 250-255\n   Accordingly, this document updates RFC 3261 as follows:\
    \  the\n   <IPv6address> and <IPv4address> production rules from RFC 3261 MUST\n\
    \   NOT be used and instead, the production rules of the same name in RFC\n  \
    \ 3986 (and reproduced above) MUST be used.  This will render\n   <hexpart>, <hexseq>,\
    \ and <hex4> production rules in RFC 3261\n   obsolete; as such, these three production\
    \ rules -- namely, <hexpart>,\n   <hexseq>, and <hex4> -- from RFC 3261 MUST NOT\
    \ be used.\n   The use of the <IPv4address> production rule from RFC 3986 no longer\n\
    \   allows syntactically valid -- though semantically invalid -- SIP URIs\n  \
    \ of the form \"sip:bob@444.555.666.777\".\n"
- title: 4.2.  Clarification for Comparison of URIs with Textual Representation
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Clarification for Comparison of URIs with Textual Representation\n    \
    \  of IP Addresses\n   The resolution to this ambiguity is a simple clarification\n\
    \   acknowledging that the textual representation of an IP address\n   varies,\
    \ but it is the binary equivalence of the IP address that must\n   be taken into\
    \ consideration when comparing two URIs that contain\n   varying textual representations\
    \ of an IP address.\n   Accordingly, the existing rule from the bulleted list\
    \ in Section\n   19.1.4 of RFC 3261 MUST be modified as follows:\n   OLD:\n  \
    \ o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port\n      components\
    \ must match.\n   NEW:\n   o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host,\
    \ and port\n      components must match.  If the host component contains a textual\n\
    \      representation of IP addresses, then the representation of those\n    \
    \  IP addresses may vary.  If so, the host components are considered\n      to\
    \ match if the different textual representations yield the same\n      binary\
    \ IP address.\n   In addition, the text in the following paragraph MUST be added\
    \ to the\n   existing list of examples in Section 19.1.4 of RFC 3261 in order\
    \ to\n   demonstrate the intent of the modified rule:\n   The following URIs are\
    \ equivalent because the underlying binary\n   representation of the IP addresses\
    \ are the same although their\n   textual representations vary:\n      sip:bob@[::ffff:192.0.2.128]\n\
    \      sip:bob@[::ffff:c000:280]\n      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:1]\n      sip:bob@[2001:db8::9:01]\n\
