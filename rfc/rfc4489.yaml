  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an extension to the multicast portion
    of the\n   IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291].  The current architecture\n
    \  does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address allocation.\n   The
    extension allows for use of IIDs to allocate multicast addresses.\n   When a link-local
    unicast address is configured at each interface of\n   a node, an IID is uniquely
    determined.  After that, each node can\n   generate its unique multicast addresses
    automatically without\n   conflicts.  That is, these addresses could safely be
    configured at\n   any time after Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) has completed.\n
    \  This method for the link-local scope is preferred over unicast-\n   prefix-based
    IPv6 multicast addresses [RFC3306], since by delegating\n   multicast addresses
    using the IID, each node can generate its\n   multicast addresses automatically
    without allocation servers.  This\n   method works better than the unicast-prefix-based
    method with\n   applications in serverless environments such as ad-hoc and network\n
    \  mobility.  This document restricts the usage of defined fields such\n   as
    the scop, plen, and network prefix fields of [RFC3306].\n   Therefore, this document
    specifies encoded information for link-local\n   scope in multicast addresses.\n
    \  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n
    \  \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n
    \  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Applicability\n   The allocation technique in this document is designed to
    be used in\n   any environment in which link-local scope IPv6 multicast addresses\n
    \  are assigned or selected.  This method goes especially well with\n   nodes
    supplying multicast services in a zeroconf/serverless\n   environment.  For example,
    multicast addresses less than or equal to\n   link-local scope are themselves
    generated by nodes supplying\n   multicast services without conflicts.  Also,
    hosts that are supplied\n   multicast services from multicast servers then make
    multicast\n   addresses of multicast servers using ND (address resolution) and\n
    \  well-known group IDs [RFC2461].\n   Consequently, this technique MUST only
    be used for link scoped\n   multicast addresses.  If you want to use multicast
    addresses greater\n   than link-local scope, you need to use other methods as
    described in\n   [RFC3306].\n"
  title: 2.  Applicability
- contents:
  - "3.  Link-Scoped Multicast Address Format\n   This document specifies a new format
    that incorporates IID in the\n   link-local scope multicast addresses.\n   Figure
    1 illustrates the new format for link-scoped multicast\n   addresses.\n      |
    \  8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |\n      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\n
    \     |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  |       IID      | group ID |\n      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+\n
    \          Figure 1.  Link-Scoped Multicast IPv6 Address Format\n   The flgs,
    scop, and plen fields are used to identify whether an\n   address is a multicast
    address, as follows:\n    1. flgs MUST be \"0011\".\n    2. scop MUST be <= 2.\n
    \   3. The reserved field MUST be zero.\n    4. The \"plen\" field is a special
    value, \"1111 1111\" (decimal 255).\n   The IID field (replacing the 64-bit prefix
    field from [RFC3306]) is\n   used to distinguish each node from others.  Given
    the use of this\n   method for link-local scope, the IID embedded in the multicast\n
    \  address MUST only come from the IID of the link-local unicast address\n   on
    the interface after DAD has completed.  That is, the creation of\n   the multicast
    address MUST only occur after DAD has completed as part\n   of the auto-configuration
    process.\n   Group ID is generated to indicate a multicast application and is
    used\n   to guarantee its uniqueness only in the host.  It may also be set on\n
    \  the basis of the guidelines outlined in [RFC3307].\n"
  title: 3.  Link-Scoped Multicast Address Format
- contents:
  - "4.  Example\n   In an Ethernet environment, if the link-local unicast address
    is\n   FE80::A12:34FF:FE56:7890, the link-scoped multicast prefix of the\n   node
    is FF32:00FF:A12:34FF:FE56:7890::/96.\n"
  title: 4.  Example
- contents:
  - "5.  Consideration of Lifetime\n   Generally, link-scoped multicast addresses
    have no lifetime, because\n   link-local unicast addresses also have no lifetime.
    \ However, this is\n   not true in the mobile environment.  Even though multicast
    addresses\n   are created from the unique IIDs of unicast addresses, their useful\n
    \  lifetime is linked to the period during which the IID is known to be\n   unique.
    \ Thus, conflict is possible between IIDs, due to a new node\n   in merged network
    that uses the same IID as a powered node.\n   In this scenario, DAD also fails
    to guarantee uniqueness of the\n   unicast address, but this document does not
    try to address this\n   issue.\n"
  title: 5.  Consideration of Lifetime
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The uniqueness of multicast addresses using this
    method is guaranteed\n   by the DAD process.  So, a secure DAD process is needed
    for stability\n   of this method.  This document proposes the mechanism in [RFC3041]\n
    \  for this purpose.\n   [RFC3041] describes the privacy extension to IPv6 stateless
    address\n   autoconfiguration to configure the IID of non-link-local scope\n   unicast
    addresses.  [RFC3041] cannot be used for making a link-local\n   unicast address,
    and hence it cannot be used to create an IID for\n   link-scoped multicast address.
    \ However, as [RFC3041] does not\n   protect the privacy of link-local unicast
    addresses, it does not seem\n   to be required to protect the privacy of IID-based
    link-local\n   multicast addresses.\n"
