Abstract The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
(LSP) Ping and traceroute mechanisms are commonly used to detect and isolate data plane failures in all MPLS LSPs, including LSPs used for each direction of an MPLS Pseudowire (PW).
However, the LSP Ping and traceroute elements used for PWs are not specified for IPv6 address usage.
This document extends the PW LSP Ping and traceroute mechanisms so they can be used with PWs that are set up and maintained using IPv6 LDP sessions.
This document updates RFC 4379.
Introduction Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
(LSP) Ping and traceroute are defined in [RFC4379].
These mechanisms can be used to detect data plane failures in all MPLS LSPs, including Pseudowires (PWs).
However, the PW LSP Ping and traceroute elements are not specified for IPv6 address usage.
Specifically, the PW Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) sub TLVs for the Target
FEC Stack in the LSP Ping and traceroute mechanism are defined only for IPv4 Provider Edge (PE) routers and are not applicable for the case where PEs use IPv6 addresses.
Three PW  related Target FEC sub TLVs are currently defined (FEC 128 Pseudowire Deprecated, FEC 128 Pseudowire Current, and FEC 129 Pseudowire, see Sections 3.2.8 through 3.2.10 of [RFC4379]).
These sub TLVs contain the source and destination addresses of the LDP session, and currently only an IPv4 LDP session is covered.
Despite the fact that the PE IP address family is not explicit in the sub TLV definition, this can be inferred indirectly by examining the lengths of the Sender's/Remote PE Address fields or calculating the length of the sub TLVs (see Section 3.2 of [RFC4379]).
When an IPv6 LDP session is used, these existing sub TLVs cannot be used since the addresses will not fit.
Additionally, all other sub TLVs are defined in pairs, one for IPv4 and another for IPv6, but
not the PW sub TLVs.
This document updates [RFC4379] to explicitly constrain the existing PW FEC sub TLVs for IPv4 LDP sessions and extends the PW LSP Ping to IPv6 LDP sessions (i.e., when IPv6 LDP sessions are used to signal the PW
, the Sender's and Receiver's IP addresses are IPv6 addresses).
This is done by renaming the existing PW sub TLVs to indicate "IPv4" and also by defining two new Target FEC
sub TLVs (FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv6 sub TLV and FEC 129 Pseudowire IPv6 sub TLV) to extend the application of PW LSP Ping and traceroute to IPv6 usage when an IPv6 LDP session [MPLS LDP] is used to signal the Pseudowire.
Note that FEC 128 Pseudowire (Deprecated) is not defined for IPv6 in this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Pseudowire IPv4 Target FEC Stack Sub TLVs
This document updates Section 3.2 and Sections 3.2.8 through 3.2.10 of [RFC4379] as follows and as indicated in Sections 4 and 6.
This is done to avoid any potential ambiguity and confusion and to clarify that these TLVs carry only IPv4 addresses.
Note that the changes are limited to the names of fields
; there are no semantic changes.
Sections 3.2.8 through 3.2.10 of [RFC4379] list the PW sub TLVs and state: "FEC 128" Pseudowire (Deprecated)
"FEC 128" Pseudowire "FEC 129" Pseudowire
These names and titles are now changed to: "FEC 128" Pseudowire IPv4 (Deprecated) "
FEC 128" Pseudowire IPv4 "FEC 129" Pseudowire IPv4 Additionally, when referring to the PE addresses, Sections 3.2.8 through 3.2.10 of [RFC4379] state: Sender's PE Address Remote PE Address
These are now updated to say:
Sender's PE IPv4 Address Remote PE IPv4 Address 3.
Pseudowire IPv6 Target FEC Stack Sub TLVs 3.1.
The FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv6 sub TLV has a structure consistent with the FEC 128 Pseudowire sub TLV as described in Section 3.2.9 of [RFC4379].
The encoding of the FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv6 sub TLV is as follows:
FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv6 FEC 128 PW
Length: Defines the length in octets of the value field of the sub  TLV and its value is 38. 2 octets.
The source IP address of the target IPv6 LDP session.
The destination IP address of the target IPv6 LDP session.
Same as FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv4 [RFC4379].
Same as FEC 128 Pseudowire IPv4 [RFC4379].
The FEC 129 Pseudowire IPv6 sub TLV has a structure consistent with the FEC 129 Pseudowire sub TLV as described in Section 3.2.10 of [RFC4379].
The encoding of FEC 129 Pseudowire IPv6 is as follows:
FEC 129 Pseudowire IPv6 FEC 129 PW IPv6 Type: 25.
Length: Defines the length in octets of the value field of the sub
The length of this TLV is 40   AGI
length   TAII (Target Attachment Individual Identifier) length.
Padding is used to make the total length a multiple of 4; the length of the padding is not included in the Length field.
The source IP address of the target IPv6 LDP session.
The destination IP address of the target IPv6 LDP session.
The other fields are the same as FEC 129 Pseudowire IPv4 [RFC4379].
Summary of Changes Section 3.2 of [RFC4379] tabulates all the sub TLVs for the Target FEC Stack.
"FEC 128" Pseudowire IPv4 (Deprecated)
"FEC 129" Pseudowire IPv6 5.
This document does not define any new procedures.
The process described in [RFC4379] MUST be used.
IANA Considerations IANA has made the following assignments in the "Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
The following sub TLV changes, which comprise three updates and two additions, are made for the TLV Type 1 "Target FEC Stack" in the "TLVs and sub TLVs" sub registry.
This document does not introduce any new security issues; the security mechanisms defined in [RFC4379] apply here.
