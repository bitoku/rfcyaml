  - "Abstract\n   The Diameter base protocol specifies mechanisms whereby a given\
    \ realm\n   may advertise Diameter nodes and the supported transport protocol.\n\
    \   However, these mechanisms do not reveal the Diameter applications\n   that\
    \ each node supports.  A peer outside the realm would have to\n   perform a Diameter\
    \ capability exchange with every node until it\n   discovers one that supports\
    \ the required application.  This document\n   updates RFC 3588, \"Diameter Base\
    \ Protocol\", and describes an\n   improvement using an extended format for the\
    \ Straightforward-Naming\n   Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) application service tag\
    \ that allows for\n   discovery of the supported applications without doing Diameter\n\
    \   capability exchange beforehand.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Diameter base protocol [RFC3588] specifies three mechanisms\
    \ for\n   Diameter peer discovery.  One of these involves the Diameter\n   implementation\
    \ performing a Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) query\n   [RFC3403] for a server\
    \ in a particular realm.  These NAPTR records\n   provide a mapping from a domain\
    \ to the DNS Service Locator (SRV)\n   record [RFC2782] or A/AAAA record [RFC1035]\
    \ [RFC3596] for contacting\n   a server with the specific transport protocol in\
    \ the NAPTR services\n   field.\n   The extended NAPTR usage for Diameter peer\
    \ discovery defined by this\n   document is based on the Straightforward-NAPTR\
    \ (S-NAPTR) Dynamic\n   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) application defined\
    \ in [RFC3958].\n   This document updates the Diameter peer discovery procedure\
    \ described\n   in Section 5.2 of [RFC3588] and defines S-NAPTR application service\n\
    \   and application protocol tag values that permit the discovery of\n   Diameter\
    \ peers that support a specific Diameter application and\n   transport protocol.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The Diameter base protocol specification (Section 1.3 of\
    \ [RFC3588])\n   and the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS application (Section\
    \ 2.1\n   of [RFC3958]) define the terminology used in this document.\n"

    \ and must start with an alphabetic character.\n       ; The service-parms are\
    \ considered case-insensitive.\n   This specification refines the \"iana-registered-service\"\
    \ tag\n   definition for the discovery of Diameter agents supporting a specific\n\
    \   Diameter application as defined below.\n       iana-registered-service =/\
    \ aaa-service\n       aaa-service             = \"aaa+ap\" appln-id\n       appln-id\

    \                                 ; zeros.\n   The appln-id element is the Application\
    \ Identifier used to identify a\n   specific Diameter application.  The Diameter\
    \ Application Identifier\n   is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and values are allocated\
    \ by IANA as\n   defined in [RFC3588].\n   This specification also refines the\
    \ \"iana-registered-protocol\" tag\n   definition for the discovery of Diameter\

    \ this specification\n   MUST NOT be parsed in any way by the querying application\
    \ or\n   resolver.  The delimiter (\".\") is present in the tag to improve\n \
    \  readability and does not imply a structure or namespace of any kind.\n   The\
    \ choice of delimiter (\".\") for the application protocol tag\n   follows the\
    \ format of existing S-NAPTR application protocol tag\n   registry entries, but\
    \ this does not imply that it shares semantics\n   with any other specifications\
    \ that create registry entries with the\n   same format.\n   The S-NAPTR application\
    \ service and application protocol tags defined\n   by this specification are\
    \ unrelated to the IANA \"Service Name and\n   Transport Protocol Port Number\
    \ Registry\" (see [RFC6335]).\n   The maximum length of the NAPTR service field\
    \ is 256 octets,\n   including a one-octet length field (see Section 4.1 of [RFC3403]\
    \ and\n   Section 3.3 of [RFC1035]).\n"
- title: 3.1.  IETF Standards Track Diameter Applications
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IETF Standards Track Diameter Applications\n   A Diameter agent MUST be\
    \ capable of using the extended S-NAPTR\n   application service tag for dynamic\
    \ discovery of a Diameter agent\n   supporting Standards Track applications. \
    \ Therefore, every IETF\n   Standards Track Diameter application MUST be associated\
    \ with a\n   \"aaa-service\" tag formatted as defined in this specification and\n\
    \   allocated in accordance with IANA policy (see Section 7).\n   For example,\
    \ a NAPTR service field value of:\n      'aaa+ap6:diameter.sctp'\n   means that\
    \ the Diameter node in the SRV or A/AAAA record supports the\n   Diameter Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) application ('6') and the\n   Stream Control Transmission\
    \ Protocol (SCTP) as the transport\n   protocol.\n"

    \ tag\n   formatted as defined in this specification and allocated in\n   accordance\
    \ with IANA policy (see Section 7).\n   For example, a NAPTR service field value\
    \ of:\n      'aaa+ap16777251:diameter.sctp'\n   means that the Diameter node in\
    \ the SRV or A/AAAA record supports the\n   Diameter Third Generation Partnership\
    \ Project (3GPP) S6a application\n   ('16777251') and SCTP as the transport protocol.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Backwards Compatibility\n   Domain Name System (DNS) administrators SHOULD\

    \ to guarantee\n   backwards compatibility with legacy Diameter peers that are\
    \ RFC 3588\n   compliant.  If the DNS administrator provisions both extended S-NAPTR\n\
    \   records as defined in this specification and legacy RFC 3588 NAPTR\n   records,\
    \ then the extended S-NAPTR records MUST have higher priority\n   (e.g., lower\
    \ order and/or preference values) than legacy NAPTR\n   records.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Extended NAPTR-Based Diameter Peer Discovery\n   The Diameter Peer Discovery\
    \ principles are described in Section 5.2\n   of [RFC3588].  This specification\
    \ updates the NAPTR query procedure\n   in the Diameter peer discovery mechanism\
    \ by allowing the querying\n   node to determine which applications are supported\
    \ by resolved\n   Diameter peers.\n   The extended-format NAPTR records provide\
    \ a mapping from a domain to\n   the SRV record or A/AAAA record for contacting\
    \ a server supporting a\n   specific transport protocol and Diameter application.\
    \  The resource\n   record will contain an empty regular expression and a replacement\n\
    \   value, which is the SRV record or the A/AAAA record for that\n   particular\
    \ transport protocol.\n   The assumption for this mechanism to work is that the\
    \ DNS\n   administrator of the queried domain has first provisioned the DNS\n\
    \   with extended-format NAPTR entries.  The steps below replace the\n   NAPTR\
    \ query procedure steps in Section 5.2 of [RFC3588].\n   a. The Diameter implementation\

    \ implementation has to know in\n      advance in which realm to look for a Diameter\
    \ agent, and in which\n      Application Identifier it is interested.  For example,\
    \ the realm\n      could be deduced from the Network Access Identifier (NAI) in\
    \ the\n      User-Name attribute-value pair (AVP) or extracted from the\n    \
    \  Destination-Realm AVP.\n   b. If the returned NAPTR service fields contain\
    \ entries formatted as\n      \"aaa+apX:Y\" where \"X\" indicates the Application\

    \ target realm\n      supports the extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter peer\n\
    \      discovery defined in this document.\n         If \"X\" contains the required\
    \ Application Identifier and \"Y\"\n         matches a supported transport protocol,\
    \ the Diameter\n         implementation resolves the \"replacement\" field entry\
    \ to a\n         target host using the lookup method appropriate for the \"flags\"\
    \n         field.\n         If \"X\" does not contain the required Application\
    \ Identifier or\n         \"Y\" does not match a supported transport protocol,\
    \ the Diameter\n         implementation abandons the peer discovery.\n   c. If\
    \ the returned NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as\n      \"aaa+apX\"\
    \ where \"X\" indicates the Application Identifier, the\n      target realm supports\
    \ the extended format for NAPTR-based Diameter\n      peer discovery defined in\

    \         to a target host using the lookup method appropriate for the\n     \
    \    \"flags\" field and attempts to connect using all supported\n         transport\
    \ protocols following the order specified in\n         Section 2.1 of [RFC3588].\n\
    \         If \"X\" does not contain the required Application Identifier,\n   \
    \      the Diameter implementation abandons the peer discovery.\n   d. If the\

    \ where \"X\" indicates the supported transport protocol(s),\n      the target\
    \ realm supports Diameter but does not support the\n      extended format for\
    \ NAPTR-based Diameter peer discovery defined in\n      this document.\n     \
    \    If \"X\" matches a supported transport protocol, the Diameter\n         implementation\
    \ resolves the \"replacement\" field entry to a\n         target host using the\
    \ lookup method appropriate for the \"flags\"\n         field.\n   e. If the returned\
    \ NAPTR service fields contain entries formatted as\n      \"aaa\", the target\
    \ realm supports Diameter but does not support the\n      extended format for\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies an enhancement to the\
    \ NAPTR service field\n   format defined in RFC 3588 and also modifications to\
    \ the NAPTR\n   processing logic defined in RFC 3588.  The enhancement and\n \
    \  modifications are based on the S-NAPTR, which is actually a\n   simplification\
    \ of the NAPTR, and therefore the same security\n   considerations described in\
    \ RFC 3588 [RFC3588] are applicable to this\n   document.  No further extensions\
    \ are required beyond the security\n   mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.  However,\
    \ a malicious host doing\n   S-NAPTR queries learns applications supported by\
    \ Diameter agents in a\n   certain realm faster, which might help the malicious\
    \ host to scan\n   potential targets for an attack more efficiently when some\n\
    \   applications have known vulnerabilities.\n"
