  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System Numbers\n\
    \   (ASNs) that are for Private Use only, known as Private Use ASNs, and\n   provides\
    \ operational guidance on their use.  This document enlarges\n   the total space\
    \ available for Private Use ASNs by documenting the\n   reservation of a second,\
    \ larger range and updates RFC 1930 by\n   replacing Section 10 of that document.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original IANA reservation of Autonomous System Numbers\
    \ (ASNs) for\n   Private Use was a block of 1023 ASNs.  This was also documented\
    \ by\n   the IETF in Section 10 of [RFC1930].  Since the time that the range\n\
    \   was reserved, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] has seen\n   deployment\
    \ in new application domains, such as data center networks,\n   which require\
    \ a larger Private Use AS space.\n   Since the introduction of \"BGP Support for\
    \ Four-Octet Autonomous\n   System (AS) Number Space\" [RFC6793], the total size\
    \ of ASN space has\n   increased dramatically.  A larger subset of the space is\
    \ available to\n   network operators to deploy in these Private Use cases.  The\
    \ existing\n   range of Private Use ASNs is widely deployed, and the ability to\n\
    \   renumber this resource in existing networks cannot be coordinated\n   given\
    \ that these ASNs, by definition, are not registered.  Therefore,\n   this RFC\
    \ documents the existing Private Use ASN reservation while\n   also introducing\
    \ a second, larger range that can also be utilized.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Private Use ASNs
  contents:
  - "3.  Private Use ASNs\n   To allow the continued growth of BGP protocol usage\
    \ in new network\n   applications that utilize Private Use ASNs, two ranges of\
    \ ASNs are\n   reserved by Section 5 of this document.  The first is part of the\n\
    \   original 16-bit Autonomous System range previously defined in\n   [RFC1930],\
    \ and the second is a larger range out of the Four-Octet AS\n   Number Space [RFC6793].\n"
- title: 4.  Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Operational Considerations\n   If Private Use ASNs are used and prefixes\
    \ originate from these ASNs,\n   Private Use ASNs MUST be removed from AS path\
    \ attributes (including\n   AS4_PATH if utilizing a four-octet AS number space)\
    \ before being\n   advertised to the global Internet.  Operators SHOULD ensure\
    \ that all\n   External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) speakers support the\n\
    \   extensions described in [RFC6793] and that implementation-specific\n   features\
    \ that recognize Private Use ASNs have been updated to\n   recognize both ranges\
    \ prior to making use of the newer, numerically\n   higher range of Private Use\
    \ ASNs in the four-octet AS number space.\n   Some existing implementations that\
    \ remove Private Use ASNs from the\n   AS_PATH are known to not remove Private\
    \ Use ASNs if the AS_PATH\n   contains a mixture of Private Use and Non-Private\
    \ Use ASNs.  If such\n   implementations have not been updated to recognize the\
    \ new range of\n   ASNs in this document and a mix of old and new range Private\
    \ Use ASNs\n   exist in the AS4_PATH, these implementations will likely cease\
    \ to\n   remove any Private Use ASNs from either of the AS path attributes.\n\
    \   Normal AS path filtering MAY also be used to prevent prefixes\n   originating\
    \ from Private Use ASNs from being advertised to the global\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has reserved, for Private Use, a contiguous\
    \ block of 1023\n   Autonomous System numbers from the \"16-bit Autonomous System\
    \ Numbers\"\n   registry, namely 64512 - 65534 inclusive.\n   IANA has also reserved,\
    \ for Private Use, a contiguous block of\n   94,967,295 Autonomous System numbers\
    \ from the \"32-bit Autonomous\n   System Numbers\" registry, namely 4200000000\
    \ - 4294967294 inclusive.\n   These reservations have been documented in the IANA\
    \ \"Autonomous\n   System (AS) Numbers\" registry [IANA.AS].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Private Use ASNs do not raise any unique security\
    \ concerns.  Loss of\n   connectivity might result from their inappropriate use,\
    \ specifically\n   outside of a single organization, since they are not globally\
    \ unique.\n   This loss of connectivity is limited to the organization using\n\
    \   Private Use ASNs inappropriately or without reference to Section 4.\n   General\
    \ BGP security considerations are discussed in [RFC4271] and\n   [RFC4272].  Identification\
    \ of the originator of a route with a\n   Private Use ASN in the AS path would\
    \ have to be done by tracking the\n   route back to the neighboring globally unique\
    \ AS in the path or by\n   inspecting other attributes.\n"
