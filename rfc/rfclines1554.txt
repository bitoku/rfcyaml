Introduction This memo describes a text encoding scheme: "ISO 2022 JP 2", which is used experimentally for electronic mail [RFC822] and network news [RFC1036] messages in several Japanese networks.
The encoding is a multilingual extension of "ISO 2022 JP", the existing encoding for Japanese [2022JP].
The encoding is supported by an Emacs based multilingual text editor: MULE [MULE].
The name, "ISO 2022 JP 2", is intended to be used in the "charset" parameter field of MIME headers (see [MIME1] and [MIME2]).
The text with "ISO 2022 JP 2" starts in ASCII [ASCII], and switches to other character sets of ISO 2022
[ISO2022] through limited combinations of escape sequences.
All the characters are encoded with 7 bits only.
At the beginning of text, the existence of an announcer sequence: "ESC 2/0 4/1 ESC 2/0 4/6 ESC 2/0 5/10" is (though omitted) assumed.
Thus, characters of 94 character sets are designated to G0 and invoked as GL.
C1 control characters are represented with 7 bits.
Characters of 96 character sets are designated to G2 and invoked with SS2 (single shift two, "ESC 4/14" or "ESC N").
The escape sequence "ESC 2/14 4/1" or "ESC .
A" indicates that ISO 8859 1 is designated to G2.
After the designation, the single shifted sequence "ESC 4/14 4/1" or "ESC N A" is interpreted to represent a character "A with acute".
The following table gives the escape sequences and the character sets used in "ISO 2022 JP 2" messages.
The reg# is the registration number in ISO's registry [ISOREG].
ESC ( B    G0 42
JIS X 0208 1978    ESC 2/4 4/0
ESC $ B    G0 14
ESC $ A    G0 149
( D  G0 96 character sets reg
For further information about the character sets and the escape sequences, see [ISO2022] and [ISOREG].
If there is any G0 designation in text, there must be a switch to ASCII or to JIS X 0201 Roman before a space character (but not necessarily before "ESC 4/14 2/0" or "ESC N ' '
") or control characters such as tab or CRLF.
This means that the next line starts in the character set that was switched to before the end of the previous line.
Though the designation to JIS X 0201 Roman is allowed for backward compatibility to "ISO 2022 JP", its use is discouraged.
Applications such as pagers and editors which randomly seek within a text file encoded with "ISO 2022 JP 2" may assume that all the lines begin with ASCII, not with JIS X 0201 Roman.
At the beginning of a line, information on G2 designation of the previous line is cleared.
New designation must be given before a character in 96 character sets is used in the line.
The text must end in ASCII designated to G0.
As the "ISO 2022 JP", and thus, "ISO 2022 JP 2", is designed to represent English and modern Japanese, left to right directionality is assumed if the text is displayed horizontally.
Users of "ISO 2022 JP 2" must be aware that some common transport such as old Bnews can not relay a 7 bit value 7/15 (decimal 127), which is used to encode, say, "
y with diaeresis" of ISO 8859 1.
Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax section below.
The notational conventions used here are identical to those used in STD 11, RFC 822 [RFC822].
The   (asterisk) convention is as follows:
l m something meaning at least l and at most m somethings, with l and m taking default values of 0 and infinity, respectively.
single byte seq  (single byte char / g2 desig seq / single shift char )
double byte seq  ((one of 94 one of 94) / g2 desig seq / single shift char )
; ( 0 177,  0.
The name given to the character encoding is "ISO 2022 JP 2".
This name is intended to be used in MIME messages as follows:
Content Type: text/plain; charset iso 2022 jp 2
The "ISO 2022 JP 2" encoding is already in 7 bit form, so it is not necessary to use a Content Transfer Encoding header.
It should be noted that applying the Base64 or Quoted Printable encoding will render the message unreadable in non MIME compliant software.
ISO 2022 JP 2" may also be used in MIME headers.
Both "B" and "Q" encoding could be useful with "ISO 2022 JP 2" text.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
