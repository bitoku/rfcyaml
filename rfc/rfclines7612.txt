Schema for Printer Services Abstract
This document defines a schema, object classes, and attributes, for Printers and print services, for use with directories that support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).
This document is based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" (RFC 2911).
Additional Printer attributes are based on definitions in "Printer MIB v2" (RFC 3805), "PWG Command Set Format for IEEE 1284
, "IPP Job and Printer Extensions Set 3 (JPS3)" (PWG 5100.13), and "IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14).
This memo is an Independent Submission to the RFC Editor by the Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) Working Group of the IEEE ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG), as part of their PWG "IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14) project for secure mobile printing with vendor neutral Client software.
This document obsoletes RFC 3712.
This document defines several object classes to provide Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[RFC4510] applications with flexible options in defining Printer information using an LDAP schema.
Classes are provided for defining directory entries with common Printer information as well as for extending existing directory entries with Service Location Protocol Version 2
[RFC2608], Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP/1.1)
This memo is an Independent Submission to the RFC Editor by the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE ISTO Printer Working Group, as part of their Printer Working Group (PWG)
"IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14) project for secure mobile printing with vendor neutral Client software.
Relationship to SLP Printer Service
The schema defined in this document is technically aligned with the stable IANA registered 'service:
printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20], for compatibility with already deployed SLPv2 [RFC2608] service advertising and discovery infrastructure.
The attribute syntaxes are technically aligned with the 'service:printer:' v2.0 template; therefore, simpler types are sometimes used (for example, 'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] rather than 'labeledURI' [RFC2079] for the 'printer uri' attribute).
Source of LDAP Printer Attributes
The schema defined in this document is based on:  all of the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E ("Generic Directory Schema") of "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" [RFC2911] that are defined in Section 4.4 ("Printer Description Attributes") of [RFC2911]  selected Printer attributes defined in "Printer MIB v2" [RFC3805], "PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284
, "IPP Job and Printer Extensions Set 3 (JPS3)" [PWG5100.13], and "IPP Everywhere" [PWG5100.14]
See the table of Printer attributes and source documents in Section 4 ("Definition of Attribute Types") of this document.
Source of LDAP Printer Schema OIDs 1.3.1.
IBM Assignments for RFC 3712
In March 2000, IBM permanently assigned ASN.1 OIDs to all of the object classes and attribute types that were defined in the original LDAP Printer Schema [RFC3712] (see Section 7.2).
In October 2011, IBM permanently delegated the base ASN.1 OID "1.3.18.0.2.24.46" to the IEEE ISTO PWG for use in any PWG project.
In October 2011, the IEEE ISTO PWG permanently assigned subordinate ASN.1 OIDs for all of the new attribute types defined in this updated LDAP Printer Schema (see Section 7.1).
Rationale for Using DirectoryString Syntax
(UTF 8 [STD63]) defined in [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in this document: 1) URI printer uri, printer xri supported, printer more info, printer charge info uri, printer uuid
The UTF 8 encoding is compatible with deployment of (UTF 8 based) Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
2) Description printer name, printer location, printer info, printer make and model The UTF 8 encoding supports descriptions in any language, conformant with the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages [BCP18].
Note: The printer natural language configured attribute contains a language tag [BCP47] for these description attributes (for example, to support text to speech conversions).
Keyword printer compression supported, printer finishings supported, printer media supported, printer media local supported, printer print quality supported The UTF 8 encoding is compatible with the current IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] definition of the equivalent attributes, most of which have the IPP/1.1 union syntax 'keyword' or 'name'.
The keyword attributes defined in this document are extensible by site  specific or vendor specific 'names' that behave like new 'keywords'.
In IPP/1.1, each value is strongly typed over the wire as either 'keyword' or 'name'.
This union selector is not preserved in the definitions of these equivalent LDAP attributes.
The EQUALITY matching rule 'caseIgnoreMatch' defined in [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in this document:
These URI attributes specify EQUALITY matching with 'caseIgnoreMatch' (rather than with 'caseExactMatch') in order to conform to the spirit of [STD66], which requires case insensitive matching on the host part of a URI versus case sensitive matching on the remainder of a URI.
These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case insensitive equality matching for host names in the associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].
Either equality matching rule choice would be a compromise:
a) case sensitive whole URI matching can lead to false negative matches and has been shown to be fragile (given deployed client applications that 'pretty up' host names displayed and transferred in URI)
; b) case insensitive whole URI matching can lead to false positive matches, although it is a dangerous practice to publish URI that differ only by case (for example, in the path elements).
Description Case insensitive equality matching is more user friendly for description attributes.
Keyword Case insensitive equality matching is more user friendly for keyword attributes.
Device ID Case insensitive equality matching is mandatory for IEEE 1284 Device ID attributes.
The SUBSTR matching rule 'caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch' defined in [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in this document:
These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case insensitive equality matching for host names in the associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].
2) Description Support for case insensitive substring matching is more user friendly for description attributes.
Keyword Support for case insensitive substring matching is more user friendly for keyword attributes.
IEEE 1284 Device ID Support for case insensitive substring matching is mandatory for IEEE 1284 Device ID attributes.

We define the following LDAP object classes for use with both generic Printer related information and services specific to SLPv2
IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179].
slpServicePrinter auxiliary class for SLP registered Printers printerAbstract abstract class for all Printer classes printerService structural class for Printers printerServiceAuxClass auxiliary class for Printers
printerIPP auxiliary class for IPP Printers
printerLPR auxiliary class for LPR Printers
The following are some examples of how applications could choose to use these classes when creating directory entries: 1) Use printerService for directory entries containing common Printer information.
2) Use both printerService and slpServicePrinter for directory entries containing common Printer information for SLP registered Printers.
3) Use printerService, printerLPR, and printerIPP for directory entries containing common Printer information for Printers that support both LPR and IPP.
4) Use printerServiceAuxClass and object classes not defined by this document for directory entries containing common Printer information.
In this example, printerServiceAuxClass is used for extending other structural classes defining Printer information with common Printer information defined in this document.
Refer to Section 4 for the definition of attribute types referenced by these object classes.
We use attribute names instead of OIDs in object class definitions for clarity.
Some attribute names described in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with 'printer ' as recommended in [RFC2926] and [SLPPRT20].
DESC  'Service Location Protocol (SLP) information.'
This auxiliary class defines information specific to the Service Location Protocol (SLPv2)
It MAY be used to create new, or extend existing, directory entries with SLP 'service:printer' abstract service type information as defined in [SLPPRT20].
This object class is derived from 'slpService', the parent class for all SLP services, defined in [RFC2926].
( 1.3.18.0.2.6.258 NAME  'printerAbstract' DESC  'Printer related information.'
( printer name $ printer natural language configured $ printer location $ printer info $ printer more info $ printer make and model $ printer multiple document jobs supported $ printer charset configured $ printer charset supported $ printer generated natural language supported $ printer document format supported $ printer color supported $ printer compression supported $ printer pages per minute $ printer pages per minute color $ printer finishings supported $ printer number up supported $ printer sides supported $ printer media supported $ printer media local supported $ printer resolution supported $ printer print quality supported $ printer job priority supported $ printer copies supported $ printer job k octets supported $ printer current operator $ printer service person $ printer delivery orientation supported $ printer stacking order supported $ printer output features supported $ printer device id $ printer device service count $ printer uuid $ printer charge info $ printer charge info uri $ printer geo location ) )
This abstract class defines Printer information.
It is a base class for deriving other Printer related classes, such as, but not limited to, classes defined in this document.
It defines a common set of Printer attributes that are not specific to any one type of service, protocol, or operating system.
( 1.3.18.0.2.6.255 NAME  'printerService' DESC  'Printer information.'
This structural class defines Printer information.
It is derived from class printerAbstract and thus inherits common Printer attributes.
This class can be used with or without auxiliary classes to define Printer information.
Auxiliary classes can be used to extend the common Printer information with information specific to the protocol, service, or operating system.
Note: When extending other structural classes with auxiliary classes, printerService SHOULD NOT be used.
printerServiceAuxClass ( 1.3.18.0.2.6.257 NAME  '
This auxiliary class defines Printer information.
It is derived from class printerAbstract and thus inherits common Printer attributes.
( 1.3.18.0.2.6.256 NAME  'printerIPP' DESC  'Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) information.'
This auxiliary class defines Internet Printing Protocol (IPP/1.1)
It is used to extend structural classes with IPP specific Printer information.
IPP URL Scheme" [RFC3510] and "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS Transport Binding and the 'ipps' URI Scheme" [RFC7472] for conforming URI for IPP Printers.
printerLPR ( 1.3.18.0.2.6.253 NAME  'printerLPR' DESC  'LPR information.'
MUST  ( printer name )
This auxiliary class defines LPR [RFC1179] information.
It is used to identify directory entries that support LPR.
The following attribute types are referenced by the object classes defined in Section 3.
The following attribute types reference syntax OIDs defined in Section 3 of [RFC4517]
(see Section 5 ("Definition of Syntaxes") below).
The following attribute types reference matching rule names (instead of OIDs) for clarity (see Section 6 below).
For optional attributes, if the Printer information is not known, the attribute value SHOULD NOT be set.
In the following definitions, referenced matching rules are defined in Section 4 of [RFC4517] and discussed in Section 6 ("Definition of Matching Rules") later in this document.
For compatibility with existing implementations of [RFC3712] and underlying string length limits in [RFC2707], [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14], implementations of the attributes defined in this document SHOULD NOT exceed those underlying string length limits (to avoid truncation and false matches).
Note: For interoperability and consistent text display, values of attributes defined in this document (a) SHOULD be normalized as recommended in "Unicode Format for Network Interchange" [RFC5198]; (b) SHOULD NOT contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together (not as singletons); and (d) SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters in names, e.g., printer name and printer aliases.
Note: Some of the following attributes are described as 'List of xxx' (using a comma as the member delimiter).
Some other attributes are described as 'One of xxx' (single valued).
In all cases, any attribute can have multiple values represented as multiple instances, except where explicitly restricted in syntax to be single valued.
These two field delimiters are different for compatibility with the corresponding attributes in the IANA
registered SLP 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20], which was defined before the original LDAP Printer Schema [RFC3712] was written.
The following table is a summary of the attribute names defined by this document and their corresponding source document names as defined in [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], or [PWG5100.13].
Some source attribute names have been prefixed with 'printer ' as recommended in [RFC2926], to address the flat namespace for LDAP identifiers.
RFC2911] printer uri printer xri supported [printer uri supported]
printer geo location printer ipp features supported  ipp features supported 4.1.
( 1.3.18.0.2.4.1140 NAME 'printer uri' DESC 'A URI supported by this Printer.'
If the printer xri supported LDAP attribute is implemented, then this printer uri value MUST be listed in printer xri supported.
See [STD66] for details of URI syntax.
Note: For compatibility with IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], values of this attribute SHOULD NOT exceed 1023 octets in length.
LDAP application clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use malformed URI values read from this attribute.
LDAP administrative clients SHOULD NOT write malformed URI values into this attribute.
IPP URL Scheme" [RFC3510] and "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS Transport Binding and the 'ipps' URI Scheme" [RFC7472] for conforming URI for IPP Printers.
Note: For SLP registered Printers, the LDAP printer uri attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the SLP registered URL of the Printer, for interworking with SLPv2 [RFC2608] service discovery.
See Sections 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3 for rationale for design choices.
printer xri supported ( 1.3.18.0.2.4.1107 NAME 'printer xri supported' DESC 'An XRI (extended resource identifier) supported by this Printer.'
Each value of this attribute MUST consist of a URI (uniform resource identifier) followed by (optional) authentication and security fields.
For example: 'uri ipp://example.com/ipp< auth digest< sec tls<' 'uri ipps://example.com/ipp< auth digest< sec tls<' 'uri lpr://example.com/lpr
< sec none<' 'uri mailto:printer@example.com< auth none
Note: Multiple values for this attribute are represented as multiple instances of this attribute.
See [STD66] for details of URI syntax.
Note: For compatibility with IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], values of this attribute SHOULD NOT exceed 1023 octets in length.
LDAP application clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use malformed URI values read from this attribute.
LDAP administrative clients SHOULD NOT write malformed URI values into this attribute.
Note: This attribute is based on the IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] attributes 'printer uri supported', 'uri authentication supported', and 'uri security supported' (called the 'Three Musketeers' because they are parallel, ordered attributes).
This attribute unfolds those IPP/1.1 attributes and thus avoids the ordering (and same number of values) constraints of the IPP/1.1 separate attributes.
Defined keywords for fields include: 'uri' (IPP 'printer uri supported') 'auth' (IPP 'uri authentication supported') 'sec' (IPP 'uri security supported')
A missing 'auth' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.
, "IPP Job and Printer Extensions Set 3 (JPS3)" [PWG5100.13], and the IANA IPP registry [IANAIPP], defined values of the 'auth' field include: 'none' (no authentication for this URI) 'requesting user name' (from operation request) 'basic' (HTTP/1.1 Basic
[RFC2617] and [RFC7235]) 'digest' (HTTP/1.1 Digest [RFC2617] and [RFC7235]) 'certificate' (X.509 Certificate [RFC5280] and [RFC6818])
The 'certificate' value refers to the IPP Client certificate extracted from the TLS session.
A missing 'sec' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.
[RFC2911] and the IANA IPP registry [IANAIPP], defined values of the 'sec' field include: 'none' (no security for this URI) 'ssl3' (Netscape's Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL3)) 'tls'
The syntax and delimiter for this attribute are aligned with the equivalent attribute in the 'service:
IPP URL Scheme" [RFC3510] and "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS Transport Binding and the 'ipps' URI Scheme" [RFC7472] for conforming URI for IPP Printers.
See Sections 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3 for rationale for design choices.

All text string attributes defined in this document of syntax 'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] have values that are encoded in UTF 8 [STD63], as required by [RFC4517].
A language tag [BCP47] for all of the text string attributes defined in this document is contained in the printer natural language configured attribute.
Therefore, all object classes defined in this document conform to the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
Note: For interoperability and consistent text display, values of attributes defined in this document (a) SHOULD be normalized as recommended in "Unicode Format for Network Interchange" [RFC5198]; (b) SHOULD NOT contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together (not as singletons); and (d) SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters in names, e.g., printer name and printer aliases.
Security Considerations See [RFC4513] for detailed guidance on authentication methods for LDAP and the use of TLS/1.2 [RFC5246] to supply connection confidentiality and data integrity for LDAP sessions.
As with any LDAP schema, it is important to protect specific entries and attributes with the appropriate access control.
It is particularly important that only administrators can modify entries defined in this LDAP Printer schema.
Otherwise, an LDAP client might be fooled into diverting print service requests from the original Printer (or spooler) to a malicious intruder's host system, thus exposing the information in printed documents.
Note: Security vulnerabilities can arise if DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters are included in names, e.g., printer name or printer aliases.
For additional security considerations regarding deploying Printers in an IPP environment, see Section 8 of [RFC2911].
Appendix A.  Changes since RFC 3712 1) Added many editorial corrections and clarifications corrected typos, missing words, and ambiguous sentences; replaced lowercase 'printer' with titlecase 'Printer' for readability and consistency with IETF and IEEE ISTO PWG IPP standards usage; added implementation notes; updated and added references.
2) Deleted length restrictions from formal definitions of DirectoryString syntax attributes replaced with notes recommending length restrictions for compatibility with existing implementations of [RFC3712] and underlying string length limits in [RFC2707], [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14].
3) Added new Printer attributes defined in [PWG5107.2], [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14
] (see Section 7.1) updated the table of Printer attributes and source documents in Section 4 ("Definition of Attribute Types"); added support for IEEE ISTO PWG "IPP Everywhere" [PWG5100.14] project.
4) Added implementation note to Section 4 about string encodings added discussion of 'List of xxx' and 'One of xxx' encodings; stated that any of these attributes can be represented as multiple instances (i.e., to avoid length overflow).
comma delimited examples of string attributes added both single valued and multi valued examples.
Clarified Section 8 ("Internationalization Considerations") added note about Net Unicode [RFC5198] and avoiding use of C0 and C1 control characters.
Clarified Section 9 ("Security Considerations") added note about security vulnerabilities caused by use of DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters in names.
9) Clarified terms and abbreviations renamed Section 2 ("Conventions Used in This Document"); added Section 2.1 ("Requirements Language"); added Section 2.2 ("LDAP Schema Descriptions"); added Section 2.3 ("Abbreviations").
