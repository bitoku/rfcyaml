- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   Border Gateway Protocol v4 (BGP-4) [1] is an inter-Autonomous\
    \ System\n   routing protocol.  It is built on experience gained with BGP as\n\
    \   defined in RFC-1267 [2] and BGP usage in the connected Internet as\n   described\
    \ in RFC-1268 [3].\n   The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange\
    \ network\n   reachability information with other BGP systems.  This network\n\
    \   reachability information includes information on the list of\n   Autonomous\
    \ Systems (ASs) that reachability information traverses.\n   This information\
    \ is sufficient to construct a graph of AS\n   connectivity from which routing\
    \ loops may be pruned and some policy\n   decisions at the AS level may be enforced.\n\
    \   BGP-4 provides a new set of mechanisms for supporting classless\n   inter-domain\
    \ routing.  These mechanisms include support for\n   advertising an IP prefix\
    \ and eliminates the concept of network\n   \"class\" within BGP.  BGP-4 also\
    \ introduces mechanisms which allow\n   aggregation of routes, including aggregation\
    \ of AS paths.  These\n   changes provide support for the proposed supernetting\
    \ scheme [4].\n   The management information base has been defined [5] and security\n\
    \   considerations are discussed in the protocol definition document [1].\n"
- title: Applicability Statement for BGP-4
  contents:
  - "Applicability Statement for BGP-4\n   BGP-4 is explicitly designed for carrying\
    \ reachability information\n   between Autonomous Systems.  BGP-4 is not intended\
    \ to replace\n   interior gateway protocols such as OSPF [7] or RIP [6].\n"
- title: Implementations
  contents:
  - "Implementations\n   Four vendors have developed independent implementations at\
    \ the time\n   of this memo:\n        ANS (gated)\n        Europanet\n       \
    \ 3COM\n        cisco\n   The complete interoperability matrix between all known\n\
    \   implementations of various versions of BGP is available under\n   separate\
    \ cover [9].\n"
- title: Implementation Testing
  contents:
  - "Implementation Testing\n   One implementation has been extensively tested in\
    \ a network designed\n   to mirror the complex connectivity present at many major\
    \ Internet\n   borders.  This network consists of multiple BGP-3 and BGP-4 speakers\n\
    \   carrying full routing information injected from Alternet, EBone,\n   Sprint,\
    \ CERFnet, and cisco.  In many cases additional AS adjacencies\n   are simulated\
    \ via the use of IP over IP tunnels to increase the\n   complexity of the routing\
    \ topology.\n   The primary feature of BGP-4 is the ability to carry network\n\
    \   reachability information without regard to classfull routing.  In\n   addition\
    \ to canonical routing information,  CIDR prefixes (both\n   supernets and subnets)\
    \ are being injected from IGP information and\n   aggregated using the methods\
    \ described in BGP-4.  AS set aggregation\n   and policy decisions based upon\
    \ AS sets have been tested.\n   Secondary extensions incorporated as part of version\
    \ 4 of this\n   protocol include enhancements to use of the INTER_AS_METRIC (now\n\
    \   called MULTI_EXIT_DISC), the addition of a LOCAL_PREF parameter to\n   influence\
    \ route selection within an AS,  and a specified method of\n   damping route fluctuations.\
    \  All of these features have been tested\n   in at least one implementation.\n"
- title: Observations
  contents:
  - "Observations\n   All implementations, are able to carry and exchange network\n\
    \   reachability information.\n   Not all implementations are capable of generating\
    \ aggregate\n   information based upon the existence of more specific routes.\n\
    \   No implementation supports automatic deaggregation (enumeration of\n   all\
    \ networks in an aggregate block for backwards compatibility with\n   routing\
    \ protocols that do not carry mask information (e.g. BGP-3)).\n   However, most\
    \ implementations do allow for staticly configured\n   controlled deaggregation\
    \ for minimal backwards compatibility with\n   non-CIDR capable routers.\n   At\
    \ least one implementation capable of running earlier versions of\n   BGP deliberately\
    \ does not automaticly negotiate to earlier versions.\n   Connections to BGP-4\
    \ peers must be explicitly configured as such.\n"
- title: Conclusions
  contents:
  - "Conclusions\n   The ability to carry and inject natural networks and CIDR supernets\n\
    \   is the immediate requirement for BGP-4.  The ability to carry subnet\n   information\
    \ (useful when reassigning parts of class A networks to\n   organizations with\
    \ different routing policies) is of secondary\n   concern.\n   The ability to\
    \ conditionally aggregate routing information may be\n   worked around by injecting\
    \ static or IGP network information into\n   BGP, or aggregation may be performed\
    \ by an upstream router that is\n   capable.\n   Deaggregation is dangerous. \
    \ It leads to information loss and unless\n   tightly controlled by a manual mechanism,\
    \  will create a routing\n   information explosion.\n   Automatic version negotiation\
    \ is dangerous due to the state-less\n   nature.  Given packet losses or spontaneous\
    \ restarts,  it is possible\n   for two BGP peers capable of BGP-4 to negotiate\
    \ a BGP-3 or BGP-2\n   connection,  which is incapable of carrying super/subnet\
    \ reachability\n   information and AS set information.\n"
