  - "2.  Problem Description\n   [RFC4761] specifies the VPLS BGP NLRI by which a
    given PE advertises\n   the behavior expected by the multiple PEs participating
    in the same\n   VPLS.  The NLRI indicates the VPLS label that the various PE routers,\n
    \  which are referred to in the NLRI, should use when forwarding VPLS\n   traffic
    to this PE.  Additionally, by using the Control Flags, this\n   PE specifies whether
    the other PEs (in the same VPLS) should use the\n   CW or sequenced delivery for
    frames forwarded to this PE.  These are\n   indicated by the C-bits and the S-bits,
    respectively, in the Control\n   Flags, as specified in Section 3.2.4 in [RFC4761].\n
    \  [RFC4761] requires that if the advertising PE sets the C-bits and\n   S-bits,
    the receiving PE MUST, respectively, insert a CW and include\n   sequence numbers
    when forwarding VPLS traffic to the advertising PE.\n   However, in a BGP VPLS
    deployment, there would often be cases where a\n   PE receiving the VPLS BGP NLRI
    may not have the ability to insert a\n   CW or include sequencing information
    inside PW frames.  Thus, the\n   behavior of CW processing and sequencing needs
    to be further\n   specified.\n   This document updates the meaning of the Control
    Flags in the Layer2\n   Info Extended Community in the BGP VPLS NLRI.  It also
    specifies the\n   forwarding behavior for a mixed-mode environment where not every
    PE\n   in a VPLS has the ability or the configuration to honor the Control\n   Flags
    received from the PE advertising the BGP NLRI.\n"

    \  [RFC4761] does not allow for the CW setting to be negotiated.  In a\n   typical
    implementation, if a PE sets the C-bit, it expects to receive\n   VPLS frames
    with a CW and will send frames the same way.  If the PEs\n   at the two ends of
    a PW do not agree on the setting of the C-bit, the\n   PW does not come up.  The
    behavior is similar for the S-bit.\n   This memo updates the meaning of the C-bit

    - "3.2.  Sequence Flag (S-Bit)\n   If a PE sets the S-bit in its NLRI, it means
      that the PE has the\n   ability to set sequence numbers as described in Section
      4.1 in\n   [RFC4385] and process sequence numbers as described in Section 4.2
      in\n   [RFC4385].\n   -  If the PEs at both ends of a PW set the S-bit, non-zero
      sequence\n      numbers MUST be used in both directions of the PW.\n   -  If
      both PEs send an S-bit of 0, sequence numbers MUST NOT be used\n      on the
      PW.\n   These two cases behave as before.\n   [RFC4761] does not allow for the
      S-bit setting to be negotiated\n   either.  In a typical implementation, if
      the PE sets the S-bit in the\n   advertised NLRI, it expects to receive VPLS
      frames with non-zero\n   sequence numbers and will send outgoing frames over
      the PW with\n   non-zero sequence numbers.\n   This memo further specifies the
      expected behavior when the PEs at the\n   ends of the PW advertise differing
      S-bit values.  If the PEs at both\n   ends of the PW do not agree on the setting
      of the S-bit, then the PW\n   SHOULD NOT come up.  This is to avoid running
      into out-of-sequence\n   ordering scenarios when the multiple PEs that are enabling\n
      \  multihoming for a site have differing S-bit advertisements as\n   described
      in Section 4.2 in [RFC4385].  However, if a deployment is\n   known to not utilize
      multihoming, a user-configurable way to override\n   this recommendation MAY
      be provided by an implementation whereby the\n   PW is allowed to come up.  In
      that case, the PE advertising the S-bit\n   as 0 should set sequence numbers
      in the frames as 0, and the PW\n   receiving the frames should not expect to
      receive non-zero sequence\n   numbers.\n"

  - "4.  Using Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSPs as Transport for BGP VPLS\n   BGP VPLS
    can be used over point-to-point Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n   acting as transport
    between the VPLS PEs.  Alternately, BGP VPLS may\n   also be used over Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) LSPs with the source of\n   the P2MP LSP rooted at the PE advertising the
    VPLS BGP NLRI.\n   In a network that uses P2MP LSPs as transport for a VPLS, there
    may\n   be some PEs that support the CW while others may not.  The behavior\n
    \  is similar for the sequencing of VPLS frames.\n   In such a setup, a source
    PE that supports CW should set up two\n   different P2MP LSPs such that:\n   -
    \ One P2MP LSP will transport CW-marked frames to those PEs that\n      advertised
    the C-bit as 1.\n   -  The other P2MP LSP will transport frames without the CW
    to those\n      PEs that advertised the C-bit as 0.\n   Using two different P2MP
    LSPs to deliver frames with and without the\n   CW to different PEs ensures that
    a P2MP root PE honors the C-bit\n   advertised by the other P2MP PEs.\n   However,
    the set of leaves on the two P2MP LSPs (rooted at the given\n   PE) MUST NOT contain
    any PEs that advertised a value for the S-bit\n   different from what the root
    PE itself is advertising.  PEs that\n   advertised their S-bit values differently
    (from what the P2MP root PE\n   advertised) will not be on either of the P2MP
    LSPs.  This ensures\n   that the P2MP root PE is sending VPLS frames only to those
    PEs that\n   agree on the setting of the S-bit.\n   The ingress router for the
    P2MP LSP should send separate NLRIs for\n   the cases of using the CW and for
    not using the CW.\n"

    the above topology, let there be a VPLS configured with the PEs as\n   displayed.
    \ Let PE1 be the PE under consideration that is CW enabled\n   and sequencing
    enabled.  Let PE2 and PE3 also be CW enabled and\n   sequencing enabled.  Let
    PE4 not be CW enabled or have the ability to\n   include sequence numbers.  PE1
    will advertise a VPLS BGP NLRI,\n   containing the C/S-bits marked as 1.  PE2
    and PE3, on learning of the\n   NLRI from PE1, will include the CW and non-zero
    sequence numbers in\n   the VPLS frames being forwarded to PE1 as described in
    Section 4 in\n   [RFC4385].  However, PE4, which does not have the ability to
    include\n   a CW or include non-zero sequence numbers, will not.\n   As per [RFC4761],
    PE1 would expect all other PEs to forward\n   CW-containing frames that have non-zero
    sequence numbers.  That\n   expectation cannot be met by PE4 in this example.
    \ Thus, as per\n   [RFC4761], the PW between PE1 and PE4 does not come up.\n   However,
    this document addresses how an implementation should support\n   BGP VPLS in a
    network where a subset of the BGP VPLS PEs support the\n   CW and/or frame sequencing.
    \ PE1 will not bring up the PW with PE4\n   due to the S-bit mismatch, unless
    overridden by local configuration\n   on PE1 and PE4 as specified in Section 3.2.
    \ If PE4 instead was to\n   advertise a C-bit of 0 and an S-bit of 1, then the
    PW between PE1 and\n   PE4 would come up despite the CW mismatch.  Additionally,
    PE1 would\n   set up its data plane such that it will strip the CW only for those\n
    \  VPLS frames that are received from PEs that have indicated their\n   desire
    to receive CW-marked frames.  So, PE1 will set up its data\n   plane to strip
    the CW only for VPLS frames received from PE2 and PE3,\n   and it will expect
    to process PW frames containing non-zero sequence\n   numbers as described in
    Section 4.2 in [RFC4385].  PE1 will set up\n   its data plane to not strip the
    CW from frames received from PE4, and\n   it would expect PE4 to send frames with
    non-zero sequence numbers.\n   All frames sent by PE4 to PE1 over the PW would
    have a non-zero\n   sequence number.\n"

      \  Consider the case described in Section 5 with CE5 having a connection\n   to
      multiple PEs (multihomed) to PE4 and PE1.  The PW's behavior is\n   similar
      to that for the CW scenario such that the S-bit evaluation\n   SHOULD be independent
      per PW.  So, in the case where PE4 does not set\n   the S-bit in its advertised
      NLRI, there is an S-bit mismatch between\n   PE1 and PE4.  This mismatch prevents
      the PW establishment between PE1\n   and PE4.  So, only one PW -- between PE1
      and PE2 -- would be\n   established for the multihomed site shown.  Thus, even
      though CE5 is\n   physically multihomed, due to PE4's lack of support for sending\n
