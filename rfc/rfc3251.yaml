  - "Abstract\n   Mostly Pointless Lamp Switching (MPLampS) is an architecture for\n\
    \   carrying electricity over IP (with an MPLS control plane).  According\n  \
    \ to our marketing department, MPLampS has the potential to\n   dramatically lower\
    \ the price, ease the distribution and usage, and\n   improve the manageability\
    \ of delivering electricity.  This document\n   is motivated by such work as SONET/SDH\
    \ over IP/MPLS (with apologies\n   to the authors).  Readers of the previous work\
    \ have been observed\n   scratching their heads and muttering, \"What next?\"\
    .  This document\n   answers that question.\n   This document has also been written\
    \ as a public service.  The \"Sub-\n   IP\" area has been formed to give equal\
    \ opportunity to those working\n   on technologies outside of traditional IP networking\
    \ to write\n   complicated IETF documents.  There are possibly many who are\n\
    \   wondering how to exploit this opportunity and attain high visibility.\n  \
    \ Towards this goal, we see the topics of \"foo-over-MPLS\" (or MPLS\n   control\
    \ for random technologies) as highly amenable for producing a\n   countless number\
    \ of unimplementable documents.  This document\n   illustrates the key ingredients\
    \ that go into producing any \"foo-\n   over-MPLS\" document and may be used as\
    \ a template for all such work.\n"

- title: 3. Introduction
  contents:
  - "3. Introduction\n   It was recently brought to our attention that the distribution\n\
    \   network for electricity is not an IP network!  After absorbing the\n   shock\
    \ that was delivered by this news, the following thoughts\n   occurred to us:\n\
    \   1. Electricity distribution must be based on some outdated technology\n  \
    \    (called \"Legacy Distribution System\" or LDS in the rest of the\n      document).\n\
    \   2. An LDS not based on the Internet technology means that two\n      different\
    \ networks (electricity and IP) must be administered and\n      managed.  This\
    \ leads to inefficiencies, higher cost and\n      bureaucratic foul-ups (which\
    \ possibly lead to blackouts in\n      California.  We are in the process of verifying\
    \ this using\n      simulations as part of a student's MS thesis).\n   3. The\
    \ above means that a single network technology (i.e., IP) must\n      be used\
    \ to carry both electricity and Internet traffic.\n   4. An internet draft must\
    \ be written to start work in this area,\n      before someone else does.\n  \
    \ 5. Such a draft can be used to generate further drafts, ensuring that\n    \
    \  we (and CCAMP, MPLS or another responsible working group) will be\n      busy\
    \ for another year.\n   6. The draft can also be posted in the \"white papers\"\
    \ section of our\n      company web page, proclaiming us as revolutionary pioneers.\n\
    \   Hence the present document.\n"

- title: 5. Background
  contents:
  - "5. Background\n   We dug into the electricity distribution technology area to\
    \ get some\n   background.  What we found stunned us, say, with the potency of\
    \ a\n   bare 230V A/C lead dropped into our bathtub while we were still in\n \
    \  it.  To put it simply, electricity is generated and distributed along\n   a\
    \ vast LDS which does not have a single router in it (LSR or\n   otherwise)! \
    \ Furthermore, the control of devices in this network is\n   mostly manual, done\
    \ by folks driving around in trucks.  After\n   wondering momentarily about how\
    \ such a network can exist in the 21st\n   century, we took a pencil and paper\
    \ and sketched out a scenario for\n   integrating the LDS network with the proven\
    \ Internet technology.  The\n   fundamental points we came up with are:\n   1.\
    \ IP packets carry electricity in discrete, digitized form.\n   2. Each packet\
    \ would deliver electricity to its destination (e.g., a\n      device with an\
    \ IP address) on-demand.\n   3. MPLS control will be used to switch packets within\
    \ the core LDS,\n      and in the edge premises.  The architecture for this is\
    \ referred\n      to as Mostly-Pointless Lamp Switching (MPLampS).\n   4. The\
    \ MPLampS architectural model will accommodate both the overlay\n      model,\
    \ where the electricity consuming devices (referred to as\n      \"lamps\") are\
    \ operated over a distinct control plane, and the peer\n      model, in which\
    \ the lamps and the distribution network use a\n      single control plane.\n\
    \   5. RSVP-TE (RSVP with Tariff Extensions) will be used for\n      establishing\
    \ paths for electricity flow in a de-regulated\n      environment.\n   6. COPS\
    \ will be used to support accounting and policy.\n   After jotting these points\
    \ down, we felt better.  We then noted the\n   following immediate advantages\
    \ of the proposed scheme:\n   1. Switches and transformers in the LDS can be replaced\
    \ by LSRs,\n      thereby opening up a new market for routers.\n   2. Electricity\
    \ can be routed over the Internet to reach remote places\n      which presently\
    \ do not have electricity connections but have only\n      Internet kiosks (e.g.,\
    \ rural India).\n   3. Electrical technicians can be replaced by highly paid IP\
    \ network\n      administrators, and\n   4. The IETF can get involved in another\
    \ unrelated technology area.\n   In the following, we describe the technical issues\
    \ in a vague manner.\n"
- title: 6. Electricity Encoding
  contents:
  - "6. Electricity Encoding\n   The Discrete Voltage Encoding (DVE) scheme has been\
    \ specified in ITU\n   standard G.110/230V [2] to digitize electrical voltages.\
    \  In essence,\n   an Electricity Source (ES) such as a generator is connected\
    \ to a DV\n   encoder that encodes the voltage and current, and  produces a bit\n\
    \   stream.  This bit stream can be carried in IP packets to various\n   destinations\
    \ (referred to as LERs - Low-voltage Electricity\n   Receptors) on-demand.  At\
    \ the destination, a DV decoder produces the\n   right voltage and current based\
    \ on the received bit stream.  It is to\n   be determined whether the Real-time\
    \ Transport Protocol (RTP) can be\n   used for achieving synchronization and end-to-end\
    \ control.  We leave\n   draft writing opportunities in the RTP area to our friends\
    \ and\n   colleagues.\n"

- title: 7.1  Overview
  contents:
  - "7.1  Overview\n   In an LDS, the long-haul transmission of electricity is at\
    \ high\n   voltages.  The voltage is stepped down progressively as electricity\n\
    \   flows into local distribution networks and is finally delivered to\n   LERs\
    \ at a standard voltage (e.g., 110V).  Thus, the LDS is a\n   hierarchical network.\
    \  This immediately opens up the possibility of\n   OSPF and ISIS extensions for\
    \ routing electricity in a transmission\n   network, but we'll contain the urge\
    \ to delve into these productive\n   internet draft areas until later.  For the\
    \ present, we limit our\n   discussion merely to controlling the flow of electricity\
    \ in an IP-\n   based distribution network using MPLampS.\n   Under MPLampS, a\
    \ voltage is equated to a label.  In the distribution\n   network, each switching\
    \ element and transformer is viewed as a load-\n   switching router (LSR).  Each\
    \ IP packet carrying an electricity flow\n   is assigned a label corresponding\
    \ to the voltage.  Electricity\n   distribution can then be trivially reduced\
    \ to the task of label\n   (voltage) switching as electricity flows through the\
    \ distribution\n   network.  The configuration of switching elements in the distribution\n\
    \   network is done through RSVP-TE to provide electricity on demand.\n   We admit\
    \ that the above description is vague and sounds crazy.  The\n   example below\
    \ tries to add more (useless) details, without removing\n   any doubts the reader\
    \ might have about the feasibility of this\n   proposal:\n   Example: Turning\
    \ on a Lamp\n   It is assumed that the lamp is controlled by an intelligent device\n\
    \   (e.g, a (light) switch with an MPLampS control plane).  Turning the\n   lamp\
    \ on causes the switch to issue an RSVP-TE request (a PATH message\n   with new\
    \ objects) for the electricity flow.  This PATH message\n   traverses across the\
    \ network to the ES.  The RESV message issued in\n   return sets up the label\
    \ mappings in LSRs.  Finally, electricity\n   starts flowing along the path established.\
    \  It is expected that the\n   entire process will be completed within a few seconds,\
    \ thereby giving\n   the MPLampS architecture a distinct advantage over lighting\
    \ a candle\n   with a damp match stick.\n"
- title: 7.2  Overlay vs Peer Models
  contents:
  - "7.2  Overlay vs Peer Models\n   As noted before, there are two control plane\
    \ models to be considered.\n   Under the overlay model, the lamps and the distribution\
    \ network\n   utilize distinct control planes.  Under the peer model, a single\n\
    \   control plane is used.  A number of arguments can be made for one\n   model\
    \ versus the other, and these will be covered in the upcoming\n   framework document.\
    \  We merely observe here that it is the lamp\n   vendors who prefer the peer\
    \ model against the better judgement of the\n   LSR vendors.  We, however, want\
    \ to please both camps regardless of\n   the usefulness of either model.  We therefore\
    \ note here that MPLampS\n   supports both models and also migration scenarios\
    \ from overlay to\n   peer.\n"

  - "7.3 Routing in the Core Network\n   The above description of the hierarchical\
    \ distribution system\n   immediately opens up the possibility of applying OSPF\

    \ are\n   already working on such concepts as voltage bundling, multi-area\n \
    \  tariff extensions, insulated LSAs, etc.  Future documents will\n   describe\
    \ the details.\n"

    \ due to\n   interference from other customers.  Indeed, some may argue that the\n\
    \   entire MPLampS architecture may be trashed if not for the possibility\n  \
    \ of doing VPNs.  Whatever be the case, VPNs are a hot topic today and\n   the\
    \ readers are forewarned that we have every intention of writing\n   several documents\
    \ on this.  Specifically, BGP-support for VPNs is an\n   area we're presently\

- title: 8. Multicast
  contents:
  - "8. Multicast\n   It has been observed that there is a strong spatial and temporal\n\
    \   locality in electricity demand.  ITU Study Group 55 has studied this\n   phenomenon\
    \ for over a decade and has issued a preliminary report.\n   This report states\
    \ that when a lamp is turned on in one house, it is\n   usually the case that\
    \ lamps are turned on in neighboring houses at\n   around the same time (usually\
    \ at dusk) [3].  This observation has a\n   serious implication on the scalability\
    \ of the signaling mechanism.\n   Specifically, the distribution network must\
    \ be able to handle tens of\n   thousands of requests all at once.  The signaling\
    \ load can be reduced\n   if multicast delivery is used.  Briefly, a request for\
    \ electricity is\n   not sent from the lamp all the way to an ES, but is handled\
    \ by the\n   first LSR that is already in the path to another lamp.\n   Support\
    \ for this requires the application of multicast routing\n   protocols together\
    \ with RSVP-TE shared reservation styles and the\n   development of MPLampS multicast\
    \ forwarding mode.  We are currently\n   studying the following multicast routing\
    \ protocol:\n   o DVMRP: Discrete Voltage Multicast Routing Protocol - this protocol\n\
    \   works over existing voltage routing protocols but the danger here is\n   that\
    \ electricity is delivered to all lamps when any one lamp is\n   turned on.  Indeed,\
    \ the switching semantics gets annoying - all lamps\n   get turned on periodically\
    \ and those not needed must be switched off\n   each time manually.\n   Other\
    \ protocols we will eventually consider are Current-Based Tree\n   (CBT) and Practically\
    \ Irrelevant Multicast (PIM).  An issue we are\n   greatly interested in is multicast\
    \ scope: we would like support for\n   distributing electricity with varying scope,\
    \ from lamps within a\n   single Christmas tree to those in entire cities.  Needless\
    \ to say, we\n   will write many detailed documents on these topics as time\n\
    \   progresses.\n"
