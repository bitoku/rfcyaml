  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used for\
    \ exchanging\n   and converting data between various spreadsheet programs for\
    \ quite\n   some time.  Surprisingly, while this format is very common, it has\n\
    \   never been formally documented.  Additionally, while the IANA MIME\n   registration\
    \ tree includes a registration for\n   \"text/tab-separated-values\" type, no\
    \ MIME types have ever been\n   registered with IANA for CSV.  At the same time,\
    \ various programs and\n   operating systems have begun to use different MIME\
    \ types for this\n   format.  This RFC documents the format of comma separated\
    \ values\n   (CSV) files and formally registers the \"text/csv\" MIME type for\
    \ CSV\n   in accordance with RFC 2048 [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of the CSV Format
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of the CSV Format\n   While there are various specifications and\
    \ implementations for the\n   CSV format (for ex. [4], [5], [6] and [7]), there\
    \ is no formal\n   specification in existence, which allows for a wide variety\
    \ of\n   interpretations of CSV files.  This section documents the format that\n\
    \   seems to be followed by most implementations:\n   1.  Each record is located\
    \ on a separate line, delimited by a line\n       break (CRLF).  For example:\n\
    \       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF\n       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF\n   2.  The last record in the\
    \ file may or may not have an ending line\n       break.  For example:\n     \
    \  aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF\n       zzz,yyy,xxx\n   3.  There maybe an optional header\
    \ line appearing as the first line\n       of the file with the same format as\
    \ normal record lines.  This\n       header will contain names corresponding to\
    \ the fields in the file\n       and should contain the same number of fields\
    \ as the records in\n       the rest of the file (the presence or absence of the\
    \ header line\n       should be indicated via the optional \"header\" parameter\
    \ of this\n       MIME type).  For example:\n       field_name,field_name,field_name\
    \ CRLF\n       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF\n       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF\n   4.  Within the header\
    \ and each record, there may be one or more\n       fields, separated by commas.\
    \  Each line should contain the same\n       number of fields throughout the file.\
    \  Spaces are considered part\n       of a field and should not be ignored.  The\
    \ last field in the\n       record must not be followed by a comma.  For example:\n\
    \       aaa,bbb,ccc\n   5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes\
    \ (however\n       some programs, such as Microsoft Excel, do not use double quotes\n\
    \       at all).  If fields are not enclosed with double quotes, then\n      \
    \ double quotes may not appear inside the fields.  For example:\n       \"aaa\"\
    ,\"bbb\",\"ccc\" CRLF\n       zzz,yyy,xxx\n   6.  Fields containing line breaks\
    \ (CRLF), double quotes, and commas\n       should be enclosed in double-quotes.\
    \  For example:\n       \"aaa\",\"b CRLF\n       bb\",\"ccc\" CRLF\n       zzz,yyy,xxx\n\
    \   7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote\n   \
    \    appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with\n       another\
    \ double quote.  For example:\n       \"aaa\",\"b\"\"bb\",\"ccc\"\n   The ABNF\
    \ grammar [2] appears as follows:\n   file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record)\
    \ [CRLF]\n   header = name *(COMMA name)\n   record = field *(COMMA field)\n \
    \  name = field\n   field = (escaped / non-escaped)\n   escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA\
    \ / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE\n   non-escaped = *TEXTDATA\n   COMMA =\
    \ %x2C\n   CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n   DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as\
    \ per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n   LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234\
    \ [2]\n   CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]\n   TEXTDATA =  %x20-21\
    \ / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E\n"
- title: 3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv
  contents:
  - "3.  MIME Type Registration of text/csv\n   This section provides the media-type\
    \ registration application (as per\n   RFC 2048 [1].\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n\
    \   Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/csv\n   MIME media type name:\
    \ text\n   MIME subtype name: csv\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters:\
    \ charset, header\n      Common usage of CSV is US-ASCII, but other character\
    \ sets defined\n      by IANA for the \"text\" tree may be used in conjunction\
    \ with the\n      \"charset\" parameter.\n      The \"header\" parameter indicates\
    \ the presence or absence of the\n      header line.  Valid values are \"present\"\
    \ or \"absent\".\n      Implementors choosing not to use this parameter must make\
    \ their\n      own decisions as to whether the header line is present or absent.\n\
    \   Encoding considerations:\n      As per section 4.1.1. of RFC 2046 [3], this\
    \ media type uses CRLF\n      to denote line breaks.  However, implementors should\
    \ be aware that\n      some implementations may use other values.\n   Security\
    \ considerations:\n      CSV files contain passive text data that should not pose\
    \ any\n      risks.  However, it is possible in theory that malicious binary\n\
    \      data may be included in order to exploit potential buffer overruns\n  \
    \    in the program processing CSV data.  Additionally, private data\n      may\
    \ be shared via this format (which of course applies to any text\n      data).\n\
    \   Interoperability considerations:\n      Due to lack of a single specification,\
    \ there are considerable\n      differences among implementations.  Implementors\
    \ should \"be\n      conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept\
    \ from\n      others\" (RFC 793 [8]) when processing CSV files.  An attempt at\
    \ a\n      common definition can be found in Section 2.\n      Implementations\
    \ deciding not to use the optional \"header\"\n      parameter must make their\
    \ own decision as to whether the header is\n      absent or present.\n   Published\
    \ specification:\n      While numerous private specifications exist for various\
    \ programs\n      and systems, there is no single \"master\" specification for\
    \ this\n      format.  An attempt at a common definition can be found in Section\n\
    \      2.\n   Applications that use this media type:\n      Spreadsheet programs\
    \ and various data conversion utilities\n   Additional information:\n      Magic\
    \ number(s): none\n      File extension(s): CSV\n      Macintosh File Type Code(s):\
