  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a convention for encapsulating Simple Network\n
    \  Management Protocol (SNMP) [1] packets over the transport mechanism\n   provided
    via the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol [2].\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined
    in [1] is\n   now used as an integral part of the network management framework
    for\n   TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its companion standards, which\n
    \  define the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [3,4], and the\n   Management
    Information Base (MIB) [5], the SNMP has received\n   widespread deployment in
    many operational networks running the\n   Internet suite of protocols.\n   The
    success of SNMP in the TCP/IP environment has led to its\n   deployment in non
    TCP/IP-based internets. This specification\n   describes the mapping of SNMP onto
    the Internetwork Packet Exchange\n   (IPX) protocol [2] used in Novell NetWare
    environments.\n   As noted in [6], the preferred mapping for SNMP is onto UDP
    [7].  As\n   such, this specification is intended for use in environments where\n
    \  UDP transport is not available.  No aspect of this specification\n   should
    be construed as a suggestion that, in a heterogeneous\n   transport environment,
    a managed agent should support more than one\n   mapping. Conversely, management
    stations are strongly encouraged to\n   support mappings of SNMP onto all popular
    transports.\n"

  - "2.  Mapping SNMP onto IPX\n   Mapping SNMP onto IPX is straight-forward since
    IPX provides a\n   datagram service very similar to that provided by IP/UDP.\n
    \  Although modifications have been made elsewhere in the NetWare\n   protocol
    suite, IPX is identical to the Xerox Internet Datagram\n   Protocol (IDP) [8].
    \ The socket address space authority is\n   administered by Novell.\n   SNMP packets
    will always set the Packet Type field in the IPX header\n   to 4 (i.e., Packet
    Exchange Packet).\n"

  - "2.1  Socket Assignments\n   SNMP protocol entities will receive GetRequest-PDU,
    GetNextRequest-\n   PDU, and SetRequest-PDU messages on socket 36879 (Destination
    Socket\n   field set to hexadecimal 900F), and Trap-PDU messages on socket 36880\n
    \  (Destination Socket field set to hexadecimal 9010).\n   GetResponse-PDU messages
    will be addressed to the IPX address and\n   socket from which the corresponding
    GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-\n   PDU, or SetRequest-PDU originated.\n"

  - "2.2  Traps\n   When SNMP traps are sent over IPX, the agent-addr field in the
    Trap-\n   PDU contains the IP-address \"0.0.0.0\".  An SNMP manager may ascertain\n
    \  the source of the trap based on information provided by the transport\n   service\n"

  - "2.3  Maximum Message Size\n   Although SNMP does not require conformant implementations
    to accept\n   messages whose length exceeds 484 bytes, it is recommended that\n
    \  implementations support a maximum SNMP message size of 546 bytes (the\n   maximum
    size allowed under IPX).  Furthermore, this limit is the\n   maximum packet length
    guaranteed to traverse IPX routers which do not\n   provide fragmentation.  Implementors
    may choose to use longer packet\n   lengths if the maximum is known, which depends
    on the intermediate\n   routers and/or intermediate datalink layer protocols.\n"
