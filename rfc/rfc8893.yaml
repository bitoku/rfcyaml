  - "Abstract\n   A BGP speaker may perform Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)\n
    \  origin validation not only on routes received from BGP neighbors and\n   routes
    that are redistributed from other routing protocols, but also\n   on routes it
    sends to BGP neighbors.  For egress policy, it is\n   important that the classification
    use the 'effective origin AS' of\n   the processed route, which may specifically
    be altered by the\n   commonly available knobs, such as removing private ASes,\n
    \  confederation handling, and other modifications of the origin AS.\n   This
    document updates RFC 6811.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document does not change the protocol or semantics
    of [RFC6811],\n   BGP prefix origin validation.  It highlights an important use
    case of\n   origin validation in external BGP (eBGP) egress policies, explaining\n
    \  specifics of correct implementation in this context.\n   The term 'effective
    origin AS' as used in this document refers to the\n   Route Origin Autonomous
    System Number (ASN) [RFC6811] of the UPDATE\n   to be sent to neighboring BGP
    speakers.\n   The effective origin AS of a BGP UPDATE is decided by configuration\n
    \  and outbound policy of the BGP speaker.  A validating BGP speaker\n   MUST
    apply Route Origin Validation policy semantics (see Section 2 of\n   [RFC6811]
    and Section 4 of [RFC8481]) after applying any egress\n   configuration and policy.\n
    \  This effective origin AS of the announcement might be affected by\n   removal
    of private ASes, confederation [RFC5065], migration\n   [RFC7705], etc.  Any AS_PATH
    modifications resulting in effective\n   origin AS change MUST be taken into account.\n
    \  This document updates [RFC6811] by clarifying that implementations\n   must
    use the effective origin AS to determine the Origin Validation\n   state when
    applying egress policy.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear
    in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Suggested Reading\n   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP [RFC4271],
    the RPKI\n   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) [RFC6482], RPKI-based\n
    \  Prefix Validation [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications\n   [RFC8481].\n"
  title: 2.  Suggested Reading
- contents:
  - "3.  Egress Processing\n   BGP implementations supporting RPKI-based origin validation
    MUST\n   provide the same policy configuration primitives for decisions based\n
    \  on the validation state available for use in ingress, redistribution,\n   and
    egress policies.  When applied to egress policy, validation state\n   MUST be
    determined using the effective origin AS of the route as it\n   will (or would)
    be announced to the peer.  The effective origin AS\n   may differ from that of
    the route in the RIB due to commonly\n   available knobs, such as removal of private
    ASes, AS path\n   manipulation, confederation handling, etc.\n   Egress policy
    handling can provide more robust protection for\n   outbound eBGP than relying
    solely on ingress (iBGP, eBGP, connected,\n   static, etc.) redistribution being
    configured and working correctly\n   -- i.e., better support for the robustness
    principle.\n"
  title: 3.  Egress Processing
- contents:
  - "4.  Operational Considerations\n   Configurations may have a complex policy where
    the effective origin\n   AS may not be easily determined before the outbound policies
    have\n   been run.  It SHOULD be possible to specify a selective origin\n   validation
    policy to be applied after any existing non-validating\n   outbound policies.\n
    \  An implementation SHOULD be able to list announcements that were not\n   sent
    to a peer, e.g., because they were marked Invalid, as long as\n   the router still
    has them in memory.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not create security considerations
    beyond those of\n   [RFC6811] and [RFC8481].  By facilitating more correct validation,
    it\n   attempts to improve BGP reliability.\n"
