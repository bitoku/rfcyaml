Command Meanings IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication type pair> AUTH <kerberos ticket and authenticator> IAC SE
This is used to pass the Kerberos ticket to the remote side of the connection.
The first octet of the <authentication type pair> value is KERBEROS V4, to indicate the usage of Kerberos version 4.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair>
This command indicates that the authentication was successful.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair> REJECT <optional reason for rejection>
This command indicates that the authentication was not successful, and if there is any more data in the sub option, it is an ASCII text message of the reason for the rejection.
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication type pair> CHALLENGE <encrypted challenge> IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication type pair>
These two commands are used to perform mutual authentication.
They are only used when the AUTH HOW MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of the authentication type pair.
After successfully sending an AUTH and receiving an ACCEPT, a CHALLENGE is sent.
The challenge is a random 8 byte number with the most significant byte first, and the least significant byte last.
When the CHALLENGE command is sent, the "encrypted challenge" is the 8 byte challenge encrypted in the session key.
When the CHALLENGE command is received, the contents are decrypted to get the original 8 byte  challenge, this value is then incremented by one, re encrypted with the session key, and returned as the "encrypted response" in the RESPONSE command.
The receiver of the RESPONSE command decrypts the "encrypted response", and verifies that the resultant value is the original 8 byte challenge incremented by one.
The "encrypted challenge" value sent/received in the CHALLENGE command is also encrypted with the session key on both sides of the session, to produce a random 8 byte key to be used as the default key for the ENCRYPTION option.
If the second octet of the authentication type pair has the AUTH WHO bit set to AUTH CLIENT TO SERVER, then the client sends the initial AUTH command, and the server responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
In addition, if the AUTH HOW bit is set to AUTH HOW MUTUAL, and the server responds with ACCEPT, then the client then sends a CHALLENGE, and the server sends a RESPONSE.
If the second octet of the authentication type pair has the AUTH WHO bit set to AUTH SERVER TO CLIENT, then the server sends the initial AUTH command, and the client responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
In addition, if the AUTH HOW bit is set to AUTH HOW MUTUAL, and the client responds with ACCEPT, then the server then sends a CHALLENGE, and the client sends a RESPONSE.
The authenticator (Kerberos Principal) used is of the form "rcmd.host@realm".
Examples User "joe" may wish to log in as user "pete" on machine "foo".
If "pete" has set things up on "foo" to allow "joe" access to his account, then the client would send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete" IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION
The server would then authenticate the user as "joe" from the ticket information, and since "pete" is allowing "joe" to use his account, the server would send back ACCEPT.
If mutual authentication is being used, the the client would send a CHALLENGE, and verify the RESPONSE that the server sends back.
[ The server is now free to request authentication information. ]
IAC SB AUTHENTICATION SEND KERBEROS V4 CLIENT
MUTUAL KERBEROS V4 CLIENT ONE WAY IAC SE
[ The server has requested mutual Version 4 Kerberos authentication.
If mutual authentication is not supported, then the server is willing to do one way authentication.
The client will now respond with the name of the user that it wants to log in as, and the Kerberos ticket.

yy yy IAC SE Security Considerations
The ability to negotiate a common authentication mechanism between client and server is a feature of the authentication option that should be used with caution.
When the negotiation is performed, no authentication has yet occurred.
Therefore, each system has no way of knowing whether or not it is talking to the system it intends.
An intruder could attempt to negotiate the use of an authentication system which is either weak, or already compromised by the intruder.
