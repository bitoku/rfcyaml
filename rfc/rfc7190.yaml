  - "Abstract\n   Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques, and\n\
    \   many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in\n  \
    \ very high-bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core\n   networks.\
    \  MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) has strongly discouraged\n   the use of multipath\
    \ techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP\n   Operations, Administration, and\
    \ Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot\n   be avoided when operating over many\
    \ types of multipath\n   implementations.\n   Using MPLS Entropy Labels (RFC 6790),\
    \ MPLS Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs) can be carried over multipath links while\
    \ also providing a\n   fully MPLS-TP-compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.\
    \  This document\n   describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer\
    \ for MPLS-TP.\n   The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Today the requirement to handle large aggregations of traffic\
    \ can be\n   met by a number of techniques that we will collectively call\n  \
    \ \"multipath\".  Multipath applied to parallel links between the same\n   set\
    \ of nodes includes Ethernet Link Aggregation [IEEE-802.1AX], link\n   bundling\
    \ [RFC4201], or other aggregation techniques, some of which\n   could be vendor\
    \ specific.  Multipath applied to diverse paths rather\n   than parallel links\
    \ includes Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) as applied\n   to OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP,\
    \ and equal-cost Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n   Some vendors support load splitting\
    \ across equal-cost MPLS LSPs where\n   the load is split proportionally to the\
    \ reserved bandwidth of the set\n   of LSPs.\n   RFC 5654 requirement 33 requires\
    \ the capability to carry a client\n   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) or MPLS\
    \ layer over a server MPLS-TP\n   or MPLS layer [RFC5654].  This is possible in\
    \ all cases with one\n   exception.  When an MPLS LSP exceeds the capacity of\
    \ any single\n   component link, it MAY be carried by a network using multipath\n\
    \   techniques, but it SHOULD NOT be carried by a single MPLS-TP LSP due\n   to\
    \ the inherent MPLS-TP capacity limitation imposed by MPLS-TP\n   Operations,\
    \ Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) fate-sharing\n   constraints and MPLS-TP\
    \ Loss Measurement OAM packet-ordering\n   constraints (see Section 3.1).  Instead,\
    \ multiple MPLS-TP LSPs SHOULD\n   be used to carry a large MPLS LSP (see Section\
    \ 4).\n   The term \"composite link\" is more general than terms such as \"link\n\
    \   aggregation\" (which is specific to Ethernet) or \"ECMP\" (which implies\n\
    \   equal-cost paths within a routing protocol).  The use of the term\n   \"composite\
    \ link\" here is consistent with the broad definition in\n   [ITU-T.G.800].  Multipath\
    \ is very similar to composite link as\n   defined by ITU-T but specifically excludes\
    \ inverse multiplexing.\n   MPLS LSPs today are able to function as a server layer\
    \ and carry\n   client MPLS LSPs.  When control-plane signaling is used, forwarding\n\
    \   adjacency (FA) advertisements are used to inform the set of Label\n   Switching\
    \ Routers (LSRs) of Packet Switching Capable (PSC) LSPs\n   within the MPLS topology\
    \ [RFC4206].  Client MPLS LSP at a higher\n   layer (lower PSC number) may signal\
    \ their intention to use PSC LSPs\n   as hops in the RSVP-TE Explicit Route Object\
    \ (ERO).  LSRs with no\n   explicit support for RFC 4206 see the PSC LSPs as ordinary\
    \ links and\n   therefore use them.\n   An MPLS LSP that has been set up using\
    \ RSVP-TE appears to its ingress\n   LSR as a viable IP next hop to a distant\
    \ LSR.  If LDP is used and\n   bidirectional RSVP-TE LSP connectivity is available,\
    \ then LDP\n   signaling can be set up among the RSVP-TE LSP endpoints, and LDP\
    \ can\n   make use of the RSVP-TE LSP as an LDP hop.  This is another form of\n\
    \   existing MPLS-in-MPLS use.  MPLS LSPs may also make use of hierarchy\n   that\
    \ is configured through the management plane rather than signaled\n   using RSVP-TE.\n\
    \   These existing forms of MPLS-in-MPLS may traverse multipath hops such\n  \
    \ as Ethernet Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE-802.1AX] or MPLS Link\n   Bundling\
    \ [RFC4201].  MPLS-TP brings with it a new set of requirements\n   not considered\
    \ in past deployments of the various forms of MPLS-in-\n   MPLS where multipath\
    \ was in use.  This document merely discusses use\n   of existing forwarding and\
    \ protocol mechanisms that can support the\n   case where either the client-layer\
    \ LSPs or the server-layer LSPs are\n   MPLS-TP and where multipath is used.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   Please refer to the terminology related to multipath introduced\
    \ in\n   [ADV-MULTIPATH-REQ].  The following additional terms are used in this\n\
    \   document; related terms are grouped together.\n   Link Bundle\n       Link\
    \ bundling is a multipath technique specific to MPLS\n       [RFC4201].  Link\
    \ bundling supports two modes of operations.\n       Either an LSP can be placed\
    \ on one component link of a link\n       bundle, or an LSP can be load-split\
    \ across all members of the\n       bundle.  There is no signaling defined that\
    \ allows a per-LSP\n       preference regarding load split, therefore whether\
    \ to load split\n       is generally configured per bundle and applied to all\
    \ LSPs across\n       the bundle.\n   All-Ones Component\n       Within the context\
    \ of link bundling, [RFC4201] defines a special\n       case where the same label\
    \ is to be valid across all component\n       links.  This case is indicated in\
    \ signaling by a bit value of\n       \"all ones\" when identifying a component\
    \ link.  Following the\n       publication of RFC 4201, for brevity this special\
    \ case has been\n       referred to as the \"all-ones component\".\n   Equal-Cost\
    \ Multipath (ECMP)\n       Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) is a specific form of multipath\
    \ in\n       which the costs of the links or paths must be equal in a given\n\
    \       routing protocol.  The load may be split equally across all\n       available\
    \ links (or available paths), or the load may be split\n       proportionally\
    \ to the capacity of each link (or path).\n   Loop-Free Alternate Paths (LFA)\n\
    \       \"Loop-free alternate paths\" (LFA) are defined in Section 5.2 of\n  \
    \     RFC 5714 [RFC5714] as follows: \"Such a path exists when a direct\n    \
    \   neighbor of the router adjacent to the failure has a path to the\n       destination\
    \ that can be guaranteed not to traverse the failure.\"\n       Further detail\
    \ can be found in [RFC5286].  LFA as defined for IP\n       Fast Reroute (IPFRR)\
    \ can be used to load balance by relaxing the\n       equal-cost criteria of ECMP,\
    \ though IPFRR defined LFA for use in\n       selecting protection paths.  When\
    \ used with IP, proportional\n       split is generally not used.  LFA use in\
    \ load balancing is\n       implemented by some vendors, though it may be rare\
    \ or non-\n       existent in deployments.\n   Link Aggregation\n       The term\
    \ \"link aggregation\" generally refers to Ethernet Link\n       Aggregation as\
    \ defined by [IEEE-802.1AX].  Ethernet Link\n       Aggregation defines a Link\
    \ Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)\n       which coordinates inclusion of Link\
    \ Aggregation Group (LAG)\n       members in the LAG.\n   Link Aggregation Group\
    \ (LAG)\n       A group of physical Ethernet interfaces that are treated as a\n\
    \       logical link when using Ethernet Link Aggregation is referred to\n   \
    \    as a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).\n   LAG Member\n       Ethernet Link Aggregation\
    \ as defined in [IEEE-802.1AX] refers to\n       an individual link in a LAG as\
    \ a LAG member.  A LAG member is a\n       component link.  An Ethernet LAG is\
    \ a composite link.  IEEE does\n       not use the terms \"composite link\" or\
    \ \"component link\".\n   A small set of requirements are discussed.  These requirements\
    \ make\n   use of keywords such as MUST and SHOULD as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  MPLS as a Server Layer for MPLS-TP\n   An MPLS LSP may be used as a server\
    \ layer for MPLS-TP LSPs as long as\n   all MPLS-TP requirements are met.  Section\
    \ 3.1 reviews the basis for\n   requirements of a server layer that supports MPLS-TP\
    \ as a client\n   layer.  Key requirements include OAM \"fate-sharing\" and that\
    \ packets\n   within an MPLS-TP LSP (including both payload and OAM packets) not\
    \ be\n   reordered.  Section 3.2 discusses implied requirements where MPLS is\n\
    \   the server layer for MPLS-TP client LSPs and describes a set of\n   solutions\

- title: 3.1.  MPLS-TP Forwarding and Server-Layer Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MPLS-TP Forwarding and Server-Layer Requirements\n   [RFC5960] defines\
    \ the data-plane requirements for MPLS-TP.  Two very\n   relevant paragraphs in\
    \ Section 3.1.1 (\"LSP Packet Encapsulation and\n   Forwarding\") are the following:\n\
    \   RFC 5960, Section 3.1.1, Paragraph 3\n       Except for transient packet reordering\
    \ that may occur, for\n       example, during fault conditions, packets are delivered\
    \ in order\n       on L-LSPs, and on E-LSPs within a specific ordered aggregate.\n\
    \   RFC 5960, Section 3.1.1, Paragraph 6\n       Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)\
    \ load-balancing MUST NOT be performed\n       on an MPLS-TP LSP.  MPLS-TP LSPs\
    \ as defined in this document MAY\n       operate over a server layer that supports\
    \ load-balancing, but\n       this load-balancing MUST operate in such a manner\
    \ that it is\n       transparent to MPLS-TP.  This does not preclude the future\n\
    \       definition of new MPLS-TP LSP types that have different\n       requirements\
    \ regarding the use of ECMP in the server layer.\n   [RFC5960], Section 3.1.1,\
    \ Paragraph 3 requires that packets within a\n   specific ordered aggregate be\
    \ delivered in order.  This same\n   requirement is already specified by Differentiated\
    \ Services\n   [RFC2475].  [RFC5960], Section 3.1.1, Paragraph 6 explicitly allows\
    \ a\n   server layer to use ECMP, provided that it is transparent to the\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ client layer.\n   [RFC6371] adds a requirement for data traffic and OAM traffic\
    \ \"fate-\n   sharing\".  The following paragraph in Section 1 (\"Introduction\"\
    )\n   summarizes this requirement.\n   RFC 6371, Section 1, Paragraph 7\n    \
    \   OAM packets that instrument a particular direction of a transport\n      \
    \ path are subject to the same forwarding treatment (i.e., fate-\n       share)\
    \ as the user data packets and in some cases, where\n       Explicitly TC-encoded-PSC\
    \ LSPs (E-LSPs) are employed, may be\n       required to have common per-hop behavior\
    \ (PHB) Scheduling Class\n       (PSC) End-to-End (E2E) with the class of traffic\
    \ monitored.  In\n       case of Label-Only-Inferred-PSC LSP (L-LSP), only one\
    \ class of\n       traffic needs to be monitored, and therefore the OAM packets\
    \ have\n       common PSC with the monitored traffic class.\n   [RFC6371] does\
    \ not prohibit multilink techniques in Section 4.6\n   (\"Fate-Sharing Considerations\
    \ for Multilink\"), where multilink is\n   defined as Ethernet Link Aggregation\
    \ and the use of Link Bundling for\n   MPLS, but it does declare that such a network\
    \ would be only partially\n   MPLS-TP compliant.  The characteristic that is to\
    \ be avoided is\n   contained in the following sentence in that section.\n   RFC\
    \ 6371, Section 4.6, Paragraph 1, last sentence\n       These techniques frequently\
    \ share the characteristic that an LSP\n       may be spread over a set of component\
    \ links and therefore be\n       reordered, but no flow within the LSP is reordered\
    \ (except when\n       very infrequent and minimally disruptive load rebalancing\n\
    \       occurs).\n   A declaration that implies that Link Bundling for MPLS yields\
    \ a\n   partially MPLS-TP-compliant network is perhaps overstated since only\n\
    \   the Link Bundling all-ones component link has this characteristic.\n   [RFC6374]\
    \ defines a direct Loss Measurement (LM) where LM OAM packets\n   cannot be reordered\
    \ with respect to payload packets.  This will\n   require that payload packets\
    \ themselves not be reordered.  The\n   following paragraph in Section 2.9.4 (\"\
    Equal Cost Multipath\") gives\n   the reason for this restriction.\n   RFC 6374,\
    \ Section 2.9.4, Paragraph 2\n       The effects of ECMP on loss measurement will\
    \ depend on the LM\n       mode.  In the case of direct LM, the measurement will\
    \ account for\n       any packets lost between the sender and the receiver, regardless\n\
    \       of how many paths exist between them.  However, the presence of\n    \
    \   ECMP increases the likelihood of misordering both of LM messages\n       relative\
    \ to data packets and of the LM messages themselves.  Such\n       misorderings\
    \ tend to create unmeasurable intervals and thus\n       degrade the accuracy\
    \ of loss measurement.  The effects of ECMP\n       are similar for inferred LM,\
    \ with the additional caveat that,\n       unless the test packets are specially\
    \ constructed so as to probe\n       all available paths, the loss characteristics\
    \ of one or more of\n       the alternate paths cannot be accounted for.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Methods of Supporting MPLS-TP Client LSPs over MPLS\n   Supporting MPLS-TP\
    \ LSPs over a fully MPLS-TP conformant MPLS LSP\n   server layer where the MPLS\
    \ LSPs are making use of multipath requires\n   special treatment of the MPLS-TP\
    \ LSPs such that those LSPs meet MPLS-\n   TP forwarding requirements (see Section\
    \ 3.1).  This implies the\n   following brief set of requirements.\n   MP#1  It\
    \ MUST be possible for a midpoint MPLS-TP Label Switching\n         Router (LSR)\
    \ that is serving as ingress to a server-layer MPLS\n         LSP to identify\
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs, so that MPLS-TP forwarding\n         requirements can be applied,\
    \ or to otherwise accommodate the\n         MPLS-TP forwarding requirements.\n\
    \   MP#2  The ability to completely exclude MPLS-TP LSPs from the\n         multipath\
    \ hash and load split SHOULD be supported.  If the\n         selected component\
    \ link no longer meets requirements, an LSP is\n         considered down, which\
    \ may trigger protection and/or may\n         require that the ingress LSR select\
    \ a new path and signal a new\n         LSP.\n   MP#3  It SHOULD be possible to\
    \ ensure that MPLS-TP LSPs will not be\n         moved to another component link\
    \ as a result of a load-\n         rebalancing operation for multipath.  If the\
    \ selected component\n         link no longer meets requirements, another component\
    \ link may\n         be selected; however, a change in path SHOULD NOT occur solely\n\
    \         for load balancing.\n   MP#4  Where a Resource Reservation Protocol\
    \ - Traffic Engineering\n         (RSVP-TE) control plane is used, it MUST be\
    \ possible for an\n         ingress LSR that is setting up an MPLS-TP or an MPLS\
    \ LSP to\n         determine at path selection time whether a link or Forwarding\n\
    \         Adjacency (FA; see [RFC4206]) within the topology can support\n    \
    \     the MPLS-TP requirements of the LSP.\n   The reason for requirement MP#1\
    \ may not be obvious.  An MPLS-TP LSP\n   may be aggregated along with other client\
    \ LSPs by a midpoint LSR into\n   a very large MPLS server-layer LSP, as would\
    \ be the case in a core-\n   node-to-core-node MPLS LSP between major cities.\
    \  In this case, the\n   ingress of the MPLS LSP, being a midpoint LSR for a set\
    \ of client\n   LSPs, has no signaling mechanism that can be used to determine\n\
    \   whether one of its specific client LSPs is using MPLS or MPLS-TP.\n   Multipath\
    \ load splitting can be avoided for MPLS-TP LSPs if at the\n   MPLS server-layer\
    \ LSP ingress LSR an Entropy Label Indicator (ELI)\n   and Entropy Label (EL)\
    \ are added to the label stack by the midpoint\n   LSR for the client MPLS-TP\
    \ LSP, at the ingress of the MPLS LSP\n   [RFC6790].  For those client LSPs that\
    \ are MPLS-TP LSPs, a single\n   per-LSP EL value must be chosen.  For those client\
    \ LSPs that are MPLS\n   LSPs, per-packet entropy below the top label must, for\
    \ practical\n   reasons, be used to determine the entropy label value.  The resulting\n\
    \   label stack contains the server MPLS LSP label, ELI, EL and the\n   client\
    \ LSP label.  Requirement MP#1 simply states that there must be\n   a means to\
    \ make this decision.\n   There is currently no signaling mechanism defined to\
    \ support\n   requirement MP#1, though that does not preclude a new extension\
    \ being\n   defined later.  In the absence of a signaling extension, MPLS-TP can\n\
    \   be identified through some form of configuration, such as\n   configuration\
    \ that provides an MPLS-TP-compatible server layer to all\n   LSPs arriving on\
    \ a specific interface or originating from a specific\n   set of ingress LSRs.\n\
    \   Alternatively, the need for requirement MP#1 can be eliminated if\n   every\
    \ MPLS-TP LSP created by an MPLS-TP ingress makes use of an\n   Entropy Label\
    \ Indicator (ELI) and Entropy Label (EL) below the MPLS-\n   TP label [RFC6790].\
    \  This would require that all MPLS-TP LSRs in a\n   deployment support Entropy\
    \ Label, which may render it impractical in\n   many deployments.\n   Some hardware\
    \ that exists today can support requirement MP#2.\n   Signaling in the absence\
    \ of MPLS Entropy Labels can make use of link\n   bundling with the path pinned\
    \ to a specific component for MPLS-TP\n   LSPs and link bundling using the all-ones\
    \ component for MPLS LSPs.\n   This prevents MPLS-TP LSPs from being carried within\
    \ MPLS LSPs but\n   does allow the coexistence of MPLS-TP and very large MPLS\
    \ LSPs.\n   When Entropy Label Indicators (ELIs) and Entropy Labels (ELs) are\
    \ not\n   applied by MPLS-TP ingresses, MPLS-TP LSPs can be carried as client\n\
    \   LSPs within an MPLS server LSP if the ingress of the MPLS server-\n   layer\
    \ LSP pushes an Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) and Entropy Label\n   (EL) below\
    \ the server-layer LSP label(s) in the label stack, just\n   above the MPLS-TP\
    \ LSP label entry [RFC6790].  The value of EL can be\n   randomly selected at\
    \ the client MPLS-TP LSP setup time, and the same\n   EL value can be used for\
    \ all packets of that MPLS-TP LSP.  This\n   allows MPLS-TP LSPs to be carried\
    \ as client LSPs within MPLS LSPs and\n   satisfies MPLS-TP forwarding requirements\
    \ but requires that MPLS LSRs\n   be able to identify MPLS-TP LSPs (requirement\
    \ MP#1).\n   MPLS-TP traffic can be protected from degraded performance due to\
    \ an\n   imperfect load split if the MPLS-TP traffic is given queuing\n   priority.\
    \  For example, using (1) strict priority and policing,\n   shaping at ingress,\
    \ or per-LSP shaping locally, or (2) per-LSP\n   weighted queuing locally.  This\
    \ can be accomplished using the Traffic\n   Class (TC) field and Diffserv treatment\
    \ of traffic [RFC5462]\n   [RFC2475].  In the event of congestion due to load\
    \ imbalance, only\n   non-prioritized traffic will suffer as long as there is\
    \ a low\n   percentage of prioritized traffic.\n   If MPLS-TP LSPs are carried\
    \ within MPLS LSPs and ELI and EL are used,\n   requirement MP#3 is satisfied\
    \ (1) for uncongested links where load\n   balancing is not required, or (2) for\
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs using Traffic\n   Class (TC) and Diffserv, where the load rebalancing\
    \ implementation\n   rebalances only the less preferred traffic.  Load rebalance\
    \ is\n   generally needed only when congestion occurs; therefore, restricting\n\
    \   MPLS-TP to be carried over MPLS LSPs that are known to traverse only\n   links\
    \ that are expected to be uncongested can satisfy requirement\n   MP#3.\n   An\
    \ MPLS-TP LSP can be pinned to a Link Bundle component link if the\n   behavior\
    \ of requirement MP#2 is preferred.  An MPLS-TP LSP can be\n   assigned to a Link\
    \ Bundle but not pinned if the behavior of\n   requirement MP#3 is preferred.\
    \  In both of these cases, the MPLS-TP\n   LSP must be the top-level LSP, except\
    \ as noted above.\n   If MPLS-TP LSPs can be moved among component links, then\
    \ the Link\n   Bundle all-ones component link can be used or server-layer MPLS\
    \ LSPs\n   can be used with no restrictions on the server-layer MPLS use of\n\
    \   multipath, except that Entropy Labels must be supported along the\n   entire\
    \ path.  An Entropy Label must be used to ensure that all of the\n   MPLS-TP payload\
    \ and OAM traffic are carried on the same component,\n   except during very infrequent\
    \ transitions due to load balancing.\n   Since the Entropy Label Indicator and\
    \ Entropy Label are always placed\n   above the Generic Associated Channel Label\
    \ (GAL) in the stack, the\n   presence of a GAL will not affect the selection\
    \ of a component link\n   as long as the LSR does not hash on the label stack\
    \ entries below the\n   Entropy Label.\n   An MPLS-TP LSP may not traverse multipath\
    \ links on the path where\n   MPLS-TP forwarding requirements cannot be met. \
    \ Such links include\n   any using pre-[RFC6790] Ethernet Link Aggregation, pre-[RFC6790]\
    \ Link\n   Bundling using the all-ones component link, or any other form of\n\
    \   multipath that does not support termination of the entropy search at\n   the\
    \ EL as called for in [RFC6790].  An MPLS-TP LSP MUST NOT traverse\n   a server-layer\
    \ MPLS LSP that traverses any form of multipath that\n   does not support termination\
    \ of the entropy search at the EL.  For\n   this to occur, the MPLS-TP ingress\
    \ LSR MUST be aware of these links.\n   This is the reason for requirement MP#4.\n\
    \   Requirement MP#4 can be supported using administrative attributes.\n   Administrative\
    \ attributes are defined in [RFC3209].  Some\n   configuration is required to\
    \ support this.\n   In MPLS Link Bundling the requirement for bidirectional co-routing\n\
    \   can be interpreted as meaning that the same set of LSRs must be\n   traversed\
    \ or can be interpreted to mean that the same set of\n   component links must\
    \ be traversed [RFC4201] [RFC3473].  Following the\n   procedures of Section 3\
    \ of RFC 3473 where Link Bundling is used only\n   ensures that the same set of\
    \ LSRs are traversed and that acceptable\n   labels are created in each direction.\n\
    \   When an MPLS-TP LSP is set up over a MPLS LSP, if the MPLS-TP LSP is\n   a\
    \ bidirectional LSP, then providers who want to only set these MPLS-\n   TP LSPs\
    \ over bidirectional co-routed MPLS LSPs can make use of\n   administrative attributes\
    \ [RFC3209] to ensure that this occurs.  If\n   MPLS-TP LSPs are carried by unidirectional\
    \ MPLS LSPs, the MPLS-TP OAM\n   will be unaffected, as only the MPLS LSP endpoints\
    \ will appear as\n   MPLS-TP OAM Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points\
    \ (MIPs).\n   Two methods of adding an Entropy Label are described above.  The\n\
    \   MPLS-TP ingress must have a means to determine which links can\n   support\
    \ MPLS-TP in selecting a path (MP#4).  Administrative\n   attributes can satisfy\
    \ that requirement.  If the MPLS-TP LSR is\n   capable of adding ELI/EL to the\
    \ label stack, this method is\n   preferred.  However, equipment furthest from\
    \ a provider's network\n   core is the least likely to support RFC 6790 in the\
    \ near term.  For\n   portions of the topology where an MPLS-TP is carried within\
    \ a server-\n   layer MPLS LSP, the ingress of the server-layer MPLS LSP can add\
    \ ELI/\n   EL using a fixed EL value per client LSP, except those known not to\n\
    \   require MPLS-TP treatment.  There are numerous ways to determine\n   which\
    \ client LSPs are MPLS-TP LSPs and which are not.  While this\n   determination\
    \ is out of scope and will vary among deployments,\n   configuration or the presence\
    \ of specific attribute affinities in\n   RSVP-TE signaling are among the likely\
    \ means to do so.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  MPLS-TP as a Server Layer for MPLS\n   Carrying MPLS LSPs that are larger\
    \ than a component link over an\n   MPLS-TP server layer requires that the large\
    \ MPLS client-layer LSP be\n   accommodated by multiple MPLS-TP server-layer LSPs.\
    \  MPLS multipath\n   can be used in the client-layer MPLS.\n   Creating multiple\
    \ MPLS-TP server-layer LSPs places a greater Incoming\n   Label Map (ILM) scaling\
    \ burden on the LSR.  High-bandwidth MPLS cores\n   with a smaller amount of nodes\
    \ have the greatest tendency to require\n   LSPs in excess of component links;\
    \ therefore, the reduction in the\n   number of nodes offsets the impact of increasing\
    \ the number of\n   server-layer LSPs in parallel.  Today, only in cases where\
    \ deployed\n   LSR ILMs are small would this be an issue.\n   The most significant\
    \ disadvantage of MPLS-TP as a server layer for\n   MPLS is that the use of MPLS-TP\
    \ server-layer LSPs reduces the\n   efficiency of carrying the MPLS client layer.\
    \  The service that\n   provides by far the largest offered load in provider networks\
    \ is the\n   Internet, for which the LSP capacity reservations are predictions\
    \ of\n   expected load.  Many of these MPLS LSPs may be smaller than component\n\
    \   link capacity.  Using MPLS-TP as a server layer results in bin-\n   packing\
    \ problems for these smaller LSPs.  For those LSPs that are\n   larger than component\
    \ link capacity, the LSP capacities need not be\n   (and often are not) integer\
    \ multiples of convenient capacity\n   increments such as 10 Gbit/s.  Using MPLS-TP\
    \ as an underlying server\n   layer greatly reduces the ability of the client-layer\
    \ MPLS LSPs to\n   share capacity.  For example, when one MPLS LSP is underutilizing\
    \ its\n   predicted capacity, the fixed allocation of MPLS-TP to component\n \
    \  links may not allow another LSP to exceed its predicted capacity.\n   Using\
    \ MPLS-TP as a server layer may result in less efficient use of\n   resources\
    \ and may result in a less cost-effective network.\n   No additional requirements\
    \ beyond MPLS-TP as it is now currently\n   defined are required to support MPLS-TP\
    \ as a server layer for MPLS.\n   It is therefore viable but has some undesirable\
    \ characteristics\n   discussed above.\n"
- title: 5.  Summary
  contents:
  - "5.  Summary\n   MPLS equipment deployed in the core currently supports multipath.\n\
    \   For large service providers, core LSR must support some form of\n   multipath\
    \ to be deployable.  Deployed MPLS access and edge equipment\n   is often oblivious\
    \ to the use of multipath in the core.  It is\n   expected that at least first-generation\
    \ MPLS-TP equipment will be\n   oblivious to the use of multipath in the core.\
    \  This first-generation\n   MPLS-TP equipment is deployable in a core using multipath,\
    \ with no\n   adverse impact to RSVP-TE signaling, if:\n   1.  the edge equipment\
    \ can support administrative attributes (RFC\n       3209),\n   2.  the core equipment\
    \ can support ELI/EL, and\n   3.  the core equipment can put a per-LSP fixed EL\
    \ value on any LSP\n       that indicates a particular attribute affinity or can\
    \ identify a\n       client MPLS-TP LSP through some other means.\n   There are\
    \ no issues carrying MPLS over MPLS-TP, except when the MPLS\n   LSP is too big\
    \ to be carried by a single MPLS-TP LSP.  Most MPLS core\n   equipment and some\
    \ edge equipment can configure an MPLS Link Bundle\n   [RFC4201] over multiple\
    \ component links where the component links are\n   themselves MPLS LSP.  This\
    \ existing capability can be used to carry\n   large MPLS LSPs and overcome the\
    \ limited capacity of any single\n   server-layer MPLS-TP LSP.\n   MPLS OAM and\
    \ MPLS-TP OAM are unaffected in the following cases\n   proposed in this document:\n\
    \   1.  Where MPLS is carried over a single MPLS-TP, all traffic flows on\n  \
    \     one link, MPLS OAM is unaffected and need not use multipath\n       support\
    \ in LSP Ping [RFC4379].\n   2.  Where MPLS-TP is carried over MPLS, all traffic\
    \ for that MPLS-TP\n       LSP is carried over one link thanks to the fixed EL\
    \ value.  In\n       this case, MPLS-TP OAM is unaffected.\n   3.  Where MPLS\
    \ LSPs are carried over MPLS LSPs (an existing case) or\n       over multiple\
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs, the multipath support in LSP Ping is\n       used and LSP Ping\
    \ operation is unaffected [RFC4379] [RFC6425].\n"
