- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo documents the fundamental truths of networking for the\n\
    \   Internet community. This memo does not specify a standard, except in\n   the\
    \ sense that all standards must implicitly follow the fundamental\n   truths.\n"
- title: Acknowledgements
  contents:
  - "Acknowledgements\n   The truths described in this memo result from extensive\
    \ study over an\n   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not\
    \ intend\n   to contribute to this work. The editor merely has collected these\n\
    \   truths, and would like to thank the networking community for\n   originally\
    \ illuminating these truths.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about\
    \ the\n   fundamental truths underlying all networking. These truths apply to\n\
    \   networking in general, and are not limited to TCP/IP, the Internet,\n   or\
    \ any other subset of the networking community.\n"

  - "2. The Fundamental Truths\n   (1)  It Has To Work.\n   (2)  No matter how hard\
    \ you push and no matter what the priority,\n        you can't increase the speed\
    \ of light.\n        (2a) (corollary). No matter how hard you try, you can't make\
    \ a\n             baby in much less than 9 months. Trying to speed this up\n \
    \            *might* make it slower, but it won't make it happen any\n       \
    \      quicker.\n   (3)  With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However,\
    \ this is\n        not necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they\n\
    \        are going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them\n   \
    \     as they fly overhead.\n   (4)  Some things in life can never be fully appreciated\
    \ nor\n        understood unless experienced firsthand. Some things in\n     \
    \   networking can never be fully understood by someone who neither\n        builds\
    \ commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational\n        network.\n\
    \   (5)  It is always possible to aglutenate multiple separate problems\n    \
    \    into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases\n        this\
    \ is a bad idea.\n   (6)  It is easier to move a problem around (for example,\
    \ by moving\n        the problem to a different part of the overall network\n\
    \        architecture) than it is to solve it.\n        (6a) (corollary). It is\
    \ always possible to add another level of\n             indirection.\n   (7) \
    \ It is always something\n        (7a) (corollary). Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any\
    \ two (you can't\n            have all three).\n   (8)  It is more complicated\
    \ than you think.\n   (9)  For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.\n\
    \       (9a) (corollary) Every networking problem always takes longer to\n   \
    \         solve than it seems like it should.\n   (10) One size never fits all.\n\
    \   (11) Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and\n   \
    \     a different presentation, regardless of whether it works.\n        (11a)\
    \ (corollary). See rule 6a.\n   (12) In protocol design, perfection has been reached\
    \ not when there\n        is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left\
    \ to take\n        away.\n"
