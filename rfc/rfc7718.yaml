  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the registries for OWAMP -- the One-Way Active\n\
    \   Measurement Protocol.  The registries allow assignment of Mode bit\n   positions\
    \ and OWAMP Command numbers.  Per this memo, IANA has\n   established the registries\
    \ for new features, called the OWAMP-Modes\n   registry and the OWAMP Control\
    \ Command Number registry.  This memo\n   updates RFC 4656.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656]\
    \ was\n   prepared to support measurements of metrics specified by the IP\n  \
    \ Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group in the IETF.  The Two-Way\n   Active\
    \ Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] is an extension of\n   OWAMP.  The TWAMP\
    \ specification gathered wide review as it approached\n   completion, and the\
    \ by-products were several recommendations for new\n   features in TWAMP.  As\
    \ a result, a registry of new features was\n   established for TWAMP.  However,\
    \ there were no new features proposed\n   for OWAMP until recently [RFC7717].\n\
    \   This memo establishes the needed registries for OWAMP and updates\n   [RFC4656].\n"

    \ the future.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Registry Management
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Registry Management\n   Because the \"OWAMP-Modes\" are based on only\
    \ 32 bit positions with\n   each position conveying a unique feature, and because\
    \ OWAMP is an\n   IETF protocol, these registries MUST be updated only by \"IETF\
    \ Review\"\n   as specified in [RFC5226] (an RFC that documents registry use and\

    \ that is reconciled in\n   [RFC7717]).\n   An extension of the OWAMP-Modes is\

    \   5-31   Unassigned\n   In the original OWAMP Modes field, setting bit position\
    \ 0, 1, or 2\n   indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the\
    \ Test\n   protocol inherited the same mode (see Section 4 of [RFC4656]).\n  \
    \ The value of the Modes field sent by the Server in the Server-\n   Greeting\
    \ message is the bit-wise OR of the modes (bit positions) that\n   it is willing\
    \ to support during this session.  Thus, the five least\n   significant bits of\
    \ the 32-bit Modes field are used.  When no other\n   features are activated,\
    \ the 27 most significant bits MUST be zero.  A\n   Control-Client conforming\
    \ to [RFC4656] MAY ignore the values in the\n   29 most significant bits of the\
    \ Modes field, or it MAY support\n   features that are communicated in other bit\
    \ positions, such as the\n   IKEv2-derived Shared Secret Key extension [RFC7717].\n\
    \   OWAMP and TWAMP registries for Modes may grow to contain different\n   features\
    \ and functions due to the inherent differences in one-way and\n   two-way measurement\
    \ configurations and the metrics they measure.  No\n   attempt will be made to\
    \ coordinate them unnecessarily, except for the\n   Reserved bit position 3 above.\
    \  This is available for assignment if a\n   mixed security mode similar to [RFC5618]\
    \ is defined for OWAMP; it\n   would allow alignment with the comparable TWAMP\
    \ feature.\n"
