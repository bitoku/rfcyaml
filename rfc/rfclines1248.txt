This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing OSPF Version 2.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213, defines MIB II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 5 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].
Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of the these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of these is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The new data types are AreaID, RouterID, TOSType, Metric, BigMetric, TruthValue, Status, Validation, PositiveInteger, HelloRange, UpToMaxAge, InterfaceIndex, and DesignatedRouterPriority.
The MIB is composed of the following sections:
General Variables Area Data Structure Area Stub Metric Table Link State Database Address Range Table Host Table Interface Table Interface Metric Table Virtual Interface Table Neighbor Table Virtual Neighbor Table 4.2.1.
The General Variables are about what they sound like; variables which are global to the OSPF Process.
Area Data Structure and Area Stub Metric Table
The Area Data Structure describes the OSPF Areas that the router participates in.
The Area Stub Metric Table describes the metrics advertised into a stub area by the default router(s).
The Link State Database is provided primarily to provide detailed information for network debugging.
Address Table and Host Tables
The Address Range Table and Host Table are provided to view configured Network Summary and Host Route information.
The Interface Table and the Interface Metric Table together describe the various IP interfaces to OSPF.
The metrics are placed in separate tables in order to simplify dealing with multiple types of service, and to provide flexibility in the event that the IP TOS definition is changed in the future.
A Default Value specification is supplied for the TOS 0 (default)
Likewise, the Virtual Interface Table describe virtual links to the OSPF Process.
The Neighbor Table and the Virtual Neighbor Table describe the neighbors to the OSPF Process.
Conceptual Row Creation For the benefit of row creation in "conceptual" (see [9])
tables, DEFVAL (Default Value) clauses are included in the definitions in section 5, suggesting values which an agent should use for instances of variables which need to be created due to a Set Request, but which are not specified in the Set  Request.
DEFVAL clauses have not been specified for some objects which are read only, implying that they are zeroed upon row creation.
These objects are of the SYNTAX Counter or Gauge.
For those objects not having a DEFVAL clause, both management stations and agents should heed the Robustness Principle of the Internet (see RFC 791): "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send" That is, management stations should include as many of these columnar objects as possible (e.g., all read write objects) in a Set Request when creating a conceptual row; agents should accept a Set Request with as few of these as they need (e.g., the minimum contents of a row creating SET consists of those objects for which, as they cannot be intuited, no default is specified.).
There are numerous read write objects in this MIB, as it is designed for SNMP management of the protocol, not just SNMP monitoring of its state.
However, in the absence of a standard SNMP Security architecture, it is acceptable for implementations to implement these as read only with an alternative interface for their modification.
Default Configuration OSPF is a powerful routing protocol, equipped with features to handle virtually any configuration requirement that might reasonably be found within an Autonomous System.
With this power comes a fair degree of complexity, which the sheer number of objects in the MIB will attest to.
Care has therefore been taken, in constructing this MIB, to define default values for virtually every object, to minimize the amount of parameterization required in the typical case.
That default configuration is as follows:
Given the following assumptions: IP has already been configured The ifTable has already been configured
ifSpeed is estimated by the interface drivers
The OSPF Process automatically discovers all IP Interfaces and creates corresponding OSPF Interfaces
The TOS 0 metrics are autonomously derived from ifSpeed
The OSPF Process automatically creates the Areas required for the Interfaces The simplest configuration of an OSPF process requires that: The OSPF Process be Enabled.
This can be accomplished with a single SET:
The configured system will have the following attributes: The RouterID will be one of the IP addresses of the device
The device will be neither an Area Border Router nor an Autonomous System Border Router.
Every IP Interface, with or without an address, will be an OSPF Interface.
The AreaID of each interface will be 0.0.0.0, the Backbone.
Authentication will be disabled All Broadcast and Point to Point interfaces will be operational.
NBMA Interfaces require the configuration of at least one neighbor.
Timers on all direct interfaces will be: Hello Interval:
no direct links to hosts will be configured.
no addresses will be summarized Metrics, being a measure of bit duration, are unambiguous and intelligent.
No Virtual Links will be configured.
