    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC

    in T1E1, European Telecommunications Standards Institute\n   (ETSI), and International

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such objects
    may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n
    \  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection
    can have a negative effect on network operations.  These\n   are the tables and
    objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable\n
    \     vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandInUse,\n      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTransmitPSDLevel,\n
    \     vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandSymbolRate,\n      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandConstellationSize,\n
    \     vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandCenterFrequency,\n      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandRowStatus\n
    \  VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber to\n   manipulate
    both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded\n   operations channel (EOC)
    for their own loop.  For example, unchecked\n   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated
    by the subscriber could generate\n   sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm
    either the\n   management interface to the network or the element manager.\n   Additionally,
    allowing write access to configuration data may allow\n   an end-user to increase
    their service levels or affect other end-\n   users in either a positive or negative
    manner.  For this reason, the\n   tables and objects listed above should be considered
    to contain\n   sensitive information.\n   Some of the readable objects in this
    MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may
    be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is
    thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and
    possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n
    \  the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \     vdslLineSCMPhysBandInUse,\n      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrPSDLevel,\n      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSymbolRate,\n
    \     vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrConstellationSize,\n      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrCenterFrequency,\n
    \     vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSnrMgn,\n      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrAtn\n   Read
    access of the physical band parameters may provide knowledge to\n   an end-user
    that would allow malicious behavior, for example the\n   application of an intentional
    interference on one or all of the\n   physical bands in use.\n   SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself
    is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as
    to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of a MIB module is properly configured to give access to the\n   objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights\n   to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
