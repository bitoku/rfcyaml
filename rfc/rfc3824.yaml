  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that\
    \ uses DNS\n   (Domain Name Service, RFC 1034 [4]) in order to translate certain\n\
    \   telephone numbers, like '+12025332600', into URIs (Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers,\
    \ RFC 2396 [9]), like 'sip:user@sipcarrier.com'.  ENUM\n   exists primarily to\
    \ facilitate the interconnection of systems that\n   rely on telephone numbers\
    \ with those that use URIs to route\n   transactions.  E.164 [10] is the ITU-T\
    \ standard international\n   numbering plan, under which all globally-reachable\
    \ telephone numbers\n   are organized.\n   SIP (Session Initiation Protocol, RFC\
    \ 3261 [2]) is a text-based\n   application protocol that allows two endpoints\
    \ in the Internet to\n   discover one another in order to exchange context information\
    \ about a\n   session they would like to share.  Common applications for SIP\n\
    \   include Internet telephony, instant messaging, video, Internet\n   gaming,\
    \ and other forms of real-time communications.  SIP is a\n   multi-service protocol\
    \ capable of initiating sessions involving\n   different forms of real-time communications\
    \ simultaneously.\n   The most widespread application for SIP today is Voice-over-IP\n\
    \   (VoIP).  As such, there are a number of cases in which SIP\n   applications\
    \ are forced to contend with telephone numbers.\n   Unfortunately, telephone numbers\
    \ cannot be routing in accordance with\n   the traditional DNS resolution procedures\
    \ standardized for SIP (see\n   [14]), which rely on SIP URIs.  ENUM provides\
    \ a method for\n   translating E.164 numbers into URIs, including potentially\
    \ SIP URIs.\n   This document therefore provides an account of how SIP can handle\n\
    \   telephone numbers by making use of ENUM.  Guidelines are proposed for\n  \
    \ the authoring of the DNS records used by ENUM, and for client-side\n   processing\
    \ once these DNS records have been received.\n   The guidelines in this document\
    \ are oriented towards authoring and\n   processing ENUM records specifically\
    \ for SIP applications.  These\n   guidelines assume that the reader is familiar\
    \ with Naming Authority\n   Pointer (NAPTR) records (RFC 3403 [6]) and ENUM (RFC\
    \ 3761 [1]).  Only\n   those aspects of NAPTR record authoring and processing\
    \ that have\n   special bearing on SIP, or that require general clarification,\
    \ are\n   covered in this document; these procedures do not update or override\n\
    \   the NAPTR or ENUM core documents.\n   Note that the ENUM specification has\
    \ undergone a revision shortly\n   before the publication of this document, driven\
    \ by the update of the\n   NAPTR system described in RFC 2915 [12] to the Dynamic\
    \ Delegation\n   Discovery System (DDDS) family of specifications (including RFC\n\
    \   3403).  This document therefore provides some guidance for handling\n   records\
    \ designed for the original RFC 2916 [16].\n   The remainder of this document\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 3\n   suggests general behavior for SIP user\
    \ agents that encounter\n   telephone numbers; Section 4 provides an overview\
    \ of the intersection\n   of SIP and ENUM; proposed normative guidelines for ENUM\
    \ record\n   authoring and processing in the context of SIP are described in\n\
    \   Section 5, and Section 6 respectively; some considerations relevant\n   to\
    \ the revision of RFC 2916 are given in Section 7.\n"

- title: 3.  Handling Telephone Numbers in SIP
  contents:
  - "3.  Handling Telephone Numbers in SIP\n   There are a number of reasons why a\
    \ user might want to initiate a SIP\n   request that targets an E.164 number.\
    \  One common reason is that the\n   user is calling from the PSTN through a PSTN-SIP\
    \ gateway; such\n   gateways usually map routing information from the PSTN directly\
    \ on to\n   SIP signaling.  Or a native SIP user might intentionally initiate\
    \ a\n   session addressed to an E.164 number - perhaps because the target\n  \
    \ user is canonically known by that number, or the originator's SIP\n   user agent\
    \ only supports a traditional numeric telephone keypad.  A\n   request initially\
    \ targeting a conventional SIP URI might also be\n   redirected to an E.164 number.\
    \  In most cases, these are requests for\n   a telephony session (voice communication),\
    \ though numerous other\n   services are also reached through telephone numbers\
    \ (including\n   instant messaging services).\n   Unlike a URI, a telephone number\
    \ does not contain a host name, or any\n   hints as to where one might deliver\
    \ a request targeting a telephone\n   number on the Internet.  While SIP user\
    \ agents or proxy servers could\n   be statically provisioned with a mapping of\
    \ destinations\n   corresponding to particular telephone numbers or telephone\
    \ number\n   ranges, considering the size and complexity of a complete mapping,\
    \ it\n   would be preferable for SIP user agents to be able to query as needed\n\
    \   for a destination appropriate for a particular telephone number.\n   In such\
    \ cases a user agent might use ENUM to discover a URI\n   associated with the\
    \ E.164 number - including a SIP URI.  URIs\n   discovered through ENUM can then\
    \ be used normally to route SIP\n   requests to their destination.  Note that\
    \ support for the NAPTR DNS\n   resource record format is specified for ordinary\
    \ SIP URI processing\n   in [14], and thus support for ENUM is not a significant\
    \ departure\n   from baseline SIP DNS routing.\n   Most of the remainder of this\
    \ document provides procedures for the\n   use of ENUM, but a few guidelines are\
    \ given in the remainder of this\n   section for cases in which ENUM is not used,\
    \ for whatever reason.\n   If a user agent is unable to translate an E.164 number\
    \ with ENUM, it\n   can create a type of SIP Request-URI that contains a telephone\n\
    \   number.  Since one of the most common applications of SIP is\n   telephony,\
    \ a great deal of attention has already been devoted to the\n   representation\
    \ of telephone numbers in SIP.  In particular, the tel\n   URL RFC 2806 [8] has\
    \ been identified as a way of carrying telephone\n   routing information within\
    \ SIP.  A tel URL usually consists of the\n   number in E.164 format preceded\
    \ by a plus sign, e.g.,:\n   tel:+12025332600.  This format is so useful that\
    \ it has been\n   incorporated into the baseline SIP specification; the user portion\
    \ of\n   a SIP URI can contain a tel URL (without the scheme string, like\n  \
    \ sip:+12025332600@carrier.com;user=phone).  A SIP proxy server might\n   therefore\
    \ receive a request from a user agent with a tel URL in the\n   Request-URI; one\
    \ way in which the proxy server could handle this sort\n   of request is by launching\
    \ an ENUM query itself, and proxying the SIP\n   request in accordance with the\
    \ returned ENUM records.\n   In the absence of support for ENUM, or if ENUM requests\
    \ return no\n   records corresponding to a telephone number, local policy can\
    \ be used\n   to determine how to forward SIP requests with an E.164 number in\
    \ the\n   Request-URI.  Frequently, such calls are routed to gateways that\n \
    \  interconnect SIP networks with the PSTN.  These proxy server policies\n   might\
    \ be provisioned dynamically with routing information for\n   telephone numbers\
    \ by TRIP [15].  As a matter of precedence, SIP user\n   agents should attempt\
    \ to translate telephone numbers to URIs with\n   ENUM, if implemented, before\
    \ creating a tel URL, and deferring the\n   routing of this request to a SIP proxy\
    \ server.\n"
- title: 4.  Design Principles
  contents:
  - "4.  Design Principles\n   Although the applicability of ENUM to SIP has always\
    \ been clear, the\n   exact way in which the two should cooperate has been a subject\
    \ of\n   some controversy.  How many SIP URIs should appear in ENUM, what kind\n\
    \   of URIs they are, whether or not the \"service\" field of NAPTR records\n\
    \   should contain capability information - numerous questions have\n   arisen\
    \ around the authoring, and interpretation of ENUM records for\n   SIP consumers.\
    \  The following, then, is a statement of the particular\n   philosophy that has\
    \ motivated the recommendations in this document:\n      Address-of-record SIP\
    \ URIs appear in ENUM, not contact address\n      URIs.  Roughly speaking, an\
    \ address-of-record is the canonical\n      identity of a SIP user - it usually\
    \ appears in the From field of\n      SIP requests sent by that user; a contact\
    \ address is the URI of a\n      device.  The process of registration in SIP (using\
    \ the REGISTER\n      method), for example, temporarily binds the contact address\
    \ of a\n      device to the address-of-record of a user.  A DNS record has a\n\
    \      long time-to-live when compared with the timeframe of SIP\n      registrations.\
    \  The availability of an address-of-record also\n      transcends the availability\
    \ of any single device.  ENUM is more\n      suitable for representing an long-term\
    \ identity than the URI of\n      any device with which a user is temporarily\
    \ associated.  If ENUM\n      were purposed to map to specific devices, it would\
    \ be better to\n      translate telephone numbers to IPv4 addresses than to URIs\
    \ (which\n      express something richer).\n      SIP URIs in ENUM do not convey\
    \ capability information.  SIP has\n      its own methods for negotiating capability\
    \ information between\n      user agents (see SDP [13], the use of Require/Supported\
    \ to\n      negotiate extensions in RFC 3261, and callee capabilities [11]);\n\
    \      providing more limited capability information within ENUM is at\n     \
    \ best redundant and at worst potentially misleading to SIP's\n      negotiation\
    \ system.  Also, addresses-of-record do not have\n      capabilities (only devices\
    \ registered under an address-of-record\n      have actual capabilities), and\
    \ putting contact addresses in ENUM\n      is not recommended.\n      Only one\
    \ SIP URI, ideally, appears in an ENUM record set for a\n      telephone number.\
    \  While it may initially seem attractive to\n      provide multiple SIP URIs\
    \ that reach the same user within ENUM, if\n      there are multiple addresses\
    \ at which a user can be contacted,\n      considerably greater flexibility is\
    \ afforded if multiple URIs are\n      managed by a SIP location service that\
    \ is identified by a single\n      record in ENUM.  Behavior for parallel and\
    \ sequential forking in\n      SIP, for example, is better managed in SIP than\
    \ in a set of ENUM\n      records.\n      User agents, rather than proxy servers,\
    \ should process ENUM\n      records.  The assumptions underlying the processing\
    \ of NAPTR\n      records dictate that the ENUM client knows the set of enumservices\n\
    \      supported by the entity that is attempting to communicate.  A SIP\n   \
    \   proxy server is unlikely to know the enumservices supported by the\n     \
    \ originator of a SIP request.\n"
- title: 5.  Authoring NAPTR Records for SIP
  contents:
  - "5.  Authoring NAPTR Records for SIP\n   This document makes no assumptions about\
    \ who authors NAPTR records\n   (service providers or end users), nor about any\
    \ mechanisms by which a\n   record, once it is authored, may be uploaded to the\
    \ appropriate DNS\n   servers.  Authorship in the context of this document concerns\
    \ only\n   the processes by which the NAPTR records themselves are constructed.\n\
    \   There are a few general guidelines which are applicable to the\n   authoring\
    \ of DNS records that should be considered by the authors of\n   ENUM NAPTR record\
    \ sets.  The most important is that authors SHOULD\n   keep record sets relatively\
    \ small - DNS is not optimized for the\n   transference of large files.  Having\
    \ five or six NAPTR records is\n   quite reasonable, but policies that encourage\
    \ records sets of\n   hundreds of NAPTR records are not appropriate.  Also, DNS\
    \ records are\n   relatively permanent; authors SHOULD NOT use ENUM NAPTR records\
    \ to\n   express relationships between E.164 numbers and URIs that potentially\n\
    \   exist for only a short time.  DNS is most scalable when it can assume\n  \
    \ records will be valid for a reasonable length of time (at least\n   several\
    \ hours).\n"
- title: 5.1.  The Service Field
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Service Field\n   The Service field of a NAPTR record (per RFC 3403)\
    \ contains a string\n   token that designates the protocol or service associated\
    \ with a\n   particular record (and which imparts some inkling of the sort of\
    \ URI\n   that will result from the use of the record).  ENUM [1] requires the\n\
    \   IANA registration of service fields known as \"enumservices\".\n   An enumservice\
    \ for SIP has been developed in the ENUM working group\n   (see [7]) which uses\
    \ the format 'E2U+sip' to designate that a SIP\n   address-of-record appears in\
    \ the URI field of a NAPTR record.  It is\n   strongly RECOMMENDED that authors\
    \ of NAPTR records use the 'E2U+sip'\n   service field whenever the regexp contains\
    \ a SIP address-of-record\n   URI.\n"
- title: '5.2.  Creating the Regular Expression: Matching'
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Creating the Regular Expression: Matching\n   The authorship of the regular\
    \ expression (henceforth regexp) in a\n   NAPTR record intended for use by ENUM\
    \ is vastly simplified by the\n   absence of an antecedent in the substitution\
    \ (i.e., the section\n   between the first two delimiters).  It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that\n   implementations use an exclamation point as a delimiter, since this\n\
    \   is the only delimiter used throughout the ENUM core specification.\n   When\
    \ a NAPTR record is processed, the expression in the antecedent is\n   matched\
    \ against the starting string (for ENUM, the telephone number)\n   to assist in\
    \ locating the proper record in a set; however, in ENUM\n   applications, since\
    \ the desired record set is located through a\n   reverse resolution in the e164.arpa\
    \ domain that is based on the\n   starting string, further analysis of the starting\
    \ string on the\n   client side will usually be unnecessary.  In such cases, the\n\
    \   antecedent of the regular expression is commonly 'greedy' - it uses\n   the\
    \ regexp '^.*$', which matches any starting string.  Some authors\n   of ENUM\
    \ record sets may want to use the full power of regexps, and\n   create non-greedy\
    \ antecedents; the DDDS standard requires that ENUM\n   resolvers support these\
    \ regexps when they are present.  For providing\n   a trivial mapping from a telephone\
    \ number to a SIP URI, the use of a\n   greedy regexp usually suffices.\n   Example:\
    \ \"!^.*$!sip:user@example.com!\"\n   Note that when the antecedent of the regexp\
    \ is greedy, this does not\n   mean that the replacement field in NAPTR records\
    \ provides a viable\n   alternative to authoring with a regexp.  Authors of NAPTR\
    \ records for\n   ENUM MUST NOT use the replacement field in records with an 'E2U+sip'\n\
    \   service field.\n"
- title: '5.3.  Creating the Regular Expression: The URI'
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Creating the Regular Expression: The URI\n   The consequent side of a regexp\
    \ contains a URI; NAPTR records that\n   are intended to be used for session initiation\
    \ (including SIP\n   telephony) SHOULD use a SIP URI.  While this may not sound\
    \ especially\n   controversial at first hearing, there are other sorts of URIs\
    \ that\n   might be considered appropriate for SIP applications: 'tel' URIs,\n\
    \   'im' or 'pres' URIs, or others that describe specific services that\n   might\
    \ be invoked through SIP are all potentially candidates.  While\n   the use of\
    \ these URIs might seem reasonable under some circumstances,\n   including these\
    \ in NAPTR records rather than SIP URIs could weaken\n   the proper composition\
    \ of services and negotiation of capabilities in\n   SIP.\n   It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that authors of ENUM records should always use the\n   SIP or SIPS URI scheme\
    \ when the service field is 'E2U+sip', and the\n   URIs in question MUST be addresses-of-record,\
    \ not contact addresses.\n   Users of SIP can register one or more contact addresses\
    \ with a SIP\n   registrar that will be consulted by the proxy infrastructure\
    \ of an\n   administrative domain to contact the end user when requests are\n\
    \   received for their address-of-record.  Much of the benefit of using a\n  \
    \ URI comes from the fact that it represents a logical service\n   associated\
    \ with a user rather than a device - indeed, if ENUM needs\n   to target specific\
    \ devices rather than URIs, then a hypothetical\n   'E2IPv4+sip' enumservice would\
    \ be more appropriate.\n"

    \ these preferences.  Alternatively, the redirect\n   server MAY select a single\
    \ record in accordance with the NAPTR\n   preference fields (or randomly when\
    \ no preference is specified) and\n   send this resulting URI in a Contact header\
    \ field in a 3xx response.\n   Otherwise, if the ENUM client is a SIP intermediary\
    \ that can act as a\n   proxy server, then it MAY fork the request when it receives\
    \ multiple\n   appropriate NAPTR records in an ENUM record set.  Depending on\
    \ the\n   relative precedence values of the NAPTR records the proxy may wish to\n\
    \   fork sequentially or in parallel.  However, the proxy MUST build a\n   route\
    \ set from these NAPTR records that consists exclusively of SIP\n   or SIPS URIs,\
    \ not other URI schemes.  Alternatively, the proxy server\n   MAY select a single\
    \ record in accordance with the NAPTR preference\n   fields (or randomly when\
    \ no preference is specified, or in accordance\n   with local policy) and proxy\
    \ the request with a Request-URI\n   corresponding to the URI field of this NAPTR\
    \ record - though again,\n   it MUST select a record that contains a SIP or SIPS\
    \ URI.  Note that\n   there are significant limitations that arise if a proxy\
    \ server\n   processes ENUM record sets instead of a user agent, and that\n  \
    \ therefore it is RECOMMENDED that SIP network elements act as redirect\n   servers\
    \ rather than proxy servers after performing an ENUM query.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Processing the Selected NAPTR Record
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Processing the Selected NAPTR Record\n   Obviously, when an appropriate\
    \ NAPTR record has been selected, the\n   URI should be extracted from the regexp\
    \ field.  The URI is between\n   the second and third exclamation points in the\
    \ string.  Once a URI\n   has been extracted from the NAPTR record, it SHOULD\
    \ be used as the\n   Request-URI of the SIP request for which the ENUM query was\
    \ launched.\n   SIP clients should perform some sanity checks on the URI, primarily\n\
    \   to ensure that they support the scheme of the URI, but also to verify\n  \
    \ that the URI is well-formed.  Clients MUST at least verify that the\n   Request-URI\
    \ does not target themselves.\n   Once an address-of-record has been extracted\
    \ from the selected NAPTR\n   record, clients follow the standard SIP mechanisms\
    \ (see [14]) for\n   determining how to forward the request.  This may involve\
    \ launching\n   subsequent NAPTR or SRV queries in order to determine how best\
    \ to\n   route to the domain identified by an address-of-record; clients\n   however\
    \ MUST NOT make the same ENUM query recursively (if the URI\n   returned by ENUM\
    \ is or contains a tel URL, see [8]).\n   Note that SIP requests based on the\
    \ use of NAPTR records may fail for\n   any number of reasons.  If there are multiple\
    \ NAPTR records relevant\n   to SIP present in an ENUM record set, then after\
    \ a failure has\n   occurred on an initial attempt with one NAPTR record, SIP\
    \ user agents\n   MAY try their request again with a different NAPTR record from\
    \ the\n   ENUM record set.\n"
- title: 7.  Compatibility with RFC 2916
  contents:
  - "7.  Compatibility with RFC 2916\n   The ENUM specification is currently undergoing\
    \ a revision in the ENUM\n   WG.  The new specification, RFC 3761 [1], is based\
    \ on the Dynamic\n   Delegation Discovery System [5] revision to the NAPTR resource\
    \ record\n   specified in RFC 2915 [12].  For the most part, DDDS is an\n   organizational\
    \ revision that makes the algorithmic aspects of record\n   processing separable\
    \ from any underlying database format (such as the\n   NAPTR DNS resource record).\n\
    \   The most important revision in RFC 3761 is the concept of\n   enumservices.\
    \  The original ENUM specification, RFC 2916, specified a\n   number of \"service\"\
    \ values that could be used for ENUM, including the\n   \"sip+E2U\" service field.\
    \  RFC 3761 introduces an IANA registration\n   system with new guidelines for\
    \ the registration of enumservices,\n   which are no longer necessarily divided\
    \ into discreet \"service\" and\n   \"protocol\" fields, and which admit of more\
    \ complex structures.  In\n   order to differentiate enumservices in RFC 3761\
    \ from those in RFC\n   2916, the string \"E2U\" is the leading element in an\
    \ enumservice\n   field, whereas by RFC 2916 it was the trailing element.\n  \
    \ An enumservice for SIP addresses-of-record is described in [7].  This\n   enumservice\
    \ uses the enumservice field \"E2U+sip\".  RFC 3761-compliant\n   authors of ENUM\
    \ records for SIP MUST therefore use the \"E2U+sip\"\n   enumservice field instead\
    \ of the \"sip+E2U\" field.  For backwards\n   compatibility with existing legacy\
    \ records, however, the 'sip+E2U'\n   field SHOULD be supported by an ENUM client\
    \ that support SIP.\n   Also note that the terminology of DDDS differs in a number\
    \ of\n   respects from the initial NAPTR terminology in RFC 2916.  DDDS\n   introduces\
    \ the concept of an Application, an Application Specific\n   String, a First Well\
    \ Known Rule, and so on.  The terminology used in\n   this document is a little\
    \ looser (it refers to a 'starting string',\n   for example, where 'Application\
    \ Specific String' would be used for\n   DDDS).  The new terminology is reflected\
    \ in RFC 3761.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   DNS does not make policy decisions about the\
    \ records that it shares\n   with an inquirer.  All DNS records must be assumed\
    \ to be available to\n   all inquirers at all times.  The information provided\
    \ within an ENUM\n   record set must therefore be considered to be open to the\
    \ public -\n   which is a cause for some privacy considerations.\n   Ordinarily,\
    \ when you give someone your telephone number, you don't\n   expect that they\
    \ will be able to trivially determine your full name\n   and place of employment.\
    \  If, however, you create a NAPTR record for\n   use with ENUM that maps your\
    \ telephone number to a SIP URI like\n   'julia.roberts@example.com', expect to\
    \ get a lot of calls from\n   excited fans.\n   Unlike a traditional telephone\
    \ number, the target of a SIP URI may\n   require that callers provide cryptographic\
    \ credentials for\n   authentication and authorization before a user is alerted.\
    \  In this\n   respect, ENUM in concert with SIP can actually provide far greater\n\
    \   protection from unwanted callers than the existing PSTN, despite the\n   public\
    \ availability of ENUM records.\n   Users of ENUM who are nevertheless uncomfortable\
    \ with revealing their\n   names may, since identities on the Internet are not\
    \ exactly at a\n   premium, publish a less revealing SIP URI, like\n   'sip:anonymous00045@example.com'\
    \ or even\n   'sip:anonymous00045@anonymous-redirector.example.org', which could\
    \ in\n   turn point to their internal URI.\n   An analysis of threats specific\
    \ to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS,\n   and the applicability of DNSSEC [18]\
    \ to these, is provided in [1].\n"
