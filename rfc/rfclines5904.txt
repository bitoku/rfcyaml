Abstract This document defines a set of Remote Authentication Dial
In User Service (RADIUS) Attributes that are designed to provide RADIUS support for IEEE 802.16 Privacy Key Management Version 1.
Introduction Privacy Key Management Version 1
[IEEE.802.16 2004] is a public key based authentication and key establishment protocol typically used in fixed wireless broadband network deployments.
The protocol utilizes X.509 v3 certificates [RFC2459], RSA encryption [RFC2437], and a variety of secret key cryptographic methods to allow an 802.16 Base Station (BS) to authenticate a Subscriber Station (SS) and perform key establishment and maintenance between an SS and BS.
This document defines a set of RADIUS Attributes that are designed to provide support for PKMv1.
The target audience for this document consists of those developers implementing RADIUS support for PKMv1; therefore, familiarity with both RADIUS [RFC2865] and the IEEE 802.16 2004 standard is assumed.
Please note that this document relies on IEEE.802.16 2004, which references RFC 2437 and RFC 2459, rather than any more recent RFCs on RSA and X.509 certificates (e.g., RFC 3447 and RFC 5280).
Acronyms CA Certification Authority; a trusted party issuing and signing X.509 certificates.
For further information on the following terms, please see Section 7 of [IEEE.802.16 2004].

The following subsections describe the Attributes defined by this document.
This specification concerns the following values:
137 PKM SS Cert 138 PKM CA Cert 139 PKM Config Settings 140 PKM Cryptosuite List 141 PKM SAID 142 PKM SA Descriptor 143 PKM Auth Key 3.1.
The PKM SS Cert Attribute is variable length and MAY be transmitted in the Access Request message.
The Value field is of type string and contains the X.509 certificate [RFC2459] binding a public key to the identifier of the Subscriber Station.
The minimum size of an SS certificate exceeds the maximum size of a RADIUS attribute.
Therefore, the client MUST encapsulate the certificate in the Value fields of two or more instances of the PKM SS Cert Attribute, each (except possibly the last) having a length of 255 octets.
These multiple PKM SS Cert Attributes MUST appear consecutively and in order within the packet.
Upon receipt, the RADIUS server MUST recover the original certificate by concatenating the Value fields of the received PKM SS Cert Attributes in order.
A summary of the PKM SS Cert Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
Type 137 for PKM SS Cert Len > 2 Value
The Value field is variable length and contains a (possibly complete) portion of an X.509 certificate.
The PKM CA Cert Attribute is variable length and MAY be transmitted in the Access Request message.
The Value field is of type string and contains the X.509 certificate [RFC2459] used by the CA to sign the SS certificate carried in the PKM SS Cert attribute (Section 3.1) in the same message.
The minimum size of a CA certificate exceeds the maximum size of a RADIUS attribute.
Therefore, the client MUST encapsulate the certificate in the Value fields of two or more instances of the PKM CA Cert Attribute, each (except possibly the last) having a length of 255 octets.
These multiple PKM CA Cert Attributes MUST appear consecutively and in order within the packet.
Upon receipt, the RADIUS server MUST recover the original certificate by concatenating the Value fields of the received PKM CA Cert Attributes in order.
A summary of the PKM CA Cert Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
Type 138 for PKM CA Cert Len > 2 Value
The Value field is variable length and contains a (possibly complete) portion of an X.509 certificate.
The PKM Config Settings Attribute is of type string [RFC2865].
It is 30 octets in length and consists of seven independent fields, each of which is conceptually an unsigned integer.
Each of the fields contains a timeout value and corresponds to a Type Length  Value (TLV)
tuple encapsulated in the IEEE 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute; for details on the contents of each field, see Section 11.9.19 of [IEEE.802.16 2004].
One instance of the PKM Config Settings Attribute MAY be included in the Access Accept message.
A summary of the PKM Config Settings Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
Auth Rej Wait Timeout (cont.)
Type 139 for PKM Config Settings Len 30 Auth
The Auth Wait Timeout field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Authorize wait timeout" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The Reauth Wait Timeout field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Reauthorize wait timeout" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The Auth Grace Time field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Authorize grace time" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The Op Wait Timeout field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Operational wait timeout" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The Rekey Wait Timeout field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Rekey wait timeout" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The TEK Grace Time field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "TEK grace time" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The Auth Rej Wait Timeout field is 4 octets in length and corresponds to the "Authorize reject wait timeout" field of the 802.16 "PKM configuration settings" attribute.
The PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute is of type string [RFC2865] and is variable length; it corresponds roughly to the "Cryptographic  Suite List" 802.16 attribute (see Section 11.19.15 of [IEEE.802.16 2004]), the difference being that the RADIUS Attribute contains only the list of 3 octet cryptographic suite identifiers, omitting the IEEE Type and Length fields.
The PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute MAY be present in an Access  Request message.
Any message in which the PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute is present MUST also contain an instance of the Message  Authenticator Attribute [RFC3579].
The PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute is used as a building block to create the 802.16 "Security Capabilities" attribute ([IEEE.802.16 2004], Section 11.9.13); since this document only pertains to PKM version 1, the "Version" sub attribute in that structure MUST be set to 0x01 when the RADIUS client constructs it.
A summary of the PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
Type 140 for PKM Cryptosuite List Len 2
3n < 39, where 'n' is the number of cryptosuite identifiers in the list.
The Value field is variable length and contains a sequence of one or more cryptosuite identifiers, each of which is 3 octets in length and corresponds to the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 Cryptographic Suite attribute.
The PKM SAID Attribute is of type string [RFC2865].
It is 4 octets in length and contains a PKM Security Association Identifier ([IEEE.802.16 2004], Section 11.9.7).
It MAY be included in an Access Request message.
A summary of the PKM SAID Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
The SAID field is two octets in length and corresponds to the Value field of the 802.16 PKM SAID attribute 3.6.
The PKM SA Descriptor Attribute is of type string and is 8 octets in length.
It contains three fields, described below, which together specify the characteristics of a PKM security association.
One or more instances of the PKM SA Descriptor Attribute MAY occur in an Access Accept message.
A summary of the PKM SA Descriptor Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
The SAID field is two octets in length and contains a PKM SAID (Section 3.5).
The SA Type field is one octet in length.
The contents correspond to those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 SA Type attribute.
Cryptosuite The Cryptosuite field is 3 octets in length.
The contents correspond to those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 Cryptographic Suite attribute.
The PKM AUTH Key Attribute is of type string, 135 octets in length.
It consists of 3 fields, described below, which together specify the characteristics of a PKM authorization key.
The PKM  AUTH Key Attribute MAY occur in an Access Accept message.
Any packet that contains an instance of the PKM AUTH Key Attribute MUST also contain an instance of the Message Authenticator Attribute [RFC3579].
A summary of the PKM AUTH Key Attribute format is shown below.
The fields are transmitted from left to right.
Type 143 for PKM AUTH Key Len 135 Lifetime
The Lifetime field is 4 octets in length and represents the lifetime, in seconds, of the authorization key.
For more information, see Section 11.9.4 of [IEEE.802.16 2004].
The Sequence field is one octet in length.
The contents correspond to those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16
Key  Sequence Number attribute (see [IEEE.802.16 2004], Section 11.9.5).
Key The Key field is 128 octets in length.
The contents correspond to those of the Value field of an IEEE 802.16 AUTH Key attribute.
The Key field MUST be encrypted under the public key from the Subscriber Station certificate (Section 3.1) using RSA encryption
[RFC2437]; see Section 7.5 of [IEEE.802.16 2004] for further details.
It is necessary that a plaintext copy of this field be returned in the Access Accept message; appropriate precautions MUST be taken to ensure the confidentiality of the key.
The PKM AUTH Key Attribute (Section 3.7) contains the AUTH Key encrypted with the SS's public key.
The BS also needs the AK, so a second copy of the AK needs to be returned in the Access Accept message.
It is RECOMMENDED that the AK is encapsulated in an instance of the MS MPPE Send Key Attribute [RFC2548].
However, see Section 4.3.4 of RFC 3579
[RFC3579] for details regarding weaknesses in the encryption scheme used.
If better means for protecting the Auth Key are available (such as RADIUS key attributes with better security properties, or means of protecting the whole Access Accept message), they SHOULD be used instead of (or in addition to)
the MS MPPE Send Key Attribute.
The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.
Request Accept Reject Challenge Acct Req
PKM Config Settings 0 1
No more than one Subscriber Station Certificate may be transferred in an Access Request packet.
No more than one CA Certificate may be transferred in an Access  Request packet.
MS MPPE Send Key is one possible attribute that can be used to convey the AK to the BS; other attributes can be used instead (see Section 3.7.1).
The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries.
This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet 0
Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet 0
1 Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in packet 1
Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in packet 5.
Diameter Considerations Since the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from the standard RADIUS type space (see Section 7), no special handling is required by Diameter nodes.
Security Considerations Section 4 of RFC 3579
[RFC3579] discusses vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol.
Section 3 of the paper "Security Enhancements for Privacy and Key Management Protocol in IEEE 802.16e 2005"
[SecEn] discusses the operation and vulnerabilities of the PKMv1 protocol.
If the Access Request message is not subject to strong integrity protection, an attacker may be able to modify the contents of the PKM Cryptosuite List Attribute, weakening 802.16 security or disabling data encryption altogether.
If the Access Accept message is not subject to strong integrity protection, an attacker may be able to modify the contents of the PKM Auth Key Attribute.
For example, the Key field could be replaced with a key known to the attacker.
See Section 3.7.1 for security considerations of sending the authorization key to the BS.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned numbers for the following Attributes: 137 PKM SS Cert 138 PKM CA Cert 139 PKM Config Settings 140 PKM Cryptosuite List
141 PKM SAID 142 PKM SA Descriptor 143 PKM
The Attribute numbers are to be allocated from the standard RADIUS Attribute type space according to the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
