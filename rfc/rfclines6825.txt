Abstract This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) objects for managing the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) information with extensions in support of the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) with Traffic Engineering (TE) as well as Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) for use with network management protocols.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The OSPF MIB was originally defined for OSPF version 2 in support of IPv4 [RFC4750] and extended to support the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) as OSPF version 3 MIB [RFC5643].
The IS IS MIB is also defined in [RFC4444].
On the other side, MPLS /GMPLS based traffic engineering has so far extended the OSPF/IS IS routing protocol with TE functionality [RFC4202] [RFC3630]
To manage such MPLS TE/GMPLS networks effectively, routing information associated with MPLS/GMPLS TE parameters is preferred for network management; however, there is no clear definition of MPLS/GMPLS TE information in existing MIBs related to OSPF(v2 and v3)/IS IS.
This memo defines the MIB objects for managing TED in support of MPLS TE/GMPLS for use with network management protocols.
This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the OSPFv2 MIB, OSPF v3 MIB, and IS IS MIB, as well as other MIBs defined in [RFC3812], [RFC3813], [RFC4802], and [RFC4803] for the management of MPLS /GMPLS based traffic engineering information.
By implementing such MIB modules, it is helpful to simultaneously understand the entire MPLS/GMPLS network, for example, understanding routing information as well as LSP information using a management system.
However, note that this MIB module is able to be implemented and performed without implementation of other MIB modules when the management system, for example, only comprehends MPLS/GMPLS topology information such as TE link information.

Brief Description of MIB Module
The objects described in this section support the management of TED as described in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], and [RFC5307] for GMPLS extensions as well as in [RFC3630] and [RFC5305] for MPLS/GMPLS.
The TED table is basically used to indicate TED information of OSPF  TE or ISIS TE.
However, this table does not contain information for the Local/Remote Interface IP Address, Interface Switching Capability Descriptor, or Shared Risk Link Group information within the sub TLVs for the Link TLV.
The tedLocalIfAddrTable is identical to the Local Interface IP Address information in a sub TLV for the Link TLV.
This is independently defined, because the Interface IP Address sub TLV may appear more than once with the same Link TLV.
The tedRemoteIfAddrTable is identical to the Remote Interface IP Address information in a sub TLV of the Link TLV.
This is independently defined, because the Interface IP Address sub TLV may appear more than once with the same Link TLV.
The tedSwCapTable is identical to the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor information in a sub TLV of the Link TLV.
This is independently defined, because the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor sub TLV may appear more than once with the same Link TLV.
The tedSrlgTable is identical to the Shared Risk Link Group information in a sub TLV of the Link TLV.
This table is independently defined because the Shared Risk Link Group sub TLV may appear more than once with the same Link TLV.
In this section, we provide an example of the TED MIB module usage.
The following indicates the information of a numbered TE link originated in a GMPLS controlled node.
When TE link information is retrieved in an MPLS network, GMPLS specific objects such as tedLocalIfAddrTable, tedRemoteIfAddrTable, tedSwCapTable, and tedSrlgTable are not supported.
By retrieval of such information periodically, the management system can comprehend the detailed topology information related to MPLS/GMPLS networks.
In particular, the basic TED information can be collected by tedTable, and Local/Remote Interface IP Address information related to MPLS/GMPLS networks are collected by tedLocalIfAddrTable and tedRemoteIfAddrTable, and the attribute information related to GMPLS TE links can be retrieved by tedSwCapTable and tedSrlgTable.
Regarding fault management, there is no functionality to notify network failures in this MIB module.
However, if network topologies are changed, the module can notify the management system of the change information by using tedStatusChange, tedEntryCreated, and tedEntryDeleted.
Note that the TED MIB module is limited to "read only" access except for tedCreatedDeletedNotificationMaxRate and tedStatusChangeNotificationMaxRate.
The TED MIB module is designed to be independent of OSPF or IS IS MIBs; however, information for each TE link belongs to a node or a link that is managed by the routing protocol.

There are several objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX  ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: tedTable, tedLocalIfAddrTable, tedRemoteIfAddrTable, tedSwCapTable, and tedSrlgTable contain topology information for the MPLS/GMPLS network.
If an administrator does not want to reveal this information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.
There are only two write access objects in this MIB module: tedStatusChangeNotificationMaxRate and tedCreatedDeletedNotificationMaxRate.
Malicious modification of these objects could cause the management agent, the network, or the router to become overloaded with notifications in cases of high churn within the network.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned 273 to the TED MIB module specified in this document in the "Internet standard MIB Transmission Group" registry.
New assignments can only be made via Specification Required as specified in [RFC5226].
In addition, the IANA has marked value 273 (the corresponding transmission value allocated according to this document) as "Reserved" in the "ifType definitions" registry.
