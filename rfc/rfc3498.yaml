    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3. Overview\n   These objects are used to control and manage SONET linear APS\n
    \  architectures.  Ring APS groups are not currently supported by this\n   MIB.\n
    \  The MIB includes three scalars, containing counts of APS groups and\n   SONET
    LTEs, a notification enable object, and six tables.\n   The apsMapTable contains
    entries for each SONET LTE interface\n   available on the system.  The table serves
    two purposes.  It can be\n   used to locate SONET LTE interfaces that are not
    currently included\n   in APS groups.  It also provides a mapping from InterfaceIndex
    to\n   group name and channel number for those SONET LTE interfaces that are\n
    \  included in APS groups.  Entries in apsMapTable cannot be added or\n   deleted
    through operations defined in this MIB.  However, an\n   apsMapEntry may be added
    or deleted through other system mechanisms,\n   such as hot swap.  Also, existing
    entries cannot be directly modified\n   and instead, such modifications occur
    as a result of side-effects of\n   operations on the apsChanConfigTable.\n   The
    apsChanConfigTable supports addition, modification and deletion\n   of entries
    representing linear APS channels.  Entries are indexed by\n   a text group name
    and integer channel number.  Each entry contains an\n   InterfaceIndex value identifying
    the SONET LTE used for the channel\n   and the priority of the channel.  A side
    effect of row creation or\n   deletion is the setting of map entry fields.  Creation
    of two or more\n   entries in this table with a common group name index and consecutive\n
    \  channel numbers is the first step in the creation and configuration\n   of
    an APS group.  It is not necessary to create channel numbers in\n   order; however,
    before an APS group is made active, the set of\n   channels must begin with channel
    number 0 (for architectures other\n   than onePlusOneOptimized) or channel number
    1 (for the\n   onePlusOneOptimized architecture) and must have consecutive channel\n
    \  numbers not exceeding 14.  Note that the term null channel, which is\n   used
    throughout this document, refers to the protection line.\n   The apsConfigTable
    supports addition, modification, and deletion of\n   entries representing linear
    APS groups.  Entries are indexed by a\n   text group name.  Each entry contains
    parameters that specify the\n   configuration of a particular linear APS group.
    \ Entries are created\n   in this table after a set of channels are created in
    the\n   apsChanConfigTable.  To successfully set an instance of\n   apsConfigRowStatus
    to active the apsConfigEntry must contain valid\n   values and all associated
    apsChanConfigEntry rows must be valid and\n   produce a consecutive set of channels
    beginning with channel number 0\n   or 1, depending on the selected architecture.\n
    \  The apsCommandTable provides linear APS commands that support\n   protection
    switching and the ability to modify APS operation.\n   Entries in this table are
    created as a side effect of setting the\n   associated apsConfigRowStatus object
    to active.  Entries in this\n   table are deleted if the associated apsConfigRowStatus
    object is set\n   to any value except active.\n   The apsChanStatusTable provides
    individual channel statistics.\n   The apsStatusTable provides group level statistics.\n
    \  An APS group is created and configured with the following sequence of\n   events:\n
    \  CHANNEL CONFIGURATION\n   Create an entry in the apsChanConfigTable.  Set the\n
    \  apsChanConfigGroupName in an apsChanConfigEntry to a user-friendly\n   text
    string which will serve as the APS group name.  The string must\n   not be equal
    to the apsConfigName of an existing apsConfigEntry with\n   apsConfigRowStatus
    set to active, since a channel cannot be added to\n   an active group.  The string
    may be set equal to the apsConfigName of\n   a row which is currently not set
    to active, or it may be set to a\n   string which does not currently exist in
    any instance of\n   apsConfigName.  A channel number is entered in apsChanConfigNumber.\n
    \  A channel priority is entered in apsChanConfigPriority, if the\n   intended
    architecture is 1:n.  apsChanConfigPriority is ignored if\n   the architecture
    is 1+1.  The InterfaceIndex value of a SONET LTE\n   interface is entered in apsChanConfigIfIndex.\n
    \  This step is repeated for all apsChanConfigEntry instances which are\n   to
    be included in the APS group.\n   ACTIVATING THE GROUP\n   If the apsChanConfigGroupName
    does not exist in an instance of\n   apsConfigName, an apsConfigEntry is created
    with the\n   apsChanConfigGroupName value used as the index for the row.  The\n
    \  apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to createAndGo.  The\n   apsGroupConfigEntry
    and apsChanConfigEntry instances with matching\n   name fields will be checked
    for consistency.  If any errors in the\n   channel numbers, architecture or configuration
    are uncovered the\n   apsConfigRowStatus set will return inconsistentValue, otherwise\n
    \  noError is returned.\n   If the apsChanConfigGroupName value used in channel
    configuration\n   exists in a previously created, inactive apsConfigEntry instance,
    the\n   apsConfigRowStatus value may be set to active.\n   An agent is not required
    to process SNMP Set Requests that affect\n   multiple control objects within this
    MIB.  This is intended to\n   simplify the processing of Set Requests for the
    various control\n   tables by eliminating the possibility that a single Set PDU
    will\n   contain multiple varbinds which are in conflict, such as a PDU which\n
    \  both activates a given apsConfigEntry while at the same time it\n   deactivates
    an associated apsChanConfigEntry.\n"

  - "9. Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ In particular, the APS command objects\n   apsCommandSwitch and apsCommandControl
    and the APS configuration\n   objects apsConfigRowStatus, apsConfigMode, apsConfigRevert,\n
    \  apsConfigDirection, apsConfigExtraTraffic, apsConfigSdBerThreshold,\n   apsConfigSfBerThreshold,
    apsConfigWaitToRestore,\n   apsConfigStorageType, apsChanConfigRowStatus, apsChanConfigIfIndex,\n
    \  apsChanConfigPriority, apsChanConfigStorageType and\n   apsNotificationEnable
    have the potential of disrupting APS operations\n   if set operations are performed
    with malicious intent.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate
    security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n
    \  there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n
    \  It is recommended that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided
    by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support
    for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not\n   recommended.
    \ Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic
    security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that access
    to an instance of this MIB\n   module is properly configured for only those principals
    (users) that\n   have legitimate rights to GET or SET object instances.\n"
