  contents:
  - "1  MIXER X.400/RFC 822 Mappings\n   MIXER (RFC 2156) defines an algorithm for\
    \ use of a set of global\n   mapping between X.400 and RFC 822 addresses [4].\
    \  This specification\n   defines how to represent and maintain these mappings\
    \ (MIXER\n   Conformant Global Address Mappings of MCGAMs) in an X.500 or LDAP\n\
    \   directory.  Mechanisms for representing OR Address and Domain\n   hierarchies\
    \ within the DIT are defined in [5, 2].  These techniques\n   are used to define\
    \ two independent subtrees in the DIT, which contain\n   the mapping information.\
    \  The benefits of this approach are:\n   1.  The mapping information is kept\
    \ in a clearly defined area which\n       can be widely replicated in an efficient\
    \ manner.  The tree is\n       constrained to hold only information needed to\
    \ support the\n       mapping.  This is important as gateways need good access\
    \ to the\n       entire mapping.\n   2.  It facilitates migration from a table-based\
    \ approach.\n   3.  It handles the issues of \"missing components\" in a natural\n\
    \       manner.\n          An alternative approach which is not taken is to locate\
    \ the\n          information in the routing subtrees.  The benefits of this\n\
    \          would be:\n        o  It is the \"natural\" location, and will also\
    \ help to\n           ensure correct administrative authority for a mapping\n\
    \           definition.\n        o  The tree will usually be accessed for routing,\
    \ and so it\n           will be efficient for addresses which are being routed.\n\
    \          This is not done, as the benefits of the approach proposed are\n  \
    \        greater.\n   MCGAMs are global.  A MIXER gateway may use any set of MCGAMs.\
    \  A key\n   use of the directory is to enable MIXER gateways to share MCGAMs\
    \ and\n   to share the effort of maintaining and publishing MCGAMs.  This\n  \
    \ specification and MIXER also recognise that there is not a single\n   unique\
    \ location for publication of all MCGAMs.  This specification\n   allows for multiple\
    \ sets of MCGAMs to be published.  Each set of\n   MCGAMs is published under a\
    \ single part of the directory.  There are\n   four mappings, which are represented\
    \ by two subtrees located under\n   any part of the DIT. For the examples the\
    \ location defined below is\n   used:\n   OU=MIXER MCGAMs, O=Zydeco Plc,  C=GB\n\
    \   These subtree roots are of object class subtree, and use the\n   mechanism\
    \ for representing subtrees defined in [1].\n   X.400 to RFC 822 This table gives\
    \ the equivalence mapping from X.400\n       to RFC 822.  There is an OR Address\
    \ tree under this.  An example\n       entry is:\n       PRMD=Isode, ADMD=Mailnet,\
    \ C=FI, CN=X.400 to RFC 822,\n       OU=MIXER MCGAMs, O=Zydeco Plc,  C=GB\n  \
    \ RFC 822 to X.400 There is a domain tree under this.  This table holds\n    \
    \   the equivalence mapping from RFC 822 to X.400, and the gateway\n       mapping\
    \ defined in RFC 1327.  An example entry is:\n       DomainComponent=ISODE, DomainComponent=COM,\n\
    \       CN=RFC 822 to X.400,\n       OU=MIXER MCGAMs, O=Zydeco Plc,  C=GB\n  \
    \ The values of the table mapping are defined by use of two new object\n   classes,\
    \ as specified in Figure 1.  The objects give pointers to the\n   mapped components.\n"
- title: 2  Omitted Components
  contents:
  - "2  Omitted Components\n   In MIXER, it is possible to have omitted components\
    \ in OR Addresses\n   on either side of the mapping.  A mechanism to represent\
    \ such omitted\n   components is defined in Figure 2.  The attribute at-or-address-\n\
    \   component-type is set to the X.500 attribute type associated with the\n  \

  contents:
  - "3  Mapping from X.400 to RFC 822\n   As an example, consider the mapping from\
    \ the OR Address:\n   P=Isode; A=Mailnet; C=FI\n   This would be keyed by the\
    \ directory entry:\n   PRMD=Isode, ADMD=Mailnet, C=FI, CN=X.400 to RFC 822,\n\
    \   OU=MIXER MCGAMs, O=Zydeco Plc,  C=GB\n   and return the mapping from the associatedDomain\
    \ attribute, which\n   gives the domain which this OR address maps to.  This attribute\
    \ is\n   used to define authoritative mappings, which are placed in the open\n\
    \   community tree.  The manager of an MCGAM shall make the appropriate\n   entry.\n\
    \   The Internet gateway mapping defined in MIXER[4] is provided by the\n   associatedInternetGateway\
    \ attribute.  This value may identify\n   multiple possible associated gateways.\
    \  This information is looked up\n   at the same time as mapped OR addresses.\
    \  In effect, this provides a\n   fallback mapping, which is found if there is\
    \ no equivalence mapping.\n   Because of the nature of the mapping an OR Address\
    \ will map to either\n   a gateway or a domain, but not both.  Thus, there shall\
    \ never be both\n   an associatedDomain and associatedInternetGateway attribute\
    \ present\n   in the same entry.  Functionally, mapping takes place exactly\n\
    \   according to MIXER. The longest match is found by the following\n   algorithm.\n\
    \   1.  Take the OR Address, and derive a directory name.  This will be\n    \
    \   the OR Address as far as the lowest OU.\n   2.  Look up the entire name derived\
    \ from the MIXER key in the in the\n       X.400 to RFC 822 subtree.  This lookup\
    \ will either succeed, or it\n       will fail and indicate the longest possible\
    \ match, which can then\n       be looked up.\n   3.  Check for an associatedDomain\
    \ or associatedInternetGateway\n       attribute in the matched entry.\n   The\
    \ mapping can always be achieved with two lookups.  Because of the\n   availability\
    \ of aliases, some of the table mappings may be\n   simplified.  In addition,\
    \ the directory can support mapping from\n   addresses using the numeric country\
    \ codes.\n"

  contents:
  - "4  Mapping from RFC 822 to X.400\n   There is an analogous structure for mappings\
    \ in the reverse\n   direction.  The domain hierarchy is represented in the DIT\
    \ according\n   to RFC 1279.  The domain:\n   ISODE.COM\n   Is represented in\
    \ the DIT as:\n   DomainComponent=ISODE, DomainComponent=COM,  CN=RFC 822 to X.400,\n\
    \   OU=MIXER MCGAMs, O=Zydeco Plc,  C=GB\n   This has associated with it the attribute\
    \ associatedORAddress encoded\n   as a distinguished name with a value: PRMD=Isode,\
    \ ADMD=Mailnet, C=FI\n   The X.400 gateway mapping defined in MIXER[4] is provided\
    \ by the\n   associatedX400Gateway attribute.  This value may identify multiple\n\
    \   possible associated gateways.  This information is looked up at the\n   same\
    \ time as mapped OR addresses.  In effect, this provides a\n   fallback mapping,\
    \ which is found if there is no equivalence mapping.\n   Because of the nature\

    \ attribute present in\n   the same entry.  Functionally, mapping takes place\
    \ exactly according\n   to MIXER. The longest match is found by the following\
    \ algorithm.\n   1.  Derive a directory name from the domain part of the RFC 822\n\
    \       address.\n   2.  Look up this name in the RFC 822 to X.400 subtree to\
    \ find the\n       mapped value (either associatedORAddress or\n       associatedX400Gateway.).\
    \  If the lookup fails, the error will\n       indicate the longest match, which\
    \ can then be looked up.\n   If associatedORAddress is found, this will define\
    \ the mapped OR\n   Address.  The mapping can always be achieved with two lookups.\
    \  If an\n   associatedX400Gateway is present, the address in question will be\n\
    \   encoded as a domain defined attribute, relative to the OR Address\n   defined\
    \ by this attribute.  If multiple associatedX400Gateway\n   attributes are found,\
    \ the MTA may select the one it chooses to use.\n   Because of the availability\
    \ of aliases, some of the table mappings\n   may be simplified.  In addition,\
    \ the directory can support mapping\n   from addresses using the numeric country\
