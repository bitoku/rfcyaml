- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, \"cid:\" and \"mid:\"\
    \ allow\n   references to messages and the body parts of messages.  For example,\n\
    \   within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include\n   embedded\
    \ references to other parts of the same message.\n"
- title: Changes from (RFC 2111)
  contents:
  - "Changes from (RFC 2111)\n   Clarified the example on page 3 on of converting\
    \ cid URLs to\n   Content-IDs.  The example now uses a cid URL instead of an mid.\n\
    \   Corrected the example messages to have the correct Content-ID form;\n   they\
    \ now use the angle brackets.  Added a Message-ID header to the\n   second example.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The use of [MIME] within email to convey Web pages and their\n\
    \   associated images requires a URL scheme to permit the HTML to refer\n   to\
    \ the images or other data included in the message.  The Content-ID\n   Uniform\
    \ Resource Locator, \"cid:\", serves that purpose.\n   Similarly Net News readers\
    \ use Message-IDs to link related messages\n   together.  The Message-ID URL provides\
    \ a scheme, \"mid:\", to refer to\n   such messages as a \"resource\".\n   The\
    \ \"mid\" (Message-ID) and \"cid\" (Content-ID) URL schemes provide\n   identifiers\
    \ for messages and their body parts.  The \"mid\" scheme uses\n   (a part of)\
    \ the message-id of an email message to refer to a specific\n   message.  The\
    \ \"cid\" scheme refers to a specific body part of a\n   message; its use is generally\
    \ limited to references to other body\n   parts in the same message as the referring\
    \ body part.  The \"mid\"\n   scheme may also refer to a specific body part within\
    \ a designated\n   message, by including the content-ID's address.\n   A note\
    \ on terminology.  The terms \"body part\" and \"MIME entity\" are\n   used interchangeably.\
    \  They refer to the headers and body of a MIME\n   message, either the message\
    \ itself or one of the body parts contained\n   in a Multipart message.\n"
- title: 2. The MID and CID URL Schemes
  contents:
  - "2. The MID and CID URL Schemes\n   RFC 1738 [URL] reserves the \"mid\" and \"\
    cid\" schemes for Message-ID\n   and Content-ID respectively.  This memorandum\
    \ defines the syntax for\n   those URLs.  Because they use the same syntactic\
    \ elements they are\n   presented together.\n   The URLs take the form\n     content-id\
    \    = url-addr-spec\n     message-id    = url-addr-spec\n     url-addr-spec =\
    \ addr-spec  ; URL encoding of RFC 822 addr-spec\n     cid-url       = \"cid\"\
    \ \":\" content-id\n     mid-url       = \"mid\" \":\" message-id [ \"/\" content-id\
    \ ]\n     Notes: In Internet mail messages, the addr-spec in a Content-ID\n  \
    \   [MIME] or Message-ID [822] header is enclosed in angle brackets\n     (<>).\
    \  Since addr-spec in a Message-ID or Content-ID might contain\n     characters\
    \ not allowed within a URL; any such character (including\n     \"/\", which is\
    \ reserved within the \"mid\" scheme) must be hex-encoded\n     using the %hh\
    \ escape mechanism in [URL].\n   A \"mid\" URL with only a \"message-id\" refers\
    \ to an entire message.\n   With the appended \"content-id\", it refers to a body\
    \ part within a\n   message, as does a \"cid\" URL.  The Content-ID of a MIME\
    \ body part is\n   required to be globally unique.  However, in many systems that\
    \ store\n   messages, body parts are not indexed independently their context\n\
    \   (message).  The \"mid\" URL long form was designed to supply the\n   context\
    \ needed to support interoperability with such systems.\n   A implementation conforming\
    \ to this specification is required to\n   support the \"mid\" URL long form (message-id/content-id).\
    \  Conforming\n   implementations can choose to, but are not required to, take\n\
    \   advantage of the content-id's uniqueness and interpret a \"cid\" URL to\n\
    \   refer to any body part within the message store.\n   In limited circumstances\
    \ (e.g., within multipart/alternate), a single\n   message may contain several\
    \ body parts that have the same Content-ID.\n   That occurs, for example, when\
    \ identical data can be accessed through\n   different methods.  In those cases,\
    \ conforming implementations are\n   required to use the rules of the containing\
    \ MIME entity (e.g.,\n   multipart/alternate) to select the body part to which\
    \ the Content-ID\n   refers.\n   A \"cid\" URL is converted to the corresponding\
    \ Content-ID message\n   header [MIME] by removing the \"cid:\" prefix, converting\
    \ the % encoded\n   character to their equivalent US-ASCII characters, and enclosing\
    \ the\n   remaining parts with an angle bracket pair, \"<\" and \">\".  For\n\
    \   example, \"cid:foo4%25foo1@bar.net\" corresponds to\n     Content-ID: <foo4%25foo1@bar.net>\n\
    \   Reversing the process and converting URL special characters to their\n   %\
    \ encodings produces the original cid.\n   A \"mid\" URL is converted to a Message-ID\
    \ or Message-ID/Content-ID\n   pair in a similar fashion.\n   Both message-id\
    \ and content-id are required to be globally unique.\n   That is, no two different\
    \ messages will ever have the same Message-ID\n   addr-spec; no different body\
    \ parts will ever have the same Content-ID\n   addr-spec.  A common technique\
    \ used by many message systems is to use\n   a time and date stamp along with\
    \ the local host's domain name, e.g.,\n   950124.162336@XIson.com.\n   Some Examples\n\
    \   The following message contains an HTML body part that refers to an\n   image\
    \ contained in another body part.  Both body parts are contained\n   in a Multipart/Related\
    \ MIME entity.  The HTML IMG tag contains a\n   cidurl which points to the image.\n\
    \     From: foo1@bar.net\n     To: foo2@bar.net\n     Subject: A simple example\n\
    \     Mime-Version: 1.0\n     Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=\"boundary-example-1\"\

    \ Text/HTML; charset=US-ASCII\n     to the other body part, for example through\
    \ a statement such as:\n     <IMG SRC=\"cid:foo4*foo1@bar.net\" ALT=\"IETF logo\"\
    >\n     --boundary-example-1\n     Content-ID: <foo4*foo1@bar.net>\n     Content-Type:\

  - "3. Security Considerations\n   The URLs defined here provide an addressing or\
    \ referencing mechanism.\n   The values of these URLs disclose no more about the\
    \ originators\n   environment than the corresponding Message-ID and Content-ID\
    \ values.\n   Where concern exists about such disclosures the originator of a\n\
    \   message using mid and cid URLs must take precautions to insure that\n   confidential\
    \ information is not disclosed.  Those precautions should\n   already be in place\
    \ to handle existing mail use of the Message-ID and\n   Content-ID.\n"
