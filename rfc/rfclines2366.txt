Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for IP hosts and routers that use a Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) to support IP multicast over ATM, as described in 'Support for Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 based ATM Networks' [1].
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of these components.
[2] the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
the Textual Conventions, described in RFC 1903 [3] for SNMPv2.
the Conformance Statements, described in RFC 1904 [4] for SNMPv2.
the Simple Network Management Protocol, described in RFC 1157 [5].
the Protocol Operations, described in RFC 1905 [6] for SNMPv2.
the MIB II, STD 17, RFC 1213
[7] the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols for SNMPv2.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object type.
This MARS MIB is designed to define managed objects that can be used to manage the MARS clients, servers, and the multicast servers (MCS), as described in the RFC2022[1].
The MIB is supposed to be used on a system where one or more MARS clients are running, or where one or more MARS servers are running, or where one or more MARS multicast servers are running.
An understanding of MARS, as defined in [1] is assumed in this MIB module definition.
However, the following terms are used frequently and are included here for reference: Multicast Group A group of endpoints that communicate with each other such that packets sent from one endpoint are received by all other members of the multicast group.
Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS)
A server that distributes multicast group membership information to endpoints.
An ATM attached host or router that registers with a MARS and that is a member of one or more multicast groups.
An endpoint may establish ATM Virtual Channels (VCs) to the other group members or may make use of a Multicast Server.
The set of clients managed by a MARS.
A server that sets up ATM Virtual Channels (VCs) between endpoints in a multicast group and to which the endpoints forward data traffic for transmission on their behalf.
The MIB is broken down into three major groups: a MARS client group, MARS (server) group, and MARS Multicast Server (MCS) Group.
This client group defines a collection of objects required to be implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS clients.
MARS Client Multicast Group Table
A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS client.
MARS Client Backup MARS Group Table
A list of backup MARS's associated with a MARS client.
MARS Client VC Table Information about VCs opened by a client.
MARS Client Statistics Table Statistics collected by a MARS client.
This MARS server group defines a collection of objects required to be implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS servers.
A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS.
MARS VC Table Information about VCs opened by a MARS.
A list of clients registered with a MARS.
MARS Registered Multicast Server Table
A list of MCSs registered with a MARS.
MARS Statistics Table Statistics collected by a MARS.
MARS Host Map Table Mappings between multicast groups and clients maintained by a MARS.
MARS Server Map Table Mappings between multicast groups and MCSs maintained by a MARS.
The MARS Multicast Server Group
This MARS multicast server group defines a collection of objects required to be implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS multicast servers.
MARS MCS Multicast Group Table
A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS MCS.
MARS MCS Backup Mars Group Table
A list of backup MARS's associated with a MARS MCS.
MARS Multicast Server VC Table Information about VCs opened by a MCS.
Multicast Server Statistics Table Statistics collected by a MCS.

marsMcsRegstration, marsMcsDefaultMtu while other objects in this conceptual row can be modified irrespective of the value of this object.
Deletion of this row is allowed regardless of whether or not a row in any associated tables (i.e., marsMcsVcTable) still exists or is in use.
Once this row is deleted, it is recommended that the agent or the SNMP management station (if possible) through the set command deletes any stale rows that are associated with this row."

"Each entry represents a consecutive block of multicast group addresses.
Minimum multicast group address the min and max multicast forms multi group block.
If the MinGrpAddr and MaxGrpAddr are the same, it indicates that this block contains a single group address.
Since the block joins are no allowed by a MCS as implied in the RFC2022, the MinGrpAddr and MaxGrpAddress should be set to the same value at this time when an entry row is created."

"This table contains a list of backup MARS
addresses that a MCS can make contact to in case of failure for connecting to the primary server.
The list of addresses is in descending order of preference.
It should be noted that the backup list provided by the MARS to the MCS via the MARS REDIRECT MAP message has a higher preference than addresses that are manually configured into the MCS.
When such a list is received from the MARS, this information should be inserted at the top of the list.
Each row can be created or deleted via configuration."

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such object may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET (change/create/delete)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2274 [8] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2275
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have a legitimate rights to indeed SET (change/create/delete) them.
Note: read access in fact
may also need access control.
