  - "           DATA AND FILE TRANSFER - SOME MEASUREMENT RESULTS\n   During the last\
    \ six months, we have been monitoring (although not\n   continuously) the performance\
    \ of our FTP-user and FTP-server\n   programs.  The purpose of this paper is to\
    \  1) discuss measurement\n   criteria,  2) describe the measurement facilities,\
    \ 3) report the\n   relevant measurement results,  4) discuss the significance\
    \ of results\n   and compare them with other measurement data, and 5) ask for\n\
    \   suggestions on our measurement and summarizing procedures.\n"
- title: I. THE MEASUREMENT CRITERIA
  contents:
  - "I. THE MEASUREMENT CRITERIA\n   The FTP (Ref. \"The File Transfer Protocol\"\
    , by Abhay Bhushan, NWG/RFC\n   354, NIC 10596, ) may be considered a facility\
    \ for data transfer\n   between file systems.  The relevant measurement parameters\
    \ for a data\n   transfer facility are:\n   1) Transfer rate (both peak and average,\
    \ measured in bits per second)\n   which determines the throughput of the data\
    \ transfer facility.\n   2) Response time or delay (measured in seconds) which\
    \ determines the\n   \"interactibility\" of the facility.\n   3) Processing cost\
    \ (measured in dollars or cpu-seconds per megabit\n   transferred) for transferring\
    \ the data between the network and the\n   file system.  This is only one component\
    \ of the cost of transferring\n   data, the other component being the communication\
    \ cost (including IMP\n   processing costs) which we take as given.\n   4) Failure-to-connect\
    \ rate - average time elapsed between failures to\n   connect to the facility\
    \ (measured in hours).  Failures could be in\n   the Host (processor and file\
    \ system) hardware or software, or in the\n   IMPs and telephone lines.\n   5)\
    \ Availability - the percentage of time a given facility is\n   available, or\
    \ alternately the probability of finding the facility\n   available at a given\
    \ time.\n   6) Accuracy - measured by the probability of error in transferring\n\
    \   bits, bytes, blocks, or files.\n"

  - "II.  THE MEASUREMENT FACILITIES\n   The MIT-CMS survey program (ref. \"A Report\
    \ on the Survey Project\" by\n   Abhay Bhushan, NWG/RFC 530, NIC 17375) measures\
    \ the response-time,\n   failure-to-connect rate, and availability of the Host-logger\
    \ facility\n   (on socket 1).  Our preliminary experiments have indicated that\
    \ the\n   corresponding measurement results for the FTP are very close to that\n\
    \   for the logger (at least they are the same order-of-magnitude).  As\n   the\
    \ use of FTP and the ARPANET is increasing rapidly, most Hosts have\n   their\
    \ logger and FTP operational whenever their Host and NCP (Network\n   Control\
    \ Program) are functioning.  The response time for obtaining\n   the use of FTP\
    \ service is very close to that for obtaining the use of\n   the logger service\
    \ as both involve the use of the ICP (Initial\n   Connection Protocol).\n   Preliminary\
    \ results from the Survey Project indicate that the average\n   response time\
    \ in recent months has been about 2.7 seconds.  The\n   average availability has\
    \ been about 85% with the failure-to-connect\n   rate being about once every 10\
    \ hours.  Table I shows summary results\n   for the time period August 26 through\
    \ August 31, 1973, for three\n   Hosts with TENEX operating systems (SRI-ARC (NIC),\
    \ BBN-TENEXA, and\n   USC-ISI).\n   The reader is cautioned that the data below\
    \ reflects the Host\n   performance as seen by the MIT-DMS survey program which\
    \ surveys the\n   Hosts only once every twenty minutes.  Consequently, the actual\
    \ host\n   performance may be somewhat different.  Also, we cannot distinguish\n\
    \   between IMP, telephone lines, and Host failures and the response time\n  \
    \ of a host is affected by its distance (number of IMP hops) from the\n   MIT\
    \ IMP (IMP 6).\n   In the data shown in Table II, each success or fail response\
    \ is\n   considered to have a duration of 20 minutes, so Hosts are given the\n\
    \   benefit of the doubt for the time we are not surveying.  In addition,\n  \
    \ the response time has been averaged only for the successful logger\n   available\
    \ responses.  The logger is considered available if the\n   SURVEY program can\
    \ establish a full-duplex connection within 20\n   seconds.  The Host is considered\
    \ available when it is not in the\n   \"DEAD\" state (states in which logger is\
    \ not up but the Host is\n   available are logger not responding and logger rejecting).\n\

    \ a forth-\n   coming paper.  This paper will focus on the remaining parameters\
    \ of\n   transmission rate, processing costs and accuracy, as measured by the\n\
    \   MIT-DMS File Transfer Measurement facility.\n   The FTP measurement facility\
    \ exists in the MIT-DMS CALICO subsystem.\n   Each time the MIT-DMS FTP-user or\
    \ FTP-server program in the CALICO\n   subsystem is used to transfer files (and\
    \ data) via the ARPANET, it\n   records in a local disk file the following transfer\
    \ parameters: the\n   remote Host involved, the date and time the transfer is\
    \ initiated,\n   the total number of bits transferred, the real time taken (in\n\
    \   seconds) for the transfer, the CPU time (in micro-seconds) used by\n   the\
    \ program, whether the program is the server or user, and the FTP\n   parameter\
    \ settings for byte size (BYTE), representation type (TYPE),\n   transfer mode\
    \ (MODE), and the file structure (STRU).  Programs exist\n   in CALICO to display\
    \ and summarize this data.\n   It should be noted that no measurements are recorded\
    \ when the non-\n   CALICO FTP-user and FTP-server programs are used for transferring\n\
    \   files.  Therefore it should be pointed out that the measurement\n   represents\
    \ a small subset of our total FTP-usage.  The CALICO FTP-\n   server was operated\
    \ only till May 1973, when we switched to the non-\n   CALICO FTP-server.  (The\
    \ switch was made because CALICO still\n   undergoing development is somewhat\
    \ less reliable.  As CALICO\n   stabilizes we may again operate the CALICO server\
    \ and continue\n   measuring data transfer.) In addition many users prefer to\
    \ use the\n   simpler (involving fewer system resources) stand-alone FTP-user\n\
    \   program.  The measurement does include the data transferred when FTP\n   is\
    \ used indirectly by such commands as \"copy\", \"print\", \"listf\", and\n  \
    \ \"mail.file\" in the CALICO NETWRK subsystem.\n"

- title: IV.  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEASUREMENT RESULTS
  contents:
  - "IV.  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEASUREMENT RESULTS\n   First of all let me state my\
    \ complete agreement with Barry Wessler\n   (Ref. \"Revelations in Network Host\
    \ Measurements\" NWG/RFC 557, NIC\n   18457) that the measurement results should\
    \ be taken in the spirit:\n   \"Here is a place to make the Network better\" rather\
    \ than:  \"Look,\n   isn't the Network terrible.\"  We take these measurements\
    \ in the same\n   spirit and have found the measurement effort to be quite fruitful.\n\
    \   In several instances, with the aid of our measurement facilities, we\n   have\
    \ been able to improve the performance of our Network programs by\n   an order-of-magnitude\
    \ (just as Don Allen at BBN improved Greg Hicks'\n   RJS program).\n   Our measurement\
    \ results are in close agreement with the BBN FTP\n   measurements (8.2 cpu seconds/Mb\
    \ for 8-bit byte and 2 CPU seconds/Mb\n   for 36-bit byte transfers).  We also\
    \ find the 36-bit byte transfer to\n   be an order-of-magnitude more efficient\
    \ than 8-bit byte transfer.\n   The processing cost (assuming $6.00 per CPU minute)\
    \ for transferring\n   a Megabit of information comes to about $1.90 for ASCII-8\
    \ mode as\n   compared to only $0.30 for Image-36 mode.   The difference in\n\
    \   transfer rate is equally astounding being 9.4 Kbps for Image-36 as\n   compared\
    \ to only 2 Kbps for ASCII-8.\n   It is therefore recommended that Image-36 mode\
    \ be used as much as\n   possible to transfer data between PDP-10s (of which there\
    \ are many on\n   the ARPANET).  It is strongly urged that protocols and programs\
    \ allow\n   (and use) the Image-36 mode for all data transfers including mailing\n\
    \   files (MLFL), listing directories (LIST, NLST), and\n   sending/retrieving\
    \ NIC Journal documents.  Many of the MID-DMS user\n   programs such as \"COPY\"\
    \ and \"FTP\" take advantage of the fact that the\n   remote Host is a PDP-10\
    \ (there is a table of PDP-10's in \"COPY\") and\n   use the more efficient Image-36\
    \ mode.  Such a procedure is highly\n   recommended.\n   The effective IMP-IMP\
    \ data transfer rate is about 37.5 Kbps over the\n   50 Kbps telephone line (Ref.\
    \  McQuillan John M., \"Throughput in the\n   ARPA Network--Analysis and Measurement,\"\
    \ BBN Report 2491, NIC 14188,\n   January 1971).  The Host-to-Host data transfer\
    \ measurement performed\n   by BBN (above reference, p. 28) have indicated a transfer\
    \ rate of\n   30-35 kbps BBN-to-BBN (0 IMP hops) and 12-16 Kbps BBN-to-SRI (5\
    \ hops)\n   using single link.  As FTP transfers data via a single link, a\n \
    \  maximum transfer rate between 12 and 35 Kbps (depending on number of\n   IMP\
    \ hops) can be expected if that file transfer is the only activity\n   going on.\
    \  In this light our maximum transfer rate of 27 Kbps to BBN\n   (2 hops) is probably\
    \ the most one can expect out of any program.  The\n   average transfer rate of\
    \ 9.4 Kbps (for Image-36) transfer also\n   appears reasonable in view of the\
    \ fact that during many of the\n   transfers other network activity is also going\
    \ on, and that many of\n   the transfers are performed when the respective computer\
    \ systems are\n   quite heavily loaded.  Our measurement data does reveal that\
    \ transfer\n   rate is appreciably higher during the times a computer is likely\
    \ to\n   be lightly loaded.\n   The above does not mean that improvements are\
    \ not possible or not\n   required in the state of the ARPANET data transfer.\
    \  Our measurement\n   data has revealed areas in which improvements can be and\
    \ should be\n   made.  For example, the transfer of data to other MIT Hosts (0\
    \ IMP\n   hops) and back to ourselves should be faster than what we currently\n\
    \   achieve (transfer to BBN is faster!).  The probable reason for the\n   above\
    \ discrepancy is that our allocation (Host-Host protocol) is very\n   small (2944\
    \ bits) as compared to that provided by BBN (17724 bits).\n   This means that\
    \ to transfer data our Network Control Program (NCP)\n   has to wait for an allocation\
    \ many more times while communicating to\n   an ITS system than to a TENEX system.\
    \  Large allocations are always\n   desirable but even more so while transferring\
    \ files.  NCP designers\n   can (and should) modify NCP's to allow large allocates\
    \ (larger NCP\n   buffers) for file transfer even at the expense of smaller allocates\n\
    \   for other types of connections (such as a terminal connected to a\n   computer\
    \ system) which do not require or use the larger allocation.\n   In addition,\
    \ a new allocate should be sent as soon as data is read by\n   the receiving program\
    \ (the NCP should not wait for the allocation to\n   become zero before sending\
    \ the new allocate).\n   We also observed that small files are transferred at\
    \ a significantly\n   lower transfer rate than large files but beyond a file size\
    \ of 40\n   Kbits, the file size makes little difference in transfer rate or\n\
    \   processing cost per bit transferred.  The figure of 40 Kbits is\n   probably\
    \ related to the size of sending and receiving buffers used by\n   the programs.\
    \  In general, for most practical values of buffer size,\n   the larger the buffer\
    \ size and allocations, the faster and more\n   efficient will be the transfer.\
    \  Unfortunately, large NCP buffers are\n   not easily available in many systems\
    \ and come at a premium.  The\n   information on average file size (240 Kbits\
    \ for Image and 40 Kbits\n   for ASCII files) may be helpful in optimum allocation\
    \ of buffer\n   space.\n"
