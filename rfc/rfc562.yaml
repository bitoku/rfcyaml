  - "               Modifications to the TELNET Specification\n   Almost four months\
    \ have passed since the new TELNET Protocol\n   specification was published. \
    \ Since then, only two RFCs have been\n   issued suggesting modifications, and\
    \ the most recent of these was\n   distributed two months ago.  Further, the date\
    \ from the old TELNET to\n   the new TELNET (1 January 1974) is only four months\
    \ away.  It\n   therefore seems appropriate to officially modify the specification\
    \ to\n   account for the suggested modifications, and to declare a moratorium\n\
    \   on the incorporation of additional suggestions until after the\n   switchover.\
    \ (Of course, no moratorium on the specification of\n   additional options is\
    \ required.)\n   The two attached documents represent the revised TELNET Protocol\n\
    \   specifications; they replace NIC #15372, TELNET Protocol\n   Specification,\
    \ and NIC #15373, TELNET Option Specifications.  The\n   remainder of this RFC\
    \ summarizes the changes.  Page numbers refer to\n   the earlier documents.\n"
