  - "1.  Introduction\n   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling
    out their\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this time.\n
    \  This network will require more Resource-Priority namespaces than were\n   defined,
    and IANA registered, in RFC 4412 [RFC4412].  The purpose of\n   this document
    is to define these additional namespaces.  Each will be\n   preemptive in nature,
    as defined in RFC 4412, and will have the same\n   10 priority-values.\n   DISA
    has a requirement to be able to assign different Resource-\n   Priority namespaces
    to differing groups of differing sizes throughout\n   their networks.  Examples
    of this may be\n   - namespaces as large as each branch of service (Army, Navy,
    Air\n     Force, Marines, Coast Guard)\n   - namespaces for some departments within
    the government (for example,\n     Homeland Security)\n   - namespaces that are
    temporary assignments to individual units of\n     varying sizes (from battle
    groups to patrol groups or platoons)\n   These temporary assignments might be
    combinations of smaller units\n   involving several branches of service operating
    as one unit (say, one\n   task force, which is separate than the branch of service),
    or a\n   single commando unit requiring special treatment for a short period\n
    \  of time, making it appear separate from the branch of service they\n   are
    from.\n   Providing DISA with a pool of namespaces for fine-grained\n   assignment(s)
    allows them the flexibility they need for their mission\n   requirements.  One
    can imagine due to their sheer size and separation\n   of purpose, they can easily
    utilize a significant number of\n   namespaces within their networks.  This is
    the reason for the\n   assignment of so many new namespaces, which seems to deviate
    from\n   guidance in RFC 4412 to have as few namespaces as possible.\n   This
    document makes no changes to SIP, it just adds IANA-registered\n   namespaces
    for SIP's use within the Resource-Priority header\n   framework.\n"

  - "2.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created\n   The following 40 SIP namespaces
    are created by this document:\n   dsn-000000      drsn-000000      rts-000000
    \     crts-000000\n   dsn-000001      drsn-000001      rts-000001      crts-000001\n

    \     crts-000005\n   dsn-000006      drsn-000006      rts-000006      crts-000006\n
    \  dsn-000007      drsn-000007      rts-000007      crts-000007\n   dsn-000008
    \     drsn-000008      rts-000008      crts-000008\n   dsn-000009      drsn-000009
    \     rts-000009      crts-000009\n   Each namespace listed above is wholly different.
    \ However, according\n   to the rules within Section 8 of RFC 4412, one or more
    sets can be\n   treated as if they are the same when they are configured as an\n
    \  aggregated grouping of namespaces.\n   These aggregates of two or more namespaces,
    that are to be considered\n   equivalent during treatment, can be a set of any
    IANA registered\n   namespaces, not just adjacent (i.e., consecutive) namespaces.\n
    \  Each namespace listed above will have the same 10 priority levels:\n      .0
    (lowest priority)\n      .1\n      .2\n      .3\n      .4\n      .5\n      .6\n
    \     .7\n      .8\n      .9 (highest priority)\n   According to the rules established
    in RFC 4412 [RFC4412], priority-\n   values have a relative order for preferential
    treatment, unless one\n   or more consecutive groups of priority-values are to
    be considered\n   equivalent (i.e., first-received, first treated).\n   The dash
    character ('-') is just like any other ASCII character\n   within a namespace,
    and is not to be considered a delimiter in any\n   official way within any namespace
    here.  Other namespace definitions\n   in the future could change this.\n   As
    stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412] an IANA-registered\n   namespace SHOULD
    NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the\n   relative priority order, of
    its assigned priority-values.\n"
