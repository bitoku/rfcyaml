  - "3.  T.38 Definition\n   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [T.38] describes the technical
    features\n   necessary to transfer facsimile documents in real-time between two\n
    \  standard Group 3 facsimile terminals over the Internet or other\n   networks
    using IP protocols.  The Recommendation allows the use of\n   either TCP or UDP
    depending on the service environment.\n   ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [T.38] Annex
    D describes system level\n   requirements and procedures for internet aware facsimile\n
    \  implementations and internet aware facsimile gateways conforming to\n   ITU-T
    T.38 to establish calls with other ITU-T T.38 implementations\n   using the procedures
    defined in IETF RFC 2543 [SIP-99] and IETF RFC\n   2327 [SDP].\n   Note that ITU-T
    T.38 Recommendation T.38 (04/02) [T.38] is an\n   aggregation of the original
    ITU-T Recommendation T.38 (06/98) [T.38-\n   98] and all of the subsequent Amendments
    and Corrigendum including\n   [T.38D-00].  While [T.38] and [T.38D-00] describe
    SIP procedures per\n   [SIP-99], the procedures can also be applied to the revised
    Session\n   Initiation Protocol specification [SIP].\n"

      type is intended\n   to indicate a T.38 media stream in SDP.\n   This media
      type registration is not intended for email usage.\n"
