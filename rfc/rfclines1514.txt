Abstract This memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems.
The term "host" is construed to mean any computer that communicates with other similar computers attached to the internet and that is directly used by one or more human beings.
Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary function is communications services (e.g., terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is not explicitly precluded.
This MIB instruments attributes common to all internet hosts including, for example, both personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: STD 16, RFC 1155 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[2] defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] which defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
STD 15, RFC 1157 [4] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Within a given MIB module, objects are defined using STD 16, RFC 1212's OBJECT TYPE macro.
At a minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access level, and an implementation status.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1[5] language is used for this purpose.
However, RFC 1155 purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The access level of an object type defines whether it makes "protocol sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance of the object type.
(This access level is independent of any administrative authorization policy.)
The implementation status of an object type indicates whether the object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.
The Host Resources MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful for the management of host computers.
Host computers  are independent of the operating system, network services, or any software application.
The Host Resources MIB defines objects which are common across many computer system architectures.
In addition, there are objects in MIB II [3] which also provide host management functionality.
Implementation of the System and Interfaces groups is mandatory for implementors of the Host Resources MIB.
This textual convention is intended to identify the manufacturer,   model, and version of a specific hardware or software product.
It is suggested that these OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are allocated such   that all products from a particular manufacturer are registered   under a subtree distinct to that manufacturer.
In addition, all   versions of a product should be registered under a subtree   distinct to that product.
With this strategy, a management   station may uniquely determine the manufacturer and/or model of a   product whose productID is unknown to the management station.
Objects of this type may be useful for inventory purposes or for   automatically detecting incompatibilities or version mismatches   between various hardware and software components on a system.
For example, the product ID for the ACME 4860
66MHz clock doubled   processor might be:   enterprises.acme.acmeProcessors.a4860DX2.MHz66
A date time specification for the local time of day.
This data type is used to model textual information in some    character set.
A network management station should use a local    algorithm to determine which character set is in use and how it    should be displayed.
Note that this character set may be encoded    with more than one octet per symbol, but will most often be NVT    ASCII.
TimeTicks ACCESS read only STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The amount of time since this host was last initialized.
Note that this is different from sysUpTime in MIB II [3] because sysUpTime is the uptime of the network management portion of the system."
{ hrSystem 1 } hrSystemDate OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX DateAndTime
ACCESS read write STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
ACCESS read write STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"This object contains the parameters (e.g. a pathname and parameter) supplied to the load device when requesting the initial operating system configuration from that device."
"The number of user sessions for which this host is storing state information.
A session is a collection of processes requiring a single act of user authentication and possibly subject to collective job control."
"The maximum number of process contexts this system can support.
If there is no fixed maximum, the value should be zero.
On systems that have a fixed maximum, this object can help diagnose failures that occur when this maximum is reached."
Registration for some storage types, for use with hrStorageType hrStorageTypes
} hrMemorySize OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX KBytes ACCESS read only STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The amount of physical main memory contained by the host."
An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits.
The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information.
These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system.
Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table.
Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space').
This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures.
In addition, it can be a useful performance monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer usage."

ACCESS read only STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION "
A unique value for each logical storage area contained by the host."
The type of storage represented by this entry."
"A description of the type and instance of the storage described by this entry."
The size, in bytes, of the data objects allocated from this pool.
If this entry is monitoring sectors, blocks, buffers, or packets, for example, this number will commonly be greater than one.
Otherwise this number will typically be one."

Counter ACCESS read only STATUS mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The number of requests for storage represented by this entry that could not be honored due to not enough storage.
It should be noted that as this object has a SYNTAX of Counter, that it does not have a defined initial value.
However, it is recommended that this object be initialized to zero."
The device group is useful for identifying and diagnosing the   devices on a system.
The hrDeviceTable contains common   information for any type of device.
In addition, some devices   have device specific tables for more detailed information.
More   such tables may be defined in the future for other device types.

"This object represents any error conditions detected by the printer.
If multiple conditions are currently detected and the hrDeviceStatus would not otherwise be unknown(1) or testing(4), the hrDeviceStatus shall correspond to the worst state of those indicated, where down(5) is worse than warning(3) which is worse than running(2).
Bits are numbered starting with the most significant bit of the first byte being bit 0, the least significant bit of the first byte being bit 7, the most significant bit of the second byte being bit 8, and so on.
