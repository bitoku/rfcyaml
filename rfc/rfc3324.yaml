  - "1. Introduction\n   SIP [1] allows users to assert their identity in a number\
    \ of ways\n   e.g., using the From: header.  However, there is no requirement\
    \ for\n   these identities to be anything other than the users desired alias.\n\
    \   An authenticated identity of a user can be obtained using SIP Digest\n   Authentication\
    \ (or by other means).  However, UAs do not always have\n   the necessary key\
    \ information to authenticate another UA.\n   A Network Asserted Identity is an\
    \ identity initially derived by a SIP\n   network intermediary as a result of\
    \ an authentication process.  This\n   may or may not be based on SIP Digest authentication.\
    \  This document\n   describes short term requirements for the exchange of Network\n\
    \   Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected\n   trusted\
    \ nodes and also to User Agents with secure connections to such\n   networks.\n\
    \   Such a network is described in this document as a Trust Domain and we\n  \
    \ present a strict definition of trust and Trust Domain for the\n   purposes of\
    \ this document.  These short-term requirements provide\n   only for the exchange\
    \ of Network Asserted Identity within a Trust\n   Domain and to an entity directly\
    \ connected to the trust domain.\n   General requirements for transport of Network\
    \ Asserted Identities on\n   the Internet are out of scope of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1 Identity\n   An Identity, for the purposes of this document, is a sip:, sips:\
    \ or\n   tel:  URI, and optionally a Display Name.\n   The URI MUST be meaningful\
    \ to the domain identified in the URI (in\n   the case of sip: or sips: URIs)\
    \ or the owner of the E.164 number (in\n   the case of tel: URIs), in the sense\
    \ that when used as a SIP\n   Request-URI in a request sent to that domain/number\
    \ range owner, it\n   would cause the request to be routed to the user/line that\
    \ is\n   associated with the identity, or to be processed by service logic\n \
    \  running on that user's behalf.\n   If the URI is a sip: or sips: URI, then\
    \ depending on the local policy\n   of the domain identified in the URI, the URI\
    \ MAY identify some\n   specific entity, such as a person.\n   If the URI is a\
    \ tel: URI, then depending on the local policy of the\n   owner of the number\
    \ range within which the telephone number lies, the\n   number MAY identify some\
    \ specific entity, such as a telephone line.\n   However, it should be noted that\
    \ identifying the owner of the number\n   range is a less straightforward process\
    \ than identifying the domain\n   which owns a sip: or sips: URI.\n"
- title: 2.2 Network Asserted Identity
  contents:
  - "2.2 Network Asserted Identity\n   A Network Asserted Identity is an identity\
    \ derived by a SIP network\n   entity as a result of an authentication process,\
    \ which identifies the\n   authenticated entity in the sense defined in Section\
    \ 2.1.\n   In the case of a sip: or sips: URI, the domain included in the URI\n\
    \   MUST be within the Trust Domain.\n   In the case of a tel: URI, the owner\
    \ of the E.164 number in the URI\n   MUST be within the Trust Domain.\n   The\
    \ authentication process used, or at least it's reliability/\n   strength, is\
    \ a known feature of the Trust Domain using the Network\n   Asserted Identity\
    \ mechanism i.e., in the language of 2.3 below, it is\n   defined in Spec(T).\n"
- title: 2.3 Trust Domains
  contents:
  - "2.3 Trust Domains\n   A Trust Domain for the purposes of Network Asserted Identity\
    \ is a set\n   of SIP nodes (UAC, UAS, proxies or other network intermediaries)\
    \ that\n   are trusted to exchange Network  Asserted Identity information in the\n\
    \   sense described below.\n   A node can be a member of a Trust Domain, T, only\
    \ if the node is know\n   to be compliant to a certain set of specifications,\
    \ Spec(T), which\n   characterize the handling of Network Asserted Identity within\
    \ the\n   Trust Domain, T.\n   Trust Domains are constructed by human beings who\
    \ know the properties\n   of the equipment they are using/deploying.  In the simplest\
    \ case, a\n   Trust Domain is a set of devices with a single owner/operator who\
    \ can\n   accurately know the behaviour of those devices.\n   Such simple Trust\
    \ Domains may be joined into larger Trust Domains by\n   bi-lateral agreements\
    \ between the owners/operators of the devices.\n   We say a node is 'trusted'\
    \ (with respect to a given Trust Domain) if\n   and only if it is a member of\
    \ that domain.\n   We say that a node, A, in the domain is 'trusted by' a node,\
    \ B, (or\n   'B trusts A') if and only if:\n      1.  there is a secure connection\
    \ between the nodes, AND\n      2.  B has configuration information indicating\
    \ that A is a member\n          of the Trust Domain.\n   Note that B may or may\
    \ not be a member of the Trust Domain.  For\n   example, B may be a UA which trusts\
    \ a given network intermediary, A\n   (e.g., its home proxy).\n   A 'secure connection'\
    \ in this context means that messages cannot be\n   read by third parties, cannot\
    \ be modified by third parties without\n   detection and that B can be sure that\
    \ the message really did come\n   from A.  The level of security required is a\
    \ feature of the Trust\n   Domain i.e., it is defined in Spec(T).\n   Within this\
    \ context, SIP signaling information received by one node\n   FROM a node that\
    \ it trusts is known to have been generated and passed\n   through the network\
    \ according to the procedures of the particular\n   specification set Spec(T),\
    \ and therefore can be known to be valid, or\n   at least as valid as specified\
    \ in the specifications Spec(T).\n   Equally, a node can be sure that signaling\
    \ information passed TO a\n   node that it trusts will be handled according to\
    \ the procedures of\n   Spec(T).\n   For these capabilities to be useful, Spec(T)\
    \ must contain\n   requirements as to how the Network Asserted Identity is generated,\n\
    \   how its privacy is protected and how its integrity is maintained as\n   it\
    \ is passed around the network.  A reader of Spec(T) can then make\n   an informed\
    \ judgement about the authenticity and reliability of\n   Network Asserted Information\
    \ received from the Trust Domain T.\n   The term 'trusted' (with respect to a\
    \ given Trust Domain) can be\n   applied to a given node in an absolute sense\
    \ - it is just equivalent\n   to saying the node is a member of the Trust Domain.\
    \  However, the\n   node itself does not know whether another arbitrary node is\n\
    \   'trusted', even within the Trust Domain.  It does know about certain\n   nodes\
    \ with which it has secure connections as described above.\n   With the definition\
    \ above, statements such as 'A trusted node SHALL\n   ...' are just shorthand\
    \ for 'A node compliant to this specification\n   SHALL...'.\n   Statements such\
    \ as 'When a node receives information from a trusted\n   node...' are NOT valid,\
    \ because one node does not have complete\n   knowledge about all the other nodes\
    \ in the trust domain.\n   Statements such as 'When a node receives information\
    \ from another\n   node that it trusts...' ARE valid, and should be interpreted\n\
    \   according to the criteria (1) and (2) above.\n   The above relationships are\
    \ illustrated in the following figure:\n                                     \

    \ containing a\n   Network Asserted Identity that this Network Asserted Identity\
    \ is\n   subject to a privacy requirement which prevents it being passed to\n\
    \   other users.  This indication should not carry any semantics as to\n   the\
    \ reason for this privacy requirement.\n   It shall be possible to indicate that\
    \ the user has requested that the\n   Network Asserted Identity be not passed\
    \ to other users.  This is\n   distinct from the above indication, in that it\
    \ implies specific user\n   intent with respect to the Network Asserted Identity.\n\
    \   The mechanism shall support Trust Domain policies where the above two\n  \
    \ indications are equivalent (i.e., the only possible reason for a\n   privacy\
    \ requirement is a request from the user), and policies where\n   they are not.\n\
    \   In this case, the Network Asserted Identity specification shall\n   require\
    \ that the mechanism of Section 4.3 SHALL NOT be used i.e., a\n   trusted node\
    \ shall not pass the identity to a node it does not trust.\n   However, the mechanism\
    \ of Section 4.3 MAY be used to transfer the\n   identity within the trusted network.\n\
    \   Note that 'anonymity' requests from users or subscribers may well\n   require\
    \ functionality in addition to the above handling of Network\n   Asserted Identities.\
    \  Such additional functionality is out of the\n   scope of this document.\n"

  - "8. Security Considerations\n   The requirements in this document are NOT intended\
    \ to result in a\n   mechanism with general applicability between arbitrary hosts\
    \ on the\n   Internet.\n   Rather, the intention is to state requirements for\
    \ a mechanism to be\n   used within a community of devices which are known to\
    \ obey the\n   specification of the mechanism (Spec(T)) and between which there\
    \ are\n   secure connections.  Such a community is known here as a Trust\n   Domain.\n\
    \   The requirements on the mechanisms used for security and to initially\n  \
    \ derive the Network Asserted Identity must be part of the\n   specification Spec(T).\n\
    \   The requirements also support the transfer of information from a node\n  \
    \ within the Trust Domain, via a secure connection to a node outside\n   the Trust\
    \ Domain.\n   Use of this mechanism in any other context has serious security\n\
