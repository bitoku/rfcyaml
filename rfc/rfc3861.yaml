  - "1.  Introduction\n   Presence and instant messaging are defined in RFC 2778 [5].
    \ The\n   Common Profiles for Presence (CPP) [2] and Instant Messaging (CPIM)\n
    \  [1] define two Universal Resource Identifier (URI) schemes: 'im' for\n   INSTANT
    INBOXes and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES.  This document provides\n   rules for locating
    the resources associated with URIs that employ\n   these schemes via the Domain
    Name Service (DNS) [4].  These rules\n   could no doubt be applied to the resolution
    of other URI schemes that\n   are unrelated to instant messaging and presence.\n
    \  CPIM and CPP both specify operations that have 'source' and\n   'destination'
    attributes.  While only the semantics, not the syntax,\n   of these attributes
    are defined by CPIM and CPP, many instant\n   messaging and presence protocols
    today support the use of URIs to\n   reflect the source and destination of their
    operations.  The 'im' and\n   'pres' URI schemes allow such protocols to express
    the identities of\n   the principals associated with a protocol exchange.  When
    these\n   operations pass through a CPIM or CPP gateway, these URIs could be\n
    \  relayed without modification, which has a number of desirable\n   properties
    for the purposes of interoperability.\n   These URI schemes are also useful in
    cases where no CPIM/CPP\n   gatewaying will occur.  If a particular principal's
    endpoint supports\n   multiple instant messaging applications, for example, then
    a domain\n   that identifies that host might use the sort of DNS records described\n
    \  in this document to provide greater compatibility with clients that\n   support
    only one instant messaging protocol.  A client would look up\n   the corresponding
    record to the supported protocol, and learn how to\n   contact the endpoint for
    that protocol.  The principal in this\n   instance would use an IM URI as their
    canonical address.\n   In some architectures, these URIs might also be used to
    locate a CPIM\n   or CPP gateway that serves a particular domain.  If a particular
    IM\n   service provider wishes to operate CPIM/CPP gateways in its own\n   domain
    that map standard Internet protocols to an internal\n   proprietary protocol,
    that gateway could be identified by an IM URI.\n   In that case, the DNS records
    used to dereference the IM URI would\n   serve a purpose similar to that of Mail
    Exchange (MX) records.\n   The system described in this document relies on the
    use of DNS\n   service (SRV) [7] records and address (A) records.\n"

    \  \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as\n   described
    in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [3] and indicate requirement levels for\n   compliant implementations.\n
    \  This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in RFC 2778 [5].  Terms\n   such
    as CLOSED, INSTANT INBOX, INSTANT MESSAGE, and OPEN are used in\n   the same meaning
    as defined therein.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology

  - "3.  Address Resolution\n   A client determines the address of an appropriate
    system running a\n   server, on behalf of the system referenced by the domain,
    by\n   resolving the destination domain name that is part of the identifier\n
    \  to either an intermediate relay system or a final target system.\n   Only resolvable,
    fully-qualified, domain names (FQDNs) are permitted\n   when domain names are
    used in an Instant Messaging (IM) URI (i.e.,\n   domain names that can be resolved
    to SRV [7] or A Resource Record\n   (RR)).\n   The symbolic name used in the Service
    field of the SRV record is\n   \"_im\" for instant messaging and \"_pres\" for
    presence (matching their\n   respective URI schemes).  However, the advertisement
    of these\n   services in the DNS is incomplete if it does not include the protocol\n
    \  that will be used to instantiate the instant messaging or presence\n   operations.
    \ Thus, the Protocol field of the SRV record contains an\n   IANA-registered label
    corresponding to the underlying instant\n   messaging or presence protocol being
    advertised (see Section 8 for\n   more information on valid Protocol fields).\n
    \  Taking the IM URI as a concrete example, a lookup is performed for\n   SRVs
    for the target domain, a desired service (using the \"_im\"\n   Service label)
    and a desired IM transfer protocol.  If the\n   destination INSTANT INBOX is \"im:fred@example.com\",
    and the sender\n   wishes to use an IM transfer protocol called \"BIP\" (and supposing\n
    \  \"_bip\" were registered with IANA as a valid Protocol label for the IM\n   Service),
    then a SRV lookup is performed for:\n   _im._bip.example.com.\n   The same procedure
    is used for PRES URIs, with the \"_pres\" Service\n   label.\n   Some clients
    may support multiple instant messaging or presence\n   protocols; in these cases
    they may make several such SRV queries, in\n   an application-specific order,
    until they find one supported in\n   common with the target domain.\n"
  title: 3.  Address Resolution
- contents:
  - "4.  Domain Name Lookup\n   Once a client lexically identifies a domain to which
    instant\n   messaging or presence operations will be delivered for processing,
    a\n   DNS lookup MUST be performed to resolve the domain.  The names MUST\n   be
    fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) -- mechanisms for inferring\n   FQDNs from
    partial names or local aliases are a local matter.\n   The lookup first attempts
    to locate SRV RRs associated with the\n   domain.  If a canonical name (CNAME)
    RR is found instead, the\n   resulting domain is processed as if it were the initial
    domain.\n   If one or more SRV RRs are found for a given domain, a sender MUST\n
    \  NOT utilize any A RRs associated with that domain unless they are\n   located
    using the SRV RRs.  If no SRV RRs are found, but an A RR is\n   found, then the
    A RR is treated as if it was associated with an\n   implicit SRV RR, with a preference
    of 0, pointing to that domain.\n"
  title: 4.  Domain Name Lookup
- contents:
  - "5.  Processing SRV RRs\n   The returned DNS RRs, if any, specify the next-hop
    server, which may\n   be a protocol gateway or an endpoint.\n   Receiving systems
    that are registered for this DNS-based SRV\n   resolution service list the transfer
    protocols by which they can be\n   reached, either directly or through a translating
    gateway (using\n   combinations of Service and Protocol labels as described above).
    \ The\n   transfer-time choice of the IM transfer protocol to be used (and,\n
    \  therefore, to be resolved) is a local configuration option for each\n   sending
    system.\n   Using this mechanism, seamless routing of IM traffic is possible,\n
    \  regardless of whether a gateway is necessary for interoperation.  To\n   achieve
    this transparency, a separate RR for a gateway must be\n   present for each transfer
    protocol and domain pair that it serves.\n"
  title: 5.  Processing SRV RRs
- contents:
  - "6.  Processing Multiple Addresses\n   When the lookup succeeds, the mapping can
    result in a list of\n   alternative delivery addresses rather than a single address,
    because\n   of multiple SRV records.  For reliable operations, the client MUST
    be\n   able to try each of the relevant addresses in this list in order,\n   until
    a delivery attempt succeeds.  However, there MAY also be a\n   configurable limit
    on the number of alternate addresses that can be\n   tried.  In any case, the
    client SHOULD try at least two addresses.\n   Resolvers must follow the standard
    procedures in RFC 2782 [7] for\n   handling the priority and weight fields of
    SRV records.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The usage of IM and PRES URIs, and the DNS procedures
    in this\n   document, introduce no security considerations beyond those described\n
    \  in the requirements for instant messaging and presence ([6]) and the\n   SRV
    specification ([7]).\n   Subsequent registrations of Protocol labels for use with
    the \"_im\" or\n   \"_pres\" Service labels MUST, however, explain any security\n
    \  considerations that arise from the use of the protocol in question\n   with
    SRV.\n"
  title: 7.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   This document reserves the use of \"_im\" and \"_pres\"
    Service labels.\n   Since these relate to a service which may pass messages over
    a number\n   of different message transports, they must be associated with a\n
    \  specific instant messaging or presence service.\n   In order to ensure that
    the association between \"_im\" and \"_pres\" and\n   their respective underlying
    services are deterministic, the IANA has\n   created two independent registries:
    the Instant Messaging SRV\n   Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol
    Label registry.\n   For each registry, an entry shall consist of a label name
    and a\n   pointer to a specification describing how the protocol named in the\n
    \  label uses SRV.  Specifications should conform to the requirements\n   listed
    in RFC 2434 [8] for \"specification required\".\n   Protocol labels compliant
    with this specification MUST begin with the\n   underscore character \"_\" and
    follow all other rules for SRV Protocol\n   labels described in [7].\n"
