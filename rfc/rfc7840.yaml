- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   For cases where location servers have access to emergency routing\n\
    \   information, they are able to return routing information with the\n   location\
    \ information if the location request includes a request for\n   the desired routing\
    \ information.  This document specifies an\n   extension to the HTTP-Enabled Location\
    \ Delivery (HELD) protocol that\n   updates RFC 5985 to support this function.\
    \  Allowing location and\n   routing information to be acquired in a single request\
    \ response\n   exchange updates RFC 6881, as current location acquisition and\
    \ route\n   determination procedures are separate operations.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The general Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technology\n\
    \   (ECRIT) calling models described in [RFC6443] and [RFC6881] require a\n  \
    \ local Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) server or network of\n   forest\
    \ guides in order to determine the address of the Public Safety\n   Answering\
    \ Point (PSAP) in the best position to handle a call.\n   Networks of forest guides\
    \ have not materialized and while PSAPs are\n   moving towards IP networks, LoST\
    \ server deployment is not ubiquitous.\n   Some regions and countries have expressed\
    \ reluctance to deploy LoST\n   servers making aspects of the current ECRIT architecture\
    \ hard to\n   realize.\n   To address regulatory requirements, such as [M493],\
    \ evolving\n   architectures in Europe couple location and routing information\
    \ in\n   the access network while using a softswitch-centric approach to\n   emergency\
    \ call processing.  This document describes an extension to\n   the HELD protocol\
    \ [RFC5985], so that a location information server\n   can provide emergency routing\
    \ information in the absence of a LoST\n   server or network of forest guides.\n"

    \   describes two main models for emergency call processing.  The first\n   is\
    \ a device-centric model, where a device obtains location\n   information using\
    \ a location configuration protocol, such as HELD\n   [RFC5985], and then proceeds\
    \ to determine the address of the next hop\n   closer to the local PSAP using\
    \ LoST [RFC5222].  Figure 1 shows this\n   model in a simplified form.\n     \

    \ Calling Model\n   In the softswitch-centric model, when a VSP receives an emergency\n\
    \   call, it performs two tasks.  The first task is to determine the\n   correct\
    \ LIS to ask for location information; this is done using a\n   combination of\
    \ reverse DNS lookup described in [RFC7216] to acquire\n   the serving domain\
    \ name and then using [RFC5986] to determine the LIS\n   URI.  Once the location\
    \ is obtained from the LIS, the VSP determines\n   the LoST server associated\
    \ with the domain serving the caller and\n   queries it for the correct PSAP address.\n\
    \   LoST server discovery is a domain-based activity, similar to the LIS\n   discovery\
    \ technique.  However, unlike the LIS that is a domain-bound\n   service, a LoST\
    \ server is a geographically bound service.  This means\n   that for a domain\
    \ that spans multiple geographic regions, the LoST\n   server determined may not\
    \ be able to provide a route to the necessary\n   PSAP.  When this occurs, the\
    \ contacted LoST server invokes the help\n   of other LoST servers, and this requires\
    \ the deployment of forest\n   guides.\n   At the time of writing, several countries\
    \ have expressed a reluctance\n   to deploy public LoST servers.  In countries\
    \ amenable to the use of\n   LoST and forest guides, no public forest guides have\
    \ been deployed.\n   There appears to be little interest from the public sector\
    \ in\n   establishing a global forest-guide network.  These issues pose\n   threats\
    \ to the ability of both the device-centric and the softswitch-\n   centric calling\
    \ approaches to operate everywhere.\n   The device-centric and softswitch-centric\
    \ calling models both involve\n   the notion of a LIS bound to the serving access\
    \ network.  In many\n   cases, the LIS already knows the destination PSAP URI\
    \ for any given\n   location.  In [RFC6881], for example, the LIS validates civic\n\
    \   locations using a location validation procedure based on the LoST\n   protocol\
    \ [RFC5222].  The LoST validation request is similar to a LoST\n   routing request\
    \ and provides the LIS with the same PSAP routing\n   information that a routing\
    \ request would.  In other cases, the LIS\n   knows the correct PSAP for a given\
    \ location at provisioning time, or\n   the access network might always route\
    \ to the same emergency provider.\n   Irrespective of the way in which the LIS\
    \ learns the PSAP URI for a\n   location, the LIS will, in a great many cases,\
    \ already have this\n   information.\n   This document specifies an extension\
    \ to the HELD protocol, so that\n   emergency routing information can be requested\
    \ from the LIS at the\n   same time that location information is requested.  This\
    \ document\n   updates [RFC6881] by requiring devices and softswitches that\n\
    \   understand this specification to always request routing information\n   to\
    \ avoid the risk of query failure where no LoST server or forest-\n   guide network\
    \ is deployed.\n"
- title: 3.1.  LoST Reuse Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  LoST Reuse Considerations\n   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] defines a <mapping>\
    \ element that\n   describes a service region and associated service URLs.  Reusing\
    \ this\n   element from LoST to provide the routing URIs was considered.\n   However,\
    \ this would have meant that several of the mandatory\n   components in the <mapping>\
    \ element would have had to contain\n   ambiguous or misleading values.  Specifically,\
    \ the \"source\" attribute\n   is required to contain a LoST application-unique\
    \ string for the\n   authoritative server.  However, in the situations described\
    \ in this\n   specification, there may not be an authoritative LoST server, so\
    \ any\n   value put into this attribute would be misleading.  In addition to\n\
    \   this, routing information received in the manner described in this\n   specification\
    \ should not be cached by the receiver, so detailing when\n   the routing information\
    \ expires or was last updated is irrelevant.\n"
- title: 4.  Mechanism
  contents:
  - "4.  Mechanism\n   The mechanism consists of adding an element to the HELD\n \
    \  locationRequest and an element to the locationResponse.\n   The request element\
    \ indicates that the requestor wants the LIS to\n   provide routing information\
    \ based on the location of the end device.\n   If the routing request is sent\
    \ with no attribute, then URIs for\n   urn:service:sos are returned.  If the requestor\
    \ wants routing\n   information for a specific service, then they may include\
    \ an optional\n   service URN.  This service MUST exist in the IANA \"Service\
    \ URN\n   Labels\" repository created by [RFC5031].  If a service is specified,\n\
    \   and the LIS does not understand the requested service, then URIs for\n   urn:service:sos\
    \ are returned.\n   If the LIS understands the routing request and has routing\n\
    \   information for the location, then it includes the information in a\n   routingInformation\
    \ element returned in the locationResponse.  How the\n   LIS obtains this information\
    \ is left to implementation.\n   Possibilities are described in Section 3.\n \
    \  A LIS that does not understand the routing request element ignores it\n   and\
    \ returns the location information in the normal manner.\n   A LIS that does support\
    \ the routing request element MUST support\n   returning URIs for urn:service:sos\
    \ and any regionally defined sub-\n   services while following the URN traversal\
    \ rules defined in\n   [RFC5031].\n   A LIS that does understand the routing request\
    \ element but can't\n   obtain any routing information for the end-device's location\
    \ MUST set\n   the defaultRoute attribute to \"true\" and return a default PSAP\
    \ or\n   gateway URI along with the determined location information in the\n \
    \  locationResponse.\n   A LIS that understands the routing request element but\
    \ not the\n   specified service URN MUST follow the URN traversal rules defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC5031].\n   A LIS that receives a request for emergency routing information\
    \ that\n   it understands MUST return the correct emergency routing information\n\
    \   if it has or is able to acquire the routing information for the\n   location\
    \ of the target device.\n   The routing information in the location response consists\
    \ of a\n   service element identified by a service name.  The service name is\
    \ a\n   URN and might contain a general emergency service URN such as\n   urn:service:sos\
    \ or a specific service URN depending on what was\n   requested and what the LIS\
    \ is able to provide.  A list of one or more\n   service destinations is provided\
    \ for the service name.  Each\n   destination is expressed as a URI, and each\
    \ URI scheme should only\n   appear once in this list.  The routing URIs are intended\
    \ to be used\n   at the time they are received.  To avoid any risks of using stale\n\
    \   routing URIs, the values MUST NOT be cached by the receiving entity.\n"
- title: 5.  Modification to Phone BCP
  contents:
  - "5.  Modification to Phone BCP\n   This section describes the normative updates\
    \ to Phone BCP [RFC6881].\n   It is important for devices and intermediaries to\
    \ take all steps\n   possible to ensure that emergency calls are routed to the\
    \ correct\n   PSAP.  An alternative to providing routing information via global\n\
    \   forest guides or local LoST servers is for local networks to\n   configure\
    \ the PSAP address information in the network location\n   server.  This specification\
    \ updates Phone BCP [RFC6881] to provide\n   this option.  The update requires\
    \ devices and intermediaries using\n   the HELD protocol to always include the\
    \ HELD routing extension.  If\n   the LIS is configured with the routing information,\
    \ it can provide\n   it; if it is not, then the device or intermediary tries LoST\
    \ to\n   acquire the PSAP URI.\n   Section 6.5 of [RFC6881] defines \"End System\
    \ Location Configuration\".\n   Requirement ED-23/INT-18/SP-14 is updated when\
    \ HELD is used as the\n   Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) such that \"the\
    \ request MUST\n   include the requestRoutingInformation element.\"  The remainder\
    \ of the\n   requirement remains unchanged.\n   This document adds a new requirement\
    \ to Section 7 of [RFC6881].\n   \"ED-51a : Endpoints MUST support the HELD requestRoutingInformation\n\
    \   element and be able to interpret and use any routing information\n   returned\
    \ in the locationResponse.\"\n   This document adds two new requirements to Section\
    \ 8 of [RFC6881].\n   \"ED-52a : Endpoints that acquire routing information in\
    \ a HELD\n   locationResponse SHOULD use this routing information but MAY perform\n\
    \   a LoST findService request if they have a location value.\"\n   \"ED-52b :\
    \ Endpoints that acquire routing information in a HELD\n   locationResponse with\
    \ a defaultRoute attribute of \"true\" MUST perform\n   a LoST findService request\
    \ if they have a location value.  If a route\n   is provided by the LoST server,\
    \ then this route MUST be used,\n   otherwise the routing information provided\
    \ in the HELD response\n   SHOULD be used.\"\n   This document amends SP-26 from\
    \ Section 8 of [RFC6881] such that a\n   LoST mapping need not be requested if\
    \ non-default routing information\n   is provided in the HELD locationResponse.\n"

    \ considerations\n   beyond those already described in [RFC5985].  It does, however,\n\
    \   extend those described in [RFC6155].\n   [RFC5985] describes the privacy considerations\
    \ surrounding the HELD\n   location configuration protocol, and this document\
    \ makes no specific\n   changes to these considerations.\n   [RFC6155] extends\
    \ HELD beyond a simple LCP by enabling authorized\n   third parties to acquire\
    \ location information and describing the\n   issues in Section 4.  The HELD routing\
    \ extension supports returning\n   URIs that represent specific services operating\
    \ in the Target's\n   vicinity.  This represents additional information about\
    \ the Target;\n   as a consequence, it is recommended that this option only be\
    \ used\n   when the LIS returns a location URI, not a location value.\n"
