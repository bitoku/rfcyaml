  - "1.  Introduction\n   [IS-IS] specifies the IS-IS protocol (ISO 10589) with extensions
    to\n   support IPv4 in [RFC1195].  A router advertises one or several Link\n   State
    Protocol data units that are composed of variable length tuples\n   called TLVs
    (Type-Length-Value).\n   [RFC3784] defines a set of new TLVs whose aims are to
    add more\n   information about links characteristics, increase the range of IS-IS\n
    \  metrics, and optimize the encoding of IS-IS prefixes.\n   This document defines
    a new sub-TLV named \"Link-attributes\" carried\n   within the extended IS reachability
    TLV (type 22) specified in\n   [RFC3784].\n"

    - "1.1  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
      2119 [RFC2119].\n"
    title: 1.1  Terminology
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Link-Attributes Sub-TLV Format\n   The link-attribute sub-TLV is carried
    within the TLV 22 and has a\n   format identical to the sub-TLV format used by
    the Traffic\n   Engineering Extensions for IS-IS ([RFC3784]): 1 octet of sub-type,
    1\n   octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV followed by the\n   value
    field -- in this case, a 16 bit flags field.\n   The Link-attribute sub-type is
    19 and the link-attribute has a length\n   of 2 octets.\n   This sub-TLV is OPTIONAL
    and MUST appear at most once for a single IS\n   neighbor.  If a received Link
    State Packet (LSP) contains more than\n   one Link-Attribute Sub-TLV, an implementation
    SHOULD decide to\n   consider only the first encountered instance.\n   The following
    bits are defined:\n   Local Protection Available (0x01).  When set, this indicates
    that the\n   link is protected by means of some local protection mechanism (e.g.,\n
    \  [RFC4090]).\n   Link excluded from local protection path (0x02).  When set,
    this link\n   SHOULD not be included in any computation of a repair path by any\n
    \  other router in the routing area.  The triggers for setting up this\n   bit
    are out of the scope of this document.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting This Capability\n   A router
    not supporting the link-attribute sub-TLV will just silently\n   ignore this sub-TLV.\n"
  title: 3.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting This Capability
- contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned codepoint 19 for the link-attribute
    sub-TLV defined\n   in this document and carried within TLV 22.\n   IANA has created
    a registry for bit values inside the link-attributes\n   sub-TLV.  The initial
    contents of this registry are as follows\n     Value   Name                                 Reference\n
    \    -----   ----                                 ---------\n     0x1     Local
    Protection Available           [RFC5029]\n     0x2     Link Excluded from Local
    Protection  [RFC5029]\n   Further values are to be allocated by the Standards
    Action process\n   defined in [RFC2434], with Early Allocation (defined in [RFC4020])\n
    \  permitted.\n"
  title: 4.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Any new security issues raised by the procedures
    in this document\n   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and modified,
    the\n   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.  As the LSPs may now\n
    \  contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this\n   new
    information would also become available to an attacker.\n   Specifications based
    on this mechanism need to describe the security\n   considerations around the
    disclosure and modification of their\n   information.  Note that an integrity
    mechanism, such as one defined\n   in [RFC3567], should be applied if there is
    high risk resulting from\n   the modification of capability information.\n"
