  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5066 [RFC5066] defines two MIB modules:\n      EFM-CU-MIB,\
    \ with a set of objects for managing 10PASS-TS and\n      2BASE-TL Ethernet in\
    \ the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces;\n      IF-CAP-STACK-MIB, with a set\
    \ of objects describing cross-connect\n      capability of a managed device with\
    \ multi-layer (stacked)\n      interfaces, extending the stack management objects\
    \ in the\n      Interfaces Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.\n\
    \   With the conclusion of the [HUBMIB] working group, the responsibility\n  \
    \ for the maintenance and further development of a MIB module for\n   managing\
    \ 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS interfaces has been transferred to\n   the Institute\
    \ of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3\n   [IEEE802.3] working\
    \ group.  In 2011, the IEEE developed the\n   IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB module, based\
    \ on the original EFM-CU-MIB module\n   [RFC5066].  The current revision of IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB\
    \ is defined in\n   IEEE Std 802.3.1-2013 [IEEE802.3.1].\n   The IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB\
    \ and EFM-CU-MIB MIB modules can coexist.\n   Existing deployments of the EFM-CU-MIB\
    \ need not be upgraded, but\n   operators using the MIB should expect that new\
    \ equipment will use the\n   IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB.\n   Please note that the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB\
    \ module was not transferred to\n   IEEE and remains as defined in RFC 5066. \
    \ This memo provides an\n   updated security considerations section for that module,\
    \ since the\n   original RFC did not list any security considerations for\n  \
    \ IF-CAP-STACK-MIB.\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\

- title: 3.  Mapping between EFM-CU-MIB and IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB
  contents:
  - "3.  Mapping between EFM-CU-MIB and IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB\n   The current version\
    \ of IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB, defined in IEEE Std\n   802.3.1-2013, has MODULE-IDENTITY\
    \ of ieee8023efmCuMIB with an object\n   identifier allocated under the { iso(1)\n\
    \   iso-identified-organization(3) ieee(111)\n   standards-association-numbered-series-standards(2)\
    \ lan-man-stds(802)\n   ieee802dot3(3) ieee802dot3dot1mibs(1) } sub-tree.\n  \
    \ The EFM-CU-MIB has MODULE-IDENTITY of efmCuMIB with an object\n   identifier\
    \ allocated under the mib-2 sub-tree.\n   The names of the objects in the first\
    \ version of the\n   IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB are identical to those in the EFM-CU-MIB.\n\
    \   However, since both MIB modules have different OID values, they can\n   coexist,\
    \ allowing the management of the newer IEEE MIB-based devices\n   alongside the\
    \ legacy IETF MIB-based devices.\n"
- title: 4.  Updating the MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Updating the MIB Modules\n   With the transfer of the responsibility for\
    \ maintenance and further\n   development of the EFM-CU-MIB module to the IEEE\
    \ 802.3 working group,\n   the EFM-CU-MIB defined in RFC 5066 becomes the last\
    \ version of that\n   MIB module.\n   All further development of the EFM Copper\
    \ Interfaces MIB will be done\n   by the IEEE 802.3 working group in the IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB\
    \ module.\n   Requests and comments pertaining to EFM Copper Interfaces MIB should\n\
    \   be sent to the IEEE 802.3.1 task force, currently chartered with MIB\n   development,\
    \ via its mailing list [LIST802.3.1].\n   The IF-CAP-STACK-MIB remains under IETF\
    \ control and is currently\n   maintained by the [OPSAWG] working group.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are no managed objects defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB\
    \ module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if\n\
    \   this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that\n   an\
    \ intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB\n   module via\
    \ direct SNMP SET operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module\
    \ (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered\
    \ sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\n   In particular,\
    \ ifCapStackStatus and ifInvCapStackStatus can identify\n   cross-connect capability\
    \ of multi-layer (stacked) network interfaces,\n   potentially revealing the underlying\
    \ hardware architecture of the\n   managed device.\n   It is thus important to\
    \ control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to\n   these objects and possibly to even\
    \ encrypt the values of these\n   objects when sending them over the network via\
    \ SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n\
    \   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there\
    \ is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET\
    \ (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   Implementations\
    \ SHOULD provide the security features described by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard\
    \ MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy via the User-based\
    \ Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].\
    \  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model\
    \ (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592]\
    \ or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3\
    \ is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n\
    \   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB\
    \ module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those\
    \ principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
