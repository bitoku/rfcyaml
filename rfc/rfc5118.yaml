- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   This document is informational, and is *not normative* on any\
    \ aspect\n   of SIP.\n   This document contains test messages based on the current\
    \ version\n   (2.0) of the Session Initiation Protocol as defined in [RFC3261].\n\
    \   This document is expected to be used as a companion document to the\n   more\
    \ general SIP torture test document [RFC4475], which does not\n   include specific\
    \ tests for IPv6 network identifiers.\n   This document does not attempt to catalog\
    \ every way to make an\n   invalid message, nor does it attempt to be comprehensive\
    \ in exploring\n   unusual, but valid, messages.  Instead, it tries to focus on\
    \ areas\n   that may cause interoperability problems in IPv6 deployments.\n"
- title: 2.  Document Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Document Conventions\n   This document contains many examples of SIP messages\
    \ with IPv6\n   network identifiers.  The appendix contains an encoded binary\
    \ form\n   containing the bit-exact representation of all the messages and the\n\
    \   script needed to decode them into separate files.\n   The IPv6 addresses used\
    \ in this document correspond to the 2001:\n   DB8::/32 address prefix reserved\
    \ for documentation [RFC3489].\n   Likewise, the IPv4 addresses used in this document\
    \ correspond to the\n   192.0.2.0/24 address block as described in [RFC3330].\n\
    \   Although SIP is a text-based protocol, some of these examples cannot\n   be\
    \ unambiguously rendered without additional markup due to the\n   constraints\
    \ placed on the formatting of RFCs.  This document uses the\n   <allOneLine/>\
    \ markup convention established in [RFC4475] to avoid\n   ambiguity and meet the\
    \ Internet-Draft layout requirements.  For the\n   sake of completeness, the text\
    \ defining this markup from Section 2.1\n   of [RFC4475] is reproduced in its\
    \ entirety below:\n      Several of these examples contain unfolded lines longer\
    \ than 72\n      characters.  These are captured between <allOneLine/> tags. \
    \ The\n      single unfolded line is reconstructed by directly concatenating\n\
    \      all lines appearing between the tags (discarding any line feeds or\n  \
    \    carriage returns).  There will be no whitespace at the end of\n      lines.\
    \  Any whitespace appearing at a fold-point will appear at\n      the beginning\
    \ of a line.\n      The following represent the same string of bits:\n      Header-name:\
    \ first value, reallylongsecondvalue, third value\n         <allOneLine>\n   \
    \      Header-name: first value,\n          reallylongsecondvalue\n         ,\
    \ third value\n         </allOneLine>\n         <allOneLine>\n         Header-name:\
    \ first value,\n          reallylong\n         second\n         value,\n     \
    \     third value\n         </allOneLine>\n      Note that this is NOT SIP header-line\
    \ folding, where different\n      strings of bits have equivalent meaning.\n"
- title: 3.  SIP and IPv6 Network Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.  SIP and IPv6 Network Configuration\n   System-level issues like deploying\
    \ a dual-stack proxy server,\n   populating DNS with A and AAAA Resource Records\
    \ (RRs), zero-\n   configuration discovery of outbound proxies for IPv4 and IPv6\n\
    \   networks, when a dual-stack proxy should Record-Route itself, and\n   media\
    \ issues also play a major part in the transition to IPv6.  This\n   document\
    \ does not, however, address these issues.  Instead, a\n   companion document\
    \ [sip-trans] provides more guidance on these\n   issues.\n"
- title: 4.  Parser Torture Tests
  contents:
  - "4.  Parser Torture Tests\n   The test messages are organized into several sections.\
    \  Some stress\n   only the SIP parser and others stress both the parser and the\n\
    \   application above it.  Some messages are valid and some are not.\n   Each\
    \ example clearly calls out what makes any invalid messages\n   incorrect.\n \
    \  Please refer to the complete Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) in\n   [RFC3261]\
    \ on representing IPv6 references in SIP messages.  IPv6\n   references are delimited\
    \ by a \"[\" and \"]\".  When an IPv6 reference is\n   part of a SIP Uniform Resource\
    \ Identifier (URI), RFC 3261 mandates\n   that the \"IPv6reference\" production\
    \ rule be used to recognize tokens\n   that comprise an IPv6 reference.  More\
    \ specifically, the ABNF states\n   the following:\n     SIP-URI        =  \"\
    sip:\" [ userinfo ] hostport\n                       uri-parameters [ headers\
    \ ]\n     hostport       =  host [ \":\" port ]\n     host           =  hostname\
    \ / IPv4address / IPv6reference\n     IPv4address    =  1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT\
    \ \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT\n     IPv6reference  =  \"[\" IPv6address \"]\"\
    \n     IPv6address    =  hexpart [ \":\" IPv4address ]\n     hexpart        =\
    \  hexseq / hexseq \"::\" [ hexseq ] / \"::\" [ hexseq ]\n     hexseq        \
    \ =  hex4 *( \":\" hex4)\n     hex4           =  1*4HEXDIG\n"

- title: 4.3.  Port Ambiguous in a SIP URI
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Port Ambiguous in a SIP URI\n   IPv6 uses the colon to delimit octets.\
    \  This may lead to ambiguity if\n   the port number on which to contact a SIP\
    \ server is inadvertently\n   conflated with the IPv6 reference.  Consider the\
    \ REGISTER request\n   below.  The sender of the request intended to specify a\
    \ port number\n   (5070) to contact a server, but inadvertently, inserted the\
    \ port\n   number inside the closing \"]\" of the IPv6 reference.  Unfortunately,\n\
    \   since the IPv6 address in the R-URI is compressed, the intended port\n   number\
    \ becomes the last octet of the reference.\n   From a parsing perspective, the\
    \ request below is well-formed.\n   However, from a semantic point of view, it\
    \ will not yield the desired\n   result.  Implementations must ensure that when\
    \ a raw IPv6 address\n   appears in a SIP URI, then a port number, if required,\
    \ appears\n   outside the closing \"]\" delimiting the IPv6 reference.  Raw IPv6\n\
    \   addresses can occur in many header fields, including the Contact,\n   Route,\
    \ and Record-Route header fields.  They also can appear as the\n   result of the\

- title: 4.5.  IPv6 Reference Delimiters in Via Header
  contents:
  - "4.5.  IPv6 Reference Delimiters in Via Header\n   IPv6 references can also appear\
    \ in Via header fields; more\n   specifically in the \"sent-by\" production rule\
    \ and the \"via-received\"\n   production rule.  In the \"sent-by\" production\
    \ rule, the sequence of\n   octets comprising the IPv6 address is defined to appear\
    \ as an\n   \"IPv6reference\" non-terminal, thereby mandating the \"[\" and \"\
    ]\"\n   delimiters.  However, this is not the case for the \"via-received\"\n\
    \   non-terminal.  The \"via-received\" production rule is defined as\n   follows:\n\
    \      via-received = \"received\" EQUAL (IPv4address / IPv6address)\n   The \"\
    IPv6address\" non-terminal is defined not to include the\n   delimiting \"[\"\
    \ and \"]\".  This has led to the situation documented\n   during the 18th SIP\
    \ Interoperability Event [Email-SIPit]:\n      Those testing IPv6 made different\
    \ assumptions about enclosing\n      literal v6 addresses in Vias in [].  By the\
    \ end of the event, most\n      implementations were accepting either.  Its about\
    \ 50/50 on what\n      gets sent.\n   While it would be beneficial if the same\
    \ non-terminal\n   (\"IPv6reference\") was used for both the \"sent-by\" and \"\
    via-received\"\n   production rules, there has not been a consensus in the working\
    \ group\n   to that effect.  Thus, the best that can be suggested is that\n  \
    \ implementations must follow the Robustness Principle [RFC1122] and be\n   liberal\
    \ in accepting a \"received\" parameter with or without the\n   delimiting \"\
    [\" and \"]\" tokens.  When sending a request,\n   implementations must not put\
    \ the delimiting \"[\" and \"]\" tokens.\n   The two test cases below are designed\
    \ to stress this behavior.  A SIP\n   implementation receiving either of these\
    \ messages must parse them\n   successfully.\n   The request below contains an\
    \ IPv6 address in the Via \"received\"\n   parameter.  The IPv6 address is delimited\
    \ by \"[\" and \"]\".  Even\n   though this is not a valid request based on a\
    \ strict interpretation\n   of the grammar in [RFC3261], robust implementations\
    \ must nonetheless\n   be able to parse the topmost Via header field and continue\

  - "4.10.  IPv6 Reference Bug in RFC 3261 ABNF\n   It is possible to follow the IPv6reference\
    \ production rule of RFC\n   3261 ABNF -- the relevant portion of which is reproduced\
    \ at the top\n   of Section 4 -- and arrive at the following construct:\n   [2001:db8:::192.0.2.1]\n\
    \   Note the extra colon before the IPv4 address in the above construct.\n   The\
    \ correct construct, of course, is:\n   [2001:db8::192.0.2.1]\n   The ABNF pertaining\
    \ to IPv6 references in RFC 3261 was derived from\n   RFC 2373 [RFC2373], which\
    \ has been obsoleted by RFC 4291 [RFC4291].\n   The specific behavior of inserting\
    \ an extra colon was inherited from\n   RFC 2373, and has been remedied in RFC\
    \ 4291.  However, following the\n   Robustness Principle [RFC1122], an implementation\
    \ must tolerate both\n   of the above constructs.\n   The message below includes\
    \ an extra colon in the IPv6 reference.  A\n   SIP implementation receiving such\
    \ a message may exhibit robustness by\n   successfully parsing the IPv6 reference\
    \ (it can choose to ignore the\n   extra colon when parsing the IPv6 reference.\
    \  If the SIP\n   implementation is acting in the role of a proxy, it may additionally\n\
    \   serialize the message without the extra colon to aid the next\n   downstream\
    \ server).\n   Message Details: ipv6-bug-abnf-3-colons\n      OPTIONS sip:user@[2001:db8:::192.0.2.1]\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document presents examples of SIP messages\
    \ with IPv6 references\n   contained in the signaling headers and SDP payload.\
    \  While this\n   document may clarify the behavior of SIP elements processing\
    \ a\n   message with IPv6 references, it does not normatively change the base\n\
    \   SIP [RFC3261] specification in any way.  Consequently, all security\n   considerations\
    \ in [RFC3261] apply.\n   Parsers must carefully consider edge conditions and\
    \ malicious input\n   as part of their design.  Attacks on many Internet systems\
    \ use\n   crafted input to cause implementations to behave in undesirable ways.\n\
    \   Many of the messages in this document are designed to stress a parser\n  \
    \ implementation at points traditionally used for such attacks.  This\n   document\
    \ does not, however, attempt to be comprehensive.  It contains\n   some common\
    \ pitfalls that the authors have discovered while parsing\n   IPv6 identifiers\
    \ in SIP implementations.\n"
