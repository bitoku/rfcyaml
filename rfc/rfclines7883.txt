Abstract This document defines a means of advertising one or more Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
(S BFD) Discriminators using the IS IS Router CAPABILITY TLV.
Introduction [RFC7880] defines a simplified mechanism for using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].
This mechanism depends on network nodes knowing the BFD Discriminators that each node in the network has reserved for this purpose.
The use of the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS)
[IS IS] protocol is one possible means of advertising these discriminators.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The IS IS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971] will be used to advertise Seamless BFD (S BFD) Discriminators.
A new sub TLV is defined as described below.
S BFD Discriminators sub TLVs are formatted as specified in [RFC5305].
The inclusion of an S BFD Discriminators sub TLV in a Router CAPABILITY TLV is optional.
Multiple S BFD Discriminators sub TLVs MAY be advertised by an IS.
How a given discriminator is mapped to a specific use case when multiple S BFD Discriminators are advertised is out of scope for this document.
S BFD Discriminator advertisements MAY be flooded within an area or throughout the domain, using the procedures specified in [RFC4971].
The appropriate flooding scope depends on the intended use of S BFD.
If S BFD usage will be exclusively within a Level 1 area, then area scope is appropriate.
If S BFD usage will span different Level 1 areas, then domain scope is appropriate.
IANA Considerations IANA has added a new sub TLV in the "Sub TLVs for TLV 242" registry.
The registration is as follows:
Security Considerations Security concerns for IS IS are addressed in [IS IS], [RFC5304], and [RFC5310].
The new S BFD Discriminators sub TLV does not introduce any new security risks for IS IS.
Advertising the S BFD Discriminators makes it possible for attackers to initiate S BFD sessions using the advertised information.
The vulnerabilities this poses and how to mitigate them are discussed in [RFC7880].
