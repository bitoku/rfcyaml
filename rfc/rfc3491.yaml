  - "Abstract\n   This document describes how to prepare internationalized domain\
    \ name\n   (IDN) labels in order to increase the likelihood that name input and\n\
    \   name comparison work in ways that make sense for typical users\n   throughout\
    \ the world.  This profile of the stringprep protocol is\n   used as part of a\
    \ suite of on-the-wire protocols for\n   internationalizing the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS).\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document specifies processing rules that will allow\
    \ users to\n   enter internationalized domain names (IDNs) into applications and\n\
    \   have the highest chance of getting the content of the strings\n   correct.\
    \  It is a profile of stringprep [STRINGPREP].  These\n   processing rules are\
    \ only intended for internationalized domain\n   names, not for arbitrary text.\n\
    \   This profile defines the following, as required by [STRINGPREP].\n   -  The\
    \ intended applicability of the profile: internationalized\n      domain names\
    \ processed by IDNA.\n   -  The character repertoire that is the input and output\
    \ to\n      stringprep:  Unicode 3.2, specified in section 2.\n   -  The mappings\
    \ used: specified in section 3.\n   -  The Unicode normalization used: specified\
    \ in section 4.\n   -  The characters that are prohibited as output: specified\
    \ in section\n      5.\n   -  Bidirectional character handling: specified in section\
    \ 6.\n"
- title: 1.1 Interaction of protocol parts
  contents:
  - "1.1 Interaction of protocol parts\n   Nameprep is used by the IDNA [IDNA] protocol\
    \ for preparing domain\n   names; it is not designed for any other purpose.  It\
    \ is explicitly\n   not designed for processing arbitrary free text and SHOULD\
    \ NOT be\n   used for that purpose.  Nameprep is a profile of Stringprep\n   [STRINGPREP].\
    \  Implementations of Nameprep MUST fully implement\n   Stringprep.\n   Nameprep\
    \ is used to process domain name labels, not domain names.\n   IDNA calls nameprep\
    \ for each label in a domain name, not for the\n   whole domain name.\n"
- title: 1.2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2 Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ BCP 14, RFC\n   2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2. Character Repertoire
  contents:
  - "2. Character Repertoire\n   This profile uses Unicode 3.2, as defined in [STRINGPREP]\
    \ Appendix A.\n"
- title: 3. Mapping
  contents:
  - "3. Mapping\n   This profile specifies mapping using the following tables from\n\
    \   [STRINGPREP]:\n   Table B.1\n   Table B.2\n"
- title: 4. Normalization
  contents:
  - "4. Normalization\n   This profile specifies using Unicode normalization form\
    \ KC, as\n   described in [STRINGPREP].\n"
- title: 5. Prohibited Output
  contents:
  - "5. Prohibited Output\n   This profile specifies prohibiting using the following\
    \ tables from\n   [STRINGPREP]:\n   Table C.1.2\n   Table C.2.2\n   Table C.3\n\
    \   Table C.4\n   Table C.5\n   Table C.6\n   Table C.7\n   Table C.8\n   Table\
    \ C.9\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: This profile MUST be used with the IDNA protocol.\n\
    \   The IDNA protocol has additional prohibitions that are checked\n   outside\
    \ of this profile.\n"
- title: 6. Bidirectional characters
  contents:
  - "6. Bidirectional characters\n   This profile specifies checking bidirectional\
    \ strings as described in\n   [STRINGPREP] section 6.\n"
- title: 7. Unassigned Code Points in Internationalized Domain Names
  contents:
  - "7. Unassigned Code Points in Internationalized Domain Names\n   If the processing\
    \ in [IDNA] specifies that a list of unassigned code\n   points be used, the system\
    \ uses table A.1 from [STRINGPREP] as its\n   list of unassigned code points.\n"

- title: 9. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Security Considerations\n   The Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 repertoires have\
    \ many characters that\n   look similar.  In many cases, users of security protocols\
    \ might do\n   visual matching, such as when comparing the names of trusted third\n\
    \   parties.  Because it is impossible to map similar-looking characters\n   without\
    \ a great deal of context such as knowing the fonts used,\n   stringprep does\
    \ nothing to map similar-looking characters together\n   nor to prohibit some\
    \ characters because they look like others.\n   Security on the Internet partly\
    \ relies on the DNS.  Thus, any change\n   to the characteristics of the DNS can\
    \ change the security of much of\n   the Internet.\n   Domain names are used by\
    \ users to connect to Internet servers.  The\n   security of the Internet would\
    \ be compromised if a user entering a\n   single internationalized name could\
    \ be connected to different servers\n   based on different interpretations of\
    \ the internationalized domain\n   name.\n   Current applications might assume\
    \ that the characters allowed in\n   domain names will always be the same as they\
    \ are in [STD13].  This\n   document vastly increases the number of characters\
    \ available in\n   domain names.  Every program that uses \"special\" characters\
    \ in\n   conjunction with domain names may be vulnerable to attack based on\n\
    \   the new characters allowed by this specification.\n"
