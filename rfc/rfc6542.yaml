  - "Abstract\n   Currently, channel bindings are implemented using an MD5 hash in\
    \ the\n   Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Programming\n\
    \   Interface (GSS-API) mechanism (RFC 4121).  This document updates RFC\n   4121\
    \ to allow channel bindings using algorithms negotiated based on\n   Kerberos\
    \ crypto framework as defined in RFC 3961.  In addition,\n   because this update\
    \ makes use of the last extensible field in the\n   Kerberos client-server exchange\
    \ message, extensions are defined to\n   allow future protocol extensions.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the recently discovered weaknesses in the MD5 hash\
    \ algorithm\n   (see [RFC6151]), there is a need to use stronger hash algorithms.\n\
    \   The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application\n   Programming\
    \ Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC4121] uses MD5 to\n   calculate channel binding\
    \ verifiers.  This document specifies an\n   update to the mechanism that allows\
    \ it to create channel binding\n   information based on negotiated algorithms.\
    \  This will allow\n   deploying new algorithms incrementally without breaking\n\
    \   interoperability with older implementations when new attacks arise in\n  \
    \ the future.\n"
