- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Version 2 of the Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) will\
    \ extend\n   the interoperable framework for Internet commerce capabilities of\n\
    \   Version 1 [RFC 2801] as described in Section 3 below.  In addition,\n   it\
    \ will replace the ad hoc XML messaging and digital signature [RFC\n   2802] parts\
    \ of IOTP v1 with standards based mechanisms [RFC 3275].\n   This document gives\
    \ requirements for the Internet Open Trading\n   Protocol (IOTP) Version 2 by\
    \ describing design principles and scope\n   and dividing features into those\
    \ which will, may, or will not be\n   included.\n"
- title: 2. Design Principles and Scope
  contents:
  - "2. Design Principles and Scope\n   1. The specification must describe the syntax\
    \ and processing\n      necessary for an extension of the interoperable framework\
    \ for\n      Internet commerce described in IOTP V1.0 [RFC 2801].\n   2. Keep\
    \ changes to IOTP V1.0 to a minimum.\n   3. Maintain all existing functionality\
    \ of IOTP V1.0.\n   4. Test all XML DTDs and/or Schemas and XML examples in the\n\
    \      specification to insure that they are well-formed.\n   5. Create usage/implementation\
    \ guidance information, probably as a\n      separate document.\n   6. It should\
    \ be designed to work well with other protocols such as\n      ECML [RFC 3106].\n\
    \   7. IOTP Version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web\n      design\
    \ philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, and\n      modularity /layering\
    \ / extensibility.  [Berners-Lee, WebData] In\n      this context, this standard\
    \ should take advantage of existing\n      provider (and infrastructure) primitives.\n"
- title: 3. Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Requirements\n   IOTP Version 2 will include the following:\n   1. Be a superset\
    \ of IOTP Version 1.\n   2. Provide for the Dynamic Definition of Trading Sequences.\
    \  I.E.,\n      transactions will not be limited, as with v1, to a single payment\n\
    \      and a single delivery with delivery occurring after payment.\n      Instead,\
    \ it will be possible to propose an arbitrary sequence of\n      transaction steps.\n\
    \   3. Include specification of an Offer Request Block.\n   4. Support Improved\
    \ Problem Resolution (extend to cover presentation\n      of signed receipt to\
    \ customer support party, better defined\n      Customer Care role, etc.).\n \
    \  5. Add provisions to indicate and handle a payment protocol not\n      tunneled\
    \ through IOTP.\n   6. Add support for server based wallets.\n   The following\
    \ may be include in IOTP v2:\n   1. Support Repeated/ongoing payments.  For example,\
    \ a means to\n      specify that a customer approval covers not only the instant\n\
    \      purchase but also some limited number of future purchase with some\n  \
    \    total or per purchase spending limit.\n   2. Enhanced Server to Server messages.\
    \  For example, a means for a\n      Delivery Handler to inform a Payment Handler\
    \ that goods have\n      actually shipped, which may be a pre-condition for making\
    \ a charge\n      against a credit card.\n   3. Include the ability to add both\
    \ fields and attributes to existing\n      trading blocks in addition to the present\
    \ ability to add entirely\n      new trading blocks.\n   The following are out\
    \ of scope for IOTP version 2:\n   1. Legal or regulatory issues surrounding the\
    \ implementation of the\n      protocol or information systems using it.\n   2.\
    \ Design of an XML Messaging Layer.  Instead, whatever is or appears\n      most\
    \ likely to become the standard XML messaging layer will be\n      used.  This\
    \ includes a standard enveloping, addressing, and error\n      reporting framework.\n\
    \   3. Design of XML Digital Signatures.  Instead, the existing standard\n   \
    \   [RFC 3275] will be used.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   As provided above, IOTP v2 will provide optional\
    \ authentication via\n   standards based XML Digital Signatures [RFC 3275]; however,\
    \ neither\n   IOTP v1 nor v2 provide a confidentiality mechanism.  Both require\
    \ the\n   use of secure channels such as those provided by TLS [RFC 2246] or\n\
    \   IPSEC for confidentiality and depend on the security mechanisms of\n   any\
    \ payment system used in conjunction with them to secure payments.\n"
