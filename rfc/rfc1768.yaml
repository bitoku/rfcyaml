- title: 1.      Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.      Introduction\n   This memo provides a specification for multicast extensions\
    \ for CLNP\n   in order to provide a CLNP based Internet the capabilities provided\n\
    \   for IP by RFC 1112 (Host Extensions for IP Multicasting) [RFC1112].\n   This\
    \ memo uses an outline similar to that of RFC 1112.\n   Paraphrasing RFC 1112,\
    \ \"CLNP multicasting is the transmission of a\n   CLNP datagram to a \"host group\"\
    , a set of zero or more End Systems\n   identified by a single group Network address\
    \ (GNA). A multicast\n   datagram is delivered to all members of its destination\
    \ host group\n   with the same \"best-efforts\" reliability as regular unicast\
    \ CLNP\n   datagrams, i.e., the datagram is not guaranteed to arrive intact at\n\
    \   all members of the destination group or in the same order relative to\n  \
    \ other datagrams.\n   \"The membership of a host group is dynamic; that is End\
    \ Systems may\n   join and leave groups at any time. There is no restrictions\
    \ on the\n   location or number of members in a host group. An End System may\
    \ be a\n   member of more than one group at a time. An End System need not be\
    \ a\n   member of a group to send datagrams to it.\n   \"A host group may be permanent\
    \ or transient. A permanent group has an\n   administratively assigned GNA. It\
    \ is the address, not the membership\n   of the group, that is permanent; at any\
    \ time a permanent group may\n   have any number of members, even zero.\n   \"\
    Internetwork forwarding of CLNP multicast datagrams is handled by\n   \"multicast\
    \ capable\" Intermediate Systems which may be co-resident\n   with unicast capable\
    \ Intermediate Systems.\n   The multicast extensions to the CLNP addressing structure\
    \ defines\n   group Network addresses which identify host groups.  The multicast\n\
    \   extensions to CLNP provides a means for identifying a CLNP packet and\n  \
    \ provides scope control mechanisms for CLNP multicast packets. The\n   multicast\
    \ extensions to the ES-IS protocol provide the mechanisms\n   needed for a host\
    \ to exchange control information with multicast\n   capable routers.  These extensions\
    \ to the ES-IS protocol provide for\n   a host to \"announce\" which multicast\
    \ packets are of interest and for\n   a multicast capable router to dynamically\
    \ \"map\" group Network\n   addresses to subnetwork addresses.\n   This memo specifies\
    \ the extensions required by an End System to make\n   use of CLNP multicast.\
    \ In addition the requirements placed upon\n   multicast capable Intermediate\
    \ Systems to exchange information with\n   multicast capable End Systems is specified.\
    \ No specifications are\n   provided related to the information exchanges between\
    \ Intermediate\n   Systems to support multicast route selection or multicast Protocol\n\
    \   Data Unit (PDU) forwarding. A discussion of multicast route selection\n  \
    \ and PDU forwarding has been written by Steve Deering [Deering91].\n   Note that\
    \ for these multicast extensions to work there must exist an\n   uninterrupted\
    \ path of multicast capable routers between the End\n   Systems comprising a host\
    \ group (such paths may utilize tunneling\n   (i.e., unicast CLNP encapsulated\
    \ paths between multicast capable CLNP\n   routers)).   In order to support multicast\
    \ route selection and\n   forwarding for a CLNP based internet additional specifications\
    \ are\n   needed. Specifications of this type could come in the form of new\n\
    \   protocols, extensions to the current CLNP based routing protocols or\n   use\
    \ of a technique out of the IETF's Inter-Domain Multicast Routing\n   (IDMR) group.\
    \ The IDMR group is currently investigating multicast\n   protocols for routers\
    \ which utilize a router's unicast routing\n   protocols, this approach may extend\
    \ directly to CLNP routers.\n   While many of the techniques and assumptions of\
    \ IP multicasting (as\n   discussed in RFC 1112) are used in CLNP multicasting,\
    \ there are\n   number of differences. Appendix A describes the differences between\n\
    \   CLNP multicasting and IP multicasting. This memo describes techniques\n  \
    \ brought in directly from projects within ISO to incorporate multicast\n   transmission\
    \ capabilities into CLNP [MULT-AMDS].\n"
- title: 2.      Levels of Conformance
  contents:
  - "2.      Levels of Conformance\n   There are three levels of conformance for End\
    \ Systems to this\n   specification:\n   Level 0: no support for CLNP multicasting.\n\
    \   There is no requirement for a CLNP End System (or Intermediate\n   System)\
    \ to support CLNP multicasting. Level 0 hosts should be\n   unaffected by the\
    \ presence of multicast activity. The destination\n   addresses used in support\
    \ of multicast transfers, the GNA, should not\n   be enabled by a non-multicast\
    \ capable End System and the PDUs\n   themselves are marked differently than unicast\
    \ PDUs and thus should\n   be quietly discarded.\n   Level 1: support for sending\
    \ but not receiving CLNP multicast PDUs.\n   An End System originating multicast\
    \ PDUs is required to know whether\n   a multicast capable Intermediate System\
    \ is attached to the\n   subnetwork(s) that it originates multicast PDUs (i.e.,\
    \ to determine\n   the destination SNPA (subnet) address). An End System with\
    \ Level 1\n   conformance is required to implement all parts of this specification\n\
    \   except for those supporting only Multicast Announcement.  An End\n   System\
    \ is not required to know the current Multicast Address Mapping\n   to start originating\
    \ multicast PDUs.\n   Note: It is possible for End System not implementing Multicast\n\
    \   Address Mapping to successfully originate multicast PDUs (but with\n   the\
    \ End System knowing of the existence of a multicast capable\n   Intermediate\
    \ System). Such operation may lead to inefficient\n   subnetworks use.  Thus when\
    \ an End System continues (or may continue)\n   to originate multicast PDUs destined\
    \ for the same group,\n   implementations are to provide Multicast Address Mapping\
    \ support.\n   Level 2: full support for CLNP multicasting.\n   Level 2 allows\
    \ a host to join and leave host groups as well as send\n   CLNP PDUs to host groups.\
    \ It requires implementation by the End\n   System of all parts of this specification.\n"
- title: 3.      Group Network Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.      Group Network Addresses\n   Individual Network addresses used by CLNP\
    \ for End System addressing\n   are called Network Service Access Points (NSAPs).\
    \ RFC 1237 defines\n   the NSAP address for use in the Internet. In order to provide\
    \ an\n   address for a group of End Systems, this specification does not\n   change\
    \ the definition of the NSAP address, but adds a new type of\n   identifier -\
    \ the group Network address - that supports a multicast\n   Network service (i.e.,\
    \ between a single source NSAP, identified by an\n   individual Network address,\
    \ and a group of destination NSAPs,\n   identified by a group Network address).\
    \ Host groups are identified by\n   group Network addresses.\n   In the development\
    \ of multicast address extensions to CLNP,\n   requirements were identified for:\
    \ (1)\"easily distinguishing\" group\n   addresses at the Network layer from NSAP\
    \ addresses; (2)leaving the\n   currently allocated address families unaffected\
    \ and (3)ensuring that\n   the approach taken would not require the establishment\
    \ of new\n   addressing authorities. In addition, it was agreed that providing\n\
    \   multicast options for all OSI Network layer users was desirable and\n   thus\
    \ the group Network addressing solution should support options for\n   all address\
    \ formats covered by ISO/IEC 8348 | CCITT Recommendation\n   X.213. The only viable\
    \ means identified for meeting all requirements\n   was via creating a new set\
    \ of AFI values with a fixed one-to-one\n   mapping between each of the existing\
    \ AFI values and a corresponding\n   group AFI value.\n   Group Network addresses\
    \ are defined by creating a new set of AFI\n   values, one for each existing AFI\
    \ value, and a fixed one-to-one\n   mapping between each of the existing AFI values\
    \ and a corresponding\n   group AFI value. The syntax of a group Network address\
    \ is identical\n   to the syntax of an individual Network address, except that\
    \ the value\n   of the AFI in an individual Network address may be only one of\
    \ the\n   values already allocated for individual Network addresses, whereas\n\
    \   the value of the AFI in a group Network address may be only one of\n   the\
    \ values allocated here for group Network addresses. The AFI values\n   allocated\
    \ for group Network addresses have been chosen in such a way\n   that they do\
    \ not overlap, in the preferred encoding defined by\n   ISO/IEC 8348 | CCITT Recommendation\
    \ X.213, with any of the AFI values\n   that have already been allocated for individual\
    \ Network addresses.\n"

    \ an address that identifies a single NSAP.\n"
- title: 3.2     CLNP Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.2     CLNP Addresses\n   A discussion of the CLNP address format is contained\
    \ in RFC 1237. The\n   structure of all CLNP addresses is divided into two parts\
    \ the Initial\n   Domain Part (IDP) and the Domain Specific Part (DSP). The first\
    \ two\n   octets of the IDP are the Authority and Format Identifier (AFI)\n  \
    \ field. The AFI has an abstract syntax of two hexadecimal digits with\n   a value\
    \ in the range of 00 to FF. In addition to identifying the\n   address authority\
    \ responsible for allocating a particular address and\n   the format of the address,\
    \ the AFI also identifies whether an address\n   is an individual Network address\
    \ or a group Network address. There\n   are 90 possible AFI values to support\
    \ individual Network address\n   allocations. In addition, when the AFI value\
    \ starts with the value\n   \"0\" this identifies that the field contains an incomplete\
    \ individual\n   Network address (i.e., identifies an escape code).\n   Table\
    \ 1 allocates 90 possible AFI values to support group Network\n   address allocations.\
    \ In addition if the first two digits of the IDP\n   are hexadecimal FF, this\
    \ indicates the presence of an incomplete\n   group Network address. The allocation\
    \ of group addresses is\n   restricted to be only from the AFI values allocated\
    \ for the\n   assignment of group addresses in Table 1. An addressing authority\
    \ in\n   allocating either Network addresses or authorizing one or more\n   authorities\
    \ to allocate addresses, allocates both individual and the\n   corresponding group\
    \ addresses. Thus each block of addresses allocated\n   by an addressing authority\
    \ (or its sub-authority) contains a block of\n   individual Network addresses\
    \ and group Network addresses.  The\n   individual and group address block allocated\
    \ are differentiated by\n   the AFI values used which are related as shown in\
    \ Table 1.\n   Group Network addresses are only used as the destination address\n\
    \   parameter of a CLNP PDU. Source Address parameters are never\n   permitted\
    \ to be group Network addresses.\n   Table 2 lists the AFI values which have not\
    \ been assigned, at this\n   time, for the support of neither individual nor group\
    \ address\n   allocation. Future assignment of these AFI values is possible.\n\
    \   Additional information concerning individual Network addresses (i.e.,\n  \
    \ NSAP and NET (Network Entity Titles)) is contained in RFC 1237.\n   Note: While\
    \ the format of the Initial Domain Part of a group Network\n   address is assigned,\
    \ the format for the Domain Specific Part of the\n   group Network address is\
    \ specified by an addressing authority and is\n   out of the scope of this memo.\
    \  While NSAP address assignments are\n   typically made to support hierarchical\
    \ unicast routing, a similar\n   consideration for group Network address assignments\
    \ may not exist.\n         TABLE 1 - Relationship of AFI Individual and Group\

    \ to\n   mark the packet (via a particular field) or to mark the destination\n\
    \   address, in the end both were done.  The destination address for a\n   multicast\
    \ PDU identifies a host group which is of a very different\n   nature  than the\
    \ unicast NSAP address.  Rather than changing the\n   nature of NSAP addresses,\
    \ a new set of addresses were created named\n   group Network addresses which\
    \ are marked within the first octet\n   (i.e., the AFI field) with values reserved\
    \ for group Network\n   addresses.\n   Consideration was given to no further marking\
    \ of the PDU; however, a\n   problem was identified with only using the group\
    \ Network address to\n   identify multicast packets.  Currently routers implementing\
    \ the IS-IS\n   Intra-Domain protocol as Level 1 routers when receiving a packet\
    \ with\n   an unknown destination address are permitted to either discard the\n\
    \   packet or send it to a Level 2 router.  Such actions by non-multicast\n  \
    \ capable routers to multicast packets can lead to non-deterministic\n   behavior.\
    \  Level 1 routers upon receiving a packet containing a group\n   Network address\
    \ might pass the packet up to a Level 2 router (which\n   may or may not be multicast\
    \ capable) or it might discard it.\n   Depending upon the circumstances this might\
    \ lead to whole regions\n   missing packets or packet duplication (possibly even\
    \ explosion).  The\n   result was to seek deterministic behavior by non-multicast\
    \ capable\n   routers by creating a new PDU type (Multicast Data PDU) and inserting\n\
    \   into the CLNP reasons for discard: receiving a PDU of unknown type.\n   Note\
    \ that this reason for discard is mandatory on multicast capable\n   and non-multicast\
    \ capable CLNP implementations.\n"

    \  This variable shall be set to a value large enough so\n   that even if every\
    \ other MAM PDU, for a particular group Network\n   address, is discarded (due\
    \ to lack of resources), or otherwise lost\n   in the subnetwork, the multicast\
    \ address mapping information will\n   still be maintained. The value should be\
    \ set small enough so that End\n   Systems will quickly cease to use the multicast\
    \ address mappings\n   supplied by ISs that have failed.\n   Note: -- The Holding\
    \ Timer parameter value applies to all group\n   Network addresses called out\
    \ in the MAM PDU.\n   The Group Address Pair parameter is used to convey the association\n\

    \ the Group Network Address\n   Mask option and the Paired SNPA Address Mask option.\n\
    \   There are three permitted cases for including or excluding the masks.\n  \
    \ In the first case, both masks are absent. In this case the MAM PDU\n   conveys\
    \ information about one set of enumerated group Network\n   addresses only.\n\
    \   Note: -- Multiple group address pairs may be contained in a single\n   MAM\
    \ PDU.\n   In the second case, the MAM PDU contains a Group Network Address Mask\n\
    \   but no Paired SNPA Address Mask. In this case, the MAM PDU conveys\n   information\
    \ about an equivalence class of group Network addresses.\n   The information reveals\
    \ that multiple group Network addresses are\n   mapped to the same SNPA address.\n\
    \   In the third case, the MAM PDU contains both masks. As in the second\n   case,\
    \ the MAM PDU conveys information about an equivalence class of\n   group Network\
    \ addresses. But in this case, the information reveals\n   that the SNPA addresses\
    \ for the equivalence class of group Network\n   address are embedded in the group\
    \ Network address. In particular the\n   Paired SNPA Address Mask indicates the\
    \ location of the SNPA address\n   in the group Network Address(es).\n   The Active\
    \ Multicast IS shall construct a MAM PDU with direct\n   information, not needing\
    \ analysis of the Mask parameters, in response\n   to the occurrence of an event\
    \ driven condition.  The Active Multicast\n   IS may provide additional information\
    \ in such a MAM PDU via the use\n   of Mask parameters.\n   An IS may suggest\
    \ a value for End Systems on the local subnetwork to\n   use as their Multicast\
    \ Announcement Timers, for a specific group\n   Network address, by including\
    \ the Suggested ES Multicast Announcement\n   Timer (ESMAT) parameter in the transmitted\
    \ MAM PDU. Setting this\n   parameter permits the Active Multicast IS to influence\
    \ the frequency\n   with which ESs transmit ESGH PDUs.\n   Note: If the ESMAT\

    \ 13 octet and with \"11\" in the two low order bits of\n   the 14th octet are\
    \ put in an equivalence class and share the same\n   mapping information. If this\
    \ were the only option present then all of\n   these group Network addresses would\
    \ all have a paired SNPA address of\n   03-00-DA-DA-DA-DA.\n   In order to map\
    \ the group Network addresses to the range of IEEE\n   addresses of this example,\
    \ the MAM PDU must also contain a Paired\n   SNPA Address Mask.  The Paired SNPA\
    \ Address Mask identifies where the\n   SNPA Address is contained within the group\
    \ Network addresses (defined\n   by the equivalence class formed by the Group\
    \ Network Address Mask\n   within the same PDU).  For this example the Paired\
    \ SNPA Address Mask\n   is 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-00.\n\
    \   As a second example, all group Network addresses with a specific OUI\n   (organizationally\
    \ unique identifier) using the twenty octet group\n   Network address format provided\
    \ above are mapped to their embedded\n   SNPA address.  An OUI is assigned by\
    \ IEEE 802 and is three octets in\n   length.  The OUI is contained in the first\
    \ three address octets of a\n   GLOBALLY assigned IEEE 802 address.  For this\
    \ example the MAM PDU\n   must contain the following:\n   1.   A group Network\
    \ address contained within the MAM PDU with the\n        OUI of interest.\n  \
    \ 2.   A group Network address Mask of FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-\n        FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-00-00-00-00.\n\
    \   3.   A Paired SNPA Address of 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-\n        00-00-00-00-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-00.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Differences with RFC 1112\n   This appendix is intended to identify\
    \ differences between the\n   mechanisms defined for CLNP Multicast in this specification\
    \ and those\n   for IP multicast defined in RFC 1112. The work on CLNP Multicast\n\
    \   followed the work on IP multicast and was explicitly aimed at\n   bringing\
    \ the capabilities described in RFC 1112 into a CLNP context.\n   This appendix\
    \ is intended to provide some background information on\n   the difference; however,\
    \ it is not intended to justify the mechanisms\n   selected for CLNP multicast\
    \ use.\n   Static/Dynamic Address Binding of Multicast Datagrams\n   IP multicast\
    \ utilizes a static binding of Class D IP addresses to a\n   specific range of\
    \ IEEE 802 48 bit group addresses. The IEEE 802\n   address range that is used\
    \ is within the address range that IEEE 802\n   allocates for \"Global\" administration\
    \ and this block of addresses is\n   under the control of the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA)\n   which in turn has allocated this block of addresses\
    \ for use by IP\n   multicast.  This scheme is very simple and efficient. Given\
    \ the use\n   of a 32 bit IP address, the lower 23 bits of the Class D address\
    \ are\n   mapped into the lower 23 bits of a 48 bit IEEE 802 address where the\n\
    \   upper 25 bits are fixed.  Static binding of this form is global in\n   scope\
    \ (all members of a group use the same IEEE 802 address on all\n   subnets (at\
    \ least all that use IEEE 802 addressing).\n   CLNP multicast uses a dynamic binding\
    \ of a group Network address (up\n   to 20 bytes) to any subnetwork address. In\
    \ cases where no multicast\n   capable Intermediate Systems are attached to a\
    \ subnetwork then a\n   binding using preconfigured information or the \"All Multicast\
    \ Capable\n   End Systems\" subnetwork addresses is used. The large GNA provides\
    \ the\n   room to contain a full 48 bit IEEE 802 address if desired.  Mask\n \
    \  capabilities are optionally provided which allow a multicast capable\n   Intermediate\
    \ System to specify a \"static\" binding for a particular\n   subnetwork. One\
    \ of the major purposes of providing a dynamic binding\n   is to customize a host's\
    \ subnetwork address usage to the capabilities\n   of the attached systems.  There\
    \ is considerable differences in the\n   numbers of group subnetwork addresses\
    \ that a system can recognize\n   using hardware hooks built into the integrated\
    \ circuits used. For\n   example the number of addresses that can be recognized\
    \ by hardware\n   may differ by an attached system depending upon the interface\
    \ it uses\n   (e.g., Ethernet interface and FDDI within the same system may have\n\
    \   quite different capabilities).  Dynamic binding of this form is local\n  \
    \ in scope (members of a group may use different subnetwork addresses\n   (e.g.,\
    \ IEEE 802 addresses) on different subnets).\n   Originating of Multicast Datagrams\n\
    \   IP multicast originates multicast datagrams directly, where the host\n   originating\
    \ a datagram sends it with the group Subnetwork address as\n   its destination.\
    \ Hosts attached to the network where the datagram is\n   originated receive the\
    \ datagram directly.\n   CLNP multicast originates multicast datagrams directly\
    \ using the\n   group's subnetwork address as its destination when multicast address\n\
    \   mapping information is available.  This case occurs when a multicast\n   capable\
    \ Intermediate System is attached to the subnetwork and a host\n   on the subnetwork\
    \ is announcing an interest in multicast packets\n   identified by a particular\
    \ group Network address.  The Active\n   Multicast IS may use MAM PDU mask parameters\
    \ to provide multicast\n   address mapping information for a large number of group\
    \ Network\n   addresses. When there is no multicast address mapping information\
    \ for\n   the particular group Network address on a subnetwork with a multicast\n\
    \   capable IS attached to it, hosts originate packets using such\n   addresses\
    \ sends to the \"All Multicast Capable Intermediate Systems\"\n   SNPA address.\
    \  This case occurs when there are no receivers of such\n   multicast packets\
    \ on the originating subnetwork.  When a multicast\n   capable Intermediate System\
    \ is not attached to a subnetwork, the End\n   System may utilize either preconfigured\
    \ information (which might be a\n   direct mapping from a portion of the group\
    \ Network address) or use\n   the \"All Multicast Capable End Systems\" address.\n\
    \   Address Binding of Control Packets\n   IP multicast sends the control packets\
    \ related to the IGMP protocol\n   on the same subnetwork address that is used\
    \ by the multicast data\n   traffic.\n   CLNP multicast sends the control packets\
    \ related to the ES-IS\n   protocol extensions on specific group subnetwork addresses\
    \ (i.e.,\n   \"All Multicast Capable End Systems\" and \"All Multicast Announcements\"\
    \n   addresses).\n   Router Requirements for relaying Multicast Datagrams\n  \
    \ IP multicast requires that a multicast router run in \"promiscuous\"\n   mode\
    \ where it must receive all multicast datagrams originated on a\n   subnetwork\
    \ regardless of the destination. This is a result of the\n   choices selected\
    \ in the \"Originating of Multicast Datagrams\" and\n   \"Address Binding of Control\
    \ Packets\" discussed above.\n   CLNP multicast allows a multicast router to limit\
    \ multicast packet\n   reception to only those datagrams sent to the SNPA addresses\
    \ where\n   there is current multicast address mapping information or to the \"\
    All\n   Multicast Capable Intermediate Systems\" address.  The intention is to\n\
    \   allow the multicast routers to be in control of the SNPA addresses\n   for\
    \ multicast packets that they need to receive.  This is a result of\n   the choices\
    \ selected in the \"Originating of Multicast Datagrams\" and\n   \"Address Binding\
    \ of Control Packets\" discussed above.\n   Aggregation of Control Information\n\
    \   In IP multicast, a host is required to withhold an announcement\n   report\
    \ upon hearing another host reporting a similar interest in a\n   particular Class\
    \ D address on a particular subnetwork. This is an\n   option for CLNP multicast\
    \ (upon hearing interest in a particular\n   group Network address on a particular\
    \ subnetwork). Such reports are\n   not combined in IP multicast while CLNP multicast\
    \ supports providing\n   multiple announcements (and address mappings) within\
    \ a single packet.\n   A mask feature for address mappings supports identifying\
    \ mappings for\n   a range of group Network addresses within a single control\
    \ packet.\n   Datagram Scope Control\n   IP multicast supports the use of the\
    \ IP Hop Count as a means to\n   support scope control. While not documented in\
    \ RFC 1112, a technique\n   is also being used to use bits within the Class D\
    \ address to identify\n   whether a datagram has single subnetwork, \"campus\"\
    \ or global scope.\n   CLNP has considerable scope control functionality. While\
    \ the PDU\n   Lifetime field can be employed in a similar way to the IP Hop Count,\n\
    \   two additional options are available. The Radius scope control\n   provides\
    \ a mechanism for \"administratively\" setting distance values\n   and de-couples\
    \ the multicast scope control from the PDU lifetime\n   function. More importantly,\
    \ the Prefix based scope control appears to\n   provide considerable and flexible\
    \ functionality that can adjust to\n   situations where a known, hierarchical\
    \ unicast addressing structure\n   exists.\n   Marking of Multicast Datagrams\n\
    \   IP multicast marks a multicast PDU via the use of an IP Class D\n   address\
    \ as its destination address parameter. CLNP multicast marks\n   both the PDU\
    \ (a different PDU type) and the destination address\n   (i.e., group Network\
    \ address) parameter.\n   Unicast Addressing Differences\n   An IP address identifies\
    \ a specific host interface while a CLNP\n   individual Network address (i.e.,\
    \ NSAP address) identifies a\n   particular Network entity. This difference has\
    \ lead to a difference\n   with RFC 1112.  IP multicast requires a host which\
    \ is attached to\n   more than one subnetwork to originate a multicast packet\
    \ on only one\n   subnetwork.  CLNP multicast requires a host which is attached\
    \ to more\n   than one subnetwork to originate a multicast packet on every\n \
    \  subnetwork that the ISO ES-IS Configuration function is reporting the\n   NSAP\
    \ address contained in the source address parameter of the\n   multicast PDU.\n\
    \   Error Reports\n   Error reports sent in response to receiving a multicast\
    \ PDU are not\n   permitted in IP multicast while they are permitted in CLNP multicast.\n\
    \   Source Routing\n   Source routing of multicast PDUs are permitted in IP multicast\
    \ (but\n   at the present time this is discouraged) while they are not permitted\n\
    \   in CLNP multicast.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Issues Under Study\n   This appendix is intended to record the current\
    \ issues (as discussed\n   at the March 1994 TUBA meeting).\n   1. Local versus\
    \ Global address bindings\n   The extensions to the ES-IS protocol provide a multicast\
    \ address\n   mapping function which supports dynamically binding a group Network\n\
    \   address to a subnetwork address.  Concern has been expressed that\n   this\
    \ is an unnecessary feature which complicates the job of network\n   administrators\
    \ without suitable benefit.  A static, global binding of\n   group Network addresses\
    \ to IEEE 802 subnetwork addresses, as is used\n   by IP multicast has been suggested.\n\
    \   The two main reasons that the group Network address to subnetwork\n   (IEEE\
    \ 802) address was made locally configurable were to support\n   multicast on\
    \ subnets with hosts having a mixture of capabilities (as\n   to how many multicast\
    \ subnetwork addresses a host could register to\n   receive at a time) and to\
    \ support multicast on subnets that do not\n   use 48 bit IEEE 802 addresses.\
    \  Thus it was felt that this should be\n   done per subnetwork versus globally.\
    \  Even multi-homed hosts with\n   subnets that use 802 addresses may have varying\
    \ capabilities (looking\n   at typical Ethernet, FDDI and 802.5 implementations).\n\
    \   One possible solution is to recommend a direct mapping in any\n   Internet\
    \ use of CLNP multicast on subnets which use IEEE 802\n   addressing.  This could\
    \ be a default for all Internet hosts.  A\n   policy would be needed to identify\
    \ the Internet's group Network\n   address format.  Given such a mapping the only\
    \ operational overhead\n   that would occur is that in the presence of a mapping\
    \ server (the\n   Active Multicast IS), which was supporting this mapping, a MAM\
    \ PDU\n   would periodically be sent with a Group Network Address Mask which\n\
    \   would identify the direct mapping.\n   2.  \"Real Time\" Scope Control Features\n\
    \   The scope control features are provided via optional parameters.  Use\n  \
    \ of multicast transfer of audio and video streams may require scope\n   control\
    \ mechanisms which operate very quickly.\n   One possible solution is to embed\
    \ scope control mechanisms into the\n   group Network address itself.  For example,\
    \ a group Network address\n   using the \"Local\" AFI is automatically limited\
    \ to not cross inter-\n   domain borders.  Further, more flexible, address formats\
    \ may be\n   developed.\n"
