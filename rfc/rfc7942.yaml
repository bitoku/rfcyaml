- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most IETF participants are familiar with the saying \"rough\
    \ consensus\n   and running code\" [Tao] and can identify with its pragmatic approach.\n\
    \   However, implementation is not a requirement for publication as an\n   RFC.\
    \  There are many examples of Internet-Drafts containing protocol\n   specifications\
    \ that have gone through to publication as Proposed\n   Standard RFCs without\
    \ implementation.  Some of them may never get\n   implemented.\n   Over time,\
    \ a variety of policies have been applied within the IETF to\n   consider running\
    \ code.  In the Routing Area, it used to be a\n   requirement that one or more\
    \ implementations must exist before an\n   Internet-Draft could be published as\
    \ a Proposed Standard RFC\n   [RFC1264].  That RFC was later obsoleted and the\
    \ requirement for\n   implementation was lifted, but each working group was given\
    \ the\n   authority to impose its own implementation requirements [RFC4794] and\n\
    \   at least one working group, Inter-Domain Routing (IDR), continues to\n   require\
    \ two independent implementations.\n   The hypothesis behind the current document\
    \ is that there are benefits\n   to the IETF standardization process of producing\
    \ implementations of\n   protocol specifications before publication as RFCs. \
    \ These benefits,\n   which include determining that the specification is comprehensible\n\
    \   and that there is sufficient interest to implement, are further\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 4.\n   This document describes a simple mechanism that allows authors\
    \ of\n   Internet-Drafts to record and publicize the status of known\n   implementations\
    \ by including an Implementation Status section.  The\n   document defines (quite\
    \ informally) the contents of this section to\n   ensure that the relevant information\
    \ is included.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups to assign due\
    \ consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running code, which\
    \ may serve as evidence of\n   valuable experimentation and feedback that have\
    \ made the implemented\n   protocols more mature.\n   It is up to the individual\
    \ working groups to use this information as\n   they see fit, but one result might\
    \ be the preferential treatment of\n   documents, resulting in them being processed\
    \ more rapidly.  We\n   recommend that the Implementation Status section should\
    \ be removed\n   from Internet-Drafts before they are published as RFCs.  As a\
    \ result,\n   we do not envisage changes to this section after approval of the\n\
    \   document for publication, e.g., the RFC errata process does not\n   apply.\n\
    \   This process is not mandatory.  Authors of Internet-Drafts are\n   encouraged\
    \ to consider using the process for their documents, and\n   working groups are\
    \ invited to think about applying the process to all\n   of their protocol specifications.\n\
    \   The scope of this process is all Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that contain\n   implementable\
    \ specifications, whether produced within IETF working\n   groups or outside working\
    \ groups but intended for IETF consensus.\n   I-Ds published on the Independent\
    \ Stream are explicitly out of scope.\n   It is expected that the greatest benefit\
    \ will be seen with Standards\n   Track documents developed within working groups.\n\
    \   This process was initially proposed as an experiment in [RFC6982].\n   That\
    \ document is now obsoleted, and the process advanced to Best\n   Current Practice.\n\
    \   Historically, there have been other ways for experience based on\n   protocol\
    \ implementations to feed back into the IETF process.  Many\n   \"implementation\
    \ reports\" have been published, in some cases several\n   years after the protocol\
    \ was originally published.  Providing\n   feedback to published protocols is\
    \ a related goal, but different from\n   the current document's focus.  Two notable\
    \ examples of published\n   implementation reports are [RFC1369] and [RFC5080].\n"
- title: 2.  The "Implementation Status" Section
  contents:
  - "2.  The \"Implementation Status\" Section\n   Each Internet-Draft may contain\
    \ a section entitled \"Implementation\n   Status\".  This section, if it appears,\
    \ should be located just before\n   the \"Security Considerations\" section and\
    \ contain, for each existing\n   implementation, some or all of the following:\n\
    \   -  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.\n   -  The\
    \ implementation's name and/or a link to a web page where the\n      implementation\
    \ or a description of it can be found.\n   -  A brief general description.\n \
    \  -  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype,\n      alpha,\
    \ beta, production, widely used, etc.\n   -  Coverage: which parts of the protocol\
    \ specification are\n      implemented.\n   -  Version compatibility: what version/versions\
    \ of the Internet-Draft\n      are known to be implemented.\n   -  Licensing:\
    \ the terms under which the implementation can be used.\n      For example: proprietary,\
    \ royalty licensing, freely distributable\n      with acknowledgement (BSD style),\
    \ freely distributable with\n      requirement to redistribute source (General\
    \ Public License (GPL)\n      style), and other (specify).\n   -  Implementation\
    \ experience: any useful information the implementers\n      want to share with\
    \ the community.\n   -  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email\
    \ address,\n      but possibly just a URL or mailing list.\n   -  The date when\
    \ information about this particular implementation was\n      last updated.\n\
    \   In addition, this section can contain information about the\n   interoperability\
    \ of any or all of the implementations, including\n   references to test-case\
    \ descriptions and interoperability reports,\n   when such exist.\n   Working\
    \ group chairs and area directors (ADs) are requested to ensure\n   that this\
    \ section is not used as a marketing venue for specific\n   implementations.\n\
    \   Since this information is necessarily time dependent, it is\n   inappropriate\
    \ for inclusion in a published RFC.  The authors should\n   include a note to\
    \ the RFC Editor requesting that the section be\n   removed before publication.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Introductory Text
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Introductory Text\n   The following boilerplate text is proposed to head\
    \ the Implementation\n   Status section:\n     This section records the status\
    \ of known implementations of the\n     protocol defined by this specification\
    \ at the time of posting of\n     this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal\
    \ described in\n     RFC 7942.  The description of implementations in this section\
    \ is\n     intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in\n     progressing\
    \ drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any\n     individual implementation\
    \ here does not imply endorsement by the\n     IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has\
    \ been spent to verify the\n     information presented here that was supplied\
    \ by IETF contributors.\n     This is not intended as, and must not be construed\
    \ to be, a\n     catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers\n\
    \     are advised to note that other implementations may exist.\n     According\
    \ to RFC 7942, \"this will allow reviewers and working\n     groups to assign\
    \ due consideration to documents that have the\n     benefit of running code,\
    \ which may serve as evidence of valuable\n     experimentation and feedback that\
    \ have made the implemented\n     protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual\
    \ working groups\n     to use this information as they see fit\".\n   Authors\
    \ are requested to add a note to the RFC Editor at the top of\n   this section,\
    \ advising the Editor to remove the entire section before\n   publication, as\
    \ well as the reference to RFC 7942.\n"
- title: 3.  Alternative Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Alternative Formats\n   Sometimes it can be advantageous to publish the implementation\
    \ status\n   separately from the base Internet-Draft, e.g., on the IETF wiki:\n\
    \   -  When the Implementation Status section becomes too large to be\n      conveniently\
    \ managed within the document.\n   -  When a working group decides to have implementors,\
    \ rather than\n      authors, keep the status of their implementations current.\n\
    \   -  When a working group already maintains an active wiki and prefers\n   \
    \   to use it for this purpose.\n   -  If the working group decides that the information\
    \ is still\n      valuable (and needs to be kept current) after the I-D is published\n\
    \      as an RFC, and the Implementation Status section had been removed\n   \
    \   from it.\n   It is highly desirable for all readers of the Internet-Draft\
    \ to be\n   made aware of this information.  Initially, this can be done by\n\
    \   replacing the Implementation Status section's contents with a URL\n   pointing\
    \ to the wiki.  Later, the IETF Tools may support this\n   functionality, e.g.,\
    \ by including such a link in the HTML file of the\n   document, similar to the\
    \ IPR link.\n   If the implementation status is published separately from the\
    \ I-D,\n   then this information needs to be openly available without requiring\n\
    \   authentication, registration, or access controls if it is to have any\n  \
    \ useful effects.\n"
- title: 4.  Benefits
  contents:
  - "4.  Benefits\n   Publishing the information about implementations provides the\
    \ working\n   group with several benefits:\n   -  Working group members, chairs,\
    \ and ADs may use the information\n      provided to help prioritize the progress\
    \ of I-Ds, e.g., when there\n      are several competing proposals to solve a\
    \ particular problem.\n   -  Similarly, the information is useful when deciding\
    \ whether the\n      document should be progressed on a different track (individual\n\
    \      submission, Experimental, etc.).\n   -  Making this information public\
    \ and an explicit part of WG\n      deliberations will motivate participants to\
    \ implement protocol\n      proposals, which in turn helps in discovering protocol\
    \ flaws at an\n      early stage.\n   -  Other participants can use the software\
    \ to evaluate the usefulness\n      of protocol features, its correctness (to\
    \ some degree), and other\n      properties, such as resilience and scalability.\n\
    \   -  WG members may choose to perform interoperability testing with\n      known\
    \ implementations, especially when they are publicly\n      available.\n   - \
    \ In the case of open source, people may want to study the code to\n      better\
    \ understand the protocol and its limitations, determine if\n      the implementation\
    \ matches the protocol specification, and whether\n      the protocol specification\
    \ has omissions or ambiguities.\n   -  And lastly, some protocol features may\
    \ be hard to understand, and\n      for such features, the mere assurance that\
    \ they can be implemented\n      is beneficial.  We note though that code should\
    \ never be used in\n      lieu of a clear specification.\n   We do not specify\
    \ here whether and to what degree working groups are\n   expected to prefer proposals\
    \ that have \"running code\" associated with\n   them, over others that do not.\n\
    \   Working group chairs are invited to suggest this mechanism to\n   document\
    \ editors in their working groups, and to draw the attention\n   of their working\
    \ group participants to Implementation Status sections\n   where they exist.\n"
