- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A file URI identifies an object (a \"file\") stored in a\
    \ structured\n   object naming and accessing environment on a host (a \"file system\"\
    ).\n   The URI can be used in discussions about the file, and if other\n   conditions\
    \ are met it can be dereferenced to directly access the\n   file.\n   This document\
    \ specifies a syntax based on the generic syntax of\n   [RFC3986] that is compatible\
    \ with most existing usages.  Where\n   incompatibilities arise, they are usually\
    \ in parts of the scheme that\n   were underspecified in earlier definitions and\
    \ have been tightened up\n   by more recent specifications.  Appendix A lists\
    \ significant changes\n   to syntax.\n   Extensions to the syntax that might be\
    \ encountered in practice are\n   listed in Appendix E; these extensions are listed\
    \ for informational\n   purposes and are not a requirement of implementation.\n\
    \   The file URI scheme is not coupled with a specific protocol nor with\n   a\
    \ specific media type [RFC6838].  See Section 3 for a discussion of\n   operations\
    \ that can be performed on the object identified by a file\n   URI.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119] when they\n   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in\
    \ lower or mixed\n   case as English words, without normative meaning.\n   Throughout\
    \ this document, the term \"local file\" is used to describe\n   files that can\
    \ be accessed through the local file system API using\n   only the information\
    \ included in the file path, not relying on other\n   information (such as network\
    \ addresses).  It is important to note\n   that a local file may not be physically\
    \ located on the local machine,\n   for example, if a networked file system is\
    \ transparently mounted into\n   the local file system.\n   The term \"local file\
    \ URI\" is used to describe file URIs that have no\n   \"authority\" component\
    \ or where the authority is the special string\n   \"localhost\" or a fully qualified\
    \ domain name that resolves to the\n   machine from which the URI is being interpreted\
    \ (Section 2).\n"
- title: 2.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.  Syntax\n   The file URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form\n\
    \   (ABNF) [RFC5234], importing the \"host\" and \"path-absolute\" rules from\n\
    \   [RFC3986] (as updated by [RFC6874]).\n   The generic syntax in [RFC3986] includes\
    \ \"path\" and \"authority\"\n   components, for each of which only a subset is\
    \ used in the definition\n   of the file URI scheme.  The relevant subset of \"\
    path\" is \"path-\n   absolute\", and the subset of \"authority\" is \"file-auth\"\
    , given below.\n   The syntax definition below is different from those given in\n\
    \   [RFC1630] and [RFC1738] as it is derived from the generic syntax of\n   [RFC3986],\
    \ which postdates the previous file URI specifications.\n   Appendix A enumerates\
    \ significant differences.\n      file-URI       = file-scheme \":\" file-hier-part\n\
    \      file-scheme    = \"file\"\n      file-hier-part = ( \"//\" auth-path )\n\
    \                     / local-path\n      auth-path      = [ file-auth ] path-absolute\n\
    \      local-path     = path-absolute\n      file-auth      = \"localhost\"\n\
    \                     / host\n   The \"host\" is the fully qualified domain name\
    \ of the system on which\n   the file is accessible.  This allows a client on\
    \ another system to\n   know that it cannot access the file system, or perhaps\
    \ that it needs\n   to use some other local mechanism to access the file.\n  \
    \ As a special case, the \"file-auth\" rule can match the string\n   \"localhost\"\
    \ that is interpreted as \"the machine from which the URI is\n   being interpreted,\"\
    \ exactly as if no authority were present.  Some\n   current usages of the scheme\
    \ incorrectly interpret all values in the\n   authority of a file URI, including\
    \ \"localhost\", as non-local.  Yet\n   others interpret any value as local, even\
    \ if the \"host\" does not\n   resolve to the local machine.  To maximize compatibility\
    \ with\n   previous specifications, users MAY choose to include an \"auth-path\"\
    \n   with no \"file-auth\" when creating a URI.\n   The path component represents\
    \ the absolute path to the file in the\n   file system.  See Appendix D for some\
    \ discussion of system-specific\n   concerns including absolute file paths and\
    \ file system roots.\n   Some file systems have case-sensitive file naming and\
    \ some do not.\n   As such, the file URI scheme supports case sensitivity in order\
    \ to\n   retain the case as given.  Any transport-related handling of the file\n\
    \   URI scheme MUST retain the case as given.  Any mapping to or from a\n   case-insensitive\
    \ form is solely the responsibility of the\n   implementation processing the file\
    \ URI on behalf of the referenced\n   file system.\n   Also see Appendix E, which\
    \ lists some nonstandard syntax variations\n   that can be encountered in practice.\n"
- title: 3.  Operations Involving <file> URIs
  contents:
  - "3.  Operations Involving <file> URIs\n   See the POSIX file and directory operations\
    \ [POSIX] for examples of\n   standardized operations that can be performed on\
    \ files.\n   A file URI can be dependably dereferenced or translated to a local\n\
    \   file path only if it is local.  A file URI is considered \"local\" if\n  \
    \ it has no \"file-auth\", or the \"file-auth\" is the special string\n   \"localhost\"\
    , or a fully qualified domain name that resolves to the\n   machine from which\
    \ the URI is being interpreted (Section 2).\n   This specification neither defines\
    \ nor forbids any set of operations\n   that might be performed on a file identified\
    \ by a non-local file URI.\n"
- title: 4.  File System Name Encoding
  contents:
  - "4.  File System Name Encoding\n   File systems use various encoding schemes to\
    \ store file and directory\n   names.  Many modern file systems store file and\
    \ directory names as\n   arbitrary sequences of octets, in which case the representation\
    \ as an\n   encoded string often depends on the user's localization settings or\n\
    \   defaults to UTF-8 [STD63].\n   When a file URI is produced that represents\
    \ textual data consisting\n   of characters from the Unicode Standard coded character\
    \ set\n   [UNICODE], the data SHOULD be encoded as octets according to the\n \
    \  UTF-8 character encoding scheme [STD63] before percent-encoding is\n   applied\
    \ (as per Section 2.5 of [RFC3986]).\n   A decision not to use percent-encoded\
    \ UTF-8 is outside the scope of\n   this specification.  It will typically require\
    \ the use of heuristics\n   or explicit knowledge about the way the string will\
    \ be processed.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are many security considerations for URI\
    \ schemes discussed in\n   [RFC3986].\n   File access and the granting of privileges\
    \ for specific operations\n   are complex topics, and the use of file URIs can\
    \ complicate the\n   security model in effect for file privileges.\n   Historically,\
    \ user agents have granted content from the file URI\n   scheme a tremendous amount\
    \ of privilege.  However, granting all local\n   files such wide privileges can\
    \ lead to privilege escalation attacks.\n   Some user agents have had success\
    \ granting local files directory-\n   based privileges, but this approach has\
    \ not been widely adopted.\n   Other user agents use globally unique identifiers\
    \ as the origin for\n   each file URI [RFC6454], which is the most secure option.\n\
    \   Treating a non-local file URI as local, or otherwise attempting to\n   perform\
    \ local operations on a non-local URI, can result in security\n   problems.\n\
    \   File systems typically assign an operational meaning to special\n   characters,\
    \ such as the \"/\", \"\\\", \":\", \"[\", and \"]\" characters, and\n   to special\
    \ device names like \".\", \"..\", \"...\", \"aux\", \"lpt\", etc.  In\n   some\
    \ cases, merely testing for the existence of such a name will\n   cause the operating\
    \ system to pause or invoke unrelated system calls,\n   leading to significant\
    \ security concerns regarding denial of service\n   and unintended data transfer.\
    \  It would not be possible for this\n   specification to list all such significant\
    \ characters and device\n   names.  Implementers should research the reserved\
    \ names and\n   characters for the types of storage devices that may be attached\
    \ to\n   their application and restrict the use of data obtained from URI\n  \
    \ components accordingly.\n   File systems vary in the way they handle case. \
    \ Care must be taken to\n   avoid issues resulting from possibly unexpected aliasing\
    \ from case-\n   only differences between file paths or URIs or from mismatched\n\
    \   encodings or Unicode equivalences [UAX15] (see Section 4).\n"
