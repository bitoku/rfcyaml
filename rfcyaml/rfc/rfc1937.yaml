- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The IP architecture assumes that each Data Link subnetwork is labeled\n\
    \   with a single IP subnet number. A pair of hosts with the same subnet\n   number\
    \ communicate directly  (with no routers); a pair of hosts with\n   different\
    \ subnet numbers always communicate through one or more\n   routers. As indicated\
    \ in RFC1620, these assumptions may be too\n   restrictive for large data networks,\
    \ and specifically for networks\n   based on switched virtual circuit (SVC) based\
    \ technologies (e.g. ATM,\n   Frame Relay, X.25), as these assumptions impose\
    \ constraints on\n   communication among hosts and routers through a network.\
    \  The\n   restrictions may preclude full utilization of the capabilities\n  \
    \ provided by the underlying SVC-based Data Link subnetwork.  This\n   document\
    \ describes extensions to the IP architecture that relaxes\n   these constraints,\
    \ thus enabling the full utilization of the services\n   provided by SVC-based\
    \ Data Link subnetworks.\n"
- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   The following briefly recaptures the concept of the IP Subnet.\
    \  The\n   topology is assumed to be composed of hosts and routers\n   interconnected\
    \ via links (Data Link subnetworks).  An IP address of a\n   host with an interface\
    \ attached to a particular link is a tuple\n   <prefix length, address prefix,\
    \ host number>, where host number is\n   unique within the subnet address prefix.\
    \  When a host needs to send\n   an IP packet to a destination, the host needs\
    \ to determine whether\n   the destination address identifies an interface that\
    \ is connected to\n   one of the links the host is attached to, or not.  This\
    \ referred to\n   as the \"local/remote\" decision. The outcome of the \"local/remote\"\
    \n   decision is based on (a) the destination address, and (b) the address\n \
    \  and the prefix length associated with the the local interfaces.  If\n   the\
    \ outcome is \"local\", then the host resolves the IP address to a\n   Link Layer\
    \ address (e.g. by using ARP), and then sends the packet\n   directly to that\
    \ destination (using the Link layer services).  If the\n   outcome is \"remote\"\
    , then the host uses one of its first-hop routers\n   (thus relying on the services\
    \ provided by IP routing).\n   To summarize, two of the important attributes of\
    \ the IP subnet model\n   are:\n      hosts with a common subnet address prefix\
    \ are assumed to be\n      attached to a common link (subnetwork), and thus communicate\
    \ with\n      each other directly, without any routers - \"local\";\n      hosts\
    \ with different subnet address prefixes are assumed to be\n      attached to\
    \ different links (subnetworks), and thus communicate\n      with each other only\
    \ through routers - \"remote\".\n   A typical example of applying the IP subnet\
    \ architecture to an SVC-\n   based Data Link subnetwork is \"Classical IP and\
    \ ARP over ATM\"\n   (RFC1577).  RFC1577 provides support for ATM deployment that\
    \ follows\n   the traditional IP subnet model and introduces the notion of a\n\
    \   Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS).  The consequence of this model is that a\n  \
    \ host is required to setup an ATM SVC to any host within its LIS; for\n   destinations\
    \ outside its LIS the host must forward packets through a\n   router.  It is important\
    \ to stress that this \"local/remote\" decision\n   is based solely on the information\
    \ carried by the destination address\n   and the address and prefix lengths associated\
    \ with the local\n   interfaces.\n"
- title: 2.  Motivations
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivations\n   The diversity of TCP/IP applications results in a wide range\
    \ of\n   traffic characteristics.  Some applications last for a very short\n \
    \  time and generate only a small number of packets between a pair of\n   communicating\
    \ hosts (e.g. ping, DNS). Other applications have a short\n   lifetime, but generate\
    \ a relatively large volume of packets (e.g.\n   FTP). There are also applications\
    \ that have a relatively long\n   lifetime, but generate relatively few packets\
    \ (e.g.  Telnet).\n   Finally, we anticipate the emergence of applications that\
    \ have a\n   relatively long lifetime and generate a large volume of packets (e.g.\n\
    \   video-conferencing).\n   SVC-based Data Link subnetworks offer certain unique\
    \ capabilities\n   that are not present in other (non-SVC) subnetworks (e.g. Ethernet,\n\
    \   Token Ring).  The ability to dynamically establish and tear-down SVCs\n  \
    \ between communicating entities attached to an SVC-based Data Link\n   subnetwork\
    \ enables the dynamic dedication and redistribution of\n   certain communication\
    \ resources (e.g. bandwidth) among the entities.\n   This dedication and redistribution\
    \ of resources could be accomplished\n   by relying solely on the mechanism(s)\
    \ provided by the Data Link\n   layer.\n   The unique capabilities provided by\
    \ SVC-based Data Link subnetworks\n   do not come \"for free\".  The mechanisms\
    \ that provide dedication and\n   redistribution of resources have certain overhead\
    \ (e.g. the time\n   needed to establish an SVC, resources associated with maintaining\
    \ a\n   state for an SVC). There may also be a monetary cost associated with\n\
    \   establishing and maintaining an SVC. Therefore, it is very important\n   to\
    \ be cognizant of such an overhead and to carefully balance the\n   benefits provided\
    \ by the mechanisms against the overhead introduced\n   by such mechanisms.\n\
    \   One of the key issues for using SVC-based Data Link subnetworks in\n   the\
    \ TCP/IP environment is the issue of switched virtual circuit (SVC)\n   management.\
    \  This includes SVC establishment and tear-down, class of\n   service specification,\
    \ and SVC sharing.  At one end of the spectrum\n   one could require SVC establishment\
    \ between communicating entities\n   (on a common Data Link subnetwork) for any\
    \ application. At the other\n   end of the spectrum, one could require communicating\
    \ entities to\n   always go through a router, regardless of the application. \
    \ Given the\n   diversity of TCP/IP applications, either extreme is likely to\
    \ yield a\n   suboptimal solution with respect to the ability to efficiently\n\
    \   exploit capabilities provided by the underlying Data Link layer.\n   The traditional\
    \ IP subnet model is too restrictive for flexible and\n   adaptive use of SVC-based\
    \ Data Link subnetworks - the use of a\n   subnetwork is driven by information\
    \ completely unrelated to the\n   characteristics of individual applications.\
    \  To illustrate the\n   problem consider \"Classical IP and ARP over ATM\" (RFC1577).\
    \  RFC1577\n   provides support for ATM deployment that follows the traditional\
    \ IP\n   subnet model, and introduces the notion of a Logical IP Subnetwork\n\
    \   (LIS).  The consequence of this model is that a host is required to\n   setup\
    \ an SVC to any host within its LIS, and it must forward packets\n   to destinations\
    \ outside its LIS through a router.  This\n   \"local/remote\" forwarding decision,\
    \ and consequently the SVC\n   management, is based solely on the information\
    \ carried in the source\n   and destination addresses and the subnet mask associated\
    \ with the\n   source address and has no relation to the nature of the applications\n\
    \   that generated these packets.\n"
- title: 3.  QoS/Traffic Driven "Local/Remote" Decision
  contents:
  - "3.  QoS/Traffic Driven \"Local/Remote\" Decision\n   Consider a host attached\
    \ to an SVC-based Data Link subnetwork, and\n   assume that the \"local/remote\"\
    \ decision the host could make is not\n   constrained by the IP subnet model.\
    \ When such a host needs to send a\n   packet to a destination, the host might\
    \ consider any of the following\n   options:\n      Use a best-effort SVC to the\
    \ first hop router.\n      Use an SVC to the first hop router dedicated to a particular\
    \ type\n      of service (ie: predictive real time).\n      Use a dedicated SVC\
    \ to the first hop router.\n      Use a best-effort SVC to a router closer to\
    \ the destination than\n      the first hop router.\n      Use an SVC to a router\
    \ closer to the destination than the first\n      hop router dedicated to a particular\
    \ type of service.\n      Use a dedicated SVC to a router closer to the destination\
    \ than the\n      first hop router.\n      Use a best-effort SVC directly to the\
    \ destination (if the\n      destination is on the same Data Link subnetwork as\
    \ the host).\n      Use an SVC directly to the destination dedicated to a particular\n\
    \      type of service (if the destination is on the same Data Link\n      subnetwork\
    \ as the host).\n      Use a dedicated SVC directly to the destination (if the\n\
    \      destination is on the same Data Link subnetwork as the host).\n   In the\
    \ above we observe that the forwarding decision at the host is\n   more flexible\
    \ than the \"local/remote\" decision of the IP subnet\n   model. We also observe\
    \ that the host's forwarding decision may take\n   into account QoS and/or traffic\
    \ requirements of the applications\n   and/or cost factors associated with establishing\
    \ and maintaining a\n   VC, and thus improve the overall SVC management. Therefore,\
    \ removing\n   constraints imposed by the IP subnet model is an important step\n\
    \   towards better SVC management.\n"
- title: 3.1 Extending the scope of possible "local" outcomes
  contents:
  - "3.1 Extending the scope of possible \"local\" outcomes\n   A source may have\
    \ an SVC (either dedicated or shared) to a\n   destination if both the source\
    \ and the destination are on a common\n   Data Link subnetwork. The ability to\
    \ create and use the SVC (either\n   dedicated or shared) is completely decoupled\
    \ from the source and\n   destination IP addresses, but is instead coupled to\
    \ the QoS and/or\n   traffic characteristics of the application. In other words,\
    \ the\n   ability to establish a direct VC (either dedicated or shared) between\n\
    \   a pair of hosts on a common Data Link subnetwork has nothing to do\n   with\
    \ the IP addresses of the hosts. In contrast with the IP subnet\n   model (or\
    \ the LIS mode), the \"local\" outcome becomes divorced from\n   the addressing\
    \ information.\n"
- title: 3.2 Allowing the "remote" outcome where applicable
  contents:
  - "3.2 Allowing the \"remote\" outcome where applicable\n   A source may go through\
    \ one or more routers to reach a destination if\n   either (a) the destination\
    \ is not on the same Data Link subnetwork as\n   the source, or (b) the destination\
    \ is on the same Data Link\n   subnetwork as the source, but the QoS and/or traffic\
    \ requirements of\n   the application on the source do not justify a direct (either\n\
    \   dedicated or shared) VC.\n   When the destination is not on the same Data\
    \ Link subnetwork as the\n   source, the source may select between either (a)\
    \ using its first-hop\n   (default) router, or (b) establishing a \"shortcut\"\
    \ to a router closer\n   to the destination than the first-hop router.  The source\
    \ should be\n   able to select between these two choices irrespective of the source\n\
    \   and destination IP addresses.\n   When the destination is on the same Data\

- title: 3.3 Sufficient conditions for direct connectivity
  contents:
  - "3.3 Sufficient conditions for direct connectivity\n   The ability of a host to\
    \ establish an SVC to a peer  on a common\n   switched Data Link subnetwork is\
    \ predicated on its knowledge  of the\n   Link Layer address of the peer or an\
    \ intermediate point closer to the\n   destination.  This document assumes the\
    \ existence of mechanism(s)\n   that can provide the host with this information.\
    \ Some of the possible\n   alternatives are NHRP, ARP, or static configuration;\
    \ other\n   alternatives are not precluded.  The ability to acquire the Link\n\
    \   Layer address of the peer should not be viewed as an indication that\n   the\
    \ host and the peer can establish an SVC - the two may be on\n   different Data\
    \ Link subnetworks, or may be on a common Data Link\n   subnetwork that is partitioned.\n"
- title: 3.4 Some of the implications
  contents:
  - "3.4 Some of the implications\n   Since the \"local/remote\" decision would depend\
    \ on factors other than\n   the addresses of the source and the destination, a\
    \ pair of hosts may\n   simultaneously be using two different means to reach each\
    \ other,\n   forwarding traffic for applications with different QoS/and or traffic\n\
    \   characteristics differently.\n"
- title: 3.5 Address assignment
  contents:
  - "3.5 Address assignment\n   It is expected that if the total number of hosts and\
    \ routers on a\n   common SVC-based Data Link subnetwork is sufficiently large,\
    \ then the\n   hosts and routers could be partitioned into groups, called Local\n\
    \   Addressing Groups (LAGs). Each LAG would have hosts and routers. The\n   routers\
    \ within a LAG would act as the first-hop routers for the hosts\n   in the LAG.\
    \ If the total number of hosts and routers is not large,\n   then all these hosts\
    \ and routers could form a single LAG. Criteria\n   for determining LAG sizes\
    \ are outside the scope of this document.\n   To provide scalable routing each\
    \ LAG should be given an IP address\n   prefix, and elements within the LAG should\
    \ be assigned addresses out\n   of this prefix. The routers in a LAG would then\
    \ advertise (via\n   appropriate routing protocols) routes to the prefix associated\
    \ with\n   the LAG. These routes would be advertised as \"directly reachable\"\
    \n   (with metric 0). Thus, routers within a LAG would act as the last-hop\n \
    \  routers for the hosts within the LAG.\n"

  - "4. Conclusions\n   Different approaches to SVC-based Data Link subnetworks used\
    \ by\n   TCP/IP yield substantially different results with respect to the\n  \
    \ ability of TCP/IP applications to efficiently exploit the\n   functionality\
    \ provided by such subnetworks.  For example, in the case\n   of ATM both LAN\
    \ Emulation [LANE] and \"classical\" IP over ATM\n   [RFC1577] localize host changes\
    \ below the IP layer, and therefore may\n   be good first steps in the ATM deployment.\
    \  However, these approaches\n   alone are likely to be inadequate for the full\
    \ utilization of ATM.\n   It appears that any model that does not allow SVC management\
    \ based on\n   QoS and/or traffic requirements will preempt the full use of SVC-\n\
    \   based Data Link subnetworks.  Enabling more direct connectivity for\n   applications\
    \ that could benefit from the functionality provided by\n   SVC-based Data Link\
    \ subnetworks, while relying on strict hop by hop\n   paths for other applications,\
    \ could facilitate exploration of the\n   capabilities provided by these subnetworks.\n\
    \   While this document does not define any specific coupling between\n   various\
    \ QoS, traffic characteristics and other parameters, and SVC\n   management, it\
    \ is important to stress that efforts towards\n   standardization of various QoS,\
    \ traffic characteristics, and other\n   parameters than an application could\
    \ use (through an appropriate API)\n   to influence SVC management are essential\
    \ for flexible and adaptive\n   use of SVC-based Data Link subnetworks.\n   The\
    \ proposed model utilizes the SVC-based infrastructure for the\n   applications\
    \ that could benefit from the capabilities supported\n   within such an infrastructure,\
    \ and takes advantage of a router-based\n   overlay for all other applications.\
    \  As such it provides a balanced\n   mix of router-based and switch-based infrastructures,\
    \ where the\n   balance could be determined by the applications requirements.\n"
