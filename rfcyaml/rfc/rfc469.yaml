  - "Conclusions\n   Additional FTP mail requirements were decided upon.  These would\
    \ be\n   implemented as a new mail command, with the following subcommands:\n\
    \      TO\n         This field is explicitly allowed to contain multiple\n   \
    \      addressees, with a standard syntax:  user@host.\n      FROM\n         This\
    \ field provides a return-address for notification of\n         undeliverable\
    \ mail, as well as a clearcut identification of the\n         sender for the recipient's\
    \ information..\n      AUTHOR\n         This field denotes the author of the mail.\
    \  There may be\n         multiple authors\n      TITLE\n         The \"title\"\
    \ (i.e. subject) of the mail is to be terminated by\n         period carriage\
    \ return.\n      ACKNOWLEDEGMENT  success / failure (time out) / normal\n    \
    \     For use by the intermediate host, probably the NIC in most\n         cases,\
    \ to tell the sender what happened to his attempt to send\n         mail.  (Note:\
    \  \"normal\" wasn't defined.)\n      RECORDED  jnumber / null\n         Note:\
    \ \"jnumber\" is the pre-assigned accession number (NIC\n         number), to\
    \ be used when known.\n         The \"RECORDED\" subcommand provides for the option\
    \ of having the\n         mail recorded.  Information given with this subcommand\
    \ would be\n         recognized at the NIC. Options are:\n            to be recorded\
    \ (in NIC journal) only,\n            to be recorded and distributed,\n      \
    \      to be distributed only.\n         This field would also be used to inform\
    \ the recipient that the\n         mail has been recorded.\n            (In retrospect,\
    \ it may be preferable to have a separate\n            command to inform the recipient\
    \ of this fact, but no\n            decision on this was made at the 23-Feb-73\
    \ meeting.)\n      TYPE  long / urgent / ordinary\n         This allows the recipient\
    \ site to take whatever action it\n         thinks appropriate in storing the\
    \ mail.\n      TEXT / FILE / CITATION\n         TEXT\n            This field is\
    \ for the text of the mail message.\n      FILE\n         The purpose of the field\
    \ is unclear to me.  Does it contain a\n         machine readable pointer to the\
    \ file that the sender wishes the\n         recipient to read?\n      CITATION\n\
    \         This field is a person-readable pointer to the file that the\n     \
    \    sender wishes the recipient to read.  When the citation command\n       \
    \  is used, no mail is sent other than the citation.\n"

  - "Discussion\n   Introduction\n      The key aspects in the solution are:\n   \
    \      1) It is based on FTP.\n         2) It uses the NIC without requiring direct\
    \ use of NLS.\n         3) There is a mechanism for uniformity in the use of\n\
    \         user identifications.\n         4) There is a mechanism for recording\
    \ the mail for\n         later reference.\n      These issues are covered in the\
    \ discussion that follows.\n"
- title: New FTP Mail Subcommands
  contents:
  - "New FTP Mail Subcommands\n   TO\n      Addressee Format\n         The standard\
    \ form of the address is:  user@host\n         \"User\" may be an individual's\
    \ last name; or it may be whatever\n         other identification the recipient\
    \ has chosen AND has made\n         known to the rest of the network.\n      \
    \      If the intended host doesn't recognize the intended\n            recipient's\
    \ identification, then it sends back an\n            \"undeliverable\" mail message\
    \ to the sender's host.  It is up\n            to the individual to keep the NIC\
    \ informed of his wherabouts\n            [sic]; otherwise, he may not get his\
    \ mail on time.\n      NIC Role\n         The NIC need have no role at all for\
    \ mail sent from point A to\n         point B, whenever that mail is not to be\
    \ recorded at the NIC.\n         For mail that is to be recorded at the NIC, the\
    \ RECORDED\n         subcommand is to be used.\n         Also, when the sender\
    \ does not know the standard address of the\n         recipients, he may use the\
    \ NIC to obtain this information.\n      Idents and Addresses\n         The NIC\
    \ will modify its identification files to include the\n         \"user@host\"\
    \ standard address for each individual.\n            Sites may ask the NIC to\
    \ translate from NIC Ident, or from a\n            user's last name, to the standard\
    \ address.  A query facility\n            will be made available at the NIC to\
    \ do the translation on\n            request.  The translation service will also\
    \ be available for\n            \"group idents\".\n            This service would\
    \ be FTP-like, in term of the prootocol\n            [sic] it accepts, but would\
    \ not be within FTP itself.  A\n            different server process would handle\
    \ Ident translation\n            requests.\n            Translation will also\
    \ be done at the NIC when the NIC is\n            used as an intermediate point\
    \ on the delivery route.\n               The NIC could be an intermediate point\
    \ for recording the\n               mail as a NIC journal item, and for forwarding\
    \ the mail\n               to its ultimate destinations.  During this process,\
    \ the\n               NIC would translate from NIC idents to standard\n      \
    \         addresses.\n      In the NIC ident files, provision already exists to\
    \ specify\n      hardcopy or on-line delivery of recorded (NIC Journal) mail.\n\
    \            This provision will be extended to include a \"network\"\n      \
    \      attribute, which means \"deliver the mail to the host of this\n       \
    \     person\".\n            The network attribute may be qualified by restricting\
    \ all\n            mail to be kept at the sender, with only a notification\n \
    \           message actually mailed.\n            Notification would be in the\
    \ form of a citation giving \"to\",\n            \"from\", \"title\", \"date of\
    \ submission\", and \"location of\n            mail\".\n      TIP Users\n    \
    \     To enable TIP users to have access to the mail system, both for\n      \
    \   sending and receiving mail, it was suggested that some hosts\n         will\
    \ have to be the \"home\" site for these users (but no more\n         than one\
    \ \"home\" site per user).\n         That is, an account that allows a TIP user\
    \ to send and receive\n         mail will have to be established at such a host.\n\
    \            For the present, any TIP user can use the SRI-ARC system for\n  \
    \          his mail requirements.\n         An alternate solution, that TIP's\
    \ be equipped with a hardcopy\n         device that is continuously available\
    \ for printing mail, was\n         discarded in favor of the above approach.\n\
    \   FROM\n      The \"FROM\" command in FTP, identifies the sender in \"standard\n\
    \      address\" form.\n         This will allow \"undeliverable\" mail notices\
    \ to be sent back to\n         the originator.\n            The default condition\
    \ is that the sender's host must retain\n            the mail until it is \"delivered\"\
    \ to the recipient's host.\n               \"Delivered\"  means that the recipient's\
    \ host has accepted\n               the mail. It does NOT mean that the recipient\
    \ has READ\n               the mail.\n            Alternatively, the sender may\
    \ designate that an intermediate\n            host store the mail.  Then the intermediate\
    \ host has the\n            responsibility of storing the mail until it is \"\
    delivered\"\n            to all intended recipients.\n         The \"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\"\
    \ command will allow an optional, positive\n         acknowledgement to be given\
    \ to the originator of the mail (the\n         \"FROM\" addressee), stating that\
    \ the mail was delivered.\n   AUTHOR\n      The AUTHOR may be several persons.\
    \ For recorded documents the\n      authors appear separately in the index of\
    \ authors, to facilitate\n      searching for mail when an author is known, but\
    \ the title and\n      location of the mail are unknown.\n   TITLE\n      The\
    \ TITLE field is especially useful for recorded mail, since\n      indexes on\
    \ key words in the title can be produced relatively\n      easily, and facilitate\
    \ searching for mail.\n      For this reason, the title should be a succinct indicator\
    \ of the\n      contents.\n   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n      Acknowledgement of failure\
    \ to deliver should be given to the\n      sender.\n         An optional, positive\
    \ acknowledgement of successful delivery to\n         the recipient's sitename\
    \ will be given on request of sender\n         (like U.S. CERTIFIED mail).\n \
    \        No acknowledgement that the recipient actually saw the mail\n       \
    \  will be given (comparable to not having U.S. REGISTERED mail).\n   RECORDED\n\
    \      The concept of \"recorded\" mail is that a permanent record of the\n  \
    \    mail is kept centrally, to allow future references and re-readings\n    \
    \  of the mail to be made.\n         For example, in the NIC Journal system, a\
    \ record is kept of all\n         the items entered into the Journal.  From this\
    \ record, author,\n         title-word, and NIC number indexes are produced to\
    \ allow for\n         references and re-readings.\n         The key to retrieval\
    \ of recorded Journal items is the use of an\n         accession number (the NIC\
    \ number).  This essentially removes\n         the possibility of duplicate filenames\
    \ being used.\n      The basic aspect of recorded mail which was discussed at\
    \ the mail\n      meeting is the assignment of an \"accession\" number.\n    \
    \     It was decided to get the accession numbers from the NIC on an\n       \
    \  as-needed basis, without pre-assignment and without local\n         assignment\
    \ of numbers.\n         This subject may be reviewed in the future.  Local assignment\n\
    \         may be desirable to prevent the NIC from becoming a bottleneck\n   \
    \      in the mail process.\n         It was pointed out that local assignment\
    \ of numbers would be\n         un-ambiguous if the numbers included some information\
    \ such as\n         sitename, date, and time.\n      One other problem exits [sic],\
    \ namely \"where is the recorded\n      document?\".\n         Initially the document\
    \ should be in the NIC, but ultimately it\n         could be anywhere on the Network,\
    \ provided only that there is a\n         central mechanism for indexing and cataloging\
    \ all the recorded\n         documents.\n         The pathname to the recorded\
    \ document would then include\n         filename and sitename.\n   TYPE\n    \
    \  The TYPE subcommand was a result of a discussion on the\n      problems of\
    \ large mail files, and the associated\n      question of who would pay for the\
    \ processing and storing\n      of these files.\n      The main decisions made\
    \ were:\n         a) The processing, transmittal, and storage costs of\n     \
    \    sending mail should be borne at the sender's host.\n         b) The processing\
    \ and storage costs of receiving\n         mail should be borne at the recipient's\
    \ host\n         initially, as a default.\n      Information to enable the recipient\
    \ host to make an\n      intelligent decision about where to store the incoming\n\
    \      mail are passed along via the TYPE command.\n         The recipient host\
    \ will have the local option of\n         providing either of the following services:\n\
    \            a) free use of system to send mail;\n            b) free use of system\
    \ to receive mail, i.e. login\n            not required for delivery over the\
    \ Network.  (A\n            possible alternative is use of a \"mail\" account,\n\
    \            or use of the recipient's account, for processing\n            and\
    \ storage of the incoming mail.\n   TEXT / FILE / CITATION\n      TEXT\n     \
    \    This field is for the text of the mail message.\n      FILE\n         The\
    \ purpose of this field is unclear to me.  Does it contain a\n         machine\
    \ readable pointer to the file that the sender wishes the\n         recipient\
    \ to read?\n      CITATION\n         The citation is a person-readable pointer\
    \ to the file that the\n         sender wishes the recipient to read.\n      \
    \   An alternative to sending entire messages or files over the\n         Network\
    \ is to use the \"CITATION\" mechanism. With this, the\n         sender sends\
    \ a short message (the citation) saying, in effect,\n         \"please read file\
    \ X at site Y\".\n            This alternative would be especially useful for\n\
    \            a) mail that is distributed with group idents (to all\n         \
    \   liaisons, for example), and\n            b) \"long\" files (size not defined)\
    \ that the recipient may\n            not be immediately interested in.\n    \
    \        However no method of enforcing use of this alternative was\n        \
    \    discussed.  It will be up to the recipients to devise a\n            scheme\
    \ satisfactory to them.\n"
- title: Other General Discussion
  contents:
  - "Other General Discussion\n   Bob Kahn placed on the floor the following question\
    \ (I paraphrase):\n      Can't the design of a mail system be made to include\
    \ alternative\n      sources of data and alternative modes of operation, unless\n\
    \      exclusion of these alternatives can be quantitatively defended?\n     \
    \ Particular aspects of this question are:\n      1) What is the desirability\
    \ and difficulty of admitting different\n      data sources into the mail system?\n\
    \         What are the \"boundaries\" that divide permitted from prohibited\n\
    \         data sources?\n         What is the quantitative distinction between\
    \ deferred and\n         realtime mail?\n         Will the design we come up with\
    \ allow such things as\n            a) handling a calendar that reflects the known\
    \ and\n            anticipated whereabouts of people so that meetings can be\n\
    \            scheduled sensibly?\n            b) formatting the mail contents\
    \ for later query and other\n            information handling?\n      2) Whatever\
    \ primitives we implement, can't they be designed so as\n      not to preclude\
    \ things like Tenex \"linking\"?\n         This requires two-way data communication\
    \ paths.\n         How do we specify and get the attention of a \"sink\" for the\n\
    \         data stream?\n            e.g., for interprocess communication, and\
    \ for Tenex-type\n            \"linking\".\n   The general reaction to this discussion\
    \ was one of perspective:\n      In the scheme of things that could be considered\
    \ \"point-to-point\n      communication\", mailbox-type of communication is not\
    \ the most\n      general kind.\n      AKB listed several types of communication\
    \ problems:\n         program-program communication\n         people-people real-time\
    \ communication,  e.g.\n         Tenex-type \"links\"\n         computer teleconferencing\n\
    \         mailbox communication: cataloging, storage\n         protocols: host-host,\
    \ telnet, file transfer\n      A design for a mailbox-type system won't be required\
    \ to encompass\n      the problems of, say, a computer teleconferencing system,\
    \ which\n      has attributes (real-time, video, very large volume of data to\
    \ be\n      transferred, to name some) that are not attributes of a mail box\n\
    \      system.\n"
