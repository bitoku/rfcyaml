- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP has three main components:\n      1. A method for encapsulating\
    \ multi-protocol datagrams.\n      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,\
    \ configuring,\n         and testing the data-link connection.\n      3. A family\
    \ of Network Control Protocols for establishing and\n         configuring different\
    \ network-layer protocols.\n   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point\
    \ link, each\n   end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to configure\
    \ and test\n   the data link.  After the link has been established and optional\n\
    \   facilities have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, PPP must send\n   XNSCP\
    \ packets to choose and configure the XNS IDP network-layer\n   protocol.  Once\
    \ XNSCP has reached the Opened state, XNS IDP datagrams\n   can be sent over the\
    \ link.\n   The link will remain configured for communications until explicit\
    \ LCP\n   or XNSCP packets close the link down, or until some external event\n\
    \   occurs (an inactivity timer expires or network administrator\n   intervention).\n"
- title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, several words are used\
    \ to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are often\
    \ capitalized.\n   MUST      This word, or the adjective \"required\", means that\
    \ the\n             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.\n\
    \   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute\n         \
    \    prohibition of the specification.\n   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective\
    \ \"recommended\", means that there\n             may exist valid reasons in particular\
    \ circumstances to\n             ignore this item, but the full implications must\
    \ be\n             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a\n      \
    \       different course.\n   MAY       This word, or the adjective \"optional\"\
    , means that this\n             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.\
    \  An\n             implementation which does not include this option MUST be\n\
    \             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which\n   \
    \          does include the option.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).\n    \
    \         A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets\n            \
    \ passed to the data link layer.\n   frame     The unit of transmission at the\
    \ data link layer.  A frame\n             may include a header and/or a trailer,\
    \ along with some\n             number of units of data.\n   packet    The basic\
    \ unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the\n             interface between\
    \ the network layer and the data link\n             layer.  A packet is usually\
    \ mapped to a frame; the\n             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation\
    \ is being\n             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated\
    \ into a\n             single frame.\n   peer      The other end of the point-to-point\
    \ link.\n   silently discard\n             This means the implementation discards\
    \ the packet without\n             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD\
    \ provide the\n             capability of logging the error, including the contents\
    \ of\n             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n\
    \             in a statistics counter.\n"
- title: 2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for XNS IDP
  contents:
  - "2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for XNS IDP\n   The XNS IDP Control Protocol\
    \ (XNSCP) is responsible for configuring,\n   enabling, and disabling the XNS\
    \ IDP protocol modules on both ends of\n   the point-to-point link.  XNSCP uses\
    \ the same packet exchange\n   mechanism as the Link Control Protocol (LCP). \
    \ XNSCP packets may not\n   be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-Layer\
    \ Protocol phase.\n   XNSCP packets received before this phase is reached should\
    \ be\n   silently discarded.\n   The XNS IDP Control Protocol is exactly the same\
    \ as the Link Control\n   Protocol [1] with the following exceptions:\n   Frame\
    \ Modifications\n      The packet may utilize any modifications to the basic frame\
    \ format\n      which have been negotiated during the Link Establishment phase.\n\
    \   Data Link Layer Protocol Field\n      Exactly one XNSCP packet is encapsulated\
    \ in the Information field\n      of a PPP Data Link Layer frame, where the PPP\
    \ Protocol field\n      indicates type hex 8025 (XNS IDP Control Protocol).\n\
    \   Code field\n      Only Codes 1 through 7 (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack,\n\
    \      Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject, Terminate-Request, Terminate-Ack\n   \
    \   and Code-Reject) are used.  Other Codes should be treated as\n      unrecognized\
    \ and should result in Code-Rejects.\n   Timeouts\n      XNSCP packets may not\
    \ be exchanged until PPP has reached the\n      Network-Layer Protocol phase.\
    \  An implementation should be\n      prepared to wait for Authentication and\
    \ Link Quality Determination\n      to finish before timing out waiting for a\
    \ Configure-Ack or other\n      response.  It is suggested that an implementation\
    \ give up only\n      after user intervention or a configurable amount of time.\n\
    \   Configuration Option Types\n      XNSCP has no Configuration Options.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Sending XNS IDP Datagrams
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Sending XNS IDP Datagrams\n   Before any XNS IDP packets may be communicated,\
    \ PPP must reach the\n   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the XNS IDP Control\
    \ Protocol must\n   reach the Opened state.\n   Exactly one XNS IDP packet is\
    \ encapsulated in the Information field\n   of a PPP Data Link Layer frame where\
    \ the Protocol field indicates\n   type hex 0025 (XNS IDP datagram).\n   The maximum\
    \ length of a XNS IDP datagram transmitted over a PPP link\n   is the same as\
    \ the maximum length of the Information field of a PPP\n   data link layer frame.\
    \  Since there is no standard method for\n   fragmenting and reassembling XNS\
    \ IDP datagrams, PPP links supporting\n   XNS IDP MUST allow at least 576 octets\
    \ in the information field of a\n   data link layer frame.\n   The format of the\
    \ Information field itself is the same as that\n   defined in [2].\n"
