  - "1. Overall Applicability\n   The SIP extensions specified in this document make\
    \ certain\n   assumptions regarding network topology, linkage between SIP and\
    \ lower\n   layers, and the availability of transitive trust.  These assumptions\n\
    \   are generally NOT APPLICABLE in the Internet as a whole.  The\n   mechanisms\
    \ specified here were designed to satisfy the requirements\n   specified in the\
    \ 3GPP Release 5 requirements on SIP [4] for which\n   either no general-purpose\
    \ solution was planned, where insufficient\n   operational experience was available\
    \ to understand if a general\n   solution is needed, or where a more general solution\
    \ is not yet\n   mature.  For more details about the assumptions made about these\n\
    \   extensions, consult the Applicability subsection for each extension.\n"

- title: 3. Overview
  contents:
  - "3. Overview\n   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected\
    \ SIP as\n   the protocol used to establish and tear down multimedia sessions\
    \ in\n   the context of its IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).  (For more\n   information\
    \ on the IMS, a detailed description can be found in 3GPP\n   TS 23.228 [14] and\
    \ 3GPP TS 24.229 [15]).  3GPP notified the IETF SIP\n   and SIPPING working groups\
    \ that existing SIP documents provided\n   almost all the functionality needed\
    \ to satisfy the requirements of\n   the IMS, but that they required some additional\
    \ functionality in\n   order to use SIP for this purpose.  These requirements\
    \ [4] are\n   documented in an Internet Draft which was submitted to the SIPPING\n\
    \   Working Group.  Some of these requirements are satisfied by chartered\n  \
    \ extensions, while other requirements were applicable to SIP, but not\n   sufficiently\
    \ general for the SIP Working Group to adopt.  This\n   document describes private\
    \ extensions to address those requirements.\n   Each extension, or set of related\
    \ extensions is described in its own\n   section below.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1 The P-Associated-URI header\n   This extension allows a registrar to return\
    \ a set of associated URIs\n   for a registered address-of-record.  We define\
    \ the P-Associated-URI\n   header field, used in the 200 OK response to a REGISTER\
    \ request.  The\n   P-Associated-URI header field transports the set of Associated\
    \ URIs\n   to the registered address-of-record.\n   An associated URI is a URI\
    \ that the service provider has allocated to\n   a user for his own usage.  A\
    \ registrar contains information that\n   allows an address-of-record URI to be\
    \ associated with zero or more\n   URIs.  Usually, all these URIs (the address-of-record\
    \ URI and the\n   associated URIs) are allocated for the usage of a particular\
    \ user.\n   This extension to SIP allows the UAC to know, upon a successful\n\
    \   authenticated registration, which other URIs, if any, the service\n   provider\
    \ has associated to an address-of-record URI.\n   Note that, generally speaking,\
    \ the registrar does not register the\n   associated URIs on behalf of the user.\
    \  Only the address-of-record\n   which is present in the To header field of the\
    \ REGISTER is registered\n   and bound to the contact address.  The only information\
    \ conveyed is\n   that the registrar is aware of other URIs to be used by the\
    \ same\n   user.\n   It may be possible, however, that an application server (or\
    \ even the\n   registrar itself) registers any of the associated URIs on behalf\
    \ of\n   the user by means of a third party registration.  However, this third\n\
    \   party registration is out of the scope of this document.  A UAC MUST\n   NOT\
    \ assume that the associated URIs are registered.\n   If a UAC wants to check\
    \ whether any of the associated URIs is\n   registered, it can do so by mechanisms\
    \ specified outside this\n   document, e.g., the UA may send a REGISTER request\
    \ with the To header\n   field value set to any of the associated URIs and without\
    \ a Contact\n   header.  The 200 OK response will include a Contact header with\
    \ the\n   list of registered contact addresses.  If the associated URI is not\n\
    \   registered, the UA MAY register it prior to its utilization.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.1 Applicability statement for the P-Associated-URI header\n   The P-Associated-URI\
    \ header is applicable in SIP networks where the\n   SIP provider is allocating\
    \ the set of identities that a user can\n   claim (in headers like the From field)\
    \ in requests that the UA\n   generates.  It furthermore assumes that the provider\
    \ knows the entire\n   set of identities that a user can legitimately claim, and\
    \ that the\n   user is willing to restrict its claimed identities to that set.\
    \  This\n   is in contrast to normal SIP usage, where the From field is\n   explicitly\
    \ an end-user specified field.\n"
- title: 4.1.2 Usage of the P-Associated-URI header
  contents:
  - "4.1.2 Usage of the P-Associated-URI header\n   The registrar inserts the P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field into the 200\n   OK response to a REGISTER request.  The header\
    \ field value is\n   populated with a list containing zero or more URIs that are\n\
    \   associated to the address-of-record.\n   If the registrar supports the P-Associated-URI\
    \ header extension, then\n   the registrar MUST always insert the P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field in\n   all the 200 OK responses to a REGISTER request, regardless\
    \ of whether\n   the REGISTER was an initial registration, re-registration, or\n\
    \   de-registration and regardless of whether there are zero or more\n   associated\
    \ URIs.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.2.1 Procedures at the UA\n   A UAC may receive a P-Associated-URI header\
    \ field in the 200 OK\n   response for a REGISTER.  The presence of the header\
    \ field in the 200\n   OK response for a REGISTER request implies that the extension\
    \ is\n   supported at the registrar.\n   The header value contains a list of zero\
    \ or more associated URIs to\n   the address-of-record URI.  The UAC MAY use any\
    \ of the associated\n   URIs to populate the From header value, or any other SIP\
    \ header value\n   that provides information of the identity of the calling party,\
    \ in a\n   subsequent request.\n   The UAC MAY check whether the associated URI\
    \ is registered or not.\n   This check can be done, e.g., by populating the To\
    \ header value in a\n   REGISTER sent to the registrar and without a Contact header.\
    \  The 200\n   OK response will include a Contact header with the list of registered\n\
    \   contact addresses.  As described in SIP [1], the 200 OK response may\n   contain\
    \ a Contact header field with zero or more values (zero meaning\n   the address-of-record\
    \ is not registered).\n"

    \ a REGISTER request, may\n   associate zero or more URIs with the address-of-record.\n\
    \   A registrar that supports this specification MUST include a\n   P-Associated-URI\
    \ header field in the 200 OK response to a REGISTER\n   request.  The header MUST\
    \ be populated with a comma-separated list of\n   SIP or SIPS URIs which are associated\
    \ to the address-of-record under\n   registration.\n   In case the address-of-record\
    \ under registration does not have any\n   other SIP or SIPS URIs associated,\
    \ the registrar MUST include an\n   empty P-Associated-URI header value.\n"

- title: 4.2 The P-Called-Party-ID header
  contents:
  - "4.2 The P-Called-Party-ID header\n   A proxy server inserts a P-Called-Party-ID\
    \ header, typically in an\n   INVITE request, en-route to its destination.  The\
    \ header is populated\n   with the Request-URI received by the proxy in the request.\
    \  The UAS\n   identifies which address-of-record, out of several registered\n\
    \   address-of-records, the invitation was sent to (for example, the user\n  \
    \ may be simultaneously using a personal and a business SIP URIs to\n   receive\
    \ invitation to sessions).  The UAS may use the information to\n   render different\
    \ distinctive audiovisual alerting tones, depending on\n   the URI used to receive\
    \ the invitation to the session.\n   Users in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem\
    \ (IMS) may get one or\n   several SIP URIs (address-of-record) to identify the\
    \ user.  For\n   instance, a user may get a business SIP URI and a personal one.\
    \  As\n   an example of utilization, the user may make available the business\n\
    \   SIP URI to co-workers and may make available the personal SIP URI to\n   members\
    \ of the family.\n   At a certain point in time, both the business SIP URI and\
    \ the\n   personal SIP URI are registered in the SIP registrar, so both URIs\n\
    \   can receive invitations to new sessions.  When the user receives an\n   invitation\
    \ to join a session, he/she should be aware of which of the\n   several registered\
    \ SIP URIs this session was sent to.\n   This requirement is stated in the 3GPP\
    \ Release 5 requirements on SIP\n   [4].\n   The problem arises during the terminating\
    \ side of a session\n   establishment, when the SIP proxy that is serving a UA\
    \ gets an\n   INVITE, and the SIP server retargets the SIP URI which is present\
    \ in\n   the Request-URI field, and replaces it by the SIP URI published by\n\
    \   the user in the Contact header field of the REGISTER request at\n   registration\
    \ time.  When the UAS receives the SIP INVITE, it cannot\n   determine which address-of-record\
    \ the request was sent to.\n   One can argue that the To header field conveys\
    \ the semantics of the\n   called user, and therefore, this extension to SIP is\
    \ not needed.\n   Although the To header field in SIP may convey the called party\
    \ ID in\n   most situations, there are two particular cases when the above\n \
    \  assumption is not correct:\n   1. The session has been forwarded, redirected,\
    \ etc., by previous SIP\n      proxies, before arriving to the proxy which is\
    \ serving the called\n      user.\n   2. The UAC builds an INVITE request and\
    \ the To header field is not\n      the same as the Request-URI.\n   The problem\
    \ of using the To header field is that this field is\n   populated by the UAC\
    \ and not modified by proxies in the path.  If the\n   UAC, for any reason, did\
    \ not populate the To header field with the\n   address-of-record of the destination\
    \ user, then the destination user\n   is not able to distinguish which address-of-record\
    \ the session was\n   destined.\n   Another possible solution to the problem is\
    \ built upon the\n   differentiation of the Contact header value between different\n\
    \   address-of-record at registration time.  The UA can differentiate\n   each\
    \ address-of-record it registers by assigning a different Contact\n   header value.\
    \  For instance, when the UA registers the address-of-\n   record sip:id1, the\
    \ Contact header value can be sip:id1@ua; the\n   registration of sip:id2 can\
    \ be bound to the Contact value sip:id2@ua.\n   The solution described above assumes\
    \ that the UA explicitly registers\n   each of its address-of-record URIs, and\
    \ therefore, it has full\n   control over the contact address values assigned\
    \ to each\n   registration.  However, in the case the UA does not have full control\n\
    \   of its registered address-of-record, because of, e.g., a third party\n   registration,\
    \ the solution does not work.  This may be the case of\n   the 3GPP registration,\
    \ where the UA may have previously indicated the\n   network, by means outside\
    \ of SIP, that some other address-of-record\n   URIs may be automatically registered\
    \ when the UA registers a\n   particular address-of-record.  The requirement is\
    \ covered in the 3GPP\n   Release 5 requirements on SIP [4].\n   In the next paragraphs\
    \ we show an example of the problem, in the case\n   there has been some sort\
    \ of call forwarding in the session, so that\n   the UAC is not aware of the intended\
    \ destination URI in the current\n   INVITE.\n   We assume that a User Agent (UA)\
    \ is registering to his proxy (P1).\n         Scenario                      UA\

    \ token that is\n   known by both the registrar or the home proxy at the home\
    \ network and\n   the proxies in the visited network.\n   Typically, the home\
    \ network authorizes the UA to roam to a particular\n   visited network.  This\
    \ action requires an existing roaming agreement\n   between the home and the visited\
    \ network.\n   While it is possible for a home network to identify one or more\n\
    \   visited networks by inspecting the domain name in the Via header\n   fields,\
    \ this approach has a heavy dependency on DNS.  It is an option\n   for a proxy\
    \ to populate the via header with an IP address, for\n   example, and in the absence\
    \ of a reverse DNS entry, the IP address\n   will not convey the desired information.\n\
    \   Any SIP proxy that receives any of the requests indicated in Table 1\n   (Section\
    \ 5.7) MAY insert a P-Visited-Network-ID header when it\n   forwards the request.\
    \  In case a REGISTER or other request is\n   traversing different administrative\
    \ domains (e.g., different visited\n   networks), a SIP proxy MAY insert a new\
    \ P-Visited-Network-ID header\n   if the request does not contain a P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header with\n   the same network identifier as its own network identifier (e.g.,\
    \ if\n   the request has traversed other different administrative domains).\n\
    \   Note also that, there is not requirement for the header value to be\n   readable\
    \ in the proxies.  Therefore, a first proxy may insert an\n   encrypted header\
    \ that only the registrar can decrypt.  If the request\n   traverses a second\
    \ proxy located in the same administrative domain as\n   the first proxy, the\
    \ second proxy may not be able to read the\n   contents of the P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ header.  In this situation, the\n   second proxy will consider that its visited\
    \ network identifier is not\n   already present in the value of the header, and\
    \ therefore, it will\n   insert a new P-Visited-Network-ID header value (hopefully\
    \ with the\n   same identifier that the first proxy inserted, although perhaps,\
    \ not\n   encrypted).  When the request arrives at the registrar or proxy in\n\
    \   the home network, it will notice that the header value is repeated\n   (both\
    \ the first and the second proxy inserted it).  The decrypted\n   values should\
    \ be the same, because both proxies where part of the\n   same administrative\
    \ domain.  While this situation is not desirable,\n   it does not create any harm\
    \ at the registrar or proxy in the home\n   network.\n   The P-Visited-Network-ID\
    \ is normally used at registration.  However,\n   this extension does not preclude\
    \ other usages.  For instance, a proxy\n   located in a visited network that does\
    \ not maintain registration\n   state may insert a P-Visited-Network-ID header\
    \ into any standalone\n   request outside a dialog or a request that creates a\
    \ dialog.  At the\n   time of writing this document, the only requests that create\
    \ dialogs\n   are INVITE [1], SUBSCRIBE [6] and REFER [11].\n   In order to avoid\
    \ conflicts with identifiers, especially when the\n   number of roaming agreements\
    \ between networks increase, care must be\n   taken when selecting the value of\
    \ the P-Visited-Network-ID.  The\n   identifier should be a globally unique to\
    \ avoid duplications.\n   Although there are many mechanism to create globally\
    \ unique\n   identifiers across networks, one of such as mechanisms is already\
    \ in\n   operation, and that is DNS.  The P-Visited-Network-ID does not have\n\
    \   any connection to DNS, but the values in the header can be chosen\n   from\
    \ the own DNS entry representing the domain name of the network.\n   This guarantees\

    \ 2/layer 3\n   connectivity through different access technologies.  SIP User\
    \ Agents\n   may use this header to relay information about the access technology\n\
    \   to proxies that are providing services.  The serving proxy may then\n   use\
    \ this information to optimize services for the UA.  For example, a\n   3GPP UA\
    \ may use this header to pass information about the access\n   network such as\
    \ radio access technology and radio cell identity to\n   its home service provider.\n\
    \   For the purpose of this extension, we define an access network as the\n  \
    \ network providing the layer 2/layer 3 IP connectivity which in turn\n   provides\
    \ a user with access to the SIP capabilities and services\n   provided.\n   In\
    \ some cases, the SIP server that provides the user with services\n   may wish\
    \ to know information about the type of access network that\n   the UA is currently\
    \ using.  Some services are more suitable or less\n   suitable depending on the\
    \ access type, and some services are of more\n   value to subscribers if the access\
    \ network details are known by the\n   SIP proxy which provides the user with\
    \ services.\n   In other cases, the SIP server that provides the user with services\n\
    \   may simply wish to know crude location information in order to\n   provide\
    \ certain services to the user.  For example, many of the\n   location based services\
    \ available in wireless networks today require\n   the home network to know the\
    \ identity of the cell the user is being\n   served by.\n   Some regulatory requirements\
    \ exist mandating that for cellular radio\n   systems, the identity of the cell\
    \ where an emergency call is\n   established is made available to the emergency\
    \ authorities.\n   The SIP server that provides services to the user may desire\n\
    \   knowledge about the access network.  This is achieved by defining a\n   new\
    \ private SIP extension header, P-Access-Network-Info.  This header\n   carries\
    \ information relating to the access network between the UAC\n   and its serving\

    \ is not for general SIP usage.\n   The information revealed in the P-Access-Network-Info\

    \   depends on the existence of specific business and security\n   relationships\

  - "4.4.2.2 Proxy behavior\n   A proxy MUST NOT insert or modify the value of the\n\
    \   P-Access-Network-Info header.\n   A proxy which is providing services to the\
    \ UA, may act upon any\n   information present in the P-Access-Network-Info header\
    \ value, if is\n   present, to provide a different service depending on the network\
    \ or\n   the location through which the UA is accessing the server.  For\n   example,\
    \ for cellular radio access networks the SIP proxy located in\n   the home network\
    \ may use the cell ID to provide basic localized\n   services.\n   A proxy that\
    \ provides services to the user, the proxy typically\n   located in the home network,\
    \ and therefore trusted, MUST delete the\n   header when the SIP signaling is\
    \ forwarded to a SIP server located in\n   a non-trusted administrative network\

  contents:
  - "4.5 The P-Charging-Function-Addresses header\n   3GPP has defined a distributed\
    \ architecture that results in multiple\n   network entities becoming involved\
    \ in providing access and services.\n   There is a need to inform each SIP proxy\
    \ involved in a transaction\n   about the common charging functional entities\
    \ to receive the\n   generated charging records or charging events.\n   The solution\
    \ provided by 3GPP is to define two types of charging\n   functional entities:\
    \ Charging Collection Function (CCF) and Event\n   Charging Function (ECF).  CCF\
    \ is used for off-line charging (e.g.,\n   for postpaid account charging).  ECF\
    \ is used for on-line charging\n   (e.g., for pre-paid account charging).  There\
    \ may be more than a\n   single instance of CCF and ECF in a network, in order\
    \ to provide\n   redundancy in the network.  In case there are more than a single\n\
    \   instance of either the CCF or the ECF addresses, implementations\n   SHOULD\
    \ attempt sending the charging data to the ECF or CCF address,\n   starting with\
    \ the first address of the sequence (if any) in the\n   P-Charging-Function-Addresses\
    \ header.  The CCF and ECF addresses may\n   be passed during the establishment\
    \ of a dialog or in a standalone\n   transaction.  More detailed information about\
    \ charging can be found\n   in 3GPP TS 32.200 [16] and 3GPP TS 32.225 [17].\n\
    \   We define the SIP private header P-Charging-Function-Addresses.  A\n   proxy\
    \ MAY include this header, if not already present, in either the\n   initial request\
    \ or response for a dialog, or in the request and\n   response of a standalone\
    \ transaction outside a dialog.  Only one\n   instance of the header MUST be present\
    \ in a particular request or\n   response.\n   The mechanisms by which a SIP proxy\
    \ collects the values to populate\n   the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header\
    \ values are outside the scope\n   of this document.  However, as an example,\
    \ a SIP proxy may have\n   preconfigured these addresses, or may obtain them from\

    \ for the access\n   and services as they see fit.  This requires coordination\
    \ among the\n   network entities (e.g., SIP proxies), which includes correlating\n\
    \   charging records generated from different entities that are related\n   to\
    \ the same session.\n   The correlation information includes, but it is not limited\
    \ to, a\n   globally unique charging identifier that makes easy the billing\n\
    \   effort.\n   A charging vector is defined as a collection of charging information.\n\
    \   The charging vector may be filled in during the establishment of a\n   dialog\
    \ or standalone transaction outside a dialog.  The information\n   inside the\
    \ charging vector may be filled in by multiple network\n   entities (including\
    \ SIP proxies) and retrieved by multiple network\n   entities.  There are three\
    \ types of correlation information to be\n   transferred: the IMS Charging Identity\
    \ (ICID) value, the address of\n   the SIP proxy that creates the ICID value,\
    \ and the Inter Operator\n   Identifiers (IOI).\n   ICID is a charging value that\

    \ networks\n   involved in a SIP dialog or transaction outside a dialog.  There\
    \ may\n   an IOI generated from each side of the dialog to identify the network\n\

- title: 6.1 P-Associated-URI
  contents:
  - "6.1 P-Associated-URI\n   The information returned in the P-Associated-URI header\
    \ is not viewed\n   as particularly sensitive.  Rather, it is simply informational\
    \ in\n   nature, providing openness to the UAC with regard to the automatic\n\
    \   association performed by the registrar.  If end-to-end protection is\n   not\
    \ used at the SIP layer, it is possible for proxies between the\n   registrar\
    \ and the UA to modify the contents of the header value.\n   This attack, while\
    \ potentially annoying, should not have significant\n   impacts.\n   The lack\
    \ of encryption, either end-to-end or hop-by-hop, may lead to\n   leak some privacy\
    \ regarding the list of authorized identities.  For\n   instance, a user who registers\
    \ an address-of-record of\n   sip:user1@example.com may get another SIP URI associated\
    \ as\n   sip:first.last@example.com returned in the P-Associated-URI header\n\
    \   value.  An eavesdropper could collect this information.  If the user\n   does\
    \ not want to disclose the associated URIs, the eavesdropper could\n   have gain\
    \ access to private URIs.  Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that\n   this extension\
    \ is used in a secured environment, where encryption of\n   SIP messages is provided\
    \ either end-to-end or hop-by-hop.\n"
- title: 6.2 P-Called-Party-ID
  contents:
  - "6.2 P-Called-Party-ID\n   Due to the nature of the P-Called-Party-ID header,\
    \ this header does\n   not introduce any significant security concern.  It is\
    \ possible for\n   an attacker to modify the contents of the header.  However,\
    \ this\n   modification will not cause any harm to the session establishment.\n\
    \   An eavesdropper may collect the list of identities a user is\n   registered.\
    \  This may have privacy implications.  To mitigate this\n   problem, this extension\
    \ SHOULD only be used in a secured environment,\n   where encryption of SIP messages\
    \ is provided either end-to-end or\n   hop-by-hop.\n"
- title: 6.3 P-Visited-Network-ID
  contents:
  - "6.3 P-Visited-Network-ID\n   The P-Visited-Network-ID header assumes that there\
    \ is trust\n   relationship between a home network and one or more transited visited\n\
    \   networks.  It is possible for other proxies between the proxy in the\n   visited\
    \ network that inserts the header, and the registrar or the\n   home proxy, to\
    \ modify the value of P-Visited-Network-ID header.\n   Therefore intermediaries\
    \ participating in this mechanism MUST apply a\n   hop-by-hop integrity protection\
    \ mechanism such us IPsec or other\n   available mechanisms in order to prevent\
    \ such attacks.\n"
- title: 6.4 P-Access-Network-Info
  contents:
  - "6.4 P-Access-Network-Info\n   A Trust Domain is formally defined in the Short\
    \ term requirements for\n   Network Asserted Identity [13] document.  For the\
    \ purpose of this\n   document, we refer to the 3GPP trust domain as the collection\
    \ of SIP\n   proxies and application servers that are operated by a 3GPP network\n\
    \   operator and are compliant with the requirements expressed in 3GPP TS\n  \
    \ 24.229 [15].\n   This extension assumes that the access network is trusted by\
    \ the UA\n   (because the UA's home network has a trust relationship with the\n\
    \   access network), as described earlier in this document.\n   This extension\
    \ assumes that the information added to the header by\n   the UAC should be sent\
    \ only to trusted entities and should not be\n   used outside of the trusted administrative\
    \ network domain.\n   The SIP proxy that provides services to the user, utilizes\
    \ the\n   information contained in this header to provide additional services\n\
    \   and UAs are expected to provide correct information.  However, there\n   are\
    \ no security problems resulting from a UA inserting incorrect\n   information.\
    \  Networks providing services based on the information\n   carried in the P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header will therefore need to\n   trust the UA sending the information.  A rogue\
    \ UA sending false\n   access network information will do no more harm than to\
    \ restrict the\n   user from using certain services.\n   The mechanism provided\
    \ in this document is designed primarily for\n   private systems like 3GPP.  Most\
    \ security requirements are met by way\n   of private standardized solutions.\n\
    \   For instance, 3GPP will use the P-Access-Network-Info header to carry\n  \
    \ relatively sensitive information like the cell ID.  Therefore the\n   information\
    \ MUST NOT be sent outside of the 3GPP domain.\n   The UA is aware - if it is\
    \ a 3GPP UA - that it is operating within a\n   trusted domain.\n   The 3GPP UA\
    \ is aware of whether or not a secure association to the\n   home network domain\
    \ for transporting SIP signaling, is currently\n   available, and as such the\
    \ sensitive information carried in the\n   P-Access-Network-Info header SHOULD\
    \ NOT be sent in any initial\n   unauthenticated and unprotected requests (e.g.,\
    \ REGISTER).\n   Any UA that is using this extension and is not part of a private\n\
    \   trusted domain should not consider the mechanism as secure and as\n   such\
    \ SHOULD NOT send sensitive information in the\n   P-Access-Network-Info header.\n\
    \   Any proxy that is operating in a private trust domain where the\n   P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header is supported is required to delete the\n   header, if it is present,\
    \ from any message prior to forwarding it\n   outside of the trusted domain.\n\
    \   Therefore, a network that requires its UA to send information in the\n   P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header must ensure that either that information\n   is not of a sensitive nature\
    \ or that the information is not sent\n   outside of the trust domain.\n   A proxy\
    \ receiving a message containing the P-Access-Network-Info\n   header from a non-trusted\
    \ entity is not able to guarantee the\n   validity of the contents.\n"
- title: 6.5 P-Charging-Function-Addresses
  contents:
  - "6.5 P-Charging-Function-Addresses\n   It is expected as normal behavior that\
    \ proxies within a closed\n   network will modify the values of the P-Charging-Function-Addresses\n\
    \   and insert it into a SIP request or response.  However, these proxies\n  \
    \ that share this information MUST have a trust relationship.\n   If an untrusted\
    \ entity were inserted between trusted entities, it\n   could potentially substitute\
    \ a different charging function address.\n   Therefore, an integrity protection\
    \ mechanism such as IPsec or other\n   available mechanisms MUST be applied in\
    \ order to prevent such\n   attacks.  Since each trusted proxy may need to view\
    \ or modify the\n   values in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header, the protection\n\
