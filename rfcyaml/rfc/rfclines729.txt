TELNET Byte Macro Option 1.
The sender of this  command REQUESTS or AGREES  to use the  BM option, and will send sing1e  data characters which are to  be interpreted as if longer data strings had been sent.
The  sender  of  this  option
REFUSES  to  send  single  data characters which  are  to be
interpreted  as if  longer  data strings had been sent.
The sender REQUESTS or AGREES to have the other side (send  of WILL BM) issue  send single  data characters which  are to  be interpreted as if longer data strings had been sent.
The sender REFUSES to allow the other side to send single data characters which  are  to be
interpreted  as if  longer  data strings had been sent.
: <count> is a  one byte binary number,  indicating how  many <expansion string> characters follow, up to the ending  IAC SE, but not including it.

will  be  sent  instead  of  the indicated <expansion string
The receiver of the <macro byte> (the sender  of the  DO BM)  is to  behave EXACTLY
as if  the <expansion string> of bytes had instead been received from the network.
This  interpretation is  to  occur before  any  other Telnet interpretations, unless the <macro byte> occurs as part of a BM subcommand; in this case no special interpretation  is to be made.
Note that the effect of a particular <macro byte> may be negated by reseting it to "expand" into itself.
The receiver  of the  <DEFINE> for  <macro byte
accepts  the requested definition and will perform the indicating expansion whenever a <macro byte
>  is received and is  not part of a  BM subcommand.
IAC SB BM <REFUSE> <macro byte>
The receive  of  the  <DEFINE> for  <macro  byte
either because the particular <macro  byte
> is not  an acceptable  choice  or because  the length  of  the <expansion string> exceeds available storage.
<REASON> may be <BAD CHOICE> which is decimal 01; or IAC SB BM <LITERAL>
The <macro byte> is to be treated as real data, rather than as representative of the <expansion string
> <LITERAL> is decimal 03.
No reinterpretation of data is allowed.
Motivation for the option: Subcommands for Telnet options currently require a minimum of  five characters to be sent over the network (i.e., IAC SB <Option  name> IAC SE).
For sub commands  which  are employed  infrequently,  in absolute numbers and in relation  to normal data, this overhead  is tolerable.
In other cases,  however, it is  not.
For example,  data which is  sent  in  a  block oriented fashion
may  need  a  "block separator" mark.
If  blocks are commonly  as small as  five or  ten bytes, then most of the cross net data will be control information.
The BM option is intended  as a simple data compression  technique, to remove this overhead from the communication channel.
The  option  is   enabled  through  the   standard  Telnet   Option negotiation process.
Afterwards, the SENDER of data (the side which sends the IAC WILL BM) is  free to define and use mappings  between single and multiple NOT characters.
Except for the ability to offer a blanket refusal,  the receiver of  data has no  control over  the definition and use of mappings.
The sender (of the WILL BM) is prohibited from using or  redefining a <macro byte> until  it has received an  <ACCEPT> or <REFUSE>,  in reply to a <DEFINE
The  Telnet command  character  IAC (decimal  255) may  be  a member of an <expansion string
but is the ONLY character which may With  the  exception  of  IAC,  data  transfered  as  part  of
BM subcommands are NOT to be interpreted.
They are to be taken only as their  normal  character  values.
This  avoids  the  problem   of distinguishing between a character which is to be taken as a <macro byte
>, and interpreted as its corresponding <expansion string>,
and that same character to be taken  as its usual Telnet NVT value.
In all other  cases,  however, <macro  byte
be  interpreted immediately, as if  the <expansion string>  had actually been  sent across  the  network.
are   not  subject   to reinterpretation, so that recursive definitions cannot be made.
The <count>  in  the <DEFINE>
subcommand  allows the  receiver  to allocate storage.
IAC interpretation  is not over ridden during  BM subcommands
that  IAC  SE will  continue  to  safely  terminate malformed subcommands.
To include  IAC as part  of a <DEFINE>,  the string "IAC IAC" must be sent.
The BM option is notably inefficient with regard to problems during <macro byte> definition and use of  <macro byte>s as real data.
It is expected that relatively few  <macro byte>s will be defined  and that they will represent relatively short strings.
Since the Telnet data space  between decimal  128 and  decimal 254  is not  normally
