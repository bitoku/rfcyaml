  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic\n\
    \   from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space.  Now that\n   there\
    \ are no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more\n   complicated,\
    \ fragile, and expensive.  Network administrators are\n   advised to remove filters\
    \ based on the registration status of the\n   address space.\n   This document\
    \ explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix\n   filters for unallocated\
    \ IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border\n   routers and documents those IPv4\
    \ unicast prefixes that should not be\n   routed across the public Internet.\n"

- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n   Martians [RFC1208] is a humorous term applied\
    \ to packets that turn up\n   unexpectedly on the wrong network because of bogus\
    \ routing entries.\n   It is also used as a name for a packet that has an altogether\
    \ bogus\n   (non-registered or ill-formed) Internet address.  Bogons [RFC3871]\n\
    \   are packets sourced from addresses that have not yet been allocated\n   by\
    \ IANA or the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), or addresses\n   reserved for\
    \ private or special use by RFCs [RFC5735].  Bogons are\n   referred to as \"\
    Dark IP\" in some circles.\n"

- title: 3.1.  No Longer Filtering Based on Address Registration Status
  contents:
  - "3.1.  No Longer Filtering Based on Address Registration Status\n   Network administrators\
    \ who implemented filters for unallocated IPv4\n   /8s did so in the knowledge\
    \ that those /8s were not a legitimate\n   source of traffic on the Internet and\
    \ that there was a small number\n   of bogon filters to implement.  Now that there\
    \ are no longer any\n   unallocated unicast IPv4 /8s, there will be legitimate\
    \ Internet\n   traffic coming from all unicast /8s that are not reserved for special\n\
    \   purposes in an RFC.\n   Removing packet and prefix filters based on the registration\
    \ status\n   of the IPv4 address is a simple approach that will avoid blocking\n\
    \   legitimate Internet traffic.  Network operators SHOULD remove both\n   ingress\
    \ and egress packet filters as well as BGP prefix filters for\n   previously unallocated\
    \ IPv4 /8s.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Continuing to Filter Traffic from Unallocated IPv4 Space
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Continuing to Filter Traffic from Unallocated IPv4 Space\n   Some network\
    \ administrators might want to continue filtering\n   unallocated IPv4 addresses\
    \ managed by the RIRs.  This requires\n   significantly more granular ingress\
    \ filters and the highly dynamic\n   nature of the RIRs' address pools means that\
    \ filters need to be\n   updated on a daily basis to avoid blocking legitimate\
    \ incoming\n   traffic.\n"
- title: 4.  Prefixes That Should Not be Routed across the Internet
  contents:
  - "4.  Prefixes That Should Not be Routed across the Internet\n   Network operators\
    \ may deploy filters that block traffic destined for\n   Martian prefixes.  Currently,\
    \ the Martian prefix table is defined by\n   [RFC5735] which reserves each Martian\
    \ prefix for some specific,\n   special use.  If the Martian prefix table ever\
    \ changes, that change\n   will be documented in an RFC that either updates or\
    \ obsoletes\n   [RFC5735].\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The cessation of filters based on unallocated\
    \ IPv4 /8 allocations is\n   an evolutionary step towards reasonable security\
    \ filters.  While\n   these filters are no longer necessary, and in fact harmful,\
    \ this does\n   not obviate the need to continue other security solutions.  These\n\
    \   other solutions are as necessary today as they ever were.\n"
