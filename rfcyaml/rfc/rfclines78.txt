NCP Checkout UCSB an RAND recently conducted UCSB console to/from RAND console validation
The exercise was simply to verify that the NCPs behaved according to Document #1 protocol.
What was Learned The UCSB and RAND NCPs responded as specified in Document #1.
RAND uncovered a few minor problems with their Network Services Program (NSP) that interfaces video graphics consoles to the NCP.
The nature of these problems were data format conversions and human factors aspects of display presentation of status information.
Both UCSB and RAND will be happy to participate with other sites in verifying their NCPs.
We intend to conduct additional exercises involving data re  configurations and file transmissions.
