- title: 1.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1.  Applicability Statement\n   This document provides information about a deployed\
    \ use of the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] for the Internet\n\
    \   community.  It is not currently an IETF standards track proposal.\n   The\
    \ mechanisms in this document use SIP as a name resolution and\n   authentication\
    \ mechanism to initiate an Internet Key Exchange\n   Protocol (IKE) [RFC5996]\
    \ session.  The purpose of this document is to\n   establish an on-demand virtual\
    \ private network (VPN) to a home router\n   that does not have a fixed IP address\
    \ using self-signed certificates.\n   It is only applicable under the condition\
    \ that the integrity of the\n   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is\
    \ assured.  The method\n   to ensure this integrity of SDP is outside the scope\
    \ of this\n   document.  This document specifies the process in which a pair of\
    \ SIP\n   user agents resolve each other's names, exchange the fingerprints of\n\
    \   their self-signed certificates securely, and agree to establish an\n   IPsec-based\
    \ VPN [RFC4301].  However, this document does not make any\n   modifications to\
    \ the specifications of IPsec/IKE.  Despite the\n   limitations of the conditions\
    \ under which this document can be\n   applied, there are sufficient use cases\
    \ in which this specification\n   is helpful, such as the following:\n   o  Sharing\
    \ media using a framework developed by Digital Living\n      Network Alliance\
    \ (DLNA) or similar protocols over VPN between two\n      user devices.\n   o\
    \  Accessing remote desktop applications over VPN initiated by SIP\n      call.\
    \  As an additional function of click-to-call, a customer\n      service agent\
    \ can access a customer's PC remotely to troubleshoot\n      the problem while\
    \ talking with the customer over the phone.\n   o  Accessing and controlling medical\
    \ equipment (medical robotics)\n      remotely to monitor the elderly in a rural\
    \ area (remote care\n      services).\n   o  Using a LAN-based gaming protocol\
    \ based on peer-to-peer rather\n      than via a gaming server.\n"

    \ and\n   provides an overview of the proposed solution.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Problem Statement\n   Home servers and network-capable consumer electronic\
    \ devices have\n   been widely deployed.  People using such devices are willing\
    \ to share\n   content and applications and are therefore seeking ways to establish\n\
    \   multiple communication channels with each other.  However, there are\n   several\
    \ obstacles to be overcome in the case of remote home access.\n   It is often\
    \ not possible for a device outside the home network to\n   connect to another\
    \ device inside the home network because the home\n   device is behind a network\
    \ address translation (NAT) or firewall that\n   allows outgoing connections but\
    \ blocks incoming connections.  One\n   effective solution for this problem is\
    \ VPN remote access to the NAT\n   device, which is usually a home router.  With\
    \ this approach, once the\n   external device joins the home network securely,\
    \ establishing\n   connections with all the devices inside the home will become\
    \ easy\n   because popular LAN-based communication methods such as DLNA can be\n\
    \   used transparently.  However, there are more difficult cases in which\n  \
    \ a home router itself is located behind the NAT.  In such cases, it is\n   also\
    \ necessary to consider NAT traversal of the remote access to the\n   home router.\
    \  In many cases, because the global IP address of the\n   home router is not\
    \ always fixed, it is necessary to make use of an\n   effective name resolution\
    \ mechanism.\n   In addition, there is the problem of how a remote client and\
    \ a home\n   router authenticate each other over IKE to establish IPsec for remote\n\
    \   access.  It is not always possible for the two devices to securely\n   exchange\
    \ a pre-shared key in advance.  Administrative costs can make\n   it impractical\
    \ to distribute authentication certificates signed by a\n   well-known root certification\
    \ authority (CA) to all the devices.  In\n   addition, it is inefficient to publish\
    \ a temporary certificate to a\n   device that does not have a fixed IP address\
    \ or hostname.  To resolve\n   these authentication issues, this document proposes\
    \ a mechanism that\n   enables the devices to authenticate each other using self-signed\n\
    \   certificates.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Approach to Solution
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Approach to Solution\n   This document proposes the use of SIP as a name\
    \ resolution and\n   authentication mechanism because of three main advantages:\n\
    \   o  Delegation of Authentication to Third Party\n      Devices can be free\
    \ from managing their signed certificates and\n      whitelists by taking advantage\
    \ of authentication and authorization\n      mechanisms supported by SIP.\n  \
    \ o  UDP Hole Punching for IKE/IPsec\n      SIP has a cross-NAT rendezvous mechanism,\
    \ and Interactive\n      Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] has a function\
    \ to open\n      ports through the NAT.  The combination of these effective\n\
    \      functions can be used for general applications as well as real-\n     \
    \ time media.  It is difficult to set up a session between devices\n      without\
    \ SIP if the devices are behind various types of NAT.\n   o  Reuse of Existing\
    \ SIP Infrastructure\n      SIP servers are widely distributed as a scalable infrastructure,\n\
    \      and it is quite practical to reuse them without any modifications.\n  \
    \ Today, SIP is applied to not only Voice over IP (VoIP) but also\n   various\
    \ applications and is recognized as a general protocol for\n   session initiation.\
    \  Therefore, it can also be used to initiate\n   IKE/IPsec sessions.\n   However,\
    \ there is also a specification that uses a self-signed\n   certificate for authentication\
    \ in the SIP/SDP framework.\n   \"Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the\
    \ Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP)\"\n   [RFC4572] (hereafter referred to as comedia-tls) specifies a method\n\
    \   to exchange the fingerprint of a self-signed certificate to establish\n  \
    \ a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] connection.  This\n   specification\
    \ defines a mechanism by which self-signed certificates\n   can be used securely,\
    \ provided that the integrity of the SDP\n   description is assured.  Because\
    \ a certificate itself is used for\n   authentication not only in TLS but also\
    \ in IKE, this mechanism will\n   be applied to the establishment of an IPsec\
    \ security association (SA)\n   by extending the protocol identifier of SDP so\
    \ that it can specify\n   IKE.\n   One easy method to protect the integrity of\
    \ the SDP description,\n   which is the premise of this specification, is to use\
    \ the SIP\n   identity [RFC4474] mechanism.  This approach is also referred to\
    \ in\n   [RFC5763].  Because the SIP identity mechanism can protect the\n   integrity\
    \ of a body part as well as the value of the From header in a\n   SIP request\
    \ by using a valid Identity header, the receiver of the\n   request can establish\
    \ secure IPsec connections with the sender by\n   confirming that the hash value\
    \ of the certificate sent during IKE\n   negotiation matches the fingerprint in\
    \ the SDP.  Although SIP\n   identity does not protect the identity of the receiver\
    \ of the SIP\n   request, SIP-connected identity [RFC4916] does.  Note that the\n\
    \   possible deficiencies discussed in [RFC4474-Concerns] could affect\n   this\
    \ specification if SIP identity is used for the security\n   mechanism.\n   Considering\
    \ the above background, this document defines new media\n   formats \"ike-esp\"\
    \ and \"ike-esp-udpencap\", which can be used when the\n   protocol identifier\
    \ is \"udp\", to enable the negotiation of using IKE\n   for media sessions over\
    \ SDP exchange on the condition that the\n   integrity of the SDP description\
    \ is assured.  It also specifies the\n   method to set up an IPsec SA by exchanging\
    \ fingerprints of self-\n   signed certificates based on comedia-tls, and it notes\
    \ the example of\n   SDP offer/answer [RFC3264] and the points that should be\
    \ taken care\n   of by implementation.  Because there is a chance that devices\
    \ are\n   behind NAT, this document also covers the method to combine IKE/IPsec\n\
    \   NAT-Traversal [RFC3947][RFC3948] with ICE.  In addition, it defines\n   the\
    \ attribute \"ike-setup\" for IKE media sessions, similar to the\n   \"setup\"\
    \ attribute for TCP-based media transport defined in RFC 4145\n   [RFC4145]. \
    \ This attribute is used to negotiate the role of each\n   endpoint in the IKE\
    \ session.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Alternative Solution under Prior Relationship between Two Nodes\n   Under\
    \ quite limited conditions, certificates signed by trusted third\n   parties or\
    \ pre-shared keys between endpoints could be used for\n   authentication in IKE,\
    \ using SIP servers only for name resolution and\n   authorization of session\
    \ initiation.  Such limited cases are\n   addressed in Section 8.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Authorization Model
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Authorization Model\n   In this document, SIP servers are used for authorization\
    \ of each SIP\n   call.  The actual media sessions of IPsec/IKE are not authorized\
    \ by\n   SIP servers but by the remote client and the home router based on the\n\
    \   information in SIP/SDP.  For example, the home router recognizes the\n   remote\
    \ client with its SIP-URI and IP address in the SDP.  If it\n   decides to accept\
    \ the remote client as a peer of a VPN session, it\n   will accept the following\
    \ IKE session.  Then, during the IKE\n   negotiation, the certificate fingerprint\
    \ in the SDP is compared with\n   the certificate exchanged in the IKE session.\
    \  If they match, IKE\n   negotiation continues.  Only a successful IKE negotiation\
    \ establishes\n   an IPsec session with the remote peer.\n"

  - "3.  Protocol Overview\n   Figure 1 shows a case of VPN remote access from a device\

    \ case,\n   the external device, a remote client, recognizes the Address of\n\
    \   Record of the home router but does not have any information about its\n  \
    \ contact address and certificate.  Generally, establishing an IPsec SA\n   dynamically\
    \ and securely in this situation is difficult.  However, as\n   specified in comedia-tls\
    \ [RFC4572], if the integrity of SDP session\n   descriptions is assured, it is\

    \   (1)  Both Remote Client and Home Router generate secure signaling\n      \
    \  channels.  They may REGISTER to SIP Proxy using TLS.\n   (2)  Remote Client\
    \ sends an offer SDP with an INVITE request to Home\n        Router, and Home\
    \ Router returns an answer SDP with a reliable\n        response (e.g., 200 OK).\
    \  Both exchange the fingerprints of\n        their self-signed certificates in\
    \ SDP during this transaction.\n        Remote Client does not accept an answer\
    \ SDP with an unreliable\n        response as the final response.\n   (3)  After\
    \ the SDP exchange, Remote Client, which has the active\n        role, initiates\
    \ IKE with Home Router, which has the passive\n        role, to establish an IPsec\
    \ SA.  Both validate that the\n        certificate presented in the IKE exchange\
    \ has a fingerprint that\n        matches the fingerprint from SDP.  If they match,\
    \ IKE\n        negotiation proceeds as normal.\n   (4)  Remote Client joins the\

    \ all\n   the negotiations related to key-exchange, such as those of encryption\n\
    \   and authentication algorithms.  These negotiations are up to IKE.  In\n  \
    \ many cases where IPsec is used for remote access, a remote client\n   needs\
    \ to dynamically obtain a private address inside the home network\n   while initiating\
    \ the remote access.  Therefore, the IPsec security\n   policy also needs to be\
    \ set dynamically at the same time.  However,\n   such a management function of\
    \ the security policy is the\n   responsibility of the high-level application.\
    \  SDP is not concerned\n   with it.  The roles of SDP here are to determine the\
    \ IP addresses of\n   both parties used for IKE connection with c-line in SDP\
    \ and to\n   exchange the fingerprints of the certificates used for authentication\n\
    \   in IKE with the fingerprint attribute in SDP.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Identifiers
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Identifiers\n   This document defines two SDP media formats for\
    \ the \"udp\" protocol\n   under the \"application\" media type: \"ike-esp\" and\
    \ \"ike-esp-udpencap\".\n   The format \"ike-esp\" indicates that the media described\
    \ is IKE for\n   the establishment of an IPsec security association as described\
    \ in\n   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303].  In contrast,\n\
    \   \"ike-esp-udpencap\" indicates that the media described is IKE, which\n  \
    \ is capable of NAT traversal for the establishment of UDP\n   encapsulation of\
    \ IPsec packets through NAT boxes as specified in\n   [RFC3947] and [RFC3948].\
    \  Even if the offerer and answerer exchange\n   \"ike-esp-udpencap\", IKE conforming\
    \ to [RFC3947] and [RFC3948] can end\n   up establishing a normal IPsec tunnel\
    \ when there is no need to use\n   UDP encapsulation of IPsec.  Both the offerer\
    \ and answerer can\n   negotiate IKE by specifying \"udp\" in the \"proto\" field\
    \ and \"ike-esp\"\n   or \"ike-esp-udpencap\" in the \"fmt\" field in SDP.\n \
    \  In addition, this document defines a new attribute \"ike-setup\", which\n \
    \  can be used when the protocol identifier is \"udp\" and the \"fmt\" field\n\
    \   is \"ike-esp\" or \"ike-esp-udpencap\", in order to describe how\n   endpoints\
    \ should perform the IKE session setup procedure.  The \"ike-\n   setup\" attribute\
    \ indicates which of the end points should initiate\n   the establishment of an\
    \ IKE session.  The \"ike-setup\" attribute is\n   charset-independent and can\
    \ be a session- or media-level attribute.\n   The following is the ABNF of the\
    \ \"ike-setup\" attribute.\n      ike-setup-attr = \"a=ike-setup:\" role\n   \
    \   role           = \"active\" / \"passive\" / \"actpass\"\n      'active': \
    \  The endpoint will initiate an outgoing session.\n      'passive':  The endpoint\
    \ will accept an incoming session.\n      'actpass':  The endpoint is willing\
    \ to accept an incoming\n                  session or to initiate an outgoing\
    \ session.\n   Both endpoints use the SDP offer/answer model to negotiate the\
    \ value\n   of \"ike-setup\", following the procedures determined for the \"setup\"\
    \n   attribute defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC4145].  However, \"holdconn\",\n\
    \   as defined in [RFC4145], is not defined for the \"ike-setup\"\n   attribute.\n\

    \ transmit both IKE and IPsec packets over the NAT.\n   That mechanism is specified\
    \ in [RFC3947] and [RFC3948]: both\n   endpoints encapsulate IPsec-ESP packets\
    \ with a UDP header and\n   multiplex them into the UDP path that IKE generates.\n\
    \   To indicate this type of IKE session, the offerer uses \"ike-esp-\n   udpencap\"\
    \ media lines.  In this case, the offerer MAY decide their\n   transport addresses\
    \ (combination of IP address and port) before\n   starting IKE, making use of\
    \ the ICE framework.  Because UDP-\n   encapsulated ESP packets and IKE packets\
    \ go through the same UDP hole\n   of a NAT, IPsec NAT-Traversal works if ICE\
    \ reserves simply one UDP\n   path through the NAT.  However, those UDP packets\
    \ need to be\n   multiplexed with Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]\n\
    \   packets if ICE is required to use STUN.  A method to coordinate IPsec\n  \
    \ NAT-Traversal and ICE is described in Sections 5.4 and 5.5.\n   The offer MAY\
    \ contain media lines for media other than \"ike-esp\" or\n   \"ike-esp-udpencap\"\
    .  For example, audio stream may be included in the\n   same SDP to have a voice\
    \ session when establishing the VPN.  This may\n   be useful to verify that the\
    \ connected device is indeed operated by\n   somebody who is authorized to access\
    \ it, as described in Section 9.\n   If that occurs, the negotiation described\
    \ in this specification\n   occurs only for the \"ike-esp\" or \"ike-esp-udpencap\"\
    \ media lines;\n   other media lines are negotiated and set up normally.  If the\n\
    \   answerer determines it will refuse the IKE session without beginning\n   the\
    \ IKE negotiation (e.g., the From address is not on the permitted\n   list), it\
    \ SHOULD reject the \"ike-esp\" or \"ike-esp-udpencap\" media\n   line in the\
    \ normal manner by setting the port number in the SDP\n   answer to 0 and SHOULD\
    \ process the other media lines normally (only\n   if it is still reasonable to\
    \ establish that media without VPN).\n   If the offerer and the answerer agree\
    \ to start an IKE session by the\n   offer/answer exchange, they will start the\
    \ IKE setup.  Following the\n   comedia-tls specification [RFC4572], the fingerprint\
    \ attribute, which\n   may be either a session- or a media-level SDP attribute,\
    \ is used to\n   exchange fingerprints of self-signed certificates.  If the\n\
    \   fingerprint attribute is a session-level attribute, it applies to all\n  \
    \ IKE sessions and TLS sessions for which no media-level fingerprint\n   attribute\
    \ is defined.\n   Note that it is possible for an offerer to become the IKE responder\n\
    \   and an answerer to become the IKE initiator.  For example, when a\n   Remote\
    \ Access Server (RAS) sends an INVITE to an RAS client, the\n   server may expect\
    \ the client to become an IKE initiator.  In this\n   case, the server sends an\
    \ offer SDP with ike-setup:passive and the\n   client returns an answer SDP with\
    \ ike-setup:active.\n"

- title: 5.4.  Port Usage
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Port Usage\n   IKE generally uses local UDP port 500, but the IPsec NAT-Traversal\n\
    \   specification requires a port transition to local UDP port 4500\n   during\
    \ IKE negotiation because IPsec-aware NAT may multiplex IKE\n   sessions using\
    \ port 500 without changing the port number.  If using\n   ICE for IPsec Nat-Traversal,\
    \ this port transition of IKE means ICE\n   has to generate an additional UDP\
    \ path for port 4500, and this would\n   be unnecessary overhead.  However, IPsec\
    \ NAT-Traversal allows an IKE\n   session to use local UDP port 4500 from the\
    \ beginning without using\n   port 500.  Therefore, the endpoints SHOULD use their\
    \ local UDP port\n   4500 for an IKE session from the beginning, and ICE will\
    \ only need to\n   generate a UDP path of port 4500.\n   When using ICE, a responder's\
    \ IKE port observed by an initiator is\n   not necessarily 500 or 4500.  Therefore,\
    \ an IKE initiator MUST allow\n   any destination ports in addition to 500 and\
    \ 4500 for the IKE packets\n   that it sends.  An IKE initiator just initiates\
    \ an IKE session to the\n   port number decided by an SDP offer/answer or ICE.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.5.  Multiplexing UDP Messages When Using ICE\n   Conforming to ICE, an offerer\
    \ and an answerer start a STUN\n   connectivity check after SDP exchange.  Then\
    \ the offerer initiates\n   the IKE session making use of the UDP path generated\
    \ by STUN packets.\n   In addition, UDP-encapsulated ESP packets are multiplexed\
    \ into the\n   same UDP path as IKE.  Thus, it is necessary to multiplex the three\n\
    \   different packets, STUN, IKE, and UDP-encapsulated ESP, into the same\n  \
    \ UDP path.  This section describes how to demultiplex these three\n   packets.\n\
    \   At the first step, the endpoint that received a UDP packet at the\n   multiplexed\
    \ port MUST check the first 32 bits (bits 0-31) of the UDP\n   payload.  If they\
    \ are all 0, which is defined as a non-ESP marker,\n   that packet MUST be treated\
    \ as an IKE packet.\n   Otherwise, it is judged as an ESP packet in the IPsec\
    \ NAT-Traversal\n   specification.  It is furthermore necessary to distinguish\
    \ STUN from\n   ESP.  Therefore, the bits 32-63 from the beginning of the UDP\
    \ payload\n   MUST be checked.  If the bits do not match the magic cookie of STUN\n\
    \   0x2112A442 (most packets do not match), the packet is treated as an\n   ESP\
    \ packet because it is no longer a STUN packet.\n   However, if the bits do match\
    \ the magic cookie, an additional test is\n   necessary to determine if the packet\
    \ is STUN or ESP.  The magic\n   cookie field of STUN overlaps the sequence number\
    \ field of ESP, so a\n   possibility still remains that the sequence number of\
    \ ESP coincides\n   with 0x2112A442.  In this additional test, the validity of\
    \ the\n   fingerprint attribute of the STUN message MUST be checked.  If there\n\
    \   is a valid fingerprint in the message, it is judged as a STUN packet;\n  \
    \ otherwise, it is an ESP packet.\n   The above logic is expressed as follows.\n\
    \      if SPI-field-is-all-zeros\n           { packet is IKE }\n        else\n\

    \ process, a certificate whose hash value matches the fingerprint\n   exchanged\
    \ over SDP MUST be used.  If the certificate used in IKE does\n   not match the\
    \ original fingerprint, the endpoint MUST terminate the\n   IKE session by detecting\

    \ and be\n   authenticated by each other.\n   The example described in Section\
    \ 3 is for tunnel mode IPsec used for\n   remote access, but the mode of negotiated\
    \ IPsec is not limited to\n   tunnel mode.  For example, IKE can negotiate transport\

    \ IKE and establish an IPsec security association\n   with the remote peer is\
    \ entirely the decision of each endpoint.  This\n   procedure is similar to how\
    \ VPNs are typically established in the\n   absence of SIP.\n   In the general\
    \ authentication process in IKE, subject DN or\n   subjectAltName is recognized\
    \ as the identity of the remote party.\n   However, by using SIP identity and\
    \ SIP-connected identity mechanisms\n   in this spec, certificates are used simply\
    \ as carriers for the public\n   keys of the peers and there is no need for the\
    \ information about who\n   is the signer of the certificate and who is indicated\
    \ by subject DN.\n   In this document, the purpose of using IKE is to launch the\
    \ IPsec SA;\n   it is not for the security mechanism of RTP and RTCP [RFC3550]\n\
    \   packets.  In fact, this mechanism cannot provide end-to-end security\n   inside\
    \ the VPN as long as the VPN uses tunnel mode IPsec.  Therefore,\n   other security\
    \ methods such as the Secure Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]\
    \ must be used to secure the packets.\n   When using the specification defined\
    \ in this document, it needs to be\n   considered that under the following circumstances,\
    \ security based on\n   SIP authentication provided by SIP proxy may be breached.\n\
    \   o  If a legitimate user's terminal is used by another person, it may\n   \
    \   be able to establish a VPN with the legitimate identity\n      information.\
    \  This issue also applies to the general VPN cases\n      based on the shared\
    \ secret key.  Furthermore, in SIP we have a\n      similar problem when file\
    \ transfer, IM, or comedia-tls where non-\n      voice/video is used as a means\
    \ of communication.\n   o  If a malicious user hijacks the proxy, he or she can\
    \ use whatever\n      credential is on the Access Control List (ACL) to gain access\
    \ to\n      the home network.\n   For countermeasures to these issues, it is recommended\
    \ to use unique\n   information such as a password that only a legitimate user\
    \ knows for\n   VPN establishment.  Validating the originating user by voice or\
    \ video\n   before establishing VPN would be another method.\n"
