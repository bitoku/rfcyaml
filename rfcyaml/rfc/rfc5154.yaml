  - "1.  Introduction\n   Broadband Wireless Access networks address the inadequacies\
    \ of low\n   bandwidth wireless communication for user requirements such as high\n\
    \   quality data/voice service, fast mobility, wide coverage, etc.  The\n   IEEE\
    \ 802.16 Working Group on Broadband Wireless Access Standards\n   develops standards\
    \ and recommended practices to support the\n   development and deployment of broadband\
    \ Wireless Metropolitan Area\n   Networks [IEEE802.16].\n   Recently the WiMAX\
    \ Forum, and in particular, its NWG (Network Working\n   Group) is defining the\
    \ IEEE 802.16 network architecture (e.g., IPv4,\n   IPv6, Mobility, Interworking\
    \ with different networks, AAA, etc.).\n   The NWG is thus taking on work at layers\
    \ above those defined by the\n   IEEE 802 standards (typically limited to the\
    \ physical and link-layers\n   only).  Similarly, WiBro (Wireless Broadband),\
    \ a Korean effort, which\n   focuses on the 2.3 GHz spectrum band, is also based\
    \ on the IEEE\n   802.16 specification [IEEE802.16].\n   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16]\
    \ is point-to-point and connection-oriented at\n   the MAC, physically arranged\
    \ in a point-to-multipoint structure with\n   the Base Station (BS) terminating\
    \ one end of each connection and an\n   individual Subscriber Station (SS) terminating\
    \ the other end of each\n   connection.  The IEEE 802.16 convergence sublayer\
    \ (CS) is at the\n   uppermost part of the MAC that is responsible for assigning\
    \ transmit-\n   direction Service Data Units (originating from a higher layer\n\
    \   application, e.g., IP or Ethernet at the BS or SS) to a specific\n   outbound\
    \ transport connection.  IEEE 802.16 defines two convergence\n   sublayer types,\
    \ the ATM Convergence Sublayer (CS) and the Packet CS.\n   The IP Specific Subpart\
    \ (IP CS) and the 802.3 Ethernet Specific\n   Subpart (Ethernet CS) of Packet\
    \ CS are within the current scope of\n   IETF efforts.\n   There is complexity\
    \ in configuring the IP Subnet over IEEE 802.16\n   network because of its point-to-point\
    \ connection-oriented feature and\n   the existence of IP CS and Ethernet CS,\
    \ which assume different\n   higher-layer functionality.  An IP Subnet is a topological\
    \ area that\n   uses the same IP address prefix where that prefix is not further\n\
    \   subdivided except into individual addresses as specified in\n   [RFC4903].\
    \  The IP Subnet configuration is dependent on the\n   underlying link-layer's\
    \ characteristic and decides the overall IP\n   operation on the network.  The\
    \ IP CS and Ethernet CS of IEEE 802.16\n   assume different higher layer capabilities:\
    \ IP routing functionality\n   in the case of IP CS and bridging functionality\
    \ in the case of\n   Ethernet CS.  This means that the link-layer's characteristics\n\
    \   beneath IP can change according to the adopted convergence sublayers.\n  \
    \ This document provides the feasible IP Subnet model for each IP CS\n   and Ethernet\
    \ CS and specifies the problems in running IP for each\n   case.  This document\
    \ also presents an overview of IEEE 802.16 network\n   characteristics specifically\
    \ focusing on the convergence sublayers\n   and the common terminology to be used\
    \ for the base guideline while\n   defining solution frameworks.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   Subscriber Station (SS): An end-user equipment that provides\n\
    \   connectivity to the IEEE 802.16 networks.  It can be either fixed/\n   nomadic\
    \ or mobile equipment.  In mobile environment, SS represents\n   the Mobile Subscriber\
    \ Station (MS) introduced in [IEEE802.16e].\n   Base Station (BS): A generalized\
    \ equipment set that provides\n   connectivity, management, and control between\
    \ the subscriber station\n   and the IEEE 802.16 networks.\n   Access Router (AR):\
    \ An entity that performs an IP routing function to\n   provide IP connectivity\
    \ for the subscriber station (SS or MS).\n   Protocol Data Unit (PDU): This refers\
    \ to the data format passed from\n   the lower edge of the MAC to the PHY, which\
    \ typically contains SDU\n   data after fragmentation/packing, encryption, etc.\n\
    \   Service Data Unit (SDU): This refers to the data format passed to the\n  \
    \ upper edge of the MAC\n   IP Subnet: Topological area that uses the same IP\
    \ address prefix\n   where that prefix is not further subdivided except into individual\n\
    \   addresses as specified from [RFC4903].\n   Link: Topological area bounded\
    \ by routers, which decrement the IPv4\n   TTL or IPv6 Hop Limit when forwarding\

    \ layer connection in IEEE 802.16 between\n   an SS (MS) and BS with a specific\
    \ Quality of Service (QoS)\n   attributes.  Several types of connections are defined\
    \ and these\n   include broadcast, unicast, and multicast.  Each transport connection\n\
    \   is uniquely identified by a 16-bit connection identifier (CID).  A\n   transport\
    \ connection is a unique connection intended for user\n   traffic.  The scope\
    \ of the transport connection is between the SS\n   (MS) and the BS.\n   Connection\
    \ Identifier (CID): A 16-bit value that identifies a\n   connection to equivalent\

    \ called \"BSId\".  The BS and SS learn each others' MAC\n   Address/BSId during\
    \ the SS's entry into the network.  Additionally,\n   the BS may possess a 48-bit\

    \ signaling sequence within the MAC layer (usually initiated\n   by the BS).\n\
    \   A downlink-direction transport connection is regarded as \"multicast\"\n \

- title: 3.3.  IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer\n   The IEEE 802.16 convergence sublayer\
    \ (CS) is the component of the MAC\n   that is responsible for mapping between\
    \ the MAC service and the\n   internal connection oriented service of the MAC\
    \ CPS (Common Part\n   Sublayer), through classification and encapsulation.  The\n\
    \   classification process assigns transmit-direction Service Data Units\n   (originating\
    \ from a higher layer application, e.g., an IP stack at\n   the BS or SS) to a\
    \ specific outbound transport connection.  The\n   convergence sublayer maintains\
    \ an ordered \"classifier table\".  Each\n   entry in the classifier table includes\
    \ a classifier and a target CID.\n   A classifier, in turn, consists of a conjunction\
    \ of one or more\n   subclassifiers -- where each subclassifier specifies a packet\
    \ field\n   (e.g., the destination MAC address in an Ethernet frame, or the Type\n\
    \   of Service (TOS) field of an IP datagram contained in an Ethernet\n   frame)\
    \ together with a particular value or range of values for the\n   field.  To perform\
    \ classification on an outbound Service Data Unit,\n   the convergence sublayer\
    \ proceeds from the first entry of the\n   classifier table to the last, and evaluates\
    \ the fields of the Service\n   Data Unit for a match with the table entry's classifier.\
    \  When a\n   match is found, the convergence sublayer associates the Service\
    \ Data\n   Unit with the target CID (for eventual transmission), and the\n   remainder\
    \ of the IEEE 802.16 MAC and PHY processing can take place.\n   IEEE 802.16 defines\
    \ two convergence sublayer types, the ATM CS and\n   the Packet CS.  The ATM CS\
    \ supports ATM directly.  The Packet CS is\n   subdivided into three specific\
    \ subparts.\n   o  \"The IP Specific Subpart\" carries IP packets over a point-to-point\n\
    \      connection.\n   o  \"The 802.3 Ethernet Specific Subpart\" carries packets\
    \ encoded in\n      the 802.3/Ethernet packet format with 802.3 style headers.\n\
    \   o  \"The 802.1Q VLAN Specific Subpart\" carries 802 style packets that\n \
    \     contain 802.1Q VLAN Tags.\n   Classifiers applied to connections at the\
    \ time of connection\n   establishment further classify and subdivide the nature\
    \ of the\n   traffic over a connection.\n   The classifications that apply to\
    \ the Ethernet CS include packet over\n   the 802.3/Ethernet CS, IPv4 over the\
    \ 802.3/Ethernet CS, IPv6 over the\n   802.3/Ethernet CS, 802.3/Ethernet CS with\
    \ RObust Header Compression\n   (ROHC) header compression and 802.3/Ethernet with\
    \ Enhanced Compressed\n   Real-Time Protocol (ECRTP) header compression.\n   The\
    \ classifications that apply to the 802.1Q/VLAN CS include IPv4\n   over 802.1Q/VLAN\
    \ and IPv6 over 802.1Q/VLAN.\n   It should be noted that while the 802.3/Ethernet\
    \ CS has a packet\n   classification that does not restrict the IP version (packet\
    \ over the\n   802.3/Ethernet CS), the IP CS and 802.1Q/VLAN CS do.  All the IP\n\
    \   classifiers for those CSs are either IPv4 or IPv6.\n   The classifiers enable\
    \ the MAC to be sure of the presence of fields\n   in the headers and so to be\
    \ able to apply the payload header\n   suppression (PHS) feature of IEEE 802.16\
    \ to those headers.\n   For the sake of brevity in this document, the following\
    \ naming\n   conventions will be used for particular classifications of particular\n\
    \   subparts of particular CSs.\n   o  IPv4 CS: Packet CS, IP Specific Subpart,\
    \ Classifier 1 (Packet,\n      IPv4)\n   o  IPv6 CS: Packet CS, IP Specific Subpart,\
    \ Classifier 2 (Packet,\n      IPv6)\n   o  Ethernet CS: Packet CS, 802.3/Ethernet\
    \ Subpart, Classifier 3\n      (Packet, 802.3/Ethernet)\n   An implementation\
    \ of IEEE 802.16 can support multiple CS types.\n   We can observe that the CS\
    \ type, subpart, and classification actually\n   defines the type of data interface\
    \ (e.g., IPv4/IPv6 or 802.3) that is\n   presented by IEEE 802.16 to the higher\

- title: 4.1.  Root Problem
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Root Problem\n   The key issue when deploying IP over IEEE 802.16 networks\
    \ is how to\n   configure an IP Subnet over that link, which is connection-oriented\n\
    \   and point-to-point in the MAC level.  IP Subnet is a topological area\n  \
    \ that uses the same IP address prefix where that prefix is not further\n   subdivided\
    \ except into individual addresses.  [RFC4903] There are\n   three different IP\
    \ Subnet models [RFC4968] that are possible for IEEE\n   802.16 network:\n   1)\
    \ Point-to-point Link Model\n   2) Ethernet-like Link Model\n   3) Shared IPv6\
    \ Prefix Link Model\n   The specific problems and issues when adopting the above\
    \ IP Subnet\n   models to the IEEE 802.16 network are as below:\n   In the point-to-point\
    \ link model, each SS under a BS resides on a\n   different IP Subnet.  Therefore,\
    \ only a certain SS and an AR exist\n   under an IP Subnet, and IP packets with\
    \ destination address of link\n   local scope are delivered only within the point-to-point\
    \ link between\n   a SS and an AR.  PPP [RFC1661] has been widely used for this\
    \ kind of\n   point-to-point link.  However, the direct use of PPP is not possible\n\
    \   on the IEEE 802.16 network because IEEE 802.16 does not define a\n   convergence\
    \ sublayer, which can encapsulate and decapsulate PPP\n   frames.  Therefore,\
    \ there needs to be a mechanism to provide a point-\n   to-point link between\
    \ an SS and an AR in case of IP CS.  The other\n   alternative is to utilize PPP\
    \ over Ethernet by using the Ethernet CS.\n   However, Ethernet CS assumes the\
    \ upper layer's bridging functionality\n   to realize the Ethernet-like link model.\n\
    \   In the Ethernet-like link model, all SSs under an AR reside on the\n   same\
    \ IP Subnet.  This also applies when SSs are connected with\n   different BSs.\
    \  This Ethernet-like link model assumes that underlying\n   link-layer provides\
    \ the equivalent functionality like Ethernet, for\n   example, native broadcast\
    \ and multicast.  It seems feasible to apply\n   IEEE 802.16's Ethernet CS to\
    \ configure this link model.  However,\n   IEEE 802.16's MAC feature is still\
    \ connection-oriented, and does not\n   provide multicast and broadcast connection\
    \ for IP packet transfer.\n   Therefore, we need a mechanism like IEEE 802.1D\
    \ to realize multicast\n   and broadcast.  Moreover, frequent IP multicast and\
    \ broadcast\n   signaling should be avoided so as not to wake up the SSs that\
    \ are in\n   sleep/idle mode [IEEE802.16e].\n   The shared IPv6 prefix link model\
    \ eventually results in multi-link\n   subnet problems [RFC4903].  In IEEE 802.16,\
    \ the BS assigns separate\n   IEEE 802.16 connections for SSs.  Therefore, SSs\
    \ are placed on\n   different links.  In this situation, distributing shared IPv6\
    \ prefix\n   for SSs, which are placed on different links causes multi-link subnet\n\
    \   problems.  This applies to IP CS and even to Ethernet CS if no\n   bridging\
    \ functionality is implemented on top of the BS or between the\n   BS and the\
    \ AR.\n   We identified the feasible IP Subnet models for IEEE 802.16 networks\n\
    \   depending on the convergence sublayers.  At the current stage, only\n   the\
    \ IP CS and Ethernet CS of IEEE 802.16 are within the scope of\n   ongoing IETF\
    \ work.  Following are the feasible IP Subnet models for\n   each convergence\
    \ sublayer used.\n   1.  Point-to-Point Link model for IP CS.\n   2.  Ethernet-like\
    \ Link Model for Ethernet CS.\n   According to the point-to-point feature of the\
    \ IEEE 802.16 MAC, the\n   Point-to-Point link model is the feasible IP Subnet\
    \ model in the case\n   of IP CS.  For the Ethernet CS, the Ethernet-like link\
    \ model is the\n   feasible IP Subnet model.  However, in this model unnecessary\n\
    \   multicast and broadcast packets within an IP Subnet should be\n   minimized.\n"

  - "4.2.  Point-to-Point Link Model for IP CS: Problems\n   - Address Resolution:\n\
    \   Address Resolution is the process by which IP nodes determine the\n   link-layer\
    \ address of a destination node on the same IP Subnet given\n   only the destination's\
    \ IP address.  In the case of IP CS, the IEEE\n   802.16 MAC address is not used\
    \ as part of the IEEE 802.16 frame so\n   typical usage of the Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP) or Neighbor\n   cache does not apply.  Thus, performing the address\
    \ resolution may be\n   redundant in the case of IP CS.  For IPv4, ARP cannot\
    \ be carried by\n   the IP CS, so is not used either by the SS or by the BS. \
    \ For IPv6,\n   address resolution is the function of IP layer, and IP reachability\n\
    \   state is maintained through neighbor discovery packets.  Therefore,\n   blocking\
    \ neighbor discovery packets would break the neighbor\n   unreachability detection\
    \ model.\n   - Router Discovery:\n   The BS needs to send the Router Advertisement\
    \ (RA) with separate IP\n   prefix in unicast manner for each SS explicitly to\
    \ send periodic\n   router advertisements in IEEE 802.16 Networks.\n   - Prefix\
    \ Assignment:\n   Separate IP prefix should be distributed for each SS to locate\
    \ them\n   on different IP Subnets.  When an SS moves between BSs under the same\n\
    \   AR, the AR needs to redistribute the same IP Subnet prefix, which the\n  \
    \ SS used at the previous BS.\n   - Next-Hop:\n   SS's next-hop always needs to\
    \ be the AR that provides the IP\n   connectivity at that access network.\n  \
    \ - Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD):\n   Because the SS always sees an\
    \ AR as the next hop, the NUD is required\n   only for that AR.  Also the requirement\
    \ of NUD may depend on the\n   existence of a connection to the BS for that particular\
    \ destination.\n   - Address Autoconfiguration:\n   Because a unique prefix is\
    \ assigned to each SS, the IP Subnet\n   consists of only one SS and an AR.  Therefore,\
    \ duplicate address\n   detection (DAD) is trivial.\n"

  - "4.3.  Ethernet-Like Link Model for Ethernet CS: Problems\n   - Address Resolution:\n\
    \   For Ethernet CS, the sender needs to perform an address resolution to\n  \
    \ fill the destination Ethernet address field even though that address\n   is\
    \ not used for transmitting an IEEE 802.16 frame on the air.  That\n   Ethernet\
    \ destination address is used for a BS or bridge to decide\n   where to forward\
    \ that Ethernet frame after decapsulating the IEEE\n   802.16 frame.  When the\
    \ destination's IP address has the same address\n   prefix with its own, the sender\
    \ should set the Ethernet frame's\n   destination address as the destination itself.\
    \  To acquire that\n   address, the address resolution should be performed throughout\n\
    \   conventional broadcast- and multicast-based ARP or Neighbor Discovery\n  \
    \ Protocol (NDP).  However, if not filtered (e.g., [RFC4541]), these\n   multicast\
    \ and broadcast packets result in the problem of waking up\n   the SSs that are\
    \ in sleep/idle mode [IEEE802.16e].\n   - Router Discovery:\n   All SSs under\
    \ the AR are located in the same broadcast domain in the\n   Ethernet-like link\
    \ model.  In this environment, sending periodic\n   Router Advertisements with\
    \ the destination of all-nodes multicast\n   address results in the problem of\
    \ waking up the SSs that are in\n   sleep/idle mode [IEEE802.16e].\n   - Prefix\
    \ Assignment:\n   Because the same IP prefix is shared with multiple SSs, an IP\
    \ Subnet\n   consists of multiple SSs and an AR.  The SS assumes that there exist\n\
    \   on-link neighbors and tries to resolve the L2 address for the on-link\n  \
    \ prefixes.  However, direct communication using link-layer address\n   between\
    \ two SSs is not possible with Ethernet CS alone; bridging\n   functionality must\
    \ be added on top of the BS or between the BS and\n   AR.\n   - Next-Hop:\n  \
    \ When Ethernet CS is used and the accompanying Ethernet capability\n   emulation\
    \ is implemented, the next-hop for the destination IP with\n   the same global\
    \ prefix with the sender or link local address type\n   should be the destination\
    \ itself not an AR.\n   - Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD):\n   All SSs\
    \ under the same AR are all the neighbors.  Therefore, the NUD\n   is required\
    \ for all the SSs and AR.\n   - Address Autoconfiguration:\n   Duplicate Address\
    \ Detection (DAD) should be performed among multiple\n   SSs and an AR, which\
    \ use the same IP prefix.  The previous multicast-\n   based DAD causes the problem\
    \ of waking up the SSs that are in sleep/\n   idle mode [IEEE802.16e].\n"

  - "4.4.  IP over IEEE 802.16 Goals\n   The following are the goals in no particular\
    \ order that point at\n   relevant work to be done in IETF.\n   Goal #1.  Define\
    \ the way to provide the point-to-point link model for\n             IP CS.\n\
    \   Goal #2.  Reduce the power consumption caused by waking up sleep/idle\n  \
    \           [IEEE802.16e] terminals for Ethernet-like link model.\n   Goal #3.\
    \  Avoid multi-link subnet problems.\n   Goal #4.  Allow applicability of security\
    \ schemes such as SEcure\n             Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971].\n\
    \   Goal #5.  Do not introduce any new security threats.\n   Goal #6.  Review\
    \ management requirements and specifically the\n             interfaces and specific\
    \ management model (objects) for IP\n             over IEEE 802.16 in collaboration\
