  - "1. Introduction\n   As defined in RFC-822, [2], an electronic mail message consists\
    \ of a\n   number of defined header fields, some containing structured\n   information\
    \ (e.g., date, addresses), and a message body consisting of\n   an unstructured\
    \ string of ASCII characters.\n   The success of the Internet mail system has\
    \ led to a desire to use\n   the mail system for sending around information with\
    \ a greater degree\n   of structure, while remaining within the constraints imposed\
    \ by the\n   limited character set.  A prime example is the use of mail to send\
    \ a\n   document with embedded TROFF formatting commands.  A more\n   sophisticated\
    \ example would be a message body encoded in a Page\n   Description Language (PDL)\
    \ such as Postscript.  In both cases, simply\n   mapping the ASCII characters\
    \ to the screen or printer in the usual\n   fashion will not render the document\
    \ image intended by the sender; an\n   additional processing step is required\
    \ to produce an image of the\n   message text on a display device or a piece of\
    \ paper.\n   In both of these examples, the message body contains only the legal\n\
    \   character set, but the content has a structure which produces some\n   desirable\
    \ result after appropriate processing by the recipient.  If a\n   message header\
    \ field could be used to indicate the structuring\n   technique used in the message\
    \ body, then a sophisticated mail system\n   could use such a field to automatically\
    \ invoke the appropriate\n   processing of the message body.  For example, a header\
    \ field which\n   indicated that the message body was encoded using Postscript\
    \ could be\n   used to direct a mail system running under Sun Microsystem's NEWS\n\
    \   window manager to process the Postscript to produce the appropriate\n   page\
    \ image on the screen.\n   Private header fields (beginning with \"X-\") are already\
    \ being used by\n   some systems to affect such a result (e.g., the Andrew Message\
    \ System\n   developed at Carnegie Mellon University).  However, the widespread\n\
    \   use of such techniques will require general agreement on the name and\n  \
    \ allowed parameter values for a header field to be used for this\n   purpose.\n\
    \   We propose that a new header field, \"Content-type:\"  be recognized as\n\
    \   the standard field for indicating the structure of the message body.\n   The\
    \ contents of the \"Content-Type:\"  field are parameters which\n   specify what\
    \ type of structure is used in the message body.\n   Note that we are not proposing\
    \ that the message body contain anything\n   other than ASCII characters as specified\
    \ in RFC-822.  Whatever\n   structuring is contained in the message body must\
    \ be represented\n   using only the allowed ASCII characters.  Thus, this proposal\
    \ should\n   have no impact on existing mailers, only on mail reading systems.\n\
    \   At the same time, this restriction eliminates the use of more general\n  \
    \ structuring techniques such as Abstract Syntax Notation, (CCITT\n   Recommendation\
    \ X.409) as used in the X.400 messaging standard, which\n   are octet-oriented.\n\
    \   This is not the first proposal for structuring message bodies.\n   RFC-767\
    \ discusses a proposed technique for structuring multi-media\n   mail messages.\
    \  We are also aware that many users already employ mail\n   to send TROFF, SCRIBE,\
    \ TEX, Postscript or other structured\n   information.  Such postprocessing as\
    \ is required must be invoked\n   manually by the message recipient who looks\
    \ at the message text\n   displayed as conventional ASCII and recognizes that\
    \ it is structured\n   in some way that requires additional processing to be properly\n\
    \   rendered.  Our proposal is designed to facilitate automatic\n   processing\
    \ of messages by a mail reading system.\n"
- title: 2. Problems with Structured Messages
  contents:
  - "2. Problems with Structured Messages\n   Once we introduce the notion that a\
    \ message body might require some\n   processing other than simply painting the\
    \ characters to the screen we\n   raise a number of fundamental questions.  These\
    \ generally arise due\n   to the certainty that some receiving systems will have\
    \ the facilities\n   to process the received message and some will not.  The problem\
    \ is\n   what to do in the presence of systems with different levels of\n   capability.\n\
    \   First, we must recognize that the purpose of structured messages is\n   to\
    \ be able to send types of information, ultimately intended for\n   human consumption,\
    \ not expressable in plain ASCII.  Thus, there is no\n   way in plain ASCII to\
    \ send the italics, boldface, or greek characters\n   that can be expressed in\
    \ Postscript.  If some different processing is\n   necessary to render these glyphs,\
    \ then that is the minimum price to\n   be paid in order to send them at all.\n\
    \   Second, by insisting that the message body contain only ASCII, we\n   insure\
    \ that it will not \"break\" current mail reading systems which\n   are not equipped\
    \ to process the structure; the result on the screen\n   may not be readily interpretable\
    \ by the human reader, however.\n   If a message sender knows that the recipient\
    \ cannot process\n   Postscript, he or she may prefer that the message be revised\
    \ to\n   eliminate the use of italics and boldface, rather than appear\n   incomprehensible.\
    \  If Postscript is being used because the message\n   contains passages in Greek,\
    \ there may be no suitable ASCII\n   equivalent, however.\n   Ideally, the details\
    \ of structuring the message (or not) to conform\n   to the capabilities of the\
    \ recipient system could be completely\n   hidden from the message sender.  The\
    \ distributed Internet mail system\n   would somehow determine the capabilities\
    \ of the recipient system, and\n   convert the message automatically; or, if there\
    \ was no way to send\n   Greek text in ASCII, inform the sender that his message\
    \ could not be\n   transmitted.\n   In practice, this is a difficult task.  There\
    \ are three possible\n   approaches:\n      1. Each mail system maintains a database\
    \ of capabilities of\n         remote systems it knows how to send to.  Such a\
    \ database\n         would be very difficult to keep up to date.\n      2. The\
    \ mail transport service negotiates with the receiving\n         system as to\
    \ its capabilities.  If the receiving system\n         cannot support the specified\
    \ content type, the mail is\n         transformed into conventional ASCII before\
    \ transmission.\n         This would require changes to all existing SMTP\n  \
    \       implementations, and could not be implemented in the case\n         where\
    \ RFC-822 type messages are being forwarded via Bitnet or\n         other networks\
    \ which do not implement SMTP.\n      3. An expanded directory service maintains\
    \ information on mail\n         processing capabilities of receiving hosts.  This\
    \ eliminates\n         the need for real-time negotiation with the final\n   \
    \      destination, but still requires direct interaction with the\n         directory\
    \ service.  Since directory querying is part of mail\n         sending as opposed\
    \ to mail composing/reading systems, this\n         requires changes to existing\
    \ mailers as well as a major\n         change to the domain name directory service.\n\
    \   We note in passing that the X.400 protocol implements approach number\n  \
    \ 2, and that the Draft Recommendations for X.DS, the Directory\n   Service, would\
    \ support option 3.\n   In the interest of facilitating early usage of structured\
    \ messages,\n   we choose not to recommend any of the three approaches described\n\
    \   above at the present time.  In a forthcoming RFC we will propose a\n   solution\
    \ based on option 2, requiring modification to mailers to\n   support negotiation\
    \ over capabilities.  For the present, then, users\n   would be obliged to keep\
    \ their own private list of capabilities of\n   recipients and to take care that\
    \ they do not send Postscript, TROFF\n   or other structured messages to recipients\
    \ who cannot process them.\n   The penalty for failure to do so will be the frustration\
    \ of the\n   recipient in trying to read a raw Postscript or TROFF file painted\
    \ on\n   his or her screen.  Some System Administrators may attempt to\n   implement\
    \ option 1 for the benefit of their users, but this does not\n   impose a requirement\
    \ for changes on any other mail system.\n   We recognize that the long-term solution\
    \ must require changes to\n   mailers.  However, in order to begin now to standardize\
    \ the header\n   fields, and to facilitate experimentation, we issue the present\
    \ RFC.\n"
- title: 3. The Content-type Header Field
  contents:
  - "3. The Content-type Header Field\n   Whatever structuring technique is specified\
    \ by the Content-type\n   field, it must be known precisely to both the sender\
    \ and the\n   recipient of the message in order for the message to be properly\n\
    \   interpreted.  In general, this means that the allowed parameter\n   values\
    \ for the Content-type:  field must identify a well-defined,\n   standardized,\
    \ document structuring technique.  We do not preclude,\n   however, the use of\
    \ a Content-type:  parameter value to specify a\n   private structuring technique\
    \ known only to the sender and the\n   recipient.\n   More precisely, we propose\
    \ that the Content-type:  header field\n   consist of up to four parameter values.\
    \  The first, or type parameter\n   names the structuring technique; the second,\
    \ optional, parameter is a\n   version number, ver-num, which indicates a particular\
    \ version or\n   revision of the standardized structuring technique.  The third\n\
    \   parameter is a resource reference, resource-ref, which may indicate a\n  \
    \ standard database of information to be used in interpreting the\n   structured\
    \ document.  The last parameter is a comment.\n   In the Extended Backus Naur\
