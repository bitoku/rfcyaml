  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a new resource record (RR) for the\
    \ Domain\n   Name System (DNS) [RFC1034], and how to use it with the Host Identity\n\
    \   Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201].  This RR allows a HIP node to store in the\n   DNS\
    \ its Host Identity (HI, the public component of the node public-\n   private\
    \ key pair), Host Identity Tag (HIT, a truncated hash of its\n   HI), and the\
    \ Domain Names of its rendezvous servers (RVSs) [RFC5204].\n   Currently, most\
    \ of the Internet applications that need to communicate\n   with a remote host\
    \ first translate a domain name (often obtained via\n   user input) into one or\
    \ more IP address(es).  This step occurs prior\n   to communication with the remote\
    \ host, and relies on a DNS lookup.\n   With HIP, IP addresses are intended to\
    \ be used mostly for on-the-wire\n   communication between end hosts, while most\
    \ Upper Layer Protocols\n   (ULP) and applications use HIs or HITs instead (ICMP\
    \ might be an\n   example of an ULP not using them).  Consequently, we need a\
    \ means to\n   translate a domain name into an HI.  Using the DNS for this\n \
    \  translation is pretty straightforward: We define a new HIP resource\n   record.\
    \  Upon query by an application or ULP for a name to IP address\n   lookup, the\
    \ resolver would then additionally perform a name to HI\n   lookup, and use it\
    \ to construct the resulting HI to IP address\n   mapping (which is internal to\
    \ the HIP layer).  The HIP layer uses the\n   HI to IP address mapping to translate\
    \ HIs and HITs into IP addresses\n   and vice versa.\n   The HIP Rendezvous Extension\
    \ [RFC5204] allows a HIP node to be\n   reached via the IP address(es) of a third\
    \ party, the node's\n   rendezvous server (RVS).  An Initiator willing to establish\
    \ a HIP\n   association with a Responder served by an RVS would typically\n  \
    \ initiate a HIP exchange by sending an I1 towards the RVS IP address\n   rather\
    \ than towards the Responder IP address.  Consequently, we need\n   a means to\
    \ find the name of a rendezvous server for a given host\n   name.\n   This document\
    \ introduces the new HIP DNS resource record to store the\n   Rendezvous Server\
    \ (RVS), Host Identity (HI), and Host Identity Tag\n   (HIT) information.\n"

- title: 3.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "3.  Usage Scenarios\n   In this section, we briefly introduce a number of usage\
    \ scenarios\n   where the DNS is useful with the Host Identity Protocol.\n   With\
    \ HIP, most applications and ULPs are unaware of the IP addresses\n   used to\
    \ carry packets on the wire.  Consequently, a HIP node could\n   take advantage\
    \ of having multiple IP addresses for fail-over,\n   redundancy, mobility, or\
    \ renumbering, in a manner that is transparent\n   to most ULPs and applications\
    \ (because they are bound to HIs; hence,\n   they are agnostic to these IP address\
    \ changes).\n   In these situations, for a node to be reachable by reference to\
    \ its\n   Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), the following information should\n\
    \   be stored in the DNS:\n   o  A set of IP address(es) via A [RFC1035] and AAAA\
    \ [RFC3596] RR sets\n      (RRSets [RFC2181]).\n   o  A Host Identity (HI), Host\
    \ Identity Tag (HIT), and possibly a set\n      of rendezvous servers (RVS) through\
    \ HIP RRs.\n   When a HIP node wants to initiate communication with another HIP\n\
    \   node, it first needs to perform a HIP base exchange to set up a HIP\n   association\
    \ towards its peer.  Although such an exchange can be\n   initiated opportunistically,\
    \ i.e., without prior knowledge of the\n   Responder's HI, by doing so both nodes\
    \ knowingly risk man-in-the-\n   middle attacks on the HIP exchange.  To prevent\
    \ these attacks, it is\n   recommended that the Initiator first obtain the HI\
    \ of the Responder,\n   and then initiate the exchange.  This can be done, for\
    \ example,\n   through manual configuration or DNS lookups.  Hence, a new HIP\
    \ RR is\n   introduced.\n   When a HIP node is frequently changing its IP address(es),\
    \ the\n   natural DNS latency for propagating changes may prevent it from\n  \
    \ publishing its new IP address(es) in the DNS.  For solving this\n   problem,\
    \ the HIP Architecture [RFC4423] introduces rendezvous servers\n   (RVSs) [RFC5204].\
    \  A HIP host uses a rendezvous server as a\n   rendezvous point to maintain reachability\
    \ with possible HIP\n   initiators while moving [RFC5206].  Such a HIP node would\
    \ publish in\n   the DNS its RVS domain name(s) in a HIP RR, while keeping its\
    \ RVS up-\n   to-date with its current set of IP addresses.\n   When a HIP node\
    \ wants to initiate a HIP exchange with a Responder, it\n   will perform a number\
    \ of DNS lookups.  Depending on the type of\n   implementation, the order in which\
    \ those lookups will be issued may\n   vary.  For instance, implementations using\
    \ HIT in APIs may typically\n   first query for HIP resource records at the Responder\
    \ FQDN, while\n   those using an IP address in APIs may typically first query\
    \ for A\n   and/or AAAA resource records.\n   In the following, we assume that\
    \ the Initiator first queries for HIP\n   resource records at the Responder FQDN.\n\
    \   If the query for the HIP type was responded to with a DNS answer with\n  \
    \ RCODE=3 (Name Error), then the Responder's information is not present\n   in\
    \ the DNS and further queries for the same owner name SHOULD NOT be\n   made.\n\
    \   In case the query for the HIP records returned a DNS answer with\n   RCODE=0\
    \ (No Error) and an empty answer section, it means that no HIP\n   information\
    \ is available at the responder name.  In such a case, if\n   the Initiator has\
    \ been configured with a policy to fallback to\n   opportunistic HIP (initiating\
    \ without knowing the Responder's HI) or\n   plain IP, it would send out more\
    \ queries for A and AAAA types at the\n   Responder's FQDN.\n   Depending on the\
    \ combinations of answers, the situations described in\n   Section 3.1 and Section\
    \ 3.2 can occur.\n   Note that storing HIP RR information in the DNS at an FQDN\
    \ that is\n   assigned to a non-HIP node might have ill effects on its reachability\n\
    \   by HIP nodes.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Storing HI, HIT, and RVS in the DNS
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Storing HI, HIT, and RVS in the DNS\n   For any HIP node, its Host Identity\
    \ (HI), the associated Host\n   Identity Tag (HIT), and the FQDN of its possible\
    \ RVSs can be stored\n   in a DNS HIP RR.  Any conforming implementation may store\
    \ a Host\n   Identity (HI) and its associated Host Identity Tag (HIT) in a DNS\
    \ HIP\n   RDATA format.  HI and HIT are defined in Section 3 of the HIP\n   specification\
    \ [RFC5201].\n   Upon return of a HIP RR, a host MUST always calculate the HI-\n\
    \   derivative HIT to be used in the HIP exchange, as specified in\n   Section\
    \ 3 of the HIP specification [RFC5201], while the HIT possibly\n   embedded along\
    \ SHOULD only be used as an optimization (e.g., table\n   lookup).\n   The HIP\
    \ resource record may also contain one or more domain name(s)\n   of rendezvous\
    \ server(s) towards which HIP I1 packets might be sent to\n   trigger the establishment\
    \ of an association with the entity named by\n   this resource record [RFC5204].\n\
    \   The rendezvous server field of the HIP resource record stored at a\n   given\
    \ owner name MAY include the owner name itself.  A semantically\n   equivalent\
    \ situation occurs if no rendezvous server is present in the\n   HIP resource\
    \ record stored at that owner name.  Such situations occur\n   in two cases:\n\
    \   o  The host is mobile, and the A and/or AAAA resource record(s)\n      stored\
    \ at its host name contain the IP address(es) of its\n      rendezvous server\
    \ rather than its own one.\n   o  The host is stationary, and can be reached directly\
    \ at the IP\n      address(es) contained in the A and/or AAAA resource record(s)\n\
    \      stored at its host name.  This is a degenerated case of rendezvous\n  \
    \    service where the host somewhat acts as a rendezvous server for\n      itself.\n\
    \   An RVS receiving such an I1 would then relay it to the appropriate\n   Responder\
    \ (the owner of the I1 receiver HIT).  The Responder will\n   then complete the\
    \ exchange with the Initiator, typically without\n   ongoing help from the RVS.\n"

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This section contains a description of the known\
    \ threats involved\n   with the usage of the HIP DNS Extension.\n   In a manner\
    \ similar to the IPSECKEY RR [RFC4025], the HIP DNS\n   Extension allows for the\
    \ provision of two HIP nodes with the public\n   keying material (HI) of their\
    \ peer.  These HIs will be subsequently\n   used in a key exchange between the\
    \ peers.  Hence, the HIP DNS\n   Extension introduces the same kind of threats\
    \ that IPSECKEY does,\n   plus threats caused by the possibility given to a HIP\
    \ node to\n   initiate or accept a HIP exchange using \"opportunistic\" or\n \
    \  \"unpublished Initiator HI\" modes.\n   A HIP node SHOULD obtain HIP RRs from\
    \ a trusted party trough a secure\n   channel ensuring data integrity and authenticity\
    \ of the RRs.  DNSSEC\n   [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] provides such a secure\
    \ channel.\n   However, it should be emphasized that DNSSEC only offers data\n\
    \   integrity and authenticity guarantees to the channel between the DNS\n   server\
    \ publishing a zone and the HIP node.  DNSSEC does not ensure\n   that the entity\
    \ publishing the zone is trusted.  Therefore, the RRSIG\n   signature of the HIP\
    \ RRSet MUST NOT be misinterpreted as a\n   certificate binding the HI and/or\
    \ the HIT to the owner name.\n   In the absence of a proper secure channel, both\
    \ parties are\n   vulnerable to MitM and DoS attacks, and unrelated parties might\
    \ be\n   subject to DoS attacks as well.  These threats are described in the\n\
    \   following sections.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Attacker Tampering with an Insecure HIP RR
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Attacker Tampering with an Insecure HIP RR\n   The HIP RR contains public\
    \ keying material in the form of the named\n   peer's public key (the HI) and\
    \ its secure hash (the HIT).  Both of\n   these are not sensitive to attacks where\
    \ an adversary gains knowledge\n   of them.  However, an attacker that is able\
    \ to mount an active attack\n   on the DNS, i.e., tampers with this HIP RR (e.g.,\
    \ using DNS\n   spoofing), is able to mount Man-in-the-Middle attacks on the\n\
    \   cryptographic core of the eventual HIP exchange (Responder's HIP RR\n   rewritten\
    \ by the attacker).\n   The HIP RR may contain a rendezvous server domain name\
    \ resolved into\n   a destination IP address where the named peer is reachable\
    \ by an I1,\n   as per the HIP Rendezvous Extension [RFC5204].  Thus, an attacker\n\
    \   able to tamper with this RR is able to redirect I1 packets sent to\n   the\
    \ named peer to a chosen IP address for DoS or MitM attacks.  Note\n   that this\
    \ kind of attack is not specific to HIP and exists\n   independently of whether\
    \ or not HIP and the HIP RR are used.  Such an\n   attacker might tamper with\
    \ A and AAAA RRs as well.\n   An attacker might obviously use these two attacks\
    \ in conjunction: It\n   will replace the Responder's HI and RVS IP address by\
    \ its own in a\n   spoofed DNS packet sent to the Initiator HI, then redirect\
    \ all\n   exchanged packets to him and mount a MitM on HIP.  In this case, HIP\n\
    \   won't provide confidentiality nor Initiator HI protection from\n   eavesdroppers.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Hash and HITs Collisions
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Hash and HITs Collisions\n   As with many cryptographic algorithms, some\
    \ secure hashes (e.g.,\n   SHA1, used by HIP to generate a HIT from an HI) eventually\
    \ become\n   insecure, because an exploit has been found in which an attacker\
    \ with\n   reasonable computation power breaks one of the security features of\n\
    \   the hash (e.g., its supposed collision resistance).  This is why a\n   HIP\
    \ end-node implementation SHOULD NOT authenticate its HIP peers\n   based solely\
    \ on a HIT retrieved from the DNS, but SHOULD rather use\n   HI-based authentication.\n"
- title: 8.3.  DNSSEC
  contents:
  - "8.3.  DNSSEC\n   In the absence of DNSSEC, the HIP RR is subject to the threats\n\

- title: 9.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has allocated one new RR type code (55) for\
    \ the HIP RR from the\n   standard RR type space.\n   IANA does not need to open\
    \ a new registry for public key algorithms\n   of the HIP RR because the HIP RR\
    \ reuses \"algorithms types\" defined\n   for the IPSECKEY RR [RFC4025].  Presently\
    \ defined values are shown\n   here for reference only:\n      0 is reserved\n\
    \      1 is DSA\n      2 is RSA\n   In the future, if a new algorithm is to be\
    \ used for the HIP RR, a new\n   algorithm type and corresponding public key encoding\
    \ should be\n   defined for the IPSECKEY RR.  The HIP RR should reuse both the\
    \ same\n   algorithm type and the same corresponding public key format as the\n\
    \   IPSECKEY RR.\n"
