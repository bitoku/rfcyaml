    Notes\n   SRI-10:   The Telnet-like protocol differs from Telnet in\n        \
    \     that lines are terminated by X'OD' rather than\n             X'ODOA'.  John\
    \ Melvin will have it fixed by\n             the time you read this.\n   LL-67:\
    \    Joel Winett telles me NCP, ICP, EBCDIC, Telnet and\n             access to\
    \ a virtual 360 are working.  Due to hard-\n             ware difficulties we\
    \ have not verified this.\n   BBN-10:   Same difference as SRI with respect to\
    \ Telnet.\n             Under certain conditions, the ICP generates a\n      \
    \       zero byte size.  Ray Tomlinson tells me these\n             idiosyncracies\
    \ will be taken care of in about\n             a week.  Three sites have commented\
    \ that TENEX\n             assigns the same local socket to multiple connec-\n\
    \             tions, when acting as a server.  Ray says that\n             this\
    \ is the design -- not an error.  BBN TENEX\n             is currently being used\
    \ productively via the\n             Net, for some non-Network related problems.\n\
    \   UTAH:     Our tests with UTAH were pre-TENEX.  TENEX is\n             currently\
    \ being installed at UTAH.\n   MIT-645:  Our understanding is that most software\
    \ is\n             working; we have not verified this.\n         [ This RFC was\
    \ put into machine readable form for entry ]\n          [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Paul Williams 6/97 ]\n"
