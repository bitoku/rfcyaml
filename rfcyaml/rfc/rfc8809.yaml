- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification establishes two registries:\n\
    \   *  the \"WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifiers\" registry\n  \
    \    (see Section 2.1)\n   *  the \"WebAuthn Extension Identifiers\" registry\
    \ (see Section 2.2)\n   Any additional processes established by the expert(s)\
    \ after the\n   publication of this document will be recorded on the registry\
    \ web\n   page at the discretion of the expert(s).\n"
