  - "1.   Overview\n   There currently is not a standard mechanism for the reporting\
    \ of mail\n   system errors except for the limited set offered by SMTP and the\n\
    \   system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages.  There is a\n   pressing\
    \ need for a rich machine readable status code for use in\n   delivery status\
    \ notifications [DSN].  This document proposes a new\n   set of status codes for\
    \ this purpose.\n   SMTP [SMTP] error codes have historically been used for reporting\n\
    \   mail system errors.  Because of limitations in the SMTP code design,\n   these\
    \ are not suitable for use in delivery status notifications.\n   SMTP provides\
    \ about 12 useful codes for delivery reports.  The\n   majority of the codes are\
    \ protocol specific response codes such as\n   the 354 response to the SMTP data\
    \ command.  Each of the 12 useful\n   codes are each overloaded to indicate several\
    \ error conditions each.\n   SMTP suffers some scars from history, most notably\
    \ the unfortunate\n   damage to the reply code extension mechanism by uncontrolled\
    \ use.\n   This proposal facilitates future extensibility by requiring the\n \
    \  client to interpret unknown error codes according to the theory of\n   codes\
    \ while requiring servers to register new response codes.\n   The SMTP theory\
    \ of reply codes partitioned in the number space such a\n   manner that the remaining\
    \ available codes will not provide the space\n   needed.  The most critical example\
    \ is the existence of only 5\n   remaining codes for mail system errors.  The\
    \ mail system\n   classification includes both host and mailbox error conditions.\
    \  The\n   remaining third digit space would be completely consumed as needed\
    \ to\n   indicate MIME and media conversion errors and security system errors.\n\
    \   A revision to the SMTP theory of reply codes to better distribute the\n  \
    \ error conditions in the number space will necessarily be incompatible\n   with\
    \ SMTP.  Further, consumption of the remaining reply-code number\n   space for\
    \ delivery notification reporting will reduce the available\n   codes for new\
    \ ESMTP extensions.\n   The following proposal is based on the SMTP theory of\
    \ reply codes.\n   It adopts the success, permanent error, and transient error\
    \ semantics\n   of the first value, with a further description and classification\
    \ in\n   the second.  This proposal re-distributes the classifications to\n  \
    \ better distribute the error conditions, such as separating mailbox\n   from\
    \ host errors.\n"
- title: 2.   Status Codes
  contents:
  - "2.   Status Codes\n   This document defines a new set of status codes to report\
    \ mail system\n   conditions.  These status codes are intended to be used for\
    \ media and\n   language independent status reporting.  They are not intended\
    \ for\n   system specific diagnostics.\n   The syntax of the new status codes\
    \ is defined as:\n          status-code = class \".\" subject \".\" detail\n \
    \         class = \"2\"/\"4\"/\"5\"\n          subject = 1*3digit\n          detail\
    \ = 1*3digit\n   White-space characters and comments are NOT allowed within a\
    \ status-\n   code.  Each numeric sub-code within the status-code MUST be expressed\n\
    \   without leading zero digits.\n   Status codes consist of three numerical fields\
    \ separated by \".\". The\n   first sub-code indicates whether the delivery attempt\
    \ was successful.\n   The second sub-code indicates the probable source of any\
    \ delivery\n   anomalies, and the third sub-code indicates a precise error\n \
    \  condition.\n   The codes space defined is intended to be extensible only by\n\
    \   standards track documents.  Mail system specific status codes should\n   be\
    \ mapped as close as possible to the standard status codes.  Servers\n   should\
    \ send only defined, registered status codes.  System specific\n   errors and\
    \ diagnostics should be carried by means other than status\n   codes.\n   New\
    \ subject and detail codes will be added over time.  Because the\n   number space\
    \ is large, it is not intended that published status codes\n   will ever be redefined\
    \ or eliminated.  Clients should preserve the\n   extensibility of the code space\
    \ by reporting the general error\n   described in the subject sub-code when the\
    \ specific detail is\n   unrecognized.\n   The class sub-code provides a broad\
    \ classification of the status.\n   The enumerated values the class are defined\
    \ as:\n    2.X.X   Success\n       Success specifies that the DSN is reporting\
    \ a positive delivery\n       action.  Detail sub-codes may provide notification\
    \ of\n       transformations required for delivery.\n    4.X.X   Persistent Transient\
    \ Failure\n       A persistent transient failure is one in which the message as\n\
    \       sent is valid, but some temporary event prevents the successful\n    \
    \   sending of the message.  Sending in the future may be successful.\n    5.X.X\
    \   Permanent Failure\n       A permanent failure is one which is not likely to\
    \ be resolved by\n       resending the message in the current form.  Some change\
    \ to the\n       message or the destination must be made for successful delivery.\n\
    \   A client must recognize and report class sub-code even where\n   subsequent\
    \ subject sub-codes are unrecognized.\n   The subject sub-code classifies the\
    \ status.  This value applies to\n   each of the three classifications.  The subject\
    \ sub-code, if\n   recognized, must be reported even if the additional detail\
    \ provided\n   by the detail sub-code is not recognized.  The enumerated values\
    \ for\n   the subject sub-code are:\n       X.0.X   Other or Undefined Status\n\
    \          There is no additional subject information available.\n       X.1.X\
    \   Addressing Status\n          The address status reports on the originator\
    \ or destination\n          address.  It may include address syntax or validity.\
    \  These\n          errors can generally be corrected by the sender and retried.\n\
    \       X.2.X   Mailbox Status\n          Mailbox status indicates that something\
    \ having to do with the\n          mailbox has cause this DSN.  Mailbox issues\
    \ are assumed to be\n          under the general control of the recipient.\n \
    \      X.3.X   Mail System Status\n          Mail system status indicates that\
    \ something having to do\n          with the destination system has caused this\
    \ DSN.  System\n          issues are assumed to be under the general control of\
    \ the\n          destination system administrator.\n       X.4.X   Network and\
    \ Routing Status\n          The networking or routing codes report status about\
    \ the\n          delivery system itself.  These system components include any\n\
    \          necessary infrastructure such as directory and routing\n          services.\
    \  Network issues are assumed to be under the\n          control of the destination\
    \ or intermediate system\n          administrator.\n       X.5.X   Mail Delivery\
    \ Protocol Status\n          The mail delivery protocol status codes report failures\n\
    \          involving the message delivery protocol.  These failures\n        \
    \  include the full range of problems resulting from\n          implementation\
    \ errors or an unreliable connection.  Mail\n          delivery protocol issues\
    \ may be controlled by many parties\n          including the originating system,\
    \ destination system, or\n          intermediate system administrators.\n    \
    \   X.6.X   Message Content or Media Status\n          The message content or\
    \ media status codes report failures\n          involving the content of the message.\
    \  These codes report\n          failures due to translation, transcoding, or\
    \ otherwise\n          unsupported message media.  Message content or media issues\n\
    \          are under the control of both the sender and the receiver,\n      \
    \    both of whom must support a common set of supported\n          content-types.\n\
    \       X.7.X   Security or Policy Status\n          The security or policy status\
    \ codes report failures\n          involving policies such as per-recipient or\
    \ per-host\n          filtering and cryptographic operations.  Security and policy\n\
    \          status issues are assumed to be under the control of either\n     \
    \     or both the sender and recipient.  Both the sender and\n          recipient\
    \ must permit the exchange of messages and arrange\n          the exchange of\
    \ necessary keys and certificates for\n          cryptographic operations.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.   Enumerated Status Codes\n   The following section defines and describes\
    \ the detail sub-code. The\n   detail value provides more information about the\
    \ status and is\n   defined relative to the subject of the status.\n   3.1 Other\
    \ or Undefined Status\n       X.0.0   Other undefined Status\n          Other\
    \ undefined status is the only undefined error code. It\n          should be used\
    \ for all errors for which only the class of the\n          error is known.\n\
    \   3.2 Address Status\n       X.1.0   Other address status\n          Something\
    \ about the address specified in the message caused\n          this DSN.\n   \
    \    X.1.1   Bad destination mailbox address\n          The mailbox specified\
    \ in the address does not exist.  For\n          Internet mail names, this means\
    \ the address portion to the\n          left of the \"@\" sign is invalid.  This\
    \ code is only useful\n          for permanent failures.\n       X.1.2   Bad destination\
    \ system address\n          The destination system specified in the address does\
    \ not\n          exist or is incapable of accepting mail.  For Internet mail\n\
    \          names, this means the address portion to the right of the\n       \
    \   \"@\" is invalid for mail.  This codes is only useful for\n          permanent\
    \ failures.\n       X.1.3   Bad destination mailbox address syntax\n         \
    \ The destination address was syntactically invalid.  This can\n          apply\
    \ to any field in the address.  This code is only useful\n          for permanent\
    \ failures.\n       X.1.4   Destination mailbox address ambiguous\n          The\
    \ mailbox address as specified matches one or more\n          recipients on the\
    \ destination system.  This may result if a\n          heuristic address mapping\
    \ algorithm is used to map the\n          specified address to a local mailbox\
    \ name.\n       X.1.5   Destination address valid\n          This mailbox address\
    \ as specified was valid.  This status\n          code should be used for positive\
    \ delivery reports.\n       X.1.6   Destination mailbox has moved, No forwarding\
    \ address\n          The mailbox address provided was at one time valid, but mail\n\
    \          is no longer being accepted for that address.  This code is\n     \
    \     only useful for permanent failures.\n       X.1.7   Bad sender's mailbox\
    \ address syntax\n          The sender's address was syntactically invalid.  This\
    \ can\n          apply to any field in the address.\n       X.1.8   Bad sender's\
    \ system address\n          The sender's system specified in the address does\
    \ not exist\n          or is incapable of accepting return mail.  For domain names,\n\
    \          this means the address portion to the right of the \"@\" is\n     \
    \     invalid for mail.\n   3.3 Mailbox Status\n       X.2.0   Other or undefined\
    \ mailbox status\n          The mailbox exists, but something about the destination\n\
    \          mailbox has caused the sending of this DSN.\n       X.2.1   Mailbox\
    \ disabled, not accepting messages\n          The mailbox exists, but is not accepting\
    \ messages.  This may\n          be a permanent error if the mailbox will never\
    \ be re-enabled\n          or a transient error if the mailbox is only temporarily\n\
    \          disabled.\n       X.2.2   Mailbox full\n          The mailbox is full\
    \ because the user has exceeded a\n          per-mailbox administrative quota\
    \ or physical capacity.  The\n          general semantics implies that the recipient\
    \ can delete\n          messages to make more space available.  This code should\
    \ be\n          used as a persistent transient failure.\n       X.2.3   Message\
    \ length exceeds administrative limit\n          A per-mailbox administrative\
    \ message length limit has been\n          exceeded.  This status code should\
    \ be used when the\n          per-mailbox message length limit is less than the\
    \ general\n          system limit.  This code should be used as a permanent\n\
    \          failure.\n       X.2.4   Mailing list expansion problem\n         \
    \ The mailbox is a mailing list address and the mailing list\n          was unable\
    \ to be expanded.  This code may represent a\n          permanent failure or a\
    \ persistent transient failure.\n   3.4 Mail system status\n       X.3.0   Other\
    \ or undefined mail system status\n          The destination system exists and\
    \ normally accepts mail, but\n          something about the system has caused\
    \ the generation of this\n          DSN.\n       X.3.1   Mail system full\n  \
    \        Mail system storage has been exceeded.  The general\n          semantics\
    \ imply that the individual recipient may not be\n          able to delete material\
    \ to make room for additional\n          messages.  This is useful only as a persistent\
    \ transient\n          error.\n       X.3.2   System not accepting network messages\n\
    \          The host on which the mailbox is resident is not accepting\n      \
    \    messages.  Examples of such conditions include an immanent\n          shutdown,\
    \ excessive load, or system maintenance.  This is\n          useful for both permanent\
    \ and permanent transient errors.\n       X.3.3   System not capable of selected\
    \ features\n          Selected features specified for the message are not\n  \
    \        supported by the destination system.  This can occur in\n          gateways\
    \ when features from one domain cannot be mapped onto\n          the supported\
    \ feature in another.\n       X.3.4   Message too big for system\n          The\
    \ message is larger than per-message size limit.  This\n          limit may either\
    \ be for physical or administrative reasons.\n          This is useful only as\
    \ a permanent error.\n       X.3.5 System incorrectly configured\n          The\
    \ system is not configured in a manner which will permit\n          it to accept\
    \ this message.\n   3.5 Network and Routing Status\n       X.4.0   Other or undefined\
    \ network or routing status\n          Something went wrong with the networking,\
    \ but it is not\n          clear what the problem is, or the problem cannot be\
    \ well\n          expressed with any of the other provided detail codes.\n   \
    \    X.4.1   No answer from host\n          The outbound connection attempt was\
    \ not answered, either\n          because the remote system was busy, or otherwise\
    \ unable to\n          take a call.  This is useful only as a persistent transient\n\
    \          error.\n       X.4.2   Bad connection\n          The outbound connection\
    \ was established, but was otherwise\n          unable to complete the message\
    \ transaction, either because\n          of time-out, or inadequate connection\
    \ quality. This is\n          useful only as a persistent transient error.\n \
    \      X.4.3   Directory server failure\n          The network system was unable\
    \ to forward the message,\n          because a directory server was unavailable.\
    \  This is useful\n          only as a persistent transient error.\n         \
    \ The inability to connect to an Internet DNS server is one\n          example\
    \ of the directory server failure error.\n       X.4.4   Unable to route\n   \
    \       The mail system was unable to determine the next hop for the\n       \
    \   message because the necessary routing information was\n          unavailable\
    \ from the directory server. This is useful for\n          both permanent and\
    \ persistent transient errors.\n          A DNS lookup returning only an SOA (Start\
    \ of Administration)\n          record for a domain name is one example of the\
    \ unable to\n          route error.\n       X.4.5   Mail system congestion\n \
    \         The mail system was unable to deliver the message because\n        \
    \  the mail system was congested. This is useful only as a\n          persistent\
    \ transient error.\n       X.4.6   Routing loop detected\n          A routing\
    \ loop caused the message to be forwarded too many\n          times, either because\
    \ of incorrect routing tables or a user\n          forwarding loop. This is useful\
    \ only as a persistent\n          transient error.\n       X.4.7   Delivery time\
    \ expired\n          The message was considered too old by the rejecting system,\n\
    \          either because it remained on that host too long or because\n     \
    \     the time-to-live value specified by the sender of the\n          message\
    \ was exceeded. If possible, the code for the actual\n          problem found\
    \ when delivery was attempted should be returned\n          rather than this code.\
    \  This is useful only as a persistent\n          transient error.\n   3.6 Mail\
    \ Delivery Protocol Status\n       X.5.0   Other or undefined protocol status\n\
    \          Something was wrong with the protocol necessary to deliver\n      \
    \    the message to the next hop and the problem cannot be well\n          expressed\
    \ with any of the other provided detail codes.\n       X.5.1   Invalid command\n\
    \          A mail transaction protocol command was issued which was\n        \
    \  either out of sequence or unsupported.  This is useful only\n          as a\
    \ permanent error.\n       X.5.2   Syntax error\n          A mail transaction\
    \ protocol command was issued which could\n          not be interpreted, either\
    \ because the syntax was wrong or\n          the command is unrecognized. This\
    \ is useful only as a\n          permanent error.\n       X.5.3   Too many recipients\n\
    \          More recipients were specified for the message than could\n       \
    \   have been delivered by the protocol.  This error should\n          normally\
    \ result in the segmentation of the message into two,\n          the remainder\
    \ of the recipients to be delivered on a\n          subsequent delivery attempt.\
    \  It is included in this list in\n          the event that such segmentation\
    \ is not possible.\n       X.5.4   Invalid command arguments\n          A valid\
    \ mail transaction protocol command was issued with\n          invalid arguments,\
    \ either because the arguments were out of\n          range or represented unrecognized\
    \ features. This is useful\n          only as a permanent error.\n       X.5.5\
    \   Wrong protocol version\n          A protocol version mis-match existed which\
    \ could not be\n          automatically resolved by the communicating parties.\n\
    \   3.7 Message Content or Message Media Status\n       X.6.0   Other or undefined\
    \ media error\n          Something about the content of a message caused it to\
    \ be\n          considered undeliverable and the problem cannot be well\n    \
    \      expressed with any of the other provided detail codes.\n       X.6.1  \
    \ Media not supported\n          The media of the message is not supported by\
    \ either the\n          delivery protocol or the next system in the forwarding\
    \ path.\n          This is useful only as a permanent error.\n       X.6.2   Conversion\
    \ required and prohibited\n          The content of the message must be converted\
    \ before it can\n          be delivered and such conversion is not permitted.\
    \  Such\n          prohibitions may be the expression of the sender in the\n \
    \         message itself or the policy of the sending host.\n       X.6.3   Conversion\
    \ required but not supported\n          The message content must be converted\
    \ to be forwarded but\n          such conversion is not possible or is not practical\
    \ by a\n          host in the forwarding path.  This condition may result when\n\
    \          an ESMTP gateway supports 8bit transport but is not able to\n     \
    \     downgrade the message to 7 bit as required for the next hop.\n       X.6.4\
    \   Conversion with loss performed\n          This is a warning sent to the sender\
    \ when message delivery\n          was successfully but when the delivery required\
    \ a conversion\n          in which some data was lost.  This may also be a permanant\n\
    \          error if the sender has indicated that conversion with loss\n     \
    \     is prohibited for the message.\n       X.6.5   Conversion Failed\n     \
    \     A conversion was required but was unsuccessful.  This may be\n         \
    \ useful as a permanent or persistent temporary notification.\n   3.8 Security\
    \ or Policy Status\n       X.7.0   Other or undefined security status\n      \
    \    Something related to security caused the message to be\n          returned,\
    \ and the problem cannot be well expressed with any\n          of the other provided\
    \ detail codes.  This status code may\n          also be used when the condition\
    \ cannot be further described\n          because of security policies in force.\n\
    \       X.7.1   Delivery not authorized, message refused\n          The sender\
    \ is not authorized to send to the destination.\n          This can be the result\
    \ of per-host or per-recipient\n          filtering.  This memo does not discuss\
    \ the merits of any\n          such filtering, but provides a mechanism to report\
    \ such.\n          This is useful only as a permanent error.\n       X.7.2   Mailing\
    \ list expansion prohibited\n          The sender is not authorized to send a\
    \ message to the\n          intended mailing list. This is useful only as a permanent\n\
    \          error.\n       X.7.3   Security conversion required but not possible\n\
    \          A conversion from one secure messaging protocol to another\n      \
    \    was required for delivery and such conversion was not\n          possible.\
    \ This is useful only as a permanent error.\n       X.7.4   Security features\
    \ not supported\n          A message contained security features such as secure\n\
    \          authentication which could not be supported on the delivery\n     \
    \     protocol. This is useful only as a permanent error.\n       X.7.5   Cryptographic\
    \ failure\n          A transport system otherwise authorized to validate or\n\
    \          decrypt a message in transport was unable to do so because\n      \
    \    necessary information such as key was not available or such\n          information\
    \ was invalid.\n       X.7.6   Cryptographic algorithm not supported\n       \
    \   A transport system otherwise authorized to validate or\n          decrypt\
    \ a message was unable to do so because the necessary\n          algorithm was\
    \ not supported.\n       X.7.7   Message integrity failure\n          A transport\
    \ system otherwise authorized to validate a\n          message was unable to do\
    \ so because the message was\n          corrupted or altered.  This may be useful\
    \ as a permanent,\n          transient persistent, or successful delivery code.\n"
