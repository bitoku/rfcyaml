  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5485 [IDSIG] specifies the conventions for digital signatures\
    \ on\n   Internet-Drafts.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS] is\n \
    \  used to create a detached signature, which is stored in a separate\n   companion\
    \ file so that no existing utilities are impacted by the\n   addition of the digital\
    \ signature.\n   The RFC Editor recently published the first RFC that includes\
    \ non-\n   ASCII characters in a text file.  The conventions specified in RFC\n\
    \   7997 [RFCED] were followed.  We assume that non-ASCII characters will\n  \
    \ soon start appearing in Internet-Drafts as well.  This document\n   updates\
    \ the handling of digital signatures on Internet-Drafts that\n   contain non-ASCII\
    \ characters in a text file.\n   This document updates RFC 5485 [IDSIG], which\
    \ contains the\n   conventions that have been used by the IETF Secretariat to\
    \ digitally\n   sign Internet-Drafts for the past few years.  The IETF Secretariat\n\
    \   generates the digital signature shortly after the Internet-Draft is\n   posted\
    \ in the repository.\n   The digital signature allows anyone to confirm that the\
    \ contents of\n   the Internet-Draft have not been altered since the time that\
    \ the\n   document was signed.\n   The digital signature is intended to provide\
    \ a straightforward way\n   for anyone to determine whether a particular file\
    \ contains the\n   Internet-Draft that was made available by the IETF Secretariat.\
    \  The\n   signing-time associated with the signature provides the wall clock\n\
    \   time at which the signature was generated; it is not intended to\n   provide\
    \ a trusted timestamp.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\
    \ RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [STDWORDS] [STDWORDS2] when, and only when, they\
    \ appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 1.2.  ASN.1
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ASN.1\n   The CMS uses Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680].  ASN.1\
    \ is\n   a formal notation used for describing data protocols, regardless of\n\
    \   the programming language used by the implementation.  Encoding rules\n   describe\
    \ how the values defined in ASN.1 will be represented for\n   transmission.  The\
    \ Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [X.690] are the most\n   widely employed rule set,\
    \ but they offer more than one way to\n   represent data structures.  For example,\
    \ definite length encoding and\n   indefinite length encoding are supported. \
    \ This flexibility is not\n   desirable when digital signatures are used.  As\
    \ a result, the\n   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] were invented.\
    \  DER is a\n   subset of BER that ensures a single way to represent a given value.\n\
    \   For example, DER always employs definite length encoding.\n"
- title: 2.  Detached Signature Files
  contents:
  - "2.  Detached Signature Files\n   All Internet-Draft file names begin with \"\
    draft-\".  The next portion\n   of the file name depends on the source of the\
    \ document.  For example,\n   documents from IETF working groups usually have\
    \ \"ietf-\" followed by\n   the working group abbreviation, and this is followed\
    \ by a string that\n   helps people figure out the subject of the document.\n\
    \   All Internet-Draft file names end with a hyphen followed by a two\n   digit\
    \ version number and a suffix.  The suffix indicates the type of\n   file.  For\
    \ example, a text file will have a suffix of \".txt\".  Today,\n   plain text\
    \ files are the most common, but the RFC Editor has\n   announced plans to make\
    \ use of other formats [RFCSERIES].  Each file\n   format employs a different\
    \ suffix.\n   Going forward, one cannot assume that a text file with a suffix\
    \ of\n   \".txt\" will contain only ASCII characters.\n   The companion signature\
    \ file has exactly the same file name as the\n   RFC or Internet-Draft, except\
    \ that \".p7s\" is added to the end.  This\n   file name suffix conforms to the\
    \ conventions in RFC 5751 [MSG].  Here\n   are a few example names:\n      Internet-Draft:\
    \ draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.txt\n      Signature File: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.txt.p7s\n\
    \      Internet-Draft: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.pdf\n      Signature File:\
    \ draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.pdf.p7s\n      Internet-Draft: draft-housley-internet-draft-sig-file-00.txt\n\
    \      Signature File: draft-housley-internet-draft-sig-file-00.txt.p7s\n"
- title: 3.  Additional Content Types
  contents:
  - "3.  Additional Content Types\n   The CMS is used to construct the detached signatures\
    \ for Internet-\n   Drafts.  The CMS ContentInfo content type MUST always be present,\
    \ and\n   it MUST encapsulate the CMS SignedData content type.  Since a\n   detached\
    \ signature is being created, the CMS SignedData content type\n   MUST NOT encapsulate\
    \ the Internet-Draft.  The CMS detached signature\n   is summarized in RFC 5485\
    \ [IDSIG].\n   The SignedData.SignerInfo.EncapsulatedContentInfo.eContentType\
    \ value\n   MUST identify the format of the Internet-Draft that is being signed.\n\
    \   Section 5 of RFC 5485 [IDSIG] lists the file formats and the\n   associated\
    \ content type.  This document expands that list as follows:\n      File Format\

- title: 4.  Need for Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "4.  Need for Canonicalization\n   In general, the content of an Internet-Draft\
    \ is treated like a single\n   octet string for the generation of the digital\
    \ signature.\n   Unfortunately, the text and HTML files require canonicalization\
    \ to\n   avoid signature validation problems.  The primary concern is the\n  \
    \ manner in which different operating systems indicate the end of a\n   line of\
    \ text.  Some systems use a single new-line character, other\n   systems use the\
    \ combination of the carriage-return character followed\n   by a line-feed character,\
    \ and other systems use fixed-length records\n   padded with space characters.\
    \  For the digital signature to validate\n   properly, a single convention must\
    \ be employed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  ASCII, UTF-8, and HTML File Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "4.1.  ASCII, UTF-8, and HTML File Canonicalization\n   The canonicalization procedure\
    \ follows the conventions used for text\n   files in the File Transfer Protocol\
    \ (FTP) [FTP].  Such files must be\n   supported by FTP implementations, so code\
    \ reuse seems likely.\n   The canonicalization procedure converts the data from\
    \ its internal\n   character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII\n\
    \   representation (see TELNET [TELNET]).  In accordance with the NVT\n   standard,\
    \ the <CRLF> sequence MUST be used to denote the end of a\n   line of text.  Using\
    \ the standard NVT-ASCII representation means that\n   data MUST be interpreted\
    \ as 8-bit bytes.\n   Trailing space characters MUST NOT appear on a line of text.\
    \  That\n   is, the space character must not be followed by the <CRLF> sequence.\n\
    \   Thus, a blank line is represented solely by the <CRLF> sequence.\n   The form-feed\
    \ nonprintable character (0x0C) is expected in Internet-\n   Drafts.  Other non-printable\
    \ characters, such as tab and backspace,\n   are not expected, but they do occur.\
    \  Non-printable or non-ASCII\n   characters (ones outside the range 0x20 to 0x7E)\
    \ MUST NOT be changed\n   in any way not covered by the rules for end-of-line\
    \ handling in the\n   previous paragraph.\n   Trailing blank lines MUST NOT appear\
    \ at the end of the file.  That\n   is, the file must not end with multiple consecutive\
    \ <CRLF> sequences.\n   In some environments, a Byte Order Mark (BOM) (U+FEFF)\
    \ is used at the\n   beginning of a file to indicate that it contains non-ASCII\n\
    \   characters.  In UTF-8 or HTML files, a BOM at the beginning of the\n   file\
    \ is not considered to be part of the file content.  One or more\n   consecutive\
    \ leading BOMs, if present, MUST NOT be processed by the\n   digital signature\
    \ algorithm.\n   Any end-of-file marker used by an operating system is not considered\n\
    \   to be part of the file content.  When present, such end-of-file\n   markers\
    \ MUST NOT be processed by the digital signature algorithm.\n   Note: This text\
    \ file canonicalization procedure is consistent with\n   the NVT-ASCII definition\
    \ offered in Appendix B of RFC 5198 [UFNI].\n"
- title: 4.2.  XML File Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "4.2.  XML File Canonicalization\n   Utilities that produce XML files are expected\
    \ to follow the guidance\n   provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in\
    \ Section 2.11 of\n   [R20081126].  If this guidance is followed, no canonicalization\
    \ is\n   needed.\n   A robust signature generation process MAY perform canonicalization\
    \ to\n   ensure that the W3C guidance has been followed.  This guidance says\n\
    \   that a <LF> character MUST be used to denote the end of a line of\n   text\
    \ within an XML file.  Therefore, any two-character <CRLF>\n   sequence and any\
    \ <CR> that is not followed by <LF> are to be\n   translated to a single <LF>\
    \ character.\n"
- title: 4.3.  No Canonicalization of Other File Formats
  contents:
  - "4.3.  No Canonicalization of Other File Formats\n   No canonicalization is needed\
    \ for file formats currently used or\n   planned for Internet-Drafts other than\
    \ ASCII, UTF-8, HTML, and XML\n   files.  Other file formats, including PDF [PDF],\
    \ PostScript [PS], and\n   EPUB [EPUB] are treated as a simple sequence of octets\
