  - "Introduction\n   Address space exhaustion is one of the most serious and immediate\n\
    \   problems that the Internet faces today [1,2].  The current Internet\n   address\
    \ space is 32-bit.  Each Internet address is divided into two\n   parts: a network\
    \ portion and a host portion.  This division\n   corresponds the three primary\
    \ Internet address classes: Class A,\n   Class B and Class C.  Table 1 lists the\
    \ network number statistics as\n   of April 1992.\n                      Total\
    \       Allocated     Allocated (%)\n   Class A              126            48\
    \            54%\n   Class B            16383          7006            43%\n \
    \  Class C          2097151         40724             2%\n          Table 1: Network\
    \ Number Statistics (April 1992)\n   If recent trends of exponential growth continue,\
    \ the network numbers\n   in Class B will soon run out [1,2].  There are over\
    \ 2 million Class C\n   network numbers and only 2% have been allocated.  However,\
    \ a Class C\n   network number can only accommodate 254 host numbers which is\
    \ too\n   small for most networks.  With the rapid expansion of the Internet\n\
    \   and drastic increase in personal computers, the time when the 32-bit\n   address\
    \ space is exhausted altogether is also not too distant [1-3].\n   Recently several\
    \ proposals have been put forward to deal with the\n   immediate problem [1-4].\
    \  The Supernetting and C-sharp schemes\n   attempt to make the Class C numbers\
    \ more usable by re-defining the\n   way in which Class C network numbers are\
    \ classified and assigned\n   [3,4].  Both schemes require modifications to the\
    \ exterior routing\n   algorithms and global coordination across the Internet\
    \ may be\n   required for the deployment.  The two schemes do not expand the total\n\
    \   number of addresses available to the Internet and therefore can only\n   be\
    \ used as a short-term fix for next two or three years.  Schemes\n   have also\
    \ been put forwarded in which the 32-bit address field is\n   replaced with a\
    \ field of the same size but with different meaning and\n   the gateways on the\
    \ boundary re-write the address when the packet\n   crossed the boundary [1,2,5].\
    \  Such schemes, however, requires\n   substantial changes to the gateways and\
    \ the exterior routing\n   algorithm.\n   In this paper, we present an alternative\
    \ solution to the problem of\n   address space exhaustion.  The \"Dual Network\
    \ Addressing (DNA)\" scheme\n   proposed here is based on a two-tier address structure\
    \ and sharing of\n   addresses.  It requires no modifications to the exterior\
    \ routing\n   algorithms and any networks can adopt the scheme individually at\
    \ any\n   time without affecting other networks.\n"
- title: The Scheme
  contents:
  - "The Scheme\n   The DNA scheme attempts to reduce the waste in using the Internet\n\
    \   addresses.  A useful analogy to our scheme is the extension system\n   used\
    \ in the telephone system.  Many large organizations usually have\n   extensive\
    \ private telephone networks for internal use and at the mean\n   time hire a\
    \ limited number of external lines for communications with\n   the outside world.\
    \  In such a telephone system, important offices may\n   have direct external\
    \ lines and telephones in the public areas may be\n   restricted to internal calls\
    \ only.  The majority of the telephones\n   can usually make both internal calls\
    \ and external calls.  But they\n   must share a limited number of external lines.\
    \  When an external call\n   is being made, a pre-defined digit has to be pressed\
    \ so that an\n   external line can be allocated from the poll of external lines.\n\
    \   In the DNA scheme, there are two types of Internet addresses:\n   Internal\
    \ addresses and External addresses.  An internal address is an\n   Internet address\
    \ only used within one network and is unique only\n   within that network.  An\
    \ interface with an internal address can only\n   communicate with another interface\
    \ with an internal address in the\n   same network.  An external address is unique\
    \ in the entire Internet\n   and an interface with an external address can communicate\
    \ directly to\n   another interface with an external address over the Internet.\
    \  All\n   current Internet addresses are external addresses.\n   In effect, the\
    \ external addresses form one global Internet and the\n   internal addresses form\
    \ many private Internets.  Within one network,\n   the external addresses are\
    \ only used for inter-network communications\n   and internal addresses for intra-network\
    \ communications.  An External\n   Address Sharing Service (EASS) is needed to\
    \ manage the sharing of\n   external addresses.  An EASS server reserves a number\
    \ of external\n   addresses.  When a machine that only has an internal address\
    \ wants to\n   communicate a machine with an external address in other networks,\
    \ it\n   can send a request to an EASS server to obtain a temporary external\n\
    \   address.  After the use, the machine can return the external address\n   to\
    \ the EASS server.\n   We believe that, with the DNA scheme, a network can operate\
    \ with a\n   limited number of external addresses.  The reasons are as follows:\n\
    \   *  In most networks, the majority of the traffic is confined to\n      its\
    \ local area networks.  This is due the nature of\n      networking applications\
    \ and the bandwidth constraints on\n      inter-network links.\n   *  The number\
    \ of machines which act as Internet servers, i.e.,\n      running programs waiting\
    \ to be called by machines in other\n      networks, is often limited and certainly\
    \ much smaller than\n      the total number of machines.  These machines include\
    \ mail\n      servers, domain name servers, ftp archive servers, directory\n \
    \     servers, etc.\n   *  There are an increasingly large number of personal\
    \ machines\n      entering the Internet.  The use of these machines is\n     \
    \ primarily limited to their local environment.  They may also\n      be used\
    \ as \"clients\" such as ftp and telnet to access other\n      machines.\n   *\
    \  For security reasons, many large organizations, such as banks,\n      government\
    \ departments, military institution and some\n      companies, may only allow\
    \ a very limited number of their\n      machines to have access to the global\
    \ Internet.  The majority\n      of their machines are purely for internal use.\n\
    \   In the DNA scheme, all machines in a network are assigned a permanent\n  \
    \ internal address and can communicate with any machines within the\n   same network.\
    \  The allocation of external addresses depends on the\n   functions of the machines\
    \ and as a result it creates three-level\n   privileges:\n   *  machines which\
    \ act as servers or used as central computing\n      infrastructure are likely\
    \ to have frequent communications\n      with other networks therefore they may\
    \ require external\n      addresses all the time.  These machines are allocated\n\
    \      permanent external addresses.\n   *  machines which are not allowed to\
    \ communicate with other\n      networks have no external addresses and can only\
    \ communicate\n      with machines within their own network.\n   *  the rest of\
    \ the machines share a number of external\n      addresses. The external addresses\
    \ are allocated by\n      the EASS server on request.  These machines can only\n\
    \      used as clients to call machines in other networks,\n      i.e., they can\
    \ not be called by machines in other networks.\n   A network can choose any network\
    \ number other than its external\n   network number as its internal network number.\
    \  Different networks\n   can use the same network number as their internal number.\
    \  We propose\n   to reserve one Class A network number as the well-known network\n\
    \   number for internal use.\n"
- title: The Advantages
  contents:
  - "The Advantages\n   The DNA scheme attempts to tackle the problem from the bottom\
    \ of the\n   Internet, i.e., each individual network, while other schemes\n  \
    \ described in the first section deal with the problem from the top of\n   the\
    \ Internet, i.e., gateways and exterior routing algorithms.  These\n   schemes,\
    \ however, do not need to be consider as mutually exclusive.\n   The DNA scheme\
    \ has several advantages:\n   *  The DNA scheme takes an evolutionary approach\
    \ towards the\n      changes.  Different networks can individually choose to\n\
    \      adopt the scheme at any time only when necessary.\n      There is no need\
    \ for global coordination between different\n      networks for their deployment.\
    \  The effects of the deployment\n      are confined to the network in which the\
    \ scheme is being\n      implemented, and are invisible to exterior routing\n\
    \      algorithms and external networks.\n   *  With the DNA scheme, it is possible\
    \ for a medium size organization\n      to use a Class C network number with 254\
    \ external addresses.\n      The scheme allows the current Internet to expand\
    \ to over 2 million\n      networks and each network to have more than 16 million\
    \ hosts.\n      This will allow considerable time for a long-term solution to\n\
    \      be developed and fully tested.\n   *  The DNA scheme requires modifications\
    \ to the host software.\n      However, the modifications are needed only in those\
    \ networks\n      which adopt the DNA scheme.   Since all existing Class A and\
    \ B\n      networks usually have sufficient external addresses for all their\n\
    \      machines, they do not need to adopt the DNA scheme, and therefore\n   \
    \   need no modifications at all to their software.  The networks\n      which\
    \ need to use the DNA scheme are those new networks which are\n      set up after\
    \ the Class A and B numbers run out and have to\n      use a Class C number.\n\
    \   *  The DNA scheme makes it possible to develop to a new addressing\n     \
    \ scheme without expanding the 32-bit address length to 64-bit.\n      With the\
    \ two-tier address structure, the current 32-bit space\n      can accommodate\
    \ over 4 billion hosts in the global Internet and\n      100 million hosts in\
    \ each individual network.  When we move to a\n      classless multi-hierarchic\
    \ addressing scheme, the use of external\n      addresses can be more efficient\
    \ and less wasteful and the\n      32-bit space can be adequate for the external\
    \ addresses.\n   *  When a new addressing scheme has been developed, all current\n\
    \      Internet addresses have to be changed.  The DNA scheme will make\n    \
    \  such a undertaking much easier and smoother, since only the\n      EASS servers\
    \ and those have permanent external addresses will\n      be affected, and communications\
    \ within the network will not\n      be interrupted.\n"
- title: The Modifications
  contents:
  - "The Modifications\n   The major modifications to the host software is in the\
    \ network\n   interface code.  The DNA scheme requires each machine to have at\n\
    \   least two addresses.  But most of the host software currently does\n   not\
    \ allow us to bind two addresses to one physical interface.  This\n   problem\
    \ can be solved by using two network interfaces on each\n   machine.  But this\
    \ option is too expensive.  Note the two interfaces\n   are actually connected\
    \ to the same physical network.  Therefore, if\n   we modify the interface code\
    \ to allow two logical interfaces to be\n   mapped onto one single physical interface,\
    \ the machine can then use\n   both the external address and the internal address\
    \ with one physical\n   interface as if it has two physical interfaces.  In effect,\
    \ two\n   logical IP networks operate over the same physical network.\n   The\
    \ DNA scheme also has implications to the DNS service.  Many\n   machines will\
    \ have two entries in the local name server.  The DNS\n   server must examine\
    \ the source address of the request and decide\n   which entry to use.  If the\
    \ source address matches the well-known\n   internal network number, it passes\
    \ the internal address of the domain\n   name.  Otherwise, the name server passes\
    \ the external address.\n   An EASS server is required to manage the sharing of\
    \ the external\n   addresses, i.e., to allocate and de-allocate external addresses\
    \ to\n   the machines which do not have permanent external addresses.  This\n\
    \   service can be provided by using the \"Dynamic Host Configuration\n   Protocol\
    \ (DHCP)\" [6].\n   Many hosts do an inverse lookup of incoming connections. \
    \ Therefore,\n   it is desirable the entry in the DNS server be updated whenever\
    \ a new\n   external address is allocated.  This will also allow an machine which\n\
    \   currently has a temporary external address to be called by other\n   machines.\
    \  The updating of the entry in the DNS server can be done\n   more easily if\
    \ the EASS server and DNS server are co-located.\n"
