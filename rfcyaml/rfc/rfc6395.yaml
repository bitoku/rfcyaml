  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a new option for use in PIM Hello
    messages\n   [RFC4601] to carry an Interface Identifier.  A router generates\n
    \  identifiers for each of its PIM-enabled interfaces such that each\n   interface
    has a different identifier.  The identifiers can optionally\n   be generated such
    that they are unique within, e.g., an\n   administrative domain.\n   An example
    where this Interface Identifier can be used is with PIM\n   over Reliable Transport
    (PORT) [PIM-PORT], where a single Transport\n   connection is used between two
    routers that have multiple interfaces\n   connecting them.  If these interfaces
    have unnumbered or IPv6 link-\n   local addresses, the Interface Identifier included
    in the PORT Join/\n   Prune message will identify with which interface the message
    is\n   associated.  For PORT, the Router Identifier is not needed, and it\n   can
    be set to zero.\n   All multi-byte integers in this specification are transmitted
    in\n   network byte order (i.e., most significant byte first).\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Interface Identifier Option\n   The Interface Identifier option is used to
    identify the interface of\n   a neighboring router through which a PIM Hello [RFC4601]
    was sent.\n   This allows PIM protocols to refer to, or identify, a particular\n
    \  interface on a neighboring router.\n   The Interface Identifier option need
    only be included in PIM Hello\n   messages if the router supports protocols that
    require it.  An\n   implementation MAY choose to always include it.  The usage
    of the\n   Interface Identifier and the uniqueness requirements are left to the\n
    \  specifications of the PIM protocols that implement it.  It is assumed\n   that
    different protocols have different minimum requirements for\n   stability and
    uniqueness of the Interface Identifier but that they\n   have no maximum requirement.
    \ When specified, these protocols should\n   indicate what their minimum requirements
    are.\n   The Interface Identifier consists of 64 bits.  The lower 32 bits form\n
    \  a Local Interface Identifier, and the high 32 bits form a Router\n   Identifier.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Local Interface Identifier\n   The 32-bit Local Interface Identifier
      is selected such that it is\n   unique among the router's PIM-enabled interfaces.
      \ That is, there\n   MUST NOT be two PIM interfaces with the same Local Interface\n
      \  Identifier.  While an interface is up, the Identifier MUST always be\n   the
      same once it has been allocated.  If an interface goes down and\n   comes up,
      the router SHOULD use the same Identifier.  If a node goes\n   down and comes
      up again, the Identifier for each interface MAY\n   change.  Many systems make
      use of an ifIndex [RFC2863] as a Local\n   Interface Identifier.\n   The Local
      Interface Identifier MUST be non-zero.  The reason for this\n   is that some
      protocols may have messages that optionally reference an\n   Interface Identifier,
      and they may use the value of 0 to show that no\n   Interface Identifier is
      being referenced.  Note that the value of 0\n   is not a valid ifIndex as defined
      in [RFC2863].\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Router Identifier\n   The 32-bit Router Identifier may be used to uniquely
      identify the\n   router.  The requirements for the scope in which the Router\n
      \  Identifier needs to be unique depend on the protocols that utilize\n   it.
      \ It may need to be unique within some administrative domain, or\n   it may
      possibly be globally unique.\n   A router implementation selects a Router Identifier
      according to a\n   configured policy that defines the uniqueness scope.  Thus,
      an\n   implementation MAY be configured to choose an IPv4 unicast address\n
      \  assigned to the router as the Router Identifier, but the\n   implementation
      MUST allow the identifier to be configured manually.\n   Protocols such as BGP
      [RFC4271] and OSPFv2 [RFC2328] are other\n   protocols that make use of 32-bit
      identifiers for routers.  Provided\n   that the stability and uniqueness requirements
      of the protocols that\n   make use of the Router Identifier are met, an implementation
      MAY use\n   the same identifier used by other protocols.\n   The value 0 has
      a special meaning for the Router Identifier.  It\n   means that no Router Identifier
      is used.  If a router only supports\n   protocols that require the Interface
      Identifier to be unique for one\n   router (only making use of the Local Interface
      Identifier), then the\n   implementation MAY set the Router Identifier to zero.\n"
