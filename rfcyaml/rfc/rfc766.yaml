  - "                       Internet Protocol Handbook\nIn recent years the ARPA Network\
    \ Research Program has had as one concern\nthe interconnection of networks.  In\
    \ the course of this research a\nfamily of protocols suitable for an internetwork\
    \ environment has\nemerged.  Much of this work is documented in a series of project\
    \ memos\ncalled Internet Experiment Notes or IENs.  A few of these IENs document\n\
    protocols in the internet protocol family.  Most of the major internet\nprotocol\
    \ documents have also been issued as RFCs.\nThe situation has evolved to the point\
    \ that it is appropriate for the\ninternet family of protocols to replace the\
    \ old ARPANET protocols.  To\nthis end an Internet Protocol Handbook will be prepared\
    \ by the Network\nInformation Center.  This Handbook is tentatively planned to\
    \ be\navailable at the end of 1980.  This Internet Protocol Handbook will\nclosely\
    \ parallel the old ARPANET Protocol Handbook, and will primarily\nbe a collection\
    \ of existing RFCs and IENs.\nAttached is the current draft table of contents\
    \ for the Internet\nProtocol Handbook.  Any suggestions for additions should be\
    \ sent to Jon\nPostel (Postel@ISIF).\nthe Network Information Center online Library\

    \ IENs have pathnames\nof the form \"<NETINFO>IEN-nnn.TXT\", and the RFCs have\
    \ pathnames of the\nform \"<NETINFO>RFCnnn.TXT\", where \"nnn\" is replaced by\
