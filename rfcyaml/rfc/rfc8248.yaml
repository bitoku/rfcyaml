  - "1.  Introduction\n   Today's environment of rapidly evolving security threats\
    \ highlights\n   the need to automate the sharing of security information (such\
    \ as\n   posture information) while protecting user information and the\n   systems\
    \ that store, process, and transmit this information.  Security\n   threats can\
    \ be detected in a number of ways.  The Security Automation\n   and Continuous\
    \ Monitoring (SACM) charter focuses on how to collect\n   and share this information\
    \ based on use cases that involve posture\n   assessment of endpoints.\n   Scalable\
    \ and sustainable collection, expression, and evaluation of\n   endpoint information\
    \ is foundational to SACM's objectives.  To secure\n   and defend a network, one\
    \ must reliably determine what devices are on\n   the network, how those devices\
    \ are configured from a hardware\n   perspective, what software products are installed\
    \ on those devices,\n   and how those products are configured.  We need to be\
    \ able to\n   determine, share, and use this information in a secure, timely,\n\
    \   consistent, and automated manner to perform endpoint posture\n   assessments.\n\
    \   This document focuses on describing the requirements for facilitating\n  \
    \ the exchange of posture assessment information in the enterprise, in\n   particular,\
    \ for the use cases as exemplified in [RFC7632].\n   As proposals are evaluated\
    \ for SACM standardization, the documents\n   describing each proposal are expected\
    \ to include a section that\n   describes how the enumerated requirements are\
    \ addressed.\n   This document uses terminology defined in [TERMS].\n"

- title: 2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements\n   This document defines requirements based on the SACM use\
    \ cases\n   described in [RFC7632].  This section describes the requirements used\n\
    \   by SACM to assess and compare candidate data models, interfaces, and\n   protocols.\
    \  These requirements express characteristics or features\n   that a candidate\
    \ protocol, information model, or data model must be\n   capable of offering to\
    \ ensure security and interoperability.\n   Multiple data models, protocols, and\
    \ transfers may be employed in a\n   SACM environment.  A SACM transfer protocol\
    \ is one that runs on top\n   of transport-layer protocols such as TCP/IP or internet-layer\n\
    \   protocols such as HTTP, carries operations (requests/responses), and\n   moves\
    \ data.\n   SACM will define an architecture and information model focused on\n\
    \   addressing the needs for determining, sharing, and using posture\n   information\
    \ securely via posture information providers and posture\n   information consumers.\
    \  With the information model defining assets\n   and attributes to facilitate\
    \ the guidance, collection, and assessment\n   of posture, tasks that should be\
    \ considered include:\n   1.  Asset Classification: Map the target endpoint and/or\
    \ the assets\n       on the target endpoints to asset classes.  This enables\n\
    \       identification of the attributes needed to exchange information\n    \
    \   pertaining to the target endpoint.\n   2.  Attribute Definition: Define the\
    \ attributes desired to be\n       collected from each target endpoint.  For instance,\
    \ organizations\n       will want to know what software is installed and its critical\n\
    \       security attributes such as patch level.\n   3.  Policy Definition: This\
    \ is where an organization can express its\n       policy for acceptable or problematic\
    \ values of an endpoint\n       attribute.  The expected values of an endpoint\
    \ attribute are\n       determined for later comparison against the actual endpoint\n\
    \       attribute values during the evaluation process.  Expected values\n   \
    \    may include both values that are good as well as values that\n       represent\
    \ problems, such as vulnerabilities.  The organization\n       can also specify\
    \ the endpoint attributes that are to be present\n       for a given target endpoint.\n\
    \   4.  Information Collection: Collect information (attribute values)\n     \
    \  from the target endpoint to populate the endpoint data.\n   5.  Endpoint Assessment:\
    \ Evaluate the actual values of the endpoint\n       attributes against those\
    \ expressed in the policy.  (An evaluation\n       result may become additional\
    \ endpoint data.)\n   6.  Result Reporting: Report the results of the evaluation\
    \ for use by\n       other components.  Examples of the use of a report would\
    \ be\n       additional evaluation, network enforcement, vulnerability\n     \
    \  detection, and license management.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Requirements for SACM
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Requirements for SACM\n   Many deployment scenarios can be instantiated\
    \ to address the above\n   tasks and the use cases defined in [RFC7632].  To ensure\n\
    \   interoperability, scalability, and flexibility in any of these\n   deployments,\
    \ the following requirements are defined for proposed SACM\n   standards:\n  \
    \ G-001 (Solution Extensibility):  The information model, data models,\n    protocols,\
    \ and transfers defined by SACM MUST be designed to allow\n    support for future\
    \ extensions.  SACM MUST allow for both\n    standardized and proprietary extensions.\n\
    \    1.  The information model and programmatic interfaces (see G-012 for\n  \
    \      one example) MUST support the ability to add new operations\n        while\
    \ maintaining backwards compatibility.  SACM-defined\n        transfer protocols\
    \ MUST have extensibility to allow them to\n        transfer operations that are\
    \ defined in the future.\n    2.  The query language MUST allow for general inquiries\
    \ as well as\n        expression of specific attributes or relationships between\n\
    \        attributes; the retrieval of specific information based on an\n     \
    \   event or on a continuous basis; and the ability to retrieve\n        specific\
    \ pieces of information, specific types or classes of\n        information, or\
    \ the entirety of available information.\n    3.  The information model MUST accommodate\
    \ the interoperable\n        addition of new data types and/or schemas.\n   G-002\
    \ (Interoperability):  The data models, protocols, and transports\n    MUST be\
    \ specified with enough details to ensure interoperability.\n   G-003 (Scalability):\
    \  SACM needs to support a broad set of deployment\n    scenarios.  The data models,\
    \ protocols, and transports have to be\n    scalable unless they are specifically\
    \ defined to apply to a special-\n    purpose scenario, such as constrained devices.\
    \  A SACM transfer\n    protocol standard SHOULD include a section on scalability\n\
    \    considerations that addresses the number of endpoints and amount of\n   \
    \ information to which it can reasonably be expected to scale.\n    Scalability\
    \ must be addressed to support:\n    *  Large messages: It is possible that the\
    \ size of posture\n       assessment information can vary from a single assessment\
    \ that is\n       small in size to a very large message or a very large set of\n\
    \       assessments (up to multiple gigabytes in size).\n    *  Large number of\
    \ messages per second: A deployment may involve\n       many rapid or simultaneous\
    \ events that require processing,\n       generating many messages per second.\n\
    \    *  Large number of providers and consumers: A deployment may consist\n  \
    \     of a very large number of endpoints requesting and/or producing\n      \
    \ posture assessment information.\n    *  Large number of target endpoints: A\
    \ deployment may be managing\n       information of a very large number of target\
    \ endpoints.\n   G-004 (Versatility):  The data model, protocols, and transports\
    \ must\n    be suitably specified to enable implementations to fit into\n    different\
    \ deployment models and scenarios, including considerations\n    for implementations\
    \ of data models and transports operating in\n    constrained environments.  Separate\
    \ solutions may be necessary to\n    meet the needs of specific deployment models\
    \ and scenarios.\n   G-005 (Information Extensibility):  Non-standard (implementation-\n\
    \    specific) attributes MUST be supported.  A method SHOULD be defined\n   \
    \ for preventing collisions from occurring in the naming of all\n    attributes\
    \ independent of their source.  For interoperability and\n    scope boundary,\
    \ the information model MUST define the mandatory set\n    of attributes.\n  \
    \ G-006 (Data Protection):  To protect the information being shared,\n    SACM\
    \ components MUST protect the integrity and confidentiality of\n    data in transit\
    \ (end to end) and data at rest (as information is\n    stored in repositories).\
    \  Mechanisms for this protection are\n    unspecified but should include industry\
    \ best practices.  These\n    mechanisms are required to be available (i.e., all\
    \ data-handling\n    components must support them) but are not required to be\
    \ used in all\n    cases.\n   G-007 (Data Partitioning):  A method for partitioning\
    \ data MUST be\n    supported to accommodate considerations such as geographic,\n\
    \    regulatory, operational requirements, overlay boundaries, and\n    federation\
    \ (where the data may be collected in multiple locations\n    and either centralized\
    \ or kept in the local region).  Where\n    replication of data is supported,\
    \ it is required that methods exist\n    to prevent update loops.\n   G-008 (Versioning\
    \ and Backward Compatibility):  Announcement and\n    negotiation of versions,\
    \ inclusive of existing capabilities (such as\n    transfer protocols, data models,\
    \ specific attributes within data\n    models, standard attribute expression sets,\
    \ etc.) MUST be supported.\n    Negotiation for both versioning and capabilities\
    \ is needed to\n    accommodate future growth and ecosystems with mixed capabilities.\n\
    \   G-009 (Information Discovery):  There MUST be mechanisms for\n    components\
    \ to discover what information is available across the\n    ecosystem (i.e., a\
    \ method for cataloging data available in the\n    ecosystem and advertising it\
    \ to consumers), where to go to get a\n    specific piece of that information\
    \ (i.e., which provider has the\n    information), and what schemas are in use\
    \ for organizing the\n    information.  For example, a method can be provided\
    \ by which a node\n    can locate the advertised information so that consumers\
    \ are not\n    required to have a priori knowledge to find available information.\n\
    \   G-010 (Target Endpoint Discovery):  SACM MUST define the means by\n    which\
    \ target endpoints may be discovered.  The use case in\n    Section 2.1.2 of [RFC7632]\
    \ describes the need to discover endpoints\n    and their composition.\n   G-011\
    \ (Push and Pull Access):  Three methods of data access MUST be\n    supported:\
    \ a Pull model, a solicited Push model, and an unsolicited\n    Push model.  All\
    \ of the methods of data access MUST support the\n    ability for the initiator\
    \ to filter the set of posture assessment\n    information to be delivered.  Additionally,\
    \ the provider of the\n    information MUST be able to filter the set of posture\
    \ assessment\n    information based on the permissions of the recipient.  This\n\
    \    requirement is driven by the use cases in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4\n    of\
    \ [RFC7632].\n   G-012 (SACM Component Interface):  The interfaces by which SACM\n\
    \    components communicate to share endpoint posture information MUST be\n  \
    \  well defined.  That is, the interface defines the data model, SACM\n    transfer\
    \ protocols, and network transfer protocols to enable SACM\n    components to\
    \ communicate.\n   G-013 (Endpoint Location and Network Topology):  The SACM\n\
    \    architecture and interfaces MUST allow for the target endpoint\n    (network)\
    \ location and network topology to be modeled and\n    understood.  Where appropriate,\
    \ the data model and the interfaces\n    SHOULD allow for discovery of the target\
    \ endpoint location, network\n    topology, or both.\n   G-014 (Target Endpoint\
    \ Identity):  The SACM architecture and\n    interfaces MUST support the ability\
    \ of components to provide\n    attributes that can be used to compose an identity\
    \ for a target\n    endpoint.  These identities MAY be composed of attributes\
    \ from one\n    or more SACM components.\n   G-015 (Data Access Control):  Methods\
    \ of access control must be\n    supported to accommodate considerations such\
    \ as geographic,\n    regulatory, operational, and federations.  Entities accessing\
    \ or\n    publishing data MUST identify themselves and pass access policy.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Requirements for the Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Requirements for the Architecture\n   Following are the requirements for\
    \ the SACM architecture:\n   ARCH-001 (Component Functions):  At the simplest\
    \ abstraction, the\n    SACM architecture MUST represent the core components and\
    \ interfaces\n    needed to perform the production and consumption of posture\n\
    \    assessment information.\n   ARCH-002 (Scalability):  The architectural components\
    \ MUST account\n    for a range of deployments, from very small sets of endpoints\
    \ to\n    very large deployments.\n   ARCH-003 (Flexibility):  The architectural\
    \ components MUST account\n    for different deployment scenarios where the architectural\n\
    \    components may be implemented, deployed, or used within a single\n    application,\
    \ service, or network, or may comprise a federated\n    system.\n   ARCH-004 (Separation\
    \ of Data and Management Functions):  SACM MUST\n    define both the configuration\
    \ and management of the SACM data models\n    and protocols used to transfer and\
    \ share posture assessment\n    information.\n   ARCH-005 (Topology Flexibility):\
    \  Both centralized and decentralized\n    (peer-to-peer) information exchange\
    \ MUST be supported.  Centralized\n    data exchange enables use of a common data\
    \ format to bridge together\n    data exchange between diverse systems and can\
    \ leverage a virtual\n    data store that centralizes and offloads all data access,\
    \ storage,\n    and maintenance to a dedicated resource.  Decentralized data\n\
    \    exchange enables simplicity of sharing data between relatively\n    uniform\
    \ systems and between small numbers of systems, especially\n    within a single\
    \ enterprise domain.  The fact that a centralized or\n    decentralized deployment\
    \ is used SHOULD be invisible to a consumer.\n    However, there may be cases\
    \ where the producer chooses to include\n    that information due to consumer\
    \ preference.\n   ARCH-006 (Capability Negotiation):  Announcement and negotiation\
    \ of\n    functional capabilities (such as authentication protocols,\n    authorization\
    \ schemes, data models, transfer protocols, etc.)  MUST\n    be supported, enabling\
    \ a SACM component to make inquiries about the\n    capabilities of other components\
    \ in the SACM ecosystem.\n   ARCH-007 (Role-Based Authorization):  The SACM architecture\
    \ MUST be\n    capable of effecting role-based authorization.  Distinction of\n\
    \    endpoints capable of and authorized to provide or consume\n    information\
    \ is required to address appropriate access controls.\n   ARCH-008 (Context-Based\
    \ Authorization):  The SACM architecture MUST\n    be capable of effecting context-based\
    \ authorization.  Different\n    policies (e.g., business, regulatory, etc.) might\
    \ specify what data\n    may be exposed to, or shared by, consumers based on one\
    \ or more\n    attributes of the consumer.  The policy might specify that consumers\n\
    \    are required to share specific information either back to the system\n  \
    \  or to administrators.\n   ARCH-009 (Time Synchronization):  Actions or decisions\
    \ based on time-\n    sensitive data (such as user logon/logoff, endpoint connection/\n\
    \    disconnection, endpoint behavior events, etc.) are all predicated on\n  \
    \  a synchronized understanding of time.  The SACM architecture MUST\n    provide\
    \ a mechanism for all components to synchronize time.  A\n    mechanism for detecting\
    \ and reporting time discrepancies SHOULD be\n    provided by the architecture\
    \ and reflected in the information model.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Requirements for the Information Model
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Requirements for the Information Model\n   The SACM information model represents\
    \ the abstracted representation\n   for posture assessment information to be communicated.\
    \  SACM data\n   models must adhere to and comply with the SACM information model.\n\
    \   The requirements for the SACM information model include:\n   IM-001 (Extensible\
    \ Attribute Vocabulary):  The information model MUST\n    define a minimum set\
    \ of attributes for communicating posture\n    information, to ensure interoperability\
    \ between data models.\n    (Individual data models may define attributes beyond\
    \ the mandatory-\n    to-implement minimum set.)  The attributes should be defined\
    \ with a\n    clear mechanism for extensibility to enable data models to adhere\
    \ to\n    SACM's required attributes as well as allow for their own\n    extensions.\
    \  The attribute vocabulary should be defined with a clear\n    mechanism for\
    \ extensibility to enable future versions of the\n    information model to be\
    \ interoperably expanded with new attributes.\n   IM-002 (Posture Data Publication):\
    \  The information model MUST allow\n    for the data to be provided by a SACM\
    \ component either solicited or\n    unsolicited.  No aspect of the information\
    \ model should be dependent\n    upon or assume a Push or Pull model of publication.\n\
    \   IM-003 (Data Model Negotiation):  SACM's information model MUST allow\n  \
    \  support for different data models, data model versions, and\n    different\
    \ versions of the operations on the data models and transfer\n    protocols. \
    \ The SACM information model MUST include the ability to\n    discover and negotiate\
    \ the use of a particular data model or any\n    data model.\n   IM-004 (Data\
    \ Model Identification):  The information model MUST\n    provide a means to uniquely\
    \ identify each data model.  The\n    identifier MUST contain both an identifier\
    \ of the data model and a\n    version indicator for the data model.  The identifiers\
    \ SHOULD be\n    decomposable so that a customer can query for any version of\
    \ a\n    specific data model and compare returned values for older or newer\n\
    \    than a desired version.\n   IM-005 (Data Lifetime Management):  The information\
    \ model MUST\n    provide a means to allow data models to include data lifetime\n\
    \    management.  The information model must identify attributes that can\n  \
    \  allow data models to, at minimum, identify the data's origination\n    time\
    \ and expected time of next update or data longevity (how long\n    the data should\
    \ be assumed to still be valid).\n   IM-006 (Singularity and Modularity):  The\
    \ SACM information model MUST\n    be singular (i.e., there is only one information\
    \ model, not multiple\n    alternative information models from which to choose)\
    \ and MAY be\n    modular (a conjunction of several subcomponents) for ease of\n\
    \    maintenance and extension.  For example, endpoint identification\n    could\
    \ be an independent subcomponent of the information model, to\n    simplify updating\
    \ of endpoint identification attributes.\n"

    \   DM-001 (Element Association):  A SACM information model consists of a\n  \
    \  set of SACM information model elements.  A SACM data model MUST be\n    derived\
    \ from the SACM information model.  A SACM data model consists\n    of a set of\
    \ SACM data model elements.  In this derivation, a SACM\n    data model element\
    \ MAY map to one or more SACM information model\n    elements.  In addition, a\
    \ SACM data model MAY include additional\n    data model elements that are not\
    \ associated with any SACM\n    information model elements.\n   DM-002 (Data Model\
    \ Structure):  The data model can be structured\n    either as one single module\
    \ or separated into modules and submodules\n    that allow for references between\
    \ them.  The data model structure\n    MAY reflect structure in the information\
    \ model but does not need to.\n    For example, the data model might use one module\
    \ to define\n    endpoints, and that module might reference other modules that\n\
    \    describe the various assets associated with the endpoint.\n    Constraints\
    \ and interfaces might further be defined to resolve or\n    tolerate ambiguity\
    \ in the references (e.g., the same IP address used\n    in two separate networks).\n\
    \   DM-003 (Search Flexibility):  The search interfaces and actions MUST\n   \
    \ include the ability to start a search anywhere within a data model\n    structure\
    \ and the ability to search based on patterns (\"wildcard\n    searches\") as\
    \ well as specific data elements.\n   DM-004 (Full vs. Partial Updates):  The\
    \ data model SHOULD include the\n    ability to allow providers of data to provide\
    \ the data as a whole or\n    when updates occur.  For example, a consumer can\
    \ request a full\n    update on initial engagement, then request to receive deltas\n\
    \    (updates containing only the changes since the last update) on an\n    ongoing\
    \ basis as new data is generated.\n   DM-005 (Loose Coupling):  The data model\
    \ SHOULD allow for a loose\n    coupling between the provider and the consumer,\
    \ such that the\n    consumer can request information without being required to\
    \ request\n    it from a specific provider, and a provider can publish information\n\
    \    without having a specific consumer targeted to receive it.\n   DM-006 (Data\
    \ Cardinality):  The data model MUST describe their\n    constraints (e.g., cardinality).\
    \  As posture information and the\n    tasks for collection, aggregation, or evaluation\
    \ could comprise one\n    or more attributes, interfaces and actions MUST allow\
    \ and account\n    for such cardinality and for conditional, optional, or mandatory\n\
    \    attributes.\n   DM-007 (Data Model Negotiation):  The interfaces and actions\
    \ in the\n    data model MUST include capability negotiation to enable discovery\n\
    \    of supported and available data types and schemas.\n   DM-008 (Data Origin):\
    \  The data model MUST include the ability for\n    consumers to identify the\
    \ data origin (provider that collected the\n    data).\n   DM-009 (Origination\
    \ Time):  The data model SHOULD allow the provider\n    to include the information's\
    \ origination time.\n   DM-010 (Data Generation):  The data model MUST allow the\
    \ provider to\n    include attributes defining how the data was generated (e.g.,\
    \ self-\n    reported, reported by aggregator, scan result, etc.).\n   DM-011\
    \ (Data Source):  The data model MUST allow the provider to\n    include attributes\
    \ identifying the data source (target endpoint from\n    which the data was collected),\
    \ e.g., hostname, domain (DNS) name, or\n    application name.\n   DM-012 (Data\
    \ Updates):  The data model SHOULD allow the provider to\n    include attributes\
    \ defining whether the information provided is a\n    delta, partial, or full\
    \ set of information.\n   DM-013 (Multiple Collectors):  The data model MUST support\
    \ the\n    collection of attributes by a variety of collectors, including\n  \
    \  internal collectors, external collectors with an authenticated\n    relationship\
    \ with the endpoint, and external collectors based on\n    network and other observers.\n\
    \   DM-014 (Attribute Extensibility):  All of the use cases in Section 2\n   \
    \ of [RFC7632] describe the need for an attribute dictionary.  With\n    SACM's\
    \ scope focused on posture assessment, the data model attribute\n    collection\
    \ and aggregation MUST have a well-understood set of\n    attributes inclusive\
    \ of their meaning or usage intent.  The data\n    model MUST include all attributes\
    \ defined in the information model\n    and MAY include additional attributes\
    \ beyond those found in the\n    information model.  Additional attributes MUST\
    \ be defined in\n    accordance with the extensibility framework provided in the\n\
    \    information model (see IM-001).\n   DM-015 (Solicited vs. Unsolicited Updates):\
    \  The data model MUST\n    enable a provider to publish data either solicited\
    \ (in response to a\n    request from a consumer) or unsolicited (as new data\
    \ is generated,\n    without a request required).  For example, an external collector\
    \ can\n    publish data in response to a request by a consumer for information\n\
    \    about an endpoint, or it can publish data as it observes new\n    information\
    \ about an endpoint, without any specific consumer request\n    triggering the\
    \ publication; a compliance-server provider may publish\n    endpoint posture\
    \ information in response to a request from a\n    consumer (solicited), or it\
    \ may publish posture information driven\n    by a change in the posture of the\
    \ endpoint (unsolicited).\n   DM-016 (Transfer Agnostic):  The data model MUST\
    \ be transfer\n    agnostic, to allow for the data operations to leverage the\
    \ most\n    appropriate SACM transfer protocol.\n"

  - "2.5.  Requirements for Data Model Operations\n   Posture information data adhering\
    \ to a data model must also provide\n   interfaces that include operations for\
    \ access and production of the\n   data.  Operations requirements are distinct\
    \ from transfer\n   requirements in that operations requirements are requirements\
    \ on the\n   application performing requests and responses, whereas transfer\n\
    \   requirements are requirements on the transfer protocol carrying the\n   requests\
    \ and responses.  The specific requirements for such\n   operations include:\n\
    \   OP-001 (Time Synchronization):  Request and response operations MUST\n   \
    \ be timestamped, and published information SHOULD capture time of\n    publication.\
    \  Actions or decisions based on time-sensitive data\n    (such as user logon/logoff,\
    \ endpoint connection/disconnection,\n    endpoint behavior events, etc.) are\
    \ all predicated on a synchronized\n    understanding of time.  A method for detecting\
    \ and reporting time\n    discrepancies SHOULD be provided.\n   OP-002 (Collection\
    \ Abstraction):  Collection is the act of a SACM\n    component gathering data\
    \ from a target endpoint.  The request for a\n    data item MUST include enough\
    \ information to properly identify the\n    item to collect, but the request shall\
    \ not be a command to directly\n    execute nor be directly applied as arguments\
    \ to a command.  The\n    purpose of this requirement is primarily to reduce the\
    \ potential\n    attack vectors but has the additional benefit of abstracting\
    \ the\n    request for collection from the collection method, thereby allowing\n\
    \    more flexibility in how collection is implemented.\n   OP-003 (Collection\
    \ Composition):  A collection request MAY be\n    composed of multiple collection\
    \ requests (which yield collected\n    values).  The desire for multiple values\
    \ MUST be expressed as part\n    of the collection request, so that the aggregation\
    \ can be resolved\n    at the point of collection without having to interact with\
    \ the\n    requestor.  This requirement should not be interpreted as preventing\n\
    \    a collector from providing attributes that were not part of the\n    original\
    \ request.\n   OP-004 (Attribute-Based Query):  A query operation is the act of\n\
    \    requesting data from a provider.  Query operations SHOULD be based\n    on\
    \ a set of attributes.  Query operations MUST support both a query\n    for specific\
    \ attributes and a query for all attributes.  The use\n    case in Section 2.1.2\
    \ of [RFC7632] describes the need for the data\n    model to support a query operation\
    \ based on a set of attributes to\n    facilitate collection of information such\
    \ as posture assessment,\n    inventory (of endpoints or endpoint components),\
    \ and configuration\n    checklist.\n   OP-005 (Information-Based Query with Filtering):\
    \  The query operation\n    MUST support filtering.  The use case in Section 2.1.3\
    \ of [RFC7632]\n    describes the need for the data model to support the means\
    \ for the\n    information to be collected through a query mechanism.  Furthermore,\n\
    \    the query operation requires filtering capabilities to allow for\n    only\
    \ a subset of information to be retrieved.  The query operation\n    MAY be a\
    \ synchronous request or asynchronous request.\n   OP-006 (Operation Scalability):\
    \  The operation resulting from a query\n    operation MUST be able to handle\
    \ the return and receipt of large\n    amounts of data.  The use case in Section\
    \ 2.1.4 of [RFC7632]\n    describe the need for the data model to support scalability.\
    \  For\n    example, the query operation may result in a very large set of\n \
    \   attributes as well as a large set of targets.\n   OP-007 (Data Abstraction):\
    \  The data model MUST allow a SACM\n    component to communicate what data was\
    \ used to construct the target\n    endpoint's identity, so that other SACM components\
    \ can determine\n    whether they are constructing an equivalent target endpoint\
    \ (and its\n    identity) and whether they have confidence in that identity. \
    \ SACM\n    components SHOULD have interfaces defined to transmit this data\n\
    \    directly or to refer to where the information can be retrieved.\n   OP-008\
    \ (Provider Restriction):  Request operations MUST include the\n    ability to\
    \ restrict the data to be provided by a specific provider\n    or a provider with\
    \ specific characteristics.  Response operations\n    MUST include the ability\
    \ to identify the provider that supplied the\n    response.  For example, a SACM\
    \ consumer should be able to request\n    that all of the data come from a specific\
    \ provider by identity\n    (e.g., Provider A) or from a provider that is in a\
    \ specific location\n    (e.g., in the Boston office).\n"

  - "2.6.  Requirements for SACM Transfer Protocols\n   The term \"SACM transfer protocol\"\
    \ is intended to be distinguished\n   from underlying transport- and internet-layer\
    \ protocols such as TCP/\n   IP or operating at an application-layer protocol\
    \ such as HTTP.  The\n   SACM transfer protocol is focused on moving data and\
    \ performing\n   necessary access control operations; it is agnostic to the data\
    \ model\n   operations.\n   The requirements for SACM transfer protocols include:\n\
    \   T-001 (Multiple Transfer Protocol Support):  SACM transfer protocols\n   \
    \ will vary depending on the deployment model that relies on different\n    transfer-layer\
    \ requirements, different device capabilities, and\n    system configurations\
    \ dealing with connectivity.  For example, where\n    posture attributes may be\
    \ collected directly from an endpoint using\n    the Network Endpoint Assessment\
    \ (NEA) model [RFC5209], different\n    transports may be defined to collect them\
    \ using Posture Transport\n    Protocol for Extensible Authentication Protocol\
    \ Tunnel Methods (PT-\n    EAP) [RFC7171] or Posture Transport Protocol over TLS\
    \ (PT-TLS)\n    [RFC6876], depending on the deployment scenario.\n   T-002 (Data\
    \ Integrity):  SACM transfer protocols MUST be able to\n    ensure data integrity\
    \ for data in transit.\n   T-003 (Data Confidentiality):  SACM transfer protocols\
    \ MUST be able\n    to support data confidentiality.  SACM transfer protocols\
    \ MUST\n    ensure data protection for data in transit (e.g., by encryption) to\n\
    \    provide confidentiality, integrity, and robustness against protocol-\n  \
    \  based attacks.  Note that while the transfer MUST be able to support\n    data\
    \ confidentiality, implementations MAY provide a configuration\n    option that\
    \ enables and disables confidentiality in deployments.\n    Protection for data\
    \ at rest is not in scope for transfer protocols.\n    Data protection MAY be\
    \ used for both privacy and non-privacy\n    scenarios.\n   T-004 (Transfer Protection):\
    \  SACM transfer protocols MUST be capable\n    of supporting mutual authentication\
    \ and replay protection.\n   T-005 (Transfer Reliability):  SACM transfer protocols\
    \ MUST provide\n    reliable delivery of data.  This includes the ability to perform\n\
    \    fragmentation and reassembly and to detect replays.  The SACM\n    transfer\
    \ may take advantage of reliability features in the network\n    transport; however,\
    \ the network transport may be unreliable (e.g.,\n    UDP), in which case the\
    \ SACM transfer running over the unreliable\n    network transport is responsible\
    \ for ensuring reliability (i.e., by\n    provisions such as confirmations and\
    \ retransmits).\n   T-006 (Transfer-Layer Requirements):  Each SACM transfer protocol\n\
    \    MUST clearly specify the transport-layer requirements it needs to\n    operate\
    \ correctly.  Examples of items that may need to be specified\n    include connectivity\
    \ requirements, replay requirements, data link\n    encryption requirements, and/or\
    \ channel-binding requirements.  These\n    requirements are needed in order for\
    \ deployments to be done\n    correctly.\n   T-007 (Transfer Protocol Adoption):\
    \  SACM SHOULD, where reasonably\n    possible, leverage and use existing IETF\
    \ transfer protocols versus\n    defining new ones.\n"

    \  As such, it is\n   expected that several data models, protocols, and transfer\
    \ protocols\n   may be defined or reused from already-existing standards.\n  \
    \ To address security and privacy considerations, the data model,\n   protocols,\
    \ and transports must consider authorization based on\n   consumer function and\
    \ privileges, to only allow authorized consumers\n   and providers to access specific\

    \ multiple entities (such as across\n   organizational or geographic boundaries),\
    \ authorization must also\n   extend to infrastructure elements themselves, such\
    \ as central\n   controllers, brokers, and data repositories.\n   In addition,\
    \ authorization needs to extend to specific information or\n   resources available\
    \ in the environment.  In other words,\n   authorization is based on the subject\
    \ (the information requestor),\n   the provider (the information responder), the\
    \ object (the endpoint\n   the information is being requested on), and the attribute\

    \ and vulnerability reporting and remediation systems.  While\n   the goal is\

    \ that participating endpoints may not be cooperative\n   or trustworthy.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Trust between Provider and Requestor
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Trust between Provider and Requestor\n   The information given from the\
    \ provider to a requestor may come with\n   different levels of trustworthiness\
    \ given the different potential\n   deployment scenarios and compromise at the\
    \ provider, the requesting\n   consumer, or devices that are involved in the transfer\
    \ between the\n   provider and requestor.  This section will describe the different\n\
    \   considerations that may reduce the level of trustworthiness of the\n   information\
    \ provided.\n   In the information transfer flow, it is possible that some of\
    \ the\n   devices may serve as proxies or brokers and, as such, may be able to\n\
    \   observe the communications flowing between an information provider\n   and\
    \ requestor.  Without appropriate protections, it is possible for\n   these proxies\
    \ and brokers to inject and affect man-in-the-middle\n   attacks.\n   In general,\
    \ it is common to distrust the network service provider,\n   unless the full hop-by-hop\
    \ communications process flow is well\n   understood.  As such, the posture information\
    \ provider should protect\n   the posture information data it provides as well\
    \ as the transfer it\n   uses.  Similarly, while there may be providers whose\
    \ goal is to\n   openly share its information, there may also be providers whose\n\
    \   policy is to grant access to certain posture information based on its\n  \
    \ business or regulatory policy.  In those situations, a provider may\n   require\
    \ full authentication and authorization of the requestor (or\n   set of requestors)\
    \ and share only the authorized information to the\n   authenticated and authorized\
    \ requestors.\n   Beyond distrusting the network service provider, a requestor\
    \ must\n   also take into account that the information received from the\n   provider\
    \ may have been communicated through an undetermined network\n   communications\
    \ system.  That is, the posture information may have\n   traversed through many\
    \ devices before reaching the requestor.  SACM\n   specifications should provide\
    \ the means for verifying data origin and\n   data integrity and, at minimum,\
    \ provide endpoint authentication and\n   transfer integrity.\n   A requestor\
    \ may require data freshness indications, both knowledge of\n   data origination\
    \ as well as time of publication, so that it can make\n   more informed decisions\
    \ about the relevance of the data based on its\n   currency and/or age.\n   It\
    \ is also important to note that endpoint assessment reports,\n   especially as\
    \ they may be provided by the target endpoint, may pose\n   untrustworthy information.\
    \  The considerations for this are described\n   in Section 8 of [RFC5209].\n\
    \   The trustworthiness of the posture information given by the provider\n   to\
    \ one or many requestors is dependent on several considerations.\n   Some of these\
    \ include the requestor requiring:\n   o  Full disclosure of the network topology\
    \ path to the provider(s).\n   o  Direct (peer-to-peer) communication with the\
    \ provider.\n   o  Authentication and authorization of the provider.\n   o  Either\
    \ or both confidentiality and integrity at the transfer\n      layer.\n   o  Either\
    \ or both confidentiality and integrity at the data layer.\n"

  - "4.2.  Privacy Considerations\n   SACM information may contain sensitive information\
    \ about the target\n   endpoint as well as revealing identity information of the\
    \ producer or\n   consumer of such information.  Similarly, as part of the SACM\n\
    \   discovery mechanism, the capabilities and roles (e.g., SACM\n   components\

    \   In addition to identity and SACM capabilities information disclosure,\n  \
    \ the use of timestamps (or other attributes that can be used as\n   identifiers)\
