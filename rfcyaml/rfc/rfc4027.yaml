- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Domain Name System (DNS) [1] information is traditionally\
    \ stored in\n   text files, so-called master files or zone files.  The format\
    \ is\n   described in section 5 of RFC 1035 [2].\n   DNS data can also be stored\
    \ in a \"detached\" format, intended for\n   archiving purposes, described in\
    \ RFC 2540 [4].\n   This document registers MIME media types for the two data\
    \ formats,\n   with the registration procedures described in RFC 2048 [3].\n"

    \  Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/dns\n   MIME media type\
    \ name: application\n   MIME subtype name: dns\n   Required parameters: None.\n\
    \   Optional parameters: None.\n   Encoding considerations: The data format is\
    \ binary, and data must be\n   transfered unmodified.  Using encodings intended\
    \ for textual parts is\n   not recommended.\n   Security considerations: This\
    \ media type identifies content as being\n   detached DNS information, as documented\
    \ in RFC 2540 [4].  This data\n   may be security relevant as per RFC 2538 [7]\
    \ or may be secured\n   information as per RFC 2535 [6].  Securing the content\
    \ further may be\n   done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP [5] or CMS\
    \ [9], but\n   this is outside of the scope here.  Further security assessments\
    \ are\n   not available at this point.\n   Interoperability considerations: The\
    \ encoding of detached DNS\n   information is, unlike textual master files, well\
    \ defined.  No\n   further interoperability considerations are known.\n   Published\
    \ specification: The format of data that could be tagged with\n   this media type\
    \ is documented in RFC 2540 [4].\n   Applications that use this media type: DNS-related\
    \ software,\n   including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.\n\

- title: 3.  MIME Type Registration of text/dns
  contents:
  - "3.  MIME Type Registration of text/dns\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject:\
    \ Registration of MIME media type text/dns\n   MIME media type name: text\n  \
    \ MIME subtype name: dns\n   Required parameters: None.\n   Optional parameters:\
    \ None.\n   Encoding considerations: The data is textual and should be transfered\n\
    \   in a line-oriented mode.  Text literals may contain CRLF within the\n   text.\
    \  Binary transport is possible between systems that use the same\n   end-of-line\
    \ conventions.  Master files are in general ASCII, but\n   non-ASCII octet values\
    \ may occur and are treated as opaque values by\n   DNS software (compare RFC\
    \ 1035, section 5).  The master file format\n   permits encoding arbitrary octet\
    \ values by using the \"\\DDD\" encoding.\n   The use of \"\\DDD\" encoding can\
    \ be more reliable than transporting\n   non-ASCII through MIME transports, if\
    \ data passes through a gateway\n   that re-encodes the character data.\n   Security\
    \ considerations: This media type identifies content as being\n   DNS information\
    \ in \"master file\" format, as documented in RFC 1035\n   [2].  The DNS data\
    \ may be security relevant as per to RFC 2538 [7],\n   or may be secured information\
    \ as per to RFC 2535 [6].  Securing the\n   content further may be done with standard\
    \ techniques, such as OpenPGP\n   [5] or CMS [9], but this is outside of the scope\
    \ here.  Further\n   security assessments are not available at this point.\n \
    \  Interoperability considerations: There are interoperability concerns\n   with\
    \ master files, due to the widespread use of vendor-specific\n   extensions. \
    \ Non-ASCII comments within master files may have been\n   encoded in locally\
    \ chosen character sets, which may be difficult to\n   transport interoperably.\
    \  Non-ASCII data in general can become\n   corrupted by re-encoding gateways.\
    \  To achieve interoperability, one\n   can use the master file format described\
    \ in the specification and the\n   \"\\DDD\" encoding for non-ASCII octets.  Further\
    \ interoperability\n   issues with unrecognized RR types exist, which may be handled\
    \ as\n   discussed in section 5 of RFC 3597 [8].\n   Published specification:\
    \ The format of data that could be tagged with\n   this MIME type is documented\
    \ in RFC 1035 [2].\n   Applications that use this media type: DNS-related software,\n\
    \   including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.\n   Additional\
    \ information:\n     Magic number(s): None.\n     File extension(s): 'soa' and\
    \ 'zone' are known to be used.\n     Macintosh file type code(s): Unknown.\n \
