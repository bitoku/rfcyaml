- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   STUN can be securely transported using TLS-over-TCP (referred\
    \ to as\n   TLS [RFC5246]), as specified in [RFC5389], or TLS-over-UDP (referred\n\
    \   to as DTLS [RFC6347]), as specified in [RFC7350].\n   ALPN [RFC7301] enables\
    \ an endpoint to positively identify an\n   application protocol in TLS/DTLS and\
    \ distinguish it from other TLS/\n   DTLS protocols.  With ALPN, the client sends\
    \ the list of supported\n   application protocols as part of the TLS/DTLS ClientHello\
    \ message.\n   The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol as\
    \ part\n   of the TLS/DTLS ServerHello message.  Application protocol\n   negotiation\
    \ can thus be accomplished within the TLS/DTLS handshake,\n   without adding network\
    \ round-trips.\n   STUN protocol usages, such as TURN [RFC5766], can be used to\
    \ identify\n   the purpose of a flow without initiating a session.\n   This document\
    \ proposes the following ALPN labels to identify STUN\n   protocol [RFC5389] usages.\n\
    \   'stun.turn':  Label to identify the specific use of STUN over (D)TLS\n   \
    \   for TURN (Section 4.6 of [RFC7350]).\n   'stun.nat-discovery':  Label to identify\
    \ the specific use of STUN\n      over (D)TLS for NAT discovery (Section 4.1 of\
    \ [RFC7350]).\n"

    \ any specific\n   security considerations beyond those detailed in the TLS ALPN\n\
    \   Extension specification [RFC7301].  It also does not impact the\n   security\
