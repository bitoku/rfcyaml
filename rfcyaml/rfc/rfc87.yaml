  - "     TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION AT THE NEXT NETWORK WORKING GROUP MEETING\n     Project\
    \ MAC is planning a network graphics meeting to be held in\nApril.  It would be\
    \ desirable to devote some portion of the February\nUrbana meeting to consideration\
    \ of the length, format, structure and\ncontents of the April meeting.  Perhaps\
    \ discussion on topics germane\nto network graphics can be started in an informal\
    \ way at Urbana.\n     Project MAC's present ideas about the length, structure,\
    \ and\nformat of the network graphics meeting are as follows:\n   1)  The length\
    \ of the meeting is expected to be two FULL days.\n   2) Each organization represented\
    \ is expected to participate by\n   presenting one or more working paper(s) on\
    \ one or more of the areas\n   chosen for discussion.  The working paper(s) will\
    \ minimally consist of\n   a set of working notes and an oral presentation.  Who\
    \ presents the\n   working paper for an organization, or how the labor is divided,\
    \ is to\n   be determined by the organization.\n   3) The bulk of the two full\
    \ days is to be used for the prepared oral\n   presentation with discussion after\
    \ each presentation.  About three\n   hours at the end of the second day are reserved\
    \ for open discussion.\n   This three hour period is to be used for critiquing\
    \ this meeting,\n   planning the next one, and bidding for special assignments\
    \ that\n   participating organizations might wish to undertake as a contribution\n\
    \   to the network graphics effort.\n   1) A description of present or future\
    \ graphical facilities that are or\n   will be connected to the network, with\
    \ a functional description of how\n   they work or look (or might look) to a user\
    \ (network user).\n   2) A functional description of a graphical facility one\
    \ can envision\n   or would like to see the network support.\n   3) Proposals\
    \ on network graphic protocol, even proposal which are only\n   intended to smoke\
    \ out issues are acceptable.\n   4) A sharing of network graphic \"Historic Moments.\"\
    \  Description of\n   your experiences in network graphics, what problems were\
    \ encountered,\n   how you solved or lived with them.  What insight and understanding\n\
    \   have you gained, what questions have been left unanswered by these\n   experiences?\n\
    The foregoing are our present ideas.  If you have suggestions, please\nconvey\
    \ them to one of the people from your site attending the Urbana\nmeeting so they\
    \ can be discussed, or notify either Fran Yost or me of\nyour suggestion by calling\
    \ 617-864-6900-6026 or writing to:\n      Miss F. Yost\n      Project MAC/MIT\n\

    I hope we can come away from the Urbana meeting with a firm concept of\nthe April\
    \ network graphic meeting.\nthe February meeting a list of its people who are\
    \ actively engaged in\ngraphics with facilities that are or will be on the network.\n\
