  - "1.  Introduction\n   An LDP-based MAC address withdrawal mechanism is specified
    in\n   [RFC4762] to remove dynamically learned MAC addresses when the source\n
    \  of those addresses can no longer forward traffic.  This is\n   accomplished
    by sending an LDP Address Withdraw Message with a MAC\n   List TLV containing
    the MAC addresses to be removed from all other\n   Provider Edge nodes over the
    LDP sessions.  [RFC7361] describes an\n   optimized MAC withdrawal mechanism that
    can be used to remove only\n   the set of MAC addresses that need to be relearned
    in H-VPLS\n   networks.  [RFC7361] also describes optimized MAC withdrawal\n   operations
    in PBB-VPLS networks.\n   A PW can be signaled via the LDP or can be statically
    provisioned.\n   In the case of a static PW, an LDP-based MAC withdrawal mechanism\n
    \  cannot be used.  This is analogous to the problem and solution\n   described
    in [RFC6478] where a PW OAM (Operations, Administration,\n   and Maintenance)
    message has been introduced to carry the PW status\n   TLV using the in-band PW
    Associated Channel.  In this document, we\n   use a PW OAM message to withdraw
    MAC address(es) learned via a static\n   PW.\n   Thus, MAC withdraw signaling
    for static PW reuses the following\n   concepts:\n      -  in-band signaling mechanisms
    used by static PW status signaling\n         and\n      -  MAC withdrawal mechanisms
    described by [RFC4762] and [RFC7361].\n   MAC withdraw signaling is a best effort
    scheme.  It is an attempt to\n   optimize network convergence by reducing blackholes
    caused by PW\n   failover for protected PWs.  The protocol defined in this document\n
    \  addresses possible loss of the MAC withdraw signal due to network\n   congestion,
    but does not guarantee delivery, as is the case for the\n   LDP-based MAC withdraw
    signaling.  In the event that MAC withdraw\n   signaling does not reach the intended
    target, the fallback to MAC\n   re-learning due to bi-directional traffic or as
    a last resort aging\n   out of MAC addresses in the absence of frames from the
    sources, will\n   resume the traffic via new PW path.  Such fallbacks would cause\n
    \  temporary blackouts but does not render a network permanently\n   unusable.\n"

  - "3.  MAC Withdraw OAM Message\n   LDP provides reliable packet transport for control
    plackets for\n   dynamic PWs.  This can be contrasted with static PWs that rely
    on\n   retransmission and acknowledgments (ACKs) for reliable OAM packet\n   delivery
    as described in [RFC6478].  The proposed solution for MAC\n   withdrawal over
    a static PW also relies on retransmissions and ACKs.\n   However, an ACK is mandatory.
    \ A given MAC withdrawal notification is\n   sent as a PW OAM message, and the
    sender retransmits the message a\n   configured number of times in the absence
    of an ACK response for the\n   sequence-numbered message.  The receiver removes
    the MAC address(es)\n   for a given sequence-number MAC withdraw signaling message
    and sends\n   the ACK response.  The receipt of the same or lower sequence-number\n
    \  message is responded to with an ACK but does not cause removal of MAC\n   addresses.
    \ A new TLV to carry the sequence number has been defined.\n   The format of the
    MAC address withdraw OAM message is shown in Figure\n   1.  The MAC withdraw PW
    OAM message follows the same guidelines used\n   in [RFC6478], whereby the first
    4 bytes of the OAM message header are\n   followed by a message-specific field
    and a set of TLVs relevant for\n   the message.  Since the MAC withdrawal PW OAM
    message is not\n   refreshed forever, a MAC address withdraw OAM message MUST
    contain a\n   \"Sequence Number TLV\"; otherwise, the entire message is dropped.
    \ It\n   MAY contain the MAC Flush Parameter TLV defined in [RFC7361] when\n   static
    PWs are deployed in H-VPLS and PBB-VPLS scenarios.  The first\n   2 bits of the
    sequence-number TLV are reserved and MUST be set to 0\n   on transmit and ignored
    on receipt.\n       0                   1                   2                   3\n

    \           Figure 1: MAC Address Withdraw PW OAM Packet Format\n   In this section,
    the MAC List TLV and MAC Flush Parameter TLV are\n   collectively referred to
    as \"MAC TLV(s)\".  The definition and\n   processing rules of the MAC List TLV
    are described by [RFC4762], and\n   the corresponding rules of the MAC Flush Parameter
    TLV are governed\n   by [RFC7361].\n   \"TLV Length\" is the total length of all
    TLVs in the message, and\n   \"Sequence Number TLV Length\" is the length of the
    Sequence Number\n   field.\n   A single bit (called \"A-bit\") is set by a receiver
    to acknowledge\n   receipt and processing of a MAC Address Withdraw OAM Message.
    \ In the\n   acknowledge message, with the A-bit set, the MAC TLVs are excluded.\n
    \  A single bit (called \"R-bit\") is set to indicate if the sender is\n   requesting
    reset of the sequence numbers.  The sender sets this bit\n   when the pseudowire
    is restarted and has no local record of previous\n   send and expected receive
    sequence numbers.\n   The Sequence Number TLV MUST be the first TLV in the message.\n
    \  The lack of a reliable transport protocol for the in-band OAM\n   necessitates
    a presence of sequencing and acknowledgement scheme so\n   that the receiver can
    recognize newer message from retransmitted\n   older messages.  [RFC4385] describes
    the details of sequence-number\n   handling, which includes overflow detection
    for a Sequence Number\n   field size of 16 bits.  This document leverages the
    same scheme with\n   the two exemptions:\n      -  the Sequence Number field is
    of size 32 bits.\n      -  overflow detection is simplified such that a sequence
    number\n         that exceeds 2,147,483,647 (0x7FFFFFFF) is considered an\n         overflow
    and reset to 1.\n"

  - "4.  Operation\n   This section describes how the initial MAC Withdraw OAM Messages
    are\n   sent and retransmitted, as well as how the messages are processed and\n
    \  retransmitted messages are identified.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Operation of Sender\n   Each PW is associated with a counter to keep
      track of the sequence\n   number of the transmitted MAC withdrawal messages.
      \ Whenever a node\n   sends a new set of MAC TLVs, it increments the transmitted
      sequence-\n   number counter and includes the new sequence number in the message.\n
      \  The transmit sequence number is initialized to 1 at the onset, after\n   the
      wrap and after the sequence number reset request receipt.  Hence\n   the transmit
      sequence number is set to 2 in the first MAC withdraw\n   message sent after
      the sequence number is initialized to 1.\n   The sender expects an ACK from
      the receiver within a time interval we\n   call \"Retransmit Time\", which can
      be either a default (1 second) or a\n   configured value.  If the ACK does not
      arrive within the Retransmit\n   Time, the sender retransmits the message with
      the same sequence\n   number as the original message.  The retransmission MUST
      cease when\n   an ACK is received.  In order to avoid continuous retransmissions
      in\n   the absence of acknowledgements, a method of suppressing\n   retransmissions
      MUST be implemented.  A simple and well-used approach\n   is to cease retransmission
      after a small number of transmissions.  In\n   the absence of an ACK response,
      a one second retransmission with two\n   retries is RECOMMENDED.  However, both
      the interval and the number of\n   retries are a local matter that present no
      interworking issues; thus,\n   the operator MAY configure different values.
      \ Alternatively, an\n   increasing backoff delay with a larger number of retries
      MAY be\n   implemented to improve scaling issues.  Whilst there are no\n   interworking
      issues with any of these methods, the implementer must\n   be mindful to not
      introduce network congestion and must take into\n   account the decaying value
      of the delayed MAC withdraw signaling\n   against possible relearning due to
      bidirectional traffic or MAC\n   timeout.\n   During the period of retransmission,
      if a need to send a new MAC\n   withdraw message with updated sequence number
      arises, then\n   retransmission of the older unacknowledged withdraw message
      MUST be\n   suspended and retransmit time for the new sequence number MUST be\n
      \  initiated.  In essence, a sender engages in retransmission logic only\n   for
      the most recently sent withdraw message for a given PW.\n   In the event that
      a pseudowire is deleted and re-added or the router\n   is restarted with configuration,
      the local node may lose information\n   about the previously sent sequence number.
      \ This becomes problematic\n   for the remote peer as it will continue to ignore
      the received MAC\n   withdraw messages with lower sequence numbers.  In such
      cases, it is\n   desirable to reset the sequence numbers at both ends of the\n
      \  pseudowire.  The reset R-bit is set in the first MAC withdraw to\n   notify
      the remote peer to reset the send and receive sequence\n   numbers.  The R-bit
      must be cleared in subsequent MAC withdraw\n   messages after the acknowledgement
      is received.\n"

  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Operation of Receiver\n   Each PW is associated with a register to keep
      track of the expected\n   sequence number of the MAC withdrawal message and
      is initialized to\n   1.  Whenever a MAC withdrawal message is received, and
      if the\n   sequence number on the message is greater than the value in the\n
      \  register, the MAC addresses contained in the MAC TLVs are removed,\n   and
      the register is updated with the received sequence number.  The\n   receiver
      sends an ACK whose sequence number is the same as that in\n   the received message.\n
      \  If the sequence number in the received message is smaller than or\n   equal
      to the value in the register, the MAC TLVs are not processed.\n   However, an
      ACK with the received sequence number MUST be sent as a\n   response.  The receiver
      processes the ACK message as an\n   acknowledgement for all the MAC withdraw
      messages sent up to the\n   sequence number present in the ACK message and terminates\n
      \  retransmission.\n   The handling of the sequence number is described in Section
      3.\n   A MAC withdraw message with the R-bit set MUST be processed by\n   resetting
      the send and receive sequence number first.  The rest of\n   MAC withdraw message
      processing is performed as described above.  The\n   acknowledgement is sent
      with the R-bit cleared.\n"
