Abstract This document defines the format for literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.
This format has been implemented in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed browsers including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.
It is also intended to be used in the IPv6 version of the service location protocol.
This document incudes an update to the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers defined in RFC 2396 [URL].
The textual representation defined for literal IPv6 addresses in [ARCH] is not directly compatible with URL's.
This document defines the format for literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.
The goal is to have a format that allows easy "cut" and "paste" operations with a minimum of editing of the literal address.
The format defined in this document has been implemented in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed browsers including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.
It is also intended to be used in the IPv6 version of the service location protocol.
1.1 Requirements The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, if and where they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].
World Wide Web browsers SHOULD implement the format of IPv6 literals in URL's defined in this document.
Other types of applications and protocols that use URL's MAY use this format.
Literal IPv6 Address Format in URL's Syntax
For example the following literal IPv6 addresses:
FEDC:BA98:7654:3210 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:4171 3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1 1080::8:800:200C:417A ::
192.9.5.5 ::FFFF:129.144.52.38 2010:836B:4179::836B:4179 would be represented as in the following example
This document updates the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers defined in RFC 2396 [URL].
(2) Replace the definition of 'IPv4address' with that of RFC 2373, as it correctly defines an IPv4address as consisting of at most three decimal digits per segment.
The use of this approach to represent literal IPv6 addresses in URL's does not introduce any known new security concerns.
