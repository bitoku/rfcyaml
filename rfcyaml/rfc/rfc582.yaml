    \ Readable Protocols\n   I fully support the requirement for machine-readable\
    \ protocol\n   documents.  In my situation, the line-printer is a much more reliable\n\
    \   device than the copying machine.\n   However, I object to the phrase \"preferably\
    \ as nls files\" in RFC 580.\n   My objection is based on the lack of conversion\
    \ mechanisms INTO NLS,\n   not to the retrieval process or NLS itself.\n   Most\
    \ sites have their own text editors and RUNOFF's (or their\n   equivalents). \
    \ Most large protocol documents are prepared at least\n   partially by secretarial\
    \ help.  Those persons should be able to\n   prepare the documents in the home\
    \ machine (or wherever) in languages\n   with which they are familiar.  There\
    \ should be a general program\n   (preferably clever, but at least generally available\
    \ and predictable)\n   for converting nicely formatted text to NLS files.\n  \
    \ Perhaps the program which receives mail for the journal will do the\n   trick;\
    \ if so it needs further documentation beyond the mail-oriented\n   RFC 543, and\
    \ its existence and usage need to be publicised.\n   RECEIVED AT NIC NOVEMBER\
    \ 14, 1973.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
    \ ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Lorrie Shiota 1/02 ]\n"
