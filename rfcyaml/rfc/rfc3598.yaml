  - "Abstract\n   On email systems that allow for \"subaddressing\" or \"detailed\n\
    \   addressing\" (e.g., \"ken+sieve@example.org\"), it is sometimes\n   desirable\
    \ to make comparisons against these sub-parts of addresses.\n   This document\
    \ defines an extension to the Sieve mail filtering\n   language that allows users\
    \ to compare against the user and detail\n   parts of an address.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Subaddressing is the practice of appending some \"detail\"\
    \ information\n   to the local-part of an [IMAIL] address to indicate that the\
    \ message\n   should be delivered to the mailbox specified by the \"detail\"\n\
    \   information.  The \"detail\" information is prefixed with a special\n   \"\
    separator character\" (typically \"+\") which forms the boundary\n   between the\
    \ \"user\" (original local-part) and the \"detail\" sub-parts\n   of the address,\
    \ much like the \"@\" character forms the boundary\n   between the local-part\
    \ and domain.\n   Typical uses of subaddressing might be:\n   -  A message addressed\
    \ to \"ken+sieve@example.org\" is delivered into a\n      mailbox called \"sieve\"\
    \ belonging to the user \"ken\".\n   -  A message addressed to \"5551212#123@example.org\"\
    \ is delivered to\n      the voice mailbox number \"123\" at phone number \"5551212\"\
    .\n   This document describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by\n\
    \   [SIEVE] for comparing against the \"user\" and \"detail\" sub-parts of an\n\
    \   address.\n   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including\n\
    \   use of [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 2.  Capability Identifier
  contents:
  - "2.  Capability Identifier\n   The capability string associated with the extension\
    \ defined in this\n   document is \"subaddress\".\n"
- title: 3.  Subaddress Comparisons
  contents:
  - "3.  Subaddress Comparisons\n   Commands that act exclusively on addresses may\
    \ take the optional\n   tagged arguments \":user\"  and \":detail\" to specify\
    \ what sub-part of\n   the local-part of the address will be acted upon.\n   NOTE:\
    \ In most cases, the envelope \"to\" address is the preferred\n   address to examine\
    \ for subaddress information when the desire is to\n   sort messages based on\
    \ how they were addressed so as to get to a\n   specific recipient.  The envelope\
    \ address is, after all, the reason a\n   given message is being processed by\
    \ a given sieve script for a given\n   user.  This is particularly true when mailing\
    \ lists, aliases, and\n   \"virtual domains\" are involved since the envelope\
    \ may be the only\n   source of detail information for the specific recipient.\n\
    \   The \":user\" argument specifies that sub-part of the local-part which\n \
    \  lies to the left of the separator character (e.g., \"ken\" in\n   \"ken+sieve@example.org\"\
    ).  If no separator character exists, then\n   \":user\" specifies the entire\
    \ left-side of the address (equivalent to\n   \":localpart\").\n   The \":detail\"\
    \ argument specifies that sub-part of the local-part\n   which lies to the right\
    \ of the separator character (e.g., \"sieve\" in\n   \"ken+sieve@example.org\"\
    ).  If no separator character exists, the test\n   evaluates to false.  If nothing\
    \ lies to the right of the separator\n   character, then \":detail\" \":is\" the\
    \ null key (\"\").  Otherwise, the\n   \":detail\" sub-part contains the null\
    \ key.\n   Implementations MUST make sure that the separator character matches\n\
    \   that which is used and/or allowed by the encompassing mail system,\n   otherwise\
    \ unexpected results might occur.  Implementations SHOULD\n   allow the separator\
    \ character to be configurable so that they may be\n   used with a variety of\
    \ mail systems.  Note that the mechanisms used\n   to define and/or query the\
    \ separator character used by the mail\n   system are outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   The \":user\" and \":detail\" address parts are subject to the\
    \ same rules\n   and restrictions as the standard address parts defined in [SIEVE].\n\
    \   For convenience, the \"ADDRESS-PART\" syntax element defined in [SIEVE]\n\
    \   is augmented here as follows:\n      ADDRESS-PART  =/  \":user\" / \":detail\"\
    \n   A diagram showing the ADDRESS-PARTs of a email address utilizing a\n   separator\
    \ character of '+' is shown below:\n       :user \"+\" :detail  \"@\" :domain\n\
    \      `-----------------'\n          :local-part\n   Example:\n   require \"\
    subaddress\";\n   # File mailing list messages (subscribed as \"ken+mta-filters\"\
    ).\n   if envelope :detail \"to\" \"mta-filters\" {\n     fileinto \"inbox.ietf-mta-filters\"\
    ;\n   }\n   # If a message is not to me (ignoring +detail), junk it.\n   if not\
    \ allof (address :user [\"to\", \"cc\", \"bcc\"] \"ken\",\n        address :domain\
    \ [\"to\", \"cc\", \"bcc\"] \"example.org\") {\n     discard;\n   }\n   # Redirect\
    \ all mail sent to +foo.\n   if envelope :detail [\"to\", \"cc\", \"bcc\"] \"\
    foo\" {\n     redirect \"ken@example.edu\";\n   }\n"
