  - "1.  Introduction\n   A networked application is a realization of some well defined\
    \ service\n   on one or more host computers that is accessible via some network,\n\
    \   uses some network for its internal operations, or both.\n   There are a wide\
    \ range of networked applications for which it is\n   appropriate to provide SNMP\
    \ monitoring of their network usage.  This\n   includes applications using both\
    \ TCP/IP and OSI networking.  This\n   document defines a MIB which contains the\
    \ elements common to the\n   monitoring of any network service application.  This\
    \ information\n   includes a table of all monitorable network service applications,\
    \ a\n   count of the associations (connections) to each application, and\n   basic\
    \ information about the parameters and status of each\n   application-related\
    \ association.\n   This MIB may be used on its own for any application, and for\
    \ most\n   simple applications this will suffice.  This MIB is also designed to\n\
    \   serve as a building block which can be used in conjunction with\n   application-specific\
    \ monitoring and management.  Two examples of this\n   are MIBs defining additional\
    \ variables for monitoring a Message\n   Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory\
    \ Service Agent (DSA)\n   service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature\
    \ will be\n   specified.\n   This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for\
    \ management of the\n   host or hosts the network service application runs on,\
    \ nor does it\n   provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide\
    \ something\n   other than a network service.  Host resource and general application\n\
    \   monitoring is handled by the Host Resources MIB at present;\n   development\
    \ of an additional application MIB is currently underway in\n   the IETF.\n"

- title: 3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of seven major\n   components.  They are:\n   o    RFC 1902\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n        describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.\n   o    RFC 1903 [2] defines textual\
    \ conventions for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1904 [3] defines conformance statements\
    \ for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1905 [4] defines  transport mappings for SNMPv2.\n\
    \   o    RFC 1906 [5] defines the protocol operations used for network\n     \
    \   access to managed objects.\n   o    RFC 1907 [6] defines the Management Information\
    \ Base for SNMPv2.\n   o    RFC 1908 [7] specifies coexistance between SNMP and\
    \ SNMPv2.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type\n   together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 4.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB
  contents:
  - "4.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB\n   Much effort has\
    \ been expended in developing tools to manage lower\n   layer network facilities.\
    \  However, relatively little work has been\n   done on managing application layer\
    \ entities.  It is neither efficient\n   nor reasonable to manage all aspects\
    \ of application layer entities\n   using only lower layer information. Moreover,\
    \ the difficulty of\n   managing application entities in this way increases dramatically\
    \ as\n   application entities become more complex.\n   This leads to a substantial\
    \ need to monitor applications which\n   provide network services, particularly\
    \ distributed components such as\n   MTAs and DSAs, by monitoring specific aspects\
    \ of the application\n   itself.  Reasons to monitor such components include but\
    \ are not\n   limited to measuring load, detecting broken connectivity, isolating\n\
    \   system failures, and locating congestion.\n   In order to manage network service\
    \ applications effectively two\n   requirements must be met:\n    (1)   It must\
    \ be possible to monitor a large number of components\n          (typical for\
    \ a large organization).\n    (2)   Application monitoring must be integrated\
    \ into general network\n          management.\n   This specification defines simple\
    \ read-only access; this is\n   sufficient to determine up/down status and provide\
    \ an indication of a\n   broad class of operational problems.\n"
- title: 4.1.  General Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB is intended to only provide\
    \ facilities common to the\n   monitoring of any network service application.\
    \  It does not provide\n   all the facilities necessary to monitor any specific\
    \ application.\n   Each specific type of network service application is expected\
    \ to have\n   a MIB of its own that makes use of these common facilities.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Restriction of Scope
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Restriction of Scope\n   The framework provided here is very minimal; there\
    \ is a lot more that\n   could be done. For example:\n    (1)   General network\
    \ service application configuration monitoring\n          and control.\n    (2)\
    \   Detailed examination and modification of individual entries in\n         \
    \ service-specific request queues.\n    (3)   Probing to determine the status\
    \ of a specific request (e.g.\n          the location of a mail message with a\
    \ specific message-id).\n    (4)   Requesting that certain actions be performed\
    \ (e.g. forcing an\n          immediate connection and transfer of pending messages\
    \ to some\n          specific system).\n   All these capabilities are both impressive\
    \ and useful.  However,\n   these capabilities would require provisions for strict\
    \ security\n   checking.  These capabilities would also mandate a much more complex\n\
    \   design, with many characteristics likely to be fairly\n   implementation-specific.\
    \  As a result such facilities are likely to\n   be both contentious and difficult\
    \ to implement.\n   This document religiously keeps things simple and focuses\
    \ on the\n   basic monitoring aspect of managing applications providing network\n\
    \   services.  The goal here is to provide a framework which is simple,\n   useful,\
    \ and widely implementable.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Configuration Information
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Configuration Information\n   This MIB attempts to provide information\
    \ about the operational\n   aspects of an application. Further information about\
    \ the actual\n   configuration of a given application may be kept in other places;\
    \ the\n   applDirectoryName or applURL may be used to point to places where\n\
    \   such information is kept.\n"
- title: 5.  Application Objects
  contents:
  - "5.  Application Objects\n   This MIB defines a set of general purpose attributes\
    \ which would be\n   appropriate for a range of applications that provide network\n\
    \   services.  Both OSI and non-OSI services can be accomodated.\n   Additional\
    \ tables defined in extensions to this MIB provide\n   attributes specific to\
    \ specific network services.\n   A table is defined which will have one row for\
    \ each operational\n   network service application on the system.  The only static\n\
    \   information held on the application is its name.  All other static\n   information\
    \ should be obtained from various directory services.  The\n   applDirectoryName\
    \ is an external key, which allows an SNMP MIB entry\n   to be cleanly related\
    \ to the X.500 Directory.  In SNMP terms, the\n   applications are grouped in\
    \ a table called applTable, which is\n   indexed by an integer key applIndex.\n\
    \   The type of the application will be determined by one or both of:\n    (1)\
    \   Additional MIB variables specific to the applications.\n    (2)   An association\
    \ to the application of a specific protocol.\n"

  - "7.  Changes made since RFC 1565\n   The only changes made to this document since\
    \ it was issued as RFC\n   1565 [11] are the following:\n    (1)   applDescription\
    \ and applURL fields have been added.  These\n          fields are intended to\
    \ identify and describe the application.\n    (2)   A number of DESCRIPTION fields\
    \ have been reworded, hopefully\n          making them clearer.\n    (3)   The\
    \ new \"quiescing\" state has been added to applOperStatus.\n    (4)   The prose\
    \ about \"dynamic single threaded processes\" has been\n          removed -- it\
    \ was simply too confusing.\n    (5)   Various RFC references have been updated\
    \ to refer to more\n          recent versions.\n    (6)   The MIB has been renamed\
    \ from APPLICATION-MIB to NETWORK-\n          SERVICES-MIB.  This was done because\
    \ an application MIB is now\n          under development within the IETF that\
    \ provides very different\n          functionality from this MIB.\n"
