    \ THE  UNIX  TIME-SHARING  SYSTEM  [1] PRESENTS SEVERAL INTERESTING\n   CAPABILITIES\
    \ AS AN ARPA NETWORK MINI-HOST.   IT  OFFERS POWERFUL\n   LOCAL  PROCESSING FACILITIES\
    \ IN TERMS OF USER PROGRAMS, SEVERAL\n   COMPILERS, AN EDITOR BASED ON QED, A\
    \  VERSATILE  DOCUMENT\n   PREPARATION  SYSTEM,  AND  AN EFFICIENT FILE SYSTEM\
    \ FEATURING\n   SOPHISTICATED ACCESS CONTROL, MOUNTABLE AND DE-MOUNTABLE\n   VOLUMES,\
    \ AND A UNIFIED TREATMENT OF PERIPHERALS AS SPECIAL FILES.  3a\n   THE NETWORK\
    \ CONTROL PROGRAM (NCP), IS  INTEGRATED  WITHIN THE\n   UNIX FILE SYSTEM.  NETWORK\
    \ CONNECTIONS ARE TREATED AS SPECIAL\n   FILES WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH STANDARD\
    \ UNIX I/O CALLS; VIZ.\n   READ,  WRITE,  OPEN, CLOSE.  SPECIAL FILES HAVE DIRECTORY\
    \ ENTRIES\n   SIMILAR TO NORMAL FILES EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN FLAG  BITS  ARE  SET.\n\
    \   THESE FLAG BITS CAUSE SYSTEM I/O ROUTINES TO TAKE SPECIAL ACTION.\n   IN UNIX,\
    \ SPECIAL FILES SIGNIFY PERIPHERAL DEVICES.  FOR  EXAMPLE,\n   I/O  TRANSACTION\
    \  WITH  MAGTAPE ZERO WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY\n   ACCESSING THE SPECIAL FILE,\
    \ \"/DEV/MT0\".  FOR THE UNIX NETWORK\n   SYSTEM,  ADDITIONAL  SPECIAL FILES WERE\
    \ CREATED EACH OF WHICH\n   SPECIFIES A HOST ON THE  ARPA  NETWORK.  FOR  EXAMPLE\n\
    \   \"/DEV/NET/HARV\" REPRESENTS  THE PDP-10 AT HARVARD.  THIS SIMPLE\n   ACCESS\
    \ MECHANISM, THROUGH THE FILING SYSTEM, ALLOWS STANDARD ARPA\n   PROTOCOLS SUCH\
    \ AS TELNET  AND  FTP  TO  BE  IMPLEMENTED AS\n   SWAPPABLE USER PROGRAMS, RESIDENT\
    \ ONLY WHEN NEEDED.  FURTHERMORE,\n   A USER MAY WRITE HIS OWN PROGRAMS TO COMMUNICATE\
    \ WITH THESE\n   SPECIAL FILES JUST AS THE TELNET PROGRAM DOES.  THE SAMPLE\n\
    \   PROGRAM  FOUND BELOW  DEPICTS  THE ESSENTIALS OF NETWORKING FROM\n   UNIX.\
    \                                                              3b\n"

    \ WITH  THE  ADVENT OF TELNET IN UNIX, CURRENT PLANS ARE TO RUN THE\n   SYSTEM\
    \ OVER THE NEXT ONE OR TWO MONTHS AND WORK  OUT  ANY\n   REMAINING  BUGS.  WHILE\
    \  THIS IS GOING ON, EXTENSIVE BANDWITH AND\n   LOAD  TESTING  IS  GOING  TO \
    \ TAKE  PLACE  AND   ANY   REASONABLE\n   IMPROVEMENTS MADE.                 \
    \                               10a\n   AFTER TELNET HAS PROVED ITSELF RELIABLE,\
    \ THE OPEN  SYSTEM CALL\n   WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FURTHER PARAMETERIZATION.\
    \  THIS\n   PARAMETERIZATION WILL ENCOMPASS CONNECTIONS TO SPECIFIC  SOCKETS,\n\
    \   SIMPLEX  CONNECTIONS  BASED  ON  A SOCKET ALREADY IN USE, AND THE\n   ABILITY\
    \ TO LISTEN ON A LOCAL SOCKET.                              10b\n   AFTER  THOSE\
    \  EXTENSIONS,  NET MAIL, THEN NETWORK FTP AND FINALLY\n   NETWORK RJE WILL BE\
    \ IMPLEMENTED.  ALL WILL  RUN  AS  USER\n   PROGRAMS SO THE KERNEL SYSTEM SIZE\
    \ WILL NOT INCREASE.             10c\n   THERE IS ALSO INTEREST IN IMPLEMENTING\
    \ SOME OF  THE  PROCEDURE\n   CALL  PROTOCOL  BEING  DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL\
    \ SOFTWARE WORKS,\n   BUT NO DEFINATE PLAN HAVE BEEN MADE.                   \
