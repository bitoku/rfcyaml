Abstract This document updates BCP 101 to take account of the new IETF Intellectual Property Trust.
The first version of BCP 101, i.e., RFC 4071 [1], assumed that the vehicle for certain IETF related Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) would be the Internet Society (ISOC).
Since that time, an IETF Trust has been created to hold such IPR.
This document appropriately updates RFC 4071.
This update comes into force as soon as it has been approved by the IESG and the IETF Trust Agreement [2] has been formally signed by its Settlors and initial Trustees.
Terms and abbreviations used in this document are defined in RFC 4071.
A Trust ("the IETF Trust") has been formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and future intellectual property and other property used in connection with the administration of the IETF.
The Trust was formed by the signatures of its Settlors and initial Trustees.
The Settlors, who contributed initial intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives.
The Trustees of the IETF Trust are the members of the IAOC, and the Beneficiary of the IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.
In its administration of IPR under the terms of BCP 101, the IASA, including the IAD and the IAOC, will treat the IETF Trust rather than ISOC as the proper entity for ownership and licensing of IETF IPR.
Specifically, references to ISOC in sections 3.1, 5.3, and 7 of [1] shall be interpreted as referring to the IETF Trust wherever IPR issues are concerned.
The duty to serve as Trustees is added to section 3.2 of [1].
This document has no security implications for the Internet.
