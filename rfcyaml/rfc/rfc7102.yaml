- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides a glossary of terminology used in\
    \ routing\n   requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low-Power\
    \ and\n   Lossy Networks (LLNs).\n   LLNs are typically composed of many embedded\
    \ devices with limited\n   power, memory, and processing resources interconnected\
    \ by a variety\n   of links, such as IEEE 802.15.4 or low-power Wi-Fi.  There\
    \ is a wide\n   scope of application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring,\n\
    \   building automation (heating, ventilation, air conditioning,\n   lighting,\
    \ access control, fire), connected home, health care,\n   environmental monitoring,\
    \ urban sensor networks, energy management,\n   assets tracking, and refrigeration.\n\
    \   Since these applications are usually highly specific (for example,\n   industrial\
    \ automation, building automation, etc.), it is not uncommon\n   to see a number\
    \ of disparate terms used to describe the same device\n   or functionality.  Thus,\
    \ in order to avoid confusion or\n   discrepancies, this document specifies the\
    \ common terminology to be\n   used in all ROLL working group documents.  The\
    \ terms defined in this\n   document are used in [RFC5548], [RFC5673], [RFC5826],\
    \ and [RFC5867].\n   Terminology specific to a particular application is out of\
    \ the scope\n   of this document.\n   It is expected that all routing documents\
    \ defining requirements or\n   specifying solutions for LLN will use the common\
    \ terminology\n   specified in this document.  This document should be listed\
    \ as an\n   informative reference.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Actuator: A field device that controls a set of equipment.\
    \  For\n      example, an actuator might control and/or modulate the flow of a\n\
    \      gas or liquid, control electricity distribution, perform a\n      mechanical\
    \ operation, etc.\n   AMI: Advanced Metering Infrastructure.  Makes use of Smart\
    \ Grid\n      technologies.  A canonical Smart Grid application is smart-\n  \
    \    metering.\n   Channel: Radio frequency sub-band used to transmit a modulated\
    \ signal\n      carrying packets.\n   Channel Hopping: A procedure by which field\
    \ devices synchronously\n      change channels during operation.\n   Commissioning\
    \ Tool: Any physical or logical device temporarily added\n      to the network\
    \ for the express purpose of setting up the network\n      and device operational\
    \ parameters.  The commissioning tool can\n      also be temporarily added to\
    \ the LLN for scheduled or unscheduled\n      maintenance.\n   Closed Loop Control:\
    \ A procedure whereby a device controller controls\n      an actuator based on\
    \ input information sensed by one or more field\n      devices.\n   Controller:\
    \ A field device that can receive sensor input and\n      automatically change\
    \ the environment in the facility by\n      manipulating digital or analog actuators.\n\
    \   DA: Distribution Automation.  Part of Smart Grid.  Encompasses\n      technologies\
    \ for maintenance and management of electrical\n      distribution systems.\n\
    \   DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph.  A directed graph with no directed\n      cycles\
    \ (a graph formed by a collection of vertices and directed\n      edges where\
    \ each edge connects one vertex to another, such that\n      there is no way to\
    \ start at some vertex v and follow a sequence of\n      edges that eventually\
    \ loops back to vertex v again).\n   Data sink: A device that collects data from\
    \ nodes in an LLN.\n   Downstream: Data direction traveling from outside of the\
    \ LLN (e.g.,\n      traffic coming from a LAN, WAN, or the Internet) via an LLN\
    \ Border\n      Router (LBR), or in general, \"deeper\" in the Directed Acyclic\n\
    \      Graph computed by the routing protocol.\n   Field Device: A field device\
    \ is a physical device placed in the\n      network's operating environment (e.g.,\
    \ plant, urban area, or\n      home).  Field devices include sensors and actuators\
    \ as well as\n      routers and Low-Power and Lossy Network Border Routers (LBRs).\
    \  A\n      field device is usually (but not always) a device with constrained\n\
    \      CPU, memory footprint, storage capacity, bandwidth, and sometimes\n   \
    \   power (battery operated).  At the time of writing, for the sake of\n     \
    \ illustration, a typical sensor or actuator would have a few\n      Kilobytes\
    \ of RAM, a few dozens of Kilobytes of ROM/Flash memory, a\n      8-/16-/32-bit\
    \ microcontroller, and communication capabilities\n      ranging from a few kbits/s\
    \ to a few hundred kbits/s.  Although\n      continuous improvement of hardware\
    \ and software technologies is\n      expected, such devices will likely continue\
    \ to be seen as\n      resource-constrained devices compared to computers and\
    \ routers\n      used in the rest of the Internet.\n   Flash Memory: non-volatile\
    \ memory that can be re-programmed.\n   FMS: Facility Management System.  A global\
    \ term applied across all\n      the vertical designations within a building,\
    \ including heating,\n      ventilation, and air conditioning (also referred to\
    \ as HVAC),\n      fire, security, lighting, and elevator control.\n   HART: Highway\
    \ Addressable Remote Transducer.  A group of\n      specifications for industrial\
    \ process and control devices\n      administered by the HART Foundation (see\
    \ [HART]).  The latest\n      version for the specifications is HART7, which includes\
    \ the\n      additions for WirelessHART.\n   HVAC: Heating, Ventilation, and Air\
    \ Conditioning.  A term applied to\n      mechanisms used to maintain the comfort\
    \ level of an internal\n      space.\n   ISA: International Society of Automation.\
    \  An ANSI accredited\n      standards-making society.  ISA100 is an ISA committee\
    \ whose\n      charter includes defining a family of standards for industrial\n\
    \      automation.  [ISA100.11a] is a working group within ISA100 that is\n  \
    \    working on a standard for monitoring and non-critical process-\n      control\
    \ applications.\n   LAN: Local Area Network.\n   LBR: Low-Power and Lossy Network\
    \ Border Router.  A device that\n      connects the Low-Power and Lossy Network\
    \ to another routing domain\n      such as a LAN, a WAN, or the Internet where\
    \ a different routing\n      protocol may be in operation.  The LBR acts as a\
    \ routing device\n      and may possibly host other functions such as data collector\
    \ or\n      aggregator.\n   LLN: Low-Power and Lossy Network.  Typically composed\
    \ of many\n      embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing\n\
    \      resources interconnected by a variety of links, such as IEEE\n      802.15.4\
    \ or low-power Wi-Fi.  There is a wide scope of application\n      areas for LLNs,\
    \ including industrial monitoring, building\n      automation (HVAC, lighting,\
    \ access control, fire), connected home,\n      health care, environmental monitoring,\
    \ urban sensor networks,\n      energy management, assets tracking, and refrigeration.\n\
    \   MP2P: Multipoint-to-Point.  Used to describe a particular traffic\n      pattern\
    \ (e.g., MP2P flows collecting information from many nodes\n      flowing upstream\
    \ towards a collecting sink or an LBR).\n   MAC: Medium Access Control.  Refers\
    \ to algorithms and procedures used\n      by the data link layer to coordinate\
    \ use of the physical layer.\n   Non-Sleepy Node: A node that always remains in\
    \ a fully powered-on\n      state (i.e., always awake) where it has the capability\
    \ to perform\n      communication.\n   Open Loop Control: A process whereby a\
    \ plant operator manually\n      manipulates an actuator over the network where\
    \ the decision is\n      influenced by information sensed by field devices.\n\
    \   PER: Packet Error Rate.  A ratio of the number of unusable packets\n     \
    \ (not received at all or received in error, even after any\n      applicable\
    \ error correction has been applied) to the total number\n      of packets that\
    \ would have been received in the absence of errors.\n   P2P: Point To Point.\
    \  Refers to traffic exchanged between two nodes\n      (regardless of the number\
    \ of hops between the two nodes).\n   P2MP: Point-to-Multipoint.  Refers to traffic\
    \ between one node and a\n      set of nodes.  This is similar to the P2MP concept\
    \ in Multicast or\n      MPLS Traffic Engineering ([RFC4461]and [RFC4875]).  A\
    \ common use\n      case for the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks\n\
    \      (RPL) involves P2MP flows from or through a DAG root outward\n      towards\
    \ other nodes contained in the DAG.\n   RAM: Random Access Memory.  A volatile\
    \ memory.\n   RFID: Radio Frequency IDentification.\n   ROM: Read-Only Memory.\n\
    \   ROLL: Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Networks.\n   RPL: An IPv6 Routing\
    \ Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks that\n      provides a mechanism whereby\
    \ multipoint-to-point traffic from\n      devices inside the LLN towards a central\
    \ control point as well as\n      point-to-multipoint traffic from the central\
    \ control point to the\n      devices inside the LLN are supported.  RPL also\
    \ supports point-to-\n      point traffic between any arbitrary nodes in the LLN.\n\
    \   RPL Domain: A collection of RPL routers under the control of a single\n  \
    \    administration.  The boundaries of routing domains are defined by\n     \
    \ network management by setting some links to be exterior, or inter-\n      domain,\
    \ links.\n   Schedule: An agreed execution, wake-up, transmission, reception,\n\
    \      etc., timetable between two or more field devices.\n   Sensor: A device\
    \ that measures a physical quantity and converts it to\n      an analog or digital\
    \ signal that can be read by a program or a\n      user.  Sensed data can be of\
    \ many types: electromagnetic (e.g.,\n      current, voltage, power, or resistance),\
    \ mechanical (e.g.,\n      pressure, flow, liquid density, or humidity), chemical\
    \ (e.g.,\n      oxygen or carbon monoxide), acoustic (e.g., noise or ultrasound),\n\
    \      etc.\n   Sleepy Node: A node that may sometimes go into a sleep mode (i.e.,\
    \ go\n      into a low-power state to conserve power) and temporarily suspend\n\
    \      protocol communication.  When not in sleep mode, the sleepy node\n    \
    \  is in a fully powered-on state where it has the capability to\n      perform\
    \ communication.\n   Smart Grid: A broad class of applications to network and\
    \ automate\n      utility infrastructure.\n   Timeslot: A fixed time interval\
    \ that may be used for the transmission\n      or reception of a packet between\
    \ two field devices.  A timeslot\n      used for communications is associated\
    \ with a slotted-link.\n   Upstream: Data direction traveling from the LLN via\
    \ the LBR to\n      outside of the LLN (LAN, WAN, or Internet) or generally closer\
    \ to\n      the root of the DAG computed by the routing protocol.\n   WAN: Wide\
    \ Area Network.\n"
