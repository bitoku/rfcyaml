- title: 1.  Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   SMTP was defined as a message *transfer* protocol, that is,\
    \ a means\n   to route (if needed) and deliver finished (complete) messages.\n\
    \   Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) are not supposed to alter the message\n   text,\
    \ except to add 'Received', 'Return-Path', and other header\n   fields as required\
    \ by [SMTP-MTA].\n   However, SMTP is now also widely used as a message *submission*\n\
    \   protocol, that is, a means for message user agents (MUAs) to\n   introduce\
    \ new messages into the MTA routing network.  The process\n   which accepts message\
    \ submissions from MUAs is termed a Message\n   Submission Agent (MSA).\n   Messages\
    \ being submitted are in some cases finished (complete)\n   messages, and in other\
    \ cases are unfinished (incomplete) in some\n   aspect or other.  Unfinished messages\
    \ need to be completed to ensure\n   they conform to [MESSAGE-FORMAT], and later\
    \ requirements.  For\n   example, the message may lack a proper 'Date' header\
    \ field, and\n   domains might not be fully qualified.  In some cases, the MUA\
    \ may be\n   unable to generate finished messages (for example, it might not know\n\
    \   its time zone).  Even when submitted messages are complete, local\n   site\
    \ policy may dictate that the message text be examined or modified\n   in some\
    \ way.  Such completions or modifications have been shown to\n   cause harm when\
    \ performed by downstream MTAs -- that is, MTAs after\n   the first-hop submission\
    \ MTA -- and are in general considered to be\n   outside the province of standardized\
    \ MTA functionality.\n   Separating messages into submissions and transfers allows\
    \ developers\n   and network administrators to more easily:\n   *   Implement\
    \ security policies and guard against unauthorized mail\n       relaying or injection\
    \ of unsolicited bulk mail\n   *   Implement authenticated submission, including\
    \ off-site submission\n       by authorized users such as travelers\n   *   Separate\
    \ the relevant software code differences, thereby making\n       each code base\
    \ more straightforward and allowing for different\n       programs for relay and\
    \ submission\n   *   Detect configuration problems with a site's mail clients\n\
    \   *   Provide a basis for adding enhanced submission services in the\n     \
    \  future\n   This memo describes a low cost, deterministic means for messages\
    \ to\n   be identified as submissions, and specifies what actions are to be\n\
    \   taken by a submission server.\n   Public comments should be sent to the IETF\
    \ Submit mailing list,\n   <ietf-submit@imc.org>.  To subscribe, send a message\
    \ containing\n   SUBSCRIBE to <ietf-submit-request@imc.org>.  Private comments\
    \ may be\n   sent to the authors.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Submission Identification\n   Port 587 is reserved for email message submission\
    \ as specified in\n   this document.  Messages received on this port are defined\
    \ to be\n   submissions.  The protocol used is ESMTP [SMTP-MTA, ESMTP], with\n\
    \   additional restrictions as specified here.\n   While most email clients and\
    \ servers can be configured to use port\n   587 instead of 25, there are cases\
    \ where this is not possible or\n   convenient.  A site MAY choose to use port\
    \ 25 for message submission,\n   by designating some hosts to be MSAs and others\
    \ to be MTAs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing\n   MTAs and MSAs MAY implement message\
    \ rejection rules that rely in part\n   on whether the message is a submission\
    \ or a relay.\n   For example, some sites might configure their MTA to reject\
    \ all RCPT\n   TOs for messages that do not reference local users, and configure\n\
    \   their MSA to reject all message submissions that do not come from\n   authorized\
    \ users, based on IP address, or authenticated identity.\n   NOTE:  It is better\
    \ to reject a message than to risk sending one that\n   is damaged.  This is especially\
    \ true for problems that are\n   correctable by the MUA, for example, an invalid\
    \ 'From' field.\n   If an MSA is not able to determine a return path to the submitting\n\
    \   user, from a valid MAIL FROM, a valid source IP address, or based on\n   authenticated\
    \ identity, then the MSA SHOULD immediately reject the\n   message.  A message\
    \ can be immediately rejected by returning a 550\n   code to the MAIL FROM command.\n\
    \   Note that a null return path, that is, MAIL FROM:<>, is permitted\n   and\
    \ MUST be accepted. (MUAs need to generate null return-path\n   messages for a\
    \ variety of reasons, including disposition\n   notifications.)\n   Except in\
    \ the case where the MSA is unable to determine a valid\n   return path for the\
    \ message being submitted, text in this\n   specification which instructs an MSA\
    \ to issue a rejection code MAY be\n   complied with by accepting the message\
    \ and subsequently generating a\n   bounce message. (That is, if the MSA is going\
    \ to reject a message for\n   any reason except being unable to determine a return\
    \ path, it can\n   optionally do an immediate rejection or accept the message\
    \ and then\n   mail a bounce.)\n   NOTE:  In the normal case of message submission,\
    \ immediately\n   rejecting the message is preferred, as it gives the user and\
    \ MUA\n   direct feedback.  To properly handle delayed bounces the client MUA\n\
    \   must maintain a queue of messages it has submitted, and match bounces\n  \
    \ to them.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Authorized Submission
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Authorized Submission\n   Numerous methods have been used to ensure that\
    \ only authorized users\n   are able to submit messages.  These methods include\
    \ authenticated\n   SMTP, IP address restrictions, secure IP, and prior POP\n\
    \   authentication.\n   Authenticated SMTP [SMTP-AUTH] has been proposed.  It\
    \ allows the MSA\n   to determine an authorization identity for the message submission,\n\
    \   which is not tied to other protocols.\n   IP address restrictions are very\
    \ widely implemented, but do not allow\n   for travellers and similar situations,\
    \ and can be spoofed.\n   Secure IP [IPSEC] can also be used, and provides additional\
    \ benefits\n   of protection against eavesdropping and traffic analysis.\n   Requiring\
    \ a POP [POP3] authentication (from the same IP address)\n   within some amount\
    \ of time (for example, 20 minutes) prior to the\n   start of a message submission\
    \ session has also been used, but this\n   does impose restrictions on clients\
    \ as well as servers which may\n   cause difficulties.  Specifically, the client\
    \ must do a POP\n   authentication before an SMTP submission session, and not\
    \ all clients\n   are capable and configured for this.  Also, the MSA must coordinate\n\
    \   with the POP server, which may be difficult.  There is also a window\n   during\
    \ which an unauthorized user can submit messages and appear to\n   be a prior\
    \ authorized user.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Enhanced Status Codes
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Enhanced Status Codes\n   This memo suggests several enhanced status codes\
    \ [SMTP-CODES] for\n   submission-specific rejections.  The specific codes used\
    \ are:\n    5.6.0  Bad content.  The content of the header or text is\n      \
    \     improper.\n    5.6.2  Bad domain or address.  Invalid or improper domain\
    \ or address\n           in MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA.\n    5.7.1  Not allowed.\
    \  The address in MAIL FROM appears to have\n           insufficient submission\
    \ rights, or is invalid, or is not\n           authorized with the authentication\
    \ used; the address in a\n           RCPT TO command is inconsistent with the\
    \ permissions given to\n           the user; the message data is rejected based\
    \ on the\n           submitting user.\n    5.7.0  Site policy.  The message appears\
    \ to violate site policy in\n           some way.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Submission Rejection Code\n   Unless covered by a more precise\
    \ response code, response code 554 is\n   to be used to reject a MAIL FROM, RCPT\

    \ 5.6.0 is to be\n   used if no other code is more specific.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Ensure All Domains are Fully-Qualified
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Ensure All Domains are Fully-Qualified\n   The MSA MUST ensure that all\
    \ domains in the envelope are fully-\n   qualified.\n   If the MSA examines or\
    \ alters the message text in way, except to add\n   trace header fields [SMTP-MTA],\
    \ it MUST ensure that all domains in\n   address header fields are fully-qualified.\n\
    \   Reply code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, or DATA\n   command\
    \ which contains improper domain references.\n   NOTE:  A frequent local convention\
    \ is to accept single-level domains\n   (for example, 'sales') and then to expand\
    \ the reference by adding the\n   remaining portion of the domain name (for example,\
    \ to\n   'sales.example.net').  Local conventions that permit single-level\n \
    \  domains SHOULD reject, rather than expand, incomplete multi-level\n   domains,\
    \ since such expansion is particularly risky.\n"

    \ indiscriminately\n   appending a domain to an address or element which lacks\

  contents:
  - "8.6.  Encrypt the Message\n   The MSA MAY encrypt the message for transport to\
    \ reflect\n   organizational policies.\n   NOTE:  To be useful, the addition of\
    \ a signature and/or encryption by\n   the MSA generally implies that the connection\
    \ between the MUA and MSA\n   must itself be secured in some other way, e.g.,\
    \ by operating inside\n   of a secure environment, by securing the submission\
    \ connection at the\n   transport layer, or by using an [SMTP-AUTH] mechanism\
    \ that provides\n   for session integrity.\n"
- title: 8.7.  Resolve Aliases
  contents:
  - "8.7.  Resolve Aliases\n   The MSA MAY resolve aliases (CNAME records) for domain\
    \ names, in the\n   envelope and optionally in address fields of the header, subject\
    \ to\n   local policy.\n   NOTE:  Unconditionally resolving aliases could be harmful.\
    \  For\n   example, if www.example.net and ftp.example.net are both aliases for\n\
    \   mail.example.net, rewriting them could lose useful information.\n"
- title: 8.8.  Header Rewriting
  contents:
  - "8.8.  Header Rewriting\n   The MSA MAY rewrite local parts and/or domains, in\
    \ the envelope and\n   optionally in address fields of the header, according to\
    \ local\n   policy.  For example, a site may prefer to rewrite 'JRU' as '\n  \
    \ J.Random.User' in order to hide logon names, and/or to rewrite '\n   squeeky.sales.example.net'\
    \ as 'zyx.example.net' to hide machine names\n   and make it easier to move users.\n\
    \   However, only addresses, local-parts, or domains which match specific\n  \
    \ local MSA configuration settings should be altered.  It would be very\n   dangerous\
    \ for the MSA to apply data-independent rewriting rules, such\n   as always deleting\
    \ the first element of a domain name.  So, for\n   example, a rule which strips\
    \ the left-most element of the domain if\n   the complete domain matches '*.foo.example.net'\
    \ would be acceptable.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Separation of submission and relay of messages\
    \ can allow a site to\n   implement different policies for the two types of services,\
    \ including\n   requiring use of additional security mechanisms for one or both.\
    \  It\n   can do this in a way which is simpler, both technically and\n   administratively.\
    \  This increases the likelihood that policies will\n   be applied correctly.\n\
    \   Separation also can aid in tracking and preventing unsolicited bulk\n   email.\n\
    \   For example, a site could configure its MSA to require authentication\n  \
    \ before accepting a message, and could configure its MTA to reject all\n   RCPT\
    \ TOs for non-local users.  This can be an important element in a\n   site's total\
    \ email security policy.\n   If a site fails to require any form of authorization\
    \ for message\n   submissions (see section 3.3 for discussion), it is allowing\
    \ open use\n   of its resources and name; unsolicited bulk email can be injected\n\
    \   using its facilities.\n"
