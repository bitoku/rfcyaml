  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an extension block for use with the\
    \ Bundle\n   Protocol [RFC5050] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Networking\n\
    \   architecture [RFC4838].  The DTN Bundle Protocol defines the bundle\n   as\
    \ its protocol data unit and defines \"bundle blocks\" to carry data\n   of different\
    \ types.  This document defines an optional bundle block\n   called a Previous-Hop\
    \ Insertion Block (PHIB).\n   The PHIB is inserted into a bundle by a forwarding\
    \ node to provide\n   the endpoint identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the\
    \ forwarding\n   node is a member so that this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop\n\
    \   receiving node.  (Hereafter, an EID of an endpoint of which a node is\n  \
    \ a member will be referred to as an \"M-EID\" of that node.  A node may\n   have\
    \ one or more M-EIDs, depending on the number of endpoints to\n   which it belongs.\
    \  An EID of a singleton endpoint of which a node is\n   a member will be referred\
    \ to as a \"singleton M-EID\" of that node.)\n   In situations where there is\
    \ a requirement that the receiving node be\n   able to determine an M-EID of a\
    \ forwarding node, but the M-EID of the\n   forwarding node cannot be inferred\
    \ by the receiving node through\n   existing mechanisms, the forwarding node must\
    \ explicitly provide this\n   M-EID in the bundle.  This specification defines\
    \ the mechanism\n   whereby a node can insert such an M-EID into a bundle before\n\
    \   forwarding it to the bundle's next hop.\n   This previous-hop M-EID information\
    \ may be used in some circumstances\n   to support various routing protocols.\
    \  For example, the PHIB could be\n   helpful when implementing flood routing\
    \ because each receiving node\n   could use the PHIB to determine which EID to\
    \ exclude from the list of\n   adjacent nodes to which it forwards received bundles\
    \ as it does its\n   part in flooding the bundle.  A node will flood the bundle\
    \ to all\n   neighboring nodes except for the node from which it received the\n\
    \   bundle, as identified in the PHIB.\n   The PHIB could also be used in conjunction\
    \ with the Bundle\n   Authentication Block (BAB) of the DTN Bundle Security Protocol\n\
    \   [DTNBSP] to provide the security-source EID for the BAB.  The PHIB\n   can\
    \ be used to carry the BAB's security-source EID instead of\n   conveying this\
    \ EID using a reference in the BAB's EID-reference field\n   or including the\
    \ EID as part of the BAB's key-information parameters.\n   In many situations,\
    \ a node that receives a bundle may be able to\n   infer an M-EID of the node\
    \ that forwarded the bundle.  In some\n   situations, however, no M-EID will be\
    \ able to be inferred by the\n   receiving node.  For example, if tunneling DTN\
    \ bundles across some\n   portion of the DTN network, it is not possible for the\
    \ node at the\n   receiving end of the tunnel to determine from the convergence\
    \ layer\n   the M-EID of the node at the sending end of the tunnel.  The node\
    \ at\n   the receiving end of the tunnel will receive an encapsulating bundle\n\
    \   from one of its adjacent nodes, and it may be able to tell the M-EID\n   of\
    \ this adjacent node using the convergence-layer protocol.  However,\n   the node\
    \ at the sending end of the tunnel is most likely not adjacent\n   to the node\
    \ at the receiving end of the tunnel, so in order for the\n   node at the receiving\
    \ end of the tunnel to be able to learn the M-EID\n   of the node at the sending\
    \ end of the tunnel, which is the previous-\n   hop node of the tunneled bundle,\
    \ the M-EID must be provided within\n   the tunneled bundle.  In this case, the\
    \ PHIB is the vehicle for\n   enabling the node at the sending end of the tunnel\
    \ to provide its\n   M-EID to the node at the receiving end of the tunnel.\n \
    \  EIDs may be presented in two ways within the PHIB.  If the M-EID of\n   the\
    \ forwarding node is already in the Dictionary field of the\n   bundle's primary\
    \ bundle block, the PHIB MAY identify this EID using\n   its Block EID-reference\
    \ count and EID-reference field.  Otherwise,\n   the PHIB MUST identify this EID\
    \ by providing the EID in its block-\n   type-specific data field.  These two\
    \ alternative ways of presenting\n   EIDs in the PHIB are further discussed in\
    \ Section 3.\n   The lifetime of the PHIB is always exactly one hop in the DTN.\
    \  If a\n   bundle containing a PHIB is received, the receiving node is assured\n\
    \   that this PHIB was inserted by the previous node, assuming all nodes\n   are\
    \ operating correctly; likewise, this PHIB is not retained with the\n   bundle\
    \ when the bundle is forwarded.  If the bundle is forwarded with\n   a PHIB, this\
    \ PHIB MUST identify an M-EID of the forwarding node.\n   This document defines\
    \ the format and processing of the PHIB.  The\n   capabilities described in this\
    \ document are OPTIONAL for deployment\n   with the Bundle Protocol.  Bundle Protocol\
    \ implementations claiming\n   to support the PHIB MUST be capable of:\n   o \
    \ generating a PHIB and inserting it into a bundle,\n   o  receiving bundles containing\
    \ a PHIB and making the information\n      contained in this PHIB available for\
    \ use, e.g., in forwarding\n      decisions, and\n   o  deleting a PHIB from a\
    \ bundle\n   as defined in this document.\n"

- title: 2.  Previous-Hop Insertion Block Format
  contents:
  - "2.  Previous-Hop Insertion Block Format\n   The PHIB uses the Canonical Bundle\
    \ Block Format as defined in the\n   Bundle Protocol Specification [RFC5050].\
    \  That is, the PHIB is\n   comprised of the following elements, which are defined\
    \ as in all\n   bundle protocol blocks except the primary bundle block.  Note\
    \ that\n   Self-Delimiting Numeric Value (SDNV) encoding is also described in\n\
    \   the Bundle Protocol Specification:\n   o  Block-type code (one byte) - The\
    \ block-type code for the PHIB is\n      0x05.\n   o  Block processing control\
    \ flags (SDNV) - The following block\n      processing control flag MUST be set:\n\
    \         Discard block if it can't be processed\n   o  Block EID-reference count\
    \ and EID-references (optional) -\n      composite field defined in [RFC5050]\
    \ containing a count of EID-\n      references (expressed as an SDNV) followed\
    \ by an EID-reference\n      (expressed as a pair of SDNVs).\n      Whether or\
    \ not this field is allowed in the PHIB is determined by\n      whether or not\
    \ an M-EID of the node inserting the PHIB is already\n      in the Dictionary\
    \ field of the primary bundle block (e.g., whether\n      an M-EID of the inserting\
    \ node is also an M-EID of the bundle's\n      source, current custodian, or report-to\
    \ endpoint, or is the same\n      as some other endpoint in the dictionary that\
    \ is referenced by\n      another block in the bundle).\n      If an M-EID of\
    \ the inserting node is already in the dictionary,\n      this field MAY be present\
    \ in the PHIB.  If this field is present\n      in the PHIB, the value of the\
    \ EID-reference count MUST be one,\n      meaning that the field contains exactly\
    \ one EID-reference, which\n      MUST be a reference to an M-EID of the inserting\
    \ node.  Presence\n      of this field MUST be indicated by a set \"block contains\
    \ an EID-\n      reference field\" flag in the block processing control flags.\n\
    \      If no M-EID of the inserting node is in the dictionary, this field\n  \
    \    MUST NOT be present in the PHIB, which MUST be indicated by an\n      unset\
    \ \"block contains an EID-reference field\" flag in the block\n      processing\
    \ control flags.\n   o  Block data length (SDNV) - If this value is zero, there\
    \ are no\n      block-type-specific data fields.  In this case, the M-EID of the\n\
    \      inserting node must be in the dictionary and it MUST be referenced\n  \
    \    in the Block EID-reference count and EID-references field as\n      described\
    \ above.\n   o  Block-type-specific data fields (optional) as follows:\n     \
    \ *  Inserting Node's EID Scheme Name - A null-terminated array of\n         bytes\
    \ that comprises the scheme name of an M-EID of the node\n         inserting this\
    \ PHIB.\n      *  Inserting Node's EID SSP - A null-terminated array of bytes\n\
    \         that comprises the scheme-specific part (SSP) of an M-EID of\n     \
    \    the node inserting this PHIB.\n      If the Block EID-reference count and\
    \ EID-references field is not\n      present in the PHIB, the above two EID scheme\
    \ name and SSP block-\n      type-specific data fields MUST be present.  If the\
    \ Block EID-\n      reference count and EID-references field is present in the\
    \ PHIB,\n      the above two EID scheme name and SSP block-type-specific data\n\
    \      fields MUST NOT be present.\n   The structure of a PHIB is as follows:\n\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Bundle Forwarding\n   Before forwarding a bundle, the node SHALL delete\
    \ all PHIBs that were\n   in the bundle when it was received (if any).  As described\
    \ in the\n   Bundle Protocol Specification, the node MAY delete all strings\n\
    \   (scheme names and SSPs) in the bundle's dictionary to which no\n   endpoint\
    \ ID references in the bundle currently refer (if any).\n   The node MAY insert\
    \ one or more PHIBs into the bundle before\n   forwarding it, as dictated by local\
    \ policy.  If there are already\n   strings (scheme names and SSPs) in the bundle's\
    \ dictionary that\n   denote the M-EID of the inserting node, the PHIB MAY reference\
    \ these\n   strings and, if it does, it MUST NOT include any block-type-specific\n\
    \   data fields.  The inserting node MUST NOT insert strings into the\n   bundle's\
    \ dictionary in order that they may be referenced by only the\n   PHIB.  If the\
    \ PHIB is constructed such that it does not reference any\n   strings from the\
    \ dictionary, the inserting node MUST include the\n   scheme name and SSP of one\
    \ of its M-EIDs as the PHIB's block-type-\n   specific data fields.\n   The node\
    \ that is inserting a PHIB into the bundle may have more than\n   one endpoint\
    \ in which it is a member.  The choice of which M-EID to\n   insert into the PIB\
    \ SHALL be made as follows:\n   o  If the inserting node is a member of exactly\
    \ one singleton\n      endpoint, the node may insert at most one PHIB into the\
    \ bundle and\n      the EID of this singleton endpoint is what MUST be inserted\
    \ into\n      the PHIB.\n   o  If the inserting node is a member of more than\
    \ one singleton\n      endpoint, then:\n         If the inserting node has a priori\
    \ knowledge of the URI schemes\n         supported by the next-hop node and if\
    \ the inserting node has\n         one or more singleton M-EIDs that are expressible\
    \ in one or\n         more of those URI schemes, then the inserting node MAY insert\n\
    \         one or more PHIBs into the bundle being forwarded.  The EIDs in\n  \
    \       the inserted PHIBs MUST be unique, they MUST be singleton\n         M-EIDs\
    \ of the inserting node, and they MUST be expressed in URI\n         schemes supported\
    \ by the next-hop node.  Mechanisms for\n         determining what URI schemes\
    \ are supported by particular next-\n         hop neighbors are not defined here.\n\
    \         If the inserting node has one or more singleton M-EIDs that are\n  \
    \       expressible in the same URI scheme as the destination of the\n       \
    \  bundle that is being forwarded, then the inserting node MAY\n         insert\
    \ one or more PHIBs into the bundle being forwarded.  The\n         EIDs in the\
    \ inserted PHIBs MUST be unique, they MUST be\n         singleton M-EIDs of the\
    \ inserting node, and they MUST be\n         expressed in the destination URI\
    \ scheme of the bundle.\n         Else, if the inserting node has neither a singleton\
    \ M-EID that\n         is expressible in a URI scheme known to be supported by\
    \ the\n         next-hop node nor a singleton M-EID that is expressible in the\n\
    \         same URI scheme as the destination of the bundle that is being\n   \
    \      forwarded, then the inserting node MAY insert one or more PHIBs\n     \

- title: 3.3.  Bundle Reception
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Bundle Reception\n   If the bundle includes a PHIB, the EID identified\

    \ in forwarding\n   decisions or, if the receiving node is the bundle-destination,\
    \ the\n   EID may be made available to the receiving application; whether or\n\
    \   not it is made available to the receiving application is an\n   implementation\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The DTN Bundle Security Protocol [DTNBSP] defines\
    \ security-related\n   blocks to provide hop-by-hop bundle authentication and\
    \ integrity,\n   end-to-end integrity, and end-to-end confidentiality of bundles\
    \ or\n   parts of bundles, as well as a set of ciphersuites that may be used\n\
    \   to calculate security-results carried in these security blocks.  The\n   PHIB\
    \ will not be encrypted when using the PCB-RSA-AES128-PAYLOAD-PIB-\n   PCB ciphersuite\
    \ with the Payload Confidentiality Block (PCB) to\n   provide end-to-end confidentiality.\
    \  This ciphersuite only allows for\n   payload and Payload Integrity Block (PIB)\
    \ encryption.  If encryption\n   of the PHIB block is desired, the Extension Security\
    \ Block (ESB)\n   could be used for this purpose.\n   All ciphersuites that use\
    \ the strict canonicalization algorithm\n   [DTNBSP] to calculate and verify security-results\
    \ (e.g., many hop-by-\n   hop authentication ciphersuites) apply to all blocks\
    \ in the bundle,\n   and so would apply to bundles that include an optional PHIB\
    \ and would\n   include that block in the calculation of their security-result.\
    \  In\n   particular, bundles including the optional PHIB would have their\n \
    \  integrity protected in their entirety for the extent of a single hop,\n   from\
    \ a forwarding node to an adjacent receiving node, using the\n   Bundle Authentication\
    \ Block (BAB) with the BAB-HMAC (Hashed Message\n   Authentication Code) ciphersuite\
    \ defined in the Bundle Security\n   Protocol Specification.\n   Ciphersuites\
    \ that use the mutable canonicalization algorithm to\n   calculate and verify\
    \ security-results (e.g., the PIB-RSA-SHA256\n   ciphersuite and most end-to-end\
    \ authentication ciphersuites used with\n   the PIB) will (correctly) omit the\
    \ PHIB from their calculation.  The\n   fact that several different instantiations\
    \ of this PHIB block may be\n   added to and deleted from the bundle as the bundle\
    \ transits the\n   network will not interfere with end-to-end security protection\
    \ when\n   using ciphersuites that use mutable canonicalization.\n   As stated\
    \ above, the BAB can be used to ensure the integrity of the\n   PHIB.  Nodes receiving\
    \ bundles with PHIBs should be aware, however,\n   that forwarding nodes that\
    \ insert PHIBs might lie about the EIDs of\n   endpoints of which they are members.\
    \  Lying in this way could provide\n   a mechanism for subverting routing strategies\
    \ that base routing\n   decisions on EID information in the PHIB.\n   Note that\
    \ if some Bundle Protocol implementation does not support the\n   PHIB but does\
    \ not properly implement the \"Discard block if it can't\n   be processed\" flag,\
    \ then a PHIB may unexpectedly persist for longer\n   than a single hop.\n"
