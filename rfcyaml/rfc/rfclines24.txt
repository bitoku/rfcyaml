This note is a revision of NWG/RFC 10 and 16.
The Network Working Group consists of interested people from existing or potential ARPA network sites.
The Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the strategies for using the network, and initial experience with the network.
Documentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.
Notes may be produced at any site by and included in this series.
The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the HOST software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.
These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.
Every NWG note should bear the following information: 1.
"Network Working Group" "Request for Comnments: X"
(X underscored) where X is a serial number.
Serial numbers are assigned by Steve Crocker at UCLA.
2.  Author and affiliation 3.
The title need not be unique.
One copy only will be sent from the author's site to: 1.
