    \          A string encoding of Presentation Address\nStatus of this Memo\n  \
    \  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It\n    does not\
    \ specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo\n    is unlimited.\n\
    Abstract\nRFC 1278            String encoded P-Address             November 1991\n\
    1  Introduction\nOSI Application Entities use presentation addresses to address\
    \ other\nApplication Entities.  The model for this is defined in [ISO87b].\nPresentation\
    \ addresses are stored in the OSI Directory using an ASN.1\nrepresentation defined\
    \ by the OSI Directory [CCI88].  Logically, a\npresentation address consists of:\n\
    \ o  A presentation selector\n o  A session selector\n o  A transport selector\n\
    \ o  A set of network addresses\nThe selectors are all octet strings, but often\
    \ have IA5 character\nrepresentations.  The format of network addresses is defined\
    \ in\n[ISO87a].\nThere is a need to represent presentation addresses as strings\
    \ in a\nnumber of different contexts.  This Internet Draft defines a format\n\
    for use on the Internet.  It is for display to human users, and its\nuse is recommended\
    \ whenever this needs to be done.  Typically, this\nwill be for system managers\
    \ rather than for end users.  It is not\nintended for internal storage.\nThis\
    \ Internet Draft was originally published as UCL Research Note\nRN/89/14 [Kil89].\
    \  It was agreed as a unified syntax for the THORN and\nISODE projects.  It is\
    \ used throughout ISODE.\nChristian Huitema of Inria and Marshall Rose of PSI\
    \ Inc.  gave much\nuseful input to this document.\n2  Requirements\nThe main requirements\
    \ are:\n o  Must be able to specify any legal value.\n o  Should be clean in the\
    \ common case of the presentation address\n    containing network addresses and\
    \ no selectors.\nRFC 1278            String encoded P-Address             November\
    \ 1991\n o  Must deal with selectors in the following encodings:\n    --  IA5\n\
    \    --  Decimal digits encoded as IA5 (this is the most common syntax\n     \
    \   in Europe, as it is required by X.400(84) and should receive a\n        straightforward\
    \ encoding)\n    --  Numeric encoded as a 16 bit unsigned integer (US GOSIP).\
    \ This\n        is mapped onto two octets, with the first octet being the high\n\
    \        order byte of the integer.\n    --  General Hexadecimal\n o  Should give\
    \ special encodings for the ad hoc encoding proposed in\n    ``An interim approach\
    \ to use of Network Addresses'' [HK91].\n    --  X.25(80) Networks\n    --  TCP/IP\
    \ Networks\n o  Should be extensible for additional forms.\n o  Should provide\
    \ a reasonably compact representation .\n3  Format\nThe_BNF_is_given_in_figure_1.__________________________________________\n\

    Note that the RFC 1006 encoding permits use of either a DNS Domain\nName or an\
    \ IP address.  The former is primarily for ease of entry.  If\nthis DNS Domain\
    \ Name maps onto multiple IP addresses, then multiple\nnetwork addresses should\
    \ be generated.  The DNS Domain Name form is\nRFC 1278            String encoded\
    \ P-Address             November 1991\nfor convenient input.  When mapping from\
    \ an encoded address to string\nform, the IP address form should always be used.\n\
    4  Encoding\nSelectors are represented in a manner which can be easily encoded.\
    \  In\nthe NS notation, the concrete binary form of network address is given.\n\
    Otherwise, this string notation provides a mechanism for representing\nthe Abstract\
    \ Syntax of a Network Address.  This must be encoded\naccording to Addendum 2\
    \ of ISO 8348 [ISO87a].\n5  Macros\nThere are often common addresses, for which\
    \ a cleaner representation\nis desired.  This is achieved by use of Macros.  If\
    \ a\n<network-address> can be parsed as:\n<otherstring> \"=\" *( any )\nThen the\
    \ leading string is taken as a Macro, which is substituted.\nThis may be applied\
    \ recursively.  When presenting Network Address to\nhumans, the longest available\
    \ substitution should be used.  For\nexample:\n                       ________________________\n\

    \ ``Leeds=22'' would be expanded to ``DCC+826+d11000012022''.\n6  Standard Macros\n\
    No Macros should ever be relied on.  However, the following are\nsuggested as\
