  - "                        Response to NWM/RFC #67\nBill's suggestion is a good\
    \ one; however, my current policy is to\nencourage the most rapid implementation\
    \ of the protocol in document\n#1, and his suggested modification should be delayed.\
    \  It seems to me\nmost important to gain experience using the network before\
    \ making\nchanges to the protocol which are not dictated by necessity.  (I\npolled\
    \ several sites regarding Bill's suggestion.  Sites with NCP\nimplementations\
    \ under way tended to agree with this policy, while\nsites further behind tended\
    \ to desire Bill's suggested change.)\nWith respect to changes, in general, I\
    \ believe that changes are\nnecessary to improve the efficiency, provide greater\
    \ flexibility, and\nguarantee reliability.  Many of us can suggest changes now,\
    \ but I\nsuspect that clearer ideas will emerge from usage.\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Josh Elliott 1/98 ]\n"
