  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the procedures and criteria for reviewing\n\
    \   reliable multicast protocols within the Transport Area (TSV) of the\n   IETF.\
    \  Within today's Internet, important applications exist for a\n   reliable multicast\
    \ service.  Some examples that are driving reliable\n   multicast technology are\
    \ collaborative workspaces (such as\n   whiteboard), data and software distribution,\
    \ and (more speculatively)\n   web caching protocols.  Due to the nature of the\
    \ technical issues, a\n   single commonly accepted technical solution that solves\
    \ all the\n   demands for reliable multicast is likely to be infeasible [RMMinutes\n\
    \   1997].\n   A number of reliable multicast protocols have already been developed\n\
    \   to solve a variety of problems for various types of applications.\n   [Floyd97]\
    \ describes one widely deployed example.  How should these\n   protocols be treated\
    \ within the IETF and how should the IETF guide\n   the development of reliable\
    \ multicast in a direction beneficial for\n   the general Internet?\n   The TSV\
    \ Area Directors and their Directorate have outlined a set of\n   review procedures\
    \ that address these questions and set criteria and\n   processes for the publication\
    \ as RFCs of Internet-Drafts on reliable\n   multicast transport protocols.\n"

  - "1.0 Background on IETF Processes and Procedures\n   In the IETF, work in an area\
    \ is directed and managed by the Area\n   Directors (ADs), who have authority\
    \ over the chartering of working\n   groups (WGs).\n   In addition, ADs review\
    \ individually submitted (not by WGs)\n   Internet-Drafts about work that is relevant\
    \ to their areas prior to\n   publication as RFCs (Experimental, Informational\
    \ or, in rare cases,\n   Standards Track). The review is done according to the\
    \ guidelines set\n   out in the Internet Standards Process, RFC 2026 [InetStdProc96].\n\
    \   The purpose of this document is to present the criteria that will be\n   used\
    \ by the TSV ADs in reviewing reliable multicast Internet-Drafts\n   for any form\
    \ of RFC publication.\n   For I-Ds submitted for Standards Track publication,\
    \ these criteria\n   must be met or else the ADs will decline to support publication\
    \ of\n   the document, which suffices to prevent publication.  For I-Ds\n   submitted\
    \ as Experimental or Informational, these criteria must be\n   met or else, at\
    \ a minimum, the Ads will recommend publishing the I-D\n   with an IESG note prepended\
    \ stating that the protocol fails to comply\n   with these criteria.\n"
- title: 2.0 Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.0 Introduction\n   There is a strong application demand for reliable multicast.\n\
    \   Widespread use of the Internet makes the economy of multicast\n   transport\
    \ attractive.  The current Internet multicast model offers\n   best-effort many-to-many\
    \ delivery service and offers no guarantees.\n   One-to-many and few-to-few services\
    \ may become more important in the\n   future.  Reliable multicast transports\
    \ add delivery guarantees, not\n   necessarily like those of reliable unicast\
    \ TCP, to the group-delivery\n   model of multicast.  A panel of some major users\
    \ of the Internet,\n   convened at the 38th IETF, articulated reliable bulk transfer\n\
    \   multicast as one of their most critical requirements [DiffServBOF97].\n  \
    \ Examples of applications that could use reliable bulk multicast\n   transfer\
    \ include collaborative tools, distributed virtual reality,\n   and software upgrade\
    \ services.\n   To meet the growing demand for reliable multicast, there is a\
    \ large\n   number of protocol proposals.  A few were published as RFCs before\n\
    \   the impact of congestion from reliable multicast was fully\n   appreciated,\
    \ and these should be deprecated [DeprRFCs].  Two surveys\n   of other publications\
    \ are [DiotCrow97], [Obraczka98].\n   As we discuss in Section 3, the issues raised\
    \ by reliable multicast\n   are considerably more complex than those related to\
    \ reliable unicast.\n   In particular, in today's Internet, reliable multicast\
    \ protocols\n   could do great damage through causing congestion disasters if\
    \ they\n   are widely used and do not provide adequate congestion control.\n \
    \  Because of the complexity of the technical issues, and the abundance\n   of\
    \ proposed solutions, we are putting in place review procedures that\n   are more\
    \ explicit than usual.  We compare this action with an IESG\n   action taken in\
    \ 1991, RFC 1264 [Routing91], when community experience\n   with standard Internet\
    \ dynamic routing protocols was still limited,\n   and extra review was deemed\
    \ necessary to assure that the protocols\n   introduced would be effective, correct\
    \ and robust.\n   Section 3 describes in detail the nature of the particular challenges\n\
    \   posed by reliable multicast. Section 4 describes the process for\n   considering\
    \ reliable multicast solutions. Section 5 details the\n   additional requirements\
    \ that need to be met by proposals to be\n   published as Standards Track RFCs.\n"
- title: 3.0 Issues in Reliable Multicast
  contents:
  - "3.0 Issues in Reliable Multicast\n   Two aspects of reliable multicast make standardization\
    \ particularly\n   challenging. First, the meaning of reliability varies in the\
    \ context\n   of different applications. Secondly, if special care is not taken,\n\
    \   reliable multicast protocols can cause a particular threat to the\n   operation\
    \ of today's global Internet. These issues are discussed in\n   detail in this\
    \ section.\n"
- title: 3.1 One or Many Reliable Multicast Protocols or Frameworks?
  contents:
  - "3.1 One or Many Reliable Multicast Protocols or Frameworks?\n   Unlike reliable\
    \ unicast, where a single transport protocol (TCP) is\n   currently used to meet\
    \ the reliable delivery needs of a wide range of\n   applications, reliable multicast\
    \ does not necessarily lend itself to\n   a single application interface or to\
    \ a single underlying set of\n   mechanisms.  For unicast transport, the requirements\
    \ for reliable,\n   sequenced data delivery are fairly general.  TCP, the primary\n\
    \   transport protocol for reliable unicast, is a mature protocol with\n   delivery\
    \ semantics that suit a wide range of applications.\n   In contrast, different\
    \ multicast applications have widely different\n   requirements for reliability.\
    \  For example, some applications require\n   that message delivery obey a total\
    \ ordering while others do not.\n   Some applications have many or all the members\
    \ sending data while\n   others have only one data source.  Some applications\
    \ have replicated\n   data, for example in an n-redundant file store, so that\
    \ several\n   members are capable of transmitting a data item, while for others\
    \ all\n   data originates at a single source.  Some applications are restricted\n\
    \   to small fixed-membership multicast groups, while other applications\n   need\
    \ to scale dynamically to thousands or tens of thousands of\n   members (or possibly\
    \ more).  Some applications have stringent delay\n   requirements, while others\
    \ do not.  Some applications such as file-\n   transfer are high-bandwidth, while\
    \ other applications such as\n   interactive collaboration tools are more likely\
    \ to be bursty but use\n   low bandwidth overall. Some applications will sometimes\
    \ trade off\n   less than complete reliability for more timely delivery. These\n\
    \   requirements each impact the design of reliable multicast protocols\n   in\
    \ a different way.\n   In addition, even for a specific application where the\
    \ application's\n   requirements for reliable multicast are well understood, there\
    \ are\n   many open questions about the underlying mechanisms for providing\n\
    \   reliable multicast.  A key question concerns the robustness of the\n   underlying\
    \ reliable multicast mechanisms as the number of senders or\n   the membership\
    \ of the multicast group grows.\n   One challenge to the IETF is to end up with\
    \ the right match between\n   applications' requirements and reliable multicast\
    \ mechanisms.  While\n   there is general agreement that a single reliable multicast\
    \ protocol\n   or framework is not likely to meet the needs of all Internet\n\
    \   applications, there is less understanding and agreement about the\n   exact\
    \ relationship between application-specific requirements and more\n   generic\
    \ underlying reliable mutlicast protocols or mechanisms. There\n   are also open\
    \ questions about the appropriate integration between an\n   application and an\
    \ underlying reliable multicast framework, and the\n   potential generality of\
    \ a single applications interface for that\n   framework.\n"
- title: 3.2 Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "3.2 Congestion Control\n   A particular concern for the IETF is the impact of\
    \ reliable multicast\n   traffic on other traffic in the Internet in times of\
    \ congestion, in\n   particular the effect of reliable multicast traffic on competing\
    \ TCP\n   traffic.  The success of the Internet relies on the fact that best-\n\
    \   effort traffic responds to congestion on a link (currently as\n   indicated\
    \ by packet drops) by reducing the load presented to the\n   network.  Congestion\
    \ collapse in today's Internet is prevented only\n   by the congestion control\
    \ mechanisms in TCP, standardized by RFC 2001\n   [CongAvoid97, Jacobson88].\n\
    \   There are a number of reasons to be particularly attentive to the\n   congestion-related\
    \ issues raised by reliable multicast proposals.\n   Multicast applications in\
    \ general have the potential to do more\n   congestion-related damage to the Internet\
    \ than do unicast\n   applications.  One factor is that a single multicast flow\
    \ can be\n   distributed along a large, global multicast tree reaching throughout\n\
    \   the entire Internet.\n   Unreliable multicast applications such as audio and\
    \ video are, at the\n   moment, usually accompanied by a person at the receiving\
    \ end, and\n   people typically unsubscribe from a multicast group if congestion\
    \ is\n   so heavy that the audio or video stream is unintelligible.  Reliable\n\
    \   multicast applications such as group file transfer applications, on\n   the\
    \ other hand, are likely to be between computers, with no humans in\n   attendance\
    \ monitoring congestion levels.\n   In addition, reliable multicast applications\
    \ do not necessarily have\n   the natural time limitations typical of current\
    \ unreliable multicast\n   applications.  For a file transfer application, for\
    \ example, the data\n   transfer might continue until all of the data is transferred\
    \ to all\n   of the intended receivers, resulting in a potentially-unlimited\n\
    \   duration for an individual flow.  Reliable multicast applications\n   also\
    \ have to contend with a potential explosion of complex patterns\n   of control\
    \ traffic (e.g., ACKs, NACKs, status messages).  The design\n   of congestion\
    \ control mechanisms for reliable multicast for large\n   multicast groups is\
    \ currently an area of active research.\n   The challenge to the IETF is to encourage\
    \ research and\n   implementations of reliable multicast, and to enable the needs\
    \ of\n   applications for reliable multicast to be met as expeditiously as\n \
    \  possible, while at the same time protecting the Internet from the\n   congestion\
    \ disaster or collapse that could result from the widespread\n   use of applications\
    \ with inappropriate reliable multicast mechanisms.\n   Because of the setbacks\
    \ and costs that could result from the\n   widespread deployment of reliable multicast\
    \ with inadequate\n   congestion control, the IETF must exercise care in the\n\
    \   standardization of a reliable multicast protocol that might see\n   widespread\
    \ use.\n   The careful review and cautious acceptance procedures for proposals\n\
    \   submitted as Internet-Drafts reflects our concern to meet the\n   challenges\
    \ described here.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. IETF Process for Review and Publication of Reliable Multicast\n   Protocol\
    \ Specifications\n   In the general case of individually submitted Internet-Drafts\n\
    \   (proposals not produced by an IETF WG), the process of publication as\n  \
    \ some type of RFC is described in RFC 2026 (4.2.3) [InetStdProc96].\n   This\
    \ specifies that if the submitted Internet-Draft is closely\n   related to work\
    \ being done or expected to be done in the IETF, the\n   ADs may recommend that\
    \ the document be brought within the IETF and\n   progressed in the IETF context.\
    \  Otherwise, the ADs may recommend\n   that the Internet-Draft be published as\
    \ an Experimental or\n   Informational RFC, with or without an IESG annotation\
    \ of its\n   relationship to the IETF context.\n   The procedure for Reliable\
    \ Multicast proposal publication will have\n   as its default RFC status Experimental,\
    \ when the technical criteria\n   listed in Section 5 are deemed to be fulfilled.\
    \ Both the criteria and\n   the procedure reflect the AD's technical assessment\
    \ of the current\n   state of reliable multicast technology.  It does not reflect\
    \ the\n   origins of the proposals, which we expect will be equally from\n   commercial\
    \ vendors with initial products and from researchers.\n   Work on the development\
    \ and engineering of protocols that may\n   eventually meet the review criteria\
    \ could take place either in the\n   IRTF Reliable Multicast Research Group (http://www.irtf.org)\
    \ or a\n   focused short IETF WG with an Experimental product.\n   When the work\
    \ in reliable multicast technology has matured enough to\n   be considered for\
    \ standardization within the IETF, the TSV Area may\n   charter appropriate working\
    \ groups to develop standards track\n   documents.  The criteria for evaluation\
    \ of standards track technology\n   will be at least as stringent as those described\
    \ herein (next\n   section).\n"
- title: 5. Technical Criteria for Reliable Multicast
  contents:
  - "5. Technical Criteria for Reliable Multicast\n   The Internet-Draft must (in\
    \ itself or a companion draft):\n   a. Analyze the behavior of the protocol.\n\
    \      The vulnerabilities and performance problems must be shown through\n  \
    \    analysis. Especially the protocol behavior must be explained in\n      detail\
    \ with respect to scalability, congestion control, error\n      recovery, and\
    \ robustness.\n      For example the following questions should be answered:\n\
    \         How scalable is the protocol to the number of senders or\n         receivers\
    \ in a group, the number of groups, and wide dispersion\n         of group members?\n\
    \         Identify the mechanisms which limit scalability and estimate\n     \
    \    those limits.\n         How does the protocol protect the Internet from congestion?\
    \ How\n         well does it perform? When does it fail?\n         Under what\
    \ circumstances will the protocol fail to perform the\n         functions needed\
    \ by the applications it serves?\n         Is there a congestion control mechanism?\
    \ How well does it\n         perform? When does it fail?  Note that congestion\
    \ control\n         mechanisms that operate on the network more aggressively than\n\
    \         TCP will face a great burden of proof that they don't threaten\n   \
    \      network stability.\n   b. Include a description of trials and/or simulations\
    \ which support\n      the development of the protocol and the answers to the\
    \ above\n      questions.\n   c. Include an analysis of whether the protocol has\
    \ congestion\n      avoidance mechanisms strong enough to cope with deployment\
    \ in the\n      Global Internet, and if not, clearly document the circumstances\
    \ in\n      which congestion harm can occur.  How are these circumstances to\n\
    \      be prevented?\n   d. Include a description of any mechanisms which contain\
    \ the traffic\n      within limited network environments. If the analysis in a\
    \ or c\n      shows that the protocol has potential to damage the Internet, then\n\
    \      the analysis must include a discussion of ways to limit the scope\n   \
    \   or otherwise contain the protocol.  We recognize that the\n      confinement\
    \ of Internet applications is an open research area.\n   e. Reliable multicast\
    \ protocols must include an analysis of how they\n      address a number of security\
    \ and privacy concerns.  If the\n      protocol can be used in different modes\
    \ of secure operation, then\n      each mode must be analyzed.\n         The analysis\
    \ must document which of the various parties --\n         senders, routers (more\
    \ generally, data forwarders), receivers,\n         retransmission sources --\
    \ must be trusted in order to ensure\n         secure operation and privacy of\
    \ the transmitted data, to what\n         degree, and why.  (One issue to address\
    \ here are \"man-in-the-\n         middle\" attacks.)\n         To what degree\
    \ can data be manipulated so that at least a\n         subset of the receivers\
    \ receive different copies?  Does the\n         protocol allow a group of receivers\
    \ to determine whether they\n         all received the same data?\n         What\
    \ limitations are placed on the retransmission mechanism to\n         prevent\
    \ it from being abused to flood network links with\n         excessive traffic?\
    \ Which parties must be trusted to ensure\n         this, and to what degree,\
    \ and why? The presumption will be that\n         either a congestion control\
    \ mechanism will inherently limit the\n         volume of retransmission traffic,\
    \ and that this limiting\n         influence is robust under concerted attack;\
    \ or that\n         retransmission requests will be signed in a cryptographically\n\
    \         strong manner so that abuses of the mechanism can be traced\n      \
    \   back to their source.  Protocols that do not provide either of\n         these\
    \ forms of protection face a great burden of proof that\n         they don't threaten\
    \ network stability.\n         What sort of key management does the protocol require,\
    \ and\n         provide for?\n"
