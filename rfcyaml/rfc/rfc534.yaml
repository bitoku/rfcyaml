  - "                         Lost Message Detection\n   As an aside to RFC 533, note\
    \ that if sending Hosts do uniquely\n   identify messages on a given link using\
    \ the extra four bits and\n   receiving Hosts do look at these bits, a lost message\
    \ detection\n   system such as those suggested in RFCs 512 and 516 drops right\
    \ out of\n   using of the unique message-id.  These extra four bits can be treated\n\
    \   as Hathaway's SCB of RFC 512 providing a 16 element sequence number\n   on\
    \ a per connection basis.  A 16 element sequence is sufficient as\n   the IMPs\
    \ never allow more than four outstanding messages at one time\n   between a given\
    \ pair of Hosts.  As Hathaway also suggests, the 0\n   element in the sequence\
    \ can be used to indicate to the receiving Host\n   that sequence numbers are\
    \ not being used.\n   To summarize, there appear to be three modes of using the\
    \ message-id\n   number under Host/Host protocol:\n   1. The sender can always\
    \ set the extra four bits to 0 and only\n      transmit one message over a given\
    \ link at a time -- this is slow\n      but it allows orderly retransmission of\
    \ messages without any help\n      from the receiver.\n   2. The receiver can\
    \ give no help to the sender.  In this case it\n      doesn't matter whether the\
    \ sender uses the extra four bits to\n      uniquely identify the messages or\
    \ not -- the sender has no method\n      of orderly retransmission, although the\
    \ sender can accurately\n      identify which message was lost if the sender has\
    \ uniquely\n      identified the messages.\n   3. The sender can have multiple\
    \ messages outstanding (i.e., RFNMs not\n      received) on a given link and the\
    \ receiver can help the sender.\n      In this case, if the sender uses the extra\
    \ four bits to uniquely\n      identify the messages in a way which can be synchronized\
    \ with the\n      receiver (e.g., sequential id numbers), the receiver can reliably\n\
    \      detect lost messages.\n   Although it probably will seem insufficient to\
    \ some, if the sender\n   and receiver use synchronized unique message-id numbers,\
    \ very\n   reliable retransmission schemes are readily available.  For instance,\n\
    \   the sender can retransmit the appropriate messages in response to\n   incomplete\
    \ transmissions and the receiver can use the unique\n   message-ids to sort the\
    \ retransmitted messages into the proper order\n   with the other received messages.\
    \  Alternatively, the receiver can\n   discard all messages received out of order\
    \ and the sender can back up\n   and retransmit a message for which an incomplete\
    \ transmission was\n   received and all subsequent messages.\n         [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online\
