Abstract This document specifies how signaling and selection processes for Pseudowire (PW)
Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) are modified to ensure backward compatibility and allow use of proactive Connectivity Verification (CV), Continuity Check (CC), and Remote Defect Indication (RDI) over MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) PWs.
This document introduces four new CV types and, to accommodate them, a new VCCV Extended CV parameter for PW Interface Parameters
Introduction Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV), Continuity Check (CC), and Remote Defect Indication (RDI) for the MPLS Transport Profile [RFC6428] are applicable to all constructs of the MPLS TP, including pseudowires (PWs).
If the control plane is used to operate and manage PWs then the procedures defined in [RFC5085] and [RFC5885] should be used to select the proper type of Control Channel and the corresponding type of Connectivity Verification.
This document specifies how signaling and selection processes are modified to ensure backward compatibility and allow use of proactive CV CC RDI over MPLS TP PWs.

MPLS TP CC CV on Pseudowires PW VCCV can support several CV Types, and it can support an arbitrary combination of CV modes advertised in the CV Types field of the VCCV Interface Parameter sub TLV [RFC4446]
Currently, six types of CV have been defined for PW VCCV.
This document introduces four new CV types and, to accommodate them, a new VCCV Extended CV parameter for the PW
Extended CV Advertisement Sub TLV
The format of the VCCV Extended CV Advertisement is a TLV where the format is as follows:
VCCV Extended CV Parameter Format
The Length field is the length of the sub TLV, including type and the Length field itself.
The minimum length is 4.
It is recommended that extensions to the sub TLV be done in 4 byte increments.
The Reserved field MUST be set to zeroes on transmit and ignored on receive.
The CV Type field is a bitmask that lists types of CV monitoring that a PE is capable of supporting.
The VCCV Extended CV parameter sub
TLV MUST appear in combination with the VCCV parameter sub TLV.
If the VCCV parameter sub TLV is missing, then the VCCV Extended CV parameter sub TLV
MPLS TP CC CV Types [RFC6428] defines coordinated and independent modes of monitoring point to point bidirectional connection that can be applied to monitoring PWs.
At the same time, [RFC6310] defines how BFD based Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) can map to the status of an Attachment Circuit.

MPLS TP CC CV Type Operation
According to [RFC6428], connectivity verification is part of MPLS TP CC/CV operation that can be used with VCCV Control Channel Type 1 [RFC5085].
If VCCV Control Channel Type 1 is selected, then PEs MAY select one of the MPLS TP CC CV types as the VCCV CV mechanism to be used for this PW.
CV Type Selection CV selection rules that have been defined in Section 7 of [RFC5085] and updated in Section 4 of [RFC5885] are augmented in this document.
If VCCV Control Channel Type 1 is chosen according to Section 7 of [RFC5085] and a common set of proactive CV types that are advertised by both PEs includes MPLS TP CC CV types and some BFD CV types, then MPLS TP CC CV takes precedence over any type of BFD CV.
If multiple MPLS TP CV types are advertised by both PEs, then the following list (ordered by descending priority) is used: 1.  0x08 Coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault Status Signaling 2.
0x04 Coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection only 3.
0x02 Independent mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault Status Signaling 4.
0x01 Independent mode for PW Fault Detection only 3.
The PW Interface Parameters Sub TLV registry is defined in [RFC4446].
IANA has reserved a new PW Interface Parameters Sub TLV type as follows:
New PW Interface Parameters Sub TLV 3.1.
Extended CV Types IANA has set up a registry of VCCV Extended CV Types.
These are 8 bit values.
Extended CV Type values 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, and 0x08 are specified in Section 2.2 of this document.
The remaining values (0x10 through 0x80) are to be assigned by IANA using the "IETF Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].
A VCCV Extended Connectivity Verification Type description and a reference to an RFC approved by the IESG are required for any assignment from this registry.
VCCV Extended Connectivity Verification (CV) Types 4.
Security Considerations Routers that implement the additional CV Type defined herein are subject to the same security considerations as defined in [RFC5085], [RFC5880], [RFC5881], and [RFC6428].
This specification does not raise any additional security issues beyond those.
