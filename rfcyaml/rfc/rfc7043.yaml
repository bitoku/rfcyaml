  - "Abstract\n   48-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended Unique\n\
    \   Identifier (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE for use\n  \
    \ in various layer-2 networks, e.g., Ethernet.\n   This document describes two\
    \ new DNS resource record types, EUI48 and\n   EUI64, for encoding Ethernet addresses\
    \ in the DNS.\n   This document describes potentially severe privacy implications\n\
    \   resulting from indiscriminate publication of link-layer addresses in\n   the\
    \ DNS.  EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses SHOULD NOT be published in the\n   public DNS.\
    \  This document specifies an interoperable encoding of\n   these address types\
    \ for use in private DNS namespaces, where the\n   privacy concerns can be constrained\
    \ and mitigated.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and\
    \ [RFC1035].\n   This base specification defines many resource record (RR) types,\
    \ and\n   subsequent specifications have defined others.  Each defined RR type\n\
    \   provides a means of encoding particular data in the DNS.\n   48-bit Extended\
    \ Unique Identifier (EUI-48) [EUI48] and 64-bit\n   Extended Unique Identifier\
    \ (EUI-64) [EUI64] are address formats\n   specified by the IEEE for use in various\
    \ layer-2 networks, e.g.,\n   Ethernet.\n   This document defines two new RR types,\
    \ EUI48 and EUI64, for encoding\n   EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in the DNS.\n\
    \   There are potentially severe privacy implications resulting from the\n   indiscriminate\
    \ publication of link-layer addresses in the DNS (see\n   Section 8).  This document\
    \ recommends that EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses\n   SHOULD NOT be published in the\
    \ public DNS.  This document specifies\n   an interoperable encoding of these\
    \ address types for use in private\n   DNS namespaces, where the privacy implications\
    \ can be constrained and\n   mitigated.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses capitalized keywords such as MUST and\
    \ MAY to\n   describe the requirements for using the registered RR types.  The\n\
    \   intended meaning of those keywords in this document are the same as\n   those\
    \ described in [RFC2119].  Although these keywords are often used\n   to specify\
    \ normative requirements in IETF Standards, their use in\n   this document does\
    \ not imply that this document is a standard of any\n   kind.\n"

- title: '5.  Example Use Case: IP Address Tracking in DOCSIS Networks'
  contents:
  - "5.  Example Use Case: IP Address Tracking in DOCSIS Networks\n   Canadian cable\
    \ Internet subscribers are assigned IP addresses using\n   DHCP, using a DHCP\
    \ server operated by a cable company.  In the case\n   where a cable company provides\
    \ last-mile connectivity to a subscriber\n   on behalf of a third-party company\
    \ (reseller), the DHCP server\n   assigns addresses from a pool supplied by the\
    \ reseller.  The reseller\n   retains knowledge of the EUI-48 address of the DOCSIS\
    \ modem supplied\n   to the subscriber but has no direct knowledge of the IP addresses\n\
    \   assigned.  In order for the reseller to be able to map the IP address\n  \
    \ assigned to a subscriber to that EUI-48 address (and hence to the\n   subscriber\
    \ identity), the cable company can make available\n   information from the DHCP\
    \ server that provides (EUI-48, IP) address\n   mapping.\n   Cable companies in\
    \ Canada are required [NTRE038D] to make this\n   address mapping available using\
    \ the DNS.  Zones containing the\n   relevant information are published on DNS\
    \ servers, access to which is\n   restricted to the resellers corresponding to\
    \ particular sets of\n   subscribers.  Subscriber address information is not published\
    \ in the\n   public DNS.\n   Existing DNS schemas for the representation of (EUI-48,\
    \ IP) mapping\n   used by Canadian cable companies are varied and inefficient;\
    \ in the\n   absence of an RR type for direct encoding of EUI-48 addresses,\n\
    \   addresses are variously encoded into owner names or are published in\n   TXT\
    \ records.\n   The specification in this document facilitates a more efficient,\n\
    \   consistent, and reliable representation of (EUI-48, IP) mapping than\n   was\
    \ previously available.\n"
- title: 6.  DNS Protocol Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  DNS Protocol Considerations\n   The specification of the new RR types in\
    \ this document has no effect\n   on the address resolution behavior of any previously\
    \ existing network\n   processes or protocols.  Proposals or specifications to\
    \ modify or\n   augment address resolution processes or protocols by making use\
    \ of\n   these RR types should specify how any address conflicts or use of\n \

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are privacy concerns with the publication\
    \ of link-layer\n   addresses in the DNS.  EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses with the\n\
    \   Local/Global bit zero [RFC7042] (referred to in [RFC4291] as the\n   universal/local\
    \ bit) are intended to represent unique identifiers for\n   network connected\
    \ equipment, notwithstanding many observed cases of\n   duplication due to manufacturing\
    \ errors, unauthorized use of\n   Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs),\
    \ and address spoofing\n   through configuration of network interfaces.  Publication\
    \ of EUI-48\n   or EUI-64 addresses in the DNS may result in privacy issues in\
    \ the\n   form of unique trackable identities that in some cases may be\n   permanent.\n\
    \   For example, although IP addresses and DNS names for network devices\n   typically\
    \ change over time, EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses configured on\n   the same devices\
    \ are normally far more stable (in many cases,\n   effectively invariant).  Publication\
    \ of EUI-48 addresses associated\n   with user devices in a way that could be\
    \ mapped to assigned IP\n   addresses would allow the behavior of those users\
    \ to be tracked by\n   third parties, regardless of where and how the user's device\
    \ is\n   connected to the Internet.  This might well result in a loss of\n   privacy\
    \ for the user.\n   The publication of EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses associated with\n\
    \   deployed equipment, using the mechanism described in this document or\n  \
    \ any other mechanism, has the potential to facilitate Media Access\n   Control\
    \ (MAC) cloning -- that is, facilitate link-layer attacks\n   against deployed\
    \ devices, e.g., to disrupt service or intercept data.\n   These concerns can\
    \ be mitigated by restricting access to DNS zones\n   containing EUI48 or EUI64\
    \ RRs to specific, authorized clients and by\n   provisioning them in DNS zones\
    \ that exist in private namespaces only.\n   This document recommends that EUI-48\
    \ or EUI-64 addresses SHOULD NOT\n   be published in the public DNS.\n"
