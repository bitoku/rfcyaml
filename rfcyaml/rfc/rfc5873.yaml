  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access\
    \ (PANA)\n   [RFC5191] carries Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) messages\n\
    \   between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) in\n   the\
    \ access network.  If the PaC is a mobile device and is capable of\n   moving\
    \ from one access network to another while running its\n   applications, it is\
    \ critical for the PaC to perform a handover\n   seamlessly without degrading\
    \ the performance of the applications\n   during the handover period.  When the\
    \ handover requires the PaC to\n   establish a PANA session with the PAA in the\
    \ new access network, the\n   signaling to establish the PANA session should be\
    \ completed as fast\n   as possible.  See [RFC5836] for the handover latency requirements.\n\
    \   This document defines an extension to the PANA protocol [RFC5191]\n   used\
    \ for proactively executing EAP authentication and establishing a\n   PANA SA\
    \ (Security Association) between a PaC in an access network and\n   a PAA in another\
    \ access network to which the PaC may move.  The\n   extension to the PANA protocol\
    \ is designed to realize direct\n   pre-authentication defined in [RFC5836]. \
    \ How to realize\n   authorization and accounting with the use of the pre-authentication\n\
    \   extension is out of the scope of this document.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The following terms are used in this document, in addition\
    \ to the\n   terms defined in [RFC5191].\n   Serving Network:  The access network\
    \ to which the host is currently\n      attached.\n   Candidate Network:  An access\
    \ network that is a potential target of\n      the host's handover.\n   Serving\
    \ PAA (SPAA):  A PAA that resides in the serving network and\n      provides network\
    \ access authentication for a particular PaC.\n   Candidate PAA (CPAA):  A PAA\
    \ that resides in a candidate network to\n      which the PaC may move.  A CPAA\
    \ for a particular PaC may be a SPAA\n      for another PaC.\n   Pre-authentication:\
    \  Pre-authentication refers to EAP\n      pre-authentication and is defined as\
    \ the utilization of EAP to\n      pre-establish EAP keying material on an authenticator\
    \ prior to\n      arrival of the peer at the access network served by that\n \
    \     authenticator [RFC5836].  In this document, EAP pre-authentication\n   \
    \   is performed between a PaC and a CPAA.\n"
- title: 3.  Pre-Authentication Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Pre-Authentication Procedure\n   A PaC that supports pre-authentication may\
    \ establish a PANA session\n   for each CPAA.\n   There may be several mechanisms\
    \ for a PaC to discover a CPAA.  An IP\n   address of the discovered CPAA is the\
    \ output of those mechanisms.\n   PANA pre-authentication is performed between\
    \ the PaC and CPAA using\n   the discovered IP address of the CPAA.  IEEE 802.21\
    \ [802.21]\n   Information Service MAY be used as a CPAA discovery mechanism.\n\
    \   There may be a number of criteria for CPAA selection, the timing to\n   start\
    \ pre-authentication, and the timing as to when the CPAA becomes\n   the SPAA.\
    \  Such criteria can be implementation-specific and thus are\n   outside the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   Pre-authentication is initiated by a PaC in a way similar\
    \ to normal\n   authentication.  A new 'E' (prE-authentication) bit is defined\
    \ in the\n   PANA header.  When pre-authentication is performed, the 'E'\n   (prE-authentication)\
    \ bit of PANA messages is set in order to indicate\n   that this PANA run is for\
    \ pre-authentication.  Use of\n   pre-authentication is negotiated as follows.\n\
    \   o  When a PaC initiates pre-authentication, it sends a PANA-Client-\n    \
    \  Initiation (PCI) message with the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit\n      set.\
    \  The CPAA responds with a PANA-Auth-Request (PAR) message\n      with the 'S'\
    \ (Start) and 'E' (prE-authentication) bits set only if\n      it supports pre-authentication.\
    \  Otherwise, the 'E'\n      (prE-authentication) bit of the PAR message will\
    \ be cleared\n      according to Section 6.2 of [RFC5191], which results in a\n\
    \      negotiation failure.\n   o  Once the PaC and CPAA have successfully negotiated\
    \ on performing\n      pre-authentication using the 'S' (Start) and 'E'\n    \
    \  (prE-authentication) bits, the subsequent PANA messages exchanged\n      between\
    \ them MUST have the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit set until\n      the CPAA becomes\
    \ the SPAA of the PaC.  The PaC may conduct this\n      exchange with more than\
    \ one CPAA.  If the PaC and CPAA have failed\n      to negotiate on performing\
    \ pre-authentication, the PaC or CPAA\n      that sent a message with both the\
    \ 'S' (Start) and 'E'\n      (prE-authentication) bits set MUST discard the message\
    \ received\n      from the peer with 'S' (Start) bit set and the 'E'\n      (prE-authentication)\
    \ bit cleared, which will eventually result in\n      PANA session termination.\n\
    \   If IP reconfiguration is needed in the access network associated with\n  \
    \ the CPAA, the 'I' (IP Reconfiguration) bit in PAR messages used for\n   pre-authentication\
    \ between the PaC and CPAA is also set.  The 'I' (IP\n   Reconfiguration) bit\
    \ in these messages takes effect only after the\n   CPAA becomes the SPAA.\n \
    \  When a CPAA of the PaC becomes the SPAA, e.g., due to movement of the\n   PaC,\
    \ the PaC informs the PAA of the change using PANA-Notification-\n   Request (PNR)\
    \ and PANA-Notification-Answer (PNA) messages with the\n   'P' (Ping) bit set\
    \ and the 'E' (prE-authentication) bit cleared.  The\n   'E' (prE-authentication)\
    \ bit MUST be cleared in subsequent PANA\n   messages.\n   A PANA SA is required\
    \ for pre-authentication in order to securely\n   associate the PNR/PNA exchange\
    \ to the earlier authentication.\n   The PANA session between the PaC and a CPAA\
    \ is deleted by entering\n   the termination phase of the PANA protocol.\n   An\
    \ example call flow for pre-authentication is shown in Figure 1.\n   Note that\
    \ EAP authentication is performed over PAR and\n   PANA-Auth-Answer (PAN) exchanges,\
    \ including the one with the 'C'\n   (Complete) bit set.\n        PaC        \

    \ pre-authentication by sending a PCI message with the 'E'\n   (prE-authentication)\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification is based on the PANA protocol,\
    \ and it exhibits the\n   same security properties, except for one important difference:\n\
    \   Pre-authenticating PaCs are not physically connected to an access\n   network\
    \ associated with the PAA, but they are connected to some other\n   network somewhere\
    \ else on the Internet.  This distinction can create\n   greater denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) vulnerability for systems using PANA\n   pre-authentication if appropriate\
    \ measures are not taken.  An\n   unprotected PAA can be forced to create state\
    \ by an attacker PaC that\n   merely sends PCI messages.\n   [RFC5191] describes\
    \ how the PAA can stay stateless while responding\n   to incoming PCIs.  PAAs\
    \ using pre-authentication SHOULD be following\n   those guidelines (see [RFC5191],\
    \ Section 4.1).\n   Furthermore, it is recommended that PANA pre-authentication\
    \ messages\n   be only accepted from PaCs originating from well-known IP networks\n\
    \   (e.g., physically adjacent networks) for a given PAA.  These IP\n   networks\
    \ can be used with a whitelist implemented on either the\n   firewall protecting\
    \ the perimeter around the PAA or the PAA itself.\n   This prevention measure\
    \ SHOULD be used whenever it can be practically\n   applied to a given deployment.\n"
