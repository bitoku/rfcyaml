  - "Abstract\n   This document updates the specification of the WHOIS protocol,\n
    \  thereby obsoleting RFC 954.  The update is intended to remove the\n   material
    from RFC 954 that does not have to do with the on-the-wire\n   protocol, and is
    no longer applicable in today's Internet.  This\n   document does not attempt
    to change or update the protocol per se, or\n   document other uses of the protocol
    that have come into existence\n   since the publication of RFC 954.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   WHOIS is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response
    protocol\n   that is widely used to provide information services to Internet\n
    \  users.  While originally used to provide \"white pages\" services and\n   information
    about registered domain names, current deployments cover\n   a much broader range
    of information services.  The protocol delivers\n   its content in a human-readable
    format.  This document updates the\n   specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby
    obsoleting RFC 954 [1].\n   For historic reasons, WHOIS lacks many of the protocol
    design\n   attributes, for example internationalisation and strong security,\n
    \  that would be expected from any recently-designed IETF protocol.\n   This document
    does not attempt to rectify any of those shortcomings.\n   Instead, this memo
    documents the WHOIS protocol as it is.  In some\n   areas, this document does
    document particular well known shortcomings\n   of the WHOIS protocol.  The discussion
    of possible protocols to carry\n   out these functions, with updated capabilities
    to address the\n   shortcomings, is being addressed in a separate IETF activity
    (CRISP\n   Working Group).\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Specification\n   A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for requests
    from WHOIS\n   clients.  The WHOIS client makes a text request to the WHOIS server,\n
    \  then the WHOIS server replies with text content.  All requests are\n   terminated
    with ASCII CR and then ASCII LF.  The response might\n   contain more than one
    line of text, so the presence of ASCII CR or\n   ASCII LF characters does not
    indicate the end of the response.  The\n   WHOIS server closes its connection
    as soon as the output is finished.\n   The closed TCP connection is the indication
    to the client that the\n   response has been received.\n"

  - "3.  Protocol Example\n   If one places a request of the WHOIS server located
    at whois.nic.mil\n   for information about \"Smith\", the packets on the wire
    will look\n   like:\n   client                           server at whois.nic.mil\n
    \  open TCP   ---- (SYN) ------------------------------>\n              <----
    (SYN+ACK) -------------------------\n   send query ---- \"Smith<CR><LF>\" -------------------->\n
    \  get answer <---- \"Info about Smith<CR><LF>\" ---------\n              <----
    \"More info about Smith<CR><LF>\" ----\n   close      <---- (FIN) ------------------------------\n
    \             ----- (FIN) ----------------------------->\n"

  - "4.  Internationalisation\n   The WHOIS protocol has not been internationalised.
    \ The WHOIS\n   protocol has no mechanism for indicating the character set in
    use.\n   Originally, the predominant text encoding in use was US-ASCII.  In\n
    \  practice, some WHOIS servers, particularly those outside the USA,\n   might
    be using some other character set either for requests, replies,\n   or both.  This
    inability to predict or express text encoding has\n   adversely impacted the interoperability
    (and, therefore, usefulness)\n   of the WHOIS protocol.\n"
  title: 4.  Internationalisation
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The WHOIS protocol has no provisions for strong
    security.  WHOIS\n   lacks mechanisms for access control, integrity, and confidentiality.\n
    \  Accordingly, WHOIS-based services should only be used for information\n   which
    is non-sensitive and intended to be accessible to everyone.\n   The absence of
    such security mechanisms means this protocol would not\n   normally be acceptable
    to the IETF at the time of this writing.\n"
