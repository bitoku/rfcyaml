This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for the management of RS 232 like devices.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
Hardware Device MIB applies to interface ports that might logically support the Interface MIB, a Transmission MIB, or the Character MIB.
The most common example is an RS 232 port with modem signals.
Hardware Device MIB is mandatory for all systems that have such a hardware port supporting services managed through some other MIB.
The MIB includes multiple similar types of hardware, and as a result contains objects not applicable to all of those types.
The compliance definitions herein thus have a general group for all implementations, and separate groups for the different types of ports, such as asynchronous and synchronous.
The RS 232 like Hardware Port MIB includes RS 232, RS 422, RS 423, V.35, and other asynchronous or synchronous, serial physical links with a similar set of control signals.
The MIB contains objects that relate to physical layer connections.
Such connections may provide interesting hardware signals (other than for basic data transfer), such as RNG and DCD.
Hardware ports also have such attributes as speed and bits per character.
The MIB comprises one base object and four tables, detailed in the following sections.
The tables contain objects for all ports, asynchronous ports, and input and output control signals.
The RS 232 like MIB is one of many MIBs designed for layered use as described in the Interface MIB [5].
In most implementations where it is present, it will be in the lowest interface sublayer, that is, the RS 232 like MIB represents the physical layer, providing service to higher layers such as the Character MIB [6] or PPP MIB [7].
The Interface MIB's ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not relevant to the RS 232 like MIB.
The RS 232 like MIB is relevant for ifType values rs232(33), v35(45), and perhaps others.
The RS 232 like MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup, and ifFixedLengthGroup.
The value of ifSpeed is the same as rs232PortOutSpeed.
Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
