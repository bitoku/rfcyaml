  - "1.   INTRODUCTION\n   This document defines guidelines and procedures for Internet\
    \ Research\n   Task Force (IRTF) Research Groups.  The IRTF focuses on longer\
    \ term\n   research issues related to the Internet while the parallel\n   organization,\
    \ the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focuses on\n   the shorter term\
    \ issues of engineering and standards making.\n   The Internet is a loosely-organized\
    \ international collaboration of\n   autonomous, interconnected networks; it supports\
    \ host-to-host\n   communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols\
    \ and\n   procedures defined by Internet Standards, a collection of which are\n\
    \   commonly known as \"the TCP/IP protocol suite\".  Development and\n   review\
    \ of potential Internet Standards from all sources is conducted\n   by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The Internet\n   Standards Process is defined\
    \ in [1].\n   The IRTF is a composed of a number of focused, long-term, small\n\
    \   Research Groups.  These groups work on topics related to Internet\n   protocols,\
    \ applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups\n   are expected\
    \ to have the stable long term membership needed to\n   promote the development\
    \ of research collaboration and teamwork in\n   exploring research issues.  Participation\
    \ is by individual\n   contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations.\n\
    \   The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the\n   Internet\
    \ Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The IRSG membership\n   includes the IRTF Chair,\
    \ the chairs of the various Research Group and\n   possibly other individuals\
    \ (\"members at large\") from the research\n   community.\n   The IRTF Chair is\
    \ appointed by the IAB, the Research Group chairs are\n   appointed as part of\
    \ the formation of Research Groups (as detailed\n   below) and the IRSG members\
    \ at large are chosen by the IRTF Chair in\n   consultation with the rest of the\
    \ IRSG and on approval by the IAB.\n   In addition to managing the Research Groups,\
    \ the IRSG may from time\n   to time hold topical workshops focusing on research\
    \ areas of\n   importance to the evolution of the Internet, or more general\n\
    \   workshops to, for example, discuss research priorities from an\n   Internet\
    \ perspective.\n   This document defines procedures and guidelines for formation\
    \ and\n   operation of Research Groups in the IRTF.  The duties of the IRTF\n\
    \   Chair, the Research Group Chairs and IRSG members are also described.\n  \
    \ Except for members at large of the IRSG, there is no general\n   participation\
    \ in the IRTF, only participation in a specific Research\n   Group.\n   The document\
    \ uses: \"shall\", \"will\", \"must\" and \"is required\" where it\n   describes\
    \ steps in the process that are essential, and uses:\n   \"suggested\", \"should\"\
    \ and \"may\" where guidelines are described that\n   are not essential, but are\
    \ strongly recommended to help smooth\n   Research Group operation.  The terms\
    \ \"they\", \"them\" and \"their\" are\n   used in this document as third-person\
    \ singular pronouns.\n"
- title: 1.1. IRTF approach
  contents:
  - "1.1. IRTF approach\n   The reader is encouraged to study The Internet Standards\
    \ Process [1]\n   to gain a complete understanding of the philosophy, procedures\
    \ and\n   guidelines of the IETF and its approach to standards making.\n   The\
    \ IRTF does not set standards, and thus has somewhat different and\n   complementary\
    \ philosophy and procedures.  In particular, an IRTF\n   Research Group is expected\
    \ to be long-lived, producing a sequence of\n   \"products\" over time.  The products\
    \ of a Research Group are research\n   results that may be disseminated by publication\
    \ in scholarly journals\n   and conferences, as white papers for the community,\
    \ as Informational\n   RFCs, and so on.  In addition, it is expected that technologies\n\
    \   developed in a Research Group will be brought to the IETF as input to\n  \
    \ IETF Working Group(s) for possible standardization.   However,\n   Research\
    \ Group input carries no more weight than other community\n   input, and goes\
    \ through the same standards setting process as any\n   other proposal.\n   IRTF\
    \ Research Groups are formed to encourage research in areas of\n   importance\
    \ to the evolution of the Internet.  Clearly, anyone may\n   conduct such research,\
    \ whether or not they are members of a Research\n   Group.  The expectation is\
    \ that by sponsoring Research Groups, the\n   IRTF can foster cross-organizational\
    \ collaboration, help to create\n   \"critical mass\" in important research areas,\
    \ and add to the\n   visibility and impact of the work.\n   IRTF Research Groups\
    \ may have open or closed memberships.  Limited\n   membership may be advantageous\
    \ to the formation of the long term\n   working relationships that are critical\
    \ to successful collaborative\n   research.  However, limited membership must\
    \ be used with care and\n   sensitivity to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of\
    \ the work of the\n   research community. Allowing limited membership is in stark\
    \ contrast\n   to IETF Working Groups, which are always open; this contrast reflects\n\
    \   the different goals and environments of the two organizations-\n   research\
    \ vs. standards setting.\n   To ameliorate the effects of closed membership, all\
    \ Research Groups\n   are required to regularly report progress to the community,\
    \ and are\n   encouraged to hold occasional open meetings (most likely co-located\n\
    \   with IETF meetings). In addition, the IRTF may host open plenaries at\n  \
    \ regular IETF meetings during which research results of interest to\n   the community\
    \ are presented.  Finally, multiple Research Groups\n   working in the same general\
    \ area may be formed if appropriate.\n   Even more than the IETF, the work of\
    \ the IRSG is expected to be\n   marked by informality.  The goal is to encourage\
    \ and foster valuable\n   research, not to add burdensome bureaucracy to the endeavor.\n"

- title: 2.  RESEARCH GROUP FORMATION
  contents:
  - "2.  RESEARCH GROUP FORMATION\n   Research Groups are the activity centers in\
    \ the IRTF.  A Research\n   Group is typically created to address a research area\
    \ related to\n   Internet protocols, applications, architecture or technology\
    \ area.\n   Research Groups have the stable long term membership needed to\n \
    \  promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in\n   exploring\
    \ research issues.  Participation is by individual\n   contributors, rather than\
    \ by representatives of organizations.\n   A Research Group may be established\
    \ at the initiative of an\n   individual or group of individuals.  Anyone interested\
    \ in creating an\n   IRTF Research Group must submit a charter for the proposed\
    \ group to\n   the IRTF Chair along with a list of proposed founding members.\
    \  The\n   charter will be reviewed by the IRSG and then forwarded to the IAB\n\
    \   for approval.\n   If approved, the charter is placed on the IRTF Web site,\
    \ and\n   published in the Internet Monthly Report (IMR).\n"
- title: 2.1. Criteria for formation
  contents:
  - "2.1. Criteria for formation\n   In determining whether it is appropriate to create\
    \ a Research Group,\n   the IRTF Chair, the IRSG and the IAB will consider several\
    \ issues:\n   -  Is the research area that the Research Group plans to address\n\
    \      clear and relevant for the Internet community?\n   -  Will the formation\
    \ of the Research Group foster work that would\n      not be done otherwise. \
    \ For instance, membership drawn from more\n      than a single institution, more\
    \ than a single country, and so on,\n      is to be encouraged.\n   -  Do the\
    \ Research Group's activities overlap with those of another\n      Research Group?\
    \  If so, it may still be appropriate to create the\n      Research Group, but\
    \ this question must be considered carefully\n      since subdividing efforts\
    \ often dilutes the available technical\n      expertise.\n   -  Is there sufficient\
    \ interest and expertise in the Research Group's\n      topic with at least several\
    \ people willing to expend the effort\n      that is likely to produce significant\
    \ results over time?  Research\n      Groups require considerable effort, including\
    \ management of the\n      Research Group process, editing of Research Group documents,\
    \ and\n      contribution to the document text.  IRTF experience suggests that\n\
    \      these roles typically cannot all be handled by one person; at\n      least\
    \ four or five active participants are typically required.  To\n      help in\
    \ this determination, a proposal to create a Research Group\n      should include\
    \ a list of potential charter members.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\
    \ will also review the charter of\n   the proposed Research Group to determine\
    \ the relationship of the\n   proposed work to the overall architecture of the\
    \ Internet Protocol\n   Suite.\n"
- title: 2.2. Charter
  contents:
  - "2.2. Charter\n   A charter is a contract between a Research Group and the IRTF\
    \ to\n   conduct research in the designated area. Charters may be renegotiated\n\
    \   periodically to reflect changes to the current status, organization\n   or\
    \ goals of the Research Group.\n   The formation of a Research Group requires\
    \ a charter which is\n   initially negotiated between a prospective Research Group\
    \ Chair and\n   the IRTF Chair.  When the prospective Chair and the IRTF Chair\
    \ are\n   satisfied with the charter form and content, it becomes the basis for\n\
    \   forming a Research Group.\n   A IRTF Research Group charter consists of five\
    \ sections:\n   1.  Research Group Name\n      A Research Group name should be\
    \ reasonably descriptive or\n      identifiable.  Additionally, the group shall\
    \ define an acronym\n      (maximum 8 printable ASCII characters) to reference\
    \ the group in\n      the IRTF directories, mailing lists, and general documents.\
    \  The\n      name and acronym must not conflict with any IETF names and\n   \
    \   acronyms.\n   2.  Chair(s)\n      The Research Group may have one or two Chair(s)\
    \ to perform the\n      administrative functions of the group. The email address(es)\
    \ of\n      the Chair(s) shall be included.\n   3.  Mailing list(s)\n      Each\
    \ Research Group shall have an address (possibly the Chair's)\n      for members\
    \ of the Internet community to send queries regarding\n      the Research Group.\
    \    For instance, for requests to join the\n      group.\n      A Research Group,\
    \ whether limited membership or open, will have an\n      \"interest\" Internet\
    \ mailing list open to all interested parties.\n      This list is used for an\
    \ open discussion of the issues and\n      announcements of results as they become\
    \ available.  Included\n      should be the address to which an interested party\
    \ sends a\n      subscription request for the interest list and the procedures\
    \ to\n      follow when subscribing, and the location of the interest mailing\n\
    \      list archive.\n      It is expected that a Research Group may also have\
    \ a mailing list\n      limited to the regular meeting participants on which substantial\n\
    \      part of the work of a Research Group is likely to be conducted via\n  \
    \    e-mail.\n   4.  Membership Policy\n      The Charter must define the membership\
    \ policy (whether open or\n      limited), and the procedure to apply for membership\
    \ in the group.\n      While limited membership is permitted, it is in no way\
    \ encouraged\n      or required.\n   5.  Description of Research Group\n     \
    \ The focus and intent of the group shall be set forth briefly. By\n      reading\
    \ this section alone, an individual should be able to decide\n      whether this\
    \ group is relevant to their own work.  The first\n      paragraph must give a\
    \ brief summary of the research area, basis,\n      goal(s) and approach(es) planned\
    \ for the Research Group.  This\n      paragraph will frequently be used as an\
    \ overview of the Research\n      Group's effort.\n      To facilitate evaluation\
    \ of the intended work and to provide on-\n      going guidance to the Research\
    \ Group, the charter shall describe\n      the proposed research and shall discuss\
    \ objectives and expected\n      impact with respect to the Internet Architecture.\n"
- title: 3.  RESEARCH GROUP OPERATION
  contents:
  - "3.  RESEARCH GROUP OPERATION\n   Research Groups are autonomous and each determines\
    \ most of the\n   details of its own operation with respect to session participation,\n\
    \   reaching closure, norms of behavior, etc.  Since the products are\n   research\
    \ results, not Internet standards, consensus of the group is\n   not required.\
    \  Rather, the measure of success is the quality and\n   impact of the research\
    \ results.\n   A number of procedural questions and issues will arise over time,\
    \ and\n   it is the function of the Research Group Chair to manage the group\n\
    \   process, keeping in mind that the overall purpose of the group is to\n   make\
    \ progress towards realizing the Research Group's goals and\n   objectives.\n\
    \   There are few hard and fast rules on organizing or conducting\n   Research\
    \ Group activities, but a set of guidelines and practices have\n   evolved over\
    \ time that have proven successful. These are listed here,\n   with actual choices\
    \ typically determined by the Research Group\n   members and the Chair.\n"
- title: 3.1. Meeting planning
  contents:
  - "3.1. Meeting planning\n   For coordinated, structured Research Group interactions,\
    \ the Chair\n   must publish to the group mailing list a draft agenda well in\
    \ advance\n   of the actual meeting. The agenda needs to contain at least:\n \
    \  -    The items for discussion;\n   -    The estimated time necessary per item;\
    \ and\n   -    A clear indication of what documents the participants will\n  \
    \      need to read before the meeting in order to be well\n        prepared.\n\
    \   A Research Group will conduct much of its business via its electronic\n  \
    \ mail distribution list(s).  It is also likely to meet periodically to\n   accomplish\
    \ those things that are better achieved in more interactive\n   meetings, such\
    \ as brainstorming, heated altercations, etc.  Meetings\n   may be scheduled as\
    \ telephone conference, video teleconference, or\n   face-to-face (physical) meetings.\n\
    \   It is strongly encouraged that all Research Group meetings be\n   recorded\
    \ in written minutes, to keep informed members who were not\n   present and the\
    \ community at large and to document the proceedings\n   for present and future\
    \ members.  These minutes should include the\n   agenda for the meeting, an account\
    \ of the high points of the\n   discussion, and a list of attendees.  Unless the\
    \ Research Group chair\n   decides otherwise, the minutes should be sent to the\
    \ interest group\n   and made available through the IRTF Web and ftp sites.\n"
- title: 3.2. Meeting venue
  contents:
  - "3.2. Meeting venue\n   Each Research Group will determine the balance of email\
    \ and face-to-\n   face meetings that is appropriate for making progress on its\
    \ goals.\n   Electronic mail permits the easiest and most affordable\n   participation;\
    \ face-to-face meetings often permit better focus, more\n   productive debate\
    \ and enhanced working relationships.\n   Face-to-face meetings are encouraged\
    \ to be held co-located with the\n   regular IETF meetings to minimize travel,\
    \ since IRTF members are\n   often also active in the IETF and to encourage the\
    \ cross-\n   fertilization that occurs during hallway and after-hours\n   interactions.\
    \  Furthermore, as described above, even limited-\n   membership Research Groups\
    \ are encouraged to hold occasional open\n   meetings; an IETF meeting would serve\
    \ as an ideal venue for such an\n   event.\n"
- title: 3.3. Meeting management
  contents:
  - "3.3. Meeting management\n   The challenge to managing Research Group meetings\
    \ is to balance the\n   need for consideration of the various issues, opinions\

    \ Group, as a\n   whole, has the final responsibility for striking this balance.\n"

    \ its charter, or\n   fails to regularly report the results of its research to\
    \ the\n   community, the IRTF Chair can, in consultation with Group, either:\n\
    \      1.   Require that the group recharter to refocus on a different\n     \
    \ set of problems,\n      2.   Request that the group choose new Chair(s), or\n\

  - "6.2. Request For Comments (RFC)\n   The work of an IRTF Research Group usually\
    \ results in publication of\n   research papers and other documents, as well as\
    \ documents as part of\n   the Informational or Experimental Request For Comments\
    \ (RFCs) series\n   [1].  This series is the archival publication record for the\
    \ Internet\n   community.  A document can be written by an individual in a Research\n\
    \   Group, by a group as a whole with a designated Editor, or by others\n   not\
    \ involved with the IRTF.  The designated author(s) need not\n   include the group\
    \ Chair(s).\n   NOTE: The RFC series is a publication mechanism only and publication\n\
    \   does not determine the status of a document.  Status is determined\n   through\
    \ separate, explicit status labels.  In other words, the reader\n   is reminded\
    \ that all Internet Standards are published as RFCs, but\n   NOT all RFCs specify\
    \ standards.\n   The RFC's authors are expected to work with the RFC Editor to\
    \ meet\n   all formatting, review and other requirements that the Editor may\n\
    \   impose. Usually, in case of a submission intended as an Informational\n  \
    \ or Experimental RFC minimal review is necessary, although publication\n   in\
    \ the Experimental track generally requires IESG review.  However,\n   in all\
    \ cases initial publication as an Internet Draft is preferred.\n   If the Research\
    \ Group or the RFC Editor thinks that an extensive\n   review is appropriate,\
    \ the IRTF Chair may be asked to conduct one.\n   This review may either be done\
    \ by the IRTF Chair, the IRSG, or an\n   independent reviewer selected by the\
    \ IRTF Chair.  Occasionally,\n   review by the IETF or IESG may be appropriate.\n"
