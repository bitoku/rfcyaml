Abstract This memo documents an experiment to review and classify Proposed Standards as not reflecting documented practice within the world today.
The results identify a set of documents that were marked as Proposed Standards that are now reclassified as Historic.
1.  Introduction and History RFC 2026, and RFC 1602 before it, specified timelines for review of immature (draft or proposed) standards.
The purpose of such review was to determine whether such documents should be advanced, retired, or developed further [1].
This procedure has never been followed in the history of the IETF.
Since this procedure has not been followed, members of the community have suggested that the retiring of a document to Historic is a significant event, which should be justified carefully   leading to the production of documents such as RFC 2556 (OSI Connectionless Transport Services on top of UDP Applicability Statement for Historic Status) and RFC 3166 (Request to Move RFC 1403 to Historic Status).
Such documents require significant time and effort on the part of authors, area directors, and the RFC Editor.
Bulk Decommissioning Procedure From the Fall of 2004 through the Spring of 2005, the authors conducted an experiment to determine how many Proposed Standards could be considered obsolete.
The experiment was operated as follows:
Identify a group of documents that are standards.
Assume by default that each document will be retired.
Create a mailing list for discussion with a policy of open access.
Allow any document to be removed from the list of those to be retired for virtually any reason, so long as a reason is provided.
Present the list to the working group, IETF, and IESG for review.
Revise list based on comments.
The initial intent of the authors was to present a list of documents to be reclassified as Historic.
The NEWTRK working group supported this view.
The IESG, and the IETF as a community, makes the final decision.
We will discuss this further below.
Input, Mailing list, Output, and Observations
We started with our initial document set being all RFCs with numbers less than 2000 and a status of Proposed Standard.
The input we used, starting November 25, 2004, can be found in Appendix A.
There were some 125 documents in all.
A mailing list, old standards@alvestrand.no, was created to discuss and remove candidates from this list.
A call for participation was issued to the IETF Announce list on or around the November 15, 2004.
There were 29 members of the mailing list.
Approximately 244 messages were sent to the list.
People were encouraged to consider the question of whether or not an implementer would either write a new implementation or maintain an existing one.
After some months the list of documents to be considered was reduced considerably.
This list was then forwarded to the IETF discussion list on December 16, 2004, and to the NEWTRK working group list for wider review.
During review, RFCs 1518 and 1519 were removed, based on the fact that work is ongoing to revise them.
Similarly, RFCs 1381, 1382, 1471, 1472, 1473, 1582, 1598, and 1755 were removed based on the belief that they were actively in use.
RFC 1584 was removed based on an expected future dependency.

One additional document, RFC 1829, the ESP DES CBC transform, was suggested for Historic status, but in this case, the group consensus is that the community would benefit from a separate document describing the security implications of using this algorithm.
As one peruses this list one sees several classes of documents:  Multiprotocol functions for protocols that are obsolete, such as Appletalk or X.400.
Protocols that were defined but not used, such as PEM or Whois
In either case above, a judgment is necessary as to whether or not a protocol is both in use and likely to be supported.
The parameters of our experiment were sufficiently conservative to avoid cases where protocols were likely to continue to be supported.
That is, anyone could remove a document from the list for any reason.
In fact, in some cases we may have been too conservative.
Thus, it is also worth considering the categories of documents that were removed from the list:  specifications known to be in full use that should be considered for advancement  specifications that are currently under review within the IETF process  Specifications that were previously considered for deprecation and rejected.
The last category is exclusive to telnet options, which were reviewed in the late 1990s.
Arguably, such options should be reconsidered for deprecation.
Realistically, nobody is going to develop a new version of telnet that supports the TACACS option, for instance.
Nevertheless, as a first cut we were still left with 61 documents that could be reclassified.
In at least one case, discussion of deprecation has spurred work on documents.
For instance, there is a Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) update in progress.
As we mention in the introduction, the current process requires reconsideration of immature standards, and this review currently does not occur.
This experiment has been an attempt at a procedure that could ease that review.
The final step was working group consideration of what to do next.
There were four options: 1.
Accept the results of this experiment, issue a last call, and deprecate standards that remain on the list past last call.
This is an aggressive approach that would preserve the intent of RFC 2026.
Do not accept the results of this experiment and update RFC 2026 to indicate a new practice.
Revise the procedure based on the results of this experiment, based on feedback from the IESG.
This option might take into account the different types of old standards as described above.
This would leave the IETF and the IESG practice inconsistent with documented practice.
The working group chose the first option.
The RFC Editor is requested to mark the above listed standards as Historic.
It should be pointed out that we only looked at proposed standards and only those RFCs with numbers less than 2000.
Should either the first or third of the above options be accepted, draft standards and those older than several years should be considered.
Finally, should NEWTRK deliver a new document classification system, these documents may provide a basis for one or more new categories of that.
The IANA databases contain references to many of these documents.
The documents are still the normative definitions for these values, and the IANA databases do not contain information about the status of the RFCs referred to.
Therefore, the IANA should not need to do anything based on this document.
Security Considerations Documents that have security problems may require special attention and individual documents to indicate what concerns exist, and when or in what ways an implementation can be deployed to alleviate concerns.
