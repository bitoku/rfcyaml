  - "1. Introduction\n   With recent performance advancements in computer and wireless\n\
    \   communications technologies, advanced mobile wireless computing is\n   expected\
    \ to see increasingly widespread use and application, much of\n   which will involve\
    \ the use of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. The\n   vision of mobile ad hoc\
    \ networking is to support robust and efficient\n   operation in mobile wireless\
    \ networks by incorporating routing\n   functionality into mobile nodes.  Such\
    \ networks are envisioned to\n   have dynamic, sometimes rapidly-changing, random,\
    \ multihop topologies\n   which are likely composed of relatively bandwidth-constrained\n\
    \   wireless links.\n   Within the Internet community, routing support for mobile\
    \ hosts is\n   presently being formulated as \"mobile IP\" technology.  This is\
    \ a\n   technology to support nomadic host \"roaming\", where a roaming host\n\
    \   may be connected through various means to the Internet other than its\n  \
    \ well known fixed-address domain space. The host may be directly\n   physically\
    \ connected to the fixed network on a foreign subnet, or be\n   connected via\
    \ a wireless link, dial-up line, etc.  Supporting this\n   form of host mobility\
    \ (or nomadicity) requires address management,\n   protocol interoperability enhancements\
    \ and the like, but core network\n   functions such as hop-by-hop routing still\
    \ presently rely upon pre-\n   existing routing protocols operating within the\
    \ fixed network. In\n   contrast, the goal of mobile ad hoc networking is to extend\
    \ mobility\n   into the realm of autonomous, mobile, wireless domains, where a\
    \ set\n   of nodes--which may be combined routers and hosts--themselves form\n\
    \   the network routing infrastructure in an ad hoc fashion.\n"
- title: 2. Applications
  contents:
  - "2. Applications\n   The technology of Mobile Ad hoc Networking is somewhat synonymous\n\
    \   with Mobile Packet Radio Networking (a term coined via during early\n   military\
    \ research in the 70's and 80's), Mobile Mesh Networking (a\n   term that appeared\
    \ in an article in The Economist regarding the\n   structure of future military\
    \ networks) and Mobile, Multihop, Wireless\n   Networking (perhaps the most accurate\
    \ term, although a bit\n   cumbersome).\n   There is current and future need for\
    \ dynamic ad hoc networking\n   technology.  The emerging field of mobile and\
    \ nomadic computing, with\n   its current emphasis on mobile IP operation, should\
    \ gradually broaden\n   and require highly-adaptive mobile networking technology\
    \ to\n   effectively manage multihop, ad hoc network clusters which can\n   operate\
    \ autonomously or, more than likely, be attached at some\n   point(s) to the fixed\
    \ Internet.\n   Some applications of MANET technology could include industrial\
    \ and\n   commercial applications involving cooperative mobile data exchange.\n\
    \   In addition,  mesh-based mobile networks can be operated as robust,\n   inexpensive\
    \ alternatives or enhancements to cell-based mobile network\n   infrastructures.\
    \ There are also existing and future military\n   networking requirements for\
    \ robust, IP-compliant data services within\n   mobile wireless communication\
    \ networks [1]--many of these networks\n   consist of highly-dynamic autonomous\
    \ topology segments. Also, the\n   developing technologies of \"wearable\" computing\
    \ and communications\n   may provide applications for MANET technology. When properly\
    \ combined\n   with satellite-based information delivery, MANET technology can\n\
    \   provide an extremely flexible method for establishing communications\n   for\
    \ fire/safety/rescue operations or other scenarios requiring\n   rapidly-deployable\
    \ communications with survivable, efficient dynamic\n   networking. There are\
    \ likely other applications for MANET technology\n   which are not presently realized\
    \ or envisioned by the authors.  It\n   is, simply put, improved IP-based networking\
    \ technology for dynamic,\n   autonomous wireless networks.\n"
- title: 3. Characteristics of MANETs
  contents:
  - "3. Characteristics of MANETs\n   A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g.,\
    \ a router with multiple\n   hosts and wireless communications devices)--herein\
    \ simply referred to\n   as \"nodes\"--which are free to move about arbitrarily.\
    \ The nodes may\n   be located in or on airplanes, ships, trucks, cars, perhaps\
    \ even on\n   people or very small devices, and there may be multiple hosts per\n\
    \   router. A MANET is an autonomous system of mobile nodes.  The system\n   may\
    \ operate in isolation, or may have gateways to and interface with\n   a fixed\
    \ network. In the latter operational mode, it is typically\n   envisioned to operate\
    \ as a \"stub\" network connecting to a fixed\n   internetwork.  Stub networks\
    \ carry traffic originating at and/or\n   destined for internal nodes, but do\
    \ not permit exogenous traffic to\n   \"transit\" through the stub network.\n\
    \   MANET nodes are equipped with wireless transmitters and receivers\n   using\
    \ antennas which may be omnidirectional (broadcast), highly-\n   directional (point-to-point),\
    \ possibly steerable, or some combination\n   thereof. At a given point in time,\
    \ depending on the nodes' positions\n   and their transmitter and receiver coverage\
    \ patterns, transmission\n   power levels and co-channel interference levels,\
    \ a wireless\n   connectivity in the form of a random, multihop graph or \"ad\
    \ hoc\"\n   network exists between the nodes.  This ad hoc topology may change\n\
    \   with time as the nodes move or adjust their transmission and\n   reception\
    \ parameters.\n   MANETs have several salient characteristics:\n      1) Dynamic\
    \ topologies: Nodes are free to move arbitrarily; thus,\n      the network topology--which\
    \ is typically multihop--may change\n      randomly and rapidly at unpredictable\
    \ times, and may consist of\n      both bidirectional and unidirectional links.\n\
    \      2) Bandwidth-constrained, variable capacity links: Wireless links\n   \
    \   will continue to have significantly lower capacity than their\n      hardwired\
    \ counterparts. In addition, the realized throughput of\n      wireless communications--after\
    \ accounting for the effects of\n      multiple access, fading, noise, and interference\
    \ conditions,\n      etc.--is often much less than a radio's maximum transmission\
    \ rate.\n      One effect of the relatively low to moderate link capacities is\n\
    \      that congestion is typically the norm rather than the exception,\n    \
    \  i.e.  aggregate application demand will likely approach or exceed\n      network\
    \ capacity frequently. As the mobile network is often simply\n      an extension\
    \ of the fixed network infrastructure, mobile ad hoc\n      users will demand\
    \ similar services. These demands will continue to\n      increase as multimedia\
    \ computing and collaborative networking\n      applications rise.\n      3) Energy-constrained\
    \ operation: Some or all of the nodes in a\n      MANET may rely on batteries\
    \ or other exhaustible means for their\n      energy. For these nodes, the most\
    \ important system design criteria\n      for optimization may be energy conservation.\n\
    \      4) Limited physical security: Mobile wireless networks are\n      generally\
    \ more prone to physical security threats than are fixed-\n      cable nets. \
    \ The increased possibility of eavesdropping, spoofing,\n      and denial-of-service\
    \ attacks should be carefully considered.\n      Existing link security techniques\
    \ are often applied within\n      wireless networks to reduce security threats.\
    \ As a benefit, the\n      decentralized nature of network control in MANETs provides\n\
    \      additional robustness against the single points of failure of more\n  \
    \    centralized approaches.\n   In addition, some envisioned networks (e.g. mobile\
    \ military networks\n   or highway networks) may be relatively large (e.g. tens\
    \ or hundreds\n   of nodes per routing area).  The need for scalability is not\
    \ unique\n   to MANETS. However, in light of the preceding characteristics, the\n\
    \   mechanisms required to achieve scalability likely are.\n   These characteristics\
    \ create a set of underlying assumptions and\n   performance concerns for protocol\
    \ design which extend beyond those\n   guiding the design of routing within the\
    \ higher-speed, semi-static\n   topology of the fixed Internet.\n"
- title: 4. Goals of IETF Mobile Ad Hoc Network (manet) Working Group
  contents:
  - "4. Goals of IETF Mobile Ad Hoc Network (manet) Working Group\n   The intent of\
    \ the newly formed IETF manet working group is to develop\n   a peer-to-peer mobile\
    \ routing capability in a purely mobile, wireless\n   domain.  This capability\
    \ will exist beyond the fixed network (as\n   supported by traditional IP networking)\
    \ and beyond the one-hop fringe\n   of the fixed network.\n   The near-term goal\
    \ of the manet working group is to standardize one\n   (or more) intra-domain\
    \ unicast routing protocol(s), and related\n   network-layer support technology\
    \ which:\n      * provides for effective operation over a wide range of mobile\n\
    \      networking \"contexts\" (a context is a set of characteristics\n      describing\
    \ a mobile network and its environment);\n      * supports traditional, connectionless\
    \ IP service;\n      * reacts efficiently to topological changes and traffic demands\n\
    \      while maintaining effective routing in a mobile networking\n      context.\n\
    \   The working group will also consider issues pertaining to addressing,\n  \
    \ security, and interaction/interfacing with lower and upper layer\n   protocols.\
    \ In the longer term, the group may look at the issues of\n   layering more advanced\
    \ mobility services on top of the initial\n   unicast routing developed.  These\
    \ longer term issues will likely\n   include investigating multicast and QoS extensions\
    \ for a dynamic,\n   mobile area.\n"
- title: 5. IP-Layer Mobile Routing
  contents:
  - "5. IP-Layer Mobile Routing\n   An improved mobile routing capability at the IP\
    \ layer can provide a\n   benefit similar to the intention of the original Internet,\
    \ viz. \"an\n   interoperable internetworking capability over a heterogeneous\n\
    \   networking infrastructure\". In this case, the infrastructure is\n   wireless,\
    \ rather than hardwired, consisting of multiple wireless\n   technologies, channel\
    \ access protocols, etc.  Improved IP routing and\n   related networking services\
    \ provide the glue to preserve the\n   integrity of the mobile internetwork segment\
    \ in this more dynamic\n   environment.\n   In other words, a real benefit to\
    \ using IP-level routing in a MANET\n   is to provide network-level consistency\
    \ for multihop networks\n   composed of nodes using a *mixture* of physical-layer\
    \ media; i.e. a\n   mixture of what are commonly thought of as subnet technologies.\
    \  A\n   MANET node principally consists of a router, which may be physically\n\
    \   attached to multiple IP hosts (or IP-addressable devices), which has\n   potentially\
    \ *multiple* wireless interfaces--each interface using a\n   *different* wireless\
    \ technology.  Thus, a MANET node with interfaces\n   using technologies A and\
    \ B can communicate with any other MANET node\n   possessing an interface with\
    \ technology A or B.  The multihop\n   connectivity of technology A forms a physical-layer\
    \ multihop\n   topology, the multihop connectivity of technology B forms *another*\n\
    \   physical-layer topology (which may differ from that of A's topology),\n  \
    \ and the *union* of these topologies forms another topology (in graph\n   theoretic\
    \ terms--a multigraph), termed the \"IP routing fabric\", of\n   the MANET.  MANET\
    \ nodes making routing decisions using the IP fabric\n   can intercommunicate\
    \ using either or both physical-layer topologies\n   simultaneously.  As new physical-layer\
    \ technologies are developed,\n   new device drivers can be written and another\
    \ physical-layer multihop\n   topology can be seamlessly added to the IP fabric.\
    \  Likewise, older\n   technologies can easily be dropped.  Such is the functionality\
    \ and\n   architectural flexibility that IP-layer routing can support, which\n\
    \   brings with it hardware economies of scale.\n   The concept of a \"node identifier\"\
    \ (separate and apart from the\n   concept of an \"interface identifier\") is\
    \ crucial to supporting the\n   multigraph topology of the routing fabric. It\
    \ is what *unifies* a set\n   of wireless interfaces and identifies them as belonging\
    \ to the same\n   mobile platform.  This approach permits maximum flexibility\
    \ in\n   address assignment.  Node identifiers are used at the IP layer for\n\
    \   routing computations.\n"
- title: 5.1. Interaction with Standard IP Routing
  contents:
  - "5.1. Interaction with Standard IP Routing\n   In the near term, it is currently\
    \ envisioned that MANETs will\n   function as *stub* networks, meaning that all\
    \ traffic carried by\n   MANET nodes will either be sourced or sinked within the\
    \ MANET.\n   Because of bandwidth and possibly power constraints, MANETs are not\n\
    \   presently envisioned to function as *transit* networks carrying\n   traffic\
    \ which enters and then leaves the MANET (although this\n   restriction may be\
    \ removed by subsequent technology advances).  This\n   substantially reduces\
    \ the amount of route advertisement required for\n   interoperation with the existing\
    \ fixed Internet. For stub operation,\n   routing interoperability in the near\
    \ term may be achieved using some\n   combination of mechanisms such as MANET-based\
    \ anycast and mobile IP.\n   Future interoperability may be achieved using mechanisms\
    \ other than\n   mobile IP.\n   Interaction with Standard IP Routing will be greatly\
    \ facilitated by\n   usage of a common MANET addressing approach by all MANET\
    \ routing\n   protocols. Development of such an approach is underway which permits\n\
    \   routing through a multi-technology fabric, permits multiple hosts per\n  \
    \ router and ensures long-term interoperability through adherence to\n   the IP\
    \ addressing architecture.  Supporting these features appears\n   only to require\
    \ identifying host and router interfaces with IP\n   addresses, identifying a\
    \ router with a separate Router ID, and\n   permitting routers to have multiple\
    \ wired and wireless interfaces.\n"
- title: 6. MANET Routing Protocol Performance Issues
  contents:
  - "6. MANET Routing Protocol Performance Issues\n   To judge the merit of a routing\
    \ protocol, one needs metrics--both\n   qualitative and quantitative--with which\
    \ to measure its suitability\n   and performance.  These metrics should be *independent*\
    \ of any given\n   routing protocol.\n   The following is a list of desirable\
    \ qualitative properties of MANET\n   routing protocols:\n      1) Distributed\
    \ operation:  This is an essential property, but it\n      should be stated nonetheless.\n\
    \      2) Loop-freedom:  Not required per se in light of certain\n      quantitative\
    \ measures (i.e. performance criteria), but generally\n      desirable to avoid\
    \ problems such as worst-case phenomena, e.g. a\n      small fraction of packets\
    \ spinning around in the network for\n      arbitrary time periods.  Ad hoc solutions\
    \ such as TTL values can\n      bound the problem, but a more structured and well-formed\
    \ approach\n      is generally desirable as it usually leads to better overall\n\
    \      performance.\n      3) Demand-based operation:  Instead of assuming an\
    \ uniform traffic\n      distribution within the network (and maintaining routing\
    \ between\n      all nodes at all times), let the routing algorithm adapt to the\n\
    \      traffic pattern on a demand or need basis.  If this is done\n      intelligently,\
    \ it can utilize network energy and bandwidth\n      resources more efficiently,\
    \ at the cost of increased route\n      discovery delay.\n      4) Proactive operation:\
    \  The flip-side of demand-based operation.\n      In certain contexts, the additional\
    \ latency demand-based operation\n      incurs may be unacceptable.  If bandwidth\
    \ and energy resources\n      permit, proactive operation is desirable in these\
    \ contexts.\n      5) Security: Without some form of network-level or link-layer\n\
    \      security, a MANET routing protocol is vulnerable to many forms of\n   \
    \   attack.  It may be relatively simple to snoop network traffic,\n      replay\
    \ transmissions, manipulate packet headers, and redirect\n      routing messages,\
    \ within a wireless network without appropriate\n      security provisions. While\
    \ these concerns exist within wired\n      infrastructures and routing protocols\
    \ as well, maintaining the\n      \"physical\" security of of the transmission\
    \ media is harder in\n      practice with MANETs. Sufficient security protection\
    \ to prohibit\n      disruption of modification of protocol operation is desired.\
    \ This\n      may be somewhat orthogonal to any particular routing protocol\n\
    \      approach, e.g. through the application of IP Security techniques.\n   \
    \   6) \"Sleep\" period operation:  As a result of energy conservation,\n    \
    \  or some other need to be inactive, nodes of a MANET may stop\n      transmitting\
    \ and/or receiving (even receiving requires power) for\n      arbitrary time periods.\
    \  A routing protocol should be able to\n      accommodate such sleep periods\
    \ without overly adverse\n      consequences. This property may require close\
    \ coupling with the\n      link-layer protocol through a standardized interface.\n\
    \      7) Unidirectional link support:  Bidirectional links are typically\n  \
    \    assumed in the design of routing algorithms, and many algorithms\n      are\
    \ incapable of functioning properly over unidirectional links.\n      Nevertheless,\
    \ unidirectional links can and do occur in wireless\n      networks. Oftentimes,\
    \ a sufficient number of duplex links exist so\n      that usage of unidirectional\
    \ links is of limited added value.\n      However, in situations where a pair\
    \ of unidirectional links (in\n      opposite directions) form the only bidirectional\
    \ connection\n      between two ad hoc regions, the ability to make use of them\
    \ is\n      valuable.\n   The following is a list of quantitative metrics that\
    \ can be used to\n   assess the performance of any routing protocol.\n      1)\
    \ End-to-end data throughput and delay: Statistical measures of\n      data routing\
    \ performance (e.g., means, variances, distributions)\n      are important. These\
    \ are the measures of a routing policy's\n      effectiveness--how well it does\
    \ its job--as measured from the\n      *external* perspective of other policies\
    \ that make use of routing.\n      2) Route Acquisition Time: A particular form\
    \ of *external* end-\n      to-end delay measurement--of particular concern with\
    \ \"on demand\"\n      routing algorithms--is the time required to establish route(s)\n\
    \      when requested.\n      3) Percentage Out-of-Order Delivery: An external\
    \ measure of\n      connectionless routing performance of particular interest\
    \ to\n      transport layer protocols such as TCP which prefer in-order\n    \
    \  delivery.\n      4) Efficiency:  If data routing effectiveness is the external\n\
    \      measure of a policy's performance, efficiency is the *internal*\n     \
    \ measure of its effectiveness.  To achieve a given level of data\n      routing\
    \ performance, two different policies can expend differing\n      amounts of overhead,\
    \ depending on their internal efficiency.\n      Protocol efficiency may or may\
    \ not directly affect data routing\n      performance.  If control and data traffic\
    \ must share the same\n      channel, and the channel's capacity is limited, then\
    \ excessive\n      control traffic often impacts data routing performance.\n \
    \     It is useful to track several ratios that illuminate the\n      *internal*\
    \ efficiency of a protocol in doing its job (there may be\n      others that the\
    \ authors have not considered):\n         * Average number of data bits transmitted/data\
    \ bit delivered--\n         this can be thought of as a measure of the bit efficiency\
    \ of\n         delivering data within the network.  Indirectly, it also gives\n\
    \         the average hop count taken by data packets.\n         * Average number\
    \ of control bits transmitted/data bit\n         delivered--this measures the\
    \ bit efficiency of the protocol in\n         expending control overhead to delivery\
    \ data.  Note that this\n         should include not only the bits in the routing\
    \ control\n         packets, but also the bits in the header of the data packets.\n\
    \         In other words, anything that is not data is control overhead,\n   \
    \      and should be counted in the control portion of the algorithm.\n      \
    \   * Average number of control and data packets transmitted/data\n         packet\
    \ delivered--rather than measuring pure algorithmic\n         efficiency in terms\
    \ of bit count, this measure tries to capture\n         a protocol's channel access\
    \ efficiency, as the cost of channel\n         access is high in contention-based\
    \ link layers.\n   Also, we must consider the networking *context* in which a\
    \ protocol's\n   performance is measured.  Essential parameters that should be\
    \ varied\n   include:\n      1) Network size--measured in the number of nodes\n\
    \      2) Network connectivity--the average degree of a node (i.e. the\n     \
    \ average number of neighbors of a node)\n      3) Topological rate of change--the\
    \ speed with which a network's\n      topology is changing\n      4) Link capacity--effective\
    \ link speed measured in bits/second,\n      after accounting for losses due to\
    \ multiple access, coding,\n      framing, etc.\n      5) Fraction of unidirectional\
    \ links--how effectively does a\n      protocol perform as a function of the presence\
    \ of unidirectional\n      links?\n      6) Traffic patterns--how effective is\
    \ a protocol in adapting to\n      non-uniform or bursty traffic patterns?\n \
    \     7) Mobility--when, and under what circumstances, is temporal and\n     \
    \ spatial topological correlation relevant to the performance of a\n      routing\
    \ protocol?  In these cases, what is the most appropriate\n      model for simulating\
    \ node mobility in a MANET?\n      8) Fraction and frequency of sleeping nodes--how\
    \ does a protocol\n      perform in the presence of sleeping and awakening nodes?\n\
    \   A MANET protocol should function effectively over a wide range of\n   networking\
    \ contexts--from small, collaborative, ad hoc groups to\n   larger mobile, multihop\
    \ networks.  The preceding discussion of\n   characteristics and evaluation metrics\
    \ somewhat differentiate MANETs\n   from traditional, hardwired, multihop networks.\
    \  The wireless\n   networking environment is one of scarcity rather than abundance,\n\
    \   wherein bandwidth is relatively limited, and energy may be as well.\n   In\
    \ summary, the networking opportunities for MANETs are intriguing\n   and the\
    \ engineering tradeoffs are many and challenging.  A diverse\n   set of performance\
    \ issues requires new protocols for network control.\n   A question which arises\
    \ is \"how should the *goodness* of a policy be\n   measured?\". To help answer\
    \ that, we proposed here an outline of\n   protocol evaluation issues that highlight\
    \ performance metrics that\n   can help promote meaningful comparisons and assessments\
    \ of protocol\n   performance.  It should be recognized that a routing protocol\
    \ tends\n   to be well-suited for particular network contexts, and less well-\n\
    \   suited for others. In putting forth a description of a protocol, both\n  \
    \ its *advantages* and *limitations* should be mentioned so that the\n   appropriate\
    \ networking context(s) for its usage can be identified.\n   These attributes\
    \ of a protocol can typically be expressed\n   *qualitatively*, e.g., whether\
    \ the protocol can or cannot support\n   shortest-path routing.  Qualitative descriptions\
    \ of this nature\n   permit broad classification of protocols, and form a basis\
    \ for more\n   detailed *quantitative* assessments of protocol performance. In\n\
    \   future documents, the group may put forth candidate recommendations\n   regarding\
    \ protocol design for MANETs. The metrics and the philosophy\n   presented within\
    \ this document are expected to continue to evolve as\n   MANET technology and\
    \ related efforts mature.\n"

  - "7. Security Considerations\n   Mobile wireless networks are generally more prone\
    \ to physical\n   security threats than are fixed, hardwired networks. Existing\
    \ link-\n   level security techniques (e.g. encryption) are often applied within\n\
    \   wireless networks to reduce these threats.  Absent link-level\n   encryption,\
    \ at the network layer, the most pressing issue is one of\n   inter-router authentication\
    \ prior to the exchange of network control\n   information.  Several levels of\
    \ authentication ranging from no\n   security (always an option) and simple shared-key\
    \ approaches, to full\n   public key infrastructure-based authentication mechanisms\
    \ will be\n   explored by the group.  As an adjunct to the working groups efforts,\n\
    \   several optional authentication modes may be standardized for use in\n   MANETs.\n"
