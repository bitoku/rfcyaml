  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport\n
    \  Security Layer (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia encryption\n   algorithm
    as a block cipher.  It amends the cipher suites originally\n   specified in RFC
    4132 by introducing counterparts using the newer\n   cryptographic hash algorithms
    from the SHA-2 family.  This document\n   obsoletes RFC 4132.\n"
