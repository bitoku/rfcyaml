  - "Abstract\n   On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access
    to\n   various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-\n   text
    password mechanism using \"anonymous\" as the user name and using\n   optional
    trace information, such as an email address, as the\n   password.  As plain-text
    login commands are not permitted in new IETF\n   protocols, a new way to provide
    anonymous login is needed within the\n   context of the Simple Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL)\n   framework.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an anonymous mechanism for the Simple\n
    \  Authentication and Security Layer ([SASL]) framework.  The name\n   associated
    with this mechanism is \"ANONYMOUS\".\n   Unlike many other SASL mechanisms, whose
    purpose is to authenticate\n   and identify the user to a server, the purpose
    of this SASL mechanism\n   is to allow the user to gain access to services or
    resources without\n   requiring the user to establish or otherwise disclose their
    identity\n   to the server.  That is, this mechanism provides an anonymous login\n
    \  method.\n   This mechanism does not provide a security layer.\n   This document
    replaces RFC 2245.  Changes since RFC 2245 are detailed\n   in Appendix A.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  The Anonymous Mechanism\n   The mechanism consists of a single message from
    the client to the\n   server.  The client may include in this message trace information
    in\n   the form of a string of [UTF-8]-encoded [Unicode] characters prepared\n
    \  in accordance with [StringPrep] and the \"trace\" stringprep profile\n   defined
    in Section 3 of this document.  The trace information, which\n   has no semantical
    value, should take one of two forms: an Internet\n   email address, or an opaque
    string that does not contain the '@'\n   (U+0040) character and that can be interpreted
    by the system\n   administrator of the client's domain.  For privacy reasons,
    an\n   Internet email address or other information identifying the user\n   should
    only be used with permission from the user.\n   A server that permits anonymous
    access will announce support for the\n   ANONYMOUS mechanism and allow anyone
    to log in using that mechanism,\n   usually with restricted access.\n   A formal
    grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF [ABNF] is\n   provided below
    as a tool for understanding this technical\n   specification.\n      message     =
    [ email / token ]\n                    ;; to be prepared in accordance with Section
    3\n      UTF1        = %x00-3F / %x41-7F ;; less '@' (U+0040)\n      UTF2        =
    %xC2-DF UTF0\n      UTF3        = %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF0 / %xE1-EC 2(UTF0) /\n                    %xED
    %x80-9F UTF0 / %xEE-EF 2(UTF0)\n      UTF4        = %xF0 %x90-BF 2(UTF0) / %xF1-F3
    3(UTF0) /\n                    %xF4 %x80-8F 2(UTF0)\n      UTF0        = %x80-BF\n
    \     TCHAR       = UTF1 / UTF2 / UTF3 / UTF4\n                    ;; any UTF-8
    encoded Unicode character\n                    ;; except '@' (U+0040)\n      email
    \      = addr-spec\n                    ;; as defined in [IMAIL]\n      token
    \      = 1*255TCHAR\n   Note to implementors:\n      The <token> production is
    restricted to 255 UTF-8-encoded Unicode\n      characters.  As the encoding of
    a characters uses a sequence of 1\n      to 4 octets, a token may be as long as
    1020 octets.\n"

  - "3.  The \"trace\" Profile of \"Stringprep\"\n   This section defines the \"trace\"
    profile of [StringPrep].  This\n   profile is designed for use with the SASL ANONYMOUS
    Mechanism.\n   Specifically, the client is to prepare the <message> production
    in\n   accordance with this profile.\n   The character repertoire of this profile
    is Unicode 3.2 [Unicode].\n   No mapping is required by this profile.\n   No Unicode
    normalization is required by this profile.\n   The list of unassigned code points
    for this profile is that provided\n   in Appendix A of [StringPrep].  Unassigned
    code points are not\n   prohibited.\n   Characters from the following tables of
    [StringPrep] are prohibited:\n      - C.2.1 (ASCII control characters)\n      -
    C.2.2 (Non-ASCII control characters)\n      - C.3 (Private use characters)\n      -
    C.4 (Non-character code points)\n      - C.5 (Surrogate codes)\n      - C.6 (Inappropriate
    for plain text)\n      - C.8 (Change display properties are deprecated)\n      -
    C.9 (Tagging characters)\n   No additional characters are prohibited.\n   This
    profile requires bidirectional character checking per Section 6\n   of [StringPrep].\n"

  - "4.  Example\n   Here is a sample ANONYMOUS login between an IMAP client and server.\n
    \  In this example, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and\n
    \  server, respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without a new \"C:\"\n   or
    \"S:\" label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is not\n   part of
    the command.\n   Note that this example uses the IMAP profile [IMAP4] of SASL.
    \ The\n   base64 encoding of challenges and responses as well as the \"+ \"\n
    \  preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of\n   SASL
    itself.  Additionally, protocols with SASL profiles permitting\n   an initial
    client response will be able to avoid the extra round trip\n   below (the server
    response with an empty \"+ \").\n   In this example, the trace information is
    \"sirhc\".\n      S: * OK IMAP4 server ready\n      C: A001 CAPABILITY\n      S:
    * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=ANONYMOUS\n      S: A001 OK
    done\n      C: A002 AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS\n      S: +\n      C: c2lyaGM=\n      S:
    A003 OK Welcome, trace information has been logged.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The ANONYMOUS mechanism grants access to services
    and/or resources by\n   anyone.  For this reason, it should be disabled by default
    so that\n   the administrator can make an explicit decision to enable it.\n   If
    the anonymous user has any write privileges, a denial-of-service\n   attack is
    possible by filling up all available space.  This can be\n   prevented by disabling
    all write access by anonymous users.\n   If anonymous users have read and write
    access to the same area, the\n   server can be used as a communication mechanism
    to exchange\n   information anonymously.  Servers that accept anonymous submissions\n
    \  should implement the common \"drop box\" model, which forbids anonymous\n   read
    access to the area where anonymous submissions are accepted.\n   If the anonymous
    user can run many expensive operations (e.g., an\n   IMAP SEARCH BODY command),
    this could enable a denial-of-service\n   attack.  Servers are encouraged to reduce
    the priority of anonymous\n   users or limit their resource usage.\n   While servers
    may impose a limit on the number of anonymous users,\n   note that such limits
    enable denial-of-service attacks and should be\n   used with caution.\n   The
    trace information is not authenticated, so it can be falsified.\n   This can be
    used as an attempt to get someone else in trouble for\n   access to questionable
    information.  Administrators investigating\n   abuse need to realize that this
    trace information may be falsified.\n   A client that uses the user's correct
    email address as trace\n   information without explicit permission may violate
    that user's\n   privacy.  Anyone who accesses an anonymous archive on a sensitive\n
    \  subject (e.g., sexual abuse) likely has strong privacy needs.\n   Clients should
    not send the email address without the explicit\n   permission of the user and
    should offer the option of supplying no\n   trace information, thus only exposing
    the source IP address and time.\n   Anonymous proxy servers could enhance this
    privacy but would have to\n   consider the resulting potential denial-of-service
    attacks.\n   Anonymous connections are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks\n
    \  that view or alter the data transferred.  Clients and servers are\n   encouraged
    to support external data security services.\n   Protocols that fail to require
    an explicit anonymous login are more\n   susceptible to break-ins given certain
    common implementation\n   techniques.  Specifically, Unix servers that offer user
    login may\n   initially start up as root and switch to the appropriate user id\n
    \  after an explicit login command.  Normally, such servers refuse all\n   data
    access commands prior to explicit login and may enter a\n   restricted security
    environment (e.g., the Unix chroot(2) function)\n   for anonymous users.  If anonymous
    access is not explicitly\n   requested, the entire data access machinery is exposed
    to external\n   security attacks without the chance for explicit protective measures.\n
    \  Protocols that offer restricted data access should not allow\n   anonymous
    data access without an explicit login step.\n   General [SASL] security considerations
    apply to this mechanism.\n   [StringPrep] security considerations and [Unicode]
    security\n   considerations discussed in [StringPrep] apply to this mechanism.\n
    \  [UTF-8] security considerations also apply.\n"
