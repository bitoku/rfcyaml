  - "1.  Abstract\n   There is a need in Internet mail and Internet fax for a recipient
    to\n   indicate the media features it supports so that messages can be\n   generated
    by senders without exceeding the recipient's abilities.\n   This memo describes
    a format for generating Message Disposition\n   Notifications [RFC2298] and Delivery
    Status Notifications [RFC1894]\n   which contain such information.  This information
    can be used by\n   senders to avoid exceeding the recipient's capabilities when
    sending\n   subsequent messages.\n"
  title: 1.  Abstract
- contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   The extensions described in this document can be used in
    Message\n   Disposition Notifications [RFC2298] or Delivery Status Notifications\n
    \  [RFC1894], as appropriate for the implementation.\n   Note that both DSNs and
    MDNs have drawbacks: DSNs are not available\n   between all senders and receivers,
    and MDNs require the receiver to\n   disclose message disposition information
    (or, if using the \"denied\"\n   disposition-type, the time the disposition notification
    was\n   generated).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "3.  Extensions for use by DSN and MDN\n   The following extension is available
    to both DSN [RFC1894] and MDN\n   [RFC2298] messages.\n   For a DSN message, the
    following per-recipient fields are defined\n   (section 2.3 of [RFC1894]).  For
    an MDN message, the following\n   extension fields are defined (section 3.1 of
    [RFC2298]).  Using the\n   language of [RFC2234]:\n      extension-field    =
    media-features CRLF\n      media-features     = \"Media-Accept-Features\" \":\"\n
    \                           media-feature-tags\n      media-feature-tags = <*text
    as defined below,\n                            with LWSP wrapping>\n   The <media-feature-tags>
    are defined in separate schema documents\n   which MUST utilize the language described
    in [SYNTAX].  The schema\n   MUST be registered following the registration requirements
    of\n   [RFC2506].\n"

    - "3.1.  Examples\n   The following examples assume there is a schema document
      which\n   defines the tags shown.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.1.1.  Paper-size and Color\n   Assuming there is a schema document which
        describes the tags paper-\n   size and color, the following example is valid:\n
        \     Media-Accept-Features: (& (paper-size=a4) (color=binary) )\n"

  - "4.  MTA Implmentation Recommendation\n   If the recipient's MTA determines that
    a message cannot be processed,\n   the recipient's MTA is strongly encouraged
    to reject the message with\n   a status code of 5.6.1 [RFC1893].  This status
    code may be returned\n   in response to the end-of-mail-data indicator if the
    MTA supports\n   reporting of enhanced error codes [RFC2034], or after message\n
    \  reception by generating a delivery failure DSN (\"bounce\").\n"
  title: 4.  MTA Implmentation Recommendation
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Inaccurate media feature information could cause
    a denial of service,\n   causing subsequent messages to be sent which the recipient
    is unable\n   to process.\n   The media feature information could be inaccurate
    due to a malicious\n   attack (spoofed DSN or MDN) or misconfiguration.\n"
