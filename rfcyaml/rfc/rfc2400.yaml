    \ of the standardization process and the RFC document\n   series is presented\
    \ first, followed by an explanation of the terms.\n   Sections 6.2 - 6.10 contain\
    \ the lists of protocols in each stage of\n   standardization.  Finally, there\
    \ are pointers to references and\n   contacts for further information.\n   This\
    \ memo is intended to be issued every one hundred RFCs; please be\n   sure the\
    \ copy you are reading is current.  Current copies may be\n   obtained from the\
    \ Requests for Comments Editor (RFC-EDITOR) or from\n   the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA) (see the contact\n   information at the end of this\
    \ memo).\n   See Section 6.1 for a description of recent changes.  In the official\n\
    \   lists in sections 6.2 - 6.10, an asterisk (*) next to a protocol\n   denotes\
    \ that it is new to this document or has been moved from one\n   protocol level\
    \ to another, or differs from the previous edition of\n   this document.\n1. \
    \ The Standardization Process\n   The Internet Architecture Board maintains this\
    \ list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite.\
    \  See RFC-1601 for\n   the charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation\
    \ of the role\n   and organization of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the Internet\n\
    \   Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force\n   (IRTF).\
    \  Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESG\n   and IRSG, respectively.\
    \  The IETF develops these standards with the\n   goal of co-ordinating the evolution\
    \ of the Internet protocols; this\n   co-ordination has become quite important\
    \ as the Internet protocols\n   are increasingly in general commercial use.  The\
    \ definitive\n   description of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-2026.\n\
    \   The majority of Internet protocol development and standardization\n   activity\
    \ takes place in the working groups of the IETF.\n   Protocols which are to become\
    \ standards in the Internet go through a\n   series of states or maturity levels\
    \ (proposed standard, draft\n   standard, and standard) involving increasing amounts\
    \ of scrutiny and\n   testing.  When a protocol completes this process it is assigned\
    \ a STD\n   number (see RFC-1311).  At each step, the Internet Engineering\n \
    \  Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation for\n   advancement\
    \ of the protocol.\n   To allow time for the Internet community to consider and\
    \ react to\n   standardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before a\n\
    \   proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 months\n   before\
    \ a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\n   It is general practice that\
    \ no proposed standard can be promoted to\n   draft standard without at least\
    \ two independent implementations (and\n   the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion\
    \ from draft standard to\n   standard generally requires operational experience\
    \ and demonstrated\n   interoperability of two or more implementations (and the\n\
    \   recommendation of the IESG).\n   In cases where there is uncertainty as to\
    \ the proper decision\n   concerning a protocol a special review committee may\
    \ be appointed\n   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with\
    \ the\n   purpose of recommending an explicit action.\n   Advancement of a protocol\
    \ to proposed standard is an important step\n   since it marks a protocol as a\
    \ candidate for eventual standardization\n   (it puts the protocol \"on the standards\
    \ track\").  Advancement to\n   draft standard is a major step which warns the\
    \ community that, unless\n   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered,\
    \ the protocol is\n   likely to be advanced to standard.\n   Some protocols have\
    \ been superseded by better ones or are otherwise\n   unused.  Such protocols\
    \ are still documented in this memorandum with\n   the designation \"historic\"\
    .\n   Because it is useful to document the results of early protocol\n   research\
    \ and development work, some of the RFCs document protocols\n   which are still\
    \ in an experimental condition.  The protocols are\n   designated \"experimental\"\
    \ in this memorandum.  They appear in this\n   report as a convenience to the\
    \ community and not as evidence of their\n   standardization.\n   Other protocols,\
    \ such as those developed by other standards\n   organizations, or by particular\
    \ vendors, may be of interest or may be\n   recommended for use in the Internet.\
    \  The specifications of such\n   protocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the\n   Internet community.  These protocols are labeled \"informational\"\
    \ in\n   this memorandum.\n   In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol\
    \ development\n   and experimentation may take place as a result of the work of\
    \ the\n   research groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of\n\
    \   other individuals interested in Internet protocol development.  The\n   the\
    \ documentation of such experimental work in the RFC series is\n   encouraged,\
    \ but none of this work is considered to be on the track\n   for standardization\
    \ until the IESG has made a recommendation to\n   advance the protocol to the\
    \ proposed standard state.\n   A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation\
    \ without the\n   approval of the IESG.  For example, some vendor protocols have\
    \ become\n   very important to the Internet community even though they have not\n\
    \   been recommended by the IESG.  However, the IAB strongly recommends\n   that\
    \ the standards process be used in the evolution of the protocol\n   suite to\
    \ maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatible\n   protocol requirements\
    \ from arising).  The use of the terms\n   \"standard\", \"draft standard\", and\
    \ \"proposed standard\" are reserved in\n   any RFC or other publication of Internet\
    \ protocols to only those\n   protocols which the IESG has approved.\n   In addition\
    \ to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is also\n   assigned a status,\
    \ or requirement level, in this document.  The\n   possible requirement levels\
    \ (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\",\n   \"Limited Use\", and \"Not\
    \ Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.\n   When a protocol is on the standards\
    \ track, that is in the proposed\n   standard, draft standard, or standard state\
    \ (see Section 5), the\n   status shown in Section 6 is the current status.\n\
    \   Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems; this is\n   because\
    \ there is such a variety of possible systems, for example,\n   gateways, routers,\
    \ terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user\n   hosts.  The requirement level\
    \ shown in this document is only a one\n   word label, which may not be sufficient\
    \ to characterize the\n   implementation requirements for a protocol in all situations.\
    \  For\n   some protocols, this document contains an additional status paragraph\n\
    \   (an applicability statement).  In addition, more detailed status\n   information\
    \ may be contained in separate requirements documents (see\n   Section 3).\n2.\
    \  The Request for Comments Documents\n   The documents called Request for Comments\
    \ (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is\
    \ the Internet research\n   and development community.  A document in this series\
    \ may be on\n   essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may\
    \ be\n   anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.\n\
    \   Notice:\n      All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n\
    \      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\
    \  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the\
    \ contact\n   information at the end of this memo, and see RFC 2223).\n   While\
    \ RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technical\n   review from\
    \ the task forces, individual technical experts, or the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n\
    \   The RFC series comprises a wide range of documents, ranging from\n   informational\
    \ documents of general interests to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols.\
    \  In cases where submission is intended\n   to document a proposed standard,\
    \ draft standard, or standard\n   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document\
    \ only with the\n   approval of the IESG.  For documents describing experimental\
    \ work,\n   the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before publication, allowing for\n\
    \   the possibility of review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTF\n   research\
    \ group and provide those comments to the author.  See Section\n   5.1 for more\
    \ detail.\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC\
    \ is\n   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\n\
    \   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However,\
    \ a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented\
    \ many times in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you\
    \ have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"Internet Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\"\n   memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC\
    \ for the current\n   specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available\
    \ from the RFC-EDITOR, and a number of other\n   sites.  For more information\
    \ about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4\n   and 7.5.\n3.  Other Reference Documents\n\
    \   There are three other reference documents of interest in checking the\n  \
    \ current status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These\n   are\
    \ the Assigned Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the Host\n   Requirements.\
    \  Note that these documents are revised and updated at\n   different times; in\
    \ case of differences between these documents, the\n   most recent must prevail.\n\
    \   Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet,\
    \ FTP, and SMTP.  These are described in Section 3.4.\n3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n\
    \   The \"Assigned Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of the\n   parameters\
    \ used in the various protocols.  For example, IP protocol\n   codes, TCP port\
    \ numbers, Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and\n   Terminal Type names.\
    \  Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as\n   RFC-1700.\n3.2.  Requirements\
    \ for IP Version 4 Routers\n   This document reviews the specifications that apply\
    \ to gateways and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\n\
    \   Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers is RFC-1812.\n3.3.  Host Requirements\n\
    \   This pair of documents reviews and updates the specifications that\n   apply\
    \ to hosts, and it supplies guidance and clarification for any\n   ambiguities.\
    \  Host Requirements was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n3.4.  The MIL-STD Documents\n\
    \   The DoD MIL-STD Internet specifications are out of date and have been\n  \
    \ discontinued.  The DoD's Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) lists the\n   current\
    \ set of IETF STDs and RFCs that the DoD intends to use in all\n   new and upgraded\
    \ Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and\n   Intelligence (C4I) acquisitions.\
    \  A copy of the JTA can be obtained\n   from http://www-jta.itsi.disa.mil.\n\
    4.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.\
    \  The first is\n   the \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of\
    \ \"standard\",\n   \"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\"\
    ,\n   \"informational\" or \"historic\".  The second is the \"requirement level\"\
    \n   or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n   \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   The status or requirement\
    \ level is difficult to portray in a one word\n   label.  These status labels\
    \ should be considered only as an\n   indication, and a further description, or\
    \ applicability statement,\n   should be consulted.\n   When a protocol is advanced\
    \ to proposed standard or draft standard,\n   it is labeled with a current status.\n\
    \   At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.\n  \
    \ Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions (indicated\
    \ by the relative number of Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely to start in\
    \ the (proposed standard, elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental, limited use)\
    \ cell.\n                             S T A T U S\n                     Req  \

    \   What is a \"system\"?\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some\
    \ to gateways; a few\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the\
    \ terms below\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway\
    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \
    \     protocol which types of systems are intended.\n4.1.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ State\n   Every protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturity\n\
    \   level\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\n \
    \  \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".\n   4.1.1.  Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IESG has established this as an official standard protocol\
    \ for\n      the Internet.  These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-\n\
    \      1311).  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol and\n    \
    \  above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)\n      network-specific\
    \ protocols, generally specifications of how to do\n      IP on particular types\
    \ of networks.\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\n      The IESG is actively\
    \ considering this protocol as a possible\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial\
    \ and widespread testing and comment\n      are desired.  Comments and test results\
    \ should be submitted to the\n      IESG.  There is a possibility that changes\
    \ will be made in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard\
    \ Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals\
    \ that may be considered by the IESG\n      for standardization in the future.\
    \  Implementation and testing by\n      several groups is desirable.  Revision\
    \ of the protocol\n      specification is likely.\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n\
    \      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\n    \
    \  is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\n      the\
    \ protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically, experimental\
    \ protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of an ongoing research\
    \ project not related to an operational\n      service offering.  While they may\
    \ be proposed as a service\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed\
    \ standard,\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation\
    \ of a\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that\n\
    \      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for\n      operational\
    \ use.\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\n      Protocols developed by other\
    \ standard organizations, or vendors,\n      or that are for other reasons outside\
    \ the purview of the IESG, may\n      be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the Internet community\n      as informational protocols.\n   4.1.6.  Historic\
    \ Protocol\n      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards\
    \ in\n      the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\n \
    \     developments or due to lack of interest.\n4.2.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ Status\n      This document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for each\n\
    \      protocol.  The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n      \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required Protocol\n\
    \      A system must implement the required protocols.\n   4.2.2.  Recommended\
    \ Protocol\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\n   4.2.3.\
    \  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol.\
    \ The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,\n\
    \      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\n  \
    \    in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\n     \
    \ protocols, and several routing protocols.\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\n\
    \      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\n  \
    \    because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality,\
    \ or historic state.\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols\
    \ are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic state.\n\
    5.  The Standards Track\n   This section discusses in more detail the procedures\
    \ used by the RFC\n   Editor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling\
    \ and\n   publishing of protocols as standards.\n5.1.  The RFC Processing Decision\
    \ Table\n   Here is the current decision table for processing submissions by the\n\
    \   RFC Editor.  The processing depends on who submitted it, and the\n   status\
    \ they want it to have.\n      +==========================================================+\n\

    \ Editor.  Documents from\n   Area Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered\
    \ in the same\n   way as documents from \"other\".\n5.2.  The Standards Track\
    \ Diagram\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is called\n\
    \   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes of state are\n   significant\
    \ to the progression along the standards track, though the\n   status assignments\
    \ may change as well.\n   The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary\
    \ states,\n   those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states.  A\n\
    \   protocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state for\n  \
    \ several months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimum\n   four months\
    \ for draft standard).  A protocol may be in a long term\n   state for many years.\n\
    \   A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendation\n   of\
    \ the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the track\n   only on\
    \ the recommendation of the IESG.  That is, it takes action by\n   the IESG to\
    \ either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\n   Generally, as\
    \ the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\n   made as to the eventual\
    \ STATUS, requirement level or applicability\n   (elective, recommended, or required)\
    \ the protocol will have, although\n   a somewhat less stringent current status\
    \ may be assigned, and it then\n   is placed in the the proposed standard STATE\
    \ with that status.  So\n   the initial placement of a protocol is into state\
    \ 1.  At any time the\n   STATUS decision may be revisited.\n         |\n    \

    \                                         +===========+\n   The transition from\
    \ proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can\n   only be by action of the\
    \ IESG and only after the protocol has been\n   proposed standard (1) for at least\
    \ six months.\n   The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only\
    \ be by\n   action of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draft\n  \
    \ standard (2) for at least four months.\n   Occasionally, the decision may be\
    \ that the protocol is not ready for\n   standardization and will be assigned\
    \ to the experimental state (4).\n   This is off the standards track, and the\
    \ protocol may be resubmitted\n   to enter the standards track after further work.\
    \  There are other\n   paths into the experimental and historic states that do\
    \ not involve\n   IESG action.\n   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another\
    \ and thus becomes\n   historic, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards\
    \ track is\n   in a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) and\n\
    \   becomes historic (state 5).\n6.  The Protocols\n   Subsection 6.1 lists recent\

    \  IGMP -- The Internet Architecture Board intends to move towards\n   general\
    \ adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution\n   than broadcasting\
    \ for many applications.  The host interface has been\n   standardized in RFC-1112;\
    \ however, multicast-routing gateways are in\n   the experimental stage and are\
    \ not widely available.  An Internet\n   host should support all of RFC-1112,\
    \ except for the IGMP protocol\n   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for\
    \ more details.  Even\n   without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide\
    \ an important\n   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing.\
    \  It\n   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and\n  \
    \ gateways at some future date.\n   SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board recommends that\n   all IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.\
    \  At the current\n   time, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II\
    \ (RFC-1213),\n   and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n\
    \   RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n   and\
    \ used in the Internet.  However, both implementors and users\n   should be aware\
    \ that RIP has some serious technical limitations as a\n   routing protocol. \
    \ The IETF is currently devpeloping several\n   candidates for a new standard\
    \ \"open\" routing protocol with better\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges\
    \ the Internet community to track\n   these developments, and to implement the\
    \ new protocol when it is\n   standardized; improved Internet service will result\
    \ for many users.\n   TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented\
    \ and used,\n   there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with\
    \ the\n   TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\n\
    \   strategies for interoperation.  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\n   mode,\
    \ in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSI\n   applications.\
    \  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n   applications in this mode\
    \ should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.  In the future, the IAB\
    \ expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will support both TCP/IP and\
    \ OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it will then be possible\
    \ to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\"\

    6.10.  Obsolete Protocols\n   Some of the protocols listed in this memo are described\
    \ in RFCs that\n   are obsoleted by newer RFCs.  \"Obsolete\" or \"obsoleted\"\
    \ is not an\n   official state or status of protocols.  This subsection is for\n\
    \   information only.\n   While it may seem to be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted\
    \ RFC in\n   the list of standards, there may be cases when an older standard\
    \ is\n   in the process of being replaced.  This process may take a year or\n\
    \   two.\n   Many obsoleted protocols are of little interest and are dropped from\n\
    \   this memo altogether.  Some obsoleted protocols have received enough\n   recognition\
    \ that it seems appropriate to list them under their\n   current status and with\
    \ the following reference to their current\n   replacement.\n   RFC          \
