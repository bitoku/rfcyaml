- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This RFC describes methods to preserve IP address space by\
    \ not\n   allocating globally unique IP addresses to hosts private to an\n   enterprise\
    \ while still permitting full network layer connectivity\n   between all hosts\
    \ inside an enterprise as well as between all public\n   hosts of different enterprises.\
    \ The authors hope, that using these\n   methods, significant savings can be made\
    \ on allocating IP address\n   space.\n   For the purposes of this memo, an enterprise\
    \ is an entity\n   autonomously operating a network using TCP/IP and in particular\n\
    \   determining the addressing plan and address assignments within that\n   network.\n"
- title: 2. Motivation
  contents:
  - "2. Motivation\n   With the proliferation of TCP/IP technology worldwide, including\n\
    \   outside the Internet itself, an increasing number of non-connected\n   enterprises\
    \ use this technology and its addressing capabilities for\n   sole intra-enterprise\
    \ communications, without any intention to ever\n   directly connect to other\
    \ enterprises or the Internet itself.\n   The current practice is to assign globally\
    \ unique addresses to all\n   hosts that use TCP/IP.  There is a growing concern\
    \ that the finite IP\n   address space might become exhausted.  Therefore, the\
    \ guidelines for\n   assigning IP address space have been tightened in recent\
    \ years [1].\n   These rules are often more conservative than enterprises would\
    \ like,\n   in order to implement and operate their networks.\n   Hosts within\
    \ enterprises that use IP can be partitioned into three\n   categories:\n    \
    \  - hosts that do not require access to hosts in other enterprises\n        or\
    \ the Internet at large;\n      - hosts that need access to a limited set of outside\
    \ services\n        (e.g., E-mail, FTP, netnews, remote login) which can be handled\n\
    \        by application layer gateways;\n      - hosts that need network layer\
    \ access outside the enterprise\n        (provided via IP connectivity);\n   \
    \   - hosts within the first category may use IP addresses that are\n        unambiguous\
    \ within an enterprise, but may be ambiguous between\n        enterprises.\n \
    \  For many hosts in the second category an unrestricted external access\n   (provided\
    \ via IP connectivity) may be unnecessary and even\n   undesirable for privacy/security\
    \ reasons.  Just like hosts within the\n   first category, such hosts may use\
    \ IP addresses that are unambiguous\n   within an enterprise, but may be ambiguous\
    \ between enterprises.\n   Only hosts in the last category require IP addresses\
    \ that are\n   globally unambiguous.\n   Many applications require connectivity\
    \ only within one enterprise and\n   do not even need external connectivity for\
    \ the majority of internal\n   hosts.  In larger enterprises it is often easy\
    \ to identify a\n   substantial number of hosts using TCP/IP that do not need\
    \ network\n   layer connectivity outside the enterprise.\n   Some examples, where\
    \ external connectivity might not be required,\n   are:\n      - A large airport\
    \ which has its arrival/departure displays\n        individually addressable via\
    \ TCP/IP. It is very unlikely that\n        these displays need to be directly\
    \ accessible from other\n         networks.\n      - Large organisations like\
    \ banks and retail chains are switching\n        to TCP/IP for their internal\
    \ communication.  Large numbers of\n        local workstations like cash registers,\
    \ money machines, and\n        equipment at clerical positions rarely need to\
    \ have such\n        connectivity.\n      - For security reasons, many enterprises\
    \ use application layer\n        gateways (e.g., firewalls) to connect their internal\
    \ network to\n        the Internet.  The internal network usually does not have\
    \ direct\n        access to the Internet, thus only one or more firewall hosts\
    \ are\n        visible from the Internet.  In this case, the internal network\n\
    \        can use non-unique IP numbers.\n      - If two enterprises communicate\
    \ over their own private link,\n        usually only a very limited set of hosts\
    \ is mutually reachable\n        from the other enterprise over this link. Only\
    \ those hosts need\n        globally unique IP numbers.\n      - Interfaces of\
    \ routers on an internal network usually do not\n        need to be directly accessible\
    \ from outside the enterprise.\n"
- title: 3. Private Address Space
  contents:
  - "3. Private Address Space\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has\
    \ reserved the\n   following three blocks of the IP address space for private\
    \ networks:\n        10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255\n        172.16.0.0  \
    \    -   172.31.255.255\n        192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255\n   We will\
    \ refer to the first block as \"24-bit block\", the second as\n   \"20-bit block,\
    \ and to the third as \"16-bit\" block.  Note that the\n   first block is nothing\
    \ but a single class A network number, while the\n   second block is a set of\
    \ 16 contiguous class B network numbers, and\n   third block is a set of 255 contiguous\
    \ class C network numbers.\n   An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses\
    \ out of the address\n   space defined in this document can do so without any\
    \ coordination\n   with IANA or an Internet registry.  The address space can thus\
    \ be\n   used by many enterprises.  Addresses within this private address\n  \
    \ space will only be unique within the enterprise.\n   As before, any enterprise\
    \ that needs globally unique address space is\n   required to obtain such addresses\
    \ from an Internet registry.  An\n   enterprise that requests IP addresses for\
    \ its external connectivity\n   will never be assigned addresses from the blocks\
    \ defined above.\n   In order to use private address space, an enterprise needs\
    \ to\n   determine which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity\n\
    \   outside the enterprise in the foreseeable future.  Such hosts will be\n  \
    \ called private hosts, and will use the private address space defined\n   above.\
    \  Private hosts can communicate with all other hosts inside the\n   enterprise,\
    \ both public and private.  However, they cannot have IP\n   connectivity to any\
    \ external host.  While not having external network\n   layer connectivity private\
    \ hosts can still have access to external\n   services via application layer relays.\n\
    \   All other hosts will be called public and will use globally unique\n   address\
    \ space assigned by an Internet Registry.  Public hosts can\n   communicate with\
    \ other hosts inside the enterprise both public and\n   private and can have IP\
    \ connectivity to external public hosts.\n   Public hosts do not have connectivity\
    \ to private hosts of other\n   enterprises.\n   Moving a host from private to\
    \ public or vice versa involves a change\n   of IP address.\n   Because private\
    \ addresses have no global meaning, routing information\n   about private networks\
    \ shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise\n   links, and packets with private\
    \ source or destination addresses\n   should not be forwarded across such links.\
    \  Routers in networks not\n   using private address space, especially those of\
    \ Internet service\n   providers, are expected to be configured to reject (filter\
    \ out)\n   routing information about private networks.  If such a router\n   receives\
    \ such information the rejection shall not be treated as a\n   routing protocol\
    \ error.\n   Indirect references to such addresses should be contained within\
    \ the\n   enterprise.  Prominent examples of such references are DNS Resource\n\
    \   Records and other information referring to internal private\n   addresses.\
    \  In particular, Internet service providers should take\n   measures to prevent\
    \ such leakage.\n"
- title: 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Private Address Space
  contents:
  - "4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Private Address Space\n   The obvious\
    \ advantage of using private address space for the Internet\n   at large is to\
    \ conserve the globally unique address space by not\n   using it where global\
    \ uniqueness is not required.\n   Enterprises themselves also enjoy a number of\
    \ benefits from their\n   usage of private address space: They gain a lot of flexibility\
    \ in\n   network design by having more address space at their disposal than\n\
    \   they could obtain from the globally unique pool.  This enables\n   operationally\
    \ and administratively convenient addressing schemes as\n   well as easier growth\
    \ paths.\n   For a variety of reasons the Internet has already encountered\n \
    \  situations where an enterprise that has not between connected to the\n   Internet\
    \ had used IP address space for its hosts without getting this\n   space assigned\
    \ from the IANA.  In some cases this address space had\n   been already assigned\
    \ to other enterprises.  When such an enterprise\n   later connects to the Internet,\
    \ it could potentially create very\n   serious problems, as IP routing cannot\
    \ provide correct operations in\n   presence of ambiguous addressing.  Using private\
    \ address space\n   provides a safe choice for such enterprises, avoiding clashes\
    \ once\n   outside connectivity is needed.\n   One could argue that the potential\
    \ need for renumbering represents a\n   significant drawback of using the addresses\
    \ out of the block\n   allocated for private internets.  However, we need to observe\
    \ that\n   the need is only \"potential\", since many hosts may never move into\n\
    \   the third category, and an enterprise may never decide to\n   interconnect\
    \ (at IP level) with another enterprise.\n   But even if renumbering has to happen,\
    \ we have to observe that with\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) an enterprise\
    \ that is connected\n   to the Internet may be encouraged to renumber its public\
    \ hosts, as it\n   changes its Network Service Providers.  Thus renumbering is\
    \ likely to\n   happen more often in the future, regardless of whether an enterprise\n\
    \   does or does not use the addresses out of the block allocated for\n   private\
    \ networks.  Tools to facilitate renumbering (e.g., DHCP) would\n   certainly\
    \ make it less of a concern.\n   Also observe that the clear division of public\
    \ and private hosts and\n   the resulting need to renumber makes uncontrolled\
    \ outside\n   connectivity more difficult, so to some extend the need to renumber\n\
    \   could be viewed as an advantage.\n"
- title: 5. Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Operational Considerations\n   A recommended strategy is to design the private\
    \ part of the network\n   first and use private address space for all internal\
    \ links.  Then\n   plan public subnets at the locations needed and design the\
    \ external\n   connectivity.\n   This design is not fixed permanently.  If a number\
    \ of hosts require\n   to change status later this can be accomplished by renumbering\
    \ only\n   the hosts involved and installing another physical subnet if\n   required.\n\
    \   If a suitable subnetting scheme can be designed and is supported by\n   the\
    \ equipment concerned, it is advisable to use the 24-bit block of\n   private\
    \ address space and make an addressing plan with a good growth\n   path.  If subnetting\
    \ is a problem, the 16-bit class C block, which\n   consists of 255 contiguous\
    \ class C network numbers, can be used.\n   Using multiple IP (sub)nets on the\
    \ same physical medium has many\n   pitfalls. We recommend to avoid it unless\
    \ the operational problems\n   are well understood and it is proven that all equipment\
    \ supports this\n   properly.\n   Moving a single host between private and public\
    \ status will involve a\n   change of address and in most cases physical connectivity.\
    \  In\n   locations where such changes can be foreseen (machine rooms etc.)  it\n\
    \   may be advisable to configure separate physical media for public and\n   private\
    \ subnets to facilitate such changes.\n   Changing the status of all hosts on\
    \ a whole (sub)network can be done\n   easily and without disruption for the enterprise\
    \ network as a whole.\n   Consequently it is advisable to group hosts whose connectivity\
    \ needs\n   might undergo similar changes in the future on their own subnets.\n\
    \   It is strongly recommended that routers which connect enterprises to\n   external\
    \ networks are set up with appropriate packet and routing\n   filters at both\
    \ ends of the link in order to prevent packet and\n   routing information leakage.\
    \  An enterprise should also filter any\n   private networks from inbound routing\
    \ information in order to protect\n   itself from ambiguous routing situations\
    \ which can occur if routes to\n   the private address space point outside the\
    \ enterprise.\n   Groups of organisations which foresee a big need for mutual\n\
    \   communication can consider forming an enterprise by designing a\n   common\
    \ addressing plan supported by the necessary organisational\n   arrangements like\
    \ a registry.\n   If two sites of the same enterprise need to be connected using\
    \ an\n   external service provider, they can consider using an IP tunnel to\n\
    \   prevent packet leaks form the private network.\n   A possible approach to\
    \ avoid leaking of DNS RRs is to run two\n   nameservers, one external server\
    \ authoritative for all globally\n   unique IP addresses of the enterprise and\
    \ one internal nameserver\n   authoritative for all IP addresses of the enterprise,\
    \ both public and\n   private.  In order to ensure consistency both these servers\
    \ should be\n   configured from the same data of which the external nameserver\
    \ only\n   receives a filtered version.\n   The resolvers on all internal hosts,\
    \ both public and private, query\n   only the internal nameserver.  The external\
    \ server resolves queries\n   from resolvers outside the enterprise and is linked\
    \ into the global\n   DNS.  The internal server forwards all queries for information\n\
    \   outside the enterprise to the external nameserver, so all internal\n   hosts\
    \ can access the global DNS.  This ensures that information about\n   private\
    \ hosts does not reach resolvers and nameservers outside the\n   enterprise.\n"
