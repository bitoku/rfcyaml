- title: 2.1.  Background and Context
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Background and Context\n   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management\
    \ (SCIM) specification\n   is designed to manage user identity in cloud-based\
    \ applications and\n   services in a standardized way to enable interoperability,\
    \ security,\n   and scalability.  The specification suite seeks to build upon\n\
    \   experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific\n   emphasis\
    \ on simplicity of development and integration, while applying\n   existing authentication,\
    \ authorization, and privacy models.  The\n   intent of the SCIM specification\
    \ is to reduce the cost and complexity\n   of user management operations by providing\
    \ a common user schema and\n   extension model, as well as binding documents to\
    \ provide patterns for\n   exchanging this schema using standard protocols.  In\
    \ essence, make it\n   fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and\
    \ around the\n   cloud.\n   The SCIM scenarios are overviews of user stories designed\
    \ to help\n   clarify the intended scope of the SCIM effort.\n"

  - '2.2.  Model Concepts

    '
- title: 2.2.1.  Triggers
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Triggers\n   Quite simply, triggers are actions or activities that start\
    \ SCIM\n   flows.  Triggers may not be relevant at the protocol level or the\n\
    \   schema level; they really serve to help identify the type or activity\n  \
    \ that resulted in a SCIM protocol exchange.  Triggers make use of the\n   traditional\
    \ provisioning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\n   operations but add additional\
    \ use-case contexts like SSO (Single-Sign\n   On) as it is designed to capture\
    \ a class of use case that makes sense\n   to the actor requesting it rather than\
    \ to describe a protocol\n   operation.\n   o  Create SCIM Identity Resource -\
    \ Service On-boarding Trigger: A\n      \"create SCIM identity resource\" trigger\
    \ is a service on-boarding\n      activity in which a business action such as\
    \ a new hire or new\n      service subscription is initiated by one of the SCIM\
    \ Actors.  In\n      the protocol itself, service on-boarding may well be implemented\n\
    \      via the same resource PUT method as a service change.  This is\n      particular\
    \ to the implementation, and not to the use cases that\n      drive that implementation.\n\
    \   o  Update SCIM Identity Resource - Service Change Trigger: An \"update\n \
    \     SCIM identity resource\" trigger is a service change activity as a\n   \
    \   result of an identity moving or changing its service level.  An\n      \"\
    update SCIM identity\" trigger might be the result of a change in\n      a service\
    \ subscription level or a change to key identity data used\n      to denote a\
    \ service subscription level.  Password changes are\n      specifically called\
    \ out from other more general identity attribute\n      changes as they are considered\
    \ to have specific use-case\n      differences.\n   o  Delete SCIM Identity Resource\
    \ - Service Termination Trigger: A\n      \"delete SCIM identity resource\" trigger\
    \ represents a specific and\n      deliberate action to remove an identity from\
    \ a given SCIM service\n      point.  At this stage, it is unclear if the SCIM\
    \ protocol needs to\n      identify a separate protocol exchange for service suspension\n\
    \      actions.  This may be relevant as target services usually\n      differentiate\
    \ between these results and thus may require separate\n      resource representations.\n\
    \   o  Single Sign-On (SSO) Trigger - Service Access Request: A \"Single\n   \
    \   Sign-On\" trigger is a special class of activity in which a Create\n     \
    \ or Update trigger is initiated during an SSO operational flow.\n      The implication\
    \ here is that, as the result of a service access\n      request by the end user\
    \ (SSO), defined SCIM protocol exchanges can\n      be used to initiate SCIM resource\
    \ CRUD operations somewhere in the\n      service cloud.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Actors
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Actors\n   Actors are the operating parties that take part in both sides\
    \ of a\n   SCIM protocol exchange and help identify the source of a given\n  \
    \ Trigger.  So far, we have identified the following SCIM Actors:\n   o  Cloud\
    \ Service Provider (CSP): A CSP is the entity operating a\n      given cloud service.\
    \  In a SaaS scenario, this is simply the\n      application provider.  In an\
    \ IaaS or PaaS scenario, the CSP may be\n      the underlying IaaS/PaaS infrastructure\
    \ provider or the owner of\n      the application running on that platform.  In\
    \ all cases, the CSP\n      is the thing that holds the identity information being\
    \ operated\n      upon.  Put another way, the CSP really is the service that the\
    \ end\n      user interacts with.\n   o  Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS): An\
    \ ECS represents a middle tier\n      of aggregation for related identity records.\
    \  In one of our sample\n      enterprise SaaS scenarios, the ECS is \"Example.com\"\
    \ that\n      subscribes to a cloud-based CRM service \"SaaS-CRM Inc.\" (the CSP)\n\
    \      for all of its sales staff.  The actual Cloud Service Users (CSUs)\n  \
    \    are the FooBar Inc. sales staff.  The ECS Actor is identified to\n      help\
    \ capture use cases in which a single entity is given\n      administrative responsibility\
    \ for other identity accounts.  SCIM\n      may not address the configuration\
    \ and setup of an ECS within the\n      CSP, but it does address use cases in\
    \ which SCIM identity\n      resources are grouped together and administered as\
    \ part of some\n      broader agreement or operational exchange.\n   o  Cloud\
    \ Service User (CSU): A CSU represents the real cloud service\n      end user\
    \ -- i.e., the person logging into and using the cloud\n      service.  As described\
    \ above, and ECS will typically own or manage\n      multiple CSU identities,\
    \ whereas the CSU represents the FooBar\n      Inc. employee using the cloud service\
    \ to manage their CRM process.\n                           +---------------------+\n\

- title: 2.2.3.  Modes and Flows
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Modes and Flows\n   Modes identify the functional intent of a data flow\
    \ initiated in a\n   SCIM scenario.  The modes identified so far are 'Push' and\
    \ 'Pull'\n   referring to pushing data to and pulling data from an authoritative\n\
    \   identity data store.\n   In the SCIM scenarios, modes are often used in the\
    \ context of a flow\n   between two Actors.  For example, one might refer to a\
    \ Cloud-to-Cloud\n   Pull exchange.  Here one Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is\
    \ pulling\n   identity information from another CSP.  Commonly referenced flows\n\
    \   are:\n   o  Cloud Service Provider to Cloud Service Provider (CSP->CSP)\n\
    \   o  Enterprise Cloud Subscriber to Cloud Service Provider (ECS->CSP)\n   Modes\
    \ and flows simply help us understand what is taking place; they\n   are likely\
    \ to be technically meaningless at the protocol level, but\n   they help the reader\
    \ follow the SCIM scenarios and apply them to\n   real-world use cases.\n"

    \ or batch operation.\n   Individual SCIM actions should be able to be collected\
    \ together to\n   create single protocol exchanges.\n   The initial focus of SCIM\
    \ scenarios is on identifying base flows and\n   single operations.  The specific\
