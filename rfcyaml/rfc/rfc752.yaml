  - "                        A Universal Host Table\nABSTRACT:\n     The network host\
    \  table in use  at MIT and  Stanford is  described.\nThis host table is superior\
    \ to the NIC and Tenex host tables in  several\nways.  A binary file, compiled\
    \ from this host table, is also  described.\nThis file  is used  by  subsystems\
    \ on  MIT's  ITS and  Stanford's  WAITS\ntimesharing systems for efficiency in\
    \ host and network lookups.\nHISTORY:\n     As with many other  sites on the Arpanet,\
    \  we found the NIC's  host\ntable unsuited to our  needs.  Part of the  problem\
    \ was because the  NIC\nhost table was  often inaccurate  and all  too often \
    \ failed to  include\nseveral nicknames in common usage in our communities.  In\
    \ addition,  the\nthose which wanted  to have the  host table mapped  into memory\
    \ in  some\nsort of structured binary form for efficient lookups.  Finally, the\
    \  NIC\nhost table neglects to include some essential information.\n     The ITS\
    \ host  table was  originally designed to  be compiled  along\nwith a network\
    \ handling program (MIDAS, the PDP-10 assembler used, has a\npseudo-op to insert\
    \ a file into an assembly).  In order to make the host\ntable palatable  to  the\
    \ assembler,  every  comment line  began  with  a\nsemicolon,  and every actual\
    \ data line  began with the word HOST.   Each\nprogram which used  the host  table\
    \ defined  HOST as  an assembly  macro\nbefore inserting the host table into the\
    \ assembly.\n     This worked well for a long  while, but as the network grew,\
    \  hosts\nchanged their status more frequently and more network programs  required\n\
    reassembly when the host table  was updated.  If the appropriate  person\nfor\
    \ a particular subsystem  was not around, it  could be a while  before\nthat subsystem\
    \ updated its host table.\n     In the spring of 1977, design started on a binary\
    \ file which  would\nbe placed on a system directory and which all subsystems\
    \ which wanted to\naccess host table information would  read in.  The format was\
    \  carefully\ndesigned to be general  enough to satisfy the  needs of all the\
    \  diverse\nsubsystems.  All of  these subsystems required  modification to use\
    \  the\nnew format but these modifications turned out to be trivial compared \
    \ to\nthe benefits from not having to recompile every subsystem.\n     Later the\
    \ host  table and binary  file were imported  to the  WAITS\nMark Crispin    \

    system at Stanford, where it eventually replaced the former host  table.\nRecently,\
    \ support  for  multiple  networks  has  been  added,  including\nallowing hosts\
    \  to be  on more  than one  network, and  a more  flexible\ncompiler than assembler\
    \ macros was written (the program which  generates\nthe binary file now does the\
    \ compiling).\nTHE HOST TABLE:\n     In the descriptions below, angle  brackets\
    \ and lower case are  used\nas a meta-linguistic device.   It should be noted\
    \  that spaces and  tabs\nare often ignored  and may be  used freely in  the source\
    \ format,  while\ncommas are always  explicit delimiters.  In  addition, semicolon\
    \  always\nbegins a commentary and  everything after the semicolon  on the line\
    \  is\nignored; however, any text before the semicolon on the line is processed\n\
    as usual.  The syntax rules should  be obvious by examining the text  of\nthe\
    \ host  table  in  the  appendix.   Names  are  alphanumeric  strings,\nconsisting\
    \ of the set (A-Z, 0-9, and - (i.e., dash)).   Quoting is  used\nto separate examples\
    \ from the text and is not part of the example.\n     The host table consists\
    \ of commentary and two types of text  lines.\nThe commentary  lines begin  with\
    \ a  semicolon and  are ignored  by  the\ncompiler.  They are intended to  provide\
    \ information for a human  reader\nor editor of the host table.  The commentary\
    \ lines may be in mixed case,\nhowever the text lines are by  tradition entirely\
    \ in upper case.   There\nare two kinds of text lines:  host and network.\n  \
    \   Network text lines begin with the word \"NET\" followed by a space or\ntab.\
    \  These specify a network name  and the network number (as  assigned\nby Postel)\
    \  for that  network.   As there  currently are  no  officially\nassigned network\
    \ names, suitable names were assigned more or less  based\non the  English names\
    \ in Postel's  \"Assigned Numbers\",  RFC 750.   These\nnames may be changed in\
    \ the  future (however, some software has come  to\ndepend on the names  ARPA,\
    \ CHAOS, and DIAL  for the ARPANET,  Chaos net,\nand Dialnet).\n     The format\
    \ of a network text line is:\nNET <name>,<decimal-number>\n     For example, the\
    \ ARPANET's entry would look something like:\nNET ARPA,10\n     Host text lines\
    \ begin with the  word \"HOST\" followed by a space  or\ntab.  These specify a\
    \ host name, a host address list, whether this  host\nis a \"user\" or a \"server\"\
    , the name of the host's operating system,  the\nname of the host's  machine type,\
    \ and a  nick name list.  The  operating\nsystem, machine type,  and/or nick name\
    \  list may be  omitted, in  which\ncase they default to unknown or null.\nMark\
    \ Crispin                                                    [page 2]\nA Universal\
    \ Host Table\n     The host name is a unique  name string for that host.  For\
    \  ARPANET\nsites, it is the  official name for  that host as  assigned by the\
    \  NIC.\nFor other  networks,  it is  whatever  name is  in  common use  on  that\n\
    network.   So  far   there  haven't   been  any   naming  conflicts   on\nmultiple-network\
    \ hosts.\n     The host address list is either a single host address, or a list\
    \ of\nhost addresses  in square  brackets  and delimited  by commas.   A  host\n\
    address consists of a network name,  a space, and the host's address  on\nthat\
    \ network.  If the network name is not specified, it defaults to ARPA\n(i.e.,\
    \ \"ARPA 0/11\" and \"0/11\" are equivalent).  Different networks parse\nhost\
    \ addresses in different ways:\n          ARPANET addresses are in BBN-style host\
    \ number slash  IMP\n     number notation, with both numbers being decimal.  Hence\
    \  host\n     2 on IMP 6 is represented as \"2/6\".  Of course, this format is\n\
    \     backwards, but it has become  enough of a network standard  to\n     force\
    \ its use.   Old-style octal addresses  are allowed  (e.g.\n     \"206\" for \"\
    2/6\") but are no longer used or supported.\n          CHAOS net  addresses  are\
    \  a single  octal  number,  e.g.\n     \"CHAOS 2026\", and specify the host's\
    \ address on the CHAOS net.\n          Dialnet addresses  are a  ten-digit decimal\
    \  number,  and\n     specify the TelCo (phone) number of the host's Dialnet port.\n\
    \     The definition  of  user vs.  server  is generally  taken  to  mean\n\"\
    according to the NIC\" for ARPANET hosts.  A server is considered to  be\na host\
    \ for which making a connection to a remote service is a meaningful\noperation.\
    \  For some hosts with limited servers, the definition often is\nchanged  from\
    \   the  official   one,  depending   upon  the   individual\ncircumstances. \
    \  For  example,  \"users\"  who  have  an  FTP  server  and\noccasionally a TELNET\
    \ server may be called \"servers\".  On the other hand\na \"server\" which does\
    \ not accept MAIL and rejects MAIL in a pathological\nway (e.g. by hanging) might\
    \ be labelled a \"user\".\n     The name of  the host's operating  system is a\
    \  string much as  the\nhost name is, such as  \"ITS\", \"TOPS-20\", or \"MULTICS\"\
    .  Some  subsystems\nuse this information to predict  certain behavior of the\
    \ remote  server.\nFor example,  a MAIL  user  subsystem knows  that for  operating\
    \  system\n\"MULTICS\" it has to  log in as user  NETML before attempting to \
    \ deliver\nthe mail.\n     The name of the host's machine type  is a string as\
    \ well.  For  the\nconvenience of several subsystems, all DEC \"PDP-n\" machines\
    \ are  entered\nwithout the dash, and all PDP-10 like machines (e.g., KL-20, MAXC,\
    \ etc.)\nare considered to be PDP-10's, which by the way gets entered as  \"PDP10\"\
    \nsince that is a single 36-bit  word in 7-bit ASCII.  Like the  operating\nsystem\
    \ name,  several  subsystems use  this  information as  well.   For\nexample,\
    \ a PDP-10 FTP  user process will try  to negotiate 36-bit  image\nMark Crispin\

    \ Table\nmode with  another  PDP-10; or  a  Tenex or  Tops-20  site will  try\
    \  to\nnegotiate paged transfers with another Tenex or Tops-20.\n     The nick\
    \ name list is in  square brackets and consists of a  series\nof names delimited\
    \ by commas.  There may be any number of nick names.\n     The format of a host\
    \ text line is:\nHOST <name>,<address-list>,<status>,<system>,<machine>,<nickname-list>\n\
    \     For example, an entry might look something like:\nHOST MIT-AI,[ARPA 2/6,CHAOS\
    \ 2026],SERVER,ITS,PDP10,[AI,MITAI]\nthis entry describes a host named \"MIT-AI\"\
    \ on two networks (ARPANET  and\nCHAOS net), with ARPANET address \"2/6\" and\
    \ CHAOS net address \"2026\".  It\nis a server site, running an  operating system\
    \ called  \"ITS\" on  \"PDP10\"\nhardware.  It has two nicknames, \"AI\" and \"\
    MITAI\".\nTHE HOST TABLE BINARY FILE:\n     The host table binary file is  a 36-bit\
    \ data file; consequently  it\nprobably is only of  interest to PDP-10 sites.\

    \ capable of supporting the full host addressing of  the\nARPANET and additional\
    \ networks has been presented, along with a  binary\nfile format for efficient\
    \ manipulation of this host table data.\n     We are  documenting this  format\
    \  in order  to  present it  to  the\noutside world as  a suggested  replacement\
    \ for the  current host  table.\nThe advantage of our host table is that it has\
    \  already been implemented\nand is in use at MIT and Stanford.  We have established\
    \ some conventions\nMark Crispin                                             \
    \       [page 5]\nA Universal Host Table\nfor network names, as there are currently\
    \ no network names assigned.  So\nthis RFC is also a request for some discussion\
    \ about getting some  names\nassigned for the networks for the benefit of host\
    \ tables.\n     Anybody who is interested in importing our host table to their\
    \  own\nsystem should contact  David Moon  (MOON@MIT-MC) or  me (MRC@SU-AI)  for\n\
    more information.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\n     Many people have been involved in the\
    \ design and implementation  of\nthe current host table.  They include,  in no\
    \ particular order,  Richard\nStallman, David Moon, Ken Harrenstien, and Mark\
    \ Crispin.  I won't bother\nto list the contributions individually, since it's\
    \ hard to determine who\ndid what and that sort of stuff is boring to read anyway.\n\
