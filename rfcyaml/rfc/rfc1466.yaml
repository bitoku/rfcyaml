  - "1.0  Introduction\n   With the growth of the Internet and its increasing globalization,\n\
    \   much thought has been given to the evolution of the network number\n   allocation\
    \ and assignment process. RFC 1174, \"Identifier Assignment\n   and Connected\
    \ Status\", [1] dated August 1990 recommends that the\n   Internet Registry (IR)\
    \ continue as the principal registry for network\n   numbers; however, the IR\
    \ may allocate blocks of network numbers and\n   the assignment of those numbers\
    \ to qualified organizations.  The IR\n   will serve as the default registry in\
    \ cases where no delegated\n   registration authority has been identified.\n \
    \  The distribution of the registration function is desirable, and in\n   keeping\
    \ with that goal, it is necessary to develop a plan which\n   manages the distribution\
    \ of the network number space.  The demand for\n   network numbers has grown significantly\
    \ within the last two years and\n   as a result the allocation of network numbers\
    \ must be approached in a\n   more systematic fashion.\n   This document proposes\
    \ a plan which will forward the implementation\n   of RFC 1174 and which defines\
    \ the allocation and assignment of the\n   network number space.  There are three\
    \ major topics to be addressed:\n      1) Qualifications for Distributed Regional\
    \ Registries\n      2) Allocation of the Network Number Space by the Internet\
    \ Registry\n      3) Assignment of the Network Numbers\n"

  - "2.0  Qualifications for Distributed Regional Registries\n   The major reason\
    \ to distribute the registration function is that the\n   Internet serves a more\
    \ diverse global population than it did at its\n   inception.  This means that\
    \ registries which are located in distinct\n   geographic areas may be better\
    \ able to serve the local community in\n   terms of language and local customs.\
    \ While there appears to be wide\n   support for the concept of distribution of\
    \ the registration function,\n   it is important to define how the candidate delegated\
    \ registries will\n   be chosen and from which geographic areas.\n   Based on\
    \ the growth and the maturity of the Internet in Europe, North\n   America, Central/South\
    \ America and the Pacific Rim areas, it is\n   desirable to consider delegating\
    \ the registration function to an\n   organization in each of those geographic\
    \ areas.  Until an\n   organization is identified in those regions, the IR will\
    \ continue to\n   serve as the default registry.  The IR remains the root registry\
    \ and\n   continues to provide the registration function to all those regions\n\
    \   not covered by distributed regional registries.  And as other regions\n  \
    \ of the world become more and more active in the Internet, the\n   Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA) and the IR may choose to\n   look for candidate registries\
    \ to serve the populations in those\n   geographic regions.\n   It is important\
    \ that the regional registry is unbiased and and widely\n   recognized by network\
    \ providers and subscribers within the geographic\n   region.  It is also important\
    \ that there is just a single regional\n   registry per geographical region at\
    \ this level to provide for\n   efficient and fair sub-allocation of the address\
    \ space.  To be\n   selected as a distributed regional registry an organization\
    \ should\n   meet the following criteria:\n      a) networking authorities within\
    \ the geographic area\n         legitimize the organization,\n      b) the organization\
    \ is well-established and has\n         legitimacy outside of the registry function,\n\
    \      c) the organization will commit appropriate resources to\n         provide\
    \ stable, timely, and reliable service\n         to the geographic region,\n \
    \     d) is committed to allocate IP numbers according to\n         the guidelines\
    \ established by the IANA and the IR, and\n      e) is committed to coordinate\
    \ with the IR to establish\n         qualifications and strategies for sub-allocations\
    \ of\n         the regional allocation.\n   The distributed regional registry\
    \ is empowered by the IANA and the IR\n   to provide the network number registration\
    \ function to a geographic\n   area.  It is possible for network applicants to\
    \ contact the IR\n   directly.  Depending on the circumstances the network subscriber\
    \ may\n   be referred to the regional registry, but the IR will be prepared to\n\
    \   service any network subscriber if necessary.\n"

    \ [2]\n   Class A and B network numbers are a limited resource and therefore\n\
    \   allocations from this space will be restricted.  The entire Class A\n   number\
    \ space will be retained by the IANA and the IR.  No allocations\n   from the\
    \ Class A network numbers will be made to distributed regional\n   registries\
    \ at this time. (See section 4.1.)\n   Allocations from the Class B network number\
    \ space will be restricted\n   also.  Small blocks of numbers may be allocated\
    \ to regional\n   registries, which will be required to ensure that the allocation\n\
    \   guidelines are met. The IR will monitor those allocations. (See\n   section\
    \ 4.2.)\n   It is proposed that the IR, and any designated regional registries,\n\
    \   allocate addresses in conformance with this overall scheme. Where\n   there\
    \ are qualifying regional registries established, primary\n   responsibility for\
    \ allocation within that block will be delegated to\n   that registry. It should\
    \ be noted that the Reseaux IP Europeens\n   Network Coordination Center (RIPE\
    \ NCC) had been allocated a block of\n   Class C addresses (193.0.0 - 193.255.255)\
    \ prior to the adoption of\n   this proposal. The RIPE NCC has agreed to allocate\
    \ the addresses\n   within that block according to the guidelines stated in this\
    \ RFC.\n   The Class C network number space will be divided into allocatable\n\
    \   blocks which will be reserved by the IANA and IR for allocation to\n   distributed\
    \ regional registries.  In the absence of designated\n   regional registries in\
    \ geographic areas, the IR will assign addresses\n   to networks within those\
    \ geographic areas according to the Class C\n   allocation divisions.\n   Inspection\
    \ of the Class C IP network numbers shows that the number\n   space with prefixes\
    \ 192 and 193 are assigned.  The remaining space\n   from prefix 194 through 223\
    \ is mostly unassigned.\n   The IANA and the IR will reserve the upper half of\
    \ this space which\n   corresponds to the IP address range of 208.0.0.0 through\n\
    \   223.255.255.255. Network numbers from this portion of the Class C\n   space\
    \ will remain unallocated and unassigned until further notice.\n   The remaining\
    \ Class C network number space will be allocated in a\n   fashion which is compatible\
    \ with potential address aggregation\n   techniques. It is intended to divide\
    \ this address range into eight\n   equally sized address blocks.\n      192.0.0.0\
    \ - 193.255.255.255\n      194.0.0.0 - 195.255.255.255\n      196.0.0.0 - 197.255.255.255\n\

    \ Class C address space.\n   It is proposed that a broad geographic allocation\
    \ be used for these\n   blocks.  At present there are four major areas of address\
    \ allocation:\n   Europe, North America, Pacific Rim, and South & Central America.\n\
    \   In particular, the top level block allocation be designated as\n   follows:\n\

    \ will be\n   delegated to that registry.\n   The ranges designated as \"Others\"\
    \ permit flexibility in network\n   number assignments which are outside of the\
    \ geographical regions\n   already allocated.  The range listed as multi-regional\
    \ represents\n   network numbers which have been assigned prior to the implementation\n\
    \   of this plan.  It is proposed that the IANA and the IR will adopt\n   these\
    \ divisions of the Class C network number space and will begin\n   assigning network\
    \ numbers accordingly.\n"

  - "4.1  Class A\n   The Class A number space can support the largest number of unique\n\
    \   host identifier addresses and is also the class of network numbers\n   most\
    \ sparsely populated.  There are only approximately 11 Class A\n   network numbers\
    \ which are unassigned or unreserved, and these 11\n   network numbers represent\
    \ about 9% of the total address space.\n   The IANA and the IR will retain sole\

    \ half of the Class A\n   number space will be reserved indefinitely (IP network\
    \ addresses\n   64.0.0.0 through 127.0.0.0).  While it is expected that no new\n\
    \   assignments of Class A numbers will take place in the near future,\n   any\
    \ organization petitioning the IR for a Class A network number will\n   be expected\
    \ to provide a detailed technical justification documenting\n   network size and\

  contents:
  - "4.2  Class B\n   Previously, organizations were recommended to use a subnetted\
    \ Class B\n   network number rather than multiple Class C network numbers.  Due\
    \ to\n   the scarcity of Class B network numbers and the underutilization of\n\
    \   the Class B number space by most organizations, the recommendation is\n  \
    \ now to use multiple Class Cs where practical.\n   The restrictions in allocation\
    \ of Class B network numbers may cause\n   some organizations to expend additional\
    \ resources to utilize multiple\n   Class C numbers. This is unfortunate, but\
    \ inevitable if we implement\n   strategies to control the assignment of Class\

  - "4.3  Class C\n   Section 3 of this document recommends a division of the Class\
    \ C\n   number space.  That division is primarily an administrative division\n\
    \   which lays the groundwork for distributed network number registries.\n   This\
    \ section addresses assignment of network numbers from within\n   regional block\
    \ assignments. Sub-allocations of the block to sub-\n   registries is beyond the\
    \ scope of this paper.\n   By default, if an organization requires more than a\
    \ single Class C,\n   it will be assigned a bit-wise contiguous block from the\
    \ Class C\n   space allocated for its geographic region.\n   For instance, an\
    \ European organization which requires fewer than 2048\n   unique IP addresses\
    \ and more than 1024 would be assigned 8 contiguous\n   class C network numbers\
    \ from the number space reserved for European\n   networks, 194.0.0.0 - 195.255.255.255.\
    \  If an organization from\n   Central America required fewer than 512 unique\
    \ IP addresses and more\n   than 256, it would receive 2 contiguous class C network\
    \ numbers from\n   the number space reserved for Central/South American networks,\n\
    \   200.0.0.0 - 201.255.255.255.\n   The IR or the registry to whom the IR has\
    \ delegated the registration\n   function will determine the number of Class C\
    \ network numbers to\n   assign to a network subscriber based on the subscriber's\
    \ 24 month\n   projection of required end system addresses according to the\n\
    \   following criteria:\n           Organization                            Assignment\n\
    \   1) requires fewer than 256 addresses    1 class C network\n   2) requires\
    \ fewer than 512 addresses    2 contiguous class C networks\n   3) requires fewer\
    \ than 1024 addresses   4 contiguous class C networks\n   4) requires fewer than\
    \ 2048 addresses   8 contiguous class C networks\n   5) requires fewer than 4096\
    \ addresses  16 contiguous class C networks\n   6) requires fewer than 8192 addresses\
    \  32 contiguous class C networks\n   7) requires fewer than 16384 addresses 64\
    \ contiguous class C networks\n   If the subscriber's network is divided into\
    \ logically distinct LANs\n   across which it would be difficult to use the given\
    \ number of Class C\n   network numbers, the above criteria may apply on a per-LAN\
    \ basis.\n   For example, if a subscriber has 600 hosts equally divided across\
    \ ten\n   Ethernets, the allocation to that subscriber could be ten Class C\n\
    \   network numbers; one for each Ethernet. The subscriber would have to\n   support\
    \ the request with to deviate from the stated criteria with an\n   engineering\
    \ plan.\n   These criteria are not intended to cause a subscriber to subnet Class\n\
    \   C networks unneccessarily.  Although, if a subscriber has a small\n   number\
    \ of hosts per subnet, the subscriber should investigate the\n   feasibility of\
    \ subnetting Class C network numbers rather than\n   requesting one Class C network\
    \ number for every subnet.  In cases\n   where the lack of Class C subnetting\
    \ would result in an extravagant\n   waste of address space, the registries may\
    \ request an engineering\n   plan detailing why subnetting is impossible.\n  \
    \ If a subscriber has a requirement for more than 4096 unique IP\n   addresses\
    \ it could conceivably receive a Class B network number.\n   However, there are\
    \ cases where a subscriber may request a larger\n   block of Class C network numbers.\
    \ For instance, if an organization\n   requires fewer than 8192 addresses and\
    \ requests 32 Class C network\n   addresses, the regional registry may honor this\
    \ request.  The maximal\n   block of Class C network numbers that should be assigned\
    \ to a\n   subscriber consists of 64 contiguous Class C networks. This would\n\
    \   correspond to a single IP prefix of 18 bits.\n   Exceptions from the above\
    \ stated criteria will be determined on a\n   case-by-case basis.\n"
