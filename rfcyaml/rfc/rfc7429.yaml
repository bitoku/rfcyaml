  - "1.  Introduction\n   Existing network-layer mobility management protocols have\
    \ primarily\n   employed a mobility anchor to ensure connectivity of a mobile\
    \ node by\n   forwarding packets destined to, or sent from, the mobile node after\n\
    \   the node has moved to a different network.  The mobility anchor has\n   been\
    \ centrally deployed in the sense that the traffic of millions of\n   mobile nodes\
    \ in an operator network is typically managed by the same\n   anchor.  This centralized\
    \ deployment of mobility anchors to manage IP\n   sessions poses several problems.\
    \  In order to address these problems,\n   a distributed mobility management (DMM)\
    \ architecture has been\n   proposed.  This document investigates whether it is\
    \ feasible to\n   deploy current IP mobility protocols in a DMM scenario in a\
    \ way that\n   can fulfill the requirements as defined in [RFC7333], discusses\n\
    \   current deployment practices of existing mobility protocols, and\n   identifies\
    \ the limitations (gaps) in these practices from the\n   standpoint of satisfying\
    \ DMM requirements.  The analysis is primarily\n   towards IPv6 deployment but\
    \ can be seen to also apply to IPv4\n   whenever there are IPv4 counterparts equivalent\
    \ to the IPv6 mobility\n   protocols.\n   The rest of this document is organized\
    \ as follows: Section 3 analyzes\n   existing IP mobility protocols by examining\
    \ their functions and how\n   these functions can be configured and used to work\
    \ in a DMM\n   environment, Section 4 presents the current practices of IP wireless\n\
    \   networks and 3GPP architectures (both network- and host-based\n   mobility\
    \ protocols are considered), and Section 5 presents the gap\n   analysis with\
    \ respect to the current practices.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used\
    \ in this\n   document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base\n\
    \   specification [RFC6275], in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification\n   [RFC5213],\
    \ and in the Distributed Mobility Management Requirements\n   [RFC7333].  These\
    \ terms include mobile node (MN), correspondent node\n   (CN), home agent (HA),\
    \ local mobility anchor (LMA), mobile access\n   gateway (MAG), centrally deployed\
    \ mobility anchors, distributed\n   mobility management, hierarchical mobile network,\
    \ flatter mobile\n   network, and flattening mobile network.\n   In addition,\
    \ this document also introduces some definitions of IP\n   mobility functions\
    \ in Section 3.\n   In this document there are also references to a \"distributed\
    \ mobility\n   management environment.\"  By this term, we refer to a scenario\
    \ in\n   which the IP mobility, access network, and routing solutions allow\n\
    \   for setting up IP networks so that traffic is distributed in an\n   optimal\
    \ way without relying on centrally deployed mobility anchors to\n   manage IP\
    \ mobility sessions.\n"
- title: 3.  Functions of Existing Mobility Protocols
  contents:
  - "3.  Functions of Existing Mobility Protocols\n   The host-based Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)\
    \ [RFC6275] and its network-based\n   extension, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213],\
    \ as well as\n   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380], are logically\n\
    \   centralized mobility management approaches addressing primarily\n   hierarchical\
    \ mobile networks.  Although these approaches are\n   centralized, they have important\
    \ mobility management functions\n   resulting from years of extensive work to\
    \ develop and to extend these\n   functions.  It is therefore useful to take these\
    \ existing functions\n   and examine them in a DMM scenario in order to understand\
    \ how to\n   deploy the existing mobility protocols to provide distributed\n \
    \  mobility management.\n   The main mobility management functions of MIPv6, PMIPv6,\
    \ and HMIPv6\n   are the following:\n   1.  Anchoring Function (AF): allocation\
    \ to a mobile node of an IP\n       address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix,\
    \ i.e., Home Network\n       Prefix (HNP), topologically anchored by the advertising\
    \ node.\n       That is, the anchor node is able to advertise a connected route\n\
    \       into the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP prefixes.\n     \
    \  This function is a control-plane function.\n   2.  Internetwork Location Management\
    \ (LM) function: managing and\n       keeping track of the internetwork location\
    \ of an MN.  The\n       location information may be a binding of the advertised\
    \ IP\n       address/prefix, e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of\n\
    \       the MN, or it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets\n  \
    \     destined to the MN.  It is a control-plane function.\n       In a client-server\
    \ protocol model, location query and update\n       messages may be exchanged\
    \ between a Location Management client\n       (LMc) and a Location Management\
    \ server (LMs).\n   3.  Forwarding Management (FM) function: packet interception\
    \ and\n       forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN,\n \
    \      based on the internetwork location information, either to the\n       destination\
    \ or to some other network element that knows how to\n       forward the packets\
    \ to their destination.\n       FM may optionally be split into the control plane\
    \ (FM-CP) and\n       data plane (FM-DP).\n   In Mobile IPv6, the home agent (HA)\
    \ typically provides the AF; the\n   LMs is at the HA, whereas the LMc is at the\
    \ MN; the FM function is\n   distributed between the ends of the tunnel at the\
    \ HA and the MN.\n   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, the local mobility anchor (LMA) provides\
    \ the\n   AF; the LMs is at the LMA, whereas the LMc is at the MAG; the FM\n \
    \  function is distributed between the ends of the tunnel at the LMA and\n   the\
    \ MAG.\n   In HMIPv6 [RFC5380], the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) serves as a\n\
    \   location information aggregator between the LMs at the HA and the LMc\n  \
    \ at the MN.  The MAP also provides the FM function to enable tunneling\n   between\
    \ HA and itself, as well as tunneling between the MN and\n   itself.\n"

  - "4.  DMM Practices\n   This section documents deployment practices of existing\
    \ mobility\n   protocols to satisfy distributed mobility management requirements.\n\
    \   This description considers both IP wireless, e.g., evolved Wi-Fi\n   hotspots,\
    \ and 3GPP flattening mobile networks.\n   While describing the current DMM practices,\
    \ the section provides\n   references to the generic mobility management functions\
    \ described in\n   Section 3 as well as some initial hints on the identified gaps\
    \ with\n   respect to the DMM requirements documented in [RFC7333].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Assumptions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Assumptions\n   There are many different approaches that can be considered\
    \ to\n   implement and deploy a distributed anchoring and mobility solution.\n\
    \   The focus of the gap analysis is on certain current mobile network\n   architectures\
    \ and standardized IP mobility solutions, considering any\n   kind of deployment\
    \ options that do not violate the original protocol\n   specifications.  In order\
    \ to limit the scope of our analysis of DMM\n   practices, we consider the following\
    \ list of technical assumptions:\n   1.  Both host- and network-based solutions\
    \ are considered.\n   2.  Solutions should allow selecting and using the most\
    \ appropriate\n       IP anchor among a set of available candidates.\n   3.  Mobility\
    \ management should be realized by the preservation of the\n       IP address\
    \ across the different points of attachment (i.e.,\n       provision of IP address\
    \ continuity).  This is in contrast to\n       certain transport-layer-based approaches\
    \ such as Stream Control\n       Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] or application-layer\n\
    \       mobility.\n   Applications that can cope with changes in the MN's IP address\
    \ do not\n   depend on IP mobility management protocols such as DMM.  Typically,\
    \ a\n   connection manager, together with the operating system, will\n   configure\
    \ the source address selection mechanism of the IP stack.\n   This might involve\
    \ identifying application capabilities and\n   triggering the mobility support\
    \ accordingly.  Further considerations\n   on application management and source\
    \ address selection are out of the\n   scope of this document, but the reader\
    \ might consult [RFC6724].\n"

    \ forwarding function for the user\n   traffic.  The WLC could also implement\
    \ Layer 3 routing functions or\n   attach to an access router (AR).  Last, on\
    \ the right-hand side of the\n   figure, access points AP3 and AP4 are directly\
    \ connected to an access\n   router.  This can also be used as a generic connectivity\
    \ model.\n   IP mobility protocols can be used to provide heterogeneous network\n\
    \   mobility support to users, e.g., handover from Wi-Fi to cellular\n   access.\
    \  Two kinds of protocols can be used: Proxy Mobile IPv6\n   [RFC5213] or Mobile\
    \ IPv6 [RFC5555], with the role of mobility anchor\n   (e.g., local mobility anchor\
    \ or home agent) typically being played by\n   the edge router of the mobile network\
    \ [SDO-3GPP.23.402].\n   Although this section has made use of the example of\
    \ Wi-Fi networks,\n   there are other flattening mobile network architectures\
    \ specified,\n   such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)\n\
    \   [IEEE.802-16.2009], which integrates both host- and network-based IP\n   mobility\
    \ functions.\n   Existing IP mobility protocols can also be deployed in a flatter\n\
    \   manner so that the anchoring and access aggregation functions are\n   distributed.\
    \  We next describe several practices for the deployment\n   of existing mobility\
    \ protocols in a distributed mobility management\n   environment.  The analysis\
    \ in this section is limited to protocol\n   solutions based on existing IP mobility\
    \ protocols, either host- or\n   network-based, such as Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275]\
    \ [RFC5555], Proxy Mobile\n   IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] [RFC5844], and Network Mobility\
    \ (NEMO) Basic\n   Support Protocol [RFC3963].  Extensions to these base protocol\n\
    \   solutions are also considered.  The analysis is divided into two\n   parts:\
    \ host- and network-based practices.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Host-Based IP DMM Practices
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Host-Based IP DMM Practices\n   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275] and its\
    \ extension to support mobile\n   networks, the NEMO Basic Support protocol (hereafter,\
    \ simply referred\n   to as NEMO) [RFC3963], are well-known, host-based IP mobility\n\
    \   protocols.  They depend on the function of the home agent (HA), a\n   centralized\
    \ anchor, to provide mobile nodes (hosts and routers) with\n   mobility support.\
    \  In these approaches, the home agent typically\n   provides the AF, FM function,\
    \ and Location Management server (LMs)\n   functions.  The mobile node possesses\
    \ the Location Management client\n   (LMc) function and the FM function to enable\
    \ tunneling between the HA\n   and itself.  We next describe some practices that\
    \ show how MIPv6/NEMO\n   and several other protocol extensions can be deployed\
    \ in a\n   distributed mobility management environment.\n   One approach to distribute\
    \ the anchors can be to deploy several HAs\n   (as shown in Figure 2), and assign\
    \ the topologically closest anchor\n   to each MN [RFC4640] [RFC5026] [RFC6611].\
    \  In the example shown in\n   Figure 2, the mobile node MN1 is assigned to the\
    \ home agent HA1 and\n   uses a home address anchored by HA1 to communicate with\
    \ the\n   correspondent node CN1.  Similarly, the mobile node MN2 is assigned\n\
    \   to the home agent HA2 and uses a home address anchored by HA2 to\n   communicate\
    \ with the correspondent node CN2.  Note that MIPv6/NEMO\n   specifications do\
    \ not prevent the simultaneous use of multiple home\n   agents by a single mobile\
    \ node.  In this deployment model, the mobile\n   node can use several anchors\
    \ at the same time, each of them anchoring\n   IP flows initiated at a different\
    \ point of attachment.  However,\n   there is currently no mechanism specified\
    \ in IETF standard to enable\n   an efficient dynamic discovery of available anchors\
    \ and the selection\n   of the most suitable one.\n    <-INTERNET-> <- HOME NETWORK\

    \ Operation of Mobile IPv6 (BT and RO)/NEMO\n   One goal of the deployment of\
    \ mobility protocols in a distributed\n   mobility management environment is to\
    \ avoid the suboptimal routing\n   caused by centralized anchoring.  Here, the\
    \ Route Optimization (RO)\n   support provided by Mobile IPv6 can be used to achieve\
    \ a flatter IP\n   data forwarding.  By default, Mobile IPv6 and NEMO use the\
    \ so-called\n   Bidirectional Tunnel (BT) mode, in which data traffic is always\n\
    \   encapsulated between the MN and its HA before being directed to any\n   other\
    \ destination.  The RO mode allows the MN to update its current\n   location on\
    \ the CNs and then use the direct path between them.  Using\n   the example shown\
    \ in Figure 2, MN1 and MN2 are using BT mode with CN1\n   and CN2, respectively,\
    \ while MN2 is in RO mode with CN3.  However,\n   the RO mode has several drawbacks:\n\
    \   o  The RO mode is only supported by Mobile IPv6.  There is no route\n    \
    \  optimization support standardized for the NEMO protocol because of\n      the\
    \ security problems posed by extending return routability tests\n      for prefixes,\
    \ although many different solutions have been proposed\n      [RFC4889].\n   o\
    \  The RO mode requires signaling that adds some protocol overhead.\n   o  The\
    \ signaling required to enable RO involves the home agent and is\n      repeated\
    \ periodically for security reasons [RFC4225].  Therefore,\n      the HA remains\
    \ a single point of failure.\n   o  The RO mode requires support from the CN.\n\
    \   Notwithstanding these considerations, the RO mode does offer the\n   possibility\
    \ of substantially reducing traffic through the home agent,\n   in cases when\
    \ it can be supported by the relevant correspondent\n   nodes.  Note that a mobile\
    \ node can also use its Care-of Address\n   (CoA) directly [RFC5014] when communicating\
    \ with CNs on the same link\n   or anywhere in the Internet, although no session\
    \ continuity support\n   would be provided by the IP stack in this case.\n   HMIPv6\
    \ [RFC5380], as shown in Figure 3, is another host-based IP\n   mobility extension\
    \ that can be considered as a complement to provide\n   a less centralized mobility\
    \ deployment.  It allows the reduction of\n   the amount of mobility signaling\
    \ as well as improving the overall\n   handover performance of Mobile IPv6 by\
    \ introducing a new hierarchy\n   level to handle local mobility.  The Mobility\
    \ Anchor Point (MAP)\n   entity is introduced as a local mobility handling node\
    \ deployed\n   closer to the mobile node.  It provides LM intermediary function\n\
    \   between the LMs at the HA and the LMc at the MN.  It also performs\n   the\
    \ FM function to tunnel with the HA and also with the MN.\n    <INTERNET> <- HOME\

    \ 3: Hierarchical Mobile IPv6\n   When HMIPv6 is used, the MN has two different\
    \ temporary addresses:\n   the Regional Care-of Address (RCoA) and the Local Care-of\
    \ Address\n   (LCoA).  The RCoA is anchored at one MAP, which plays the role of\n\
    \   local home agent, while the LCoA is anchored at the access-router\n   level.\
    \  The mobile node uses the RCoA as the CoA that is signaled to\n   its home agent.\
    \  Therefore, while roaming within a local domain\n   handled by the same MAP,\
    \ the mobile node does not need to update its\n   home agent, i.e., the mobile\
    \ node does not change its RCoA.\n   The use of HMIPv6 enables a form of route\
    \ optimization, since a\n   mobile node may decide to directly use the RCoA as\
    \ the source address\n   for a communication with a given correspondent node,\
    \ particularly if\n   the MN does not expect to move outside the local domain\
    \ during the\n   lifetime of the communication.  This can be seen as a potential\
    \ DMM\n   mode of operation, though it fails to provide session continuity if\n\
    \   and when the MN moves outside the local domain.  In the example shown\n  \
    \ in Figure 3, MN1 is using its global HoA to communicate with CN1,\n   while\
    \ it is using its RCoA to communicate with CN2.\n   Furthermore, a local domain\
    \ might have several MAPs deployed, thus\n   enabling different kinds of HMIPv6\
    \ deployments that are flattening\n   and distributed.  The HMIPv6 specification\
    \ supports a flexible\n   selection of the MAP, including selections based on\
    \ the expected\n   mobility pattern of the MN or on the distance between the MN\
    \ and the\n   MAP.\n   Another extension that can be used to help with distributing\
    \ mobility\n   management functions is the Home Agent switch specification\n \
    \  [RFC5142], which defines a new mobility header to signal to a mobile\n   node\
    \ that it should acquire a new home agent.  [RFC5142] does not\n   specify the\
    \ case of changing the mobile node's home address, as that\n   might imply loss\
    \ of connectivity for ongoing persistent connections.\n   Nevertheless, that specification\
    \ could be used to force the change of\n   home agent in those situations where\
    \ there are no active persistent\n   data sessions that cannot cope with a change\
    \ of home address.\n   There are other host-based approaches standardized that\
    \ can be used\n   to provide mobility support.  For example, IKEv2 Mobility and\n\
    \   Multihoming (MOBIKE) [RFC4555] allows a mobile node encrypting\n   traffic\
    \ through Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)\n   [RFC7296] to change\
    \ its point of attachment while maintaining a\n   Virtual Private Network (VPN)\
    \ session.  The MOBIKE protocol allows\n   updating the VPN Security Associations\
    \ (SAs) in cases where the base\n   connection initially used is lost and needs\
    \ to be re-established.\n   The use of the MOBIKE protocol avoids having to perform\
    \ an IKEv2\n   renegotiation.  Similar considerations to those made for Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   can be applied to MOBIKE; though MOBIKE is best suited for situations\n\
    \   where the address of at least one endpoint is relatively stable and\n   can\
    \ be discovered using existing mechanisms such as DNS.\n   Extensions have been\
    \ defined to the mobility protocol to optimize the\n   handover performance. \
    \ Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) [RFC5568]\n   is the extension to optimize\
    \ handover latency.  It defines new access\n   router discovery mechanism before\
    \ handover to reduce the new network\n   discovery latency.  It also defines a\
    \ tunnel between the previous\n   access router and the new access router to reduce\
    \ the packet loss\n   during handover.  The Candidate Access Router Discovery\
    \ (CARD)\n   [RFC4066] and Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [RFC4067] protocols\n\
    \   were standardized to improve the handover performance.  The DMM\n   deployment\
    \ practice discussed in this section can also use those\n   extensions to improve\
    \ the handover performance.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Network-Based IP DMM Practices
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Network-Based IP DMM Practices\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213]\
    \ is the main network-based IP\n   mobility protocol specified for IPv6.  Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv4 [RFC5844]\n   defines some IPv4 extensions.  With network-based\
    \ IP mobility\n   protocols, the LMA typically provides the AF, FM function, and\n\
    \   Location Management server (LMs) function.  The mobile access gateway\n  \
    \ (MAG) provides the Location Management client (LMc) function and FM\n   function\
    \ to tunnel with LMA.  PMIPv6 is architecturally almost\n   identical to MIPv6,\
    \ as the mobility signaling and routing between LMA\n   and MAG in PMIPv6 is similar\
    \ to those between the HA and MN in MIPv6.\n   The required mobility functionality\
    \ at the MN is provided by the MAG\n   so that the involvement in mobility support\
    \ by the MN is not\n   required.\n   We next describe some practices that show\
    \ how network-based mobility\n   protocols and several other protocol extensions\
    \ can be deployed in a\n   distributed mobility management environment.\n   One\
    \ way to decentralize Proxy Mobile IPv6 operation can be to deploy\n   several\
    \ LMAs and use some selection criteria to assign LMAs to\n   attaching mobile\
    \ nodes.  An example of this type of assignment is\n   shown in Figure 4.  As\
    \ with the client-based approach, a mobile node\n   may use several anchors at\
    \ the same time, each of them anchoring IP\n   flows initiated at a different\
    \ point of attachment.  This assignment\n   can be static or dynamic.  The main\
    \ advantage of this simple approach\n   is that the IP address anchor, i.e., the\
    \ LMA, could be placed closer\n   to the mobile node.  Therefore, the resulting\
    \ paths are close to\n   optimal.  On the other hand, as soon as the mobile node\
    \ moves, the\n   resulting path will start deviating from the optimal one.\n \

    \   Figure 4: Distributed Operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6\n   In a similar way\
    \ to the host-based IP mobility case, network-based IP\n   mobility has some extensions\
    \ defined to mitigate the suboptimal\n   routing issues that may arise due to\
    \ the use of a centralized anchor.\n   The Local Routing extensions [RFC6705]\
    \ enable optimal routing in\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 in three cases: i) when two\
    \ communicating MNs are\n   attached to the same MAG and LMA, ii) when two communicating\
    \ MNs are\n   attached to different MAGs but to the same LMA, and iii) when two\n\
    \   communicating MNs are attached to the same MAG but have different\n   LMAs.\
    \  In these three cases, data traffic between the two mobile\n   nodes does not\
    \ traverse the LMA(s), thus providing some form of path\n   optimization, since\
    \ the traffic is locally routed at the edge.  The\n   main disadvantage of this\
    \ approach is that it only tackles the MN-to-\n   MN communication scenario and\
    \ only under certain circumstances.\n   An interesting extension that can also\
    \ be used to facilitate the\n   deployment of network-based mobility protocols\
    \ in a distributed\n   mobility management environment is the support of an LMA\
    \ runtime\n   assignment described in [RFC6463].  This extension specifies a\n\
    \   runtime LMA assignment functionality and corresponding mobility\n   options\
    \ for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This runtime LMA assignment takes\n   place during the\
    \ Proxy Binding Update / Proxy Binding Acknowledgment\n   message exchange between\
    \ a mobile access gateway and an LMA.  While\n   this mechanism is mainly aimed\
    \ for load-balancing purposes, it can\n   also be used to select an optimal LMA\
    \ from the routing point of view.\n   A runtime LMA assignment can be used to\
    \ change the assigned LMA of an\n   MN, for example, in cases when the mobile\
    \ node does not have any\n   active session or when the running sessions can survive\
    \ an IP address\n   change.  Note that several possible dynamic LMA discovery\
    \ solutions\n   can be used, as described in [RFC6097].\n"

- title: 5.1.  Distributed Mobility Management - REQ1
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Distributed Mobility Management - REQ1\n   According to requirement REQ1\
    \ stated in [RFC7333], IP mobility,\n   network access, and forwarding solutions\
    \ provided by DMM must make it\n   possible for traffic to avoid traversing a\
    \ single mobility anchor far\n   from the optimal route.\n   From the analysis\
    \ performed in Section 4, a DMM deployment can meet\n   the requirement \"REQ1\
    \ Distributed mobility management\" usually\n   relying on the following functions:\n\
    \   o  Multiple (distributed) anchoring: ability to anchor different\n      sessions\
    \ of a single mobile node at different anchors.  In order\n      to provide improved\
    \ routing, some anchors might need to be placed\n      closer to the mobile node\
    \ or the corresponding node.\n   o  Dynamic anchor assignment/re-location: ability\
    \ to i) assign the\n      initial anchor, and ii) dynamically change the initially\
    \ assigned\n      anchor and/or assign a new one (this may also require the transfer\n\
    \      of mobility context between anchors).  This can be achieved either\n  \
    \    by changing anchor for all ongoing sessions or by assigning new\n      anchors\
    \ just for new sessions.\n   GAP1-1:  Both the main client- and network-based\
    \ IP mobility\n            protocols (namely, MIPv6, DSMIPv6, and PMIPv6) allow\n\
    \            deploying multiple anchors (i.e., home agents and localized\n   \
    \         mobility anchors), thereby providing the multiple anchoring\n      \
    \      function.  However, existing solutions only provide an\n            initial\
    \ anchor assignment, thus the lack of dynamic anchor\n            change/new anchor\
    \ assignment is a gap.  Neither the HA\n            switch nor the LMA runtime\
    \ assignment allows changing the\n            anchor during an ongoing session.\
    \  This actually comprises\n            several gaps: ability to perform anchor\
    \ assignment at any\n            time (not only at the initial MN's attachment),\
    \ ability of\n            the current anchor to initiate/trigger the relocation,\
    \ and\n            ability to transfer registration context between anchors.\n\
    \   GAP1-2:  Dynamic anchor assignment may lead the MN to manage\n           \
    \ different mobility sessions served by different mobility\n            anchors.\
    \  This is not an issue with client-based mobility\n            management, where\
    \ the mobility client natively knows the\n            anchor associated with each\
    \ of its mobility sessions.\n            However, there is one gap, as the MN\
    \ should be capable of\n            handling IP addresses in a DMM-friendly way,\
    \ meaning that\n            the MN can perform smart source address selection\
    \ (i.e.,\n            deprecating IP addresses from previous mobility anchors\
    \ so\n            they are not used for new sessions).  Besides, managing\n  \
    \          different mobility sessions served by different mobility\n        \
    \    anchors may raise issues with network-based mobility\n            management.\
    \  In this case, the mobile client located in the\n            network, e.g.,\
    \ MAG, usually retrieves the MN's anchor from\n            the MN's policy profile,\
    \ as described in Section 6.2 of\n            [RFC5213].  Currently, the MN's\
    \ policy profile implicitly\n            assumes a single serving anchor and thus\
    \ does not maintain\n            the association between home network prefix and\
    \ anchor.\n   GAP1-3:  The consequence of the distribution of the mobility anchors\n\
    \            is that there might be more than one available anchor for a\n   \
    \         mobile node to use, which leads to an anchor discovery and\n       \
    \     selection issue.  Currently, there is no efficient mechanism\n         \
    \   specified to allow the dynamic discovery of the presence of\n            nodes\
    \ that can play the anchor role, the discovery of their\n            capabilities,\
    \ and the selection of the most suitable one.\n            There is also no mechanism\
    \ to allow selecting a node that is\n            currently anchoring a given home\
    \ address/prefix (capability\n            sometimes required to meet REQ#2). \
    \ However, there are some\n            mechanisms that could help to discover\
    \ anchors, such as the\n            Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD)\
    \ [RFC6275], the\n            use of the home agent flag (H) in Router Advertisements\n\
    \            (which indicates that the router sending the Router\n           \
    \ Advertisement is also functioning as a Mobile IPv6 home\n            agent on\
    \ the link) or the MAP option in Router\n            Advertisements defined by\
    \ HMIPv6.  Note that there are 3GPP\n            mechanisms providing that functionality\
    \ defined in\n            [SDO-3GPP.29.303].\n   Regarding the ability to transfer\
    \ registration context between\n   anchors, there are already some solutions that\
    \ could be reused or\n   adapted to fill that gap, such as Fast Handovers for\
    \ Mobile IPv6\n   [RFC5568] to enable traffic redirection from the old to the\
    \ new\n   anchor, the Context Transfer Protocol [RFC4067] to enable the\n   required\
    \ transfer of registration information between anchors, or the\n   Handover Keying\
    \ architecture solutions [RFC6697] to speed up the re-\n   authentication process\
    \ after a change of anchor.  Note that some\n   extensions might be needed in\
    \ the context of DMM, as these protocols\n   were designed in the context of centralized\
    \ client IP mobility\n   (focusing on the access reattachment and authentication).\n\
    \   GAP1-4:  Also note that REQ1 is intended to prevent the data-plane\n     \
    \       traffic from taking a suboptimal route.  Distributed\n            processing\
    \ of the traffic may then be needed only in the\n            data plane.  Provision\
    \ of this capability for distributed\n            processing should not conflict\
    \ with the use of a centralized\n            control plane.  Other control-plane\
    \ solutions (such as\n            charging, lawful interception, etc.) should\
    \ not be\n            constrained by the DMM solution.  On the other hand,\n \
    \           combining the control-plane and data-plane FM function may\n     \
    \       limit the choice of solutions to those that distribute both\n        \
    \    data plane and control plane together.  In order to enable\n            distribution\
    \ of only the data plane without distributing the\n            control plane,\
    \ it would be necessary to split the forwarding\n            management function\
    \ into the control-plane (FM-CP) and data-\n            plane (FM-DP) components;\
    \ there is currently a gap here.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  Bypassable Network-Layer Mobility Support for Each Application\n      Session\
    \ - REQ2\n   The requirement REQ2 for \"bypassable network-layer mobility support\n\
    \   for each application session\" introduced in [RFC7333] requires\n   flexibility\
    \ in determining whether network-layer mobility support is\n   needed.  This requirement\
    \ enables one to choose whether or not to use\n   network-layer mobility support.\
    \  The following two functions are also\n   needed:\n   o  Dynamically assign/relocate\
    \ anchor: A mobility anchor is assigned\n      only to sessions that use the network-layer\
    \ mobility support.  The\n      MN may thus manage more than one session; some\
    \ of them may be\n      associated with anchored IP address(es), while the others\
    \ may be\n      associated with local IP address(es).\n   o  Multiple IP address\
    \ management: This function is related to the\n      preceding item and is about\
    \ the ability of the mobile node to\n      simultaneously use multiple IP addresses\
    \ and select the best one\n      (from an anchoring point of view) to use on a\
    \ per-\n      session/application/service basis.  This requires MN to acquire\n\
    \      information regarding the properties of the available IP\n      addresses.\n\
    \   GAP2-1:  The dynamic anchor assignment/relocation needs to ensure\n      \
    \      that IP address continuity is guaranteed for sessions that\n          \
    \  use such mobility support (e.g., in some scenarios, the\n            provision\
    \ of mobility locally within a limited area might be\n            enough from\
    \ the point of view of the mobile node or the\n            application) at the\
    \ relocated anchor.  Implicitly, DMM may\n            release the needed resources\
    \ when no applications are using\n            the network-layer mobility support.\
    \  DMM is then potentially\n            required to know which sessions at the\
    \ mobile node are\n            active and are using the mobility support.  Typically,\
    \ this\n            is known only by the MN (e.g., by its connection manager)\n\
    \            and would require some signaling support, such as socket API\n  \
    \          extensions, from applications to indicate to the IP stack\n       \
    \     whether or not mobility support is required.  This may imply\n         \
    \   having the knowledge of which sessions at the mobile node\n            are\
    \ active and are using the mobility support.  This is\n            something typically\
    \ known only by the MN, e.g., by its\n            connection manager, and would\
    \ also typically require some\n            signaling support, such as socket API\
    \ extensions, from\n            applications to indicate to the IP stack whether\
    \ mobility\n            support is required or not.  Therefore, (part of) this\n\
    \            knowledge might need to be transferred to/shared with the\n     \
    \       network.\n   GAP2-2:  Management of multiple IP addresses provides the\
    \ MN with the\n            choice to pick the correct address (e.g., from those\n\
    \            provided or not provided with mobility support) depending on\n  \
    \          the application requirements.  When using client-based\n          \
    \  mobility management, the MN is itself aware of the anchoring\n            capabilities\
    \ of its assigned IP addresses.  This is not\n            necessarily the case\
    \ with network-based IP mobility\n            management, as current mechanisms\
    \ do not allow the MN to be\n            aware of the properties of its IP addresses.\
    \  For example,\n            the MN does not know whether or not the allocated\
    \ IP\n            addresses are anchored.  However, there are proposals such\n\
    \            as [CLASS-PREFIX], [PREFIX-PROPERTIES], and [MULTI-ARCH],\n     \
    \       where the network could indicate such properties during IP\n         \
    \   address assignment procedures.  These proposals could be\n            considered\
    \ as attempts to fix the gap.\n   GAP2-3:  The handling of mobility management\
    \ to the granularity of an\n            individual session of a user/device needs\

    \ has to support any security\n   protocols and mechanisms needed to secure the\
    \ network and to make\n   continuous security improvements.  In addition, with\

    \ solutions are expected to allow\n   the development of multicast solutions to\
    \ avoid network inefficiency\n   in multicast traffic delivery.\n   Current IP\
    \ mobility solutions address mainly the mobility problem for\n   unicast traffic.\
    \  Solutions relying on the use of an anchor point for\n   tunneling multicast\

    \ Discovery (MLD)\n   proxy function at the MAG and either a multicast router\
    \ or another\n   MLD proxy function at the LMA.  The routing optimization solution\n\

- title: 5.9.  Summary
  contents:
  - "5.9.  Summary\n   We next list the main gaps identified from the analysis performed\n\
    \   above:\n   GAP1-1:  Existing solutions only provide an optimal initial anchor\n\
    \            assignment, a gap being the lack of dynamic anchor change/\n    \
    \        new anchor assignment.  Neither the HA switch nor the LMA\n         \
    \   runtime assignment allows changing the anchor during an\n            ongoing\
    \ session.  MOBIKE allows change of GW, but its\n            applicability has\
    \ been scoped to a very narrow use case.\n   GAP1-2:  The MN needs to be able\
    \ to perform source address selection.\n            A proper mechanism to inform\
    \ the MN is lacking, so there is\n            not a basis for performing the correct\
    \ selection.\n   GAP1-3:  Currently, there is no efficient mechanism specified\
    \ by the\n            IETF that allows the dynamic discovery of the presence of\n\
    \            nodes that can play the role of anchor, discover their\n        \
    \    capabilities, and allow the selection of the most suitable\n            one.\
    \  However, the following mechanisms could help\n            discovering anchors:\n\
    \            Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD): The use of the\n  \
    \          home agent flag (H) in Router Advertisements (which\n            indicates\
    \ that the router sending the Router Advertisement\n            is also functioning\
    \ as a Mobile IPv6 home agent on the link)\n            and the MAP option in\
    \ Router Advertisements defined by\n            HMIPv6.\n   GAP1-4:  While existing\
    \ network-based DMM practices may allow the\n            deployment of multiple\
    \ LMAs and dynamically select the best\n            one, this requires to still\
    \ keep some centralization in the\n            control plane to access the policy\
    \ database (as defined in\n            RFC 5213).  Although [RFC7389] allows a\
    \ MAG to perform\n            splitting of its control and user planes, there\
    \ is a lack of\n            solutions/extensions that support a clear control-\
    \ and data-\n            plane separation for IETF IP mobility protocols in a\
    \ DMM\n            context.\n   GAP2-1:  The information of which sessions at\
    \ the mobile node are\n            active and are using the mobility support need\
    \ to be\n            transferred to, or shared with, the network.  Such mechanism\n\
    \            has not been defined.\n   GAP2-2:  The mobile node needs to simultaneously\
    \ use multiple IP\n            addresses with different properties.  There is\
    \ a lack of\n            mechanism to expose this information to the mobile node,\n\
    \            which can then update accordingly its source address\n          \
    \  selection mechanism.\n   GAP2-3:  The handling of mobility management has not\
    \ been to the\n            granularity of an individual session of a user/device\n\
    \            before.  The combination of session identification and user/\n  \
    \          device identification may be lacking.\n   GAP6-1:  Mobility management\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The deployment of DMM using existing IP mobility\
    \ protocols raises\n   similar security threats as those encountered in centralized\
    \ mobility\n   management systems.  Without authentication, a malicious node could\n\
    \   forge signaling messages and redirect traffic from its legitimate\n   path.\
    \  This would amount to a denial-of-service attack against the\n   specific node\
    \ or nodes for which the traffic is intended.\n   Distributed mobility anchoring,\
    \ while keeping current security\n   mechanisms, might require more security associations\
    \ to be managed by\n   the mobility management entities, potentially leading to\
    \ scalability\n   and performance issues.  Moreover, distributed mobility anchoring\n\
    \   makes mobility security problems more complex, since traffic\n   redirection\
    \ requests might come from previously unconsidered origins,\n   thus leading to\
    \ distributed points of attack.  Consequently, the DMM\n   security design needs\
