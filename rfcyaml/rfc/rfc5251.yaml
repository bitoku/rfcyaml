  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the Basic Mode of Layer 1 VPNs (L1VPN
    BM)\n   that is outlined in [RFC4847].  The applicability of Layer 1 VPNS is\n
    \  covered in [RFC5253].  In this document, we consider a layer 1\n   service
    provider network that consists of devices that support GMPLS\n   (e.g., Lambda
    Switch Capable (LSC) devices, optical cross-connects,\n   Synchronous Optical
    Network / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\n   (SONET/SDH) cross-connects, etc.).
    \ We partition these devices into P\n   (provider) and PE (provider edge) devices.
    \ In the context of this\n   document we will refer to the former devices as just
    \"P\", and to the\n   latter devices as just \"PE\".  The Ps are connected only
    to the\n   devices within the provider's network.  The PEs are connected to the\n
    \  other devices within the network (either Ps or PEs), as well as to\n   the
    devices outside of the service provider network.  We'll refer to\n   such other
    devices as Customer Edge (CE) devices.  An example of a CE\n   would be a GMPLS-enabled
    device that is either a router, an SDH\n   cross-connect, or an Ethernet switch.\n
    \  [RFC4208] defines signaling from the CE to the PE.  In [RFC4208], the\n   term
    \"Core Node (CN)\" corresponds to P and PE nodes, and the term\n   \"Edge Node
    (EN)\" corresponds to CE nodes.  We additionally define an\n   \"edge Core Node\"
    corresponding to a PE.\n   Figure 1 illustrates the components in an L1VPN network.\n

    \   +---+\n            Figure 1: Generalized Layer 1 VPN Reference Model\n   This
    document specifies how the L1VPN Basic Mode service can be\n   realized using
    off-line provisioning or VPN auto-discovery,\n   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) Signaling\n   [RFC3471], [RFC3473], Routing [RFC4202], and LMP
    [RFC4204]\n   mechanisms.\n   L1VPN auto-discovery has similar requirements [RFC4847]
    to L3VPN\n   auto-discovery.  As with L3VPNs, there are protocol choices to be\n
    \  made with auto-discovery.  Section 4.1.1 deals with the information\n   that
    needs to be discovered.\n   GMPLS routing and signaling are used without extensions
    within the\n   service provider network to establish and maintain LSC or SONET/SDH\n
    \  (Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)) connections between service\n   provider
    nodes.  This follows the model in [RFC4208].\n   In L1VPN Basic Mode, the use
    of LMP facilitates the population of the\n   Port Information Tables of the service
    provider.  Indeed, LMP MAY be\n   used as an option to automate local CE-to-PE
    link discovery.  LMP\n   also MAY augment routing (in enhanced mode) as well as
    failure\n   handling capabilities.\n   Consideration of inter-AS and inter-provider
    L1VPNs requires further\n   analysis beyond the scope of this document.\n"

  - "2.  Layer 1 VPN Service\n   Layer 1 VPN services on the interfaces of customer
    and service\n   provider ports MAY be any of the Layer 1 interfaces supported
    by\n   GMPLS.  Since the mechanisms specified in this document use GMPLS as\n
    \  the signaling mechanism, and since GMPLS applies to both SONET/SDH\n   (TDM)
    and LSC interfaces, it follows that L1VPN services include (but\n   are not restricted)
    to LSC- or TDM-based equipment.  Note that this\n   document describes Basic Mode
    L1VPNs and as such requires that:\n   (1) GMPLS RSVP-TE is used for signaling
    both within the service\n       provider (between PEs), as well as between the
    customer and the\n       service provider (between CE and PE);\n   (2) GMPLS Routing
    on the CE-to-PE link is outside the scope of the\n       Basic Mode of operation
    of L1VPN; see [RFC4847].\n   A CE is connected to a PE via one or more links.
    \ In the context of\n   this document, a link is a GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)
    link\n   construct, as defined in [RFC4202].  In the context of this document,\n
    \  a TE link is a logical construct that is a member of a VPN, hence\n   introducing
    the notion of membership to a set of CEs forming the VPN.\n   Interfaces at the
    end of each link are limited to either TDM or LSC\n   as supported by GMPLS.  More
    specifically, a <CE, PE> link MUST be of\n   the type <X, LSC> or <Y, TDM> where
    X = PSC (Packet Switch Capable),\n   L2SC (Layer 2 Switch Capable), or TDM and
    Y = PSC or L2SC.  In case\n   the LSP is not terminated by the CE, X MAY also
    = LSC and Y = TDM.\n   One of the applications of a L1VPN connection is to provide
    a\n   \"virtual private lambda\" or similar.  In this case, the CE is truly\n
    \  the endpoint in GMPLS terms, and its switching capability on the TE\n   link
    is not relevant (although its Generalized Protocol Identifier\n   (GPID) MUST
    be signaled and identical at both CEs, i.e., head-end and\n   tail-end CE).\n
    \  Likewise, PEs could be any Layer 1 devices that are supported by\n   GMPLS
    (e.g., optical cross-connects, SDH cross-connects), while CEs\n   MAY be devices
    at layers 1, 2, and 3, such as an SDH cross-connect,\n   an Ethernet switch, and
    a router, respectively).\n   Each TE link MAY consist of one or more channels
    or sub-channels\n   (e.g., wavelength or wavelength and timeslot, respectively).
    \ For the\n   purpose of this discussion, all the channels within a given link
    MUST\n   have similar shared characteristics (e.g., switching capability,\n   encoding,
    type, etc.), and MAY be selected independently from the\n   CE's point of view.
    \ Channels on different links of a CE need not\n   have the same characteristics.\n
    \  There MAY be more than one TE link between a given CE-PE pair.  A CE\n   MAY
    be connected to more than one PE (with at least one port per PE).\n   And, conversely,
    a PE MAY have more than one CE from different VPNs\n   connected to it.\n   If
    a CE is connected to a PE via multiple TE links and all the links\n   belong to
    the same VPN, these links (referred to as component links)\n   MAY be treated
    as a single TE link using the link bundling constructs\n   [RFC4201].\n   In order
    to satisfy the requirements of the L1VPN Basic Mode, it is\n   REQUIRED that for
    a given CE-PE pair at least one of the links\n   between them has at least one
    data bearing channel, and at least one\n   control bearing channel, or that there
    is IP reachability between the\n   CE and the PE that could be used to exchange
    control information.\n   A point-to-point link has two end-points: one on the
    CE and one on\n   the PE.  This document refers to the former as \"CE port\",
    and to the\n   latter as \"PE port\".  From the above, it follows that a CE is\n
    \  connected to a PE via one or more ports, where each port MAY consist\n   of
    one or more channels or sub-channels (e.g., wavelength or\n   wavelength and timeslot,
    respectively), and all the channels within a\n   given port have shared similar
    characteristics and can be\n   interchanged from the CE's point of view.  Similar
    to the definition\n   of a TE link, in the context of this document, ports are
    logical\n   constructs that are used to represent a grouping of physical\n   resources
    that are used to connect a CE to a PE on a per-L1VPN basis.\n   At any point in
    time, a given port on a PE is associated with at most\n   one L1VPN, or, to be
    more precise, with at most one Port Information\n   Table maintained by the PE
    (although different ports on a given PE\n   could be associated with different
    L1VPNs, or, to be more precise,\n   with different Port Information Tables).  The
    association of a port\n   with a VPN MAY be defined by provisioning the relationship
    on the\n   service provider devices.  In other words, the context of a VPN\n   membership
    in Basic Mode is enforced through service provider\n   control.\n   It is REQUIRED
    that the interface (that is between the CE and PE and\n   that is used for the
    purpose of signaling) be capable of\n   initiating/processing GMPLS protocol messages
    [RFC3473] and of\n   following the procedures described in [RFC4208].\n   An important
    goal of L1VPN service is the ability to support what is\n   known as \"single-ended
    provisioning\", where the addition of a new\n   port to a given L1VPN involves
    configuration changes only on the PE\n   that has this port.  The extension of
    this model to the CE is outside\n   the scope of the L1VPN BM.\n   Another important
    goal in the L1VPN service is the ability to\n   establish/terminate an LSP between
    a pair of (existing) ports within\n   an L1VPN from the CE devices without involving
    configuration changes\n   in any of the service provider's devices.  In other
    words, the VPN\n   topology is under the CE device control (assuming that the
    underlying\n   PE-to-PE connectivity is provided and allowed by the network).\n
    \  The mechanisms outlined in this document aim to achieve the above\n   goals.
    \ Specifically, as part of the L1VPN service offering, these\n   mechanisms (1)
    enable the service provider to restrict the set of\n   ports to which a given
    port could be connected and (2) enable a CE to\n   establish the actual LSP to
    a subset of ports.  Finally, the\n   mechanisms allow arbitrary L1VPN topologies
    to be supported;\n   including topologies ranging from hub-and-spoke to full mesh
    point-\n   to-point connections.  Only point-to-point links are supported.\n   The
    exchange of CE routing or topology information to the service\n   provider is
    out of scope for L1VPN BM mode.\n"

      the\n   L1VPN service.  This is necessary to enable GMPLS mechanisms for path\n
      \  establishment and maintenance.  We will refer to this realm as the\n   service
      provider addressing realm.  It is further REQUIRED that each\n   L1VPN customer
      have its own addressing realm with complete freedom to\n   use private or public
      addresses.  We will refer to such realms as the\n   customer addressing realms.
      \ Customer addressing realms MAY overlap\n   addresses (i.e., non-unique address)

      realm.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Layer 1 Ports and Index\n   Within a given L1VPN, each port on a CE that
      connects the CE to a PE\n   has an identifier that is unique within that L1VPN
      (but need not be\n   unique across several L1VPNs).  One way to construct such
      an\n   identifier is to assign each port an address that is unique within a\n
      \  given L1VPN, and use this address as a port identifier.  Another way\n   to
      construct such an identifier is to assign each port on a CE an\n   index that
      is unique within that CE, assign each CE an address that\n   is unique within
      a given L1VPN, and then use a tuple <port index, CE\n   address> as a port identifier.
      \ Note that both the port and the CE\n   address MAY be an address in several
      formats.  This includes, but is\n   not limited to, IPv4 and IPv6.  This identifier
      is part of the\n   Customer addressing Realm and is used by the CE device to
      identify\n   the CE port and the CE remote port for signaling.  CEs do not know
      or\n   understand the service provider realm addresses.\n   Within a service
      provider network, each port on a PE that connects\n   that PE to a CE has an
      identifier that is unique within that network.\n   One way to construct such
      an identifier is to assign each port on a\n   PE an index that is unique within
      that PE, assign each PE an IP\n   address that is unique within the service
      provider addressing realm,\n   and then use a tuple <port index, PE IPv4 address>
      or <port index, PE\n   IPv6 address> as a port identifier within the service
      provider\n   network.  Another way to construct such an identifier is to assign
      an\n   IPv4 or IPv6 address that is unique within the service provider\n   addressing
      realm to each such port.  Either way, this IPv4 or IPv6\n   address is internal
      to the service provider network and is used for\n   GMPLS signaling within the
      service provider network.\n   As a result, each link connecting the CE to the
      PE is associated with\n   a CE port that has a unique identifier within a given
      L1VPN, and with\n   a PE port that has a unique identifier within the service
      provider\n   network.  We'll refer to the former as the Customer Port Identifier\n
      \  (CPI), and to the latter as the Provider Port Identifier (PPI).\n"
    title: 3.2.  Layer 1 Ports and Index
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Port and Index Mapping\n   This document requires that each PE port that
      has a PPI also has an\n   identifier that is unique within the L1VPN customer
      addressing realm\n   of the L1VPN associated with that port.  One way to construct
      such an\n   identifier is to assign each port an address that is unique within
      a\n   given L1VPN customer addressing realm, and use this address as a port\n
      \  identifier.  Another way to construct such an identifier is to assign\n   each
      port an index that is unique within a given PE, assign each PE\n   an IP address
      that is unique within a given L1VPN customer addressing\n   realm (but need
      not be unique within the service provider network),\n   and then use a tuple
      <port index, PE IP address> that acts as a port\n   identifier.  We'll refer
      to such port identifier as the VPN-PPI.  See\n   Figure 2.\n   For L1VPNs, it
      is a requirement that service provider operations are\n   independent of the
      VPN customer's addressing realm and the service\n   provider addressing realm
      is hidden from the customer.  To achieve\n   this, we define two identifiers
      at the PE, one customer facing and\n   the other service provider facing.  The
      PE IP address used for the\n   VPN-PPI is independent of the PE IP address used
      for the PPI (as the\n   two are taken from different address realms, the former
      from the\n   customer's addressing realm and the latter from a VPN service\n
      \  provider's addressing realm).  If for a given port on a PE, the PPI\n   and
      the VPN-PPI port identifiers are unnumbered, then they both could\n   use exactly
      the same port index.  This is a mere convenience since\n   the PPI and VPN_PPI
      can be in any combination of valid formats.\n                   (Customer realm)\n

      used for the CPIs, PPIs,\n   and VPN-PPIs could be either IPv4 or IPv6 format
      addresses.\n   For a given link connecting a CE to a PE:\n   - If the CPI is
      an IPv4 address, then the VPN-PPI MUST be an IPv4\n     address as well since
      VPN-PPIs are created from the customer\n     address space.  If the CPI is a
      <port index, CPI IPv4 address>\n     tuple, then the VPN-PPI MUST be a <port
      index, PE IPv4 address>\n     tuple for the same reason.\n   - If the CPI is
      an IPv6 address, then the VPN-PPI MUST be an IPv6\n     address as well since
      VPN-PPIs are created from the customer\n     address space.  If the CPI is a
      <port index, CPI IPv6 address>\n     tuple, then the VPN-PPI MUST be a <port

      port on the PE, whether the VPN-PPI of that port is\n   an IP address or a <port
      index, PE IP address> is independent of the\n   format of the PPI of that port.\n
      \  This document assumes that assignment of the PPIs is controlled\n   solely
      by the service provider (without any coordination with the\n   L1VPN customers),
      while assignment of addresses used by the CPIs and\n   VPN-PPIs is controlled
      solely by the administrators of L1VPN.  This\n   provides maximum flexibility.
      \ The L1VPN administrator is the entity\n   that controls the L1VPN service
      specifics for the L1VPN customers.\n   This function may be owned by the service
      provider but may also be\n   performed by a third party who has agreements with
      the service\n   provider.  And, of course, each L1VPN customer could assign
      such\n   addresses on its own, without any coordination with other L1VPNs.\n
      \  This document also requires IP connectivity between the CE and the PE\n   as
      specified earlier, which is used for the control channel between\n   CE and
      PE.  This connectivity could be either a single IP hop, which\n   could be realized
      by either a dedicated link or by an L2 VPN, or an\n   IP private network, such
      as an L3VPN.  The only requirement on this\n   connectivity is an unambiguous
      way to correlate a particular CE-to-PE\n   control channel with a particular
      L1VPN.  When such a channel is\n   realized by a dedicated link, such a link
      should be associated with a\n   particular L1VPN.  When such channel is realized

      with\n   an L1VPN.\n   We'll refer to the CE's address of this channel as the
      CE Control\n   Channel Address (CE-CC-Addr), and to the PE's address of this
      channel\n   as the PE Control Channel Address (PE-CC-Addr).  Both CE-CC-Addr
      and\n   PE-CC-Addr are REQUIRED to be unique within the L1VPN they belong to,\n
      \  but are not REQUIRED to be unique across multiple L1VPNs.  Control\n   channel
      addresses are not shared amongst multiple VPNs.  Assignment\n   of CE-CC-Addr
      and PE-CC-Addr is controlled by the administrators of\n   the L1VPN.\n   Multiple
      ports on a CE could share the same control channel only as\n   long as all these
      ports belong to the same L1VPN.  Likewise, multiple\n   ports on a PE could
      share the same control channel only as long as\n   all these ports belong to
      the same L1VPN.\n"

  - "4.  Port-Based L1VPN Basic Mode\n   An L1VPN is a port-based VPN service where
    a pair of CEs could be\n   connected through the service provider network via
    a GMPLS-based LSP\n   within a given VPN port topology.  It is precisely this
    LSP that\n   forms the basic unit of the L1VPN service that the service provider\n
    \  network offers.  If a port by which a CE is connected to a PE\n   consists
    of multiple channels (e.g., multiple wavelengths), the CE\n   could establish
    LSPs to multiple other CEs in the same VPN over this\n   single port.\n   In the
    L1VPN, the service provider does not initiate the creation of\n   an LSP between
    a pair of CE ports.  The LSP establishment is\n   initiated by the CE.  However,
    the SP, by using the\n   mechanisms/toolkit outlined in this document, restricts
    the set of\n   other CE ports, which may be the remote endpoints of LSPs that
    have\n   the given port as the local endpoint.  Subject to these restrictions,\n
    \  the CE-to-CE connectivity is under the control of the CEs themselves.\n   In
    other words, the SP allows a L1VPN to have a certain set of\n   topologies (expressed
    as a port-to-port connectivity matrix).\n   CE-initiated signaling is used to
    choose a particular topology from\n   that set.\n   For each L1VPN that has at
    least one port on a given PE, the PE\n   maintains a Port Information Table (PIT)
    associated with that L1VPN.\n   This table contains a list of <CPI, PPI> tuples
    for all the ports\n   within its L1VPN.  In addition, for local PE ports of a

      \  from two information sources:\n      1.  The information related to the CEs'
      ports that are attached to\n          the ports local to that PE.\n      2.
      \ The information about the CEs connected to the remote PEs.\n   A PIT MAY be
      populated via provisioning or by auto-discovery\n   procedures.  When provisioning
      is used, the entire table MAY be\n   populated by provisioning commands either
      at a console or by a\n   management system that may have some automation capability.
      \ As the\n   network grows, some form of automation is desirable.\n   For local
      information between a CE and a PE, a PE MAY leverage LMP to\n   populate the
      <CPI, VPN-PPI> link information.  This local information\n   also needs to be
      propagated to other PEs that share the same VPN.\n   The mechanisms for this
      are out of scope for this document, but the\n   information needed to be exchanged
      is described in Section 4.1.1.\n   The PIT is by nature VPN-specific.  A PE
      is REQUIRED to maintain a\n   PIT for each L1VPN for which it has member CEs
      locally attached.  A\n   PE does not need to maintain PITs for other L1VPNs.
      \ However, the\n   full set of PITs with all L1VPN entries for multiple VPNs
      MAY also be\n   available to all PEs.\n   The remote information in the context
      of a VPN identifier (i.e., the\n   remote CEs of this VPN) MAY also be sent

        LMP MAY be used to exchange this information.\n   Once a CPI has been discovered,

          a new PE-to-PE session\n   is established with the parameters compatible
          with the CE session.\n   Upon successful establishment of the PE-to-PE session,
          the CE\n   signaling request is sent to the egress PE.\n   At the ingress
          PE, when stitching and nesting are used, a PE-to-PE\n   session is established.
          \ This could be achieved by several means:\n      - Associating an already
          established PE-to-PE LSP or Forwarding\n        Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) to
          the destination that meets the\n        requested parameters.\n      - Establishing
          a compliant PE-to-PE LSP segment.\n   At this point, the CE's view is a
          single LSP that is point-to-point\n   between the two CEs with a virtual
          node between the PE nodes:\n   CE-PE(-)PE-CE.  The L1VPN PE nodes have a
          view of the PE-to-PE LSP\n   segment in all its detail.  The PEs do not
          have to filter the RSVP-TE\n   signaling by removing information about the
          provider topology because\n   the PE-to-PE signaling is not visible to the
          CE nodes.\n"

        - "4.3.1.3 Other Signaling\n   An ingress PE may receive and potentially reject
          a Path message that\n   contains an Explicit Route Object and so cause the
          switched\n   connection setup to fail.  However, the ingress PE may accept
          EROs,\n   which include a sequence of {<ingress PE (strict), egress CE CPI\n
          \  (loose)>}.\n   - Path message without ERO: when an ingress PE receives
          a Path\n     message from an ingress CE that contains no ERO, it MUST calculate\n
          \    a route to the destination for the PE-to-PE LSP and include that\n
          \    route in an ERO, before forwarding the Path message.  One exception\n
          \    would be if the egress core node were also adjacent to this core\n
          \    node.\n   - Path message with ERO: when an ingress PE receives a Path
          message\n     from an ingress CE that contains an ERO (of the form detailed\n
          \    above), the former computes a path to reach the egress PE.  It then\n
          \    inserts this path as part of the ERO before forwarding the Path\n     message.\n
          \  In the case of shuffling, the overlay rules for notification and RRO\n
          \  processing are identical to the User-Network Intercase (UNI) or\n   Overlay
          Model [RFC4208], which state that Edge PE MAY remove/edit\n   Provider Notification
          and RRO objects when passing the messages to\n   the CEs.\n"

    - "4.4.  Recovery Procedures\n   Signaling:\n   A CE requests a network-protected
      LSP (i.e., an LSP that is protected\n   from PE-to-PE) by using the technique
      described in [RFC4873].\n   Dynamic identification of merge nodes is supported
      via the LSP\n   Segment Recovery Flags carried in the Protection object (see
      Section\n   6.2 of [RFC4873]).\n   Notification:\n   A Notify Request object
      MAY be inserted in Path or Resv messages to\n   indicate the address of a CE
      that should be notified of an LSP\n   failure.  Notifications MAY be requested
      in both the upstream and\n   downstream directions:\n      - Upstream notification
      is indicated via the inclusion of a Notify\n        Request object in the corresponding
      Path message.\n      - Downstream notification is indicated via the inclusion
      of a\n        Notify Request object in the corresponding Resv message.\n   A
      PE receiving a message containing a Notify Request object SHOULD\n   store the
      Notify Node Address in the corresponding RSVP state block.\n   The PE SHOULD
      also include a Notify Request object in the outgoing\n   Path or Resv message.
      \ The outgoing Notify Node Address MAY be\n   updated based on local policy.
      \ This means that a PE, upon receipt of\n   this object from the CE, MAY update
      the value of the Notify Node\n   Address.\n   If the ingress CE includes a Notify
      Request object into the Path\n   message, the ingress PE MAY replace the received
      'Notify Node\n   Address' by its own selected 'Notify Node Address', and in
      particular\n   the local TE Router_ID.  The Notify Request object MAY be carried
      in\n   Path or Resv messages (Section 7 of [RFC3473]).  The format of the\n
      \  Notify Request object is defined in [RFC3473].  Per Section 4.2.1 of\n   [RFC3473],
      Notify Node Addresses SHALL be set to either IPv4 or IPv6.\n   Inclusion of
      a Notify Request object is used to request the\n   generation of notifications
      upon failure occurrence but does not\n   guarantee that a Notify message will
      be generated.\n"

  title: 4.  Port-Based L1VPN Basic Mode
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security for L1VPNs is covered in [RFC4847] and
    [RFC5253].  In this\n   document, we discuss the security aspects with respect
    to the control\n   plane.\n   The association of a particular port with a particular
    L1VPN (or to\n   be more precise, with a particular PIT) is a configuration operation,\n
    \  generally done manually by the service provider as part of the\n   service
    provisioning process.  Thus, it cannot be altered via\n   signaling between CE
    and PE.  This means that the signaling cannot be\n   used to deliver L1VPN traffic
    to the wrong customer.  The operator\n   should apply appropriate security mechanisms
    to the management and\n   configuration process, and should consider data plane
    verification\n   techniques to protect against accidental misconfiguration.  The\n
    \  customer may also apply end-to-end (i.e., CE-to-CE) data plane\n   connectivity
    tests over the L1VPN connection to detect misconnection.\n   Data plane connectivity
    testing can be performed using the Link\n   Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204].\n
    \  Note that it is also possible to populate the local part of a PIT\n   using
    auto-discovery through LMP.  LMP may be secured as described in\n   [RFC4204].
    \ Signaling between CE and PE is assumed to be over a\n   private link (for example,
    in-band or in-fiber) or a private network.\n   Use of a private link makes the
    CE-to-PE connection secure at the\n   same level as the data link described in
    the previous paragraphs.\n   The use of a private network assumes that entities
    outside the\n   network cannot spoof or modify control plane communications between\n
    \  CE and PE.  Furthermore, all entities in the private network are\n   assumed
    to be trusted.  Thus, no security mechanisms are required by\n   the protocol
    exchanges described in this document.\n   However, an operator that is concerned
    about the security of their\n   private control plane network may use the authentication
    and\n   integrity functions available in RSVP-TE [RFC3473] or utilize IPsec\n
    \  ([RFC4301], [RFC4302], [RFC4835], [RFC4306], and [RFC2411]) for the\n   point-to-point
    signaling between PE and CE.  See [MPLS-SEC] for a\n   full discussion of the
    security options available for the GMPLS\n   control plane.\n   Note further that
    a private network (e.g., Layer 2 VPN or Layer 3\n   VPN) might be used to provide
    control plane connectivity between a PE\n   and more than one CE.  In this scenario,
    it is RECOMMENDED that each\n   L1 VPN customer have its own such private network.
    \ Then, the\n   security mechanisms provided by the private network SHOULD be
    used to\n   ensure security of the control plane communication between a customer\n
    \  and a service provider.\n"
