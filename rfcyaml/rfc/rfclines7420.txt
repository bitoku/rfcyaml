Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling of the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.
The PCE defined in [RFC4655] is an entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.
A PCC may make requests to a PCE for paths to be computed.
PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is defined in [RFC5440].
PCEP interactions include path computation requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
This memo defines a portion of the MIB for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be used to monitor PCEP interactions between a PCC and a PCE, or between two PCEs.
The scope of this document is to provide a MIB module for the PCEP base protocol defined in [RFC5440].
Extensions to the PCEP base protocol are beyond the scope for this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and [RFC5440].
In particular, it uses the following acronyms.
Path Computation Request (PCReq) message.
Path Computation Reply (PCRep) message.
This document uses the term "PCEP entity" to refer to a local PCEP speaker, "peer" to refer to a remote PCEP speaker, and "PCEP speaker" where it is not necessary to distinguish between local and remote.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
The PCEP MIB module contains the following information: a.  PCE and PCC local entity status (see pcePcepEntityTable).
PCEP peer information (see pcePcepPeerTable).
PCEP session information (see pcePcepSessTable).
Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.
The PCEP MIB module is limited to "read only" access except for pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate, which is used to throttle the rate at which the implementation generates notifications.
The PCEP MIB module may contain status information for multiple logical local PCEP entities.
There are several scenarios in which there may be more than one local PCEP entity, including the following.
A physical router, which is partitioned into multiple virtual routers, each with its own PCC.
A PCE device that front ends a cluster of compute resources, each with a different set of capabilities that are accessed via different IP addresses.
The pcePcepEntityTable contains one row for each local PCEP entity.
Each row is read only and contains current status information, plus the PCEP entity's running configuration.
The pcePcepEntityTable is indexed by pcePcepEntityIndex, which also acts as the primary index for the other tables in this MIB module.
The pcePcepPeerTable contains one row for each peer that the local PCEP entity knows about.
Each row is read only and contains information to identify the peer, the running configuration relating to that peer, and statistics that track the messages exchanged with that peer and its response times.
A PCEP speaker is identified by its IP address.
If there is a PCEP speaker in the network that uses multiple IP addresses, then it looks like multiple distinct peers to the other PCEP speakers in the network.
The pcePcepPeerTable is indexed first by pcePcepEntityIndex, then by pcePcepPeerAddrType and pcePcepPeerAddr.
This indexing structure allows each local PCEP entity to report its own set of peers.
Since PCEP sessions can be ephemeral, pcePcepPeerTable tracks a peer even when no PCEP session currently exists to that peer.
The statistics contained in pcePcepPeerTable are an aggregate of the statistics for all successive sessions to that peer.
To limit the quantity of information that is stored, an implementation MAY choose to discard a row from pcePcepPeerTable if and only if no PCEP session exists to the corresponding peer.
pcePcepSessTable The pcePcepSessTable contains one row for each PCEP session that the PCEP entity (PCE or PCC) is currently participating in.
Each row is read only and contains the running configuration that is applied to the session, plus identifiers and statistics for the session.
The statistics in pcePcepSessTable are semantically different from those in pcePcepPeerTable since the former applies to the current session only, whereas the latter is the aggregate for all sessions that have existed to that peer.
Although it is forbidden per [RFC5440] to have more than one active PCEP session between a given pair of PCEP entities at any one time, there is a window during session establishment where the pcePcepSessTable may contain two rows for a given peer, one representing a session initiated by the local PCEP entity and one representing a session initiated by the peer.
If either of these sessions reaches an active state, then the other is discarded.
The pcePcepSessTable is indexed first by pcePcepEntityIndex, then by pcePcepPeerAddrType and pcePcepPeerAddr, and finally by pcePcepSessInitiator.
This indexing structure allows each local PCEP entity to report its own set of active sessions.
The pcePcepSessInitiator index allows two rows to exist transiently for a given peer, as discussed above.
The PCEP MIB module contains notifications for the following conditions.
pcePcepSessUp: PCEP session has gone up.
pcePcepSessDown: PCEP session has gone down.
Local PCEP entity has sent an overload PCNtf on this session.
Local PCEP entity has sent an overload cleared PCNtf on this session.
e.  pcePcepSessPeerOverload: Peer has sent an overload PCNtf on this session.
Peer has sent an overload cleared PCNtf on this session.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
The PCEP MIB module imports the following textual conventions from the INET ADDRESS
MIB defined in RFC 4001
InetAddress PCEP relies on existing protocols that have specialized MIB objects to monitor their own activities.
Consequently, this document considers that the monitoring of underlying protocols is out of scope of the PCEP MIB module.
The following diagram illustrates the relationships between pcePcepEntityTable, pcePcepPeerTable, and pcePcepSessTable.
A peer entry with no current session.
Two sessions exist during a window in session initialization.

17 December 2014 DESCRIPTION "Initial version, published as RFC 7420."
"This table contains information about local PCEP entities.
The entries in this table are read only."
"This entry represents a local PCEP entity.
"This index is used to uniquely identify the PCEP entity."
The administrative status of this PCEP entity.
This is the desired operational status as currently set by an operator or by default in the implementation.
The value of pcePcepEntityOperStatus represents the current status of an attempt to reach this desired status."
It takes one of the following values.
: the PCEP entity is active.
operStatusDown(2): the PCEP entity is inactive.
operStatusGoingUp(3): the PCEP entity is activating.
operStatusGoingDown(4): the PCEP entity is deactivating.
operStatusFailed(5): the PCEP entity has failed and will recover when possible. operStatusFailedPerm(6): the PCEP entity has failed and will not recover without operator intervention."
The type of the PCEP entity's Internet address.
This object specifies how the value of the pcePcepEntityAddr object should be interpreted.
Only values unknown(0), ipv4(1), or ipv6(2) are supported."
{ pcePcepEntityEntry 4 } pcePcepEntityAddr OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
The local Internet address of this PCEP entity.
The type is given by pcePcepEntityAddrType.
If operating as a PCE server, the PCEP entity listens on this address.
If operating as a PCC, the PCEP entity binds outgoing TCP connections to this address.
It is possible for the PCEP entity to operate both as a PCC and a PCE server, in which case it uses this address both to listen for incoming TCP connections and to bind outgoing TCP connections."
"The time that the PCEP entity will wait to establish a TCP connection with a peer.
If a TCP connection is not established within this time, then PCEP aborts the session setup attempt."
"The maximum number of times the system tries to establish a TCP connection to a peer before the session with the peer transitions to the idle state.
When the session transitions to the idle state:
the associated PcePcepSessEntry is deleted.
a backoff timer runs before the session is tried again."
The initial backoff time for retrying a failed session setup attempt to a peer.
The backoff time increases for each failed session setup attempt, until a maximum backoff time is reached.
The maximum backoff time is pcePcepEntityMaxBackoffTimer."
"The maximum backoff time for retrying a failed session setup attempt to a peer.
The backoff time increases for each failed session setup attempt, until this maximum value is reached.
Session setup attempts then repeats periodically without any further increase in backoff time."
"The time that the PCEP entity will wait to receive an Open message from a peer after the TCP connection has come up.
If no Open message is received within this time, then PCEP terminates the TCP connection and deletes the associated PcePcepSessEntry."
"The time that the PCEP entity will wait to receive a Keepalive or PCErr message from a peer during session initialization after receiving an Open message.
If no Keepalive or PCErr message is received within this time, then PCEP terminates the TCP connection and deletes the associated PcePcepSessEntry."
This is the maximum time between two consecutive messages sent to a peer.
Zero means that the PCEP entity prefers not to send Keepalives at all.
Note that the actual Keepalive transmission intervals, in either direction of an active PCEP session, are determined by negotiation between the peers as specified by RFC 5440, and so may differ from this configured value.
For the actually negotiated values (per session), see pcePcepSessKeepaliveTimer and pcePcepSessPeerKeepaliveTimer."
This is the time after which a peer should declare a session down if it does not receive any PCEP messages.
Zero suggests that the peer does not run a DeadTimer at all."
"Whether the PCEP entity will permit negotiation of session parameters."
"In PCEP session parameter negotiation, the maximum value that this PCEP entity will accept from a peer for the interval between Keepalive transmissions.
Zero means that the PCEP entity will allow no Keepalive transmission at all."
"In PCEP session parameter negotiation, the maximum value that this PCEP entity will accept from a peer for the DeadTimer.
Zero means that the PCEP entity will allow not running a DeadTimer."
{ pcePcepEntityEntry 16 } pcePcepEntityMinKeepAliveTimer OBJECT
"In PCEP session parameter negotiation, the minimum value that this PCEP entity will accept for the interval between Keepalive transmissions.
Zero means that the PCEP entity insists on no Keepalive transmission at all."
"In PCEP session parameter negotiation, the minimum value that this PCEP entity will accept for the DeadTimer.
Zero means that the PCEP entity insists on not running a DeadTimer."
"The value of SyncTimer is used in the case of a synchronized path computation request using the SVEC object.
Consider the case where a PCReq message is received by a PCE that contains the SVEC object referring to M synchronized path computation requests.
If after the expiration of the SyncTimer all the M path computation requests have not been received, a protocol error is triggered and the PCE MUST cancel the whole set of path computation requests.
The aim of the SyncTimer is to avoid the storage of unused synchronized requests
should one of them get lost for some reason (for example, a misbehaving PCC).
A value of zero is returned if and only if the entity does not use the SyncTimer."
A PCRep message contains an unrecognized reply if it contains an RP object whose request ID does not correspond to any in progress request sent by this PCEP entity.
A PCReq message contains an unrecognized request if it contains an RP object whose request ID is zero."
"This table contains information about peers known by the local PCEP entity.
The entries in this table are read only.
This table gives peer information that spans PCEP sessions.
Information about current PCEP sessions can be found in the pcePcepSessTable table."

The notifications for a PCEP MIB module implementation."
The pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate object defined in this MIB module has a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.
In particular, pcePcepNotificationsMaxRate may be used improperly to stop notifications being issued or to permit a flood of notifications to be sent to the management agent at a high rate.
All the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The sensitivity/vulnerability arises because, collectively, these objects provide information about the amount and frequency of path computation requests and responses within the network and can reveal some aspects of its configuration.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 227 } Appendix A.  PCEP
This example considers the set of PCC/PCE relationships shown in the following figure.
The example shows the contents of the PCEP MIB module as read at PCE2 and PCCb.
The IP addresses of the PCE speakers in this diagram are given in the following table.
In this example, the PCEP session between PCCb and PCE3 is currently down.
At PCE2, there is a single local PCEP entity that has three peers (PCCa, PCCb, and PCE1).
There is a session active to all of these peers.
The contents of the PCEP MIB module as read at PCE2 are as follows.
MIB Module at PCCb At PCCb, there is a single local PCEP entity that has two peers (PCE2 and PCE3).
There is a session active to PCE2, but the session to PCE3 is currently down.
The contents of the PCEP MIB module as read at PCCb are as follows.
no session to PCE3 Acknowledgements
