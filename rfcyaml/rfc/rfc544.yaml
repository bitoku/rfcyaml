  - "               Locating On-Line Documentation at SRI-ARC\nWhere there used to\
    \ be one, there are now two files to help users locate\nuser documentation and\
    \ other files available in NLS:\n    <NIC>LOCATOR will lead the user to NIC functional\
    \ documents by means\n    of links.  Its branch labeled \"ARC SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION\"\
    \ will direct\n    the user to <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR.\n        (nic, locator,\
    \ l:w)\n    <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR includes documentation of the SRI-ARC system.\n\
    \    Many ARC features are available for Network use, and the documents\n    in\
    \ <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR should serve to introduce users to these\n    capabilities.\n\
    \        (userguides, arclocator, l:w)\nThese files are formatted in a way that\
    \ allows the documents to be\neasily accessed by inexperienced NLS users.  Both\
    \ files contain\ninstructions for their use as branch one.  To see these instructions:\n\
    \    L[oad] F[ile] <nic>locator CR\n    P[rint] B[ranch] .1 CA wn  CA\nPlease\
    \ send ideas and suggestions for the LOCATOR files to KIRK or NDM\nat SRI-ARC.\n\
