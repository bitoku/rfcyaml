Abstract A range of Management Information Base
(MIB) modules has been developed to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.
These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe.
The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) is a profile of MPLS functionality specific to the construction of packet switched transport networks.
This document describes the MIB based architecture for MPLS TP, indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS TP network management, and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.
The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP) is a packet transport technology based on a profile of the MPLS functionality specific to the construction of packet switched transport networks.
MPLS is described in [RFC3031], and requirements for MPLS TP are specified in [RFC5654].
A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been developed to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.
These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of responsibility for the modules that they describe.
An MPLS TP network can be operated via static provisioning of transport paths, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and pseudowires (PWs), or the elective use of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control plane to support dynamic provisioning of transport paths, LSPs, and PWs.
This document describes the MIB based management architecture for MPLS, as extended for MPLS TP.
The document also indicates the interrelationships between existing MIB modules that should be leveraged for MPLS TP network management and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.
Note that [RFC5951] does not specify a preferred management interface protocol to be used as the standard protocol for managing MPLS TP networks.
The management of the MPLS TP networks is separable from that of its client networks so that the same means of management can be used regardless of the client.
The management function of MPLS TP includes fault management, configuration management, performance monitoring, and security management.
The purpose of the management function is to provide control and monitoring of the MPLS transport profile protocol mechanisms and procedures.
The requirements for the network management functionality are found in [RFC5951].
A description of the network and element management architectures that can be applied to the management of MPLS based transport networks is found in [RFC5950].
This document also uses terminology from the MPLS architecture document [RFC3031], Pseudowire Emulation Edge to
Edge (PWE3) architecture [RFC3985], and the following MPLS related MIB modules:
the MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813], MPLS TE STD MIB
[RFC3812], MPLS LDP STD MIB [RFC3815],
MPLS FTN STD MIB [RFC3814], and TE LINK
The SNMP Management Framework Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of [RFC3410].
This document discusses MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].
This section describes the existing tools and techniques for managing and modeling MPLS networks, devices, and protocols.
It is intended to provide a description of the tool kit that is already available.
Section 5 of this document outlines the applicability of existing MPLS
MIB modules to MPLS TP, describes the optional use of GMPLS MIB modules in MPLS TP networks, and examines the additional MIB modules and objects that would be required for managing an MPLS TP network.
MPLS Management Overview and Requirements [RFC4378] outlines how data plane protocols can assist in providing the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) requirements outlined in [RFC4377] and how it is applied to the management functions of fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (commonly known as FCAPS) for MPLS networks.
[RFC4221] describes the management architecture for MPLS.
In particular, it describes how the managed objects defined in various MPLS related MIB modules model different aspects of MPLS, as well as the interactions and dependencies between each of these MIB modules.
[RFC4377] describes the requirements for user  and data plane OAM and applications for MPLS.
[RFC5654] describes the requirements for the optional use of a control plane to support dynamic provisioning of MPLS TP transport paths.
The MPLS TP LSP control plane is based on GMPLS and is described in [RFC3945].
An Introduction to the MPLS and Pseudowire
Structure of the MPLS MIB OID Tree
The MPLS MIB Object Identifier (OID) tree has the following structure.
It is based on the tree originally set out in Section 4.1 of [RFC4221] and has been enhanced to include other relevant MIB modules.
LDP GENERIC STD MIB [RFC3815]
The OIDs for MIB modules are assigned and managed by IANA.
They can be found in the referenced MIB documents.
The MPLS TC STD MIB [RFC3811], GMPLS TC STD MIB [RFC4801], IANA GMPLS TC MIB [RFC4802], and PW TC STD MIB [RFC5542] contain the Textual Conventions for MPLS and GMPLS networks.
These Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules that manage MPLS and GMPLS networks.
Section 4.2.11 highlights dependencies on additional external MIB modules.
An LSP is a path over which a labeled packet travels across the sequence of Label Switching Routers (LSRs) for a given Forward Equivalence Class (FEC).
When a packet, with or without a label, arrives at an ingress Label Edge Router (LER) of an LSP, it is encapsulated with the label corresponding to the FEC and sent across the LSP.
The labeled packet traverses the LSRs and arrives at the egress LER of the LSP, where it gets forwarded, depending on the packet type it came with.
LSPs could be nested using label stacking, such that an LSP could traverse another LSP.
A more detailed description of an LSP can be found in [RFC3031].
The MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813] describes the objects required to define the LSP.
Label Edge Router (LER) Modules Ingress and egress LSRs of an LSP are known as Label Edge Routers (LERs).
An ingress LER takes each incoming unlabeled or labeled packet and encapsulates it with the corresponding label of the LSP it represents, and then forwards it to the adjacent LSR of the LSP.
Each FEC is mapped to a label forwarding entry, so that a packet could be encapsulated with one or more label entries; this is referred to as a label stack.
The packet traverses the LSP.
Upon reaching the egress LER, further action will be taken to handle the packet, depending on the type of packet received.
details the functionality of ingress and egress LERs.
The MPLS FTN STD MIB [RFC3814] describes the managed objects for mapping FEC to label bindings.
Label Switching Router (LSR) Modules A router that performs MPLS forwarding is known as an LSR.
An LSR receives a labeled packet and performs forwarding action based on the label received.
The LSR maintains a mapping of an incoming label and incoming interface to one or more outgoing labels and outgoing interfaces in its forwarding database.
When a labeled packet is received, the LSR examines the topmost label in the label stack and then does a 'swap', 'push', or 'pop' operation based on the contents.
The MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813] describes the managed objects for modeling an MPLS [RFC3031] LSR.
The MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813] contains the managed objects to maintain mapping of in segments to out segments.
MIB architecture provides a layered modular model into which any supported emulated service such as Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) can be connected to any supported Packet Switched Network (PSN) type.
This MIB architecture is modeled based on PW3 architecture [RFC3985].
The emulated service layer, generic PW layer, and PSN Virtual Circuit (VC) layer constitute the different layers of the model.
A combination of the MIB modules belonging to each layer provides the glue for mapping the emulated service onto the native PSN service.
At least three MIB modules, each belonging to a different layer, are required to define a PW emulated service.
The service specific module is dependent on the emulated signal type and helps in modeling the emulated service layer.
The PW ENET STD MIB [RFC5603] describes a model for managing Ethernet pseudowire services for transmission over a PSN.
This MIB module is generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in the PWE3 Architecture [RFC3985], which describes the transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types.
In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for the Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)) to a point to point PW.
It is complementary to the PW STD MIB [RFC5601], which manages the generic PW parameters common to all services, including all supported PSN types.
The PW TDM MIB [RFC5604] describes a model for managing TDM pseudowires, i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission over a PSN.
The term "TDM" in this document is limited to the scope of Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).
It is currently specified to carry any TDM signals in either Structure Agnostic Transport mode (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or Structure Aware Transport mode (E1, T1, and NxDS0) as defined in the PWE3 TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].
The generic PW module configures general parameters of the PW that are common to all types of emulated services and PSN types.
The PW STD MIB [RFC5601] defines a MIB module that can be used to manage PW services for transmission over a PSN [RFC3931]
This MIB module provides generic management of PWs that is common to all types of PSN and PW services defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.
The PSN specific module associates the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
There is a different module for each type of PSN.
The PW MPLS STD MIB [RFC5602] describes a model for managing pseudowire services for transmission over different flavors of MPLS tunnels.
The generic PW MIB module [RFC5601] defines the parameters global to the PW, regardless of the underlying PSN and emulated service.
This document is applicable for PWs that use the MPLS PSN type in the PW STD MIB.
Additionally, this document describes the MIB objects that define pseudowire association to the MPLS PSN that is not specific to the carried service.
[RFC3812], and [RFC3813] describe the modeling of an MPLS tunnel and a tunnel's underlying cross connects.
This MIB module supports MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE)
PSNs, non TE MPLS PSNs (an outer tunnel created by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or manually), and MPLS PW labels only (no outer tunnel).
In MPLS traffic engineering, it's possible to specify explicit routes or choose routes based on QoS metrics in setting up a path such that some specific data can be routed around network hot spots.
TE LSPs can be set up through a management plane or a control plane.
The MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812] describes managed objects for modeling MPLS [RFC3031]
This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS  based traffic engineering configuration and management.
The purpose of MPLS resiliency is to ensure minimal interruption to traffic when a failure occurs within the system or network.
Various components of MPLS resiliency solutions are as follows:
1) Graceful restart in LDP and RSVP TE modules 2) Make before break 3)
Protection switching for LSPs 4)
Fast reroute for LSPs 5)
The MIB modules below only support MIB based management for MPLS resiliency.
MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) is a restoration network resiliency mechanism used in MPLS TE to redirect traffic onto the backup LSPs in tens of milliseconds in case of link or node failure across the LSP.
FRR GENERAL STD MIB [RFC6445] contains objects that apply to any MPLS LSR implementing MPLS TE fast reroute functionality.
The MPLS FRR ONE2ONE STD
MIB [RFC6445] contains objects that apply to the one to one backup method.
STD MIB [RFC6445] contains objects that apply to the facility backup method.
Protection switching mechanisms have been designed to provide network resiliency for MPLS networks.
Different types of protection switching mechanisms, such as 1:1, 1:N, and 1 1, have been designed.
Fault Management and Performance Management MPLS manages LSP and pseudowire faults through the use of LSP ping [RFC4379], Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085], Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for LSPs [RFC5884], and BFD for VCCV [RFC5885] tools.
MPLS currently focuses on in and/or out packet counters, errored packets, and discontinuity time.
Some of the MPLS and pseudowire performance tables used for performance management are given below.
The mplsTunnelPerfTable [RFC3812] provides several counters (e.g., packets forwarded, packets dropped because of errors) to measure the performance of the MPLS tunnels.
The mplsInterfacePerfTable [RFC3813] provides performance information (incoming and outgoing labels in use, and lookup failures) on a per interface basis.
[RFC3813] contains statistical information (total packets received by the in segment, total errored packets received, total packets discarded, discontinuity time) for incoming MPLS segments to an LSR.
[RFC3813] contains statistical information (total packets received, total errored packets received, total packets discarded, discontinuity time) for outgoing MPLS segments from an LSR.
[RFC3814] contains performance information for the specified interface and an FTN entry mapped to this interface.
The mplsLdpEntityStatsTable [RFC3815] and mplsLdpSessionStatsTable [RFC3815] contain statistical information (session attempts, errored packets, notifications) about an LDP entity.
The pwPerfCurrentTable [RFC5601], pwPerfIntervalTable [RFC5601], and pwPerf1DayIntervalTable [RFC5601] provide pseudowire performance information (in and/or out packets)
based on time (current interval, preconfigured specific interval, 1 day interval).
The pwEnetStatsTable [RFC5603] contains statistical counters specific for Ethernet PW.
The pwTDMPerfCurrentTable [RFC5604], pwTDMPerfIntervalTable [RFC5604], and pwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable [RFC5604] contain statistical information accumulated per 15 minute, 24 hour, and 1 day periods, respectively.
The gmplsTunnelErrorTable [RFC4802] and gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable [RFC4802] provide information about performance, errored packets, and in/out packet counters.
MIB Module Interdependencies This section provides an overview of the relationship between the MPLS MIB modules for managing MPLS networks.
More details of these relationships are given below.
[RFC4221] mainly focuses on MPLS MIB module interdependencies.
This section also highlights GMPLS and PW MIB module interdependencies.
The relationship "A   B" means that A depends on B and that MIB module A uses an object, object identifier, or Textual Convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module
A contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an object in MIB module
Thus,  All the MPLS MIB modules depend on the MPLS TC STD MIB.
All the GMPLS MIB modules depend on the GMPLS TC STD MIB.
All the PW MIB modules depend on the PW TC STD MIB.
The MPLS LDP STD MIB, MPLS TE STD MIB, MPLS FTN STD MIB, GMPLS LSR STD MIB, and PW MPLS
STD MIB contain references to objects in the MPLS LSR STD MIB.
The MPLS LDP GENERIC STD MIB contains references to objects in the MPLS LDP STD MIB.
The MPLS FTN STD MIB, PW MPLS STD MIB, and GMPLS TE STD MIB contain references to objects in the MPLS TE STD MIB.
The PW MPLS STD MIB and PW ENET STD MIB contain references to objects in the PW STD MIB.
STD MIB contains references to objects in the IANA PWE3 MIB.
The GMPLS TE STD MIB contains references to objects in the IANA GMPLS TC MIB.
The GMPLS LSR STD MIB contains references to objects in the GMPLS LABEL STD MIB.
Note that there is a Textual Convention (MplsIndexType) defined in the MPLS LSR STD MIB that is imported by the MPLS LDP STD MIB.
Dependencies on External MIB Modules With the exception of the MPLS TC STD MIB, all the MPLS MIB modules have dependencies on the Interfaces MIB (also called the Interfaces Group MIB or the IF MIB)
The MPLS FTN STD MIB references IP capable interfaces on which received traffic is to be classified using indexes in the Interfaces Table (ifTable) of the IF MIB [RFC2863].
The other MPLS MIB modules reference MPLS capable interfaces in the ifTable.
The IF MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for managing interfaces.
The MPLS MIB modules contain media specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
The MPLS MIB modules assume the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in accordance with [RFC2863], which states that the ifTable contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that each sub layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface.
Thus, the MPLS interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable.
The interrelation of entries in the ifTable is defined by the Interface Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].
The MPLS MIB modules have dependencies on the TE LINK STD MIB for maintaining traffic engineering information.
The MPLS MIB modules depend on the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) component to obtain the path required for an MPLS tunnel to reach the end point of the tunnel, and on the BFD component to verify data plane failures of LSPs and PWs.
Finally, all of the MIB modules import standard Textual Conventions such as integers, strings, timestamps, etc., from the MIB modules in which they are defined.
Applicability of MPLS MIB Modules to MPLS TP
This section highlights gaps in existing MPLS MIB modules in order to determine extensions or additional MIB modules that are required to support MPLS TP in MPLS networks.
[RFC5951] specifies the requirements for the management of equipment used in networks supporting MPLS TP.
It also details the essential network management capabilities for operating networks consisting of MPLS TP equipment.
[RFC5950] provides the network management framework for MPLS TP.
The document explains how network elements and networks that support MPLS TP can be managed using solutions that satisfy the requirements defined in [RFC5951].
The relationship between MPLS TP management and OAM is described in the MPLS TP framework document [RFC5950].
The MPLS MIB documents MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812], PW STD MIB [RFC5601], and MPLS
LSR STD MIB [RFC3813], and their associated MIB modules, are reused for MPLS based transport network management.
Fault management and performance management form key parts of the OAM function.
MPLS TP OAM is described in [RFC6371].
An MPLS TP tunnel can be operated over IP and/or ITU T Carrier Code (ICC) environments.
The points below capture the gaps in existing MPLS
MIB modules for managing MPLS TP networks.
The MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812] does not support the tunnel Ingress/Egress identifier based on Global ID and Node ID [RFC6370].
The MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812] does not support co routed/associated bidirectional tunnel configurations.
The MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812] does not support the tunnel LSR identifier based on ICC.
New MIB definitions may be created for Global Node ID and/or ICC configurations.
The MPLS LSR STD MIB [RFC3813] module may be enhanced to identify the next hop based on a Media Access Control (MAC) address for environments that do not use IP.
The mplsOutSegmentTable may be extended to hold the MAC address.
The MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812] and MPLS LSR STD MIB may be enhanced to provide static and signaling MIB module extensions for co routed/associated bidirectional LSPs.
Gap Analysis MPLS TP pseudowire can be operated over IP and/or ICC environments.
The points below capture the gaps in existing PW MIB modules for managing MPLS TP networks.
[RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers to be used in MPLS TP.
These identifiers were chosen to be compatible with existing MPLS, GMPLS, and PW definitions.
[RFC5601] does not support the PW end point identifier based on Global ID and Node ID.
The PW MPLS STD MIB [RFC5602] does not support operation over co routed/associated bidirectional tunnels.
[RFC5601] does not support the PW end point identifier based on ICC.
The PW MPLS STD MIB [RFC5602] can be enhanced to operate over co routed/associated bidirectional tunnels.
MIB modules do not support MPLS TP sections.
Recommendations Link specific and/or path/segment specific sections can be supported by enhancing the IF MIB [RFC2863], MPLS TE STD MIB [RFC3812], and PW STD MIB
Gap Analysis MPLS manages LSP and pseudowire faults through LSP ping [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], BFD for LSPs [RFC5884], and BFD for VCCV [RFC5885] tools.
The MPLS MIB modules do not support the following MPLS TP OAM functions:  Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification  Remote Defect Indication  Alarm Reporting
Lock Reporting  Lock Instruct  Client Failure
Indication  Packet Loss Measurement  Packet Delay Measurement 5.4.2.
Recommendations New MIB module for BFD can be created to address all the gaps mentioned in Section 5.4.1.
MPLS TP Protection Switching and Recovery 5.5.1.
An important aspect that MPLS TP technology provides is protection switching.
In general, the mechanism of protection switching can be described as the substitution of a protection or standby facility for a working or primary facility.
The MPLS MIB modules do not provide support for protection switching and recovery in the following three topologies: linear, ring, and mesh.
Recommendations New MIB modules can be created to address all the gaps mentioned in Section 5.5.1.
As per [RFC6370], an LSR requires identification of the node itself and of its interfaces.
An interface is the attachment point to a server layer MPLS TP section or MPLS TP tunnel.
The MPLS MIB modules do not provide support for configuring the interfaces within the context of an operator.
Recommendations New MIB definitions can be created to address the gaps mentioned in Section 5.6.1.
An Introduction to the MPLS TP
This section highlights new MIB modules that have been identified as being required for MPLS TP.
This section also provides an overview of the purpose of each MIB module within the MIB documents, what it can be used for, and how it relates to the other MIB modules.
Note that each new MIB module (apart from Textual Conventions modules) will contain one or more Compliance Statements to indicate which objects must be supported in what manner to claim a specific level of compliance.
Additional text, either in the documents that define the MIB modules or in separate Applicability Statements, will define which Compliance Statements need to be conformed to in order to provide specific MPLS TP functionality.
This document does not set any requirements in that respect, although some recommendations are included in the sections that follow.
MPLS TP MIB Modules 6.1.1.
New MIB Modules for MPLS
TP Four new MIB modules are identified as follows:  Textual Conventions for MPLS TP  Identifiers for MPLS TP
LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS TP  Tunnel Extensions for MPLS TP Note that the MIB modules mentioned here are applicable for MPLS operations as well.
TP A new MIB module needs to be written that will define Textual Conventions [RFC2579] for MPLS TP related MIB modules.
These conventions allow multiple MIB modules to use the same syntax and format to provide a concept that is shared between the MIB modules.
For example, a Maintenance Entity Group End Point (MEP) identifier is used to identify a maintenance entity group end point within MPLS TP networks.
The Textual Convention representing the MEP identifier should be defined in a new Textual Convention MIB module.
All new extensions related to MPLS TP are defined in the MIB module and will be referenced by other MIB modules to support MPLS TP.
Identifiers for MPLS TP New identifiers describe managed objects that are used to model common MPLS TP identifiers [RFC6370].
LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS TP
The MPLS LSR STD MIB describes managed objects for modeling an MPLS LSR.
This puts it at the heart of the management architecture for MPLS.
In the case of MPLS TP, the MPLS LSR STD MIB is extended to support MPLS TP LSPs, which are co routed or associated bidirectionally.
This extended MIB is also applicable for modeling MPLS TP tunnels.
Tunnel Extensions for MPLS TP
The MPLS TE STD MIB describes managed objects that are used to model and manage MPLS TE tunnels.
MPLS TP tunnels are very similar to MPLS TE tunnels but are co routed or associated bidirectionally.
The MPLS TE STD MIB must be extended to support the MPLS TP specific attributes for the tunnel.
PWE3 MIB Modules for MPLS TP
This section provides an overview of pseudowire extension MIB modules used to meet MPLS based transport network requirements.
New MIB Modules for MPLS
Three new MIB modules are identified as follows:  Pseudowire Textual Conventions for MPLS TP  Pseudowire Extensions for MPLS TP  Pseudowire MPLS Extensions for MPLS TP 6.2.2.
Pseudowire Textual Conventions for MPLS TP
The PW TC STD MIB defines Textual Conventions used for PW technology and for PWE3 MIB modules.
A new Textual Convention MIB module is required to define textual definitions for MPLS TP specific pseudowire attributes.
Pseudowire Extensions for MPLS TP
The PW STD MIB describes managed objects for the modeling of pseudowire edge to edge services carried over a general PSN.
This MIB module is extended to support MPLS TP specific attributes related to pseudowires.
Pseudowire MPLS Extensions for MPLS TP
The PW MPLS STD MIB defines the managed objects for pseudowire operations over MPLS LSRs.
This MIB module supports  manually and dynamically signaled PWs  point to point connections
the use of any emulated service  outer tunnels provisioned using MPLS TE  PWs with no outer tunnel An extended MIB module would define additional objects, extending the PW MPLS STD MIB by continuing to support configurations that operate with or without an outer tunnel.
OAM MIB Modules for MPLS TP
This section provides an overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
MIB modules for MPLS LSPs and pseudowires.
New MIB Modules for OAM for MPLS TP Two new MIB modules are identified as follows:
The BFD STD MIB defines managed objects for performing BFD operations in IP networks.
This MIB module is modeled to support the BFD protocol [RFC5880].
A new MIB module needs to be written that will be an extension to BFD STD MIB managed objects to support BFD operations on MPLS LSPs and PWs.
A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects for OAM maintenance identifiers, i.e., Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) identifiers, the MEP, and the Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Point (MIP).
Maintenance points are uniquely associated with a MEG.
Within the context of a MEG, MEPs and MIPs must be uniquely identified.
Protection Switching and Recovery MIB Modules for MPLS TP
This section provides an overview of protection switching and recovery MIB modules for MPLS LSPs and pseudowires.
New MIB Modules for MPLS Protection Switching and Recovery
Three new MIB modules are identified as follows:
Linear Protection Switching MIB module
Ring Protection Switching MIB module
Mesh Protection Switching MIB module 6.4.2.
Module A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects for linear protection switching of MPLS LSPs and pseudowires.
Module A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects for ring protection switching of MPLS LSPs and pseudowires.
Module A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects for mesh protection switching of MPLS LSPs and pseudowires.
This document applies only to scenarios where MIB modules are used to manage the MPLS TP network.
It is not the intention of this document to provide instructions or advice to implementers of management systems, management agents, or managed entities.
It is, however, useful to make some observations about how the MIB modules described above might be used to manage MPLS systems, if SNMP is used in the management interface.
For MPLS specific management options, refer to [RFC4221] Section 12 ("Management Options").
This document describes the interrelationships amongst the different MIB modules relevant to MPLS TP management and as such does not have any security implications in and of itself.
Each IETF MIB document that specifies MIB objects for MPLS TP must provide a proper Security Considerations section that explains the security aspects of those objects.
The attention of readers is particularly drawn to the security implications of making MIB objects available for create or write access through an access protocol such as SNMP.
by itself is an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is made secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is no control over who on the secure network is allowed to access the objects in the MIB module.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414], and the View based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415], is recommended.
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of each MIB module is properly configured to give access to only those objects, and to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
This document has identified areas where additional MIB modules are necessary for MPLS TP.
The new MIB modules recommended by this document will require OID assignments from IANA.
However, this document makes no specific request for IANA action.
