  - "Abstract\n   The Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) has been defined as a\n   generalization
    of the pseudowire (PW) associated control channel to\n   enable the realization
    of a control/communication channel that is\n   associated with Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) Label Switched\n   Paths (LSPs), MPLS PWs, MPLS LSP segments,
    and MPLS sections between\n   adjacent MPLS-capable devices.\n   The MPLS Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLS\n   architecture that identifies elements
    of the MPLS toolkit that may be\n   combined to build a carrier-grade packet transport
    network based on\n   MPLS packet switching technology.\n   This document describes
    how the G-ACh may be used to provide the\n   infrastructure that forms part of
    the Management Communication\n   Network (MCN) and a Signaling Communication Network
    (SCN).\n   Collectively, the MCN and SCN may be referred to as the Data\n   Communication
    Network (DCN).  This document explains how MCN and SCN\n   messages are encapsulated,
    carried on the G-ACh, and demultiplexed\n   for delivery to the management or
    signaling/routing control plane\n   components on an MPLS-TP node.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The associated channel header (ACH) is specified in [RFC4385].
    \ It is\n   a packet header format for use on pseudowires (PWs) in order to\n
    \  identify packets used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   (OAM)
    and similar functions.\n   The use of the ACH is generalized in [RFC5586] and
    can be applied on\n   any Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switching
    Path (LSP).\n   This is referred to as the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
    and is\n   intended to create a control/management communication channel\n   associated
    with the LSP that can be used to carry packets used for\n   OAM and similar functions
    (e.g., control/management plane messages).\n   The purpose of a packet carried
    on the G-ACh is indicated by the\n   value carried by the Channel Type field of
    the ACH and a registry of\n   values is maintained by IANA ([RFC4446] and [RFC4385]).
    \ The ACH is\n   referred to in this document as the G-ACh header.\n   The MPLS
    transport profile (MPLS-TP) is described in [MPLS-TP] and in\n   [RFC5654].  MPLS-TP
    is the application of MPLS to construct a packet\n   transport network.  It constitutes
    a profile of MPLS that enables\n   operational models typical in transport networks,
    which includes\n   additional OAM, survivability, and other maintenance functions
    not\n   previously supported by MPLS.\n   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) in MPLS
    networks may be operated using\n   management protocols or control plane protocols.
    \ Messaging in these\n   protocols is normally achieved using IP packets exchanged
    over IP-\n   capable interfaces.  However, some nodes in MPLS-TP networks may
    be\n   constructed without support for direct IP encapsulation on their\n   line-side
    interfaces and without access to an out-of-fiber data\n   communication network.
    \ In order that such nodes can communicate\n   using management plane or control
    plane protocols, channels must be\n   provided, and the only available mechanism
    is to use an MPLS label.\n   The G-ACh provides a suitable mechanism for this
    purpose, and this\n   document defines processes and procedures to allow the G-ACh
    to be\n   used to build a Management Communication Network (MCN) and a\n   Signaling
    Communication Network (SCN), together known as the Data\n   Communication Network
    (DCN) [G.7712].\n   It should be noted that the use of the G-ACh to provide connectivity\n
    \  for the DCN is intended for use only where the MPLS-TP network is not\n   capable
    of encapsulating or delivering native DCN messages.\n"

    - "1.1.  Requirements\n   The requirements presented in this section are based
      on those\n   communicated to the IETF by the ITU-T.\n   1. A packet-encapsulation
      mechanism must be provided to support the\n      transport of MCN and SCN packets
      over the G-ACh.\n   2. The G-ACh carrying the MCN and SCN packets shall support
      the\n      following application scenarios:\n      a. The G-ACh interconnects
      two adjacent MPLS-TP nodes (used when\n         the server layer does not provide
      a Management Communication\n         Channel (MCC) or a Signalling Communication
      Channel (SCC)).\n      b. The G-ACh is carried by an MPLS-TP tunnel that traverses\n
      \        another operator's domain (the carrier's carrier scenario).\n   3.
      The G-ACh shall provide two independent channels: an MCC to build\n      the
      MCN and an SCC to build the SCN.  The G-ACh packet header\n      shall indicate
      whether the packet is an MCC or an SCC packet in\n      order to forward it
      to the management or control plane application\n      for processing.  This
      facilitates easy demultiplexing of control\n      and management traffic from
      the DCN, and enables separate or\n      overlapping address spaces and duplicate
      protocol instances in the\n      management and control planes.\n   4. The channel-separation
      mechanism shall not preclude the use of\n      separate rate limiters and traffic-shaping
      functions for each\n      channel (MCC and SCC), ensuring that the flows do
      not exceed their\n      assigned traffic profiles.  The rate limiters and traffic
      shapers\n      are outside the scope of the MCC and SCC definitions.\n   5.
      The G-ACh that carries the MCC and SCC shall be capable of\n      carrying different
      OSI layer 3 (network layer) PDUs.  These shall\n      include IPv4, IPv6, and
      OSI PDUs.  The G-ACh header of the MCC/SCC\n      packet shall indicate which
      layer 3 PDU is contained in the\n      payload field of the packet such that
      the packet can be delivered\n      to the related layer 3 process within the
      management and control\n      plane application, respectively, for further processing.\n
      \  6. The G-ACh is not required to provide specific security mechanisms.\n      However,
      the management or control plane protocols that operate\n      over the MCC or
      SCC are required to provide adequate security\n      mechanisms in order to
      not be susceptible to security attacks.\n"

    sent on\n      the G-ACh.  The Channel Type field indicates the function of the\n
    \     ACH message and so, to send an MCC/SCC packet on the G-ACh, the\n      MCC/SCC
    message is prepended with an ACH with the Channel Type set\n      to indicate
    that the message is an MCC or SCC message.  The ACH\n      MUST NOT include the
    ACH TLV Header [RFC5586], meaning that no ACH\n      TLVs can be included in the
    message.  A two-byte Protocol\n      Identifier (PID) field indicates the protocol
    type of the payload\n      DCN message.\n       0                   1                   2

    1: G-ACh MCC/SCC Packet\n   o The Channel Type field determines whether the message
    is an MCC or\n     an SCC message.  See Section 5 for the codepoint assignments.\n
    \  o The presence of the PID field is deduced from the Channel Type\n     value
    indicating MCC or SCC.  The field contains an identifier of\n     the payload
    protocol using the PPP protocol identifiers ([RFC1661],\n     [RFC3818]).\n   When
    the G-ACh sender receives an MCC message that is to be sent over\n   the MCC,
    the sender creates the G-ACh header, sets the Channel Type\n   field to MCC, fills
    in the PID to indicate the MCC layer 3 PDU type,\n   and prepends the MCC message
    with the G-ACh header.  The same\n   procedure is applied when a control plane
    message is to be sent over\n   the SCC.  In this case, the sender sets the Channel
    Type field to\n   SCC.\n   If the G-ACh is associated with an MPLS section, the
    Generic\n   Associated Channel Label (GAL) is added to the message as defined
    in\n   [RFC5586].  The Time to Live (TTL) field MUST be set to 1, and the\n   S-bit
    of the GAL MUST be set to 1.\n   If the G-ACh is associated with an LSP, the GAL
    is added to the\n   packet and the LSP label is pushed on top of the GAL as defined
    in\n   [RFC5586].  The TTL field of the GAL MUST be set to 1, and the S-bit\n
    \  of the GAL MUST be set to 1.\n   Note that packet processing for DCN packets
    in the G-ACh is, in\n   common with all G-ACh MPLS packets, subject to the normal
    processing\n   of the Traffic Class (TC) field of the MPLS header.  This could
    be\n   used to enable prioritization of different DCN packets.\n   The DCN channel
    MUST NOT be used to transport user traffic and SHALL\n   only be used to carry
    management or control plane messages.\n   Procedures that ensure this (such as
    deep packet inspection) are\n   outside the scope of this specification.\n   When
    a receiver has received a packet on the G-ACh with the ACH\n   Channel Type set
    to MCC or SCC, it SHALL look at the PID field.  If\n   the PID value is known
    by the receiver, it delivers the MCC/SCC\n   message to the appropriate processing
    entity.  If the PID value is\n   unknown, the receiver SHALL silently discard
    the received packet, MAY\n   increment a counter that records discarded or errored
    messages, and\n   MAY log an event.\n   It must be noted that according to [RFC5586],
    a receiver MUST NOT\n   forward a GAL packet based on the GAL label as is normally
    the case\n   for MPLS packets.  If the GAL appears at the bottom of the label\n
    \  stack, it MUST be processed as described in the previous paragraph.\n   Note
    that there is no requirement for MPLS-TP devices to support IP\n   or OSI forwarding
    in the fast (forwarding) path.  Thus, if a message\n   is received on the MCC
    or SCC and is not targeted to an address of\n   the receiving MPLS-TP node, the
    packet might not be forwarded in the\n   fast path.  A node MAY apply layer 3
    forwarding procedures in the\n   slow or fast path and MAY discard or reject the
    message using the\n   layer 3 protocol if it is unable to forward it.  Thus, protocols\n
    \  making use of the DCN should make no assumptions about the forwarding\n   capabilities
    unless they are determined a priori or through the use\n   of a routing protocol.
    \ Furthermore, it is important that user data\n   (i.e., data traffic) is not
    routed through the DCN, as this would\n   potentially cause the traffic to be
    lost or delayed and might\n   significantly congest the DCN.\n"

      \ In\n   the absence of an IP-based control plane network, these PEs MUST\n
      \  first set up an LSP tunnel across the MPLS-TP network.  This tunnel\n   can
      be used both to carry the PW once it has been set up and to\n   provide a G-ACh-based

  - "3.  Applicability\n   The DCN is intended to provide connectivity between management\n
    \  stations and network nodes, and between pairs of network nodes, for\n   the
    purpose of exchanging management plane and control plane\n   messages.\n   Appendix
    A of [NM-REQ] describes how Control Channels (CCh) that are\n   the links in an
    MPLS-TP DCN can be out-of-fiber and out-of-band, in-\n   fiber and out-of-band,
    or in-band with respect to the user data\n   carried by the MPLS-TP network.  That
    appendix also explains how the\n   DCN can be constructed from a mix of different
    types of links and how\n   routing and forwarding can be used within the DCN to
    facilitate\n   multi-hop delivery of management and control plane messages.\n
    \  The G-ACh used as described in this document allows the creation of a\n   \"data
    channel associated CCh\" (type 6 in Appendix A of [NM-REQ]) and\n   an \"in-band
    CCh\" (type 7 in Appendix A of [NM-REQ]).  In the former\n   case, the G-ACh is
    associated with an MPLS-TP section.  In the latter\n   case, the G-ACh is associated
    with an MPLS-TP LSP or PW and may span\n   one or more hops in the MPLS-TP network.\n
    \  There is no need to create a CCh for every LSP between a pair of\n   MPLS-TP
    nodes.  Indeed, where the nodes are physically adjacent, the\n   G-ACh associated
    with the MPLS-TP section would normally be used.\n   Where nodes are virtually
    adjacent (that is, connected by LSP\n   tunnels), one or two of the LSPs might
    be selected to provide the CCh\n   and a back-up CCh.\n"

    it is\n   important that protocols using the DCN apply their own security.\n   Protocols
    that operate over the MCN or SCN are REQUIRED to include\n   adequate security
