- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about\n
    \  the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic\n   Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  When a PCE has stateful\n   control over LSPs,
    it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify\n   the attributes (especially
    the paths) of the LSPs.  A Path\n   Computation Client (PCC) that has set up LSPs
    under local\n   configuration may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful
    PCE.\n   There are use cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain\n   control
    of locally configured LSPs that it is aware of but have not\n   been delegated
    to the PCE.\n   This document describes an extension to the Path Computation Element\n
    \  Communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make requests for\n   such
    control.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    Extensions\n   for Stateful PCE\" [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP\n
    \  [RFC5440] to enable stateful control of Traffic Engineering Label\n   Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) between and across PCEP sessions in\n   compliance with [RFC4657].
    \ It includes mechanisms to synchronize LSP\n   state between Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, delegate\n   control of LSPs to PCEs, and allow PCEs
    to control the timing and\n   sequence of path computations within and across
    PCEP sessions.  The\n   stateful PCEP defines the following two useful network
    operations:\n   Delegation:  As per [RFC8051], an operation to grant a PCE temporary\n
    \               rights to modify a subset of LSP parameters on one or\n                more
    LSPs of a PCC.  LSPs are delegated from a PCC to a\n                PCE and are
    referred to as \"delegated\" LSPs.\n   Revocation:  As per [RFC8231], an operation
    performed by a PCC on a\n                previously delegated LSP.  Revocation
    revokes the rights\n                granted to the PCE in the delegation operation.\n
    \  For redundant stateful PCEs (Section 5.7.4 of [RFC8231]), during a\n   PCE
    failure, one of the redundant PCEs might want to request to take\n   control over
    an LSP.  The redundant PCEs may use a local policy or a\n   proprietary election
    mechanism to decide which PCE would take\n   control.  In this case, a mechanism
    is needed for a stateful PCE to\n   request control of one or more LSPs from a
    PCC so that a newly\n   elected primary PCE can request to take over control.\n
    \  In case of virtualized PCEs (vPCEs) running in virtual network\n   function
    (VNF) mode, as the computation load in the network\n   increases, a new instance
    of vPCE could be instantiated to balance\n   the current load.  The PCEs could
    use a proprietary algorithm to\n   decide which LSPs can be assigned to the new
    vPCE.  Thus, having a\n   mechanism for the PCE to request control of some LSPs
    is needed.\n   In some deployments, the operator would like to use stateful PCE
    for\n   global optimization algorithms but would still like to keep the\n   control
    of the LSP at the PCC.  In such cases, a stateful PCE could\n   request to take
    control during the global optimization and return the\n   delegation once done.\n
    \  Note that [RFC8231] specifies a mechanism for a PCC to delegate an\n   orphaned
    LSP to another PCE.  The mechanism defined in this document\n   can be used in
    conjunction with [RFC8231].  Ultimately, it is the PCC\n   that decides which
    PCE to delegate the orphaned LSP to.\n   This specification provides a simple
    extension that allows a PCE to\n   request control of one or more LSPs from any
    PCC over the stateful\n   PCEP session.  The procedures for granting and relinquishing
    control\n   of the LSPs are specified in accordance with [RFC8231] unless\n   explicitly
    set aside in this document.\n"

  - "3.  LSP Control Request Flag\n   The Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object
    is defined in\n   Section 7.2 of [RFC8231] and includes a Flags field.\n   A new
    \"LSP Control Request\" flag (30), also called the C flag, is\n   introduced in
    the SRP object.  In a PCUpd message, a PCE sets the C\n   flag to 1 to indicate
    that it wishes to gain control of LSPs.  The\n   LSPs are identified by the PLSP-ID
    in the LSP object following the\n   SRP object.  A PLSP-ID value other than 0
    and 0xFFFFF is used to\n   identify the LSP for which the PCE requests control.
    \ A PLSP-ID value\n   of 0 indicates that the PCE is requesting control of all
    LSPs\n   originating from the PCC that it wishes to delegate.  The C flag has\n
    \  no meaning in other PCEP messages that carry SRP objects and for\n   which
    the C flag MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored\n   on receipt.\n
    \  The C flag is ignored in case the R flag [RFC8281] in the SRP object\n   is
    set.\n"
  title: 3.  LSP Control Request Flag
- contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   During normal operation, a PCC that wishes to delegate the
    control of\n   an LSP sets the Delegate (D) flag (Section 7.3 of [RFC8231]) to
    1 in\n   all PCRpt messages pertaining to the LSP.  The PCE confirms the\n   delegation
    by setting the D flag to 1 in all PCUpd messages\n   pertaining to the LSP.  The
    PCC revokes the control of the LSP from\n   the PCE by setting the D flag to 0
    in PCRpt messages pertaining to\n   the LSP.  If the PCE wishes to relinquish
    the control of the LSP, it\n   sets the D flag to 0 in all PCUpd messages pertaining
    to the LSP.\n   If a PCE wishes to gain control over an LSP, it sends a PCUpd
    message\n   with the C flag set to 1 in the SRP object.  The LSP for which the\n
    \  PCE requests control is identified by the PLSP-ID in the associated\n   LSP
    object.  A PLSP-ID value of 0 indicates that the PCE wants\n   control over all
    LSPs originating from the PCC.  An implementation of\n   this feature needs to
    make sure to check for the LSP control feature\n   (C flag set to 1) before any
    check for PLSP-ID (as per [RFC8231]).\n   The D flag and C flag are mutually exclusive
    in a PCUpd message.  The\n   PCE MUST NOT send a control request for the LSP that
    is already\n   delegated to the PCE, i.e., if the D flag is set in the PCUpd\n
    \  message, then the C flag MUST NOT be set.  If a PCC receives a PCUpd\n   message
    with the D flag set in the LSP object (i.e., LSP is already\n   delegated) and
    the C flag is also set (i.e., PCE is making a control\n   request), the PCC MUST
    ignore the C flag.  A PCC can decide to\n   delegate the control of the LSP at
    its own discretion.  If the PCC\n   grants or denies the control, it sends a PCRpt
    message with the D\n   flag set to 1 and 0, respectively, in accordance with stateful
    PCEP\n   [RFC8231].  If the PCC does not grant the control, it MAY choose to\n
    \  not respond, and the PCE MAY choose to retry requesting the control,\n   preferably
    using an exponentially increasing timer.  Note that, if\n   the PCUpd message
    with the C flag set is received for a currently\n   non-delegated LSP (for which
    the PCE is requesting delegation), this\n   MUST NOT trigger the error handling
    as specified in [RFC8231] (a\n   PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation)
    and error-value 1\n   (Attempted LSP Update Request for a non-delegated LSP)).\n
    \  As per [RFC8231], a PCC cannot delegate an LSP to more than one PCE\n   at
    any time.  If a PCE requests control of an LSP that has already\n   been delegated
    by the PCC to another PCE, the PCC MAY ignore the\n   request or MAY revoke the
    delegation to the first PCE before\n   delegating it to the second.  This choice
    is a matter of local\n   policy.\n   It should be noted that a legacy implementation
    of PCC that does not\n   support this extension may receive an LSP control request:
    a PCUpd\n   message with the C flag set and the D flag unset.  The legacy\n   implementation
    would ignore the C flag and trigger the error\n   condition for the D flag, as
    specified in [RFC8231] (i.e., a PCErr\n   with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation)
    and error-value 1 (Attempted\n   LSP Update Request for a non-delegated LSP)).
    \ Further, in case of a\n   PLSP-ID value of 0, the error condition, as specified
    in [RFC8231],\n   (i.e., a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and error-value\n
    \  3 (Attempted LSP Update Request for an LSP identified by an unknown\n   PLSP-ID))
    would be triggered.\n   [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance, and teardown
    of PCE-\n   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.  It also specifies how
    a\n   PCE may obtain control over an orphaned LSP that was PCE-initiated.\n   A
    PCE implementation can apply the mechanism described in this\n   document in conjunction
    with those in [RFC8281].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations listed in [RFC8231]
    and [RFC8281] apply\n   to this document as well.  However, this document also
    introduces a\n   new attack vector.  An attacker may flood the PCC with requests
    to\n   delegate all of its LSPs at a rate that exceeds the PCC's ability to\n
    \  process them, either by spoofing messages or by compromising the PCE\n   itself.
    \ The PCC SHOULD be configured with a threshold rate for the\n   delegation requests
    received from the PCE.  If the threshold is\n   reached, it is RECOMMENDED to
    log the issue.\n   A PCC is the ultimate arbiter of delegation.  As per [RFC8231],
    a\n   local policy at the PCC is used to influence the delegation.  A PCC\n   can
    also revoke the delegation at any time.  A PCC need not blindly\n   trust the
    control requests and SHOULD take local policy and other\n   factors into consideration
    before honoring the request.\n   Note that a PCE may not be sure if a PCC supports
    this feature.  A\n   PCE would try sending a control request to a 'legacy' PCC
    that would\n   in turn respond with an error, as described in Section 4.  So,
    a PCE\n   would learn this fact only when it wants to take control over an LSP.\n
    \  A PCE might also be susceptible to downgrade attacks by falsifying\n   the
    error condition.\n   As per [RFC8231], it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions
    only\n   be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs and\n
    \  PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using Transport\n   Layer
    Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best\n   current practices
    in BCP 195 [RFC7525] (unless explicitly excluded in\n   [RFC8253]).\n"
