    Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it defines a set of MIB objects to manage Power\n   Ethernet
    [IEEE-802.3af] Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST

    as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   The emergence of IP telephony as an application that allows
    voice\n   applications to be run over the same infrastructure as data\n   applications
    has led to the emergence of Ethernet IP phones, which\n   have similar functions
    and characteristics as traditional phones.\n   Powering the phone with the same
    cable used for signal transfer is\n   one of the functions that are being taken
    as granted.  The IEEE 802.3\n   Working Group has initiated standardization on
    this subject,\n   currently known as the IEEE 802.3af work [IEEE-802.3af].\n   The
    IEEE 802.3af WG did not define a full management interface, but\n   only the hardware
    registers that will allow for management interfaces\n   to be built for a powered
    Ethernet device.  The MIB module defined in\n   this document extends the Ethernet-like
    Interfaces MIB [RFC3635] with\n   the management objects required for the management
    of the powered\n   Ethernet devices and ports.\n   The following abbreviations
    are defined in [IEEE-802.3af] and will be\n   used with the same significance
    in this document:\n   PSE - Power Sourcing Equipment;\n   PD - Powered Device\n"
  title: 3.  Overview
- contents:
  - "4.  MIB Structure\n   These MIB objects are categorized into three MIB groups.\n
    \  The pethPsePortTable defines the objects used for configuring and\n   describing
    the status of ports on a PSE device.  Examples of PSE\n   devices are Ethernet
    switches that support power Ethernet and mid-\n   span boxes.\n   The pethMainPseObjects
    MIB group defines the management objects for a\n   managed main power source in
    a PSE device.  Ethernet switches are one\n   example of boxes that would support
    these objects.\n   The pethNotificationControlTable includes objects that control
    the\n   transmission of notifications from the agent to a management\n   application.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may
    be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n
    \  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection
    can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   Setting the following object
    to incorrect values can result in\n   improper operation of the PSE, including
    the possibility that the PD\n   does not receive power from the PSE port:\n      pethPsePortAdminEnable\n
    \     pethPsePortPowerPairs\n      pethPsePortPowerPriority\n      pethPsePortType\n
    \  Setting the following objects to incorrect values can result in an\n   excessive
    number of traps being sent to network management stations:\n      pethMainPseUsageThreshold\n
    \     pethNotificationControlEnable\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB
    module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be
    considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  These are:\n
    \     pethPsePortPowerPairsControlAbility\n      pethPsePortPowerPriority\n      pethPsePortPowerClassifications\n
    \  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to\n   these
    objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when sending\n   them over the
    network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n
    \  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even
    then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided
    by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support
    for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.
    \ Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic
    security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the
    SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured
    to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n
    \  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
