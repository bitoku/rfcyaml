Abstract This document provides definitions of models and manageable objects for printing environments.
The objects included in this MIB apply to physical, as well as logical entities within a printing device.
This document obsoletes RFC 1759.
The management of producing a printed document, in any computer environment, is a complex subject.
Basically, the task can be divided into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing and the management of the printer.
Printing encompasses the entire process of producing a printed document from generation of the file to be printed, selection of a printer, choosing printing properties, routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling, and final printing including notifying the user.
Most of the printing process is outside the scope of the model presented here; only the management of the printer is covered.
A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input source, produces marks on that media according to some page description or page control language and puts the result in some output destination, possibly with finishing applied.
Printers are complex devices that consume supplies, produce waste and may have mechanical problems.
In the management of the physical device the description, status and alert information concerning the printer and its various subparts has to be made available to the management application so that it can be reported to the end user, key operators for the replenishment of supplies or the repair or maintenance of the device.
The information needed in the management of the physical printer and the management of a printing job overlap highly and many of the tasks in each management area require the same or similar information.
Categories of Printer Information Information about printers is classified into three basic categories: descriptions, status and alerts.
Descriptions Descriptions convey information about the configuration and capabilities of the printer and its various sub units.
This information is largely static information and does not generally change during the operation of the system but may change as the printer is repaired, reconfigured or upgraded.
The descriptions are one part of the visible state of the printer where state means the condition of being of the printer at any point in time.
Status Status is the information regarding the current operating state of the printer and its various sub units.
As an example of the use of status, a management application must be able to determine if the various sub units are ready to print or are in some state that prevents printing or may prevent printing in the future.
An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the printer.
An event is a change in the state of the printer.
Some of those state changes are of interest to a management application and are therefore reportable.
Typically, these are the events that affect the printer's ability to print.
Alerts usually occur asynchronously to the operation of the computer system(s) to which the printer is attached.
For convenience below, "alert" will be used for both the event caused by a change in the printer's state and for the representation of that event.
Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and non  critical.
A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry into a state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not continue until the condition that caused the critical alert is eliminated. "
Out of paper", "toner empty" and "output bin full" are examples of critical alerts.
Non critical alerts are triggered by those events that enter a state in which printing is not stopped.
Such a non  critical state may, at some future time, lead to a state in which printing may be stopped.
Examples of these kinds of non critical alerts are "input media low", "toner low" and "output bin nearly full".
Or, a non critical alert may simply provide information, such as signaling a configuration changed in the printer.
Description, status and alert information about the printer can be thought of as a database describing the printer.
The management application for a printer will want to view the printer data base differently depending on how and for what purposes the information in the database is needed.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Compliant implementations must follow this specification.
In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an abstract model of the printer is needed to represent the sub units from which the printer is composed.
A printer can be described as consisting of 13 types of sub units.
It is important to note that the sub units of a printer do not necessarily relate directly to any physically identifiable mechanism.
Sub units can also be a set of definable logical processes, such as interpreters for page description languages or command processors that set various operating modes of the printer.
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the printer and its basic 13 sub  units.

Overview of the Printer Model
The model has three basic parts: (1)
the flow of a print file into an interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the flow of media through the marker and (3)
the auxiliary sub units that control and facilitate the two prior flows.
The flow of the print data comes through a physical connection on which some form of transport protocol stack is running.
The data provided by the transport protocol (interface) appears on a channel, which is the input to an interpreter.
The interpreter converts the print data into a form suitable for marking on the media.
The media resides in Input sub units from which the media is selected and then transported via a Media Path first to a Marking sub unit and then onto an Output sub unit with (optionally) some finishing operations being performed.
The auxiliary sub units facilitate control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator panel, reporting of alerts and the adaptation of the printer to various natural languages and characters sets.
All the software sub units run on the System Controller that represents the processor, memory and storage systems of the Printer.
Each of the sub units is discussed in more detail below.
All of the sub units other than the Alerts report only state information, either a description or a status.
The Alerts sub unit reports event information.
A printer is composed of 13 types of sub units, called groups.
The following sections describe the different types of sub units.
The general printer sub unit is responsible for the overall control and status of the printer.
There is exactly one general printer sub  unit in a printer.
The General Printer Group in the model represents the general printer sub unit.
In addition to the providing the status of the whole printer and allowing the printer to be reset, this Group provides information on the status of the packaging of the printer, in particular, the covers.
The general printer sub unit is usually implemented on the system controller.
The localization portion of the general printer sub unit is responsible for identifying the natural language, country, and character set in which certain character strings are expressed in this MIB.
Character sets are identified in this MIB using the IANACharset textual convention imported from the IANA Character Set MIB [CHARMIB].
There may be one or more localizations supported per printer.
The available localizations are specified in the Localization table.
Localization SHOULD only be performed on string objects which are named 'xxxDescription' (sub unit descriptions) or 'prtConsoleDisplayBufferText' (local console text).
The agent SHALL return all other character strings in coded character sets in which code positions 0 127 (decimal) are US ASCII [ASCII].
The agent SHOULD return all other character strings in the UTF 8 [RFC3629] transform of ISO 10646 [ISO10646], to conform with the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
Control codes (code positions 0 31 and 127 decimal) SHALL NOT be used unless specifically required in the DESCRIPTION of an object.
The character set portion of the general printer Localization table is responsible for identifying the possible character sets for the operator console, and network management requests for display objects.
There may be one or more character sets per printer.
Default coded character sets for interpreter unit and output octets are described in the interpreter sub unit by prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetOut.
These input/output character sets may be overridden by commands in the interpreter language itself.
Inputs Input sub units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked on into the printer.
A printer contains one or more input sub units.
The Input Group in the model represents these.
The model does not distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report when a removable tray has been removed.
There are as many input sub units as there are distinctly selectable input "addresses".
For example, if one tray has both a manual and auto feeding option, then this is two input sub units if these two sources can be (must be) separately selected.
However, the above would be considered one input sub unit if putting a sheet in the manual feed slot overrides feeding from the contents of the tray.
In the second case there is no way to separately select or address the manual feed slot.
An input sub unit can hold one or more instances of the media on which marking is to be done.
Typically, there is a large set of possible media that can be associated with an input.
The Media Group is an extension of the Input Group, which represents media in an input sub unit.
The Media Group only describes the current contents of each input and not the possible content of the input sub unit.
Outputs Output sub units are mechanisms that receive media that has been marked on.
The Output Group in the model represents the one or more output mechanisms contained by a printer.
The model does not distinguish fixed output bins from removable output bins, except to report when a removable bin has been removed.
There are as many output sub units as there are distinctly selectable output "addresses".
Output sub units can be addressed in two different ways: (1) as a set of "mailboxes" which are addressed by a specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or a bin name, or (2) as a set of "slots" into which multiple copies are collated.
Sometimes both modes of using the output sub units can be used on the same printer.
All that is important from the viewpoint of the model is that the output units can be separately selected.
A finisher is a sub unit that performs some operations on the media other than marking.
The Finisher Group in the model represents the finisher sub units.
Some examples of finishing processes are stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.
Finishing processes may have supplies associated with the process.
Stapling, binding, and punching are examples of processes that have supplies.
A printer may have more than one finishing sub unit and each finishing sub unit may be associated with one or more output sub  units.
Finishers are described in the companion Finisher MIB [RFC3806].
The model does not specify the exact interaction and sequencing between an output device and its associated finisher.
It depends on the type of finishing process and the exact implementation of the printer system.
This standard allows for the logical association of a finishing process with an output device but does not put any restrictions on the exact sequence or interaction with the associated output device.
The output and finisher sub units may or may not be separate identifiable physical mechanisms depending on the exact implementation of a printer.
In addition, a single output device may be associated with multiple finishing sub units and a single finishing sub unit may be associated with multiple output devices.
Markers A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print media.
The Marker Group in the model represents the marker sub units and their associated supplies.
A printer can contain one or more marking mechanisms.
Some examples of multiple marker sub units are a printer with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an image setter that can output to both a proofing device and final film.
Each marking device can have its own set of characteristics associated with it, such as marking technology and resolution.
In this model the marker sub unit is viewed as very generalized and encompasses all aspects of a marking process.
For example, in a xerographic process, the marking process as well as the fusing process would be included in the generalized concept of the marker.
With the generalized concept of a marking process, the concept of multiple marking supplies associated with a single marking sub unit results.
For example, in the xerographic process, there is not only a supply of toner, but there can also be other supplies such as a fuser supply (e.g., fuser oil) that can be consumed and replaced separately.
In addition there can be multiple supplies of toner for a single marker device, as in a color process.
The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer that move the media through the printer and connect all other media related sub  units:
inputs, outputs, markers and finishers.
A printer contains one or more media paths.
The Media Path Group in the model represents these.
The Media Path group has some objects that apply to all paths plus a table of the separate media paths.
In general, the design of the media paths determines the maximum speed of the printer as well as the maximum media size that the printer can handle.
Media paths are complex mechanisms and can contain many different identifiable sub mechanisms such as media movement devices, media buffers, duplex units and interlocks.
Not all of the various sub mechanisms reside on every media path.
For example, one media path may provide printing only on one surface of the media (a simplex path) and another media path may have a sub  mechanism that turns the media over and feeds it a second time through the marker sub unit (a duplex path).
The duplex path may even have a buffer sub mechanism that allows multiple copies of the obverse side to be held before the reverse side of all the copies is marked.
The System Controller is the sub unit upon which the software components of the Printer run.
The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] represents the System Controller in the model.
The Host Resources MIB allows for the specification of the processor(s), memory, disk storage, file system and other underlying sub mechanisms of the printer.
The controller can range from simple single processor systems to multiprocessor systems.
In addition, controllers can have a full range of resources such as hard disks.
The printer is modeled to have one system controller even though it may have more than one processor and multiple other resources associated with it.
An interface is the communications port and associated protocols that are responsible for the transport of data to the printer.
A printer has one or more interface sub units.
The interfaces are represented by the Interfaces Group of MIB II [RFC1213], [RFC2863].
Some examples of interfaces are serial ports (with little or no protocol) and Ethernet ports on which one might run Internet IP, Novell IPX, etc.
The print job delivery channel sub units identify the independent sources of print data (here print data is the information that is used to construct printed pages and may have both data and control aspects).
A printer may have one or more channels.
The channel sub  units are represented by the Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the Model.
The electronic path typically identifies each channel and service protocol used to deliver print data to the printer.
A channel sub unit may be independently enabled (allowing print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of print data).
It has a current Control Language that can be used to specify which interpreter is to be used for the print data and to query and change environment variables used by the interpreters (and SNMP).
There is also a default interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is not explicitly specified using the Control Language.
Print Job Delivery Channel sub units can, and usually are, based on an underlying interface.
The interpreter sub units are responsible for the conversion of a description of intended print instances into images that are to be marked on the media.
A printer may have one or more interpreters.
The Interpreter Group in the Model represents the interpreter sub  units.
Each interpreter is generally implemented with software running on the System Controller sub unit.
The Interpreter Table has one entry per interpreter where the interpreters include both Page Description Language (PDL) Interpreters and Control Language Interpreters.
Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator console that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.
The console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as complicated as full screen displays and keyboards.
There can be at most one such console.
The Console Group in the model represents this console sub unit.
Although most of the information displayed there is also available in the state of the printer as represented by the various Groups, it is useful to be able to query and modify the operator console remotely.
For example, a management application might like to display to its user the current message on the operator console of the remote printer or the management application user might like to modify the current message on the operators console of the remote printer.
As another example, one might have a remote application that puts up a pseudo console on a workstation screen.
Since the rules by which the printer state is mapped onto the console and vice versa are not standardized, it is not possible to reproduce the console state or the action of console buttons and menus.
Therefore, the Console Group provides access to the console.
The operator console is usually implemented on the system controller with additional hardware for input and display.
The alert sub unit is responsible for detecting reportable events, making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if the event is a critical event, initiating a trap.
The exception to this rule is when the "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" trap is generated.
The alert sub unit is represented by the Alerts Group and, in particular, the Alert Table.
This table contains information on the severity, sub  unit, and detailed location within the sub unit, alert code and description of each alert that is currently active within the printer.
Each reportable event causes an entry to be made in the Alert Table.
Status and Alerts Summary information about the state of the printer is reported at three separate levels: (1)
The status of the printer as a whole is reported in the Host Resources MIB, (2)
The status of various sub  units is reported in the principle table of the Group that represents the sub unit, and (3)
Alert codes are reported in the Alert Table.
Overall Printer Status Of the many states a printer can be in
, certain states are more "interesting" because of the distinct actions they are likely to provoke in the administrator.
These states may be applied to the printer as a whole, or to a particular sub unit of the printer.
These named states are: Non Critical Alert Active
For the printer this means that one or more sub units have a non critical alert active.
For a sub unit, this means that the sub unit has a non critical alert active.
For the printer this means that one or more sub units have a critical alert active.
For a sub unit, this means that the sub unit has a critical alert active.
The printer or sub unit is unavailable for use (this is the same as "broken" or "down" in other terminology).
A trained service person is typically necessary to make it available.
Moving on line or off line
The printer is either off line, in the process of moving off line or moving back on line.
For example, on printers with motorized hoppers, reloading paper involves a transition to off line to open the paper bin, filling the hopper and, finally, a transition back to on line as the paper bin is repositioned for printing.
The printer or sub unit is not immediately available but can accept new instructions.
Available The printer or subunit is functioning normally.
Idle The printer or subunit is immediately available.
Active The printer or subunit is performing its primary function.
Busy The printer or subunit is performing a function (not necessarily its primary function) and is not immediately available for its primary function.
The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] provides three status objects that can be used to describe the status of a printer:
(1) hrDeviceStatus in the entry in the hrDeviceTable; (2) hrPrinterStatus in the hrPrinterTable; and (3) hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the hrPrinterTable.
These objects describe many of the states that a printer can be in.
The following table shows how the values of the three printer related objects in the Host Resources MIB relate to the states named above:
These named states are only a subset of the possible states they are not an exhaustive list of the possible states.
Nevertheless, several things should be noted.
When using these states, it is not possible to detect when both critical and non critical alerts are pending if both are pending, the Critical Alert Active state will prevail.
In addition, a printer in the Standby state will be represented in the Host Resources MIB with a device status of running(2) and a printer status of other(1), a set of states that don't uniquely distinguish this important printer state.
Detailed status per sub unit is reported in the sub unit status fields.
Host Resources MIB Printer Status For completeness, the definitions of the Printer Status objects of the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] are given below: hrDeviceStatus OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX  INTEGER { unknown(1), running(2), warning(3), testing(4), down(5) } ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION "The current operational state of the device described by this row of the table.
A value unknown(1) indicates that the current state of the device is unknown.
running(2) indicates that the device is up and running and that no unusual error conditions are known.
The warning(3) state indicates that agent has been informed of an unusual error condition by the operational software (e.g., a disk device driver) but that the device is still 'operational'.
An example would be high number of soft errors on a disk.
A value of testing(4), indicates that the device is not available for use because it is in the testing state.
The state of down(5) is used only when the agent has been informed that the device is not available for any use."
read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The current status of this printer device.
When in the idle(3), printing(4), or
warmup(5) state, the corresponding hrDeviceStatus should be running(2) or warning(3).
When in the unknown(2) state, the corresponding hrDeviceStatus should be unknown(1).
"This object represents any error conditions detected by the printer.
13 overduePreventMaint 14 Bit # 15 is not assigned.
If multiple conditions are currently detected and the hrDeviceStatus would not otherwise be unknown(1) or testing(4), the hrDeviceStatus shall correspond to the worst state of those indicated, where down(5) is worse than warning(3), which is worse than running(2).
Bits are numbered starting with the most significant bit of the first byte being bit 0, the least significant bit of the first byte being bit 7, the most significant bit of the second byte being bit 8, and so on.
A one bit encodes that the condition was detected, while a zero bit encodes that the condition was not detected.
This object is useful for alerting an operator to specific warning or error conditions that may occur, especially those requiring human intervention."
Sub unit Status Sub unit status is reported in the entries of the principle table in the Group that represents the sub unit.
For sub units that report a status, there is a status column in the table and
the value of this column is always an integer formed in the following way.
The PrtSubUnitStatusTC is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct values, Availability, Non Critical, Critical, On line, and Transitioning.
For example, an input (tray) that jammed on the next to the last page may show a status of 27 (unavailable because broken (3)   a critical state (16), jammed, and a noncritical state (8), low paper).
The Alert Group consists of a single table in which all active alerts are represented.
This section provides an overview of the table and a description of how it is managed.
The basic content of the alert table is the severity (critical or non critical) of the alert, the Group and entry where a state change caused the alert, additional information about the alert (a more detailed location, an alert code, and a description), and an indication of the level of training needed to service the alert.
The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant, for example that an event has occurred, and some information that is only represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional information.
A single table was used because a single entry in a group could cause more than one alert, for example paper jams in more than one place in a media path.
Associating the additional information with the entry in the affected group would only allow one report where associating the additional information with the alert makes multiple reports possible.
Every time an alert occurs in the printer, the printer makes one or more entries into the Alert Table.
The printer determines if an event is to be classified as critical or non critical.
If the severity of the Alert is "critical", the printer sends a trap or event notification to the host indicating that the table has changed.
Whether or not a trap is sent, the management application is expected to poll the printer on a regular basis and to read and parse the table to determine what conditions have changed, in order to provide reliable information to the management application user.
The alert tables are sparsely populated tables.
This means the tables will only contain entries of the alerts that are currently active and the number of rows, or entries in the table will be dynamic.
More than one event can be added or removed from the event tables at a time depending on the implementation of the printer.
There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts: binary change events and unary change events.
Binary change events come in pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing edge event.
The leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one exit; for example, going from running to stopped with a paper jam.
The only exit from this state is fixing the paper jam and it is clear when that is accomplished.
The trailing edge event exits the state that was entered by the leading edge event.
In the example above, fixing the paper jam is the trailing edge event.
It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events in the Alert Table.
Only the leading edge event makes an entry in the alert table.
This entry persists in the Alert Table until the trailing edge event occurs at which point this event is signaled by the removal of the leading edge event entry in the Alert Table.
That is, a trailing edge event does not create an entry; it removes the corresponding leading edge event.
Removing the leading edge entry may cause the unary change event "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" to be added to the table.
With binary change events it is possible to compute the maximum number that can occur at the same time and construct an Alert Table that would hold that many events.
There would be no possibility of table overflow and no information about outstanding events would be lost.
Unfortunately, there are some events that are not binary changes.
This other category of event, the unary change event, is illustrated by the configuration change event.
With this kind of event the state of the machine has changed, but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the state that was left and from which no return is necessary.
For example, an operator may change the paper that is in the primary input source from letter to legal.
At some time in the future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it might be changed to executive instead.
This is where the problem occurs.
It is not obvious how long to keep unary change event entries in the Alert Table.
If they were never removed, the Alert Table would continue to grow indefinitely.
The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the management of the alert table, especially in the face of combinations of binary and unary alerts that would overflow the storage capacity of the table.
When the table is full and new alerts need to be added, an old alert to be deleted should be chosen using the following rules:
Find a non critical unary alert and delete it.
If there are multiple non critical unary alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one is chosen.
If there are no non critical unary alerts, then, 2.
Find a non critical binary alert and delete it.
If there are multiple non critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one is chosen.
If there are no non critical binary alerts, then, 3.
Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.
If there are multiple critical alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one be chosen.
Agent implementers are encouraged to provide at least enough storage space for the maximum number of critical alerts that could occur simultaneously.
Note that all critical alerts are binary.
In the event that a critical binary alert has been deleted out of the alert table; when space allows and the alert condition still exists, the alert should be re added to the alert table even if there was no subsequent transition into the associated state.
It is recommended that this be done for non critical binary alerts as well.
Note that the new alert entry will not have the same index as the original entry that was moved out of the table.
Note that because the Alert Index is a monotonically increasing integer there will be gaps in the values in the table when an alert is deleted.
The management application may want to re acquire the Printer state and check for state changes that it did not observe in the Alert Table if such gaps are detected.
Some objects in the printer MIB reflect the existence or amount of a given resource within the printer.
Some examples of such resources are the size and number of sheets in a paper tray or the existence of certain output options.
Some printers have automatic sensors for these resources.
Most printers lack sensors for every property of every resource.
The management application is allowed to write into objects that hold descriptive or existence values for printers that cannot sense these values.
The ability to change the value of a read  write object may depend on the implementation of the agent.
Many objects in the MIB are given read write access, but a printer implementation might only permit a management application to change the value if the printer can not sense the value itself.
Note that even though some objects explicitly state the behavior of conditional ability to change values, any read write object may act this way.
Generally, an object is given read write access in the Printer MIB specification if: 1.
The object involves installation of a resource that some printers cannot themselves detect.
Therefore, external means are needed to inform the printer of the installation.
(Here external means include using the operator console, or remote management application) and 2.
The printer will behave differently if the installation of the resource is reported than the printer would if the installation were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used as a place to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a "sticky note".
Another way of saying this is that the printer believes that information given it and acts as if the information were true.
For example, on a printer that cannot sense the size, if one paper size is loaded, but another size is set into the paper size object, then the printer will use the size that was set as its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.
The printer may get hints that it may not know about the existence or properties of certain resources.
For example, a paper tray may be removed and re inserted.
When this removal and insertion happens, the printer may either assume that a property, such as the size of paper in the tray, has not changed or the printer may change the value of the associated object to "unknown", as might be done for the amount of paper in the tray.
As long as the printer acts according to the value in  the object either strategy is acceptable.
It is an implementation specific matter as to whether or not MIB object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.
It is particularly important that the values of the prtMarkerLifeCount object persist throughout the lifetime of the printer.
Therefore, if the value of any MIB object persists across power cycles, then the prtMarkerLifeCount object must also persist.
Enumerations Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use with one or more objects.
Commonly used enumeration sets are assigned a symbolic data type name (textual convention), rather than being specified in the SYNTAX clause of each individual object definition.
Textual conventions defined in the Printer MIB or the companion IANA Printer MIB are extensible by RFC publication or by Designated Expert Review (see the 'IANA Considerations' section of this Printer MIB and the DESCRIPTION clause in MODULE IDENTITY of IANA Printer MIB).
All of these textual conventions are: a) used more than once in the Printer MIB itself; or b) imported and used in the companion Finisher MIB; or c) imported and used in any other, including vendor private, MIB modules.
The Printer MIB has also defined the following special values for use with objects of the syntax "Integer32" to define conditions that are outside of the normal numeric range:  other( 1), unknown( 2), and partial( 3).
The 'partial' value means that there is some supply remaining (but the amount is indeterminate) or there is some capacity remaining (but the amount is indeterminate).
The Integer32 range field indicates in which objects these special values are valid.
The Printer MIB and the companion IANA Printer MIB each defines one category of textual convention, according to the process employed to control the addition of new enumerations:
All of the legal values are defined in the Printer MIB.
Additional enumerated values require the publication of a new Printer MIB.
All of the legal values are registered in the IANA Printer MIB.
Additional enumerated values require a Designated Expert Review defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC2434].
The Designated Expert will be selected by the IETF Area Director(s) of the Applications Area.
Groups from other MIB Specifications
This section identifies the groups from other MIBs that shall be supported to supplement and complete a printer MIB implementation.
The section also describes some of the less obvious characteristics of the Printer MIB structure that are related to the inclusion of these other MIB groups.
All objects in the system group of MIB II [RFC1213] shall be implemented; however, as described in paragraph 2.4, implementers should carefully consider what constitutes the "system".
The storage and device groups of the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] shall be implemented to support the printer(s) system controller, and any supporting devices.
If deemed appropriate by the implementer, other groups of the Host Resources MIB (System, Running Software, Running Software Performance, and Installed Software) may be implemented.
Because of the structure of the Host Resources MIB, the devices constituting the system controller are at the same level as the printer.
Interface Group objects All objects in the Interfaces Group of MIB II [RFC1213] shall be implemented for all print information interfaces to the printer, including non network interfaces.
The interfaces group of RFC 1213
[RFC1213] contains only a partial list of interface types that can be specified in the "ifType" object.
For a complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/iana.mib/ianaiftype.mib" 4.
This document supersedes and replaces RFC 1759.
However, a compliant implementation of RFC 1759 is also compliant with this document.
The following changes to RFC 1759 are included:  (See the printmib REVISION/DESCRIPTION clause for additional details of changes.)
Minor editorial corrections and changes.
Updated the cover page and added the "SNMP Management Framework" boilerplate to section 1.
Updated figure 2 to use MIB names instead of RFC numbers.
Updated Coded Character Set description and IANA registration process.
Change hrPrinterDetectedErrorState "coverOpen" (bit 4) to "doorOpen" per RFC 2790.
Added second octet of hrPrinterDetectedErrorState as partially described and assigned in the updated Host Resources MIB (RFC 2790).
Remove fixed association of hrDeviceStatus (warning/down) from hrPrinterDetetctedErrorState per RFC 2790.
Instead of showing bit 15 as "not assigned" in the quote from RFC 2790 in the hrPrinterDetectedErrorState object, removed that from the tabular form and added it as a sentence, because the RFC doesn't show bit 15 in the tabular form.
Added prtChannelInformation to the Channel Group textual  conventions on a per channel basis to clarify the channel description and enhance interoperability.
Deprecated some obsolete channel types.
Extended the Alert Table and
PrtMarkerSuppliesSupplyUnit textual conventions to include values from the Finisher MIB.
Clarified alerts based on unary vs. binary change events.
Added (optional) unary change event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801).
Establish a convention for contact information for prtGeneralCurrentOperator and prtGeneralServicePerson.
Added the Input Switching Group  Added prtAlertCriticalEvents
Updated PrtAlertCode enums including generic alert codes.
Created five OBJECT GROUPs (prtAuxilliarySheetGroup, prtInputSwitchingGroup, prtGeneralV2Group, prtAlertTableV2Group, prtChannelV2Group).
Added the nine new objects to them (prtAuxiliarySheetStartupPage, prtAuxiliarySheetBannerPage, prtGeneralPrinterName, prtGeneralSerialNumber, prtAlertCriticalEvents, prtAlertAllEvents, prtInputMediaLoadTimeout, prtInputNextIndex, prtChannelInformation).
Created one new NOTIFICATION GROUP (prtAlertTrapGroup) to contain printerV2Alert.
Included the new OBJECT GROUPs and the NOTIFICATION GROUP in prtMIBCompliance, all in GROUP (not MANDATORY GROUP) clauses.
The nine new objects are optional, i.e., this document is backward compatible with RFC 1759.
Deprecated the use of alert codes doorOpen(501) and doorClosed(502), in favor of coverOpened(3) and coverClosed(4).
Added the PrtConsoleDisableTC and PrtMarkerAddressabilityUnitTC textual conventions, and changed the PrtConsoleDisable and PrtMarkerAddressabilityUnit objects' syntax to use those TCs, and changed the PrtGeneralEntry and PrtMarkerColorantEntry SEQUENCEs to reflect the new syntax.
"PrtLocalizedDescriptionStringTC" and "PrtConsoleDescriptionStringTC" and updated several objects to use them.
Changed most enumerations to textual conventions and therefore changed the SYNTAX of many objects from RFC 1759 to specify the appropriate textual conventions.
Changed the TC names "MediaUnit" to "PrtMediaUnitTC", "CapacityUnit" to "PrtCapacityUnitTC", and "SubUnitStatus" to "PrtSubUnitStatusTC
All objects with a MAX ACCESS of read write now have a MIN ACCESS of read only.
Added 'IANA Considerations' and 'Internationalization Considerations' as top level sections, per IETF guidelines.
Updated Security and Copyright sections.
Updated references and split into Normative and Informative groups.

any potential conflicts with the conformance section.
Added text to empty description clauses.
(prtStorageRefTable, prtDeviceRefTable, prtMarkerTable, prtMediaPathTable, prtChannelTable, prtInterpreterTable, prtConsoleLightTable, and prtAlertTable)
Added "DEFVAL { unknown }" to prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetOut.
Added ranges to all objects with a syntax of Integer32.
Revised the description clause for prtAlertGroupIndex.
Added additional text to the description clause for prtMediaPathEntry, prtChannelEntry, prtInterpreterEntry, and
Added text to section 2.4 to explain the usage of textual conventions in this MIB and others.
Also added a note defining the common usage of the enumerations 'other( 1)' and 'unknown( 2)'  Changed range of prtStorageRefSeqNumber, prtDeviceRefSeqNumber, and prtConsoleLightIndex from (0..65535) to (1..65535) since index values cannot be zero.
The PWG Standard for Standardized Media Names is now recommended for the objects prtInputMediaName, prtInputMediaColor, and prtInputMediaType.

The printer will break alerts into these different training levels.
It is the responsibility of a management application in the system to determine how a particular alert is handled and how and to whom that alert is routed.
The following are the four training levels of alerts: Field Service Alerts that typically require advanced training and technical knowledge of the printer and its subunits.
An example of a technical person would be a manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person formally trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.
Trained Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate knowledge of the printer and its subunits.
A typical example of such an alert is replacing a toner cartridge.
A typical example of such an alert is reloading paper trays or emptying output bins on a low end printer.

This TC was extracted from prtAlertCode in RFC 1759.
The code that describes the type of alert for this entry in the table.
Binary change event alerts describe states of the subunit while unary change event alerts describe a single event.
The same alert code can be used for a binary change event or a unary change event, depending on implementation.
Also, the same alert code can be used to indicate a critical or non critical (warning) alert, depending on implementation.
The value of prtAlertSeverityLevel specifies binary vs. unary and critical vs. non critical for each event for the implementation.
While there are some specific codes for many subunits, the generic codes should be used for most subunit alerts.
The network management station can then query the subunit specified by prtAlertGroup to determine further subunit status and other subunit information.
An agent shall not add two entries to the alert table for the same event, one containing a generic event code and the other containing a specific event code; the agent shall add only one entry in the alert table for each event; either generic (preferred) or specific, not both.
Implementation of the unary change event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) is optional.
When implemented, this alert code shall indicate to network management stations that the trailing edge of a binary change event has occurred and the corresponding alert entry has been removed from the alert table.
As with all events, the alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) alert shall be placed at the end of the alert table.
Such an alert table entry shall specify the following information:
the value of sysUpTime at the time of the removal of the binary change event from the alert table.
Optionally, the agent may generate a trap coincident with removing the binary change event and placing the unary change event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) in the alert table.
For such a trap, the prtAlertIndex sent with the above trap parameters
shall be the index of the alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEvent row that was added to the prtAlertTable; not the index of the row that was removed from the prtAlertTable."
The following generic codes are common to   multiple groups.

} prtGeneralConfigChanges OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"Counts configuration changes within the printer.
A configuration change is defined to be an action that results in a change to any MIB object other than those that reflect status or level, or those that act as counters or gauges.
In addition, any action that results in a row being added or deleted from any table in the Printer MIB is considered a configuration change.
Such changes will often affect the capability of the printer to service certain types of print jobs.
Management applications may cache infrequently changed configuration information about sub units within the printer.
This object should be incremented whenever the agent wishes to notify management applications that any cached configuration information for this device is to be considered 'stale'.
At this point, the management application should flush any configuration information cached about this device and fetch new configuration information.
The following are examples of actions that would cause the prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented:
Changing the media in a sensing input tray Changing the value of prtInputMediaType Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load additional paper or when the level of an input device changes.
The above description has been modified from RFC 1759 for clarification."

Note that this object does not apply to localized strings in the prtConsole group or to any object that is not explicitly identified as being localized according to prtGeneralCurrentLocalization.
When an object's 'charset' is controlled by the value of prtGeneralCurrentLocalization, it MUST specify PrtLocalizedDescriptionStringTC as its syntax.

Here, print data is the term used for the information   that is used to construct printed pages and may have both data   and control aspects.
The output of a channel is in a form   suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a   stream.
A channel may be independently enabled (allowing   print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of   print data).
A printer may have one or more channels.
It might include some level of   decompression or decoding of print stream data.
All of these aspects are hidden in the channel   abstraction.
There are many kinds of print job delivery channels; some of   which are based on networks and others which are not.
For   example, a channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection;
it can be a service, such as the UNIX Line Printer Daemon   (LPD), offering services over a network connection; or   it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disk with
the print data is inserted.
Each print job delivery channel is   identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol   used to deliver print data to a print data interpreter.
It is easy to note that this is a mixed bag.
There are   some physical connections over which no (or very meager)
protocols are run (e.g., the serial or old parallel ports)
and there are services which often have elaborate   protocols that run over a number of protocol stacks.
the end, what is important is the delivery of print data   through the channel.
The print job delivery channel sub units are represented by   the Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the Model.
It has a   current print job control language, which can be used to   specify which interpreter is to be used for the print data and   to query and change environment variables used by the   interpreters (and Management Applications).
There is also a   default interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is   not explicitly specified using the Control Language.
The first seven items in the Print Job Delivery Channel Table   define the "channel" itself.
A channel typically depends on   other protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows   through the channel.
Control of a print job delivery channel is largely limited to   enabling or disabling the entire channel itself.
It is likely   that more control of the process of accessing print data   will be needed over time.
Thus, the ChannelType will   allow type specific data to be associated with each   channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion   analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated   with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table).
As a first   step in this direction, each channel will identify the   underlying Interface on which it is based.
This is the   eighth object in each row of the table.

"Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use the channel for data submission to the printer.
An application capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its use of the channel.
prtChannelInformation is not intended to provide a general channel description, nor to provide information that is available once the channel is in use.
The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel type.
The description of each PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation, including interaction with other objects.
For channel types that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value shall be null (0 length).
When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its accompanying description must specify the encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the channel type.
prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.
The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of channel attributes, represented as text according to the following rules: 1.
The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization.
The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing the attribute values.
Each entry consists of the following items, in order:
A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A Z, a z) represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that identifies a channel attribute, b.
The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign ( )
(code 61) to delimit the keyword, c.
A data value encoded using rules specific to the PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII Line Feed code), d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data value.
No other octets shall be present.
Conventionally, keywords are capitalized (including each word of a multi word keyword) and since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are kept short.
If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one value.
Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each attribute.
By default, entries may appear in any order.
If there are ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be specified in their definitions.
The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes.
However, other representations may be specified: a.
In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains information not normally coded in textual form, whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for the information should be used for encoding the prtChannelInformation value.
(For instance, a binary port value might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII codes.)
Such encoding must be specified in the definition of the value.
The value may contain textual information in a character set other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.
(For instance, an identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the UTF 8 encoding scheme.)
Such a character set and its encoding must be specified in the definition of the value.
For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following information for each entry:
The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII.
Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other information required to complete the definition (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between entries).
Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry types are added."

The initial version the IANA Printer MIB defined in section 5 of this document is to be archived by IANA and subsequently maintained according to the Process specified in section 2.4.1 of this document.
The most current and authoritative version of the IANA Printer MIB is available at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaprinter mib 8.
Internationalization Considerations See section 2.2.1.1, 'International Considerations'.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
prtGeneralTable: prtGeneralCurrentLocalization   Possible data loss prtGeneralReset
Possible severe inconvenience prtConsoleDisable   Possible severe inconvenience
Possible minor inconvenience prtConsoleDisplayBufferTable prtConsoleDisplayBufferText   Possible minor inconvenience
Possible minor inconvenience SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
Where the operational capability of the printing device are especially vulnerable or difficult to administer, certain objects within this MIB have been tagged as READ ONLY, preventing modification.
Further, for all READ WRITE objects within the MIB, the working group has included specific conformance guidelines stating that vendors are free to implement these objects as READ  ONLY.
This conformance allowance should cover cases where specific vendor vulnerabilities may differ from product to product.
(See conformance section with regards to MIN ACCESS clauses).
Appendix A Glossary of Terms Addressability
On the marker, the number of distinct marking units (pels) per unit of addressability unit that can be set; for example, 300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths Of Inches and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers.
Addressability is not resolution because marks that are one addressability position apart may not be independently resolvable by the eye due to factors such as gain in the area of marks so they overlap or nearly touch.
Alert A reportable event for which there is an entry in the alert table.
Bin An output sub unit which may or may not be removable.
An event which comes in pairs; the leading edge event and the trailing edge event.
The leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one exit.
A binary change event may be critical or non critical.
Bursting The process by which continuous media is separated into individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre formed perforations.
Channel A term used to describe a single source of data which is presented to a printer.
The model that we use in describing a printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.
Multiple channels can exist on the same physical port.
This is commonly done over Ethernet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX protocols can be supplying different data streams simultaneously to a single printer on the same physical port.
In multiple copy output, placing the pages from separate copies into separate ordered sets, ready for binding.
A data syntax or language for controlling the printer through the print data channel.
An alert triggered by an event which leads to a state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is stopped.
Decollating The process by which the individual parts within a multi part form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for each part.
Description Information about the configuration and capabilities of the printer and its various sub units.
DPA ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.
A standard for a client server protocol for a print system, including (1) submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler.
Event A state change in the printer.
Group A collection of objects that represent a type of sub unit of the printer.
Host Resources MIB See [RFC2790].
IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.
Idempotent Idempotence is the property of an operation that results in the same state no matter how many times it is executed (at least once).
This is a property that is shared by true databases in which operations on data items only change the state of the data item and do not have other side effects.
Because the SNMP data model is that of operations on a database, SNMP MIB objects should be assumed to be idempotent.
If a MIB object is defined in a non idempotent way, the this data model can break in subtle ways when faced with packet loss, multiple managers, and other common conditions.
In order to fulfill the common need for actions to result from SNMP Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such that the change in state from one state to another has the side effect of causing an action.
It is important to note that with this model, an SNMP operation that sets a value equal to its current value will cause no action.
This retains the idempotence of a single command, while allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP SET requests.
A tray or bin from which instances of the media are obtained and fed into the Media Path.
The embodiment of an algorithm that processes a data stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL) and/or a Control Language.
The specification of human language, country, and character set needed to present information to people in their native languages.
A program which queries and controls one or more managed nodes.
Management Station A physical computer on which one or more management applications can run.
The mechanisms that transport instances of the media from an input, through the marker, possibly through media buffers and duplex pathways, out to the output with optional finishing applied.
The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.
An alert triggered by a reportable event which does not lead to a state in which printing is no longer possible; such an alert may lead to a state from which printing may no longer be possible in the future, such as the low toner state or the alert may be pure informational, such as a configuration change at the printer.
Output A bin or stacker which accepts instances of media that have been processed by a printer.
A data syntax or language for the electronic representation of a document as a sequence of page images.
Printer A physical device that takes media from an input source, produces marks on that media according to some page description or page control language and puts the result in some output destination, possibly with finishing applied.
Printing The entire process of producing a printed document from generation of the file to be printed, choosing printing properties, selection of a printer, routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling, and finally printing including notifying the user.
An event that is deemed of interest to a management station watching the printer.
Status Information regarding the current operating state of the printer and its various sub units.
This is an abstraction of the exact physical condition of the printer.
A distinguishable part of a sub unit.
A part of the printer which may be a physical part, such as one of the input sources or a logical part such as an interpreter.
Tray An input sub unit which is typically removable.
An event that indicates a change of state of the printer, but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the state that was left, and from which no return is necessary.
The portion of the state of the printer that can be examined by a management application.
Warning A non critical alert.
Appendix B Media Size Names
The PWG Standardized Media Names specification [PWGMEDIA], section 5 Self  Describing Names, contains the currently recommended media size names.
This appendix lists the standardized media size names from ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA),
[ISO10175] as presented in RFC 1759.
Management applications are encouraged to use the names from the PWG standard.
However, many legacy systems exist that use the DPA names and they are presented here for the convenience of developers.
A printer implementing the Printer MIB has no knowledge of these names, however; all media sizes in the MIB are given in terms of media dimensions as the values of prtInputMediaDimFeedDirChosen and prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirChosen.
Description other unknown na letter or letter
North American number 10 business envelope size:  4.125 by 9.5 inches na
North American number 9 business envelope size:  3.875 by 8.875 inches na
45 mm Appendix C Media Names
For the convenience of management application developers, this appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA), [ISO10175].
Management applications that present a dialogue for choosing media may wish to use these names as an alternative to separately specifying, size, color, and/or type.
New names may also be created using this format and the names defined in the PWG Standardized Media Names specification [PWGMEDIA].
Using standard media names will mean that a single management application dealing with printers from different vendors and under different system mangers will tend to use the same names for the same media.
If selection of media by name is used, the attributes (size, type or color) implied by the name must be explicitly mapped to the appropriate object (prtInputMediaDimFeedDirDeclared, prtInputMediaDimXFeedDirDeclared, prtInputMediaType and prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB.
The object prtInputMediaName is intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive.
The value in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer so using a standard name for this value will not change any of the other media attributes nor will it cause an alert if the media in the input sub  unit does not match the name.

The need for "Role Models" stemmed in large part from the need to understand the importance of any given proposed object for the MIB.
Many times the real world need for a proposed object would be debated within the group; the debate would typically result in the need to describe the potential usage of the object in terms of a "live" person performing some type of printing related task.
Determining the value of a proposed object through identification of the associated human users was found to be so common that a more formalized model was required for consistent analysis.
The model describing categories of human oriented tasks is called "Role Models" in this document.
In developing the Role Models it was necessary to identify the common, primary tasks that humans typically face when interacting with a printer and its related printing system(s).
It was expected that certain kinds of tasks would serve to identify the various Role Models.
In presenting the set of Role Models, the set of "Common Print System Tasks" are first presented, followed by the set of Role Model definitions.
Finally, a simple matrix is presented in which Role Models and Tasks are cross compared.
Upon researching the many tasks encountered by humans in dealing with printers and printing systems, the following were found to be pervasive within any operating environment:
Printer job state Determine the status of a job without a printer.
Printer capabilities Determine the current capabilities of a printer, for example, the available media sizes, two sided printing, a particular type of interpreter, etc.
Printer job submission Submit a print job to a printer.
Printer job removal Remove a job from a printer.
Notification of events Receive notification of the existence of a defined printer event.
An event can be of many types, including warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., "job done"), etc.
Printer configuration Query the current configuration of a printer.
Printer consumables Determine the current state of any and all consumables within a printer.
Print job identification Determine the identification of a job within a printer.
Internal printer status Determine the current status of the printer.
Printer identification Determine the identity of a printer.
Printer location Determine the physical location of a printer.
Local system configuration Determine various aspects of the current configuration of the local system involved with the operation of a printer.
These "tasks" cover a large spectrum of requirements surrounding the operation of a printer in a network environment.
This list serves as the basis for defining the various Role Models described below.
Proposed Role Models Following is the list of "Role Models" used to evaluate the requirements for any given Printer MIB object.
Note that the keyword enclosed in parentheses represents an abbreviation for the particular Role Model in the matrix described later in this document.
A person or application that submits print jobs to the printer; typically viewed as the "end user" within the overall printing environment.
A person responsible for maintaining a printer on a day to day basis, including such tasks as filling empty media trays, emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges, clearing simple paper jams, etc.
A person responsible for repairing a malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance, and other tasks that typically require advanced training on the printer internals.
An example of a "technician" would be a manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person formally trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.
A person responsible for configuration and troubleshooting of components involved in the overall printing environment, including printers, print queues and network connectivity issues.
This person is typically responsible for ensuring the overall operational integrity of the print system components, and is typically viewed as the central point of coordination among all other Role Models.
A person responsible for supporting Users in their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting Users' printing problems.
A person responsible for managing an organization's printing system assets (primarily printers).
Such a person needs to be able to identify and track the location of printing assets on an ongoing basis.
A person responsible for tracking the usage of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of planning printer acquisitions and/or placement of printers based on usage trends.
A person or application responsible for installing or configuring printing system components on a local system.
A person responsible for tracking the usage of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of charging Users for resources used.
Matrix of Common Print System Tasks and Role Models
To better understand the relationship between the set of defined "Common Print System Tasks" and the various "Role Models," the following matrix is provided.
It is important to recognize that many of the tasks will appear to be applicable to many of the Role Models.
However, when considering the actual context of a task, it is very important to realize that often the actual context of a task is such that the Role Model can change.
For example, it is obvious that a "System Manager" must be able to submit print jobs to a printer; however, when submitting a print job, a person identified as a "System Manager" is actually operating in the context of a "User" in this case; hence, the requirement to submit a print job is not listed as a requirement for a System Manager.
Conversely, while a "User" must be able to remove a job previously submitted to a printer, an "Operator" is often expected to be able to remove any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal is a (subtly different) requirement for both the "User" and "Operator" Role Models.
xx Appendix E Overall Printer Status Table
The Status Table establishes a convention for the top 25 printer errors.
The table defines a suggested relationship between various printer states and the variables Printer hrDeviceStatus, hrPrinterStatus, hrPrinterDetectedErrorState, prtAlertGroup, prtAlertCode and various sub unit status variables (prtInputStatus, prtOutputStatus, prtMarkerStatus, prtMediaPathStatus and prtChannelStatus).
This table is the recommended implementation of these variables.
It is provided to guide implementors of this MIB and users of the MIB by providing a sample set of states and the variable values that are expected to be produced as result of that state.
This information supplements that provided in Section 2.2.13.2 "Overall Printer Status".
This is not an exhaustive list rather it is a guideline.
The definition of PrtSubUnitStatusTC specifies that SubUnitStatus is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct values/states: Availability, Critical,
Thus when a non  critical alert or alerts are present the values for Availability, On Line and Transitioning will be summed with the Non  Critical Alerts (8) value.
The table was generated in landscape format and is located at ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/pmp/contributions/Top25Errors.pdf.
