  - "1.  Introduction\n   RTP protocols use NTP format timestamps to facilitate multimedia\n
    \  session synchronisation and to provide estimates of round-trip time\n   (RTT)
    and other statistical parameters.\n   Information about media clock timing exchanged
    in NTP format\n   timestamps may come from a clock that is synchronised to a global\n
    \  time reference, but this cannot be assumed, nor is there a\n   standardised
    mechanism available to indicate that timestamps are\n   derived from a common
    reference clock.  Therefore, RTP\n   implementations typically assume that NTP
    timestamps are taken using\n   unsynchronised clocks and must compensate for absolute
    time\n   differences and rate differences.  Without a shared reference clock,\n
    \  RTP can time align flows from the same source at a given receiver\n   using
    relative timing; however, tight synchronisation between two or\n   more different
    receivers (possibly with different network paths) or\n   between two or more senders
    is not possible.\n   High performance AV systems often use a reference media clock\n
    \  distributed to all devices in the system.  The reference media clock\n   may
    be distinct from the reference clock used to provide timestamps.\n   A reference
    media clock may be provided along with an audio or video\n   signal interface,
    or via a dedicated clock signal (e.g., genlock\n   [SMPTE-318M-1999] or audio
    word clock [AES11-2009]).  If sending and\n   receiving media clocks are known
    to be synchronised to a common\n   reference clock, performance can be improved
    by minimising buffering\n   and avoiding rate conversion.\n   This specification
    defines SDP signalling of timestamp reference\n   clock sources and media reference
    clock sources.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  Applications\n   Timestamp reference clock source and media clock signalling
    benefit\n   applications requiring synchronised media capture or playout and low\n
    \  latency operation.\n   Examples include, but are not limited to:\n   Social
    TV:  \"Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) Using the\n      RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP)\" [RFC7272] defines social TV as the\n      combination of media
    content consumption by two or more users at\n      different devices and locations
    and real-time communication\n      between those users.  An example of social
    TV is where two or more\n      users are watching the same television broadcast
    at different\n      devices and/or locations while communicating with each other
    using\n      text, audio, and/or video.  A skew in the media playout of the two\n
    \     or more users can have adverse effects on their experience.  A\n      well-known
    use case here is one friend experiencing a goal in a\n      football match well
    before or after other friends.\n   Video Walls:  A video wall consists of multiple
    computer monitors,\n      video projectors, or television sets tiled together
    contiguously\n      or overlapped in order to form one large screen.  Each of
    the\n      screens reproduces a portion of the larger picture.  In some\n      implementations,
    each screen or projector may be individually\n      connected to the network and
    receive its portion of the overall\n      image from a network-connected video
    server or video scaler.\n      Screens are refreshed at 50 or 60 hertz or potentially
    faster.  If\n      the refresh is not synchronised, the effect of multiple screens\n
    \     acting as one is broken.\n   Networked Audio:  Networked loudspeakers, amplifiers,
    and analogue\n      input/output (I/O) devices transmitting or receiving audio
    signals\n      via RTP can be connected to various parts of a building or campus\n
    \     network.  Such situations can, for example, be found in large\n      conference
    rooms, legislative chambers, classrooms (especially\n      those supporting distance
    learning), and other large-scale\n      environments such as stadiums.  Since
    humans are more sensitive to\n      differences in audio delay, this use case
    needs even more accuracy\n      than the video wall use case.  Depending on the
    exact application,\n      the need for accuracy can then be in the range of microseconds\n
    \     [Olsen].\n   Sensor Arrays:  Sensor arrays contain many synchronised measurement\n
    \     elements producing signals that are then combined to form an\n      overall
    measurement.  Accurate capture of the phase relationships\n      between the various
    signals arriving at each element of the array\n      is critically important for
    proper operation.  Examples include\n      towed or fixed sonar arrays, seismic
    arrays, and phased arrays\n      used in radar applications, for instance.\n"

  - "3.  Definitions\n   The following definitions are used in this document:\n   media
    level:  Media-level information applies to a single SDP media\n      stream.  In
    an SDP description, media-level information appears\n      after each \"m\"-line.\n
    \  multimedia session:  A set of multimedia senders and receivers as\n      well
    as the data streams flowing from senders to receivers.  SDP\n      [RFC4566] describes
    multimedia sessions.\n   RTP media stream:  A single stream of RTP packets identified
    by an\n      RTP Synchronisation Source (SSRC).\n   RTP sender:  The device generating
    an associated RTP media stream.\n   session level:  Session-level information
    applies to an entire\n      multimedia session.  In an SDP description, session-level\n
    \     information appears before the first \"m\"-line.\n   source level:  Source-level
    information applies to a specific RTP\n      media stream.  \"Source-Specific
    Media Attributes in the Session\n      Description Protocol (SDP)\" [RFC5576]
    defines how source-level\n      information is included into an SDP session description.\n
    \  traceable time:  A clock is considered to provide traceable time if\n      it
    can be proven to be synchronised to International Atomic Time\n      (TAI).  Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC) is a time standard\n      synchronised to TAI.  UTC is, therefore,
    also considered traceable\n      time once leap seconds have been taken into account.
    \ GPS\n      [IS-GPS-200F] is commonly used to provide a TAI traceable time\n
    \     reference.  Some network time synchronisation protocols (e.g.,\n      Precision
    Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588-2008] and NTP) can\n      explicitly indicate that
    the master clock is providing a traceable\n      time reference over the network.\n"

  - "4.  Timestamp Reference Clock Source Signalling\n   The NTP format timestamps
    used by RTP are taken by reading a local\n   real-time clock at the sender or
    receiver.  This local clock may be\n   synchronised to another clock (time source)
    by some means, or it may\n   be unsynchronised.  A variety of methods are available
    to synchronise\n   local clocks to a reference time source, including network
    time\n   protocols (e.g., NTP [RFC5905] and PTP [IEEE1588-2008]) and radio\n   clocks
    (e.g., GPS [IS-GPS-200F]).\n   The following sections describe and define SDP
    signalling, indicating\n   whether and how the local timestamping clock in an
    RTP sender or\n   receiver is synchronised to a reference clock.\n"

    - "4.1.  Clock Synchronisation\n   Two or more local clocks that are sufficiently
      synchronised will\n   produce timestamps for a given RTP event that can be used
      as if they\n   came from the same clock.  Timestamps produced in one RTP sender
      or\n   receiver can be directly compared to a local clock in another RTP\n   sender
      or receiver.\n   The accuracy of synchronisation required is application dependent.\n
      \  See \"Applications\" (Section 2) for a discussion of applications and\n   their
      corresponding requirements.  To serve as a reference clock,\n   clocks must
      minimally be \"syntonised\" (exactly frequency matched) to\n   one another.\n
      \  Sufficient synchronisation can typically be achieved by using a\n   network
      time protocol (e.g., NTP, 802.1AS, and IEEE 1588-2008) to\n   synchronise all
      devices to a single master clock.\n   Another approach is to use clocks providing
      a global time reference\n   (e.g., GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS).  This concept
      may be used in\n   conjunction with network time protocols as some protocols
      (e.g., PTP\n   and NTP) allow master clocks to indicate explicitly that they
      are\n   providing traceable time.\n"

    - "4.3.  Identifying PTP Reference Clocks\n   The Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
      as standardised in IEEE 1588\n   provides a shared reference clock in a network.
      \ IEEE 1588 provides\n   sub-microsecond synchronisation between devices on
      a LAN and\n   typically locks within seconds at startup.  With support from\n
      \  Ethernet switches, IEEE 1588 protocols can achieve nanosecond timing\n   accuracy
      in LANs.  Network interface chips and cards supporting\n   hardware timestamping
      of timing-critical protocol messages are also\n   available.\n   Three flavours
      of IEEE 1588 are in use today:\n   o  IEEE 1588-2002 [IEEE1588-2002]: the original
      \"Standard for a\n      Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked
      Measurement\n      and Control Systems\".  This is also known as IEEE1588v1
      or PTPv1.\n   o  IEEE 1588-2008 [IEEE1588-2008]: the second version of the\n
      \     \"Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for\n      Networked
      Measurement and Control Systems\".  This is a revised\n      version of the
      original IEEE1588-2002 standard and is also known\n      as IEEE1588v2 or PTPv2.
      \ IEEE 1588-2008 is not protocol compatible\n      with IEEE 1588-2002.\n   o
      \ IEEE 802.1AS [IEEE802.1AS-2011]: \"Timing and Synchronization for\n      Time
      Sensitive Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks\".  This\n      is a profile
      of IEEE 1588-2008 that is Layer 2 only and is for use\n      in Audio/Video
      Bridged LANs as described in IEEE 802.1BA-2011\n      [IEEE802.1BA-2011].\n
      \  Each IEEE 1588 clock is identified by a 64-bit Extended Unique\n   Identifier
      (EUI-64) called a \"ClockIdentity\".  A slave clock using\n   one of the IEEE
      1588 family of network time protocols acquires the\n   ClockIdentity of the
      grandmaster clock that is the ultimate source of\n   timing information for
      the network.  A boundary clock, which is\n   itself slaved to another boundary
      clock, or the grandmaster passes\n   the grandmaster ClockIdentity through to
      its slaves.\n   Several instances of the IEEE 1588 protocol may operate independently\n
      \  on a single network, forming distinct PTP domains, each of which may\n   have
      a different grandmaster clock.  As the IEEE 1588 standards have\n   evolved,
      the definition of PTP domains has changed.  IEEE 1588-2002\n   identifies protocol
      subdomains by a textual name, but IEEE 1588-2008\n   identifies protocol domains
      using a numeric domain number. 802.1AS is\n   a Layer 2 profile of IEEE 1588-2008
      supporting a single numeric clock\n   domain (0).\n   When PTP domains are signalled
      via SDP, senders and receivers SHOULD\n   check that both grandmaster ClockIdentity
      and the PTP domain match\n   when determining clock equivalence.\n   Two or
      more IEEE 1588 clocks MAY be listed at the same level in the\n   session description
      to indicate that all of the listed clocks are\n   candidate grandmaster clocks
      for the domain or deliver the same\n   reference time and may be used interchangeably.
      \ RTP senders and\n   receivers are assured proper synchronisation regardless
      of which\n   synchronisation source they choose and, in support of fault\n   tolerance,
      may switch the reference clock source while streaming.\n   The PTP protocols
      employ a distributed election protocol called the\n   \"Best Master Clock Algorithm\"
      (BMCA) to determine the active clock\n   master.  The clock master choices available
      to BMCA can be restricted\n   or biased by configuration parameters to influence
      the election\n   process.  In some systems, it may be desirable to limit the
      number of\n   possible PTP clock masters to avoid the need to re-signal timestamp\n
      \  reference clock sources when the clock master changes.\n"

      \  by digital television or cellular services.  These sources are\n   identified

      \  practice in embedded RTP implementations.  These clocks are\n   identified

      be labelled \"traceable\" if it\n   is known to be delivering traceable time,
      provided adjustments are\n   made for differing epochs, timezones, and leap
      seconds.  Timestamps\n   taken using clocks synchronised to a traceable time
      source can be\n   directly compared even if the clocks are synchronised to different\n
      \  sources or via different mechanisms.\n   Marking a clock as traceable allows
      additional information (e.g., IP\n   addresses, PTP master identifiers, and
      the like) to be omitted from\n   the SDP since any traceable clock available
      at the answerer is\n   considered to be an appropriate timestamp reference clock.
      \ For\n   example, an offerer could specify ts-refclk:ntp=/traceable/ and the\n
      \  answerer could use GPS as a reference clock since GPS is a source of\n   traceable

      3 earlier in this document for more\n   information).\n   Timestamp reference
      clock source signalling included at the session\n   level provides default parameters

      \ More specific\n   signalling included at the source level overrides media-level\n
      \  signalling.\n   If timestamp reference clock source signalling is included
      anywhere\n   in an SDP description, it must be properly defined for all levels

      may be repeated at a given level\n   (i.e., for a session or source) to provide

    - "5.2.  Direct-Referenced Media Clock\n   A media clock may be directly derived
      from a reference clock.  For\n   this case, it is required that a reference
      clock be specified with an\n   a=ts-refclk attribute (Section 4.8).\n   The
      signalling optionally indicates a media clock offset value.  The\n   offset
      indicates the RTP timestamp value at the epoch (time of\n   origin) of the reference
      clock.  To use the offset, implementations\n   need to compute RTP timestamps
      from reference clocks.  To simplify\n   these calculations, streams utilizing
      offset signalling SHOULD use a\n   TAI timestamp reference clock to avoid complications
      introduced by\n   leap seconds.  See [RFC7164] for further discussion of leap-second\n
      \  issues in timestamp reference clocks.\n   To compute the RTP timestamp against
      an IEEE 1588 (TAI-based)\n   reference, the time elapsed between the 00:00:00
      1 January 1970 IEEE\n   1588 epoch and the current time must be computed.  Between
      the epoch\n   and 1 January 2013, there were 15,706 days (including extra days\n
      \  during leap years).  Since there are no leap seconds in a TAI\n   reference,
      there are exactly 86,400 seconds during each of these days\n   or a total of
      1,356,998,400 seconds from the epoch to 00:00:00 1\n   January 2013.  A 90 kHz
      RTP clock for a video stream would have\n   advanced 122,129,856,000,000 units
      over this period.  With a\n   signalled offset of 0, the RTP clock value modulo
      the 32-bit unsigned\n   RTP timestamp representation in the RTP header would
      have been\n   2,460,938,240 at 00:00:00 1 January 2013.  If an offset of 23,465
      had\n   been signalled, the clock value would have been 2,460,961,705.\n   In
      order to use an NTP reference, the actual time elapsed between the\n   00:00:00
      1 January 1900 NTP epoch to the current time must be\n   computed. 2,208,988,800
      seconds elapsed between the NTP epoch and\n   00:00:00 1 January 1970 [RFC0868].
      \ Between the beginning of 1970 and\n   2013, there were 15,706 days elapsed
      (including extra days during\n   leap years) and 25 leap seconds inserted.  There
      is, therefore, a\n   total of 3,565,987,225 seconds from the NTP epoch to 00:00:00
      1\n   January 2013.  A 90 kHz RTP clock for a video stream would have\n   advanced
      320,938,850,250,000 units over this period.  With a\n   signalled offset of
      0, the RTP clock value modulo the 32-bit unsigned\n   representation would have
      been 1,714,023,696 at 00:00:00 1 January\n   2013.\n   If no offset is signalled,
      the offset can be inferred at the receiver\n   by examining RTCP sender reports
      that contain NTP and RTP timestamps,\n   which combined define a mapping.  The
      NTP/RTP timestamp mapping\n   provided by RTCP sender reports (SRs) takes precedence
      over that\n   signalled through SDP; however, the media clock rate implied by
      the\n   SRs MUST be consistent with the rate signalled.\n   A rate modifier
      may be specified.  The modifier is expressed as the\n   ratio of two integers
      and modifies the rate specified or implied by\n   the media description by this
      ratio.  If omitted, the rate is assumed\n   to be the exact rate specified or
      implied by the media format.  For\n   example, without a rate specification,
      the RTP clock for an 8 kHz\n   G.711 audio stream will advance exactly 8000
      units for each second\n   advance in the reference clock from which it is derived.\n
      \  The rate modifier is primarily useful for accommodating certain\n   \"oddball\"
      audio sample rates associated with NTSC video (see\n   Figure 7).  Modified
      rates are not advised for video streams that\n   generally use a 90 kHz RTP
      clock regardless of frame rate or sample\n   rate used for embedded audio.\n

    - "5.3.  Stream-Referenced Media Clock\n   A common synchronisation architecture
      for audio/visual systems\n   involves distributing a reference media clock from
      a master device to\n   a number of slave devices, typically by means of a cable.
      \ Examples\n   include audio word clock distribution and video black burst\n
      \  distribution.  In this case, the media clock is locally generated,\n   often
      by a crystal oscillator, and is not locked to a timestamp\n   reference clock.\n
      \  To support this architecture across a network, a master clock\n   identifier
      is associated with an RTP media stream carrying media\n   clock timing information
      from a master device.  The master clock\n   identifier represents a media clock
      source in the master device.\n   Slave devices in turn associate the master
      media clock identifier\n   with streams they transmit, signalling the synchronisation\n
      \  relationship between the master and the transmitter's media clock.\n   Slave
      devices recover media clock timing from the clock master\n   stream, using it
      to synchronise the slave's media clock with the\n   master.  If a common reference
      clock is available, NTP timestamps in\n   the master clock RTP media stream
      are taken using the shared\n   reference clock.  The NTP timestamps communicate
      information about\n   media clock timing (rate and phase) from the master to
      the slave\n   devices.  NTP timestamps are communicated in the usual RTP fashion\n
      \  via RTCP SRs, or via the [RFC6051] header extension.  If no shared\n   reference
      clock is available or signalled, a slave can synchronise to\n   the master's
      media clock using RTP timestamps alone as described in\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC3550].\n
      \  Note that the slaving of a device media clock to a master device does\n   not
      affect RTP inter-media synchronisation.  Time-aligned playout of\n   two or
      more RTP sources still relies upon NTP timestamps supplied via\n   RTCP SRs
      or by the RFC 6051 timestamp header extension.\n   In a given system, master
      clock identifiers must uniquely identify a\n   single media clock source.  Such
      identifiers MAY be manually\n   configured; however, identifiers SHOULD be generated
      according to the\n   \"short-term persistent RTCP CNAME\" algorithm as described
      in\n   [RFC7022].  Master clock identifiers not already in base64 format\n   MUST
      be encoded as base64 strings when used in SDP.  Although the\n   CNAME algorithm
      is used to generate the master clock identifier, it\n   is used to tag RTP sources
      in SDP descriptions and does not appear in\n   RTCP as a CNAME.\n   A reference
      stream can be an RTP stream or an Audio Video Bridging\n   (AVB) stream based
      on the [IEEE1722] standard.\n   An RTP clock master stream SHOULD be identified
      at the source level\n   by an SSRC [RFC5576] and master clock identifier.  An
      RTP stream that\n   provides media clock timing directly from a reference media
      clock\n   (e.g., internal crystal, audio word clock, or video black burst\n
      \  signal) SHOULD tag the stream as a master clock source using the\n   \"src:\"
      prefix.  If master clock identifiers are declared at the media\n   or session
      level, all RTP sources at or below the level of\n   declaration MUST provide

  title: 5.  Media Clock Source Signalling
- contents:
  - "6.  Signalling Considerations\n   Signalling of timestamp reference clock source
    (Section 4.8) and\n   media clock source (Section 5.4) is defined to be used either
    by\n   applications that implement the SDP Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] or\n   by
    applications that use SDP to describe media and transport\n   configurations.\n
    \  A description SHOULD include both reference clock signalling and\n   media
    clock signalling.  If no reference clock is available, this\n   SHOULD be signalled
    as a local reference (Section 4.6).\n   When no media clock signalling is present,
    an asynchronous media\n   clock (Section 5.1) MUST be assumed.  When no reference
    clock\n   signalling is present, a local reference clock (Section 4.6) MUST be\n
    \  assumed.\n   If a reference clock is not signalled or a local reference is\n
    \  specified, the corresponding media clock may be established as rate\n   synchronised
    with no assurance of time synchronisation.\n   When the description signals a
    direct-referenced media clock\n   (Section 5.2), reference clock signalling is
    REQUIRED.  Asynchronous\n   and stream-referenced media clocks (Section 5.3) MAY
    be specified\n   with or without a reference clock signalling.\n"
  - contents:
    - "6.1.  Usage in Offer/Answer\n   During offer/answer, clock source signalling
      via SDP uses a\n   declarative model.  Supported media and/or reference clocks
      are\n   specified in the offered SDP description.  The answerer may accept or\n
      \  reject the offer in an application-specific way depending on the\n   clocks
      that are available and the clocks that are offered.  For\n   example, an answerer
      may choose to accept an offer that lacks a\n   common clock by falling back
      to a lower-performance mode of operation\n   (e.g., by assuming reference or
      media clocks are local rather than\n   shared).  Conversely, the answerer may
      choose to reject the offer\n   when the offered clock specifications indicate
      that the available\n   reference and/or media clocks are incompatible.\n   While
      negotiation of reference clock and media clock attributes is\n   not defined
      in this document, negotiation MAY be accomplished using\n   the capabilities
      negotiation procedures defined in [RFC5939].\n"
    - contents:
      - "6.1.1.  Indicating Support for Clock Source Signalling\n   An offerer or
        answerer indicates support for media clock signalling\n   by including a reference
        or media clock specification in the SDP\n   description.  An offerer or answerer
        without specific reference or\n   media clocks to signal SHOULD indicate support
        for clock source\n   signalling by including a local reference clock (Section
        4.6)\n   specification in the SDP description.\n"
      title: 6.1.1.  Indicating Support for Clock Source Signalling
    - contents:
      - "6.1.2.  Timestamp Reference Clock\n   If one or more of the reference clocks
        specified in the offer are\n   usable by the answerer, the answerer SHOULD
        respond with an answer\n   containing the subset of reference clock specifications
        in the offer\n   that are usable by the answerer.  If the answerer rejects
        the offer\n   because the available reference clocks are incompatible, the\n
        \  rejection MUST contain at least one timestamp reference clock\n   specification
        usable by the answerer so that appropriate information\n   is available for
        diagnostics.  If no external reference clock is\n   available to the answerer,
        a local reference clock (Section 4.6)\n   specification SHOULD be included
        in the rejection.\n   In both offers and answers, multiple reference clock
        specifications\n   indicate equivalent clocks from different sources that
        may be used\n   interchangeably.  RTP senders and receivers are assured proper\n
        \  synchronisation regardless of which of the specified sources is\n   chosen
        and, in support of fault tolerance, may switch clock sources\n   while streaming.\n"

      - "6.1.3.  Media Clock\n   If the media clock mode specified in the offer is
        acceptable to the\n   answerer, the answerer SHOULD respond with an answer
        containing the\n   same media clock specification as the offer.  If the answerer
        rejects\n   the offer because the available reference clocks are incompatible,\n
        \  the rejection MUST contain a media clock specification supported by\n   the
        answerer so that appropriate information is available for\n   diagnostics.
        \ If no shared media clocks are available to the\n   answerer, an asynchronous
        media clock (Section 5.1) specification\n   SHOULD be included in the rejection.\n"

  - contents:
    - "6.2.  Usage Outside of Offer/Answer\n   SDP can be employed outside of the
      offer/answer context, for\n   instance, for multimedia sessions that are announced
      through the\n   Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [RFC2974] or streamed through
      the\n   Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [RFC2326].\n   Devices using published
      descriptions to join sessions SHOULD assess\n   their synchronisation compatibility
      with the described session based\n   on the clock source signalling and SHOULD
      NOT attempt to join a\n   session with incompatible reference or media clocks.\n"

  title: 6.  Signalling Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Entities receiving and acting upon an SDP message
    should note that a\n   session description cannot be trusted unless it has been
    obtained by\n   an authenticated transport protocol from a known and trusted source.\n
    \  Many different transport protocols may be used to distribute a\n   session
    description, and the nature of the authentication will differ\n   from transport
    to transport.  For some transports, security features\n   are often not deployed.
    \ In case a session description has not been\n   obtained in a trusted manner,
    the endpoint should exercise care\n   because, among other attacks, the media
    sessions received may not be\n   the intended ones, the destination where media
    is sent to may not be\n   the expected one, and any of the parameters of the session
    may be\n   incorrect.\n   Incorrect reference or media clock parameters may cause
    devices or\n   streams to synchronise to unintended clock sources.  Normally,
    this\n   simply results in failure to establish a session or failure to\n   synchronise
    once connected.  Enough devices fraudulently assigned to\n   a specific clock
    source (e.g., a particular IEEE 1588 grandmaster)\n   may, however, constitute
    a successful denial-of-service attack on\n   that source.  Devices MAY wish to
    validate the integrity of the clock\n   description through some means before
    connecting to unfamiliar clock\n   sources.\n   The timestamp reference clocks
    negotiated by this protocol are used\n   to provide media timing information to
    RTP.  Negotiated timestamp\n   reference clocks should not be relied upon to provide
    a secure time\n   reference for security critical operations (e.g., the expiration
    of\n   public key certificates).\n"
