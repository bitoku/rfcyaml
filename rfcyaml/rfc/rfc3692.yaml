  - "1.  Introduction\n   When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often\
    \ necessary\n   to have a protocol number as part of the implementation [RFC2434].\n\
    \   For example, to develop a protocol that runs directly above IP, one\n   needs\
    \ an IP Protocol Number to place in the Protocol field of the IP\n   header [RFC791].\
    \  In some cases, obtaining a new number is\n   straightforward (e.g., a well-known\
    \ TCP or UDP port) or not even\n   necessary (e.g., TCP and UDP port numbers for\
    \ testing purposes).  In\n   other cases, obtaining a number is more difficult.\
    \  For example, the\n   number of available and unassigned values in a name space\
    \ may be\n   small enough that there is concern that all available numbers will\
    \ be\n   used up if assigned carelessly.  Even in cases where numbers are\n  \
    \ potentially plentiful, it may be undesirable to assign numbers unless\n   the\
    \ proposed usage has been adequately reviewed by the broader\n   community.  Consequently,\
    \ some number spaces specify that IANA only\n   make assignments in cases where\
    \ there is strong community support for\n   a proposed protocol.  For example,\
    \ values out of some name spaces are\n   only assigned through an \"IETF Standards\
    \ Action\" [RFC2434], which\n   requires that the proposed use be in an IETF Standards\
    \ Track RFC.\n   In order to experiment with a new protocol, an experimental value\
    \ may\n   be needed that won't collide with an existing or future usage.\n   One\
    \ approach is to allow IANA to make temporary assignments for such\n   purposes.\
    \  The idea is that a protocol value can be assigned to allow\n   experimentation,\
    \ but after the experiment ends, the number would be\n   returned to IANA.  There\
    \ are several drawbacks to this approach,\n   however.  First, experience has\
    \ shown that it can be difficult to\n   reclaim numbers once assigned.  For example,\
    \ contact information\n   becomes outdated and it can become difficult to find\
    \ out what the\n   status of an experiment actually is.  Second, should deployment\
    \ with\n   the temporarily assigned number take place (e.g., it is included as\n\
    \   part of a product), it becomes very difficult to determine whether or\n  \
    \ not reuse of that number would lead to adverse impact with regards to\n   deployed\
    \ devices.  Finally, it can be difficult to determine when an\n   experiment has\
    \ ended and whether the number needs to be returned.\n   An alternate approach,\
    \ and the one recommended in this document, is\n   to assign a range of numbers\
    \ specifically earmarked for testing and\n   experimentation purposes.  Mutually\
    \ consenting devices could use\n   these numbers for whatever purposes they desire,\
    \ but under the\n   understanding that they are reserved for generic testing purposes,\n\
    \   and other implementations may use the same numbers for different\n   experimental\
    \ uses.\n   Numbers in the experimentation range are similar to those called\n\
    \   \"Private Use\" in RFC 2434 [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].  They are not\n   intended\
    \ to be used in general deployments or be enabled by default\n   in products or\
    \ other general releases.  In those cases where a\n   product or release makes\
    \ use of an experimental number, the end user\n   must be required to explicitly\
    \ enable the experimental feature and\n   likewise have the ability to chose and\
    \ assign which number from the\n   experimental range will be used for a specific\
    \ purpose (i.e., so the\n   end user can ensure that use of a particular number\
    \ doesn't conflict\n   with other on-going uses).  Shipping a product with a specific\
    \ value\n   pre-enabled would be inappropriate and can lead to interoperability\n\
    \   problems when the chosen value collides with a different usage, as it\n  \
    \ someday surely will.\n   From the above, it follows that it would be inappropriate\
    \ for a group\n   of vendors, a consortia, or another Standards Development\n\
    \   Organization to agree among themselves to use a particular value for\n   a\
    \ specific purpose and then agree to deploy devices using those\n   values.  By\
    \ definition, experimental numbers are not guaranteed to be\n   unique in any\
    \ environment other than one where the local system\n   administrator has chosen\
    \ to use a particular number for a particular\n   purpose and can ensure that\
    \ a particular value is not already in use\n   for some other purpose.\n   Once\
    \ an extension has been tested and shown to be useful, a permanent\n   number\
    \ could be obtained through the normal assignment procedures.\n   Most implementations\
    \ will not do anything special with numbers\n   assigned for testing purposes.\
    \  In particular, unless a packet or\n   other Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is specifically\
    \ directed at a device,\n   that device will not even look at the field while\
    \ processing the PDU.\n   For example, IP routers do not need to examine or understand\
    \ the\n   Protocol Type field of IP datagrams in order to know how to correctly\n\
    \   forward them.  In those cases where a packet or PDU is directed at a\n   device,\
    \ and that device has not been configured to recognize the\n   extension, the\
    \ device will either ignore the PDU, discard it, or\n   signal an error, depending\
    \ on the protocol-specific rules that\n   indicate how to process unknown options\
    \ or features.  In those cases\n   where a protocol has different ways of handling\
    \ unrecognized\n   extensions (e.g., silently discard vs. signal an error), that\n\
    \   protocol needs to reserve values for testing purposes from all the\n   appropriate\
    \ ranges.  Only those implementations specifically enabled\n   or configured to\
    \ make use of an extension or feature that is being\n   experimented with would\
    \ process the data further.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Recommendation for Protocols
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Recommendation for Protocols\n   To make it possible to experiment with\
    \ protocol extensions safely,\n   protocol documents should consider reserving\
    \ a small set of protocol\n   numbers for experimentation.  Such reservations\
    \ can be made through\n   an explicit reservation in an IANA Considerations section.\n\
    \   The exact number of values to reserve for experimentation will depend\n  \
    \ on the specific protocol and factors specific to that protocol.  For\n   example,\
    \ in cases where the values of a field are subdivided into\n   ranges that are\
    \ treated differently (e.g., \"silently ignore\" vs.\n   \"return an error\" if\
    \ the value is not understood), one or more values\n   from each sub-range may\
    \ need to be reserved.\n   For protocols that return error codes, it may also\
    \ be appropriate to\n   reserve a small number of experimental error values that\
    \ can be used\n   in conjunction with possible experimental uses.  For example,\
    \ an\n   experimental message might result (even under normal conditions) in\n\
    \   an error, with a special error code (or sub-code) indicating the type\n  \
    \ of error condition.\n   In many, if not most cases, reserving a single value\
    \ for experimental\n   use will suffice.  While it may be tempting to reserve\
    \ more in order\n   to make it easy to test many things at once, reserving many\
    \ may also\n   increase the temptation for someone using a particular value to\n\
    \   assume that a specific experimental value can be used for a given\n   purpose\
    \ exclusively.  Values reserved for experimental use are never\n   to be made\
    \ permanent; permanent assignments should be obtained\n   through standard processes.\
    \  As described above, experimental numbers\n   are intended for experimentation\
    \ and testing and are not intended for\n   wide or general deployments.\n   When\
    \ protocols that use experimental numbers are included in\n   products, the shipping\
    \ versions of the products must disable\n   recognition of protocol experimental\
    \ numbers by default -- that is,\n   the end user of the product must explicitly\
    \ \"turn on\" the\n   experimental protocol functionality.  In most cases, a product\n\
    \   implementation must require the end user to configure the value\n   explicitly\
    \ prior to enabling its usage.  Should a product not have a\n   user interface\
    \ for such end user configuration, the product must\n   require explicit re-programming\
    \ (e.g., a special firmware download,\n   or installation of a feature card) to\
    \ configure the experimental\n   number(s) of the protocol(s) implicitly.\n"

    \  These values have been allocated from the upper end of the\n   available number\
