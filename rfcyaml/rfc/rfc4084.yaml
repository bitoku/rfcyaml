  - "Abstract\n   As the Internet has evolved, many types of arrangements have been\n\
    \   advertised and sold as \"Internet connectivity\".  Because these may\n   differ\
    \ significantly in the capabilities they offer, the range of\n   options, and\
    \ the lack of any standard terminology, the effort to\n   distinguish between\
    \ these services has caused considerable consumer\n   confusion.  This document\
    \ provides a list of terms and definitions\n   that may be helpful to providers,\
    \ consumers, and, potentially,\n   regulators in clarifying the type and character\
    \ of services being\n   offered.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Problem and the Requirement\n   Different ISPs and other providers\
    \ offer a wide variety of products\n   that are identified as \"Internet\" or\
    \ \"Internet access\".  These\n   products offer different types of functionality\
    \ and, as a result,\n   some may be appropriate for certain users and uses and\
    \ not others.\n   For example, a service that offers only access to the Web (in\
    \ this\n   context, the portion of the Internet that is accessible via the HTTP\n\
    \   and HTTPS protocols) may be appropriate for someone who is\n   exclusively\
    \ interested in browsing and in Web-based email services.\n   It will not be appropriate\
    \ for someone who needs to download files or\n   use email more frequently.  And\
    \ it is likely to be even less\n   appropriate for someone who needs to operate\
    \ servers for other users,\n   who needs virtual private network (VPN) capabilities\
    \ or other secured\n   access to a remote office, or who needs to synchronize\
    \ mail for\n   offline use.\n   Recent and rapidly evolving changes to the Internet's\
    \ email\n   environment have led to additional restrictions on sending and\n \
    \  retrieving email.  These restrictions, most of them developed as part\n   of\
    \ well intentioned attempts to prevent or fight unsolicited mail,\n   may be imposed\
    \ independently of the service types described below and\n   are discussed separately\
    \ in Section 3.\n   This document describes only the functions provided or permitted\
    \ by\n   the service provider.  It does not and cannot specify the functions\n\
    \   that pass through and are supported by various user-provided\n   equipment.\n\
    \   The terms SHOULD, MUST, or MAY are capitalized in this document, as\n   defined\
    \ in [1].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Adoption and a Non-pejorative Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Adoption and a Non-pejorative Terminology\n   The definitions proposed\
    \ here are of little value if service\n   providers and vendors are not willing\
    \ to adopt them.  The terms\n   proposed are intended not to be pejorative, despite\
    \ the belief of\n   some members of the IETF community that some of these connectivity\n\
    \   models are simply \"broken\" or \"not really an Internet service\".  The\n\
    \   mention of a particular service or model in this document does not\n   imply\
    \ any endorsement of it, only recognition of something that\n   exists or might\
    \ exist in the marketplace.  Thus, the Best Current\n   Practice described in\
    \ this document is about terminology and\n   information that should be supplied\
    \ to the user and not about the\n   types of service that should be offered.\n"
- title: 2.  General Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  General Terminology\n   This section lists the primary IP service terms.\
    \  It is hoped that\n   service providers will adopt these terms, to better define\
    \ the\n   services to potential users or customers.  The terms refer to the\n\
    \   intent of the provider (ISP), as expressed in either technical\n   measures\
    \ or terms and conditions of service.  It may be possible to\n   work around particular\
    \ implementations of these characteristic\n   connectivity types, but that freedom\
    \ is generally not the intent of\n   the provider and is unlikely to be supported\
    \ if the workarounds stop\n   working.\n   The service terms are listed in order\
    \ of ascending capability, to\n   reach \"full Internet connectivity\".\n   o\
    \  Web connectivity.\n      This service provides connectivity to the Web, i.e.,\
    \ to services\n      supported through a \"Web browser\" (such as Firefox, Internet\n\
    \      Explorer, Mozilla, Netscape, Lynx, or Opera), particularly those\n    \
    \  services using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols.  Other services are\n      generally\
    \ not supported.  In particular, there may be no access to\n      POP3 or IMAP4\
    \ email, encrypted tunnels or other VPN mechanisms.\n      The addresses used\
    \ may be private and/or not globally reachable.\n      They are generally dynamic\
    \ (see the discussion of dynamic\n      addresses in Section 3 for further discussion\
    \ of this terminology\n      and its implications) and relatively short-lived\
    \ (hours or days\n      rather than months or years).  These addresses are often\
    \ announced\n      as \"dynamic\" to those who keep lists of dial-up or dynamic\n\
    \      addresses.  The provider may impose a filtering Web proxy on the\n    \
    \  connections; that proxy may change and redirect URLs to other\n      sites\
    \ than the one originally specified by the user or embedded\n      link.\n   o\
    \ Client connectivity only, without a public address.\n      This service provides\
    \ access to the Internet without support for\n      servers or most peer-to-peer\
    \ functions.  The IP address assigned\n      to the customer is dynamic and is\
    \ characteristically assigned from\n      non-public address space.  Servers and\
    \ peer-to-peer functions are\n      generally not supported by the network address\
    \ translation (NAT)\n      systems that are required by the use of private addresses.\
    \  (The\n      more precise categorization of types of NATs given in [2] are\n\
    \      somewhat orthogonal to this document, but they may be provided as\n   \
    \   additional terms, as described in Section 4.)\n      Filtering Web proxies\
    \ are common with this type of service, and\n      the provider SHOULD indicate\
    \ whether or not one is present.\n   o Client only, public address.\n      This\
    \ service provides access to the Internet without support for\n      servers or\
    \ most peer-to-peer functions.  The IP address assigned\n      to the customer\
    \ is in the public address space.  It is usually\n      nominally dynamic or otherwise\
    \ subject to change, but it may not\n      change for months at a time.  Most\
    \ VPN and similar connections\n      will work with this service.  The provider\
    \ may prohibit the use of\n      server functions by either legal (contractual)\
    \ restrictions or by\n      filtering incoming connection attempts.\n      Filtering\
    \ Web proxies are uncommon with this type of service, and\n      the provider\
    \ SHOULD indicate if one is present.\n   o Firewalled Internet Connectivity.\n\
    \      This service provides access to the Internet and supports most\n      servers\
    \ and most peer-to-peer functions, with one or (usually)\n      more static public\
    \ addresses.  It is similar to \"Full Internet\n      Connectivity\", below, and\
    \ all of the qualifications and\n      restrictions described there apply.  However,\
    \ this service places\n      a provider-managed \"firewall\" between the customer\
    \ and the public\n      Internet, typically at customer request and at extra cost\
    \ compared\n      to non-firewalled services.  Typically by contractual arrangements\n\
    \      with the customer, this may result in blocking of some services.\n    \
    \  Other services may be intercepted by proxies, content-filtering\n      arrangements,\
    \ or application gateways.  The provider SHOULD\n      specify which services\
    \ are blocked and which are intercepted or\n      altered in other ways.\n   \
    \   In most areas, this service arrangement is offered as an add-on,\n      extra-cost,\
    \ option with what would otherwise be Full Internet\n      Connectivity.  It is\
    \ distinguished from the models above by the\n      fact that any filtering or\
    \ blocking services are ultimately\n      performed at customer request, rather\
    \ than being imposed as\n      service restrictions.\n   o Full Internet Connectivity.\n\
    \      This service provides the user full Internet connectivity, with\n     \
    \ one or more static public addresses.  Dynamic addresses that are\n      long-lived\
    \ enough to make operating servers practical without\n      highly dynamic DNS\
    \ entries are possible, provided that they are\n      not characterized as \"\
    dynamic\" to third parties.\n      Filtering Web proxies, interception proxies,\
    \ NAT, and other\n      provider-imposed restrictions on inbound or outbound ports\
    \ and\n      traffic are incompatible with this type of service.  Servers on a\n\
    \      connected customer LAN are typically considered normal.  The only\n   \
    \   compatible restrictions are bandwidth limitations and prohibitions\n     \
    \ against network abuse or illegal activities.\n"
- title: 3.  Filtering or Security Issues and Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Filtering or Security Issues and Terminology\n   As mentioned in the Introduction,\
    \ the effort to control or limit\n   objectionable network traffic has led to\
    \ additional restrictions on\n   the behavior and capabilities of internet services.\
    \  Such\n   objectionable traffic may include unsolicited mail of various types\n\
    \   (including \"spam\"), worms, viruses, and their impact, and in some\n   cases,\
    \ specific content.\n   In general, significant restrictions are most likely to\
    \ be\n   encountered with Web connectivity and non-public-address services,\n\
    \   but some current recommendations would apply restrictions at all\n   levels.\
    \  Some of these mail restrictions may prevent sending outgoing\n   mail (except\
    \ through servers operated by the ISP for that purpose),\n   may prevent use of\
    \ return addresses of the user's choice, and may\n   even prevent access to mail\
    \ repositories (other than those supplied\n   by the provider) by remote-access\
    \ protocols such as POP3 or IMAP4.\n   Because users may have legitimate reasons\
    \ to access remote file\n   services, remote mail submission servers (or, at least,\
    \ to use their\n   preferred email addresses from multiple locations), and to\
    \ access\n   remote mail repositories (again, a near-requirement if a single\n\
    \   address is to be used), it is important that providers disclose the\n   services\
    \ they are making available and the filters and conditions\n   they are imposing.\n\
    \   Several key issues in email filtering are of particular importance.\n   o\
    \ Dynamic Addresses.\n      A number of systems, including several \"blacklist\"\
    \ systems, are\n      based on the assumption that most undesired email originates\
    \ from\n      systems with dynamic addresses, especially dialup and home\n   \
    \   broadband systems.  Consequently, they attempt to prevent the\n      addresses\
    \ from being used to send mail, or perform some other\n      services, except\
    \ through provider systems designated for that\n      purpose.\n      Different\
    \ techniques are used to identify systems with dynamic\n      addresses, including\
    \ provider advertising of such addresses to\n      blacklist operators, heuristics\
    \ that utilize certain address\n      ranges, and inspection of reverse-mapping\
    \ domain names to see if\n      they contain telltale strings such as \"dsl\"\
    \ or \"dial\".  In some\n      cases, the absence of a reverse-mapping DNS address\
    \ is taken as an\n      indication that the address is \"dynamic\".  (Prohibition\
    \ on\n      connections based on the absence of a reverse-mapping DNS record\n\
    \      was a technique developed for FTP servers many years ago; it was\n    \
    \  found to have fairly high rates of failure, both prohibiting\n      legitimate\
    \ connection attempts and failing to prevent illegitimate\n      ones).  Service\
    \ providers SHOULD describe what they are doing in\n      this area for both incoming\
    \ and outgoing message traffic, and\n      users should be aware that, if an address\
    \ is advertised as\n      \"dynamic\", it may be impossible to use it to send\
    \ mail to an\n      arbitrary system even if Full Internet Connectivity is otherwise\n\
    \      provided.\n   o  Non-public addresses and NATs.\n      The NAT systems\
    \ that are used to map between private and public\n      address spaces may support\
    \ connections to distant mail systems for\n      outbound and inbound mail, but\
    \ terms of service often prohibit the\n      use of systems not supplied by the\
    \ connectivity provider and\n      prohibit the operation of \"servers\" (typically\
    \ not precisely\n      defined) on the client connection.\n   o Outbound port\
    \ filtering from the provider.\n      Another common technique involves blocking\
    \ connections to servers\n      outside the provider's control by blocking TCP\
    \ \"ports\" that are\n      commonly used for messaging functions.  Different\
    \ providers have\n      different theories about this.  Some prohibit their customers\
    \ from\n      accessing external SMTP servers for message submission, but they\n\
    \      permit the use of the mail submission protocol ([3]) with sender\n    \
    \  authentication.  Others try to block all outgoing messaging-\n      related\
    \ protocols, including remote mail retrieval protocols;\n      however, this is\
    \ less common with public-address services than\n      those that are dependent\
    \ on private addresses and NATs.  If this\n      type of filtering is present,\
    \ especially with \"Client only, public\n      address\" and \"Full Internet Connectivity\"\
    \ services, the provider\n      MUST indicate that fact (see also Section 4).\n\
    \      Still others may divert (reroute) outbound email traffic to their\n   \
    \   own servers, on the theory that this eliminates the need for\n      reconfiguring\
    \ portable machines as they connect from a different\n      network location.\
    \  Again, such diversion MUST be disclosed,\n      especially since it can have\
    \ significant security and privacy\n      implications.\n      More generally,\
    \ filters that block some or all mail being sent to\n      (or submitted to) remote\
    \ systems (other than via provider-\n      supported servers), or that attempt\
    \ to divert that traffic to\n      their own servers, are, as discussed above,\
    \ becoming common and\n      SHOULD be disclosed.\n"
- title: 4.  Additional Terminology
  contents:
  - "4.  Additional Terminology\n   These additional terms, while not as basic to\
    \ understanding a service\n   offering as the ones identified above, are listed\
    \ as additional\n   information that a service provider might choose to provide\
    \ to\n   complement those general definitions.  A potential customer might use\n\
    \   those that are relevant to construct a list of specific questions to\n   ask,\
    \ for example.\n   o Version support.\n      Does the service include IPv4 support\
    \ only, both IPv4 and IPv6\n      support, or IPv6 support only?\n   o Authentication\
    \ support.\n      Which technical mechanism(s) are used by the service to establish\n\
    \      and possibly authenticate connections?  Examples might include\n      unauthenticated\
    \ DHCP, PPP, RADIUS, or HTTP interception.\n   o VPNs and Tunnels.\n      Is IPSec\
    \ blocked or permitted?  Are other tunneling techniques at\n      the IP layer\
    \ or below, such as L2TP, permitted?  Is there any\n      attempt to block applications-layer\
    \ tunnel mechanisms such as SSH?\n   o Multicast support\n      Does the user\
    \ machine have access to multicast packets and\n      services?\n   o DNS support.\n\
    \      Are users required to utilize DNS servers provided by the service\n   \
    \   provider, or are DNS queries permitted to reach arbitrary servers?\n   o IP-related\
    \ services.\n      Are ICMP messages to and from end user sites generally blocked\
    \ or\n      permitted?  Are specific functions such as ping and traceroute\n \
    \     blocked and, if so, at what point in the network?\n   o Roaming support.\n\
    \      Does the service intentionally include support for IP roaming and,\n  \
    \    if so, how is this defined?  For \"broadband\" connections, is some\n   \
    \   dialup arrangement provided for either backup or customer travel?\n      If\
    \ present, does that arrangement have full access to mailboxes,\n      etc.\n\
    \   o Applications services provided.\n      Are email services and/or Web hosting\
    \ provided as part of the\n      service, and on what basis?  An email services\
    \ listing should\n      identify whether POP3, IMAP4, or Web access are provided\
    \ and in\n      what combinations, and what types of authentication and privacy\n\
    \      services are supported or required for each.\n   o Use and Blocking of\
    \ Outbound Applications Services.\n      Does the service block use of SMTP or\
    \ mail submission to other\n      than its own servers or intercept such submissions\
    \ and route them\n      to its servers?  Do its servers restrict the user to use\
    \ of its\n      domain names on outbound email?  (For email specifically, also\
    \ see\n      Section 3 above.)  Is the FTP PASV command supported or blocked?\n\
    \      Are blocks or intercepts imposed on other file sharing or file\n      transfer\
    \ mechanisms, on conferencing applications, or on private\n      applications\
    \ services?\n      More generally, the provider should identify any actions of\
    \ the\n      service to block, restrict, or alter the destination of, the\n  \
    \    outbound use (i.e., the use of services not supplied by the\n      provider\
    \ or on the provider's network) of applications services.\n   o Blocking of Inbound\
    \ Applications Services.\n      In addition to issues raised by dynamic or private\
    \ address space\n      (when present), does the service take any other measures\
    \ that\n      specifically restrict the connections that can be made to\n    \
    \  equipment operated by the customer?  Specifically, are inbound\n      SMTP,\
    \ HTTP or HTTPS, FTP, or various peer-to-peer or other\n      connections (possibly\
    \ including applications not specifically\n      recognized by the provider) prohibited\
    \ and, if so, which ones?\n   o Application Content Filtering.\n      The service\
    \ should declare whether it provides filtering or\n      protection against worms\
    \ or denial of service attacks against its\n      customers, virus and spam filtering\
    \ for its mail services (if\n      any), non-discretionary or \"parental control\"\
    \ filtering of\n      content, and so on.\n   o Wiretapping and interception.\n\
    \      The service SHOULD indicate whether traffic passing through it is\n   \
    \   subject to lawful intercept, and whether the provider will make a\n      proactive\
    \ attempt to inform the user of such an intercept when\n      such notice is legal.\
    \  Analogous questions can be asked for\n      traffic data that is stored for\
    \ possible use by law enforcement.\n"
