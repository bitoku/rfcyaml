  - "1.  Introduction\n   MPEG Surround (Spatial Audio Coding, SAC) [23003-1] is an\n
    \  International Standard that was finalized by MPEG in January 2007.\n   It is
    capable of re-creating N channels based on M < N transmitted\n   channels and
    additional control data.  In the preferred modes of\n   operating the Spatial
    Audio Coding system, the M channels can either\n   be a single mono channel or
    a stereo channel pair.  The control data\n   represents a significantly lower
    data rate than the data rate\n   required for transmitting all N channels, making
    the coding very\n   efficient while at the same time ensuring compatibility with
    M\n   channel devices.\n   The MPEG Surround standard incorporates a number of
    tools that enable\n   features that allow for broad application of the standard.
    \ A key\n   feature is the ability to scale the spatial image quality gradually\n
    \  from very low spatial overhead towards transparency.  Another key\n   feature
    is that the decoder input can be made compatible to existing\n   matrixed surround
    technologies.\n   As an example, for 5.1 multi-channel audio, the MPEG Surround
    encoder\n   creates a stereo (or mono) downmix signal and spatial information\n
    \  describing the full 5.1 material in a highly efficient, parameterised\n   format.
    \ The spatial information is transmitted alongside the\n   downmix.\n   By using
    MPEG Surround, existing services can easily be upgraded to\n   provide surround
    sound in a backwards-compatible fashion.  While a\n   stereo decoder in an existing
    legacy consumer device ignores the MPEG\n   Surround data and plays back the stereo
    signal without any quality\n   degradation, an MPEG-Surround-enabled decoder will
    deliver high\n   quality, multi-channel audio.\n   The MPEG Surround decoder can
    operate in modes that render the multi-\n   channel signal to multi-channel or
    stereo output, or it can operate\n   in a two-channel headphone mode to produce
    a virtual surround output\n   signal.\n"

      entity to\n      which timing information is attributed.  In the case of audio,

    data can be subdivided\n   into configuration data contained in the SpatialSpecificConfig()\n
    \  (SSC) and the SpatialFrame(), which contains the MPEG Surround\n   payload.
    \ The configuration data can be signaled in-band or out-of-\n   band.  In the
    case of in-band signaling the SSC is conveyed in a\n   SacDataFrame() jointly
    with a SpatialFrame().  In the case of out-of-\n   band signaling, the SSC is

    into the downmix\n   stream (Section 4.1) or as individual elementary streams
    besides the\n   downmix audio stream (Section 4.2).\n   The buffer definition
    for AAC decoders limits the size of an AU, as\n   specified in [14496-3].  For
    high-bitrate applications that exceed\n   this limit, all MPEG Surround data MUST

    - "4.1.  Embedded Spatial Audio Data in AAC Payloads\n   [14496-3] defines the
      extension_payload() as a mechanism for\n   transport of extension data inside
      AAC payloads.  Typical extension\n   data include Spectral Band Replication
      (SBR) data and MPEG Surround\n   data, i.e., a SacDataFrame() in extension_payload()s
      of type\n   EXT_SAC_DATA. extension_payload()s reside inside the downmix AAC\n
      \  elementary stream.  The resulting single elementary stream is\n   transported
      as specified in [RFC3640].  As AAC decoders are required\n   to skip unknown
      extension data, MPEG Surround data can be embedded in\n   backwards-compatible
      fashion and be transported with the mechanism\n   already described in [RFC3640].\n
      \  The SacDataFrame() includes a SpatialFrame() and an optional header\n   that
      contains an SSC.  Any SSC in a SacDataFrame() MUST be identical\n   to the SSC
      conveyed via SDP for that stream.\n   No new mode is introduced for SpatialFrame()s
      being embedded into AAC\n   payloads.  Either the mode AAC-lbr or the mode AAC-hbr
      SHOULD be\n   used.  The additional Media Type parameters, as defined in\n   Section
      5.1, SHOULD be present when SpatialFrame()s are embedded into\n   AAC payloads.\n

      (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2\n   (2.0 channels)] of the downmix AAC elementary
      stream that is using\n   explicit backwards-compatible signaling.\n   Furthermore,
      the stream specifies the MPEG Surround Baseline Profile\n   at Level 3 (PLI55)
      and the MPS-config string contains the hexadecimal\n   representation of the

    - "4.2.  MPEG Surround Elementary Stream\n   MPEG Surround SpatialFrame()s can
      be present in an individual\n   elementary stream.  This stream complements
      the stream containing the\n   downmix audio data, which may be coded by an arbitrary
      coding scheme.\n   MPEG Surround elementary streams are packetized as specified
      in\n   [RFC3640].  The mode signaled and used for an MPEG Surround\n   elementary
      stream MUST be either MPS-hbr or MPS-lbr.  The MPS-hbr\n   mode SHALL be used
      when the frame size may exceed 63 bytes, e.g.,\n   when high-bitrate residual
      coding is in use.\n   The dependency relationships between the MPEG Surround
      elementary\n   stream and the downmix stream are signaled as specified in [RFC5583].\n
      \  The media clocks of the MPEG Surround elementary stream and the\n   downmix
      stream SHALL operate in the same clock domain, i.e., the\n   clocks are derived
      from a common clock and MUST NOT drift.  RTCP\n   sender reports MUST indicate
      that the stream timestamps are not\n   drifting, i.e., that a single sender
      report for each stream is\n   sufficient to establish unambiguous timing.  The
      sampling rate of the\n   MPEG Surround signal and the decoded downmix signal
      MUST be\n   identical.\n   If HE AAC is used as the coding scheme for the downmix,
      the RTP\n   clock-rate of the downmix MAY be the sampling rate of the AAC core,\n
      \  i.e., the clock-rate of the MPEG Surround elementary stream is an\n   integer
      multiple of the clock-rate of the downmix stream.\n   Note that separate RTP
      streams have different random RTP timestamp\n   offsets, and therefore RTCP
      MUST be used to synchronize the coded\n   downmix audio data and the MPEG Surround
      elementary stream.\n   For example:\n   a=group:DDP L1 L2\n   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP

    of the RTP\n   payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a suitable\n
    \  cryptographic integrity-protection mechanism.  Such a cryptographic\n   system
    may also allow the authentication of the source of the\n   payload.  A suitable
    security mechanism for this RTP payload format\n   should provide confidentiality,
    integrity protection, and source\n   authentication capable of at least determining
    if an RTP packet is\n   from a member of the RTP session.\n   The AAC audio codec
    includes an extension mechanism to transmit extra\n   data within a stream that
    is gracefully skipped by decoders that do\n   not support this extra data.  This
    covert channel may be used to\n   transmit unauthorized data in an otherwise valid
    stream.\n   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and\n
    \  payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the\n   application,
    the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.\n   Therefore, a single mechanism
    is not sufficient; although, if\n   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport
    Protocol (SRTP)\n   [RFC3711] is recommended.  Other mechanisms that may be used
    are\n   IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP\n   over
    TCP); other alternatives may exist.\n"
