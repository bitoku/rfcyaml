  - "Abstract\n   The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing reviews of\n\
    \   Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) since 2004.  This document discusses the\n   experience\
    \ and the lessons learned over the past 7 years of this\n   process.  The review\
    \ team initially reviewed the I-Ds before each of\n   the IESG telechats.  Since\
    \ late 2005, review team members have been\n   assigned to review I-Ds during\
    \ IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last\n   Call is necessary for the I-D.  The\
    \ same reviewer then reviews any\n   updates when the I-D is placed on an IESG\
    \ telechat agenda.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) was created personally\
    \ by the\n   General Area Director in 2004.  This document discusses the\n   experiences\
    \ and the lessons learned as the process has evolved over\n   the past 7 years.\
    \  The process described in this document reflects\n   that which was in place\
    \ at the time this document was published.\n   This process is likely to continue\
    \ to change over time.  The review\n   team has been retained by subsequent General\
    \ Area Directors.  It has\n   no official role in the IETF standards process,\
    \ except as a set of\n   individuals entitled, like everyone, to comment on Internet-Drafts\n\
    \   (I-Ds).  Its volunteers, including a secretary and the team of\n   reviewers,\
    \ serve at the invitation of the General AD.  Both the\n   reviews and the reviewer\
    \ names are public.\n"
- title: 2.  Who Are the Gen-ART Members?
  contents:
  - "2.  Who Are the Gen-ART Members?\n   The reviewers are typically individuals\
    \ that have a fair amount of\n   experience within various IETF Working Groups\
    \ (WGs), have authored WG\n   I-Ds and RFCs, and are often considered to be subject\
    \ matter experts\n   (SMEs) in their particular areas of work.  The current review\
    \ team is\n   comprised of such technical experts, including several WG chairs\
    \ as\n   well as past and current Internet Architecture Board (IAB) members.\n\
    \   Several past and current ADs have served as reviewers.  Two past\n   General\
    \ ADs have also served as reviewers, with one currently\n   serving.\n   Members\
    \ of the review team sometimes excuse themselves from the team\n   for various\
    \ reasons, typically due to \"day job\" demands.  However,\n   they often rejoin\
    \ (for periods of time) as their schedules allow.\n   Also, some reviewers remain\
    \ on the team, while their review workload\n   is decreased by assigning them\
    \ just one I-D (at Last Call time) to\n   review each month.  Section 11 provides\
    \ a list of currently active\n   reviewers, along with those who have served on\
    \ the review team in the\n   past.\n"
- title: 3.  Goals of Gen-ART
  contents:
  - "3.  Goals of Gen-ART\n   The original and continuing goal of the Gen-ART was,\
    \ and is, to\n   offload from the General AD some of the burden of IESG reviews.\
    \  The\n   load for the bi-weekly IESG reviews is often quite large;\n   occasionally,\
    \ there are more than 20 I-Ds scheduled for discussion in\n   a single telechat.\
    \  Thus, ADs also have less than a week's notice for\n   many of the I-Ds on the\
    \ telechat agenda.\n   Gen-ART was based on a model that had proved productive\
    \ in the\n   Operations (OPS) Directorate: quick review close to telechat time,\
    \ to\n   advise the AD on issues that remain serious.  By having a trusted\n \
    \  group of reviewers read and evaluate the I-Ds, the General AD would\n   be\
    \ able to concentrate on those I-Ds where there was a concern\n   expressed by\
    \ the reviewer.  The reviewers are expected to provide\n   feedback based on a\
    \ whole set of criteria, including the criteria\n   summarized in Section 4.3.\
    \  The overall objective is to ensure that\n   the I-Ds are well structured; can\
    \ be easily understood, at least at a\n   high level; and provide a reasonable\
    \ basis for implementation (for\n   I-Ds intended for the Standards Track).\n\
    \   While other area (and WG) directorates/review teams existed prior to\n   Gen-ART\
    \ and more have been established since Gen-ART, the roles of\n   each are fairly\
    \ distinct.  Thus, there is little overlap between the\n   goals and review criteria\
    \ for the various review teams.  It is also\n   very valuable for these other\
    \ review teams to operate independently.\n   For example, when both Gen-ART reviews\
    \ and Security Directorate\n   (SecDir) reviews raise the same sorts of concerns,\
    \ it's a clear red\n   flag that the I-D needs more work before progressing. \
    \ In addition,\n   due to the typical thoroughness (and objectiveness) of the\
    \ various\n   review teams' reviews, the sponsoring AD and document shepherd are\n\
    \   often able to work with the editors/WG (and vice versa, depending\n   upon\
    \ area and WG structure) to improve the overall quality of the\n   final I-D.\
    \  It should also be noted that some ADs take the Gen-ART\n   reviews into consideration\
    \ when preparing their own evaluations.\n   Statistics from the Gen-ART reviews\
    \ over the past 6+ years show a\n   trend of increased quality and readiness for\
    \ progression of I-Ds by\n   the time they are placed on the telechat agenda.\
    \  Additional\n   statistics are discussed in Section 6.\n"

- title: 4.1.  IETF Last Call Review Process
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IETF Last Call Review Process\n   While the original process was meant\
    \ only for reviews just before the\n   IESG telechat, the decision was made to\
    \ include IETF Last Call (LC)\n   reviews in early 2005.  Over time the latter\
    \ has proven to be quite\n   effective.  Assigning the I-Ds at IETF LC time typically\
    \ gives a\n   reviewer more time to review an I-D.  And, in some cases, the IETF\
    \ LC\n   version is the one to appear on the telechat.  Thus, by the time I-Ds\n\
    \   are added to the telechat agenda, a majority (typically at least 70%)\n  \
    \ have already been reviewed.  For those I-Ds that have been\n   up-versioned,\
    \ the amount of time dedicated to re-review depends upon\n   the review summary\
    \ for the IETF LC review.\n   The assignments at IETF LC time evolved to minimize\
    \ the gap between\n   LC announcements and assignment time, with the secretary\
    \ doing LC\n   assignments every Thursday night.  This typically allows the reviewer\n\
    \   at least one week and sometimes two to three weeks to complete the\n   review.\
    \  The reviews are obviously most helpful when done on or\n   before the end of\
    \ the IETF LC.\n   The Last Call assignments are done on a fairly strict round-robin\n\
    \   basis to ensure a fair workload amongst all the reviewers.  Reviewers\n  \
    \ that are unavailable (vacations, etc.) during the review period\n   timeframe\
    \ obviously are excluded from that round of assignments, but\n   remain in the\
    \ same queue position for the next round.  The order is\n   occasionally modified\
    \ to avoid assigning an editor/author or WG chair\n   their own I-Ds.  A reviewer\
    \ may also NACK an assignment if they feel\n   they may have some bias (although\
    \ corporate affiliations are not\n   considered to be sources of bias) or they\
    \ don't feel they can review\n   the I-D in a timely manner.\n   The assignment\
    \ process is completely manual, although a spreadsheet\n   tremendously facilitates\
    \ the process.  The details are described in\n   Section 5.  Ideally, this process\
    \ could be automated.  However,\n   manual intervention would still be required\
    \ to maintain the\n   appropriate available reviewer list (unless reviewers took\
    \ on the\n   task of maintaining their data in some sort of database).  Further\n\
    \   details on the tools necessary to automate the entire process are\n   provided\
    \ in Section 8.\n"
- title: 4.2.  IESG Telechat Review Process
  contents:
  - "4.2.  IESG Telechat Review Process\n   The process for reviewing I-Ds when they\
    \ appear on the IESG agenda is\n   as follows:\n   o  The \"nearly final\" IESG\
    \ meeting agenda generally appears on\n      Thursday night, less than one week\
    \ before the IESG telechat.  The\n      Gen-ART secretary uses this as the input\
    \ for the assignment\n      process.\n   o  For I-Ds reviewed at IETF Last Call,\
    \ a new review is only asked\n      for if the I-D is revised.  In this case the\
    \ reviewer, typically\n      the person who did the Last Call review, only needs\
    \ to check that\n      any open issues were resolved.  Often the draft will not\
    \ have\n      changed between IETF LC and the IESG telechat review.  Section 4.4\n\
    \      provides the step-by-step telechat review assignment process, with\n  \
    \    specific details on the maintenance of the review assignment data,\n    \
    \  which is in turn maintained in review spreadsheets (Section 5).\n"
- title: 4.3.  Form of Review
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Form of Review\n   Rather than invent new guidelines, the Gen-ART requirements\
    \ for the\n   form of a review stole liberally from \"Careful Additional Review\
    \ of\n   Documents (CARD) by Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS)\" [SIRS], making\n \
    \  adaptations for the special \"late, quick review\" case and the nature\n  \
    \ of the General Area's concerns.\n   Each review must start with a summary statement\
    \ chosen from or\n   adapted from the following list:\n   o  This draft is ready\
    \ for publication as a [type] RFC, where [type]\n      is Informational, Experimental,\
    \ etc.  (In some cases, the review\n      might recommend publication as a different\
    \ [type] than requested\n      by the author.)\n   o  This draft is basically\
    \ ready for publication, but has nits that\n      should be fixed before publication.\n\
    \   o  This draft is on the right track but has open issues, described in\n  \
    \    the review.\n   o  This draft has serious issues, described in the review,\
    \ and needs\n      to be rethought.\n   o  This draft has very fundamental issues,\
    \ described in the review,\n      and further work is not recommended.\n   o \
    \ Unfortunately, I don't have the expertise to review this draft.\n   The length\
    \ of a review can vary greatly according to circumstances,\n   and it is considered\
    \ acceptable for purely editorial comments to be\n   sent privately if it's obvious\
    \ that the I-D needs substantial\n   revision.  All substantive comments, however,\
    \ must be included in the\n   public review.  Wherever possible, comments should\
    \ be written as\n   suggestions for improvement rather than as simple criticism.\n\
    \   Explicit references to prior work and prior IETF discussion should be\n  \
    \ given whenever possible.\n   Reviewers are asked to review for all kinds of\
    \ problems, such as\n   basic architectural or security issues, Internet-wide\
    \ impact,\n   technical nits, problems of form and format (such as IANA\n   Considerations\
    \ or incorrect references), and editorial issues.  Since\n   these reviews are\
    \ on I-Ds that are supposed to be finished, the\n   review should consider \"\
    no issue too small\" -- but should cover the\n   whole range, from the general\
    \ architectural level to the editorial\n   level.\n   All reviews should apply\
    \ generally agreed-upon IETF criteria,\n   such as:\n   o  [RFC1958]: \"Architectural\
    \ Principles of the Internet\"\n   o  [RFC3426]: \"General Architectural and Policy\
    \ Considerations\"\n   o  [RFC3439]: \"Some Internet Architectural Guidelines\
    \ and Philosophy\"\n   o  ID-Checklist: The \"ID checklist\" document maintained\
    \ by the IESG\n   o  [RFC2223bis]: \"Instructions to Request for Comments (RFC)\
    \ Authors\"\n      as updated by [RFC-STYLE]: \"RFC Document Style\"\n   o  [RFC5226]:\
    \ BCP 26 - \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations\n      Section in RFCs\"\
    \n   o  [RFC3552]: BCP 72 - \"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security\n  \
    \    Considerations\"\n   o  Any other applicable architectural or procedural\
    \ documents.  It is\n      considered important that reviews give precise references\
    \ to such\n      criteria when relevant to a comment.\n   Of special interest\
    \ to the General area, because they do not fall\n   under any other area, are:\n\
    \   o  A clear description of why the I-D or protocol is useful to the\n     \
    \ Internet.\n   o  Adherence to IETF formalities, such as capitalized \"must\"\
    ,\n      \"should\", etc. in normative statements, per the ID-Checklist.\n   o\
    \  Useful and reasonable IANA considerations.  Ensure that all\n      necessary\
    \ registries are defined/referenced, and ensure definition\n      and compliance\
    \ with IANA assignment criteria.\n   o  Correct dependencies for normative references.\n\
    \   o  That the I-D is written in reasonably clear English.\n   o  Checking the\
    \ updates/obsoletes information.\n   o  Running idnits and checking the output.\n\
    \   o  Checking that things imported by reference, especially from other\n   \
    \   RFCs, make sense (notably definitions of terms, security\n      considerations,\
    \ and lists of criteria) and ensuring they are used\n      as intended by the\
    \ referenced document.\n   o  That examples (e.g., Fully Qualified Domain Names\
    \ (FQDNs),\n      telephone numbers, IP addresses) are taken from the right spaces.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Gen-ART Process Overview
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Gen-ART Process Overview\n   The following provides a general overview\
    \ of the Gen-ART process\n   along with some basic rules associated with assignments.\
    \  The very\n   precise details of the secretary's process are provided in Section\
    \ 5.\n   o  The availability of reviewers and the order of assignments for the\n\
    \      next round of Last Call document assignments are updated weekly\n     \
    \ and are available on the directory where all the assignments and\n      reviews\
    \ are cached.\n   o  At telechat assignment time, all previously reviewed I-Ds\
    \ are\n      assigned to the reviewer who reviewed them previously, assuming\n\
    \      that reviewer is available.  Otherwise, these I-Ds are assigned to\n  \
    \    a new person in the process described below.\n   o  The secretary attempts\
    \ to avoid assigning I-Ds that might conflict\n      with other IETF roles such\
    \ as WG chairs, other directorates, etc.\n      However, in the cases where the\
    \ secretary doesn't note the\n      conflict, the reviewer should notify the secretary\
    \ and Gen-ART\n      mailing list so another reviewer may be assigned.\n   o \
    \ It should be emphasized that assignment is never made according to\n      a\
    \ reviewer's technical specialty.  Even though it happens, when,\n      for example,\
    \ routing I-Ds fall on routing experts or MIB documents\n      fall on MIB doctors,\
    \ it is coincidental.  To the reviewer, the\n      choice looks random.\n   o\
    \  There is an attempt to evenly distribute I-Ds amongst reviewers at\n      LC\
    \ time by using a round-robin process, starting from where the\n      previous\
    \ week's assignments stopped.\n   o  Typically, there is no attempt made to actually\
    \ equalize the load,\n      as the length and complexity of the I-Ds are not taken\
    \ into\n      account in this process.  (Thus, a reviewer could end up with a\n\
    \      couple of hundred-page I-Ds, but this is statistically rare.)\n      However,\
    \ in the case of a reviewer that might receive more than\n      one new LC I-D\
    \ at one time, the secretary does try to ensure that\n      both are not large\
    \ I-Ds.\n   o  Once the assignments are made, the web pages that list the reviews\n\
    \      and the assignments are posted.  Since the telechat agenda is not\n   \
    \   published until the end of the day on the Thursdays prior to the\n      telechats\
    \ (i.e., one week prior), the secretary needs to complete\n      the assignments\
    \ on that Thursday evening.  This often requires\n      working later in the evening\
    \ and also requires an Internet\n      connection even when traveling.\n   o \
    \ If the reviewers notice any problems or conflict of interest, a\n      bargaining\
    \ process, shifting I-Ds from one reviewer to another,\n      takes place.  The\
    \ secretary updates the assignment files with any\n      new assignments.\n  \
    \ o  Once the review has been completed, the reviewer sends the review\n     \
    \ to the Gen-ART list, ideally using the template provided in the\n      review\
    \ assignment emails.  Typically, reviews are also sent to\n      authors, the\
    \ responsible AD, and the WG chairs/document shepherd.\n      The only case where\
    \ this might not be done is when there are no\n      issues found for a re-review\
    \ and none had been found on an initial\n      review.  Sending the review to\
    \ the authors, ADs, and/or WG chairs/\n      Proto Shepherds was originally voluntary\
    \ but is now considered\n      standard practice.  Reviewers may also send the\
    \ reviews to the\n      IETF discussion list, but that is entirely at the discretion\
    \ of\n      the reviewer, in which case the author must be copied on the\n   \
    \   review to ensure they see any follow-up discussion.  Reviewers may\n     \
    \ also send the comments to the WG; however, this typically causes\n      the\
    \ review to end up in the moderation queue, as most reviewers do\n      not want\
    \ to subscribe to the WG lists for the I-Ds they review.\n      Thus, it is expected\
    \ that any of the original recipients (i.e.,\n      authors, WG chairs/document\
    \ shepherd, or responsible AD) may\n      forward the review to the WG mailing\
    \ list if they believe it is\n      necessary.  In the past, sending these reviews\
    \ resulted in\n      confusion among the authors, who may not have been expecting\
    \ a\n      Gen-ART review and may not be familiar with Gen-ART.  Thus,\n     \
    \ reviewers are reminded to prepend to the email the description of\n      Gen-ART\
    \ and the purpose of the review.  This information is part\n      of the standard\
    \ template provided in the review assignment emails.\n   o  The secretary gathers\
    \ the reviews, sometimes edits them for\n      format, and records the review\
    \ in the spreadsheet on the web\n      pages, including the synopsis.  This is\
    \ typically done on\n      Thursday.  This is one aspect of the process that can\
    \ be easily\n      delegated such that one volunteer uploads all the reviews and\
    \ then\n      the secretary need only update the fields in the spreadsheet.  If\n\
    \      the reviewer has not provided a synopsis (\"Summary\" field in the\n  \
    \    template), the secretary makes a best guess based on the review\n      details.\
    \  Note that in most cases the reviewers do include a\n      synopsis.\n   o \
    \ Ideally, the reviews should be posted to the Gen-ART mailing list\n      by\
    \ close of business on the East coast on Tuesday.  This is\n      necessary to\
    \ allow the General AD time to consider the reviews\n      prior to the telechat.\
    \  If the reviews are received after Tuesday,\n      the review may not be read\
    \ by the AD before the IESG telechat.\n      Due to time constraints, the spreadsheets\
    \ containing review\n      summaries/assignments are only updated on Thursday\
    \ evenings when\n      the new LC assignments and upcoming telechat assignments\
    \ are done.\n      Ideally, the reviews would get uploaded on the Tuesdays prior\
    \ to\n      the telechat along with the updated spreadsheets.\n   o  If the AD\
    \ concludes that the concerns raised by the reviewer\n      warrant placing a\
    \ DISCUSS comment on the I-D, the AD will do so,\n      and the DISCUSS must be\
    \ resolved before the I-D advances.\n      Usually, the reviewer will be involved\
    \ in the resolution process,\n      but the responsibility for the DISCUSS rests\
    \ with the AD.\n"

    \ I-Ds at the time of assignment\n   and to capture all the reviews.  For IETF\
    \ LC assignments, the\n   assignments are completed before adding the I-Ds to\
    \ the spreadsheet\n   as described in Section 5.2.  For telechat assignments,\
    \ I-Ds are\n   obviously only added in the cases where there is no previous LC\n\
    \   assignment.  For the other I-Ds, the appropriate fields are updated\n   as\
    \ described in Section 5.3.\n   All the reviews can be accessed from the spreadsheet\
    \ via hyperlinks\n   from specific fields, as summarized below.  The following\
    \ information\n   is maintained in the spreadsheet (in the order listed):\n  \
    \ 1.  \"Chat/LC Date\": Indicates either the date on which the LC review\n   \
    \    is due or the date of the telechat.\n   2.  \"Document\": Filename for the\
    \ I-D, which includes a hyperlink to\n       the IETF I-D tracker.\n   3.  \"\
    Assigned\": Name of the reviewer assigned to that I-D.\n   4.  \"Category\": This\
    \ field contains one of the following self-\n       explanatory values: \"Doc\
    \ - WG\", \"Doc - Ind/AD\", or \"IETF LC\".\n       Note that Gen-ART does not\
    \ review I-Ds submitted directly to the\n       RFC Editor.  The \"IETF LC\" value\
    \ is of course entered for all\n       I-Ds at LC time.  It is changed to one\
    \ of the other appropriate\n       values, based on the information in the telechat\
    \ agenda.\n   5.  \"Previous Review\": This includes a link to any previous reviews.\n\
    \       For example, when a doc appears on a telechat agenda, if an IETF\n   \
    \    LC review was done, this field is updated with the review summary\n     \
    \  for the LC review (i.e., the information from the \"Current Review\n      \
    \ Summary\" as described below is copied to this column).  The field\n       is\
    \ set to \"New\" when an I-D is first assigned/added to the\n       spreadsheet.\
    \  In the case of returns, this field has a value of\n       \"Return\" or \"\
    Return/IETF-LC\" for I-Ds for which there is an LC\n       review.  It should\
    \ be noted that since Gen-ART started doing\n       reviews at LC time, there\
    \ seem to be far fewer returns on the\n       agenda.\n   6.  \"Current Review\
    \ Summary\": This field includes the review type and\n       version number of\
    \ the document that is to be reviewed or has been\n       reviewed (e.g., LC:\
    \ -02).  When the field also contains a review\n       summary after the review\
    \ type/version number (e.g., Telechat: -06\n       Ready), the active hyperlink\
    \ points to the review.  Occasionally,\n       a reviewer will re-review an I-D\
    \ prior to its telechat\n       assignment, in which case it is added to the spreadsheet,\
    \ but the\n       date does not change to maintain consistency in the date field,\n\
    \       since the reviews themselves contain the review date.\n   The following\
    \ summarizes the steps to add a new I-D to the\n   spreadsheet:\n   1.  In order\
    \ to optimize steps, blank rows are first inserted for the\n       number of new\
    \ I-Ds to be added.\n   2.  To minimize data entry, a row with default fields\
    \ (including the\n       hyperlinks) is kept at the end of the file.  There is\
    \ a separate\n       default row for IETF LC versus telechat assignments.  This\
    \ row is\n       copied into each of the new blank rows.  The dates are then\n\
    \       entered (this allows double-checking that all I-Ds from the\n       review\
    \ assignments are accounted for, especially LC).\n   3.  The I-D name is then\
    \ copied to the name field as well as being\n       appended to the hyperlink\
    \ for the \"Review Summary\" field.  The\n       hyperlink is included as part\
    \ of the default row.  This minimizes\n       the steps to enter the reviews in\
    \ the spreadsheet.\n   4.  The data is also sorted by \"Chat/LC Date\", \"Assigned\"\
    , and\n       \"Document\".  The file is then saved and closed.\n   5.  The file\
    \ is then reopened and saved as HTML.\n   6.  The file is opened a second time\
    \ and sorted by \"Assigned\",\n       \"Chat/LC Date\", and \"Document\" to provide\
    \ the I-D reviewers an\n       easy way to find any outstanding assignments.\n"

    \ any telechat\n   assignments.  This optimizes the process in terms of batch\
    \ changes to\n   files.\n   The assignments are listed in an HTML file.  The following\
    \ are the\n   steps in creating that file:\n   1.  The order of assignment is\
    \ actually created the week before, with\n       the details below.  Thus, before\
    \ starting the new assignments,\n       the current file is saved for editing\
    \ for the following week.\n       The current file-naming convention is \"reviewersyymmdd-lc.html\"\
    \n       (e.g., for July 8th, 2010, the file reviewers100708-lc.html was\n   \
    \    created, and the file for the following week is named\n       reviewers100715-lc.html).\n\
    \   2.  Since the file is already prepared with the appropriate ordering\n   \
    \    of reviewers, the assignments are done in the order of due dates.\n     \
    \  The link to the I-D in the Datatracker is copied into the\n       assignment\
    \ file along with the intended RFC status for each of\n       the new LC I-Ds.\n\
    \   3.  The \"Due Date\" paragraph from the Last Call announcement is\n      \
    \ shortened as follows: \"IETF LC ends on:\", keeping the date.\n   4.  Once the\
    \ assignment file is complete, the new I-Ds are added to\n       the spreadsheet\
    \ as described above.\n   5.  The assignment file for the next week is then updated\
    \ to reflect\n       the next reviewer in the round-robin process, by simply cutting\n\
    \       and pasting the names in the list in a block and removing any\n      \
    \ \"one doc per month\" reviewers (annotated with an \"*\") that have\n      \
    \ already received their monthly assignment.  If the next round of\n       assignments\
    \ occurs at the beginning of a new month, the \"one doc\n       per month\" reviewers\
    \ are added back into the list (in the normal\n       order -- alphabetically\
    \ by first name).\n   6.  The assignment files and updated spreadsheets are then\
    \ cached on\n       the Gen-ART server.\n   7.  An email providing a link to the\

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Telechat Assignment Procedure\n   Since LC assignments are now the starting\
    \ point for Gen-ART I-D\n   reviews, the telechat assignments are generally straightforward,\
    \ as\n   the majority of the I-Ds are already in the spreadsheet.  The\n   following\
    \ details the steps:\n   1.  The telechat agenda is typically available around\
    \ 6PM PDT.  In\n       order to create the assignment HTML file, the agenda is\
    \ created\n       from the email announcing the upcoming telechat agenda.  The\n\
    \       filename has the following format, with the date corresponding to\n  \
    \     the telechat date (versus the date of assignment, as is the case\n     \
    \  for Last Call assignments): \"reviewersyymmdd.html\".\n   2.  Rows are added\
    \ to the agenda for the reviewers' names.\n   3.  The reviewers' names are then\
    \ added to the weekly assignment\n       file.\n   4.  As each reviewer is added\
    \ to the assignment file, the review\n       spreadsheet is updated as follows:\n\
    \       *  \"Chat/LC Date\" is changed to the telechat date.\n       *  The link\
    \ to the LC review, if available, is copied as the link\n          for the \"\
    Previous Review\" column.\n       *  The \"text\" for the \"Current Review\" is\
    \ updated to reflect the\n          new review type (i.e., Telechat) and version.\n\
    \   5.  In the case of an I-D that did not go through IETF LC, a reviewer\n  \
    \     is assigned using the order in the file to be used for Last Call\n     \
    \  assignments for the next week.\n   6.  Once the reviewer(s) have been determined,\
    \ the LC assignment file\n       for the next week is updated.\n   7.  Any new\
    \ I-Ds are then added to the spreadsheet (and the updates\n       saved) per the\
    \ steps described in Section 5.1.\n   8.  The assignment files and updated spreadsheets\
    \ are then cached on\n       the Gen-ART server.\n   9.  An email providing a\

    \ volunteer is assisting the secretary in\n       caching the email reviews as\
    \ they arrive.\n   2.  In the cases where the review is included inline in the\

    \       saved with the reviewer's last name appended to the filename --\n    \
    \   e.g., draft-ietf-xyz-00-smith.txt.\n   3.  In the case where the review is\
    \ included as an attachment to the\n       email, the file can be directly saved\
    \ and uploaded.\n   4.  The volunteer uploads the reviews by around 5PM CST on\
    \ Thursdays;\n       thus, they are available to the secretary at the time that\
    \ week's\n       assignments are done.  This sequence is necessary to ensure the\n\

- title: 6.  Results
  contents:
  - "6.  Results\n   Over the past 7 years, the Gen-ART has provided reviewing services\
    \ to\n   3 ADs and has done around two thousand publicly available reviews.\n\
    \   The reviews have been executed with a team of around a dozen full-\n   time\
    \ reviewers and other reviewers receiving one I-D assignment each\n   month. \
    \ There are currently 9 reviewers in the latter category.  The\n   full-time reviewers\
    \ receive 2-3 assignments each month.  In terms of\n   improving quality, the\
    \ number of I-Ds that are now \"Ready\" at the\n   time of the telechat (since\
    \ the reviews are now initiated at LC time)\n   has increased.  The review term\
    \ \"Ready\" means the reviewer believes\n   that the document has no outstanding\
    \ editorial or technical issues.\n   Based on the data from 2007, there were over\
    \ 250 I-Ds assigned at LC\n   time that went through IESG review.  Of those 250\
    \ I-Ds, 82% of the LC\n   reviews (205 I-Ds) were completed.  Of the completed\
    \ reviews, 70%\n   (144 I-Ds) were \"Ready\" at the time of the telechat.  Of\
    \ those 144\n   I-Ds, roughly 1/4 had been deemed \"Ready\" (with no nits) at\
    \ LC time\n   (based on a sample of 50 reviews).  For the I-Ds that were not\n\
    \   reviewed at LC time, only about 1/4 of those were deemed \"Ready\" when\n\
    \   they were reviewed for the telechat.  So, doing the Gen-ART reviews\n   at\
    \ Last Call time does seem to improve the quality of the I-Ds for\n   the telechat.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Reviewers' Impressions
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Reviewers' Impressions\n   The following list of comments are excerpted\
    \ and edited from comments\n   sent in by the reviewers of Gen-ART in response\
    \ to the request:\n   \"We'd like to ask you each to write a few lines about your\
    \ personal\n   experience and lessons learned as a Gen-ART reviewer\".\n   o \
    \ We really do find problems, but we don't find problems with\n      most I-Ds.\n\
    \   o  Comments seem to be in three areas: editorial/grammar, editorial/\n   \
    \   what-the-heck-does-this-mean, and actual problems.  I'm seeing\n      fewer\
    \ reviews in the first category, which is a good thing.\n   o  It is becoming\
    \ rarer that we hear back \"these guys have suffered\n      enough; I'm voting\
    \ no objection\" (I'm remembering an LDAP I-D that\n      had been around so long\
    \ it had 2119 referenced AS A DRAFT -- some\n      people suffered a lot).\n \
    \  o  The direct assignment of reviews is necessary and effective.  It\n     \
    \ does not matter much as far as I can tell what scheme is used to\n      actually\
    \ do the assignment.\n   o  Folks are very open to the reviews that come out of\
    \ Gen-ART.  This\n      somewhat surprised me, because I have seen resistance\
    \ to outside\n      reviews in other cases.\n   o  The improvements that have\
    \ come about (for example, one of my\n      latest, an I-D about the SIPPING conference)\
    \ have made a big\n      difference to the comprehensibility and usability of\
    \ the I-Ds --\n      and provide a useful incentive to keep going.\n   o  Some\
    \ form of review like this is desperately needed.  While most\n      of the stuff\
    \ we see is good, every once in a while really bad\n      errors have made their\
    \ way all the way to IESG vote.\n   o  Reading this stuff is interesting.  I like\
    \ having a reason to read\n      a wide range of materials.\n   o  I am more than\
    \ convinced that this can be, and is, a valuable\n      process.  It is, in my\
    \ opinion, a pity that Senior IETF Reviewers\n      (SIRS) and so on did not take\
    \ off, because this late-stage\n      reviewing is a poor substitute for doing\
    \ the same thing at a much\n      earlier stage.  Very few of the drafts that\
    \ have come past my\n      screen are truly fully ready for IESG review.  It is\
    \ actually a\n      joy to find the occasional nugget that is both well written\
    \ and is\n      a proper technical job, such that the reviewer really can say\n\
    \      \"This is ready\".\n   o  I have certainly found the process intellectually\
    \ stimulating!  It\n      encourages me to take a wider interest in what is going\
    \ on in the\n      IETF, but consumes a fair bit of time to do a proper job, and\n\
    \      requires a very wide knowledge to be able to properly catch the\n     \
    \ cross-area implications: I hope (believe!) that this is something\n      that\
    \ one gets better at with experience and doing a few of these\n      reviews.\n\
    \   o  There is probably a very limited pool of people who have both the\n   \
    \   time and the inclination to keep on doing these reviews.  It does\n      require\
    \ a fair bit of dedication.\n   o  It is difficult to avoid correcting the English,\
    \ even if that is\n      not really the point: Often, really bad English (whether\
    \ as a\n      result of non-mother-tongue authors with limited grasp or mother-\n\
    \      tongue authors using informal language) obscures/corrupts what is\n   \
    \   being said or just makes it impossible to read.\n   o  Mostly authors welcome\
    \ the comments: I think most of them\n      understand the concept of \"ego-free\
    \ reviewing\", and we have\n      generally been constructive rather than destructive.\n\
    \   o  Part of the job of Gen-ART is to think the unthinkable from\n      another\
    \ point of view, to challenge (apparently undocumented)\n      assumptions, and\
    \ apply experience from other fields.\n"

  - "7.2.  General Area Directors' Impressions\n   It should be noted that these impressions\
    \ are from multiple General\n   Area Directors; thus, the \"I\"s are not necessarily\
    \ associated with a\n   specific AD.\n   o  It's essential.  The reviewing load\
    \ for the IESG <shout>DOES NOT\n      SCALE</shout>.\n   o  Without Gen-ART, I\
    \ would be a much less effective General AD.\n   o  On a single fortnight example,\
    \ the IESG had 21 drafts on the\n      agenda.  It is just impossible (to conscientiously\
    \ review all the\n      documents), and no wonder we sometimes miss serious issues.\n\
    \   o  So I think a distributed review team with about 30 trusted\n      reviewers\
    \ needs to be institutionalized.  I suspect that will need\n      to be formalized\
    \ in a BCP sooner or later -- with their reviews\n      having a formal position\
    \ in the standards process, and the\n      expectation that the whole IESG truly\
    \ reviews all I-Ds being\n      relaxed.\n   o  We've learned that polite, well\
    \ reasoned, constructive reviews are\n      very positively received by authors\
    \ and WGs.  Dismissive reviews\n      are counter-productive.  And reviews sent\
    \ in private eventually\n      show up in public, so it's better to go public\
    \ at the start.\n   o  Normally, LC reviews are available in good time for the\
    \ draft to\n      be revised before reaching the IESG agenda.  It is important\
    \ that\n      this happens, except for an emergency situation where the\n    \
    \  responsible AD has good reason to place the draft on the agenda\n      immediately.\
    \  In that case, it would be preferable for the AD to\n      inform the Gen-ART,\
    \ so that the review can be expedited.\n   o  The other problem is a big detail\
    \ -- between late Thursday or\n      early Friday when the secretary sends out\
    \ the assignments, and\n      Wednesday when the General AD likes to start filling\
    \ in ballots\n      based on the reviews received by close of business on Tuesday,\n\
    \      there are only three work days (plus possible volunteer time over\n   \
    \   the weekend).  Now even with only one I-D to review, that may be a\n     \
    \ real challenge.  Sometimes, a lucky reviewer will get 130 pages\n      (e.g.,\
    \ draft-ietf-nntpext-base-27).  That doesn't compute.\n   o  There are some mechanical\
    \ issues.  The process followed is far too\n      manual.  Everything needs to\
    \ be robotic except for the judgment\n      calls about which reviewer gets which\
    \ draft.  Similarly, the\n      reviewer should be able to just paste the review\

  contents:
  - "7.3.  Gen-ART Secretaries' Impressions\n   Serving as the secretary of Gen-ART\
    \ is a worthwhile experience.  From\n   a personal point of view, it gives the\
    \ secretary an easy way to track\n   all of the work going through the IESG review\
    \ process and see how the\n   work flowed through that process.  Also, by reviewing\
    \ and sometimes\n   creating the one-line abstracts that go on the review web\
    \ page, the\n   secretary has an opportunity to really get a survey of the work\
    \ being\n   approved by the IETF.\n   The nature of these reviews is informal,\
    \ and originally the reviews\n   were only intended for the General AD, though\
    \ they were made public.\n   During 2004, there was little if any interaction\
    \ between authors and\n   reviewers.  There was some discussion during 2004 about\
    \ trying to\n   expand the role of Gen-ART to a more formal, early-review model,\n\
    \   i.e., to evolve it into a form of SIRS.  The original Gen-ART\n   secretary\
    \ was against such a transformation, because she felt it\n   would put at risk\
    \ something that worked.  She believed that there\n   were risks inherent in formalizing\
    \ the reviews and adding mechanisms\n   for standardizing the resultant review\
    \ process.  Another concern\n   involves the interaction between reviewers and\
    \ authors.  As discussed\n   above, it has become the practice to send reviews\
    \ to the authors with\n   an explanation about the nature of Gen-ART reviews.\
    \  While it is\n   clear that this has resulted in improved RFCs, it has also\
    \ resulted\n   in increased workload for the reviewers.\n   The secretary thinks\
    \ that Gen-ART is an experiment that works well,\n   but she also believes it\
    \ is fragile.  The secretary is often\n   concerned about overburdening reviewers,\
    \ and feels it is her\n   responsibility to keep them from burning out.  Adding\
    \ additional\n   reviewers to the review team would help to alleviate this concern.\n\
    \   In terms of the process, adding additional reviewers has minimal\n   impact.\n"
- title: 8.  Needed Improvements

  - "8.  Needed Improvements\n   The current size of the review team introduces a\

    \   helpful to alleviate this workload.  It is also important to note\n   that\
    \ having additional reviewers adds minimal workload to the\n   secretary's process;\
    \ thus, the only blocking point is finding the\n   right folks that are interested\
    \ in this type of volunteer role.  As\n   noted in Section 7.2, 30 would be a\
    \ good size for the review team.\n   This would cut the workload for an individual\
    \ reviewer in half (given\n   the current model of 9 reviewers on the \"one doc\

    \ would be a good thing.  However,\n   Gen-ART secretaries are not necessarily\
    \ highly motivated to\n   transition to a more automated approach until a significant\
    \ part of\n   the process is automated.  In more recent consideration of this\n\

    \ the reviews, as that benefits the review team as a whole.\n   This automation\
    \ should allow the reviewers to enter the reviews via a\n   web interface that\
    \ would automatically generate the appropriate\n   emails -- quite similar to\
    \ how the draft \"Upload\" tool currently\n   works.  Also, given consistent naming\
    \ conventions for the review\n   forms, this step would automate some of the process\
    \ for the\n   secretary, as the reviews would automatically appear via the\n \
    \  spreadsheet hyperlinks, although there would still be a need to\n   manually\
    \ enter the summary.  But this would eliminate the need to\n   edit/normalize\
    \ and upload files and, hopefully, eliminate the problem\n   encountered with\
    \ unflowed text in emails and getting the review\n   properly formatted using\
    \ some text editors.\n   Section 5 was written to facilitate the process of determining\
    \ tools\n   requirements, by providing the very detailed steps currently applied\n\
    \   to the process.  As noted above, automating the upload of the reviews\n  \
    \ could be a good first step.  This is somewhat starting at the end of\n   the\
    \ process.  However, it seems that by automating in this direction,\n   we may\
    \ have optimal results; since one of the earliest steps in the\n   process is\
    \ the task of assigning reviewers, it likely needs the most\n   manual intervention,\
    \ even with tools available.\n   The current SecDir secretary does use some tools\
    \ for assignments and\n   generating assignment emails.  These tools could be\
    \ considered for\n   use by the Gen-ART secretary.  Since the SecDir reviews are\
    \ not\n   cached and the information maintained for those reviews is less\n  \
    \ detailed, there would be no reusability of that aspect.  However, if\n   the\
    \ Gen-ART spreadsheet can be automatically populated (with\n   assignments and\
    \ completed reviews), the SecDir may be able to make\n   use of that same tool.\n"
- title: 9.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "9.  Applicability\n   As implemented today, the process has no formal role in\
    \ the IETF\n   standards process.  But as trust in the review team has built,\
    \ and as\n   the team itself has learned to deliver reviews that are generally\n\
    \   well received, they have had a significant impact on I-D quality and\n   on\
    \ timeliness.  Rather than becoming a roadblock, they have (in\n   general) allowed\
    \ the General AD to feel more confident in reaching\n   decisions and be more\
    \ precise in resolving issues.  Since reviews now\n   typically appear during\
    \ IETF Last Call, the reviews, like the SecDir\n   reviews, are now generally\
    \ expected.  So, the role of the team has\n   evolved to be more formal than in\
    \ the past (i.e., when this document\n   was first drafted in 2005).  However,\
    \ the handling of the reviews\n   remains entirely within the scope of the ADs,\
    \ document shepherds, WG\n   chairs, and authors as they deem appropriate.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Since this is an informational I-D about an\
    \ open process, the\n   security considerations are specific to the process and\
    \ users\n   involved in the process.  The primary concern would be to limit the\n\
    \   people that have the ability to create and update the Gen-ART data/\n   files\
    \ to ensure that the integrity of the data is maintained.  For\n   example, each\
    \ Gen-ART reviewer should have a unique user name/\n   password, just as folks\
    \ do to access any other IETF-maintained data,\n   as appropriate.\n"
