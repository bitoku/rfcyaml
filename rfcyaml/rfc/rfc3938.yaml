  - "Abstract\n   The Message-Context header defined in RFC 3458 describes the context\n
    \  of a message (for example: fax-message or voice-message).  This\n   specification
    extends the Message-Context header with one additional\n   context value: \"video-message\".\n
    \  A receiving user agent (UA) may use this information as a hint to\n   optimally
    present the message.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Email messages can be used to convey many different forms
    of\n   messages, and the user will interact with different types in\n   different
    ways.  As explained in RFC 3458 [1], the \"message context\"\n   of the message
    conveys information about the way the user expects to\n   interact with the message,
    such as which icon to display.  RFC 3458\n   then registers the message contexts
    for a \"voice-message\", \"fax-\n   message\", \"pager-message\", \"multimedia-message\",
    \"text-message\", and\n   \"none\".\n"

  - "2.  Video Message\n   One form of email is a message that consists mostly of
    a video\n   stream.  Examples of services that send video email are those\n   connected
    to cell phones that capture video streams, and video email\n   services that use
    webcams attached to a PC.  These email messages\n   currently consist of two flavors,
    both of which can be properly\n   considered a video message:\n   1. those that
    embed the video stream internally within the message as\n      a body part, and\n
    \  2. those whose video stream is stored on a third party's video\n      server.\n
    \  However, none of the existing message contexts properly identify such\n   video
    messages.  This specification extends the Message-Context\n   header with one
    additional context value: video-message.\n"
