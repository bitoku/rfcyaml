  - "User Accounts for UCSB On-line System                     UCSB\n        For the\
    \ past year UCSB has provided free use of the UCSB\n        On-line System to\
    \ Network sites.  Recharges for this\n        service are being paid for by the\
    \ Computer Research Lab\n        with funds out of our current ARPA contract.\
    \  Connect\n        time for the month of April totaled 152 hours.\n        Presently,\
    \ all users are running on the same account:\n        User Number=196, ID Code=57372,\
    \ User Name=ARPA.  As\n        such, it is difficult to monitor the amount of\
    \ use by\n        each site.  Consequently, we are changing the login\n      \
    \  procedure for Network users, effective 1 June 72.\n        Commencing June\
    \ 1, the new login parameters will be:\n           User Number=196\n         \
    \  ID=57372\n           User Name=<site destination>\n           Job Name=<your\
    \ name> (NIC ID will suffice).\n        The appropriate site designation is listed\
    \ at the end of\n        this RFC for each affilliation presently connected to\n\
    \        the ARPA network.  Any site omitted from this list which\n        plans\
    \ on running at UCSB should contact me at (805)\n        961-3793.\n        Network\
    \ users of the UCSB On-line System are reminded\n        that these free accounts\
    \ are provided for Network\n        experimentation.  We also encourage use of\
    \ this service\n        on a casual basis inorder that users unfamiliar with the\n\
    \        Culler-Fried System may acquaint themselves with some of\n        the\
    \ facilities available.  However, sites intending to\n        use the system on\
    \ a production basis are requested to\n        open a private account to which\
    \ computer charges can be\n        billed.\n        We will also continue to provide\
    \ free remote batch\n        support on a limited basis.  Again, this service\
    \ is\n        provided as a convenience to Network sites who are\n        attempting\
    \ to implement and debug Network software.\n        Sites submitting production\
    \ jobs will be expected to\n        open a Computer Center account and pay for\
    \ computer\n        charges billed to that account.\n              Affilliation\
