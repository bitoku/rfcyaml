  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo specifies a frame format for transmission of IPv6
    [IPV6]\n   packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local and statelessly\n
    \  autoconfigured addresses on ARCnet networks. It also specifies the\n   content
    of the Source/Target Link-layer Address option used by the\n   Router Solicitation,
    Router Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation,\n   Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect
    messages described in [DISC],\n   when those messages are transmitted on an ARCnet.\n
    \     The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\n
    \     NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"\n
    \     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\n      [KWORD].\n"
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Frame Format\n   IPv6 packets are link layer fragmented and reassembled according
    to\n   [PHDS]. A brief but sufficient discussion of this fragmentation\n   method
    can be found in [ARCIPV4].\n   The protocol ID (System Code in ARCnet terminology)
    assigned to IPv6\n   is C4 hexadecimal.\n"
  title: 2. Frame Format
- contents:
  - "3. Maximum Transmission Unit\n   The maximum IPv6 packet length possible using
    this encapsulation\n   method is 60480 octets. Since this length is impractical
    because of\n   its worst case transmission time of several seconds, all ARCnet\n
    \  implementations on a given ARCnet network should agree on a smaller\n   value.\n
    \  The default MTU for IPv6 [IPV6] packets on an ARCnet is 9072 octets.\n   In
    the presence of a router, this size MAY be changed by a Router\n   Advertisement
    [DISC] containing an MTU option. If a Router\n   Advertisement is received with
    an MTU option specifying an MTU larger\n   than 60480, or larger than a manually
    configured value less than\n   60480, that MTU option may be logged to system
    management but MUST be\n   otherwise ignored.\n   If no router is available, the
    local MTU MUST be left at 9072 or MUST\n   be manually configured to the same
    different value on all connected\n   stations.\n   Implementations MAY accept
    arriving IPv6 datagrams which are larger\n   than their configured maximum transmission
    unit.  They are not\n   required to discard such datagrams. If they can not handle
    larger\n   datagrams, they MAY log the event to the system administration, but\n
    \  MUST otherwise silently discard them.\n"

  - "4. Stateless Auto-configuration\n   If a node has an EUI-64 which is not used
    to form the Interface\n   Identifier for any other interface, it SHOULD use that
    EUI-64 to form\n   the Interface Identifier for its ARCnet interface.  If that
    EUI-64 is\n   in use for another interface attached to a different link, it MAY
    be\n   used for the ARCnet interface as well.\n   The Interface Identifier is
    then formed from the EUI-64 by\n   complementing the \"Universal/Local\" (U/L)
    bit, which is the next-\n   to-lowest order bit of the first octet of the EUI-64.\n
    \  When a node has no EUI-64 available for forming its ARCnet Interface\n   Identifer,
    it MUST form that identifier as specified in [AARCH],\n   Appendix A, section
    \"Links with Non-Global Identifier\".  That is, the\n   8 bit manually configured
    ARCnet address is appended to the 56 zero\n   bits.\n   For example, for an ARCnet
    interface with the configured address of\n   49 hexadecimal this results in the
    following identifier:\n   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4
    \             6|\n   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|\n
    \  +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n   |0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000001001001|\n
    \  +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+\n   Note
    that this results in the universal/local bit set to \"0\" to\n   indicate local
    scope.\n   An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless auto-configuration [ACONF]\n
    \  of an ARCnet interface MUST have a length of 64 bits.\n"
