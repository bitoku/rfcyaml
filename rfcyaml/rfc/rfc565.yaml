  - "            Storing Network Survey Data at the Datacomputer\n   In November,\
    \ 1972, Computer Corporation of America (CCA) and the\n   Programming Technology\
    \ Division of the Dynamics Modeling System (DMS)\n   at M.I.T.'s Project MAC began\
    \ planning to transmit to CCA's\n   datacomputer [1] information about the behavior\
    \ of ARPA network hosts\n   collected by DMS's program SURVEY [2].  The information\
    \ was to be\n   stored at the datacomputer and retrieved by an interactive program\n\
    \   that would address the datacomputer from DMS's PDP-10.\n   One goal of this\
    \ joint project was to enable DMS to retain all of the\n   information that SURVEY\
    \ collects: SURVEY had been running since late\n   1971, saving only a short daily\
    \ summary of its findings and\n   discarding potentially useful details.  A second\
    \ goal was to discover\n   and remove shortcomings in the interface between CCA's\
    \ datacomputer\n   and a program running at a remote host.\n   The project was\
    \ completed last month, and the programs described in\n   this document have been\
    \ operating successfully with the datacomputer\n   since July 10.\n   Part 1,\
    \ below, describes SURVEY's output.  Part 2 describes a program\n   that retrieves\
    \ portions of that output from the datacomputer.\n"

  - "Part 1: The Survey Database\n   Every twenty minutes, DMS's program SURVEY wakes\
    \ up and performs the\n   initial connection protocol from the PDP-10 at DMS to\
    \ the logger\n   socket (socket 1) of each 28 network hosts.\n   SURVEY records\
    \ a date time, host, status,and response time for each\n   host.  A host may be\
    \ in one of these states:\n      undetermined or not surveyed\n      disconnect\
    \ from the network or dead\n      network control program not responding\n   \
    \   ICP to logger aborted by the host\n      ICP to logger timed out by SURVEY\
    \ after 20 seconds\n      logger available and responding within 20 seconds\n\
    \   SURVEY records response times responding in tenths of seconds.\n   When the\
    \ data for all 28 hosts has been assembled, SURVEY transmits\n   that data to\
    \ CCA's datacomputer.  If for some reason the datacomputer\n   cannot accept the\
    \ information, it is held at DMS and sent another\n   time.\n   The datacomputer's\
    \ survey database is inverted by host, status,\n   month, and year.  That is to\
    \ say that the datacomputer maintains\n   several indices to records of one attempt\
    \ to establish a full duplex\n   connection to one host's logger: it maintains\
    \ one such index for each\n   host, one for each status, one for each month, and\
    \ one for each year.\n   The datacomputer can select records that are specified\
    \ in boolean\n   expressions by performing boolean operations on the inversion,\
    \ and\n   without consulting the data itself.  The inversion thus facilitates\n\
    \   rapid interaction between the survey retrieval program described\n   below\
    \ and the survey database at the datacomputer.\n   SURVEY expresses the record\
    \ of each attempt to access one host in 17\n   ASCII characters.  The record of\
    \ one survey then occupies 17 * 28 =\n   476 characters, and each day the datacomputer\
    \ receives 3 * 24 * 476 =\n   34,272 characters from DMS.\n"

  - "Part 2: Retrieving Survey Data\n   A Program called SURRET, written at DMS in\
    \ the language MUDDLE,\n   allows one to selectively retrieve material from the\
    \ survey data base\n   stored at the datacomputer [3].  Its user may specify values,\
    \ groups\n   of values, or, where appropriate, upper and lower bounds for values\n\
    \   of each of five fields: host name, date, time, response time, and\n   host\
    \ status.  In addition, one may request that all five fields or\n   any subset\
    \ of the five be retrieved.  A sample interaction with\n   SURRET is reproduced\

    \   SURRET generates datalanguage, sends it to the datacomputer, and\n   processes\
