Abstract ITU T Recommendation H.323 version 4 introduced an H.323 specific Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
This document reproduces the H323  URL definition found in H.323, and is published as an RFC for ease of access and registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].
ITU T Recommendations H.323 [3] and H.225.0 [4] define a system for multimedia communications services over packet based networks.
H.225.0 [4] defines an alias type for carrying any standard Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
H.323 version 4 [3] introduced an H.323  specific URL, which may be used to resolve the address of a network entity to which H.323 calls may be directed.
This document reproduces the H323 URL definition found in ITU T recommendation H.323 [3] and is published as an RFC for ease of access and IANA registration.
URL Scheme Formal Syntax Definition and Character Encoding
The H.323 URL is defined in ABNF as shown below.
Note that it utilizes the Core Rules specified in section 6.1 of [2].
(%x21 24 / %x26 3A / %x3C
7F / escaped) ; Specific parameter definitions are for ; further study.
The host is case insensitive.
The "user" is a Unicode [8] string that shall be UTF 8
[7] encoded and then escaped as necessary.
In the "user" field, the characters with a numeric value below 0x80 are case insensitive and
the characters with a numeric value above or equal to 0x80 are case sensitive.
The character set and case sensitivity of the "url parameter" is specified in each parameter definition.
The H.323 URL is intended to help an entity resolve the address of another H.323 entity, where an "entity" may be a user, a device, or a service.
The "user" portion of the URL specifies an alias for the entity, without carrying any information about the location of the entity.
The "hostport", on the other hand, is the domain name of an Endpoint, Gatekeeper, Border Element, or other functional element to which H.323 calls may be directed or for which services may be performed.
Applications and/or protocols, which may use H.323 URL scheme H.323 URLs may be carried by other protocols, such as SIP [6] or TRIP [9].
H.323 URLs may be also contained within web pages or within XML data, which may be utilized by H.323 entities in order to initiate calls or perform services.
When an H.323 URL is carried within H.225.0
[4] messages, security is addressed by the H.235 security framework [5].
When an H.323 URL carried within other protocols (such as SIP [6]), the security is addressed within the corresponding protocol.
In general, security, as it relates to the usage and carriage of the H.323 URLs, is considered as an issue that should be addressed within scope of H.323 or other relevant protocols and is not within the scope of this document.
The purpose of this document is serving as a reference point for the purposes of registering the H.323 URL scheme with IANA.
Having the URL registered with IANA will ensure that there is no duplication of the URL scheme "h323".
This document reproduces the exact H323 URL definition as published in ITU T Recommendation H.323 [3].
