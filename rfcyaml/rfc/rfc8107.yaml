- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)\n\
    \   Namespace Identifier (NID) for Ad-IDs.\n   Ad-ID is the industry standard\
    \ for identifying advertising assets\n   across all media platforms (e.g., over\
    \ the air, online, over the top,\n   mobile, and place based).  Ad-IDs are unique\
    \ codes for each creative\n   advertising asset.  Those unique codes are applied\
    \ to all media.\n   Ad-IDs are an eleven-character ASCII string except for High\n\
    \   Definition (HD) or Three-Dimensional (3D) codes, which have an H or D\n  \
    \ as the 12th character.\n   Ad-ID also provides descriptive metadata about the\
    \ advertisement.\n   The metadata includes the advertiser, brand, product, commercial\n\
    \   title, product categorization, and other essential data about the\n   advertisement.\
    \  The metadata can be retrieved using the unique code.\n   See Appendix A for\
    \ additional background information.\n"
- title: 2.  URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Namespace Definition Template\n   Using the template in [RFC3406], the\
    \ namespace definition is as\n   follows:\n   Namespace ID:\n      adid\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n      Version 1\n      2016-03-22\n   Declared registrant of the\
    \ namespace:\n      Registering organization:\n         Advertising Digital Identification,\
    \ LLC\n         11020 David Taylor Drive, Suite 305\n         Charlotte, NC 28262-1103\n\
    \         USA\n      Contact:\n         URL: http://www.ad-id.org/contact\n  \
    \       Email: cs@ad-id.org\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The\
    \ identifier structure is an Ad-ID that consists of a unique\n      eleven-character\
    \ string or a unique twelve-character string (video\n      codes only).\n    \
    \  This string is divided into three parts:\n      1. A four-character alphanumeric\
    \ Company Prefix, not starting with\n         \"0\"\n      2. A seven-character\
    \ alphanumeric code\n      3. An optional one-character Video Format Identifier.\n\
    \            H - High Definition\n            D - Three-Dimensional\n      The\
    \ URN representation URN-ADID of an Ad-ID conforms to the\n      following syntax\
    \ (expressed using ABNF [RFC5234]):\n         URN-ADID = \"urn:adid:\" full-adid-identifier\n\
    \         full-adid-identifier =\n            full-adid-prefix full-adid-code\
    \ [full-adid-suffix]\n         full-adid-prefix = (ALPHA / %x31-39) 3*alphanum\n\
    \         full-adid-code = 7*alphanum\n         full-adid-suffix = \"H\" / \"\
    D\"\n         alphanum = ALPHA / DIGIT\n      Examples:\n         Standard Definition:\
    \ urn:adid:ABCD0001000\n         High Definition:     urn:adid:ABCD0001000H\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      [SMPTERP2092-1] specifies Advertising\
    \ Digital Identifier (Ad-ID)\n      representations.\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      The Registrar (Advertising Digital Identification, LLC)\
    \ is\n      responsible for managing the assignment of the Ad-ID and shall\n \
    \     ensure its uniqueness by checking the identifier against the list\n    \
    \  of existing identifiers.  In addition, each Ad-ID is associated\n      with\
    \ a its own unique URN-ADID.\n      Ad-ID Registrar has assigned \"adid\" as a\
    \ unique identifier.  It is\n      associated with a single URN-ADID.\n   Identifier\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      The assignment process guarantees that 'adids'\
    \ will not be\n      reassigned or reused, and the binding between the identifier\
    \ and\n      its resource is permanent.\n      These rules apply to this URN namespace.\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Ad-IDs are generated by the Ad-ID's\
    \ proprietary registration\n      procedures.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      Ad-ID URNs are resolved via URN resolvers that are maintained by\n    \
    \  the Ad-ID.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of\
    \ URN-ADID is defined by case-insensitive\n      string match.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN Syntax:\n      As specified above, the syntax of URN-ADID is a subset\
    \ of the URN\n      syntax specified in [RFC2141].\n   Validation mechanism:\n\
    \      The validity of a URN-ADID can be checked using Ad-ID's web\n      services.\
    \  For more information on Ad-ID's web services, please\n      refer to the following\
    \ links:\n        http://www.ad-id.org/user-support/faqs/faq-category/web-services\n\
    \        http://www.ad-id.org/ad-id-web-services-api-guide\n   Scope:\n      Ad-IDs\
    \ are centrally registered, globally unique identifiers of\n      advertising\
    \ assets that are used worldwide.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   Ad-IDs are intended for use in Internet applications,\
    \ where URNs are\n   routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.  There\
    \ is no direct\n   mapping from Ad-IDs to existing URN namespaces.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The primary registrants of Ad-IDs are advertisers\
    \ and agencies.  Ad-\n   IDs can be used by anyone to unambiguously identify advertising\n\
    \   assets and retrieve underlying metadata.  The primary benefits of its\n  \
    \ use are providing greater transparency and accountability in the\n   advertising\
    \ marketplace, helping to eliminate costly errors\n   associated with the inconsistent\
    \ use of advertising-asset identifiers\n   throughout the advertising supply chain,\
    \ and enabling a more granular\n   audience measurement across multiple platforms.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies the syntax of the Ad-ID\
    \ URN namespace and\n   makes no security representations.  However, note that\
    \ failure to\n   conform to the syntactic and lexical equivalence rules specified\
    \ in\n   [RFC3406] when using an Ad-ID as a criterion for accessing restricted\n\
    \   resources can result in granting unauthorized access.\n"
