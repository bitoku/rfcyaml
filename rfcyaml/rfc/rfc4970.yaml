  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 [OSPF] or OSPFv3 [OSPFV3]\n\
    \   routing domain to know the capabilities of their neighbors and other\n   routers\
    \ in the routing domain.  This can be useful for both the\n   advertisement and\
    \ discovery of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 capabilities.\n   Throughout this document, OSPF\
    \ will be used when the specification is\n   applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\
    \  Similarly, OSPFv2 or OSPFv3\n   will be used when the text is protocol specific.\n\
    \   OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to advertise\n   optional\
    \ router capabilities.  In the case of OSPFv2, all the bits in\n   this field\
    \ have been allocated so new optional capabilities cannot be\n   advertised. \
    \ This document proposes extensions to OSPF to advertise\n   these optional capabilities\
    \ via opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 and new LSAs in\n   OSPFv3.  For existing OSPF capabilities,\
    \ backward- compatibility\n   issues dictate that this advertisement is used primarily\
    \ for\n   informational purposes.  For future OSPF features, this advertisement\n\
    \   MAY be used as the sole mechanism for advertisement and discovery.\n"

    \ 32-bit\n   aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field\

  contents:

    \ 9 (link-scoped), type 10 (area-scoped),\n   or a type 11 (AS-scoped) opaque\
    \ LSA may be flooded.  For OSPFv3, the\n   S1 and S2 bits in the LSA type determine\

    \ router should also\n   advertise area-scoped LSA(s) into any attached Not-So-Stubby\
    \ Area\n   (NSSA) area(s).  An OSPF router MAY advertise different capabilities\n\
    \   when both NSSA area scoped LSA(s) and an AS-scoped LSA are\n   advertised.\
    \  This allows functional capabilities to be limited in\n   scope.  For example,\
    \ a router may be an area border router but only\n   support traffic engineering\
    \ (TE) in a subset of its attached areas.\n   The choice of flooding scope is\
    \ made by the advertising router and is\n   a matter of local policy.  The originating\
    \ router MAY advertise\n   multiple RI LSAs as long as the flooding scopes differ.\

  contents:
  - "3.  Router Information LSA Opaque Usage and Applicability\n   The purpose of\

    \ a single value or very few values.\n   It is not meant to be a generic container\

    \ the\n   TLVs in a single LSA and to keep the task of determining what has\n\
    \   changed between LSA instances reasonably simple.  Hence, discretion\n   and\
    \ sound engineering judgment will need to be applied when deciding\n   whether\
