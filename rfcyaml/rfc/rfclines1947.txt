This document describes a standard encoding for electronic mail [RFC822] containing Greek text and provides implementation guide  lines.
The standard is based on MIME [RFC1521] and the ISO 8859 7 character encoding.
Although the implementation of this standard is straightforward several non standard but "functional" though unlikely to inter operate alternatives are in common use.
For this reason we highlight common implementation and mail user agent setup errors.
In order to transfer Greek text via electronic mail the text is first translated into the ISO 8859 7 character set, and then encoded using either the Base64 (preferable for text that is mainly Greek) or the Quoted Printable (justifiable in cases where some Greek words appear inside predominately Latin text) method, as defined in MIME.
The following table provides most common Greek encodings (see also [RFC1345]): 0646 37 M7 51 MC 23 69

The column headers refer to the following character sets: 0646
The ISO 2DIS 10646 code.
37    PC code page 737 also known as 437G.
tions of this code page do not include capital letters with acute.
M7    Character set 8859 7 as implemented in Microsoft Windows 3.1, Microsoft Windows 3.11, and Microsoft Windows 95.
51    IBM code page 851.
The Greek code page implemented on the Apple Macintosh computers.
23    IBM code page 423 (EBCDIC CP GR).
69    IBM code page 869.
LG    Latin Greek (iso ir 19).
This page only contains the Greek cap  ital letters whose glyphs do not exist in the Latin alphabet.
The other capital letters are rendered using the equivalent Latin let  ter (e.g. "Greek capital letter alpha" is rendered as "Latin capi  tal letter A").
When mapping "Latin Greek 1" text to ISO 8859 7
the Latin capital letters should only be transcribed to the equivalent Greek ones if a suitable heuristic determines that the specific Latin letters are used to represent Greek glyphs.
G7    7 bit Greek (iso ir 88).
GO    Old 7 bit Greek (iso ir 18).
GC    Greek CCITT (iso ir 150).
28    Character set ISO 5428:1980 (iso ir 55).
The target character set ISO 8859 7:1987 (ELOT 928)
MIME Headers A mail message that contains Greek text must contain at least the following MIME headers:
MIME Version: 1.0 Content type: text/plain
; charset ISO 8859 7 Content transfer encoding:
In the future, when all email systems implement fully transparent 8 bit e mail as defined in RFC 1425 and RFC 1426
the message body encoding phase described in this standard will be no longer needed.
In this case the requisite MIME headers are modified as follows:
MIME Version: 1.0 Content type: text/plain
; charset ISO 8859 7 Content transfer encoding:
8BIT Even when RFC 1425 is used, Q or B encoding will continue to apply to message headers as detailed in the following section.
It is recommended, although not required, to support Greek encod  ing in mail headers as specified in RFC 1522.
Specifically, the B encoding format is to be the default method used for encoding Greek text in RFC 822 mail headers, and the Q encoding format the method to use for the exceptional case of encoding a single Greek word or letter in an otherwise Latin character based header.
Example Below is a short example of Quoted Printable encoded Greek email:
> MIME Version: 1.0 Content ID:
Wed Feb 14 18 49 50 EET 1996
Text/plain; charset ISO 8859 7 Content Transfer Encoding:
[RFC1428] (and unfortunately common practice) to set up an arrangement of mail user and transfer agents that allow end users to communicate with Greek e mail messages while violating a number of standards.
Such arrangements are unlikely to offer wide scale interoperability.
One common error is to arrange the rendering and composition of Greek messages by rigging a mail user agent hosted in an ISO 8859 1 environment to use a presentation font that contains Greek glyphs and a keyboard input method that generates Greek text using those glyphs.
The resulting messages begin with header items indicating contents in the ISO 8859 1 character set and include text in a totally different encoding.
Unfortunately this "solution" appears to "work" across similar systems and is widely used.
One other error is to tag Greek text generated on Microsoft Windows platforms as ISO 8859 7 without an intermediate translation phase.
It is important to note that the character set used by the Microsoft Windows Greek implementations is NOT the same as the ISO 8859 7 representation.
First of all, the character set used to represent Greek characters differs slightly from the ISO 8859 7 encoding (this difference was instrumented in order to rectify the appearance of an early version of Microsoft Word for Windows in which the end of section symbol clashed with the "Greek capital alpha with acute" glyph).
In addition, a number of 8 bit characters available on Greek Windows implementations are not part of the ISO 8859 7 character set.
Note that the ISO 8859 7 encoding is equivalent to the Greek Standards Organisation
