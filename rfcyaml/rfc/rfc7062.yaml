  - "1.  Introduction\n   Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) have become a mainstream\
    \ layer 1\n   technology for the transport network.  Operators want to introduce\n\
    \   control-plane capabilities based on GMPLS to OTN to realize the\n   benefits\
    \ associated with a high-function control plane (e.g.,\n   improved network resiliency,\
    \ resource usage efficiency, etc.).\n   GMPLS extends Multi-Protocol Label Switching\
    \ (MPLS) to encompass Time\n   Division Multiplexing (TDM) networks (e.g., Synchronous\
    \ Optical\n   NETwork (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Plesiochronous\n\
    \   Digital Hierarchy (PDH), and G.709 sub-lambda), lambda switching\n   optical\
    \ networks, and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber\n   to outgoing\
    \ port or fiber).  The GMPLS architecture is provided in\n   [RFC3945], signaling\
    \ function and Resource Reservation Protocol -\n   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)\
    \ extensions are described in [RFC3471]\n   and [RFC3473], routing and Open Shortest\
    \ Path First (OSPF) extensions\n   are described in [RFC4202] and [RFC4203], and\
    \ the Link Management\n   Protocol (LMP) is described in [RFC4204].\n   The GMPLS\
    \ signaling extensions defined in [RFC4328] provide the\n   mechanisms for basic\
    \ GMPLS control of OTN based on the 2001 revision\n   of the G.709 specification.\
    \  The 2012 revision of the G.709\n   specification, [G709-2012], includes new\
    \ features, for example,\n   various multiplexing structures, two types of Tributary\
    \ Slots (TSs)\n   (i.e., 1.25 Gbps and 2.5G bps), and extension of the Optical\
    \ channel\n   Data Unit-j (ODUj) definition to include the ODUflex function.\n\
    \   This document reviews relevant aspects of OTN technology evolution\n   that\
    \ affect the GMPLS control-plane protocols and examines why and\n   how to update\
    \ the mechanisms described in [RFC4328].  This document\n   additionally provides\
    \ a framework for GMPLS control of OTN and\n   includes a discussion of the implications\
    \ for the use of the PCE\n   [RFC4655].\n   For the purposes of the control plane,\
    \ the OTN can be considered to\n   be comprised of ODU and wavelength (Optical\
    \ Channel (OCh)) layers.\n   This document focuses on the control of the ODU layer,\
    \ with control\n   of the wavelength layer considered out of the scope.  Please\
    \ refer to\n   [RFC6163] for further information about the wavelength layer.\n"

- title: 3.1.2.  Multiplexing ODUj onto Links
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Multiplexing ODUj onto Links\n   The links between the switching nodes\
    \ are provided by one or more\n   wavelengths.  Each wavelength carries one OCh,\
    \ which carries one OTU,\n   which carries one ODU.  Since all of these signals\

    \   case where j=k, the ODUj is mapped into the OTU/OCh without\n   multiplexing.\n\
    \   The initial versions of G.709 referenced by [RFC4328] only provided a\n  \
    \ single TS granularity, nominally 2.5 Gbps.  [G709-2012] added an\n   additional\

    \ at one end of a link\n   and a 2.5 Gbps TS at the other, [G709-2012] requires\

    \ a set of layers in the\n   same way as SDH has been modeled, recent ITU-T OTN\
    \ architecture\n   progress [G872-2012] includes an agreement to model the ODU\

    \   connections.  This allows the links and nodes to be viewed in a\n   single\
    \ topology as a common set of resources that are available to\n   provide ODUj\
    \ connections independent of the value of j.  Note that\n   when the bit rate\

  - "5.1.  Implications for Label Switched Path (LSP) Hierarchy\n   The path computation\
    \ for an ODU connection request is based on the\n   topology of the ODU layer.\n\
    \   The OTN path computation can be divided into two layers.  One layer\n   is\
    \ OCh/OTUk; the other is ODUj.  [RFC4206] and [RFC6107] define the\n   mechanisms\
    \ to accomplish creating the hierarchy of LSPs.  The LSP\n   management of multiple\
    \ layers in OTN can follow the procedures\n   defined in [RFC4206], [RFC6001],\
    \ and [RFC6107].\n   As discussed in Section 4, the route path computation for\
    \ OCh is in\n   the scope of the Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON)\n\
    \   [RFC6163].  Therefore, this document only considers the ODU layer for\n  \
    \ an ODU connection request.\n   The LSP hierarchy can also be applied within\
    \ the ODU layers.  One of\n   the typical scenarios for ODU layer hierarchy is\
    \ to maintain\n   compatibility with introducing new [G709-2012] services (e.g.,\
    \ ODU0\n   and ODUflex) into a legacy network configuration (i.e., the legacy\n\
    \   OTN referenced by [RFC4328]).  In this scenario, it may be necessary\n   to\
    \ consider introducing hierarchical multiplexing capability in\n   specific network\
    \ transition scenarios.  One method for enabling\n   multiplexing hierarchy is\
    \ by introducing dedicated boards in a few\n   specific places in the network\
    \ and tunneling these new services\n   through the legacy containers (ODU1, ODU2,\
    \ ODU3), thus postponing the\n   need to upgrade every network element to [G709-2012]\
    \ capabilities.\n   In such cases, one ODUj connection can be nested into another\
    \ ODUk\n   (j<k) connection, which forms the LSP hierarchy in the ODU layer.\n\
    \   The creation of the outer ODUk connection can be triggered via\n   network\
    \ planning or by the signaling of the inner ODUj connection.\n   For the former\
    \ case, the outer ODUk connection can be created in\n   advance based on network\
    \ planning.  For the latter case, the multi-\n   layer network signaling described\
    \ in [RFC4206], [RFC6107], and\n   [RFC6001] (including related modifications,\
    \ if needed) is relevant to\n   create the ODU connections with multiplexing hierarchy.\
    \  In both\n   cases, the outer ODUk connection is advertised as a Forwarding\n\
    \   Adjacency (FA).\n"

    \      For other ODU signal types, the bit rates and tolerances are fixed\n  \
    \    and can be deduced from the signal types.\n   -  Support for LSP setup using\

    \ the TS\n      granularity (i.e., the 2.5 Gbps TS granularity and the new 1.25\n\
    \      Gbps TS granularity) to be used for establishing a Hierarchical\n     \

    \ increase or decrease the\n      bandwidth of an ODUflex (GFP) that is transported\

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Implications for GMPLS Routing\n   The path computation process needs to\
    \ select a suitable route for an\n   ODUj connection request.  In order to perform\
    \ the path computation,\n   it needs to evaluate the available bandwidth on each\
    \ candidate link.\n   The routing protocol should be extended to convey sufficient\n\
    \   information to represent ODU Traffic Engineering (TE) topology.\n   The Interface\
    \ Switching Capability Descriptors defined in [RFC4202]\n   present a new constraint\
    \ for LSP path computation.  [RFC4203] defines\n   the Switching Capability, related\
    \ Maximum LSP Bandwidth, and\n   Switching Capability specific information.  When\
    \ the Switching\n   Capability field is TDM, the Switching Capability specific\n\
    \   information field includes Minimum LSP Bandwidth, an indication\n   whether\
    \ the interface supports Standard or Arbitrary SONET/SDH, and\n   padding.  Hence,\
    \ a new Switching Capability value needs to be defined\n   for [G709-2012] ODU\
    \ switching in order to allow the definition of a\n   new Switching Capability\
    \ specific information field.  The following\n   requirements should be considered:\n\
    \   -  Support for carrying the link multiplexing capability\n      As discussed\
    \ in Section 3.1.2, many different types of ODUj can be\n      multiplexed into\
    \ the same OTUk.  For example, both ODU0 and ODU1\n      may be multiplexed into\
    \ ODU2.  An OTU link may support one or more\n      types of ODUj signals.  The\
    \ routing protocol should be capable of\n      carrying this multiplexing capability.\n\
    \   -  Support any ODU and ODUflex\n      The bit rate (i.e., bandwidth) of each\
    \ TS is dependent on the TS\n      granularity and the signal type of the link.\
    \  For example, the\n      bandwidth of a 1.25 Gbps TS in an OTU2 is about 1.249409620\
    \ Gbps,\n      while the bandwidth of a 1.25 Gbps TS in an OTU3 is about\n   \
    \   1.254703729 Gbps.\n      One LO ODU may need a different number of TSs when\
    \ multiplexed\n      into different HO ODUs.  For example, for ODU2e, 9 TSs are\
    \ needed\n      when multiplexed into an ODU3, while only 8 TSs are needed when\n\
    \      multiplexed into an ODU4.  For ODUflex, the total number of TSs to\n  \
    \    be reserved in an HO ODU equals the maximum of [bandwidth of\n      ODUflex\
    \ / bandwidth of TS of the HO ODU].\n      Therefore, the routing protocol should\
    \ be capable of carrying the\n      necessary link bandwidth information for performing\
    \ accurate route\n      computation for any of the fixed rate ODUs as well as\
    \ ODUflex.\n   -  Support for differentiating between terminating and switching\n\
    \      capability\n      Due to internal constraints and/or limitations, the type\
    \ of signal\n      being advertised by an interface could be restricted to switched\n\
    \      (i.e., forwarded to switching matrix without\n      multiplexing/demultiplexing\
    \ actions), restricted to terminated\n      (demuxed), or both.  The capability\
    \ advertised by an interface\n      needs further distinction in order to separate\
    \ termination and\n      switching capabilities.\n      Therefore, to allow the\
    \ required flexibility, the routing protocol\n      should clearly distinguish\
    \ the terminating and switching\n      capability.\n   -  Support for Tributary\
    \ Slot Granularity advertisement\n      [G709-2012] defines two types of TSs,\
    \ but each link can only\n      support a single type at a given time.  In order\
    \ to perform a\n      correct path computation (i.e., the LSP endpoints have matching\n\
    \      Tributary Slot Granularity values) the Tributary Slot Granularity\n   \
    \   needs to be advertised.\n   -  Support different priorities for resource reservation\n\
    \      How many priority levels should be supported depends on the\n      operator's\
    \ policy.  Therefore, the routing protocol should be\n      capable of supporting\
    \ up to 8 priority levels as defined in\n      [RFC4202].\n   -  Support link\
    \ bundling\n      As described in [RFC4201], link bundling can improve routing\n\
    \      scalability by reducing the number of TE links that have to be\n      handled\
    \ by the routing protocol.  The routing protocol should be\n      capable of supporting\
    \ the bundling of multiple OTU links, at the\n      same line rate and muxing\
    \ hierarchy, between a pair of nodes that\n      a TE link does.  Note that link\
    \ bundling is optional and is\n      implementation dependent.\n   -  Support\
    \ for Control of Hitless Adjustment of ODUflex (GFP)\n      The control plane\
    \ should support hitless adjustment of ODUflex, so\n      the routing protocol\
    \ should be capable of differentiating whether\n      or not an ODU link can support\
    \ hitless adjustment of ODUflex (GFP)\n      and how many resources can be used\
    \ for resizing.  This can be\n      achieved by introducing a new signal type\
    \ \"ODUflex(GFP-F),\n      resizable\" that implies the support for hitless adjustment\
    \ of\n      ODUflex (GFP) by that link.\n   As mentioned in Section 5.1, one method\
    \ of enabling multiplexing\n   hierarchy is via usage of dedicated boards to allow\
    \ tunneling of new\n   services through legacy ODU1, ODU2, and ODU3 containers.\
    \  Such\n   dedicated boards may have some constraints with respect to switching\n\
    \   matrix access; detection and representation of such constraints is\n   for\
    \ further study.\n"

  - "5.4.  Implications for Link Management Protocol\n   As discussed in Section 5.3,\
    \ path computation needs to know the\n   interface switching capability of links.\
    \  The switching capability of\n   two ends of the link may be different, so the\
    \ link capability of two\n   ends should be correlated.\n   LMP [RFC4204] provides\
    \ a control-plane protocol for exchanging and\n   correlating link capabilities.\n\
    \   Note that LO ODU type information can be, in principle, discovered by\n  \
    \ routing.  Since in certain cases, routing is not present (e.g., in\n   the case\
    \ of a User-Network Interface (UNI)), we need to extend link\n   management protocol\
    \ capabilities to cover this aspect.  If routing is\n   present, discovery via\
    \ LMP could also be optional.\n   -  Correlating the granularity of the TS\n \
    \     As discussed in Section 3.1.2, the two ends of a link may support\n    \
    \  different TS granularity.  In order to allow interconnection, the\n      node\
    \ with 1.25 Gbps granularity should fall back to 2.5 Gbps\n      granularity.\n\
    \      Therefore, it is necessary for the two ends of a link to correlate\n  \
    \    the granularity of the TS.  This ensures the correct use of the TE\n    \
    \  link.\n   -  Correlating the supported LO ODU signal types and multiplexing\n\
    \      hierarchy capability\n      Many new ODU signal types have been introduced\
    \ in [G709-2012],\n      such as ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, and ODUflex.  It is possible\
    \ that\n      equipment does not support all the LO ODU signal types introduced\n\
    \      by new standards or documents.  Furthermore, since multiplexing\n     \
    \ hierarchy may not be supported by the legacy OTNs, it is possible\n      that\
    \ only one end of an ODU link can support multiplexing\n      hierarchy capability\
    \ or that the two ends of the link support\n      different multiplexing hierarchy\
    \ capabilities (e.g., one end of\n      the link supports ODU0 into ODU1 into\
    \ ODU3 multiplexing while the\n      other end supports ODU0 into ODU2 into ODU3\
    \ multiplexing).\n      For control and management consideration, it is necessary\
    \ for the\n      two ends of an HO ODU link to correlate the types of LO ODU that\n\
    \      can be supported and the multiplexing hierarchy capabilities that\n   \
    \   can be provided by the other end.\n"

    \ control an LSP for an ODU type\n      that both nodes support in the data plane.\n\
    \   -  A node supporting [G709-2012] could support both the control plane\n  \
    \    related to [G709-2012] and the control plane defined in [RFC4328].\n    \
    \  o  Such a node could identify which set of procedures to follow\n         when\
    \ initiating an LSP based on the Switching Capability value\n         advertised\
    \ in routing.\n      o  Such a node could follow the set of procedures based on\
    \ the\n         Switching Type received in signaling messages from an upstream\n\
    \         node.\n      o  Such a node, when processing a transit LSP, could select\
