  - "Abstract\n   The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between\n\
    \   the IETF 107 and IETF 108 meetings, and the issue of eligibility of\n   who\
    \ can serve on that NomCom needs clarification.  This document\n   provides a\
    \ one-time interpretation of the eligibility rules that is\n   required for the\
    \ exceptional situation of the cancellation of the in-\n   person IETF 107 meeting.\
    \  This document only affects the seating of\n   the 2020-2021 NomCom and any\
    \ rules or processes that relate to NomCom\n   eligibility before IETF 108; it\
    \ does not set a precedent to be\n   applied in the future.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The COVID-19 outbreak, which at the time of this writing\
    \ was declared\n   a global pandemic [PANDEMIC], has resulted in the cancellation\
    \ of the\n   in-person IETF 107 meeting [CANCEL107].  This resulted in its\n \
    \  conversion to a virtual meeting with a limited agenda and remote\n   participation\
    \ only [VIRTUAL107].\n   The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be\
    \ formed between\n   the IETF 107 and IETF 108 meetings, and the issue of eligibility\
    \ of\n   who can serve on that NomCom needs clarification: a one-time\n   interpretation\
    \ of the eligibility rules is required for this\n   particular exceptional situation.\
    \  That interpretation will apply to\n   the seating of that NomCom and to any\
    \ rules or processes that relate\n   to NomCom eligibility before the scheduled\
    \ time for IETF 108.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   Section 4.14 of [RFC8713] (BCP 10) includes these requirements\
    \ for\n   eligibility:\n   |  Members of the IETF community must have attended\
    \ at least three of\n   |  the last five IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\n\
    \   |  \n   |  The five meetings are the five most recent meetings that ended\n\
    \   |  prior to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom volunteers\n   |\
    \  was submitted for distribution to the IETF community.\n   On 13 March 2020,\
    \ a message was posted to the IETF discussion list\n   [SOLICITINPUT] suggesting\
    \ two possible interpretations and asking for\n   community input that might include\
    \ suggesting other interpretations.\n   Discussion over the subsequent two weeks\
    \ centered around three:\n   1.  Do not count IETF 107 at all, for the purpose\
    \ of NomCom\n       eligibility, as BCP 10 clearly refers to in-person meetings\
    \ only.\n       NomCom eligibility would, therefore, be based on attendance at\n\
    \       IETFs 102 through 106.\n   2.  Do not have anyone lose eligibility because\
    \ of IETF 107, but do\n       count someone as having attended 107, for the purpose\
    \ of NomCom\n       eligibility, if that person attended the IETF 107 virtual\
    \ meeting\n       (signed the electronic blue sheet).  People could thus gain\n\
    \       eligibility from IETF 107, but could not lose eligibility from\n     \
    \  it, and eligibility would be based on attendance at IETFs 102\n       through\
    \ 107.\n   3.  Count virtual attendance at IETF 107 and consider IETF 107 as one\n\
    \       of the last five meetings, so that NomCom eligibility would be\n     \
    \  based on attendance at IETFs 103 through 107.\n   In judging rough consensus,\
    \ the IESG has considered the arguments and\n   levels of support for and against\
    \ each option.  The arguments largely\n   involved issues of fairness to newer\
    \ participants, acceptance of more\n   participants in the volunteer pool, and\
    \ greatest adherence to the\n   spirit of the rules defined in BCP 10, which is\
    \ the community-\n   consensus basis we are working from.\n   On 25 March 2020,\
    \ a message was posted to the IETF discussion list\n   [COMMENTDEADLINE] asking\
    \ for final comments by 30 April 2020.  This\n   documents the outcome of that\
    \ discussion with the choice of\n   interpretation 1, above.\n"

  - "3.  Eligibility for the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee\n   The following text\
    \ modifies, for the 2020-2021 NomCom cycle only, the\n   first two paragraphs\
    \ (quoted above) of Section 4.14 of [RFC8713] (BCP\n   10) as follows:\n     \
    \ Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of\n      the\
    \ last five in-person IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\n      The five meetings\
    \ are the five most recent in-person meetings that\n      ended prior to the date\
    \ on which the solicitation for NomCom\n      volunteers was submitted for distribution\
    \ to the IETF community.\n      Because no IETF 107 in-person meeting was held,\
    \ for the 2020-2021\n      Nominating Committee, those five meetings are IETFs\
    \ 102, 103, 104,\n      105, and 106.\n   This update is an emergency interpretation\
    \ of the intent of BCP 10\n   for this current exceptional situation only.  It\
    \ applies only to the\n   2020-2021 NomCom, which is expected to be seated prior\
    \ to IETF 108,\n   and to any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility\n\
    \   before IETF 108.  It will explicitly not apply to any future NomCom\n   and\
    \ does not set precedent: an update to BCP 10 will be necessary to\n   address\
    \ future eligibility, as there will be time for proper\n   community work on such\
    \ an update (see [ELIGIBILITYDISCUSS]).  That\n   update could change any part\
    \ of the BCP 10 process, including\n   anything specified in this document.\n"
