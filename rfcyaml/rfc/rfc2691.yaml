  - "Abstract\n   This is the text of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that was\n\
    \   signed by ICANN, the IETF, the ITU-T, W3C and ETSI on July 14, 1999\n   in\
    \ Oslo. This MoU creates the Protocol Support Organization (PSO)\n   within the\
    \ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\n   (ICANN).  This MoU was\
    \ developed by representatives of the IETF, ITU,\n   W3C, ETSI, and ICANN with\
    \ the help of Jorge Contreras of Hale and\n   Dorr.\n                        MEMORANDUM\
    \ OF UNDERSTANDING\n                               July 14, 1999\n           \
    \       ICANN Protocol Supporting Organization\n   (1) Purpose and Scope\n   \
    \    (a) The Protocol Support Organization (PSO) will be a consensus-\n      \
    \     based  advisory body within the ICANN framework.\n       (b) The PSO will\
    \ establish a \"Protocol Council\" and host an\n           annual open  meeting\
    \ (the \"General Assembly\").\n       (c) The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding\
    \ (MOU) is to\n           establish a set of principles that ICANN and the Standards\n\
    \           Development Organizations who have signed below (the Signing\n   \
    \        SDOs) will  use in forming and operating the PSO\n   (2) Composition\
    \ and Action of Protocol Council\n       (a) Size.  Each Signing SDO will appoint\
    \ two (2) members to the\n           Protocol Council, each such member to serve\
    \ for a time period\n           determined by such Signing SDO.\n       (b) Each\
    \ Signing SDO shall be responsible for choosing its\n           members of the\
    \ Protocol Council in a manner of its own\n           choosing, and in accordance\
    \ with its own open procedures.\n           Each Signing SDO may remove or replace\
    \ one or both of its\n           members on the Protocol Council in its discretion.\
    \  Each\n           Signing SDO must notify the Protocol Council Secretary and\n\
    \           ICANN when it changes its members and, in addition, must\n       \
    \    ratify its choices at least annually.\n       (c) Selection and Appointment.\
    \  Concurrently with the posting of\n           notice of the date of the annual\
    \ meeting of the PSO General\n           Assembly on the PSO Web Site, ICANN and\
    \ the Protocol Council\n           shall make an open call for nominations to\
    \ any potential\n           vacancies on the Protocol Council.  Any nominations\
    \ received\n           will be forwarded to the Signing SDOs eligible to appoint\n\
    \           members (i.e., they do not already have two members on the\n     \
    \      Protocol Council) for their consideration.\n       (d) Action by Protocol\
    \ Council.  Unless otherwise specified in\n           this MOU, all actions of\
    \ the Protocol Council shall be taken\n           by majority vote of the total\
    \ number of members.  Action may\n           be taken at any meeting of the Protocol\
    \ Council, which may be\n           by telephone conference in which all participants\
    \ can hear\n           the others.  Meetings of the Protocol Council may be called\n\
    \           by request of any three members of the Protocol Council, with\n  \
    \         at least 45 days for physical meetings or fifteen (15) days\n      \
    \     for telephonic or other electronic meetings prior written\n           notice\
    \ to each of the other members.  In order to conduct\n           business at any\
    \ meeting of the Protocol Council, at least a\n           quorum of members must\
    \ be present; a quorum shall be present\n           when at least majority of\
    \ the members of the Protocol Council\n           are present, and when such members\
    \ represent at least 3/4ths\n           of the Signing SDOs.\n       (e) Web Site.\
    \  The Protocol Council will arrange for the\n           establishment and maintenance\
    \ of a Web site devoted to PSO\n           activities and news.\n       (f) Secretary.\
    \  The Protocol Council will have a Secretary to\n           coordinate administrative\
    \ matters relating to the PSO and\n           Protocol Council.  The Secretary's\
    \ term of office shall be\n           one year.  The position of Secretary will\
    \ rotate among the\n           Signing SDOs, with the initial Secretary to be\
    \ selected by\n           the IETF, and subsequent Secretaries to be appointed\
    \ by a\n           randomly selected Signing SDO that has not appointed  the\n\
    \           Secretary in the current rotation.\n       (g) No Compensation.  Neither\
    \ the Secretary, nor any Protocol\n           Council member or designated ICANN\
    \ Board member shall be\n           entitled to any compensation or reimbursement\
    \ of expenses\n           from the PSO.  The PSO shall not be required to obtain\n\
    \           insurance coverage for, or to indemnify, the members of the\n    \
    \       Protocol Council or persons acting in any other capacity by\n        \
    \   or for the PSO.\n   (3) ICANN Directors\n       (a) The Protocol Council will\
    \ appoint Directors to the ICANN\n           Board of  Directors in accordance\
    \ with the By-laws of ICANN,\n           for such terms as  are specified by such\
    \ By-laws.  ICANN will\n           notify the Protocol Council of any vacancies\
    \ on the ICANN\n           Board which may be filled by the Protocol Council.\n\
    \       (b) The Protocol Council will conduct an open call for\n           nominations\
    \ for any open PSO seats on the ICANN Board.  Each\n           Signing SDO is\
    \ entitled to nominate candidates by procedures\n           of its own choosing.\
    \ Additionally, nominations from the\n           public at large will be allowed\
    \ under conditions to be\n           defined by the Protocol Council.  The Protocol\
    \ Council will\n           select the PSO nominees to the ICANN Board from among\
    \ these\n           nominees.  ICANN Directors selected by the Protocol Council\n\
    \           may, but need not, be members of the Protocol Council or any\n   \
    \        SDO.\n       (c) No more than 2 PSO-nominated Directors may be residents\
    \ of\n           the same Geographic Region (as defined in the ICANN By-laws).\n\
    \       (d) The ICANN Directors appointed by the Protocol Council will\n     \
    \      not represent the PSO on the ICANN Board, but will function\n         \
    \  as full Directors of ICANN.\n   (4) Duties of Protocol Council\n       (a)\
    \ Advisory Role.  The Protocol Council will advise the ICANN\n           Board\
    \ on matters referred to the Protocol Council by the\n           ICANN Board relating\
    \ to the assignment of parameters for\n           Internet protocols.\n      \
    \ (b) Policy Development\n           (i)   In the tradition of the Internet, standards\
    \ development\n                 policies and conflict resolution mechanisms should\
    \ be\n                 created and utilized by those institutions most\n     \
    \            directly involved, without undue interference from\n            \
    \     centralized bodies.\n           (ii)  The ICANN By-laws vest in the PSO\
    \ the primary\n                 responsibility for developing and recommending\n\
    \                 substantive policies in the area of protocol parameter\n   \
    \              assignment.\n           (iii) The PSO is committed to the proposition\
    \ that policies\n                 for parameter assignments for particular protocols\
    \ are\n                 the responsibility of the individual Signing SDO that\n\
    \                 developed the protocol.\n           (iv)  The Protocol Council,\
    \ and, when requested, ICANN, will\n                 be available as needed by\
    \ the Signing SDOs to develop\n                 policies and procedures for conflict\
    \ resolution between\n                 Signing SDOs.\n           (v)   Any such\
    \ policies and procedures will be adopted only\n                 with the agreement\
    \ of all SDOs.\n   (5) Annual Open Meeting\n       (a) The Protocol Council will\
    \ periodically convene an open\n           meeting  (\"General Assembly\") for\
    \ promoting discussion and\n           receiving input  regarding the work of\
    \ the PSO.\n       (b) A General Assembly  will be held at least once per year,\
    \ and\n           will permit open participation by all interested individuals.\n\
    \       (c) Each annual General Assembly will be hosted by a Signing SDO\n   \
    \        in  conjunction with one of its major meetings, as determined\n     \
    \      by the  Protocol Council (with an effort to hold no 2\n           consecutive\
    \ General  Assemblies in the same Geographic\n           Region.)\n       (d)\
    \ It is expected that the major organizations within the\n           Internet\
    \  protocol standards development community will\n           provide the  constituency\
    \ of the General Assembly.\n   (6) Open Proceedings and Documents\n       (a)\
    \ Communications between ICANN and the Protocol Council.  All\n           official\
    \ communications between ICANN and the Protocol\n           Council will be made\
    \ public on the PSO web site.  In the\n           event that ICANN requests that\
    \ a communication be kept\n           confidential, the Protocol Council will\
    \ honor this request\n           for a fixed period of time not to exceed one\
    \ year, and then\n           make the communication public.\n       (b) Protocol\
    \ Council Proceedings.  All meetings of the Protocol\n           Council and official\
    \ discussions of Protocol Council business\n           will be conducted or reported\
    \ on a publicly-archived mailing\n           list accessible through the PSO web\
    \ site.\n       (c) Meeting Announcements.  The schedule and agenda for the PSO\n\
    \           General Assembly will be posted on the PSO Web Site at least\n   \
    \        90 days in advance of the meeting date.  Notice of Protocol\n       \
    \    Council meetings will be posted on the PSO Web at least 45\n           days\
    \ before each physical meeting or fifteen (15) days before\n           any telephonic\
    \ or other electronic meeting, or such shorter\n           time period agreed\
    \ upon by each of the Signing SDOs.  The\n           minutes from all PSO meetings\
    \ will be publicly posted on the\n           PSO web site within 30 days of the\
    \ meeting.\n   (7) Review and Modification of MOU.  ICANN and the Signing SDOs\
    \ will\n       periodically review the results and consequences of their\n   \
    \    cooperation under this MOU.  When appropriate, the signatories\n       will\
    \ consider the need for improvements in the MOU and make\n       suitable proposals\
    \ for modifying and updating the arrangements\n       and scope of the MOU.  Any\
    \ modification to the MOU must be\n       approved by all signatories.\n   (8)\
    \ Standards Development Organizations\n       (a) The initial signatories to this\
    \ MOU shall include ICANN and\n           the Signing SDOs who have signed below.\
    \  Each Signing SDO\n           must be an international, Internet-related standards\n\
    \           development organization that establishes that it meets the\n    \
    \       criteria for SDOs set forth below.\n           (i)  SDOs must be open,\
    \ international, voluntary technical\n                 standard and technical\
    \ specification development\n                 organizations which:\n         \
    \        (A) Develop standards and/or specifications for use\n               \
    \      over the public Internet.\n                 (B) Can demonstrate active\
    \ membership in the IP-related\n                     standards and/or specification\
    \ development process\n                     of more than 800 individuals, if individual\n\
    \                     memberships are used by the organization, or 80\n      \
    \               companies, if corporate memberships are used by the\n        \
    \             organization.\n                 (C) Has been in operation for 3\
    \ or more years at the\n                     time of their application.\n    \
    \             (D) Can demonstrate that there is significant\n                \
    \     deployment of its standards on the Internet.\n                 (E) The significant\
    \ protocols controlled by the\n                     organization can be implemented\
    \ without paying a\n                     licensing fee to the organization.\n\
    \           (ii)  Open, international, voluntary standards organizations\n   \
    \              are defined as international organizations that plan,\n       \
    \          develop or establish voluntary standards.  An\n                 organization\
    \ shall be considered open and international\n                 if its standards\
    \ and/or specifications development\n                 process is open to any person\
    \ or organization of any\n                 nationality on equitable terms.  An\
    \ organization shall\n                 be considered voluntary if it makes no\
    \ claim to compel\n                 use of its standards and specifications. \
    \ Additionally,\n                 to be considered 'international', an organization's\n\
    \                 voting (or other \"full\") membership must include\n       \
    \          individuals or companies primarily located in at least\n          \
    \       three different Geographic Regions and at least two\n                \
    \ different countries within each of those Geographic\n                 Regions.\n\
    \       (b) New Signatories\n           (i)   Any organization that believes it\
    \ satisfies the SDO\n                 qualifications set forth above may apply\
    \ in writing to\n                 the  Protocol Council to become a party to this\
    \ MOU.\n                 In order for an organization to become a party to this\n\
    \                 MOU, all then-existing MOU signatories must agree that\n   \
    \              such organization qualifies as  an SDO.\n           (ii)  Rejected\
    \ applicants can appeal to the ICANN Board,\n                 which may override\
    \ such a rejection if the ICANN Board\n                 finds, by at least a two-thirds\
    \ vote, that the\n                 organization meets the SDO criteria set forth\
    \ above.\n           (iii) Any organization that is accepted as an SDO under this\n\
    \                 MOU  must execute a copy of this MOU, and agree to be\n    \
    \             bound by all of its terms and conditions, upon which it\n      \
    \           shall be considered  a Signing SDO for all purposes\n            \
    \     under this MOU.\n       (9) General.  This MOU does not constitute any of\
    \ the parties as\n           a partner, joint venture, agent, principal or franchisee\
    \ of\n           any other party. The waiver of any provision of this MOU on\n\
    \           any occasion shall not constitute a waiver for purposes of\n     \
    \      any other occasion.  No party may transfer or assign any\n           interest,\
    \ right or obligation arising under this MOU without\n           the prior written\
    \ consent of each other party to this MOU.\n       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Memorandum\
