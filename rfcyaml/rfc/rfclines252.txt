The purpose of this RFC is to report on the recent status of most Network Hosts.
During September 27 through September 29 the BBN prototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to hardware debugging.
The Network was, therefore, not examined on these days.
Three Hosts which were not officially able to act as Server's at the time of RFC #240 are now able to do so.
The Harvard PDP 10, however, has limited core space.
They will, therefore, run the Telnet program only occasionally.
The following two tables summarize the information on the Host status for September 30 October 8.
(Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
(Destination Host did not respond in any way to the initial RFC, although not dead.)
H   1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
(Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to user.)
The UCLA IMB 360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.
The BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS however, we are assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
# These sites advertise that they may not have their system available # at these times.
