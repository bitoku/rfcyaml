- title: Department of Defense's Transmission Protocol
  contents:
  - "Department of Defense's Transmission Protocol\n The DOD's Defense Advanced Research\
    \ Projects Agency (DARPA) has been\n conducting and supporting research on computer\
    \ networks for over\n fifteen years (1).  These efforts led to the development\
    \ of modern\n packet-switched network design concepts.  Transmission between\n\
    \ computers is generally accomplished by packet switching using strict\n protocols\
    \ for the control and exchange of messages.  The Advanced\n Research Projects\
    \ Agency network (ARPANET), implemented in the early\n 1970s, provided a testing\
    \ ground for research on communications\n protocols.  In 1978, after four years\
    \ of development, the DOD\n promulgated versions of its Transmission Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) and an\n Internet Protocol (IP) and mandated their use as standards within\
    \ the\n DOD.  TCP is now widely used and accepted.  These protocols meet the\n\
    \ unique operational and functional requirements of the DOD, and any\n changes\
    \ in the protocols are viewed with some trepidation by members of\n the department.\
    \  DOD representatives have stated that standardizing TCP\n greatly increased\
    \ the momentum within the DOD toward establishing\n interoperability between networks\
    \ within the DOD.\n"
- title: International Standards Organization's Transport Protocol
  contents:
  - "International Standards Organization's Transport Protocol\n The NBS Institute\
    \ for Computer Sciences and Technology (ICST), in\n cooperation with the DOD,\
    \ many industrial firms, and the International\n Standards Organization (ISO),\
    \ has developed a new international\n standard\n"

- title: (1)  The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was reorganized and
  contents:
  - "(1)  The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was reorganized and\n Transport\
    \ Protocol (TP-4) and a new Internetwork Protocol (2).  These\n protocols will\
    \ soon be available as commercial products.  Although in\n part derived from TCP,\
    \ the new protocols are not compatible with\n TCP (3).  The U.S. standards organizations\
    \ are supporting TP-4 in\n international operations, and the Department of Commerce\
    \ is proposing\n TP-4 as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for\
    \ use by all\n federal agencies.\n"
- title: DOD OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL NEEDS
  contents:
  - "DOD OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL NEEDS\n The DOD has unique needs that could be\
    \ affected by the Transport and\n Internet Protocol layers.  Although all data\
    \ networks must have some of\n these capabilities, the DOD's needs for operational\
    \ readiness,\n mobilization, and war-fighting capabilities are extreme.  These\
    \ needs\n include the following:\n  Survivability--Some networks must function,\
    \ albeit at reduced\n  performance, after many nodes and links have been destroyed.\n\
    \  Security--Traffic patterns and data must be selectively protected\n  through\
    \ encryption, access control, auditing, and routing.\n  Precedence--Systems should\
    \ adjust the quality of service on the basis\n  of priority of use; this includes\
    \ a capability to preempt services in\n  cases of very high priority.\n  Robustness--The\
    \ system must not fail or suffer much loss of capability\n  because of unpredicted\
    \ situations, unexpected loads, or misuse.  An\n  international crisis is the\
    \ strongest test of robustness, since the\n  system must operate immediately and\
    \ with virtually full performance\n  when an international situation flares up\
    \ unexpectedly.\n  Availability--Elements of the system needed for operational\
    \ readiness\n  or fighting must be continuously available.\n  Interoperability--Different\
    \ elements of the Department must be able to\n  \"talk\" to one another, often\
    \ in unpredicted ways between parties that\n  had not planned to interoperate.\n"

  - "classes 0 to 3 are used for special purposes not related to those of\n These\
    \ operational needs reflect themselves into five technical or\n managerial needs:\n\
    \  1.   Functional and operational specifications (that is, will the\n       protocol\
    \ designs meet the operational needs?);\n  2.   Maximum interoperability;\n  3.\
    \   Minimum procurement, development, and support costs;\n  4.   Ease of transition\
    \ to new protocols; and\n  5.   Manageability and responsiveness to changing DOD\
    \ requirements.\n These are the criteria against which DOD options for using the\
    \ ISO\n transport and internet protocols should be evaluated.\n Interoperability\
    \ is a very important DOD need.  Ideally, DOD networks\n would permit operators\
    \ at any terminal to access or be accessed by\n applications in any computer.\
    \  This would provide more network power\n for users, integration of independently\
    \ developed systems, better use\n of resources, and increased survivability. \
    \ To increase\n interoperability, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has mandated\n\
    \ the use of TCP for the Defense Communication System's Defense Data\n Network\
    \ (DDN), unless waivers are granted.  In addition, the Defense\n Communication\
    \ Agency (DCA) is establishing standards for three\n higher-level \"utility\"\
    \ protocols for file transfer, terminal access,\n and electronic mail.  Partly\
    \ as a result of these actions, it has\n become clear that there is growing momentum\
    \ toward accepting\n interoperability and a recognition that it is an important\
    \ operational\n need.\n It is very important, however, to recognize that functional\n\
    \ interoperability is only achieved with full generality when two\n communication\
    \ nodes can interoperate at all protocol levels.  For the\n DOD the relevant levels\
    \ are as follows:\n  1.   Internet, using IP;\n  2.   Transport, using TCP;\n\
    \  3.   Utility, using file, terminal, or mail protocols; and\n  4.   Specific\
    \ applications that use the above protocols for their\n       particular purpose.\n\
    \ Accordingly, if a network is developed using one transport protocol, it\n would\
    \ generally not be able to interoperate functionally with other\n networks using\
    \ the same transport protocol unless both networks were\n also using the higher-level\
    \ utility and application protocols.  In\n evaluating whether or not to convert\
    \ to TP-4 and in developing a\n transition plan, the following factors must be\
    \ considered:\n  The DOD contains numerous communities of interest whose principal\
    \ need\n  is to interoperate within their own members, independently. Such\n \
    \ communities generally have a specific, well-defined mission.\n  The DOD Intelligence\
    \ Information System (DODIIS) and the World Wide\n  Military Command and Control\
    \ System (WWMCCS) are examples.\n  Interoperability is needed primarily between\
    \ the higher layer\n  applications programs initially unique to each community\
    \ of interest.\n  There are many different kinds of operations needed between\n\
    \  communities of interest.  Examples of such operations are\n  headquarters'\
    \ need for access to several subordinate communities and\n  the communities' need\
    \ for some minimum functional interoperability\n  with each other (such as mail\
    \ exchange).\n  The need for functional interoperability can arise, unexpectedly\
    \ and\n  urgently, at a time of crisis or when improved management\n  opportunities\
    \ are discovered.  Widespread standardization of TP-4 and\n  higher-level protocols\
    \ can readily help to achieve these needs.\n  Often, special development of additional\
    \ applications that cost time\n  and money will be necessary.\n  The DOD needs\
    \ functional interoperability with many important external\n  agencies that are\
    \ committed to ISO standards:  The North Atlantic\n  Treaty Organization (NATO),\
    \ some intelligence and security agencies,\n  and other parts of the federal government.\n\
    \  The same objectives that have prompted the use of standardized\n  protocols\
    \ at higher-level headquarters will lead to their use by\n  tactical groups in\
    \ the field.\n"
- title: SOME COMPARISONS
  contents:
  - "SOME COMPARISONS\n A detailed comparison of the DOD Transmission Control Protocol\
    \ and the\n ISO Transport Protocol indicates they are functionally equivalent\
    \ and\n provide essentially similar services.  Because it is clear that a great\n\
    \ deal of care and experience in protocol development have gone into\n generating\
    \ the specifications for TP-4, the committee is confident that\n TP-4 will meet\
    \ military requirements.\n Although there are differences between the two protocols,\
    \ they do not\n compromise DOD requirements.  And, although in several areas,\
    \ including\n the data transfer interface, flow control, connection establishment,\n\
    \ and out-of-band, services are provided in different ways by the two\n protocols,\
    \ neither seems intrinsically superior.  Thus, while existing\n applications may\
    \ need to be modified somewhat if moved from TCP to\n TP-4, new applications can\
    \ be written to use either protocol with a\n similar level of effort.\n The TCP\
    \ and TP-4 protocols are sufficiently equivalent in their\n security-related properties\
    \ in that there are no significant technical\n points favoring the use of one\
    \ over the other.\n While TCP currently has the edge in maturity of implementation,\
    \ TP-4 is\n gaining rapidly due to the worldwide support for and acceptance of\
    \ the\n Open System Interconnection (OSI) international standards.\n Experimental\
    \ TCP implementations were completed in 1974 at Stanford\n University and BBN\
    \ Communications Corporation.  Between 1974 and 1982 a\n large number of implementations\
    \ were produced.  The Defense Advanced\n Research Projects Agency (ARPA) network\
    \ switched to a complete use of\n TCP in January 1983. Operations have been satisfactory\
    \ and its use is\n growing.  A number of TCP implementations are also in commercial\
    \ use in\n various private networks.\n In contrast, TP-4 has not yet been implemented\
    \ in any large operational\n system.  It has been tested experimentally, however,\
    \ and has received\n endorsement by many commercial vendors worldwide.  In addition,\n\
    \ substantial portions of TP-4 have been demonstrated at the National\n Computer\
    \ Conference in July 1984.\n The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the standards\
    \ is not believed to be\n a problem.  The ISO IP is not as far along as TP-4,\
    \ but it is much less\n complex.  The ISO IP, based very strongly on the DOD IP,\
    \ became a draft\n international standard in April 1984.\n The rapidity of the\
    \ progress in ISO and the results achieved over the\n past two years have surprised\
    \ even the supporters of international\n standards. The reasons for this progress\
    \ are twofold:  strong market\n demands stemming from the growing integration\
    \ of communications and\n data processing and the progress in networking technology\
    \ over the past\n years as the result of ARPA and commercial developments.\n Although\
    \ the DOD networks have been a model upon which the ISO\n transport standards\
    \ have been built, the rest of the world is adopting\n TP-4. Because the DOD represents\
    \ a small fraction of the market and\n because the United States supports the\
    \ ISO standard, it is not\n realistic to hope that TP-4 can be altered to conform\
    \ with TCP.  This\n raises the question as to what action should be taken by the\
    \ DOD with\n respect to the ISO standard.\n"
- title: SOME ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
  contents:
  - "SOME ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\n The DOD has a large and growing commitment in\
    \ operational TCP networks,\n and this will increase by 50 to 100 percent in the\
    \ next eighteen\n months.  This rate of investment will probably continue for\
    \ the next\n five years for new systems and the upgrading of current ones.  The\n\
    \ current Military Network (MILNET) and Movement Information Network\n (MINET)\
    \ systems are expanding and will shortly be combined.  The\n Strategic Air Command\
    \ Digital Information Network (SACDIN) and DODIIS\n are undergoing major upgrading.\
    \  When these changes are completed,\n there are plans to upgrade the WWMCCS Intercomputer\
    \ Network (WIN) and\n to add separate SECRET and TOP SECRET networks.  There are\
    \ plans to\n combine these six networks in the late 1980s, and they will become\n\
    \ interoperable and multilevel secure using an advanced technology now\n under\
    \ development.  If these plans are implemented on schedule, a delay\n of several\
    \ years in moving to TP-4 would mean that the DOD networks in\n the late 1980s\
    \ would be virtually all TCP-based. Subsequent conversion\n if hastily attempted\
    \ in order to maintain established DOD\n interoperability and gain interoperability\
    \ with a large body of users.\n As the Department of Defense policy recognizes,\
    \ there are significant\n advantages in using commercial vendor products if they\
    \ meet the\n department's operational needs.  The major advantages are as follows:\n\
    \  Costs to the DOD for development, production, and maintenance are\n  significantly\
    \ lower because (1) vendors spread the cost over a much\n  larger user base, (2)\
    \ commercial vendors are generally more efficient\n  in their operations, and\
    \ (3) vendors look for ways to improve their\n  product to meet competition.\n\
    \  The department generally gets more effective products because vendors\n  integrate\
    \ the protocol functions into their entire software and\n  hardware product line.\
    \  Thus the DOD may be able eventually to use\n  commercial software products\
    \ that are built on top of, and thereby\n  take advantage of, the transport protocols.\n\
    \  By depending on industry to manage the development and maintenance of\n  products,\
    \ the department can use its scarce management and technical\n  resources on activities\
    \ unique to its mission.\n Because the costs of transport and internet protocol\
    \ development and\n maintenance are so intertwined with other factors, it is impossible\
    \ to\n give a precise estimate of the savings that would be achieved by using\n\
    \ commercial products.  Savings will vary in individual cases.  The\n marginal\
    \ savings should range from 30 to 80 percent.\n"
- title: RECOMMENDATIONS
  contents:
  - "RECOMMENDATIONS\n The ISO protocols are now well specified but will not generally\
    \ be\n commercially available for many months.  Nevertheless, this committee\n\
    \ believes that the principles on which they are based are\n well-established,\
    \ and the protocols can be made to satisfy fully DOD's\n needs.  The committee\
    \ recommends that the DOD move toward adoption of\n TP-4 as costandard with TCP\
    \ and toward exclusive use of TP-4.\n Transition to the use of the ISO standards,\
    \ however, must be managed in\n a manner that will maintain DOD's operational\
    \ capabilities and minimize\n risks.  The timing of the transition is, therefore,\
    \ a major concern.\n Descriptions of two options that take this requirement into\
    \ account\n follow.  A majority of the committee recommends the first option,\
    \ while\n a minority favors the second.  A third option--to defer action--is also\n\
    \ described but not recommended.\n Option 1\n  The first option is for the DOD\
    \ to immediately modify its current\n  transport policy statement to specify TP-4\
    \ as a costandard along with\n  TCP.  In addition, the DOD would develop a military\
    \ specification for\n  TP-4 that would also cover DOD requirements for discretionary\
    \ options\n  allowed under the NBS protocol specifications.  Requests for proposals\n\
    \  (RFPs) for new networks or major upgrades of existing networks would\n  specify\
    \ TP-4 as the preferred protocol.  Contracts for TP-4 systems\n  would be awarded\
    \ only to contractors providing commercial products,\n  except for unique cases.\n\
    \  Existing networks that use TCP and new networks firmly committed to\n  the\
    \ use of TCP-based systems could continue to acquire implementations\n  of TCP.\
    \  The DOD should carefully review each case, however, to see\n  whether it would\
    \ be advantageous to delay or modify some of these\n  acquisitions in order to\
    \ use commercial TP-4 products.  For each\n  community of users it should be decided\
    \ when it is operationally or\n  economically most advantageous to replace its\
    \ current or planned\n  systems in order to conform to ISO standards without excessively\n\
    \  compromising continued operations.\n  United States government test facilities\
    \ would be developed to enable\n  validation of TP-4 products (4).  The Department\
    \ of Defense would\n  either require that products be validated using these test\
    \ facilities\n  or that they be certified by the vendor.  The test facilities\
    \ could\n  also be used to isolate multivendor protocol compatibility problems.\n\
    \  The existing NBS validation tools should be used as the base for the\n  DOD\
    \ test facilities.\n  Because under this option networks based on both TCP and\
    \ TP-4 would\n  coexist for some time, several capabilities that facilitate\n\
    \  interoperability among networks would need to be developed.  The\n  Department\
    \ of Defense generally will not find them commercially\n  available.  Examples\
    \ are gateways among networks or specialized hosts\n  that provide services such\
    \ as electronic mail.  The department would\n  need to initiate or modify development\
    \ programs to provide these\n  capabilities, and a test and demonstration network\
    \ would be required.\n Option 2\n  Under Option 2 the Department of Defense would\
    \ immediately announce\n  its intention to adopt TP-4 as a transport protocol\
    \ costandard with\n  TCP after a satisfactory demonstration of its suitability\
    \ for use in\n  military networks.  A final commitment would be deferred until\
    \ the\n  demonstration has been evaluated and TP-4 is commercially available.\n\
    \  The demonstration should take at most eighteen months and should\n  involve\
    \ development of TP-4 implementations and their installation.\n  This option differs\
    \ from Option 1 primarily in postponing the adoption\n  of a TP-4 standard and,\
    \ consequently, the issuance of RFPs based on\n  TP-4 until successful completion\
    \ of a demonstration.  The department,\n"

    \ parallel with the demonstration.  Early issuance of a\n  TP-4 military specification,\
    \ development of validation procedures, and\n  implementation of means for interoperability\
    \ would be particularly\n  important in this regard.\n Option 3\n  Under the third\
    \ option the DOD would continue using TCP as the\n  accepted transport standard\
    \ and defer any decision on the use of TP-4\n  indefinitely.  The department would\
    \ be expected to stay well informed\n  on the development and use of the new protocol\
    \ in the commercial and\n  international arena and, with the National Bureau of\
    \ Standards, work\n  on means to transfer data between the two protocol systems.\
    \  Testing\n  and evaluation of TP-4 standards by NBS would continue.  The DOD\
    \ might\n  eventually accommodate both protocol systems in an evolutionary\n \
    \ conversion to TP-4.\n Comparison of Options\n  The committee believes that all\
    \ three options equally satisfy the\n  functional objectives of the DOD, including\
    \ matters of security.  It\n  believes the two protocols are sufficiently similar\
    \ and no significant\n  differences in performance are to be expected if the chosen\
    \ protocol\n  implementation is of equal quality and is optimized for the given\n\
    \  environment.\n  The primary motivation for recommending Option 1 is to obtain\
    \ the\n  benefits of standard commercial products in the communication protocol\n\
    \  area at an early date.  Benefits include smaller development,\n  procurement,\
    \ and support costs; more timely updates; and a wider\n  product availability.\
    \ By immediately committing to TP-4 as a\n  costandard for new systems, Option\
    \ 1 minimizes the number of systems\n  that have to be converted eventually from\
    \ TCP.  The ability to manage\n  the transition is better than with Option 2 since\
    \ the number of\n  systems changed would be smaller and the time duration of mixed\
    \ TCP\n  and TP-4 operation would be shorter. Interoperability with external\n\
    \  systems (NATO, government, commercial), which presumably will also use\n  TP-4,\
    \ would be brought about more quickly. Option 1 involves greater\n  risk, however,\
    \ since it commits to a new approach without as complete\n  a demonstration of\
    \ its viability.\n  As with Option 1, a primary benefit of following Option 2\
    \ would be\n  obtaining the use of standard commercial products.  Unit procurement\n\
    \  costs probably would be lower than with Option 1 because the\n  commercial\
    \ market for TP-4 will have expanded somewhat by the time DOD\n  would begin to\
    \ buy TP-4 products.  Risk is smaller, compared to Option\n  1, because testing\
    \ and demonstration of the suitability for military\n  use will have preceded\
    \ the commitment to the ISO protocols.\n  Transition and support costs would be\
    \ higher than for Option 1,\n  however, because more networks and systems would\
    \ already have been\n  implemented with TCP.  Also this is perhaps the most difficult\
    \ option\n  longest interval of mixed TCP and TP-4 operations would occur.  In\n\
    \  addition, interoperability with external networks through\n  standardization\
    \ would be delayed.\n  The principal benefit of exercising Option 3 would be the\
    \ elimination\n  of transition cost and the risk of faulty system behavior and\
    \ delay.\n  It would allow the most rapid achievement of full internal\n  interoperability\
    \ among DOD systems.  Manageability should be good\n  because only one set of\
    \ protocols would be in use (one with which the\n  DOD already has much experience),\
    \ and because the DOD would be in\n  complete control of system evolution. Procurement\
    \ costs for TCP\n  systems would remain high compared with standard ISO protocol\n\
    \  products, however, and availability of implementations for new systems\n  and\
    \ releases would remain limited.  External interoperability with\n  non-DOD systems\
    \ would be limited and inefficient.\n  In summary, Option 1 provides the most\
    \ rapid path toward the use of\n  commercial products and interoperability with\
    \ external systems.\n  Option 2 reduces the risk but involves somewhat greater\
    \ delay and\n  expense.  Option 3 involves the least risk and provides the quickest\n\
    \  route to interoperability within the Defense Department at the least\n  short-term\
    \ cost.  These are, however, accompanied by penalties of\n  incompatibility with\
    \ NATO and other external systems and higher\n  life-cycle costs.\n          \

    \ for the functions, features, and services of NBS-proposed\n  standards.\n  To\
    \ further the development of commercial products that implement\n  standards,\
    \ the NBS gives priority to the needs of U.S. computer\n  manufacturers who wish\
    \ to market their products nationally and\n  internationally, not just to the\
    \ U.S. government.  The NBS\n  participates, therefore, in national and international\
    \ voluntary\n  standards organizations toward the development of an international\n\
    \  consensus based on United States needs.  Specifications, formal\n  description\
    \ techniques, testing methodologies, and test results\n  developed by the NBS\
    \ are used to further the international\n  standardization process.\n Development\
    \ of Testing Methodologies\n  The National Bureau of Standards has laboratory\
    \ activities where\n  prototypes of draft protocol standards are implemented and\
    \ tested in a\n  variety of communications environments supporting different\n\
    \  applications on different kinds and sizes of computers.\n  Communications environments\
    \ include, for example, global networks,\n  local networks, and office system\
    \ networks.  Applications may, for\n  example, include file transfer or message\
    \ processing.  The primary\n  purposes are to advance the state of the art in\
    \ measurement\n  methodologies for advanced computer networking technologies and\n\
    \  determine protocol implementation correctness and performance.\n  The NBS views\
    \ testing as a cooperative research effort and works with\n  other agencies, private-sector\
    \ companies, and other countries in the\n  development of methodologies.  At this\
    \ time, this cooperation involves\n  five network laboratories in other countries\
    \ and over twenty computer\n  manufacturers.\n  The testing methodologies developed\
    \ at the NBS are well documented,\n  and the testing tools themselves are developed\
    \ with the objective of\n  portability in mind.  They are made available to many\
    \ organizations\n  engaged in protocol development and implementations.\n Assisting\
    \ Users and Manufacturers\n  The NBS works directly with government agencies to\
    \ help them use\n  evolving network technologies effectively and apply international\
    \ and\n  government networking standards properly.  When large amounts of\n  assistance\
    \ are required, the NBS provides it under contract.\n  Assistance to industry\
    \ is provided through cooperative research\n  efforts and by the availability\
    \ of NBS testing tools, industry wide\n  workshops, and cooperative demonstration\
    \ projects.  At this time, the\n  NBS is working directly with over twenty computer\

- title: DOD OBJECTIVES

  - "DOD OBJECTIVES\n The DOD has unique needs that could be affected by the Transport\
    \ and\n Internet Protocol layers.  Although all data networks must have some of\n\
    \ these capabilities, the DOD's needs for operational readiness,\n mobilization,\
    \ and war-fighting capabilities are extreme.  These needs\n include the following:\n\
    \  Survivability--Some networks must function, albeit at reduced\n  performance,\
    \ after many nodes and links have been destroyed.\n  Security--Traffic patterns\
    \ and data must be selectively protected\n  through encryption, access control,\
    \ auditing, and routing.\n  Precedence--Systems should adjust the quality ot service\
    \ on the basis\n  of priority of use; this includes a capability to preempt services\
    \ in\n  cases of very high priority.\n  Robustness--The system must not fail or\
    \ suffer much loss of capability\n  because of unpredicted situations, unexpected\
    \ loads, or misuse.  An\n  international crisis is the strongest test of robustness,\
    \ since the\n  system must operate immediately and with virtually full performance\n\
    \  when an international situation flares up unexpectedly.\n  Availability--Elements\
    \ of the system needed for operational readiness\n  or fighting must be continuously\
    \ available.\n  Interoperability--Different elements of the Department must be\
    \ able to\n  \"talk\" to one another, often in unpredicted ways between parties\
    \ that\n  had not planned to interoperate.\n These operational needs reflect themselves\
    \ into five technical or\n managerial needs:\n  1.   Functional and operational\
    \ specifications (that is, will the\n       protocol designs meet the operational\
    \ needs?);\n  2.   Maximum interoperability;\n  3.   Minimum procurement, development,\
    \ and support costs;\n  4.   Ease of transition to new protocols; and\n  5.  \
    \ Manageability and responsiveness to changing DOD requirements.\n These are the\
    \ criteria against which DOD options for using the ISO\n transport and internet\
    \ protocols should be evaluated.\n Performance and Functionality\n  The performance\
    \ and functionality of the protocols must provide for\n  the many unique operational\
    \ needs of the DOD.  The following\n  paragraphs discuss in some detail both these\
    \ needs and the ways they\n  can impact protocol design.\n  Survivability includes\
    \ protecting assets, hiding them, and duplicating\n  them for redundancy.  It\
    \ also includes endurance--the assurance that\n  those assets that do survive\
    \ can continue to perform in a battle\n  environment for as long as needed (generally\
    \ months rather than\n  hours); restoral--the ability to restore some of the damaged\
    \ assets to\n  operating status; and reconstitution--the ability to integrate\n\
    \  fragmented assets into a surviving and enduring network.\n  The DOD feels that\
    \ an important reason for adopting international and\n  commercial standards is\
    \ that under cases of very widespread damage to\n  its own communications networks,\
    \ it would be able to support DOD\n  functions by using those civil communications\
    \ that survive.  This\n  would require interoperability up to the network layer,\
    \ but neither\n  TCP nor TP-4 would be needed.  The committee has not considered\
    \ the\n  extent to which such increased interoperability would increase\n  survivability\
    \ through better restoral and reconstitution.\n  Availability is an indication\
    \ of how reliable the system and its\n  components are and how quickly they can\
    \ be repaired after a failure.\n  Availability is also a function of how badly\
    \ the system has been\n  damaged. The DDN objective for system availability in\
    \ peacetime varies\n  according to whether subscribers have access to l or 2 nodes\
    \ of the\n  DDN.  For subscribers having access to only one node of the DDN, the\n\
    \  objective is that the system be available 99.3 percent of the time,\n  that\
    \ is, the system will be unavailable for no more than 60 hours per\n  year.  For\
    \ subscribers having access to 2 nodes, the objective is that\n  the system be\
    \ available 99.99 percent of the time, that is, the system\n  will be unavailable\
    \ for no more than one hour per year.\n  Robustness is a measure of how well the\
    \ system will operate\n  successfully in face of the unexpected.  Robustness attempts\
    \ to avoid\n  or minimize system degradation because of user errors, operator\n\
    \  errors, unusual load patterns, inadequate interface specifications,\n  and\
    \ so forth.  A well designed and tested system will limit the damage\n  caused\
    \ by incorrect or unspecified inputs to affect only the\n  performance of the\
    \ specific function that is requested.  Since\n  protocols are very complex and\
    \ can be in very many \"states\",\n  robustness is an important consideration\
    \ in evaluating and\n  implementing protocols.\n  Security attempts to limit the\
    \ unauthorized user from gaining both the\n  information communicated in the system\
    \ and the patterns of traffic\n  throughout the system.  Security also attempts\
    \ to prevent spoofing of\n  the system:  an agent attempting to appear as a legitimate\
    \ user,\n  insert false traffic, or deny services to users by repeatedly seeking\n\
    \  Finally, Security is also concerned with making sure that electronic\n  measures\
    \ cannot seriously degrade the system, confuse its performance,\n  or cause loss\
    \ of security in other ways.\n  Encryption of communication links is a relatively\
    \ straightforward\n  element of security.  It is widely used, fairly well understood,\n\
    \  constantly undergoing improvement, and becoming less expensive.  On\n  the\
    \ other hand, computer network security is a much newer field and\n  considerably\
    \ more complex.  The ability of computer network protocols\n  to provide security\
    \ is a very critical issue.  In the past decade much\n  has been learned about\
    \ vulnerability of computer operating systems,\n  development of trusted systems,\
    \ different levels of protection, means\n  of proving that security has been achieved,\
    \ and ways to achieve\n  multilevel systems or a compartmented mode.  This is\
    \ a dynamic field,\n  however, and new experience and analysis will probably place\
    \ new\n  requirements on network protocols.\n  Crisis-performance needs are a\
    \ form of global robustness.  The nature\n  of a national security crisis is that\
    \ it is fraught with the\n  unexpected.  Unusual patterns of communication traffic\
    \ emerge.\n  Previously unstressed capabilities become critical to national\n\
    \  leaders.  Individuals and organizations that had not been\n  communicating\
    \ must suddenly have close, secure, and reliable\n  communications.  Many users\
    \ need information that they are not sure\n  exists, and if it does, they do not\
    \ know where it is or how to get it.\n  The development of widely deployed, interoperable\
    \ computer networks\n  can provide important new capabilities for a crisis, particularly\
    \ if\n  there is some investment in preplanning, including the higher-level\n\
    \  protocols that facilitate interoperability.  Presidential directives\n  call\
    \ for this. This will become a major factor in DOD's need for\n  interoperability\
    \ with other federal computer networks.  The DOD, as\n  one of the most affected\
    \ parties, has good reason to be concerned that\n  its network protocols will\
    \ stand the tests of a crisis.\n  In addition, there are performance and functionality\
    \ features that are\n  measures of the capability of the network when it is not\
    \ damaged or\n  stressed by unexpected situations.  Performance includes quantifiable\n\
    \  measures such as time delays, transmission integrity, data rates and\n  efficiency,\
    \ throughput, numbers of users, and other features well\n  understood in computer\
    \ networks.  Equally important is the extent of\n  functionality: What jobs will\
    \ the network do for the user?\n  The DDN has established some performance objectives\
    \ such as end-to-end\n  delays for high-precedence and routine traffic, the probability\
    \ of\n  undetected errors, and the probability of misdelivered packets.  Such\n\
    \  objectives are important to engineer a system soundly.  The DOD must\n  place\
    \ greater emphasis on more complex performance issues such as the\n  efficiency\
    \ with which protocols process and communicate data.\n  The DOD has stated a need\
    \ for an effective and robust system for\n  precedence and preemption.  Precedence\
    \ refers to the ability of the\n  system to adaptively allocate network resources\
    \ so that the network\n  performed.  Preemption refers to the ability of the system\
    \ to remove\n  users (at least temporarily) until the needs of the high-priority\
    \ user\n  are satisfied.  The ARPANET environment in which the protocols were\n\
    \  developed did not emphasize these capabilities, and the current MILNET\n  does\
    \ not function as effectively in this regard as DOD voice\n  networks.\n  The\
    \ DOD has also stated a need for connectionless communications and a\n  broadcast\
    \ mode.  In the majority of network protocols, when two of\n  more parties communicate,\
    \ virtual circuits are established between the\n  communicating parties.  (For\
    \ reliability, additional virtual circuits\n  may be established to provide an\
    \ in place backup.)  DOD needs a\n  connectionless mode where the message can\
    \ be transmitted to one or\n  more parties without the virtual circuit in order\
    \ to enhance\n  survivability; provide a broadcast capability (one sender to many\n\
    \  receivers); and handle imagery, sensor data, and speech traffic\n  quickly\
    \ and efficiently.\n  If intermediate nodes are destroyed or become otherwise\
    \ unavailable,\n  there is still a chance that the data can be sent via alternate\
    \ paths.\n  The broadcast capability is particularly important in tactical\n \
    \ situations where many parties must be informed almost simultaneously\n  and\
    \ where the available assets may be disappearing and appearing\n  dynamically.\
    \  The Department of Defense requires an internetting\n  capability whereby different\
    \ autonomous networks of users can\n  communicate with each other.\n Interoperability\n\
    \  Presidential and DOD directives place a high priority on\n  interoperability,\
    \ which is related to the internetworking previously\n  discussed.\n  Interoperability\
    \ is primarily important at two levels:  network access\n  and applications. \
    \ To achieve interoperability at the level of network\n  access,users of backbone\
    \ communications nets must utilize the same\n  lower-level protocols that are\
    \ utilized by the network.  Generally\n  these protocols are layers 1, 2, and\
    \ 3, up to and including part of\n  the IP layer.  In other words, interoperability\
    \ for network access\n  does not depend on either implementation of the transport\
    \ layer (TP-4\n  or TCP) or of all of the internet (IP) layer.  The primary advantages\n\
    \  of network access interoperability are twofold:\n   1.   Significant economies\
    \ of scale are possible since the various\n        users can share the resources\
    \ of the backbone network including\n        hardware, software, and development\
    \ and support costs.\n   2.   Network survivability for all users can be increased\n\
    \        significantly since the network has high redundancy and, as the\n   \
    \     threat increases, the redundancy can also be increased.\n  Interoperability\
    \ at the applications layer allows compatible users at\n  support each other,\
    \ and thereby coordinate and strengthen the\n  management of forces and other\
    \ assets.  Interoperability at the\n  applications layer can be achieved through\
    \ the use of specialized\n  software that performs those functions of higher-layer\
    \ protocols (such\n  as TCP or TP-4, file transfer, and virtual terminal) that\
    \ are needed\n  by the particular application.  If some of the higher-layer transport\n\
    \  and utility protocols have been developed for particular hosts or work\n  stations,\
    \ their use greatly reduces development, integration, and\n  support costs, although\
    \ with a potential sacrifice of performance.\n  Interoperability at the applications\
    \ level, that is, full functional\n  interoperability, is important to specialized\
    \ communities of users\n  such as the logistics, command and control, or research\
    \ and\n  development communities.  As these different communities utilize the\n\
    \  DDN, they have the advantages of shared network resources. Within each\n  community\
    \ there is full functional interoperability but generally\n  there is much less\
    \ need for one community to have functional\n  interoperability with members of\
    \ another community.\n  The implementation of TCP or TP-4 within network users,\
    \ but without\n  the implementation of higher-level protocols and application\n\
    \  interoperability, is not generally an immediate step in increasing\n  interoperability.\
    \ It does have these immediate advantages:\n   It represents an important step\
    \ in investing in longer-term\n   interoperability.\n   It generally represents\
    \ an economical near-term investment on which\n   communities of interest can\
    \ build their own applications.\n   It facilitates the development of devices\
    \ for general network use\n   such as Terminal Access Controllers (TACs).\n  Interoperability\
    \ at the applications level will become increasingly\n  important among the following\
    \ communities:  Worldwide Military Command\n  and Control Systems, including systems\
    \ of subordinate commands;\n  Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems;\
    \ U.S. tactical\n  force headquarters (fixed and mobile); NATO force headquarters;\
    \ other\n  U.S. intelligence agencies; the State Department; and the Federal\n\
    \  Bureau of Investigation and other security agencies.\n  Although interoperability\
    \ of applications within the DOD has the\n  highest priority, it is clear that\
    \ government wide and international\n  interoperability will be an objective with\
    \ increasing priority.  The\n  NATO situation is especially important (6).\n"

  - "Consistent with this is a NATO commitment to adopt ISO standards so long\n  In\
    \ a somewhat longer time period, DOD will want applications\n  interoperability\
    \ with many commercial information services.  As\n  interoperable computer networks\
    \ become more common, processing and\n  data services will burgeon in the marketplace.\
    \  These will include\n  specialized data bases and analytic capabilities that\
    \ all large\n  organizations will need in order to be up-to-date and competitive.\n\
    \  With regard to interoperability at the network level, DOD will want to\n  be\
    \ able to utilize commercially available networks for both\n  survivability and\
    \ operational effectiveness and economy.  In the case\n  of a major war in Europe,\
    \ for example, the United States would want to\n  be able to use surviving PTTs\
    \ (Postal, Telegraphy, and Telephony\n  Ministries) for restoral and reconstitution.\
    \  During peacetime there\n  will be cases where special DOD needs can be best\
    \ satisfied with\n  commercially available capabilities.\n  As technology continues\
    \ to provide less expensive, smaller, and more\n  reliable data processing equipment,\
    \ computer networks will become\n  increasingly prevalent at lower levels of the\
    \ tactical forces--land,\n  air, and sea.  It will be important that these tactical\
    \ networks be\n  capable of interoperability with each other (for example, air\
    \ support\n  of ground forces) and with headquarters.  It is likely that the\n\
    \  tactical network will need a network architecture and protocols that\n  are\
    \ different from the ARPA-\\and ISO-derived protocols.  If so, the\n  developments\
    \ will place requirements on the higher-level DOD\n  protocols.\n  If the DOD\
    \ chooses to move from TCP to TP-4, this can be done in\n  phases for different\
    \ communities of interest and subnetworks.  In this\n  way if there is difficulty\
    \ in converting one subnet, the rest of the\n  network need not be degraded. \
    \ Also the different subnets will be able\n  to make the transition at the most\
    \ suitable time in terms of cost,\n  risk, and the need to interoperate with other\
    \ subnets.  As a result if\n  DOD uses TP-4 for some new nets or major upgrade\
    \ of existing nets,\n  this will generally not reduce interoperability in the\
    \ near term\n  unless interoperability of applications is needed between two\n\
    \  communities.  In this case specific interoperability needs may be\n  satisfied\
    \ with specialized gateways for mail or data exchange.\n  The DOD points out that\
    \ it desires all networks to be interoperable\n  since it is not possible to predict\
    \ when one community will need to\n  communicate with another or use the resources\
    \ of the other.  As\n  previously indicated, however, unexpected needs for full\
    \ functional\n  interoperability can only be met when appropriate higher-layer\n\
    \  software is developed.\n Minimize Costs\n  The Department of Defense seeks\
    \ to minimize costs of development,\n  procurement, transition (if it decides\
    \ to move to ISO protocols), and\n  support.  Generally the objective is to limit\
    \ life-cycle costs, that\n  is, the total costs over a 5-to-8-year period with\
    \ future costs\n  The Department of Defense has already made a heavy investment\
    \ in\n  protocols, and the investment has paid off in the success of current\n\
    \  protocols operational in many networks.  On the other hand, the DOD\n  acknowledges\
    \ the potential advantages of using the ISO protocols if\n  made available as\
    \ commercially supported products.  Development costs\n  for these protocols can\
    \ be small since their development cost is\n  amortized by the commercial vendor\
    \ over a larger market.  Support\n  costs for these protocols (including minor\
    \ modifications, integration\n  into other products, documentation, and training)\
    \ are also\n  significantly reduced because of vendor-supplied services.  These\
    \ cost\n  factors are further discussed in Section IX in terms of the three\n\
    \  options presented in Section VIII.\n Ease of Transition and Manageability\n\
    \  Networks must be manageable and capable of growth and improvement. The\n  Department\
    \ of Defense generally makes the fastest progress in\n  developing complex information\
    \ systems if it evolves these\n  capabilities while working in concert with the\
    \ users and the acquiring\n  agencies.  In this light, the following factors are\
    \ important:\n   Minimal interruption of current service--For most DOD networks\
    \ it is\n   essential that they operate continuously.  If there is to be\n   transition\
    \ to new protocol services (whether based on current DOD\n   versions or ISO),\
    \ it is important that these transitions be planned,\n   designed, and pretested\
    \ so that the transition will be nondisruptive.\n   Verifiability--It is essential\
    \ to have a testing capability where new\n   protocol implementations can be thoroughly\
    \ tested to ensure that they\n   will interoperate, have full functionality specified,\
    \ do not contain\n   errors, are robust, and meet quantitative performance needs.\
    \  The\n   National Bureau of Standards has established such a capability, and\n\
    \   it is being used to verify a number of TP-4 implementations,\n   including\
    \ those demonstrated at the National Computer Conference in\n   July 1984.  An\
    \ IP-testing capability is being added.  The Department\n   of Defense is planning\
    \ a similar protocol test facility for TCP, but\n   work is just getting underway.\
    \  If the DOD plans to migrate promptly\n   to TP-4, there is a question whether\
    \ this investment is warranted.\n   Compatibility with higher protocols--As the\
    \ transport and\n   lower-protocol layers evolve, it is essential that they maintain\
    \ full\n   compatibility with higher-layer protocols.  This is particularly\n\
    \   important for the DOD because it will increasingly have\n   inter-operability\
    \ at the applications level.\n   Responsiveness to evolving DOD needs--Current\
    \ DOD needs will change\n   or new needs may arise.  It is very likely, for example,\
    \ that subtle\n   performance problems may be discovered in a protocol that are\
    \ unique\n   to the strenuous DOD-operating environment and that could have\n\
    \   serious operational consequences.  If the DOD is using commercial\n   protocols\
    \ products based upon international standards, the DOD will\n   need two commitments\
    \ when critical deficiencies are discovered.  It\n   will be promptly fixed and\
    \ a commitment from the NBS that it will\n   move quickly to change federal standards\
    \ and seek changes in\n   international standards.\n   Minimal risks--The DOD\
    \ needs are so large and important, it cannot\n   afford to take otherwise avoidable\
    \ risks.\n   Maintenance of manageability--The DDN is new and is using a new\n\
    \   approach after the cancellation of AUTODIN II (7).  There are\n   pressing\
    \ operational needs and many impatient users.  If the DOD\n   delays in moving\
    \ to ISO protocols and later decides to do so, the\n   costs and disruption will\
    \ be large.  On the other hand, moving now to\n   ISO will be less disruptive.\n"

    \ from a specific or general remote entity.  In some\n  implementations it may\
    \ be possible for a nonresident user entity to\n  cause a Listen Request to be\
    \ posted and an instance of the entity to\n  be created when a matching connection\
    \ request arrives.  TCP does not\n  queue an incoming connection request with\
    \ no matching Listen Request\n  but instead rejects the connection.\n  TP-4 requires\
    \ no prior request but passes a Call Indication to a user\n  entity whenever a\
    \ Call Request is received.  It is, however, left open\n  as an implementation\
    \ decision as to how TP-4 finds and/or creates an\n  appropriate user entity to\
    \ give the Call Indication; that is, the\n  service does not include or define\
    \ how user applications make\n  themselves available for calls (no Listen Service\
    \ Primitive).  The\n  implementation guidelines indicate that well-known addresses,\
    \ prior\n  process existence, and Call Request queuing are all facilities that\n\
    \  may or may not be provided at the implementor's choice (9).  This\n  would\
    \ seem to allow for different choices and hence failure to\n  establish a connection\
    \ between standard implementations (for example,\n  caller expects requests not\
    \ to be queued, while callee does queuing,\n  and hence never responds).\n  The\
    \ practical impact is uncertain due to lack of experience with how\n  the various\
    \ options allowed by the TP-4 standard will be used in\n  practice. TCP seems\
    \ more oriented to a prior authorization mode of\n  operation, while TP-4 most\
    \ easily supports an\n  indication-with-later-acceptance scenario. It is not clear\
    \ how TP-4\n  will support rejecting calls to nonexistent or inactive user entities\n\
    \  and how user entities could control how many calls they would accept.\n  This\
    \ area may require DOD refinement.\n Out-of-Band Signals\n  TCP allows the user\
    \ to specify an urgent condition at any point in the\n  normal data stream.  Several\
    \ such indications may be combined, with\n  only the last one shown to the destination.\
    \  There is no limit to the\n  number of urgent indications that can be sent.\
    \  The TCP urgent\n  messages are sent requesting expedited service from the network\
    \ layer\n  so network bottlenecks can be bypassed as well.\n  TP-4 allows users\
    \ to send expedited data units carrying up to sixteen\n  octets of user data.\
    \  These are only half synchronized with the normal\n  data stream since they\
    \ may be delivered before previously sent normal\n  data, but not after subsequently\
    \ sent normal data.  Each expedited\n  data unit is delivered to the destination,\
    \ and only one can be\n  outstanding at a time.  ISO has indicated its intention\

  contents:
  - "of Standards, Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology,\n  is not yet defined.\n\
    \  The impact is primarily for applications like terminal traffic\n  handlers\
    \ that must deal with interrupt-type signals of various types.\n  The need to\
    \ read an arbitrary amount of normal data and recognize\n  urgent data in the\
    \ normal stream are difficulties with TCP urgent\n  service, but it has been used\
    \ successfully by the Telnet protocol.\n  The lack of full synchronization of\
    \ the signal and normal data in TP-4\n  may require users to insert their own\
    \ synchronization marks in the\n  normal data stream [as was the case with the\
    \ old ARPA Network Control\n  Program (NCP)], and the limitation of one outstanding\
    \ signal may be\n  restrictive.  Some effort would be required to convert higher-level\n\
    \  protocols using one transport protocol to using the other.\n Security\n  The\
    \ committee has determined that the TCP and TP-4 are sufficiently\n  equivalent\
    \ in their security-related properties so that no significant\n  technical points\
    \ favor the use of one over the other.\n  The DOD protocol architecture assigns\
    \ the security-marking function to\n  the IP layer and provides an 11-byte security\
    \ option with a defined\n  coding in the IP header.\n  TP-4 provides a variable-length\
    \ security option carried in Call\n  Request packets.  A variable-length security\
    \ option field is also\n  provided in the ISO IP.  Standard encoding of security\
    \ markings are\n  under consideration but not yet defined and accepted.\n  In\
    \ addition to these explicit security-marking fields, the existence,\n  coding,\
    \ and placement of other header fields have security\n  implications. If data\
    \ is encrypted, for example, a checksum is usually\n  used to determine if the\
    \ decrypted data is correct, so the strength of\n  the checksum has security implications.\n\
    \ Precedence\n  TCP supports precedence by using three bits provided in IP headers\
    \ of\n  every packet.  TP-4 provides a 2-byte priority option in Call Request\n\
    \  packets.  A 2-byte priority option in the ISO IP header is also under\n  consideration.\
    \  Currently, no implementations make use of precedence\n  information (to support\
    \ preemption, for example).  There should be no\n  impact, therefore, of changing\
    \ from one protocol to the other.\n Type of Service\n  The types of network service\
    \ that can be requested via TCP and TP-4\n  are somewhat different.  The impact\
    \ seems minimal since few networks\n  do anything with the type of service fields\
    \ at present with the\n  exception of DARPA's packet radio and satellite nets.\
    \  This may become\n  more important in the future.\n Datagram Service\n  TCP\
    \ provides only reliable session service.  A separate User Datagram\n  Protocol\
    \ (UDP) in the DOD architecture supports transaction or\n  connectionless-type\
    \ interaction where individual messages are\n  exchanged.  UDP is merely an addition\
    \ of the port-addressing layer to\n  the basic datagram service provided by IP.\

    \ only significant differences in the IPs themselves are in the areas\n of addressing\

- title: COMPARISON ON THE BASIS OF PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, AND RISK
  contents:
  - "COMPARISON ON THE BASIS OF PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, AND RISK\n Performance\n  The\
    \ performance of a transport protocol, such as TCP or TP-4, is a\n  function of\
    \ its implementation as well as its inherent design.\n  Experience in implementing\
    \ TCP and other proprietary protocols has\n  demonstrated that implementation\
    \ considerations usually dominate.\n  This makes it difficult to compare protocols,\
    \ since a wide range in\n  efficiency of implementations is possible.  Furthermore,\
    \ there are a\n  number of dimensions along which an implementation can be optimized.\n\
    \  Despite the difficulties, protocol designers have developed several\n  metrics\
    \ for comparing transport protocols.  These view protocol\n  performance from\
    \ a variety of perspectives, including  (1) user\n  response time, (2) throughput\
    \ on a single connection, (3) network and\n  significantly affected by the communications\
    \ environment.  Protocol\n  efficiency must be considered in a wide range of communication\n\
    \  environments, including local area networks, satellite links,\n  terrestrial\
    \ links, and packet-switched networks.\n  The critical algorithms most affecting\
    \ protocol performance are those\n  that perform end-to-end error control and\
    \ end-to-end flow control.\n  These algorithms affect the response time, throughput,\
    \ and resource\n  utilization of the protocol during the data transfer phase.\
    \  The\n  efficiency of the connection management procedures may also be\n  important\
    \ in applications involving frequent connections of brief\n  duration.\n  The\
    \ committee compared the algorithms and message formats specified\n  for each\
    \ protocol for critical functions, including flow-and\n  error-control and connection\
    \ management.  They concluded that since\n  the two protocols were sufficiently\
    \ similar there would be no\n  significant difference in performance of TCP or\
    \ TP-4 implementations\n  of equal quality optimized for a given environment.\n\
    \  The committee compared the error-and-flow-control algorithms of TCP/IP\n  and\
    \ TP-4.  Both employ window-based techniques using large-sequence\n  number spaces\
    \ and both permit large window sizes.  Their differences\n  are minor. TCP performs\
    \ its error-and-flow-control in units of octets,\n  rather than the protocol data\
    \ units employed by TP-4.  This adds a\n  small amount of overhead to TCP calculation\
    \ in return for a finer\n  control over host buffer memory.  The committee did\
    \ not consider the\n  difference significant, assuming that appropriate buffer\
    \ management\n  strategies are implemented by transport and higher-level protocols.\n\
    \  TP-4 employs more sophisticated techniques to ensure that flow-control\n  information\
    \ is reliably transmitted than does TCP.  These more\n  sophisticated techniques\
    \ may reduce TP-4 protocol overhead during\n  periods of light load in some applications,\
    \ possibly adding slightly\n  more CPU load in other cases.  The committee did\
    \ not consider these\n  effects significant.\n  Both protocols employ a three-way\
    \ handshake for establishing a\n  transport connection.  The differences between\
    \ the TCP and TP-4\n  handshake are related to the addressing conventions employed\
    \ for\n  establishing connections and do not affect protocol efficiency.  In\n\
    \  the common cases where a client process requests a connection to a\n  server\
    \ process, the TCP and TP-4 operations are equivalent.\n  Both protocols permit\
    \ a range of policy decisions in their\n  implementation. These include (1) selection\
    \ of timer values used to\n  recover from transmission errors and lost packets,\
    \ (2) selection of\n  window sizes at the receiver and transmitter, and (3) selection\
    \ of\n  protocol data unit sizes.  Both permit substantial reduction in\n  control\
    \ message overhead by expanding window sizes.  Both permit\n  credits to be granted\
    \ \"optimistically,\" permitting receiver buffers to\n  be shared over several\
    \ transport connections and permitting credit\n  reduction in the event of buffer\
    \ congestion. Both permit optimizing\n  not need to be transmitted, combining\
    \ it with later data or control\n  traffic.\n  The most significant difference\
    \ between TCP and TP-4 flow control\n  derives from slight differences in expression\
    \ of flow control at the\n  transport layer service interface.  TCP employs a\
    \ stream model while\n  TP-4 uses a message model.  These two models are equivalent\
    \ in\n  function; however, some higher-level applications protocols may be\n \
    \ more naturally expressed in one model than the other.  The committee\n  considered\
    \ the possibility that current ARPA protocols might require\n  some adaptation\
    \ to operate more efficiently with TP-4.  For this\n  reason the committee recommends\
    \ that the DOD study the operation of\n  current DOD higher-level protocols on\
    \ TP-4 (recommendation 5, Chapter\n  XI).\n Security\n  The committee considered\
    \ the impact of security requirements on\n  transport protocols primarily and\
    \ also on overall protocol hierarchies\n  in the DOD, The American National Standards\
    \ Institute (ANSI), and ISO.\n  Based on the information the committee received,\
    \ it finds that:\n   The current TCP-4 and TP-4 are sufficiently equivalent in\
    \ their\n   security-related properties that no significant technical points\n\
    \   would favor the use of one over the other.\n   There is no technical impediment\
    \ to their equivalent evolution over\n   time in the security area.\n Risk\n \
    \ There are several risks in implementing a new protocol or protocol\n  family.\
    \  These include (1) fatal flaws in protocol design not easily\n  rectified, (2)\
    \ errors in protocol specification, (3) ambiguities in\n  protocol specification,\
    \ (4) errors in protocol implementation, (5)\n  performance degradation due to\
    \ inefficient implementation, (6)\n  performance degradation due to \"untuned\"\
    \ implementation, and (7)\n  performance degradation due to untuned application\
    \ protocols.\n  This list of risks comes from experience in implementing computer\n\
    \  networks based on the DOD protocols and proprietary commercial\n  protocols.\
    \ Considering that it took more than ten years for the\n  current TCP protocols\
    \ to reach their current state of maturity and\n  that the TP-4 protocol is only\
    \ about two years old, the committee\n  devoted considerable attention to the\
    \ maturity of TP-4.\n Fatal Flaws in Protocol Design\n  Early ARPANET protocols\
    \ had a number of \"fatal\" design errors that\n  resulted in deadlocks or other\
    \ serious system failures.  Commercial\n  networks had similar problems in early\
    \ design phases.  The committee\n  considered the possibility that TP-4 could\
    \ suffer from similar faults\n  similar to those of TCP and proprietary transport\
    \ protocols.  The\n  faults encountered in the ARPANET are now well known.  Indeed,\
    \ the\n  state of the art in transport protocol design is now quite mature.\n\
    \  The developers of the TP-4 protocol were familiar with the earlier\n  protocols\
    \ and their problems.\n Errors and Ambiguities in Protocol Specification\n  Early\
    \ in the development of TP-4, NBS developed a formal protocol\n  specification\
    \ and a test environment based on this specification.  A\n  protocol implementation\
    \ can be partially compiled automatically from\n  the formal specification.  Other\
    \ implementations can be tested against\n  this master implementation.  The NBS\
    \ protocol laboratory was used to\n  debug the formal specification of TP-4 and\
    \ is currently being used to\n  certify other implementations of TP-4.  The laboratory\
    \ has also\n  developed and employed tools to analyze the specification for possible\n\
    \  problems.  The existence of this laboratory and the results obtained\n  to\
    \ date led the committee to conclude that there is no substantial\n  risk associated\
    \ with the TP-4 protocol specification.\n  In contrast TCP has only recently received\
    \ a formal specification. To\n  the committee's knowledge most existing TCP implementations\
    \ predate\n  the formal TCP specification and have not been derived from the formal\n\
    \  specification.  In the committee's opinion the formal TCP\n  specification\
    \ is likely to have more bugs or ambiguities than the TP-4\n  specification.\n\
    \  At the present time NBS has developed the only formal specification\n  for\
    \ ISO TP-4.  ISO is currently developing standards for formal\n  specification\
    \ techniques that are similar to those used by NBS.  When\n  these specifications\
    \ are complete ISO will update the TP-4\n  specification to include a formal description.\
    \  In translating the\n  current informal ISO specification into the formal specification\
    \ there\n  is a risk that the ISO specification may be changed such that it is\
    \ no\n  longer consistent with the current NBS specification.  The National\n\
    \  Bureau of Standards is playing a key role in developing the ISO formal\n  specification\
    \ techniques and formal specification.  It plans to\n  generate automatically\
    \ an implementation of the ISO formal\n  specification and verify it against the\
    \ NBS specification using the\n  NBS test tools.  In the committee's opinion this\
    \ makes the risk of\n  unintentional changes in the ISO specification quite low.\n\
    \  One possible risk remains.  The ISO specification for TP-4 that was\n  approved\
    \ is an informal document subject to the ambiguities of\n  informal protocol specifications.\
    \  The formalization may remove\n  ambiguities that have gone undetected and that\
    \ were the basis of its\n  approval.  It is conceivable that once these ambiguities\
    \ are exposed,\n  the current consensus for TP-4 may dissolve.  The committee\
    \ considers\n  this risk to be very low. The areas of ambiguity in protocol\n\
    \  specifications are typically only of concern to protocol implementors.\n  The\
    \ current protocol implementors through much of the world are\n  typically using\
    \ the NBS formal specifications as a basis of their\n  certifying their implementations.\
    \  In the event of a possible\n  conflict, the majority of implementors could\
    \ be expected to support\n  resolution of ambiguities in favor of the current\
    \ NBS formal\n  specification, making it unlikely that ISO would approve an alternate\n\
    \  resolution.\n Errors in Protocol Implementation\n  Several factors influence\
    \ the likelihood of errors in a protocol\n  implementation.  These include the\
    \ complexity of the protocol, quality\n  of the protocol specification, the experience\
    \ of the implementors, and\n  the availability of test tools.  Based on the availability\
    \ of the NBS\n  test tools and formal protocol specification for TP-4, the committee\n\
    \  did not see any significant risk of errors in implementing TP-4.\n Performance\
    \ Issues\n  The largest risk in implementing TP-4 concerns the performance of\
    \ the\n  implementations.  This risk is not inherent in the protocol as\n  specified,\
    \ but is present in new implementations of any transport\n  protocol.  Experience\
    \ has shown that performance can often be improved\n  by a factor of two or more\
    \ by careful attention to implementation\n  details and careful performance measurement\
    \ and tuning.  The committee\n  considered it likely that some initial implementations\
    \ of TP-4 will\n  have significantly lower performance than the current mature\n\
    \  implementations of TCP.  Evidence to support this conclusion may be\n  found\
    \ in data supplied by the DOD which show a wide range of\n  performance of TCP\
    \ implementations.\n  Some members of the committee expressed the belief that\
    \ over the long\n  term, TP-4 will afford better performance due to widespread\
    \ commercial\n  support.  Vendors will be highly motivated to optimize performance\
    \ of\n  their TP-4 implementations, since a large number of users will\n  benchmark\
    \ implementation performance.  Many individuals will become\n  familiar with implementations\
    \ of TP-4 and with configuring and\n  operating networks based on TP-4.  Initially,\
    \ this expertise will be\n  found in organizations developing TP-4 implementations\
    \ and\n  installation.\n  The committee believes that the largest performance\
    \ risks are short\n  term.  The performance of existing DOD high-level protocols\
    \ may be\n  affected by subtle differences between TP-4 and TCP interfaces.\n\
    \  Highlevel DOD implementations and protocols may require retuning to\n  attain\
    \ some high-level efficiency using TP-4.  Another short-term risk\n  is potential\
    \ lack of experience in configuring and operating\n  TP-4-based networks.  The\
    \ committee believes that a program of testing\n  and development would minimize\
    \ these risks, ensuring that the current\n  high-level DOD protocols run effectively\
    \ on TP-4-based networks.\n  There is a possibility that the equivalent, but different,\
    \ protocol\n  mechanisms and interfaces in TP-4 may manifest some undesirable\n\
    \  behavior that is not expected and which cannot easily be removed by\n  modifications\
    \ to TP-4. It is unlikely that such problems will be\n  serious enough to prevent\
    \ an early transition to TP-4.  If such\n  problems are discovered, it is expected\
    \ that they can be handled\n  through the normal standards process of periodic\
    \ enhancement.  A\n  number of proprietary commercial networking protocols are\
    \ similar in\n  operation to TP-4 and do not have serious performance problems.\
    \ Any\n  enhancements that may be desirable can probably be added to TP-4 in a\n\
    \  compatible fashion, permitting interoperation of enhanced and\n  unenhanced\
    \ implementations.\n"

    \ likely that some early TP-4 products will\n implement this null IP, leaving\
    \ implementation of the complete IP for\n future product development. In the following\
    \ discussion, TP-4 and IP\n will be treated separately due to this potential independence.\n\
    \ TP-4 Status and Plans\n  The ISO TP-4 became a Draft International Standard\
    \ in September 1983.\n  The final stages in standardization are primarily procedural.\
    \  The\n  committee expects products that implement TP-4 to be widely available\n\
    \  in the market within about two years.  It normally takes twelve to\n  eighteen\
    \ months for implementations and testing prior to product\n  announcement. Some\
    \ vendors apparently began implementation and testing\n  soon after it became\
    \ a draft proposal in June 1982, because the\n  protocol was essentially frozen\
    \ at that time.\n  At present, INTEL and Able Computer have announced the availability\
    \ of\n  products that implement TP-4 for use over LANs.  The committee does\n\
    \  not know, however, whether these products have been delivered or\n  incorporated\
    \ into systems.  In addition, more than twenty companies\n  have indicated their\
    \ support of TP-4 and their intention to\n  incorporate TP-4 into future products,\
    \ without announcing specific\n  products or availability dates.  Most companies\
    \ do not make specific\n  product announcements until relatively late in the product\
    \ development\n  process.\n  In December 1982 six vendors and network users interested\
    \ in early\n  development of TP-4 products requested NBS to hold a series of\n\
    \  workshops on the operation of TP-4 in a LAN environment.  To date,\n  four\
    \ workshops have been held, with more than thirty companies in\n  attendance.\
    \  The first workshop set a goal of demonstrating\n  multivendor networking at\
    \ a major U.S. national computer conference.\n  The second workshop, held in April\
    \ 1983, determined that\n  demonstrations would include a file transfer application\
    \ and would be\n  developed on two local area network technologies currently\n\
    \  standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n  (IEEE).\
    \  These technologies are the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with\n  Collision\
    \ Detection, which is standardized by IEEE committee 802.3,\n  and the Token Bus,\
    \ which is standardized by IEEE committee 803.4.  The\n  workshop selected the\
    \ National Computer Conference in July 1984 for\n  the demonstrations.\n  Vendors\
    \ committed to the demonstration developed and tested TP-4\n  implementations\
    \ using the NBS test tools.  The workshops defined a\n  schedule that called for\
    \ individual testing through April 1984 with\n  multivendor testing commencing\
    \ thereafter.  While the vendors that\n  participated in the demonstration have\
    \ emphasized that participation\n  in the demonstration is not a commitment to\
    \ product development, a\n  number of large customers have indicated that there\
    \ will be an\n  immediate market demand for TP-4 implementation as soon after\
    \ the\n  demonstration as practical.  The committee considers it highly likely\n\
    \  that many commercial vendors will announce commitments to deliver TP-4\n  products\
    \ shortly after the demonstration.\n Internetwork Protocol Status and Plans\n\
    \  The ISO Internetwork Protocol (IP) became a Draft International\n  Standard\
    \ (DIS) in May 1984 (13).  The DIS was out for ballot for the\n  previous eight\
    \ months.  Attaining DIS status freezes the technical\n  approach, permitting\
    \ implementations to begin.\n"

  contents:
  - "Communications -- Protocol for Providing Connectionless Network\n  The ISO IP\
    \ specification is only one of several specifications needed\n  to completely\
    \ specify the Network Layer.  A number of other\n  specifications are needed,\
    \ including a Gateway-to-Host error protocol,\n  a network wide addressing plan,\
    \ and a Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol for\n  managing routing information.  A complete\
    \ specification is needed\n  before an internetwork, consisting of gateways and\
    \ hosts, can be\n  deployed.  Most of the complexity of the Network Layer, however,\
    \ is\n  confined to the gateways.  A complete standardization of the Network\n\
    \  Layer is not required to develop and deploy host systems.\n  The International\
    \ Standards Organization is currently developing\n  proposals for conveying error\
    \ information between hosts and gateways.\n  It is expected that responses to\
    \ the Draft Proposal by ISO members\n  will include proposals to provide these\
    \ functions.  The committee does\n  not consider this a controversial area and\
    \ expects that these\n  capabilities will be included in the ISO standard by the\
    \ time it\n  reaches Draft International Status.\n  Addressing is a more complex\
    \ issue.  The addressing structure of a\n  computer internetwork depends on complex\
    \ trade-offs between\n  implementation complexity, flexibility, network cost,\
    \ and network\n  robustness.  Addressing structure in a large network can influence\
    \ the\n  range of possible policy decisions available for routing network\n  traffic.\
    \  The trade-offs for a military environment may be\n  significantly different\
    \ from those of a commercial environment.  The\n  ISO has considered these factors\
    \ in its existing IP.  A flexible\n  addressing scheme is provided, permitting\
    \ implementation of a variety\n  of addressing structures.  Host computers need\
    \ not be concerned with\n  the internal structure of addresses.  The committee\
    \ considers that the\n  IP-addressing scheme has sufficient flexibility that host\n\
    \  implementations can be constructed that will support the full range of\n  addressing\
    \ philosophies allowed by ISO, including those needed by DOD.\n  Routing algorithms,\
    \ like addressing, are complex and often\n  controversial. For this reason ISO\
    \ has not yet attempted\n  standardization of routing algorithms.  A routing algorithm\
    \ is a key\n  part of a Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol.  A single network must\n\
    \  implement a common routing algorithm.  In the absence of an ISO\n  routing\
    \ algorithm, a network must be based on either proprietary\n  routing algorithms\
    \ or on other standards.\n  The committee has studied the current ISO IP and the\
    \ current ISO\n  addressing structure.  It believes that it will be possible to\
    \ map the\n  current DOD IP-addressing structure and routing algorithm into the\
    \ ISO\n  network layer.  In practice this means that the Gateway-to-Host\n  Protocols\
    \ and addressing formats will fully comply with the ISO\n  standards, while gateways\
    \ will need to include additional DOD\n  capabilities.  (This is addressed in\
    \ recommendations, section IX.)\n  This approach will enable DOD to procure commercial\
    \ host\n  implementations, while retaining the need for procuring DOD-specific\n\
    \  gateways.  The committee believes these hybrid DOD-ISO gateways can be\n  readily\
    \ developed by modifying existing DOD gateway implementations.\n  the committee\
    \ considers this approach worthwhile.\n  To the committee's knowledge no vendor\
    \ has yet announced plans to\n  support the ISO Internetwork Protocol.  This is\
    \ not surprising, since\n  the ISO IP attained Draft Proposal status only recently.\
    \  The\n  committee has considered the possibility that the ISO IP may not\n \
    \ attain the same wide level of market demand and vendor support\n  anticipated\
    \ by TP-4.  Since host support of IP is necessary for DOD to\n  migrate to ISO\
    \ protocols, the committee has considered this question\n  in some depth.\n  While\
    \ it is possible to operate TP-4 directly over a LAN or directly\n  over an X.25-based,\
    \ wide-area network, some form of internetwork\n  capability or alternative approach\
    \ is needed to interconnect systems\n  attached to multiple LANs via Wide Area\
    \ Networks (WANs).  In the\n  current ISO open systems architecture, this function\
    \ is to be provided\n  by the Network layer. There are two possible Network layer\
    \ services,\n  connectionless and connection oriented.  The ISO architecture permits\n\
    \  both of these services, leaving it to the market place to determine\n  which\
    \ approach is to be selected.  The DOD believes that the\n  connectionless approach\
    \ best suits their needs.\n  Developing a connection-oriented network that operates\
    \ over a mixed\n  LAN and WAN environment is considerably more difficult than\
    \ developing\n  a connectionless one.  Existing LANs are inherently connectionless\
    \ and\n  existing (X.25) WANs are inherently connection oriented.  A protocol\n\
    \  to provide internetwork service between these LANs must arrive at a\n  common\
    \ subnetwork capability.  It is a relatively simple matter to\n  adapt a connection-oriented\
    \ to a connectionless service since it can\n  be done by ignoring unneeded functions\
    \ of the connection-oriented\n  service.  Adapting a connectionless subnetwork\
    \ to the needs of a\n  connection-oriented network service is much more difficult.\
    \  Many of\n  the functions provided by TP-4 would be needed in the network layer\
    \ to\n  build such a service.\n  Some work is currently going on in European Computer\
    \ Manufacturer's\n  Association (ECMA) to interconnect WANs and LANs in a\n  connection-oriented\
    \ fashion.  There is considerable controversy\n  surrounding several proposals,\
    \ since some participants in the\n  standards process do not believe the proposals\
    \ conform to the ISO\n  Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection. This,\
    \ plus their\n  complexity, makes it unlikely that a connection-oriented network\n\
    \  standard will gain support in ISO in the immediate future.\n  There is an immediate\
    \ need for users to build networks consisting of\n  interconnected LANs and WANs.\
    \  Such networks are currently in place\n  using vendor proprietary architectures.\
    \  Market pressures to build\n  multivendor LAN and WAN networks make it quite\
    \ likely that vendors\n  will adopt the immediate solution and implement the connectionless\
    \ ISO\n  IP.  The committee believes that DOD can enhance the early\n  availability\
    \ of ISO IP by announcing its intention to use it.\n  Commercial availability\
    \ of IP is an important part of a migration\n  committee believes that vendors\
    \ would be responsive to DOD requests\n  for IP, since IP is quite simple to implement\
    \ in comparison with TP-4\n  and since they foresee the need to operate in mixed\
    \ LAN-WAN\n  environments.\n                              V.  MARKETS\n"

  - "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NETWORKS MARKET STATUS AND PLANS\n The major networks of\
    \ the Defense Data Network include the following:\n  Military Network (MILNET)--operational\
    \ and growing.\n  Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)--operational\
    \ and\n  growing.\n  WWMCCS Intercomputer Network (WIN)--to be upgraded.\n  DOD\
    \ Intelligence Information System (DODIIS)--to be upgraded.\n  Strategic Air Command\
    \ Digital Information Network (SACDIN)--to be\n  upgraded.\n  Movement Information\
    \ Network (MINET)--to be established in 1984.\n  Sensitive Compartmented Information\
    \ (SCI) net--to be established in\n  1985.\n  TOP SECRET (TS) net--to be established\
    \ in 1985.\n  SECRET net--to be established in 1986.\n Initially, each of these\
    \ networks has its own backbone.  The networks\n will be integrated into a common\
    \ Defense Data Network in a series of\n phases starting in 1984 with the integration\
    \ of MILNET and MINET.  It\n is planned that by 1988 they will all be integrated\
    \ but communities of\n interest will operate at different security classifications\n\
    \ interconnected with Internet Private Line Interfaces (IPLIs).  When\n appropriate\
    \ technology becomes available in the late 1980s, the network\n will have the\
    \ capability for multilevel security, including end-to-end\n encryption, and will\
    \ achieve interoperability between all users.\n The following observations are\
    \ relevant to the TCP and TP-4 issue:\n  The DOD currently has two major networks,\
    \ MILNET and ARPANET,\n  currently comprising the DDN.  About sixty subnets and\
    \ hundreds of\n  hosts are internetted and most use TCP.\n  This year a European\
    \ network, MINET, will be activated and integrated\n  into the DDN.  It uses TCP.\n\
    \  In the second half of 1983, fifteen additional subscribers have been\n  added\
    \ to MILNET and current planning estimates hundreds more\n  additional subscribers\
    \ in 1984 and 1985.\n  For the many DDN users that are, or shortly will be, interconnected\n\
    \  over common backbones, there are groups of users that need\n  interoperability\
    \ within the group.  These groups are determined by the\n  military department\
    \ they are part of as well as by functions such as\n  logistics, maintenance,\
    \ training, and many others.\n  The Air Force and the Army are both committed\
    \ to the use of TCP for\n  some of their networks or subnetworks (including Local\
    \ Area\n  Networks) and active acquisition programs are underway, or will be\n\
    \  initiated, during the next twelve to eighteen months.\n  The DDN Program Office\
    \ has procured, or shortly will procure, devices\n  to facilitate terminal and\
    \ host access to DDN hosts and terminals.\n  These devices employ TCP.\n  NATO\
    \ has discussed protocol standards and has selected ISO as an\n  approach, subject\
    \ to its being adapted to meet military requirements,\n  if such adaptation is\
    \ necessary.  There is no definitive planning\n  underway, however, to develop\
    \ a NATO computer network.\n  The Mail Bridge that will allow traffic to pass\
    \ between the classified\n  segment and the unclassified segment will use TCP\
    \ and is scheduled for\n  a 1987 Initial Operational Capability (IOC).\n  In general,\
    \ the backbone in the various networks provides functions at\n  layers below TCP\
    \ and TP-4.  As a result a backbone (such as MILNET)\n  could support users of\
    \ either protocol set.  The users of one set\n  could not, however, interoperate\
    \ with the users of another unless\n  additional steps are taken.\n In summary,\
    \ there is a large TCP community operational today and the\n community is growing\
    \ rapidly.  In addition, there are, or shortly will\n be, procurements underway\
    \ that plan to use TCP.  The rate of growth\n cannot be precisely estimated in\
    \ part because of uncertainties in\n demand and availability of trunks and cryptographic\
    \ equipment.  On the\n other hand, interconnection of several major networks will\
    \ not take\n place until 1987 or later; and for those elements that are\n interconnected,\
    \ there are many groups of users that primarily require\n interoperability with\
    \ each other.\n System Descriptions\n  MILNET is a network for handling the unclassified\
    \ operational data of\n  the DOD.  It was created after the decision in 1982 to\
    \ cancel the\n  AUTODIN II system by dividing the ARPANET into two nets, MILNET\
    \ and\n  ARPA Research Net.  The majority of the capacity of ARPANET was\n  assigned\
    \ to MILNET, and the number of subscribers is growing rapidly.\n  The network\
    \ backbone does not require the use of TCP but its use is\n  generally mandated\
    \ for subscribers. To achieve TCP functions, the DDN\n  will procure some interface\
    \ devices and thereby take the burden off\n  some subscribers.\n  ARPANET supports\
    \ most of the research organizations sponsored by\n  DARPA.  It generally uses\
    \ TCP but some users continue to use NCP.\n  MINET is a European network scheduled\
    \ for Initial Operational\n  Capability (IOC) in 1984 to handle unclassified operational\
    \ traffic,\n  mostly logistical, and tie into the MILNET.  It will have 8 nodes,\
    \ 8\n  TACs, and 3 hosts to process electronic mail.  These hosts and others\n\
    \  to be added to the net will use TCP and the File Transfer Protocol\n  The Department\
    \ of Defense Intelligence Information System currently\n  uses a home-grown protocol.\
    \  Sometime after 1984 its plans are to\n  upgrade it to TCP.  It will be a 3-node,\
    \ 3-host net with plans to\n  upgrade it to 20 to 30 nodes and about 50 hosts.\
    \  The net is run at a\n  high-security level (SCI) for communicating compartmented\
    \ data.  The\n  SCI network consists of those users of SCI who are outside of\
    \ DODIIS.\n  SACDIN is an upgrade of the digital communications system of the\n\
    \  Strategic Air Command.  The IOC is planned for about 1985.  At\n  present,\
    \ TCP is not planned initially as a protocol.  SACDIN will\n  operate with multilevel\
    \ security up to Top Secret sensitive\n  information.\n  WIN is the WWMCCS Information\
    \ Network.  It is currently operational\n  and uses NCP as a transport protocol.\
    \ There is a major effort underway\n  to modernize the WWMCCS, including upgrading\
    \ or replacing current\n  computers, providing Local Area Networks at major centers\
    \ throughout\n  the world, and providing common software packages for utilities\
    \ and\n  some applications. The upgrading of the transport protocols is part of\n\
    \  this effort.  Schedules are still uncertain but there is a target of\n  1986\
    \ for the protocol upgrading.\n  TOP SECRET is a network that will support top\
    \ secret users other than\n  WIN and SACDIN.\n  SECRET net is a network that will\
    \ operate at the Secret level.  It\n  should be very useful for a large community\
    \ that does not routinely\n  need top secret or compartmented information.  This\
    \ is a community\n  primarily outside the command and intelligence communities\
    \ and\n  includes missions such as logistics, procurement, and research and\n\
    \  development.  DOD will start the system as soon as there is sufficient\n  cryptographic\
    \ equipment; by 1986 they hope to have a 90-node network\n  with several hundred\
    \ subscribers.\n  The Army plans to establish a Headquarters Net tying together\
    \ major\n  headquarters with an IOC of 1986.  It will use TCP.\n  The Air Force\
    \ has established a Program Office to help in the\n  development of Local Area\
    \ Networks at major Air Force installations.\n  These could be internetted using\
    \ the DDN and thereby also gain access\n  to other nodes. TCP has been mandated.\
    \  Initial procurements are\n  underway.\n  Mail Bridge will provide gateways\
    \ between ARPA Research Net and other\n  elements of the DDN.  These would use\
    \ TCP and are scheduled for IOC in\n  1987.\n  During 1984 the DDN is procuring\
    \ two capabilities that will facilitate\n  use of the network and higher-level\
    \ protocols.\n  The first capability will be provided shortly by Network Access\n\
    \  Controllers (NAC).  The NACs provide three elements all based on TCP:\n   1.\
    \   Terminal Access Controllers (TACs) allow a cluster of terminals\n        to\
    \ access hosts on the DDN.  Many are in operation today as a\n        legacy of\
    \ the ARPANET developments.  New ones will be\n        competitively procured.\n\
    \   2.   Terminal Emulation Processes (TEP) allow the connection of a\n      \
    \  high-capacity host to the DDN through a number of terminal-like\n        lines.\n\
    \   3.   Host Front-End Processors (HFP) allow high-capacity host\n        connection\
    \ to the DDN through use of a Network Front End that\n        off loads much processing\
    \ capacity from the host.\n  The second capability will be provided by software\
    \ the DDN is\n  currently procuring for up to seventeen families of specific\n\
    \  combinations of hosts and their commercially available operating\n  systems.\
    \  The software packages will include 1822 or X.25, TCP, and\n  utility protocols\
    \ for terminal access, mail, and file transfer.\n  Initial operational capability\
    \ is planned for late 1985.\n Integration\n  MINET will be connected to MILNET\
    \ in 1984.  This will be an\n  unclassified network.\n  WIN, DODIIS, SECRET, and\
    \ SACDIN will be integrated as a classified\n  network in 1987 at the earliest.\
    \  Since they all operate at different\n  security levels, they will be able to\
    \ use the same DDN backbone but\n  will be cryptologically isolated.\n  Integration\
    \ and interoperability of all the networks will not be\n  possible until the late\
    \ 1980s at the earliest, since this will require\n  successful implementation\
    \ of an advanced technology for end-to-end\n  cryptological networking and the\
    \ development of techniques for\n  multilevel security in individual and netted\
    \ computer systems.\n  The use of gateways as elements to integrate networks is\
    \ under\n  consideration.  Gateways are currently operational to interconnect\n\
    \  MILNET with (l) ARPANET (six gateways primarily used to exchange mail\n  between\
    \ authorized users), (2) MINET (one gateway for use prior to\n  integration of\
    \ the two networks into one), and (3) eight\n  developmentally oriented networks.\
    \ There are many more gateways\n  internetting ARPANET with other research nets.\
    \  Most of these gateways\n  use the ARPA-developed Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol.\
    \  It is now\n  realized that this protocol is deficient for widespread use and\
    \ ARPA\n  has been investigating alternatives.\n  The earliest requirement for\
    \ additional gateways in the operational\n  elements of the DDN will be to internet\
    \ Local Area Networks into\n  global networks of the DDN.  A new \"stub\" protocol\
    \ has been developed\n  that might meet this need.  The DDN is reviewing its requirements\
    \ for\n  available gateways and approaches.\n"

    \ and most countries of the world, national\n standards organizations adopt international\
    \ data communication\n standards.\n In the United States the standards for the\
    \ transport protocols are\n established by the American National Standards Institute\
    \ (ANSI).  The\n same standards for the federal sector are established by the\
    \ NBS with\n an exception for DOD's military needs which may be established by\
    \ MIL\n standards. Market demand for the latter was previously discussed.\n Outside\
    \ the DOD there are numerous government agencies and\n organizations such as the\
    \ Federal Aviation Agency, Internal Revenue\n Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\
    \ and the Federal Reserve\n Banks which have, or will have, networks that fall\
    \ under the guidance\n of the NBS and will probably use the NBS-specified standard\
    \ protocols\n when the NBS standard is issued.  Already the Federal Reserve is\n\
    \ procuring its computer networking products using the X.25 protocol.\n National\
    \ Support of International Standards\n  The earliest evidence of demand for TP-4\
    \ products is in countries that\n  give strong support for ISO standards.  Most\
    \ countries outside of the\n  United States give the international standards much\
    \ stronger\n  governmental support than the United States does for a variety of\n\
    \  reasons. First, in most cases these governments own the postal and\n  telecommunication\
    \ monopolies.  Frequently, the responsibility for\n  these organizations is at\
    \ a ministerial level in the government.\n  Furthermore, many of the modern countries\
    \ have concluded that the\n  information industry is a national resource and one\
    \ of the growth\n  industries of the future.  International standards that are\
    \ neutral,\n  in the sense that no manufacturer has a head start, give the companies\n\
    \  in these countries the additional margin they feel is necessary to\n  compete\
    \ in the worldwide market.  It is also recognized by many that a\n  worldwide\
    \ market is much better than a market demand fragmented by\n  national geographic\
    \ and political considerations. Finally, the PTTs\n  have traditionally provided\
    \ information services equivalent to those\n  for which some of the ISO computer\
    \ communication protocols are\n  designed.  The best example is Teletext, which\
    \ is an upgraded version\n  of the Telex system used widely outside the United\
    \ States.\n  Consequently, government networks in many countries use the\n  international\
    \ ISO standards or the national standards derived from the\n  international standards.\
    \  Bid requests for government networks in\n  France and Germany, for example,\
    \ have required support for ISO\n  protocols for over a year even though the standards\
    \ are not yet fully\n  approved.  These bids ask the respondent only to state\
    \ support for the\n  protocols.  No doubt, as the ISO protocols become stable,\
    \ these\n  countries will require the protocols for their networks.  These\n \
    \ government networks will further influence the implementation of\n  networks\
    \ not actually required to use the international and national\n"
- title: MARKET SEGMENTS NOT REQUIRED TO USE TCP OR TP-4
  contents:
  - "MARKET SEGMENTS NOT REQUIRED TO USE TCP OR TP-4\n Most of the demand for communication\
    \ protocols comes from potential\n customers who are under no government fiat\
    \ to use either TCP or TP-4\n protocols in their networks or network products.\
    \  Many of these will\n use existing supplier-specified protocols.  Such protocols\
    \ have been\n embedded in products for over ten years and are well tested both\n\
    \ formally and through field experience in thousands of networks.\n Continuing\
    \ demand for these protocols will not contribute to the\n relative demand for\
    \ either TCP or TP-4.\n There are widely recognized advantages in using international\
    \ standard\n protocols for computer communications.  First, there is tremendous\n\
    \ value in exchanging information with other information users.  As the\n standard\
    \ protocols become widely used, the value of the information\n accessible through\
    \ networks using these protocols is normally greater\n than the value of information\
    \ accessible through less widely used\n networks protocols. This is the reason\
    \ that industry groups such as\n airlines, banks, and insurance companies band\
    \ together to set up common\n networks.  Similarly, it is recognized that there\
    \ are economies of\n scale for widely used networking protocols both in the sense\
    \ that\n equipment can be obtained at lower cost and in the sense that the\n manufacturer's\
    \ improvements in performance, function, and cost will be\n repaid by market demand.\
    \  In addition, many network protocol users wish\n to have the option to procure\
    \ equipment from a wide variety of vendors.\n Sometimes international standards\
    \ encourage this environment.  Finally,\n international organizations would prefer\
    \ to have common procurement of\n equipment and software for worldwide operations.\
    \  Thus international\n standards are preferred for operational as well as logistic\n\
    \ considerations.\n In the United States much of the demand for TP-4 will develop\
    \ in the\n industries that exchange information regularly with entities of the\n\
    \ federal government.  If the Federal Reserve were to use the TP-4\n standard\
    \ for exchanging information with member banks, for example,\n there would be\
    \ pressure on the banks to use TP-4.  Similarly, if DOD\n suppliers wish to have\
    \ easy access to DOD employees using a system\n based on TCP, they would need\
    \ to use TCP.  Also many of the\n university-oriented networks use the ARPANET\
    \ protocols to exchange\n information with other university ARPANET users.\n The\
    \ committee concludes that the demand for TP-4 in the United States\n will significantly\
    \ out weigh the demand for TCP independent of DOD's\n adoption of TP-4.  If DOD\
    \ adopts the ISO TP-4 immediately or if DOD\n adopts TP-4 after a demonstration,\
    \ the U.S. market demand for TCP\n protocols will disappear as the current networks\
    \ are converted to TP-4.\n If DOD chooses to use the DOD TCP indefinitely, clearly\
    \ the DOD and\n ARPANET demand for TCP will continue.\n A similar set of market\
    \ forces operates outside the United States\n except that the foreign governments\
    \ are more strongly in favor of\n international and national standards and have\
    \ smaller investments in\n the standards in order to share information.  This\
    \ is illustrated by\n the extremely strong support for ISO efforts.  The European\
    \ Computer\n Manufacturers Association has been active in the TP-4 standardization\n\
    \ effort.  NATO appears committed to TP-4 implementations, and there is\n likely\
    \ to be intense competition in this arena.  Lacking the federal\n government support\
    \ of two different protocol suites, there is a\n stronger force to adopt a single\
    \ international standard in most\n countries.  There are other countries with\
    \ a similar problem, however.\n Germany is beginning to install systems based\
    \ on its unique national\n standard but has committed to convert eventually to\
    \ ISO protocols.\n The committee concludes that there will be little market demand\
    \ for the\n TCP protocols outside the United States.  The strong international\n\
    \ demand will be for ISO protocols, including TP-4.\n   VI.  DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD\

  contents:
  - "PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT VERSUS SYSTEM INTEGRATION\n It is assumed in this discussion\
    \ that off-the-shelf commercial products\n can be used through system integration\
    \ to construct system solutions.\n Most vendors supply both standard products\
    \ and system integration\n services.  Some vendors supply only the integration\
    \ functions, using\n other vendors' products.  System integration adds value to\
    \ the product\n and in some cases results in modifications of the product to meet\n\
    \ system requirements. When standard products are used, the\n responsibility for\
    \ continuing maintenance and improvements almost\n always can be passed to the\
    \ product developer.  Thus in this discussion\n we assume that off-the-shelf commercial\
    \ products are standard products\n supplied by vendors to implement one or more\
    \ transport-level protocols\n for the DOD.\n"
- title: CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STANDARD PRODUCTS
  contents:
  - "CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STANDARD PRODUCTS\n The product vendor's choice to\
    \ develop a standard product is governed\n by market requirements, economic opportunities,\
    \ and other design\n considerations. In the case of data transmission products,\
    \ market\n requirements include competition, connection to the installed base\
    \ of\n products, market growth, and satisfaction of the standards requirements\n\
    \ of customers.\n Often the vendor will develop a product that supports several\
    \ protocols\n as options.  Usually only one or two protocols will be selected\
    \ for\n primary support, and all other options are considered for secondary\n\
    \ support. The primary protocols selected for implementation are based\n upon\
    \ the largest potential market for the vendor.  These protocols\n become the vendor's\
    \ standard products.  Standard products are announced\n for sale and supported\
    \ on a continuing basis.  Implementations of\n secondary protocols are often adaptations\
    \ of the implementations of\n standard protocols and may be suboptimal with respect\
    \ to performance\n and continuing vendor support. Often secondary implementations\
    \ are\n created when an RFP is issued and the vendor who wishes to respond to\n\
    \ the RFP must create a special product to do so.  This committee\n believes that,\
    \ in general, future standard data transmission products\n will be either TP-4\
    \ or vendor-unique protocols and TCP will be a\n special product.\n"
- title: STANDARD VERSUS SPECIAL PRODUCT
  contents:
  - "STANDARD VERSUS SPECIAL PRODUCT\n Within the OSI architectural model, seven layers\
    \ are defined, each of\n which will have protocols defined for interconnection\
    \ of systems.\n These protocols are controlled by standards.  TP-4 is an example\
    \ of a\n protocol for the transport layer.  These protocols will be implemented\n\
    \ on many vendor systems that have different systems architecture,\n different\
    \ operating system architectures, and, therefore, differences\n in the specifics\
    \ of the layer interface.  The vendor systems will be\n designed to optimize the\
    \ specific environments that each vendor has\n determined are most important to\
    \ satisfy the major market objective for\n that vendor's particular computer architectures.\
    \  This determines the\n vendor's standard system and architecture. Support of\
    \ special\n requirements will frequently be designed as modifications to a standard\n\
    \ system, using translators and other techniques to bridge the\n differences in\
    \ layer interface definitions, operating systems\n structure, and protocols. \
    \ Most support activity, optimization of\n performance and resource usage will\
    \ be directed at the standard system\n architecture selected by the supplier.\n\
    \ Special-Product Process\n  Special-product development is initiated to meet\
    \ customer\n  specifications. The specifications, schedule, and cost assume that\n\
    \  special products are released using an existing version of the\n  software\
    \ system (operating system, language, communications, and data\n  manager).  Support\
    \ for the special product is conditioned on a support\n  contract.  The special\
    \ product is tested and released with that\n  system.  This provides the fastest\
    \ availability of the product, since\n  the schedule will only include the time\
    \ to develop the product and\n  test it with the selected system.  It is likely\
    \ that by the time a\n  product and its software system are delivered, a newer\
    \ version of the\n  software system containing code corrections and added functions\
    \ and\n  other new products will have been released.  Additional cost to the\n\
    \  customer is required if the vendor is to modify the special product to\n  operate\
    \ on this new version of software.  This occurs frequently in a\n  rapidly developing\
    \ technology.  If the special product is not\n  modified, operational and maintenance\
    \ expenses may increase.\n Standard-Product Process\n  A standard product is developed\
    \ to meet the market requirements of a\n  market area.  The development of a standard\
    \ product generally has a\n  target date that is used as a basis for scheduling\
    \ system development,\n  fabrication, and testing into a planned software system\
    \ release.  The\n  product then is included in the test and integration plan for\
    \ the\n  system release and integration into a systems test procedure to assure\n\
    \  operation with the other parts of the software system.  The standard\n  product\
    \ then becomes a part of the software system, and as new\n  releases of the system\
    \ are made, the product is tested as a part of\n  the integrated system to assure\
    \ that it still operates with the\n  revised, new system.  The product may also\
    \ be enhanced to satisfy new\n  then will operate with the latest software system\
    \ release.\n  The integration process complicates the development process.  The\n\
    \  increased complexity may result in a longer development schedule or\n  may\
    \ require more resources than special products require since (1) the\n  cycle\
    \ may involve a longer product requirement definition, (2)\n  additional planning\
    \ and integration testing may be needed to\n  coordinate the product design with\
    \ other system activities, and (3)\n  there is the possibility of up to twelve\
    \ months' delay in scheduling a\n  software system release, which for most vendors\
    \ generally occurs at 6-\n  to 12 month intervals.  The product may be maintained\
    \ with a\n  corrective code released in intermediate system fabrication and\n\
    \  integrated into the following software release. Different categories\n  of\
    \ support may be available and these categories may vary by product.\n  The support\
    \ categories may range from no support to full unlimited\n  warranty.\n"
- title: CONCLUSION
  contents:
  - "CONCLUSION\n The committee concludes that there are significant benefits for\
    \ the\n Department of Defense in using standard commercial products that meet\n\
    \ the department's operational needs:\n  Costs to the DOD for development, production,\
    \ and maintenance are\n  significantly lower because (l) vendors spread the cost\
    \ over a much\n  larger user base, (2) commercial vendors have to be efficient\
    \ in their\n  operations in view of the competition in the market, and (3) vendors\n\
    \  look for ways to upgrade their product to meet competition.\n  The department\
    \ may get additional useful products because vendors\n  integrate the protocol\

    \ the DOD may be able eventually to use\n  standard commercial software application\
    \ products that are built on\n  top of, and thereby take advantage of, the transport\

- title: Option 1
  contents:
  - "Option 1\n The first option is for the DOD to immediately modify its current\n\
    \ transport policy statement to specify TP-4 as a costandard along with\n TCP.\
    \  In addition, the DOD would develop a military specification for\n TP-4 that\
    \ would also cover DOD requirements for discretionary options\n allowed under\
    \ the NBS protocol specifications.  Requests for proposals\n (RFPs) for new networks\
    \ or major upgrades of existing networks would\n specify TP-4 as the preferred\
    \ protocol.  Contracts for TP-4 systems\n would be awarded only to contractors\
    \ providing commercial products,\n except for unique cases.\n Existing networks\
    \ that use TCP and new networks firmly committed to the\n use of TCP-based systems\
    \ could continue to acquire implementations of\n TCP.  The DOD should carefully\
    \ review each case, however, to see\n whether it would be advantageous to delay\
    \ or modify some of these\n acquisitions in order to use commercial TP-4 products.\
    \  For each\n community of users it should be decided when it is operationally\
    \ or\n economically most advantageous to replace its current or planned\n systems\
    \ in order to conform to ISO standards without excessively\n compromising continued\
    \ operations.\n United States government test facilities would be developed to\
    \ enable\n validation of TP-4 products.  The Department of Defense would either\n\
    \ require that products be validated using these test facilities or be\n certified\
    \ by the vendor.  The test facilities could also be used to\n isolate multivendor\
    \ protocol compatibility problems.  The existing NBS\n validation tools should\
    \ be used as the base for the DOD test\n facilities.\n Because under this option\
    \ networks based on both TCP and TP-4 would\n coexist for some time, several capabilities\
    \ that facilitate\n interoperability among networks would need to be developed.\
    \  The\n Department of Defense generally will not find them commercially\n available.\
    \  Examples are gateways among networks or specialized hosts\n that provide services\
    \ such as electronic mail.  The department would\n need to initiate or modify\
    \ development programs to provide these\n capabilities, and a test and demonstration\
    \ network would be required.\n"

  contents:
  - "Option 2\n Under Option 2 the Department of Defense would immediately announce\
    \ its\n intention to adopt TP-4 as a transport protocol costandard with TCP\n\
    \ after a satisfactory demonstration of its suitability for use in\n military\
    \ networks.  A final commitment would be deferred until the\n demonstration has\
    \ been evaluated and TP-4 is commercially available.\n The demonstration should\
    \ take at most eighteen months and should\n involve development of TP-4 implementations\
    \ and their installation.\n This option differs from Option 1 primarily in postponing\
    \ the adoption\n of a TP-4 standard and, consequently, the issuance of RFPs based\
    \ on\n TP-4 until successful completion of a demonstration.  The department\n\
    \ should, however, proceed with those provisions of Option 1 that may be\n completed\
    \ in parallel with the demonstration.  Early issuance of a TP-4\n military specification,\
    \ development of validation procedures, and\n implementation of means for interoperability\
    \ would be particularly\n important in this regard.\n"

    \ and use of the new protocol in the commercial and\n international arena and,\
    \ with the National Bureau of Standards, work on\n means to transfer data between\

  - "factors if DOD moves toward adopting TP-4 using either Option 1 or 2:\n No major\
    \ subsystem of the DDN (which includes MILNET, DODIIS, WWMCCS,\n and so forth)\
    \ would use both protocols at the same time except possibly\n for a brief transition\
    \ period.\n In only a few selected cases would a capability be required to handle\n\
    \ both protocols.  These cases could include select hosts that use both,\n special\
    \ servers (most likely mail servers) that could provide functions\n between several\
    \ communities of interest using both protocols, or\n translating gateways between\
    \ networks.\n Within the DDN both sets of protocols would be used for a period\
    \ of\n five to ten years starting eighteen months after the DOD approves the\n\
    \ use of TP-4 in a new system.\n In virtually all cases, the phase-over from TCP\
    \ to TP-4 in a subsystem\n of the DDN would be performed at a time when there\
    \ is a major upgrade\n of subsystem elements that include TCP as a part. In other\
    \ words, the\n transition is not merely a substitution of transport or internet\n\
    \ software except in cases where the hardware currently being used is\n from a\
    \ vendor who has started to offer TP-4 as a commercial product.\n Where this is\
    \ not the case, the transition includes the substitution of\n new hardware whose\
    \ vendor provides TP-4 commercially.\n"
- title: COST FACTORS AND MODEL
  contents:
  - "COST FACTORS AND MODEL\n Four major factors must be considered in evaluating\
    \ the costs of the\n three options:\n  1.   How much lower will be the cost of\
    \ commercial, standard-product\n       protocols compared to those developed and\
    \ acquired by the DOD?\n  2.   If DOD decides to adopt TP-4, how quickly can it\
    \ start using it\n       in new systems, and how quickly will it phase TCP out\
    \ of older\n       systems?\n  3.   What will be the one-time cost of management\
    \ and test before DOD\n       is prepared to start using TP-4?\n  4.   What will\
    \ be the marginal costs of maintaining the two standards\n       over the 5- to\
    \ 10-year transition period?\n Savings Using Commercial Software\n  Commercial\
    \ software providing TP-4 will tend to be cheaper than DOD\n  provided TCP because\
    \ commercial one-time and recurring costs\n  (especially the former) can be apportioned\
    \ over a larger consumer\n  base, and the commercial supplier will tend to be\
    \ more efficient.  As\n  in most cases where one compares the cost of one product\
    \ provided by\n  two vendors, there will be situations where a DOD vendor providing\
    \ TCP\n  can do it more cheaply than a commercial vendor providing TP-4.  These\n\
    \  occurrences will be rare but they illustrate the difficulty of\n  developing\
    \ detailed quantitative models that compare the costs.\n  Factors relating to\
    \ competing suppliers go far beyond the transport\n  protocols themselves and\
    \ distort such models.\n  The first argument relating to the size of the consumer\
    \ base has many\n  factors.  For the time period under consideration, DOD represents\n\
    \  about 3 percent of the commercial U.S. computer base.  It would follow\n  that\
    \ DOD should pay much less in development and support costs for the\n  commercial\
    \ products.  But there are other factors.  The number of\n  commercial suppliers\
    \ is larger than the number of DOD suppliers by a\n  factor of 5-10. The DOD's\
    \ need for transport and internet protocols\n  will be greater than the average\
    \ commercial user in the time period\n  under consideration.  If commercial vendors\
    \ break out the costs of\n  developing these protocol features earlier than planned,\
    \ DOD will pick\n  up a larger share of the tab. This could be by a factor of\
    \ 2 or more.\n  A good deal of the one-time development and production costs of\
    \ TCP\n  have already been spent by the DOD or partly written off by DOD\n  vendors.\
    \  This factor would be extremely difficult to estimate, but we\n  do not think\
    \ it is very significant since the major costs in\n  implementation relate to\
    \ processes down-the-line from getting a\n  C-language version.  These down-the-line\
    \ processes must be repeated in\n  great part as families of hardware and software\
    \ are upgraded with\n  system and technology improvements to meet DOD directives\
    \ for standard\n  TCP products.  There are also factors that cut in the other\
    \ direction;\n  if the DOD is only 3 percent of the U.S. commercial user market,\
    \ it is\n  an even smaller fraction of the international user market.  This\n\
    \  latter market is growing;  its need for ISO protocols will be\n  relatively\
    \ higher than the U.S. market, and market share for U.S.\n  manufacturers, including\
    \ foreign subsidiaries, is large and holding\n  its own.\n  The situation is equally\
    \ complex when it comes to comparing the\n  efficiency of commercial vendors with\
    \ DOD vendors when it relates to\n  developing, installing, and maintaining transport\
    \ and internet\n  protocols.  The elements that favor increased efficiency of\
    \ the\n  commercial supplier include the following:\n   The commercial marketplace\
    \ is much larger, less regulated, and is\n   forced, therefore, to seek greater\
    \ efficiency and innovation.\n   Transport and internet protocols represent functions\
    \ that interact\n   very closely with operating systems, the largest portion of\
    \ which are\n   commercial.  The major sources of expertise for dealing with these\n\
    \   operating systems are in the commercial marketplace, primarily with\n   the\
    \ vendors who supply the hardware as well as with vendors who\n   specialize in\
    \ related products.\n   The commercial sector is in the business of managing the\
    \ interplay\n   between operating systems, protocols, related software and hardware\n\
    \   products, new technology and architecture, and the relationship\n   between\
    \ all these and the market.  If DOD adopts TP-4, it will be\n   delegating many\
    \ of these management functions to a marketplace that\n   will generally make\
    \ better and faster decisions.\n  For every dollar that the DOD might invest in\
    \ TCP, how much would it\n  cost to gain comparable capability with TP-4 procured\
    \ as vendor\n  standard products?  The many factors involved make a precise estimate\n\
    \  impossible. We believe, however, that TP-4 can be procured at\n  substantial\
    \ savings and with virtually no economic risk if the market\n  develops as we\
    \ believe it will, with many vendors offering it as a\n  commercial product by\
    \ mid-1986. On the average, we judge the savings\n  to be 30 to 80 percent including\
    \ initial installation, field support,\n  and maintenance.\n How Soon Will TP-4\
    \ Be Used?\n  The sooner that DOD decides to use TP-4, the greater will be DOD's\n\
    \  savings.  These savings can offset the adverse cost factors discussed\n  in\
    \ the next two sections:  the cost to decide to use TP-4 and the\n  added cost\
    \ for the period when two standards (TCP and TP-4) are in\n  use.\n  Currently,\
    \ TCP is generally used in MILNET, MINET, and ARPANET.  As\n  previously stated\
    \ in the assumptions, even if DOD decides to move\n  aggressively toward TP-4,\
    \ there are no evident, strong economic or\n  operational reasons for converting\
    \ these users to the new standards\n  until a major upgrade of the users' communications\
    \ and processing\n  subsystems is planned. Also in the next twelve to eighteen\
    \ months new\n  uses of these nets are planned that will expand existing subnets\
    \ and\n  these new users would use TCP in order to be interoperable with the\n\
    \  current users in their community of interest.\n  In some cases the planning\
    \ for new subnets for new communities of\n  users is well along.  DODIIS is a\
    \ primary example.  Some of these\n  subnets should very likely proceed with TCP,\
    \ but others appear to be\n  prime targets for TP-4 if DOD is to move in the direction\
    \ of adopting\n  TP-4. The WWMCCS and its WIN are probably good examples of the\
    \ latter.\n  Planning and implementation for all of these subsystems must move\n\
    \  ahead, however, and if DOD does not make a firm commitment to TP-4 by\n  probably\
    \ constitute almost half of the growth of the DDN in the next\n  five years. \
    \ In other words, delay of a decision to move to TP-4 until\n  1986 would mean\
    \ that most of the DDN subnets that will exist in the\n  late 1980s will be based\
    \ on TCP, whereas a decision for TP-4 a year\n  earlier could significantly reduce\
    \ this number.\n Cost of Decision to Use TP-4\n  The costs of the decision to\
    \ use TP-4 include the one-time management\n  and test costs that DOD decides\
    \ are needed before a TP-4 commitment\n  and policy can be approved.  Under Option\
    \ 1 these costs are small.\n  Under Option 2 they are significantly higher, although\
    \ the amount will\n  depend on the extent and duration of the testing needed.\
    \  Under Option\n  3 there will be no management and test costs.\n Marginal Costs\
    \ of Maintaining Two Standards\n  If DOD moves toward the gradual introduction\
    \ of TP-4, both standards\n  will have to be maintained for five to ten years.\
    \  The additional\n  costs of maintaining two standards include the following:\n\
    \   Management costs of dealing with two standards.\n   Costs for developing and\
    \ maintaining capabilities for limited\n   intercommunication between systems\
    \ using the different transport and\n   internet protocols.  These include costs\
    \ for gateways,\n   dual-capability hosts, and special servers such as mail.\n\
    \   Parallel validation capability.  The DOD is implementing a validation\n  \
    \ capability for DOD TCP.  This is similar to the currently operational\n   NBS\
    \ facility for TP-4 testing.  If DOD selects Option 1, there is a\n   question\
    \ whether this DOD facility should be completed for TCP\n   (because the number\
    \ of new implementations of TCP would be small\n   several years from now).  If\
    \ DOD selects Option 2, the facility is\n   probably desirable.\n   Costs for\
    \ maintaining research and development (R&D) programs to\n   improve the standards.\
    \  A part of the DARPA and DCA research and\n   development programs in information\
    \ technology is directed at system\n   issues related to TCP.  This includes work\
    \ on internet issues,\n   gateways, and higher-level protocols.  The committee\
    \ has not reviewed\n   the research program for details and cost; however, a commitment\
    \ to\n   move toward ISO standards should affect the program.  Costs would\n \
    \  increase to the extent that the program would be involved with\n   interactions\
    \ with both protocols.  There would be some decreased\n   requirements for R&D\
    \ in light of potential dependence on commercial\n   R&D to improve the standards.\
    \  In the next several years, however,\n   the committee concludes that dual standards\
    \ would, on balance,\n   somewhat increase R&D costs because of the DOD's unique\
    \ operational\n   requirements.\n  These costs are roughly the same for Options\
    \ 1 and 2 and depend on how\n  not provide extensive interoperability between\
    \ TP-4 and TCP-based\n  systems and minimizes costs in other areas, the overall\
    \ costs could be\n  low in comparison with potential savings.\n Evaluation of\
    \ Options by Cost\n  In terms of the previously discussed factors, savings can\
    \ develop in\n  two ways:  by using TP-4 instead of TCP in new systems and by\n\
    \  replacement of TCP with TP-4 in existing systems when this can be done\n  smoothly\
    \ and efficiently.  The earlier that TP-4 is introduced, the\n  greater these\
    \ savings.\n  In contrast costs will be incurred in two ways:  in one-time planning\n\
    \  to use TP-4 and in continuing costs of operating two standards.\n  The following\
    \ is a summary of the cost evaluation of the three options\n  in the near term:\n\
    \  Option 3 is least expensive.  It achieves no commercial savings but\n  has\
    \ no costs for one-time planning and maintenance of dual standards.\n  Option\
    \ 1 is at most only slightly more expensive than Option 3 since\n  one-time planning\
    \ costs (which are much lower than for Option 2) and\n  maintenance costs can\
    \ be significantly offset with commercial savings\n  in the following several\
    \ years.\n  Option 2 is most expensive since it does not realize significant\n\
    \  offsetting commercial savings.\n  In the longer term (beyond the next several\
    \ years) commercial savings\n  for Options 1 and 2 should overtake costs of transition,\
    \ and both\n  these options should cost the same.\n  There is a concern on the\
    \ part of some members of the committee\n  whether the higher near-term costs\
    \ of Option 2 are adequately offset\n  by the Option's long-term savings to warrant\
    \ the transition.\n                       X.  EVALUATION OF OPTIONS\n"

- title: SUMMARY
  contents:
  - "SUMMARY\n Option 1's primary benefit is that it would allow the DOD to obtain\
    \ the\n benefits of standard commercial products in the communication protocol\n\
    \ area at an early date.  These benefits include smaller development,\n procurement,\
    \ and support costs; more timely updates; and a wider\n product availability.\
    \  By immediately committing to TP-4 as a\n costandard for new systems, Option\
    \ 1 minimizes the number of systems\n that have to be converted eventually from\
    \ TCP.  The ability to manage\n the transition is better than with Option 2 since\
    \ the number of systems\n changed would be smaller and the time duration of mixed\
    \ TCP and TP-4,\n operation would be shorter.  Interoperability with external\
    \ systems\n (NATO, government, and commercial), which presumably will use TP-4,\n\
    \ would also be brought about more quickly.  Option 1 involves greater\n risk,\
    \ however, since it commits to a new approach without a\n demonstration of its\
    \ viability.\n As with Option 1, a primary benefit of following Option 2 would\
    \ be\n obtaining the use of standard commercial products.  Unit procurement\n\
    \ costs probably would be lower than with Option 1 since the commercial\n market\
    \ for TP-4 will have expanded somewhat by the time DOD would begin\n to buy TP-4\
    \ products.  Risk is smaller compared to Option 1 since\n testing and demonstration\
    \ of the suitability for military use will have\n preceded the commitment to the\
    \ ISO protocols.  Transition and support\n costs would be higher than for Option\
    \ 1, however, because more networks\n and systems would already have been implemented\
    \ with TCP.  Also this is\n perhaps the most difficult option to manage since\
    \ the largest number of\n system conversions and the longest interval of mixed\
    \ TCP and TP-4\n operations would occur.  In addition, interoperability with external\n\
    \ networks through standardization would be delayed.\n The principal benefit of\
    \ exercising Option 3 would be the elimination\n of transition cost and the risk\
    \ of faulty system behavior and/or delay.\n It would allow the most rapid achievement\
    \ of full internal\n interoperability among DOD systems.  Manageability should\
    \ be good,\n since only one set of protocols would be in use (one with which the\
    \ DOD\n already has much experience) and the DOD would be in complete control\n\
    \ of system evolution. Procurement costs for TCP systems would remain\n high compared\
    \ to standard ISO protocol products, however, and\n availability of implementations\
    \ for new systems and releases would\n remain limited.  External interoperability\
    \ with non-DOD systems would\n be limited and inefficient.\n In summary, Option\
    \ 1 provides the most rapid path toward the use of\n commercial products and interoperability\
    \ with external systems.  Option\n 2 reduces the risk but involves somewhat greater\
    \ delay and expense.\n Option 3 provides a quicker route to interoperability within\
    \ the\n Defense Department and at the least risk, but at a higher life-cycle\n\
    \ cost and incompatibility with NATO and other external systems.\n"
- title: DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OBJECTIVES VERSUS OPTIONS
  contents:
  - "DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OBJECTIVES VERSUS OPTIONS\n The committee has identified a\
    \ set of DOD objectives for transport\n protocols, discussed in Section II of\
    \ this report.  In this section we\n discuss the potential of each of the three\
    \ options for achieving those\n objectives.  The objectives have been grouped\
    \ into five major\n categories that serve as criteria for evaluation of options.\n\
    \ Functional and Performance Objectives\n  There are certain functional and performance\
    \ objectives that standard\n  DOD transport protocols must satisfy.  Key objectives\
    \ include security\n  capabilities, the ability to establish message precedence\
    \ in crisis\n  situations, and survivability of continuing operations when failures\n\
    \  occur and portions of the network become inoperable.  This implies\n  continuous\
    \ availability of the primary data transmission network and\n  the ability to\
    \ reconfigure the networks to operate after some of its\n  nodes are lost.\n \
    \ As previously stated, the two protocols are functionally equivalent.\n  TCP\
    \ and TP-4 have equivalent reliability characteristics and are able\n  to detect\
    \ and recover from failures.  The committee also concludes\n  that robustness,\
    \ availability, and performance in crises are\n  equivalent using either protocol.\
    \  The committee concludes that all\n  three options equally satisfy the functional\
    \ objectives that DOD\n  requires.\n  Since the performance characteristics of\
    \ TCP versus TP-4 will be a\n  function primarily of the particular implementations,\
    \ the committee\n  concludes that the two protocols are sufficiently alike that\
    \ there are\n  no significant differences in performance of a TCP or a TP-4\n\
    \  implementation of equal quality when each is optimized for a given\n  environment.\n\
    \  If Option 1 is selected, early implementations may result in\n  suboptimal\
    \ performance.  Option 2 specifies that there be a\n  demonstration network established\
    \ that will provide time for\n  adjustment, testing, and gaining experience. \
    \ Option 3 would result in\n  no reduction in performance of current networks.\
    \  The maturity of TCP\n  has resulted in many implementations that have demonstrated\
    \ good\n  performance.  This experience provides a knowledge base for future\n\
    \  implementations of either TCP or TP-4. In either case, however,\n  initial\
    \ implementations of TCP or TP-4 may be suboptimal and require\n  additional development\
    \ to optimize performance.\n Maximizing Interoperability\n  A high-priority DOD\
    \ objective is interoperability among its internal\n  networks and among internal\
    \ networks and non-DOD, external networks,\n  including NATO.  Interoperability\
    \ allows users of a network to have\n  access to applications on the same or other\
    \ networks.\n  Option 3 would allow the DOD to increase internal interoperability\n\
    \  most rapidly by continuing to mandate use of TCP for all new systems.\n  Interoperability\
    \ with external systems, however, the vast majority of\n  which are expected to\
    \ use ISO standard protocols, will remain limited.\n  The more quickly DOD moves\
    \ to use TP-4, the more rapidly external\n  interoperability will improve.  In\
    \ the short run internal\n  interoperability will be reduced due to the existence\
    \ of both TCP and\n  TP-4 protocols by different subnets.  This problem is greater\
    \ with\n  Option 2 then Option 1 since the number of systems and the length of\n\
    \  time both protocols are in use is greater.  In both options the\n  problem\
    \ can be reduced by providing special servers and translating\n  gateways to provide\
    \ limited interoperability where needed among\n  subnets using different protocols.\n\
    \ Minimizing Procurement, Development, and Support Costs\n  A DOD goal is to assure\
    \ availability of commercial-grade transport\n  systems from vendors and minimize\
    \ development, procurement, and\n  continuing support costs.  Both Option 1 and,\
    \ after demonstration,\n  Option 2 result in DOD adopting the TP-4 standard that\
    \ has the\n  endorsement of both national (ANSI) and international (ISO) standards\n\
    \  organizations.  Further, this protocol has been endorsed for use by\n  NATO,\
    \ the European Computer Manufacturer's Association, the Computer\n  and Business\
    \ Equipment Manufacturer's Association (CBEMA), and the NBS\n  Institute of Computer\
    \ Sciences and Technology for the information\n  processing community of the federal\
    \ government.\n  The result of the endorsements will be widespread use of the\
    \ standard\n  protocol in worldwide networks and a large number of vendors supplying\n\
    \  commercial grade products supporting TP-4.  As previously noted, many\n  vendors\
    \ have already stated they plan to develop TP-4-based products\n  and many are\
    \ already doing this in-house.  Thus a large market and\n  large vendor base will\
    \ assure the availability of commercial grade\n  TP-4 products.\n  A large market\
    \ and supply of commercial-grade products will give DOD a\n  large competitive\
    \ base from which to select its data transmission\n  systems. The effect will\
    \ be to reduce DOD acquisition cost because\n  large markets allow vendors to\
    \ amortize development and support cost\n  over a large base.  This favors adoption\
    \ of either of the options that\n  results in DOD using TP-4 as its standard.\n\
    \  With the availability of commercial-grade products, vendors will take\n  the\
    \ responsibility for continuing maintenance and enhancements of the\n  systems\
    \ on the host computer systems in which they operate.  With\n  vendor support\
    \ of the products, evolution of both the host computer\n  operating system and\
    \ transmission system will occur in\n  synchronization.  This again favors the\
    \ adoption by DOD of either the\n  Option 1 or Option 2 that results in TP-4.\
    \  In these options much of\n  the support cost is covered by the vendors and\
    \ spread over the large\n  market base.  This reduces the development and maintenance\
    \ cost passed\n  on to the DOD.\n  The committee does not believe that a large\
    \ market beyond the DOD will\n  develop for TCP because worldwide markets for\
    \ products will be based\n  on the ISO standards.  Consequently, if the DOD chooses\
    \ Option 3, only\n  the DOD-dedicated vendors would supply TCP as standard products\n\
    \  resulting in a smaller market and supply for TCP products and limited\n  availability\
    \ of TCP products.\n  If DOD remains with TCP, many commercial vendors will be\
    \ forced to\n  develop and support both the commercial standard products (TP-4)\
    \ and\n  DOD standard special products (TCP) to stay in both markets.  In many\n\
    \  cases only the large market-based products such as TP-4 will be\n  considered\
    \ standard and TCP products will be considered special\n  products.  The effect\
    \ is higher development and support cost to the\n  vendors which would be passed\
    \ on to DOD.  Thus the incentive for\n  continuing enhancement to the special\
    \ product, TCP, would be reduced.\n  This responsibility would be passed to DOD,\
    \ also resulting in higher\n  costs.\n Ease of Transition\n  The DOD is concerned\
    \ with the ease and risk associated with transition\n  from the current network\
    \ architecture using TCP to its future network\n  architecture.  The objectives\
    \ for DOD are to reduce the interruption\n  of data communication services supplied\
    \ by its active networks;\n  minimize the risk of using an immature, untried protocol;\
    \ and maximize\n  the use of the critical skills, knowledge, and experience of\
    \ the\n  engineers who develop the communications products.\n  The maturity of\
    \ TCP and the momentum that exists in the DOD community\n  for implementing future\
    \ systems using TCP would favor Option 3.\n  Selection of Option 3 would minimize\
    \ interruption of service and\n  minimize risk. With this option there would be\
    \ no transition; the DOD\n  would remain with its current policy.  There would\
    \ be no conversion\n  costs and the only risks for DOD would be associated with\
    \ poor\n  implementations of new TCP-based products.\n  The committee believes\
    \ that much of the technical risk is associated\n  with implementations.  Therefore,\
    \ given the relative state of their\n  specifications and implementations as discussed\
    \ earlier, the committee\n  feels that the risks are comparable for implementing\
    \ new products for\n  either TCP or TP-4.  Since DOD is acquiring many new networks\
    \ the\n  implementation risk of either TCP or TP-4 will be equal.\n  specifications\
    \ and in the vendor's implementations through its\n  immediate commitment for\
    \ TP-4 use in new military networks.  DOD will,\n  in effect, be making a commitment\
    \ similar to that of vendors who are\n  planning this protocol for their standard\
    \ products.  Since most new\n  networks would not use a transport protocol other\
    \ than TP-4, this\n  minimizes the number of networks and therefore the cost of\
    \ converting\n  and maintaining TCP networks to TP-4.\n  Since the standard TP-4\
    \ products from vendors are not available today,\n  DOD endorsement of TP-4 may\
    \ have the effect of accelerating vendor\n  development of standard products.\
    \  These products are expected to be\n  generally available by 1986.  Thus Option\
    \ 1 can be consistent with the\n  manufacturers' expected product plans.  Option\
    \ 1 provides, therefore,\n  the least conversion cost but with higher risk for\
    \ DOD conversion.\n  If DOD chooses Option 2, then the risk that TP-4 will not\
    \ meet DOD\n  needs is reduced since there is no commitment to use this protocol\n\
    \  until a successful demonstration is completed.  In the interim, many\n  networks\
    \ will have been committed using TCP, resulting in higher\n  conversion costs\
    \ than with Option 1.  In summary, Option 2 provides a\n  lower risk approach\
    \ for DOD to convert to TP-4, but will encounter the\n  higher conversion cost.\n\
    \  There is a great deal of experience with TCP and thus there is an\n  engineering\
    \ community that is highly knowledgeable about it.  As\n  previously noted, however,\
    \ if DOD remains with TCP, some DOD vendors\n  will be forced to support multiple\
    \ protocol products.  The functional\n  equivalence and similarities between TCP\
    \ and TP-4 permit an easy\n  transition for the experienced engineer to move from\
    \ TCP to TP-4.\n  Option 2 allows more time for this transition to occur, and\
    \ thereby\n  minimizes the risk associated with a complete switch to TP-4.\n \
    \ In addition to the transport protocols, a transition from TCP to TP-4\n  also\
    \ involves the conversion of applications.  The committee has\n  concluded that\
    \ the services provided by TCP and TP-4 are comparable\n  and applications software\
    \ can be moved from TCP to TP-4 without loss\n  of functionality.  Obviously,\
    \ Option 3 requires no conversion to\n  existing applications on current implementations.\
    \  Option 2 will\n  result in more applications interfacing to TCP than Option\
    \ 1, thus\n  potentially increasing conversion costs. In the future DOD could\n\
    \  minimize the cost of conversion by standardizing the services provided\n  by\
    \ the transport layer to the applications.\n Manageability and Responsiveness\
    \ to DOD Requirements\n  The final set of objectives is concerned with the degree\
    \ of difficulty\n  that DOD will experience in managing its installed networks\
    \ and future\n  networks.  As communications requirements evolve, DOD must have\
    \ the\n  ability to alter specifications so they will satisfy new requirements.\n\
    \  Finally, DOD requires facilities for validation of protocol\n  implementations\
    \ as they are added to their networks.\n  difficulty is anticipated.\n  Both Option\
    \ 1 and Option 2 will cause some additional management\n  difficulties since they\
    \ require that the current momentum for adopting\n  TCP to be redirected toward\
    \ TP-4 without loss of intensity.  In\n  addition to this change, DOD must manage\
    \ both TCP and TP-4 networks.\n  This will add to its management difficulties.\n\
    \  Option 2 will result in greater management difficulties than Option l\n  due\
    \ to the larger number of TCP systems that must eventually be\n  converted and\
    \ the larger time period over which both protocols must be\n  supported.\n  There\
    \ are benefits from each option.  If Option 3 is selected, DOD and\n  its vendors\
    \ have sole responsibility for determining what changes are\n  needed, implementing\
    \ the change, validating the change and the ongoing\n  maintenance of the standard.\
    \  If either Option 1 or Option 2 is\n  chosen, then DOD may encounter difficulty\
    \ in persuading the standards\n  groups to adopt its proposals; however, DOD would\
    \ gain the experience\n  and knowledge of the industry standards-making bodies.\
    \  The industry\n  standards bodies should be receptive to good technical arguments\
    \ for\n  correction of errors or apparent major deficiencies in the protocol.\n\
    \  The standards bodies that maintain the standard should become a\n  technical\
    \ resource for DOD to develop its military specifications.\n  Since TP-4 will\
    \ be a commercial standard, those vendors who adhere to\n  the standard will insure\
    \ that validation facilities are in place.  The\n  National Bureau of Standards\
    \ has a test facility for TP-4.  No such\n  facility exists for TCP.  If Option\
    \ 1 or Option 2 is chosen, DOD can\n  use this facility to validate vendor implementations.\
    \  DOD should work\n  with NBS to develop a similar facility for TCP.  This is\
    \ particularly\n  important for new implementations of TCP.  DOD should continue\
    \ working\n  with and through NBS in getting needed protocol revisions introduced\n\
    \  into the appropriate standards bodies.\n  In summary, Option 3 results in no\
    \ new management difficulties while\n  Option 2 causes the greatest difficulties.\
    \  Option 1 allows DOD to\n  move toward commercialized standard products with\
    \ the smallest\n  addition of management tasks.\n"

  - "EFFECT OF PROPOSED OPTIONS ON MARKET SHARE\n Option 1 would quickly reduce the\
    \ market held by TCP products as TP-4\n products begin to take hold in the marketplace.\
    \  In addition, it would\n enhance the ability of U.S. manufacturers to compete\
    \ in the world\n networks market based on ISO standards because they would not\
    \ have to\n engage in parallel development nor support two sets of protocols for\n\
    \ very long. Option 2 could have a comparable but less pronounced effect\n in\

    \ deployment of TCP-based systems in DOD networks while\n the TP-4 is still in\
    \ the demonstration phase, however, many more\n networks than in Option 1 would\
    \ probably end up using TCP.  This would\n market because their need to develop\
    \ and maintain both TCP products as\n well as TP-4 products would dilute their\
    \ skill resources.  The same\n thing would happen with Option 3.  Although none\
    \ of the options would\n affect the world market for TP-4 greatly, Option 3 would\
    \ result in a\n residual market for TCP products in the DOD and related networks.\n\
    \ Products made specifically for this market would continue to exist, but\n with\
    \ functions limited to this specific market, the products would lack\n some of\
    \ the advantages of large-scale production and product\n development.\n      \

- title: BASIC RECOMMENDATION
  contents:
  - "BASIC RECOMMENDATION\n The committee unanimously recommends that DOD should adopt\
    \ the ISO TP-4\n (and IP) as DOD costandards with its TCP (and IP) and move toward\n\
    \ eventual exclusive use of TP-4.  Transition to use of the ISO\n standards, however,\
    \ must be managed to maintain operational\n capabilities and minimize risks. \
    \ The timing of the transition to use\n of these protocols is, therefore, a major\
    \ concern, and the committee\n was divided on the best schedule to recommend.\n\
    \ A majority of the committee favored immediate adoption of the ISO\n protocols\
    \ as costandards with TCP, giving major procurements in 1984-85\n the option of\
    \ using these standards (Option 1).  A minority favored\n deferring adoption of\
    \ the ISO protocols by the DOD until after a\n demonstration of commercial quality\
    \ implementations supporting military\n applications (Option 2).  This difference\
    \ is reflected in detailed\n recommendations 2-4 below.  The reasons for the two\
    \ viewpoints are\n based on differences within the committee on the extent of\
    \ the risk\n associated with adopting a protocol, TP-4, that has not been\n implemented\
    \ on operational networks.\n"
- title: DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS
  contents:
  - "DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS\n In the following recommendations the committee provides\
    \ details about\n actions that should be taken to implement the basic recommendations.\n\
    \ Most of the recommendations involve actions that require the DOD to\n take the\
    \ lead role, with occasional support from the NBS Institute for\n Computer Sciences\
    \ and Technology.  Some recommendations are directed\n more toward NBS.  Other\
    \ government agencies and parties interested in\n using DOD protocols or in their\
    \ future evolution may also find these\n recommendations applicable.\n (1).  DOD\
    \ should rapidly identify \"open areas\" of the ISO TP-4\n specifications where\
    \ various options for implementation are allowed and\n define a required subset\
    \ for use in DOD systems (a MIL-SPEC version of\n the standards, for example).\
    \  In doing this, the DOD should work with\n the NBS with the goal of developing\
    \ a Federal Standard, that has\n relatively few options for implementation, facilitates\
    \ maximum federal\n interoperability, and makes it clear to vendors which functions\
    \ are\n required in their commercial products.\n (2).  DOD should aggressively\
    \ develop and implement a plan for\n integration of TP-4 as a costandard with\
    \ TCP and for migration toward\n its eventual exclusive use.  The plan should\
    \ include provision for\n rapid completion of a MIL-SPEC (detailed recommendation\
    \ 1), either\n validation or demonstration facilities (detailed recommendation\
    \ 3),\n timing for procurement of systems with the new protocols (detailed\n recommendation\
    \ 4), development of equipment and procedures to support a\n period of joint operation\
    \ with both TCP and TP-4 protocols in use, and\n guidelines for eventual conversion\
    \ of TCP systems to the new protocols.\n Whatever timing is chosen for the introduction\
    \ of ISO protocols, an\n extended period must be expected when both TCP and TP-4\
    \ are in use in\n different systems.  Hence equipment and procedures must be developed\
    \ to\n provide limited communication between systems using the two protocol\n\
    \ sets.  This will include dual protocol operation for some gateways,\n relay\
    \ hosts, service hosts, and terminal concentrators.  A secondary\n purpose of\
    \ the test system described in detailed recommendation 3\n should be to aid in\
    \ development of this transition support equipment.\n Both a general transition\
    \ strategy and specific transition plans for\n each existing system should be\
    \ developed.  The switchover from old to\n new protocols will take place at different\
    \ times as appropriate for\n each system during an overall transition period of\
    \ many years.\n (3).  As soon as possible, the DOD should develop a protocol test\n\
    \ facility. If Option 1 is followed, this facility would serve primarily\n to\
    \ validate implementations of both old and new protocol sets.  If\n Option 2 is\
    \ followed, the facility would initially focus on\n demonstrating the suitability\
    \ of the new protocols for use in a\n military environment as rapidly as possible\
    \ and then provide for\n testing of commercially supplied protocol implementations.\n\
    \ For validation purposes, the NBS protocol-testing facility developed\n for ISO\
    \ protocols should serve as a good basis, but extensions to deal\n with any DOD-specific\
    \ option for the ISO protocols, performance, and\n DOD protocols would be necessary.\
    \  DOD is now beginning such a program.\n For a more complete demonstration, commercial-quality\
    \ implementations\n of the ISO protocols must be obtained and shown to support\
    \ military\n applications in an operational subnetwork such as such as ARPANET\
    \ or\n DODIIS. In both cases the facility should also be used for development\n\
    \ and demonstration of the transition support equipment mentioned in\n detailed\
    \ recommendation 2.\n (4).  Procurements of new networks and major upgrades of\
    \ existing\n networks should favor use of ISO TP-4 as rapidly as possible.  If\n\
    \ Option 1 is followed, RFPs may specify the new protocols immediately.\n If Option\
    \ 2 is followed, this must await successful completion of the\n demonstration\
    \ discussed in recommendation 3.  Procurements for existing\n networks using TCP\
    \ may continue to require TCP-based equipment until an\n appropriate conversion\
    \ point is reached (see detailed recommendation\n 2).\n The purpose of this recommendation\
    \ is to minimize spending on new TCP\n implementations and their subsequent conversion\
    \ to TP-4 where possible,\n while recognizing that some additions to TCP-based\
    \ systems will also be\n needed.  If Option 2 is followed, immediate requirements\
    \ for new\n systems may force new implementations of TCP in these cases also\n\
    \ because the demonstration is not completed at the time RFPs must be\n issued.\n\
    \ (5).  As part of a transition plan, a transport service interface to\n higher-level\
    \ protocols more like that of TP-4 should be developed for\n TCP and tested with\
    \ existing higher-layer protocols.\n This should serve as a rapid test of whether\
    \ existing DOD protocols can\n make effective use of the somewhat different style\
    \ of service that TP-4\n provides.  It should also allow higher-level protocols\
    \ to be modified\n to make use of TP-4 in parallel with the implementation of\
    \ TP-4 itself,\n making the ultimate transition to TP-4 more rapid and certain\
    \ of\n success.  Finally, it may allow use of a single version of the\n higher-level\
    \ protocols to be used on both TCP and TP-4 equipment.\n (6).  DOD should continue\
    \ using existing DOD-specific, higher-level\n protocols for operational purposes\
    \ (Telnet, FTP, and Simple Mail\n Transfer Protocol, for example) but minimize\
    \ effort on their further\n development and plan to adopt suitable ISO protocols\
    \ as they are\n developed.  Research on protocols providing new services (multimedia\n\
    \ mail, compressed video, and voice store-and-forward, for example)\n should continue.\
    \  The committee is pleased to find that DOD is already\n pursuing this course\
    \ of action.\n (7).  The NBS Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology should\n\
    \ maintain close liaison with DOD to ensure that DOD needs for new\n protocols\
    \ and modifications to existing standards are effectively\n represented to appropriate\
    \ standards bodies.  This should include\n research areas such as multimedia mail\
    \ where there is significant\n commercial as well as military interest.\n The\
    \ committee is pleased to find that this is already being done\n through contracts\
    \ from DOD for ICST to represent its interests in\n standardization activities.\
    \  Further cooperation (in demonstrating and\n testing protocols, for example)\
    \ could occur.\n (8).  The NBS and DOD should collaborate from the outset in the\n\
    \ development of new protocols for use as federal standards.  This will\n ensure\
    \ early agreement on functions, features, and services of the\n protocols under\
    \ development. The NBS should present the developing work\n early to the ISO standardization\
    \ activities to expedite convergence on\n internationally acceptable standards.\n\
    \ Such collaboration could help ensure that future protocol standards\n will be\
    \ developed in a single, coordinated process that results in a\n single standard\
    \ accommodating both DOD, other federal agencies, and\n commercial needs.\n (9).\
    \  DOD and NBS should develop additions to protocol specifications\n to support\
    \ preemption of limited resources by high-precedence users.\n Such capabilities\
    \ are needed during high-load situations such as might\n develop during wartime\
    \ or other crisis situations.  They are not yet\n part of either the TCP or TP-4\
    \ specifications or existing\n implementations.  This should be an example of\
    \ the sort of\n collaboration mentioned in detailed recommendations 7 and 8.\n\
    \ This is important to avoid possible incompatibilities between different\n implementations\
    \ of the same specification as discussed in Section III.\n It is likely that vendors\
    \ would welcome guidance on how to deal with\n open areas of the specifications,\
    \ and early action by DOD could result\n in their mandated subset becoming the\
    \ de facto standard for most\n commercial implementations as well, with consequent\
    \ benefits to DOD.\n This is a good area for cooperation between DOD and NBS.\n"
- title: ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
  contents:
  - "ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n Transition Plan\n  This section describes the major\
    \ elements of a transition plan from\n  use of TCP to use of TP-4 in DOD systems.\
    \  The plan will vary\n  depending on the option chosen.  Both Option 1 and Option\
    \ 2 share a\n  number of common elements that are discussed first, including\n\
    \  development of a MIL-SPEC, protocol-testing facilities, and transition\n  support\
    \ equipment. If Option 2 is followed, a demonstration of TP-4\n  must also be\
    \ undertaken.\n  MIL-SPEC.  As noted in recommendation 1, several open areas and\n\
    \  options in the ISO TP-4 must be specified in order to have complete\n  and\
    \ compatible protocol implementations.  Completion of this\n  specification by\
    \ the DOD should be a top priority objective.\n  Protocol-Testing Facilities.\
    \  As noted in recommendation 3, test\n  facilities for protocol implementations\
    \ are essential.  Under Option\n  1, this facility should serve primarily to validate\
    \ implementations of\n  both old and new protocol sets.  If Option 2 is followed,\
    \ the facility\n  should initially focus on demonstrating the suitability of the\
    \ new\n  protocols for use in a military environment as rapidly as possible,\n\
    \  and provide for testing of commercially supplied protocol\n  implementations.\n\
    \  For validation purposes, the NBS protocol-testing facility developed\n  for\
    \ ISO protocols should serve as a good basis, but extensions to deal\n  with any\
    \ DOD-specific options for the ISO protocols, performance, and\n  DOD protocols\
    \ would be necessary.  The DOD has stated that such a\n  program has been started.\n\
    \  Transition Support Equipment.  In any transition plan it must be\n  assumed\
    \ that the large body of systems with existing TCP\n  implementations will take\
    \ a substantial period of time to switch\n  completely to the use of the ISO protocols.\
    \  Some networks will\n  include many different communities sharing a common communications\n\
    \  backbone.  Members of one community communicate primarily among\n  themselves,\
    \ but occasionally outside their community.  While members\n  of one community\
    \ are likely to change over as a group, different\n  communities will change to\
    \ use the new protocols at different times.\n  Hence an interim period must be\
    \ anticipated when some systems are\n  using the old protocols and others, the\
    \ new protocols.  The transition\n  plan must provide some means of allowing interaction\
    \ between old and\n  new systems where required during this period.  Toward this\
    \ end, a\n  number of relay hosts may need to be developed that support both old\n\
    \  and new protocols.  These will allow automatic-staged forwarding of\n  electronic\
    \ mail between old and new systems and manually set up file\n  transfer or remote\
    \ terminal access via the relays.  Performance\n  through these relays will not\
    \ be as good as with direct connections,\n  but the relays should provide an adequate\
    \ level of service for\n  occasional interactions among different communities\
    \ of the internet\n  system.\n  When more frequent interaction is anticipated\
    \ and better service is\n  needed, major service hosts should support both old\
    \ and new protocol\n  sets concurrently so they can provide service directly without\n\
    \  requiring the use of relays.  Such service hosts include widely used\n  time-sharing\
    \ machines, file servers, and special servers such as\n  Network Information Centers,\
    \ Network Operations Centers, and\n  Administrator Machines (providing mailboxes\
    \ of network administrators,\n  for example).  Some dual protocol servers\n  may\
    \ also act as relays where the load of both functions can be\n  supported.\n \
    \ Terminal concentrators for general use must also support both protocol\n  sets\
    \ so that connections to both old and new hosts can be made\n  directly.\n  Gateways\
    \ must support both old and new IPs so hosts using either one\n  may send internet\
    \ traffic.  This requirement could be relaxed in the\n  case of entire networks\
    \ that will switch over simultaneously and hence\n  will only need one type of\
    \ IP traffic.  Gateways should not have to\n  translate between old and new IPs--it\
    \ will be assumed that both source\n  and destination hosts are using the same\
    \ protocols or going through an\n  explicit relay intermediate host.\n  This latter\
    \ point requires some elaboration.  If one type of IP packet\n  arrives at a destination\
    \ host or gateway that only handles the other\n  type, it must be discarded. \
    \ It would be good if, in addition, a\n  suitable ICMP error packet could be returned\
    \ in the unsupported\n  protocol so it would be meaningful to the source.  To\
    \ avoid this\n  situation the internet-host name table maintained by the Network\n\
    \  Information Center should indicate which protocol(s) each host\n  supports.\
    \  Then when a source host looks up the address of a\n  destination, it will also\
    \ determine which type protocol to use or if a\n  relay is required.\n Demonstration\
    \ Plan\n  If Option 2 is followed, a major demonstration of the ISO protocols\
    \ in\n  a military environment must be undertaken.  Any such demonstration\n \
    \ should proceed by stages beginning with the implementation of TP-4 in\n  one\
    \ network (15).  Then the demonstration would be extended to include\n  internetting\
    \ (still with DOD IP) to validate the suitability of TP-4\n  as a replacement\
    \ for TCP.  The demonstration would then be further\n  extended to employ the\
    \ ISO IP in place of DOD IP.\n  Stand-Alone TP-4 Network Demonstration.  The first\
    \ stage of any\n  transition plan must be to establish a demonstration network\
    \ or\n  subnetwork using TP-4 in place of TCP under existing higher-level\n  protocols.\
    \ This step will require selection of a suitable network (or\n  subnetwork), procurement\
    \ of TP-4 implementations for hosts and\n  terminal access controllers on that\
    \ network, and modification of\n  higher-level protocols to use TP-4.  The demonstration\
    \ should include\n  sufficient use of real applications to test the protocols\
    \ in an\n  operational environment.\n  To limit the amount of change attempted\
    \ at one time, the DOD IP may be\n  retained and used under TP-4.  Alternatively,\
    \ if ISO IP development\n  status seems to warrant it, ISO IP may be installed\
    \ along with TP-4.\n"

  - "(DOD IP) and the Transport Protocol (TP-4) and its Internetwork Protocol\n  In\
    \ the latter case, all TP-4 hosts would be on the same network\n  anyway, so that\
    \ IP will only be used between hosts and no gateways\n  will be involved and no\
    \ gateway modifications will be needed.\n  The hosts involved could be dedicated\
    \ to the demonstration and hence\n  only support TP-4 and only be able to interact\
    \ with other\n  demonstration network hosts or be concurrently supporting TCP\
    \ and DOD\n  IP for operational traffic to other \"normal\" hosts.  In the latter\n\
    \  case, no forwarding or relaying of traffic by hosts between normal and\n  ISO\
    \ logical networks would be allowed or performed (the demonstration\n  network\
    \ would be logically closed).\n  Stand-Alone TP-4 Internet Demonstration.  The\
    \ next step would be to\n  expand the demonstration to include more than one network\
    \ (at least\n  logically) and hence involve gateways.  If only TP-4 is involved,\
    \ this\n  is a simple extension to test TP-4 over longer internet paths with\n\
    \  more variable performance.  If ISO IP is also being tested at the same\n  time,\
    \ modification of the gateways involved will also be required as\n  indicated\
    \ in the next section.\n  Stand-Alone ISO IP Demonstration.  Once TP-4 has been\
    \ tested,\n  introduction of the ISO IP to replace DOD IP may commence.  In\n\
    \  addition to simply replacing one IP with the other in hosts and\n  gateways,\
    \ this will require modification of the gateways to perform\n  ICMP and GGP on\
    \ top of the ISO IP.\n  These gateways could either be dedicated to the demonstration\
    \ and\n  hence have only ISO IP, or could be concurrently supporting normal\n\
    \  operational traffic via DOD IP.  In the latter case, once again, no\n  forwarding\
    \ of traffic between ISO demonstration internet and normal\n  systems would be\
    \ allowed.\n  At the conclusion of these three steps, the ISO TP-4 and IP could\
    \ be\n  deemed to have demonstrated their basic functional suitability in a\n\
    \  military environment.  The transition support equipment described\n  above\
    \ should have been developed in parallel, providing the capability\n  to smoothly\
    \ and successfully switch operational systems using the old\n  protocols to use\
    \ of the new protocols.\n Switchover of User Systems\n  Once the above preparations\
    \ have been made and the demonstration\n  completed, if Option 2 is being followed,\
    \ the switchover of user\n  systems can commence.  Each network or community within\
    \ a network\n  should be able to switch at its convenience and maintain the ability\n\
    \  to interact with other systems.  The user systems will not be required\n  to\
    \ support operational use of both protocol sets simultaneously at any\n  time\
    \ unless they wish to do so for their own reliability purposes.\n  Switchover\
    \ of user systems also requires a personnel-training effort.\n  While earlier\
    \ steps involved a relatively small number of specialists\n  and support staff\
    \ at major sites, this step will affect all user\n  sites, and their network support\
    \ staff must be trained in the new\n  procedures.\n  Once switchover of all systems\
    \ to the new protocol set is complete,\n  support for the old protocols by TACS,\
    \ service hosts, and gateways can\n  be removed.\n Lessons Learned from the ARPANET\
    \ NCP-to-TCP Transition\n  The following points summarize some important lessons\
    \ learned during\n  the ARPANET transition from NCP to TCP (16).\n   Conversion\
    \ of TACs and service hosts to support both protocols before\n   the transition\
    \ of user hosts starts is essential.\n   Relay capabilities were heavily used\
    \ for mail, but used little for\n   other purposes.\n   The Network Information\
    \ Center was not ready to support the new\n   protocols and this caused problems\
    \ in distributing the host name\n   table.\n   There were significant performance\
    \ problems that required careful\n   analysis and parameter tuning after the transition.\
    \  These were\n   unavoidable because no service host had been stressed prior\
    \ to the\n   switchover, with a full user load over a long time period using the\n\
    \   new protocols.\n"
