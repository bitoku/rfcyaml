  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The warranty certificate extension identifies the warranty\
    \ policy\n   associated with a X.509 public key certificate [X.509-97, PROFILE].\n\
    \   Often the Certificate Authority (CA) will obtain an insurance policy\n   to\
    \ ensure coverage of the warranty.\n   The certificate warranty provides an extended\
    \ monetary coverage for\n   the end entities.  The certificate warranty primarily\
    \ concerns the\n   use, storage, and reliance on a certificate by a subscriber,\
    \ a\n   relying party, and the CA.  It is common for a CA to establish\n   reliance\
    \ limits on the use of a certificate.  It is not uncommon for\n   a CA to attempt\
    \ through contractual means to exclude its liability\n   entirely.  However, this\
    \ undermines the confidence that commerce\n   requires to gainfully use certificates.\n\
    \   Alternatively a CA may provide extended coverage for the use of the\n   certificate.\
    \  Usually, the subscriber pays for the extended warranty\n   coverage.  In turn,\
    \ subscribers are covered by an appropriately\n   drafted insurance policy.  The\
    \ certificate warranty is backed by an\n   insurance policy issued by a licensed\
    \ insurance company, which\n   results in a financial backing that is far greater\
    \ than that of the\n   CA.  This extra financial backing provides a further element\
    \ of\n   confidence necessary to encourage the use of certificates in\n   commerce.\n\
    \   A relying party that has a warranty from a CA may obtain compensation\n  \
    \ from a CA depending on the conditions for such compensation expressed\n   in\
    \ either the CA's Certificate Policy, the CA's insurance policy, or\n   both.\
    \  Evidence of an extended warranty, provided through the\n   certificate extension,\
    \ will give the relying party additional\n   confidence that compensation is possible,\
    \ and therefore will enhance\n   trust in the process.  Risk for a non-subscriber\
    \ relying party may be\n   reduced by the presence of a warranty extension with\
    \ an explicit\n   warranty stated.  The warranty extension allows this aspect\
    \ of risk\n   management to be automated.\n   When a certificate contains a warranty\
    \ certificate extension, the\n   extension MUST be non-critical, and MUST contain\
    \ either a NULL to\n   indicate that no warranty is provided or base warranty\
    \ data to\n   indicate that a warranty is provided.  The extension MAY contain\n\
    \   optional qualifiers.\n"

  - "2.  Warranty Extension Format\n   Like all X.509 certificate extensions, the\
    \ warranty certificate\n   extension is defined using ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88].\n\
    \   The non-critical warranty extension is identified by id-pe-warranty.\n   PKIX\
    \ Object Identifier Registry\n   id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)\n\
    \              dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }\n   PKIX\
    \ Arcs\n   id-mod  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 0 }    -- modules\n   id-pe\
    \   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 1 }    -- private\n   certificate extensions\n\
    \   PKIX modules\n   id-mod-warranty-extn         OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod\
    \ 27 }\n   id-pe-warranty OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-pe 16 }\n   A non-null\
    \ warranty always includes a base warranty.  The warranty\n   information includes\
    \ the period during which the warranty applies, a\n   warranty value, and a warranty\
    \ type.  The warranty type tells the\n   warranty limit against claims.  The extension\
    \ definition supports two\n   alternatives: aggregated and per-transaction.  With\
    \ aggregation,\n   claims are fulfilled until a ceiling value is reached.  After\
    \ that,\n   no further claims are fulfilled.  With per-transaction, a ceiling\n\
    \   value is imposed on each claim, but each transaction is considered\n   independently.\n\
    \   The warranty extension permits inclusion of two optional warranty\n   qualifiers.\
    \  The first qualifier provides extended warranty\n   information, the second\
    \ provides a pointer to the warranty terms and\n   conditions.\n   When present,\
    \ the extended warranty information provides information\n   about coverage beyond\
    \ the scope of the base warranty.  Like the base\n   warranty information, the\
    \ extended warranty information includes the\n   period during which the warranty\
    \ applies, a warranty value, and a\n   warranty type.\n   When present, the terms\
    \ and conditions pointer provides a reference\n   to a document containing the\
    \ terms and conditions associated with the\n   warranty.  The document may be\
    \ a Certificate Policy that contains\n   this information, a document specifically\
    \ about the warranty, or a\n   Relying Party Agreement.  The pointer is always\
    \ a uniform resource\n   locator (URL).  The URL MUST be a non-relative URL using\
    \ the http\n   scheme.  The URL MUST follow the URL syntax and encoding rules\n\
    \   specified in RFC 3986 [URI].\n"

- title: 2.2.  Warranty Extension Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Warranty Extension Semantics\n   Warranty is a CHOICE; it is represented\
    \ either by NULL or\n   WarrantyData.  If the CA selects NULL, then the CA is\
    \ explicitly\n   stating that no warranty is provided.  If the CA selects\n  \
    \ WarrantyData, then the CA is explicitly stating that a warranty is\n   provided,\
    \ and the fields within the WarrantyData type MUST provide\n   details about that\
    \ warranty.\n   WarrantyData MUST contain information about the base warranty.\n\
    \   WarrantyData MAY contain information about an extended warranty.\n   Both\
    \ base warranty and extended warranty information is provided\n   using the WarrantyInfo\
    \ type.  WarrantyData MAY contain a URL that\n   points to the terms and conditions\
    \ of the warranty.  The URL is\n   provided using the TermsAndConditionsURL type,\
    \ which is an IA5\n   string.  The IA5String MUST contain a URI [URI] using the\
    \ http\n   scheme, such as \"http://www.example.com/warranty/t_and_c.html\".\n\
    \   WarrantyInfo MUST contain the warranty validity period, the currency\n   amount\
    \ of the warranty, and the type of warranty.  The warranty\n   validity period\
    \ is provided using the WarrantyValidityPeriod type.\n   The currency amount of\
    \ the warranty is provided using the\n   CurrencyAmount type.  The type of warranty\
    \ is provided using the\n   WarrantyType type.\n   WarrantyValidityPeriod is a\
    \ CHOICE; it is represented either by NULL\n   or ValidityPeriod.  If the CA selects\
    \ NULL, then the validity periods\n   of the warranty and the certificate MUST\
    \ be exactly the same.  If the\n   CA selects ValidityPeriod, then the CA is explicitly\
    \ stating a\n   warranty validity period that is different than the validity period\n\
    \   of the certificate.  If the validity periods of the warranty and the\n   certificate\
    \ are the same, then the CA MUST select the NULL choice.\n   The validity periods\
    \ are expected to be the same in the vast majority\n   of the cases.  ValidityPeriod\
    \ is a SEQUENCE of two GeneralizedTime\n   values.  The first (notBefore) GeneralizedTime\
    \ value MUST indicate\n   the date and time that the warranty becomes valid, and\
    \ the second\n   (notAfter) GeneralizedTime value MUST indicate the date and time\
    \ that\n   the warranty expires.\n   CurrencyAmount is a SEQUENCE of three integers\
    \ which together specify\n   the currency and a monetary value.  The first integer\
    \ (currency) MUST\n   indicate the currency using one of the currency codes defined\
    \ in\n   [ISO4217].  The second integer (amount) MUST indicate the value of\n\
    \   the warranty.  The third integer (amtExp10) MUST indicate the correct\n  \
    \ placement of the decimal point in the monetary value, and MUST be the\n   minor\
    \ unit of currency specified in [ISO4217].  For example\n   $48,525.50 (in US\
    \ dollars) is represented as:\n      currency =      840\n      amount   =  4852550\n\
    \      amtExp10 =        2\n   WarrantyType is an integer.  A value of zero indicates\
    \ that claims\n   against the warranty will be aggregated, and once the value\
    \ of\n   fulfilled claims reaches the warranty currency amount, then no\n   further\
    \ claim will be fulfilled.  A value of one indicates that each\n   claim is handled\
    \ independently, but no individual claim can exceed\n   the warranty currency\
    \ amount.  The CA MUST select either zero or one\n   for this integer value.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The procedures and practices employed by the\
    \ CA MUST ensure that the\n   correct values for the warranty are inserted in\
    \ each issued\n   certificate.  Relying parties and users may accept or reject\
    \ a\n   particular certificate for an intended use based on the information\n\
    \   provided in warranty extension.  Incorrect representation of the\n   actual\
    \ warranty may result in otherwise avoidable warranty claims for\n   the CA.\n"
