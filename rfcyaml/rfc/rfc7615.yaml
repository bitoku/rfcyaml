  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines the \"Authentication-Info\" and
    \"Proxy-\n   Authentication-Info\" response header fields for use in HTTP\n   authentication
    schemes ([RFC7235]) that need to return information\n   once the client's authentication
    credentials have been accepted.\n   Both were previously defined in Section 3
    of [RFC2617], defining the\n   HTTP \"Digest\" authentication scheme.  This document
    generalizes the\n   description for use not only in \"Digest\" ([RFC7616]), but
    also in\n   other future schemes that might have the same requirements for\n   carrying
    additional information during authentication.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF)\n   notation of [RFC5234] with a list extension, defined in Section
    7 of\n   [RFC7230], that allows for compact definition of comma-separated\n   lists
    using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates\n   repetition).
    \ The ABNF production for \"auth-param\" is defined in\n   Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].\n"
  title: 2.  Notational Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.  The Authentication-Info Response Header Field\n   HTTP authentication schemes
    can use the Authentication-Info response\n   header field to communicate information
    after the client's\n   authentication credentials have been accepted.  This information
    can\n   include a finalization message from the server (e.g., it can contain\n
    \  the server authentication).\n   The field value is a list of parameters (name/value
    pairs), using the\n   \"auth-param\" syntax defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].
    \ This\n   specification only describes the generic format; authentication\n   schemes
    using Authentication-Info will define the individual\n   parameters.  The \"Digest\"
    Authentication Scheme, for instance,\n   defines multiple parameters in Section
    3.5 of [RFC7616].\n     Authentication-Info = #auth-param\n   The Authentication-Info
    header field can be used in any HTTP\n   response, independently of request method
    and status code.  Its\n   semantics are defined by the authentication scheme indicated
    by the\n   Authorization header field ([RFC7235], Section 4.2) of the\n   corresponding
    request.\n   A proxy forwarding a response is not allowed to modify the field\n
    \  value in any way.\n   Authentication-Info can be used inside trailers ([RFC7230],\n
    \  Section 4.1.2) when the authentication scheme explicitly allows this.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Parameter Value Format\n   Parameter values can be expressed either as
      \"token\" or as \"quoted-\n   string\" (Section 3.2.6 of [RFC7230]).\n   Authentication
      scheme definitions need to allow both notations, both\n   for senders and recipients.
      \ This allows recipients to use generic\n   parsing components, independent
      of the authentication scheme in use.\n   For backwards compatibility, authentication
      scheme definitions can\n   restrict the format for senders to one of the two
      variants.  This can\n   be important when it is known that deployed implementations
      will fail\n   when encountering one of the two formats.\n"

  title: 3.  The Authentication-Info Response Header Field
- contents:
  - "4.  The Proxy-Authentication-Info Response Header Field\n   The Proxy-Authentication-Info
    response header field is equivalent to\n   Authentication-Info, except that it
    applies to proxy authentication\n   ([RFC7235], Section 2) and its semantics are
    defined by the\n   authentication scheme indicated by the Proxy-Authorization
    header\n   field ([RFC7235], Section 4.4) of the corresponding request:\n     Proxy-Authentication-Info
    = #auth-param\n   However, unlike Authentication-Info, the Proxy-Authentication-Info\n
    \  header field applies only to the next outbound client on the response\n   chain.
    \ This is because only the client that chose a given proxy is\n   likely to have
    the credentials necessary for authentication.\n   However, when multiple proxies
    are used within the same\n   administrative domain, such as office and regional
    caching proxies\n   within a large corporate network, it is common for credentials
    to be\n   generated by the user agent and passed through the hierarchy until\n
    \  consumed.  Hence, in such a configuration, it will appear as if\n   Proxy-Authentication-Info
    is being forwarded because each proxy will\n   send the same field value.\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Adding information to HTTP responses that are
    sent over an\n   unencrypted channel can affect security and privacy.  The presence
    of\n   the header fields alone indicates that HTTP authentication is in use.\n
    \  Additional information could be exposed by the contents of the\n   authentication-scheme
    specific parameters; this will have to be\n   considered in the definitions of
    these schemes.\n"
