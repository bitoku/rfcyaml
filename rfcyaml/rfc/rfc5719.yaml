  - "Abstract\n   The Diameter base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides\
    \ a\n   number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands (i.e.,\n\
    \   messages used by Diameter applications) and applications as the most\n   extensive\
    \ enhancements.  RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that\n   lead to the need\
    \ to define a new Diameter application or a new\n   command code.  Depending on\
    \ the scope of the Diameter extension, IETF\n   actions are necessary.  Although\
    \ defining new Diameter applications\n   does not require IETF consensus, defining\
    \ new Diameter commands\n   requires IETF consensus per RFC 3588.  This has led\
    \ to questionable\n   design decisions by other Standards Development Organizations,\
    \ which\n   chose to define new applications on existing commands -- rather than\n\
    \   asking for assignment of new command codes -- for the pure purpose of\n  \
    \ avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF.  In some cases,\n   interoperability\
    \ problems were an effect of the poor design caused by\n   overloading existing\
    \ commands.\n   This document aligns the extensibility rules of the Diameter\n\
    \   application with the Diameter commands, offering ways to delegate\n   work\
    \ on Diameter to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does\n   not lead\
    \ to poor design choices.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Diameter Base specification, described in [RFC3588],\
    \ provides a\n   number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands\
    \ (i.e.,\n   messages used by Diameter applications) and applications as the most\n\
    \   extensive enhancements.  [RFC3588] illustrates the conditions that\n   require\
    \ the definition of a new Diameter application or a new\n   command.  Depending\
    \ on the scope of the Diameter extension, IETF\n   actions are necessary.  Although\
    \ defining new Diameter applications\n   does not require IETF consensus, defining\
    \ new Diameter commands\n   requires IETF consensus per RFC 3588.  This has led\
    \ to questionable\n   design decisions by other Standards Development Organizations\
    \ (SDOs),\n   which chose to define new applications on existing commands -- rather\n\
    \   than asking for assignment of new command codes -- for the pure\n   purpose\
    \ of avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF.  In\n   some cases, interoperability\
    \ problems were an effect of poor the\n   design caused by overloading existing\
    \ commands.\n   This document aligns the extensibility rules for Diameter command\n\
    \   codes with those defined for Diameter application identifiers and\n   offers\
    \ a consistent way to delegate work on Diameter to other SDOs to\n   extend Diameter\
    \ in a way that does not lead to poor design choices.\n   This is achieved by\
    \ splitting the command code space into ranges and\n   providing different allocation\
    \ policies to them: the first range is\n   reserved for RADIUS backward compatibility,\
    \ allocation of a command\n   code in the second number range requires IETF review,\
    \ the third range\n   is utilized by vendor-specific command codes, and finally\
    \ the last\n   range is for experimental commands.  Section 4 provides more details\n\
    \   about the command code number ranges, and the different allocation\n   policies\
    \ are described in [RFC5226].\n   A revision of RFC 3588 is currently in development\
    \ in the IETF DIME\n   WG [RFC3588bis]; when approved, it will obsolete RFC 3588\
    \ as well as\n   this document.  A goal of this document is to provide in advance\
    \ the\n   change in the command codes allocation policy, so that\n   interoperability\
    \ problems like the ones described above are avoided\n   as soon as possible.\n"

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document modifies the IANA allocation of\
    \ Diameter command codes\n   in relationship to RFC 3588.  This process change\
    \ itself does not\n   raise security concerns, but the command code space is split\
    \ into a\n   standard command code space and a vendor-specific command code space,\n\
    \   the latter being allocated on a First Come, First Served basis by\n   IANA\
    \ at the request of vendors or other standards organizations.\n   Whenever work\
    \ gets delegated to organizations outside the IETF, there\n   is always the chance\
    \ that security reviews will be conducted in\n   different manner and that the\
    \ criteria and style of those reviews\n   will be different than the reviews performed\
    \ in the IETF.  The\n   members of the DIME working group are aware of the risks\
    \ involved in\n   using different security and quality review processes and of\
    \ the\n   desire to offload work (e.g., to reduce the workload in the IETF) to\n\
    \   other organizations.  Other organizations are therefore made\n   responsible\
    \ for the quality of the specifications they produce.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This section describes changes to the IANA Considerations\
    \ sections\n   outlined in RFC 3588 regarding the allocation of command codes\
    \ by\n   IANA.\n   The command code namespace is used to identify Diameter commands.\n\
    \   The values 0 - 255 (0x00 - 0xff) are reserved for RADIUS backward\n   compatibility\
    \ and are defined as \"RADIUS Packet Type Codes\" in\n   [RADTYPE].  Values 256\
    \ - 8,388,607 (0x100 - 0x7fffff) are for\n   permanent, standard commands allocated\
    \ by IETF Review [RFC5226].\n   [RFC3588] defines the command codes 257, 258,\
    \ 271, 274, 275, 280, and\n   282; see Section 3.1 in [RFC3588] for the assignment\
    \ of the namespace\n   in that specification.\n   The values 8,388,608 - 16,777,213\
    \ (0x800000 - 0xfffffd) are reserved\n   for vendor-specific command codes, to\
    \ be allocated on a First Come,\n   First Served basis by IANA [RFC5226].  The\
    \ request to IANA for a\n   vendor-specific command code SHOULD include a reference\
    \ to a publicly\n   available specification that documents the command in sufficient\n\
    \   detail to aid in interoperability between independent\n   implementations.\
    \  If the specification cannot be made publicly\n   available, the request for\
    \ a vendor-specific command code MUST\n   include the contact information of persons\
    \ and/or entities\n   responsible for authoring and maintaining the command.\n\
    \   The values 16,777,214 and 16,777,215 (hexadecimal values 0xfffffe -\n   0xffffff)\
    \ are reserved for experimental commands.  As these codes are\n   only for experimental\
    \ and testing purposes, no guarantee is made for\n   interoperability between\
    \ Diameter peers using experimental commands,\n   as outlined in [RFC3692].\n"
